<TABLE BGCOLOR=#ccffff WIDTH=60% BORDER=0 BORDERCOLOR=#0000ff> <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1> <A NAME=POST616>  By <B><!-Email-!><A HREF="mailto:worried70@hotmail.com"><!-/Email-!><!-Name-!>Badaph<!-/Name-!></A></B> on Monday, November 20, 2000 - 01:04 pm:</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><P> <!-Text-!> ~this tale begins above with &#34;Whar be me brudder Badaph?&#34;~ <BR> <BR>Around mid-day reinforcements dispatched by Dimond landed in Freeport and made their way to the evil dungeon of Befallen. Among them, the recovering chief Moradinson, Mamrubee, Bideach, and Dwyryn. From the Clan Axepeak’ allies, Katazz, a shiny halfling cleric, also joined the force. Passing through Freeport they also acquired the services of a pretty human bard by the name of Syreen.  <BR> <BR>As they assembled just inside the dungeon, Bado spit them into two groups. The first group, lead by Mamrubee, would hold a critical location midway on the second level. While the second group, lead by Bado, pushed deeper in search of the shady gnome merchant. Prior to marching forth, Bado spied a fine dwarven cleric by the name of Garvin slaying undead minions close to the entrance. After a brief conversation Garvin agreed to help Bado in his search.  <BR> <BR>They pushed through the first floor with great slaughter. The pitiful forces were no match for the Clan’s concentrated might. As they reached the staging point on the second level, the first group set up station.  <BR> <BR>“Mamrubee, yer group guard these upper halls while we others descend deeper. We nae know whot lies ahead and ifun we have ta fall back here be where we stand, for good or ill.”,  Bado says <BR> <BR>Mamrubee nodded in agreement and went about setting up the defense. The rest hefted sword and axe and delved deeper. Right away they were attacked by a smattering of skeletons and evil necromancers. But the company was prepared and dispatched them quickly. They discovered a secret door that lead to a cavernous area filled with ghouls and more evil casters.  <BR> <BR>Spell and sword lashed out and quickly squashed the denizens of Befallen. With their rear guarded by Mamrubee and company, they through caution to the wind and the wholesale slaughter commenced.  <BR> <BR>Then, as they backtracked, through the secret door they come upon a gnome.  <BR> <BR>“There he be!” cries Bado.  <BR> <BR>“Whar be my brudder ye slag ov a gnome?”, Bado says threateningly.  <BR> <BR>The gnome turns and regards Bado with a faraway look in his eyes. He then begins speaking in a strange language that none gathered had heard before. Then, with no warning, magic flies from the gnome’s fingertips and knocks Bado back.    <BR> <BR>“Raugh Ar Dunn!” cries Moradinson as he swoops in, sword swinging.  <BR> <BR>Undead pour from behind and to the side of the 4-dwarf group. They draw up in a tight circle, back to one another and fend off the rush. With the might of Brell behind them, they swiftly crush the attackers.  <BR> <BR>Bado kneels and examines the dead form of the gnome. Skillfully he searches his body for any belongings that might help discover what happened to his brother. Reaching in the dead gnome’s pack, he quickly pulls back his fingers.  <BR> <BR>“Gordul! This lads got a mouse or something in his back” he exclaims. <BR> <BR>Reaching in more carefully he sees the item he brushed up against. It is a dark piece of armor. Gingerly he touches it again. Its very cold. Like its been sitting in ice water or something.  He pulls it out of the pack and turns it over, examining it with the eye of a gem cutter. It is a plate gorget, very light yet seemingly very strong. On the inside rim off the neck portion Bado spies some writing of some type.  <BR> <BR>“Lookie here lads. Seems there be some scribblin’s on the inside of this armor. Ye lads know whot it says?”  <BR> <BR>The others look it over and none seem to know.  <BR> <BR>“Hrmm, well me uncle be about the finest smith me knows of, perhaps he know whot this says.” Bado says. “Me thinks we should take it to ‘im and lets him sees it. He is in Kaladim this week doing some religious stuff at th’ temple.”  <BR> <BR>Those gathered agree that would be the best course of action. They all gather various coins and such from their slain foes and begin moving out. Without a second thought Bado slips on the gorget and head off after them.  <BR> <BR>The first group welcomed them back and congratulated them on a job well done even though they didn’t find Badaph, they did find a clue hopefully. They soon exited the evil dungeon, to be greeted by a warm and friendly sun shining down upon the western commons.  <BR> <BR>Bado coughs. “Gordul, me think me caught a wee cold being in dat damp dungeon.” <BR> <BR>He takes a few steps and stumbles a bit.  <BR> <BR>“Ye alright lad?” asked the chief.  <BR> <BR>“Sure! I be right as rain.” Bado says in a strained voice.  <BR> <BR>He takes a few more steps and falls to the ground. Mamrubee tries a few healing spells she knows but they don’t seem to help Bado’s condition.  <BR> <BR>“Quick lads, something nae be right here. We best git Bado back to Kaladim. His uncle might know whot be ailing him.”. says Moradinson. <!-/Text-!> <P>
