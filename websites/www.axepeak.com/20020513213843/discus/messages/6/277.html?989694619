She looks around for signs of people, sees none.  She sets down her shield and pushes her sheathed sword out of the way, digs through her battered backpack for something to leave a message on.  She finds a wrinkled parchment, and a writing instrument and quickly begins to scrawl out a message in her elegant, flowing script.  She quickly checks again for another person, and seeing none, places the parchment on a table and anchors it with a candle.  She turns, picks up her shield, and leaves as quietly as she came.~ <BR> <BR>Dear Lord Moradinson,  <BR>I know tis but short notice, but I would like to invite your mighty Clan to attend a healing station in Crushbone this Thursday, May 10, at the hourof 7 pm EST.   <BR>This station is to introduce my two newest Pages, Xiphius and Volki, to the ideals held high by my fellow Knights.  And, of course, to teach my two newest pages the lessons of recognizing the needs of others before they must ask for help.  Tis a valuable lesson, and one your Clan recognizes well. <BR>As I said, tis short notice.  If your Clan has other plans made all ready, it will be most understood.  I do, however, hope that you can attend.  I do so enjoy the company of Clan Axepeak. <BR>Please, Milord, be cautious in your travels, and I look forward to seeing you again. <BR>Sincerely, <BR>Lady Norielynn Elentari <BR>Initiator <BR>Knight of the Round Table <!-/Text-!> <P>

An armored guard steps out from his hidden post, closing the panel behind him.  The guard trots over to the table, picks up the note left by the lady knight, and hastens to deliver it to the offices of the Rorn Gor deep within the delves. <BR>------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Storm Moradinson reads the note carefully, rubbing his graying beard as he considers its contents.  A smile of nostalgic reminiscence turns up the corner of his mouth as he thinks back to the distant past. <BR> <BR>The old dwarf remembers fighting duergar alongside knights such as Tuvor, and carving a fine set of stone ale taps with mithril spigots for the Meeting halls of Camelot.  These events were years ago, and few of the human knights would have memories able to remember those elder days in Neverwinter.  Still, all he has heard, and his travels with Lord Vinmana of the Knights convince Storm that the ideals of the Knights of the Round Table have remained true over the passage of time. <BR> <BR>The Rorn Gor pens a quick notice and hands it to the waiting guard. <BR> <BR>&#34;See tha&#39; this be posted in the Torsting hall.  Let th&#39; kin know their chief looks on these ganglers wi&#39; favor if&#39;n any kin be available to offer our aid in this endeavor.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>-Storm Moradinson <BR>Clan Axepeak Rorn Gor <BR>Old Mithrilbones <!-/Text-!> <P>

By all accounts, the healing and buffing station was a success.  She accepted two ales from one of her pages, and passed one to Lord Moradinson.  She watched in amusement as he drained it much more quickly than she could ever hope to do.  &#34;Was a good night, Milord.&#34;  She said as she tried to chug the beer, in the same fashion as Lord Moradinson.  She failed, of course.  &#34;We would not have been able to do it without your help, or that of your powerful cleric, Patorus.  And the young enchanter!  Cilis, he was wonderful as well.  Thank you, Milord.  We thank you more than you can know.&#34; <BR> <BR>She hefted her tankard again, and drained it this time, astounding not only Lord Moradinson, who was beginning to grin at her, but herself as well.  Norielynn stood, bid Lord Moradinson a good night and safe journeys, and hiccupped her way to a nearby inn at Kelethin to retire for the night. <!-/Text-!> <P>
