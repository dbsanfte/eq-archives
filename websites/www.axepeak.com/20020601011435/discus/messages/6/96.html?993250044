Clerics of any given level typically have 3 buffs to offer, one pure AC buff, one AC and Hp buff and one pure HP buff. This last Buff is referred to as the Symbol line of buffs. The first is named Symbol of Transal &#40;lvl 14&#41;. It is this buff &#40;symbol&#41; that you will most seldomly see offered.  That is because it requires a spell component to cast, a gem. These gems are sold by vendors that offer the items for the jewelry trade. And cost varying amounts of course. I am going to use round numbers in this discussion so forgive me for rounding up. The lowest symbol spell which offers the least HP of course uses a Catseye-agate, cost about 3 gp. <BR> <BR>At lvl 24 Symbol of Ryltan uses a Bloodstone, cost 6 gp, at lvl 34 Symbol of Pinzarn uses Jasper, cost 1pp. It is my policy to cast these spells on the pullers only and/or on kin that I am taking extra special care of and lastly often myself. <BR> <BR>I don’t know how many of you have more then 1k pp in your bank, but I have never had 400 pp in my char’s life. One reason is the constant drain of symbol another is buying spells at each new spell circle. My latest circle cost me about 23 pp per spell. Another reason many clerics are broke is that we are often kept so manna desperate by our group we don’t come out of our spell books long enough to loot. This is most commonly a problem with FFA. <BR> <BR>Thus my suggestion, if you want your group’s CL to symbol you bring your own gems. Bring a variety of them if possible, as manna is often are real problem and lower lvl symbols are less manna intensive. <BR> <BR>Hint gems are sold in Free Port in the hall of magic. They won’t sell to dwarves unless you have done some faction work. But in the east commons at the extreme west &#40;zone border&#41; there is an inn, the eastern outer building contains a vendor lass that will deal with dwarves. <BR> <BR>To summarize: <BR>Catseye agate about 150hp cost 3gp <BR>Bloodstone about 275 hp cost 7gp <BR>Jasper about ?hp cost 1pp &#40;sorry to expensive to cast at my current level, I’ll let you know in the future&#41;. <!-/Text-!> <P>

They needs all the help they cin gets. Me uncle&#39;s highest symbol cost 12 plat each!!! So what me does is tells the group &#34;Do ye mind if me loots a few extra times ta keep our enchanter symboled?&#34; They always be saying yes so me loots more ta make up for the cost.  <BR> <BR>And nae be shy &#39;bouts gettin&#39; pasted over cause ya not getting any coins or glanders. Sometimes others be thinkin&#39; ya nae interested in them if ya just sit there all the time. Dont feel bad asking for a loot order of some type either. Its seem hard for those that dont med to see an unlooted corpse just sitting there on ther ground for very long. Sometimes they afraid someone not in yer group will come along and snatch it up. So just say yer thoughts when ya thinks they not being fair to ya. Another way to impose a semi-loot order is ta ask that everyone put split on. Then say &#40;if there are 6 people in your group&#41; that you will be looting a mob after ya see 5 splits.  <BR> <BR>Also if any of ya kin ever need a wee loan for them next circle of spells or ta gits that last bit needed fer some weapon or armor you cin ask me uncle fer a loan. Hes nae the richest cleric in the realm but he will help ya out, and me as well. <!-/Text-!> <P>

This of course is absolutely the best way to agro the entire crowd onto your self. And suddenly you are being torn to shreds unable to cast your healing spells and causing your group to break their focus on a single MOB and spread out their attacks in an effort to save your soft skinned hide. <BR> <BR>What is the single best way to deal with this situation? One word ENCHANTER, if you are grouped with an enchanter they will quickly mesmerize all the mobs that are not the focus of your groups attack. You must keep your wits about you at a time like this, don’t wield your dainty mace in a futile effort to beat your opponents into submission because of course this will break the mesmerization.  <BR> <BR>Now you can back off and find yourself a place to sit and heal as need be. Absolutely huge “we are all dead” pulls can be safely handled in this manner nothing is better then being in a group based around having a Cleric/Enchanter Combo. <BR> <BR>Why is there never an enchanter in the house when you need one? <BR> <BR>So what to do on all those occasions when you don’t have an enchanter? Four words: Poor Man’s Crowd Control. And compared to an enchanter I mean poor, very poor. Again back to our original scenario this time with no enchanter and you are about to do something massively suicidal, but not wishing to die quickly you choose the slow road to “LOADING PLEASE WAIT”. <BR> <BR>Start by casting root on as many mobs as manna and time permits yes this will agro them but healing does too, so in for a penny in for a pound. This will buy you time, usually far less time then you need but I did say “Poor Man’s” didn’t I? <BR> <BR>If you are in a very open area and you have the spell Atone &#40;34th lvl&#41; you can pull a MOB off outside agro range root it and then back out of agro range and Atone it. Atone wipes the MOB’s hate list, thus it has just forgotten all about you and your group. And being out side agro range it will go home once root wears off. Since this plan calls for lots of specific environmental factors just forget I ever mentioned it. You will almost never be in such ideal circumstances by the time you get this spell. <BR> <BR>Now back to our crowd in the Vision™, your party is pounding on one mob and doing well thanks to your timely heals but now your root spells are getting old &#40;10 seconds later&#41; and break. So you are now swarmed, start by doing nothing. That’s right nothing! It will be easier for your taunters to taunt a mob off if you are not making it madder at you by swinging at it. The one thing you can do to help yourself is to Yaulp, as this will boost your ac slightly. Also your group will notice you are yaulping and might just re-focus on saving your hide.  <BR> <BR>Don’t panic, just take the beating. This will buy your group the time to kill off the mobs, so what was once a crowd becomes a manageable pull. Now this is where we separate the dead clerics from the almost dead clerics, two words Divine Aura &#40;17 seconds of invulnerability&#41;. Do Not Leave Home With Out It! Always have this spell Mem’d!! And have a plan for using it. The normal plan is- RUN AWAY! But often that is not an option, auxiliary option to plan one RUN TO A NICE PLACE TO DIE SO YOU CAN RETRIEVE YOUR CORPSE EASIELY. <BR> <BR>Note that if you plan on the “run away” option, make sure you cast this spell with at least 2 bubbles of health, as we all know running very slowly to the zone is just a way of dying closer to the zone. Also if grouped with a wiz make sure that you have discussed in advanced when and how Evac will be used. Because you will not be Evac’d when this spell is up.  <BR> <BR>A better plan- When your beating gets too much to bear cast Divine Aura, and then start begging for your group to TAUNT THE FLIPPING MOBS OFF YOU! Now all this should have bought your group about 60 seconds of time this is usually enough time for the group to get things under minimal control or they are going to die any way. Got manna? Hit your gate spell what the heck, ever buy a lotto ticket you might win. <BR> <BR>To summarize, start by casting root&#40;s&#41; before casting your first heal. This is the first step in buying time. Second start Yaulping but not swinging once root breaks. Sure you are losing hp but the mobs are hopefully being killed off as well. Last use your Divine Aura, and either run or hold fast. Once its down and all is lost, cast gate and pray for the words “You Regain Your Concentration And Continue Casting”. <!-/Text-!> <P>

I&#39;d like ta point out a few tactics that me good ol&#39; uncle Badaf telled me.  <BR> <BR>In yer Vison, if thar be only 1-2 extra mobs on the puller, what me uncle does is first move a decent distance off from the group, then heal ASAP. This will cause them ta run at ya. Then ya root them there. Seems when ya root them mobs at the puller then says &#34;Git back! Thems rooted now!&#34; no one seems ta listen to ya. Guess cause yer words are often lost in they extictment and spam of battle. So you just end up wasting mana since the rooted mobs are still smackin the tar out of the puller. Also remember that rooting and no-damage stuns do not break mez.   <BR> <BR>Also if you gots an evac, always remember you can make yer DA spell end at any time you want. All ya do is click on the icon and it ends the spell. <BR> <BR>Atone. Sometimes this spell dont werk when ya cast it. But ya wont know it nae work from the message. Its always the same whether the mob forgot about ya or not, something like &#34;The mob calms down.&#34;.  As Pat pointed out it werks best in outdoor situations where ya gots a lot of room. If you are in this setting heres what ya do. Take the mob away from the group. Root &#39;em. Get back out of his normal agro range. Cast Atone. Then ya do a check to see ifun it werked. What ya do is move of to the left or right &#40;strafing is the best method&#41;. If the mob is still agroed he will turn toward you. If he keeps looking ahead hes forgot about ya. Sometimes you will know right away if he forgets cause he will turn away from ya as soon as it hits him. If he keeps facing ya cast it some again. Seafury cyclops is the place where me uncle used this spell ALOT. But also to some extent in Sol B as well. <!-/Text-!> <P>

At most levels &#40;maybe all, I’m only 35 so can’t say beyond&#41; clerics keep two healing spells mem’d, one Big and one small. &#40;In another post I will discuss the uses of each, here I just want to post about mana usage.&#41; <BR> <BR>A big heal costs about one bubble and a small heal costs about 1/4 of a bubble. Yes these amounts are not accurate for all levels and wisdom values. These are “round numbers” and I am rounding UP. At my current level I can cast greater healing and healing with one full bubble &#40;these are my current big and small heal&#41;. But let’s not quibble. <BR> <BR>When your cleric says half mana what this means is about 2 big heals and 2 small heals before you hear “00m med’n”. <BR> <BR>20 mana &#40;one bubble&#41; means about one big heal or several small heals. And 00m &#40;Out Of Mana&#41; means about 60 seconds of med’n for mana for a big heal. <BR> <BR>And FM &#40;Full Mana&#41; I won’t discuss because like the Loch Ness monster it doesn’t exist. <BR> <BR>So pullers keep this in mind before you go out on a hunt. <!-/Text-!> <P>

Not to sing my own praises but in all the poles the character class most preferred for grouping is the cleric. Conversely the most hated MOB is the cleric.  <BR> <BR>Nothing causes your group to complain more then beating a mob down to near death only to have its health go shooting back up well past the half way mark. Which is why when faced with multiple pulls the words “All on the healer” are the ones first spoken. And this includes you, my fellow cleric. <BR> <BR>Get your nose out of your spell book and report for battle cleric duty. If you are working an area where there are MOB clerics it is crucial you keep Holy Might &#40;lvl19 stun spell&#41; at the ready. And if possible Stun &#40;lvl 5&#41;. The stun line of spells are used to interrupt casters. <BR> <BR>It is crucial that the MOB cleric is prevented from healing and timing is crucial. Get your dainty mace out and position your self where you have a good view of the MOB Cleric’s hands. When you see the blue sparks begin to appear from its hands hit either of your stun spells. Your reaction time is crucial, healing’s cast time is about 3.75 and the casting time for Holy Might 2.0. By the time you see the blue sparks emanating and move your mouse over your spell gem you are probably already too late. Best thing to do is set up a hot-key, second best keep your mouse hovering over the stun spell gem. <BR> <BR>Now recovery time on Holy Might is 18 seconds, that’s why if possible you need Stun mem’d. Because a second heal is surely on the way, but my personal experience has been that keeping a second stun spell on hand is rare and difficult.  <BR> <BR>So Battle Cleric I tell you this, “Dead MOB’s don’t wear plaid- kill, Kill, KILL!” It didn’t cast heal the first time because it was feeling healthy, so during the duration of your stun, its time to open up with both barrels and hit it with any and every offensive spell you have. You have the duration of the stun and the 3.75 seconds it takes for it to cast heal for you to dispatch it, so that it won’t ever be casting heal again. <BR> <BR>Once dispatched you can again return to the quiet of your spell book and the healing of your group, battle cleric duty has ended. <BR> <BR>I will close by saying thank the lords that the game’s AI doesn’t apply this, or the highest-level cleric pc would be level 2! <!-/Text-!> <P>

My answer two words “train pulling”. To be sure I have been in aggressive groups before in which it was not uncommon to pull two at a time, but those battles were often hard fought and all to often would end up being touch and go affairs but… <BR> <BR>Our heroic pullers &#40;Carpaythian mostly&#41;, would go out and deliberately pull three or more mobs. Yes I said or more! I couldn’t tell you our record pull, but if some one spoke of seven mobs in one pull I would not question it. Now you would think that such pulls would leave the dear cleric mana desperate pulling hair from his head trying to med up for a lone heal before the grouped was wiped out. <BR> <BR>But no, not with the amazing Mez’ work provided by Kamelyon and the song twisting of Strings. I was seldom under a bubble of mana and indeed spent much mana nuk’ing mobs. In fact during one slow period when we were tankless, Pat even had a brief moment in which he tanked in order to provide a taunt for Carpaythian to back-stab from. <BR> <BR>There were zero deaths and we spent hours and hours at this. Never have I seen the like! <BR> <BR>My thanks to The Protectorate for having me along last eve. Truly wondrous! <BR> <BR>Patroclus Kuldmorndin &#40;Cleric&#41; <BR>Clan Axepeak <!-/Text-!> <P>

I have met many a frustrated enchanter who attempts to mez and then has folks beatin on all of the targets.  The intentional training sounds awesome though, just line um up an mow um down! har!  Makes um take a number!  -cackles- <BR> <BR>Strings is a old friend and a joy ta hunt wit too.  Sounds like magix and song were profitable ta ye then?
