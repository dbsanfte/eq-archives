<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Every dwarf in Clan Axepeak has the
opportunity to declare a Personal Enemy. Once a personal enemy is declared,
several changes must take place in the dwarf's behavior:</font></font>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>When the personal enemy is encountered
in battle, it will be attacked to the exclusion of all other enemies until
utterly destroyed.</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>The types of attacks against the personal
enemy will be, in order of preference, hand to hand attacks, missile attacks,
attacks through spells or other magic when no other attacks are possible.</font></font></li>
</ol>
<font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Upon declaring a personal enemy a dwarf
gains the title Hunter, with the name of the enemy preceding it. For example,
a dwarf that declares Ogres as a personal enemy would be known as Ogre
Hunter. Once the dwarf has completed certain requirements, he is then granted
the title of Slayer and can resume normal behavior.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>In order to gain the title of Slayer,
a dwarf must personally slay twenty of his enemy. He may travel and fight
with companions (this is in fact, recommended), but the twenty enemies
must be dealt the killing blow by the dwarf personally. The twenty enemies
need not be slain in a single battle.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>The dwarf must keep a log of his battles
while he strives for the title of Slayer. Every battle in which a dwarf
slays one of his enemies must be recorded faithfully in the log. Each log
entry should contain the date and exact location (area and location) of
the battle, who the dwarf was travelling with at the time, and how many
enemies were personally felled by the dwarf. The entry could be as simple
as "6/12/99, Butcherblocks, crossroads, Traveled with Felnar, Emmrald,
and Theldim. Killed Corflunk." The dwarf may choose to tell each log entry
as a story, but this is not required.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Upon applying for the title of slayer,
all relevant log entries must be submitted to the Clan Chief (Rorn Gor)
and Clan Sub-Chief (Dun Gor), who will review the application.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>For those enemies that have sub-categories
(Giants, Dragons, etc.), a dwarf may choose only one type as a personal
enemy, or may opt to choose all types. If all types are chosen, the dwarf
must slay at least one of each type. For example, if a dwarf chooses all
orcs as a personal enemy, a Pawn, Centurion, and legionnaire orc, (depending
on level) etc. must be included in the twenty orcs killed by the dwarf.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>If the dwarf dies during a battle,
no enemies killed during that battle count toward gaining the title of
Slayer.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Traditional dwarven enemies include
orcs, ogres, goblins, trolls, giants, kobolds, duergar, and drow. Any form
of undead can be added to this list as well, because they are just nae
natural. A dwarf may only choose one personal enemy or one group of personal
enemies at a time.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>The enemy must meet the following
guidelines:</font></font>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>It must be a dangerous enemy with the
potential of killing a small band of dwarves of more-or-less equal level.
(Assume a band of 3 dwarves.)</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>It must be able to be found somewhere
within the game.</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>A rationale must be provided for the
enemy; i.e. - some reason that your dwarf wishes to exterminate all monsters
of this variety.</font></font></li>
</ol>
