<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Of course, not all of your time will
be spent adventuring with your dwarf. You will find yourself, at times,
in an inn somewhere, taking a brief respite from your travels, kicking
back and relaxing. What then does a dwarf do when he isn't swinging his
axe?</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1><b><i>Drink</i></b> - Dwarves love
their ale, possibly more than life itself. A dwarf can down enough ale
to lay a dozen humans unconscious and still swing a weapon just as effectively.
Mead is almost as acceptable as ale. Wine is no better than water, and
is the drink of elves.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1><b><i>Smoke</i></b> - Smoking a pipe
is almost as satisfying as downing an ale, and it’s a rare dwarf that would
be found without one handy. Dwarves take exceptional pride in creating
images with the smoke from their pipes, and those truly skilled in the
art can create complex pictures with pipe smoke. Smoke rings are for humans
and other short-lived races. The exception are those dwarves who can not
only create smoke rings, but can get them to perform complex actions, such
as dancing or navigating their way around a room.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1><b><i>Tell Stories </i></b>- Few dwarves
can resist a good tale, and those dwarves that can tell a good story are
highly respected in their society. The best stories are those that relate
the actions of a great dwarven hero or heroine, thereby showing what a
superior race dwarves are.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1><b><i>Sing</i></b> - Dwarves love
a good song. Dwarven songs are always highly emotional, portraying anger,
sadness, battle lust, or some other powerful emotion. Few can hear a dwarven
song and not be moved by it.</font></font>
