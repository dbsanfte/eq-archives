<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>There are many things in the world
that dwarves find distasteful, or even downright horrific. Here is a short
list so you know what to frown at.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1><b><i>Magic</i></b>- Dwarves have
a strong distaste for, not to mention mistrust of, magic. While they have
been able to overcome this aversion to a small degree , they still prefer
the straightforward method of cutting something's legs off.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1><b><i>Water</i></b> - Dwarves are
leery of the sea, it being much more unpredictable than the living rock
they make their homes in. Hence, boat rides are an uncomfortable experience
for most dwarves. It is perhaps because of this that dwarves bathe somewhat
less frequently than most races. Water, of course, is never considered
an acceptable substitute for ale.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1><b><i>Wine</i></b> - No real dwarf
will ever drink wine. They consider it no better than sour grape juice,
which is actually preferable in most cases.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1><b><i>Forests</i></b> - Wooded areas
tend to confuse a dwarf's sense of direction. They have tremendous difficulty
telling one tree from another, and hence get lost easily in such places.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1><b><i>Being called "short"</i></b>
- Dwarves aren't short. Everyone else is gangly, and don't you forget it.</font></font>
