<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Back at the beginning of time,
deep within the Seven Heavens<br>
Moradin the Soulforger worked at the fires of the Eternal Forge<br>
Creating the races that would populate Faerun<br>
One day, while Moradin worked at the forge, creating<br>
the souls of the dwarven race a great giant came and challenged
the Soulforger<br>
Moradin turned from the souls in the Eternal Forge to face this
beldarakin<br>
A titanic battle erupted within the heavens.<br>
Thunder shook all of Toril as Moradin's hammer struck the foul
giant.<br>
Lightning flashed across the heavens as the giant's sword glanced
off Moradin's shield<br>
For many days the battle raged within the skies,<br>
and all the while the dwarven souls hardened in the fires of the
Eternal Forge.<br>
Blood from Moradin's wounds fell onto the dwarven souls,<br>
and so they were imbued with his spirit.<br>
Sweat from the Soulforger's brow also fell on the dwarves,<br>
and so they received his strength and perseverance.<br>
Finally, Moradin delivered a blow that felled the mighty giant,
ending the battle.<br>
Returning to his forge, he drew the souls of the dwarves from out
of the flames.<br>
Cooling them with his breath, he said...<br>
&quot;This race shall be most dear to me, for it has spent the
longest time in my forge,<br>
and has been tempered with my sweat and blood.&quot;<br>
With that, he cast the souls down from the heavens, and the
dwarven race was born.<br>
And so today we gather, to honor Moradin...<br>
And to prove that his blood runs strong in (name)'s veins.<br>
As Moradin the Soulforger granted the ethereal giant death up
above<br>
So shall (name) grant this giant...DEATH FROM BELOW!!!</font></p>
