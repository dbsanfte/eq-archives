<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>The relationship between dwarves and
elves is almost legendary. As such, it deserves its own section.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Much has been made about the hostility
between dwarves and elves. While there is certainly mistrust there, it
is not the open hatred that many think it to be. Dwarves do not at all
agree with the elven philosophy of life, and this leads to friction in
most dwarf-elf encounters. Elves are not nearly practical enough for dwarven
tastes, and their relaxed carefree approach to life tends to grate on dwarven
nerves. Still, they recognize that elves are allies in the war against
evil (which dwarves take very seriously), and will usually not seek an
armed conflict with them. This is even more unlikely considering that elven
homelands do not at all infringe on dwarven homelands. Without a territorial
dispute, the conflict is highly unlikely to erupt into open war.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>What is highly possible is for some
minor slight, or what might seem minor to any non-dwarf, to fester in a
dwarf for years, or even decades. A mere slip of an elven tongue could
be taken as a monumental insult by a dwarf, souring relations for ages
to come. While the elf will likely forget the incident relatively quickly,
the dwarf in question will turn it over and over in his mind until it becomes
a terrible insult aimed at him, his clan, and the dwarven race in general.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>On the brighter side, some of the
greatest friendships in history were made between dwarf and elf. Once each
gets beyond the issue of race, they find a personality that compliments
their own, and a bond is formed that may last for centuries. The Elf will
come to appreciate the single-minded thoroughness of his dwarven companion,
while the dwarf appreciates the lightening of spirit that his elven friend
inevitably brings. Together, there is little that an elf and a dwarf could
not face.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>In terms of the world, both elves
and dwarves are in the minority, and it would be a foolish dwarf that would
not recognize that. Being a thoroughly practical race, dwarves are not
about to take any action that would hand the world over to the humans,
and any extended dwarf-elf conflict would do just that. While elves are
not perfect by any means, they're better than the shortsighted rude humans
that are swarming everywhere thinking they own everything.</font></font>
