<title>Misadventures of Batal</title>

<p>Ok, I've got a little story for you.&nbsp; I was on quite a bit this weekend, and yes,
I am finding it takes noticeably longer to level the higher you go.&nbsp; Anyway, I was
introduced to the Sarnak Fort in LOIO this weekend. &nbsp; This is<br>
a&nbsp; great place to fight, but you have to be careful.&nbsp; We were finishing up a
bout with a group of Sarnaks and were winning, but we were all hurt.&nbsp; Then, Batal
decides:&nbsp; &quot;Hey, why not just fall backwards off the platform?&quot;&nbsp; So off
I fall now down to just over 1 red bub of life.&nbsp; Of course a Sarnak decides to chase
me.&nbsp; Well, I limp away just far enough to cast a gate and just barely finish the
cast.&nbsp; I think I'm being transported to safety, but I am wrong.&nbsp; Thanks to a
glitch, the Sarnak follows me through the gate!&nbsp; He clobbers me and I die for the
first time in 4 or 5 levels.&nbsp; I guess it had to happen sometime.&nbsp; It's funny
that it took a glitch to get me to die though.&nbsp; At least my body was a very short
distance from where I spawn!&nbsp; )<br>
<br>
Ok, cya all.&nbsp; Happy hunting!<br>
