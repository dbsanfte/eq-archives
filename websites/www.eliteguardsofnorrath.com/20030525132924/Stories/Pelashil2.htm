<p>I'm a level 12 paladin. Playing for about 2-3 months. I'm newer to my level.<br>
I'm getting bored w/Freeport and commons so I decide to go to Butcher.<br>
I contact a friend about how safe the passage would be for a lone character.<br>
He said, &quot;I've only heard of something jumping on the boat once,&quot; so I get<br>
on the boat without big issue and start my journey across the sea.<br>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br>
YOU HAVE ENTERED OCEAN OF TEARS<br>
Thoran shouts, &quot;Does someone want to take care of the Seafury at the end of<br>
the dock?&quot;<br>
.........Silence...........<br>
I think nothing of this, not knowing what a &quot;Seafury&quot; is. As the boat pulls<br>
up to the dock I get a quick lesson as the thing GETS ON THE BOAT!!!<br>
Thinking like a human...I figure it can't possibly see me through the masts,<br>
with only one eye, if I stay real still, when it keeps getting on and off.<br>
The boat pulls away and I don't see it any more. A Seafury Cyclops hits you<br>
for 36 points...<br>
I panic and figure I can swim to Sisters Island and wait for the next boat.<br>
I run, jump, hit the water...LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br>
Oddly enough it had the same thoughts and beat me to death.<br>
So I contact my friend.... he now knows of 2 times that something jumped on<br>
the boat. But wait, it gets better.<br>
He (being a 36 Enchanter) his roomy (a 34 druid) his other roomy (a 30<br>
something shaman) decide to look for the body in the ocean while I petition<br>
and re-gather myself for the next boat from Freeport. &lt;I believe the levels<br>
are right, but I don't know what spells are available at what levels. This<br>
makes a difference later.&gt; As the boat pulls in I get the message that they<br>
have found my body and drug it to the shore by the dock.<br>
I get to the island and think, &quot;Cool, I'll /corpse onto the boat and re-load<br>
enroute.&quot; Now you more seasoned players see the problem here. I, having<br>
never left Antonica, didn't know that you couldn't loot or cast on the boat.<br>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br>
No body as I entered Butcher. Enter /petition again. Walk around, look at<br>
things, see what's there...YOU HAVE BEEN SUMMONED BY THE GODS...<br>
Behold, I am standing at the dock, and by Jove, THERE I AM!! I start to loot<br>
myself.<br>
A pirate says, &quot;You are an affront blah, blah, blah.&quot;...LOADING, PLEASE<br>
WAIT...<br>
I contact my friend again. This time I have a Special Forces escort as all<br>
of them show up and help. We decide that I loot while they defend and then<br>
we will group Tp to Butcher. &lt;Remember I mentioned the spell thing...&gt; Well,<br>
this goes off splendidly. We go to Butcher and the next question out of my<br>
friend's mouth, &quot;So where do you want to go?&quot;<br>
My answer....&quot;FREEPORT!&quot; <br>
It took me 3 weeks to gain the courage to head over again. To make matters<br>
worse, during that trip I hear a Guide talking about some critter on Fury<br>
Island that has been, that's right, you guessed it, JUMPING ON THE BOAT<br>
KILLING PEOPLE!!<br>
I did make it through that time and I think I'll buy a Tp back when I go.<br>
