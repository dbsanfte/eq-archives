<p>Caster's realm has a great piece about things to come in the new and improved eq world.
It's a must read if you've grown accustomed to the present Norrath. Changes I found
particularly intresting were that until level 10, a toon who has met his demise will not
have to make the dreaded corpse run and the increase of the xp bonus in low level
dungeons. The no CR was intresting to me because I have a bard who started in qeynos and
it was easy to find her corpse. It was right at the feet of the guard who whacked me
because I didn't turn off chords of discordance when I ran for him to help ( yeah my whole
2 points of damage was enough to make him join Fippy in the bard beatdown). When I hit 5
or so and hit the hills, it was relatively easy to retrace my steps and remember how far
from the road I was. Plus the relatively high traffic of people chasing rabid grizzlies
and wisps made it a shorter wait when I bellowed the all too familiar &quot;Has anyone
seen my corpse.&quot;</p>

<p>My cleric was a different story. It was my first pc and as such was victim of my worst
decisions. It's like your first child. It's the practice baby (don't let your parents tell
you anything different. If you were the oldest, your siblings got the experienced parent
and you got the shaft) and I did things I swore I will never do again like start as a
blind as a bat erudite in the can't see the trees cause of all the trees in the way Toxx
forest. Dark lighting for night blind pc's, sparse landmarks and numbers of kobolds and
skeletons make cr's here a nighmare. Key in the fact that the only tanks here are the
magician's pet's (when was the last time you saw an erudite paladin?) and this is hands
down the worst newbie area in the game.</p>

<p>If you note the increase in xp for low level dungeons that will also come with the
patch, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to decode the message - you can play on Odus
too. And think this is true. Toxx still stinks yes but leveling from 7 to 14 in the
warrens I made enough plat in bronze weapons to get spells, a weapon and still have much
more in the bank than I would have in Blackburrow. As a caster I also learned soloing
through the art of the root and nuke or more often the root and run. The molar quest in
both Erudin and Paineel gave my cleric a full suit of ringmail effortlessly plus some to
sell and is good xp, gave me about a 1/4 blue each at 14. Granted, Kerra island still
doesn't &quot;do it&quot; for me either but I see ogres and dark elves making the trek
over with a druid or 2. I think the word is out. The new patch will make odus a decent
continent, not just the spawning point for eggheads waiting for a boat at level 1. </p>

<p>If you are choosing an intelligence caster erudites have to be mentioned in the made
for the job category. In the beginning the dark erudite's newbie garden is a candyland to
play in but now magicians and enchanters have no excuse to run to Qeynos since they will
no longer have to track down their gear with a fire beetle eye. I imagine pets make the
learning curve easier but I did things totally wrong and teamed up with a wizard for my
early days. Whatever it takes, stick it out til 4 or 5 cause relatively close to the
wizard spires in toxx are a couple of kobold camps a pair of 5's can own or can be soloed,
just ask someone at the spires to break the camp for you. 3 spawn at each, and you get the
added bonus of being surrounded by wandering mobs that won't get close enough to bother
you unless you want to and the shaman paw quest in the temple of divine light in Erudin
for goodies. If you haven't found a bag or box yet, you will here. </p>

<p>Between this camp and a skeleton or 2 you should be able to reach 7. Now you are ready
for the warren's, a dungeon off the newbie garden in paineel. Good erudites, don't be
afraid of the 2 skeletons mining in the shaft. Do be afraid of the abandoned heretic pet
though. As a side note these skellies can be soloed from about 9-11 so I imagine a couple
7's could do well here. No loot though. Zone, take a left and head straight down the
middle of the hall into the garden. Head to the back of the garden looking on your right
and find the stairs. At the bottom of the stairs on the left is the entrance to the
warrens. </p>

<p>A relatively good dungeon made more difficult by the lack of popularity and remoteness.
For a 5-30 dungeon, you'll find more 35 and up camping the named spawns than you will pc's
of your level. They're all in Blackburrow doing the train dodge and duck. I swear I was
level 10 before I found out there were better tanks than an necro's pet. Finding a
shadowknight in there is always a welcome sight, someone to taunt off the 3 light blues
that come when you pull a decent kobold but erudite SK's aren't as popular as the dark elf
varities and they can be hard to come by. </p>

<p>The most popular camp spot in this dungeon is right by the zone. This should tell you
something about this place. Adds are not only common in here, they are inevitable. At 7 it
will be difficult in here without a partner or at least a pet. They will run when they are
weak so chase with caution. On the other hand they will bring adds when they run so chase
you must. It's got easier at 9 when my partner and I got root. Casters will get great
practice on the root and nuke technique or sometimes the root and run. Til then, don't
chase too far and see what he brings back. </p>

<p>Also by nine you will have seen what makes these kobolds worth the effort. As a
paralell, I compare the Warrens to Blackburrow and find the rusty weapons there do not
compare to bronze yaris and rapiers found in the warrens. Gnoll teeth offer less xp than
kobold molars, quest items for Erudin and Paineel and when you complete the gnoll teeth
quest you get beer. For molars you get ringmail armor. I had a full suit and pieces to
sell by level 11 in the warrens. In BB all I ever got was flyers to AA meetings. Toss in
food for the faction challenged and the occasional &quot;Aw shucks. Any noob want a +9
strenghth shield?&quot; and it pays to stay on odus. </p>

<p>There are a few good spots to be camped in here. The jail cell comes to mind for 9 to
11 and there is a room near the prince's room that I've seen 2 groups share (uneasily). If
you care to head to the more popular King wing, just outside the throne room and outside
the pit fighter room are good spots to settle in although you will need at least 4 pc's to
feel comfortable. As an added bonus, killing here builds faction with both cities
simultaneaously and even good erudites can quickly get a key to paineel for easier selling
and banking. Turn in your molars in darkglow palace too, Erudin will still love you. </p>

<p>I would be remiss if I didn't mention the potential for trains in this place and I mean
ugly trains. I left at 17 and I was still seeing Kobolds come up I never even heard of but
the number and severity of the trains seemed to have dropped since the opening of
Stonebrunt Mountains. I must admit I have only briefly visited stonebrunt but I would have
loved to give it a whirl had there been someone there for me to heal. </p>

<p>So of all the changes to be implemented with the new patch Odus will have a not so
steep learning curve for newbies and better xp to go along with the great money in the
warrens. All that will be missing is you. </p>
