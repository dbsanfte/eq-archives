    <td width="684" height="2%" valign="top"><font color="#84BDD1">Rules?!&nbsp; We don't need
    no stinking rules!<br>
    <br>
    Well, ok, if we must have rules, here are some pretty good ones that have<br>
    served us well.<br>
    <br>
    1) Above all, NO SWEARING IN GUILD CHAT!&nbsp; We are a pretty laid back group, but we are
    also very diverse people from very different backgrounds.&nbsp; What may not offend you
    may offend someone else.&nbsp; Please keep an eye on this.<br>
    <br>
    2) On a related topic, you are expected to be respectful of those both in the guild and
    those outside the guild.&nbsp; Ninja looting, intentional training, etc does not paint our
    guild in a positive light and cannot be allowed.&nbsp; Be fair in your dealings with
    groups and avoid offensive language with all.<br>
    <br>
    3) Offer assistance when you can.&nbsp; We are a pretty helpful group and it is my goal to
    make us ever more so.&nbsp; To that end, if you are porting somewhere, give someone a free
    lift.&nbsp; Heal someone in passing if you can and they need it.&nbsp; Offer buffs if you
    can spare the time and mana.&nbsp; It only serves to make the game better for everyone and
    spread our name.&nbsp; Who knows when you will need a favor in the future?<br>
    <br>
    4) Our guild has a lower level limit.&nbsp; We do not admit first time members under level
    10 in most cases.&nbsp; It is a pretty low level limit and those familiar with the game or
    games of this type can meet it quickly.&nbsp; The intent is simply to require a minimum
    level of familiarity with the game prior to admitting folks into the guild.
    &nbsp; Alternates of current members are allowed in at any level.<br>
    <br>
    5) Officers are required to offer assistance to members of the guild whenever possible and
    feasible.&nbsp; The officers are there to take care of issues and problems as they arise
    as well as to promote the guild and perform duties like planning raids.&nbsp; If an
    officer cannot assist you right away with your issue, be assured that they will try to
    find someone who can or will plan a time that the issue can be resolved.<br>
    <br>
    6) New members are invited on a probationary basis.&nbsp; Just as you may want to get to
    know us, we want to get to know you.&nbsp; If you find that we are not a good fit for you,
    good luck in your travels.&nbsp; We do reserve the right to make the same decision
    (however rarely&nbsp; =)&nbsp; ).<br>
    <br>
    That's pretty much it.&nbsp; We do not have class or skill limitations.&nbsp; Anyone who
    wants to relax and have a good time is welcome.&nbsp; We encourage new members and the
    recruiting of friends and group-mates that you meet along the way to join us in our
    activities and to come play with us.&nbsp; We have ever increasing resources for you to
    draw on and you should feel free to do so.&nbsp; So if you are new to our guild, WELCOME!
    &nbsp; If you are considering joining us, give it a shot!&nbsp; We're a pretty fun bunch.<small><br>
    <br>
    </small>See you around Norrath!<br>
