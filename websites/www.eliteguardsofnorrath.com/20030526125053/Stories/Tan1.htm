<p>Tanvarien has decided to join Statia and Ellisen in the Warsliks Woods.&nbsp; Tired of
fighting in Lake of Ill Omen he casts camo and sets out across the Frontier
Mountains.&nbsp; Though some of the giants can see through camo he makes it through the
zone with no problems.&nbsp; The next leg of the trip is to go through Overthere to reach
Warsliks Woods.&nbsp; Being his first time through the zone and without a map Statia has
kindly given him some instructions on how to get there and the LOC of the zone.&nbsp;
Feeling confident (overly so) he pretty much ignores the instructions part and begins to
make his way to the LOC.&nbsp; For those that don't know, about dead center of the zone is
a large canyon.&nbsp; When Tanvarien crested a hill he slowed and looked around.&nbsp; It
was night and though he has infravision it is still hard to see.&nbsp; Being able to make
out some land just beyond he begins onward again thinking that the land just makes a
slight drop to the next section of land.&nbsp; Next thing you know a cliff is rushing by
him for what seems like 2 or 3 minutes.&nbsp; When the falling stops the message you have
fallen for 10,000 points of damage, you have fallen to your death appears.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Morgraine came to the rescue and levitated him to the canyon floor, where he retrieved his
corpse and was tp'd away before the Scorpiki could get him.&nbsp; If only this was the
last stupid thing that Tanvarien would do.</p>
