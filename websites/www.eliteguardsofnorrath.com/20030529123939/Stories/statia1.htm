<p>&quot;The trail leads to that farmhouse&quot; Tanvarien whispered. In the distance a
barn and the house sat at the bottom of the mountains. Plumes of smoke arose from the
chimney and the smell of a hearty blew by on the autumn breeze. They had been traveling in
the plains for days searching for traces of the Karana Bandits. Reports of raiders in the
outland, pillaging travelers and pilfering whatever meager loot could be pried from the
hands of their dead victims had drifted to the Qeynos Hills, reports brought by ragged,
weary journeyman who had been chased to the edges of civilization. They had come to these
lands to end the threat and to bring justice to the outlaws.</p>

<p>The half-elf reached to the ground and let a bit of earth crumble through his fingers
into the wind. &quot; These tracks lead to the barn, 'bout a couple hours old. They're
probably still around. Keep your ears open, people&quot;. Statia squeezed the hilt of her
blade, comforted by the feeling of protection it offered her. She tried to swallow the
fear climbing in her throat and chased it by humming a little lullaby she often used to
lull herself to sleep at night. She and her party, Tanvarien the Ranger, Tigereye a Rogue,
and her best friend Ellisen a Shaman from the northlands had come a long way together but
this journey would be over soon.</p>

<p>The time had come. Ellisen began to cast blessing upon the party from the spirits about
and Statia sang an ancient war ballad, stoking the flames of battle within them. Tan stood
fast and scanned the farm like an eagle, searching for more signs of life while Tigereye
slunk into the shadow of the dusk and waited. </p>

<p>&quot;Who pulls&quot; asked Ellisen. Statia often thought Ellisen's comforting,
motherly tone was ironiccally given to such an imposing figure. Standing two full heads
above her in height, she had heard how effectively her tone could switch from kindly
healer to intimidating enforcer. Statia hopped up and quickly rehearsed her role in her
head. Attract attention but not to much. Pick a fight but too long. runaway but not too
fast. It was a tightrope she walked often. Sometimes it even worked! Entertainer by day,
bait by night. twas her lot in life. &quot;Well&quot; she thought to herself. &quot; Would
I really want it any other way?&quot; </p>

<p>She approached the house from the north while her comrades lay behind waiting in
ambush. From the corner of her eye she saw movement, just off to her left. She turned
slowly so as not to draw attention to herself and studied the farmer leaving the barn and
heading toward the cellar. Barefoot and carrying only a pitchfork, he was obviously not
expecting visitors. She laughed inwardly at her fortune and mentally cataloged a note to
leave a donation at the next church she passed.</p>

<p>It came without warning. The wind rose suddenly, sweeping her off of the ground and
into the air. She fell and landed hard upon the brush, forcing the wind from her lungs.
She clambered to her feet and again perused the landscape. The farmer rushed toward her,
pitchfork in hand and an armored figure emerged from the house. She had been spotted! </p>

<p>Mumblings drifted through the night and into her ears. She spun quickly, in time to see
the figure on the rooftop raise her hands. The bard cried out in pain as fire singed her
skin. It quickly began to blister under the intense heat. The armored figure was closing
the distance between he and her with great strides. Instinctively, she evaded the farmers
attack and swung blindly to create separation. As her battle senses kicked in, she
evaluated the situation. Out numbered and in the open, she was a sitting duck. &quot;GET
IT TOGETHER!&quot; her mind screamed. She feigned an attack at the farmer who fell back
defensively. She seized the moment to turn and ran toward safety singing her battle song
all the way. </p>

<p>Tanvarien arose from the underbrush and let loose a volley of arrows. The sound of the
shafts whizzing past Statia quickly changed to yelps of pain. She knew the ranger had
found his mark. Cool magicks washed over her and her blistered skin began to heal at an
exponential rate. She made a note to thank Ellisen for her assistance but not now. Now she
had to tip the battle into their favor. As the caster on the rooftop prepared another
spell, Statia shrieked at the top of her lungs. The bandit clasped her ears in pain. In
midstride, she sheathed her sword and pulled out her drum and began playing a rapid rhythm
and her feet picked up speed. She glanced over her shoulder to ensure she was still being
pursued. The farmer dove at Tanvarien attempting to grapple the light elf but he deftly
sidestepped the attack. He replaced his bow with cold steel and took a readied stance for
his prey to arise. Ellisen began to chant and a noxious cloud engulfed the warrior. He
coughed but quickly overcame the poison gas and continued after Statia. She chuckled to
herself at the idea of him catching up to her. Many had tried....</p>

<p>A shiver traveled her spine as she realized she had lost track of the spell slinger.
She took a wide arch and began to turn back toward the battle. Suddenly the brush grew
wild before her eyes. A green tentacle reached out for her ankle. She hurdled the vine - a
vine in the plains?- with catlike grace. A root sprang up and grasped her ankle, pulling
her to the ground. She gave a mighty tug to free herself. She almost tore her leg from the
hip but was held fast. Flames washed over her and she could do nothing but cry out in
anguish. Again she was enveloped. It was excruciating. The bandit, now down from the
rooftop approached her at a leisurely pace, confident that time was on her side. Statia
shrieked again and the druid flinched but continued toward her with a gleam in her eye.
The bard was weakened and powerless, the foe out of the reach of her blade. She thought of
her shurikens but knew they could not save her. The bandit raised her hands and began an
incantation and Statia shut her eyes. </p>

<p>The casting was ended abruptly. Statia peered through squinted eyes at her enemy. Blood
began to spill from the bandit&#146;s mouth and chest. A look of shock was upon her face
and her arms flailed wildly at at the empty air before her. A dark blade came over the
druid's shoulder across her throat and the bandit was no more. As the body fell backward,
lifeless Tigereye nonchalantly let it hit the ground to lie in the brush</p>

<p>&quot;What took you so long?&quot; Statia asked wearily. Tigereye only winked and
helped her to her feet, gingerly. Statia was covered with bright red blotches where her
skin remained. &quot;I'll be okay&quot; she said as she brushed him away with a weak wave
&quot;Help the others.&quot; </p>

<p>Tigereye turned and surveyed the scene. &quot;Help them what?&quot; he answered. Statia
lifted her head in time to see Tanvarien lay into the bandit with an almost artistic slash
across his torso while Ellisen dropped a helpless farmer onto her knee. &quot;My god&quot;
she wondered &quot;what do they feed those barbarians?&quot; Tigereye munched on bit of
biscuit and strolled back to the battle to supervise the clean up.</p>

<p>The brisk evening air chilled as the night approached, a reminder of winter's approach.
The party gathered by the barn and set up camp for the night. Statia looked up at the
blaze and the characters that surrounded it. Tigereye explained to Ellisen why her meal
would have been better if she had added the bear meat he carried while Ellisen explained
back why she was going to kick him in the neck if he said another word. </p>

<p>Tanvarien stared into the night intently with a free ear locked onto the sounds of the
night. He had been silent since he warned her mandolin practice was attracting bears
looking to mate and that she should save it for another time. Sometimes he reminded Statia
of a statue, more of a monument really, so stoic, as hard as his jawline. It was a look he
wore well she thought to herself. </p>

<p>Like a sudden end to a dream, the word she had been searching for came to her, a word
for the feeling of comfort and trust she had been enjoying for some time now. It was
called belonging. She lowered her head and went back to journaling the day&#146;s events,
a short tale in the story to be told. </p>
