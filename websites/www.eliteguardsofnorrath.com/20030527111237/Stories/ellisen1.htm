<p>In my youth I had wondered what I would do with my life. Life in Halas was very good to
me I was sheltered from the outside world. One day I decided that it was time to start
making a living, of course I had alot of support my friend Cindl had offered to teach me
tailoring in hopes that I might make things for her and her husband to sell in their
store. Mr. McDonald offered to teach me of pottery and alchol making, and Cappi offered to
teach me to cook, all of these would have been very good ways of making a living and I did
learn a little cooking and tailoring. I realized that I wanted to see the outside world
outside of Halas, watching and listening to those who traveled through with their great
stories of their travels and the creatures they encountered in far away lands made me
realize that this is what i wanted to do with my life. I went to the High Preistess Margyn
in the church of the Tribunal to see if she could help me, after speaking with her she
told me that the best way to help others and also the safest way for me to go about my
adventuring would be to learn the ways of the shaman. I was handed my two spells and sent
to train with Waltor Felligan who helped me with weapons use and in useing my spells.
After many hours of training I felt I was ready of course I would have to continue to use
my skills to improve but I was ready to leave the Tribunal and Halas. I said my goodbyes
and promised to visit often then made my way toward the lake that I had often swam across
to wait for the raft. That first step on the raft was very frighting for I knew it would
take me to a new and strange land. As it began to snow I watched as my home slowly became
smaller as I reached the other side of the lake....</p>

<p>My first adventures were with some very big spiders, wolf, and polar bears. Everfrost
was a very different place from Halas, animals and creatures roamed this land with the
occasional skeltons of the dead rising up and fighting back. I would often meet very nice
people and we would fight together making sure that the other wasn&#146;t harmed too much
during the battle.</p>

<p>I would often stop fighting and help tend to the wounded, this was something I enjoyed
very much.</font></p>
