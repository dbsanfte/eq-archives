<title>Misadventures of Batal (2)</title>
</head>

<body>

<p>Once there was an aspiring druid named Batal.&nbsp; He had lofty goals one day of<br>
passing from level 24 to level 25.&nbsp; This did not seem that difficult a task.<br>
Little did he know ...<br>
<br>
Batal was in a group fighting near the skellie fort in LOIO.&nbsp; Things were<br>
going well and eventually he dinged 25.&nbsp; Batal dings the first time.&nbsp; The<br>
obligatory congrats were then showered upon him, but it was not too last.<br>
Not long after this, our heroin, Ellisen, sent a tel to Batal asking him to<br>
come to FV to see her.&nbsp; Since his group had now disbanded, this was no<br>
problem ... or so he thought.&nbsp; Batal has made the run from LOIO to FV along<br>
the stream a number of times without incident.&nbsp; It was not to be this time.<br>
As wolf form is faster than SoW, Batal took the form of a wolf and camo'd<br>
for fear of his life.&nbsp; When he got to the bridge to meet Ellisen, he dropped<br>
camo and was promptly killed by the guard.&nbsp; What a nice guard.&nbsp; Killing a<br>
poor little innocent wolfy.<br>
<br>
Batal finds this amusing because he had earned enough exp to cover him<br>
incase he should die ... once.&nbsp; One death did not delevel Batal.&nbsp; So he<br>
tries again.&nbsp; Being bound in the mill in LOIO, he retraces his steps, but<br>
this time forgoes the speed plus and simply uses SoW.&nbsp; Batal was shortly<br>
introduced to some sort of mage npc; I can't remember his name.&nbsp; This npc<br>
apparently sees through camo.&nbsp; Batal ran for his life and made it to the<br>
bridge.&nbsp; He was killed right next to his old corpse right in front of the<br>
same guard who killed him before.&nbsp; It seems that this guard did not see fit<br>
to save Batal from the conjured goblin chasing him down.&nbsp; This caused Batal<br>
to delevel and he was not happy.&nbsp; Ellisen kindly dragged the original body<br>
to the zone edge and the meeting took place and he was made an officer.<br>
<br>
This gave Batal renewed ambition.&nbsp; He killed and slaughtered and plundered<br>
to regain 25.&nbsp; Yay Batal!&nbsp; It was actually rather funny.&nbsp; He was killing<br>
goblins when more and more kept agro'ing him.&nbsp; It was never more than 2 at a<br>
time for really only about 4 gobs, but it seemed like more.&nbsp; When the third<br>
was almost dead and the fourth had just arrived, Batal was not feeling well<br>
and was very low on mana.&nbsp; For those who don't know, Batal is very stubborn<br>
and the death of the third goblin would return him to 25.&nbsp; Rather than run<br>
to the zone, he decides to run the gobs in circles until he gets enough mana<br>
for his DoT.&nbsp; It's good for lower mana damage.&nbsp; The funniest part is that<br>
the weakened gob never gave up chasing Batal in circles, even until he died!<br>
So Batal dings the second time.<br>
<br>
Next Batal Tp'd to EF to collect bear pelts for tailoring.&nbsp; Being a nice<br>
boy, but a little slow, Batal runs right by another guard as a wolf.&nbsp; Once<br>
again, this guard gives chase and promptly flattens Batal.&nbsp; Not knowing the<br>
zone, he shouts out for help finding his body.&nbsp; Many people respond, but one<br>
stands by his body and waits for him to arrive.&nbsp; It is a random character<br>
that Batal had not met.&nbsp; How surprised he was to find out that it was an alt<br>
of Closhi's!&nbsp; He kindly thanked her and all for there help, collected his<br>
pelts, and returned to LOIO.<br>
<br>
Finally Batal sticks to basics and kills and plunders again being extra<br>
cautious.&nbsp; He dings 25 for the third time and promptly logs off before<br>
anything can happen!<br>
<br>
The moral of the story is &quot;You can't keep a good Batal down&quot;.&nbsp; Hmmm, that<br>
doesn't sound quite right.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; Where is he now?&nbsp; Batal dinged 26
last<br>
night and has put all of his 25 troubles behind him ... at least until he<br>
delevels again!&nbsp; :P<br>
