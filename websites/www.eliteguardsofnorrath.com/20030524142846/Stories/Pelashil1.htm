<p>What's a Faydedar?<br>
<br>
&quot;Come.please. I would love having you there. And you would be considered MY guest. No
one will argue with<br>
me since we go to destroy his abomination at my request.&quot; Ashambalon Throad, a
well-seasoned Priest of<br>
Nature and member of the brotherhood called Jade Dragon said.&nbsp; &quot;All right. I'll
be there. When and where?&quot; asked the<br>
young paladin of Marr. He had never seen a dragon before and thought it would do him good
to see well-experienced <br>
people battling a Greater Wurm.&nbsp; &quot;This coming Sunday at Sunset. You will need to
go to the island in the Timorous Deep <br>
that has 2 islands.&nbsp; There will be an Inn there. We will meet there. Good travels to
you my friend.&quot;&nbsp; Ashambalon called <br>
upon the spirits and the speed of the wolf blessed Pelashil.&nbsp; He ran off to the city
of Freeport where he would rest for the <br>
night and contemplate the battle to come.<br>
<br>
3 days later, at the designated time Pelashil was walking to the bank in Firiona Vie where
he had just<br>
rid the Lake of Ill Omen of Sarnak skeletons.&nbsp; He was thinking of the journey he was
about to partake to the<br>
island in the ocean to the north.&nbsp; As he though he heard the faint whisperings of a
spellbinder he was<br>
well acquainted with. Soulfrost's voice grew and his presence was felt in the mind of
Pelashil as he walked<br>
through the Dwarven city streets.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hay Bud. How hangs it?&quot; Soulfrost said in his own peculiar dialect.
&nbsp; &quot;I am good. I'm just finishing Lake and I am about to<br>
head out,&quot; was Pelashil's response.&nbsp; &quot;One suggestion before you head out.
Drop all your things in the bank. I can't promise <br>
you'll get a res from people here. JD would take precedence and it cost's quite a
bit.&quot;<br>
&quot;Understood. I figure it will be kind of fun just to see. I 'm inexperienced enough
that it shouldn't hurt<br>
a lot in death,&quot; Pelashil reasoned with his age long friend.&nbsp; &quot;The Maidens
Voyage is about to leave the docks and<br>
make it's journey. Please come aboard all that are going aboard!&quot; shouted the Dock
master for the city.<br>
&quot;I need to head out. I'll speak more with you as I get closer to the island.&quot;
Pelashil told his friend'<br>
&quot;Kk. Bye&quot; was the response, and the presence faded.&nbsp; What an odd man
thought Pelashil as he got onto the<br>
boat no longer feeling the weight of his armor and carrying only a Fer'Esh he had gotten
off of a<br>
skeleton's body and food for 3 days. Then again, he thought, High Elves do have a
different kind of air<br>
about them.&nbsp; The boat pushed away from the dock and Pelashil lay down to rest for the
long journey ahead.<br>
<br>
He awoke after a short nap to find that he was close to the first port of embarkation in
the area of the<br>
ocean known as Timorous Deep.&nbsp; The voice of his friend came back to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hay Bud. Where are you now?&quot; Soulfrost queried.&nbsp; &quot; I have just gotten
off the boat and I am looking for<br>
direction to the island.&quot; Pelashil responded.&nbsp; Soulfrost guided his friend by
direction ad distance.<br>
As he swam Pelashil felt his arms and body fatigue but he knew that his ability for
traveling in the water<br>
was improving. By the time he came to the island he felt that he had improved his style
and endurance by<br>
almost 4 fold if not more.&nbsp; He swam on the surface. He swam through tunnels. Finally
he appeared breaking the<br>
surface of the water and seeing several seasoned and senior combatants, spell binders, and
healers<br>
preparing for the coming battle.<br>
<br>
Soulfrost, a Dwarven warrior and a fellow warrior of the nature priests that he knew well
all met with him<br>
as he arrived. Xerx, the Dwarf, roughly hugged him for it had been a long time since they
had seen each other<br>
or raised arms together. Tegasie called upon the spirit of the planet itself to help
protect Pelashil<br>
during the coming battle. Soulfrost shaded Pelashil's image and made him appear to fade.<br>
<br>
&quot;The best place for you will probably be up by the Inn over the water. I will see you
again after the battle,<br>
my friend,&quot; and with that Soulfrost turned his attention to the people who had been
assigned to his<br>
care.<br>
<br>
Pelashil went up to the door to the Inn and looked into the deep blue water below.
&nbsp; Voices echoed and<br>
rang off of the walls of the deep crater that was the island.&nbsp; &quot;He will come out
of the water and the warrior will be<br>
sitting on the beach and will get the main attention of the beast!&quot; echoed the voice
of the person who<br>
acted as the guide to the expedition.&nbsp; Ashambalon's voice boomed throughout the
oceans.<br>
&quot;Making hand in!&quot;&nbsp; As the echo died, Pelashil thought, &quot;If the
creature is coming out of the water...&quot; as he looked into the<br>
deep blue seas again.<br>
<br>
Time froze for a split second. The clouds stopped moving, the sun stopped shining, the
cool ocean breeze<br>
stopped blowing.&nbsp; Pain wracked the holy warrior's body. Claws slashed down and
rendered him from head to toe. The great<br>
lizard stuck him once.twice.three.four times. Unable to endure the pain and agony the man
who had stood for<br>
all that Mithanial Marr had taught to the people collapsed in a bloody heap on the walkway
where he had<br>
stood mere seconds earlier.<br>
<br>
As his life faded he heard the voice of the Holy One say to him, &quot;Behold, you serve
me well. I have need of<br>
you yet. Lo, a time shall come when I will call upon you and you shall come home, but your
duty is not done<br>
yet.&quot;<br>
<br>
He woke on the ground in front of the bank in Firiona Vie where he had last been. He
looked around and began<br>
to see people he had just met.spell binders, healers, warriors.all appearing around him.
As he sat he heard<br>
the voice of the Nature Knight in his mind.&nbsp; &quot;Did you die too?&quot; Tegasie
asked.<br>
&quot;I was the first.&quot; Responded the hapless man.&nbsp; &quot;I think we wiped
out,&quot; said Soulfrost.<br>
&quot;I think I'm going to rest. I had nothing of importance that I would need to retrieve
from the<br>
shell that is there.&nbsp; Good night, my friend, and thank you for letting me
attend.&quot;<br>
&quot;I will let Ashambalon know. Have a good rest.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pelashil sat thinking about what he had just witnessed, and fell into a deep sleep.<br>
When he awoke, he found his friend Soulfrost again and spoke with him.&nbsp; He found that
the story did not end<br>
with the destruction of all involved with the Wurm. The beast known as Faydedar had
destroyed those who<br>
tried to kill him went to the island of the spirocs and killed the people who were riding
the island of<br>
that menace, and then went to the boat that was sailing through the waterways and
slaughtered the<br>
occupants. After rampaging the Timorous Deep for well over 30 minutes he decided that he
was finished<br>
leveling his vengeance on all who dared to enter the area, and left.<br>
<br>
Pelashil smiled inwardly. &quot;Someday, my friend.someday I will exact my revenge.&quot;</p>
