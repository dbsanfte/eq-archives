      FAQ</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><font size="3">This FAQ is very small and can only
      grow with your questions and answers. So please, post your questions and
      those with answers, post them! I'll add questions and their answers as I
      see them posted or I receive them in </font><a href="mailto:szehnder@odysseytn.net"><font face="Arial" size="3">email</font></a><font face="Arial" size="3">.
      Thanks for your continuing support to make this the best one stop shop for
      Research on the web.</font></font></p>
      <hr>
      <p><font face="Arial"><font size="3"><strong>How do I get started with
      research at all?</strong></font><font size="4"><strong> &nbsp;</strong></font></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">If your character belongs to a researching
      class (MAG WIZ NEC ENC :) you will at first need to buy the specific tome
      for your class (see this FAQ :). This Tome acts like a container. All you
      need to do is put the spell ingredients in there, hit combine and you have
      a new spell (or not :). However, there are a few minor details you need to
      know. Read the whole FAQ for the best start :)</font></p>
      <p><strong><font face="Arial">What's the deal with research at level 16?
      It only allowed me to put ONE practice into the Research skill when I made
      level 16! How can I improve this skill?</font></strong></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Sorry, folks, but at level 16 through level 18 you
      are only allowed that ONE practice. Something to do with that spell
      circle. But never fear! Once you break level 19 you can put 4 or 5 in
      there (depending upon your magic class), then once at 20, the skies the
      limit, and then at each level thereafter.</font></p>
      <p><strong><font face="Arial">What do I combine my stuff into to create
      the spell?</font></strong></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Wizards use a Lexicon, Mages use Elemental Grimoire,
      Enchanters use Tome of Endless Enchantments, and Necros use Book of Dark
      Bindings.</font></p>
      <p><strong><font face="Arial">What languages are the Wizard recipe books
      in?</font></strong></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Wizards Canon - Old Erudian<br>
      Wizards Doctrine - Combine Tongue (giant)<br>
      Ipsor's En. IIV - Dragon<br>
      Ipsor's En. IV - Elder Dragon</font></p>
      <p><strong><font face="Arial">Where can I find all these runes, words, and
      pages?</font></strong></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">It's all random. You must attack critters level 16+
      and on occasion they will be carrying your research item. There generally
      is not a SPECIFIC creature to hunt for a SPECIFIC item.</font></p>
      <p><strong><font face="Arial">Is the quill and parchment needed to create
      a spell?</font></strong></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">No! It must NOT be included or the creation will
      fail.&nbsp; These items are used with the <a href="concordance.html">Concordance</a>
      (practice research)</font></p>
      <p><strong><font face="Arial">Can I research any spell at any level?</font></strong></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">With EXTREMELY limited success. I would suggest just
      sticking to your own level or below.</font></p>
      <p><strong><font face="Arial">Do I have to know a particular language to
      research a spell?</font></strong></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">The answer is yes and no. If you want to read the
      research recipe book, yes (although all are posted on this site). However,
      language is not factored into success or failure when using the research
      skill.</font></p>
      <p><strong><font face="Arial">Who uses which ingredients?</font></strong></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Wizards use Runes, Necros use Words, Enchanters use
      pages from various grimoires, writs or tomes. Mages use a combination of
      Words and other <a href="components.html">special items</a>.</font></p>
      <p><strong><font face="Arial">Where can I find the recipes in game?</font></strong></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">For each class the first research books up to about
      level 29 spells are sold on vendors.</font></p>
      <p><strong><font face="Arial">I cannot train a language I need to read a
      research book. How do I get the proper language?</font></strong></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">You get a wider selection of languages to learn as
      you advance in level.&nbsp; Or learn the language by having a person who
      already know it spam you to death (in tells).</font></p>
      <p><strong><font face="Arial">How do I know which book is written in what
      language?</font></strong></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">There is a book in the game called <a href="languages.html">&quot;On
      languages&quot;</a>. It gives a rough picture about the languages needed.
      The translation of the book is posted on this website.</font></p>
      <p><strong><font face="Arial">Where can I find the Gloves of Rallos Zek?</font></strong></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">On evil eyes in the East Karana and in the Gorge and
      got a report someone found one in High Hold Keep.</font></p>
      <p><strong><font face="Arial">Do I have to research my level 16 and 20 pet
      spells for magicians already?</font></strong></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">No, they can be bought off a vendor on an Island in
      the Ocean of Tears. Not sure about levels above 20...</font></p>
      <p><strong><font face="Arial">Should I research my spells that are
      available for purchase also? Is it cheaper?</font></strong></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Depending on the ingredients and how many you have
      at your disposal it is usually A LOT cheaper to BUY your spells.</font></p>
      <p><strong><font face="Arial">Which is the fastest way to learn a
      language?</font></strong></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Group up with the person teaching. Have him create a
      5 line of text hotbutton and then spam the groupchat. Depending on his
      connection and clicking skill a language can be learned from awful to
      excellent in only 5 minutes.</font></p>
      <p><strong><font face="Arial">I have been taught a language (using the
      above method), but it still says I am awful in it. Why?</font></strong></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Yet another bug. You have to zone or log out to make
      the changes go into effect.</font></p>
