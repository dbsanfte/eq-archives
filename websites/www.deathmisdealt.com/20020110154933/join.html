            Recruit posts on the DM public recruit board that he is interested

            MUST post on the same public recruit board that he will sponsor the 
            person. If this is not done, the person will not be pledge tagged. 
            Only permanent DM members may sponsor a pledge. </font></li>

            is PLEDGE TAGGED. This recruit will not have access to the private 
            boards. They will need to contact guild members and their sponsor 
            to keep up with raids and groups. The Pledge Tagged Recruit is not 
            eligible for loot, unless not needed by a present DM Perm or Prob 
            Member. This pledge period will last for 2 wks.</font></li>
          <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Pledge 
            Tagged Recruit is voted on: This will be an OPEN vote, with majority 
            rules. However Pledge will need at least 75% of yes votes to win. 
            Voting will only be a 2day period and will be done on MONDAYS as well.</font></li>

            They will be allowed to loot on GUILD Raids with the exception of 
            EPIC peices needed by Permanent DM members. At the end of this 30 
            day period, the officers will give a yes or no vote based on GUILD 
            opinion of the pledge. Then pledge will be promoted to Permanent Member.</font></li>

            This was done to help ease the hurtful feelings of &quot;New&quot; 
            people getting loot before people who have been in the guild. Of course 
            more than likely there will always be exceptions, which if all present 
            will need to agree on.</font></p>
