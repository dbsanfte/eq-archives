        <h1>Rules of Conduct</h1>
        <h1>&nbsp;</h1>
      </div>
      <div align="left">
        <p>Above all else, treat others as you wish to be treated. This applies 
          to your guildmates, as well as the other residents of Norrath. Rudeness 
          and abusive behavior will not be tolerated.</p>
        <p>Be sensitive to others feelings. Please be considerate when talking 
          about things that could be considered offensive to others (racial remarks, 
          sexual remarks, drugs, objectionable language, etc.) on guildchat, any 
          public channel or on the message boards.</p>
      </div>
      <div align="left">
        <p>Kill stealing, training and ninja looting will not be tolerated.</p>
        <p>Making derogatory comments about other players or guilds on either 
          guildchat or public channels is not acceptable.</p>
      </div>
      <div align="left">
        <p>Arguing on public channels is not acceptable. If you have a disagreement 
          with another player, take it to /tells.</p>
        
      </div>
      <div align="left">
<p>Cheating and underhanded trade practices will not be tolerated. Death 
          Misdealt has an enviable reputation on SolusekRo. Your job as a guild 
          member is to uphold that reputation.</p>
        <p>Druids and Wizards are NOT taxis and will never be forced to provide 
          transportation. Their services may be offered but NEVER demanded. Asking 
          if a gater is available once, is acceptable - constant requests / demands 
          are not.</p>
      </div>
      <div align="left">
        <p>Clerics are never to be forced to resurrect you. Asking if a cleric 
          is available once is acceptable - constant requests / demands are not.</p>
        <p>Mages are never to be forced to provide Call of the Hero. Asking for 
          it once is acceptable - constant requests / demands are not.</p>
      </div>
      <div align="left">
        <p>Guildchat is not the auction channel. Please keep price checks and 
          selling to a minimum.</p>
        <p>Request for powerleveling / equipping an alternate is never to be demanded.</p>
      </div>
      <div align="left">
        <p>Blatantly disobeying any rule will result in ONE warning from a guild 
          officer. If the problem continues, immediate guild removal will result.</p>
        <p>If an officer reprimands you at any time, you are expected to cease 
          and desist immediately. An officer has the power and authority to forcibly 
          remove any member who is insubordinate in the face of a reprimand, no 
          exceptions. This applies to guildchat, open channels and the message 
          boards. At a later time, you are allowed to settle your differences 
          with an individual officer via /tell only. If in dire cases you feel 
          you are being severely wronged and wish to bring your grievance up with 
          a higher authority, you are allowed to write a formal e-mail, or send 
          a /tell to the guildleader who will then bring up the issue with the 
          full complement of officers. The decision of the officer council is 
          final.</p>
