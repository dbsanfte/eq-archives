        <h1>Loot Rules</h1>
        <div align="left">
<h1><br>
            Golden Rule: </h1>
          <p>Please remember to thank the Raid leaders. They need to know we appreciate 
            them for taking on the difficult and mostly thankless task of running 
            a raid. They are always doing their very best to make sure the raid 
            is run fairly and in a manner that provides the most enjoyment for 
            all. Without them, all the cool loot would not be possible. <br>
          </p>
          <h1>General Rules:</h1>
          <p><br>
            1. Every raid will have a designated Main Looter (ML) who will handle 
            all Loot and Lottos for the raid. He is responsible for tracking loot 
            drops and winners for each class on each day. Group leaders will pass 
            any droppable cash items to him, as well as let him know of Class 
            specific drops. Never loot any No Drop item unless you have received 
            specific instruction from the ML to do so. <br>
          </p>
          <p>2. Gem lotto is run separately from Class specific Lotto. Gems are 
            typically defined as: Diamonds (D) and Blue Diamonds (BD). Black Sapphires 
            and Jacinth may be either lottoed or count as cash items, depending 
            on the raid. <br>
          </p>
          <p>3. All cash items will be used to reimburse the costs of the raid. 
            Peridots for clerics, Portstones for the planes, coffins should there 
            be a need, and any other expenses incurred during the raid. Cash items 
            include Rings, Necklaces, Earrings, but may also include Black Sapphires 
            and Jacinth. <br>
          </p>
          <p>4. NEED before GREED! (i.e. A weapon that is all melee class but 
            mediocre for all except Shaman, is not a NEED item for other than 
            the Shaman class). <br>
          </p>
          <p>5. NEVER send a tell to the Pulling Group. Tells such as 'pull X 
            MOB' or ''When do you think MY mobs will be pulled&quot; are considered 
            a serious breach of Raid conduct and will be reported to the raid 
            leader and/or the appropriate guild leader. The pull group will get 
            to the mobs that drop your loot when it is safest for them to do so. 
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>6. If you have suggestions for the raid rules/loot/strategy make 
            them before or after the Raid. NOT during. The Loot rules are published 
            before the raid as a means of eliminating any difficulties during 
            raid. If an unusual situation arises during the raid, or you disagree 
            with the disposition of loot, please save your comments until AFTER 
            the raid has concluded. In all matters, the Raid Leadership decision 
            is final. However, after the raid, the leaders would be happy to discuss 
            the decision and consider any possible improvements to raid procedure 
            you may have. <br>
          </p>
          <p>7. All raid participants must turn off /anon and /role before the 
            raid begins. Often the ML will use /who {class} to determine if everyone 
            has rolled or if the Class Specific lotto needs to be reset. If you 
            are /anon or /role there is the possibility of being skipped on a 
            loot. If a party member is AFK or LD and eligible for the lotto, group 
            leaders should definitely make the ML aware, but the loot may be given 
            away to the current highest roller if it is No Drop. Under no circumstances 
            will the loot be allowed to decay waiting on someone to come back 
            from AFK or LD. <br>
          </p>
          <h1>Specific Looting Rules:</h1>
          <p><br>
            1. Group Leader (or whoever the group leader nominates) of the experience-gaining 
            group loots the MOB. No one else! <br>
          </p>
          <p>2. Looter of MOB calls out loot to Zone (even if there is nothing), 
            makes the ML aware of the drop, as well as giving any droppable cash 
            items to the ML. The looter MUST have &quot;/lootnodrop always&quot; 
            set.<br>
          </p>
          <p>3. The ML will then call out the Loot, the classes eligible for lotto 
            and the random numbers. After the roll, the ML will close the Lotto 
            and announce a winner. Please hold any congrats until after the ML 
            has announced a winner. <br>
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </div>
        <div align="left">
          <h1>DKP Rules:</h1>
          The fair and equitable distribution of loot acquired on raids to members 
          of Death Misdealt will be done using a point system. Points are earned 
          by attending official guild raids. Items are obtained by spending points. 
          This means that guests will not be entitled to loot. Pledges and Probationary 
          members will need to earn points before being able to participate in 
          loot. Pledges do not earn points until they are voted in and become 
          Probainary members. Probationary members earn points just like full 
          members. Points are assigned to the player - NOT to the character. If 
          a player brings 3 characters to a 3 point raid, they will earn 3 points 
          only - not 9. Points may be spent for whichever character the player 
          decides.
          <h2><br>
            What is an official guild raid?</h2>
          <p>An official guild raid is one that is planned by an officer and is 
            posted on the raid board. A raid requires a minimum of 2 groups. Points 
            will be earned for official raids only. The only exception to this 
            rule is a guild-run raid that is for killing a major mob that needs 
            the guild to assemble on the spur of the moment (such as Trakanon 
            or Severilous). All official raids will be assigned a certain amount 
            of points based on the type of the raid being held. The points given 
            to each raid will be stated when the raid is posted. But most raids 
            will be easy to figure out the points awarded from the type of raid 
            held.</p>
          <p>Attendance and being on time will be stressed for raids. Showing 
            up on time will give you 1 additional point as an incentive for being 
            on time to the raid. Being on time will be defined as arriving no 
            more than 15 minutes after the scheduled start time or when the raid 
            begins, whichever is deemed appropriate by the raid leader. There 
            will be an exception of a 30 minute allowance, if the raid requires 
            a lot of time for buffing and prepping for the raid to be a success. 
            Again, this will be part of the raid post. There will also be an additional 
            1 point awarded for the raid if you stay until the end, when the raid 
            leader calls it or when too many have left the raid for a successful 
            continuance. </p>
          <h2>Earning Points:</h2>
          <p>All faction raids will be worth 2 points if you stay for a majority 
            of the raid, no start or finish points. </p>
          <p>The minor raids that do not need a major showing on will be given 
            a point reward of 2 points. Examples of this might be to go farming 
            items in zones like Maiden's Eye or Umbral Planes. There will be a 
            beginning point awarded, but no ending point since these kind of raids 
            usually run until people just give up and go to sleep. </p>
          <p><br>
            Raids that involve getting kills for epics are worth 3 points. No 
            beginning or ending points will be awarded. The raid must be scheduled 
            and require 2 or more groups. An exception situation will be where 
            an officer may declare an epic raid on the spur of the moment when 
            a rare mob spawns.</p>
          <p>A raid for killing a single major mob such as Vindi or Trakanon are 
            worth 2 points. A beginning point will be awarded, but an ending point 
            will not be awarded unless the raid continues after the mob is killed, 
            such as farming the lair for spells after killing Trakanon. </p>
          <p>The major raids that we need a strong member showing on like ToV 
            or Plane of Fear are worth 5 points. There will only be a beginning 
            point awarded. </p>
          <p>If a raid fits in multiple categories, the officer scheduling the 
            raid will decide in which catagory to place the raid and announce 
            it in the post.</p>
          <p>Points will be awarded at the end of the raid and will be available 
            for spending at the next raid.</p>
          <h2><br>
            Item Costs:</h2>
          <p>Common drops at a raid that are minor will require no points to purchase 
            them. </p>
          <p>Common items that no one wants except by one person will not be given 
            a purchase point cost. This may also include some class specific items 
            that may drop.</p>
          <p>Good items that are major upgrades for many people (such as a high 
            end weapon, ex. Cresent Blade of Luclin) will get a point cost of 
            16 points. This applies even if no one on the raid needs the item. 
            The item will go to the guild bank so someone will be able to buy 
            the item later on.</p>
          <p>Epic items will cost 6 points.</p>
          <p>Major items that are needed by people will be given a point value 
            of 20-30 points. An item like this may be a high end haste item like 
            a Cloak of Flames or a Breastplate from Trakanon. <br>
            Major uber items from uber mobs like Vindi on up will have a point 
            cost of 35-60 points depending on the item, location, and difficulty 
            of attaining that item.</p>
          <p>Basic planar armor (including Thurgadin and Kael Drakkal) will be 
            given a 6 point cost each. Basic armor drops in ToV will be given 
            a 8 point cost each.</p>
          <p>Planar legs, robes and bp drops will have a cost of 16 &#150; 20 
            points. ToV legs robes, and BP drops will have a cost of 25 points.</p>
          <p>All droppable items remain guild property. When that item is upgraded, 
            it is to be returned to the guild. Turn in value is half the points 
            used to buy the item. The rules for items in the bank still apply. 
            All items that are received from raids or the guild bank are still 
            guild property whether you bought them or not. </p>
          <h2>Starting Points: </h2>
          <p>Members with a main character under level of 60 (minimum level of 
            52) will begin with no points. For each level reached by a main character, 
            5 points will be awarded. An additional 5 points will be awarded for 
            the super hell levels of 54 and 59 for a total of 10 points on these 
            levels.</p>
          <p>Level 60 members will start out with 15 points to spend since they 
            can no longer level to get points. </p>
          <h2>Spending Points: </h2>
          <p>When an item drops, the raid leader will announce the item and it&#146;s 
            point value. All those with enough points to spend on this item will 
            be allowed to roll. As always, the random system will still be used 
            to award the item. The winner of the roll will be given the item and 
            the appropriate amount of points will be subtracted from the person's 
            point total. If only one person has sufficient points for an item, 
            they win by default. If no one has sufficient points for an item, 
            and the item is no-drop, then those wishing to roll may and the winner&#146;s 
            points will go negative. A person with negative points will not be 
            allowed to roll on any other items until their points are in the positive 
            numbers again. The exception here is for epic pieces. A raid for an 
            epic item is not to be scheduled until the person needing the piece 
            has the required number of points for the item. If no one wishes to 
            spend points on the no-drop item, it will be left to rot. At no time 
            will anyone be allowed to loot a no-drop item without spending the 
            required points. An exception to this is when a mq'able no-drop item 
            drops. An officer may loot the item to hold. All droppable items that 
            are not bid on will go to the bank.</p>
          <p>On some special items that drop that are exceptionally rare, they 
            may be allowed to receive a buyout bid in points. What is meant by 
            this is that an exceptionally rare item may drop and it might be an 
            upgrade for someone that never uses his or her points ever because 
            nothing drops that will upgrade that person. In this case, the people 
            with enough points may be allowed to bid as many points as they want 
            up to the maximum that they already have until only one person is 
            left to get the item. This is necessary so that even the people that 
            never need anything will have a chance to spend their points on something 
            once in a while.</p>
