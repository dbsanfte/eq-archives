        <p>Please remember to thank the Raid leaders. They need to know we appreciate 
          them for taking on the difficult and mostly thankless task of running 
          a raid. They are always doing their very best to make sure the raid 
          is run fairly and in a manner that provides the most enjoyment for all. 
          Without them, all the cool loot would not be possible. <br>
        </p>
        <p> The Raid Leader is responsible for posting (on the Raid Board) the 
          location, minimum level requirement (if any), and the gathering and 
          starting times for the raid.</p>
        <p>The Raid Leader has total authority for the raid. Groups will be formed 
          to ensure the success of the raid. Arguing over the composition of the 
          groups will not be tolerated.</p>
        <p>Do not send tells to the Raid Leader unless you are requested to provide 
          specific information. The coordination of a raid takes a lot of work 
          and the constant interruptions only make it worse.</p>
        <p>Do NOT send requests for the puller to bring specific mobs. They and 
          the raid leader / pull group will determine what will be pulled and 
          when.</p>
        <p>Do NOT offer to have your friend(s) pull. The puller / pull group will 
          determine what gets pulled and when.</p>
        <p>Failure to follow the Raid Leader's instructions will result in your 
          banishment from the raid. A second occurrence will result in exclusion 
          from two future raids. A third offense will result in guildremoval.</p>
        <p>Transportation will be provided until 15 minutes before the posted 
          starting time. If you are unable to make the stated time, arrange to 
          move to the gathering point the night before or arrange for your own 
          transportation.</p>
        <p>Call of the Hero will be provided when possible, but should not be 
          expected. </p>
        <p>Peridots and pearls will be supplied for raids. Contact the Treasurer 
          if you need them.</p>
        <p>Loot distribution will be done according to the posted guild loot rules. 
          Any exception to the rules will be announced at the start of the raid 
          and at intervals during the raid. Arguments over loot will not be tolerated.</p>
        <p>The Puller / Pull Group are to be left alone during a raid. /Tells 
          are disruptive and can lead to the failure of the raid. If you have 
          a question, talk to your group leader. If the group leader cannot answer 
          the question, they will contact an officer.</p>
        <p>The Raid Leader will designate the Raid Looter. Each group leader will 
          appoint one person in the group to loot. The looter MUST HAVE confirmation 
          of looting no drop items turned on (/lootnodrop always). Droppable loot 
          is to be given immediately to the Raid Looter. The description and stats 
          of all no drop items is to be sent to the Raid Looter, who will announce 
          the item. Refer to the loot rules for distribution information. <br>
