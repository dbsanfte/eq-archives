<p><b><font size="+1" color="#008080">Gaming”</font></b>
<p><font color="#008080">The FWH Members participate in a variety of different
types of on-line games.&nbsp; Our Home Page will direct you to the main games
currently being played by the FWH members.&nbsp; Please visit our various
message boards located under the Public Forum button.&nbsp; Most of our boards
are open to the general public.&nbsp; Feel Free to post as often as you like.<br>
&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font size="+1" color="#008080">“Membership Procedures”</font></b>
<p><font color="#008080">Membership is limited to a maximum #(to be determined
due to our growth in AC) of ‘active’ players plus the leaders.&nbsp; Upon
reaching our maximum membership levels, new candidates will be placed on a
waiting list.&nbsp; New members are not always the ‘next’ person in line on
the waiting list as the leaders of the clan (referenced on the ‘leaders’
page) may select anyone from the list to be voted upon.&nbsp; No new member is
admitted into the clan unless they receive at least two ‘yes’ votes from the
three leaders.</font>
<p><font color="#008080">If you are interested in joining our clan, please
contact FWH_Richard and tell him of your interest in the clan.&nbsp; Or, leave a
message for them on our Public Message Board (click on the Forums button).&nbsp;
Richard and the other voting members will want to get to know you and play some
games with you.&nbsp; The voting members are FWH_Deathon, FWH_Ares (AKA Silent),
and FWH_Richard.&nbsp; After we get to know you, individual votes are cast by
the three leaders.&nbsp; Upon voting, the appropriate candidate will be notified
of the decision.&nbsp; New members will also be posted on our message board
welcoming them into the clan along with a request for all FWH members to
‘bookmark’ your new FWH name.</font>
<p><font color="#008080">It is also important to play with as many FWH members
as possible as our members let the leaders know whom they think should be
accepted or rejected.&nbsp; We listen closely to our members and their opinions
weigh heavily in the decision making process.<br>
&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font size="+1" color="#008080">“Honor List”</font></b>
<p><font color="#008080">Players who are no longer active within the clan, but
wish to remain in the clan are placed on our FWH “Honor” list on the Members
page.&nbsp; They can continue to play under the FWH name so long as they
continue to uphold the FWH standards.&nbsp; Any “Honor” member may be
immediately re-instated as a “Warrior” on the Warrior list (upon their
request) even if this creates a situation where we exceed our ‘maximum’ clan
membership limits.&nbsp; We do not turn away our friends.&nbsp; Any inactive
members who wish to leave the clan altogether will be permanently removed from
the Warrior and/or Honor lists.<br>
&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font size="+1" color="#008080">“Standards”</font></b>
<p><font color="#008080">Our members strive to fight with honor and integrity.&nbsp;
We don’t use cheats unless all players agree to them.&nbsp; We beat our
enemies to a pulp fairly and squarely, with no quarter given.</font>
<p><font color="#008080">While we avoid yelling back at angry opponents, we will
and do retaliate against an abusive player.&nbsp; We are after all human.&nbsp;
At times, we have also taken abusive players aside after games and had long
talks with them regarding conduct and sportsmanship.&nbsp; This has generally
led to a positive resolution to an otherwise unpleasant situation.&nbsp; We have
and will continue to eliminate any clan members who are overly abusive to other
players or who create unacceptable playing situations.</font>
<p><font color="#008080">We are interested in strong players as well as ‘up
and coming’ players who are learning the ropes.&nbsp; They don’t have to be
the best of players, but we do expect them to be the most honorable of Warriors.&nbsp;
Having said that, we don’t lose too often as a team of 2 or 3 players.&nbsp;
When we do lose, it’s usually a fun game for all while the victors seem to
appreciate the conquest.</font>
<p><font color="#008080">We have made many friends on the zone and within our
clan.&nbsp; Indeed, some friendships have become long-lasting friendships, which
of course makes the gaming experience that much more enjoyable.&nbsp; After all,
in the end, it’s not about war, but about peace and friends.<br>
