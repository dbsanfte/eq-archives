First and foremost, we respect each member as the real person first. Many of us have developed friendships outside the various games.
We are a cohesive and organized group. We are not strict RPers, but we do RP often and very much enjoy it. We have several alliances with other guilds working together to protect and even expand the great empire of Albion.
We do not require you to participate in RvR or Trades, but we are very active in pursuing those routes. There are many opportunities within Our House for you to pursue.</span><small class="date">(Added: 2001-11-06 Hits: 3  Rating: 0.00 Votes: 0) <a href="http://links.allakhazam.com/cgi-bin/rate.cgi?ID=4380">Rate It</a></small></ul><ul><li><a class="link" href="http://links.allakhazam.com/cgi-bin/jump.cgi?ID=4509">Inner Solstice</a><small class="date">(Added: 2001-11-10 Hits: 3  Rating: 10.00 Votes: 1) <a href="http://links.allakhazam.com/cgi-bin/rate.cgi?ID=4509">Rate It</a></small></ul><ul><li><a class="link" href="http://links.allakhazam.com/cgi-bin/jump.cgi?ID=4203">Invictus - Guardians of Albion</a><span class="descript">- We are a guild of very dedicated warriors and mages. Risen up from the dust we have come a long way since our early days. We are a major role-playing guild and plan to play a huge role in Dark Ages of Camelot. All the followers of Master Kurtain and High Lord Alyxon fight and defend Albion with great honor. All of our members are very mature and dedicated to Invictus. Almost everyone of us will take a hit for another.
We look for Uniqueness rather than mass. This means that being in Invictus is a great honor because we don't recruit just everyone. If you are qualified this could be a great experience for you and you will make many new friends if you plan to play DAoC for an extended amount of time. Thank you for your time and happy travels and hunting Albion Warriors.

The undead hordes come forth that day, slamming into the battle fray, screams of rendered dieing. And above them all a chant was heard, Loud and clear flying like the bird, through the screams of Pain. The Night Watch stormed forth, its banner unfurled, its bloody curse, its swords a gleam with blood red stained, Its mouths a screaming its very name, And the enemy did fall back, folding in upon that very attack, And in the begining there only stood... one company above the horde.
