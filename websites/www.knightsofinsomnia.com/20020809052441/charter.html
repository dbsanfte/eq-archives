        to provide a support system that shall not only sustain its members, but 
        also to reach out to all of those in Norrath who are in need. It is our 
        goal as the Knights of Insomnia to be a positive and protective society 
        within the expanse that is Norrath; furthermore, to be of service to any 
        and all who reach out to us. As a Knight, members are required to abide 
        by the rules of the council of Officers and Guild leader as listed below. 
        Please note that any and all rules are subject to change as our guild 
        matures and develops. Please visit the Guild Forum Boards or attend guild 
        meetings as posted on our homepage to have the opportunity to give your 
        officers and leader any input you might have concerning our charter or 
        anything else.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC">All Knights are expected to be familiar with the 
        Articles of the Guild Charter that pertain to them. This Charter is posted 
        so everyone may view it freely; ignorance of the Char<font size="3">ter

      <p><font color="#CCCCCC">Knights of Insomnia has three ranks of leadership: 
        Field Marshall, General and Commander. The order of seniority is as follows- 
        Guild Leader (also a Field Marshall), the remaining Field Marshalls, Generals, 
        then Commanders. For a list of our officers please click <a href="http://www.knightsofinsomnia.com/officers.html">here</a>. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC">In some situations an alternate of an officer may 
        also have the commands required to perform officer's tasks. In this case, 
        the alternate officer is referred to as an Officer Lietenant. Officer 
        Lietenant's have the same authority given to their main character in instances 
        where they must make a decision as an officer. In the event an officer's 
        vote is needed, only one character per person may place a vote. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC">There shall be a set number of officers per rank. 
        Currently the restrictions are 3 Field Marshalls, 8 General's and 6 Commanders. 
        Field Marshall positions may only be elected by our Guild Leader Baril 
        Barontundra. Generals may be elected by a unanimous decision of Field 
        Marshall's. Commanders may be elected by majority vote of Field Marshall's 
        and Generals in attendance of said vote. Once an officer is elected, he 
        or she may chose to accept or decline an offer for promotion.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC">However, if an officer of Knights of Insomnia resigns 
        from their position as an officer without prior notice to our officers, 
        they may be placed on probationary status for a period of up to 30 days 
        during which time they will not be eligible for promotion within the guild.Should 
        a vacancy arise in any rank, the position will be filled from the next 
        lowest rank in the voting method described above. </font></p>

  <tr>
    <td valign="top" height="325"> 
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC">In the instance a member of Knights of Insomnia 
        has been determined to have violated the charter in any way, they may 
        be placed on probation by any officer. At such time, the officer will 
        be expected to notify the member via /tell of their violation and status. 
        Once a member has been notified of their probationary status, the officer 
        responsible for the decision has sole discretion over whether or not they 
        feel the need to announce the probation in guild chat. Regardless of this 
        decision, it is this officers responsibilty to post the decision on the 
        officers board located on our guild forum boards, contact other officers 
        online and make a report to our Guild Historian. Each instance of probation 
        will be documented as a Guild Incident by our Historian for future reference.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC">The default amount of time for probation is 30 
        days, although if the instance is severe a vote may be cast for a members 
        removal before this probationary period has ended. Any Knight with a probationary 
        status mark on their record will not be eligible for promotion or other 
        positive guild advancement until the mark is &quot;expired&quot; or the 
        probationary status period has ended or been terminated. Once a mark has 
        expired, the incident is forgiven and does not count against a member 
        for future promotion or advancement. Should a member require more than 
        one mark in any given time, or repeatedly require marks for the same infraction, 
        they will be subject to removal. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC">A decision to remove a member of Knights of Insomnia 
        must be made during an officers meeting and requires a vote. A Field Marshall 
        must be present to make the final decision of removal. Should a Field 
        Marshall be unavailable, the decision must wait until one is available. 
        Officers meetings shall take place in a private chat channel created for 
        this purpose. Not all officers must be in physical attendance to vote, 
        should they have access to this private chat channel. In some instances 
        a vote may be conducted on the officers forum boards.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC">Removal of a member may only be performed by a 
        Field Marshall. Should an officer remove a member without following proper 
        protocol, they will immediately be placed on probation. </font></p>
