<H3>Herein laid out are the codes and foundation of the Legion of Avatar</H3>
</center>
<B>
And so it hath been written in the stars… that one day, a following will come
forth. A gathering unlike any seen in Norrath. High in the plains above, a party of 
individuals shall come together, and together shall these spread the word. The 
word of honor and truth. The word of valor and justice. Thus is the back-bone of all 
principles of the Legion of Avatar.
<P>
Thy role, as an Avatar Legionnaire, shall be summed in these codes:
<P>
thy word shall be thy bond<BR>
thy honor shall be thy spirit<BR>
thy valor shall be thy strength<BR>
thy truth shall be thy virtue<BR>
thy skills shall be thy discipline<BR>
the code shall be thy bane
<P>
Follow these codes, for these shall be thy life-line in Norrath. Flaunt them not, but neither 
shouldst thou hide them, for thy code shall be a beacon for all to see in awe, and envy.
Thou shalt not make enemies in Norrath, but if one shouldst attempt to waylay thee in 
any form, thou shouldst find means to defend thyself. We are peace-keepers, but in this 
we are vigilantes too.
<P>
Mark mine words, for if one day, shouldst there be any ill-remark passed on to me on thy 
behavior, and mine investigations are justified, thou shalt face the wrath of mine 
judgement.
<P>
Go now, fair warrior, and spread the word of the Legion of Avatar.
<P>
