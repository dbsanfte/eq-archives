  <u><em><strong>The Legacy of the Fellowship </strong></em></u></p>
<p>The Fellowship of Justice was founded in September of 1999. Since that time, 
  it has seen many changes. I shall do my best to describe those changes to those 
  who care to listen. The fellowship remains as one of, if not THE oldest guild 
  residing on the Innoruuk Server.</p>
<p><em><strong>Democracy?</strong></em><br>
  Shortly after the guild was founded by the Honorable Warrior Astioch Multovian, 
  he decided to establish a series of checks and balances and generate a voice 
  for all persons within the guild, so that in matters of the guild, they may 
  receive fair justice. The first step in this process was in a position called 
  the High Judiciary. This position would be an elected official whom the guild, 
  all members, would vote on once per moon cycle, and would oversee all guild 
  matters in regards to rule violations, and disbanding of persons from the guild. 
  Astioch then generated a council known as the High Council, who would oversee 
  invitations to the guild. Those members would be appointed officials, appointed 
  initially by Astioch, then voted in by the other Council members when needed. 
  In theory, Astioch had hoped this would provide an ample power base and a solid 
  voice for the seemingly lowest member within the guild.</p>
<p>However, shortly after this panel and the High Judiciary were established, 
  they approached Astioch and inform him that they wished the guild leadership 
  position to also be voted upon. Astioch, believing the guild was more important 
  than he, stepped down and agreed to this. Heart-broken that he was voted from 
  what he had worked so hard to establish and create, he left the guild and was 
  not heard from again for some time.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Age of Change</em></strong><br>
  Shortly after Lord Astioch had left the Fellowship, the guild members began 
  to bicker among themselves as to where the seat of power would be held. Entire 
  waves of persons left and joined, all hoping to establish themselves as the 
  elite power within the guild. Most of these who had gone wished to return to 
  the old ways, with Astioch as the ruler, but he was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Rising upon the scene was a young promising druid by the name of Corneleous, 
  who had many visions. A new guild was formed with Corneleous as the leader, 
  known as the Ambassadors of Norrath. This guild was founded with basic rules 
  across the board, and had a set guild leader and officers.</p>
<p>Corneleous was young and ambitious, and often foolish, so the guild leadership 
  was kept in the Founder's hands, Amilu.</p>
<p>Over time, the young Corneleous grew weary of not having control of a guild. 
  His youthful arrogance led him to leave the Ambassadors, and seek status elsewhere. 
  In time, as he grew, and after losing his wife, Amilu, he began to understand 
  and mature. He went back to the Fellowship and asked who their leader now was.</p>
<p>Suffering over a year of power struggles and turmoil, the Fellowship was barely 
  clinging to life with but a few scant and rarely seen members. The leader, a 
  druid by the name of Nate, had taken the job only to see the Fellowship live 
  on. </p>
<p>Nate approached Corneleous and asked him if he wished to take the reigns of 
  the guild. Corneleous, eager to prove that he had grown and could produce a 
  flourishing guild, gladly accepted. Shortly after taking over, he established 
  what the Fellowship of today uses as a ranking structure. He would appoint a 
  Baron of each class, whereby they would oversee the activities of that class. 
  He then set out on a massive recruiting mission to obtain Barons that would 
  fit these needs.</p>
<p>Amilu, seeing that Corneleous had perhaps found some maturity and wisdom, agreed 
  to re-merge the Ambassadors of Norrath with the Fellowship of Jusice, under 
  the name of Fellowship of Justice. Corneleous recruited Borcen for the Rogues, 
  Amilu for the Rangers, Aanidar for the Shadow Knights, Alerious for the Bards, 
  Brutice for the Monks, Revas for the Cleric, Leonides for the Enchanters, Razzle 
  for the Magicians, Fazenla for the Wizards, and many others. The guild began 
  to flourish, and times were indeed good.</p>
<p><strong><em>The House Merger</em></strong><br>
  With the flourishing guild came a ton of advancement in levels for quite a few 
  of the members. Eventually, these members began to leave in search of guilds 
  able to handle the alternate planes of reality. Seeing that several others might 
  follow, Corneleous generated a way to keep the family together. If he could 
  find a quality guild, willing to absorb the members of the Fellowship and was 
  planes-ready, perhaps he could save the core of the Family. He therefore went 
  to the House of Isildur, headed by a dear friend of Cornelous, Beladonna and 
  her husband. He presented his idea and it was met with great excitement. The 
  merger went through shortly after, and all persons of both guilds seemed quite 
  pleased.</p>
<p>Some members, however, had already committed themselves to other guilds, and 
  did not make the merger. Most did, however, and the guild has done well, and 
  is still thriving and flourishing to this day.</p>
<p>Corneleous was appointed as an officer to the House of Ilisdur and made many 
  friends, but still lacked the experience to travel with the officers in the 
  House. Still longing for his roots, and saddened to the loss of what he deemed 
  was finally a strong Fellowship, he left the House quietly, and wandered the 
  plains of Norrath alone for some time. </p>
<p><strong><em>Rebirth</em></strong><br>
  One day, while adventuring, a dear and old friend happened by Corneleous. She 
  sat and spoke of grand times with the Fellowship and the House. They spoke of 
  fond memories, and of painful ones. They eventually spoke of the futre and where 
  it might lead.</p>
<p>Lady Fazenla then stated, perhaps it is time to see the Fellowship live again 
  and forever. This pleased Corneleous, but alas, all he could do was smile out 
  of remembrance rather than hope; it had seemed a nice idea, nothing more.</p>
<p>Over a few weeks of pondering, Corneleous felt refreshed and made the decision 
  to start from scratch. He was in Kelethin, assisting some younger apprentices 
  with their battles with the Crushbone Orcs, when they began asking about guilds 
  and other matters of Norrath. They spoke of the lack of assistance within the 
  world, and this seemed to spawn the new ideals of what would be the Fellowship.</p>
<p>he decided that perhaps the grandeur of an elite guild was not in his blood, 
  but perhaps a specialty guild in which he could do what he enjoyed doing most; 
  helping others. Those who would share these ideals may be interested in such 
  a family. He approached Lady Fazenla and informed her of his decision and ideas. 
  Fazenla loved the idea and asked to be a part of it.</p>
<p>From that day forward, they began to work tirelessly to rebuild a guild where 
  people could consider themselves at home; where people could have others they 
  would be proud to call Family.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Future</em></strong><br>
  The future, as we know, is written by those with the perseverance to see their 
  convictions through. The Fellowship of Justice is more than a guild, more than 
  a name, and more than a family; it is a foundation in ideals that something 
  can be created and exist that has a sole purpose of being beneficial to all 
  those who come in contact with it.</p>
<p>Our future depends solely upon the success of that idea, and who would have 
  the courage to continue to carry and teach it.</p>
<p>2002</p>
<p><em>This year will see bring our guild to the ripe age of 3. I anticipate great 
  things to come about for the Fellowship. Last year we saw our membership rise 
  and fall, members leave for their own endeavors of Epic quests and other members 
  return again to their home. The constant changing of Norrath and the discovery 
  of realms continues to keep the interests of our family alive. Some of our family 
  have moved on to the realms of Midgard, Hibernia, and Camelot in another land. 
  I believe that as a family, our interests shall press on into these realms as 
  well. </em><br>
</p>
<p>2002-2004</p>
<p>During this time, the fellowship appeared to all but die. People left the guild, 
moved onto other realms, or simply disappeared. We remained "inactive" for much too long. 
But those times have passed! The Fellowship is reborn, and daily growing in number and 
strength once more! The evils of Norrath will soon feel the fury of the Justice! We have 
received word that the Founding Father is planning to extend the Fellowship family onto 
The Tribunal! <br><br>

Will you be for Justice, or will you be Justified? <br>
