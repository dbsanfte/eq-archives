<br>
I spent many months as an active forum troll for this game and from what I've read from the actual beta testers is that if there is one thing still left to work out it would be class balance. Now I'm not saying that its horrible or anything, but I'm pretty sure most of the classes still need a bit of polishing. That being said, most of the negative posts I've read about class balance have been from people that didn't truly want actual balance, but instead wanted their preferred class to be uber. Things like, &quot;Mages can shoot fire balls, why cant I ?&quot; I don't know if you consider that sort of stuff imbalanced or not. Blizzard has put in a lot of effort trying to achieve balance for the PvE and PvP parts of the game, which is really hard considering they almost always contradict each other. Thats all I'm going to say about class balance, for I haven't gotten to see it up close and personal yet.<br>
<br>
Now for the economy. Blizzard set in at least three things to try and control inflation (the main killer of an online economy, 400k swords aren't cool); expensive mounts, lots of bind on equip items, and most recently, item durability (having to pay to repair items, but they never break or anything like that). Once again I cant say if these measures have worked or not, but they were worth mentioning.<br>
<br>
Servers, couldn't tell ya. Not a techno wizard have no clue.<br>
<br>
Hope that helped some, I'm sure Ouze and Ken can be more helpful.<br>

Oh well.<br>
<br>
I'm giving mine anyway.<br>
<br>
If you come into WoW expecting it to be EQ all over again, you are gonna be sorely let down. While the game does share aspects with EQ (IE Questing and some Raiding) some of the other features are gone. For instance there's no &quot;Magic Group&quot; like there was in EQ. There's not a particulary high demand for any one class due to the fact that any class can contribute to a group. And yea, most of the bitching about class balance has been because either a class got nerfed down to where it should have been. IE when mages lost invis so they couldn't invis and insta-kill with some of their more powerful spells.<br>
<br>
Server hacking? Please. This is an MMO, not yer standard run of the mill freebie game like Diablo. It would be just as easy to Hack/Cheat on Everquest, Everquest II, Lineage 2, City of Heroes, Star Wars Galaxies, Planetside, or any other MMO as it would be WoW. Just because it's made by Blizzard doesn't say anything. I for one, have seen far fewer exploits. I have yet to hear of a &quot;Gold Dupe&quot; a'la the hundreds of Plat dupes in EQ. Leading to a very stable economy and making each single copper piece you pick up worth something. There weren't even GMs on Diablo last I remember. Not in the MMO sense of the word anyway. Hell one night some dude annoyed the shit out of Lith, Alua and myself, even going so far as to berate us with foul language. I reported him, and the next day I got an e-mail letting me know he had been dealth with? How you say? Bannination! So if you plan on playing, check your temper at the door. They take stuff like cussing, racism, and harrassment serious in WoW. (FYI the guy called myself and Lith Fucktards, and Alua a cunt. Normally I wouldn't have reported him for something so stupid, but he also proceeded to try to train us, and then leapfrog us to a kill we needed). Some dude KS you? You pissed about it? Better check that &quot;You fucker that was my kill!&quot; and replace it with a &quot;I need to kill that mob, would you mind letting me have one, or possibly grouping with me so we can benefit each other.&quot; or you might find yourself banninated for a minimum of 3 days. Alot of the rules were put in specificly because of the Diablo and Diablo 2 issues.<br>
<br>
There are a couple of major things that you didn't touch on that you might want to concider.<br>
<br>
1. There is PVP in WoW on each and every server. It doesn't matter if you are on a PVE or PVP server. There's just more PVP on a PVP server. Ask Cili or Lithian, both accidently got PVP flagged at one time or another during OB. Had an Alliance member been around and felt froggy, they could have attacked em. <br>
<br>
2. Raiding is not a focus of WoW. The focus is what you make of it. If you want to raid, cool good deal, there are instanced dungeons that start around level 13 and continue well on into 60. There's Big Bad dragons that need slaying. If you want to go out and solo, well that's ok too. You can solo as virtually any class though it's a bit tougher for say priests, due to the fact most of their spells are healing. <br>
<br>
3. There is no SoW. If you don't enjoy seeing scenery, don't apply. Until you get a good flight path map, you'll be goin everywhere on foot, and the world size is comparable to Original EQ, only without the zoning.<br>
<br>
4. It's rather difficult to keep yourself funded. Like I said, not many farming opprotunities, no easy money. Every copper means somethin. And with Money Sinks like Mounts, Item Durability Repairs, new spells/abilities on even number levels, new weapons and armor on odd number levels, it's really hard to keep up. You can't just say &quot;Ahhh this Sword is only 15 SIlver, I have 30, I can make it up.&quot; You have to think about purchases and how much anything you spend on will benefit you. Sure, that Level 10 Sword is still damn good for a Level 13, but once you hit 17, yer gonna be lookin for an upgrade already. Until you get in the High 30s/Mid 40s you'll change gear about as regular as you do your underwear. <br>
<br>
5. Did I mention that some time or another, no matter how careful you are, you WILL BE THROWN INTO PVP. If you can't live with that fact, you will at one time or another be as furious as you have ever been. It's happened to me, so I know this for a fact. I've never been big on PVP in MMOs. What did I do to cope, and not let this ruin the game for me? I embraced it. I am now a full fledged blood aholic. I will stab an elf quicker than they can say &quot;NINJA!&quot;. I don't care if they are 10 levels above me (Just as Lith and Ouze about that one). <br>
<br>
6. Again, just to make sure and believe it. Traveling is difficult in WoW. Just getting from Ogrimmar (Orc/Troll Home) to Thunderbluff (Tauren Home) is a feat in itself below level 20. There aren't any travel spells like SoW. There aren't any druids porting for plat. There are very few mages porting at all. And good luck finding a warlock with 2 people standing around with nothin better to do with their time than trying to summon you. If you want to be there, and you don't have a flight path, you've got 2 options, and they each have 5 toes on em. Oh yea, and on the way, there's always that chance  you'll get deaded on the way there and pretty much have to start back where you came from.<br>
<br>
7. Died and don't have time to run back to your corpse? Think you'll just camp and get a rez when you log on? Ain't happenin. You have a 6 minute window to get rezzed and after that, yer footin it back to your corpse. Yea, true you can use the spirit healer, but there goes 25% of your gear's condition. And that costs money to fix. See #4 for more info.<br>
<br>
8. You<br>
<br>
9. will<br>
<br>
10. get<br>
<br>
11. PKed. It could be by someone 3x your level. It could be a complete misunderstanding and you just accidently get PVP flagged for 5 minutes and at 4 minutes 50 seconds some gnome mage walks up and nukes you. I promise, at one time, you will hear about each and every one of use and our first time being PKed experience. Wanna hear mine? Ok cool. I was doing a quest that required me to get some items from a human. But naturally being an asshat (I mean he was a human after all) he wanted me to get him something first. I think it was like a beer or somethin. At this point, I have 2 options, I can kill him and loot what I need from his cold dead corpse, or I can spend my night tryin to track this shit down. I am not a patient man. About 10 seconds later, I have my stuff. On my way back to town, I see this purple guy. Then it dawns on me... &quot;Hey that's an elf.&quot; This just so happened to dawn on me about the same time his sword dawned on my skull. And his gnome friends fireball dawned on my back. So... I'm dead. Ok so I run back to my corpse and guess what, Mr. Elf and his Short-assed friend are still there. Oh well, maybe they're just resting, kicking my ass in 2 hits probably took alot out of em. I think I'll rez and be on my merry way. Yea, I rez and in 2 more hits, I'm back where I started. Corpse camping is perfectly legal and perfectly legit in Blizzards rules. Oh noes! Ken what am I gonna do if I r teh camped corpse? Well my good lad, either chunk out the change to get yer shit repaired, or call in your friends. I chose option 2 and it was much fun. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying this is gonna happen every day, week, month, hour, whatever. But yea, odds are about 50/50 that it'll happen to you sometime, even on a PVE server. That's why I put the PVP/PVE poll up in guild section. I knew I couldn't convince enough people to go to PVP, but it's much easier to regulate that shit on there than it is PVE. Even if you DON'T wind up in a similar situation, PVP is almost expected as it's a good way to progress. There are rewards for PVPing and being honorable about it. There are penalties for being an assjack and gankin someone lower level than you. Like it or not, PVP is a part of the game.<br>
<br>
Those are some of what old time EQers might consider the negatives. Here, is a brief list of the positives IMO.<br>
<br>
1. It's a lush enviroment that runs well on even low end systems<br>
<br>
2. There aren't a hundred and fifty classes that wind up all reeking of the same stench.<br>
<br>
3. Thousands and Thousands and Thousands of quest.<br>
<br>
4.Unique classes. While some are similar, none are close enough to infringe on each other.<br>
<br>
5. Rather quick progression. You can be level 20 in a couple or few days just from playing casual and doin quests. Meaning you can have multiple characters and not fall far behind.<br>
<br>
6. PVP is fun.<br>
<br>
7. Rich background and history. None of this wayfar brotherhood shit.<br>
<br>
8. Inventive combat system with all the stuff EQ promised you. Combos, Openings, Chains... it's all there.<br>
<br>
9. Unique spells and abilities for every class.<br>
<br>
10. Strong feelings of accomplishment after completing hard quest, getting your first PVP kill, hitting level 40 and getting a mount, clearing your first instanced dungeon, participating in your first city raid, getting your first green item, getting your first blue item, getting your first purple item. <br>
<br>
11. With some greenbacks and time, you can dress like a pirate. Or even... dare I say? A NINJA! <p><center><img border=0 src="http://www.guilddahui.com/files/sigs/retardo.gif" /></center></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://p218.ezboard.com/bdahuiwow.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kenlaienbloodraven>Kenlaien Bloodraven</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0> at: 11/21/04 1:47 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p218.ezboard.com/bdahuiwow.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nanelien>nanelien</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Irate</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#330000>(11/21/04 1:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p218.ezboard.com/fdahuiwowfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=56.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Considering WOW</span><hr size=1> Hey Big A, all you need to know is I'm going to be playing wow.

<br>
Anyway, it's really not fair to compare EQ to WoW.  They are both so very different.<br>
<br>
As Ken said, money is a precious commodity.  Me being the bazaar whore that I am, I usually spend all my cash in the Auction House.  You earn most of your cash by doing quests.  You do make cash if you farm things like Linen and Tusks and such...or crappy weapons that you can't use that aren't worth auctioning.  But I noticed the majority of my money was earned in quests...as well as my XP.<br>
<br>
You can play for 2 hours a day and still not fall too far behind.  If you play for 8 hours a day or more...(like myself) you can get lvl 10 within a day or two.  Level 20 by the week's end if not sooner.<br>
<br>
Server Security...ken already covered pretty well.<br>
<br>
PK'ing; yes, ken will jump someone faster than a bulldog in heat.  He's just lucky he had good healers nearby <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   It's all in good fun though A-man.  It continues the story of the conflict between the alliance and the horde.<br>
<br>
The only way that I know of to increase running speed is one quest in the barrens, where you aid a Razormane Boar...but the spell lasts for 5 minutes.  Other than that, it's spells only available to 2 classes.  Shaman's and *druids* I believe have a spell.  Mounts that cost a lot of cash and are a great investment.<br>
<br>
To me, being an EQ bard, running kills me.  I endure however, only to know that someday I'm going to be a badass mofo on a Raptor!<br>
<br>
Talent points are very cool.  They basically shape your character into a mold designed by you.  They remind me quite a bit of the D2 abilities, only more thought out with long-term effects on a much larger scale.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I personally cannot wait for retail.  I'm chomping at the bit.  I hope I have enough money left over after I purchase a desk and chair.  I'm currently playing on a coffee table in my room with a laundry basket full of clothes with a pillow on top for a chair.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>1.) Serious class imbalance</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Short answer, no. Long answer, sometimes. For regular grouping it doesn't especially matter what class you are. You can literally go hang with 4 of whomever and do what you like and not be impaired by the lack of a cleric or a enchanter or whatever the hell like EQ. Rogues have the ability to mez for short times, warriors have the ability to snare, etc, etc - there is a lot of overlap. By this I would call it balanced. <br>
<br>
Long answer - since you level very quickly in the game, a lot of your time will eventually be spent PvPing in battleground areas. Remember, you don't lose anything in this game for PvP, so it's actually intelligent and fun! Here is where the class imbalance comes in. Just like in EQ, some classes excel in PvP and some simply do not. Your average caster will almost always beat your average melee type, but even among melee types there are imbalances. There is a video of a Paladin slaying a equal level, superiorly geared warrior... <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>bare-handed</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, completely weaponless. Allegedly this was one of the best warriors on that server, and just an average paladin. Part of it is just that warriors work a little different then the other melee classes - other melee classes start out with the equivalent of &quot;mana&quot; that lets them do special moves, warriors have to build up a pool through combat, and so always start out at a disadvantage in PvP - and part of it, any rational person will tell you, is because the paladin class is extremely overpowered. This may get adjusted on release.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>2.)Dreadful Economics...ie...in D2 cash was worthless.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
It would be hard to answer that unless the game ran a lot longer, since the player economy had not much time to develop, but at least in the short term, cash was king. There are a lot of moneysinks in WoW. Let's put it like this - Originally when you died, you could either a.) walk back, get your corpse, and lose nothing, or b.) take a &quot;rez&quot; and respawn on the spot at a spirit healer in a graveyard somewhat near where you died for some XP loss. (or I guess c.) get a player rez but that's neither here nor there). Anyways, they decided to change B.) so that you would instead take a 100% hit on the durability of your worn equipment. Without explaining the durability system, lets simply say without durability it's as if you didn't have the gear and had to pay a vendor to repair it. The point of this was, after this was done, many players asked them to make it back into an XP loss because the cash hit was harder then the minor xp loss.*<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>3.)Hacked Servers with no attempt to stop it</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Can't honestly say, and I won't lie and say &quot;I'm sure Blizzard won't have this&quot;, because they sure have been friendly or at least tolerant to this in the past. Like the others have said, there are a lot more reasons why they won't tolerate it this time - not when they have a monthly paying product and there are other similar paying products on the market that have a track record of not tolerating hackers like EQII - but only time will tell. For the people that have mentioned that there is no such thing as cheating on a serverside MMO, that's not 100% true - it depends on how much the server trusts the client. For a while you could cheat in EQ by using what were called memory offset hacks, so nothing is a given.<br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;">*As a followup, for retail the durability hit is reduced to 25% from 100%, and it's worth mentioning you have 2 ways of getting your corpse that don't lose you anything at all: the spirit healer rez is for exceptional situations, such as falling off a zeppelin into the ocean or dying in the bottom of a dungeon).</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <p><img border=0 src="http://www.guilddahui.com/files/sigs/ouzewow.gif" />

Even if you die in the bottomless pit of the most evil shithole, as soon as you zone in to said instance as a ghost, you will usually rez on zone in. <p><center><img border=0 src="http://www.guilddahui.com/files/sigs/retardo.gif" /></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p218.ezboard.com/bdahuiwow.showUserPublicProfile?gid=marksm>MarksM</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.tccoa.com/thundar/Animations/moon.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>my car's older then you</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#330000>(11/21/04 8:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p218.ezboard.com/fdahuiwowfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=56.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.tccoa.com/thundar/SC/rearsc.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Considering WOW</span><hr size=1> Do instanced mobs respawn, or is it a clear path to the rest of the group? <p>2003 Miata SE (573 of 1549)<br>

And ken is right.  If you die in an instanced zone, you will rez upon zoning in.  I died far back in RC, and noticed I rezed as soon as I entered.  So a twp doesn't turn into a long CR as in EQ. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://p218.ezboard.com/fdahuiwowfrm7.showPrevMessage?topicID=56.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://p218.ezboard.com/fdahuiwowfrm7.showNextMessage?topicID=56.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://p218.ezboard.com/fdahuiwowfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=56.topic&index=10><img src=http://www.guilddahui.com/files/ezboard/button_reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://p218.ezboard.com/fdahuiwowfrm7.emailToFriend?topicID=56.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://p218.ezboard.com/fdahuiwowfrm7.threadControl?topicID=56.topic><img src=http://www.guilddahui.com/files/ezboard/button_topiccommands.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://p218.ezboard.com/fdahuiwowfrm7.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=56.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://p218.ezboard.com/fdahuiwowfrm7.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=56.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://p218.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="dahuiwowfrm11">Library - Welcome Area<option value="dahuiwowfrm7">Crooked Troll Tavern - General Discussion<option value="dahuiwowfrm10">Hall of Tactics<option value="dahuiwowfrm9">Ye Olde Hobby Shoppe<option value="dahuiwowfrm8">Swindler's Alley<option value="dahuiwowfrm14">The Administration Office<option value="dahuiwowfrm13">Clan Hall<option value="dahuiwowfrm12">Voting Booth<option value="dahuiwowfrm15">Buckets o' Plunder</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#330000>- </font><a href=http://p218.ezboard.com/bdahuiwow>Da Hui - World of Warcraft Guild</a><font color=#330000> - </font><a href=http://p218.ezboard.com/fdahuiwowfrm7>Crooked Troll Tavern - General Discussion</a> <font color=#330000> - </font><a href="http://www.guilddahui.com">Da Hui</a><font color=#330000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.31w<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
