<p>
As most of you know, most of our research recipies require the
earlier version of the spell (Lesser summoning requires minor
summoning, summon coldstone requires summon heatstone, etc.).
This usually isn't a problem, except there are some times when
to research a summon elemental spell, you also have to research
the previous 1, 2, or 3 levels of that spell, because it can't
be bought on vendors.  This is usually called "Chain" researching.
This page lists all the spells that can <b>only</b> be researched,
that require "chain" researching.
<p>
Greater Summoning: Water (level 29) requires Summoning: Water (level
24)<br>
Conjuration: Earth (level 44) requires Lesser Conjuration: Earth (level
39)<br>
Greater Conjuration: Mist (level 49) requires Conjuration: Mist (level
44)<br>
Greater Conjuration: Water (level 49) requires Conjuration: Water (level
44), which requires Lesser Conjuration: Water (level 39)
<p>Of course, you <b>can</b> Chain research all of the spells if you 
want to, but these are the only places where you are forced to, because
the lower level spells are not sold anyplace on Norrath.
