<p>Practice Research is used to, well, Practice Research, without 
using up valuable Words or other Components.  
<p>To engage in Practice Research, you have to find the Gypsy Mrysila 
in North Karana (if you're Evil, there's an equivalent Gypsy in South
Ro).  Trading her a lightstone will net you either Runes and Research
Volume 1 (instructions) or Runes and Research Volume 2 (recipies).
Trading her a Greater Lightstone will get you the Concordance of Research,
a book you can combine things in similar to the Elemental Grimoire.
<p>To Practice Research, find the components for the Azla and Beza rune of
the appropriate type (they're listed here and in R&Rv2 in order if
increasing difficulty).  Combine the components plus a parchment and a
quill in the Concordance of Research to get the Rune (one at time, once to
get the Azla and once to get the Beza).  Once you have both runes, combine
them both in your Elemental Grimoire.  Voila, you've just practiced
research, and if you're lucky your skill went up.  
<p>Recipies marked with a * have not been confirmed.  All
others have been tested by players and work.
If you have an addition, correction, or confirmation, please email me
