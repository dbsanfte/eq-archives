These tables are listed in a completely subjective order of how useful
they are to your average Magician, from least to most.  Obviously, 
there's room for interpretation.
<p>They often leave out a few items that aren't worth your time 
(orc picks, Bloody Shanks, etc.)
<p>Note that for mundane weapons (like daggers, staves, etc.) there's
usually variants available (like fine steel, combine, etc.).  These are
not shown.
<p>"Source" means where you can find the item, either loot (dropped from a
NPC), quest, vendor, spell (summoned item), craft (made by a trade
skill), or GM (dropped in a GM event, may or may not be available someplace
else).
<p>Where a value is shown as x/y, the value before the slash is for small
items, the value after the slash is for medium items (no magician can wear
large items).
<p>Some of the jewelcraft items are in the lists (particularly those that
increase Intelligence or mana), but most are not.  
<p>If you find these lists useful, I wholeheartedly reccommend 
<A HREF="http://www.pompano.net/~amylynn1/">EQ Items</A>, where most of
this information came from anyways.
