<p>Hey Folks.  <p>As most of you have probably
noticed, I haven't updated this site in way too long.  Which is largely
because I don't have the time to, and I don't play Everquest anymore. 
Thanks for the words of praise and encouragement that continue to come in,
despite my criminally negligent behaviour.  The site will remain as it was
<a href="index2.html">here</a> for the forseeable future, though there
won't be any more updates.  If someone wants to copy the information there
and start the site up again someplace else, feel free.  Let me know, and
I'll provide a link there.  Until then, feel free to use what's left
(keeping in mind that it's woefully out of date), or use one of the other
excellent sites still available in the links section.  
<p>Thanks again for the support all these years.
