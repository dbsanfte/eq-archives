<title>Int vs. Mana</title>

<body>
People often ask me "What's better, having +Int items, or having +Mana
items?"
<p>OK, that's a lie, no one has ever asked me that.  But if they did, this
is what I'd tell them:
<p>The basic formula for calculating mana is ((Int/5)+2)*level.
<p>What this means is that every 5 extra points of Intelligence is worth
one extra point of mana per level, conversely, every extra point of
Intelligence is worth one extra point of mana per five levels.
<p>To take an example, let's say you have the choice between a +20 mana
ring, or a +3 Intelligence ring, and you're level 20.  The bonus mana
you'd get from the ring would be (3*20)/5 = 12.  So, in this case, it
would be better to wear the +20 mana ring.  However, at level 40, the
bonus to mana from the +3 Int ring would be (3*40)/5 = 24, so by that
point, it would be better to wear the +3 Int ring.  
<p>Using this formula, you can figure out which items will give you the
most extra mana, and at what level you should trade that + mana item in
for a + Int item.
<p>Or, short answer, at lower levels + mana items are better, at higher
levels + Int items are better.
<p>Now, the exception to the rule, an Int over 200 gives you almost no
benefit (it does give you some, but not nearly as much).  So, if you
have a choice of an item that raises your Int above 200, or an item that
gives you more mana, you're probably better off with the mana item, even
at high levels.
