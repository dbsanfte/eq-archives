<li>A few items today:
<li>Added the rest of the velious spells to the spell lists.  As I
understand it, only Summon Monster I can be bought, the rest drop on mobs
in Velious.
<li>The Magician Best of the Best announcement was made, you can read it
<A href="botb.html">here</a>.  I'm looking forward to seeing if anyone can
come up with the equipment in "undiscovered areas, in unread books".

<li>Monster Summoning I can be found in one of the early Velious zones.  Its effect
is to summon a pet that looks like a random mob from the zone.  Conflicting reports
on whether it has the abilities of the monster it looks like or is just an elemental 
wrapped in someone else's clothing, but it's pretty cool nonetheless.  People have
reported getting everything up to and including giants as pets.
<li>Added Monster Summoning I to the spell lists.
<li>Added Summon Orb to the spell lists.

<li>December 5, 2000:

<li>Epic Quest Solved:  Congratulations to Norseh on E'ci for finishing the mage
Epic Quest.  The result is the spell Summon Orb, which summons this little,
feathery mace like 1hb weapon called the Orb of Mastery.
<li>Stats on the Orb of Mastery are: 20 damage/30 delay, Str +15, Dex +5, Sta
+10, Int +20, Mana +100, Sv Fire +20, Sv Cold +20, Sv Magic +10, 1 charge of 
Manifest Elements
<li>Manifest Elements summons a huge Elemental.  I've had conflicting reports that
it's always air, or that it is of a random type each time, but most agree it is
more powerful than anything else we can summon.

<li>December 4, 2000:
<UL>
<li>Removed Imbue Fire Opal from the spell lists
<li>Added Hornets from the Burning Woods to the list of summoned creatures
<li>Just for your imformation, Monster Summoning I-III are back in our 
spell lists.
<li>Well, tomorrow is the big day.  As soon as I have our new spells confirmed,
(along with their effects, hopefully), I'll add them to the lists.  As always,
if anyone (like someone over 30 who actually buys the expansion) has any
information, let me know.
