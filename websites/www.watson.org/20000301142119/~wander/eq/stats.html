This page discusses the various attributes, and the skills that Magicians
get, and their relevance to the Magician class.
<p><center><font size="+1"><b>Attributes</b></font></center>
<p><b>Strength:</b> This affects how much weight you can carry, and how much
damage you deal in melee combat.  Not useful for Magicians, since we get 
Dimensional Pockets/Holes and shouldn't be meleeing much after the mid-teens.
<p><b>Stamina:</b> Affects how many hit points and stamina points you have.
Useful after you've maxed out Intelligence.
<p><b>Agility:</b> Affects how often you're hit in combat.  About the same
usefulness as Stamina.
<p><b>Dexterity:</b> Affects how often you hit in combat, and how often any
special effects on your weapon go off.  Not useful.
<p><b>Wisdom:</b> Might have an effect on how well you resist mental spells 
(charm, etc.), and might have a slight effect on skill success.  Don't 
bother raising this.
<p><b>Intelligence:</b> Affects how much mana you have, as well as how often
your skill levels rise, and your chance of fizzling a spell.  The number one
statistic for Magicians. Raise this as much as you can, until it reaches 200 (at
which point the benefits drop off dramatically).
<p><b>Charisma:</b> Affects the prices you receive in shops, but the effect is
pretty minimal.  Worry about this after Intelligence, Stamina, and Agility, but
before Strength, Dexterity, or Wisdom.
<p><center><font size="+1"><b>Skills</b></font></center>
<p>This list doesn't include craft skills, hand to hand, swimming, sense heading,  
or alcohol tolerance, which are available to all classes.  In short, craft 
skills can be handy for getting money, hand to hand is useless, swimming is
useful, sense heading is invaluable, and alcohol tolerance is useless, but a
lot of fun.
<p><b>Offense, Defense:</b> These are combat skills that will go up naturally
with melee combat.  They're not too useful beyond the early levels, so don't
worry about them.  Max: Level*5
<p><b>Piercing, One Hand Blunt, Two Hand Blunt:</b> Combat skills for wielding
weapons.  You'll probably want to choose one of these and focus on them at
the lower levels, where you can actually do damage to an opponent without 
getting squashed in melee.  We can summon piercing and 2 hand blunt weapons, so
that might tip the scales a bit in their favor.  Ultimately, it won't matter,
because at higher levels you either won't hold any weapons in favor of items
like the Black Tome with Silver Runes, or will hold weapons just for the stat
bonuses (like the sacrificial dagger).  Max: (Level + 1)*3
<p><b>Throwing:</b>  Not too useful, but fun.  Since we can summon throwing
daggers, it's much less of a money sink for us than for other classes.  And 
it never hurts to be able to do a bit of damage from a distance once you're
out of mana.  Max: (Level + 1)*3
<p><b>Bind Wound:</b>  Very useful.  We can summon our own bandages, instead
of dropping 5 silver each for them like other classes.  Bandaging doesn't take
the place of a cleric, but it lets you survive being poisoned, conserve healer
mana, and reduce downtime.  Take the time to practice this.  You'll likely get 
enough training just through normal use, but if you feel the need, you can blast
yourself down to a sliver of life and bandage yourself back up (and practice your
casting skills as well).  Max: (Level + 1)*5
<p><b>Abjuration:</b>Used by our personal shields, personal armor, and fire
shield line of spells.  Probably won't need to practice it, but if you do 
feel the need, you can memorize Minor Shielding and cast away.  Max: (Level + 1)*5
<p><b>Alteration:</b> One of our less used schools of magic.  Used primarily
by Gate, Bind, and Burnout.  Since there are no cheap spells to practice this
with, it might be worth throwing a few training points into, just to avoid fizzling
gates and binds all the time.  Max: (Level + 1)*5
<p><b>Conjuration:</b> Our biggest school.  Our summons use it, our pets use it,
and some of our direct damage uses it.  Don't worry about practicing this, you'll
get more than enough practice just from summoning food and water at low levels. 
Max: (Level + 1)*5
<p><b>Evocation:</b> Our second biggest school.  Most of our direct damage, our
bolts, and our area effect spells use it.  Will get plenty of practice, except
at levels where our primary DD is conjuratoin based (8, 24, 44), but it will
catch up soon enough once you reach the next circle.  Max: (Level + 1)*5
<p><b>Divination:</b> Used by a handful of miscellanious spells, like invisibility.
Might be worth casting a full mana bar worth of Sense Summoned every once and a 
while.  Max: (Level + 1)*5
<p><b>Channeling:</b> Affects how often we regain our casting when inturrupted.
Will go up plenty fast, since it has a chance with every spell cast.  Contrary to
popular belief, Dexterity does not affect our chance to recover concentration.
Max: (Level + 1)*5
<p><b>Meditate:</b> At 4th level you will love this skill, by 10th level you
will be sick of staring at your spellbook.  Will go up fine on its own, you will
get more than enough practice. Max: (Level + 1)*5
<p><b>Research:</b> A real pain, but necessary.  You can't train it very far (only
1 point at level 16), but go back each level and put as many points as you can 
into it, since it's very difficult to find the components to practice it, even with
the practice research quest. Max: (Level - 15)*5
<p><b>Specialization:</b> There are actually 5 specialization skills, one for 
each school of magic.  Your specialization skill can reduce your chance of 
fizzling, and reduce mana cost of spells for the appropriate school if it
successfully checks.  It does not, contrary to popular belief, reduce casting
time.  These should train about as well as the same magic school (ie, easily for
conjuration and evocation, poorly for alteration).  Keep in mind that only one
of the five schools can go above 50, and it can't do that until you've put one
practie point into each of them to get them started.  You probably want 
Conjuration or Evocation to be the school that goes above 50.  Max: (Level + 1)*5
<p><b>Dodge:</b> By the time you get this, you shouldn't be in melee very 
much.  Still, it's nice to have an extra chance to avoid damage and spell
interruptions.  Probably worth dropping a few practice points into, since
hopefully you won't be getting swung at enough for it to go up quickly on its 
own.  Max: (Level + 1)*3
