<BODY>
<p>/pet as you were  -- Makes pet forget all other commands and clears
their aggro list.

<p>/pet attack  --  Pet will attack targetted creature

<p>/pet kill -- Same as pet attack.

<p>/pet back off -- Tells pet to quit attacking target.  Note that if a
monster attacks either you or the pet, the pet will start attacking again.

<p>/pet follow me  --  Pet will start following you (cancels any other
guard commands)

<p>/pet get lost - pet suicides

<p>/pet guard here -- Makes your pet stand in one one location and attack 
any NPC that comes near, including guards.  He will return to his original
location after the fight.

<p>/pet guard me  -- Pet follows you around and attacks any NPC that comes
near you.

<p>/pet who leader -- Pet says "XXX is my leader."  Used pretty much only
by Enchanters and others who can charm critters.

<p>/pet report health - Your pet will tell you what percentage of HP it
has left.  Useful, since you don't have to target your pet to find out how
close to death it is.

<p>/pet sit down -- Causes pet to sit in one place and rest much like you
would sitting down

<p>/pet stand up -- If your pet is sitting, he will stand up.  Personally,
I just use /pet follow instead of this.

<p>/pet target -- Targets your pet. (also works if you hit F1 twice)

<p>/pet taunt -- Your pet will taunt its targets.

<p>/pet no taunt -- Your pet will not taunt its targets.
