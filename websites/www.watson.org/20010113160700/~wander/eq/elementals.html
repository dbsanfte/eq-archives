<p>There's a lot of disagreement about the actual 
differences between the four elementals.  Many theories
have been presented attack rates, damage done, armor
class, avoidance, rate of bash/kicking, spell damage,
and so on.  About the only thing that everyone agrees
on is number of hit points (earth has most, followed
by water, then air, then fire).  Everything else is 
inconclusive, however, I'll try and present some of
the most popular opinions here.

<p><b>Earth:</b>  The earth elemental has the most
hit points of any of the elementals, and also casts
a root-type spell pretty frequently, that is pretty
tough to resist.  For these reasons, it's a popular
choice for soloing.  The popular belief (most empirical
evidence seems to support this) is that he gets hit more
often than the other three, due to low agility, but his 
extremely high HP make up for this.  The root spell does
not appear to do any damage, it's just a root.  GZ said 
once that the earth pet had the highest strength, though
all pets seem to have the same maximum damage, so the 
best guess is that the earth elemental hits for maximum
damage more often than the other three.  Tests of this
have been inconclusive.  Some people believe that the
earth pet has a lower attack rate than other pets, but
this has also not been shown conclusively.

<p><b>Water:</b>  The water elemental has nearly as 
many hit points as the earth elemental.  In addition,
it's agility is better (it gets hit less), and it has
a super fast regeneration.  These factors also make
it a popular soloing pet.  It casts a direct damage
spell, though how much damage this does in relation
to its attack and the DD spell of fire is unknown. 
Its strength and attack rate (if they are indeed
applicable and differ between the elementals) is
probably in the middle, between earth and air.

<p><b>Air:</b>  The air elemental is the opposite
of earth.  It has relatively few hit points, but
a higher agility, so it gets hit less often.  
Generally, this isn't enough to make up for its
lower hit points, so it won't last as long as an 
earth elemental, though.  In addition, it casts
a stun spell which, when successful, will always
stun a caster.  Thus, the air elemental is a popular
choice when fighting casters, especially in a group, 
when the elemental won't be taking many of the hits.
Many people say it also has a higher attack rate,
but again, tests of this sort have been inconclusive.
It also casts invisibility on itself, but since you
can do that with any of your pets, it's not that
worthwhile an addtion.

<p><b>Fire:</b>  The fire elemental has the fewest
hit points of any elemental, and only average 
agility (on par with water).  Thus, it tends to die 
rather quickly.  However, common belief is that 
it does the most damage of any elemental, through
a combination of high attack rate/strength and 
direct damage spells.  So, it's a popular choice in
full groups, where it's not in danger of taking too
many hits.  Also, it casts fire shield on itself, 
which is almost always better than the equivalent 
shield you can cast, which means anything attacking
the elemental will take significant damage.  If
you can keep him healed, most things will kill
themselves eventually by beating on your elemental.
