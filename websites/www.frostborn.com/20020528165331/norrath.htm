<p><font size="5" color="#C0C0C0">Antonica is the largest and most populated continent on
Norrath.&nbsp; The continent was known as Tunaria, until it was recently renamed
by the human ruler of the Free City of Qeynos, Antonius Bayle.&nbsp; It is on
Antonica where Tunare first placed Her High Elves.&nbsp; Antonica is also the
birthplace of the Halflings, Trolls, Ogres, and Humans.&nbsp; The evil stain of
Innoruuk, the Dark Elves, also call Antonica home.</font></p>

Gnomes.&nbsp; The High Elf</font><font size="5"> civilization
from Antonica also relocated to Faydwer after the death of the Elddar
Forest.&nbsp; Faydwer is also rumored to be the home of two of the oldest
creatures on all of Norrath, Mayong Mistmoore, the Elf-Vampire and Phinigel
Autropos, the last living Kedge.&nbsp; The name, Faydwer
was given to this continent by the High Elves of Antonica when they landed on
its shores.</font></font></p>

<p><font size="7" color="#FFFF00">Kunark</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="5" color="#C0C0C0">Kunark is a continent of ancient ruins and
hostile lands. Records tell tale of empires lost to time, their ruined cities
and hidden tombs still filled with treasures. The evil hand of Innoruuk touched
this land and spawned the Iksar, a powerful reptilian race. Once the predominant
force, they now strive to rise from the ashes and reclaim their glory. The
creatures in Kunark are quite formidable and regard all as invaders. Only the
elven outpost of Firiona Vie offers safe haven for adventurers. This is no place
for the weak.</font></p>

<p><font size="5" color="#C0C0C0">Odus was founded by a human named Erud who, along with his
followers, left Antonica searching for a place to establish a new enlightened
society. Like any &quot;enlightened&quot; conquerors, the Erudites took it upon
themselves to forcibly relocate the native inhabitants of Odus. The Kerra, a
once proud and noble feline race, have been pushed from their lush homeland to a
small island off the western coast of Odus.</font></p>

the earth and creating great scars in which she deposited them, to grow and
flourish. In later times, when ogres, giants and goblins had conquered much of
the planet, their arrogance in attempting an assault upon the Plane of Earth
brought retribution from The Rathe in the form of a great curse. The once
fertile homeland of the giants was frozen along with those of its surviving
inhabitants who were unable to flee. Only a group of shipwrecked dwarves managed
to find their way beyond the Frigid Barrier to reach the icy continent of
Velious, and they became the Coldain who were only recently rediscovered by the
gnomes of Ak`Anon, with the help of their marvelous ship, the Icebreaker.</font></p>
