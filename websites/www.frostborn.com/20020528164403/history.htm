In
the wastelands of the North, the strong and powerful mercilessly cut down the
weak and young that the frozen tundra has left barely alive.&nbsp; The eternal winter
is a battle from which only the strong of heart and body may survive.&nbsp; The souls
of those who perish in youth and those inexperienced in the harsh demands of
such a master have cried out for a protector.&nbsp; For time unknown, this spirit of
need has attempted to forge one able to guide those able to become strong, but
unfounded in the experience necessary to survive an unforgiving master. </font></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="4" face="Tempus Sans ITC"><o:p>

&nbsp;No-one
knows how these souls hammered the spirits of those still living, bending them
to grant unexpected mercy, saving a youth and putting them upon the path to
strength and wisdom.&nbsp; For such acts of mercy are swiftly punished in the barren
lands. And yet, within our own lifetime, such has happened. A soul was born, one
who knew that such acts of mercy are rewarded manyfold, in this lifetime and the
next.</font></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">

&nbsp;This
guide began as nothing more than a humble, adventurous youth.&nbsp; But his spirit
grew strong and his compassion grew as he saw injustice carried out by the
strong upon the weak and defenseless.&nbsp; He became justice in a land ruled by
strength alone. Wandering the lands of Norrath,&nbsp; he saw that the twisted
ways of darkness pervaded every land, every kingdom. And his spirit grew to
protect these foreign lands as well.&nbsp; Knowing that one man could not undo the
injustice of an entire land, a deep desire filled him to guide others to the
meaning of justice.&nbsp; Unbeknownst to him, whispers and rumors called him the Frost
Spirit for wherever he traveled he sought not glory but only to show others the
spirit of justice that dwells in all beings.</font></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="4" face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#C0C0C0">

time some began to be drawn to him, not to worship or serve him, but to learn of
the Justice the tortured souls of the Frozen North had forged into the spirit of
this man.&nbsp; He became the thread, weaving a tapestry from others lives.&nbsp;
He did not
weave the patterns of their lives, but each individual together to form a whole
that is greater than any one of their lives could be. Known for guarding the
ways of the Spirits of Frost, forgoing old allegiances to clan and country,
these protectors of justice became known as The Frostborn.</span></font><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="4" face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#000000">

that he could not be present in all places at all times, yet aware that those
sharing his calling were scattered across the face of Norrath, Falladar, the
Frost Spirit, formed a council of three.&nbsp; From among his followers, three felt
the spirits call to rise to the need of the now many Frostborn Protectors.&nbsp;
One
felt the need to become the Voice of the Frostborn and was known as the Frost
Lord, the two others as the Frost Knights.&nbsp; This triumvirate follows the spirit
of justice, embodied in the Frost Spirit.&nbsp; They guide those who feel the call of
Justice in their veins and decry all ties to Kings and Clans.&nbsp; These are the
Frostborn Guards, the carriers and executors of justice in all the lands of
Norrath.</font></span></font></span></b></p>
