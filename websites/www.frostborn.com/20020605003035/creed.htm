    The Frostborn Protectorate holds justice and honor in their hearts.  By following the   rules of the guild as well as the dictates of the Tribunal, we hope to gain the respect of all
for our guild. The burdens are not heavy, but they shall be observed with the
utmost care.</font>

<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="5" color="#CCCC00">No kill stealing.  It is dishonorable to take what another has earned.&nbsp; Vengeance towards another who hath unjustly dealt with thee is beneath the standards that Frostborn live by.  Justice is not served in such ways.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="5" color="#CCCC00">Whilst banding with others, act with honor.  Know thy job and perform it the best of thine ability.  Only those which hath grouped with a Frostborn shall be invited into the   guild for only then shall we have the measure of their worth.  Accordingly, they shall have the measure of our guild and an understanding of their worthiness to enter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="5" color="#CCCC00">When looting the spoils of our vanquished foes, thou shalt maintain the honour of the guild. All member of thine group shall be granted the ability to share in this bounty. Shouldst thou loot an item of great value, the entire party should be apprised and given the opportunity to receive those spoils in whatever manner hath been agreed upon. Not following this guideline is unjust and shall not be tolerated.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="5" color="#CCCC00">Thy guild mates are thine brothers and sisters.  Help them to the best of thy ability. Thou shouldst not abuse this most valuable of all resources.  They who continually beg for help are too weak to bear the mantle of Justice and
Honour.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="5" color="#CCCC00">Artifacts of Power are by no means outlawed, however numerous heirlooms shouldst not be bestowed upon the younger members of our family. Those of the Frostborn Protectorate live by the strength of our arms, the fortitude of our minds, and the will of
our gods. How glorious is the sword plucked from the twitching hands of thy vanquished foe, your brethren standing clustered around you bleeding, tired, and victorious!!</font></p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="5" color="#CCCC00">This Brotherhood is for those of a mature and responsible character.  Those wishing to join its ranks MUST have attained 15 levels of expertise in their chosen profession. Furthermore, initiates who desire the duties and rewards of the Guild must complete the   Rite of Passage which Shall include a minor quest determined by the Tribunal. While  these measure shall numbers of our brothers lower than many guilds, it shall ensure the
virtue of our Order.</font>
