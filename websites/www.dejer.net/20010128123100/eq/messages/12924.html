I am so surprise that they have the guts to do that, I tought that they would be afraid that the people that had it hard before would be mad at them.<br>

On a funny note look at what I posted on their forum last Tuesday : <a href='http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045899-6.html'>http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045899-6.html</a><br>

&quot;&quot; The problem is that the xp of a kill is distributed proportionelly to the xp of everyone. As a player you group with people around your level and that means for example that a Troll SK of the same level then a hafling warrior will end up eating a proportion of the xp the hafling would of got if he was hunting with a cleric for example. At this point you can see that both of them will level relatively at the same speed when togheter but that's only because the hafling isnt geting what he should be xp wise. This is where I see a contradiction, if you want the SK to level slower by design fine, but don't penalise the warrior for it. Both of these people agreed to the cost/bonus that came with their choice of race/class but it turns out that one of them is cheated of that with the actual group/xp  distribution. They could of easly give equal proportion to each member and multiply it by a class/race modifier. That way soloing or grouping with hybrids wouldn't change a thing. Don't get me wrong most people don't care for it, you group with people for their company not for what they bring to your xp (atleast the people I hang with are like that  ) but it's still a bad design. Either you make every class level at the same speed or you make sure they level at their own speed without interfering on others. &quot;&quot;<br>

What they did is the best reply I could ever wished for ;) .<br>
