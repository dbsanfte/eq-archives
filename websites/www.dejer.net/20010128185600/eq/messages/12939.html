Guys,<br>
<br>
I've come to the decision of starting my quest for my epic weapon, and I need the help of my friends to do it.  Granted, it will be a LONG process for me, as the hardest thing I'll need to get is the Soul Leech, which drops off of Cazic Thule himself.<br>
<br>
My first order of business is an NPC named Kurron Ni, in the outpost in The Overthere zone.  I must give him a darkforge breastplate, leggings, and helm, and 900 platinum.  After that, he attacks me and we kill him.  He will have a note on him that I need to take to Duriel in Paineel.<br>
<br>
I sat in EC this weekend for quite some time, and, with Slyth's kindness, have all the pieces I need to begin, except the help of my friends to kill this guy.  From what I've read, it'll take no more than 2 good groups to smoke him.<br>
<br>
If for some reason you can't make it, I'll understand, but if you can spare an hour or two to help me out, I'd be grateful.<br>
<br>
I'd like to do it sometime this week, if at all possible, and on a night that we have nothing planned, as I don't wanna get in the way of anything else.<br>
<br>
Please let me know..<br>
<br>
