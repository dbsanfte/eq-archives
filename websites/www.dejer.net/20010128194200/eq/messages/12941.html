Greetings All,<br>
<br>
<br>
Busy weekend in Sky.  We finished up to 3 on Friday night, and continued through to finish Five Saturday.  We farmed the Spiroc Lord for a couple hours and obtained four (or five) of his blades for our warrior epics.<br>
<br>
We also got some quest items, and indeed, several people were finally able to finish a quest.  Congrats :)<br>
<br>
We also got some other nice stuff.  I don’t recall it all, but Cyriakus, Lamani, Fonceur, Valor, Williahm, and Sariden (at least) got haste belts.  Ayame got a Symbol of Mar, awesome neck piece.  I can’t quite remember the other loot we got, but all in all a very successful outing.<br>
<br>
We go further in sky, each time we go.  That was only our third sky adventure, and we managed to clean up five with little difficulty.  We’ll move to six next time, and who knows, maybe become UBER! :p<br>
<br>
Yesterday we spent some time in Howling Stones getting exp.  Coem got a Bloodpoint.  I don’t remember much else dropping, but the exp is always nice in there.  Managed to regain sky exp losses very quickly.<br>
<br>
We still have some people without HS keys.  Gimbor, Sariden, and no doubt others.  You guys Really need to get a fang hunt organized.  There is NOTHING like having that place essentially to yourselves.<br>
<br>
I spent some time pulling Guardian Wurms in Skyfire in the hopes of obtaining spells.  We didn’t get any spells, but those things are level 60 and are mean.  Hit for over 500.  They spawn in / around VP entrance and there is a madhouse of mobs in that area.<br>
<br>
Hunt Priorities in the coming days / weeks (in no particular order)<br>
<br>
Zordak Watch:  Still need to whack him a few times, and camping him in Sol B seems to be the only answer.<br>
<br>
Kael Arena:  Had a good time there, got some nice items to drop, would love to spend some real raid / quality time there to do the place right.  Having CoH would be very nice, as they see invis and getting people into camp is difficult.<br>
<br>
Chardok King / Queen:  Need to get king notes and queen blades.  Gonna take a good day to do this right.  For comparison purposes, the first king raid we did we got owned.  The second king raid we did, we owned the place and got four notes with little / no problems.  I look forward to this same pattern next time we go down there.<br>
<br>
Severillous:  Would be nice to claim the green dragon one of these days.  He fell last night I believe, so not sure when to try again.<br>
<br>
Miscellaneous Hunts:  Druid / Ranger epic fights in EK (corruptor), SK fight in OT.  Hole / CoM raid for shaman.  Pawbuster for Monk.<br>
<br>
Venril Sathir:  We really need to get him again, for epic pieces and leggings hopefully.<br>
<br>
PoG Raid:  Need to get some new armors for our monks, warriors, clerics, sk’s, etc.<br>
<br>
Hate is scheduled for Tuesday the 23rd (next Tuesday).<br>
<br>
Fear is scheduled for Tuesday, Feb. 6th.<br>
<br>
As you can see, we have quite a bit on our plate :)<br>
