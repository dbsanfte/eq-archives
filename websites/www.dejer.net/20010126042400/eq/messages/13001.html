With the features I'm planning to have, customizing someone's open sorce is just not really an option. It would actually take longer to recode the features I want, than it would to just start from scratch. Also, as you indicated, I have yet to dabble with anything related to PHP. As far as working with other board systems, the one you are looking at right now is based off Matt's origional WWWBoard. So, as you can see, I've been there and done that. This time, I need to work from scratch, as there is just so much that I want to do. It could take weeks to find an existing board that I could modify with the least effort.<br>
