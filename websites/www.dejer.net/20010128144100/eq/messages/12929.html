All of the experience penalties that were associated with hybrids in groups (If a hybrid joined the group, the whole group would be penalized for the experience requirement) will be lifted, and because the Troll SK has an additional experience requirement, will get an added experience bonus compared to a human cleric or whatever.<br>
<br>
Lets say<br>
<br>
Troll SK and Human Cleric group up..<br>
<br>
They make a kill together and get 100 experience points<br>
<br>
because of the added END TOTAL of experience needed to make lvl 60 by the Troll SK, the troll gets his 50 points of the kill, with a .4% (or whatever the percentage difference of END TOTAL exp needed between a troll SK and a human cleric) additional experience out of thin air, and the human cleric gets his 50 points of experience from the kill, without any additional exp out of thin air.<br>
<br>
Hmm.. I Hope I explained that right.<br>
<br>
From what I understand... all the experience penalties to groups are being removed for the penalized classes, and all the classes with a percent of experience penalties, are having that same percentage added to their exp per kill &quot;out of thin air&quot; to compensate.<br>
<br>
This is by far a good thing for everyone..  Geaden says he needs to get his exp in before the patch, but if you do that, your just shooting yourself in the foot, where all the exp you gain until this goes live, is the penalized exp... if you wait and power run for exp AFTER the bonuses, you'll get more exp faster than you would if you did it now.<br>
