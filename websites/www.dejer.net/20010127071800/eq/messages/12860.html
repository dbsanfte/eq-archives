:<p>
it's all some enhancements, most good, possibly a nerf for the Trueshot discipline =(<br>
<br>
BUT the snare change is gonna affect gameplay ALOT.<br>
a) it will most likely enhance grouping, so a snared mob will stay snared, no matter what happens<br>
b) A necro can now use his Darkness DOT on a rooted mob<br>
<br>
but now prolly the sad part (altough it is GREAT for you soloing druids): this change will make druids even better at soloing, virtually minimizing any risk.<br>
They used to have the option between snare/kiting, using mainly nukes; and DOT parking which was more mana efficient but had a lil more risk of not getting a root through when the mob is beating on the fragile druid. Now those damn druids have PLENTY on time to reroot a mob after root broke cuz it will be walking at them. Shamans (shamen?) have always been known using the root/dot method, and they were the best at it thanks to their superior AC, slightly better dots and a slow on the mobs making it more easy to get a root through; but now druids wont even have to bother about a root breaking, esp not with a 1.5 casting time root.<br>
<br>
I just think verant just made it too easy again for a class to solo. Though it will fix problems caused while grouping (think of the earth pet...i bet Sly and Mak will love it).<br>
