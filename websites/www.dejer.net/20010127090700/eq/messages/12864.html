I don't really know why its Noble Blade and not Noble Spirit, it seems there was still a debate going that brought this up, to be honnest I don't care I'm just glad this thing is finally done it has been quite the saga. At first it will seems strange but it won't take long that we won't even think about it. I'd like to know who is officer though so the people that needs invite can know who to ask .<br>

Atleast Noble Blade started its history in glory by killing Cazic last night =) .<br>
