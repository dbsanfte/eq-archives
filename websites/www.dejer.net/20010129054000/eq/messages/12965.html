<I>*sigh* ok.  Here's hoping for no flames.</I>

<P>Well, I would hope no one flames you for expressing your concerns.  

<P><I>A while ago (about 3 weeks now?) I said I would give the merger a chance (on a personal level).</I>

<P><I>Well, I was in NH for a week.  I am now not guilded.  Not that I didn't like NH, it just wasn't for me.. here's my observations:</I>

<P><I>1) From my PoV, NH is extremely well put together.  With SB & NH together, there is massive firepower there (too bad we still can't organize a raid in under 6 hours) .. hehe, just kidding</I>

<P>Yes, this one of the reasons for the merger (but not the only one).  As one guild we can do things much easier and faster than we could as an alliance.

<P><I>2) NH isn't afraid to go after what they want. (Neither were/are we.. I'm just pointing out my observations)</I>

<P>Well they are at least not afraid to say what they want.

<P><I>3) In the week I was with them I really didn't hear or see or read about any complaints against them as a guild.  They go after what they want with little to no "stepping on toes" of others in zone or otherwise.</I>

<P>Yes, NH has a good reputation.  As good as SB has always tried to have.  

<P><I>4) NH is a bit d00d-ish.</I>

<P>Hmm, well yes.  I think at least half of it is said in joke/mockery of doods though.  

<P><I>5) They talk A LOT.</I>

<P>Well, actually I think it is the combination of the 2 guilds that talk alot.  From what I understand,  while yes thier /gu was more active than ours was before the merger, it is more active now.

<P><I>6) If'n you ain't on the raid, don't bother /gu'ing anything.</I>

<P>Unfortunitly, this is true to some extent.  But not totally.  Yes, /gu it used for communication on raids, but that does not mean that it can not be used for other conversations as well.  

<P><I>7) If'n you're not of sufficient level to go on the raid, don't bother turning on /gu.</I>

<P>Well, depends on how much spam you like to deal with =)

<P><I>I know those last two are harsh, and I really don't mean them that way.  It's just a difference in play style.</I>

<P><I>My play style is:
<BR>1) I could only slightly care less if I go to the planes.  I really just want to say I've been there.
<BR>2) I want to try and find the most incredible landscape in Everquest and watch the sun come up and go down there.
<BR>3) I want to see all the different types of monsters and take at least one on toe-to-toe.
<BR>4) I want to go see a dragon again(without killing the whole zone in the process)
<BR>5) I want to do these things with friends.</I>

<P><I>Don't get me wrong too.. I want that xp! That's my key to those things.  I need xp to live in PoG or to see the sunrise in PoA.  Items and XP are nice, but they're still only tools to get what I want out of EQ - not goals.</I>

<P>Well, my playstyle is basically I want to have fun with my friends.  If it were not for SB and now NB I would have quit this game a long time ago, if I had even bothered to start playing it.  I personally find raids to be fun.  But I can also just sit in town for hours and talk to friends.  At heart, I am a power-gamer.  I don't know if that is a surprise to anyone of you at all or not.  I want the big toys and the be level 60.  But more important than than those things is I want to have fun doing it, and make friends.

<P><I>So, anyway.. Here I am, left wondering:
<BR>1) Should I bite my tongue and join NB (if, after this post I still could)</I>

<P>Well, maybe not if its biting your tongue.  I would welcome you to the guild, and I don't think this post will change anyones view of you.  But if you are not happy in the guild, then maybe its not for you.  I certainly hope you join us.

<P><I>2) Should I go back to SB .. I've been keeping my eye on /who all sb and it looks pretty lonely.
<BR>3) Should I join another guild?  Do I really want to?</I>

<P>Well, I hope that you do not.  I want to see you in /gu.  But you have to do what is right for you also.

<P>I know that the game between levels 1-46 and 47-60 changes quite a bit.  Its almost a new game.  At least it has been for me.  I find that exp really isn't that big a concern to me anymore.  Sure, right now I want to get up to 55, but I'm not really rushing to do it.

<P><I>Again. I meant this in no way other than just presentind my feelings in hopes someone would fix this for me.. or point out something I'm not considering.  I'm kinda bummed out after going to castersrealm and not seeing my name as a member of SB (or anyone's for that matter)</I>

<P>Well, I don't know if I can fix this for you or not.  If I can please tell me how.  I don't know wat happened to the guild listing at Caster's Realm, but it was never really an offical listing.  It was probably removed because the person who ran the listing (Cow) switch thier char to a NB listing.
