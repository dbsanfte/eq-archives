Hey Dej, unless you are just really keen on writing a new board, you might want to check out some of the existing free boards out there.<br>
<br>
The one I would recommend if you are not opposed to using PHP is called Phorum, and can be found at <a href='http://phorum.org.'>http://phorum.org.</a>  It is an open-source project so you can customize it however you want and all that.  I know personally the founder of the project -- he happens to be my cousin and also works for me here at dealnews.<br>
<br>
As a fellow coder, I understand the desire to DIY, though, and especially if you don't want to mess around with learning or installing a new scripting language.  But I just thought I'd let ya know in case you were interested.<br>
<br>
Good luck with the project, however you choose to do it.  I know it will rock in the end :)<br>
