Blast from the past!  Lol hiyas Rog.<br>
<br>
Nah I've all but dropped out of EQ.  The race to 60 has lost it's appeal hehe.<br>
<br>
I'm not even sure Shadowbane will make it lol.  It sounds great and all but by the time they get finished with it everyone will probably be like &quot;Shadowbane?  Oh I think I read about that in a ad 2 years ago.&quot;  a la Diablo 2.<br>
<br>
As for Erudites...don't try them or humans as your first char...try High Elf, Halfling, Troll, or Dark Elf...those are the easiest places to start off.<br>
<br>
Ah well...see yas!  *wave* :)
