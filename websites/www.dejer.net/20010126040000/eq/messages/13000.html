I already have a somewhat working JavaChat up, but if you have a company that likes to block websites, it may not work for you from work. I know it doesn't work from my workplace.<br>

I personally don't like any form of JavaChat. The windows are commonly too small for mass conversations, and they will only work with local IRC. Basically, I have yet to find a JavaChat script that will allow you to log into someone elses IRC server. Not to mention the IRC servers that offer JavaChat are normally some of the weakest I've seen, as far as bandwith. Cross Browser compatability is also a big problem with JavaChat.<br>
