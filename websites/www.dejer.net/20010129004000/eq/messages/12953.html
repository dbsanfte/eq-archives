Maybe it was just late and Absor wasn't too awake...<br>
<br>
<br>
And let’s say that the cleric dies and loses 1,000 experience points. So the ranger dies and with the new changes he will lose 1,400 experience points.<br>
<br>
So they go out, independently, and kill a monster, each earning 100 experience.<br>
<br>
The cleric gets 100 experience from it, and he’ll need 10 kills to regain his loss.  The ranger gets 100 * 1.4= 140 experience from it, and he’ll need 10 kills to regain his loss.<br>
<br>
Whereas before the ranger would only lose 1,000 experience, but he would also only gain 100 back for the kill.<br>
<br>
<br>
*scratches head*<br>
<br>
So, before if I lost 1k xp and killed a 100 xp monster I'd need 10 of them.<br>
<br>
And NOW, if I lost 1.4k xp and killed a 100xp monster I'll get 140, thus still needing 10 kills.<br>
<br>
This is an improvement? I guess when you look at &quot;The Bigger Picture&quot; it is.. if I don't die I get more xp.<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh well.. don't get me wrong, I'm REALLY looking forward to the change.. but it doesn't really seem like that big of a change.<br>
<br>
And what's our other big issue? Overcrowding.  Now as everyone shoots up to 60 what's going to happen when you think of &quot;The Big Picture&quot;?
