WHY people even propose need before greed?  Isn't the whole group (assuming its pickup and not guild) there for the purpose of Loot and Experiance?  Why would the cleric join a group thats going to a spot that only some other classes loot drops?<br>
<br>
Assuming its a pickup group I've ALWAYS avocated 100% rolling for everyone. But keep the roll to the end of the group then random whatever and whatever amount of loots that drops those top X people get to pick the items.<br>
<br>
I know that more than Half the people in NB would probably give another Main character the loot than drop it onto a twink, why not let those 30+ people help you rather than see someone else get it by &quot;default&quot;.  Not that they didn't help emensly getting the item, but didn't the other 5 people in the group?<br>
<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, but if a group says Need before greed in the beginging, make sure to /report that (hehe) so that when they decide to roll you can use that to /petition and get them banded for Ninja Looting! *snicker*<br>
<br>
No realy, I HATE need before greed. I've never been to someplace that drops only caster gear, well I take that back, the hole is caster only gear mostly.. and untill the EXP patch no one ever went there except for raids... Go Figure, Melee and Clerics drive grouping, you get steered into going to places that drop Melee/Cleric gear untill someplace offeres ungodly exp bonuses or a raid is forming.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ohh well to recap: Strenth of Numbers=Good, NBFG=Good when everyone's friends or guildies, NBFG=Not Fair to everyone in most cases.<br>
<br>
<br>
And Everyone knows I'm not one to keep nice things to myself, sure my warriors got a few nice things, but they are not &quot;uber&quot; and Makiah's got a few decently twinked characters (40ish twinking when they are about 30ish)  But if I get something &quot;NICE&quot; I've given it to someone that needed it.  The only thing I want in return is a THANK YOU, and consideration if something that I would like drops.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thats my rant on that topic..<br>
