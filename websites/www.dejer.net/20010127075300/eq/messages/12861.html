unless i misunderstood what they were saying, Rain now has to worry about something casting root on her.  Use to be able to just zoom past spiders or what not and in duels not worry bout snare or root affecting me unless I accidently let selos drop.  The selos thing saved me several times from spider roots and ghoul roots (fun to zone after you have been &quot;rooted&quot;  since song drops as you zone, you then become rooted on the safe side &quot;hopefully&quot; of the zone).  Actually im assuming snare in that, it was a shadowknight darkness snare thingie that wouldnt go into affect on me til selos dropped even though it did stick, so im assuming snare would be likewise since root works that way too.<br>
