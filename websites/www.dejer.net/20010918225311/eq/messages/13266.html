MULTI PLAYER BATTLETECH ! ! ! !<br>
<br>
ok...I know most of you people that still find the time to read this board probably don't have any idea what that set of words means...<br>
<br>
Let me explain a little...when I first got into multiplayer games I started in a WW2 air combat game called Airwarrior. It was played on the old GEnie online network and we paid by the hour to play. After playing for a while I looked at some of the other games offered and found MPBT. This was a multiplayer game based in the Battletech universe and used a modified version of the original Mechwarrior game by EA. In this game you chose which of the 5 houses you wanted to fight for then worked your way up in the ranks. It was possible to gain command of a mech company...even a battalion or regiment. If you chose to you could even choose to me a mercenary and own your own mechs...fighting for whoever paid you the most. I really liked the game and became a battalion commander before finally giving it up due to the high cost.<br>
<br>
Kesmai kept promising to bring it back but all they managed was a very limited version of the game that only allowed you to play against other people on one planet...Solaris 7. After a while I gave up sending emails to Kesmai asking if they would ever bring the full game back. Well today...while wandering the net I went to Gamestorm...Kesmai's online site and gaming network. There I found a link that said MPBT-3025...following this link I went to EA's site and signed up. MPBT is in pre-beta...going into closed beta soon they say. From the screenshots they have there they are not using any of the other Mechwarrior engines but have made a new one for this game. The graphics are good...alot better than Kesmai's version and I am hoping the game will beworth playing when it is released. It is as the original game was...with the ability to move up and gain commands...and take over space invading other House's territories.<br>
<br>
I for one will definately be playing this game when it comes out since I am a big Battletech fan. I am posting this in case anyone else is a fan and would be interested in playing a Battletech game online.<br>
