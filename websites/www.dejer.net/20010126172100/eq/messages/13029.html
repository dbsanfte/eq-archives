Need before Greed and whoever wins give whatever piece it replaces for the group to random.<br>
<br>
 The problem with random all is that its frustrating when you see farmers, and people geting stuff for their lvl 10 twinks win. When I was at Rylgor I was hearing people saying how they made thousands of pp selling the stuff and one even left the group for 15 min to go buy something, another won a BP and when the spear drop he won and didnt want to give the bp away saying it wasnt the same kind of loot( he couldnt use both item). Basically I was in groups with people that won a few times and others had nothing. I saw another guy kill a named one geting the rare drop but he did all that solo away from group that was fighting a bit deeper in a cave and kept the loot arguing he got it alone. Basically when there is good loot involve its almost a must to state the loot system before hand, that way no heated loot discussion will come messing your time. The biggest problem is that its not everywhere the same, if it was things would tend to get equal. Plus we can say whatever we want of armored classes geting more loot but the truth is they also need the gear more, their weapons are their spells but it seems fair that they give away the piece they are replacing when its possible.<br>
<br>
Well all that to say that loot will always be the center of many disputes. I have seen so many that now I look at this whole thing from a distance, I basically don't care as much about it and the game is alot more fun =) .<br>
