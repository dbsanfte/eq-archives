Ok, I started working on a new board script last night. Some of the features i plan to include are following:<br>
<br>
Login Recognition: Basically, I will be using a single, non-encroaching cookie. This will be used to determine who you are. Loging in will write the cookie to your machine, and loging out will delete it. It's basically what EZ has ATM.<br>
<br>
Custom view configuration: You will be able to choose from 3 styles of viewing messages.<br>
First: This is the way my current board looks.<br>
Second: This is the way EZ looks.<br>
Third: This is similar to the first, except the thread will be expandable using DHTML. I currently only have a good working model for IE, Netscape requires Javascript to do this, and I can not figure out a way to have both up at once.<br>
<br>
Advanced History: I know one of the negatives of my current board is the lack of history. On the new system, I will have it set up such that it will hold 1 million thread before it needs to overite anything. This is PER BOARD. The history will be searchable, but that's something on the back burner.<br>
<br>
New Messages: Because you will have the option of loging in, your profile will maintain what messages you have seen. There will also be an option of having updated thread move to the top of the page or not, your choice.<br>
<br>
HTML: I will most likely change my current system to include HTML coding without having to click a checkbox. My thoughs ATM are to have an option that will turn off the feature that automatically converts Carrage Returns to BReak statements. For those that know HTML, you will know what I am refering to.<br>
<br>
I also want to make the automatic link convertion a little more intuitive. To the point that it will not interferre with HTML coded links, but will still work with simple references.<br>
<br>
I WILL NOT INCLUDE THOSE STUPID SMILY FACE CONVERSION TO IMAGES!!!<br>
<br>
If you can think of some other things you would like to see, or some things that you really hate about my system or EZBoards, now is the time to let me know.<br>
