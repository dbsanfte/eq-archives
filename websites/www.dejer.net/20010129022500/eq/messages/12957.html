*sigh* ok.  Here's hoping for no flames.<br>
<br>
A while ago (about 3 weeks now?) I said I would give the merger a chance (on a personal level).<br>
<br>
Well, I was in NH for a week.  I am now not guilded.  Not that I didn't like NH, it just wasn't for me.. here's my observations:<br>
<br>
1) From my PoV, NH is extremely well put together.  With SB & NH together, there is massive firepower there (too bad we still can't organize a raid in under 6 hours) .. hehe, just kidding<br>
<br>
2) NH isn't afraid to go after what they want. (Neither were/are we.. I'm just pointing out my observations)<br>
<br>
3) In the week I was with them I really didn't hear or see or read about any complaints against them as a guild.  They go after what they want with little to no &quot;stepping on toes&quot; of others in zone or otherwise.<br>
<br>
4) NH is a bit d00d-ish.<br>
<br>
5) They talk A LOT.<br>
<br>
6) If'n you ain't on the raid, don't bother /gu'ing anything.<br>
<br>
7) If'n you're not of sufficient level to go on the raid, don't bother turning on /gu.<br>
<br>
I know those last two are harsh, and I really don't mean them that way.  It's just a difference in play style.<br>
<br>
My play style is:<br>
1) I could only slightly care less if I go to the planes.  I really just want to say I've been there.<br>
2) I want to try and find the most incredible landscape in Everquest and watch the sun come up and go down there.<br>
3) I want to see all the different types of monsters and take at least one on toe-to-toe.<br>
4) I want to go see a dragon again(without killing the whole zone in the process)<br>
5) I want to do these things with friends.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong too.. I want that xp! That's my key to those things.  I need xp to live in PoG or to see the sunrise in PoA.  Items and XP are nice, but they're still only tools to get what I want out of EQ - not goals.<br>
<br>
So, anyway.. Here I am, left wondering:<br>
1) Should I bite my tongue and join NB (if, after this post I still could)<br>
2) Should I go back to SB .. I've been keeping my eye on /who all sb and it looks pretty lonely.<br>
3) Should I join another guild?  Do I really want to?<br>
<br>
Again. I meant this in no way other than just presentind my feelings in hopes someone would fix this for me.. or point out something I'm not considering.  I'm kinda bummed out after going to castersrealm and not seeing my name as a member of SB (or anyone's for that matter)<br>
