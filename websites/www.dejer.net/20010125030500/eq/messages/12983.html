Actually the cookies are gonna be controled viea Perl, not Fortra... sorry, I ment Javascript. At any rate, yes the cookie will be set without an experation date. Sorry I didn't make that a bit clearer. Basically, if you have someone else that uses your PC, you will simply have to log-off to remove the cookie. I'm probably also going to put an option in the person profile for the cookie. So that if you don't want the cookie stored between sessions, it won't be.<br>
