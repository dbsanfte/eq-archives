You coulda asked me...<br>
<br>
But to let Zaron off the hook, I was telling him to hurry the hell up and join the port out group so we could get Takhen to the ground to pick up the shaman, so the innoruuk hammer wouldn't rot.  He prolly just forgot in the midst of all that hectic stuff.  Next time don't log out in hate ;)<br>
