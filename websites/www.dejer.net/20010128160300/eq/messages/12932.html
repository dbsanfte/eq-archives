If you previously had an experience penalty, say 40%, instead of changing the exp tables, and making us all level 60, they are multiplying the experience penalty times the experience per kill to effectively remove the penalty....<br>
<br>
<br>
SK previosly had 40% penalty.<br>
<br>
SK kill something worth 100 base experience points.<br>
<br>
His experience / level table still reflects the 40% penalty which is not changing...<br>
<br>
so his experience for the kill is increased by the 40% penalty to compensate for the unchanged exp tables.<br>
<br>
he gets 140 exp. points.<br>
<br>
There is no need to plevel prior to a patch.<br>
<br>
I would also like to say a couple more things on this topic.<br>
<br>
1) Anybody who ever discriminated against a class / race combo for a group, based on a very mathematically small exp penalty, is somebody I would never want to play with anyways.  I have never played this game with a calculator at my side, and based my friendships on the push of a button.<br>
<br>
2) We all want to level, we all like to level, but please remember having 60 may not be as fun as obtaining 60.  60 is IT.  I'll be glad when I'm sixty, but I am in no way racing to sixty.  Having may not be nearly as pleasurable as Wanting.  Having full level 50 for a month or two prior to kunark was BORING.  That first ding for 51 was EXCITING.<br>
