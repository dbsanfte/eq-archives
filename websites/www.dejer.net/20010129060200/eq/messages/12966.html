Just gonna talk about your points I have something to say about, and maybe wrap something up at the end:<br>
<br>
&gt; 4) NH is a bit d00d-ish.<br>
<br>
I agree with raifin, the 'doodspeak' is for laughs.  I can't think of one honest 'dood.'<br>
<br>
&gt; 5) They talk A LOT.<br>
<br>
There is quite a bit of /giuldsay, and really, I like it :)  Many times its just joking around, many times is discussing the workings of a raid, many times its somebody asking for advice or assistance.  Its community.<br>
<br>
&gt; 6) If'n you ain't on the raid, don't bother /gu'ing anything.<br>
<br>
&gt; 7) If'n you're not of sufficient level to go on the raid, don't bother turning on /gu.<br>
<br>
This really isn't accurate.  I notice 99% of /gui and answer when I can.  Raifin is right, if you are trying to get a timely answer from somebody specific, use a /tell.  Sometimes, especially during raids, we have lots of fights, and between /guildspam and /guildsay and everything else being shouted / ooc in the zone, you can miss things all too easily.<br>
<br>
As for /gui, its not like we own it.  Please use it for your own purposes if you believe /groupsay is inadequate (as it generally is for us as we have multi-groups).  I like to see what you guys are up to :)<br>
<br>
If raid spam is distracting you, as it probably distracts all of us at some time, then turn it off, that doesn't mean you don't belong with us, it just means you want some peace and quiet for a change :)<br>
<br>
&gt;I know those last two are harsh, and I really don't mean them that way. It's just a difference in play style.<br>
<br>
&gt;My play style is:<br>
&gt;1) I could only slightly care less if I go to the planes. I really just want to say I've been there.<br>
<br>
I didn't care much either when I was 40'ish.  I cared about keeping us together, getting quest armors, and leveling.  Planes were a far off mystery.<br>
<br>
&gt; 2) I want to try and find the most incredible landscape in Everquest and watch the sun come up and go down there.<br>
<br>
Ok :)<br>
<br>
3) I want to see all the different types of monsters and take at least one on toe-to-toe.<br>
<br>
Me too :)<br>
<br>
4) I want to go see a dragon again(without killing the whole zone in the process)<br>
<br>
I want to kill it :)<br>
<br>
5) I want to do these things with friends.<br>
<br>
This is everything we want to do too.<br>
<br>
&gt;Don't get me wrong too.. I want that xp! That's my key to those things. I need xp to live in PoG or to see the sunrise in PoA. Items and XP are nice, but they're still only tools to get what I want out of EQ - not goals.<br>
<br>
&gt;So, anyway.. Here I am, left wondering:<br>
<br>
&gt;1) Should I bite my tongue and join NB (if, after this post I still could)<br>
&gt;2) Should I go back to SB .. I've been keeping my eye on /who all sb and it looks pretty lonely.<br>
&gt;3) Should I join another guild? Do I really want to?<br>
<br>
Zacharus, this is transition time.  I'll do whatever I can to help you guys through it.<br>
<br>
Yes, I think you should join NB.  Because we are all here with you, and we have a lot more cool people from NH to befriend and make this stuff that much more fun.<br>
<br>
Yes, you guys are behind us, but as Raifin said, you got a nice crew going with Leesa, Cervantes, Alarial (when Vican is tired of Vican), Beja.  Byen isn't too much ahead of you guys.  Terrillian and Darianis are somewhat returned to us from taking a break.  And I think we are about ready to open up invites, if you guys have some friends you wish to have join us.<br>
<br>
Hell, when you think of it, you have almost as much people around 40 as we ever did at those levels, and I still spent over 50% of my time then /lfg with people I didn't know at the time.  Things can only get better.<br>
<br>
We've spoken more than once, before this merger was heard of, that the 30's - 40's have a lot of potential and need you guys to pull together and get things organized.<br>
<br>
Staying behind in a guild of 5 people won't change that.  Moving to another guild with most probably the same mix of levels we have now, won't change that either.<br>
<br>
This is a transition for all of us, please don't give up.  This new guild is as much yours as mine.<br>
