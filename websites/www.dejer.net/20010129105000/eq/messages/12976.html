Glad I'm not the only bandie from way back when. Never went to band camp, just had no desire to do so. I do remember one year at the Huntsville State competition, it was so freeg'n cold it was beyond miserable. Take a band from Houston where it MIGHT reach freezing, and place them in 10 degree weather. To make matters worse, we were one of 10 selected to re-show for places. We wound up taking 5th... I've never been so proud and so miserable all at the same time.<br>
