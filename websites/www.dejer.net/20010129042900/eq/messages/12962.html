of leveling.<br>
<br>
When you die, you lose a 'percentage' or rationed share of your current level, based on exp charts.<br>
<br>
As our ranger chart will still reflect the 40% penalty, and we will be gaining exp with a 40% bonus (compared to today's numbers) to effectively remove this penalty this is the scenario.<br>
<br>
You have 1,000 exp points.<br>
<br>
When you die you lose 1% total exp.<br>
<br>
before patch:<br>
<br>
You lose 10 exp points.  You can gain them back at the same old rate you did before with the 40% exp penalty.<br>
<br>
Lets say it takes 10 kills to get it back.<br>
<br>
after patch:<br>
<br>
You lost 10 * 1.4 = 14 experience points, as you gain the exp back without the 40% exp penalty.<br>
<br>
Takes the same 10 kills to get it back.<br>
<br>
This is a no-gain situation for the death penalty vs. gaining it back.  Which is the point.<br>
<br>
We are gaining on advancement, but they did not want us to get an extra benefit of losing 10 exp upon death, and gaining 14 back as a result of the new removal of the penalty, essentially, wanting to keep the 1% exp death penalty intact.<br>
