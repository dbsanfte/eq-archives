I've been dead too.  My g/f leaves tonight, but next wednesday I will be going down to DC for some Ball I have to go to and get dressed up. Ill get some pics to share with ya.  I will be back Sunday and I EXPECT Zach to be in hell or out of it :P<br>
<br>
I got out of hell and parked in DL's @ Karnors. Ill be on tonight, but tomorrow I am running this rogue event on our server.  Depends on the turnout.  If there isnt a lot of people then Ill just cancel it.<br>
