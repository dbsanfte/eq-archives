Ahh  yes, the people at work stories, man I miss those!  Got an interesting one myself, it just happened yesterday.  I got a call yesterday from a lady in our customer support area.  She said that she needed my help, and I said what can I do for you?  She asked, &quot;What do you call that thing that pops up when you are waiting on the computer?&quot;  I'm thinking WTF are you talking about, so I ask, &quot;When you're waiting on it??&quot; To which she responded, &quot;Yeah, the thing that looks like an egg timer.&quot;  I said, &quot;Hourglass?&quot;  She said, &quot;Yeah!!  That's it!&quot;  *click*
