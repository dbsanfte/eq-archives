It's a classic line from American Pie.<br>
<br>
I didn't think I was going to enjoy American Pie, but it really did turn out good..<br>
<br>
and I use this line all the time.. the scene that makes this line hilarious is something I wouldn't want to spoil, unless there's NO way you'll ever see the movie .. and you're not easily offended ;)
