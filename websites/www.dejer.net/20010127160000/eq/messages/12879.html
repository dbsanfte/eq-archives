It's been a very busy last two weeks on our end of the universe.  I'm hoping things will slow down a bit now.  We are planning on being able to play again starting tonight, though Eric was getting sick as of this morning - so it will depend on how he feels tonight when we get home.  So what have we missed?  How many dings did we miss and where is everyone?  Zach & I are still camped where we last grouped with Cervantes in the Overthere.<br>
  Hope to be on tonight!<br>
