Now that i got a lil time for me, i just wanted to say hello to you all, and I hope you do good.<br>
Well that's all, i may come back into EQ but i don't know when exactly.<br>
Maybe this eve or later, i don't know, i still got a lot of RL stuff to deal with and not of the funniest kind.<br>
But well hugs to everyone.
