The best scenario to getting this done, is to catch this guy, prior to invading Howling Stones for exp, as we are already in Overthere.<br>
<br>
As for the NPC, can you pull him out of outpost?  Or is he outside already?  I know I can't go near that places, everything is blue and higher and agro to me.<br>
<br>
Do we know the spawn time on him?  Would be very efficient to do this twice for you and Sariden if indeed he is wanting to work on the epic as well.<br>
