Well, as I posted below, it was kind of a surprise to me that it was Noble Blade.  I'm glad it was Noble Blade.  Noble Spirit just doesn't fit my generally destructive tendencies ;)  I think there were many dislikes for Noble Spirit, but some weren't as vocal for fear of going thru another hectic naming convention from hell.  Noble Blade only received a few vocal no's, but after being compared to Noble Spirit, the vocal no's of Noble Blade decided they liked Noble Blade better, ending up with the majority of no's staying with noble spirit, and many of the no's to noble blade being taken back.<br>
<br>
HOpe I haven't confused you too much ;)  And yes, we'll get you up there if you're late Woad.
