The friend that played with us for so long. I don't give a damn about the gear... but serioulsy Vic what is this about ? I swear people are on edge lately, I keep seeing emotional outbursts where there shouldn't be any =( . Maybe we all need to take it easy next week, too many raids in a short amount of time is taking its toll.<br>
