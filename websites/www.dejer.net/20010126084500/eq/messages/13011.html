As long as this board is around I'll cling to it with a death-grip!  I have a very strong allergic reaction to EZ-boards and their kin.  They are EVIL I tell you, EVIL!!  They are made of GNOME-SKIN armor they are!  EVIL INCARNATE!<br>
 Er...*ahem*  Sorry about that.<br>
Seriously, I really do not like the EZ board format and will continue to use this board as long as Dejer is kind enough to hold it.  When the guild gets ready to consolidate to one official forum, my only wish is that it's not an EZ board.<br>
