&lt;I&gt;Zaron - 2nd Chair Trumpet&lt;/I&gt;<br>
<br>
Trumpets! NOO!  Oh how I hated the 1st chair trumpet in High School.  He sat directly behind me and BLARED EVERYTHING.  I heard every frikkin Fraq and Sqwawk and missed note right into my ear.<br>
<br>
Band camp ruled though.  Lucky for me I had extremely *ahem* delicate skin and got sun poisoning every year.<br>
<br>
And don't get me started on that dolt of a college prof who actually wanted me to march bass clarinet!<br>
