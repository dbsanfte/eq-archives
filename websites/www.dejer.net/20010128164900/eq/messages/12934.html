Basically what Will said is true.  They in short are giving all classes (but Warriors and Rogue) an experience bonus to make up for thier current experience penatly.<br>
<br>
Before the patch most classes require extra experience to level.  Those classes also take a larger portion of thier groups experience (based upon thier current total experience).<br>
<br>
After the patch, everyone in a group will get the same experience (modified by level only now) and extra experience will be giving to those classes that are currently penalized.<br>
<br>
Before patch:<br>
Human warrior, cleric and ranger are grouped, they are all the same level.  Warriors have a 10% experience bonus, clerics are pretty much as base experience, and rangers have a 40% penalty (penalty means they require more experience to reach the same level as other classes).<br>
<br>
When this group makes a kill each person should recieve 33% of the experience.  However currently experience is divided by current total experience, which means classes with penalties take more from the group then people without them.  In the above case we'll say the kill had 1000 exp points.  The ranger (having an experience penalty) would take more than his normal 333 point share.  So the ranger would recieve close to 430 exp, the cleric 300, and the warrior 270.<br>
<br>
[Numbers in this example are pretty much acurate based on my understanding of the experience system.]<br>
<br>
After Patch:<br>
Using the same group as above.  Since experience will be split only on level now (not total expirence), each of the 3 people would recieve 333 exp points for the kill.  However, because the ranger needs more experience to level (i.e. the experience penalty) he will now recieve some extra &quot;bonus&quot; experience to off-set the penalty.  Rangers require 40% more experience to level, so we mulity 333 by 40%, giving the ranger 466 exp for that kill.<br>
<br>
This will in effect remove the class based experience penalty that most classes have.  However, warriors and rogues will still have a slight experience bonus over all other classes.  Seems to me they should have made all classes equal to warriors.<br>
