I think it's pretty evident to almost ANY person that was ever in Silver Blade about my feelings and total dislike to change, and the fact that I was 150% against this merger.<br>
<br>
With that in mind...<br>
<br>
Since I've joined the new guild, I haven't had ONE  problem with anything that has gone on... Even Lohki, who was my main concern throughout this whole fiasco, has been nothing but respectful to me... even knowing that I am Leonardo, the one he hated the most way back when.<br>
<br>
Before the merger, Williahm did nothing but sit around and auction shit in EC, ran from zone to zone with the /lfg tag on, shouting and ranting about not being able to find a group... well, that has changed... I've gained more experience in the past two nights than I have in a month without being in the new guild.  I've had alot more fun, because I've made myself step back and watch, more than give my input.  I've met some really great people, whom I NEVER would have before joining, and have had some great groups, all thrown together on a whim as I'm logging in.<br>
<br>
I really can't be positive that you'll be as happy as I am right now, because of the level difference, but remember, we still have plenty of lower to mid 40's in the guild as well.  Most all of us SB's still have alternates that are in that range as well.<br>
<br>
Give it a chance, as much as I thought I'd NEVER say that, it's true.  Yea, the /gu gets painful on the eyes after a while, but I spent 2 weeks in SB with NO /gu whatsoever... so it's a nice change. =)<br>

Here's to seeing you in /gu...<br>
