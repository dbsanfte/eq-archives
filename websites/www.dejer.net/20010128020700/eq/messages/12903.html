<I>Warden of The Rathe</I><br>
<br>
Warden?  You keeping those prisoners in line now, eh?<br>
<br>
Yesterday I played a bit in OT .. only for about an hour or so (still sick) but I got almost two blue bubbles.<br>
<br>
I'm still 2 bubs away from 38.. I'm hoping to go crazy in EQ this weekend and get to 39 by Sunday night.

I'm still not feeling well atm .. so I'll probably nap this afternoon.  Which means I'll be on around 6 and be able to stay up later than 10pm hehe
