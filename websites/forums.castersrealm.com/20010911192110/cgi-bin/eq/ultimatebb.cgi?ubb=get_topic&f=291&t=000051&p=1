All of chapter One is done now. <P>Note: With this latest series, I have had some help from my friend, Keizen the ShadowHand. He helped with fight scenes in later chapters and designed the first villain, as well as gave me some inspiration.<P>The Path to the Light<P>Tunare sighed as a roar went through reality. &#8220;So your son just beat him.&#8221;<P>Thelis&#8217;s back was turned, but Tunare could imagine her smile. &#8220;I guess so.&#8221;<P>Tunare winced. Then she tapped Thelis on the shoulder. As the succubae turned around, she asked. &#8220;So, I&#8217;ve been trying to get you to put your history, but you&#8217;ve always said that there wasn&#8217;t any time. Now you&#8217;ve got plenty of time.&#8221;<P>Now it was Thelis&#8217;s turn to wince. Then she said in a sort of little girl voice &#8220;Do I HAVE to?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;<P>Thelis pouted. &#8220;B...but....&#8221;<P>&#8220;No buts.&#8221;<BR>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Chapter One: Beginnings<P>All right. Let&#8217;s get something straight here. This wasn&#8217;t my idea, so I&#8217;m not going to be that clear. I haven&#8217;t ever really thought about putting this down, so I&#8217;m not really prepared.<P>I need to let you know something. My memory extends before I was actually created. There is a very good reason for this. I&#8217;m really a composite being. And Innoruuk put a LOT of time into me, so what he did to do it sort of stuck in my head.<P>In it&#8217;s own way, Innoruuk&#8217;s creation of me was a labor of love. That was probably the source of his downfall. Because, for all his prattling about &#8216;Hate is all&#8217;, Inny is like everyone else in that he wants to show, and receive, love. He doesn&#8217;t get that from many things, for good reason. His own people hate him. His daughter hates him, which is what she thinks he wants. Consequently, the only way he ever gets to show love on things is when he makes them.<P>I don&#8217;t really know why he wanted to make me in the first place. He never confided in me, for some reason. But he started fairly simply. He depopulated the lower ranks of Reapers, to give a succubae some extra power. Reapers are killing machines, so it&#8217;s not a bad idea except for the fact that he had to kill them in the process.  He grabbed power from every source he could imagine, and then some that he got suggestions from.<P>I guess the point where &#8216;my&#8217; memories come in is with a young woman named Listhe. Listhe was exceptional in almost every single way. She was beautiful, smart, and tough. She could probably talk stones into grinding themselves up to give her a way through. She was also one of those throwbacks which crop up every so often in the Teir&#8217;dal, she had a good heart. I&#8217;ve often wondered how the Teir&#8217;dal would have turned out if she&#8217;d lived.<P>You see, the creation of succubae, as with most higher forms of demons, requires mortal life. And Listhe was selected for the sacrifice. Worse still, she would have to do it on herself. But I think that the selection of Listhe was Innoruuk&#8217;s greatest mistake. If he&#8217;d chosen one of the crueler women, who would have eagerly transformed themselves to kill some more, I&#8217;d probably not be here.<P>Enough with the explanations.<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Listhe was scared. That fear was something she&#8217;d been living with since her name had been read in the oracles as the sacrifice. Nobody had been terribly unhappy, and they&#8217;d all been telling her what an honor it was. <P>The simple truth was Listhe did not want to die. She wanted to live, but she stepped into the sacrificial chamber anyways. It&#8217;s walls were stained with old bloodstains. There was a single priest standing over an altar. He directed her to lay down on the altar with an imperious gesture, his face dreadfully eager.<P> The priest chanted a spell, then without another word he handed her a knife. <P>Listhe took a deep breath and drove the knife into her heart.<P>The pain was intense. She screamed, an explosive cry which reverberated in the chamber like a bell. Her vision dimmed, and her limbs splayed out.<P>Listhe was still terrified. Strangely enough, she could still think clearly. Her vision was black. She felt her soul leave her body.<P>Was this death? She didn&#8217;t know. All sensation vanished from her mind, and she fell into what seemed to be a dreamy sleep.<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>It could have been centuries before the light returned to her eyes. It could have also been a minute. She didn&#8217;t know. <P>And light returned, all right, but it was not a normal light. It was the ruddy light of fire. It danced and smoked.<P>She looked around and realized the flames were all around her. On her, even, but she felt no pain. Abruptly she realized her body wasn&#8217;t the same, either. She was in the proper sort of humanoid configuration-correct amount of limbs and in the right place, basic appearance the same- but........she looked a lot like she&#8217;d been BUILT to seduce. And her skin had little color to it. It was too pale, a sort of bluish white.<P>Neither was her mind the same. She searched through it. Her name was different. She tried to think of her own given name, but it identified nothing to her. Weird things were in her brain now, not quite memory, but almost...<P>&#8220;Thelis means reborn.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Wha!?&#8221; she said.<P>A tall and dark silhouette of a man stood before her. &#8220;I said, Thelis means reborn. It is rather appropriate. Now kneel before your creator.&#8221;<P>&#8220;You did this to me?! Die!&#8221; She raised one hand, and purple claws of energy extended from her clenched fists. She leapt up and sliced at him, but abruptly she realized three things. First, she wasn&#8217;t wearing anything.<P>Second, he was armed, and his counterattack tossed her back to the floor like a child&#8217;s toy. &#8220;Impressive, if clumsy. A little training ought to fix that.&#8221;<P>Third, she&#8217;d just done something nobody she knew of had ever did. She&#8217;d not been taught that....&#8221;Who are you? Why did you do this to me?&#8221;<P>&#8220;I am your lord. Innoruuk, Prince of Hate.&#8221;<P>Thelis dropped to her knees. She&#8217;d just struck at her god, and she must die for that. She waited calmly for death.<P>&#8220;Oh, get up. I prefer defiance outspoken.&#8221;<P>Thelis immediately leapt up. &#8220;That&#8217;s better. As for why I made you, you are a weapon. You will bring my desires to fruition.&#8221;<P>Thelis felt her mouth curling into a grin as a sort of happiness dawned in her. &#8220;I am happy to serve,&#8221; she said, though she didn&#8217;t really mean to say it. &#8220;You spoke of training?&#8221;<P>Innoruuk laughed. &#8220;You are very eager. Already. Are you really of the mind to spread Hate through the universe?&#8221;<P>Thelis realized she&#8217;d changed. She&#8217;d never been devout. But now....all she wanted to do was further his agenda. &#8220;I think you will find my hatred sufficient.&#8221;<P>Innoruuk&#8217;s mocking laughter echoed through the chamber as Thelis strode out of it. She was still unclad.<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>I don&#8217;t really think that I need to go into my training. At least not most of it. Some of it was lewd, some merely disgusting. But, not counting the lewd/disgusting stuff, here&#8217;s the gist of it.<P>I learned to wield Shadow magic. I got so good at it I could fiddle with spells til they were unique to me. I could blast enemies to bits without getting even close. I could turn off the sun like I would snuff a candle to a small area. I could become as insubstantial as a shadow, I could literally freeze one-and it&#8217;s owner- in place. It was amazing.<P>I also learned the succubae&#8217;s fundamental ability-to be different. This is such a powerful ability that many don&#8217;t ever realize what a given succubae really looks like, they spend so much time looking like something else. And I&#8217;m not just talking about simple things like hair color. I could increase or decrease my body mass and size. I could make myself a completely different race. I could make myself  have scales or fur. I could increase the size of certain important (for my profession anyways) objects, make my lips redder or my hair longer. I could even-and as weird as it seems I used this a couple times and had a lot of fun with it- change my gender. It was a lot of fun to see what I&#8216;d look like as a human or as a troll (shudder) or even as a Reaper (even more shudder). Unfortunately, demons, even succubae, aren&#8217;t the most social of creatures, and as a result I had very few friends and couldn&#8217;t exactly leave to start experimenting.<P>My life was all right, I guess. I could grab someone when I felt the need and I spent a great deal of time exploring Hell, fighting and killing the lesser and wild Demons. Hell is close to an anarchy, but there is a clear distinction between the lawless and the servants of Innoruuk. The lawless die. So do the loyal, but less. And those that do die are reborn as the lawless, to die again. I was never hungry or tired, for it was a realm without true time. I was content. You may wonder how I could be when I remembered my previous life, but to tell you the truth, I really didn&#8217;t. I thought of Listhe as a silly girl whose fears had kept her from becoming a greater being-which, of course, I HAD to be. I had quite an ego, and thought of myself as the hottest little warrior in Hell. Luckily, I never challenged Calchisith. That would have killed me. I&#8217;m ashamed to admit that when I got really bored or depressed, I always visited the areas where the damned were suffering, and amused myself. That always cheered my black soul right up.<P>To me, Listhe had died. I was no longer her, in any way. This was wrong, of course, but it was what seemed to make sense at the time. I couldn&#8217;t think of any way she&#8217;d enjoyed being without the power I possessed, nor the amusements. I was, in short, not much to be proud of.<P>Innoruuk had destroyed my previous self forever. I wanted nothing more then to serve him. But little bits of the &#8216;old&#8217; me kept cropping up, trying to get me to rebel against him. It was annoying and traumatizing to fight with myself, not to mention painful, as I always resorted to violence. But eventually they won in that they wanted me to leave.<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Thelis yelled in the fiery chamber &#8220;Lord!&#8221; It had been exactly five years since she had opened her eyes in the same chamber to her new self.<P>Innoruuk&#8217;s deep voice echoed throughout the area, prompting a wave of hatred from Thelis, and simultaneously a helpless loyalty. &#8220;Yes, my servant?&#8221;<P>&#8220;I want OUT of this place!&#8221;<P>&#8220;Out? And what right do you have to a want?&#8221; Innoruuk&#8217;s voice was dangerous.<P>Thelis immediately knew anger wouldn&#8217;t work. She&#8217;d have to try loyalty. &#8220;Lord, if I am to serve you, I must have experience with the outer world! I have advanced as far as I can on the plains of Hell at this time. I need to leave, to be able to serve you better.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Oh, really?&#8221; Innoruuk&#8217;s tone was sort of mocking. &#8220;Then I&#8217;ll give you a little test. You defeat a servant I choose, and I&#8217;ll let you go.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Defeat?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Kill. Kill and absorb.&#8221;<P>Thelis bowed. Her scant clothing rustled as she did. &#8220;All right, Lord. Choose your best, because I&#8217;m going to take them down.&#8221;<P>Black fires erupted from the ground, and surrounded Thelis in a circle of about twenty feet diameter.  They climbed higher and higher, and then a bright flash and a roar of sound blacked out the rest of the world.<P>She raised one hand, and looked at the little impressions coming from it of her body. She clenched her fists, and the purple claws of energy that were her weapons of choice erupted from her knuckles.<P>Another form appeared in the little arena. It was one of her instructors, an older succubae who she&#8217;d been fairly close with. She raised her hands as well and two knives of light appeared in her hands.<P>Thelis charged, swinging like a possessed thing. Her claws ripped a long, bloody hole in her teacher&#8217;s side. Blood spurted from the wound. The counterattack clashed off claws, then her teacher hurled Thelis away with a shove. She yelled &#8220;Burn!&#8221; and flames licked at Thelis, but their fury was deflected by a shield of black force which appeared right in front of Thelis, who leapt out of the way and slashed another wound in.<P>The teacher&#8217;s angry hiss was terrible. She swelled, growing huge, and the knives struck back, tearing into Thelis. She shrieked in pain and anger and darted to the left. As her teacher pivoted, her now ponderous form an easy target, Thelis yelled &#8220;Shadow Strike!&#8221; and a bolt of darkness struck her teacher. The succubae roared in pain and countered with a knife swipe.<P>Thelis felt the pain of the strikes as the knives sawed cleanly into her thigh. She screamed, but the urge to kill was overpowering now and would stop for no pain. She leapt up and her fist glowed a bright purplish black. Then she held it before her teacher&#8217;s face, chanting words of power and destruction she did not know.<P>The foe screamed, her face going white and her body filling with rogue energies. Then she seemed to expand still more, and she soundlessly exploded. The explosion was sucked into Thelis&#8217;s still-clenched fist. <P>Thelis dropped to the ground and landed on her feet, every wound on her body healed. Of her foe, there was nothing left but the still-glowing pair of knives. Thelis reached over and snapped them in two with her boot.<P>There was no sound but Innoruuk&#8217;s clapping. &#8220;Excellent!&#8221;<P>Thelis turned around to face him. &#8220;So?&#8221;<P>&#8220;You get your wish.&#8221;<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Seamus was a studious High Elf, and he could always be found pouring over the religious texts of his church, seeking the hidden meanings therein. This his masters knew very well, and they caught him there on that day. <P>&#8220;You&#8217;ve passed, Seamus.&#8221;<P>&#8220;....can you hold on a minute, sir?&#8221; And Seamus placed a bookmark in his text and slammed it shut. Then and only then did he look up. &#8220;I&#8217;ve....passed?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Your scores were exceptional.&#8221;<P>Seamus raised his blade, the Starlight, and without a word handed it to his master.<P>&#8220;Once again, excellent.&#8221; And his master tapped the blade on each of his student&#8217;s shoulders. &#8220;I declare you knight. Keep these vows. Defend the weak, uphold the truth, and keep thy friends. Dost thou accept this stern responsibility?&#8221;<P>Seamus nodded. &#8220;I do.&#8221;<P>His master nodded. &#8220;Well, you know what you must do.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Seamus packed his bags, stuffed his religious text inside, and donned his light blue armor. He didn&#8217;t say a word to his masters, but instead departed Felwithe immediately. Then he popped open a cork and started having some brandy, once again without much sound or cheering.<P>He was a quiet man, Seamus. He seldom spoke much that he didn&#8217;t have to. He didn&#8217;t eat much, drink much, or sing. He would have been considered boring by those who barely knew him.<P>But that quiet demeanor hid an incredibly apt and perceptive mind. As soon as someone opened him up, he&#8217;d start talking philosophy or religion, and dazzled his debaters into submission. <P>He was also the best man with a sword Felwithe had ever seen in a High Elf. Though it wasn&#8217;t well-known, he&#8217;d beaten every single man who challenged him, and they forgave him-just as soon as the broken bones healed. <P>He heard a noise behind him. He turned around. Two orcs laughed sibilantly. &#8220;You should be more alert, boy!&#8221; one of them howled and struck downwards towards the man&#8217;s unarmored head.<P>There was a blur of activity. The sword flashed out of the earth and blasted aside the orc&#8217;s weapon, then he turned his parry into a cleave, the blade descending through the orc&#8217;s twitching body, then a massive bolt of energy struck from the heavens and turned Seamus&#8217;s victim into ash.<P>The orc gasped at the smoldering pile which had been his partner. Then with a wild yell he struck, blade thrusting towards Seamus&#8217;s chest.<P>And right then, Seamus dodged with extraordinary speed and raised his sword to the heavens. &#8220;Spiking Light!&#8221; A bolt of light flashed up from the earth and spitted the orc warrior, coring him and turning his body into a blackened husk.<P>Seamus dusted his hands off and sheathed his sword. &#8220;Pitiful.&#8221;<P>He departed. The ash piles burned.<P><BR>The shadow  of the tree rippled briefly, as though liquid, and laughed. &#8220;A powerful mortal, eh... those are... thoroughly entertaining in these droll days We must endure.&#8221;  It laughed again... &#8220;how shall it dance on the strings today, We wonder? I do so love it when fate delivers to us such amusing presents!&#8221;<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Thelis took a deep breath of the clean air. No fires here! She grinned. Her body felt strange. After five years of being a succubae in appearance, being a Dark Elf again felt weird. <P>The desert&#8217;s heat rippled and shimmered. In Hell, no matter how fiery it may appear, the place was cold. Really cold. It was strange to feel heat again. She looked around and remembered her lord&#8217;s last command to her.<P>Do not give away your true self, and do NOT, whatever you do, get within a cleric of Tunare&#8217;s presence. If you must, then journey with others, but you are NOT to confide in them. Your power is acceptable for use, but do NOT explain WHY it works.<P>She was feeling funny. The heat must be getting to her. She took a hesitant step, then abruptly fell to the sand and passed out.<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Seamus grimaced. He hated desert. It was too damn hot, and in his armor, he was roasting alive. &#8220;Agh.&#8221;<P>He looked forward. &#8220;What?&#8221; It looked weird, but he saw a good-looking woman lying in the sand.<P>She was a Dark Elf. Conflicting desires arose in him, the urge to kill and the urge to save. He tossed his hatreds away where they belonged and leapt over the dunes to the woman.<P>He did not notice the green eye of his shadow looking at him. It made a laughing motion and the green eye disappeared.<P>--------------------<P>'Good is subjective. Evil never changes.'<P>Yakov Shadeleaf, Ranger of the twentieth season.

Oh, curious.<P>Silves, I know that Raziel and Kegyar, and to a lesser extent, I'm not sure, Alielle, write in the same 'history' as mine, thus creating an interlocked chronicle sort of like the Silmarilion.

I haven't abondoned you! Your stories are too good to abandon. They are so different from everything else I read. I guess that's why I love them so much. I've just spent the last few days levitating newbies. And I guess I just don't think I have to keep on posting to let you know I love your stories. <P>Great story so far. Keep it up! <--- The best thing I can come up with to say. I don't like to be redundant and keep on posting the same thing.

As a gift to you all for the fourth of July, I'm gonna post all of chapter two here. Yes, there may not be so many explosions this time, but when chapter three comes, THERE WILL BE!!!!!!!!!<P>The Path to Light, Chapter Two: Meeting<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>As you may have guessed, this is when I met Seamus. And no, it was not a relationship of roses and sweets. I hated him on sight.<P>He seemed to be looking right into my black, grubby little soul every time he looked at me! HOW I HATED that look! I wanted to slice him up. I wanted to carve him into pieces and sacrifice him to my Lord. And the fact he was gorgeous made me plain MAD. <P>He was a PALADIN! I wanted him DEAD!!!! And for some reason, his shadow gave me the creeps.<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Thelis looked weakly up from the sand. &#8220;Who...are you?&#8221; she muttered.<P>The man looked at her. &#8220;Good, you&#8217;re awake. I&#8217;m Seamus.&#8221;<P>She focused on several things. First, the holy symbol patterned on his armor. She leapt up and her hands flickered, then energy claws extended from them and she weakly sliced at him.<P>The claws bounced off hard plate. &#8220;...whoa. Calm down, girl.&#8221;<P>She didn&#8217;t listen. &#8220;Get away from me!&#8221; <P>&#8220;...&#8221; Seamus grimaced. &#8220;You&#8217;re gonna give yourself heatstroke.&#8221;<P>She didn&#8217;t listen, as she was running for the ocean as soon as she could. She dived into the water. Then she stretched forth her mind and tried to start turning into a crocodile.<P>For some reason, it wouldn&#8217;t come.<P>Hey, slow down. He saved you.<P>Shut up! I&#8217;m sort of BUSY here!<P>You&#8217;re actually running from a guy that good-looking?<P>You, be quiet! Or I&#8217;ll hurt us!<P>You&#8217;re crazy.<P>Abruptly, strong arms pulled her from the water. &#8220;Hey, you trying to imitate a fish?&#8221;<P>&#8220;You&#8217;d be surprised&#8221; she said, half-choked. Then abruptly she slashed for his eyes.<P>He grabbed her arm, then threw her to the dirt. &#8220;Hey, I could have rid this world of your dirty little body the second I saw you. Aren&#8217;t you even the slightest bit grateful I saved your miserable life?&#8221;<P>&#8220;NO!&#8221;<P>&#8220;You&#8217;re crazy.&#8221;<P>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard that before.&#8221;<P>For good reasons. ARGH! SHUT UP! I...SHUT IT!<P>She punched herself in the face. TAKE THAT!<P>Seamus looked on with a faintly amused look. &#8220;Trying to knock yourself out?&#8221;<P>She angrily gave him the universal sign of insult.<P>&#8220;Well, well. You gonna come back to camp and have a drink of brandy?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Brandy? What&#8217;s that?&#8221; she asked, her curiosity overcoming her hatred. <P>&#8220;Where have you been?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Hell.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Yeah, Neriak sucks, eh?&#8221;<P>She wanted to punch herself again. Why me?<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>About an hour later, Thelis had not only found out what Brandy was, but had developed an extraordinary love of it. &#8220;Hic...this stuff is good.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Yeah, isn&#8217;t it.&#8221; Seamus sighed. &#8220;Did I have to bribe you to get you to stop it?&#8221;<P>She hiccupped. &#8220;More? Can I have more?&#8221;<P>&#8220;You&#8217;ve already had more then was good for you.&#8221; Seamus found this out because she slumped over on the dirt.<P>Seamus sighed. &#8220;Did I have to mess this one up? I finally get a good girl...and she gets DRUNK!&#8221;<P>Thelis snored. And snored. And snored.<P>Seamus felt a vague ripple in what, to the best of his expansive  knowledge, was most definitely his soul... and he heard, or rather, felt, a voice... a sort of vaguely sinister voice that is likely the only one that you will ever have rummaging around in your soul anyways.<P>(Hello)<P>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221;<P>Thelis perked her ears &#8220;You talk  to yourself? How reliev- er... strange.&#8221; She punched herself hard.<P>(Your conscience?)<P>I sincerely doubt that.<P>(A spirit of evil?)<P>Likely.<P>(Well... that&#8217;s most annoying... the gullible types are SO much fun. I&#8217;ll have to think of a different form of entertainment... that emotionally disturbed young... lady over there seems quite... malleable, really. Especially when she&#8217;s drunk. This could be fun!)<P>......Hm.. Nah. Girls are no good drunk. They&#8217;re like zombies.<P>(Yes, but having her deal with the emotional repercussions of accidentally killing you in your sleep would be quite delicious)<P>.....You&#8217;re not only stupid, you&#8217;re uninventive. Really, can&#8217;t you come up with a better plan then &#8216;use the girl against the man&#8217;?<P>(It&#8217;s not your downfall that concerns me... it&#8217;s the pain SHE has to go through. I&#8217;m rather hungry. Plus, your soul is rather robust and healthy! A real bauble to show off on the lower planes, you know? The HEIGHT of fashion where I come from!)<P>And what&#8217;s to stop me from killing her here and now? You think I&#8217;d have any qualms about it? She&#8217;s scum. Either a shadowknight, truly a good target, or worse. I can feel it. You think I have attachments to her? You can wear HER soul for all I care.<P>Seamus drew his sword, rose up, and pointed it at the sleeping woman&#8217;s neck.<P>(I don&#8217;t think  you understand what she is, was, or will be at all. I see that this directness hasn&#8217;t gotten me anywhere, so, I think I&#8217;m going to abandon yourself for now. Exit the villain, close act I, you know? The Emerald Eye is upon you, young fellow.)<P>Seamus removed his sword and lay down to sleep.<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Thelis shuddered as Seamus got his armor on. The holy symbol seemed to burn her skin when she looked at it. &#8220;So where to?&#8221; he asked.<P>&#8220;Anywhere. You assume I&#8217;m coming with you.&#8221;<P>&#8220;No, I know you are. It&#8217;s simple. My irresistible charm will have you running to me in hours.&#8221;<P>Thelis grimaced. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got an ego.&#8221;<P>&#8220;So do you.&#8221; He pointed towards Befallen. &#8220;Interested?&#8221;<P>Thelis frowned. There were dark elves there...but it would not be a bad act as they were independents. &#8220;Sure.&#8221;<P>Seamus pulled out his sword. &#8220;Lead the way.&#8221;<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>The cold air of Befallen was suddenly superheated by a bolt of heat as the necromancer fired a blood boiling bolt at Thelis. A black shield of force materialized in front of the succubae and blocked it.<P>&#8220;You need some practice.&#8221; Thelis clenched her fists and the claws ignited. She leapt at the enemy, and slashed open his entrails. The Dark elf howled and toppled, a slowly widening pool of redness covering the floor.<P>A shadowknight leapt at Thelis, sword swinging, but the claws deflected the fury of the blade and Thelis gave her enemy a little shove. He stumbled, and that was all the time Thelis needed. &#8220;Midnight Vortex!&#8221; A black beam fired from her hand and hit the wall, then huge amounts of energy rebounded off the walls and sliced any foe they touched to ribbons.<P>The bits and pieces of the shadowknight floated to the floor.<P>Seamus parried a wild sword swing, then struck back. The bolt of heavenly fire consumed part of the woman&#8217;s armor, then he crouched and drove his sword into the pavement. He yelled &#8220;Heaven&#8217;s Wrath!&#8221; Holy force erupted into being and circles of it exploded outward, reducing his foe to a bloody corpse.<P>The last shadowknight&#8217;s face paled, but he held his ground and raised his hands. &#8220;Deathly Curse!&#8221; Diseased mist burst into being and sickening odors filled the room with the sweet smell of new death. Thelis paled and turned a sickly green. She was enraged. Her claws flickered out like a wraith, and the shadowknight gasped as his hip was lacerated. He struck back, and Thelis&#8217;s chest was ripped into. Her blood stained the floor.<P>Then the shadowknight dropped to the ground, headless, as Seamus finished his grand cleave. The Starlight glimmered in the bloody light of the room.<P>&#8220;Nice one.&#8221; Thelis said as her skin turned back to it&#8217;s blue color.<P>&#8220;Thank you. Next floor?&#8221;<P>&#8220;The door is locked.&#8221;<P>&#8220;I can fix that.&#8221; Seamus muttered something under his breath and the door blasted inward. &#8220;That work?&#8221;<P>&#8220;I think so.&#8221; She was hard pressed to keep her giggles under control. <P>Agh, what&#8217;s happening to me! I&#8217;m supposed to HATE him. Hate him hate him hate him.....<P>You&#8217;re falling for him.<P>Why do you always pop up at the worst time? Stay out of my head, Listhe!<P>Ummm...I&#8217;m in your head to stay. I&#8217;m you.<P>No you&#8217;re NOT! I&#8217;M ME!<P>Why are we fighting over this?<P>Because I&#8217;m the one who owns the damn body.<P>No you don&#8217;t! You usurped me.<P>SHADDAP!!!!!!!!<P>Seamus winced as she started beating on herself. He backed away, slowly. &#8220;Done?&#8221; he asked as she gave herself a bloody nose.<P>&#8220;I am.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Why do you do that?&#8221;<P>&#8220;None of your business, scum! Your pathetic mind is incapable of understanding my advanced motives!&#8221;<P>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to be offensive. I get it, you&#8217;re just plain crazy.&#8221;<P>Thelis chose not to dignify that with a response, but she gritted her teeth and advanced into the dungeon. Once out of Seamus&#8217;s sight, she quickly transformed herself into a decaying corpse, painfully, and walked down the halls exploring.<P>Screw him, I don&#8217;t need him! I can do just fine by myself...<P>She went down the hall. An echo sounded behind her. Her shadow was rippling.<P>Weird.....Did I do that? Abruptly her body went through a painful forcing back into her disguise.<P>(Hello! Is our little demon princess enjoying the company of her astute paladin friend?)<P>You only got one thing right. You better refer to me with respect.<P>(I have no reason to respect you! Don&#8217;t you know who I am?)<P>An idiotic excuse for a loser, lawless demon who can&#8217;t do anything but whisper pathetic insults? You&#8217;re talking to one of Innoruuk&#8217;s most complex, powerful creations here. You&#8217;re walking on thin ice.<P>(By complexity I assume you refer to your mental disorders?)<P>No, I meant the huge amount of time he spent on me. And shut up.<P>(Ha! Innoruuk! He couldn&#8217;t make a lesser mummy without infusing it with schizophrenia! I am the all powerful Emerald Eye! The holder of the souls of 1000 heroes! I control the soul of the great wizard Thyaalt Stormhand! I am the shadows that walk the earth! I am Keizen the ShadowHand, ally of Maarin the Lord of the Chaotic!)<P>Hm. I won&#8217;t let you insult my lord like that! And as for shadows, I use them like you would a sword. So you don&#8217;t impress me. And I&#8217;ve never heard of you either, because I only concern my time with the powerful, not the upstarts.<P>(They won&#8217;t talk of me because they fear a demon with so much power outside the hierarchy. Have fun frolicking in the flowers with your little friend, impudent fiend!)<P>Thelis was overwhelmed by a flash of green, and the presence faded from her mind. She didn&#8217;t even get off her retort of &#8216;HEY, I&#8217;m a SUCCUBAE!&#8217;.<P>&#8220;Idiot..&#8221; she muttered. <P>Seamus came running up. &#8220;Where did you go? I didn&#8217;t see anything but a blood trail, and I thought you were hurt. I heard these awful moans....&#8221;<P>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m fine. Let&#8217;s go, wimp.&#8221; <P>Seamus stared at the darkness. Thelis followed his gaze. <P>A massive, cloaked, and deadly wraith emerged from the shadowy gloom. It&#8217;s eyes glowed with an unholy red light, and it cackled as it&#8217;s hands burned with dreadful fires. It&#8217;s scythe trailed red streams of energy.<P>Thelis identified it in a second. Dread Spectre, highly dangerous and given a modicum of intelligence. It could cast. Lovely.<P>The two stared for a moment, then split up. Thelis was in the air, her hands flickering with purplish light. &#8220;Hey, come over HERE and attack me!&#8221; <P>It&#8217;s grim head shook once, as if in acknowledgement, and it lunged for Thelis. It was strong and fast. It&#8217;s scythe flashed in the only light, coming from it&#8217;s eyes, and plunged into Thelis. But it came out again with no harm. Thelis grinned and struck back, shadowy bits ripped off the Spectre. It howled and raised it&#8217;s arms, and cried in a voice that sounded hideous &#8220;Blood Rain!&#8221;<P>Bloody drips of fire fell from the ceiling and exploded on contact. Thelis fell to her back, and watched Seamus fly into the air. &#8220;Lucent Beam!&#8221; A bolt of light illuminated the corridor and ripped it&#8217;s way into the Spectre. It howled and swung it&#8217;s scythe.<P>It rebounded off Starlight, and the scythe snapped in two at the head. Tossing it aside, it&#8217;s claws tore at Seamus, who grunted and pulled back. His blood shone on his blue breastplate. <P>Thelis lifted her arm. &#8220;Shadow Grip!&#8221; A field of darkness blacker then night itself engulfed the Spectre, then it crystallized. The Spectre roared and struggled. <P>Seamus got back up again, and shouted &#8220;Sky Blade!&#8221; A blue beam extended from his sword, then traced a line from him to the Spectre. Blue flame flowed along that line and exploded when it struck it&#8217;s target.<P>Then Thelis was right in front of the Spectre, claws retracted into fists which glowed dark purple. She raised one to her victim&#8217;s face, then tapped it&#8217;s skull. &#8220;Absorption. &#8221; It howled, the black robes going white and the body burning with deadly and uncontrolled force.<P>It cracked all along it&#8217;s ugly body, then burst into a white explosion which was sucked into Thelis&#8217;s fist. She felt energy coursing through her body, then grinned and sighed once in pleasure, enjoying the feeling of power. Then she pushed it into healing herself and Seamus.<P>Seamus&#8217;s eyes widened. &#8220;You&#8217;re good.&#8221;<P>&#8220;No kidding, numbskull.&#8221;<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P><BR>Kyrin looked up from his map in the inn. &#8220;Mayra, are you sure this is the way to Freeport?&#8221;<P>Mayra, showing no more emotion than she ever did, simply nodded.<P>&#8220;But how can you be sure?&#8221;<P>&#8220;I AM sure.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Absolut-&#8221;<P>The rapidly devolving conversation was cut short by a rapid rush of wind and the total destruction of the inn roof as a Griffin soared through the ceiling, grabbed Kyrin&#8217;s pork roast, and began to climb into the sky, though perhaps perturbed by the low quality of its latest catch.<P>Kyrin stood up in a rage. &#8220;I HAVEN&#8217;T EATEN IN NEARLY 4 DAYS! THAT THING IS DEAD!&#8221;<P>Mayra smirked.<P>Kyrin ran outside of the inn and readied one of his javelins. He raised the weapon, and electricity coursed through it. &#8220;Lightning Lance!&#8221; he yelled. The lance seemed to extend, then vaporized as a bolt of lighting streaked outwards and burned the Griffin.<P>The Griffin, however, was only slightly wounded. Dropping the pork roast on an unfortunate Srg. Slate, it wheeled around and charged back towards Kyrin, claws extended.<P>Kyrin gulped and started moving back. &#8220;Mayra... I think it&#8217;s mad. Can you cast spells or anything?&#8221;<P>&#8220;No, not now.&#8221;<P>&#8220;What can you do?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Kill it&#8221;<P>&#8220;That&#8217;s very good. Please do.&#8221; The outmatched Knight of Voxx ran back towards the inn to seek cover.<P>Mayra rolled under the Griffin, and delivered a single, dreadfully powerful kick which smashed the heart, lungs, and spine of the huge beast. It&#8217;s beak opened and blood poured out, then it crashed to the ground in a heap.<P>Mayra smirked and dusted her hands off, and then turned around. &#8220;Why do you insist on starting these pointless fights with the wildlife, Kyrin?&#8221;<P>&#8220;For Justice and Honor!&#8221;<P>&#8220;Why...?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Because I demand it!&#8221;<P>&#8220;And does Voxx?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Voxx merely give knights the power to do as they wish, within her unknown ends!&#8221;<BR> <BR>&#8220;That&#8217;s very kind of her. Let&#8217;s just get to Freeport, ok?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Yeah, sure, Ms. Human Compass.&#8221;<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>The tavern was disreputable. But Thelis didn&#8217;t care. They had plenty of alcohol, and her newfound passion for it was satisfied.<P>She could think. Actually, she was immune to drunkenness, but she allowed her body language to simulate it. <P>The question: When to kill Seamus and sacrifice his soul to Innoruuk.<P>The answer. I don&#8217;t know. He has his uses.<P>Don&#8217;t kill him. You don&#8217;t need to!<P>I do too have to kill him. He&#8217;s an enemy. Shut up, Listhe. You are so naive it&#8217;s pathetic.<P>YOU shut up and listen to me for a change!<P>No. Your advice would get me in trouble. And I&#8217;d be violating my reason for being here: to serve Innoruuk.<P>You ONLY got here because I MADE you complain to him and get sent here for a bit. Don&#8217;t forget that.<P>Thelis did the equivalent of a mental gag. Listhe&#8217;s desperate attempts to speak were blotted out.<P>She had the tenth cup of ale. The &#8216;cup&#8217; was the size of a man&#8217;s forearm in length for height.<P>&#8220;Good Tunare, how do you do it?&#8221;<P>&#8220;I&#8217;m...hic....good...&#8221;<P>&#8220;You&#8217;re damn right.&#8221; Seamus muttered. He&#8217;d ordered a much softer drink then the hard vodka Thelis was drinking. &#8220;Magic?&#8221;<P>&#8220;I guess.&#8221; she muttered.<P>An argument in progress became audible as a strangely matched pair of adventurers came into the tavern &#8220;-you need to lighten up!&#8221; said the heavily armed man in steel armor and carrying a polearm looking a lot like a pair of estoc blades on a pole on opposite ends.<P>&#8220;I&#8217;m perfectly happy with myself&#8221; said the robed, delicate-looking human woman.<P>Seamus yelled &#8220;Shut up! You&#8217;re disturbing my Shifter game.&#8221;<P>Kyrin glared. &#8220;Nice crowd... most likely another wannabe adventurer.&#8221;<P>Seamus&#8217;s eyes turned dangerous. &#8220;Wannabe, eh?&#8221; He pulled the Starlight from his shoulder scabbard. It&#8217;s adamantine edge glimmered, and he put it into a practiced fighting position. &#8220;Do you call this wannabe, spear-boy?&#8221;<P>Kyrin started to back up. &#8220;Well, the rough part certainly was accurate... I think I&#8217;ll go sit on this end of the tavern, goodbye.&#8221;<P>Mayra, however, had a somewhat different reaction to the weapon,  if not the associated warrior. &#8220;Is that a holy sword? And it has an adamantine edge... can I hold that? Pleasssseeeeee?&#8221;<P>Seamus shook his head and returned to his game. An explosion sounded as the three he put down blew up in his face. He shook the ashes off, glared at the treacherous card, and deposited his cash on the table.<P>Thelis stood up, to introduce herself. It was always best to make your opponents underestimate you. &#8220;Hey, excuse my companion, he&#8217;s a little weird.&#8221; She went over to Kyrin.<P>Kyrin, lost in the world of mumbled resentment, failed entirely to notice the approaching woman&#8217;s intent. &#8220;No. Don&#8217;t want the special. I want soup and an ale. Fast. Now. Please.&#8221;<P>He received something, all right. A slap in the face. &#8220;DO I LOOK LIKE SOME SERVING GIRL?&#8221; Thelis screamed, bringing all attention to her. He winced as mana transferred itself to her voice and lashed his face.<P>&#8220; I didn&#8217;t LOOK at you in the first place, sor-ry! Leave me alone.&#8221;<P>He looked over his shoulder. &#8220;And Mayra, stop bothering the homicidal maniac. He might actually be able to do something with his little toy there.&#8221;<P>All eyes fastened on Kyrin&#8217;s face. There was a stunned silence.<P>--------------------<P>'Good is subjective.

All of chapter three.<P>The Path to Light, Chapter Three: Intent<P>Seamus&#8217;s voice was very quiet and very dangerous. &#8220;And who might you be to tell me I&#8217;m weak?&#8221;<P>Kyrin&#8217;s voice took on the nervous/superior tone of someone who knows they&#8217;re right but that it really doesn&#8217;t matter. &#8220;Actually, I never said you were weak. All I did was say you might be able to use your sword well... I never implicitly stated that you weren&#8217;t any good... though I would be surprised if you could defeat my friend over there.&#8221; Kyrin pointed to an empty seat in the opposite end of the room and dove out the window.<P>Seamus shook his head once, as if to clear something. &#8220;Wait.....what the hell just happened?&#8221; <P>Mayra shook her head. &#8220;As near as I can tell, he picked another fight he probably couldn&#8217;t win on his own.&#8221;<P>Thelis felt cold all over. &#8220;Guys...&#8221;<P>The two turned.<P>&#8220;....somebody&#8217;s in here that&#8217;s doing this.&#8221;<P>They suddenly realized the bar was empty. Empty, but for one being.<P>Keizen rippled into existence. &#8220;Well, you seem to have detected my little emotion-bending tricks... does anyone have any complaints?&#8221;<P>Weapons being drawn echoed through the bar. Thelis raised her claws. &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;ll insert them on the tip of this!&#8221; She lunged.<P>Keizen let the claws pierce his chest, then focused immense shadow energy on the wound, numbing the his attacker and throwing her to the ground. &#8220;Physical attacks. The last resort of those with strong arms and small brains... anyone want to surrender, die a painless death, your basic deal with a demon...?&#8221;<P>Thelis gritted her teeth and got up. Her body was tingling with pain, and she fell right back down again. Seamus yelled in surprise. &#8220;Who are you?&#8221;<P>&#8220;I told her...&#8221; he gestured to Thelis, &#8220;and last time I bothered to reintroduce myself, my targets teleported while I was reflecting on the exact year of my destruction of the Combine city of Aras.&#8221;<P>Thelis got up into a crouch, the best her numbed limbs could do. &#8220;He calls himself Keizen ShadowHand. A pitiful excuse for a freelance demon.&#8221;<P>Mayra muttered to herself, &#8220;hmmm... a green eye eh... that would be... dang, can&#8217;t draw a magic circle in for such a demon in a situation like this... anyone got a magical sword I could use?&#8221;<P>Kyrin, meanwhile, was sitting in a bar in the upscale part of Freeport at least 3 blocks away intimidating wannabe adventurers to boost his own wounded ego.<P>Keizen smiled. &#8220;At last someone who sees me as more than a minor nuisance! You, perhaps, I shall let live to spread word of my power! Fear is such a delicious little thing, and one of the true things those apart from the hierarchy have trouble gaining in sufficient amounts! Lets see... you claimed to wield shadow, correct? How well?&#8221; He raised a hand. &#8220;Shadow Blades!&#8221; Arcs of black energy streaked towards Thelis&#8217; shadow from Keizen&#8217;s own, causing her further wounds.<P>Thelis started screaming. But she raised her own hand and angrily gestured. &#8220;Eclipse!&#8221;<P>Blackness filled Freeport as the sun went out like a snuffed candle. A storm of black orbs raced towards Keizen, blasting into explosions of black fire as they impacted. Seamus and Mayra split up to flank the demon.<P>Keizen remained standing, but failed to maintain total composure. &#8220;It was quite a mistake to use so much magical power on a spell that is so close to my mastery... you could have accomplished as much with far lesser attacks, you know... lets hear it for property damage, my young friends! Immolation Bolts!<P>The tavern was gutted in an instant, the outer walls falling in to be consumed by the magical inferno that raged there for several seconds.<P>Kyrin looked up and saw smoke... &#8220;I hope Mayra didn&#8217;t crack... I&#8217;d hate to know how much damage she could cause if she was actually angry.&#8221;<P>Seamus swung the Starlight, it&#8217;s blade bursting into bright blue fires. His plate mail began to glow, a deep blue. The heavenly bolt struck his foe with a vengeance. Surprisingly, he heard Thelis scream as it impacted. He hoped Keizen hadn&#8217;t got her.<P>Thelis grinned as the blinding darkness filled the air. Then she screamed as holy energy rippled through the area, burning her soul. A sort of lurching feeling gripped her head for a second.<P>Holding his form against the holy energy, Keizen could not simply phase through the attacks, and was cut deeply along the shoulder and chest. Grimacing, he continued to concentrate on his next spell. The darkness grew deeper...<P>Thelis let loose a curse in demonic languages. It was a language with lots of those. Seeing that it wasn't working, she raised one energy-coated hand and spun once, yelled &#8220;Apocalypse!&#8221; and vanished.<P>Keizen glanced up from his forming globe of shadow and cursed in a very similar language. Seeing no choice, he diverted some of the sub-matter into a shield, and continued his spell.<P>Meanwhile, Mayra, having no weapons with which to strike a demon, had taken cover behind the edge of the crater that was once the tavern... as though she could see anything anyways...<P>She was soon joined by Kyrin, who looked at the amount of dark energies  being generated and decided that his lot lay as an opportunist in this situation.<P>Soon, black and purple energy coated the floor. It suddenly erupted into death and destruction, blazing it&#8217;s way into Keizen like a nova. The energy stopped erupting, pulled back, and re-coalesced into Thelis, who looked smug.<P>Keizen was injured, but now chose to let the demonic insanity that had long possessed him drive his spell... &#8220;You are foolish to continues such castings! You injure me, but my spell feeds off of such energies freed! Behold one of the highest spells of chaos magic!&#8221; Keizen began a to rise in altitude, the classic precursor to high-level castings. The darkness around the city seemed to in fact decrease as the intensity of the orb he held increased. Seamus rained blows on Keizen, but the demon didn&#8217;t even appear fazed. He waved one hand almost negligently and Seamus&#8217;s body was rocked by blows.<P>Thelis&#8217;s mind spun. She had to kill him, and QUICK! She knew exactly what to do, and she began a desperate prayer to her lord for power. &#8220;Reality Collapse!&#8221;<P>Al hell broke loose. Thelis ducked down, pulled Seamus and the two newcomers behind her, and quickly put all her power into shielding.<P>A black orb, similar to Keizen&#8217;s, appeared below him, though not as big. It swelled, then burst in one shrieking, seething, burning mass of absolute nothingness and entropy. It forced him to the ground. The shockwave obliterated all the surrounding buildings, luckily no one was left in them. Thelis&#8217;s shield was slowly burning away under the dreadful impact of two spells going off at once at such a level.<P>Keizen simply laughed again. &#8220;We will all perish! Perhaps the very city will be consumed! Unreality and chaos... quite a little mixture we&#8217;ve made! Oh, how Maarin would be proud!&#8221;<P>Thelis never knew what made her do it. She simply hurled herself into the air, and raised one glowing fist. She yelled. &#8220;ABSORPTION!&#8221; at the top of her lungs.<P>The spell energy was sucked into her hand. Abruptly seething pain erupted inside her. She felt like she was coming apart at the seams. Purple light burst out of her hands, mouth, and torso, and she shook with pain. The energy was far too great for her body, and unless she found something to do with it she would perish-violently- very, very soon.<P>Keizen screamed. &#8220;No! It will be ours! We will consume it, and it will consume you fools who stand against us!&#8221; He grabbed Thelis&#8217;s hand and tried to instead draw the energy to himself.<P>Thelis grinned horribly, whispered &#8220;You want it? Take it,&#8221; and simply let the energy go. The explosion was titanic, and it gave her a shiver to imagine what would have happened to HER if she hadn&#8217;t. Keizen was caught full in the blast. The body lost resolution in the explosion, then burst into a formless cloud of ash.<P>Thelis was tossed into the crater like a rag doll.<P>Mayra, at last revealing a measure of usefulness, began casting a spell... &#8220;Alter Plane: Force!&#8221; A shimmering shield of runes covered the rapidly expanding explosion.<P>The shockwave blasted itself off the shield, wasting it&#8217;s impotent fury until it was no more.<P>Thelis grimaced and got to her feet. Blood poured from wounds all over her, then she limped out of the battlefield, her comrades supporting her.<P>Where Keizen appeared to have died, a single emerald lay. It shone coldly, then vanished.<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>No, in case you&#8217;re wondering, that&#8217;s not the point where I reformed. I was still as evil as ever. And loved it too.  The only reason I didn&#8217;t let Freeport be destroyed is because I would die in the explosion.<P>At least that is what I told myself. Truth was, that was part of it. Another part of Listhe butting in. She managed to get through my will and tried to do the right thing. I was too wrapped up to notice.<P>In any case, I was not going to the Temple-though I told Mayra, Kyrin, and Seamus I was. I simply walked out and healed myself. Then I told them I&#8217;d gone to see them.<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>&#8220;Keizen has failed, milord.&#8221;<P>&#8220;He always was slightly overconfident. Is he alive?&#8221;<P>&#8220;I think so, but he has not reported in. Even a spell like that couldn&#8216;t kill him.&#8221;<P>&#8220;When you find him, kill him.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Milord, Keizen has always been a master of evasion. He only allied with us for the play, anyways, so I have my doubts I could best him. We cannot waste resources on retribution for his failure. We must concentrate on killing that girl and that man before the Codex&#8217;s next prediction is fulfilled.&#8221;<P>&#8220;I suppose you are right, Carth. Then they are our target?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Yes, milord Maarin.&#8221;<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>&#8220;So, where to?&#8221; Kyrin asked.<P>&#8220;You assume you are coming along with us.&#8221; Thelis said.<P>&#8220;No, I know I am. You serve Justice, so I think you&#8217;ll need my help.&#8221; Mayra, Seamus, and Thelis sighed and rolled their eyes as one.<P>&#8220;Justice can be served just as well somewhere else. Get lost-&#8221; Seamus started to say, but Thelis cut him off.<P>&#8220;No, Seamus, I think we might actually benefit from having such a formidable warrior amongst us. Don&#8217;t you think, mister Kyrin?&#8221; she asked, fluttering her eyelashes at him with a vulnerable tone.<P>Kyrin was defenseless against the practiced seduction of Thelis. &#8220;Err....I...sure. Come along Mayra.&#8221;<P>Thelis was jubilant. Another relatively pure soul for her lord meant another leap in her own status. And another step closer to even more power.<P>Thelis could not STAND the scary idea that someone other then her lord was better then her. It blasted her swollen ego apart to even try to comprehend such a thing. So she didn&#8217;t try, but assumed SHE alone was the pinnacle of non-godly power in the universe.<P>So, that was victory. &#8220;Mmm. I don&#8217;t know of any place I&#8217;d specifically like to go here. Got any ideas?&#8221;<P>Seamus shrugged. &#8220;Why go here? Why not over the mountains and go to anywhere else?&#8221;<P>Thelis nodded. &#8220;Ok. Just go forward, eh?&#8221;<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>That night, they&#8217;d gotten as far as the foothills of the mountains and the dread forest of Kithicor. Not one of them moved to go into it at night. They weren&#8217;t stupid.<P>Seamus and Kyrin were arguing philosophy. &#8220;Justice is a human concept, Kyrin. It&#8217;s not necessarily the easiest way, and you certainly shouldn&#8217;t expect to benefit from it.&#8221;<P>Kyrin retorted &#8220;But Justice is good. One benefits from good acts, no?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Not necessarily. Who do you think martyrs are?&#8221;<P>And on and on it went. Thelis made a mental note never to talk about absolutes, she&#8217;d get bogged down in a debate about something she really didn&#8217;t know much of. &#8220;What do you think, little miss evil?&#8221; Seamus asked. They&#8217;d respected her enough to let her travel with them, but they obviously didn&#8217;t trust her much.<P>Fine. Good. &#8220;...ummm.....err....&#8221;<P>&#8220;Come on, speak up!&#8221;<P>&#8220;...Er. I think that the only thing that matters is your survival and that of which you serve!&#8221; she burst out finally.<P>The stunned stares of everyone else graced her. &#8220;You&#8217;re kidding,&#8221; Mayra muttered.<P>Seamus&#8217;s face was grim. &#8220;No, she&#8217;s not. You can only expect so much from a Dark Elf, you know.&#8221; His expression was simultaneously sad and hate-filled. He turned his back on Thelis, the rest of the party following suit.<P>Thelis had never truly been the recipient of hate. She shrank back, despair breaking into the vault of her mind. Sadness that Seamus hated her, but she knew she deserved it.<P>Fear attacked Thelis, dreadful fear, for she knew what was going on. Hey, wait........LISTHE! Stop tampering with me!<P>You&#8217;ve got no real reason to hate him, you know. You deserve his hatred.<P>You, shut up! I&#8217;ll make him pay for this! AND you for making that slip!<P>What&#8217;s he doing wrong?<P>HE&#8217;S HATING ME!<P>And you hate him, though why is beyond me. <P>A lot is beyond you, Listhe! You were too scared to grow into a destined role. I&#8217;m far superior to you. You&#8217;re a MORTAL. A dead mortal, even more, your own body enslaved by a superior version of yourself! YOU ARE NOTHING!!. So why should I listen to you?<P>Even assuming you are right and I AM nothing, you aren&#8217;t thinking like a superior. Is hate supposed to be one-way? I hope you&#8217;re enjoying the joys of mutual hatred.<P>As if a sword in Listhe&#8217;s spectral hands, the pain stabbed into Thelis&#8217;s mind like a white-hot knife.<P>She screamed silently. Argh! Why do you have to make me suffer?<P>BECAUSE YOU&#8217;RE GETTING EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANTED!!!! Hatred&#8217;s what you think is the highest feeling, is it not? It&#8217;s not MY fault you&#8217;re a hypocrite.<P>I don&#8217;t deserve this!<P>And he does?<P>That&#8217;s different!<P>Why?<P>Uncertainty gripped Thelis with it&#8216;s icy claws.  Because....because.....I...I&#8217;m better then everyone else!<P>What proof do you have of that?<P>I AM A DEMON! They&#8217;re merely mortals! THEY EXIST TO BE MY PLAYTHINGS!<P>They feel pain just as much as you do, Thelis. Actually, I think they&#8217;re superior to you. You see, they think beyond their own pleasure.<P>Thelis&#8217;s world seemed to spiral down into an abyss of suffering. As her own voice-Listhe&#8217;s- echoed horribly in her brain, she fell down, hands holding her head in an attempt to stop that voice which frightened her so. It didn&#8217;t work, and as she fell to her knees and struck herself in the back of the head, blackness claimed her vision.<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Seamus started as he heard Thelis slump to the dirt. He leapt to his feet, and cradled her in his arms. But she was unconscious, and what was more, she was clearly having a nightmare.<P>Guild flowed through Seamus like a flood. Why did I go and say that?<P>He had no idea. It just....slipped out. Something was very wrong.<P>He spoke aloud. &#8220;Get some blankets and put them on her.&#8221; He turned to his whetstone and his texts, but he could not escape the lingering feeling that something far greater then he had imagined was going on.<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>In the landscape of her nightmares, Thelis rolled and twisted and blasted at a foe wearing her face and speaking with her voice.<P>&#8220;Get away from me, Listhe!&#8221; she shrieked, terror adding a panicked tone to her words.<P>Listhe paid no heed, but Thelis continued to feel her attempts to take over her mind. Listhe laughed, and the succubae shrieked in agony.<P>&#8220;GET AWAY or I&#8217;ll kill you! I&#8216;m me, stop trying to take me over or I&#8216;ll.....&#8221;<P>&#8220;Go ahead and try it.&#8221; Listhe laughed again, and Thelis&#8217;s bones chilled under the assault of cold-undiluted fear.<P>Thelis lunged, claws bursting into life. They slid smoothly into Listhe&#8217;s torso, right into her heart. Listhe screamed and blood exploded from the wound onto the imagined terrain. But something else was happening too.<P>Thelis&#8217;s chest split open in the exact sort of wound. Her black heart burst. Blood poured from Thelis&#8217;s mouth, and she looked up through red-tinged, tear-stained eyes and saw Listhe&#8217;s own wounds healing shut as her own widened and Listhe&#8217;s face twisting into pleasure as agony increased in Thelis.<P>Thelis crawled over to the still-standing Listhe. As the dream began to fade, a horrible change came upon her. The wound of her death opened again. Her body began to writhe and shift, features changing and blurring and melting like wax, while she screamed in agony. Thelis stared at her own hands and saw blood pouring from them. Blood that wasn&#8217;t hers. She looked up, and.....and..<P>As Listhe&#8217;s body changed and changed, Thelis began to lose control over her own body. Her hands moved when she didn&#8217;t want them to, her legs walked without asking her permission first. She saw through eyes incapable of being moved by herself, thought in a mind incapable of thought without it being stifled, and her mind began to dissolve, memories vanishing and feelings and emotions and being sucked from her until finally....<P>&#8220;NO!!!!!!&#8221; Thelis screamed as she bolted upright. The scream echoed across the West Commons, vanishing eventually. Her fears did not follow suit.<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>All right. Let&#8217;s get something straight. That dream was not Listhe&#8217;s doing. It was my own fear. Only at the end did Listhe try to influence me. But someone else was stirring my worst nightmares and using them against me. Someone else...<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Shuddering limbs holding her upright, Thelis threw up again. She wiped her mouth, then promptly doubled over and threw up again.<P>&#8220;This is getting annoying...&#8221; she muttered.<P>&#8220;Here.&#8221; Seamus was standing above her. He offered her a drink.<P>&#8220;Thanks, but I think I&#8217;d just lose it all over again.&#8221; she stammered. &#8220;I-urk!&#8221;<P>He knelt down. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t have said that. It&#8217;s not my place to criticize your race or your beliefs.&#8221; He sighed. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;<P>The temptation to reach over and give him a hug-no, no! He&#8217;s the enemy, this is a role! Thelis, you&#8217;re going to kill him!<P>She smiled and gave him a hug. You&#8217;re just faking, remember that. But he&#8217;s....stop thinking that line of thought.! &#8220;Thank you.&#8221;<P>Seamus let go and resumed his sleep. Thelis simply sat awake all night, as she neither needed sleep nor wanted it.<P>--------------------<P>'Good is subjective. Evil never changes.'<P>Yakov Shadeleaf, Ranger of the twentieth season.

Chapter four is done.<P>The Path To Light, Chapter Four: Malicious Intent<P>Kyrin avoided looking at the gorge. It was mid-afternoon in the East Karanas, and the sun shone everywhere-but that nasty drop.<P>&#8220;Scared of heights, Kyrin?&#8221; Seamus asked.<P>Kyrin nodded once, face white. &#8220;When I was knighted, Voxx took me flying. Worst experience I ever had.&#8221;<P>Thelis was intrigued. &#8220;Tell me about this Knight thing.&#8221;<P>Mayra smirked. &#8220;You don&#8217;t want to get him started.&#8221;<P>Kyrin chose to ignore that. &#8220;The Knights are a group of people who figured &#8216;what the heck&#8217; and got brave enough to get close to Voxx. Not one of em beat her ever, but she gave em some power and prestige as a reward for courage.&#8221; He pulled up his cloak hem, and revealed a bracer on his right arm with some weird writing on it. &#8220;That&#8217;s the symbol.&#8221;<P>Seamus said &#8220;Hm.&#8221; He pulled his horse up for a second, then looked at Mayra. &#8220;And what might you be?&#8221;<P>Mayra shrugged. &#8220;A collector.&#8221;<P>Seamus was curious, but he kept his mouth shut. He looked out on the horizon. The Karanas were a troubled land at the moment. A plague, rampant outlaws, and a crops shortage were taking their toll. He saw some smoke on the horizon, and sighed.<P>&#8220;More trouble.&#8221; he said quietly.<P>&#8220;Excellent,&#8221; was Kyrin&#8217;s reply. &#8220;You guys got all the fun in Freeport. We had to watch.&#8221; He looked. &#8220;Got any idea of who the attackers are and who are the defenders?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Not at all.&#8221; Seamus looked harder. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see any banners, and there don&#8217;t appear to be cavalry. There looks like some things in the air, though.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Lovely.&#8221; Kyrin said. &#8220;Well, let&#8217;s go!&#8221;<P>They started moving faster. The smoke climbed higher. Thelis could see the battlefield now. Black-robed humans attacked villagers and guards without mercy or parley. The guards fought back, of course, but while they were powerful and valiant, they simply couldn&#8216;t deal with the incredible numbers they faced without help. And in the air flew dark, winged, humanoid forms. Two of them to be exact. Their faces were dreadful, staring, eyes filled with madness and indistinct expressions twisted and cruel. They had no visible body otherwise, all cloaked in black, heavy plate that dripped darkness onto the plain. Each carried a barbed, hooked, and saw-edged sword. Thelis thought for a moment, then identified them. Plague Knights, demonic cavaliers.<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Hold on a second. I forgot to mention something. <P>Hell is shared among the &#8216;evil&#8217; gods. They all need demons, so each plane they control has a gateway to Hell. Innoruuk is the most frequent user of them, but by no means is he the only one. Bertoxxulus has a strange love of the more diseased and disturbing ones, such as Plague Knights and Reapers, and while Cazic-Thule doesn&#8217;t really use many as troops, he binds quite a few to his Hell Knights, usually either Fiends or Reaper spirits, by turning them into Familiars.<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>As for the ground enemies, they were wearing symbols, of a skull face laughing and a greenish mist. &#8220;The Bloodsabres,&#8221; Kyrin muttered.<P>Then with a savage yell he spurred his horse to charge and rode through the enemy ranks with great sweeps of his double-edged polearm. Men fell, bleeding and dying, before they even knew what hit them.<P>&#8220;That&#8217;s torn it! That IDIOT!&#8221; Mayra yelled, then spurred her own horse and pulled out a wicked-looking saber.<P>Thelis looked up, ignited claws, and leapt off her horse and into the melee. Blood followed her path in, so Seamus assumed she was doing all right.<P>That left the two aerial foes for Seamus. He tapped a boot, then shouted something. His boots ignited in sky-blue fire, and trailing it, he rose up into the air to confront the enemy.<P>One of them turned and howled something at his companion, then the deadly blade flew at Seamus&#8217;s face. Seamus parried it and  countered with a rising thrust which was blocked just as easily.<P>They circled, each swinging blows the other blocked. Sparks flew as Starlight smashed into it&#8217;s demonic counterpart. Seamus tried most of his simpler tricks, first. Rising cross-slashes, double cuts, the simplest of attacks designed to test an opponent&#8217;s ability. The opponent could take it, and he parried each stroke without effort.<P> The second Plague Knight got closer, face filled with hunger. He raised his arm and a greenish red ball appeared in his palm. &#8220;Plague Bolt!&#8221; The ball fired itself toward Seamus.<P>Seamus coughed and gagged as the evil miasma filled his nostrils. He lost a bit of altitude, then looked up. &#8220;You asked for it!&#8221; he yelled, then raised his own hand in mimicry. Blue fire covered him for a second, then a bluish-white ball of pure energy came into being at the tip of his fingertips. &#8220;Celestial Orb!&#8221; he shouted, then let the ball be suspended in midair, and swung a huge blow with Starlight.<P>The bluish orb flashed towards the target, and when it hit the spherical explosion tore the Plague Knight to shreds and left the few remnants burning blue fire on their way down.<P>Seamus grinned and turned his attention back to swordplay. Blade rebounded off blade, as each swordsman tried to exploit a weakness in his opponent. Seamus was intrigued, for this being was almost as good as he was. Not good enough, however.<P>As the swordsman pulled back in preparation for a wild cleave, Seamus&#8217;s arm snaked out and punched him in the face. As the foe lurched back, Seamus swung his final strike, severing his target in two at the waist. As the two halves dropped to the earth, Seamus blasted them into charred ashes with a single thought to make SURE they were dead.<P>He looked down at what was taking place.<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Thelis sliced open another man and dropped him to the floor with a scything kick which snapped his leg like a twig. Her opponent howled, then fell dying or dead.<P>Mayra&#8217;s horse took a javelin in the stomach and fell. That didn&#8217;t faze her, as she leapt off her dead mount and with a storm of saber thrusts drove a bunch of neat holes into her foe. The man fell like a rock, and while his comrades struggled to attack her, she raised her hands without changing expression and shouted &#8220;Frost Bolt!&#8221; A spear of icy cold leapt forth from her and froze the attackers, their last moments immortalized in ice.<P>Kyrin was wreaking havoc with his peculiar weapon. He would slash one man, then continue his movement to twirl around, deflecting all attacks. He raised his weapon and spun it once. &#8220;Death Vortex!&#8221; A nightmare tornado was summoned in front of him, and the ground was spattered with blood-and worse- of his victims.<P>Then a dark figure rose up from the earth. His laughter filled the area. &#8220;Good show.&#8221; he said quietly.<P>Thelis didn&#8217;t even hesitate. She ran at the man with arms raised and slashed downward.<P>A previously unseen black wing smashed her back. She tumbled to the ground,. then leapt up and studied the enemy closer. <P>He looked human to a first glance, perhaps like a half-elf. But his eyes were strange, one hazel, one purple, and the two wings rose from his shoulders. Dressed in plate of the color of midnight, he was wearing a helm that covered nearly all of his face, save his mouth and his eyes. He laughed again. &#8220;Nice try, my dear.&#8221;<P>Thelis waited. This guy was obviously a demon of some kind. &#8220;What and who are you?&#8221;<P>&#8220;My name is Cerran.&#8221; He raised his forearms. &#8220;And your life is mine!&#8221; Steel blades appeared in his gauntleted hands, and he slashed at Thelis, ripping her open at the shoulder and driving her to the ground.<P>Seamus flashed down from the sky and dropped on top of him. Cerran couldn&#8217;t have known what hit him, but it drove him to the earth. Seamus raised the blade to finish it, but Cerran&#8217;s form flickered and he appeared about five feet away. His laughter was mocking and ominous. &#8220;You&#8217;re fast. But not fast enough!&#8221; He raised his arms and blades sought Seamus&#8217;s life. But they bounced off Starlight. Sparks flew as faster and faster the two fought, faces twisted into masks of hatred and arms cracking with the massive blows, while Thelis cried in pain on the ground. The blades of steel and adamant left glowing trails in the air, gray and blue and red with blood.<P>Seamus simply could not get through. But Cerran was no better. He was learning, but so was his opponent. Cerran had obviously been a swordsman, so time to leave that arena behind. &#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;re ticklish, spawn! Red Dawn!&#8221;<P>A fell light shone on the battlefield, and the ground erupted into scorching red fires. Cerran&#8217;s scream was terrible, and he again flickered out of view for a moment.<P>But only for a moment. He reappeared with a clenched fist glowing bright red. &#8220;I can do that too, you know! Pyre!&#8221;<P>Seamus gritted his teeth and swung an upward blow, parrying the burst of fire and turning it into a counterattack. Cerran tried to evade, but it slid into his black body and ripped a long, bloody wound there. Seamus wasn&#8217;t finished yet, either. He raised his sword in both hands, cut with a yell of &#8220;Sunder!&#8221;,  then energy erupted from it and a thin red line split the earth and caused a huge explosion when it hit Cerran.<P>Cerran grinned and raised both arms. They glowed bright, deadly, bloody red, then a he raised one arm and a reddish ball appeared in his palm. With his own shout of  &#8220;Firestorm!&#8221; it exploded, causing a huge, tornado-like eruption of scorching heat and deadly energy.<P>Seamus was engulfed in flame, yelling in pain and driven into a crouch. He tried to get into a guard, but he&#8217;d never recover in time. He knew that.<P>Then Mayra jumped onto Cerran, swinging a veritable storm of saber blows. Since Cerran was a demon and Mayra&#8217;s saber a normal blade, it did no harm. But it distracted him enough for Kyrin to get into position. He held his spear-like weapon high, then drove it into Cerran with a terrible sound, white-plated arm actually pushing into the demon&#8217;s body.<P>Cerran pulled himself off the blade, the flesh melding back together. &#8216;Regeneration...&#8217; Thelis thought. He laughed again. &#8220;Innovative. And very integrated. But of course you have the advantage. I&#8217;ll have to ask Maarin for more support then these useless Bloodsabres.&#8221; He waved one hand. &#8220;Until next time, my dear. Please try to be a little less stupid-you might not get away with it any more.&#8221;<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>The villagers gave them shelter for the night and a Healer to fix Thelis&#8217;s shoulder. The rest of them were also tended to. Seamus talked with the captain of the guard over the attack. &#8220;So, you&#8217;ve seen em before?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Yes. The Bloodsabres are worshippers of Bertoxxulus, an evil god of plague who caused this awful situation.&#8221; The woman looked harried. &#8220;If we ever found their base....they&#8217;d be dead. But nobody has ever managed to.&#8221;<P>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to hear that. Is it likely we&#8217;ll have much more trouble before Qeynos?&#8221;<P>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so, not from normal troublemakers anyways. Just stay on the roads, it might take a week or so to get across though. But there are inns and guardhouses spread across the plains. As long as you don&#8217;t leave the road, you should be fine. That is if the Swarm doesn&#8216;t attack you, but there&#8216;s all of the Karanas for them to roam, so it&#8216;s unlikely.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Thank you, Commander.&#8221;<P>&#8220;It&#8217;s our honor to have assisted a Paladin of Tunare.&#8221;<P>Seamus bowed and walked back to the path. &#8220;They seem very frightened. I think that these sort of raids are more common then they let on.&#8221;<P>Kyrin nodded. &#8220;Another sign of the times. Justice and Honor are trampled underneath for quick gain.&#8221;<P>Mayra and Thelis rolled their eyes.<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>It was four days later, when, in an area devoid of guardhouses, they were forced to camp out. Thelis groaned at the prospect of eating her own cooking (which was terrible, but she wouldn&#8216;t trust Seamus with a pot or pan to save her life). They set up beds, cots, and spent the evening doing what they always did. Kyrin and Seamus ranting and raving at one another about morality, Mayra watching-much to her amusement- and Thelis trying to play solitary card games.<P> After a scant meal, she lay down and went to sleep. The others followed suit, falling into such a deep sleep that death himself wouldn&#8217;t have woken them.<P>Or so it appeared. Mayra stood up, then started. &#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t be here, Esta.&#8221;<P>A black shape, obviously female, was standing just out of reach of the firelight. There was a clinking sound. &#8220;Neither should you, Shalindre.&#8221; She stepped closer.<P>Thelis almost gasped and gave away her disguise. The woman was not a normal adventurer, obviously. A powerful one, too, from the reddish aura surrounding her pale body. She was in body similar to a young wood elf woman, but her skin was dead white and her hair blond. She had one blue and one purple eye. Thelis had never seen anything like her.<P>&#8220;I&#8217;m assuming you&#8217;re not just coming to say hello.&#8221; Mayra&#8217;s hands flickered, and from her fist erupted a saber made of flame.<P>&#8220;Now, now, Shalindre, I thought we&#8217;d agreed to be civilized.&#8221;<P>&#8220;I can&#8217;t remember that we ever agreed, period.&#8221;<P>&#8216;Esta&#8217; waved her hand dismissively. &#8220;Immaterial. Why are you getting involved in this?&#8221;<P>Mayra looked angry for the first time Thelis could remember. &#8220;She&#8217;s just a girl, Esta!&#8221;<P>Esta smiled, a mirthless, threatening smile. &#8220;And it&#8217;s none of your business. Do I really have to make this physical?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Yes, you do.&#8221; Mayra raised her saber into a guard.<P>Esta laughed. &#8220;You underestimate me. Again.&#8221; She traced a circle in the dusty soil. A line of fire followed her finger as she inscribed designs, stars, runes, in the circle. They began to glow a pale white. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see you deal with Lord Maarin&#8217;s chosen.&#8221; She shouted something.<P>A blinding white flash erupted from the center of the circle and engulfed Esta&#8217;s form. It formed a globe, then the globe sank back into the soil.<P>And the woman standing in the center of the circle was not the same. She was now dressed in black, ethereal plate that somehow managed to protect her and show quite a bit at the same time. Two large, black, scaled wings burst out of her shoulders, and she was floating in the air, neither foot touching the ground. She was holding a massive, whip-like chain in one hand, the other glowed bright red. Her eyes burned with a seething flame, and her face was no longer visible above the mouth, hidden beneath an almost entirely covering helmet and visor. Purple skulls appeared and disappeared around her, like some evil barrier.<P>&#8220;Deal with this, Shalindre? I&#8216;ll enjoy spilling your blood and tearing your charges apart!&#8221; She raised the chain.<P>&#8220;You seem to have learned some new tricks, Esta,&#8221; Mayra remarked.<P>She smiled and drew an identical circle in the dust. The flash which followed this one knocked Thelis out cold.<P>Mayra looked similar when it was done. She was dressed in white, though, and it was solid, hardened mithril and platinum, covering her entire body. Her own hair was still visible(a reddish brown), as she wore no helm. Her wings were white energy, ghostly and obviously insubstantial, but they held her up all the same. She was also still carrying her saber, and no barrier surrounded her, nor did her eyes burn with that hungry look.<P>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you a first-hand demonstration!&#8221; the woman said, then soared at Mayra like an omen of death. Chain rang off saber like a bell. Mayra&#8217;s counterattack hurled Esta back, then she waited for the next attack.<P>&#8220;Is that the best you can do?&#8221;<P>Evidently, it wasn&#8217;t, because Esta shrieked &#8220;Harbinger!&#8221; and a wail of despair filled the air, corrupt energy rippling and distorting. Mayra doubled over slightly and rebounded back, her cry of pain echoing.<P>Mayra&#8217;s smile was cold when she recovered. &#8220;Sunstrike!&#8221; A blindingly hot beam of light crossed the distance and tore into Esta&#8217;s black-clad body.<P>Esta screamed, then looked up with eyes promising death. &#8220;Die, Shalindre!&#8221; She raised her glowing fist. &#8220;Doom Strike!&#8221; A bolt of darkness and nothingness flew down, and hit Mayra, burning holes in her and dissipating.<P>Mayra&#8217;s agonized cry threatened to wake the whole area as the fabric of reality which made up her threatened to disintegrate. She looked at Esta with pure hatred and battle rage. &#8220;Play time is over, Esta! Holy!&#8221;<P>A pillar of white light plummeted from the heavens and struck Esta back. She wailed, again and again and again. When it vanished, Esta was clutching her chest trying to stop the black energy that was her life flowing out of her as well as blood. She glared at Mayra, then cried out again and vanished.<P>Mayra flickered once and returned to her normal appearance. She glanced about the camp, then lay down and went to sleep.<P>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>&#8220;You&#8217;ve failed me, Cerran, Esta.&#8221;<P>&#8220;My lord, I&#8217;m sorry. Your support was just target practice for them-&#8221;<P>&#8220;SILENCE! I will deal with you later. And you, Esta, what is your excuse?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Shalindre was with them, sir. She..&#8221;<P>&#8220;She overpowered you, eh? Well, it&#8217;s really a shame. To think I have given you so much-and you still fail me.&#8221; A hand was raised out of the darkness of a robe sleeve. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to teach you a lesson, Esta.&#8221;<P>&#8220;No, lord, please-&#8221; she screamed in agony as ice coated her and she began to freeze. &#8220;Please, no more, NOT AGAIN!&#8221;<P>The hand paid no heed, but the air surrounding the screaming woman got even colder. She shrieked.<P>The hand lowered slowly. &#8220;I trust you don&#8217;t ever want to fail me again, do you Esta?&#8221;<P>&#8220;..no lord, please, no more...&#8221;<P>&#8220;That particular matter is entirely up to you. I do not want to hear of your failure again. Only the interesting manner of their deaths, and their screams. I WILL NOT TOLERATE ANOTHER FAILURE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Y...yes.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Good.&#8221; The hand withdrew back into the sleeve. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see what I can do about more support next time. But trust me, minions, you will not fail me. If you do, I&#8217;ll make the consequences unpleasant. Do your duty or die in the attempt, do not come here to tell me you did nothing to them.&#8221;<P>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Thelis awoke. She wanted to question Mayra about the night instantly, but for some reason, she couldn&#8217;t speak at all about it. Whenever she tried, her tongue would seize up.<P>She had so many questions. And worst of all, if Mayra was what she seemed to be, Thelis&#8217;s own life was in danger. Mayra wouldn&#8217;t think twice, but slice her open, if she ever found out. So it was time to make sure she didn&#8217;t slip.<P>Over the next few days, her ability to act was tested to it&#8217;s utmost. It was a relief when they finally got to Qeynos, on a gray, cloudy day.<P>Seamus walked his horse up to the gates. Strange. Thelis could see no guards, no challenging sentries. And weirder yet, she could hear nothing. No cries of merchants hawking their wares, no civilian conversation. nothing but the howling rain, as banners swung loosely against their poles.<P>But that was not as it should be. The city was a bustling one. Life surged within it! But try as she might with eyes, ears, or mind, there was no evidence of habitation.<P>A peculiar smell came to her nostrils. A smoky one, one of fear and battle. And now that she noticed it, a thin plume of smoke rose up from the city center.<P>Seamus looked puzzled. &#8220;There&#8217;s no one here. They&#8217;re all gone!&#8221;<P>Kyrin grasped his spear tighter. &#8220;But what could force such a huge city to evacuate it&#8217;s inhabitants?&#8221; he asked.<P>Seamus shook his head. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; He pointed. &#8220;I think trouble&#8217;s going on. Get your weapons out, but let&#8217;s go inside.&#8221;<P>Thelis spoke up. &#8220;Do we take our mounts?&#8221;<P>&#8220;No. The city is too confined. If something has truly attacked, we&#8217;re better off on foot.&#8221;<P>--------------------<P>'Good is subjective. Evil never changes.'<P>Yakov Shadeleaf, Ranger of the twentieth season.

I'm posting all of Chapter Five.<P>If you like explosions, you'll LOVE Six.<P> Path To The Light, Chapter Five: Ghost Town<P>Qeynos was deserted. Nothing moved inside it. But the seeming docile air was ruptured by the smoke of burning buildings. The stench of battle was heavy inside the dead city, and bodies lay where they had fallen, golden armor being the only light in the gray rain. Thelis stared, for many of the wounds were from the exact same weapons. Blades, a massive, heavy implement, the massive, terrible wounds a halberd bestows. A few were also slain by some large, katana-style blade, broken and snapped like a child breaks a branch over his knee. There were few civilian casualties, and no other dead soldiers but the Qeynos guards.<P>Thelis began to feel afraid. They stopped at the wrecked clock, it&#8217;s working snapped as if out of wantonness. A voice ripped into the still air. &#8220;Pretty, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; It was a raspy, cynical, sarcastic voice.<P>A soldier, mortally wounded by the looks of it, lay slumped against the ruined clock. Thelis knelt next to him. &#8220;What happened? Who attacked?&#8221;<P>The man looked up. &#8220;Four. Four attackers. Three were men, one woman.&#8221; His unfocused eyes met Thelis&#8217;s own. &#8220;They tore us apart. Nobody could even hit them. They ordered all the civilians to leave, and the survivors of the guard. They didn&#8217;t find me.&#8221; He began to shake. &#8220;Nobody could hurt them. They tore us apart.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Relax, relax, it&#8217;s all right. They won&#8217;t hurt you any more.&#8221; Thelis grabbed his hand. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to take care of them. Just rest.&#8221;<P>&#8220;...thank you, lady.&#8221; A minute later he was dead.<P>Thelis stood up. &#8220;So four attackers,&#8221; Seamus said. &#8220;It&#8217;d be a good idea to take them each one on one, if nothing else to prevent collateral damage. There are probably survivors laying around.<P>Thelis nodded. &#8220;Let&#8217;s split up.&#8221; She pointed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll stay here. The rest of you...go any way.&#8221; She waited.<P>Silently, they each took an exit. Thelis waited, back to the clock. Soon, what she had been waiting for came into existence. A man, dressed in gray and hooded. She had never seen him before. In his hands lay a long, sharp, deadly red katana.<P>Thelis concentrated for a second before summoning an identical, though dark, transparent, purple bladed, katana. &#8220;Who are you?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Convenient. I won&#8217;t have to go looking for you.&#8221;<P>&#8220;I said.....who are you?&#8221; she shouted.<P>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you impatient?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Very well. My name is Carth.&#8221; He removed his hood. His features were regular and faintly alien.<P>&#8220;And?&#8221;<P>&#8220;And what?&#8221; he asked, faintly amused.<P>&#8220;And why are you here?&#8221; she yelled, angry at being ignored.<P>&#8220;To kill you. Isn&#8217;t that sort of obvious? You&#8217;re remarkably dense.&#8221; His voice was conversational.<P>&#8220;DON&#8217;T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT!!!!&#8221;<P>&#8220;Why? Does it hurt your feelings? Oh my.&#8221; He slashed the katana through the air experimentally. His eyes opened wide, and Thelis stared at his purple and gray eyes. His voice was cold, barely even holding emotion.<P>Wait......<P>Memory flashed. She saw Keizen laughing, eyes burning with an evil glare. One green eye, one........<P>&#8220;Purple eye. You&#8217;re Maarin&#8217;s!&#8221; she yelled. She got into a fighting stance, legs kept close and both hands grasping the katana hilt and holding it diagonal to the ground.<P>Carth demonstrated he wasn&#8217;t unfamiliar with a sword either, mirroring the stance. &#8220;Astute observation. Most people don&#8217;t see the significance,&#8221; he added, pointing to the purple eye.<P>&#8220;Who is Maarin? What does he want?&#8221; she asked.<P>&#8220;Why should I tell you?&#8221; he replied, laughter plain in his voice. &#8220;It won&#8217;t be any good to you, if you&#8217;re dead!&#8221; He lunged.<P>Katana struck katana with a resounding hiss, as the two energy weapons clashed off one another. Thelis grinned. &#8220;Not so easy, huh?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Merely a diversion, my dear.&#8221; His foot flashed under her guard and scythed her legs, driving her to the ground with the wind knocked out of her. She rolled, parrying slash after slash. <P>&#8220;Is that the best you can do?&#8221; she shouted, spinning to her feet. &#8220;Slashes and kicks? This Maarin will have to hire better assassins.&#8221; Energy gathered in her left hand, and she yelled &#8220;Shadow Wave!&#8221; With a scream, she threw the energy ball, where it impacted on the floor and exploded into a wave of absolute night.<P>His blade flashed upward, and the wave bounced off it, flying back into Thelis with a sucking noise. &#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t want you to overexert yourself, my little succubae. But if you say so...&#8221; He raised his hand, pointed at Thelis, then straight up. &#8220;Anarchy Spear!&#8221;<P>A lance of chaos erupted from the ground and skewered Thelis, then soared into the sky. She doubled over, then caught herself with one hand, pivoted, and ripped at Carth with a sparkling sword. Rebounding off his torso with a kick, she got to a safe distance and cried &#8220;Nether Bolt!&#8221;<P>A shriek rent the air, and a bolt of the despair and chaos of the lower regions of the human soul leapt across the dead air and drilled into Carth. Now it was his turn to double over. He growled out &#8220;Perhaps you aren&#8217;t as bad as you look,&#8221; then got in close with his blade.<P>Thelis parried his first attack, then slammed him with a flying roundhouse kick which spun him around hard. He shook his head to clear it, then responded with a crushing one-two-three combo which slashed chunks out of her left side&#8217;s leather armor and bit into her skin like a shark&#8217;s ripping bite.<P>Screaming incoherently, she charged him, slashing huge blows designed to separate his head from his body. But he parried each and every one. Carth&#8217;s speed with his hands and body wasn&#8217;t just dazzling, wasn&#8217;t even on the magical level....It was simply insane. Frustrated, she tried another one, trying to imitate Seamus. But his contemptuous laugh told her she failed, and he bashed her sword out of her hand and slashed her left leg, causing her to collapse to the floor.<P>She was torn, one half wanting to plead for mercy, the other refusing to look weak. Carth loomed over her. &#8220;Get up.&#8221;<P>&#8220;......&#8221;<P>&#8220;Get up, now.&#8221; He waved his hand, and without asking permission from her brain she felt herself get up. &#8220;Die on your feet. Die like a warrior.&#8221;<P>And without another word he thrust his blade into her, tip ripping out of her back. She screamed and began to cry in pain, doubling over trying to stop the bleeding. Carth&#8217;s grin was ugly, and he twisted it inside her, to more screams. She toppled over, and all light left her eyes as they shut, her breathing stopped and her body stiffened as death claimed it.<P>Carth laughed hideously. &#8220;It is done, milord! It is done! Thelis Pallashade is dead at my hands. The Codex has been dispelled!&#8221; He laughed again, then tensed and vanished.<P>Thelis&#8217;s body lay sprawled on the stones. A strange sort of noise came from it, something like a crack, and strangely the wounds began to close and the skin glow slightly. Skin reattached itself, and the death wound disappeared entirely. Her body un-stiffened, and within moments her eyes opened. Another cracking noise, and her heart started again. Life returned to her body and she got up on one knee as the corona disappeared.<P>She coughed up some blood onto the stones, then tried to steady herself. &#8220;I need to learn to use a sword better.&#8221; she muttered. Maybe she could talk to Seamus. She stared at the remaining wounds on her body.<P>Adrenaline still surged within her. She was terrified by how close she had gotten to death. Abruptly she got up and ran for someone, anyone.<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>All right, all right. I&#8217;ll pause for admiration for a second.  I bet you&#8217;re wondering how I pulled THAT one off. I could wink and say &#8216;Trade secret&#8217;, but no. <P>It&#8217;s really very simple. I simply turned myself into a corpse even as he was killing me, and left my own body as an effect of the transformation. It died without me in it, so I didn&#8217;t really die-sort of. It depends on whether the being Thelis is my body, or my spirit, as the Codex sees it.<P>Do you really want an explanation of shape-shifting and the precise results of becoming a spirit and physics of it-and especially the physics of returning to your body?<P>I didn&#8217;t think so. Maybe later, when I figure it out myself. It was touch-and-go, instinctive sort of stuff which I think would be rather hard to try and duplicate.<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Kyrin advanced. He checked the arena, shuddering at the bloodstains. It looked like the guards had held out here, and had been massacred. He wondered, what had enough power to kill an entire garrison?<P>He stepped into the center of the fighting grounds. Abruptly the slamming of the portcullis announced the way was shut behind him. Kyrin winced and put a hand on his spear haft. &#8220;Come out.&#8221;<P>A maniacal laugh answered him. Kyrin tried to look brave and just, but the trembling in his knees belied his bold posture. As his eyes searched the arena, he was distracted enough to think &#8216;Typical. Why am I always saddled with crazies?&#8217;<P>A man in red steel armor stepped out from behind a pillar. He was wielding a huge halberd, and his eyes were filled with madness. One red, one purple. His face was hideously scarred. He threw back his head and laughed. &#8220;Come to give me another?&#8221; He was big enough for a Barbarian, but as Cerran had, a pair of wings extended from the back of his armor.<P>&#8220;Another what?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Another meal!&#8221; Kyrin suddenly noticed the man&#8217;s armor was spattered with things he would rather not think about. But immediately the instinct for &#8216;good&#8217; awoke in him, and he yelled back a challenge.<P>&#8220;Hey, scar-face! I&#8217;m going to kill you in the name of everything right. Ready to die?&#8221; And with that he vanished into the arena&#8217;s obstructions with a jump.<P>The man growled like an animal. His insane eyes searched the arena. &#8220;Come out, come out wherever you are!&#8221; His voice was as hideous as the rest of him. Abruptly he rose into the air, then turned one of the obstacles into dust and pieces of stone.<P>Kyrin&#8217;s spear bit into his stomach. He snarled and tried to hit the Knight back, but Kyrin was already leaping for another obstacle. He raised his spear and shouted: &#8220;Lightning Wave!&#8221; As indicated in the spell&#8217;s name, a sheet of electricity flowed out and zapped the Barbarian.<P>&#8220;You&#8217;re pretty stupid to challenge the great Carchal!&#8221; the foe roared, then shattered obstacles with wild swings of his halberd.<P>Kyrin darted in, pierced Carchal&#8217;s breastplate again, and slipped out of the way before the slow-witted man could react. &#8220;Thanks for the name. You know, I think your mother was a troll. You&#8217;re ugly enough, and stupid enough.&#8221;<P>&#8220;I&#8217;ll teach you! Shockwave!&#8221; Carchal raised the huge weapon and swung a massive, crushing blow, plummeting from the air and striking. Not Kyrin, but the ground in front of him.<P>Kyrin was knocked onto his back by a massive explosion. He scrambled up with a slight limp, but his tongue and his ego would not allow him to look even hurt. &#8220;Hey, maybe you aren&#8217;t as dumb as you look. That&#8217;s still not saying much.&#8221; He regained his balance, then unleashed a storm of stabs and thrusts at Carchal, ripping into his arms and face.<P>Carchal&#8217;s strategy seemed to be brute force. His crushing blows rarely impacted on Kyrin, who was moving fast enough to be dancing, but when it did it ripped into his armor like a hurricane hits a hut on the shore. Carchal finally learned enough to start blocking, getting serious, but Kyrin&#8217;s own experience was also considerable.<P>Steel blade bounced off wooden halberd haft. Again, and again. Kyrin was getting annoyed. He was supposed to be winning here! He took Carchal&#8217;s increasingly frenzied attacks with back flips and parries, never striking a blow of his own.  Finally, he gripped the handle of his weapon in one hand and brought it back behind his body, waiting for an attack.<P>Carchal assumed that he was unguarded, and struck. The halberd slammed into the ground like a sledgehammer, and a shockwave actually caused a slight rumble in the ground and things not bolted down to be knocked off the surface. Kyrin however danced to one side, lightly tapped both Carchal&#8217;s shoulders to numb his arms with a gauntleted fist, and spun around with a huge slash from his double-edged weapon, shredding the red breastplate like a chew toy and cutting deeply into the flesh beneath in a silvery blur of steel and death with a savage yell.<P>Blood exploded out from the impact, drenching the ground. Carchal grunted, but his mind was too primitive to truly appreciate the pain he should be feeling. He winced. &#8220;You just hurt me.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Yes, I think I did.&#8221; Kyrin drawled insultingly as he ceased spinning and resumed his guard posture. &#8220;Are you done? Or do I need to cut another hundred pounds of fat out of you?&#8221;<P>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s enough for today.&#8221; Abruptly Carchal snapped his fingers and vanished.<P>Kyrin sighed. &#8220;Idiot.&#8221;<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Seamus met up with Mayra in a deserted street.<P>&#8220;Seen anyone?&#8221;<P>&#8220;No.&#8221;<P>Seamus pulled Starlight from his scabbard. &#8220;Be careful, Mayra. They&#8217;ve got to be in here somewhere.&#8221;<P>Abruptly the sounds of running feet greeted them. Thelis flew out of a side alley and dropped to her knees. &#8220;Seamus!&#8221; she panted. &#8220;I....there&#8217;s.........he..&#8221;<P>&#8220;Hey, calm down.&#8221; Seamus offered his hand. Thelis clutched it with a grip that was white-knuckled. &#8220;I said......&#8221;<P>&#8220;God, I was scared. He stabbed me. I&#8217;m........barely alive.&#8221;<P>Seamus stared at the bloodstains which graced the right side of her leather armor and leggings. &#8220;I can see that. Hold on a moment.&#8221; He pulled his gauntlet off, and muttered a prayer for a second. Then he tapped Thelis&#8217;s wound.<P>&#8220;Hey, keep your hand......away from there.&#8221; Without warning, the wounds closed without even a scar. Thelis felt something coursing through her body. She shivered, then she felt as happy and carefree as a child. &#8220;Thank you, thank you!&#8221; She giggled.<P>Fool! Stop that, something&#8217;s going on in you. Stop it!<P>She still felt like dancing, but she didn&#8217;t. Instead, she got up and kissed Seamus on the left cheek. He blushed. &#8220;It&#8217;s nothing. Are you all right?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Yeah, I think so.&#8221; Thelis stared at her new sword. &#8220;Seamus, I&#8217;m not really very good with this, and it&#8217;s getting late. Who says we find Kyrin and you teach me how to use it better?&#8221;<P>Seamus nodded. <P>The Arena was quiet, and Kyrin was standing in front of it. &#8220;Guys, I&#8217;ve got to tell you something...&#8221; he stammered.<P>Mayra sighed. &#8220;All right Kyrin, which pointless fight did you start this time? And who kicked your a--?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Nobody, I kicked his. He looks a lot like the other psychos who were bugging us. He&#8217;s run off.&#8221;<P>Mayra looked shocked. &#8220;You actually beat someone? I&#8217;m dreaming, pinch me.&#8221;<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Laying inside an abandoned Inn, Mayra and Kyrin slept the sleep of the just. Seamus and Thelis, however, were busy.<P>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a good starting point. It&#8217;s an exercise my order has come up with for this sort of thing.&#8221; Seamus drew the blade, then spun and slashed at the ground. &#8220;A sword is not an item you use to kill. With the sword, one vanquishes the foe, but the foe is a mirror for your own faults.&#8221; He swung a crushing blow that would have turned one of the three candles he had lit into powder, had it connected. &#8220;The edge is truth, that which defeats the darkness.&#8221; He stabbed at another candle, knocking the flame out but not harming the candle itself. &#8220;The hilt is honor, that which defends you.&#8221;  He slashed his third and final blow, aimed not at the candle but at the air above it. Again it flickered and went out. &#8220;And the handle? The handle is compassion.&#8221;<P>Thelis watched, mesmerized in spite of herself. &#8220;Why compassion?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Because that is what sets you apart from the enemy, what makes you capable of winning. They have none, but you do. The handle is what allows you to fight. Without it....&#8221; Seamus shrugged. &#8220;You die.&#8221;<P>Thelis nodded. &#8220;All right. What&#8217;s the exercise?&#8221;<P>Seamus lit each candle again. &#8220;Defend from my blows without blowing out a single candle.&#8221;<P>Two tries later, Seamus nodded again. &#8220;Not bad. I think that&#8217;s enough for tonight. Good night, Thelis.&#8221;<P>Thelis remained awake. Soon the regular breathing let her know he slept as well.<P>Compassion is a weakness, Seamus. That is something you don&#8217;t seem to have learned. It is surprising, actually, that you have lived this far.<P>But he&#8217;s certainly better then you are, Thelis. And that counts for something towards his being correct, no?<P>Butt out Listhe. You have no idea of what the real world is like.<P>And you do?<P>Yes, I do!  You don&#8217;t understand. Let me explain. When you fight, when you cross arms with a man or woman, what do you feel that keeps you alive? Hate. Very simple.<P>You&#8217;re wrong. So wrong. I don&#8217;t even know where to start fixing our head.<P>Fixing? Don&#8217;t make me laugh, Listhe. Really, why are you this....this weak?<P>I chose the path that I know is right. It is not my fault that I was selected for....you.<P>If I could kill you, I would.<P>Then why don&#8217;t you? Finish it, Thelis, you know the way. You know exactly who and what I am. Do it. Show me I&#8217;m wrong. Have you the guts to do it? I&#8217;d be glad to recede eternally into death, watching you burn in Hell.<P>Thelis raised her arm. Her hand shook as she pointed the katana at her heart. She tried to pick up the resolve to thrust. But somehow, she couldn&#8217;t do it. Why?<P>I knew better. Thelis, you know you&#8217;re deluded. Let me help us. Please.<P>Never. You know nothing.<P>Thelis lay down and began to sleep before her inner enemy could say anything else.<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>&#8220;All right. We&#8217;ve checked the city over. Where could they have come from?&#8221; Seamus had been unable to sleep well, so he&#8217;d waken everyone.<P>Kyrin thought for a second. He had grown up in Qeynos and knew it very well. &#8220;The sewers,&#8221; he said finally. &#8220;It has to be the sewers.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Why do you say that?&#8221; Seamus asked.<P>&#8220;There are a lot of things down there. People vanish in them all the time. It&#8217;s pretty common.&#8221; Kyrin shrugged. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been down there before. It&#8217;s a weird place, trust me. There are all sorts of rumors.&#8221;<P>&#8220;What sort of rumors? I hope you&#8217;ve got some basis in these ideas.&#8221;<P>&#8220;What, you don&#8217;t trust me? You see human necromancers all the time around here, and you have an area people die in past a certain point. We have established that the Bloodsabres are at least enemies, correct?&#8221;<P>&#8220;I see where you&#8217;re going with this.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Necromancy is a crime in Qeynos without express permission. Yet you have them anyways. Where could they be? And we also have an area in which people vanish mysteriously. We have undead roaming the countryside, and worse. And fourth, we have a dead city. So where should we check?&#8221;<P>&#8220;The sewers.&#8221; everyone said at once. Seamus scowled.<P>&#8220;I told you so,&#8221; Kyrin said.<P>&#8220;Ok, ok, you were right. Don&#8217;t shove my face in it.&#8221; Seamus grimaced. &#8220;And we need to go in the sewers, huh. All right. Find us an entrance and let&#8217;s go.&#8221;<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Kyrin tapped the wall. &#8220;This doesn&#8217;t look right to me.&#8221; He tapped another patch covered with ivy.<P>His finger made the wall go in slightly. &#8220;A curtain. See? This must have once been a sally port or something. I guess they made the sewers with defense in mind when they built Qeynos.&#8221;<P>&#8220;I see.&#8221;<P>One by one, they entered the hidden chamber. Outside, it was as if the moon had gone out.<P>--------------------<P>'Good is subjective. Evil never changes.'<P>Yakov Shadeleaf, Ranger of the twentieth season.
