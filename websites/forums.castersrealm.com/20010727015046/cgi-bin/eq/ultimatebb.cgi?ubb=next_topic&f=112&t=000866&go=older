Ok, I decided to add my two platinum to this whole Race discussion followed with some additional information, I think most will agree with me here but I am also sure some wont, and that's ok because that's there opinion and I respect it.  I am taking the time to type this guide for our new Shadowknights and for those that always start a new topic stating I quote: "Umm. What Race should I play?"   In this guide I will be discussing the pluses and minuses of each Race to help with your choice, that's of course if it comes down to a choice.<P>Ok first, keep in mind there is no best Race, the best Race for a Shadowknight really comes down to the person behind the keyboard playing that Race, it's your skill that makes you the best. Granted, Ogre's and Troll's have a little advantage as well as Iksars over the smaller races with there additional abilities, but keep in mind you pay for those additional abilities with an Experience penalty. Regardless of those additional abilities it still comes down to once again, the person behind the keyboard, Period.  When looking for a group and you say in /ooc "40 SK LFG please", they are not going to reply to you and ask what Race your Playing, if they do, you don't want to be part of that group, trust me on this. <P>Also keep in mind a Shadowknight takes some skill to play and this is also a key factor when finding a group and what makes the best Race.  A well played Shadowknight knows the IN and OUTS of his abilities and then enhances that with his/hers playing abilities and this my friends is what makes the best Shadowknight, not what Race you play.  <P>We will now talk about the good and bad perks of each Race that is available to the Shadowknight Class.  <P>First, we have the Ogre.  The Ogre gets some nice additional skills but with these skills you have to pay an experience penalty and a couple of other penalties such as being too big and picking your ass.  <P>The Good:<BR>1) Slam, the ability to Bash without a shield and wielding a 2 hander<BR>2) Can not be stunned from the front<BR>3) Infravision, the ability to see at night<BR>4) Natural High Strength and Stamina<P>The Bad:<BR>1) To Big, Dugeons can be a hassle and it can be a bother for other players as well<BR>2) Experience Penalty for most of the above abilities (15% ?)<P>Second, we have the Troll.  The Troll also gets some nice additional skills similar to the Ogre.<P>The Good:<BR>1) Slam, the ability to Bash without a shield and wielding a 2 hander<BR>2) Regeneration, able to regenerate double the HP of all other Races with the exception of Iksars<BR>3) Infravision, the ability to see at night<BR>4) Natural High Strength and Stamina but not as high as the Ogre<P>The Bad:<BR>1) To Big but smaller then the Ogre, <BR>2) Experience Penalty for most of the above abilities (20% ?)<P>Third, we have the Iksars. The Iksar get some additional skills as well.<P>The Good:<BR>1) Regeneration, able to regenerate double the HP of all other Races with the exception of Trolls<BR>2) Natural AC due to their scales<BR>3) Forage, you have the ability to forage food<BR>4) At level 1 your Swimming skill is at 100<P>The Bad:<BR>1) Experience Penalty for most of the above abilities (20% ?)<BR>2) Hated by everywhere except their home city but with heavy faction work this could be fixed<BR>3) Can not wear Plate Armor but their Natural AC and racial armor makes up for it<P><BR>Fourth, we have the Humans. The Humans don't get any additional skills but they also do not pay an Experience penalty.<P>The Good:<BR>1) The Best Faction, Humans can enter most cities with little Faction work<BR>2) No Experience Penalty<P>The Bad:<BR>1) Can not see at night but this can be fixed at level 22 with the spell Deadeye<P>Fifth, we have the Erudites.  The Erudites like the Humans don't get to many additional skills but they also do not pay an Experience penalty.<P>The Good:<BR>1) The 2nd Best Faction, like Humans Erudites can enter most Cities with little Faction work<BR>2) Has the highest Intellect<BR>3) No Experience Penalty<P>The Bad:<BR>1) Can not see at night but this can be fixed a level 22 with the spell Deadeye<P>Sixth and Last, we have the Dark Elves.  The Dark Elves don't get to many additional skills but they also do not pay an Experience penalty.<P>The Good:<BR>1) Ultravision, the ability to see even better at night (better then Infravision)<BR>2) The Hide Skill at level 1<BR>3) 2nd to Highest Intellect<BR>4) No Experience Penalty<P>The Bad: <BR>None<P><BR>That's a wrap on the Race discussion and as far as stats, well, I will make it brief since this is getting to long of a thread.  <P>First, the main stats you should focus on are Strength, Stamina, Agility, Dexterity and Intellect.  <P>Second, you must understand that Stats mean next to nothing, it will take about 50-60 points in each stat to make any significant difference (Not including Intellect and Wisdom for mana) and as I stated before the difference is not something to cheer about.  Also in the end game all the stats will be balanced out with other Races with equipment and buffs so don't worry about how much strength you have etc…  However, there are some things you should consider before and when assigning your points to the designated stat, and that is:<P>1) Make sure none of the above stats mention are below 75, especially agility as you will suffer some penalties, its also argued if the other stats suffer any penalties below 75 but better safe then sorry I always say.<P>2) You might want to consider putting a few extra points in strength if not an Ogre or Troll to carry that heavy plate Armor.<P>3) If playing an Ogre or Troll you might want to put some of those extra points in Intellect.<P>4) Keep in mind also that when assigning points to your character that Stamina and Agility are the Hardest Stats to raise so maybe throw a few extra points in these stats as well.<P>5) Try to get your Stamina over 100 to avoid exhaustion and fatigue. <P>Why I am at it I might as well give you my advice on where to assign your starting points.<P>Ogre ~ 5 Agi 5 Dex 10 Int<BR>Troll ~ 20 Int or 15 Int 5 Dex <BR>Iksar ~10 Sta 10 Str<BR>Human ~10 Sta 10 Str<BR>Erudite ~ 10 Str 5 Agi 5 Dex<BR>Darkelf ~ 10 Str 10 Sta<P>Note: This is only my recommendation and many will argue saying that they don't agree and that is fine.  <P>If you are Twinked I highly recommend you put your points in Stamina and Agility because as I said before these Stats are the most difficult to raise and if not Twink if you can suffer for a few levels do the same thing.  Remember at level 9 you get the spell steal Strength and Strength equipment is VERY cheap compare to other stat equipment. <P>Well that's about it I guess, I could probably go on a little more but I have to get back to work hehe.  Again I know not everyone will agree with me here but I can assure you that most do.  All this information is based on Experience and Lurking the boards and absorbing information from others since I have been playing EQ (beta).  And in case you're wondering what I play and what level I am:<P>Before Retirement on Luclin: 52 Ogre SK - 48 Halfing Cleric - 41 Dwarf Warrior - 41 DE Enchanter - 40 Erudite Wizard -27 Gnome Rogue - 22 Erudite SK and 11 Half Elf Bard<P>Now on Vazaelle: 17 Ogre SK - 11 Halfing Druid<P>Well, I hope this helps the newer Shadowknights, Good Luck.<P>Cya<P>--------------------<P>Cirras<BR>Level 16 Reincarnated High Elf Enchanter<BR>Proud Member of Vengeful Dragons<BR>Vazaelle

My suggestion is do not put any points in dex no matter what race you are.  It is not hard to raise dex by five for procing later on, and if you're a smartie (erudite) you will be able to keep at least four weapons skilled maxed with a base 70 dex.  Raising your dex by 50 points increases your proc rate by a mere 10%.  That is, if you proc 10 times in x fights, you'd proc 11 times instead with 50 more dexterity.  Not worth it at all.  <P>   For ogres, I'd put 5 points in agil, 15 in intelligence.  For trolls I'd put all in intelligence.<BR>  For erudites, 5 in stam, 5 in agil, 10 in str.  I'd also put 5 points in intelligence if you are a human or iksar, taking away 5 from stamina, or from both strength and stamina.
