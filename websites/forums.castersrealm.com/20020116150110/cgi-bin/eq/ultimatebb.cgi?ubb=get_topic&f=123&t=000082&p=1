Lately, there have been some questions asked and comments made by a variety of posters here that suggest (at least to me) that it might be useful to discuss how melee damage works in Everquest.  And it might also be useful to throw up some spiffy graphs to help explain things, because not everybody is able to visualize graphs based on textual descriptions.<P>So here goes!<P><B>FIRST GRAPH</B><P>  <IMG SRC="http://www.erols.com/aburner/eq/1hbgraph.gif">  <P>This is the Damage Profile of my Journeyman's Walking Stick (9/24) as wielded mostly in my Primary hand.  I got this graph by logging all of my combats so far in 46th level, then going in with a text editor and removing everything but the "You crush" or "You try to crush" messages.  Since my offhand weapon is a Kunzar Ku'Juch (1HSlash), this left me with a logfile of nothing but my hits with the Journeyman's Walking Stick.<P>You will notice that there are a few hits for Damage values from 1 to 7.  These come from a few battles where I (for tactical reasons) switched hands and put the JWS in my offhand.  Since the offhand doesn't get the Level Damage Bonus, my minimum damage for the JWS in the offhand is 1.  There was no easy or consistent way to weed these battles out of the graph, so I just left them in.  So pretend that they're not there.    <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/biggrin.gif"><P>The first thing to note are the two prominent peaks on the graph.  The biggest peak falls at what we call the "Magic Number."  The Magic Number is a Damage value that, at 28th or higher (and possibly at 20th or higher) can be calculated with the formula:<P>[(2 * DMG) + (Level Damage Bonus)]<P>The Journeyman's Walking Stick has a DMG of 9.  According to this formula, my Magic Number will be [(2 * 9) + (7)] == (18 + 7) == 25.<P>And sure enough, the biggest peak falls on 25.<P>(It's called the "Magic Number" because it's the amount of damage you will hit for the most.  Around 20% of your total hits will be for the Magic Number.)<P>The second peak falls at the Minimum Damage (aka MIN).  From 28th level onward (and possibly 20th level onward), MIN can also be precisely calculated as follows:<P>1 + (Level Damage Bonus)<P>According to this, my MIN should be 1 + 7, or 8.  And sure enough, the second peak on my Damage Profile is at 8.<P>You will notice that the majority of hits fall between these two peaks in a roughly (VERY roughly) even distribution.  I say "even" because the lesser peaks between MIN and the Magic Number are almost always compensated by "valleys".  In other words, there is a small peak at 12.  But there's a "valley" at 9, which tends to even out the peak at 12.<P>Above the Magic Number, we have two types of hits.  The first type are normal hits up to Max Damage (MAX).<P>According to the most accurate formula we have currently, your MAX can be calculated thus:<P>[((Weapon Skill + Strength)/100) * (DMG)) + (Level Damage Bonus)]<P>According to this, with my 110 STR, my max damage for the primary hand wielding a JWS should be:<P>[((200 + 110)/100) * (9)] + 7 == (3.1 * 9) + 7 == 27.9 + 7 == 34.9<P>Fractions are dropped, so my MAX with the JWS in my primary hand is 34 points of damage.  You will notice that there is a small amount of hits at 35.  This is because for some of these fights I had the 10-point Necro STR buff, which put my MAX at 35.  But for the most part I was fighting at 110 STR, putting my MAX at 34.  And you'll notice that the hits for over Magic Number on this graph are fairly evenly distributed up to 34.<P>The second type of hits that fall above the Magic Number are exclusive to Warriors: Critical Hits and Crippling Blows.  (Rogues get crits with thrown weapons and Rangers get crits with bows, but only Warriors get crits with melee weapons.)  The crits and crips range up to a 73-point shot (66-point crippling blow + the level damage bonus).<P>One of the things that came up a couple weeks back when things got a little...heated...around here (  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/biggrin.gif">) was my opinion that crits are "eye candy."  For those of you who wonder why I would say that, hopefully this graph makes it a little bit more clear.  This graph represents literally thousands of successful hits.  There are about 470 hits at the Magic Number alone.  Compare that with the comparative handful of crits (ranging from 36-points of damage to 54-points of damage).  This is the reason why I say that crits don't play a significant role in your damage output at high levels.  (At low levels, it plays a more significant role.  A nice crit with an LotW can do over 70 points of damage.  That's a non-trivial percentage of health for a MOB with 500-600 HP.  Against a MOB with 5000 HP, it's less significant.)<P><BR><B>SECOND GRAPH</B><P>  <IMG SRC="http://www.erols.com/aburner/eq/offhandslash.gif">  <P>This is the Damage Profile for a Kunzar Ku'juch (8/22) in my offhand.  Like before, this was obtained by logging my battles so far through 46th level, then going through with a text editor and removing everything that doesn't start with "You slash" or "You try to slash".<P>Although it's not as obvious here as in the first graph, this graph also has a few battles logged where I had the Kunzar in my primary hand.  Like the first graph, the amount of hits where this occurred is a negligible fraction of the total hits, so the graph isn't affected in any meaningful way.  For the most part, the overwhelming majority of these hits were with the Kunzar in the offhand.<P>The key thing to keep in mind:  The offhand doesn't get the Level Damage Bonus.  So all formulas for the primary hand that contain the Level Damage Bonus *don't* contain it for the offhand.<P>So the Magic Number for the offhand is simply (2 * DMG) == (2 * 8) == 16.  The MIN is simply 1.  The MAX is [((Weapon Skill + STR)/100) * DMG] == [((200 + 110)/100) * 8] == 24.8, rounded down to 24.<P>And sure enough, we have the biggest peak at 16, a secondary peak at 1, and non-critical hits ranging up to 24.  (Again, as before, there are a small number of hits for 25, which comes from the fights where my STR was 120 instead of 110 thanks to the 10-point Necro STR buff.)  Additionally, we have a smattering of offhand crits and crips ranging from 26-points to 49-points.<P>------------------<BR><B>Ruatha Kneeslasher <Wings of Honor></B><BR>46th Level Gnome Warriorette<BR><I><B>Some day we'll look back on all of this, laugh nervously, and change the subject...</B></I><p>[This message has been edited by Ruatha (edited 09-08-2000).]

I originally tried to post an even longer message, but the message board did NOT like it.  So I've broken it up into two parts.  Here's the 2nd part:<P><B>THIRD GRAPH</B><P>   <IMG SRC="http://users.erols.com/aburner/eq/bashgraph1.gif">   <P>This is a damage profile for my Bash skill.  I always dual-wield, and I always ghetto-bash.  So I was able to edit my log with a text editor and remove everything but the bashes.<P>There is a big peak at 12 and a smaller peak at 1.  Since Bash is done with the offhand, it doesn't get the Level Damage Bonus.  So the Magic Number should be (2 * DMG).  Since (2 * DMG) appears to equal 12 in this case, I surmise that Bash is a DMG 6 "weapon."  Plugging this DMG value in to the MAX formula seems to confirm this, because if Bash is a DMG 6 "weapon," my MAX Bash damage at 110 STR should be 18, which fits the graph.  The hits for 20, 22, and 30 are critical hits.<P><B>Some things to note</B>:<BR><UL TYPE=SQUARE><BR><LI>All Damage Profiles from 28-50 (and possibly 20-50) with 1-handed weapons will look very similar to these graphs.  There will be a big peak at the Magic Number.  There will be another big peak (although not as big as the Magic Number peak) at MIN.  The majority of hits will fall between these two peaks, with a lesser number falling between Magic Number and MAX.  For Warriors, there will also be a smattering of crits/crips above MAX.<P>In fact, you'll notice that these three graphs all look sorta the same.  For weapons with higher damage, the graph is more spread out.  For weapons with lower damage, the graph is more "scrunched up."  The Bash graph is similar to the first graph, but since the first graph is a DMG 9 weapon and Bash is a DMG 6 "weapon," there is a smaller possible range of damage values.<P>(As a sidenote, if I had a Mosscovered Twig in my primary, the MIN would be 8, the Magic Number would be 13, and the MAX would be 16.)<P><LI>One of the other things I've claimed before is that a warrior with high STR doesn't put out significantly more average damage than a warrior with low STR.  At the risk of starting another flamewar, here's why I say that:<P>According to the Max Damage formula, a 46th level warrior with 255 STR would have a MAX of 47 points of damage with the JWS in the primary hand vs. my 34-point MAX.  That's not bad.  If you look at the first graph, that means that his hits above the Magic Number would range from 25 to 47, whereas mine only ranges from 25 to 34.<P>BUT!<P>His distribution of hits from Magic Number to MAX will look roughly like mine.  So in other words, his graph for damage values 26-34 will look roughly like mine.  The only difference will be that his graph will extend past 34, and will go up to 47.  So that extra 145 points of STR is really only getting him some extra hits ranging from 35-47 over and above what I'm putting out.  His damage profile from MIN to 34 will look almost identical to mine.  So take what the graph would look like from 35 to 47 at 255 STR and compare it to the entire rest of the graph.  And keep in mind:  This is comparing a 110 STR to the maximum STR attainable in the game.  If you compare my 110 STR to a 150 STR or a 170 STR, the difference is even smaller.<P>That's why I say having a high STR doesn't make you a significantly better warrior over a warrior with low STR.<P>Again, I'm not looking to start a flamewar here.  You may look at the data and draw an entirely different conclusion.  I'm just explaining why I have certain beliefs and why I said certain things about STR in some of the earlier messages.  So even if you don't agree with me about STR, you at least know why I say it.      <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/biggrin.gif"><BR></UL><P><BR><B>A FEW OTHER GRAPHS</B><P>    <IMG SRC="http://www.erols.com/aburner/eq/152hslash.gif">    <P>    <IMG SRC="http://www.erols.com/aburner/eq/151hslash.gif">    <P>    <IMG SRC="http://www.erols.com/aburner/eq/151hbash.gif">    <P>One of the things I've said a number of times is that certain things hold true from 28th level and higher (and maybe 20th and higher).  The reason why I say that is at low levels, your Damage Profile looks very different than at higher levels.<P>The above 3 graphs are all from a 15th level Shadow Knight.  The first graph is the Damage Profile for a Fine Steel 2-handed Sword (12/44).  The second graph is the Damage Profile for a Silvery War Axe (6/22).  The third graph is for Bash (which in this case looks to be a DMG 4 "weapon").<P>Note that all three graphs are different from the high-level graphs I posted earlier.  There is the primary peak at the Magic Number (which is [(2 * DMG) + Level Damage Bonus], but since the character is below 28th level, the Level Damage Bonus is 0).  However, there is no peak at the MIN.  The secondary peak is at [(2 * DMG) + 1].  The remainder of the hits are more-or-less evenly distributed across all the values below (2 * DMG).<P>So when I say that "such-and-such is true at 28th level and higher (and maybe 20th level and higher)," this is why.  There comes a point in time at which the Damage Profile of a character changes from having a peak at the Magic Number and a smaller peak at (Magic Number + 1) to having a peak at Magic Number and a smaller peak at MIN.  <P>So far, no one has done any testing specifically to determine at what level this change takes place.  It seems fairly certain that at 28th level, the profile has the big peak at Magic Number and the smaller peak at MIN, since this is the first level where the Level Damage Bonus comes in to play.<P>However, 20th level is the level at which the 29-point Damage Cap is removed, so there's a suspicion that the profile may change at that point instead.<P>I'll know soon enough, I suppose, when my SK hits 20th...<P>Anyhow, I hope that SOMEONE finds all this info useful and/or helpful.      <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/biggrin.gif"><P>------------------<BR><B>Ruatha Kneeslasher <Wings of Honor></B><BR>46th Level Gnome Warriorette<BR><I><B>Some day we'll look back on all of this, laugh nervously, and change the subject...</B></I><BR><p>[This message has been edited by Ruatha (edited 09-08-2000).]

<I>Well Ru, that answered a lot of questions I had. (some that I didn't even know I had)</I><P>Woo!  Glad you found it useful!<P>I actually even managed to answer a question <I>I</I> had.<P>It's been known for a long time that high STR warriors can kinda-sorta-but-not-really break the 29-point damage cap before they hit 20th.  Meaning that if they're using (for example) an Exe Axe, they'll hit for more than 29 points of damage before 20th level, but they won't actually start hitting for damage in the 40s and 50s until 20th, when the cap is removed.<P>The way the damage cap works (and why it's a 29-point cap) is because between 10th and 20th level, the DMG on your weapon is capped at 14.  The Exe Axe (for example) is a 25/50 weapon -- unless you're 10th-19th level, in which case it's a 14/50 weapon.  The LotW is a 19/44 weapon -- unless you're 10th-19th level, in which case it's a 14/44 weapon.<P>Note, however, that it's just easier to say "There's a 29-point cap on damage until you hit 20th."  And this is true because at low levels, your peaks will be at (Magic Number) and (Magic Number + 1).  For a DMG 14 weapon, that's 28 and 29 points, respectively.<P>So why do high STR warriors start seeing hits for more than 29 points before they actually break the damage cap?<P>Well, consider the Max Damage formula:<P>MAX = [(((Weapon Skill + STR)/100) * DMG) + Level Damage Bonus]<P>Below 28th level, Level Damage Bonus is 0.  So MAX is just [((Weapon Skill + STR)/100) * DMG].<P>If you're 10th-19th level and using a weapon that has a DMG of 14 or higher, then it's just a DMG 14 weapon.  So MAX = [((Weapon Skill + STR)/100) * 14].<P>So think of it this way:  What would (Weapon Skill + STR) have to equal in that formula to get a value of 30?<P>(I'll spare you the boring algebra.  The answer is 215.)<P>So.<P>If the natural (non-capped) DMG of the weapon is 14 or higher, and if your Weapon Skill + STR = 215, you'll see hits for 30 points of damage before 20th level due to the STR bonus.<P>Let's say you're an Ogre who didn't put any points into STR at character creation.  Your STR is 140.  215 - 140 is 75.  You hit a Weapon Skill of 75 at 14th level.<P>So according to this theory, an Ogre warrior with 140 STR should start seeing hits for 30 points of damage at 14th level if he's using a powerful enough weapon.<P>Now, I've never played an Ogre Warrior up to 14th level.  So I don't really know if this is correct or not.  It's a theory that I've cobbled together based on everything I know.  It makes sense in that light, but I don't ever recall hearing any stories about Ogres hitting for over 29 points of damage before around 16th or 17th level.  And I've been reading warrior boards a LONG time.  (Then again, maybe they just weren't using powerful enough weapons.)<P>So if you play an Ogre Warrior and you're below 14th level and you have a weapon that has a DMG of 14 or higher, let us know when you start seeing hits for 30.<P><BR><I>And Khardan, I can assure you that I have much much more time on my hands than Ruatha does. Is it wrong that she uses hers more productively?</I><P>C'mon, Orakio.  He was just teasing.   <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"><P><P>------------------<BR><B>Ruatha Kneeslasher &lt;Wings of Honor&gt;</B><BR>46th Level Gnome Warriorette<BR><I><B>Some day we'll look back on all of this, laugh nervously, and change the subject...</B></I>

I actually haven't been playing my Ogre much lately. He was using a 16 dmg weapon all his life. He started hitting for 21 right from lvl 1. He hit's fairly often for 31 and 32 at 16, but I can't remember when I got my first 30+. If I remember correctly, I went to the Oasis starting at lvl 9 or 10. I broke 30 for the first time at one of those levels cause it was right before I went to the oasis. I remember cause I was fighting orcs in Sro at the time and my str was buffed to 199. Probably would've been lvl 10 because that's when I started hitting for 24-29 fairly regularly.<P>   --Orakio

<I>I actually haven't been playing my Ogre much lately. He was using a 16 dmg weapon all his life. He started hitting for 21 right from lvl 1. He hit's fairly often for 31 and 32 at 16, but I can't remember when I got my first 30+. If I remember correctly, I went to the Oasis starting at lvl 9 or 10. I broke 30 for the first time at one of those levels cause it was right before I went to the oasis. I remember cause I was fighting orcs in Sro at the time and my str was buffed to 199. Probably would've been lvl 10 because that's when I started hitting for 24-29 fairly regularly.</I><P>Sounds about right, then, because before level 10 the damage cap is 21 points (or, to put it another way, your DMG is capped at 10, so an Exe Axe is a 10/50 weapon, not a 25/50 weapon).  If your STR is high enough, you'd see the STR bonus applied here, too.<P><P>------------------<BR><B>Ruatha Kneeslasher &lt;Wings of Honor&gt;</B><BR>46th Level Gnome Warriorette<BR><I><B>Some day we'll look back on all of this, laugh nervously, and change the subject...</B></I>

Ruath,<BR>     Even though I am Ranger I thought I would comment on the topic of hitting for 29+ damage before level 20.  Right now I am lvl 19 and have a str between 115 and 120.  I am using a Silver Swiftblade as my 2hs weapon of choice.  I routinley (sp?) hit for 30 and often for 31.  I don't remember the exact lvl that I started hitting for 30 but I will venture a guess that it was around lvl 14 or 15.  I was just wondering if there was an explination that you knew of that would help explain this.  According to your formula I shoud not be seeing hits for 30 until lvl 18 with a 120 STR and lvl 19 with a 115 STR.  Some might tell me to take this to the Ranger boards, but to tell the truth I have yet to see a Ranger board with a poster of your quality.  <P>Chax<BR>Ranger of 19 lvls.<BR>Xegony

Very nice charts. Given that information, it would appear that strength plays a relatively minor role in damage dealt.<P>To see how minor, I need a list of level bonuses. Where can I find them? Failing that, what is the level damage bonus for a level 52 warrior?<P>I ask because I currently play a level 52 ogre warrior wielding a rod of mourning (29 damage) and have a strength of 255. While it feels good, I'd rather convert some of my gear to dexterity gear if the extra 55 points aren't useful.

<I>To see how minor, I need a list of level bonuses. Where can I find them? Failing that, what is the level damage bonus for a level 52 warrior?</I><P>No charts.  Just some formulas.<P>For 1-handed weapons (1HB, 1HS, Piercing), the formula is:<P>Level Damage Bonus = (Level - 25)/3<P>So the Level Damage Bonus doesn't kick in until 28th level (since (28 - 25)/3 = 1).  At 28th, 29th, and 30th levels, the Level Damage Bonus is 1.  From 31st-33rd level, the bonus is 2.  This goes all the way up to 60th level, where the bonus is 11.  So at 60th level, you'll hit for a minimum of 12 points every time you hit with a 1-hander.<P>For 2-handers, there are two different formulas.<P>Below 51st level, the formula for 2-handers is:<P>Level Damage Bonus = (Level - 25)/2<P>So at 27th level, you get a 1-point bonus to your hits with a 2-hander.  At 49th and 50th level, you're getting a 12-point bonus for each hit.<P>At 51st level and above, the formula changes.  The formula for the bonus for 2-handers at 51 and higher is:<P>Level Damage Bonus = (Level - 7)/3<P>So when you hit 51st level, your bonus jumps from 12 to 14.  From 52nd to 54th, it's 15.  From 55th to 57th, it's 16.  And from 58th to 60th it's 17.<P>It used to not be this way.  It used to be that all weapons got the (Level - 25)/3 bonus, even the two-handers.  Which made fast 1-handers unquestionably superior in all respects to any 2-handed weapon in the game at high levels.  It was only after lots of posts to the official Everquest message boards that we finally managed to get it through Verant's head that their combat engine was a little h0rked.  After that, they changed the bonus for 2-handers and they started making 2-handed weapons with DMG/DLY ratios that kept them competitive with 1-handers.<BR><P>------------------<BR><B>Ruatha Kneeslasher &lt;Wings of Honor&gt;</B><BR>46th Level Gnome Warriorette<BR><I><B>Some day we'll look back on all of this, laugh nervously, and change the subject...</B></I>

Wow! Nice info Ruatha! Thank you.<P>the question is,have you done this sort of analysis of our defensive statistics? In a way that is far more important that our damage output. What is the real difference between 800 and 900 ac? Do our dodge, parry, and reposte skills really add much to our defense? Those are the burning questions on my mind.<P>You Rock!<P>Baarak Orchammer<BR>Wolf of the North <p>[This message has been edited by Baarak Orchammer (edited 09-12-2000).]

this has been a debate in the shaman community for years. <P>I "feel" (no statistical proof) that with the large damage 2 handed weapons str does make a difference. I may be wrong but it seems that my damage is a whole lot higher when I am str buffed to 210 by my shaman buddies and start wacking with my mithril staff. I need to do a controlled log parse to really check this out. It may be moot since our damage output is really to keep stuff on us and that seems to work better if we are dual wielding.<P>Str buffs make us feel better  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"> And a happy tank is a good tank!<P><BR><P>------------------<BR>Baarak Orchammer<BR>Wolf of the North<BR>Innoruuk Server

Ruatha,<P>I've found your data (and the experiences of other warriors) extremely useful.  From the taunting aspect anyway.  I've long wondered why a lame ass Wizard can Ice Comet the hell outta a mob and a good warrior can keep him nice and clean, yet I spank out 1 decent dot, and he flies to me like a bear to a honey tree.  Soooo, It seems that low delay/low damage weapons are somewhat "dot'ish" while a high damage/high delay weapon seems to be "DD'ish".  <P>A secondary consideration is that alot of my DOT's have secondary functions... snare (super taunt), ac/str debuff(normally just a minor annoyance), so that's added in as well.<P>Not having an intelligent little gnome warrior in the area to discuss this with, I'm forced to attempt to glean this information from the Trolls and Ogres that live in my neighborhood, and, in general, when the light finally shines in thier eyes, they seem to agree.<P>Darnalak<BR>53rd Necromancer<BR>Veeshan<P>(Polle's boss)

For another topic to discuss, what (if any) stats affect how effective your taunt is? I am level 15 in Highpass and the Orcs seem to taunt onto me, even though I'm doing very little damage with each swing and missing a lot. This may be because of my low HPs compared to the rest of the group, but I wondered if possibly the fact I put some points into charisma when creating my character lets me yell nastier things at the orcs to get them onto me better.

Well, from my experience around the 15th level, I notice missing a lot too. Your taunt skill has a lot to do with it. There was a Druid in oasis (had a last name but was anon...I'm guessing at least mid-30's) who was pl'ing a bard. He went after the same mob I did, he hit it a couple times, but I pulled the aggro off of him with just a taunt. The funny thing is, I taunted at the same time I swung, I missed, the Druid hit, the croc aggro'd on and bit the Druid a couple times, so I backed off. Then the croc suddenly turned around on me, so the Druid backed off and let me have it. From that one experience, I'd have to say that taunt skill plays quite a large role in it. I've actually heard that having lower charisma helps you taunt better. Don't know if that's true, just thought I'd throw it in there in reference to you saying something about putting points in it.<P>   --Orakio

Wow. That's really all I can say until I let this sit in to my head. I've been playing as a warrior and wanted to know the DIRECT formulas and links to other sites containing info on my weapons. I've used probably every weapon combination a lvl 51 warrior can acquire. and I've held by my weapons forever. Such as my Mithril Staff w/ fbss over Mithril 2h with tbb. IF POSSIBLE could you post that if you have time? =) I use wurmslayer and Green Jade Broadsword. I'd love a Jade Mace to use in place of the Wurmslayer when i dont have haste in my group (ench, bard, shammie), but I'm very poor =). Maybe I'll get that Dagas I need this weekend at Sky... who knows, thanks for the Info, i'll post again with log files if you guys want of my Wurmslayer and Green Jade Broadsword DMG, but I will have to work out myself which are which attacks(it's usually very easy to tell, Wurmslayer has a higher minimum dmg than Green Jade's max I believe, or very similar, therefore the 40dmg hits will be confused sometimes.) Perhaps we could coerce the EQ team to let you change a chat filter 'You try to slash a Cleric of Innoruuk with your Wurmslayer, but MISS! You slash a Cleric of Innoruuk with your Green Jade Broadsword for 33 Points of Damage!' of course that would be mega spam with long weapon names =). Laters, I'll try to post that info if I remember to log it all this weekend. Now that I think about it, my cane of the tranquil has same dmg/delay as GJB, =) Much easier. <P>P.S. I'm with you on the str issue, but I never turn down strength. I live by my HP and AC.

Hi,<P>I read this thread shortly after I started playing EQ but couldnt remember anything about level damage bonuses, but decided to check back at the thread and guess what.  Ruatha had answered the question about the Level Damage bonus as well.  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"><P>It is my conclusion that this post is the most useful one Ive still found, and Ive searched a LOT, about melee in EQ.<P>Question:<BR>Why am I answering a post that is this old?<P>Answer:<BR>To get it back to top again, since we are seeing all those questions being asked again.

I dont use my bow much, even if I miss it pulls fine, but once, when dueling, I got a crit with it against a bard. It was most certainly was a bow crit because he had selos and I was chasing him trying to hit him with it (failing badly though), has anyone else had this happen?

Warriors can critical with any weapon.<P>Some other melee classes can critical with their specialist weapon -- I believe it's thrown for rogues and bows for rangers. Both of these attacks are of course the meat and drink of EverQuest combat.

Sounds right to me.  One tidbit though.  Sometimes when a rouge gets really lucky and gets a critical blow with a thrown weapon that would kill the mob it changes the text to say 'Deadly Strike'.  Or that is as close as me and my friend the rogue can figure out. Nice flavor thing that was put in.<P>Dynali<BR>19 Warrior

Here's the deal with Agility and Dex (no spiffy graphs   <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/frown.gif"> ).  Agility is your EVASIVENESS with a given armor.  It's a lot like strength in that only the "10" boundaries are the breaking points for noticeable changes.  You most definitely do NOT want a melee class with an Agility below 75.  The Agility stat is really how it is feasable that Halflings can be just as competent at "tanking" as Ogres/Trolls/Barbarians who all have a MUCH higher Stamina.  The reason being the Large races have higher Stamina (higher hp), but the Halfling (or gnome/Wood Elf/High Elf/Dark Elf) compensates their LACK of Hit points by EVADING more attacks.  That means that you will see the skills dodge/parry/riposte go off more often, and that way you actually avoid taking damage in the first place.  <P>Dex on the otherhand, you will only see making a real difference as you begin to consistently use proccing weapons.  Dex affects proc rate, and therefor, the extra damage or special ability of the weapon itself becomes part of your total damage out put.  Make sense?<P><p>[This message has been edited by Smeagol (edited December 19, 2000).]

Has anyone had a few regular hits for 100dam with a mith staff at 27th level?  This is with a 241 strength (ie 49th shaman str buff).  I pretty consistantly hit in the 70's-90's with that staff and this is against various giants at the giant fort in FM.  I can't wait to see what I hit for at 30... muhahahahahhahaah!!<P>Ogre Warriors rule!!

Strength also increases your ATK rating, which is more difficult to measure in the broad sense.   <P>Though 50 STR may only increase your average hit by one or two points of damage. If the additional ATK rating adds one or two more hits per combat, then the result is significant.
