Everquest is a world. You make your own story and you play your own life, becoming more powerful, more well known, fightingfor good or ighting for evil. You make friends, you hunt with friends and you kill stuff with friends. The game isn't just a place to camp and a place to chat.

</FONT><HR>Now this is where the folks at Origin have one up with UO over EQ.  <P>The major factor is this, in EQ in order to do trade skills or to even become a master at them you need to lvl. Example: Shamans need to be 25 to even begin tinkering with Alchemy? In UO I could begin working on Alchemy the first minute I entered the world there as with any other trade skill. This is something Verant is far from ever making a reality for those who prefer to play as merchants as to those who prefer to PK, Hunt, or questing rather then mindlessly leveling. <P>Sorry to spoil the atmosphere here with those who say you can become a trade skills or perhaps a quester, or the mindless power leveling junkies here, but it's the truth. Once more we go back to point one. You, MUST level in order to do these things, to be objective as possible and to obtain a higher skill. (+5 points per new level)<P>I've come across some lvl 55+ clerics on my server that are about the worst excuse for a healer that I've ever seen. Why? Because their levels were handed to them via power leveling. I've been playing as a cleric since the release of EQ and my best tip to anyone out there is this, it's not the levels that make you good, it's how you play and manage with what resources you currently have and learn to master them *via spells, and equiptment*, don't become a mindless leveling junkie, in the end all you will do is burn yourself out. Levels mean nothing if you can't play your role properly. It's been proven time and time again via contests, people 5 to 10 levels lower beating out their elders. I myself am level 51, I have been 51 since the release of Kunark that very day, however I do not have this "uber" gear. So don't be lead to believing to be the best you need the best, what makes someone good is once more, managing with what they have. I hate camping, never did it, never will. I may not be the "cool looking" cleric of my server but I can say this, in DE form I personally think I look sweet with a BS tunic, Gator Legs. Give the appearance of Superman. Oh yeah and make sure you wear plate gloves and toss on a Sull Shaped Barbute for extra kicks, you'll look really spiffy then.  ;-) I can't seem to stress this point enough to newbies, it's not about leveling or the gear, it's about HAVING FUN! Oh and yeah, looking like the RAK! Errr Super RAK!  ;-)<P>To answer others questions, I have two lvl 50+ characters, I've had them well before Kunarks release, but what was there to do at 50?  I've now changed to a style, I have 8 characters I play, now sure they do not lvl fast and at this point I'll never hit 60, the road there is just to dull and boring at that point. But try making alts, a wide variety of character selections to play I've found has been by far more enjoyable. Oh and one final note, I am a casual player now. So what if you're friends pass you by and miss out on all the fun things simply because they chose to level faster, trust me, I've been there, you get burned out and begin to hate EQ. Course I am not praising the game, theres alot that needs fixed, perhaps in EQ2, but till then....<P>Hope this tid bit of info helps, well at least till a new MMORPG comes along. Such as....Origin Worlds *aka UO2*   =)<P>If you SMEEEELLLLALALA, what the RAK, IS, COOKIN'!<P><BR>Balrak aka The RAK!<BR>Mith Marrs elite, best of tbe best cleric!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000026&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Its called Roleplaying. Make up your own dialogue. Your own characters background. Be creative and have fun. The game would be a lot more fun if people would actually roleplay. That's why its called an RPG. Making your own characters background personalities, idiosycracies, and foibles was always the most fun thing to do in book RPG's like Dungeons and Dragons. Just try roleplaying sometime with someone else who does it and see how you like it. That's what I did and now I almost always roleplay.  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000027&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Heres the real Heart of the issue.<BR>EQ is designed as a MUD<BR>so its based off of Leveling and  Items Aquisition.<BR>THoes are the driving forces....<BR>Now you have to ask yourself If thats all we got how do we keep the player base paying their money..<BR>Ok yes we will try to put into effect differnt "Other Things" But they were not the main driving force...<P>Now so we are really just stuck with Leveling and Items.<P>On Leveling: To keep the players playing you must make it Fast and fun at first and Gradually Slow it down this way their hooked and by the time they relise it they are going slower and slower, Just like if you put 100pounds in your hands you would feel the strain. But if you gradually add it you have more resistanmce to the feel of the wiight it would seem.<P>Anyways with that in mind use this formula<BR>Money = Maximum amount of time before players relise there is nothing to do.<P>Now on items: I was very dissapointed that not everything was renendered when i was a n00b i saved and saved for that cloth cloak! when i put it on Whoot! wait.... it does not show i dont look cool.<P>People want to look cool,  but getting thoes items with good stats or looks requires TIME PLAYED<BR>money = Time played before person just quits.<P>the longer you keep a person playing the more money you get from month to month.<P>Its not their fault at all its the basic MUD design not verant or anything.. verant is a company trying to exist and make a profit. They do try they really do.... Its just bad that the root and heart of the game *MUD STYLE with a GUI on it* is not designed for Dynamic and Virtual communitys and activitys. It has a Object and points of things to do. It can not house a Dynamic enviramental community. Its not their fault but its just another mud.. And one i am hooked on<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000028&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

Those of you who can't enjoy things, if i may be so bold to say, do not  belong in EQ. Mindless no fun chatting isn't what i pay 10 bucks a month for. do you?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000031&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I have only been playing for ~7weeks, and I think I see both sides of the coin here.  Camping CAN be boring, depending on whom you di it with.  And yes, the quests are a bit sparse, or pointless in some cases.  At least, the ones I have found to do aren't all that exciting.  I would personally like a little more direction in the game, new quests or GM events or whatever.  I have yet to see an event that interests me and meets my level.  I started playing EQ to play with some friends, but unless things start to change, I am sad to say I may go back to UO.  The graphics immersion may not be as total, but the role playing there has been a better experience.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000034&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I think EQ was finally going the right way with the first expantion. I however think the addition of 10 unreal hell levels was wrong. But the new race was great. There are alot of new quests and great areas to explore. I think they should have put the time into makes lizards being able to wear the plate armor would have been better then the work put into the last 10 boring levels. <P>I love playing an Iskar there fun to play and the city is great. Each class has cool quests to do and they are fun. It is the most fun I have had playing since it came out. I wish they would get there lag fixed and there routers problems fixed. <P>I hope the new barb city and expantion is half as good but no more levels and unreal level restrictions to go places. Also fix the faction issue's. But keep making great trade skills and stuff like that. I spend most of my time hunting just to get money to play with trades. It's fun and great. <P>Just my thoughts!!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000035&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Pushing the bubs is the name of the game for the most part.  Trying to get that next spell level or that next skill or that piece of phat l3wt is all you have to look forward too.  I like EQ alot but I wish there was more in depth charater development similiar to AC or D2.  Instead a ranger is a ranger etc. etc. and the only difference between them is the equipment they are wearing (which in itself is relatively limited).  Which is another point about EQ I don't like.  EQ is less about character development and player skill and more about what you are wearing.  I like EQ class structure which promotes grouping (unlike AC where it isn't neccessary to group so much and every character breaks down to a couple different character types)  I hope future MMORPG take the best of what has been developed and create a better game where there are classes, but two characters of the same class will be different depending on how the player developed the character and equipment will be icing on the cake rather than the meat of the character.  I think a structure like that will keep the game more interesting because every step (level) of the way you will be incrementally improving and molding your character into your own creation rather than the game developers idea of what the charater should be.  <P>My advice for new players is to try several classes/races to ensure you have the right one for you.  EQ has a steep learning curve and it will take awhile to learn all the basics of the game.  I would try to do this while playing a lower level character rather than get to say the 30's and learn more about the game and find out that this class isn't really for me.<P>As quests go they are pretty static and pretty boring for the most part.  It would be nice to be able to walk into the tavern in a town and be approached in some way by an NPC and given some quest that requires a group to complete and triggers some type of adventure AND recieve good amount of XP and some item reward for doing it.  I think VI walks a narrow path in this domain.  They put in quests that take alot of time with a reward that often isn't that great and you get little or no XP for doing it.  The reason they don't give more weight to these quests is that people would quickly exploit them.  If they want to put the Quest in Everquest then they need to put in more meatier quests with decent reward for the group completing it.  Make it more rewarding to get XP from questing than from camping.  They need to add quests that are only given for a short time and can only be completed by a character once and then the next patch there are another whole new set of quests throughout the world for players to try to find and complete.  The epic quests are the only thing that have come close to anything like this and that is only available to 50+ players.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000039&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

If what you make if it is sitting around camping a single spawn for a whole night just to go up 1 or 2 levels, then that's your decision.

</FONT><HR>The biggest problem that I see with this game from the game setting point of view is that you don't feel like the heroic character acomplishing great things.  In fact it feels more like assembly line processing.  "Okay - we've finished camping the Aqua-Lord-Basilisk-Cockatrice it's all your's now."  It would feel so much better if you could pretend like you were a band of important adventurers waiting to rid the world of some great evil (assuming you're a good race).  Then Crushbone would be epic, Runnyeye would be epic - everything would be epic as you progressed because it would all be new and challenging and waiting for you tackle it.  But with the over population of every zone it never feels that way.  Go to Crushbone at 10th level and pick off a centurian or two but dodge for the zone when a mid-teens group screws up in the Throne Room.  That makes you feel like an extra in someone else's quest.  Twenty other characters wizzing about ooc-ing and auctioning.  It feels like an elementary school playground - run over to the kickball game - full (camped) -- run over to the handball court (camped) - play a game of tetherball (if you win, play again and again and again - now you're the camper).  But never ever does it feel like you're uncovering some mysterious area with death hovering over your shoulder.  I truly envy those of you who were playing when this was new.  Can you imagine how much fun it would have been breaching each new area......"I wounder what is that strange eery looking house (Unrest) - let's take a look -- oh my God run! run! run!!!   We need more help here, perhaps the Clerics can tell us how to handle all those undead....."  Nope, now it's like apartment living - try to get whatever enjoyment you can get without pissing the neighbors off too much.      </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000041&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Well aside from player made events and guild interaction this game is ALL about leveling.<P>Now i do have fun when i get creative and hang around my guild, but the NORMAL part of the game aready bores me to death.<BR>lets face it, there is only so much hanging around, trade skills, lotto, naked newbie racin', wood elf pimping stuff you can do b4 you get the urge to make another level.<P>after level 30 leveling gets boring. oh sure you get a few neat looking dungeons to see, but its still the same. at 35 you should have mastered group tactics and at 40 most classes have thier full tactics availible.<P>At about this same time you figure out the game is just sooo boring! <BR>It rewards you for NOT exploring. It rewards you for not questing. Those who explore or quest are left with death or unimaginative camps for dumb quest items.  Newbie quests were more fun!<P>Anyway yes i'm about done, just had to rant<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000042&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>First, I am Kabume on Bristlebane and don't have my password with me... sorry.<P>As to the topic of the day - <P>I've read all the posts above mine and both those that are tired of the game (camping, questing, etc.) and those that are enjoying the game (new places to see, friends, etc.) make very valid arguments.  *nods*<P>I would add the following thoughts:<P>1) This game and every other game can be improved.<BR>2) Improvements keep being made by Verant.<BR>3) Nothing of any real life value other than recreation comes out of playing this game.  I guess I'm excluding those that sell game items on E-Bay or the possibility of making real life friends somehow from meeting them online.<BR>4) Most of us are addicted to Everquest.  Once you spend countless days building a character and developing your knowledge of the world of Norrath you hate to give it up as useless.<BR>5)  There are changes we would like to make that are not possible without a total rewrite of the game code.  At this point the code must be very complex after all the myriad patches.<BR>6)  The game designers have a lot of ego tied into the world they have created and won't let their world change much as a result.<BR>7)  Real change would only happen if there was a significant economic impact to Verant.  A really strong competitor for example and a drop off of subscribers would reduce the arrogance very quickly.  And I don't demean Verant as all good companies develop arrogance to some degree from their success.<BR>8) We would all make different changes were we given the license to do so.  Even if major changes take place they may not be ones you would want to see happen.<BR>9)  Virtual life, just like real life, is what you make of it.  Why is it that some are thrilled to play each night while others are bored or unhappy?  Look at your real life neighbors and you will find the same thing.  Ever try to manage a group of employees and have them all happy all the time?  If so you understand the humor of Dilbert all too well.<BR>10)  And lastly, it is just a game.  This point we understand intellectually but not emotionally.  It is just a game.  Enjoy the game and enjoy life.  Peace and prosperity to my fellow gamer friends.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000044&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>HI,first of all, this is Naelae Widowmaker, lvl 32 sk. Ive managed to read the first page of posts, and most are exactly what I expected, No story line, Quest are minimal, lvling is the only thing to do. Besided the other side of the game, and that is the economy. I propose what I believe to be one of the best ideas you will ever hear as a verant programmer. Which you may have already heard,but the game is far to much about the economy. Classes like myself, hybrids, who are pure nothing, basically get the scraps from the pure classes and are forced to work with that, but the real point falls with say, Porting, binding, healing, ect. The reason that over time you will lose many of your customers will be a combination of no real quest (as per the title everquest),and only lvling as an option for fun, and secondly, the vast and amazing world that you have created is simply not being explored as much as most of us would like. Point 1. Who wants to sit around for hours trying to get some class that can port to port you 10 zones away, and charge you sometimes up to 20p, or more if your willing to pay because of say death, and then basically being stuck there and looking behind your shoulder at every moment because you surely dont want to die here, which brings me to my next point. Point  2. Binding, who wants to sit around for hours praying for someone who has that ability to come bind you so that you can die in peace on not worry about losing you character due to dieing 10 zones away from you home. Point 3. Why should this vast world and 1000 of man hours of thought that was put into this game be reduced to those limited characters with the foresaid abilities just boosting there own economy and filling up the chat screen with shouts for ports or binds or advertisements for these services. Resolution, You ready for this. This game would be far more enjoyable, esp in the long run when your character simply has to travel to experience anything really enjoyable, if there were say, various bind points, say NPC binders, or say NPC porters, class and race specific of course, that you could pay to port yourself to certain areas, like way points, lets get real, you have to travel, its part of the game, and gaming experience, but im not about to go to some unknown land, and die who knows where and have no way of getting back without spending the rest of the night running there, or  begging for someone to help me, this should not be a part of the risk involved in the game, the loss of exp is enough isnt it, why shouldnt you be able to say run for a couple zones, pay some pp for some exp to port you to x, to run to couple more zones to get another one to port you to x. and maybe get to where your going, or even have some NPC bind you for some of the same PP. This would definately promote more to travel and experience what you have spent so many hours creating only for it to go unseen by most of the gaming population, unless they make a character that is born close to there. and it should not be something that other classes use to make money off of, there is too much of that already in the selling of items. Porting and or binding should not be one of the stresses in the game, that couldnt be overcome by some desolate NPC that will provide this service to you. That would only enhance the game, and take away from the porting and binding classes economy a bit, and force them to use those skills in the way there were intended, I hope that you didnt intend them to use it as a source of income, and a source of debt for the others that have to depend on them. I would think thats why you make them group with you before they can bind you. Guess what, theres a loophole. I cant imagine you being able to honestly take away from this idea, unless your to afraid the lessened income potential to those classes would cause them to quit. If thats all there here for, then good riddens. If you read these posts, then i would certainly hope you read this one and at least consider the pros and cons of this idea. I do believe that you would find the goods far out way the bads. and would greatly impact the quest ideas and overall adventure of this game. thnks, NAELAE.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000045&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Well, I enjoy good gear and levels, but what actually has me addicted to the game is it's SUCKINESS.  I mean it.  It is way to hard to be fun as a recreational game.  I play a 48 shaman and the only time you get to relax is when you are in a boringly overpowered group or when the puller is slow.  I play because it is hard and unforgiving.  You step away from the screen while zoning...you die.  You take on a blue mob you have neved fought before...you die.  Maybe.  But...if you get your head out of your ass...you win and get lots of xp.  The game's plots make no sense (with notable exceptions).  Verant's decisions always somehow seem to be about the game getting taken advantage of (i.e. being fun and easy, again with notable exceptions).  This game is hard and caters to those that have fun without gaining levels (chatting and role-playing) and those that like a real challenge in terms of time and or smarts.  If you are the type that wants to play EQ like Myst AND get all the high levels and items...go away before you get stressed out.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000046&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>If you want a break from mindless camping and leveling, play on a PvP server like Rallos Zek and PK.  Then you are actually pitting yourself against other players rather than a creature that mindlessly attacks and chases you every round.  My druid on rallos is 26th right now, and i haven't leveled in months because i have too much fun hunting other players.  Try a pvp.

</FONT><HR>If the entire point of the game was to camp and level with an aditional rare drop in there, what would be the point of the game being on-line and multi-player interactive.  Other games on the market can do that.  Use the advantage given to you.  You are on-line among thousands of players that think, react to, and get bored with anything that gets thrown at them.  Take action into your own hands and find ways to make the game different and amasing.  House your own events no mater how small they seem.  A warrior match without weapons in the trees of Kethlin, a level 20 gold hunt in Qeynos hills, maby even a game of hide and go seek in who knows where;  anyone can create an event.  The little things that I run across like this are what makes the game great.  Players being confusing, wierd, everchanging, non-programed entities brings the game alive.  No mater how small, hold your own events.  A new angle in the game is to be in charge.  In conclusion, be different and join every event you can!  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000049&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><br>This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/001957-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/001957.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/001957-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/001957-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/001957-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=001957&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=001957&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
