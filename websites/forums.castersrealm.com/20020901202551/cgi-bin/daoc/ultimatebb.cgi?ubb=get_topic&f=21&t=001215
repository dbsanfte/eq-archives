Ok, i will not make a habit of this, since many Tl reports have info either not released to the public, or having only to do with issues currently on Pendragon. Unfortunately for our class, there are a handful of great Sorceror on Pendragon, but the majority of my info HAS to come from playing anonymously on live servers. too many items slip through the cracks this way, without enough testing on Pendragon we canot stop items from going live. So then I actually ave to witness it on a live server and try to correct it there.<P>If there was more active testing on pendragon we would have less of a problem. i woudl actually play full time on Pendragon if i thought i could do the testing of the class justice, but I cannot.<P>This particular report however covers a broad range of topics, and addresses issues well into the live spectrum of things. Most of what is here it not Pendragon specific. It is an update of sorts of where we as Sorcerors stand, and what we may need to correct soem of our long-standing problems.<P>I still prefer to not post these anywhere public, as many of them are about 80% relating to things on Pendragon only at the time. This proposed Sprit change is a prime example. look ho much time and effort was put into arguing it to death, and it has not even been done on Pendragon yet! That is counter-productive. If you want to actively hash out Pendragon items, please PLEASE start playing on Pendragon. If someone tests actively enough we can try to get them access to the Pendragon forums also.<P>This comes with a warning though!<P>I got Captain set up, and he plays on pendragon. the Cap is a lifesaver! A real numbers junkie kida guy and I love him for it. But after the first week on pendragon, a lot of his opinions that differed from mine in the public forums here vanished. once you see the inside you have a whole new appreciation for what each change and tweak really means.<P>[smile]<P>%@%@%@%@%@%@%@%@%@%@%@%@%@%@%@<P>Oh boy, where to begin….<P>[yellow]<B>Sorceror issues   </B>[/yellow] <BR>[orange]With emphasis on RvR, and overall class effectiveness [/orange] <P>many changes have come down the line as of late, and quite a few impacting the Sorceror for a change. And I am happy to say that for once it is not all bad! [smile]<P>The new Stacking of DOTs, and allowing the primary casting stat to increase their damage, are a big plus. This helps the matter line, but certainly does not complete the line…. Nor does it make the Sorceror an ‘OK’ class. We still need a lot of help.<P>[red]<B>DOTs and the Metter line in general:</B>[/red] <P>OK, with resists in place the stacking of DOTs is not nearly as overpowering as it was the first time we tried it.  Layering on 2 DOTs is now a viable way to deal some considerable damage to an opponent. It is still not an attractive option in RvR however. The time it takes to effectively use the DOT(s) limit its effectiveness greatly. Even in PvE, the efficiency on blasting away with a Body spec DD still seems to be the more effective route. So why chose DOTs at all?<P>Part of this could be remedied in this fashion…<P>Right now, in RvR, the Sorceror has 2 options for damaging a door. One is his pet, and the other is his staff. Neither are very effective. Both put something precious directly in harms way from enemy attacks. Now what if DOTs were allowed to harm keep doors? They are acid after all. Acid is notoriously good at eating away organic matter, like wood.<P>Other concerns with the matter line are even weirder. Why is there a Snare/DD? Fuiirst the spell makes little sense in the line. Second, it is exclusive, in that you either use your DOTs, or you use the snare. Why? Because the DOT will break the snare component. This makes them mutually exclusive and limits the line. Perhaps the spell should be removed, and the snare component actually added to one of the DOTs themselves. This would save the hassle of casting (and possibly recasting) the separate DD just for a Snare component.<P>This is also the line that could be most directly used to address our biggest problem as Sorcerors, our low survivability rate. Has anyone considered allowing our INT or matter spec to once again increase the value of self buffs? We are the primary CC class for our realm, but on a CC gone bad, we die almost instantly. We cannot  survive a bad pull like the others. Since our entire career is based around trying to influence the majority of the enemy at the beginning of a conflict, one would assume over time we would learn ways to prevent things from going too sour if that initial move fails.<P>Spell turning…<P>15 Second immunity to attacks…..<P>A chain equivalent mage armor…<P>[red]<B>The Mind line</B>[/red] <P>Well, here is a big ole can of worms. The most appropriate quote I can think of is…. This is not the same game it was 6 months ago. Nothing truer could be said. <P>Mez. Mez no longer needs a 1 minute immunity timer. There are more counters to mez than there are useful times to use Mez. Mez is no longer lasting as long due to resists, is being resisted outright more, can be purged, can be group purged, etc…<P>The restraints outweigh the power of the spell at this point. As my class does not have an instant version, I will make no comment on that here.<P>Confusion. OK, now this is the most appropriate spell name in the game, because whenever we talk about it most of us certainly DO become confused. The latest changes are livable. The fact that they no longer warp MOBs is nice. Helps keep things sane underground, and removes a pretty major exploit.  But now with the limits in place, can we charm enemy guards again? Since the aggro range is considered, and there is no warping, I think allowing this to effect enemy realm defenders is appropriate. You can no longer have one Sorceror warp confusing an entire keep and taking it solo, so give the spell some more usefulness in RvR for us.<P>Amnesia. Jury is still out on this one. I e-mailed Jim directly to see if  this was indeed functioning as intended. The original thought was it would function as a complete wipe of the targets agro list, and it’s hate list. As it stands now, it has a change to wipe the agro, but will never remove individuals from the MOBs hate list. So if cast on a neutral animal, the spell should make the animal forget all the people who have harmed him, and should set back to neutral mode. This would be a real life-saver for not having to deal with extra creatures accidentally caught in an AE debuff.<P>Speaking of debuffs, they need serious help. I know this is currently being looked into, but here are a few things to really consider, to make them useful for a Sorceror. One is allow them NOT to break a Mez. This goes back to the whole “class to effect multiple targets” and “not being able o survive the wrath of those multiple targets” dichotomy. We are the masters of mind. We should be adept enough o apply some of our magics to a target without breaking our own Mez.<P>Secondly, make them worth casting in the first place. All the tweaks and changes in the world mean nothing if there is no noticeable effect on the target once they are cast.<P>As for our Chrm, why is it we cannot charm enemy guards? Our mind spells are severely limited in RvR as it is. There is a severe lack of charmable MOBs at any given engagement in RvR anyway. No one wants to break away from a siege for a full 15 to 0 minutes to find and aquire a pet. They ARE humanoid last time I checked. <P>Another great idea, why do our pets not protect us? The code is in place. What if follow mode was set for defending/intercepting for the caster? There are many tools available to tanks in this world that our pets could certainly benefit from. The primary reason most have a pet is not to deal out damage, but to protect their own life. In RvR this is especially true.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><HR><BR>Q:Know what the most effective Debuff in the entire game is?<P>A:A Sorcerors charm!<BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>That’s right, our charm. In every test myself or others have performed, the results are the same. You find a spot with 2 creatures of identical type and level, and you charm one. You then make them fight. Without fail the free MOB will beat your pet every time. And it is not a close battle either. Seems charming a MOB drops them effectively 2 to 4 levels, making them fight like a blue to the caster. We catch hell for our ‘uber yellow pets’ on all sides. But the sad truth is, our ‘uber yellow pet’ is actually more like a blue pet with an inflated sense of self worth. If we suffer all the consequences and limitations of having to find a pet rather than summoning one, if our choices are limited beyond even the basic types we can summon (No guards, no quest mobs, no pets in most dungeons), then they should at least maintain their level and power when we charm them.<P>If protect mode could be set for defending the caster, passive mode should be set for buffing and spell combat. Sometimes we get a pet that casts it’s own spells, and it is convinced it’s spell is better than ours, so they start casting infinitely. Some are capable of ranged/spell combat…. Yet rush right into battle. It would be great if pets ONLY used ranged combat or buffed and healed us once set to passive. Considering we are supposed to take ‘control’ of them, we sadly have very little control over their actions.<P>[red]<B>Body line</B>[/red] <P>And here is the central topic of much debate as of late, the Body line. After months of being set incorrectly, the Mind spec DD may be set back to Spirit damage. This would do more damage to many undead in PvE, but would remove the +15% bonus it currently receives as Energy against metallic armor in RvR. Noone knows for certain how spellcrafting will impact resists overall yet, but this may need to be looked into more closely. Considering our current lack of role in RvR, this has become the one item that high level Sorcerors have become reliant upon. If this needs to change back to fit the storyline (it does), and it deemed necessary for balance (it might), then we need to ensure that Sorcerors see changes to improve their abilities overall. If this is currently the only thing they bring to the table, it cannot be removed without enhancing other aspects of their role in some fashion.<P>Perhaps the resists for a Sorceror overall need to be looked at. Maybe the Spec DD needs to be on Spirit, and the base needs to be on body. Perhaps one of the DOTs can be moved to energy. Maybe the base drain can be moved to Energy, since that would make most sense. Armor, especially metal, does not really help you from life leeching, and making the base drain Energy ensures this vital RvR tool would be available to ALL sorcerors, not just those that spec heavy body. Whatever changes are made, this one is going to take some careful analysis. As it is, it was always intended to be Sorit, but just buffing spirit resist can negatively impact the vast majority of a Sorcerors abilities.<P>The debuffs in this line AGAINST resists need help also. Once they were made instant, the ability to interrupt the opponent was gone. That was a major component to their effectiveness, and thing added has compensated for that. The biggest failing here is the 15 second duration.  No one wants to often spend the power required on these for a net gain of 15 seconds. This duration needs to come up.  With spellcrafting, having decent resists to all damage types will be far ore common, so in order for a debuff to keep pace it either has to A) drop WAY more resistance per cast (which can be a balance nightmare) or B) last long enough to make it worth the effort and power to cast the spell at all.<P>The spec root needs attention also. Roots were always on a 3 second casting time, but the spec was a 2.5 second casting timer. This was it’s advantage at the spec level 20 level. It is listed as an AE with a radius of 3, but yielded no AE. The base root has been dropped  in casting time now, so even if you full Body spec from level 1, but the time you hit 20 and get the first iteration of the Spec root,  the base line root is almost half the power cost, and only 5 second shorter duration. Something needs to change on the roots to make the spec root more viable. Maybe the level 20 version needs to have AE enabled for it.<P>[orange]<B>Overall in groups! </B>[/orange]<P>We aren’t equipped as well as other CC classes to do our job. On paper we have the finest CC spells of any class. What is NOT written, is that once a single pull goes wrong, we are almost invariably dead. There is no second chance for us. We have no armor, low Hps, no emergency spells, nothing. We are there for our group, and serve them by trying to put our trademark on every opponent that approaches. But if that trademark fails, every one of those targets comes immediately for our tender, exposed, throats.<P>There are other classes capable of deliver enough CC for most situations in this game. Our higher levels of CS is almost never ‘required’, as fights do not last very long. That, or people pull intentionally light to avoid the need for heavy CC. Those classes that can deliver CC also bring other sought after abilities to a group. They are a package deal. They also can survive the bad pull far better than we can.<P>So not only is this the survivability issue again, it is a matter of group worth. What do we offer a group? Our run speed is not the highest. Our debuffs are not required as they are negligible. We can deal damage, but if we deal too much we run into the survivability issue again. We rarely hear a group ASK us to bring a pet, as they would rather go without due to control and XP concerns. Our CC is really all we bring, and as we have all seen, we do not survive long enough for that to be applied well.<P>What do the other CC classes offer? In Midgaard they are also your prime healer and rezzer. They have nice armor, and the ability to survive that bad pull quite well. They have single target, and AE versions of the spells, AND have them as instant spells depending on how they spec. Bard? Again instants, armor, and much better speed buffs. Not to mention friendly buffs all the way around on bards and healers.<P>But each realm is different….<P>What do our replacement CC classes offer a group in PvE then? There is a pulsing bladeturn, faster run speeds, power refresh. Buffs, healing, etc… etc….<P>We need something more to offer a group. And we need the basic tools to survive while performing our basic function, that of CC.<P>Another thing that impacts PvE, why can we not gain Minion Control as a RA? We have seen our pets are actually no better than a summoned pet for a caster our level, and we must go to great lengths to aquire that pet. We also must suffer the largest XP drain for that pet with no possible RA to offset this?<P>[orange]<B>RvR concerns….   </B>[/orange]<P>And our group welcome gets no better here. Half our mind spells have no effect on enemies in RvR. The few items we can do, earn neither us, or anyone we are grouped with, Rps. Anyone who wants Rps has become a body spec Sorceror which blasts and tried the occasional mez, this is what we have been reduced to. For all our abilities on paper, we have become mezWizards. This is not a bad choice if this is your preferred play style, but when it is the only viable option, something is wrong.<P>For all the talk of our dreaded mez, we are horribly ill equipped to even deliver that spell. Nearsight, and instant casts, hurt it severely, and if you DO land it ,it can always be purged away. When comparing us again to other CC classes, we are ill-equipped for the role in this arena. The instant will always win.<P>Some have suggested making Sorcerors immune to instant version of CC spells. This would be due to ur focus on mental abilities, and force the enemy to meet us on even terms, with castable versions of CC only. Though this may prevent US from being Mezzed, all we could do would be Mez the enemy forces after ours were already mezzed. Then we would be the only active person in a field of statues, so not sure how greatly that would help, but it is an interesting idea.<P>Again spell turning comes up time and again. <P>In RvR our biggest concerns are these. We lose the battle of the CC every time since we ( nor anyone in Albion) have no instant casting spells, nor a way to block or prevent them. And we also have no survivability, and are target number one. Even if we DO land a great AE mez for our allies, even if we DO get a DOT on, or pop off a few DD spells, we rarely live long enough to reap the majority of the rewards for our efforts.<P>[blue]<B>Miscellaneous….   </B>[/blue] <P>Ok, most of this was really for class balance and RvR issues, but there are some outstanding bugs and quirks that deserve mention.<P>Interruptions on casters is ridiculous. Being interrupted from afar, being interrupted by mezzed enemies, etc…. Too many quirks to list here in a report. Soemthing is up with the interruption code. I am all for losing it entirely and letting us always cast! [smile] not like tanks can be interrupted mid swing, so why should we be interrupted mid cast? K ok, I am kidding. But this does need looked into.<P>Much like heals breaking a nearby mez, we are seein issues with Charm breaking a nearby Mez. Gorbachends seem to be a high occurrence target for this. Here is the scenario..<P>You AE mez 2 Gorbs next to each other, they are NOT linked.<BR>You move in and Charm ONE of them.<BR>The other one breaks his mez and rushes straight at you, while your new pet remains mezzed.<BR>You get a free ride home taking the express route.<P>Charms near a mez certainly should not break a mez.<P>And lastly, I am trying to compile some current and solid info on resists in general. I am trying to determine if it is easier to stack resists against one realms abilities than it would be for other realms. Case in point, I think maybe Albion has far more of their ability centered on only the Spirit resist than the other realms, not to mention it seems they are the only realm without SOME form of Mez based on Spirit.

Very nice [smile]<P> Just so everyone knows the reason for the [green][/green] etc... in the post is because thats the way the Pendragon boards are set up for colors and emotes.<P> Anyway  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"> All in all its a very nice report and only ask that if any information is gained from the post directly can be passed on to the community here (if its ok'd by Mythic that is  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"> ) Its nice to see the report itself but to get some kind of idea that some of the points are being looked at is what the community really needs. Now I for one know alot of it can not be passed on word for word but even a "Hey someone is looking into some of these things." is better then nothing. <P><BR> Thanks again bro.

"If this needs to change back to fit the storyline (it does)"<P>You really should not take the storyline, what little of one there is, into consideration. Mythic certainly does not worry about the storyline or they would not be introducing the necromancer class into Albion.

That's the point, they can twist anything to fit into the storyline, no need to use that as a limitation.<P>On a side note... giving Albion Necros does not make sense. They already have population issues with Albion and a Necro is going to be a very popular class, at least until they nerf it down to nothing  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"><P>Battik

Plus, who here is willing to bet that there won't be many "new" spells to this class, but only shiny version of pre-existing effects.  If that is the case, it does Albion a disservice, since we already have too many classes to split the pool of abilities allready.

Umm...good report  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"> thanks. Really nailed down some of the most frustrating issues about this class. <P>Did not know that TLs rarely get feedback about their reports (good and bad). This just adds to a list a disapointments by Mythic Dev team. Seems like they would at least say :yea" or "no way" to idea presented so the community doesn't focus on them anymore.<P>Why no mention of instant PBAE stun? I know you have gotten feedback suggesting that this was not a viable option, but does that mean we can't push for it? Still have not seen a reasonable explanation why an Alb class (Sorc as preferred choice) cannot get an instant AE stun to help balance Cc classes. Then again, maybe you got an emphatic no?<P>Was glad to see the "pet protect" thing and some other idea listed. Even if we don;t get them, maybe some Alb class will.

"Case in point, I think maybe Albion has far more of their ability centered on only the Spirit resist than the other realms, not to mention it seems they are the only realm without SOME form of Mez based on Spirit."<P>this makes no sense.<P>are you trying to say that a large amount of albion offensive spells along with mez are bulked together in the SPIRIT category? and that other realms can easily defend against us because of that fact?

an instant pb ae stun would do pretty damn well for our "survivability".<P>would give us just enough time to get away from any failed cc attempt in pve and pvp.<P>I don't feel it'd be overpowered.

another thing while i'm posting on this thread... <P>i am also on pendragon, but i've found pendragon testing to be strange. As far as group situations go... people aren't very friendly for the most part (probably because no one knows each other). kinda feel it's like pulling apathetic teeth to get a group most of the time.<P>a global idea for pendragon would be to turn on global say for all realms. would be nice to talk to the enemies we're testing on.

The energy  change WAS quite intentional.  It is a class killer to go to spirit.  The 45 nuke is the only reason I'm sticking around BECAUSE our CC is anemic in RvR relative to our opposition and the matter line is not up to speed.<P>You don't like "templates"  Bullseye?  To bad . For they develope thru the ingenuity of players who want to maintain class viability.<P>New template for us.  45 Body rest in mind, unless they screw with our energy DD in which case new specc is Dyemerchant.<P>Energy fits better with the already fractured fairy tale that is Mythics storyline than most things(e.g. no CC or offensive spell aside from debuffs as instas to the group-cloth casters - who sacrificed all defense to be best in magic = stupid).  We are not the kings of the undead or spirit issues. That is healers.  Our story's genisis is that we learned to master arts related to the mind, body and matter in general.  Bodies generate both chemical and electronic impulses to function.  How to you think data is transfered from one neuro synapsis to another?  <P>So give me a break.  Energy fits well.  And no matter how often you chant the mantra to the contrary was consciously changed to energy from spirit for valid reason.<P>Don't screw up one of the few things we have left to us.

I also agree that taking ranged instas out altogether would be far more beneficial to the game as a whole, but I don't think we will eve see this. So, giving us the same instant AE mezz would be the next best choice.<P>The PBAE stun that I would like to see goes along with Uziel's thinking. It's more of a "Get out of jail" card; a backup option for those many time mezz is resisted, purged, etc and we need a few seconds to move out of harms way.  It sort of like our own version of better armor.<P>No, this doesnt compet with ranged isntants, but if ranged instants aren't an option for us, then this is what I see as the next best thing. Uziel is correct in stating this is useful in both RvR and PvE to increase survivability without overpowering us.<P>That's not to say, this is the answer to all our concerns, but worth exploring for viability given that we currently have nothing as a backup option as the other realm's CC classes do.

Would it be possible to give us better range with Mezz?  Not Nearsight range, but better than the folks with Instants.  That's more in keeping with a caster class.<P>If the DD has to be Spirit could we get a secondary effect on it?  Like preventing casters from casting for a few seconds after.<P>Is Amnesia on the list of stuff that will get realm points?  I use it a bunch in RvR, but always so other folks can close for a kill.

Well, since you see no value in it whatsoever, I suppose it was a wasted post.<P>You forgot that a spell checker will also flag RvR, rezzer, uber,etc...... I STILL have the word file here, with the red underlines. I missed seein and ur, but most others are capitals, which causes the spell checker to ignore them.<P>And both Sorceror and Midgaard are accurrate. There is more than one accepted spelling of a practitioner of Sorcery. Last I checked, it was "Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone" on the cover. <P>And Midgaard is the correct English spelling. I tried to use it time and again to get through to them in BETA, but they did not use the proper form.<P>So as long as we are nit-picking my typos, let's call a spade a spade and not accuse me of getting something wrong that are actually correct.

Cricket-  I did not have any problems reading the report.  It was clear and well stated.  Have you looked at some of the other reports team leads turn in?  They may have better spelling on occasion, but it's like trying to play a word game trying to figure out what the heck they are talking aobut.<P>I don't always agree with Bullseye, but that was one of the better reports I've seen from any team lead.  It was well formatted, easy to read, and gave good explainations for what was being said.<P>If you are more concerned with the spelling and grammar of the report than the issues invilved in it perhaps you should rethink your priorities.<P>Good report Bulseye.  I am glad to see that along with your ideas you also included much of what the majority of the sorcerer community has been stating even when you have not agreed with all of it.  Thank you.

As I stated in a previous post<P>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><HR> Overall, it saw a graet report! I was pleasantly supriesd.

The sorcerer class needs help and rebalancing in order to be effective and desired in both PvE and RvR. Our team lead should represent the rational views of the player community. If the majority of sorcerers want something implemented or changed I believe he should be our voice.

Word just doesn't recognize them.  Why should I restate the obvious here? Those words weren't mangled by Bullseye. It makes no sense why you'd think I should have pointed those out as errors.  <P>&lt;ponders&gt; Wonder why my Word spell checker catches misspelled capitalized words and Bullseye's doesn't.  <P>As far as Sorceror goes, I looked on my Harry Potter copy. It's title is "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone".  Neither Webster's dictionary or thesaurus.com recognize sorceror.

Bullseye did a nice job articulating many of our concerns. I wish Mythic would take the report seriously.  A team lead is just that...providing guidance and wisdom as needed by the group. It should work more like a democracy and less like a monarchy in my humble opinion.  Recent remarks made by Bullseye on how he perceives his role have rankled many in the sorcerer community.<P>Just my two coppers.<P>The Anal Retentive Sorcerer

I cannot type and do not even care fo spell checker as long as what I say gets to the people reading it. Its an informal report to the developers I am sure they are not taking points off for spelling either. Most TL's are so dang busy that they are usually in a huge hurry to get the reports finished and handed in so the actual problems can be view by the Developers.<P> cricket you forgot to capatalize the C in your name btw  <IMG SRC="tongue.gif" border="0"> (oops should have spelled out "by the way") sorry.
