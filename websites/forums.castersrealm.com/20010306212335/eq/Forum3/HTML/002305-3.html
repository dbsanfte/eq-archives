</FONT><HR>I've never played a cleric, but I do have quite a bit of experience with other classes.  The first day EverQuest was released for retail sales I joined.  Since then many changes have been made.  Some good and some bad.  What I find most appauling is Verant's treatment of its customers.  This is very apparent with the recent cleric adjustments.  Granted these alterations may be worthwhile and needed, but to answer the obvious player dissatisfaction, Verant tells everyone that things change and that's the way it is.  Well my question is this.  Suppose an executive told you that the last two years of EverQuest were ok, but now they want you to totally rewrite the entire game in a different programming language.  The change isn't necessary, however they feel you need something to alter your daily routine.  Now imagine that every month or so you're told to recode everything in different languages.  I think after a while you'd be pretty fed up with it all.  Which is exactly where many players are.  I understand things need to evolve, but with so many disgruntled you need to reevaluate your position.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000051&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>First off I would like to say I am not a cleric, I actually play an enchanter.  I would just like to point out somethings I have noticed.  I have read many posts here and the replies and I sympathize with you all, after all I am an enchanter and it seems that VI has not yet had time for us.<P>Anyways, what I wanted to point out is Alan's response to issues raised.  Here is an example:<P>Issue raised:<P>"Granted there is a group of players who don't mind, but Honestly, we're sick and tired of needing to relearn tactics. I'll gladly take the challenge of learning how to beat a new monster, but I'm disgusted that every time I turn around and you change the AI, that I need to relearn how to beat the same monster I've already learnt how to handle."<P><BR>Alan's Response:<BR>"Well, personally, I strongly disagree with this. As a player, I want as many new challenges as I can find. Having monsters that adapt and learn makes for one hell of a great game."<P>Noice the "personally, I strongly disagree" part.  I noticed the "I disagree" and "I want" quite a bit.  I started thinking to myself, "Who is the customer here?  VI, or the players?  What is more important, what VI wants or what the customers want?"<P>Sure the designers should have some judgement as to what to add to a game or what to take out of a game but they should also look at what the customer, aka player, wants.  All I ask is that before you "nerf" something, think about it.  Would this really make the game more enjoyable?  Would people like it?  I, although not a game designer myself, also do design software.  I think to myself, what is a feature that the customer would want?  <P>For example, Dikatana, (only using this game since many people know about it) when it first shipped would not allow saves anywhere.  After requestes by the players it was then implemented in a patch.  The game designers catered to the player's needs.  Sure it may not have been what the designers wanted, but it sure did make the game more enjoyable FOR THE PLAYERS.<P>All I ask is this:<BR>When things are added or taken away in games what should get asked first is, "Would this make the game more enjoyable?"<P>After reading all these posts, can you really believe that people are enjoy this?  I sure didn't when the tash was nerfed (in fact it almost made me not want to be an echanter, but after investing much of MY own time before realizing how difficult it was, I did not want to start another character).<P>Thank you for hearing me out,<BR>Eladars<BR>enchanter of the 25th</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000054&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Ok I must disagree about the fact this only affects high lvl encounters. I was fighting orcs today with a full group and I casted Healing (yes just healing) on our tank well the "a" orc went after me and no matter what the rest of the group did to it  it wouldnt get off of me. I even put barrier up and it still tried to hit me while the rest of the group pounded on it......  I guess its time to switch to another class   one that doesnt need as much healing. Because there wont be many clerics soon.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000055&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I've never really truly played a Cleric before (i.e.: past level 10), but I have had my experiences with having to be the lifeline of another, more powerful player (as my Paladin). I do agree, Heals ought to, and should always have caused an enemy to aggro on to the person casting the heal, but Verant has taken far too big a step in this direction, and has not given any means to the players in the high-end game to peel the mob off the healer before the healer is pounded into a nice gooey puddle. If players could actually ROOT or MEZ the mobs, for instance, then the healer could step back and let the other characters do their job, and then repeat the step again. When a mob complete-heals another mob, the players can all aggro on to the mob that healed the other, but the difference is, chances are those players can easily be rooted/snared/mezzed/stunned/etc. It doesn't work the other way around, though, from what I've heard. THAT is out of balance, and if Verant REALLY wants to add a bit of flavor to this, they should allow players to actually stun/root/snare/mez these mobs, so something can actually be done to save that poor healer, besides trying to peel the skin on the mob's back off with semi-useless melee.<P>Another idea would be to make taunt actually DO something. I've heard that Taunting is absolutely useless now in higher levels. If I were in PvP and fighting, say, a shadowknight and a paladin at the same time by myself.. and I was currently on the Paladin because of his healing abilities, I'd at least be a little worried about the Shadowknight behind me threatening to Harm Touch and DOT me.<P>But as things are right now, as I see it, if you guys at Verant want these changes to stay where they are AND satisfy the consumer base, you need to start a quest for the almighty GM Wand so we can insta-port ourselves to our corpses, insta-rez ourselves with full experience, and such, because there will be a LOT of people dying out there. However, seeing as this PROBABLY won't be the route you guys will take, my suggestion as a consumer would be to either tone down the aggro, or give other classes some MEANS to help take away some of that aggro (taunt, root, mez, snare, magic--all come to mind). Maybe this would be a good time for the classes that have sunken below usefulness to make a comeback somehow? (Paladin/SK comes to mind--not to plug them or anything. :p)<P>However, as I have not actually played into the higher levels myself, I have not experienced this all first-hand as others have, so I'm only basing this post on what I've heard, as well as my vivid imagination. I will say, though.. I've been getting kind of bored with my favorite characters lately (22 Paladin, 24 Shadowknight), and before this nerf/after I heard exactly how useless these two classes are in the higher levels (another rant entirely) and letting my imagination have some time on it, I've been daunted, even afraid of the higher levels. And I was originally planning on retiring these characters at level 50.. but upon reading all of THIS, I'm not even sure if I want to play them at ALL if the end result will be me paying for mass uselessness, chaos and frustration.<P>When I first started playing this game, it was easy, it was fun, and I enjoyed grouping with fellow Elves and fighting orcs at orc hill in GFay. The game was simple, yet challenging and quite fun, and I didn't mind paying $25 every three months for it. Somewhere along the path, though, the game started losing its fun and simplicity factors, and the challenge factor has been slowly filling the void left behind, and I've seen Verant's customer service slowly becoming more and more bitter, making it all less appealing as well ("I want", "I disagree", "The Vision™"... where are we in your Vision™?). But now I'm beginning to ramble. It's past 3am here, I got off work about two hours ago, and I'm tired. Perhaps I'll reconsider my say in this tomorrow. However, I doubt I'll play EverQuest more for more than an hour, if at all. Nothing personal, it's just not as fun as it used to be.<P>(And to Absor/Alan, if you're reading this, I mean nothing personal by quoting "I disagree", "The Vision™", etc. Honestly, I think you do an awesome job; I could never handle your position, to be honest. But I'm just saying that we, the customers, need to have a bit more say in things as well. You sayind "I disagree" sounds like you just completely stamped out our ideas because they interfere with the Vision™... It's like people living in a country with a powerful king who is completely xenophobic. When people come forth and say they would like to live in houses instead of simply tents and cabins, for example, the king would flat-out REFUSE to give anyone permission to live in a house, because he always envisioned people living in tents and cabins--betcha not very many people would be living in that country afterward, hmm? Personally, I wouldn't.)<P>And lastly, please forgive me if this post is a bit hard to read. I realize I did go off and rattle on at certain parts, but I felt these were parts that needed explaining. And I am dead tired in RL, so that may turn some of the rattling into utter nonsense, so.. please forgive me. :/ That's my 2cp for the evening, I'm off to bed now.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000056&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I have a L53 cleric and have played her for almost a year now. I also have a L55 druid, retired. I made the cleric with the intent on being a healer and buffer to groups.  That is what clerics do, they heal and buff, we dont get the skills to do much else.  Once in awhile we get to root, stun and nuke for fun, but overall, we are healers, we bring protection and health to our groups. <P>I have played several hours since the patch mostly in Sebillis.  I have tried just about every cleric trick I know of to reduce aggro and I get my butt beat every time.  I am not paying VI to be a tester here, this should have been thouroughly tested on test server first.  If VI says this is the kind of thing that cant be tested on test, then VI needs to find a solution to THAT problem.<P>I pay to PLAY, I dont pay to be a guniea pig.  I want to log in and have FUN, I no longer have fun after this patch, that factor is gone for me and replaced by FRUSTRATION.  I dont want to keep dying and watch my group die because of VI's twisted, dillusional vision.<P>I want customer service!  For weeks, it was posted and asked of us what changes we felt we needed for our classes.  Clerics posted their views, for a long time we have been asking for a few things, NONE of which to this day have been addressed. Where is the concern for your playing base here?  <P>Its obvious VI doesnt play the game at higher levels, and it shows.  VI, you have really made fools of yourself here.  I have tried the changes and working with them and they are ridiculously overboard.<P>I can agree with the aggro change on healers...BUT....!  Make the tanks able to do what tanks do...TAUNT and DAMAGE! The agrro is tuned way to high and the taunt is now too low. This change is so overbalancing VI has indirectly changed the dynamics of the whole game.  If I heal a group member, I should get aggrod on, but my tanks or other party members *should* be able to get it off me in a reasonable amount of time without my butt being handed to me every time.  Im not talking just CHs here, Im talking remedy and Sup Heal also.<P>Verant isnt giving the customers what they want.  VI is doing what THEY want.  I feel we dont matter, yet we are the ones paying for this and indirectly paying your salaries.<P>To get to the question of game dynamics...This game has been going on 2 years and there are still bugs and broken quests in the game that have yet to be addressed.  There is no reason to change the game so drastically as you have.  I think its ok to change games to a certain extent for the right reasons, but I think VI has taken this too far and isnt doing it for the right reasons.  They arent doing it to better their product according to what the customer wants, they are doing it according to what THEY want.<P>This game is no longer that important to me in my life anymore that I need to pay for it or play it.  My life will go on without  EQ in it.  I have played to try and adapt to the changes, but its futile.  The fun is gone for me, I log frustrated and sad. Then I think what a fool I am to keep doing this.<P>My cleric is parked, she will come out to res someone or help a friend if needed and that is all.  I wont create another char and keep playing this game.  As it is, I am on the verge of cancelling my account.  Why stay someowhere if you no longer enjoy what youre doing?<P>I hope VI wakes up, realizes the mistakes they have made and saves face before its too late.  Its ok to make mistakes, its even better to admit you made a mistake.  People have more respect for you when you can say "I was wrong, how can this be fixed?"<P>Verant, please listen to what your customers want before this is irreparable.  You dont want to lose people because you cant see beyond what you want.<P><p>[This message has been edited by Whysperings (edited February 25, 2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000059&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Change is good. It forces players to pay attention, and can in some cases level the playing field between newer players and old timers. However, what bothers me is Verants one sided view point on ballancing issues. If a MOB is too powerful, then they say we the players will have to "figure out" how to kill it. But if an item or spell is too powerful, it's "broken." Up until about 6 months ago, I never heard VI use that term. But since then, every "nerf" has become a "fix of a broken issue." If something benifits the player, it is "broken", if it is a hindrance, it is a "opprotunity."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000060&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>No they should not change the mechanics of the game.This was a core change just like the Haste nerf.Both had been part of the game since it started,they should not change the core game.Now if they wanted to Give a super great heal C heal with a 2 sec casting time but make it a HUGE aggro. that would be ok, because it is our choice if we want the benifit of a better spell then we take the aggro.But makeing us basicly worthless is just wrong.<P> And yes i have tested the changes ALOT. Tonight vs Zlandicar 5 of the 8 clerics died within the first 30 seconds of the fight.Hell even one of the named rats in DN ate 5 clerics.Same result with Klandicar.In all these fights the clerics died with 80% mana left though we won all the fights thanks to druid heals(ironic isnt it)<P> Here is the kicker,I have heard many times dont use C heal,use a smaller heal.Well if we do this then why not take a druid in our place.Because Yes we may have a better heal than they do(C heal) but haveing something you cant use means nothing at all so druids are just as good a healer as a cleric and bring to the table MUCH more in other abilitys than a cleric.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000061&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I'm not going to rehash what everyone else has already posted (yes I have read through all of them).  I fully agree with what most people have been saying, and I am very disappointed at the changes.  I will simply add my experiences with the rest, and then a few comments of my own.<P>I am a 41st level cleric, and play in Velious all the time, because I think its a really cool place.  The night of the patch I got a group of 4together, to kill Chrys wurms in great divide to see if we could get our 50th level spells.  I was grouped with 2 53rd paladins, and a 54th level ranger.  In almost every every fight the mob would agro on me as soon as I cast CH on one of them.  Now during a fight, since the wurms hit for 115s, I needed to cast usually 2, sometimes as many as 3 CHs to keep my guys alive.  If it did happen that I had to cast a 3rd CH, then there was no way to get the mob off of me.  The only way to do it was to cast root on it (me and the pallys) and hope he didnt resist (which since he is a vellius mob, resist is pretty often) before he droped me in 15 seconds.  This is 3 53/54 tanks doign melee, stuns, nukes, taunts and they couldn't pull him off.  This even happened at times on the first or second CH if the melles got unluck on the damage rolls.  Snare dont work, because the range of my spells is only fractionally longer than the wurms own melee range, plus there is little to no room to manouver without pulling all the rest of the room on you.  In a few hours of play, I died once and came very close several others.. twice saved by a Lay Hands by the pallies.  Sure, I wouldn't have died the first time if I refused to heal a third time and let one of my tanks die.. but then I'd never find a group that would want to play with me ever again would I?<P>On top of that, I found it nearly impossible to sit down after even the first CH, because that would piss the mob off even more and provoke him to charge on me for a couple of 115 double hits, which is a significant portion of my 1500 buffed hps.  No way am I going to heal myself in a fight now.  I imagine if I do, I'd never get the stupid mobs off of me.  So the side effect of it all is alot less time to med = longer sits between fights. <P>I mean, the game is slow and plodding as it is in many situations.  This change simply amplifies that effect in all situations.  This isn't only a cleric nerf, its a EQ-Player nerf.  This affects every player in the game that doens't solo... and it is supposed to be a group based game right?  I mean, jesus, the only really fun times I've had with my cleric is with a tank heavy group pulling trains non stop and having the challenge of keeping them alive and using as little mana as possible so the next train can begin as soon as the first one is finished.  I hate sitting on my butt for 5-10  minutes at a time medding in between encounters.  That's just plain boring.  But from my experience now (with just a single mob that is blue to me!) is that my very few fun days are over.  There is no chance in all of hell that "train groups" can ever exist again.  Because as soon as a healer heals for the first time, they'll be dead meat.<P><BR>Now I find some of Absor's comments about mobs healing themselves pretty self defeating.  I mean, of course it pisses off a group of 40 players beating on a mob with 32K hps when she CHs herself.  It took that bunch of players along time to beat her down to that level.  How long does it take her to beat down that warrior in the front row again after he gets a CH?  Try seconds?  Maybe I'm just not thining on the same wavelength here.. but I don't see any comparison there whatsoever.<P>Nor do PC clerics get the kind of AC and hps that mob clerics get (not to mention damage output) to defend ourselves when a CH or other heal spell pisses off its enemies.<P>"I hate to do this but lets look at Evade...ect"  Well, what comparison is there between that and healing?  Rogues can at least turn off attack to lower thier agro from time to time.  Can we as clerics turn off a mobs ability to do damage from time to time so that we dont have to heal as much?  Hell No!  That is a silly and irresponsible comparison to make.<P>"there is a chicken and the egg thing going on here... ect"  I honestly can't see how jacking up the difficulty of the whole game by 200%, because 3% of the player base is too good for your coding ability, helps the game and makes it better.  I mean, good for those lucky players in uber guilds who don't do much anything but play EQ in thier spare time.  All the power to them if they actually get good at the game and figure out how to beat your code.  But that doensn't mean that the other 97% can even GET that shot at beating your code.  How can making the game challenging for 3% of the player base, while at the same time making it brutally un-fun to play for the vast majority be a good change?<P>I mean.. maybe the healing agro "was broken" to begin with.  But you have based the last 2 and whatever years of mob balancing/new mob content ON THAT BUG!!!  How dare you remove it and say, "Hey, bend over, I've got somethign to give ya!".  Every single mob in the game was balanced the way it was with healing as the primary thing on everyone's mind.  Now that healing won't be happening as often... ALL mobs are WAY overpowered.<P>I don't think VI has a clue what they are doing.  They say that this period is the time they want to spend "fine tuning" the game.  What this change has done is REDEFINE the game and gameplay in general.  This will now take months of balancing to sort all the crap out since this change has and will continue to snowball, affecting almost all aspects of gameplay.  VI seems to be going backwards here.  They took a fairly balanced game (it should be after a few years of us paying to be beta testers).. and turned it on its head.  Haven't you ever heard of the expression "If the sh*t ain't broken, Don't fix it!" ???<P>Oops.. I forgot.. it was "broken" from the start and left that way for hell coming on three years now.  <P>I definetly have to get some of the stuff that VI has been smoking in the office lately...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000062&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I 100 Percent agree with the new agro system.  Think about it...<P>Let's say you're in a dungeon and your group is fighting a warrior type mob.  A healer type mob happens to spawn and begins healing the warrior mob.  Where does your group turn it's attention to?  The mob that heals of course.  It only makes sense.<P>Why shouldn't the game have an evolving AI?  Our characters do.  They are played by humans.  What if every mob in the game was controlled by a human?  They would then have an ever-evolving AI just as our characters do.  My guess is that more people would find if more fun and challenging than the same old routine.<P>How many times can you walk into the same place and kill the same mobs in the same order?  For me, maybe three or four times.  If it's not challenging anymore, it is no fun for me and I move to a different area of the game.<P>And yes, I have a level 54 cleric on Tarew Marr and I am in no way displeased with the recent patch.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000064&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Here's my opinion in a nut shell.  Strategies should change for different dungeons and different situation but one thing should be constant...your ability to rely on your party and the knowledge you have of how your party works.  The challenge is in the new dungeons and learning your place in the scheme of things.<P>I am a level 57 warrior and have been playing this game religiously since the day the Bertoxxulous server opened its doors.  I have seen many changes come about and most of them in my opinion were for the better, but this one just doesn't make sense.<P>Last night my guild rolled The Spiroc Lord in PoA.  Most of the time I couldn't effectively taunt anything.  Clerics, druids, and shaman were dropping like flies because every time they healed a tank the mobs on that island were stuck to them like glue.  It was completely rediculous.  Hell, you more nerfed my taunting ability than anything!<P>In this game it is my belief that you should be able to count on your party...not on the dungeons or the mobs but on your party and the knowledge you have gained from two years of playing EQ.  I know my part in a group.  I've been playing it for a long time and people can count on me to play it to the best of my abilities...don't change this.  Make dungeons more complex and difficult but don't change how a party works as a unit.  Change the mobs up all you want, change the zones however you like, but don't change the fundamental way a party works together...after all in a setting like this you should be able to count on one thing....your friends abilities to do their jobs effectively.<P>Valas Steelblade<BR>57th level warrior<BR>Kabald Seventh Hammer<BR>Grrrr.

</FONT><HR>Well first of all i play a lvl 52 cleric, or should I say target now? for the longest time getting used to ch as the most efficent spell was great , learn how to time the casting etc, then at higher lvls its about the only spell we get that will heal anywhere near the hps that the tanks we need to heal are losing, celestial line is ok , if your not in a high lvl dungeon and casting it on someone thats getting beat on at that exact moment, remedy only thing that spell is good for is chain healing caster, superior heal eh its there, next lvl is divine light that uses barely less mana than ch , don't see where thats all that good but well you at verant know whats best I'm sure ( note the sarcasm there)  so what they basically did was take our best heal .. made it useless, gave druids and shamans better heal spells, wonder if we clerics will get sow?   doubt it but ya know ...  because without ch what are we enhanced druids/shamans with decent buffs and no sow?<P><BR>though on a side note now .. someone posted somewhere that ch now requires a component .. 1 coffin per cast ( depending on the cr) think they might lower the cost of peridots knowing that?  just one more thing for clerics to spend money on ...<P><BR>they really screwed this one up,  and ya know they are going to sit there forever .. no it was the vision (tm)  so its not gonna get fixed soon because we should all play it first , did that all weekend , is it gonna get better nah , but it will take them forever to admit they royally goofed on this one<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000066&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>*Sigh*<BR>I knew this day would come, but I honestly felt that it would be under more pleasant circumstances.  Time to stop playing EQ.  I have been playing since Day One and have had many good times.  But now, it has changed.  I just can't figure it out... Verant has been doing their damnedest to make the game UNFUN.  HELLOOO VERANT.. CAN YOU HEAR THIS? THE GAME IS NOT FUN ANYMORE!  I don't believe that these guys actually play it.  Try finding a group with a level 55 wizard... good luck!  Unless you are doing a dragon, forget about it.  Nobody wants you (which I can't understand cause i love having wizzies with my alts).  Taking hours to find a group DOES NOT WORK IF YOU CANNOT SPEND SEVERAL HOURS A DAY LOOKING.  So you are forced to solo in Tim Deep - boring boring.  Now my 52 cleric dies REAL fast and simply can't do what a cleric is supposed to do.  I believe that they have made a HUGE mistake.  But I give up.  They have set this game up for power players... those who can play 6 to 12 hours a day, and have the time to find groups and figure out how verant has ****ed with the strategies this week.  I hate leaving on a sour note, but goodbye all... it's been fun.  And damn you Verant for not listening.<P>Jediben 56th level Wizard of Povar<BR>Daldain 52nd level Cleric of Povar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000067&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I wanted to play a Cleric when told that more where needed in the game. Okay. Something different for me. So I created an Alt and move it up to Level 6 which as we all know is easy to do. Yes, I know... still considered a 'newbie' at that level. But I felt good about be able to help others who find themselves in a 'jam' during a Battle by being able to cast a little Minor Heal on them now and again, even when hanging out in the Town, simply resting. I am NOT trying to UBER'Power UP!' or any of those things for this Cleric. Just help and feel better about it.<P>As you know, many players take to taunting/fighting those cockroaches who endlessly march around like atomic robots throughout the town. Yes, I do mean the Guards. Normally, we have to live with their presence when they are not busy Kill Stealing players' intended kills at the Front Gate. But this time, I was stationed near the Bank in the middle of the large Square where many other players were simply hanging-out and chatting or trading. <P>A player got into it with an NPC Guard... Whack.. Hack.. Slash! And I was casually watching this 'battle' and many others do at times. I noticed the Player's health reading getting a bit low for his comfort. So no big deal.. I cast a Light Heal on him. ONE time. His Health didn't really improve that much, as the fight was continuing and moving 'out of range' of where I was standing and into another room. Never thought about the act... and figured if the Player was so intent on continuing the fight with the Guard and getting the Kill.. more power to him. I turn back to my OOC yakking with another player.<P>NEARLY FIVE MINUTES LATER....<BR>           *** WHHHAAMMMM! ***<P>Without any warning or comment, Guard Kill-Steal has returned into the open Square. You guessed it.. upon ME! I go down with one blow delivered from behind. Remember, I am level 6.. which is *nothing* to them. What Level is a typical Guard, anyway??<P>Upon the obligatory 'Funeral Music' and 'STAND-BY, LOADING' screen message... I Page the player and asked, "What the F**K just happened??? He pages me back and says, 'Oh, you mean my fight with the Guard earlier? He was getting to heavy to handle.. so I Zoned Out." <P>What????  I throw in ONE... ONE Minor Heal and cast it on an unknown player.. and now I become the Guard's number one Cookie Dough minutes later after the fact? Never mind that the Guard already has forgotten about the attacking player. That player simply Zones back in and all is forgiven on him. BAH!   <P>You may call this... 'Adapting to the Changing Dynamics of the game.' I call it the ream job without the Vaseline jar.<P>As it seems that this new HEAL AGGRO travesty of a Game Adjustment will stand, I have now made it my edict... Never... NEVER to cast ANY further Heals on Players in the game, unless the monster (or KS Guard) is dead... Dead.. DEAD!  And I know.. this is sadly unfair to players who hope for.. or expect a Cleric to Heal them during the course of a 'battle.' The time it takes to go through all the running back to get my CORPSE, and loading back up of Spells... does not make it worth it to me.<P>Yes, I am not talking about actual Group Battles which I may or may not be called in to participate. I know that in the game, the mechanics and ICness of what players do on the battle-field or in the middle of their so-called 'safe haven' are really the same thing. But this latest change reeks to me. <P>It makes ME as a young Cleric look bad when I have to STAND THERE and wait for some monster to be fully put down, before I begin my first heal casting. But I am not playing some Noble Self-Sacrificing Paladin ready to give their 'life' for the team, yadda.. yadda. If I wanted that.. I would have CREATED a Pally character to do so. My character life as a 'Cleric' is weak enough as it is. I don't intend to Commit SUICIDE with every Healing cast, even in a small way.<P>Thank you for your time and I look forward to reading more on this topic.<P> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000068&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Clerics already have one of the hardest jobs in the game: Keeping your entire group alive. This is just one more step in trying to make the life of a cleric harder.

</FONT><HR>Here is my experience fighting Treah Greenroot in POG with a skeleton crew of like 2 groups.  We had 2 clerics, 1 warrior, several lesser melees, and like 5 necros.  I was healing the 60 ogre warrior who is fully decked out, and I am a 60 cleric with like 1030AC and 3100HP self-buffed.  For the first minute of the fight I healed noone.  I then cast remedy on the warrior to test out the new aggro rules: I got summoned and double attacked for 500 500.  I heal myself up and then I CH the warrior about a minute later: I got summoned and attacked so I divine aura'd.  Treah stayed on me for almost the entire DA period before going back to the warrior.  I heal myself and sit down to med (in range): Treah summons me anyway and double attacks me for 700 700. OK now I am pissed off so I stand in range and try Celestial Elixir on the warrior: I don't get hit but I am unable to keep up with the damage being taken by the warrior.  I CH the warrior again: Once again I get summoned and this time DA gets interrupted and I die.  At this point we had Treah around 45% but then the warrior quickly died and we eventually got wiped out.  Keep in mind pre-patch Treah would not have hit me at all and we would have won this fight since we had many necros to spike me with mana.  <P>It appears Verant has nerfed all guilds who try to do more with less people, now you need to plan ahead for clerics dying too rapidly and bring more people.  This also accentuates the ridiculous tactic of epic-ressing the fallen back into battle: why heal a tank when that will only kill the cleric?  Just res him back in, BPheal him, give him Aegolism and send him back into the fray.<P>Bigammer Bighealer of House of Chop<P>PS: congrats Druzzil Ro (HOSS) on killing us in the TOT, that was an epic battle.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000070&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>You gotta love the VI employee...er I mean Anon posters that just LOVE theses changes. <P>Well I hope you enjoy the extra time that VI wants from you to relean everything.  Hope you enjoy the added downtime this has caused during raids for your guild as you TRY to figure out how to handle all mobs again.<P>Also, you cannot compare how we would attack a healing mob to justify this change.  Because mob's dont fight like us, not even close.  They summon, they do ungodly damage, some cannot be touched with magic, teleport, and they run back to gather tons of friends using screwy pathing.  This is all required to make the mob harder due to the weak AI system in EQ.   So the only way that VI could add to the difficult of mobs is to have them attack straight at the heart of a group / raid and have the mob b-line straight thru a wall of tanks to kill the clerics.   They will ignore 20+ tanks taunting just to make sure that cleric that just healed is dead.   If the cleric gets off a DA, the mob will know EXACTLY when that 18 seconds is up to come back, even after all the tanks melee'd another 40-60% health off the mob, just so the mob can kill that cleric.  How does that make any sense?  There is no comparision at all.<P>You guys really need to understand what higher level mobs are like to really understand what this increased aggro has done.<P>Also I'm surprised that rangers and bards are not upset about these changes since they are the ones that will require the most healing of all the tank classes.   Why would any cleric want to group with those low AC tank classes?   Just give me a high level orge/troll warrior with top notch AC / HP gear.   Was this a negative side affect or plan expectation from VI?<P>Remove the aggro/hate changes, the game was plenty fun and challenging for us high level clerics.   If someone wants a new challenge, they can do what we have done in the past, create a new class.<BR><p>[This message has been edited by Mufin (edited February 25, 2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000071&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I have been sitting here watching my wife play her cleric for a while now. She used to rarely die. Not because of low agro, but because she knew when to heal, and when to not heal. But I just watched her have to heal the puller when he gets back to group, and the mob immediately agroed her, and NOBODY could get it off in time. This is the 6th time we have seen this since this patch. It's wrong. Why must VI constantly "nerf" classes that are already challanged enough. Clerics have only one strong point, their grouping capability. Now VI is intruding upon that. I know many people tire of the constant "nerfing" of the classes. It is like VI does not want us to succeed at this game. Every time we turn around, our classes get weaker, and the mobs get stronger. What kind of brilliant mind thought up the idea of nerfing the monk's attack range? Come on! Now most monks cant even solo a greenie. How pathetic are you going to make it?<BR>BTW: Ice Comet will not create as much agro as Complete Healing now. It will not even pull the mob off of the cleric if you use it twice in a row. I find this to be disturbing. A mob will agro faster to healing power, rather then to someone that is dropping over 1k dmg on him in one shot.

</FONT><HR>As much as I despise the new hate list, it DOES make it a little more interesting... but I also DONT find DIEING very interesting.  Clerics wear plate, thats good... not that it does us any real good, if you wanna keep this hate list, let me take hits better.  The plate just makes us look cool, and even with the most uber 1hb I'm still gonna hit like a pansy!  I'm a lvl 39 cleric and it takes me 10mins to kill a lvl 15 monster!  I dont expect us to become tanks or anything close to it, but I think for this hate list to succeed it would be nice to be able to take just a couple more hits, instead of taking 2 hits and then hitting the ground =/ </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000074&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><br>This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/002305-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/002305.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/002305-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/002305-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/002305-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=002305&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=002305&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
