Now, go find Walnan. Walnan was apprenticed to a very powerful Mage. After her apprenticeship was complete, she wished to begin teaching other beings of Norrath. Even those who knew nothing of the art! I do not believe she was successful, though. Seek her out to further your tale.

If the truth of the elements is what you seek then the Power of the Elements shall reveal all. Have you come to learn of Magi'kot? <P>You say, 'no'<P>Walnan says 'Only a few elementalists and followers outside our circle know what truly happened to Magi'kot. Even now, many are fearful to speak of his name. If you truly wish to continue, here is what you must do. Gather the Power of the Earth, warded by a fae creature. Then seek the Power of Fire, held by an elemental. Next you will need the Power of Wind, held by a twirling and prancing wanderer who has been corrupted. Finally, the Power of Water, held by a ravenous beast who is the minion of a fallen Sarnak.

Magi'kot was a powerful elementalist, able to control the power of the elemnts which surrounded him. He was not able to fully master the elements when I was learning from him, but soon after my departure I hear rumors that he was going arfter the Orb of Mastery. At the time, I did not feel he was ready to harness all the elements, but Magi'kot listend to no one. He was in search of power beyond any held by a mortal. Do you wish to hear more?<P>I say "I wish to hear more" <P>Akksstaff says 'Then bring me the torn pages of mastery, there are four pages that can be found upon the women in this keep, though have a care, Najena's followers guard her treasure carefully , and delight in punishing tresspassers.<P>[center]      <I>      [u]What you need to give him[/u]</I>[/center]<BR>(1)Torn Water Mastery Page(Najena)<BR>(2)Torn Earth Mastery Page(Najena)<BR>(3)Torn Air Mastery Page(Najena)<BR>(4)Torn Fire Mastery Page(Najena)<P><BR>[center]      <B>      Fire Orb</B>[/center]<BR>[center]      <I>      NPC: Jennus Lyklobar</I>[/center]<BR>[center]      <I>      Location: Skyfire(west wall)</I>[/center]<BR>[center]      <I>      [u]When Hailed[/u]</I>[/center]<P>You say, 'hail Jennus Lyklobar'<P>Jennus Lyklobar says 'Hello and well met, Nemesisxx !

I surround myself with fire, I bathe in fire, I consume fire, I am the Master of Fire!  Hahahaha, but I digress.  Have you come for the element of Fire, seeking to fall to the same fate as Trilith Magi'kot? <P>You say, 'i have come for the element of fire'<P>Jennus Lyklobar says 'The Element of Fire I can provide you, but you must prove you are able to contain its power.  Bring me the Torch of the Elements now kept by a doomed lord of merchants, the burning embers from a notable member of wurmkind who can be found a short journey from here and a blazing wand, which you  should be familiar with.  And you must surrender the tome Rykas gave you.

What? Oh, you speak so fast, it took me a moment. I have become used to the slow and stately conversation the Earth holds, where a thought can span aeons. I am the Master of Earth, you know. Though I'm usually too humble to say this, that makes me the most powerful mortal in Norrath, as everyone knows that Earth is the only REAL Element, all else must give way before its power. Water is absorbed by it, Air is ignored by it, and Fire is contained in it. But you know all these things, I am sure. Are you interested in obtaining the Element of Earth? I know Magi'kot was, but we know what happened to him, don't we? <P>You say, 'I am interested in obtaining the Element of earth'<P>Tiblner Milnik says 'Combining the following items can bring the Element of Earth together. Obtain the Staff of Elemental Mastery:Earth, held by the minions of the Prince of Hate, The Dirt of Underfoot found on Slix something or the other, and of course, I shall need the Broom of Trilon and the Shovel of Ponz.

I am Jinalis, as you know. I imagine you want to control the Elements. The Element of Water, which I possess, is the most powerful of the Elements. With it you can control the water which falls from the Air, erodes the Earth, and extinguishes Fire. It is a pity you do not focus on the Prime Element, but if you wish to follow that fool Magi'kot to your doom, I will not stop you. Bring me the Staff of Elemental Mastery:Water held by the last of the Kedge, the Tears of Erolisi held by a dirty and rotten officer across the Blessed Deep, and finally, the Rain of Karana, found on a mighty Giant in, where else, the Karanas. <P>[center]      <I>      [u]What you need to give him[/u]</I>[/center]<BR>(1)Water Staff(Phingel in Kedge)<BR>(2)Tears of Erolisi(Captain rottgrime in Overthere Outpost)<BR>(3)Rain of Karana(Tarbul Earthstrider in East Karana)<P>[center]      <B>      Air Orb</B>[/center]<BR>[center]      <I>      NPC: Kihun Solstin</I>[/center]<BR>[center]      <I>      Location: Air Plane</I>[/center]<BR>[center]      <I>      [u]When Hailed[/u]</I>[/center]<BR>You say, 'hail Kihun Solstin'<BR>Kihun Solstin says 'So, you have made it this far. I am Kihun Solstin, the Master of Wind. I control the unfettered Element like none other. As you should have learned, Air is the most potent of Elements. It fuels Fire, Water is comprised of it, and Earth cannot restrain it. Knowing this, do you seek the Element of Wind? <P>You say, 'I seek the Element of Wind'<P>Kihun Solstin says 'I will test you then.

</FONT><HR>I posted this a while back, but it seemed to get lost in the shuffle. Burning embers come from a "notable member of wurmkind". Has anyone tried talking to/killed Lord Lyfyx of Burwood in the Temple of Ro. His title "Lord" makes him notable. He is a wurm illusioned to be a High-elf, if you've ever done the Wurmslayer quest you know what I mean. He is the one you get the Xyfyl scale for that quest from. He is also located in the Mage quest area in the Temple. I have tried to talk to him, and other that saying his name backwards, I get nothing. I am only level 46, and he, like some others I've heard of, may only respond if your level 50+. He seems way to obvious to be the holder of the embers to be dismissed without looking into. Perhaps he has a quest for them, perhaps he just needs to be killed. He conned blue to me, like everything else but the Genie in the zone. The dragons aren't dropping the embers, they have been killed too many times for them not to have been found.<P>Just my 2cp's<P>Sivitri<BR>46th level Mage<BR>The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=127&topic=000058.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=Class+Super+Items&TopicSubject=Magician+Quest+-+Part+3+(Compilation)">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>There's two ways we can be going about this. The first, and most likely, IMHO, is that the quest is broken and the items we can't track down simply aren't dropping. I don't think i'm the only one who laughed when Abashi/Gordo posted that the Epic Quests were tested "extensively" (or something like that, I can't remember the *exact* word he used at the time) by the Verant QA (Quality Assurance) Dept. It's common knowledge there is no such thing at Verant - the players are the QA Dept. So, I won't die of shock if they do announce the quest has been broken, or even if the items suddenly begin dropping off of enemies we've all killed a hundred times already. <P>The second theory is that the items ARE dropping, but are *extremely* rare, or off of a triggered spawn we somehow haven't found across 30-something servers. I'm going to just do as much as is currently possible, as that in itself is quite a daunting task, and wait until the next patch before risking my life in The Hole again trying to get the Dirt that isn't dropping.<P>-----------<BR>Saracen<BR>51 Mage<BR>Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=127&topic=000058.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=Class+Super+Items&TopicSubject=Magician+Quest+-+Part+3+(Compilation)">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Esther finally answered the bug-thread on the Binder. She says that ALL data from test bla bla will be exported in next patch bla bla, indirectly saying that whatever was NOT put live before, will for SURE be now.<P>To me that sounds like "Verant bows its head in shame admitting yet another flawy export of quest items". <P>Ashreal : You should try agin after the next major patch, which I believe is very soon(?)<P>Nevex : Come on, if you dont share, how can mages solve the quest. You cant hide behind that "I wont tell cause I may be wrong". Thats what they say in very bad criminal stories you know. "Aww I have a suspicion, cant reveal it until I know more". Next day, you find the fellow dead and all that  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/biggrin.gif"><P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=127&topic=000058.cgi&ReplyNum=000021&forum=Class+Super+Items&TopicSubject=Magician+Quest+-+Part+3+(Compilation)">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">
