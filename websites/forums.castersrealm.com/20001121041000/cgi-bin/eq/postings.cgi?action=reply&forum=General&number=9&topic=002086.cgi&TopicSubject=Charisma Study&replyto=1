[B]And now think of the fact that most players have 120 or higher MR on coin only servers   :(

By the way, I believe that you get 5 MR penalty or bonus per level difference, so in this case your test subject has -15 MR because you are 3 levels higher. So imagine that if in PvP someone is 6 level higher (happens often) has greater shielding on and an innate MR of 25. You can't hit them its as simple as that, they do not even have to wear MR equipment.

Nice test by the way! Can you do some testing with the same test subject (and the same levels) if he has more MR?

I wonder if the PvP and PvE resist rates are the same, for example in tashania you have different rates (-70 for MOBs and -30 for players).

Just like the DD and dot damage was reduced by 30% in PvP. These are only rumours though, so I don't know which is true. My guess is that you are indeed right that looks the most logical to me.<P>(There are many people that still buy wis gear for their jewelry, and people that buy dex gear for their channeling. These rumors will never die out, so maybe what I have heard is just like this.)<P>Anyways, a very interesting test. I am very curious by how much a cha higher then 200 makes a difference, whether the higher level mes spells (enthrall etc.) have different resist rates and how the situation is for 100+ MR, and how GoK is resisted. That could be a lot of tests though  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/frown.gif"><P>It is quite easy to get to 100+ MR, just get greater shielding, your innate MR, and your MR buffs on and a tranix crown.
