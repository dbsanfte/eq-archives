Cool premise, dark and full of rage  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/sb/forums/smile.gif"> and some really unique and fun powers.<BR>EQ just made them the King soloers which at level 50+ is so boring anyway it doesnt matter.<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D1BD92"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Mr. H</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Just read on the SQ offical FAQ that Necros will be in SB</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E0D7BA"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Zincubus Tinkerslayyer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Im sorry, from what i can tell this game is going to be a literal waste of time, from what i can tell its going to be way more detailed then everquest, dont get me wrong that isnt bad... if you have 24 hours of each day of your life to waste, everquest consumes a lot of time, and everyone says it sucks, but thats really all a game is for , is to "lose" your real life for a period of time go in there and have fun, if youve ever played a eq char to a high level, you would know what its like, people dont ***** about how omg necros are so rigged, or look at that guy, it must have been his first char hes a human wizard :P, they just go in and have some fun... This game sounds more like, get to high level, have a bunch of people come and gank you, you get pissed, irratated and it doesnt become fun anymore, you could relate this to dieing in eq, or being pked in what used to be uo(i no longer consider uo a game.. heh)... it sucks, this game sounds like its obviously going to offer these same kind of bull**** pain in the ass things, that really make a game fun if you think about it, if there were no pks in what used to be uo, the game would be to easy i mean the monsters used to be freakin blockheads that ran at like 2cm/hr ... what fun is that, PvP is definetely not a strongpoint of uo, yet people OFTEN criticize it on this... the game wasnt designed for it, some classes are just more powerful up front then others, what often comes to mind is a necromancer... "we" (yes i am one) are what the tank mages in uo were, nobody WANTS to suck... and people by general preference want to be the most powerful they can be ( the general gaming populace realistically is gank your ass and run, type of people, why do you think there are so many pks :P everyone wants to piss the farthest), so in conclusion i doubt this game will be any different from UO or EQ, people will think its the best thing in the world for about 2 years, then something new will come out and bam, there on it like **** on flies, probably because they want a fresh start and the games getting to the end of its "life" (at which point everyone is 4x gm plus, or 50+ etc...) OR this game will flop like a fish (asherons call comes to mind)... <BR>Zincubus Tinkerslayyer<BR>  -51st necromancer (im better than u are<g>)<BR>    "I dont hate gnomes, they just dont like me"</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D1BD92"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Morello</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The fact that you can call EQ better than UO (even for all its faults) surprises me. The AI in EQ is much better? The PvP? Bah.<P>You sound like one of those players (maybe you're not, by I get this impression) that gets PK'd and then asks a GM to get his stuff back, or wants things nerfed all the time. If this is the case, then you're absolutely right -- Shadowbane probably will be a waste of your time. However, you can level for days playing RoK, or go play UO2, it'll be much more friendly to protect you from big, bad players. Just a suggestion.<P>Morello</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E0D7BA"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">eqfan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">IMHO, I think the classes in eq are excellently balanced.  When people say, "hobbibly unbalanced" what the hell are you talking about?  Do you mean PvP? Because there is no unbeatable PvP class, you might say necro, but Im under the impression that a cleric can smoke a necro (spook dead, dismiss magic, cure poison & disease, root, byebye necro).  a druid and necro better than others at Pvp? well DUH, theyre 'solo' classes, what do you expect? but they definitly arent unbeatable.<P>Just my opinion.<P>btw, <BR>I hope SB keeps this interesting aspect, where one class may be better suited in PvP against another class. (btw warriors 'suck' in PvP cuz they are key in groups, less mana downtime)</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D1BD92"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Gkarn_Kuthor</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I asked the same thing about this game, Will a Mage be alot more powerful than a Warrior class. The asnswer was no. All classes will be the same, that means if a warrior and a necro get into a fight, the better player would win. And since i am a Magician on Bert on EQ, this makes me happy. Since i killed a 20th level Warrior because, it took 20 minutes for me to heal if i soloed. If i could have alot less downtime in EQ with a warrior, i would still be one. But i also like the Magician class.<P>This game will be good, because you will have no choice but to group. And the idea of having or being in a Army that is about to take over a castle, thrills me.<P>This will be a game of wait and see also. But what i have heard fromt he Dev team, sounds good. Now i would like them to pull it off.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E0D7BA"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Morello</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Remember something else:<P>The balance is much more geared towards GvG -- or group vs group combat than PvP combat.

Well being a 35th Level Magician on EQ. I have to hear all about the whining that other players do about pets.<P>Magician have to ***** that Necro pets are too powerful. Necros complain that Magicians get too many pets and they dont.<P>Wizards for crying out loud, always complain about Magicians getting good direct damage spells and the pets.<P>NOT WORTH IT. <P>So hopefully this will not be a frag fest either. I mean i could smoke ( me now) any character with this Magician at my level or 2 levels above me. I whiped a 40th level shaman with my 35th Magician. And we both had pets.<BR>If he didnt have his pet, it would have been worse.<P>Pets bring a unfair advantage to a class. Having a pet would make everyone want to be that class, especially in a PVP game.<P>Then there goes the game.<P>I want this game to be a team game. Where compainionship is #1. And also want a game that can be soloed. But the much harder stuff would be teamed. Like taking a castle. But say if i had only 20 minutes to play, i could solo and just get off.<P>If you can make everyone happy (AND YOU CAN).<BR>Then we really would have the best times of our lives.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E0D7BA"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">drekken-x</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">i play dungens and dragons and theres nothin like killin towns people when ur board there all lvl 0 and easy 2 kill. i dont know y but its great easpeacialy cuz i play a mage i was wondering if u could kill towns people and what the ai would b like (hopefully not like eq).</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></td></tr></table>
