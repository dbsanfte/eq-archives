Variant,  you just lost the support of 2 more players after your Senior GM's practices today.  I have played your game since beta, being a ex-cyber cafe owner since 1996, I had the fortune to play often.  My wife started playing in April of 2000 (note this date) and whe loved the game for its artwork and wonderful sounds of the beach.  She was known by many as Managirl Beachbum.  She refused to get help from her much higher level husband, that was just her.  <P>Everyone knew her in Oasis, for she pretty much would never live the place, she called it home.  She did however move to gain more experience, she really did care about EXP though.  She is a busy gal in RL and a few hrs here and there was her time to relax, enjoy the sounds and beach in Oasis, that was teh only reason she played really.  She ventured off to Lake of Ill Omen and made 25 last night, she was very excited.  But all must come to an end I guess in this "world"  that will never seem to be "Ours".  The Senior GM of Drinal (I will not mention his name, but it starts with a "V') come to her as she is in a Group.  Tells my wife "hi, you must change your name"  my wife does not understand, thanks it is a joke.  He tell her it is a Violation of the Naming Policy?  Not being an everyday gamer, she does not understand.  He tells her to "change it now please"  She asks "why, this has been my name for almost a year sir"  He does tell her again "I do not make the rules"  in 3 minutes, my wifes character is Named Matemp", she breaks down in tears.  <P>This was more than a game to my wife, it was her time to relax.  I have seen names in this game that violated sex, religion and race, but Managirl must go.  No warning since she created this second skin in April, all gone in  a 10 minute conversation.<P>I am done everyone, I have such a horrible taste in my mouth seeing my wife cry after a Senior GM using this so called "Naming Policy" to upset my wife so for no reason at all.  I am done with your police tactics in game that make us all, your paying cusmtomers, walk on egg-shells.  I am done.  <P>You expand on this, telling us what we gather, quest and camp for in game "is not ours, but yours"  your "intellectual property".  <P>I owned a cyber-cafe, 4 years Variant.  That is a LOT of gamers I have personal contact with.  They all LOVED my wife and believe me, they will not be happy with your actions.  <P>I bid everyone a good Night.  Play fair in game and in life....

EQGirl2000, <P>Interesting name for a married man, by the way...I'm sorry your wife got so upset that she broke down and cried when her character's name was changed.  I truly don't like any person to be emotionally hurt.  Even so, I have to ask two questions:<P>1.  Did either of you ever read the EverQuest rules?  The naming policy is fairly clear.  I cut and pasted the policy below:<P><B> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Naming Policy <BR>Character Naming Policy <P>Character names in EverQuest should reflect the genre of the game.  Original, high-fantasy names are desired. These guidelines apply both to first names and to surnames, and also to the combination of first name and surname. (For example, Luke and Skywalker are acceptable names, but Luke Skywalker is not.)</B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Right here, your wife encounters the first problem.  ManaGirl Beachbum is not a high-fantasy name nor in the genre Verant is trying to produce.<P><B> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>The following types of names are unacceptable and are listed in order from the worst to the least offensive:<P>1. Vile, profane, rude, or racist names including common swear words, anatomical references, racial slurs, and homonyms of these words. <BR>2. Combinations of words that produce an offensive result (e.g. Hugeaz, TugMcgroin). <BR>3. Names of religious, occult, or significant historic origin (e.g. Jesus, Allah, Satan, Stalin). <BR>4. Copyrighted or trademarked names of products, characters, services, or concepts (e.g. Drizzt, Marlboro, Sony). <BR>5. Non-fantasy names from popular media (e.g. Rambo, Darthvader). <BR>6. Common words and phrases that would not be found in the place and time setting of the game (e.g. Switchblade, Phaser, Toaster, Cannabis, Sloegin). <BR>7. Proper names from EverQuest (e.g. Rathe, Karana). This also includes any name of a significant EverQuest NPC (e.g. Dorn, Trumpy, Karn). <BR>8. The names of senior Customer Support Representatives or employees of Verant Interactive or Sony Online Entertainment (e.g. Aradune, Solist, Rhystan) <BR>9. Names chosen with the intent or possessed with the effect of harming the reputation of a player or Customer Service Representative. <BR>10. Names containing titles within them, such as, but not limited to: The, Lord, Lady, Master, King, Knight, Sir, Father (e.g. Sirtallon, Lordeagle, Mothermaggy). <BR>11. Names that contain sentences, phrases, or more than two words. (Ikillorcs, Ontop, and Petcarbob, Diediedie) Descriptive compound words are allowed, especially in surnames (e.g. Treehugger, Giantslayer) <BR>12. Popular and easily recognized names from existing media (e.g. Merlin, Gandalf, Belgerath, Tanis). <BR>13. Names where the combination of the first and last name form a phrase or violate a previous rule (e.g. Crymea River, Bran Muffin, Story Thyme) </B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>What probably happened is that someone /petioned the name as inappropriate to the genre.  Once that happens, the GM has to evaluate it.  If it appears to be a clear violation, they have to change it.  For violations of #1 and #2, they change it immediately without even telling the player first.  For all others, they contact the player, let them know it needs to be changed, and ask them to choose something else.  It would have been nice if the GM would have given your wife 24 hours to choose a new name (that seems a reasonable amount of time), and the few minutes seems pretty hasty and insensitive.  However, based on it being changed to "Named Matemp", it's obvious that it IS a temporary name and that she can still choose another.<P>The other question I wanted to ask is whether your wife is having some other issues that need attention?  If a character name change could reduce her to tears, perhaps it's merely a symptom of other important factors in her life.  As a loving husband, you can help her find out what those issues are and how to best address them.<P>Good luck!

I don't think the name should have been changed.  <P>It is quite appropriate for Verant to want to remove names that are offensive.  No one would argue with that although the judgement of what is offensive or not is important.<P>How does Verant expect people who live, work, and play in RL to name their characters?  They are going to use names that blend fantasy with RL and why not?!  Who wants a name from the random generator that makes no freakin sense?  If it is hard for OTHERS to remember it makes getting into groups and even basic communication a real pain.  "Managirl" is easy to remember and isn't offensive of otherwise unsightly.  I feel she should have been allowed to keep it.<BR>

I think Managirl was a pretty lame name for a role playing game. If there is anything i would like to praise Verant for it is their name generator, and their enforcement of sticking to fantasy names. I think they did the right decition in changing the name. <P>Your wife must be very sensitive to break down from such a trivial trauma as having a character name changed.

In my opinion her name should not have been forcefully changed. Personally I see nothing wrong with the name, or how it violates any of EQ naming policies. I can also understand how your wife would be so upset. If i was ever to lose Wildkarrde I would be unhappy to say the least. EQ screwed up on this one......

Agree that a forced name change would be a hassle.  Disagree that you have any real rights concerning keeping particular name - if you had picked a more anonymous fantasy name then you would have had no risk of a forced change twenty levels later.  If you have to quit as a protest then so be it.  Don't think that the general population will miss you for more than the shortest period of time so it's really just you that will be affected in the end.  Weigh the "insult" versus your enjoyment of the game and good luck in whatever you decide.

Name changes are rarely made unless the name is petitioned.  Once petitioned a paper trail is created and the rules must be enforced.  Perhaps you should have advised her that the name was iffy at best and that she was taking the risk of something just like this occuring.  A little common sense would have saved you a lot of heart ache.

One of my names in EQ  *WAS*  Abiz. What is wrong with Abiz, I mean, it's perfectly harmless. If anything they shuld have changed my lastname, NOT my first. Abiz Mal was the coolest name for an Erudite Necro, of course, now his old name descibes EQ customer service.<P>My girlfriend made a wizard named Opti, and we married, so we WERE Abiz Mal, and Opti Mal. We were thinking about having a daughter: Anni Mal. However, the GM's have shattered my dreams of having a second, dream family ingame. *sobs*<P>[/sarcasm]

Managirl? whats wrong with that?<BR>wtf is wrong with Verant. I have seen names out there that are lame and stupid. that are more appropriatly titles rather than actually names. Names like bigbasher and such are not names they are titles. who cares about a name like managirl. i think its unique and not offensive or anything. i think verant should have given her a break. i say shame on verant.

well i think its a shame that she had her name changed like that and i would be a little mad if they went and changed my name... my friend had his name changed when he was lvl 52... i mean come on... that just sucks... <BR>think about it... playing a game for 2 years with this name and meeting lots of people that know you as that... now changing that name more or less kills that charactar because lets face it... other than names, every erudite mage is the same as the next erudite mage... and every de necro is just another de necro... the names were what makes you different...<BR>but.. managirl? ... umm no offense but managirl?

Well name changes happen.  But my 2 cents is at least the GM could have given her a reason for changing her name other than "You have 2 minutes".  And personally I don't see where her name violated policy.  (Managirl Beachbum is not that inconcievable) but, on the other side of the argument, if that's all it takes to make you quit the game then you weren't very dedicated to begin with.  It's not like they took away your best melee weapon or banned you from the game.  I mean yeah it sucks that your name was changed and done in a rather rude manner but it's still the same character if you love the game as much as this guy and his wife profess then get over it and keep enjoying the game.  If it stresses you out that much then I think you're doing the right thing by finding some other forms of entertainment.

I think it's because Verant sucks!  Verant needs to take ****ing chill pill sometimes and realize that ITS A ****ING GAME.  I have had GMs tell me to watch my language...in tells!  No one could hear me except the player I was talking to...and we were just discussing stuff and sprinkling in cuss words.  Verant Needs settle down and learn a lesson from Blizzard Entertainment-its ok to cuss, name your char big**** asswipe, and buy stuff off of ebay if you are inclined to do so.

I feel for Managirl, but I don't see it as something to quit over.  She can still sit and relax at the beach in OOT or Oasis or wherever she choses with Snarkli Nippalien or something that makes absolutely no sense.  The sounds and the graphics didn't change, and I sure don't spend most of my time looking at my name.  <P><P>------------------<BR>Docichy 52nd God of mind games
