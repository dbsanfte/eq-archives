<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL"> [QUOTE]Originally posted by Death:
[b]You havent mentioned your level ranges, but I assume they are fairly low if your considering taking on a Noob.

At low levels the Shaman can have a dramatic influence on a group with the drowsy and malise lines.  Since the wizard and druid will mostly not be using magic based offensive spells the enchanter Tashan line is relatively useless.

As you progress the Enchanter will get the ability to slow almost as good as a shaman and almost all enchanter buffs are great, unlike shaman buffs.

The druid can function as the only healer in a group at 50+ if and only if there is a good enchanter in the group.  I've done it before with my druid and shaman, many times.

You can tell the quality of a class based on how many duplicates you wouldnt mind in your group.  Two or more enchanters wouldnt be stepping all over eachothers feet.  They have more quality spells than one enchanter can handle in a group.  Two enchanters makes a Shaman very obsolete.

Dont get ****ty, its plain reality.  You can close your eyes to the truth but our spells just dont cut it.  The only thing that hasnt made us extinct is the fact that Enchanters are harder to level up and thus fewer of them get through the ranks.  But breeze has changes that.

Look at the numbers on new unsplit servers as to the player populations.  Very few hybrids, very few shaman.  Lots of druids, lots of enchanters, lots of clerics, warriors and rogues.

The older servers are congested with people that have spent too much time invested in their primary characters to change to something better.

What would I add to your group?  If he wants a melee character then it should be one that will eventually gets disciplines, they make the spell casting of hybrids look like a joke in comparison.

I'd say a Halfling Rogue since he will add skills you cant duplicate, like lock picking, scouting and the massive damage they inflict with backstabbing.  Halflings level the fastest and their racial abilities make it easier for them to hide and sneak at low levels.

If you didnt have an enchanter then a class that could FD would be very handy.  It would have to be a monk since they get disciplines, SK damage output is laughable at high levels.

If you want another caster then I would definitely add in a Necromancer.  Their ability to solo is only a fraction of their talents.

In a group they are a wonderful addition.  My Erudite Necro can dump vast amounts of mana onto a cleric or enchanter, heal in a pinch and have destructive dots.

Most importantly is their ability to mes those mobs off the enchanter, its often the difference between life and death for the group... except the necro of course, they have more escape routes than Houdini   ;)[/b][/QUOTE]

HA Ha Ha. Im sorry, but the only use that necro has for the group is Corpse recovery. Aye you may fall into a trap thinking that just because necro is great for solo he is great for evrything. As u said that 2 enchanters make shaman obsolite, because of slows and buffs, they why dont they make screaming terror obsolite? Necro is great to have outside, because of his snare/fear combo, but theat is what makes the great for solo. Well try to fear something in dungeon, i'll how fast your group kicks you out. And im sorry i've yet to see necro healing someone..... dont forget that if you use lich, u will be asking dru or shaman for regen to keep your own HP's. 
Yes necro has good dots, but in the group they are waste of mana (except for darkness line, i.e necro snare), the mob will be most likely dead before your dots even do half a damage. The only good asset that necro brings to a GROUR is his pet,who at the higher level can outdamade hybrids, but is very hard to controll, espacially with enchanter trying to mezz multiple mobs. That is why most group prefer to get shaman. 
And if you had an opportunity do get to higher levels, sometimes NO SLOWER means NO GROUP espacially in the places with a hard hitting mobs, thats why shamans have no problem finding group in karnors, sebillis, guk, sol b. Why have 2 enchanters which is redundant and unnesessary, when u can have shamn slowing(better slow than chanter, and do stat buffs) and chanter save mana for mess/speed. </TEXTAREA>
