[b]
(1) Corven your a jack ass, 

(2) you take a person's view and you slaughter it just because you believe differently.  Silent Advice has some good points and from your responses I see that you are exactly the kind of person that he was talking about... the one that is to high level to get exp from the mobs he is farming and doesn't care about those that could get the exp.  

(3) Since your so inclined to voice your own idiotic opinion I think I will at least voice mine with a little more backing to why I think as I do, not like you thinking it’s right and that being a good enough excuse.

(4) 1)For starters this game has been out for over a year now and everyone should be able to twink to an extent meaning they have the means to do so if they choose to so why would someone be jealous if they were against it? It's not like most people can't twink. Second, some people like the role-play aspect of EQ and to not twink makes it that more of a challenge to them in some ways.

(5) 2) We'll skip this one, it's about one's preference and I really don't want to get into a "I said I like it so it's ok to do" argument with you.

(6) 3) This is by far anything but jealousy from my standpoint. You are so close-minded you can't see the real reason why someone would be upset about this. You take it for jealousy but you should be looking at it from a lower level persons view instead of the higher levels. The reason I can see Silent Advice having a problem with this is that a high level that doesn't (as he initially said) get exp from the mobs takes away from a group that can be getting exp and earning an item instead of buying it from high levels all the time. I can see this as being true becuase I enjoy an item more if I earned it by killing the monster for it not buying it from a high level.

(7) 4) You're an idiot on this one, you are telling someone what he or she is feeling. Just because he or she doesn't like it cause of some bad experiences. I don't have much to say except grow up and realize that you can't determine what other's think.

(8) 5) Just because he or she changed his or her view at higher level makes you admire him or her? That's the crapiest excuse to admire someone expecially when your ripping his or her post from limb to limb up to that point.

(9) Once again you're a jackass. You seriously thinnk a group of level 30s can out damgage a 50-55 level druid? That's the stupidest thing I have ever heard. Compete with a high level that can do over half damage to something your level in one spell. I have seen a high level druid take out a clockwork with two spells that was farming Sol A and you think my group of three 38s could out damage her? your dilusional.

(10) The play nice rules do help in most instances but not in all so you can't always fall back on them. From personal experiences your lucky to find a farmer that even cares if you want to share the spawn or not, they may say yes but they won't let you attack the named mob before they get the kill, most are not afraid of getting in trouble by GMs or Guides.

(11) Damn I hate when people try and tell others how to think. If i came off sounding that way then I am sorry but knock off the tearing into someone's thread just cause you don't agree with them and I will stop as well. Everyone has a choice whether or not to twink and it is just that... their choice, whether you think they are idiots for not twinking or for twinking is your opinion. Let it go and don't worry about what others do with their characters and you will have more fun in the game instead of complaining about everyother twinked out player runs by.
[/b][/QUOTE]

1) You call me this, however, you are the one slandering my name when all I'm doing is defending my position. I wonder who this name really belongs to? Hmmmm!

2) I did not slaughter his view, I just pointed out where his statement of his view was inaccurate. I did say that he had every right not to like this though and that until the game is changed that it was what everyone has to put up with. And I do not FARM. I do insert myself into situations where I can get experience. And as to being too high in level, you show that you have not fully read this whole post and your lack of reading again entitles you to the name you called me. My highest character is only level 32 and I no longer play him anymore. Or is it that you are such a newbie that 32 is an unreachable level for you?

3) I am inclined to voice my opinion which I have the right to do. Just as you have the right to voice your opinion. This is one of the reasons for this board, so people can post their opinions on a subject--so long as they remain civil. Otherwise you risk the auditors of this board removing your opinion and then you might as well have said nothing.

4)I disagree with the statement that everyone has this ability. I have personally met several people within the last few weeks that are on their very first character and still in their 20's or less. I do agree with the thought that others shouldn't be jealous because they don't have what others do. As to your second point here, I agree that some choose to play this way and they have every right to do so. I myself am contemplating starting completely over on the new server.

5) At least here you agree that it falls down to what a person chooses to do with his/her time.

6) First of all, I am considered a low level as far as these threads are concerned. This you would know if you had READ the whole thread. As far as the lack of experience a high level gets, it doesn't matter because he is getting the loot he is going after. Any GM will tell you that any level character has the right to hunt any other level character if they so choose. This is why many necros and sk's hunt low skels for their bone chips that they need for their pets. Again, if he wants an equal turn at the mobs--INVOKE THE PNP RULES---they do work.

7) Again, if you are angry that someone is getting something that you should "rightfully" be getting in their stead, then that is JEALOUSY. Don't Bill Clinton this thought pattern. Meaning don't say something is other than what it really is. Bill Clinton REALLY had sex with Monica and Silent Advice REALLY is jealous because someone is camping where he wants to camp.

8) My admiration of someone can be stated even when I do not agree with what they are saying. Reminds me of what someone once told me: Stand up for your beliefs! You may be right. You may be wrong. But at least you stand for something!

9) Again with the namecalling? And you say that I need to grow up! What I said was that any player can invoke the PNP rules and have an equal turn at the mob in demand. Most players at a camp will not want to relinquish an equal turn to you (Note: you have to ask for the turn nicely before you can call a GM). If they say yes, then all is well--no GM needed. If they say no, then call a GM and he/she will determine an equal split according to the number of groups that are at the spawn. By compete, I mean an equal share at the spawn--refer to above PNP situation.

10) But you say: what if a high level refuses to acknowledge the PNP rules and takes out the kill anyway. a) They may suffer banishment if not a strong reprimand (I have personally seen them reprimanded for this). b) Some GMs stick around after the decision to see how the upperlevels are going to act when the spawn comes and if they are going to rightfully share the spawn. c) If they do wrongfully killsteal the mob and loot the item, they not only risk the above but are guaranteed to lose the loot as well as their character if they are not careful. Most are not afraid of consulting a GM because the others who were wronged do not know the PNP rules and care not to learn them. When they don't know them, then they can't use them in the given situations where they need them.

11) If you hate others telling someone how to think, then why do YOU do the same thing? (A bit of hippocrisy perhaps) And as to tearing into someone else's thread as you so aptly put it, you should READ the entire post to know how this post progressed. If you do ACTUALLY read it, then you will know that I started my opinion on this post defending the individual's right to play their game any way they want to play it--whether they want to twink or not. I just happen to enjoy twinking myself. Also I have had to revert to answering posts after this fashion due to the fact that all of my posts have been torn into by another poster. And I am not worried about other people's characters and how they choose to play them, essentially I am defending their right to do so against those who don't want twinkies to be able to twink their characters and would prefer everything to be no-drop instead. The problem with this is that if everything were no drop--then the class specific items would be unattainable because it would require a balanced group to hold the camp and the only ones wanting to camp the item would be the class that the item is for.

In the end of it all, play your character the way you wanna play it. Don't climb all over someone because they wanna twink. If you can twink--then do so or dont so according to how you want to play.

Have fun with this one!

Corven
