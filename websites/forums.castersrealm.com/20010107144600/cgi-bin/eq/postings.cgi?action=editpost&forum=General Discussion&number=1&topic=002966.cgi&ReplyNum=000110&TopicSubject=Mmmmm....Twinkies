<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL"> [QUOTE]Originally posted by Prometheus:
[b]
(1) From your initial point of view (Me twink -you jealous) you then went to the more congenial (It's just my point of view - your's is equally valid) and returned to the confrontational (See above). 

(2) If you look hard at yourself you will find that you are probably guilty of that which you are accusing others - jealousy!

(3) Your defence is the best in the book -'Offence is the best form of Defence' by which I mean you use twinking to ensure no-one has a more impressive character than your own.

(4) The main problem with this defence is that with 300,000 players there is always someone better than you and thus your own lack of self-assuredness is converted into an outwardly aggressive persona (at least online!)

(5)This is NOT a flame but an observation of what appear to be your motives as to your gameplay and treatment of others (? in RL also?)

(6) As a psychiatrist please accept apologies if this is not the case and makes no sense to you.

(7) I do however get much more pleasure from the Role-Playing aspects of the game and enjoy interacting with others more than camping a spawn site (Boring, repetetive but good for getting 'just one more level')

(8) Finally, I am amazed how far this thread has run on and I am sure 'Chaos Theory' must have something to do with it!![/b][/QUOTE]

1) I'm not the initial one who said "me twink-you jealous". I do agree with this statement for the most part though. Also, you need to read the full post if you are to truly understand my point of view.

2) Of course I'm jealous of others in this game with better stuff than me---who wouldn't be? But, I don't get mad at them for having it. Instead, I work my own characters to the point where they too can enjoy these kind of toys.

3) No, I do not twink to ensure that no-one has a more impressive character than my own. However, I do twink to make an impressive character in my own eyes. I also like the ability to stand and fight when most others are forced to run. This is one of the main reasons I twink my character--Durability.

4) I admit that there are many many others out there with better equipment than mine---it always happens when there is no-drop equipment from the planes which can only be accessed after level 46. And if you care to check these posts, I am not the aggressive one here, but simply defending my point of view from all the other aggressive posts.

5) This may not be a flame for you, but the next post stating that this post applied specifically to me turned this post into a flame against me. As far as in the game, you have the right to come and play with me anytime you feel like you want to. However, whether or not you get into my group, is entirely up to my group members which usually consist of my guildmates, people who are my friends and count me as their friend.

6) If you are truly a psychiatrist, then you should know that everyone is different. And even if something works for one person, doesn't mean it will work for another person.

7) I also enjoy the roleplaying aspect more than camping an item. I have only camped items a few times and do not personally believe in FARMING. This was one of the main reasons I informed people as to how they could insert themselves into a spawn.

8) One of the reasons why this thread has run so far is because I don't turn tail and run when someone flames me. Instead, I try to accurately defend my position on why I play my game the way I play it.

As I have said many times before, read the whole thread here before flaming me. If you do, I think you may change your mind about what I am saying. Midian did come around to agreeing with me after he was one of my staunchest opponents. Why? Because he found himself in a situation like what I was talking about and could now see what it was I was saying. Likewise, you will also someday come into one of these situations and think to yourself: "Now I know what he was talking about!", even if you still do not agree with me.
