I honestly don't see the problem of people selling items on EBay except 'farming.'  Which, I suppose is the reason why it was cut off the market.<P>However I point more strongly on the side of allowing auctions, especially of accounts.<P>I'm your average joe, working 40 hours a week monday-friday.  I get on average 3 hours of gameplay per 24 hour period.  This is gameplay in general, not just for everquest.  To show how casual I play, I have had a char since jan 11 2000 and he's lvl 23.  I don't play much, and when I do its in spurts.<P>Everquest, quite simply put, is NOT a game for the casual player.  It takes me one night to get re-supplied and move to a new location to exp at.  As a shammie, I do have SoW which helps to an extent but it doesn't help waiting 30 mins for a boat, running across multiple zones, zoning itself, etc.  Then I get to the destination, spend another 20 or so minutes looking for a group, finally get in a group and the exp is so lousy that it barely moves an inch.<P>I'm not complaining so much as just stating this is NOT a casual players game.  Having said that, I like being able to buy items from EBay.  People with a lot of time can sell items they acquire to people that can't spend all day and all night camping a mob that drops something you need.  As a person who works 40 hours a week, I can't spend 3 days straight camping a mob for something it might drop, with no guarantee.  <P>But for people who don't work, its an excellent opportunity to make extra cash.  Sony/Verant says the items belong to them.  I don't like this concept at all.  "We'll let you play our game, we'll set how the drops happen, we can control all aspects and there's nothing you can do about it and even though its on your character (which is ours) the eq which your character has still belongs to us even though you worked to get it."<P>Sounds like a piss-poor concept to me.  Monarchy at its best.  Its kind of like saying 'Yes we control you.'  I'm sorry but I pay them per month, I bought the damn game, I'm not breaking the license agreement because I'm not altering any of the coding...we can't set up our own servers, we HAVE to pay 10 a month to play this game online.  Yet Sony/Verant owns it all no matter what?<P>Ouch.  I'm just glad countries aren't run like this.  "You pay taxes, you can buy a new car, but it doesn't belong to you, it actually belongs to the person you bought it from!"<P>I know its a game, but for a game which involves such large amounts of time, people in the working world just don't always have the time to do some of these upper raids/camps.  I understand that farming is a problem and that these people are ruthless in the game on the most part and cause others to not have fun but that's only a small percentage of people who do it, not a majority.  <P>I really just don't like the way Sony/Verant can say 'No you can't sell items because they aren't yours.'  Well of course they aren't mine, its a damn game.  However with the hours spent getting these items...and I can sell them in GAME for plat cost, why can't I sell them to a bigger market online?  Do I have to sit in EC and yell over ooc 'selling 100 items send tells for what I'm selling?' or would it make more sense to use a resourse like the internet where you can reach more people?<P>Uebermann, if it makes sense people hate it =)<P>

You are not selling your time investment getting X so much as selling the time you saved someone else getting it. It's a subtle difference but relevant all the same since no one cares how long it took you, only how long it didn't take them. In other words the best you can say is that you are playing the game for them.<P>In that sense it is blatantly a silly practice to buy vitual items with real cash. Who in their right mind would pay someone to play a game for them? Fair enough, pay all you want for what you want but don't argue that it's a rational or sensible act. It isn't.<P>In any case, time selling is fooling no one when you think that you can justify breaking the EULA by saying it. If anything could be considered a misplaced mantra then this 'argument' would be it. It doesn't matter how many times it's repeated, it neither makes it true nor a valid excuse.<P>Yesferatu, almost correct that farming happens a lot anyway. I suppose it does happen but most of what you talk about is camping, not farming. When farming does happen it's because the game can be played that way in many instances. Notice I say that's how the game can be played (irrelevant wheteher you like or dislike the practice, point is you can do it under the right circumstances without breaking any rules). We're back to paying someone to play part of a game for you aren't we. Thing is, those people who farm for in-game reasons or gains 1) aren't breaking any agreements and 2) aren't as likely to be motivated to stay practically forever because they aren't getting paid to. By banning real money trading it may not stop the practice of farming but you cannot argue that it won't cut it down.<P>"It's just a game" is not a mantra nor misplaced. It's a fact, plain and simple. It doesn't matter how long you spend playing it, that fact will still remain. If you take EQ so seriously that you don't consider it a game any longer then you're in need of immediate psychiatric help. No insult, I'm being honest because it's just not rational behaviour.

Shakti, I advised you not to reply because I was sure you would make a fool of yourself.<P>I was correct.<P>Would you PLEASE explain to me where precisely I said you MUST ebay? I would like to know where you got this "knowledge" so that I can read the posts I didn't make, as well as the one I have. Also, your post cannot possibly be relevent when your stance on ebaying and all other aspects of EQ is neutral, if that is the case, you cannot have an opinion either way, and therefore your post would have no relevence to EQ at all. I also suggest reading other people's posts before stating that they cannot read, it would be a good idea, imho. If you think you are competent enough to reply to this, please go ask for an adults oppinion on your comprehension capibilities, just to make sure you don't make a fool of yourself again. Perhaps you can read, but are choosing not to, that is a rather bad decision you know.<P>Walks over next to Raz, and summons some cheese. Ahhhh, barbequed cheddar!<BR>Hmmm, I think we should step back, those flames are getting a little high.<P>------------------<BR>True power does not exist, for I have not yet shown it to you...

 <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Amber:<BR><B><P>In that sense it is blatantly a silly practice to buy vitual items with real cash. Who in their right mind would pay someone to play a game for them? Fair enough, pay all you want for what you want but don't argue that it's a rational or sensible act. It isn't.<P></B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>woah, get off the high horse!  Who are you to tell me what is sensible or not?  You may think its not, I may think its not, but what WE think doesn't mean its a truth.  People are allowed to have opinions.  Don't try to play it so that your opinions are correct.  You can state them but the attitude at which you just presented this note, is laughable.<P>Like I stated above, why is it so laughable?  Lets say I wanted a equip piece but I would have to call into work in order to camp successfully.  One day off of work is 89 dollars lost.  I can purchase the item online for 20 dollars.  Which is better?  Losing 20 dollars or losing 89 dollars?  Simple math says that losing 20 would be better than losing 89  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/wink.gif"><P>I'm not saying its morally correct to sell items on Ebay.  I'm saying I really don't see whats wrong with it.  Unless EQ comes out with another version of the game for casual players, I think that its nice to be able to buy items on line.  <P>Those who have the time to play for hours on end, more power to 'em.  Those of us who have jobs and can only play for certain few hours...why can't we have the same luxuries?  By your standards, we casual players would be forever condemned.  Never getting to go on big, long raids.  Never getting to camp FBSS or any other cool eq.  Yes I would love nothing more than sit at home all day and play EQ.  However that isn't an option for me.<P>Closing off the Ebay auction was a real blow to the casual player, plain and simple.  Whereas before, the casual player could semi-keep up equipment-wise, now they are blown away because they don't have time to sit online for hours on end.<P>Fair or not, don't care.  Just stating my opinion and I'm not cramming it down anyone's throat =)<P>Uebermann

/Flame on - beware, flame coming<P><BR>Jaquio -  I just cant sit back anymore. In several posts you keep spouting this CRAP that you would "break someones nose in real life", or you would do action X to person Y, blah blah. Ive tried not to get stuck in the same muck some of the people here are in, but its got to be said : You are a little punk, a childish little bugger with no concept of what you say.<P>Break someones nose for saying something to you? Anger management problem maybe? And you have NO idea who you are talking to when you say CHILDISH mess like this. Grow up, take some valium, get some values and drop that lamer line. You can always tell someone with an inferiority complex, they always have a line like this to say. Were you abused as a child? Feel the need to ACT bad? bah.<P><BR>Wax tadpole :<P>I have come to the conclusion that you are a waste of time. Here is exactly where you accuse me of ebaying, page 2 of posts, direct cut of your post :<P>"However, it does seem to be blatantly clear that you DO ebay things, otherwise you probably wouldn't have posted specifically to shoot down an anti-ebay argument, so I think you deserve all the posts about ebay being wrong ect."<P>What i dont get, is how you call me a fool when you are the one getting caught with egg on your face. So please, keep putting your own foot in your mouth. You have about as much sense as mr.break-your-nose-jaquio here.<P>Uebermann :<P>You make some pretty valid points. There has always been , and always will be a huge gulf between the hardcore, 14yr old all day gamer, and the casual player. All this talk of "hurting X, breaking Y, ruining Z" just passes right over the other PAYING CUSTOMERS, who are not treated equally. You are right about the camping thing, a large portion of the rather nice things in the game require days of camping to get the rare drop, off the rare spawn. How thats a fair shot to casual players escapes me as well, but eh, its their world.<P><BR>Starcoates :<P>"Are your trying to say that IF there wheren't an EULA it would be right to sell characters and stuff cause the people did work for their characters and stuff ???"<P>You missed EVERYTHING i said, all of it.<P>Just for you (sixth time for everyone now) :<P>SOME THINGS BEING SAID ABOUT THIS EBAY ISSUE ARE FOOLISH, SUCH AS THE "you didnt work for it" LINE.<P>If you cant understand what i said, im sorry, i cant help you. My stance has nothing to do with ebay, it has to do with the overall issue, which has become a droning, beast of a waste of space. I think some things that are being said ABOUT the issue are foolish.

Quote by Shokti:<P>Break someones nose for saying something to you? Anger management problem maybe? And you have NO idea who you are talking to when you say CHILDISH mess like this. Grow up, take some valium, get some values and drop that lamer line. You can always tell someone with an inferiority complex, they always have a line like this to say. Were you abused as a child? Feel the need to ACT bad? bah.<BR>---------------------------------------------<BR>Ok...  Let me try and explain this completely obvious concept.  You posted your opinion on this board.  I did not agree with your opinion.  Nowhere in my post did I make any inflamatory comments.  (Please go back and read them)  At least not until page 3 of the post, when I was, quite frankly sick of you using name calling as an attempt to debunk the obvious.  <P>The pattern that seems to be repeating itself on this forum thread is completely simple.  You believe one thing.  I believe the other.  However, you are being very rude and beligerant in the expresion of your opinion.  <P>Then, Rathtr1 jumps into the conversation and calls me an Idiot.  That is where the nose comment came into play.  I NEVER made a threat at him.  (If you read my post)  I simply stated that IF a person were to say that to my FACE, or in person...  The result would be a fist fight.  We all know that this is true.  Any one of us would throw a punch if a stranger started calling you names for doing something you were supposed to be doing anyway. (Agreeing or Disagreeing)  Any one of us knows that if WE were to say something like that to somebody else's face the same thing would happen.  This is not a bad thing.  If you are not willing to stand up for yourself, then you have a serious self esteam problem.<P>With that said...  I think it was completely obvious that the statment was not a THREAT, but rather it was my way of pointing out Rathr1's extreme cowardice.  This is not name calling as I explained the situation very adequetly.  This is not what I have seen from either of you.  The standard responce that I have seen from you is simply, 1 - A flame, 2 - A Sig...  For example:<BR>---------------------------------------------<BR>Quote Shakti:<P>Excellent smithy! keep proving that you are indeed the brilliant bad attitude person that you are!<BR>Such a poor concept of context, perhaps you should review the concept, and then apply that pathetic attitude of yours to learning its meaning.<BR>Trolled? <BR>I see. Anyone who posts something YOU dont like is a troll. Very interesting.<BR>I think its the other way around. Most people here are civilized, save you. Very interesting.<BR>Go elsewhere, sad individuals like you contribute nothing.<BR>---------------------------------------------<BR>Is there a point to this post?  Nope...  Just a flame...<BR>---------------------------------------------<BR>Quote Rathtr1:<P>And in reply to Jaquiro... your an idiot man, they arn't selling the items.. the items are still in EQ just under a different persons name.. it's not like he's actually BUYING the item.. he's buying the time it took for the other person to waste hours of his life getting the stupid thing.<BR>---------------------------------------------<BR>This may have been a reasonable post if he had left out the Idiot line.  Except for the fact that he's wrong.  If you are buying time and not an FBSS, you would not get an FBSS.  Since you are getting an FBSS, you are not buying time, your buying an FBSS which is against the rules.  Seems REALLY obvious to me.<BR>---------------------------------------------<BR>Quote Rathtr1:<P>Oh really? how did i undo an argument? at least i have an argument.. you simply try to argue a point that is not valid and has nothing to do with the actual problem... *shrugs*<BR>---------------------------------------------<BR>I guess Rathtr1 does not need to debunk anything.  We should just take his word that my point is irrelavant.  (He didn't even state either opinion)  <BR>---------------------------------------------<P>What would be considered name calling is to read something that you don't agree with and reply with, "Your a F@#$*%^ Idiot"  Without even including a rational desenting opinion.  <P>I will have you know that at no time while reading this post was I ever angry.  It is imposible for cowardice to anger me.  That's just the way I am.<P><BR>However, once again...  You have chosen to flame me instead of explaining the "Holes" in my opinion.  (Read the quote at the TOP of my post, or the whole message for that matter)<P>Let's be honest.  You had an opinion and stated it.  When we explained why we thought you were wrong, there was nothing that you could think of for a rebutle.  So instead, you have resorted to calling us "Children" and our ideas and opinions, "Hooplah."<P>This is inflamatory and does nothing to support your opinion.  If fact, all you have done is destroyed any relevant stance that you may have had by representing to us that you are not mature enough to hold any opinion that should matter to us.<P><BR>I think this reply has been long enough.  I will not go into the other people that you flamed in your most recent message.  The only reason that I ever came to this forum thread was because I cared about what was going on in reguards to Ebay and EQ.  It is obvious to me that you never wanted to talk about the EQ/eBay subject.  Instead your aim was simply to start a flame war.  The phrase, "You thrive on others misery" comes to mind...  You must understand by now that nobody that visits this forum takes any stock in what you say.  Not after your most recent display.  <P>Since it has become impossible to talk about eBay in this forum, I will not be reading this tread any longer.  EQ/eBay was the only thing I care about.  The fact that Rathtr1 and Shakti don't like me is more insignificant to me than the brand of Toilet paper I use.  So, if you want to flame and flame and flame, be my guest.  Nobody takes any stock in you anyway.<P>- Jaquio<BR>

Jaquio -<P>"At least not until page 3 of the post, when I was, quite frankly sick of you using name calling as an attempt to debunk the obvious. "<P>Name calling? uh no. What i DID do, was defend MYSELF from smithy, why not post HIS message to ME, before that. Oh, that would TOTALLY invalidate you post, cant do that.<BR>That ENTIRE post was to say mr.smithy had a really poor attitude, which he does.<P> His VERY FIRST post, called me an idiot, IN FACT, the VERY FIRST LINE of his first post said :<P>"What an idiot...<BR>EQ is a game. Football is also a game, when was the last time you seen a coach login to eBay and buy a touchdown?"<P>Tell me, mr.fist-fight, whats the problem here? EH???? I get called an idiot, ask the guy to go away, and *IM* the bad guy..bleah.<P>Holes in your argument? blah, there *IS* no argument. What argument CAN there be to my statement <P>"some things being said about the ebay issue are foolish, such as this you didnt work for it mess".<P>Explain it to me, mr.fist-fight, how you can say there is an argument to that?? EH?? You think everything said about ebay is just the absolute in universal truth, and is totally relavent, and will help in ANY way?? <P>HELLOOOO.. And the above is hole 1, me telling smithy to go away, after the VERY FIRST LINE, of his VERY FIRST POST, calls me an idiot. <P>And this next paragraph tells me exactly how old you are :<P>"I simply stated that IF a person were to say that to my FACE, or in person... The result would be a fist fight. We all know that this is true. Any one of us would throw a punch if a stranger started calling you names for doing something you were supposed to be doing anyway. (Agreeing or Disagreeing) Any one of us knows that if WE were to say something like that to somebody else's face the same thing would happen. This is not a bad thing. If you are not willing to stand up for yourself, then you have a serious self esteam problem."<P>You get into fist fights daily then eh? you DEFINATELY have an anger management problem, and it appears a lack of self-control as well.<P>"any one of us would throw a punch if a stranger started calling you names".  Uh no, sorry, thats what you do when your 8 years old maybe, not in the land of the grown ups. Its called self control, and maturity.<P>You equate lack of self-esteem with NOT getting into fist fights over the most trivial of things? Bloody hell, thats just  crazed, completely insane.

Originally posted by Uebermann:<BR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR> woah, get off the high horse!  Who are you to tell me what is sensible or not?  You may think its not, I may think its not, but what WE think doesn't mean its a truth.  People are allowed to have opinions.  Don't try to play it so that your opinions are correct.  You can state them but the attitude at which you just presented this note, is laughable.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>If you'd care to read you'll note that I said spend your money on what you like. Frankly I don't care, it's your money. However, it's still doesn't change the fact that you just wasted your cash if you spent it on hiring someone to play a game for you. It defeats the whole object of it BEING a game. You know, fun, relaxation and all that kind of thing.<P>Come on Mr Genius, I asked the question first so YOU answer, who in their right mind would pay someone to play a game for them? You cannot for one minute justify that paying someone else to have fun for you is sane. If these people do not find said part of the game enjoyable then why play it at all? Then it stops being a game for them and more of a chore. If that is true then again I rest my case because no sane person will continue to play a game that becomes so tedious.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Like I stated above, why is it so laughable?  Lets say I wanted a equip piece but I would have to call into work in order to camp successfully.  One day off of work is 89 dollars lost.  I can purchase the item online for 20 dollars.  Which is better?  Losing 20 dollars or losing 89 dollars?  Simple math says that losing 20 would be better than losing 89   <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/wink.gif"><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Are you mad? You sit there equating playing EQ with pulling sickies at work in an attempt to justify your position?! Can you say 'taking a game far too seriously'? I thought you could. Once more, I rest my case.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>I'm not saying its morally correct to sell items on Ebay.  I'm saying I really don't see whats wrong with it.  Unless EQ comes out with another version of the game for casual players, I think that its nice to be able to buy items on line. <HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>If the only way you can get your hands on items in game is to buy them offline then you are sad. If the reason you can't get these items is because your game time is limited then so what? It doesn't alter anything I just said and besides are you honestly telling me that ALL casual players Ebay? We must assume that they don't so therefore if one casual player can manage why can't the rest of you?<P>We all set priorities in our lives, even for what we spend our money on. As far as I'm concerned what you spend yours on is no concern of mine but like I said, it doesn't alter the fact that spending on hiring someone to play a game for you so you can keep up with the virtual Joneses is silly and not at all rational. Your priorities are mixed up big time.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Those who have the time to play for hours on end, more power to 'em.  Those of us who have jobs and can only play for certain few hours...why can't we have the same luxuries?  By your standards, we casual players would be forever condemned.  Never getting to go on big, long raids.  Never getting to camp FBSS or any other cool eq.  Yes I would love nothing more than sit at home all day and play EQ.  However that isn't an option for me.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>No, by my standards casual players would only be 'condemned' if they allowed themselves to be, just like now because I make zero reference to casual or non-casual players. How often you play the game is irrelevant to the whole argument since a non-casual player is just as likely to Ebay and a casual player is just as likely not to.<P>Your biggest power over Verant is your wallet. Instead of treating EQ like a drug you should treat it like the gaming product it is. Stop paying for it and stay away if Verant won't cater to your playing style since the game is obviously not for you. If the problem with casual players is great enough then Verant will have no choice but to accomodate you. Breaking your agreement with them is not in any way justified, especially when there is a perfectly simple alternative available.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Closing off the Ebay auction was a real blow to the casual player, plain and simple.  Whereas before, the casual player could semi-keep up equipment-wise, now they are blown away because they don't have time to sit online for hours on end.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Then stop playing until Verant do something to help you. If they don't then stop playing permanently. Of course you won't do that because you're addicted. In other words EQ isn't a game to you, it's a way of life. Since my opinion only affects rational people I can see why you have such a problem with it.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Fair or not, don't care.  Just stating my opinion and I'm not cramming it down anyone's throat =)<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>LOL you obviously don't practice lying that much or you'd be better at it. You are trying to cram your opinion down my throat for starters. That's ok though because I'm not in the habbit of swallowing anything that stinks so much  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"><P>

Shakti said, "You think everything said about ebay is just the absolute in universal truth, and is totally relavent, and will help in ANY way??"<P>You talk as if no one has refuted your original comment. They have, with several points you seem not to have noticed. I think by now we all can see the irrelevance of chewing over whether you were misunderstood, misquoted or whatever. It would appear that anyone answering your point with what you consider the correct interpretation was only useful as a tool to highlight how wrong others were to misunderstand you.<P>I wouldn't mind that so much but you ignore the valid points raised against you in favor of this petty flame war. I'm afraid that the more you continue in this vein the more you look to be proving your detractors correct, that you did just troll for flames. That is after all the sum total of what you've participated in so far. I think the best advice is to let it drop or respond to the valid arguments against your original point, you know, the ones you've managed to ignore for up to 4 pages.

Shakti,<P>I have read your orignal post more then a couple times. I have also read the entire thread. Your first post comes off as being clearly Pro-Ebay. Subsequent posts of yours, you try to say that the original had no bias either way. I suggest for you to take the same advice you have given many of your colleages, and re-read the original post. <P>I have nothing to offer on the Ebay issue, I could care less. Y'all gettin riled about nuthin as far as I am concerned.<P>M3,<P>Hail friend , may i suggest some night courses in English as a second language?<P>LOADING PLEASE WAIT...<P><BR>

So, other than the entertaining flames, the whole point of the original post was, if I'm not mistaken:<P>No matter what side of the EBay auction you chose, please stop trying to use/refute arguments about *earning the right* to possess an item. <P>Is that correct?<P>You use the the example of purchasing meat from a cow. You didn't *earn* the right to eat meat.<P>Shakti, I believe you're missing a fundamental assumption in the "earned" argument:<P>To obtain a piece of meat in the real world, you can use a wide variety of means to get it. You can work for money to buy it yourself. You can hunt, kill, skin, and cook the animal yourself. You can, if you are friendly enough, convince someone else to give you the meat. (Ex: Attractive women on dates having dinner purchased for them.)<P>All of these are legitimate methods in the real world of obtaining the meat. <P>Everquest is a virtual world. In this virtual world, you can save up enough platinum to buy the item. You can get the item yourself. If you are friendly enough, others might give the item just because they like you. All of these "virtually" duplicate real-world actions. The only items you "are allowed to" bring to the virtual world are your own social skills, reflexes, and intellegence, as filtered through the user interface.<P>Everything you gain in this virtual world should be because of what you have brought into this world, through the interface.<P>By purchasing items, you introduce the ability to manipulate the world through something other than just the interface. You've applied leverage to the game through some means other than the game interface.<P>Being able to be social, or being skilled at the game, make you desirable in the game. You will have *fun* with people who are skilled (because you will advance faster), and with people who are friendly (because you will enjoy the time you advance). Possessing the items, in theory at least, proves that the person with the items is capable of making the game more enjoyable for those around them.<P>If someone can get "better" items by buying them, they're haven't *demonstrated* any of those skills. The reason they possess the items *has no bearing on* what they will contribute to *your enjoyment*. <P>*That* is the "right" that people talk about. That is what was "earned". You gain items "properly" by demonstrating skills of patience, tactics, and/or friendliness. You gain them "improperly" by buying them. The fact that you have a million dollars has no bearing on what you will contribute to *my* fun. The fact that you are a friendly, intelligent, well-spoken, competent player *will*.<P>Those are the "merits" that "earn" you the item. That's what people are talking about when they say you haven't earned something, because you've bought it.<P>Now, feel free to argue the merits of my evaluation. However, the simple fact that I can *make* this evaluation proves that you cannot *dismiss* the "earned" argument out-of-hand, which is, I believe, the point of your original thread.

Shakti, I ask you again, READ the first line of my post stating it is clear you ebay.<P>Just because it SEEMS clear and obvious does not mean fact, the statment was an explanation as to why you were getting anti-ebay arguments. If you are piss drunk and it seems obvious to you that you could drive home with ease, it does not mean that this is the case, it only seems so from one persons perspective. Just because it SEEMS like you ebay, it does not write it in stone, likewise, just because you SAY that you do not ebay, it does not make this fact. Some people, such as myself, are not willing to commit to first impressions, and wait for more information before stating their thoughts, others jump in and flame and post based on you being an ebayer, and that is why you were mis-inturperated. These people may or may not be correct in thier assumption, I cannot say, and although you can, we cannot believe you unless you provide a suitble argument, due to a conflict of interest. So where is that egg? You STILL haven't shown me where I stated that you MUST ebay, I would like to see a quote of that. <P>I told you so Raz! You were too close, but would you listen? Oh noooo, you had to get torched yourself!<BR>*Swipes a hotdog from Raz an some chocolate, crackers, and marshmallows from, uhhhh, what is his name again? There are like 5 people with "Dark" in their names, whats up with that?<P>------------------<BR>True power does not exist, for I have not yet shown it to you...

They already have the item, what I'm saying is two things here, neither of which you are understanding:<P>1.  Its easier to find items I want to buy online as opposed to in-game.  I can't send a server-wide message saying 'I'm looking for an FBSS', instead I have to yell it over ooc or auc channel for hours until I find someone who wants to sell.  This saves me time (3 hours a day max remember for me to play).  So, I can spend 3 hours shouting and maybe not getting any playing done, or I can go to a message board (or auc website) and see whats for grabs.<P>2.  Casual players don't have time to camp these items for the most part.  As I stated above, I would love nothing more than to sit at home all day long and play EQ.  I like going to dungeons (the 2 I've been to), I like massive groups slaughtering mobs, I like playing.  What I don't like doing is spending my 3 hours standing in the EC tunnel shouting for items.  I understand that, as a casual player, I will always be behind in level, equip, etc than the players who can be on all day long.  However, if I have the resources, why not be able to purchase a better weapon?  Also, as stated above, its more logical for me to spend 20 dollars on an item online than it is for me to take a day off work to do it.  And much more sensible than me quitting my job to play EQ all day.  <P>So I ask you, is there a better solution?  If so, I'm all ears.<P>Uebermann<BR>

Cindoliana,<P>That was a nice, intelligently made argument  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"><P>Uebermann,<P>1. So? I understand this point perfectly. To some extent I can even sympathise. However, there are some facts you are ignoring:<P>a. Not all casual players Ebay so therefore if some can play the game as it was meant to be played then so can anyone.<P>b. Your character will not disintegrate if they don't own cool item X. It is more than possible to play the game as a game and not have a whole array of cool items.<P>c. You have available the option to play up to 8 characters per server per account. If your time resource is limited then you adapt your playing style to fit the options. Nothing says you MUST get item X for character Y. My point here is that you have alternatives such as playing a different character for example, a character who not only doesn't want item X but doesn't need it. Problem of spending your 3 hours shouting for an item solved. In other words it's your choice to spend your time how you want to. No one is twisting your arm.<P>d. Casual players are not the only people to buy from Ebay. Your argument regarding casual players is therefore not the whole picture and subsequently cannot be used as the sole argument. You must consider the pros and cons of allowing non-casual players access to Ebay too so many of your points are invalidated when you consider the bigger picture.<P>2. But purchasing an item has a few problems. First it is against the EULA to sell them so you are perpetrating dishonesty. Second you are encouraging farmers to gather these items for sale and therefore reducing the chances of someone who is neither a casual player (although casual players have as much chance to get any item in the time they are on too, providing it isn't being farmed) nor an Ebayer from getting it. Thirdly you are circumventing normal enjoyment of the game by taking a short-cut. I understand you may not see the last point in the same way I do but on this we'll have to differ. If you do not see this aspect of the game as fun then you should seriously consider finding a game that accomodates your available time. I've already shown that you don't need to gain said item to enjoy the game for what it is so therefore it's a personal choice to Ebay and one that is definately not within the spirit of the game.<P>Time sinks are a royal pain in the bum. I don't know of anyone who have time sinks given the choice but unfortunately it's currently how the game is done. Many, many players at least put up with this aspect of the game without resorting to Ebay etc. These players, one can only assume, still have fun playing. If you do not have fun on what is a very pervasive part of the game then why are you still playing? Taking short-cuts is only acceptable when it is within the spirit of the game. EG, don't like walking get a port, don't like dying get a better group, don't like corpse finding get a res, don't like poor organisation find a decent leader, and the list goes on.<P>Items come to you in time, they do not need to be bought with real world cash. If you cannot or will not spend the time building your character within the spirit of the game then you aren't playing the same game as everyone else. Find another that suits.<P>As for your initial comment asking how Ebaying is hiring someone to play the game for you, well I already explained that. Aside from the fact that Ebayers are in every literal sense selling an item, their use of the time selling argument falls down because no one cares how much time they spent getting the item. You even accept this argument when you point out that it's better to spend $20 on an item than losing $90 staying off work to get it. Your example has it's own flaws but the principle is the same, that YOUR time is valuable, not someone else's. Therefore you are purchasing the services of someone with spare time to actually get the item for you. In other words you are hiring them to play that aspect of the game for you.<P>The solutions to lack of playing time are simple. The question is are you willing to take the alternatives. If Ebay is around the answer is obviously no because it's far simpler for you to take the 'easy' route. If Ebay isn't available then you don't have the option of the 'easy' route. Your initial reaction is to complain they got rid of Ebay etc. Understandable. However, since your complaint is baseless (Ebaying is against the EULA) then you're going to have to consider the alternatives. You know what they are: stop playing a game you cannot afford the time to play to your personal satisfaction OR play to your means in-game, as it should be and as the majority of players already do.
