This is a petition.  A petition that verant actually fix and improve the mage class, as they havent been fixed or improved since beta (I played a mage in beta 3).<P>Many of you on the tribunal server, prexus, lanys tvyl, rallos zek, and test might have talked to me, as for the last 2 weeks I have been spending quite a bit of EQ time going around to these servers (chosen randomly, except for tribunal which I play on) to discuss the problems with fellow mages and see if all mages were agreed on them.  Thus far I have a list of over 40 mages who have heard in depth all of which I will outline in this message, and all 40 mages were in complete agreement with the problems at hand.  Only 2 mages out of the 45+ that I talked to had any dispute about any of the problems - not all of them - but merely one or two.  I would also like to take this chance to appologize to all of the mages I have bothered in-game about this, as most people dont log on to have some stranger start talking to them about thier class for 10 minutes while they should be helping thier group kill monsters.<P>I will first outline the problems as both I and the mages I've talked to see them, and will then post proposed solutions below by problem #.<P>Problem 1 - wandering mages, sitting ducks...<BR>This is one of the biggest problems with mages, both in combat (soloing especially), and in travelling (which is half of the game).  The problem is quite simple - a mage gets aggrod on by a monster: 1) he has a pet to defend himself, in which the pet can eventually taunt the monster off of the mage so the mage can either help his pet kill the monster or he can get a head start running to zone -OR- 2) he has no pet to defend himself, in which case he also has no way to get the monster off of him, and so he dies.  This is a huge problem, mages are the ONLY class that have no means to evade a monster that is aggrod on them while they are perhaps just running through a zone, or fighting a monster that just WILL NOT taunt onto his/her pet.  Necros have snare (darkness), root at 34, shadow step, and feign death - by all means a good necro should never die.  Enchanters have root, stuns, mezmerize, memory wipes, charms...the list goes on...enchanters are the best at getting an aggrod monster off of them, whether it be when travelling through a zone or in a fight gone bad.  Wizards have snare and root, starting at lvl 4 - this is thier bread and butter, they also have stuns, so wizards are by all means quite capable of travelling anywhere without risk and ensuring that they can get away from a monster if they end up in a fight gone bad.  Dictating whether or not you should stay and fight/die or run and live is half of the game, so it is a big deal.  However for mages, we do not have that choice, we stay and die, end of story.<P>Problem 2 - conjuration masters: but, but, I can summon you lots of toilet paper!<BR>This problem has arisen from the fact that mage summon spells havent changed since beta, and all the equipment in norrath certainly HAS.  In beta, when a tank was on a corpse run, he might ask me for 2 swords of runes so that he might fight off anything that aggros him along the way.  Back then, this weapon was quite adequate, it still isnt as good as fine steel, and although it is the mages best summoned weapon, it is still good enough to give to a person in need (heck, a rusty sword is better then nothing, right?).  Mage weapons are useless, we only summon them for necro pets and recently our own pets (mages pets used to be unable to wield weapons), and still, they are only summoned to make our pets look "neater"...they dont actually help them much, if at all (I have seen absolutely no difference, so I will continue to believe, until I see some actual implemented code, that weapons do not do a single thing but make the pet look different).  Mages can summon food, drink, bandages at 4, a useless pouch at 8, infravision stone at 16 (until then, erudites and humans, you are blind), water breathing stone at 24, more food and drink at 24, ultravision stone at 29, finally a ring that gives us levitation at 39, and a modulating rod at 44.  Not exactly masters of conjuration if you ask me: we are the only caster class that is unable to enhance vision until 16, the items we summon give us effects that should be available at half the lvl in which we recieve them (who needs levitate at 39? at 20 it would be useful, at 39 its just something more we can summon for newbies who dont even thank us).  Also, I just outlined everything a mage can summon...that isnt much you say, and no, its not...the infravision and ultravision stones are useful only to erudite or human mages, the water breathing stone is mostly unused, the levitation ring at the level which we recieve it is not even useful anymore, bandages are good, food and drink is good to have, those pouches are useless - too small and you cant even put most items into them, and the modulating rod...well, better thought of then it actually is.<P>Problem 3 - how do you kill monsters with a mage again?<BR>This has been a problem since beta, however it wasnt as much of a problem back then, as the rest of the classes hadnt been so highly enhanced and improved yet, and the monsters hadnt been tuned up and buffed.  Back in beta, a mage was actually a foe to reckon with.  Our pets were almost on par with necro pets, our DD spells were sufficient, our AE spells were nice to have (although unusable now), and at least half of the items we summoned were actually useful.  Sadly, this game is all about hack and slash, thats all there is to this game, and although verant has implemented this hack and slash ideollogy (sp?) in a manner which it is much more entertaining then the normal diablo clone, it is still hack and slash.  If your class doesnt have sufficient means to dispatch monsters with, then your class is useless...I could care less if you can cast clarity, sow, all the buffs in the game, heals, etc....if you cannot kill monsters solo your class is group dependant and thus you can no longer just log on and play the game, you must log on and try to find a group before your time runs out and you have to log off.  A mage has 1 way to kill monsters.  Direct damage spells and his/her pet.  That is all we have.  Now, our DD spells are supposedly second only to wizard...this is untrue during most of the game (lvl 1 to 60).  We also have a few AE spells.  However, AE spells only get us killed, and so they are useless (and mana inefficient to begin with).<BR>So, the first issue with this problem is mage pets.  Mage pets, every single one of them, can be easily taken out by a necro pet of same level.  Throw into this equation the mage pet being buffed by the mage burnout, fire shielded by the mage fire shield, and given the best weapon the mage has: the necro pet will still win.  I have tried this duel every lvl of the game, as I have previously played a lvl 50 mage along with a lvl 50 necro all the way to 50.  I have also tried pretty much every pet at every level (I had to do some of the duels for lvl 24 through 44 pets when I was in fact 50 and could actually research the pets we could not buy).  Mages should summon the most fearsome pets on norrath, we are afterall CONJURATION MASTERS, are we not?  Mage pets should be bar-none able to out-tank, out-damage, and out-taunt any other pet of the same level in the game.  Our pets should have more HP, more armor class (our pets get hit for max damage by mobs of same level as them), more attack rating, more strength/dexterity so that they hit harder, land more of thier hits, and can actually take some damage.  Mage's pet's spells (root, gust of air, burst of fire, slash of ice) are also more of a burden then a good thing, as they resist 99% of the time, they require the pet to sacrifice a round of combat (where they could be missing the target in melee instead), and they cause the pet to stand still and allow the monster chasing us to get ahead of them (most solo fights invole the mage running from the monster, and the pet trying to keep up hitting it from behind trying to taunt it).  I do think that pet's spells were a good idea, however they were not implemented correctly.  If verant wishes to keep this good idea of thiers, they should at least FIX it.  Make pet's spells unresistable to monsters up to 8 levels above the pet (ie: halfway to our next spell lvl, white monsters cannot resist our pet's spells).  Also, do not make our pets sacrifice a round of combat to cast the spell, implement it as a proc (with a very high proc rate) instead to allow them to continue hitting (otherwise, for example, our earth pet sits there and casts root 6 times in a row and every time it resists, which accomplished absolutely nothing except make the monster hate the mage more since the pet isnt taunting or doing damage).  Pet's spells in fact do not do much, the root obviously does some good (allowing the mage to flee), and the gust of air obviously does some good (it stuns the monster, ie: allowing the mage to flee), but they resist so much that I would much rather not have them at all the way it is right now.<BR>The next issue with this problem is mage DD and AE - our only other asset besides our weak little pets.  Mage DD spells are NOT second only to wizard.  Mage DD spells are only a few points higher then necro DD spells, they are sometimes even less then enchanter DD spells, and even druids have a higher DD then mages for half of the game (ie: 1 through 50).  Mage DD and AE spells SHOULD be second only to wizard, EVERY level of the game, WITHOUT question whatsoever.  That doesnt mean that we should do 1 MORE point of damage then the necro, enchanter, and druid spells of any specific level, it means we should do 20, 50, 80 points LESS then the wizard spell of that specific level.  Mage DDs at level 29 for example, 176 damage, versus necro DD at 24, 160 damage.  We should be doing about 200 DD at level 29, more in line with the wizard's DD of 250 at that level.  We still arent as mana efficient - by far, and we still dont do as much damage, and we still cant cast our DDs as fast - this keeps wizards out in the front by far in direct damage (especially with wizard spells being less resistable).<BR>Also, our AE spells should be pumped up a bit.  The way I see it, although wizard SHOULD be the master of dealing damage in anyway spellwise, mages are tuned for AE spells.  We throw rains of fire down over our pets wreaking havoc on the monsters he is taunting away from us - that is what a mage should be like - that is what verant says a mage is - that is very very far from the truth.<BR>Our malise line of spells, it should have the same resistance check as tashan, it is the same kind of spell, and the shamans have been petitioning this for almost a year now.<P>######################################<BR>Proposed solutions<BR>######################################<BR>Problem 1 - wandering mages, sitting ducks...<BR>Mages are masters of conjuration and masters of the elements.  Our post lvl 50 class names are even "Elementalist" and "Conjurer" so if verant even disputes this, they have proven how mentally ill they are.  Snare and root come straight from the earth element.  We should have both of these spells.  We should have single target root, single target snare, AE root, and AE snare.  Mages should have these spells starting at either lvl 4 or 8 and they should correspond to about the same level that any other class gets the spells.  This would give us a way to evade monsters, a way to be more helpful to our group, and it would actually finally give mages what they were meant to have - mastery of the element: earth.<P>Problem 2 - conjuration masters: but, but, I can summon you lots of toilet paper!<BR>I already know that verant has admitted to this problem, so I wont go into too much detail as I have faith in thier abilities, and hope they have already come up with some solutions.  Basically it is simple, every weapon a mage summons is useless at the level he/she is able to summon it.  Back when there were level 40s wielding well-balanced and fine steel weapons, and that was normal and "good" equipment for thier level, mage weapons were not all that bad.  However, now, they are rusty short swords.  The items a mage summons are also useless and very limited.  We should be able to summon items that give us any desired effect in the game.  I would even go so far as to say we should be able to summon sow rocks (1 charge stones alike that of the water breathing stone that click to give us sow equivalent to [(our level) - (level we recieved sow rock)].  For example if we recieved the sow rock spell at 20, at lvl 20 we would summon a lvl 1 sow rock spell (equivalent to lvl 9 shaman sow).  We are also the only class that has no means to regenerate mana faster.  We are the ONLY caster class that just has to sit and meditate every point of our mana the hard way.  This should not be so, especially since our DDs are mana inefficient, and our summons cost a huge amount.  We should be able to summon a "breeze fan" at level 20 (4 levels after enchanter breeze), and a "clarity rod" at level 34 (5 levels after enchanter clarity).  These items would be one charge items, alike all other mage summoned items, that will give the appropriate and corresponding level of a "breeze" and "clarity" type spell.  This will hopefully negate the hard fact that mages have the longest downtime of any caster.  Now, I realize you are all perhaps thinking I am crazy to think that mages should recieve sow.  However, think about this, what do mages have that one of the 3 other caster classes dont?  We can summon food and drink...thats about it.  We should be able to conjure items that give us any desired effect we want, why not give our class something unique? Actually give us what was promised?  Its definitely not something mages dont deserve, afterall, it falls completely in line with what our profession is, so why not actually fix our class?<P>Problem 3 - how do you kill monsters with a mage again?<BR>Mage pets should be the best pets in norrath.  That is our calling, to be able to summon beings of great power to do our bidding.  We are not enchanters that merely animate inanimate objects, we are not necromancers that reanimte dead corpses or control the essence of bones, we summon actual beings from the planes of the elements.  They have names, they have personalities, they are our friends and companions.  Mage pets should have much higher AC, mage pets should NOT get hit for the same amount of damage as the mage him/herself gets hit for.  Mage pets should have more HP, as a mage, your heal pet spell is one spell that MUST be memorized AT ALL TIMES, otherwise your pet dies and there goes another summon stone (and usually a bit of exp too, since you die next).  Pet healing spell should be for emergencies, it shouldnt be a neccessity.  Right now I am playing a level 30 mage, and to even try and solo low blues/high greens I have to heal my pet at least twice or it WILL die.  The process of a fight with mage solo right now usually goes like this: burnout on pet, fire shield on pet, malise or nuke moster to pull, send pet on it, run around in circles until pet can taunt monster, sit and med for 10 sec, heal pet, nuke, heal pet, sit and med for 10 sec, nuke, heal pet, nuke, by now mana is all gone, so I either die or I am victorious with at the most 20% mana left and a pet that has at the very most 40% of his life.  Then I sit and meditate and go grocery shopping or run some errands, because it takes that long to meditate back to full, and without full mana you cannot solo monsters that give anything near good experience, especially since mage has such a high experience penalty.  In groups where our pets arent the tanks, we dont have this problem too often, but we are still not very useful in a group.  Personally I would rather have a necro, enchanter, wiz, druid, shaman, or just another good tank in my group then another mage.  We are weak, and we are mostly useless.<P><BR>And this was one heck of a long post...so my parting words will be that if you are a fellow mage, help our petition out, because I know you know the burdensome task we have at just being able to play.  It is a game, we pay for it, this should not be the case.<BR>Also, if you are a mage and think differently about anything written here, please voice your oppinion.  The above stated problems are only problems in the eyes of myself and the mages I have talked to.  The more ideas and oppinions we get, the better overall solution will be.<P>Conjour Mastarre, gnomish level 34 mage, fenin ro, beta - deceased<BR>Malaan Ktok N'Maar, dark elf level 24 mage, bristlebane - deceased<BR>Nezar N`Amun, erudite level 50 mage, erollisi marr - deceased<BR>Dor'egal N`Amun, erudite level 30 mage, the tribunal - going into retirement

Unfortunately it will not be seen and heard by anyone from verant on these message boards. <P>The official sony boards at <A HREF="http://www.everquest.com" TARGET=_blank>www.everquest.com</A>  is where you should post this.<P>Tomething you said triggered a thought. We could summon weapons to give to our pets and Necro's couldnt. They made 39th level pets auto dual wield and told us it was a fix for our class. In reality it was a candy for the necro's only.. the favored class (well druids too).

I like the post, but again, it needs to be reposted on the official board.  I am playing a mage (lvl 34) and enjoy the challenge, but some times it gets so frustrating because of the many faults built into the class.  I would like to see a few of the changes mentioned implemented.  Specifically, the conjuration issue and the travel issues.<P>------------------<BR>Fendomir Guldur<BR>Arcane Elder<BR>Rage Academy<BR>Saryrn Server

BRAVO ....man, you got all the reasons I'm sitting my mage in the sidelines until he's competent of a player again....<BR>at lower lvls, the pets are effective...at higher lvls (my mage is 33) they just plain cannot do what they are intended.<P>One thing about the summoned pouches though...I disagree about them being useless, they are awesome to have, a bag that you can put something extremely heavy in & have NO weight penalty....The PROBLEM of these bags is if you go LD, they go poof along with everything inside them, can't tell you how much cash I've lost from keeping worthwhile loot in them...as far as I've seen, Verant REFUSES to fix this saying it is the "chance" we take for using this class....yeah, I can summon more, but they never go LD with their T3 connections at the main building & lose all their hard earned loot....example...15th lvl mage spends 8 hours solid in lavastorm, has 20 stack of basaliks eggs worth 6 gold each, bloodstones worth 5g each, putrid biles (2g each or more to a rogue for poison production)...right there is roughly 40 plat & 8 hours of hunting for cash for spells & pet gems down the drain. At higher lvls...oh man do you need cash for those spells...& uber equipement to keep yer arse alive cause our pets blow chunks, I'm starting to think enchanters have better pets, I know they generally last longer than my earth pet at lvl 29.<P>Anyways, just a point I wanted to make about the pouches...again, I'd love to play my mage again in the future, but I give up for now...if they are one of the top 3 soloers, all I have to say is, my monk solos better.

I'm a 52nd mage so I know what I'm talking about.. lets see...<P>1. I pretty much agree we need some form of defense when we don't have a pet summoned... ok this one is fine.<P>2. I'm pretty fine with the conjurations, sure, would have been nice to get the beer at level 20, but heck, I got beer now at 52    <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">.  And remember, we still get levitate before necro's do, their lev is at level 44.  Not to mention if you're running over the ocean and all of a sudden lev starts blinking we can just click that ring and not worry about it, all other classes have to cast the spell (and, half the time, sit down and memorize it).<P>3.  Our pets aren't beat by necro pets, at least not since the weapons patch.  Yeah way back when necro pets could wield daggers and mage pets were weaponless blobs, the necro pets beat the living crap out of our pets.  Now my 51 earth pet can on some occasions even beat the necro spectre pet (with burnout 3 and a fire shield, of course..)  Also, have you ever tried chain-summoning pets to kill mosters?  Works a lot better and more mana efficient than nuking.  Throw in a nuke when you're on your last pet and you'll out damage it, since you only have to out damage the final pet to get full exp.<P>How many of the mages you talked to were over level 50?  I don't see how 43 out of 45 could have agreed fully on everything.  Our class has some problems, but 2 and 3 aren't ones I consider problems.<P>And to the guy who posted above me, level 33 is the worst level for magicians.  Your pets are weak and you're still using your level 24 DD.  Get level 34 and you'll love the class again.  And lol, yeah, my monk at 32 brings in the exp faster than I remember doing on my mage at level 32.  Then again my monk is twinked (ya know, just the good ol' knuckle duster and fbss, nothing else...).<P><p>[This message has been edited by Saethan (edited March 06, 2001).]

Breeze, clarity, necros twitching mana to you, two bard songs and even a meditation skill to increase your mana recovery rate.

Nice topic friend.  You thought long and hard and it shows in your post, but with a few drawbacks.  I assume this is your first and primary char?<P>Most peeps that complain have a favorite class which is their primary class of course hehehe.  I will address some issues, and this is NOT flaming, just discussion.  In preface here, I have a lvl 49 pali, 42 wizard, a 35th mage, and a host of others all in double digits.<P>Please try to refrain from comparing class x to class y.  This is Verants tactics of getting us to destroy each other.  Verant will almost always nerf another class because we say class x does this and class y cant.  Be mad at Verant, stay away from other classes for comparissons, and say what you want and why.<P>Summoned items worthless?  Im thinking of making my mage last name Seveneleven or Wallmart  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">  Im always wanted to make bandages, arrows (MAGIC mind you, able to hit any mob unlike handmade arrows that need a high skill and loads of plat), throwing daggers for rogues/monks, food and drink, bags, etc.  Maybe it is only on Rodcet Nife that people adventure without being 100% fully stocked, but I summon A LOT.<P>Water breathing stones Im always bugged for...smart peeps hunt crocs underwater in oasis (avoid giants, specs, and the crowds of peeps hunting on the shore).  Also, many quests need underwater breathing like Kedge Keep, Permafrost, Killing sharks for ro armor, etc.  Im bombarded for requests for this item, and many very fruitful hunting areas underwater  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">  Levitation?  Wiz hardly used it at all until around lvl 40.  Now, you get water breathing (wiz doesnt) and levitation (wiz needs to carry stacks of wings, you dont).<P>Mana regen:  Good topic here.  Wiz gets a spell that takes (forget now, used it 5 days and stopped) 5 to 10 min to mem, and has same recast time.  It was not even enough mana for 1 bbl.  Mages summon mana rods at will.  Also, mages pet does damage above the spells, AND keeps doing damage when you are OOM.  Wiz contribute nothing at all when oom...also you have dd's at some lvls more damage than a wiz.<P>AoE's...another good topic.  Most wiz's do not use them and plead with Verant to give us dd's instead.  AoE in general, is suicide.  6 mobs, cast AoE, and your tank fight 1 while the other 5 pummel you into goo.<P>Stun and root...good issue, until you count resists and agro.  IF wiz stun isnt resisted, 1 chance for root.  IF root sticks, it almost always breaks after our 1st nuke, so stun, root, nuke, repeat.  Earth pet always pummels time after time and keeps rooting at NO mana cost to you.<P>Damage shield (I added this) my mage has it, and mage damage shields are the best in the game bar none.  Damage shield is a aoe in a way, 12 mobs hitting your tank/pet all take damage on every hit and is unresistable.<P>Mobs dont taunt on your pet? Damage shield your pet, let it hurt mob at least 1 bbl, and use lower lvl dd's, not your best.  My mage is seldom agro'd on, mobs stick to my pet most of the time, it not I run till it re-agros pet (if Im solo'ing).  Also, remember, a wiz has no pet at all to TRY to taunt mob off  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"><P>The list continues, but suffice it to say we almost always think the grass is greener on the other side.  I play my wiz primarily for the friends I have at that lvl, and the guild needed a transport.  My mage is always been the most useful and deadlier (overall) than the wiz.  I solo mobs with mage pet and sometimes dont even cast on mob till death blow, if that <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"><P>Lastly, if you think you want the wiz powers of root, stun and (LOL) the better mana regen of a wizard, do as I did...play a wiz to the same level and see it from the other side of the fence.  You will (odds are) run screaming back to play your mage IF your guild/friends let you (we really NEED you to port us).<P>Good luck on trying to improve mage class, heck...ALL the classes are way overpowered by mobs it seems and ALL need improved, but none should be vastly superior to the others.<P>Burzug Ironfyst<BR>49th circle of training<BR>Rodcet Nife

I dunno how many times I've said this, but eqislife, when you said wizzies at one point have dd's that do less than mages, LISTEN UP!<P>The ONE single level that we have a spell that does more damage is level 34.  BUT... that spell is a BOLT, it has a longer CAST TIME, and it takes more MANA.  So you can still do more dmg/sec/mana with your dd than we can with our bolt.<P>Every wizard tries to use this as an example where they're not the masters of nuking at a certain level but it's completely wrong.

Sae, and all the others out there, Im aware of the bolt spell, same as clerics have 1 dd that is more damage...but there are other factors besides just time of cast/mana/dam.<P>There is a matter of a wizard cannot use his faster casting, or get agro'd (same as a mage), wizards have ONLY the spell, your (and MY mages pet) does awesome damage even when you (we) are NOT casting.<P>Faster casting time, as is the first argument of mages as why wiz's are masters of damage, also means faster OOM  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">  Many groups tell the wiz NOT to dump mana "just 1 or 2 nukes and sit" is common instructions to a wiz.<P>A wizard CANNOT use fast casting in melee or mobs will aggro and, possibly, kill the wiz.  Since (in a group setting) a wizard cannot use his fast casting times, it IS a mute point.<P>The mage pet adds damage, the lava damage shield does damage, and the mage DD does damage.  The mage can malaise mobs to lower magic resistance so MORE spells land and do more damage overall during a evening of adventuring.<P>Yes, if a lvl 39 mage and a lvl 39 wiz are soloing a mob, there is a good chance the wiz could KS the mob on that 1 pull.  But after that, the wiz is medding, while mage and pet keep killing more.<P>Bolt spells work great in melee on giants and all other larger mobs btw  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">.<P>I was not bashing poster, I also have a mage...and my mage is more of a damage dealer in the course of a day of adventuring than my wizard is.  I agreed that overall the mage class does need improvements, but all classes do.  There really isnt much "balance" in the game overall between classes right now.<P>The term "master of damage" is a made up title by verant that is untrue.  Only the mobs in EQ are truly the "masters of damage" hehehe.<P>I was only pointing out to the poster that the mage skills are not as poor as he states, and it is easier to think the other classes are "better" until you personnally play them to your same level.  Once you do, your understanding of each char strengths and weaknesses will be much better, and allows for a better idea of what to ask for.

Mages are one of the most powerful classes in the whole game.  They can dish out damage faster that anyone except a Wizzie, and have a pet to help defend them and deal damage.

Dear "A Disgruntled Old Mage",<BR> <BR>I am Swiftheart... i play a lvl 31 magi on the rodcet nife server... and i have played a lvl 49 mage before all the way up to lvl 55.  So personally as a mage...<BR>...That is NOT anything i want "A Disgruntled Old Mage"<P>Do you even play a mage? Sorry if i sound like i am flameing you... i am not. Just a simple question.<P>Problem 1 - wandering mages, sitting ducks...<P>A-Have you heard of Gate? It's this really nice little spell we are given around lvl 4... only 5-6 gp in FP.<BR>-Gate has saved my life many a time before... and i KNOW it will save it again in the future.<BR>B-Sure if i gate it'll be a while till i get back to my destination...<BR>-i would rather run and loose time... then die...loose exp... AND STILL DO THE RUN!<BR>-Thats why we have bind...<BR>C-Mages don't have a neon light sign attached to their backs saying "HEY COME KILL ME!!! I AM A MAGE!"<BR>-mobs have the same agro range on mages as they do on anyone else... <BR>-thats why we have PETS to protect us while medding.<P>Problem 2 - conjuration masters: but, but, I can summon you lots of toilet paper!<P>-"Mage weapons are useless, ..." <P>A- LIE!!!<BR>-i have been summoning my pet its weapons alot... <BR>-every group i have with necro's and whatnot i need to summon the swords for the pets.<BR>-just the other day a lbl 40+ enchanter asked for two swords for his pet.<BR>B-These weapons of our is good enough<BR>-they proc,<BR>-do reasonabley good DMG<P>-"Mages can summon food, drink, bandages at 4, a useless pouch at 8, infravision stone at 16 (until then, erudites and humans, you are blind), water breathing stone at 24, more food and drink at 24, ultravision stone at 29, finally a ring that gives us levitation at 39, and a modulating rod at 44. Not exactly masters of conjuration if you ask me: we are the only caster class that is unable to enhance vision until 16, the items we summon give us effects that should be available at half the lvl in which we recieve them (who needs levitate at 39? at 20 it would be useful, at 39 its just something more we can summon for newbies who dont even thank us). Also, I just outlined everything a mage can summon...that isnt much you say, and no, its not...the infravision and ultravision stones are useful only to erudite or human mages, the water breathing stone is mostly unused, the levitation ring at the level which we recieve it is not even useful anymore, bandages are good, food and drink is good to have, those pouches are useless - too small and you cant even put most items into them, and the modulating rod...well, better thought of then it actually is."<P>A-bandages <BR>-as a mage, when i solo that is, my health sometimes gets down low... and OMG there are no healers around...<BR>look in my spell book,<BR>memorize Summon Bandages...<BR>and bring my health from nothing to half full.<BR>-Warriors have forever asked me for bandages.<P>B-infravision stone <BR>-almost every human has asked me for these... <BR>-these are actually a good iteam and used for all lvls.<P>C-water breathing stone is mostly unused...<BR>-ummmmm.<BR>-These stones are more usefull in KK or any other under water zone out there then a druid casting it.<BR>( sorry all you druid out there  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/tongue.gif"> )<BR>-a Druid needs a fish scale per cast... and if OOM he can't cast it.. you Underwater breathing spells goes BYE BYE... ooooops?<BR>Wheres the mage that can summon these stones without scales... and give you them... where you can cast when YOU need it... and even if the mage is OOM it works? <BR>OOPS he/she isn't with you because you think his/her spell "Summon Water Stone" is worthless... oops.  Time to die of suffocation.<P>D-finally a ring that gives us levitation at 39,<P>-Mages can summon a ring that will Lev. whenever we right click it... it has two charges... DOESN'T take a bat wing to summon.<BR>-HOW are these useless?<P>E-everyone wants our summoned stuff!<BR>-there has not YET been a zone i haven't been asked for at least six of my summoned things... <BR>-Summoning food/water is cheaper then buying... and everyone asks for me to summon it for them.<BR>-lazy rangers and warriors don't want to BUY arrows...wheres the mage? oh HIYAS!!! can i have some arrows plz?<P>E-if you want mana regen play a chanter...<BR>-mages have the second best mana regen out of Wizzys/Chanters/Mages...<BR>-sure you loose HP when useing it... but that is what clerics are for...<BR>-casting this spell doesn't stun you, and it doesn't take ten full min.s to be fully memed and recovered... and another ten min after used.<BR>-as i said... if you want mana regen PLAY A CHANTER!!!<P><BR>Problem 3 - how do you kill monsters with a mage again?<P>A-So, the first issue with this problem is mage pets. Mage pets, every single one of them, can be easily taken out by a necro pet of same level. Throw into this equation the mage pet being buffed by the mage burnout, fire shielded by the mage fire shield, and given the best weapon the mage has: the necro pet will still win.<P>-also, AGAIN.... LIE!!!<BR>-i have dueled a necro who was my same exact lvl... no buffs on these pets at all (that means no burnout was aloud to be cast on the mage pet) and WON!<BR>-Mages pets all have their own advantages...<BR> <BR>Earth<BR>       Spell- Root<BR>       Advantages-STR & most HP<P>Air-<BR>       Spell-Invis<BR>       Advantages-(n/a)<P>Fire-<BR>       Spell-DD & buff<BR>       Advantages-fire sheild...<P>Water-<BR>       Spell-DD <BR>       Advantages-regens the fastest.<P>-we have FOUR types of pets... necros only have ONE... <BR>-what lvl pet were you useing? lvl 4???<BR>-when i played the mage (lvl 49 one) i KSed a grp on Seafuries Island in OOT with ONLY my pet... the grp was lvl 40-45s 6 of them, i didn't cast any DD's or anything...<P>Okay to summon it all up...<BR>-Mages are fine as they are.<BR>-we are in as much trouble as anyone else in every zone as anyone else...<BR>-our sommoning spells are the BEST and summoning food and water is WAY better then BUYING... and EVERYONE wants us to summon the food/water/arrows/sword ECT...<BR>-ur pets are the BEST of all the classes that can USE pets.<P>Thanks for listening to me,<P>-Swiftheart Domina`Luna<BR>&lt;Troubles Band&gt;<BR>Rodcet Nife server<P>/say Yes i know death... Death is my best buddy, but no matter what i do NOT want to see him more then three times a lvl.<BR>/grin<P><BR>

Havatar,<P>Woops, I did my homework, but it appears that you have not.  Bards can help others recover mana faster, however, their mana stays low.  After using Denon's Desparate Dirge, a bard is out of mana (the song drains all mana from the bard).  It will take a bard about 80 (that is eight zero, not a typo) minutes to be at full mana again.  While bard songs will help others regen mana, they do not help the bard.  Clarity helps all other mana users recover mana faster, but not bards.  Necros can twitch mana to bards (the necro loses his mana), but the bard never gets the mana.  Bards also have meditation capped at 1, which means they get no bonuses for medding other than the normal sitting increase.<P>As I said before, mages have plenty of in game methods for mana recovery, meditation, breeze, clarity, necros, at least three different bard songs, mod rods, etc.<P>Thanks for playing, please drive through.<P>Dilbis Xll &lt;Balefire Clan&gt;<BR>52nd Human Bard<BR>Tarew Marr<P>P.S.  Your make-up test will be scheduled for next Saturday morning, but the best I can do is average your grades.

Disgruntled Old Mage, I read your post, and to be honest it almost sounds like you haven't played your mage since beta 3. <P>Escape a problem? Get HP/AC items, get jboots, get some more levels, learn to take advantage of the pathing, keep gate memmed, and learn the zones you travel through like the back of your hand.<P>Pet power? My focused level 60 water pet with muzzle of mardu and burnout out-taunted a level 55 warrior, the cleric had to heal the pet all the time instead of the warrior. Who are the 40 mages you talked to who are in complete agreement with your rants?<P>Summoned items? ...you said our summoned bags are too small to hold anything. Have you ever scribed a spell called Gift of Xev? The bag has 10 slots and last I checked it can hold anything that you can put in a backpack, if not bigger items also. Sure we could use better summoned items, but their absence doesn't make mages a dying race.<P>Sorry to say it, but it's GIMME GIMME GIMME posts like yours that hide the real issues in the noise.<P>Datalore

I forgot the other one....how do mages kill monsters? Gee, maybe get the pet to tank, then burn the mob to the ground, and possibly chain cast another pet when the first one is low? Duh. <P>Bored with the old routine? Get a cleric to duo with you, pull three mobs, sic pet on first incoming, aim so that the 2nd and 3rd try to run through pet and stop to hit it, and when they are all nicely aggroed on the damage-shielded pet, cast scintillation 2-3 times.

umm, my bard lost in a duel at level 20, and of course I was out of mana, so I sat there for a while and noticed how hella slow my mana was going up (like it matters, but I hate empty bars), so I turned on the new mana song and my mana most definately went up faster. So bard mana songs do give the bard mana...

1. According to Verant, since we have an earth pet that casts root we don't need it as a spell.  While my pets have saved me dozens of times while I ran to zone, being able to cast root would've turned battles around.  A mage that wanders/sits around a mob filled area with no pet is a stupid and dead mage IMO.  We do have gate (as all casters have), but 5 seconds is too long and our pets always seem to taunt the mob off us just as we die (just like warriors).  All we need is root. The rest will get away from Verants Vision of necro/druid superiority.<P>2.  While I disagree that our summoning spells are worthless (you forgot our pets), I will agree that our summoning selection has remained stagnated while the games gear has skyrocketed.  Anyone turning down items/weapons for CR is stupid.  We save ourselves money with free food, water, and bandaids. Our summoned bags are great (if you have a good connection).  I disagree with having us make sow/clarity items.  That would make us overpowered.  I would like Verant to review the items we do summon and improve/place them in the appropriate levels, plus give us ones in line with the improved gear they have introduced to the game. I would suggest adding +5, +10, +15, +25 resist items, 1 charge per 10 levels. For those who responded to his post please do not try to "add" equipment.  Not everyone has 5000pp or belongs to a guild that has the time and manpower to ensure that all of its members characters have "uber" gear.   <P>3.  True our pets aren't equal to necros, but that is the way Verant wants it.  Verant declared druid and necro to be the only "solo" classes and has nerfed others so they could be.  They gave us monster summoning for a "cool effect", but there was no improvement on the pets themselves.  I agree that our pets fight like bards instead of warriors.  Their spells are indeed heavily resisted.  While I do not share your idea of unresistable pet spells, I do believe that Verant could fix pets by making them cast and fight at the level which they were summoned.  For those who scoff at that need to take a look at how difficult our research is.<P>I agree that our DD line should be pumped up a bit and that malise is almost worthless to cast since mob resistance doesn't seem to drop at all.  True we should be second in spell damage but that would take away from necro and druid being the top soloers.<P>Mages aren't really group friendly.  While we can support the group with an additional tank, food, water, bandaids; our spells aren't mana efficient(which requires a longer downtime) and we can be easily replaced by any other caster.<P>One thing he didn't touch on is our research.  Whomever came up with mage research needs to be slapped several times over.  While others needs 2 research items, we need 3 to 4. Plus we have to research the items at least twice, because the next level research item calls for a previous research item as an ingredient. <P>With all the nerfs going on to make necros/druids more powerful, classes like the mages aren't really viable. <P>Haquiem<BR>Wandering Mage

Problems with the mage class:<P>Pets don't hit hard or fast enough. They are ~marginally~ better than necro pets.  And I really do mean marginally..now any of our mage pets will beat any necro pet of the same level..they are sipmly better in every single way..but they aren't good ENOUGH. At 39, my pet should hit for 44, at 44, it should hit for 50, at 51 to 54, it should hit for 60, 56 to 60, it should hit for 67.  The epic should hit for 75.  all 50+ pets should have a built in damage shield.<P>WILDFIRE: either get rid of this spell, or give us a better one.  A druid should not, ever, ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever be able to outnuke me.  A druid isn't a nuker, yet they are given a plainly better nuke, this is intolerable, and is one of the main reasons I quit being a mage.  A druid is a damage class, and a utility/effect class, but they do it in other ways.  <P>Epic- too difficult.  Move the crown to the sixth or fifth island, make the staff 100% (or close drop) and make the cloak mage ONLY(to get rid of the competition for this item), that will bring our epic down to doable proportions.<P>Root/Stun/Snare. We need one of these, and only one. Snare would probably fit us the best, as we are supposed to be a 'solo' class, and without snare, you have very little soloing capability (shamans attest to THIS)<P>Gear- all casters across the board need gear that coincides with tank gear.  I want to have a robe that decreases my casting time, or makes my mana pool more efficient, or increases the damage of my spells, SOMETHING to allow me to keep up.<P>Resistances-have you ever landed any type of hit on Innorruuk? Ever? Ever?  The answer is probably no.<P>Until all those things are fixed, I refuse to play a magician.  All casters are broken with the advent of Kunark and Velious, but magicians are the most pathetic of the lot.  After 50, we are reduced to a support wizard, and a bad one at that.  At 55, we become a call of the hero mule.<P>What a life we get to lead.

Saethan,<P>I suggest that you time it.  A bard sitting without the mana song running and sitting with the song running will both yield the same times.  The times will vary depending on your mana pool so intelligence and level do matter, but the mana song does not.  In the immortal words of Havatar Lamia:<P>"please, do the homework before taking the test."<P>This code was implemented before they were able to put timers on spells, and it was designed to limit the power of Denon's Desparate Dirge.  The song for those that don't know is a 312 point area of effect which uses 800 mana plus all of the bard's remaining mana.  This song can hardly be considered overly powerful, it should be put on a timer, and bard mana recovery should be fixed.<P>The above is not the point of the post, however.  I mostly object to someone, Disgruntled in this case, telling lies and partial truths about his class in an attempt to draw sympathy.  The fact is there are plenty of ways currently in game for a mage to recover mana faster, he just CHOOSES not to use them (my guess is that he wants to solo) and then wants to whine about it.  Please spare me the tears.<P>Dilbis Xll &lt;Balefire Clan&gt;<BR>52nd Human Bard<BR>Tarew Marr<P>P.S.  Pet classes, rogues, and anyone who can root make awesome partners for a 46+ bard.
