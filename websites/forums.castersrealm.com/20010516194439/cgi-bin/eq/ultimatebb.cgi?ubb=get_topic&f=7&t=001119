Wizard Chain-Casting Sunstrike: 170 DPS<BR>Level 60 monk wielding Bo Staff of Trorsmang, hasted 100%, STR 255: 72 DPS<P>Background... Sunstrike, level 60 wiz nuke, does 1615 damage, 7 sec casting time, with standard 2.5 sec refresh... (1615)/(9.5) = 170.<P>Level 60 Monk, 100% haste (36% haste item, and 65% haste from enchanter spell), wielding Bo Staff of Trorsmang (40/35... yes that's correct, not backwards--DAM 40, DEL 35), with STR 255 via Shammy buffs and Übergear: This is, so far, the single most asskickingest damage output that any melee class can be achieve right now, as far as we know from items that have been discovered.<P>A wizard more than DOUBLES the damage-per-second of the best melee in the game wielding Übergear (Trorsmang drops in Veeshan's Peak).<P>Wizards do now and always shall beat a similar-level melee char in DPS. Exceptions to this include the lower levels, against super-twinks (like a lv 5 Shadow Knight wielding an Ebon Mace [19/24] and Sash of the Dragonborn... he'll probably out-damage a lv 12 wizard on a lv 5 monster, probably not on a lv 12 monster though).<P>Anyway, food for thought. Oh, the only true threat to the Wizard DPS crown--the Mage. In fact, pre-49, Mages with pets will almost always out-pace wizard damage. Ice Comet sorta changes things though... bwuahahaha!!!If you want to see a chart, I did a full-out comparison about a year ago, factoring in refresh times, casting times, and pet DPS. I'll post it if I get 2 people interested, hehe...<P>--------------------<P>51 Channeller :: Simryd "Your-target-resisted-Tishan's-Clash" L'Drael, Erudite Wizard of Quellious<BR>44 CLE :: Ulanji, High Elf Cleric of Tunare<BR>30 NEC :: Quokuus Jhuoroq, Human Plaguebringer of Bertoxxulous<BR>24 MNK :: Xodien Lo'Jong, Disciple of the Ashen Order<BR>14 SHD :: Sujata, Iksar Dark Knight of Cazic Thule<BR>12 RNG :: Kujatta, Human Patron of the Stormbringer<BR>*****************<BR>:: "Eschew Obfuscation" ::

I was under the impression that dual wielding the best 1h weapons always outdamages the best 2h weapons, and rogues should outdamage monks when attacking from behind because of backstab.<P><BR>The main concern of wizards is not short term DPS, it's <B>average</B> DPS which is about 33 DPS with med, clarity 2, and best bard song casting solist's ice spear without resists, assuming the accepted value of 25 mana per tick meditation is accurate. I have no clue of an average DPS figure that accounts for resists, though.<P>Arlina

regarding 1h vs. 2h...<P>It depends on the equipment. Basically, there are three phases...<P>Phase 1: level 1 to 30 or so. During this period, most good 2-hand weapons (Xalgoz, Mith 2-hand, Nasthar, Sentry Maul, Adamantite Bo, etc.) will outdamage a pair of 1-handed weapons. The reason: Dual Wield skill is still to low to be of consequence, and the damage bonus hasn't kicked in yet.<P>Phase 2: Level 30 to 50 or so. During this period, Dual Wield skills are increasing, and the added damage bonus from the inherent low delay of most 1-handed weapons means that 1-handed damage output will be better than 2-handed.<P>Phase 3: Überweapons start to enter the picture. Examples--The entire line of Velium weapons from Dragon Necropolis (eg. Tempered Velium Claidhmore (32/35)), also the Tranquil Staff (29/30 effect: 100-point damage stun), Runed Fighter's Staff (19/20), Peacebringer (28/30), Ton Po's Bo Stick of Understanding (44/40), and of course, the Bo Staff of Trorsmang (40/35). All of these will be better than a vast majority of the Über 1-handers. <P>For comparison, the Celestial Fists (monk epic) turn the monk fists into a 14/18 weapon. So, a monk using bare knuckles with the epic is, in effect, dual-wielding 14/18 weapons (for comparison: the warrior epic swords are both 14/24). I've seen several monks compare damage output of epic fists against the Tranquil Staff (2-hander; 29/30). They were nearly identical in damage output. So, take out the 29/30 staff, and sub in a 40/35 staff, and you have the single most damaging melee-dealer on Norrath. If you disagree with that, just go ask any member of FoH or Afterlife what their monks use. Bo Staff of Trorsmang--I guarantee.<P>Anyway...<P>I understand what you're saying, Arlina. The overall DPS from fight-to-fight of any damage-dealing caster will likely be lower than all the melee classes. Such is the price we pay for the speed and immediate power of the nukes.<P>Here's what wizards REALLY are in most XP-hunt groups: <P>- 3rd rate damage dealers over time. (the sticking point everyone obsesses about)<BR>- First rate killers when something needs to die NOW. (don't de-value this)<BR>- Snarers. (PLEASE don't forget this--if you're a wizard and you're the only source of snaring, SNARE by God!)<BR>- Secondary Crowd Control (rooting mezzed mobs so 'chanter doesn't get whacked)<BR>- XP insurance (evac) (this is very important--try averaging the efficiency of a non-evac group that pulls a hair faster with a mage but gets wiped out even once)<BR>- Spell-casting interrupters (stuns--eventually you get many spell interrupting nukes/stuns... lv 20 you get 2, one at 29, 1 at 49, 1 at 51--trust me: preventing that damn seahorse from CH'ing itself HELPS EFFICIENCY)<BR>- Secondary Damage Shield casters (yeah I know it's only 5 points at lv 34, but it adds up)<BR>- Odd bag-o-tricks. Ever try solo-pulling pulling Xalgoz with a full church pop? Wiz can do it, using Bind Sight. Ever try pulling Phinegel Autropos to the zone so CR is easier if you get wiped out? Wiz can do it, using Eye of Zomm and Gate.<P>Wizards rock!<P>--------------------<P>51 Channeller :: Simryd "Your-target-resisted-Tishan's-Clash" L'Drael, Erudite Wizard of Quellious<BR>44 CLE :: Ulanji, High Elf Cleric of Tunare<BR>30 NEC :: Quokuus Jhuoroq, Human Plaguebringer of Bertoxxulous<BR>24 MNK :: Xodien Lo'Jong, Disciple of the Ashen Order<BR>14 SHD :: Sujata, Iksar Dark Knight of Cazic Thule<BR>12 RNG :: Kujatta, Human Patron of the Stormbringer<BR>*****************<BR>:: "Eschew Obfuscation" ::

I see your math for the wizards DPS, but I don't see anything for the monk.  Does this include the monks special attacks?  Thunder Kick?  How long can a monk keep dealing this damage on an uber (250,000+ hit point) monster?  How long can the wizard keep up the damage?<P>--------------------<P>Cheers,<BR> - Daemonn Venator 56th level wizard<BR> - Roghan 50th level paladin

To Simryd <P>Ok let have some more fun with DPS.<P>We will use the situation you sugested and compare the monk doing 72DPS ( no misses no reduced damage ), and the wizard using Sun Strike ( with no full or partial resist and no fizzles or interupts and no death do to mob agro from chain casting ).<P>Now I will asume the monk had full buffs, 255 str and uber equipment, and I will assume the wizard has 200 int giving him 2520 mana and he also has clarity II so his regen rate is 39 mana per 6 seconds giving him a regen from oom to FM time of 6 min 24 second.<P>Now my comparison will use your stats under the perfect situation you sugested, in a one hour time frame where fights last 1 min and pull take one min to bring in. We will assume that both the wizard and the monk will start fighting emmediatly untill the mob dies.<P>Wizard<BR>can cast sun strike 6 times in 60 second ( we will ignore the fact that he would actuall by oom after 5 cast and though in the 6th just to make the wiz oom. mana cost would be 6 X 450 = 2700 )<P>The total damage for 6 cast would be 6 X 1615 = 9690dmg<P>The casting time would be 57 seconds.<P>The med time to get back to FM is 6min 27 seconds ( with clarity II on, it would be about 14 min without it )<P>Total time from fist chain cast to next chain cast is 57 sec + 6 min 27 sec = 7 min 24 seconds ( DPS of the wizard is 21.82DPS if you were to use this time )<P>What this means is that the wizard can chain cast 60 min / 7 min 24 sec = 8.11 times. we will though in 1 extra cast of Sun Strike to make up for the 0.11 .<P>So the wizards total damage for one hour would be (8 X 9690) + 1615 = 79135 dmg<P><BR>Now lets do the monk using the 72dps.<P>Now assuming a one min pull time and one min fight time the monk only dose damage every other minut so his total damage per hour would be<P>30 min X 60 sec X 72 dps = 129600 dmg<P>OK let compare total damage over the hour<P>monk = 129600 dmg<BR>wiz =  79135 dmg<P>Now you tell me who will kill more mobs and is more valuable to a group. Is it the wizard who does only 60% of the monks damage under perfect sercomstances and is easily killed, or the monk who can protect other group members, do significantly more damage and can take some real punishment.

Wow, thanks for the replies all!  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>The 72 DPS DID factor in Flying Kick, btw.  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"><P>Woe...<P>"monk = 129600 dmg<BR>wiz = 79135 dmg"<P>Sweet! That's not quite as disparate as I had imagined.  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"> Now, you forgot to factor in one thing--the 45 minutes of downtime the group had to endure trudging back to the dungeon because they chose a monk over a wizard when they got overwhelmed and couldn't evacuate. Oh, and the 15 minutes of downtime caused by resurrection, re-buffing, and getting the cleric back to FoM. Oh, and the 30 minutes or so it will take to regain the experience the group lost. Now let's re-do that efficiency model!  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"> EQ is a wacky world, difficult to reduce down to a simple equation.<P>Arlina, the above example is considering an UBER-melee. A majority of level 60 monks don't have the Bo Staff of Trorsmang. Heck, nobody on my server has broken Veeshan's Peak yet (Saryrn). So, tone that figure down to 110,000 for a regular lv 60 monk, maybe 100,000 for a regular lv 60 warrior. It's a wee bit of an exaggeration to say wizards only deal 1/3 of Warrior damage, even in nonstop pulling groups.  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"><P>Like I said, in continuous pull groups, wizards are 3rd-rate damage dealers. <P>- Rogues and Monks are the primary damage dealers. <BR>- Warriors, Rangers, Shadow Knights, Paladins, and Pets (if they're an option) are the secondary damage dealers. <BR>- Wizards, Magicians, Necros, Shamans, or Druids (depending on group config, hunting environ) can all be 3rd rate damage dealers. <BR>- Bards are 4th rate damage-dealers (*chuckles* sorry had to toss that in there. ;>... ever seen a bard melee?--wohooo!!)<P>You'll notice the overlapping nature of Mages and Necros. Yes, if pets are an option, Mages and Necros are the damage kings, plain and simple. If they're not (A majority of dungeon hunting, credit poor pathing and shoddy AI), then they're in the 3rd tier along with Wizards.<P>Now...<P>Can a monk root?<BR>Can a monk stun?<BR>Can a monk cast a stackable damage shield? (wiz DS stacks with Mage AND Druid DS)<BR>Can a monk snare?<BR>Can a monk do 2240 damage 14 seconds when necessary? (double-Comet)<BR>Can a monk evacuate the group?<P>Melee is boring--it's plodding, brainless, repetetive damage. Think of the tanks as our slaves. They pull to us, the absorb hits for us, and when they're *lucky* we toss in a nuke or two to help out ("thank you sir--may I have another?"), hehe. But seriously... melee/heal/melee/heal... this is the core *thing* in dungeons. Once you have that covered. You can start getting fancy. You can pull 5 mobs, have the enchanter keep them all mezzed, have the wizard keep them all rooted so they don't jump the chanter when mez breaks, snare them all at once with the wiz, nuke something down FAST when it jumps the healer and won't get off, stun that caster... So many things that a dumb-butt tank cannot do ("AAAHH!! Not a Ranger Nuke!! AHHHH!!") ("AHHH!! I pulled 4 mobs--I guess we're all screwed!") etc etc etc.<P>Here's the schtick--in high-pull groups, wizards' role is NOT to be primary damage dealer in every fight. Once you get over that and can deal with it, you'll start to dig the class. You'll start to appreciate how useful the unique package of things that the wizard has truly is to groups. <P>You sacrifice consistent damage, and in exchange you get:<P>- The speediest damage in the game<BR>- Evacutation insurance<BR>- Root (better than druid/ranger root since it doesn't break mez)<BR>- Stun (any stun is good stun, I have 5 spell-interrupts at lv 51)<BR>- Snare (possibly the single spell that saved our class--Bonds of Force)<BR>- Quad-kiting capabilities. If you haven't given this a shot yet, and you don't have JBoots, partner up with a Druid and have a go at it--the feeling of sheer power is ridiculous... I just hit 51, and I see:<P>You begin casting Pillar of Frost<BR>A Raptor was hit by non-melee for 755<BR>A Raptor was hit by non-melee for 755<BR>A Raptor was hit by non-melee for 755<BR>A Raptor was hit by non-melee for 755<P>I mean...

So, you cast Bind Sight on one of the skellies in front of the church. Then, you use F9 to change perspective, navigate around to where you can see Xalgoz, and click on him to get him in your target bar. Once you have him in your target bar, you can nuke from behind the church (this wall you can nuke through for some reason).

One last thought for the night...<P>Last night, our Warrior (read: dumb@ss  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">, even though he is lv 54) pulls 5 Greater Kobolds to the zone in Sol B. "Just hang tight for a couple minutes while I get rid of 'em," he says.<P>P'shaw!!!<P>I stand up, hop into the corner, and unleash 2 supernovae... totalling nearly 8000 damage in less than 20 seconds. Needless to say that train was toast, hehe. Yeah, it sapped more than half of my mana bar, but we were waiting around anyway--for our rogue to run back so he could drag his own corpse and a few others to the zone, so we had downtime to play with. That, my friends, was FUN--last time I read, FUN was what this game was all about!  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>Oh, and in case you're curious... one Supernova will destroy the ENTIRE shadowed men camp in South Karana... I about died laughing when I tried it.  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" border="0"> <P>BOOOOOOOMMMM!!!!!!<P>If you check out <A HREF="http://www.graffe.com," TARGET=_blank>www.graffe.com,</A>  somewhere in the archives there is a screenshot of some folks using the lv 59 wizard point-blank nuke... ONE cast did 8000+ damage, for around 300 mana. Get yourself two other crazy wizards, two enchanters, and a cleric to pull (you read right!), and just watch all the monks, warriors, and rogues looking around murmuring...

To Simryd <P>If you want to make comparisons you cant switch back and forth between perfect situtaions and "real" ( I use the quotation marks to indicate EQ is not real, sometimes I forget LOL   <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" border="0"> )situations in the game. You were comparing perfect sinarios with no reduced damage for the monk or the wizard. When you saw the wizard still lost damage wise over an hour you want to use real in game situations to add value to the wizard class. Well in the real situation a wizard chain casting would die from the agro generated, he would never get in 3 casts let alone 6 casts before he was beaten do death by the mobs. However the monk can do he 72dps ( reduced for misses and non max damage hits of course ) to every mob for the whole duration of the fight since he is more equiped to handle the mobs agro in the first place. Further more if you had another tank instead of a wizard your group would be less likely to get overwhelmed in the first place. Also you forgot to mention how most group break up after an evac becuase they dont want to spend 45 min trudging back to the dungeon.<P>A note on evacs, they look good on paper but the rarly work out in practice. This is becuase it is hard to get 2 ppl to agree on something let alone 6 ppl. I have never evaced and had all 5 other member be happy that they lived; there is alway at least one who is very vocal about how unhappy he is and thinks we could have survieved the encounter. Also most groups do not want you to evac at all. I have only evaced 5 times total; each time I only did it when someone else in the group asked for it, and all 5 times the group broke up becuase of it. All it take is one or 2 of the key members to quit the group becuase they dont want to fight there way back to the pull spot and the group disapears. In my experiance caster usualy apriciate the evac ( becuase we die so easily ) but tanks and hybrids almost never can agree that an evac was nessasary ( untill the die ofcorse and then they want to know why you didnt evac ).<P>The bottome line when a pick up group is being fromed, the first 4 spots are prity much pre determined if you want to be sucess full.<P>1. Tanks ( a monk or a warrior is prefered ).<BR>2. Healer ( cleric is prefered )<BR>3. Mana Regenerator ( Enchanter is prefered )<BR>4. Buffer ( Shamen is best buffer, but a druid can buff and act as a secondary healer )<P>Now the other 2 spots could be filled in by just about any class becuase you already have the main components of a sucessfull group, how ever if you want to be most efficent you will get two more tanks.<P>5. ) Depends on what you got for you number one tank. If you got a warriorfor defence then get a monk for pulling. If you started with a monk, get a warrior.<P>6. ) Rogue for fast and masive damage damage.<P>You could also use hybrids for the 5 and 6 spots, but they will be less effective than pure tanks. <P>Do you notice what is not mentioned in these group compositions?<P>Its the wizard, mag and necro. They do not add to a group, they reduce efficency and leach mana from the healer and buffer that could be better used on a tank. They dont do enough damage to pay for there up keep. <P>The only reason to invite a wizard is if your group can alreay more than handle any mob you are pulling and you just them to speed up fights. The only problem with this is that the wizard does not speed up fights enough to make up for the exp he draining from the group on every pull ( with his down time he is actually slowing down the rate you get exp over a one hour time frame). Even in this situation you would be better off just leaving an open spot than inviting a wizard.<P>By the way thank you for you response to my post on wizard ballance, I added the site you listed to my favorites list.  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">

My experiences, regarding evacs...<P>I've probably used evac 15 to 20 times total since I began playing. maybe on 5 or 6 of them, I'd have a group member whine, "we could have survived." It was up to me to point out all the factors involved, and that there was no way on God's Green earth we were going to live, and that I just saved us all a huge headache. I always managed to convince them I was right. Folks just don't pay attention to things sometimes... you have to remind them that it's NOT GOOD that the cleric has 10 mana, and the group just got 2 adds, with the 'chanter at 20 mana and the tanks all under 2 bubbles of health. etc... Yes, it takes good timing to be a good evacuator, but you have to stand up for yourself when you evac--better safe than sorry.<P>I'm about to start another post, focusing on why a wizard is so useful. Rather than hone in on one specific issue, I'll be taking a global view on things.

For those who STILL don't get it...<P>Wizards are built to kill multiple mobs AT THE SAME TIME.  We are optimized for that and suck at everything else.  Now, you have a choice...<P>1)  Continue to whine about being crappy for single target continous killing, or<P>2)  Start doing some AoE and have more fun and get more XP than you ever have in EQ.<P>It's up to you.

Something to add in to this discussion to throw a wrench into it.<P>The damage coming from the Wizard (a Good Wizard) is free damage. No heals, no haste, to str/dex/agil buffs, no hp regen, no stamina refreshing, no damage shields, and all it takes to sustain a wizard is Clarity of some sort, and with luck a Bard. Meanwhile that Monk/Rogue/Tank is out there sucking mana like a Vacume from the Clerics, Shamans, Druids, and Enchanters. Those Melee guys come at a hefty price of downtime for everyone in the party. Sure that monk could sustain constant fighting like that, but only with 2 or 3 people backing him up at the same time. The Wizard is barely noticedable in mana drain on the group. Infact a group with a Wizard would notice an extreme Decrease in downtime compared to adding in any other class.<P>Now put this into your calcutaions:<BR>Single pull safe area both level 60.<P>Monk Solo no buffs no help:<P>Wizard Solo no buffs no help:<P>No way a monk could keep up with the wizard over an hour. They would have way too much downtime for HP's then wizards would for mana. Not only that, the Monk couldn't down the mob before getting their ass literally handed to them in time.<P>Fact is, the Wizard saves everyone time. And we all know EQ isn't about anything else but saving TIME.<P>--------------------<P>Baelzharon Hopeslayer<BR>Wizard of the 54th Book of Power<BR>BANG! BOOM! POOF!, Done! "WTF" you looking at?

One thing I wanted to comment on:<P>someone said<BR>"- Bards are 4th rate damage-dealers (*chuckles* sorry had to toss that in there. ;>... ever seen a bard melee?--wohooo!!)"<P>While Bard melee is nothing to brag about, it is about middle of the pack for all classes.

Very good post Bael.<P>We have to remember--when a tank is dealing damage in a group, his contribution must be divided by 2 (assuming a 1:1 ratio of melee:healers). Why? Becase all the damage he is contributing requires 2 people--himself, and the healer to support him. A wizard's damage is for him and him alone. So, you have to factor that in. <P>I've chosen to sum it up by the following equation (here we go again!! wohooo!!)  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" border="0"><P>To "pull his weight," a Wizard only has to do [T/(T + H))] times the average damage output of all the tanks within a group with H healers, and T tanks.<P>1 healer and 1 tank...<BR>[1/(1+1)] = 1/2 or 50% of the average tank damage.<P>1 healer and 2 tanks...<BR>[2/(2+1)] = 2/3 or 67% of the average tank damage.<P>1 healer and 3 tanks...<BR>[3/(3+1)] = 3/4 or 75% of the average tank damage.<P>Food for thought!  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" border="0">

I'd just like to comment that I'm not convinced that 72 DPS is the upper bound for monk damage. I've heard a lot more reports listing higher damage than that for a warrior, and monks are supposed to do more.  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>I'd need to see some independant confirmation before I accept that figure.<P>Also, rogues supposedly do significantly more damage (from behind) than monks, so 72 DPS isn't the upper bound on melee damage.<P>Arlina

The lv 60 monk, wielding Trorsmang, 255 STR, 100% haste, maxed 2hblunt... was fighting the Shady Swashbuckler in the EC tunnel to N Ro. That NPC is lv 49 or so. I bet if that same monk had been fighting a Treant or somesuch, he would have surely gotten closer to 85 or 90 DPS. Target defense comes into play here of course.  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">

To Bethude <P>Regarding AoE groups.<P>Well if you can do AoE groups on a regular basis, I think that is great. I wish I could, but I have to rely on pick up groups if I want to play the game. People arent exactally lining up to do AoE groups. It takes a lot of convincing to get 1 person to try an AoE pull let alone 5 ppl. Is it fare to say that wizards are ballanced becuase they can do lots of AoE damage but only if they can get in AoE groups in specalized zones. Another thing to remember is that AoE group require pritty spacific classes to be sucessfull and the most important member the enchanter almost always dies at least once ( and unless you also have a cleric to rez the they usualy arent to happy about paying 10 to 15 hours of exp just so a couple of wizards can feel powerfull for an hour or so).

To Baelzharon <P>Regarding wizards speeding up EXP.<P>Wizards never speed up exp, they can speed up one fight but not the rate you get exp. The exp you get is equal to the mobs you kill per hour and the mobs you kill is directly preportional to the damage you do as a group over a one hour time frame. Any tank can do at least 2 times the damage of a wizard over a one hour time frame ( in a group anyway ). This means more mobs are killed and more exp is gained.<P>Regarding Tanks sucking mana from healers and buffers.<P>The only time a tank sucks mana out of a healer is when there is an over pull. In the post 50 game when buffers have realy mana efficent group buffs, they can act as a buffer and nuker; buffer dont go oom from buffing they go oom from nuking ( and they do the nuking job almost as well as a wizard would ).<P>Regarding wizards damage being free and always being FM.<P>Well if you are always FM that is becuase you are only nukeing and being very conservitive ( which you must do inorder to be in any way effective in a post 50 group ). However the pitance of damage you are doing is not speeding up the fight becuase a tank can do the same damage as your best lvl 60 nuke in 33 seconds( how many post lvl 50 fights take less than one min ).<P>Lets use this criteria for an example<P>A tank is doing 50dps ( this is a low estimate for a lvl 60 tank )<P>Lets pretend that you regen mana fast enough that you can cast Sunstrike once per round and never go oom. <P>Wizards damage per round would be 1650<P>Now how long does it take the tank to do 1650 damage<P>Time = 1650 / 50 dps = 33 seconds.<P>OK now lets examing a group with you a healer, a enchanter a buffer, and 2 tanks.<P>Each tank dose 50 dps<P>Assume that the other casters are only supporting tanks and doing no damage.<P>Every fight you cast once and reduce a mobs hp by 1650<P>The average pull has 6000hp<P>once you cast the mobs hp is reduced to 4350.<P>Now the tanks are doing 50dps each that is 100 dps a second.<P>The total fight time would be :<P>Time = 4350 / 100dps = 43.5 seconds.<P><BR>Now lets look at the fight time of the same group using another tank instead of the wizard.<P>group consists of 3 tanks, a healer, and enchanter, and a buffer.<P>Casters only support tanks and do no damage.<P>Average mob pulled had 6000 hp<P>Now you did not cast so the tanks have to do all 6000 hp in damage.<P>Each tank does 50dps for a total of 150dps combined.<P>Time to kill mob is :<P>Time = 6000 / 150dps = 40 seconds.<P>Wow the 3 tanks just kill that mob 3.5 seconds faster than they would have with you and 2 tanks.<P>Now consider the fact that with 3 tanks the damage would be dispersed more evenly between tanks and less healing would be needed, buffers using group spells would have no more mana drain than before, and the enchanter would have one less caster to have to clarity and buff. Kills are now happening faster and all casters become more efficent.<P>I saved the best for last. Becuase the tanks are killing the mobs 3.5 seconds faster with out you the will kill aproximatly 13 mobs for every 12 they would have killed if they had taken the wizard instead of the tank( 43.5seconds times 12kills = 522 seconds, now 522 seconds divided by 40 second per kill = 13 kills ). This means that the whole group is is getting 1.08 times the exp it would have gotten with the wizard in the group.<P>Now no wizard can regen mana fast enough to cast sunstrike ever pull in a group that is pulling constantly. That means every time he is oom he does no damage and decreases the group effiecenty even more than he was in this example ( not to mention the fact that I underestimated the tanks dps significantly, and I gave the wizard credit for full damage and no resist to his sunstrike in this example ).<P>A wizard performing better than his best will always be worse than a below average tank.

To Simryd<P>Regarding tanks doing 2 times the damage of wizards.<P>I would agree that a buffed tank should do twice the damage of a unbuffed wizard. The problem is an unbuffed tank does twice the damage of an unbuffed wizard and about 1.3 times the damage of a wizard with clarity II. A buffed tank does 4 to 6 times the damage of an unbuffed wizard and about 3 to 5 times the damage of a wizard with clarity II ( depending on the tanks class and equipment ).

Wizards need to be able to do a HUGE amount of damage in a hurry and about equal the damage a melee caster does over time.<P>If they aren't both true (if you have the first you will have the second) then Wizards are not useful to the group.  <P>The fast damage is to give our class their value, their use.  _Every_ caster class has direct damage, in order to be a class that focusses on DD one must be able to stand out and Verant has stated this is the way they want Wizards to.<P>If Wizards cannot contribute enough damage sustained over the time (in short bursts) to equal the damage any other class can put out, then in 99% of the situations (when you don't need that fast burn down) the group is better off with any class that CAN bring that sustained damage.<P>Resistances, fizzles, and aggro also contribute to this need, because a Wizard is uniquely crippled by all three due to the direct need for mana to affect anything.  If a Wizard is limited more than any other caster by these three things they require a manner to contribute that is uniquely compensatory for these lackings.  At present this simply is not so.<P>Wizards blast, stun, AE, evac, root, and snare.  A druid can do every single one of those tasks except stun... and they compensate for that by adding heals, damage shields, buffs, and even debuffs.  Consider how Wizards have ONE stun spell until level 49 and you see a problem, eh?<P>Oh, and Simryd, in 60 levels I evacced 7 times, don't tell me that's so critical, the higher level I got the less people wanted an Evac and the less often it was needed.  Maybe in a group of idiots and Ebayers you will need it a lot but I don't GROUP with idiots.

Something I left off.<P>When people read this, they will say "sure, that's how it should be, Wizards should do more damage than anyone else per second.  I agree, this is a good thing."<P>In your analysis, at level 60 (ignoring all previous levels, where, for example at level 59, the Wizard doesn't DO 170 dps, and the monk does his damage still; and ignoring rogues can and will actually outdamage monks), the Monk does 72 dps and the Wizard does 170.<P>Now, this looks good initially, when you examine the classes and think "that's neat, the Wizard does about 2 1/2 times the damage, he's contributing well!"<P>But there's a problem, and that is what's being left out of this optomistic analysis:<P>Aggro and mana cost.  IF a Wizard chain casted doing this damage level in a fight, then they would quickly be summoned and killed, or if by some bizarre incredible gap in coding and programming bug the Wizard DID NOT get obliterated, they are out of mana in about half a dozen casts (depending how well equipped and how many specialization checks went well).<P>The Aggro means the Wizard can NOT cast continuously like this, and as such can NEVER give the damage per second ratio that you suggest.  Due to the need to control aggro and actually remain BELOW the warrior taunt level, Wizards have to refrain from casting for long periods of time, and use less powerful blasts to try to contribute.<P>When the Wizard is out of mana he contributes NOTHING to the group, absolutely zero, zip, nada, which means his contribution WITH mana has to be so significant that it makes up for this total lack of action.<P>So we come down to the Wizard doing much less, probably a third that damage per second because he can't cast his biggest blast EVERY SECOND to kill the monster.  I left off fizzles and resists totally with this example, because I'm leaving off misses and assuming max damage for the monk too.<P>Now does the Wizard doing about 55 dps sound reasonable and good to everyone?  Simryd?  Because that's closer to what he'll actually contribute.  Then when he's out of mana he contributes ZERO damage per second.<P>Meanwhile, the Monk is tearin away, he does 72 dps in this ideal examination because that's all monks do in a fight, hit things, and they don't stop until they are dead or feign death.  Since they don't do catastrophic damage in one horrendous burst, and have higher hps, AC, and damage avoidance than a Wizard, they are not nearly as affected by aggro as the Wizard.<P>And when the Wizard meditates, the Monk continues to hit the target for 72 dps.<P>55 vs 72.  0 vs 72.  Does this look fine to you?<P>By the way, that same Wizard at level 59 using his best spell and in the magical faerie tail world of no aggro etc does a whopping 132 damage per second with Lure of Frost.<P>Give a level 30 monk his best weapons and haste and see how much damage he does?  The Wizard never EVER can do more DPS than his spells dictate, twinking does NOTHING for that.

Mandingo...<P>Three things<P>First, I don't group with idiots. I do group with an ambitious set of folks who enjoy challenging their limits. This means we do what most groups can't do, and due to the increased risk that goes along with tackling these challenges (like clearing all of HS South Wing, nobody above lv 53), we find we have to evac sometimes. Please don't flame. Just because you don't evac often doesn't mean it's a categorically useless ability. <P>Second... aggro. They should put the following on page 1 of the EQ manual--"If you are going to nuke a monster, wait until it is half dead prior to casting." <P>When both a warrior and a rogue have been working a mob down to half, and you chain cast Ice Comet (or draught or whatever else), you will likely end up dealing the most damage. However, the mob will never jump you. Case-in-point: Rock Golem in the Hole. Has well over 6k hps. I waited until half dead, whipped out 3 Comets, which still didn't kill it. Guess what? It didn't jump me. And I had done majority damage.<P>The insane DPS of wiz nukes is usually important on mobs that need to die, and die now, and we didn't realize it until just now due to a couple of adds. Am I right? So, 2240 damage in 15 seconds isn't fast? 3230 damage in 16.5 seconds isn't fast? okaaaaay...<P>As I've said on this thread and others, Wizards are 3rd-rate damage over time, and 1st-rate speedy damage. But you know what? You could take away the entire line of wizard direct damage spells and they'd still be useful. Remove every last nuke. Guess what? They can still snare. Snaring is 100% mandatory in any group that knows their @ss from a hole in the ground. It is such an important thing, that you could have one member do nothing but that and it would help out immensely. Maybe not in train-central (Karnors) where nobody gives a rat's @ss about playing correctly--oops forgot to snare again and we got 3 adds... "Train to Zone!" Oops, i FD'd right in front of your group--I wonder why those dogs attacked you? But in any real hunting group that goes past zone-camping, snaring is life-or-death proposition. And if your group is going to be ballsy and push deep to challenge it's limits, evac is pretty dang important too.<P>Sure, as a wiz there are some mobs I never nuke. I don't need to. And that's fine. And, as a result, my damage-over-time contribution is smaller than all the melee'rs in my group. Guess what? It doesn't matter to me. And, it doesn't matter to any group that knows everything a wizard can do. If you sub a monk in for a wiz, I would venture to guess that you could pull maybe 3 or 4 more mobs per hour, assuming you had snare covered. This is under controlled circumstances. However... the fact that wizards can root helps the 'chanter immensely at crowd control (which in turn helps the cleric). The fact that they can snare means if you have a group of 5 non-snarers a wizard will help out immensely. The fact that they can evac means you can challenge your limits and push in deeper than you'd otherwise dare.<P>Yadda-yadda... I'm talking in circles now, hehe.<P>Anyway, like I said on another thread... if wizards weren't the 5th most desired class on raids, I might grant you that they are broken. If they offered *nothing* to compensate them for the fact that they are 3rd rate dealers of damage-over-time, I would agree that they are broken. If they couldn't solo faster than any class in the game during some level ranges (quad-kiting anyone?), I might say they were broken.<P>Unbalanced? Yes. Broken? No.<P>Paz.<P>--------------------<P>51 Channeller :: Simryd "Your-target-resisted-Tishan's-Clash" L'Drael, Erudite Wizard of Quellious<BR>44 CLE :: Ulanji, High Elf Cleric of Tunare<BR>30 NEC :: Quokuus Jhuoroq, Human Plaguebringer of Bertoxxulous<BR>24 MNK :: Xodien Lo'Jong, Disciple of the Ashen Order<BR>14 SHD :: Sujata, Iksar Dark Knight of Cazic Thule<BR>12 RNG :: Kujatta, Human Patron of the Stormbringer<BR>*****************<BR>:: "Eschew Obfuscation" ::

First off wizards must not be doing as much as all melees for the sake of balance. I will not debate this on this thread because I don't want to hijack it; if you disagree please start a new thread in this forum on the topic.<P>Resistances and fizzles are no more a crippling of the wizard class than STR and mob AC are a crippling of a melee class. Resistance and fizzle rates were tuned along with spell efficiency to give nuking classes the proper efficiency, and allow increases in this efficiency by outside effects such as your Evocation skill or a resistance debuff.<P>Arlina

""Second... aggro. They should put the following on page 1 of the EQ manual--"If you are going to nuke a monster, wait until it is half dead prior to casting.""<P>"And how, precisely, is that different than what I said?"<P>It's not. I re-read your post, and we're on the same page here. Sorry for misinterpreting. I was feeling a bit hostile after being accused of grouping with idiots.<P>"Your DPS has been reduced by waiting all that time, hasn't it? You had all that time to cast and DID NOT which means you did no damage per second whatsoever."<P>Yes, which is why I wrote...<P>"The insane DPS of wiz nukes is usually important on mobs that need to die, and die now, and we didn't realize it until just now due to a couple of adds..."<P>Here's what I mean--your group is killing something, and suddenly several mobs jump in (via train, pop, roamer, whatever). NOW is when DPS really matters. You have to get through the next series of fights ASAP, after which you'll have time to recover. A monk, warrior, or whoever else is capped far under 100 DPS. A wizard can double their DPS in THAT timeframe--i.e. the time when DPS SUDDENLY MATTERS. In critical situations like this, the high DPS doubles both as damage-dealing and damage prevention--dead mobs can't hurt you. <P>Of course... each time you need to wait for tank-aggro to build up. However, you seem to think that this implies that a wizard will never be able to surpass tank damage without being aggroed... which is not true from my experience. This is why I wrote:<P>"When both a warrior and a rogue have been working a mob down to half, and you chain cast Ice Comet (or draught or whatever else), you will likely end up dealing THE MOST damage. However, the mob will never jump you. "<P>Well, maybe sometimes it will... but not usually, from my experience.<P>At the core of this idea is the following thesis: "While a wizard has mana, his group is capable of significantly higher short-term DPS than the group would be if it had a melee class instead of the wizard." It's all about having the *ability* to pull out the stops when needed. Not residing in a continuous state of a nuking extravaganza.<P>Let me know if I can explain this point any better.<P>"Further, burning something dead that is snared is idiotic and a waste of mana, its just standing there LET IT DIE."<P>Agreed. However, until it's given up the fight, it keeps on fighting even when snared. The faster you can get it to it's "running-for-my-life" mentality, the better... no? I almost NEVER cast a killing nuke. Ever. Exceptions being room-breaks and the like.<P>"Lastly, if you wait til the monster is half dead before casting you not only look useless to the group but you aren't stunning when you should, will use up your mana too fast (cast cast cast cast ok guys LOM gotta med through this fight), and lastly by doing that you still don't neccessarily control aggro... they might still turn on you as Im sure you know."<P>If I a mob is slowed, I almost never stun, unless it's a caster. Otherwise, I do stun from time to time for dmg prevention. <P>I can toss in 2 draughts on most every pull, sometimes a draught and a Comet or 3 draughts. Yes, on most of the stuff we pull, I'm being outdamaged by the Rogue and Warrior in my group. However, on room-break situations, I ALWAYS outdamage everyone on the first several mobs to help spread out room pops. I might get jumped *occasionally* by monsters that earn 4 or 5 draughts, but it's never a big deal--at most one round of melee and the warrior has him off me. Anyway, there's yet another situation for you where wizards outshine melee--*control*. We can decide which mobs die when and how quickly, by virtue of our nukes (yes, I am aware that other casters can do this too, but this whole series of threads seems geared to pit melee vs. wizard).<P>"Saying a Wizard with out any DD would be useful to a group is the most patently idiotic thing I have ever laid eyes on."<P>IF snare is useful, THEN any class that can cast snare is useful. Note--I am not saying MORE useful than other snaring classes with all their spells. I'm just saying, "useful." If you had 5 non-snaring people in a group, none of whom could snare, and you found some strange person who could ONLY snare and do nothing else, that person would be of great value to the group. Am I wrong? Would you keep the "snare-only" person out of your group if your group couldn't snare and there was nobody else around? Of course not. Therefore, snaring is important enough to warrant doling 1/6 of a group's experience to that function alone if need be.<P>"...How many classes have snare? Druid, Ranger, Necromancer, Shadow Knight, Bard, Wizard. Dang, that snare is sure gonna turn the day huh?"<P>YES it will! First off, necro and SK snares do damage, so they are less useful than the rest (mez break). Secondly, it may sound far-fetched, but sometimes there are no Druids, Rangers, or Bards around! If you're there, and they aren't, then you will be highly needed. Am I right?<P>"...HOw bout root? ALL those classes but bard have root, plus Enchanter, Magician (through pet), Cleric, Paladin, hell even melee classes can root and snare through items and poisons."<P>Yes. And all those things are useful. I was merely trying to emphasize, by means of an absurd extreme, that wizards are useful simply by virtue of the fact that they can *have* these useful spells. I was not attempting to say that they are more or less valuable than the other classes that share these spells. (although wizards are the only class that has both a non-damaging snare AND a non-damaging root, hehe  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"> )<P>"I agree Wizards aren't broken but you are trying to say the damage level is fine, and its not."<P>Pre-49 I agree with you Mandingo--the damage level needs some work. Post-50 looks better so far. Check back with me in 9 levels though, hehe  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"><P>"You are trying to say the Wizard brings so much to a group and they DON'T."<P>'Tis truly a matter of opninion. Personally, I think that any class that can bring snare, root, spell-interruption, evacuation, and the fastest & most efficient direct damage spells in the game to a group is bringing a good deal of usefulness. Your opinion seems to be that all of this amounts to zilch. I think it amounts to [(7+zilch)/((squat+2)*27)], or 61. 61... now that's deep.  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"><P>Paz.<P>--------------------<P>51 Channeller :: Simryd "Your-target-resisted-Tishan's-Clash" L'Drael, Erudite Wizard of Quellious<BR>44 CLE :: Ulanji, High Elf Cleric of Tunare<BR>30 NEC :: Quokuus Jhuoroq, Human Plaguebringer of Bertoxxulous<BR>24 MNK :: Xodien Lo'Jong, Disciple of the Ashen Order<BR>14 SHD :: Sujata, Iksar Dark Knight of Cazic Thule<BR>12 RNG :: Kujatta, Human Patron of the Stormbringer<BR>*****************<BR>:: "Eschew Obfuscation" ::

yes, that's what i've been saying all along, a tank's damage is NOT his own, it is as much the healer's damage -- a wizard is a self-sufficient, punch-packing, damage-dealing fiend, and pays for the incredible power and self-reliance with downtime... of course with area effect spells however, downtime is irrelevant

"Of course... each time you need to wait for tank-aggro to build up. However, you seem to think that this implies that a wizard will never be able to surpass tank damage without being aggroed."<P>Not from my experience either, and I didn't suggest that.  I said sometimes even if you DO wait sometimes the monsters will aggro on you, I think it is the same wierd glitch that makes some monsters randomly aggro on someone and NEVER turn away.<P>"At the core of this idea is the following thesis: "While a wizard has mana, his group is capable of significantly higher short-term DPS than the group would be if it had a melee class instead of the wizard." It's all about having the *ability* to pull out the stops when needed. Not residing in a continuous state of a nuking extravaganza."<P>I agree, the Wizard is wonderful at bringing the boom down fast.  The problem is this: How often is that needed, and when it is needed, how often is it even feasible?  If you are in an emergency, you are in an emergency - no waiting half the life of the target to nuke.  And Aggro + resistances makes even this task a questionable thing.<P>The question then becomes, "Is this a viable class design?" and I really can't say yes to that.<P>"Anyway, there's yet another situation for you where wizards outshine melee--*control*. We can decide which mobs die when and how quickly, by virtue of our nukes (yes, I am aware that other casters can do this too, but this whole series of threads seems geared to pit melee vs. wizard)."<P>Other classes actually do it better, and they handle emergencies better.  Who would you rather have for control and breaking a room: Wizard or Enchanter?  And since emergencies and control is the basis of your entire defense of the class design, that is a problem, isn't it?<P>"IF snare is useful, THEN any class that can cast snare is useful."<P>Not if that's what they bring exclusively.  I know you were overstating to make a point but really, come on  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>"YES it will! First off, necro and SK snares do damage, so they are less useful than the rest (mez break). Secondly, it may sound far-fetched, but sometimes there are no Druids, Rangers, or Bards around! If you're there, and they aren't, then you will be highly needed. Am I right?"<P>Problem is darkness doesn't do damage.  It's just a fancy snare, yeah I used to think it was a DOT too, but its not.<P><BR>""I agree Wizards aren't broken but you are trying to say the damage level is fine, and its not.""<P>"Pre-49 I agree with you Mandingo--the damage level needs some work. Post-50 looks better so far. Check back with me in 9 levels though, hehe"<P>I think it depends on where you hunt.  But there is this problem: The game is designed where the higher level you get, the weaker you are, relative to the monsters.  As a result, as you get higher and higher level, you do less and less damage to the bad guys.  Now, everyone else does this, but they compensate in a wide variety of ways.  But the WIzard has one way of doing damage to a monster: Blasting it.  And since this doesn't persist and eats mana every time, your contribution actually goes down bit by bit.  This is the core of the enraged posts on the general discussion board where people were asking what, exactly, a damage caster was supposed to do on something with more than 100,000 hit points?<P>Monsters get more and more resistances, and they all summon.  This is why Wizards use an AE Rain spell to desparately attempt to make up for the low damage output, because Tears of Druzzil (for example) outdamages Ice Comet if even 2 waves hit.  The post 50 game is really screwed up for all classes but 3: Rogues, Warriors, and Clerics.  Enchanters and Shamans are along as buff vendors, and that's it.<P>"Personally, I think that any class that can bring snare, root, spell-interruption, evacuation, and the fastest & most efficient direct damage spells in the game to a group is bringing a good deal of usefulness. Your opinion seems to be that all of this amounts to zilch." <P>No I think it amounts to not enough for a valid class design.  I don't think a Wizard is useless, I think the class is sub par and needs work.  Not a LOT of work, but a lot of little things that amounts to something big.  There are more little annoying things wrong with this class than any in the game, and the reason is simple: Verant doesn't wanna hear about it.<P>Wizards start out weak and end up roughly the same as everyone else, that's crappy design in a game that is allegedly supposed to be balanced.<P>Wizards have several minor tools, its true, but they are easily replaced by one class: Druid.  And since the Druid can nuke nearly as well as a Wizard in 99% of the situations, PLUS they bring so much more to the group I see a real problem.<P>I think Wizards are almost there.  But I also think they won't ever make it, not ever.<P>"I think it amounts to [(7+zilch)/((squat+2)*27)], or 61. 61... now that's deep." <P>I think that adds up to 42...

Wizards in a group need a tank, healer, and debuffer to be effective.  They aren't any more self sufficient in dealing damage than a Warrior.<P>"But wait!" You say, "what about your soloing!"<P>But that's not damage dealing.  That's movement adjustment.  Wizards can slow their target and not take damage, that's the only reason they can solo.  If they couldn't keep the monster away, they'd die, fast, and bad without any xps past level 5 or so.<P>See people always act as if a cleric healing a tank = a Wizard using mana.  But it doesn't.  First, healing is enormously more mana efficient than damage spells (especially complete heal).  Second, the healer only has to heal ONE tank, not all of them.  There is only one person at a time who will require healing against a given creature.  That means any melee past the first is cake, they are free damage.  Wizards pay for their damage each squeeze of the trigger.<P>And finally there's this: Twinking allows melee classes to increase their damage and use to the group exponentially.  Put the best twink gear in the hands of a Warrior, do the same for a Wizard.  The Warrior just got several factors more powerful, the Wizard does EXACTLY the same damage per second that he did before.  In fact, due to the way mana and stats work for casters, he doesn't have that much more mana.<P>And this means the things that are making problems for high level Wizards are making them MUCH worse for low level WIzards.  That level 20 Wizard who things he's hot stuff with a 169 point blast (when it lands)?  The Warrior next to him can do that much in the 14.8 seconds it takes to cast the next big blast, easily.  In fact with crits and huge weapons, he can do nearly 150 damage in one flurry of attacks.<P>This is where it all comes together: there's a problem at the highest levels with titanic hit point monsters; there are problems at higher levels because of damage per second, and there's problems at the very start because of twinking.<P>And the band plays on....

Regarding wizards speeding up EXP.<P>Recently I found that I was over estimating the average dps a tank can do. Becuase of this I have reposted this calculation based on the revised dps of the tank. Please note that the results were still in favor of taking a tank for damage over taking a wizard.<P>This is the new criteria based on the dps information I have received recently.<P>A tank is doing 30dps ( this is a low estimate for a lvl 60 tank )<P>Lets pretend that you regen mana fast enough that you can cast Sunstrike once per round and never go oom. <P>Wizards damage per round would be 1650<P>Now how long does it take the tank to do 1650 damage<P>Time = 1650 / 30 dps = 55 seconds.<P>OK now lets examin a group with you a healer, a enchanter a buffer, and 2 tanks.<P>Each tank does 30 dps<P>Assume that the other casters are only supporting tanks and doing no damage.<P>Every fight you cast once and reduce a mobs hp by 1650<P>The average pull has 6000hp<P>once you cast the mobs hp is reduced to 4350.<P>Now the tanks are doing 30dps each that is 60 dps a second.<P>The total fight time would be :<P>Time = 4350 / 60dps = 72.5 seconds.<P><BR>Now lets look at the fight time of the same group using another tank instead of the wizard.<P>group consists of 3 tanks, a healer, and enchanter, and a buffer.<P>Casters only support tanks and do no damage.<P>Average mob pulled had 6000 hp<P>Now you did not cast so the tanks have to do all 6000 hp in damage.<P>Each tank does 30dps for a total of 90dps combined.<P>Time to kill mob is :<P>Time = 6000 / 90dps = 66.7 seconds.<P>With these number the 3 tanks just kill that mob 5.8 seconds ( although the over all fight time is still longer in both cases ) faster than they would have with you and 2 tanks.<P>With 3 tanks the damage would be still be dispersed more evenly between tanks and less healing would be needed, buffers using group spells would still have no more mana drain than before, and the enchanter would still have one less caster to have to clarity and buff. Kills are still happening faster and all casters become more efficent.<P>Becuase the tanks are killing the mobs 5.8 seconds faster with out you the will kill aproximatly 13 mobs for every 12 ( this ratio is exactally the same as before ) they would have killed if they had taken the wizard instead of the tank( 72.5 seconds times 12kills = 870 seconds, now 870 seconds divided by 66.7 second per kill = 13 kills ). This means that the whole group is still getting 1.08 times the exp it would have gotten with the wizard in the group.<P>Once again I will say that the wizard can not keep casting SunStrike ever round but the tank can do more than the 30dps per round with buffs and the right equipment.<P>Becuase of this I still have to say.<P>A wizard performing better than his best will always be worse than a below average tank.

I agree with 90% of your last 2 posts Mandingo. Without getting into every sub-point, I wanted to mention a couple of things...<P>Regarding a wizard's ability to control what dies and when, you mentioned an enchanter is much better at this. Of course you're right, in one sense. What I was getting at is that it's a 2-part equation--the 'chanter tries to keep everything mezzed (while he has the mana), and the wizard applies the killing nukes faster on the first monsters, and more slowly on the subsequent monsters (or not at all on the last couple) to spread out the spawn.<P>Your point about it not being feasible or even possible in many situations makes sense. So far, I've had relatively good experiences with burning things down fast when needed. Sometimes, like you say, when the monster is far *above* half life, I usually do get aggroed. However, via 'chanter (zero-damage) AE stuns and my own rooots, I can prevent a great deal of the damage to myself when this happens. So for me, the ability to nuke hard and fast remains of value. (my opinion on this may change as i approach 60) Probably less than 20% of fights require this, however. Mainly room-breaks, roamers, and trains.<P>Oh, you may wanna read the necro spell list again.  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"> All darkness snares are DoTs. Even the level 4 Clinging Darkness (or lv 15 for SKs) does 30-or-so damage.<P>Your thoughts on the proliferation of twinked melee classes out there are important. This has occurred to me as well (as I've posted, maybe in another thread). I've noticed that there are no mana-regen items (apart from a pathetic few--5 charge clarity rods and the like), but there are several health-regen items. I have noticed that there are items that make tanks more efficient (bad@ss weapons) that you can give to a level 1, but there are no such items for casters--like you say: a spell is a spell. You're totally on the ball here--this is ridiculous. A super-twinked warrior (or SHD, PAL, ROG, MNK, RNG, BRD) is sooooooo much more effective than a super-twinked caster. Not even close. I have a SHD twink, to whom i gave a bunch of Ry'gorr, Tree Weave, Blood Fork, etc... and the differences are simply astounding. I am at least twice as efficient as a mage at my level (15), and probably three times as efficient as a wizard.<P>Anyway, here's to hoping they do something to balance damage-casters.  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>Paz.<P>--------------------<P>51 Channeller :: Simryd "Your-target-resisted-Tishan's-Clash" L'Drael, Erudite Wizard of Quellious<BR>44 CLE :: Ulanji, High Elf Cleric of Tunare<BR>30 NEC :: Quokuus Jhuoroq, Human Plaguebringer of Bertoxxulous<BR>24 MNK :: Xodien Lo'Jong, Disciple of the Ashen Order<BR>14 SHD :: Sujata, Iksar Dark Knight of Cazic Thule<BR>12 RNG :: Kujatta, Human Patron of the Stormbringer<BR>*****************<BR>:: "Eschew Obfuscation" ::
