First of all let me start off by saying that this will be a very long post as us older types tend to ramble =) but I would appreciate it greatly if you read this RageFactor and if others read to, I honestly would not mind.<P>I have been doing nothing but observing the posts for quite sometime and then the topic called "The Truth" caught my eye as it had a very intruiging title.  I then read your immediate posts and several posts of others as they popped up over days past.  <P>Your words and approach to things fascinated me so  began to search for your other posts finding some of your words on the topic of "Gay" and "Paladins, speak out" or something to that effect.<P>Now understand that I focused on you for a few reasons:<P>1.) because you seem to be the main anything when you begin to post whether that role is antoganist or protaganist.  <P>2.) because of the way you approach a situation.  <P>3.) and because of your skills as a debater as they cause you to become the main anti or pro topic poster.<P>I will tell you this friend.  I believe that I understand you.  I believe that I know what your mentality is like and what your life is like when it comes to dealing with people.  I believe I could tell you what your are your favorite types of animals and even why you chose a paladin as your character.  I can tell you how people react to you in forums and even why but that is not the main focus of this post addressed mainly to you.<P>My purpose is to share a bit of knowledge with you.  My purpose here is to re-iterate things that I believe you already know and above all else to make sure you understand your differences.<P>In my old age(not even going to tell you hold I am but feel free to call me the old man   <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">), I believe that there is one thing I have come to master an understanding above one thing above all else in this world and that is people and I willing to discuss our shared knowledge and speak of some truths.  <P>We shall begin our discuassion now, keep in mind that others may join in but I doubt they will and then in someway I may be "surprised".  I say that in quotation marks because when you get to a certain age nothing really surprises you anymore.<P><BR>You my friend are very different from the general human being, in mental set anyway.  You are minority and the chances of running into others with your levels of perception are quite slim.  <P>/e takes a sip from his "I'm not crazy but everyone else around me is!" mug with a grin<P>Honestly speaking from my experience, in being a person with a mentality similar to that of yours and growing up with it, I know you are not likely to run into people with high levels of perception and deductive reasoning in real life either.  Sure it happens but how often as opposed to running into the typical human being? <P>On your thread the "The Truth" you can see this quite well.  <P>Sure, there were others like(My apologies if I misspell your names)Chikkin and Xmod2 who understood you perfectly for the most part and were able to make the same deductions and inferences but the vast majority were not capable of even understanding your detailed and broken down points.  Ofcourse there were others but without question you were them main "attacker" so to speak.<P>There are two MAIN traits of human behavior, hypocrosy and simple mindedness.  Hypocrosy is something we ALL posses.  Each and every one of us human beings are full of things that we are not okay with that we do ourselves in a some way shape or form.  <P>Simpe minded people are a majority but are not by any means the whole as hypocrosy is.  Simple minded refers to those whose actual perception is no more than that of a fish or that of cattle.  They are people who that have minds (referring to the thought complex of the brain and not the physical structure)that are basically no more comlex than that of the animals that so many people claim superiority over.  <P>They are easily decieved.  They do not see past the surface.  They do not look deep and see why something is and why another is not.  Like fish they will automatically swim the way the current seems to be flowing without real question as to why or how this happens and could honestly care less.  <P>Never truely realizing that some streams may flow one way but were meant to be swam in another direction.<P>The example using crabs was a perfect illustration of this.  In the Truth you were taking up for the roleplayers by saying, "This game is not a roleplaying game as it does not encourage roleplay, it encourages power gamming"<P>as a fish, you looked around and seen a sign that said "North river" but noticed that it was flowing south and then you noticed that those that were swimming according to the sign were having a harder time swimming then those who were swimming the way of the water.  you said "Guys, this is not a North stream, because it flows south, perhaps nature should change its direction or perhaps she should change the sign"<P>As a crab you looked around and said "Hey guys, we are in a barrel but if we work together we can climb out"<P>AS a person they attacked you, ridiculed you and even insulted as if what you meant was harm to them.<P>As a fish they continued to swim north content with the fact that they were swimming north and obeying the sign rather than saying that they do deserve to have an easier swim than those who flow opposite of the rivers supposed name.<P>As a crab the grabbed you and rather than working together and saying, "We can all climb out the barrel" they attack you and nothing gets done and you all remain inside the barrel.<BR> <BR>Yes, in some of those case you had those that understood the same truths as you and went to help but majority will always have rule.  Majority of the crabs are attacking you and your friends and thus no one gets out the bucket and nothing changes.  <P>They behaviors parrallel not by coincidence but because realistically speaking the thought patterns of people in general are no more sophisticated or anymore brighter than that of animals.<P>You obviously are a potential master of people if not one already.  I must admit I am impressed with your abilities and that even in my prime you would have given me a run for my money and that I probably would have learned many things from you.  <P>Simple minded people, because they are so easily decieved, are almost never able to see the truth.  They are blind to it because they do not see through distractions and thus the truth will elude them and those distractions becomes the truth to them.  It is a lie they live, and the shall live many lies and nothing is more of an enemy to a lie than the truth that counters its existence.<P>When you speak truth you are already hostile to them.  The general populous will not like you because you are truth(atleast you have been in every post thus far and I do not see why this would be different for the most part although occasionally you will make mistakes sense we are all imperfect) and the truth is the enemy of their false truth and thus automatically their enemy and likewaise they percieve you to be the enemy from the beginning.  <P>Enemy is also commonly referred to as a "hostile" and with good reason as this how you are percieved sense you are also being percieved as an enemy.  Then there is your tone.  I must say, and please do not take this the wrong way, but you must be in your late teens early twenties in age.  I say this not because of your maturity levels or your perception skills, or your deduction because if it were based on that you would be older than me probably but one thing I have learned in my age is that non of that is relative to a person's true ability to do any of those things.  People will be born, live,and die very old and they still never have, never do, and never will understand the amount of things or posses the mental abilities that you, I, or those who support you and see the same things similar as you commonly posses.  They are the majority however and looking around you can see this as look at the path the world is taking.  <P>On a quick side note: Look at the path everquest has taken?  Why has this occured?  Not just because the game design allows it to happen but because the same people that screw up the real world, the very same people that have majority influence in our world today are playing everquest.  <P>At any rate I say you are young because of the intensity and energy by which you speak.  Your mind seems very sharped and full of ripe potential.  You seem poised looking for a great challenge and this makes you seem very youthfull very much like a young tiger.  <P>You have a challenging and powerful personality and because of the power, mentality and what you represent under most conditions(Truth), people will always battle you unless they are like you in ways( or vice versa ofcourse).  You make debating a game or sport and it is in a sense but because people in general are weak minded they then begin to draw misconceptions about those like you and on these forums mainly you.  <P>They think you are being close minded because your points are strong, truth, and fact.  The combination of those things generate aggression from those that do not want to understand and they themselves are being close minded.  <P>They view you as close minded because they assume that must be the problem if they are not getting through to you or if you do not say "I can see your point..." when in actuallity you understand their points even more so than they do. <P>Well, you are the challenging hunter so to speak and you have a "If you are just, then you will defeat me" mentality.  They are basically saying you are closed minded for the reason that you are not one of those people to acknowledge something like 2*5 being equal to 12 just because they say so and especially when you do things like this:<P><<2*5=12>><BR>??Huh?  Raise up 5 fingers once with one hand and count how many fingers you have there and then take the other hand and raise up all 5 fingers there as well.  Count all of them in total now and tell me what you get.<P>People hate when you disprove their "truth" and despite the explaination given because you come off as aggressive and youmake this into a game they always focus more on winning rather than learning.  Unlike you and others of our like, they do not have the ability to seperate things like wanting to win and other factors that destroy good debate but are very quick to assume that you are guilty of the same and this is only because they have had their points destroyed and they have nothing else to fall back on.<P>Anyone with commons sense(keep in mind that this is not very common at all amongst the simple minded) could plainly see that your tactics as a debater demonstrates you read their entire post.  As a matter of fact, when you reply you normally take their post and break it up, and then you disect it(sometimes explaining it to them which should also demonstrate that you are seeing their argument), and then depending upon whether they made a valid point or not, you will either say how you can see it or you will destroy it. <P>Your aggressiveness is also displayed in your strategies because oddly enough you like to battle it seems.  Do not get me wrong, I am sure you get very excited when people agree with you but you admire a feasible challenge.  Again, you posses a "If you are just, you will defeat me" mentality.  Much like my favorite character in one of my favorite shows. "Gundam Wing" and the character you resemble is Chang Wufei.  <P>/e things about his Altron Custom models at his home<P>(the first one was alright but I love the custom and the Endless Waltz versions of his gundam)  <P>I love anime, rpgs, and video games as they help me relax aside from trips to here and there.  Besides being somthing to do on some flights, they are also a major source of my income. (also you mentioned that you made a game or two.  I'd like to know more so E-mail me please)<P>You act just like a true hunter.  You set a trap, basically.  Stating something in a very conflict desiring manner:<P>"Verant sucks and this is why"<P>Now, the things you mentioned from the very beginning are not necessarily confrontational and they are basically things that can be seen but because you stated them in a confrontational way someone is bound to reply back in disagreement and the trap springs into action.  <P>You then tear the ground from underneath them quickly leaving them in sort of a mental paralysis and shock and if they said anything remotely insulting to you at all you will tear them apart from that point foward.  Not only will you address each and every one of their points but you will also destroy some of the next logical points that could be made.<P>Another strategy you have is that you make them destroy themselves.  Since their ground is effectively taken away from them, they have nothing to stand on and no way to know right side up anymore.  You give them a chance to gain new ground sometimes, so that perhaps another point may be made but then you destroy that as well.  Then you loop them around it becomes a point where you dizzy them.  You then start asking questions and these questions are completely lethal and most of the time(so far everytime), they will skip over them rather than answer knowing the answer as you do and knowing that in turn it would destroy their argument.<P>Then there is the point where you know they are done.  When they simply just twist and pretend to not know what it was you were saying.  Basically the "I can not feasible attack what he actually said so I twist it around and then reply"<P>In "The Truth" the question "Who buys a game so that they may obtain the 20th best weapon in the game?" was ingenous as none of the people who spoke against you answered.  The other thing you go for all the time is hypocrosy as you tell them "Well if that is the case, do not wear any armor, or gain any items as to you they do not matter"  <P>Unfortunately they do not see the defeat in their argument here.  You ingeniously knew that there is no in between.  The items and levels either mattered or they did not.  You understood that from a standpoint of neutrality and not emotionally(as this causes faltering in truth and debate) a person can not say both they do not care for something and they at the sametime obtain what they said did not matter to them.<P>This always brought about the same question "Do you buy things so that you can get the 4th best thing in them?"<P>This is to say that people will buy a football game so that they can aim to have the 5th ranked football team in a season.  This is to say that people will buy a race car game so that they can come in 4th and even they knew that this was not a logical pattern of thought by a long shot but were unable to see that what you were saying was that you purchase a game to have fun but part of the fun will be to reach a pinnacle status.  People like having a sense of achievement and would like to do it and you were attacking the thought of settling for fun over achievement rather than demanding both when your version of fun happens to be along with the so called design of that game.  <P>Should a person that picks up a race car game win the raes faster if he drives the opposite way of the track?  The race starts and he/she turns around and drives the other way and wins.  Does that make sense?  It says racing game on the outside but how many racing games actually do that?  That would no longer be a racing game.<P>Then they attack definitions.  Saying no one defined Roleplay when you accurately defined roleplay as general as it could be.  Someone later says that "a roleplaying game is a game when you assume a role other than yourself" thus both limiting the definition and making it too broad and thus losing the concept of what the purpose of definition actually is.  Definition is something that grants a thing or a group of things a unique catagory.  That definition describes a game period and thus is not a good definition at all.  <P>Every game by that standard is an RPG because in fighting games you assume the role of a character, in race car games you assume the role of a race car driver.  Your definition was perfect to saythe least as it did not make things too general but made them general enough for it to include different versions of the same genre.<P>Your name, in the sense that you use it as a company(love the humor in the whole name thig especially the mottos at the bottom), is quite accurate as you establish yourself and basically turn those that were opposing you into your workers.  The more they talk, the more your point is displayed and the more ground you gain and the more they take their own ground away.  You then lay off the finishing touches and "serve" the customer.  <P>Once fully established and your opponent completely broken down from the ground up you can thensimply respond with the copy and paste strategy as their points were effectively destroyed before even getting them out.<P>You are a rare class and as you have seen, most of the world is not ready for you and never will be.  You can do something that many can not do or do well and that is reason.  You know you see beyond falsities and I am willing to bet you are the type of person who believes the words friend and family are exactly the same and that you keep them VERY close so to protect them.  I bet you are constantly preaching about different things to your friends so to help them and that many many people come to for adive especially when it is about people.<P>I bet there is atleast one story you could share with me when a person as sought you out for advice in reference to having multiple people interested in them or a situation in which they were curious about what a person was thinking and you called every single action of the person that sought you out, and those of the people or persons in general to a tee.<P>I bet you are also stern on your friends not so much to change their minds but for challenge and so that your friends have a strong view of their own supported by fact and strong argument.  You do not want them to turn out like the "Popular" culture, the people that believe in something just because it is popular belief.  <P>Like any "wild" (I think they are pretty civilized as there is no such thig as racism, manifest destiny, and other hypocrysies in their world) animal to teach you believe you must be stern but mean nothing by your playful agression hence the clever names of RageFactor and RageFactor co.<P>I bet all of the animals or insects you respect are fierce hunters.  I bet you are constantly looking deep into shows even beyond the meaning of what creators had in mind.  I bet people in your life either just do not like you at all from day one or they like you very much and not a single neutral or in between person other than those you have never met.<P>Basically what it comes down to RageFactor is that I believe you do this for sport and that like any other game or action similar to hunting of any kind, you are quite effective at this.  I may have experiece on my side but I honestly do believe that you would provide an adequate challenge for me.<P>Maybe on a thread you make I will have the honor of being the first poster against you so that I may play advocate for a few moments otherwise, I will miss the oppurtunity as the more opposers that talk, the more points and angles you destroy thus leaving literally no ground to stand on for anyone to oppose you in a logical and feasible argument.  <P>You do seek a challenge, but as hypocrite or a person that contradicts himself like everyone else, in a sense you do want to see people to agree with you.  Your problem my friend, is that people who would actually give you a challenge are more than likely to agree with you and thus not say anythingas they understand that it is pointless other than for sport.  Others will skip the thread all together and even if they read the thread, by that time they do not have a ground to stand on to battle you on, acknowledge this and move on.<P>Just like in real life you, along with others, will be ridiculed and never truely accepted.  Do not be discouraged.   When you get bored or tired of playing with your food you will do something else, but do not stop hunting when you are still hungry.  <P>You know many things that are obvious to the few are inexplainable to the many so I urge the few, never to lose heart or face.  If it suits you please continue to be a strong voice in this community because some of those who are simple minded may lift off the blindfolds and begin to see the truth and thus become one of the complex and it is the fact that what you say is truth that this will aways be a possibility my friends.<P>My apologies for this long post but I am old, I ramble in case you did not notice.    <IMG SRC="cool.gif" border="0"> <P>Anyway, you, the few,all have this oldman's support and if you do mess up or we do disagree I look foward to having some epic clashes with you all.<P>I know people may seriously attack this post but it does not bother me.  They may attack me as the person, but no matter.  This was addressed to RageFactor and hopefully he will restart the other thread.<P>P.S.- Consider this an application to your company if you will.   <IMG SRC="cool.gif" border="0">  It is always something great to be a part in something clever.  Almost to my destination, enough ramblings from here...for now.   <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" border="0">

I am humbled by your wisdom. I couldn't have said it better myself. The following is a repost from what I had to say on the "the truth" theard. I'm reposting it here in support of ragefactor, and the fact that I didnt write it all out to have the tread locked 24 hours later and fall to the bottom of the list, unread, do to the flaming of others. These are the 3 main posts I made. Maybe this thread can be "the truth 2" without all the flames and enlightend discussion with observers brillaint header and lead in.<P> 1. Amen Rage. I agree with everything you said, although I do belive evil races should be allowed clerics. They are preists to their gods, and all gods needs their holy men. I do think, however, they should be granted different spells. They did this nicely in AD&D by limiting certain spells and granting unique abilities depending on what god one choose to worship. This makes since because clerics and priests are given their power directly from their god and no evil god would tolerate using its power for the healing or blessing of a goodly race and vice versa. As a matter of fact doing that has grave consequnces in AD&D.<P>Taobob your constant roleplaying arguments in these boards are so broad one could say Quake III is a roleplaying game. Now yes it could be argued that it is and one could make it so. However, we all know damn well it anit. Same with everquest. Just like Rage said if you roleplay in everquest you are going against the grain. The game fights you when you try to accomplish roleplaying in an atmosphere that roleplaying was, poorly at best, implemented. Yes you can roleplay in this game but it makes about as much sense as doing so in Quake. <P>2. This is my take on everquest and roleplaying. I truly wish it was what I consider a roleplaying game, but its not. Take Diablo 2 for example. I think all of us (save for maybe taobob) can agree its not a roleplaying game. Now besides 1st person view and factions (its also a 1 player game but it can be played online so thats rather a moot subject), the gameplay is almost indentical. 1st person view and factions does not make a dungeon hack (diablo 2) a roleplaying game. Which is what they tried to do with everquest. <BR>Yea so you can talk to other people, but you can do that in diablo 2 if you play it online. It doesnt make it a roleplaying game if you talk in character while playing a dungeon hack.<P>3. My, my how this has grown since I commented on pages 1 and 2 (read them for earlier arguments). I think the problem is alot of the people saying this a role-playing game have very limited experiance with the genre. This is to be expected since once something goes mainstream (like everquest did) it attracts alot of new people. In true roleplaying games there is cause and effect relationship with the world. Gods play an intricate part in this cause and effect. Say for example I'm an evil necromancer who was granted some arcane powers from his dark god. If I used those powers to help goodlys in anyway (grouping etc) I would fall from his favor very quickly and there would be dire consequnces for my blasphemous ways. *Spoiler for the dark elf trilogy* Take for example this as well when it comes to the ablilty for how easy it is for dark races to forsake thier people. Drizzt (the famous drow with a good heart)when he was young went on a surface raid to kill light elves. He saw the brutal killing of them and refused to take part secretly by fake killing a elven girl and saving her life in the process. The drow's dark god Lolth saw this and was not pleased. His family fell from her favor which lead to his family's demise and his escape into the underdark. Where he was hunted night and day by his own kind seeking to please thier goddess. When he finally found the surface it took him a lifetime to create even a few friends that would trust him and look beyond the color of his skin.*End of spoiler*<BR>So yes these things can happen but the consequnces for those actions are dire indeed. Not so in everquest. One can run about doing whatever one pleases with little or no effect and even then most of the time its reversable. That is a fatal flaw in calling everquest a role-playing game. If one can do whatever he or she wants why role-play it serves no purpose. <P>My second point is the reward system. There is zero, none, not one bit of reward for role-playing in everquest that I have ever seen. Why should people go out of there way and do it when its meaningless. I dont go to work everday for nothing. Yes you can say its fun but its also more work then powergaming. So this is what happened in the beginning when I started playing just after beta there was alot of role-players, but as time moved on people saw that it really served no purpose in this game and stopped doing it. Why role-play when nothing comes of it and the powergamer route is more rewarding and time friendly. Yes you can say what you want but the fact remains people wont do something for nothing very long. The only way to advance in this game is killing and more killing thus i call it a hack and slash. Some trade skills are useful but most are not and how do you make money to learn a trade skill? yep you guessed it killing.<P>So the warp things up its not the players fault role-playing is dead or dying in this game. Having played good solid role-playing games for years I can see the glaring flaws this game has in that aspect.<P>Taobob just because a game says role-playing on the box or has the look of a fantasy role-playing does not mean it is by a long shot. <P>Like I said before and I'll say it again just because you can talk in character in a hack and slash does not make it a role-playing game.<P>Heh and for my shameless Neverwinter Nights plug. Check out <A HREF="http://www.neverwinternights.com" TARGET=_blank>www.neverwinternights.com</A>  it seems to me,at least from what i can see the best real role-playing game thats comming out soon. AI and scripted code can never replace the real role-playing feel a dm gives. <P>Comments?

Shh! Observer, don't give away all our secrets? lol, guess they won't do them any good anyway.<P>Your post did a good job of putting it into words. One of the bane's of being this way is people who you care about, and are trying to prevent from getting hurt, resent you. I have many friends who are female, and they come to me for advice about what I think about someone they might be considering going out with. And I tell them straight up. lol. The one's who've listened never complain, and the ones who didn't were sorry. My track record is pretty good  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0">.<P>Another thing, my uncle is this way also and I see what you mean about losing that fire. He's just jaded and has given up. When you're young, you feel you have the power to overcome the ignorant masses and make a difference.  Perhaps we should all meet under RageCo so that the same thing doesn't happen to us. lol<P>So preach on brothers! Even if everyone else thinks it's stupid, you'll at least have a few faithful readers  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"><P>--------------------<P>Bertox Server<BR>-------------<BR>23 Bard - Alluen &ltNew Dawn&gt<BR>13 Enchanter - Epicurius &ltLegends of Light&gt<BR>11 Rogue - Fleck

Why can't we just understand each other's points of view? <P>Jeez. We can agree to have different opinions. EQ was supposed to be an RPG. However, nobody lately seems to play it as one due to all the Quake-rejects on it. Can't we just accept we have different opinions? I personally think Rage has some good ideas and some BAD ones, but that's just me. Jeez.<P>--------------------<P>Good is subjective. Evil never changes.

Jetrauben<P>Yup, that was the point I was trying to make in the original thread.  Who cares <I>why</I> you play the game - as long as you enjoy playing it.<P>I can't see how a ream of psychological BS which, when you cut it down to its base elements, says "Ragefactor has extraordinary perceptive abilities and debating technique and everyone who disagreed with him is small-minded" is quite the way to achieve harmony on this board or any other.<P>My opinion - this psychologist 101 Observer chap is troll.  I can't see any other reason for his rather insulting 'tome'.

really to come here and say that your vast mental power makes everything you say right. Sorry but this game is one of personal choice, sure if you roleplay its against the grain. Well whats wrong with not conforming to the general veiw of others. I have to say I didnt read all of the first post as I got bored with the holier than tho speach. If Im gonna roleplay then thats what Im gonna do.  Come on observer you think that just because your smarter than some people then your view is the right one (hahahahahaha thats laughable) I am not the smartest person in this world but I know what to believe, which is absolutely nothing.  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"><P>--------------------<P>NOVUS OPIATE SECLORUM

Well, that just blew my mind (thx too early in the morning).  IMO it is wrong to call anyone simple minded for their opinions/posts.  That is what this board is about, please correct me if I am wrong...  We all have opinions, that is life, we just need to open up and listen to others.  Not agree, just accept others have different opinions than you.<P>I mean, honestly; I don't RP EQ, never will, but if someone else does that is their choice. I do not fault them for that as long as they do not fault me for my choice.  Just let me be happy doing what I do, you be happy doing what you do.  I may not understand WHY they do it, but I accept it because it makes them happy.  <P>/shrug<BR> <IMG SRC="rolleyes.gif" border="0"><P>--------------------<P>Seornia Shadowmist<BR>Officer Pillars of Heaven <BR>Chanter of her 47th Charm<BR>E'ci

It's funny to think people can say "Just because you're smarter, doesn't mean you're right". Usually that IS the case. No one said it's ALWAYS the case, but 9 times out of 10. People are so forced into this egalitarian mindset, they think that everyone is the same. Well, I'll admit that the majority of people ARE the same, they're mindless sheep told what to do by MTV and the news. They're told what's cool, and they conform. But there are people who are more than that, and yes, they can recognize the sheep. And no, they don't respect you, nor your opinions. They can usually tell what you're going to say before you know you're going to say it. They can read people with stunning accuracy and are almost always right. *sigh* If everyone was so equal, there would be no one working in McDonalds.<BR>----<BR>Everyone is entitled to their opinion, no matter how wrong it is.   <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"><P>--------------------<P>Bertox Server<BR>-------------<BR>23 Bard - Alluen &ltNew Dawn&gt<BR>13 Enchanter - Epicurius &ltLegends of Light&gt<BR>11 Rogue - Fleck

/boggle<P>Firstly, continually calling oneself an &#8220;old man&#8221; in an attempt to add the weight of experience and years to your argument was disingenuous.  Your subsequent arguments did not add credibility to that claim.<P>Secondly, what you choose to not acknowledge is that perceptions are valid to the people who hold them.  How one perceives a situation is totally accurate for that person.  If I perceive it to be hot outside, then it is hot for me, even if someone else requires a sweater for comfort.  A perception is no more than a personal opinion.<P>Observer, what you refuse to concede is that it is perfectly acceptable for people to agree to disagree.  Mature people learn that.  Someone is not simple-minded because they fail to acknowledge your perception of an issue as the only reasonable and justifiable viewpoint.  We can debate religion and politics and never be able to convince one other to change beliefs.  That only means that we each hold those beliefs to be valuable and worth maintaining.<P>Now if that entire pedantic post was actually a sardonic attempt to expose the at-times humorous debate in the thread that was locked, then I salute you.  If that is the case, you were absolutely brilliant and I bow before you.

Gunno have to go with Boggle et all on this post... while I agree with a lot of what Rage said (his perception that EQ is not an RPG despite what it perhaps was originally intended to be) I couldn't read the original post without laughing.<P>I just found the 'we are better than the sheep because we know the truth!' (paraphrased) thing amusing is all. The post just kinda read like those cult and militia websites I read for entertainment value.<P>--------------------<P>-Raggrok

Because someone is willing to write ludicrously long expose on a topic, disecting it to it's most minute ingrediants, and being able to make associations based on personal opinion, that person is more intelligent than the next? Hmm. Some of the most educated people that I've ever met are complete idiots. By the same right, people I've met who never finished High School I respect opinions from more than most. Being verbose doesn't make one right or demonstrate intelligence. It only demonstrates command of language and perhaps vocabulary. Buying into a philosophy that it is true only because it is long and fits with how you feel shows an amazing gullibility, and a certain degree of vanity. Age has zero bearing on truth. <P>I could turn everything I just said into a 15 page discourse, but it gives it no more weight.<P>--- "Simple minded people, because they are so easily decieved, are almost never able to see the truth. They are blind to it because they do not see through distractions and thus the truth will elude them and those distractions becomes the truth to them. It is a lie they live, and the shall live many lies and nothing is more of an enemy to a lie than the truth that counters its existence." ---   I put this to you: People who read further than necisary into a subject are fools, for they feel a need to demonstrate intellect. Those who are able to ignore the destractions of thier own pre-conceived notions, and accept a subject for what it is, in it's simplest form, are the most gifted of all, and of the highest maturity. To add to this, I say that someone who has to stroke the ego of another that they agree with, with such vigor, is demonstrating personal ego, more so than understanding. A person with high intellect, and modesty, can take reason and dialogue from someone they disagree with and appreciate it, if not agree.

First off, I agree with RageFactor when he says that EQ is not designed to promote role playing.  That should be obvious to anyone who has played it for more than a week.<P>I disagree with his assumption that there is no point in playing it as a role-playing game.  While he did not come out and say people who did were stupid, he intimated it very strongly.<P>I do raise the question of whether this poster is really RageFactor.  If not, he seems to have an attraction to him.<P>The assumptions made in this post are truly egomaniacal.  I do believe that the majority of people are sheep, but I also believe that the majority of EQ players are a cut above the average person.  I also believe that most people who post on this forum are a cut above most EQ players.<P>The true question of whether the game is a RP game nonsense.  A game cannot be an RP game.  A game can provide a ruleset that spans a scale from 'does not support RP' to 'Promotes RP'.  Even AD&D was just a set of rules.  I knew people that played it with no consequences for actions.<P>EQ falls somewhere above the 'allows RP', but well below the 'Strongly supports RP' level.  One can RP and have fun.<P>The assumption that one either doesn't care about items or must have the uber loot is a logical fallacy.  One can play and have fun even if one doesn't have the best item in the game.  I played AD&D for years without ever having to have a +5 vorpal defender sword.  It was in the game, but I didn't have to have it.  (If it fell in my lap I would have taken it, however  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">)  <P>The post is full of statements like this.  As was RageFactor's initial post.  This is what leads me to believe that Observer is RageFactor.  The real world is not full of black and white decisions, niether is EQ.  I can make a logical argument for evil healing, just as I can for good not healing.  I don't doubt that several members on this board could out argue RageFactor.  The fact that RF chose what lines of text to debate shows that he never addressed the intent of rebuttal, but rather picked nits.  People in real life do that too. (they are generally lawyers  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">)  <P>If RF wants a true discussion of the merits of class/race choice versus good/evil definition, then I would be happy to oblige, but I doubt he wants that.  He has a narrow minded view of both this world and EQ, and wants to place that view on others, enforcing his standards.<P>While majority rule is arguably a very bad thing, in most cases, with an educated and enlightened populace, it will work better than the alternative.  Fortunately, we don't live in a democracy.  <IMG SRC="cool.gif" border="0"><P>--------------------<P>Josef - Servant of Balance

Greetings "Old Man" as you say plainly put it, I'll razz you a bit since you told me I could. :P and because I percieve no one by physical age anyway for the reason you stated that from the day one is born till the day they day their abilities of comprehension, deduction, and perception normally never change.  Sure you can get them on rare occasions to see something but it is similar to how the general populous views IQ in the snse that that never changes once the brain has matured a certain age.  I am not too sure but I think they test you for your IQ at around age 3 or so *shrugs* and that goes to show you just how much they believe IQ changes through out a person's life as they believe they have an accurate mesurement even before puberty.<P>At any rate, you predicted their replies, just as I did after reading your posts.  Despite the fact that it was allowed for others to read, you knew that only a few would truely understand.<P>You also demonstrated how truth above all else is the enemy of the false truth.  How?  What happens when something is percieved as a threat?  How do you respond?  Your post was quite neutral and that is the way perception should work in order to get the clearest picture.  Imaging watching TV through green shades.  You will not be able to see the true colors. <P>You explained perception and you explained why you refer to others as simple minded.  You gave examples as to why this was and how it occurs and even further direct relationships between animals(which people commonly refer to as simple minded) and our own actions so in a logical course of thought, by THEIR standards, they to are simple minded.  You used them against themselves in a settle way. See you still posses some of that energy.  =)<P>You are right, and you have called me to a tee.  My experiences, my likes and dislikes, and my mentality when I come here.  <P>You are right though, it would be most fascinating to have a difference of opinion between you and I as I would finally have a true challenge which I desire.  Perhaps the bold and mighty Xmod2 will also one day play a formidable devils' advocate  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"> but in the end we will walk away a little bit more enlightened.<P>I my self am a contradiction and you were very correct in saying that(hey, I'm imperfect I'm alowed).  I am like a soldier who fights for peace but at the same time I love the battle.  I want people to understand but at the same time I seek the worthy challenge.  An opponent that I may respect more so than I.  It has happened on VERY few occasions and I learned much from those experiences after all, you only get stronger by battling those stronger than yourself.<P>We are likely to agree on most of everything, though our imperfections and different personalities(no matter how subtle they are) may one day play a part and cause us to look deeper and see something different from the others.<P>They even made assumptions as to my name, not realizing it was a joke, just like me pretending to be a company or something.  It was just a joke.  I am not really mad and I am not really a company as this was all just a part of a clever design.  So no more people telling me "the source of my rage is..." because there isn't any.  However, I did review all the applications.<P>At any rate, with little no more aggression than your words being the truth you generated some hatred from the audianece.  Not as much as I would have but this emphasized your point to a large degree.  <P>I learned something from your post and I think that is what you wanted me to do.  I learned that without being as aggressive, a person is still capable of doing the main functions of what I try to do when I debate.  Remove ground, make it so that those that would oppose would basically be opposing themselves, and to enlighten.  However you seem to be much more enlightening than I as I kind of cloud that part a bit by being a tad more aggressive.  <P>I'll keep this in mond in the future but for right now, "The weak shouldn't have weapons!".  No mercy.  If they want to have a belief they had better be strong in it and understand the basis becuase more than likely we will.  You are very right about how I treat my friends, and about the advice thing.  Basically it what Xmod2 said and as far as my friends, I will be damned if I am going to be okay with them ever having formed an opinion simply because of popular belief.  They say something they know to be able to defend it because whether they believe the samething or not, I may challenge them. =)  <P>From the company,<P>Observer(very obsevant), XMod2(You are awsome), and Lightning(Super agressive but we like the style) are more than welcome to use the logo.  We here at RageFactor co.   <IMG SRC="mad.gif" border="0"> feel that where ever you go you would be doing a superb job of representing the views we express.

We can agree to have different opinions. EQ was supposed to be an RPG. However, nobody lately seems to play it as one due to all the Quake-rejects on it. Can't we just accept we have different opinions? I personally think Rage has some good ideas and some BAD ones, but that's just me. Jeez.</STRONG><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Well, it is because in actuallity people fail to realize that there is in fact a right and a wrong, a good and a bad and that this is what preserves balance.  We freakin' forgot all this when we went on the "Let's try not to hurt anyone's feelings" kick.  Stupid things like "Let's agree to disagree" and goofy things like that but don't get me wrong.  Those things are all necessary for the general populous because they can't seperate sport and simple discussion as from an all out war.  They kill over differences in opinion and take things personal and stuff like that.  <P>If I inferred something, ask if that is what I am trying to say.  Why not?  I ask questions of others and used that strategy.  <P>It all comes down to who is seeing the truth and who isn't.  You have had people saying that both people were right along time ago when a select few people thought something was wrong with a car and that it was just perception based.  Now we have holes forming in the ozone.  <P>They are saying it is just a matter of a difference of opinion here but then you still see the powergamer does in fact advance faster than the roleplayer.  <P>Observer's river and fish example is perfect of this sort of thing.  Because people tend to be simple minded like fish, they are going to flow in the direction a river flows.  Majority of the fish will swim that way, the path of least resistence, the path that goes with design.  If majority of the fish are swimming north than you know the river was designed to flow that way because they will choose the path of less resistance along with design.  Majority of the people in EQ swam at first towards the way of the sign but began to realize that it was easier and more rewarding to swim the other way.  Do you still say that the river flows north just because the sign says it?  I asked this question several times.<P>How many powergamers play AD&D?  <P>Now I add these:<P>What is the ratio of power gamer to Roleplayers? in AD&D?<P>Who has the highest ratio in both?  and that will tell you what kind of game you are in.  What will be the ratio of Firefighters to civilians at firefighter's convention?<P>Who has the highest ratio?  Now you know what kind of convention you are in?<P>Anyway I am restarting the thread cause there is much unsettled buisness.   <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>To those saying Observer is me? *LOL* You show just how lacking of perception you truely posses.  Our freakin' styles are different, our frame of minds towards others is a but different or atleast in the sense of how to deal with them and his tone is entirely different.  That was a pretty dumb assumption from here buddy.  My apologies to Observer for causeing you any trouble cause of people assuming you and me are the same.<P>Your post wasn't long by the way cause you were summerizing your thoughts on a roughly 200+ posts actually that makes your post VERY damn short. *LOL*<P>Later,<P>  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" border="0">

I've always thought that one of the most interesting traits of the human species was that each person having a unique mind that is developed through individual experiances and knowledge could have many differant variations of what is the truth.<BR>In my childhood I was exposed to a religion that referred to themselves as the truth and everyone else was wrong. As I matured I looked around and realized that the "truth" was relative to the person that was making the observation. What I believed to be was what I believed to be through my own observations and the person next to me would have a possibly differant outlook of the same situation.  I would not consider myself to be under either one of the categories you have stated.. neither simple minded or hypocritical. And to assume that all of the human race falls into these two categories seems a bit narrow minded. At times I am simple minded I do not care which way the river flows as long as it flows, and I am not concerned whether or not you interpret my actions and beliefs are hypocritical because your concepts are your truths based on your experiances and knowledge. Which if we were of a hive mind then hypocrisy and truth would ideal and easily determined. Our minds are individually unique though and the richest experiances and knowledge I will gain throughout my life I believe will be learning and understanding by listening to others who have had the opportunity to do and see things that I have not. Is this simple minded that I appreciate this? Is it hypocritical of me to listen to someones opinion and base my own off of my experiances and knowledge? And last Who are you old man to tell me that I am either a simple minded fool or a hypocrit? Does being eld mean that you can cast judgement and be perceived as being correct? My grandfather was an immensely talented intelligent man that I respected and loved, but he was not always right. Age does not bestow the honor of always being correct..the experiances of age can bestow the wisdom to differentiate the truth from hypocrisy. <BR>Rage.. I felt you were narrow minded in your concept of what can and can't be. You left no room for character developement or individuality. You assumed that all Dark Elves had only one alignment and that was as insulting as saying Iranians are all ignorant. Generalization of any caste or class is detrimental to a debate. To generalize any subject into one lump assumes that all those representing that subject are operating in a hive mind mentality and they are all to blame for the actions of one.<BR>That being said I'm going back to the happy thread that Kyrra started this morning. It has made me smile and that in my book is worth more than anything I've read on this post today.<P>--------------------<P>Jayde <BR>Dammiana Honeythorne Druidess of Tunare of the 49th season of growth.<BR>Lyrisa Bard of the 19th season of song.

<BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by RageFactor:<BR><STRONG>How many powergamers play AD&D?  <P>Now I add these:<P>What is the ratio of power gamer to Roleplayers? in AD&D?<BR></STRONG><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Yanno... the funny thing is, the last time that I joined a group of players to play AD&D, you could call the entire troupe to being munchkins, ie powergamers.  It wasn't a roleplaying game, it was a hack/slash fest for better weapons, armor, etc.  Was the GM at fault?  Nope, actually he was a good GM.  He was giving the players what they wanted.  In that group, there were five powergamers to one roleplayer.<P>Now my LARP troupe, happens to be composed of over fifty roleplayers, sixteen storytellers, as well as a company of people who just play characters to help out the story.  How many powergamers?  Zero.  They get screened out before they are even allowed in our troupe.  (Yes, we are a site to see when we all actually are able to get together).<P>EverQuest will never in a million years be as good of a roleplaying environment as a *good* roleplaying troupe can be.  Why?  1500 plus people to how many GMs?  The game wouldn't be profitable having to have that many GMs on staff to support the game.<P>Now, Neverwinter Nights is shaping up to be probably one of the best examples of a roleplaying game on the computer (although, again, it will still not be as good as a real life troupe as you are still confined by actions directed in computer code).  But then again, Neverwinter Nights will never be as large of a game as EverQuest.<P>I happen to enjoy roleplaying my three main characters that I play in EverQuest.  My rogue has a very different personality then my druid, who has a very different personality from my warrior.  My speech mannerisms are different, my emotes are different.  *I* take enjoyment from it.  Now that doesn't mean I want to force other people to roleplay either, because after all, what I enjoy may not be what others do.<P>The problem with these threads is that it isn't black or white.  It is merely shades of grey.  One side has an opinion.  Another side has a differing opinion.  The first side beats the other one down for being blind while the other side argues the first one is trying to impose their will on them. -shrugs-<P>This is a game.  It is meant to be enjoyed.  If you don't find enjoyment, seek out something that will.  This is a recreation.  Enjoy it.  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">

Observer and RageFactor are the same person, and that person is a troll.<P>Word searches are wonderful things, and what often gives a troll's identity away is the inability to snap out of long-held writing habits.  This includes mis-spellings.  If you spell a word incorrectly once, chances are you'll do so again.<P>With that in mind, i'd invite people to look at the following quotes from Observer and RageFactor, paying special attention to words in bold:<P>Observer wrote:<BR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><BR>They view you as close minded because they assume that must be the problem if they are not getting through to you or if you do not say "I can see your point..." when in <B>actuallity</B> you understand their points even more so than they do. <HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>RageFactor wrote:<BR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Well, it is because in <B>actuallity</B> people fail to realize that there is in fact a right and a wrong, a good and a bad and that this is what preserves balance. <HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>That word has only the 1 'l' in it.  Strange how both make the same error.<P><BR>Observer wrote:<BR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Never <B>truely</B> realizing that some streams may flow one way but were meant to be swam in another direction.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>RageFactor wrote:<BR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Despite the fact that it was allowed for others to read, you knew that only a few would <B>truely</B> understand.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Both incorrectly spell 'truly' with an 'e'.<P><BR>There are probably more, but the final example is one of punctuation.<P>Observer wrote:<BR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><BR>I can tell you how people react to you in forums and even why <B>but</B> that is not the main focus of this post addressed mainly to you.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>RageFactor wrote:<BR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><BR>I am like a soldier who fights for peace <B>but</B> at the same time I love the battle.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Both those sentences required a comma placed before 'but', both failed to include the correct punctuation.

Now be a good fellow and go back under the bridge.<P>Baaahhhh baaahhhh

To Jayde,<P>I respect your post, though I disagree.<P>There are truths, and there are falsehoods.  The nature of matter is that it generates gravity.  This is a truth.  It is also a truth that gravity can be negated somewhat.  Does that mean gravity is false?  No.<P>There are many things in life that are opinion-based.  These are things like 'what food do you like?'  There are others that are real underlying truth.  The former can be affected by our experiences, the latter can not.  Whether you choose to believe in gravity or not, you will still fall.<P>As for the comment about generalization, Rage wasn't trying to say a dark elf could not be good.  He was trying to say that there should be some consequence for a dark elf should he choose to be good.  To use your example, Iranians are mostly muslim.  They range in their intensity of belief from secular to devout, but they are mostly muslim.  To be an iranian jew or an iranian christian carries severe consequences if you live in Iran.  Being a dark-elf follower of Tunare should carry some serious consequence.<P>What RF was pointing out was that Verant published their intent for dark elf nature and behavior.  By providing an ability for dark elves to play as good characters, WITH LITTLE CONSEQUENCE, they broke the concept of role playing.  If you had a dark elf cleric of Inny (I know Rage, you don't think they should exist) and chose to ally with the lighties, you should lose your powers and be actively hunted by the dark elves.  A quest should appear offering a huge bounty to other players to hunt you down and turn in your head.<P>By not doing this, they, by default, remove the concept of role playing.  Let's face it, most people don't play dark elves to be good because they think the rp is fun.  They do it because dark elves have cool graphics and they have great stats and abilities.  By playing them good you get all the abilities and ALMOST NO penalties.<P>That said, Rage is slightly wrong.  There are posts from people who play good dark elves that cannot visit a bank because they are KOS everywhere, including Neriak.  There are some penalties.  Probably not quite enough.<P>My opinion, even though I will likely be flamed, is that nobody should be allowed to play an evil character.  Role-playing is training, and nobody should train to be evil.  I feel it is intrinsically a bad idea for society to encourage evil behavior.  If it must be tolerated, then I would like for evil characters to be attacked at will by good characters, and only then be able to fight back.<P>--------------------<P>Josef - Servant of Balance

Just a couple of thinga I'd like to say reagarding Ragefactor and both of these threads...<P>The reason that perspective is something that is not understood by others is because it is a personal thing... My perspective of the game, or even of real life is very different than the "majority" but that does not make it any less right in my eyes...<P>Ragefactor didn't actually admit until page three of his post that he was "Waving the flag of role-playing" and in fact had disparaging personal attacks for everyone who held a different perspective than his... My first response to him with my perspective that role-play was how the game is designed and marketed was responded to with his personal attacks at me based on his limited perspective... If he were truly trying to "wave the flag of role-playing" then in my opinion he did a very poor job of it by constantly stating that EQ is for powergaming and not role-play...<P>As to Observer's post here, I think that it was completely unnecessary to bring this discussion up again (and honestly the old man did ramble, as well as making very little sense at times). The only part in his entire description of Rage and the discussion that held true for any of the previous discussion was his analagy about swimming upstream... <P>I noted early on in Ragefactor's post that the sign says "role-playing" (on the box) and maybe it was swimming up stream, but I personally don't care and play for fun... Rage responded by attacking me and my playstyle and then even my "perspective of role-play" saying I was being being limited and that being a powergamer would achieve more.. This of course brought up the discussion of him wanting to be an over-achiever in a game, and possibly obsession with that, and later it was revealed possibly why he felt that way (because he did role-play and try and swim against the stream but his roommate might have influenced his thinking to swim with the current instead of against it)...<P>Overall, the last thread deserved to be closed in my opinion, and it was mostly because the original poster could not make his points without attacking people (and that was why people responded with attacks of their own).. <P>The salmon swim upsteam to propagate their species (and I role-play hoping it will catch on and be the norm not the exception), but just because the trip is harder (or possibly more challenging going against the current) it is by no means less satisfying or showing less achievement.. <P>PS Still says RPG on the box, the website, in the FAQ, and I prefer to think I'm not swimming against the stream anyway but that it's the other people who are..  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">

<BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Gravelgut:<BR><STRONG>What RF was pointing out was that Verant published their intent for dark elf nature and behavior.  By providing an ability for dark elves to play as good characters, WITH LITTLE CONSEQUENCE, they broke the concept of role playing.  If you had a dark elf cleric of Inny (I know Rage, you don't think they should exist) and chose to ally with the lighties, you should lose your powers and be actively hunted by the dark elves.  A quest should appear offering a huge bounty to other players to hunt you down and turn in your head.<BR></STRONG><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Actually Grave, I disagree with you here.<P>By Verant allowing dark elves to play good characters, they allowed another option for roleplaying.<P>Let me ask you this.  Innie is the God of Hate.  Dark elves really do hate pretty much everything, even themselves.  Would it not fit a priest of Innie to hate his very own God?  To help those lighties just to show their own hate towards Him? -chuckles- I could.  That was how I roleplayed my dark elven cleric.  He hated his people.  He hated his God.  But isn't his hatred of everything only feeding Innie's hunger?<P>Let's pull an example from that awful AD&D everyone loves to compare EQ too.  Necromancer's Handbook.  There were kits in there that were necromancers, but were anatomists, early physicians.  People who studied the dead to help find ways to heal the human body in life.<P>Is that character evil?  Could not possibly an Erudite or Human necromancer be along those lines instead?  Should that character forever be shunned by society, even though he continually does work towards a good end?<P>Roleplaying is subjective.  What is roleplaying a character to me could be totally alien and foreign to you.
