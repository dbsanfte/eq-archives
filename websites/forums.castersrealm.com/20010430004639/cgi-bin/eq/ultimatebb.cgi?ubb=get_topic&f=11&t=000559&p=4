I can't believe I've just read this entire thread, but I have. There are better things to do at 3am in the morning (sleep springs to mind) but I was enthralled at both a) the pointlessness of the argument and b) Shayna (I can't be bothered to look her name up so shoot me if the spelling's wrong) her incredible sense of self importance and sanctimonious self-righteousness. <P>I play a level 55 druid, 30 necro and 35 cleric. I have never played a shaman but before you set about pointing out my complete lack of experience (your arrogance really is quite astounding) I would like to first point out that I have 'grouped' with many of them at high level and I am perfectly aware of what they can and can not do. <P>You have made some valid points but your tone is unnecessarily offensive and if you can put your hand on your heart and say you are NOT flaming people who disagree with your opinions then I am sorry but you are fooling yourself.<P>In particular, the guy who dared to stand up for Gurk was not only accused of being Gurk in disguise by one of your sheep, he then had to suffer the indignity of reading yet another of your 'I am God who are you?' posts. All he was saying was there is no need for you to be so rude to people and condescend them the way you do. You think you are special because you are high level? If you need an online multiplayer roleplaying game to make you feel important, there is something wrong with your life. Go out with friends and discuss your amazing tactics and knowledge of EQ with them over dinner. I bet they'll be so impressed. Just don't take it amiss if they never invite you back.<P>Is this a flame? Why, of course it is. I don't agree with Gurk's opinion that druid's are better placed to serve a group in a non healing role than shaman are, but I think he is 'right' to stand up for what he believes (right or wrong) without being insulted by some pretentious EQ prima donna. <P>This is the first time I have visited these boards. I went straight to druids because that's where my interest currently lies (yes level 55 is a nighmare but I love my druid so I keep coming back to him). I didn't really know what to expect, but I sure didn't expect this. Shayna, I think it would be unfair to say you give druids a bad name because you obviously know how to play one (it's not difficult) but I think it's entirely fair to say you are not the kind of person that the vast majority of druids would like to see as self-appointed spokesperson for our class since you seem totally incapable of keeping a civil tongue in your head when you respond to others.<P>My opinion. Flame at will.

BAAAAHHHHHHAAAAAA!!!!!!  Sheep, that's me.  Now who is flaming.  So cause I agree allot with shanya I'm a sheep??  Give me a break.  There are other posts and I have disagreed with her.  I was joking when I ask if it was Gruk in disguise   <IMG SRC="tongue.gif" border="0"> .  As for a class spokesman she would do well for druids and Shawman.  Nobody is a true expert with all knowing knowledge.  That includes you as well.

Prom/Gurk/Anon person, I can't honestly see why you are posting this, if you have a problem with me then email it to me using the facilities provided, but don't troll out an already long-overdue-for-death thread.<P>But for the record, I do not flame, this is not flaming, if you really think this is flaming, then god help you when you get flamed for real - yes I can be very blunt, but I do not have an infinite amount of time in which to fluff up every post I make. However I have little time for people who post on subjects with an air of authority on which they obviously have no personal experience.  If you've played 55 levels, you ought to know that there is a HUGE difference in knowing a class by playing it and knowing a class by grouping with it, it's chalk and cheese.<P>At the end of the day if you don't like my tone or my attitude then don't read my posts it's really as simple as that.  I don't do recognize your message a flame, maybe it is on <A HREF="http://www.disney.com," TARGET=_blank>www.disney.com,</A>  but not here, possibly you'll construe this as a flame also, but it just isn't.<P>I can only write YET AGAIN for people who think this is a FLAME, the message folder has marked this entire messages as a HOT/FLAMING message, whilst I do not consider my messages as flames (although others may do if they are sensitive), then DO NOT READ THESE TYPES OF MESSAGE THREADS.<P>This BASIC rule of forums is proving to be just a little too taxing for some people!<P>Shanya, Innoruuk Server  <IMG SRC="mad.gif" border="0">

Shanya, I've just read your non-response. You give no explanation as to why you attack other people at every opportunity unless, (like some of the dullards here) they start their threads with 'I agree with Shanya totally, she is so cool'.<P>Your comment on my level: In 55 levels I have learned that groups 'discuss' what needs to be done considering the classes they have available to them. Druids and shamans 'generally' agree that druids should heal while shaman do their stuff but it doesn't always make sense to do that. You will never know this because as far as you are concerned you already know everything and don't need anyone to tell you what to do. Instead, you spend your time talking down to people so you can feel important. You are a loser in every sense of the word.<P>A note on Sebilis. You said you are quite willing to go there without a cleric as long as you have a druid and shaman to heal. Really? I bet you have never died there (hello gate) but I but your encs and casters have.<P>Anyone who goes to Sebilis without a cleric shows a complete lack of knowledge about both the area, and EQ itself and the classes needed to survive in such a place. Try doing the disco room with a druid or shaman healer and see how long you live. Is your druid or shaman going to rez you when they realise they don't have a CH to save your tanks from that hard hitting mob? No, of course not, but you will have gated out by then anyway, no doubt sending tells to everyone afterwards telling them exactly what they did wrong.<P>You forget one thing when you post your messages. There ARE high level players reading your posts, people who have been to all stages of the game and know from firsthand experience what is needed to survive in high-risk areas. Either you have never been to these places, or you are genuinely as naive as you sound. I know of 'nobody' on my server who goes to level 50 plus dungeons without a cleric, not least because if it all goes wrong you have to have a rez. If, as you claim, you go to high risk areas without a cleric for 'fun' then I'm sorry but you are a complete liability to group with and exactly the sort of person that none of my level 50 plus friends would go anywhere near (fancy spending four days trying to get back to your corpse because your group can't fight their way back there and you can't find a necro to summon? See Shanya).<P>People who listen to nobody, learn nothing. I cite you as a perfect example.<P>p.s. No I am not sensitive, I just hate people who can only hear themselves when there's a whole world talking to them.

First off, before you get any more posts out of me, be brave and register and let us know who you are and where you play, otherwise as far as I'm concerned you have zero credibility, you can post anything you like from an anonymous non-registered name and people frequently do.<P>But lets set the record straight, I don't know everything about EQ, I don't know everything about, druids, shamans, wizards, necromancers, SK's or any of the other classes that I play, I do know an awful lot though - I've been in EQ since the start and a participant of these forums (and others for an awful long time and contrary to what you think I read *EVERYTHING I CAN* - over time you get to know who is talking sense and who is talking crap.<P>I may be alot anything things, but I'm not a hypocritical enough to go into a thread, read alledged flames, then flame people while claiming to be indignant towards flames.  That role I leave to you.<P>Do not expect anything further from me on this, like I said before if you care that much, EMAIL me - somehow I suspect you won't.<P>Shanya, Innoruuk Server  <IMG SRC="rolleyes.gif" border="0">

*Sigh*  You people are debating a point that is rather ridiculous.  As a previous post alluded to, ANY cleric can outheal ANY druid of equal level ANY day of the week.  They get a built in boost to the HP they recover, not to mention the fact that they get the next level healing spell much sooner.<P>This just recently happened with my newest Druid.  My group (Level 14-16) was out in Oasis having a jolly old time.  Things were going rather nice except for the fact that there were no clerics to be seen.  One of our members bowed out for some reason, and we sought a cleric.  After we got the pure healer on-board, the group got to REALLY rocking.  I could use more of my mana for buffs and damage shields.  Pulls sped up, exp followed and life was made all the better.  As a further note, the cleric already had his next level healing spell and was outdoing me anyways...   <IMG SRC="tongue.gif" border="0"><P>To respond to the matters concerning high level encounters (Level 40+)...  Let's get serious.  Clerics get C-Heal at Level 39, while Druids are still using Greater Heal.  They don't even get Superior until Level 51!   <IMG SRC="eek.gif" border="0"> <P>If your tank is getting whooped on by multiple mobs, (Level 40+ still) you DO NOT want a druid trying to heal them.  Why?  Well, because the Druid will run their mana into the ground before they make a significant improvement in the situation.  Druids simply cannot replenish that much HP on a tank of that level in any reasonable amount of time during a battle.  As for the cleric's side of the argument, we'll leave that for another forum.  They have their own tactics for such situations.<P>Further, how many groups have you honestly seen running around at that level, or on a Plane raid for that matter, without a cleric?  Not many on Xev, I'll tell you that much.<P>Here's a simple way to see the whole situation.<P>-Tanks are born to melee and be meat shields.<BR>-Wizzys are born to nuke.<BR>-Enchys are born to mez and deal crack (among other things).   <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"><BR>-Clerics are born to heal.<BR>-Druids are born to be Jacks' of all Trades, but masters of none.

Shorty, yes indeedy. Except that lvl 29-33 druids/shaman/clerics share Greater Heal as their primary heal spell.<P>I found Greater Heal still ok being primary healer until about lvl 40, then its ability would really depend on the group. I've been primary/only healer at lvl 41-48 in Dreadlands and on the odd occasion at 49 in Karnors - not ideal by a long shot, but with clarity or bard song, you can pull of it if the tanks are able to take sustained beatings and know the heals will be minimal.<P>I agree entirely with what you say, at lvl 50+ I'd like a cleric in the group, but would I hang around three hours waiting for a cleric or go with a a druid/shammy combo in a group I trusted? I'll group. I've been in Seb without a cleric and lived and made good exp, I've been in with a cleric and died - there's alot of skill and probably as much luck involved, but with a good puller you can do fine if you know the dungeons well (Seb in particular) and steer clear of areas that are out of your league.<P>This is the key point, stay within your groups abilities - you can't roll with a druid/shaman combo and expect to hunt in the same places as you would with a cleric, it's simply not possible, but for people to suggest a cleric is a prerequisite for high level play is ludicrous, it's not - you just have to be extra careful on pulls, and be choosey where you fight.  If my 55 wiz had waited for a cleric before grouping, I'd still be lvl 51/52  <IMG SRC="frown.gif" border="0"> - the cleric population on Innoruuk is low.<P>I've also seem some midrange groups PREFERABLY take a druid/shaman combo over a cleric for several reasons. Ports/Evac/Dmg shield/Buffs/Slow/Debuff's aside, with the recent hate changes made to heals, moderate hate spread over two healers can be preferable to alot of hate on a cleric - I've not tried it myself, but have heard this happen in guildies groups.<P>In an ideal world there would always be enough clerics to go around, but often there just isn't - I don't know anybody who plays a cleric as a primary, only as alt's for when they are needed  <IMG SRC="frown.gif" border="0"><P>Shanya, Innoruuk Server

No need to end a thread if we are still having a valid argument. Some people just take things to heart and get all frustrated. Its just text people...sticks and stones. Besides half of Shayna's posts are "I’m not going to dignify that with a response". Anyone else see the irony in that?<P>Clerics/Druids/Shamen make almost equal healers till about 39. Then the cleric owns healing no questions asked. Not to say that Druids and Shamen cant heal after that, it just becomes a compromise that costs your group a lot of efficiency. Taking a shaman and druid to high level dungeons is a lot like agro kiting, you lose a lot of efficiency. Granted Shayna will talk down to anyone that agro kites (even if they need to in order to survive), but she is more then willing to take a druid and shaman as healers at high level.

I'm ending my 'difference of opinion' with Shanya because it's becoming too personal to be worthwhile for other people to read and has strayed dramatically from the original subject. <P>My opinion, in summary is thus: yes, druids should heal in a group over a shaman in most cases, and no, you should NOT got to places like Seb without a cleric unless you want to become an expert in corpse recovery. Like I said, it's just my opinion.<P>I am emailing Shanya as requested to spare you all from the 'heated' open arguments. You can all get back to your lives now, lol.

Actually, the level that weeds out the healers from the wannabes is 34th.  With the arival of cleric superior heal and word of healing.  After 34th, there is really no comparison in healing, the cleric takes his rightful place.<BR>Gurk, please, come on to Povar, let me powerlevel you to 50 so you can agro kite in Sebilis, the Hole, and Karnors.  You will agro the entire zone, players and mobs, and you will lose so much xp from deaths that you'll be lower than when you started.  In a serious dungeon, it is not an effective attack.  The agro range of most upper level mobs is too high to worry about being reckless and running them around.  It's not like kiting grifawns in the Karanas or sabertooths in the Overthere it will not fly in a 50+ group in an indoor zone.

I would never agro kite in a dungeon, ever. I have and still do it when im at a camp that has lots of blues and the rare red or yellow. When a red or yellow is pulled then agro kiting is the best option if you cant fear kite. I have never claimed it was the best tactic for every situation. In facted I have gone out of my way to say that you need to adapt to different situations and deal with them accordingly. Plus everyone knows this tactic would not work after 50 because NPCs are lazy and will just summon you to them if you piss them off.

Yup, good point.<BR>That's true, just wanted to clarify the terms a little bit.<BR>This is kinda why alot of this anti-agro kiting thing has started.<BR>There are a lot of mid level zones that are outdoor, where it will work, and most of us at higher levels don't hang out in them much...maybe we've become a little biased.<BR>I have kinda always felt that if I were focred to kite, it should be for me, with 4 snared blues chasing after me, rather than kiting for my group....the whold point of having a group is so that a druid doesn't need to kite.

Hi Hi,<P>Yes I have been primary healer in my group so much I don't even think about it.  Clerics are hard to come by and I always want a cleric in my group when I can get one.  Why?  Because there is no way I can heal as fast and keep the downtime as low as a cleric doing the healing.  Also there are many other spells that can help my group that I will not use bacause of the mana cost and the need to keep mana for heals to reduce down time.<P>Yes, I have been in hand/warlord in Karnors with no cleric and was the primary healer.  We didn't have any problems, but that was mostly because the other 4 all melees had their trak BPs (rogue and warrior) or a fugi tunic (monk) and bard used his 55 song.  I just had to keep them alive during the fights and their equipment, songs, or abilities (the iskar monk does have natural regen) did the rest.  Under another situation it would have been suicide to rely on a 53 lvl druid to use her brand new sup heal (that fizzled 3 out of 4 cast) to keep the group alive.<P>I also been primary healer in seb with a shammy to back me up.  Why was I healing instead of the shammy?  The shammy buffs and slow on mobs helped the group more.  Same thing while hunting for gems for vel quest armor. Shammy buffs and slow and I heal and the group could pull with almost no downtime.<P>Sure I would have liked to have a cleric instead. There are a lot of spells that would help my group if I wasn't so worried about having mana to heal them.  Or seeing the puller bring in a CHealing mob that needs to be burned fast and there are no nukers in the group but me who just happens to be priamry healer as well.<P>Another reason for wanting a cleric was when a ranger is in my group, atleast until he/she got jolt.  There was noway I could keep a ranger alive without clarity and/or mana song.  And then we would have large down time as I burned all my mana chain casting heals to keep the ranger alive.<P>56 taxi at your service

Ok, I didn't read the follow up posts or anything on this thread but all I'm responding to is the initial post so it doesn't really matter.  I am a druid, level 60 at that, and have been put into situations like he is describing.  Yes, I can heal and I can keep a group going quite well so long as I have some sort of mana regen going, bard song, clarity (preferably clarity 2), mask of the hunter and protection of the glades are usually enough to allow me to keep up a group but if any form of chaos happens, I am not capable due ot the long casting times of my heals (I know chloroblast is an exception, but when you have mobs doubling or quading for 150ish one heal of that is about as much damage as they'll do in the cast time) I am normally just barely capable of keeping a group alive solo, we're just not meant for being a solo healer in the group.  Now the difference would be if there were two druids or a druid (and once again, preferably) a shaman then healing is no problem at all without a cleric.  As for 'blowing stuff up', well, no, our nukes aren't as efficient as a wizards with exception to one druid nuke...Wildfire, 1 damage to mana point of the cost of the cast is more efficient than a wizards and there have been many posts both from mages and wizards on this being the case in gripes but I don't normally nuke unless it's an absolute necessity, I usually dot and med and PATCH heal for the cleric to help them conserve mana and have plenty of time to get off that far more efficient heal called Complete Heal.  My role in a group normally is this:  1.  Mob pulled, I wait till 90% and snare, usually with epic (thank you verant).  2.  Dot with either skyshrine bracer or just plain old Winged Death to do my share of the damage  3.  Group damage shield or if only one tank is getting hit, Shield of Blades for them to do even more damage from me  4.  Patch heal and maintain regen spells on the group to once again, make it a little more efficient for the cleric and give tanks a better chance of survival.<P>Depending on the situation and the dungeon or zone we're fighting in, I will add other buffs or occasionally nuke if the mob is low or has a lot of hp and needs to be helped in being brought down faster.  I think you're view of druids is brought about mostly because you've been forced to group with druids that spend most of their time soloing and found that at 53+, soloing is no longer an efficient method of exp, in fact, we get less exp soloing 53+ than with a good solid group...I will admit one thing though, I don't care to be primary healer in a group, that's not my job, that's what clerics are for.

Old post but had to say that Shanya is 100% right!<P>As a 54th cleric I have to say I love a good shammy in my group in any dungeon! It _drastically_ cuts down on my healing needs when the shammy debuffs the mob.<P>I also like druids in my groups, but hands down a shammy has much more work to do than the druid.

I've been the main healer on many occasions.  Not because of lack of healing classes, either.  I was recently in a group with two shamans, myself two tanks and a mage.  I asked what the best outfit would be and everyone agreed that I should play primary healer. Why?  Because we had no cleric and the Shamans had buffs which were more benificial to the party than what I had.  Certainly, I would throw in a dot on nearly every mob that we pulled, plus a snare.  If my healing reserves became too strained, I would ask that one of the shamans take over the responsibility in the next fight while I medded.<P>I think that the original poster must have run across healing types who simply chose not to heal.  I'm sorry for that, but never will I feel faulted.  I play my own way.  May others do the same.

I have nothing significant to add to this thread in terms of the arguement... but I do feel compelled to say this: this is a game, right?  I realize that as you get higher in level, efficiency and tactics may be more important in terms of group play, but really, if the groups that Gurk's been playin with really don't mind his tactics, I don't see the problem.  As one person had posted way earlier... as a druid, when I join a group, I simply ask what will my role be, and I follow the lead.<P>If I am a GL, then I change tactics depending on who is in the group, but hell, I am new at this, so I will experiment and play around and LEARN.  What the bottom line to me in any group situation is, beyond any and all other forms of tactical efficiency, is the sole idea of staying alive, keeping the members of the group alive.  More than calculating mana pools, meditation downtime, chain pulling or who is to tank or not, my number one concern is that the safety of the group be maintained.  Is that wrong?  It seems plainly simple to me.<P>Okay, this is obvious, right?  But what it leads back to is my initial statement that this is a GAME, and games are supposed to be fun.  I was in a group in the Lake of Ill Omen the other night... on the ledge.  I am usually very relaxed about how things run, because I want to have fun more than be concerned with power-leveling.  To me, it ain't about the time, it's about the mileage.<P>But we had a couple ppl in the group who were apparently used to being in some very well-oiled machines, and they started to complain that we were all doing it wrong.  So it got bossy, and critical, and clinical... and in the end, yeah, we started to chain pull... and we were using our mana pool to its maximum efficiency, and yeah, two of us leveled in the next hour or so... but do you know what?  I didn't have fun.  Not at all.  And because of that, I will never group with that person ever again.  Not only was it not fun, he/she was just plain nasty.<P>So there you have my two cents.  I appreciate some of the intel that I got from this thread.  It was enlightening to learn about some of the details... but in the end, for me, it's about having fun.  So as along as ppl aren't getting killed for it, efficiency be damned.<P>Cheers.<P><BR>Graylan Litefoote<BR>24th Ring, Vazaelle
