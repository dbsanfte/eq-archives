<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">
The Leveller<P>         	My name is Garaldar.  I have a tale I would like to tell. I'm a human wizard from Freeport. Today I'm in <BR>my 20th season but this tale of an earlier time. It's a story of my eighth level test, how I acheived it and of the <BR>traveler who helped me.<P>         It started as any other day in that period of my life, which consisted of fighting the creatures of the wild to <BR>get experience for my test, winning a few fights and losing more. I would slowly lose ground for a couple of days<BR> and then have a really good day with the end effect of going nowhere. I was contemplating giving up this futile <BR>dream of mine and taking up fishing with my father. A trying time indeed for me. Still, I had heard stories of the <BR>spells the masters allowed us apprentices to use at the eighth level. I longed to posses these spells for myself. <BR>So I pushed on.<P>         I had been hunting in the East Commonlands for some time now. A beautiful place full of roaming dangers <BR>for the unwary. The northern side of the commonlands was a forest populated with various spiders, beetles, orcs, <BR>bears, griffins and much more. A place where only the bravest of apprentices dared hunt. The southern side <BR>although tamer in this region lead to the Northern desert of Ro. A place even more dangerous than the forests. <BR>I had taken to hunting on the desert edge of late, fighting pumas, skeletons and rattlesnakes. Although in truth I <BR>only hunted rattlesnakes when I was desperate for some experience. The poison of the rattlesnake is deceiving <BR>because it continues to do harm long after the snake is lying still and cold. Making the snake more powerful than<BR>it appears to be. On this fateful day the commons seemed empty of other hunters. As if some event had called <BR>them all away from the area. I could tell then that it was going to be a rough day. Without any likely back up, if <BR>things went wrong... Walked around cautiously looking for an easy mark to warm my muscles and focus my <BR>channeling. After about 10 minutes I saw a decaying skeleton wandering aimlessly. It seemed to be alone so I <BR>crept closer, keeping an eye on the surrounding area for other nasties that might join the fight.  I got within <BR>striking range. One more check to make sure we were alone and I began to cast. I raised my arms and rooted it <BR>so that it could not interrupt my other casts with it's blows. It stood there motionless for a brief moment before <BR>struggling to get free of my unseen hold. A few more strikes and it was all over. A smoldering pile of bones <BR>where my target once stood. I felt as though I was ready for a stronger opponent but I needed to meditate and <BR>regain my mana. I headed for the tunnel that lead to northern ro so I could concentrate in relative safety. Once <BR>there, I sat and searched for other hunters while by mana recharged.<P>         Telepathy is a gift that all races in Norrath posses and I used it to scan the area for the minds of other <BR>hunters. Still, there were very few around. I had not seen another soul since I had set out this afternoon. After <BR>meditating, I gathered my strength and my wits to begin the search for a beast with abilities to match my own. <BR>After only a few minutes I spotted a puma standing on the top of a dune. I examined him closely, he seemed a <BR>risky fight but I should be able to handle him so I decided to test my skill further. Bracing myself, I raise my <BR>arms and immobilized him with my root spell. I began to fire. Just two strikes into the battle my luck turned for <BR>the worse. Over the dune came two skeletons heading right for me. I quickly backed away and to the side, trying <BR>to get out of their line of sight. I was too late. In a moment they were both on me cackeling with evil joy. Even <BR>then I knew I was going to lose this battle. One skeleton by itself would be a tough enough fight, but two, well <BR>the stench of decay alone would do you in. I was getting desperate. I turned to run when the puma broke loose of <BR>my spell and pounced. I had only seconds to reflect on my short career before death claimed me. I was getting <BR>weak and struggling for breath when.  A light started to fill my eyes and at first I thought it was death coming for <BR>me but as I sank to the ground, I realized that the light was an arcane fire that was burning my attackers. Someone <BR>was trying to help me. Lying there helpless I saw each fall in turn, defeated in one blow. As my eyes closed for <BR>the last time I wondered who had helped me and was sorry that I would not have the chance to thank them. <P>         My eyes shot open and I gasped for breath. I sat up quickly but pain knocked me right back down. I felt the <BR>sand beneath me and realized that the dream I had been having was no dream. I was lying unprotected in the <BR>desert with predators all around me. I slowly sat up and took in my surroundings. As I looked around I noticed a <BR>figure sitting about 15 feet behind me. He was dressed in a white robe. I saw he carried a one handed staff and a <BR>doll of some sort. Curious that. It must have had some meaning for him to carry it along with a weapon.<BR>         "Are you?.." my voice left me for a moment, "the one who killed them?" I finished.<BR>         "I am" was all he said to me. Then he added, "rest and med, I will keep watch".<BR>         "thank you" I said relieved, and shifted in the sand to meditate. As I meditated I also reflected on how <BR>drastically one's luck can change in a matter of minutes.<BR>         "May I know your name sir?" I asked. The figure rose and faced me before replying.<BR>         "My name is Dysan Stormeclaw, what do they call you?"<BR>         "They call me Garalder, I'm gathering experience for my 8th level wizard test but it seems to be taking <BR>forever." He looked at me quizically for a moment, then said, <BR>         "you should be in a group, our class is weak when we stand alone. However, it's a pleasure to meet you <BR>garalder." He bowed and held out his hand in offering. I took it and shook warmly. <BR>         "You're a wizard also?" I asked. I could barely hide my suprise. I don't often see higher level casters around <BR>these parts.  He grinned. <BR>	"Yes, I just passed my 24th level test and was coming home to celebrate." <BR>         "How fortunate for me that you happened to be passing in my moment of need."  He looked at me again <BR>with that same strange look and chuckled. <BR>         "Fortunate for both of us! If you had died I would have had to search out another caster." He looked around <BR>and took in what appeared to be old and familiar surroundings. "I was looking for you garalder." At that I was <BR>taken aback. What did he mean he was looking for me? For what purpose? Why would he save me if he only <BR>planned to kill me. As weak as I was at the moment, I could not escape so I asked him. <BR>         "Do I know you?" My confusion must have showed in my face because he smiled and said,<BR>         "I see you're wary of me. You have nothing to fear. Come up to the tunnel and I will tell you my story." So <BR>I followed and sat across from him resting and waiting to hear what he had to say. A moment or two passed, he <BR>let out a deep breath and began…<P>         "I also had a hard time in my lower levels.  My 7th season in particular.  I was level 7 for a very long time.  <BR>I didn't know much about grouping with others and I didn't know many people anyway.  So I hunted alone.  One <BR>day I would gain alot of experience and the next I would lose more than I gained the previous day.  I watched <BR>others pass 2 or 3 level tests while I remained the same.  I was very close to giving up when a high level paladin <BR>named Vangerdahast of the WinterKnights found me and helped me.  He gave me some basic advice then did <BR>something that I will never forget.  He told me to pick a target that was sure to kill me and attack it.  I did as I <BR>was told.  After all, I was so used to being beaten that one more time seemed a small sacrifice for learning what <BR>he had to teach me.  I rooted it and started casting.  The creature broke free almost immediately and in no time <BR>at all I was close to death.  He healed me while I cast until I was out of mana.  Then he told me to meditate while <BR>he diverted the beasts attention.  It went on like that for a few minutes, him taunting and taking the blows while I <BR>sat and concentrated on medding.  As soon as I had some mana back I cast some more.  By that time the creature <BR>was half beaten and Vangerdahast finished it.  I gained a fifth of my experience with that one kill.  He explained <BR>to me that the Gods offer the experience to the person who does the most damage.  With only 2 more attempts I <BR>had enough experience and passed my test right there.  For wizards the eighth season is the beginning of our <BR>independence.  It's when we acquire spells that allow us to stand on our own if we choose.  We parted ways then <BR>but I run into him from time to time as we trade stories.  He has become like an brother to me.  So now, <BR>whenever I pass a test, I celebrate by helping a young caster gather experience for their next test.  In honor of <BR>the one who helped me in my time of need.  Now do you understand why I am here?"<BR>               <BR>	I nodded.  "And you want to help me?"<BR>	"Yes, if you feel you can use it."  My mouth hung open for a minute before I gathered my composure.  <BR>	"YES!" I cried. "but how?  you can't heal me can you?  Can you take the blows while I meditate?  how is <BR>it done?"  He laughed out loud at my eagerness and grinned from ear to ear.<BR>	"Simple actually, I will root it while you cast and med.  When you have it down by half, I will finish it <BR>like Vangerdahast did for me.  Now, are you ready to begin?"<P>	For the next hour, we wandered around looking for beasts that I considered to be higher than me.  He <BR>would root them while I cast.  With him holding them, I would be able to take a third of their life before I had to <BR>sit and meditate.  It was hard to concentrate at first, knowing that if the creature broke his hold it would come <BR>straight for me.  Sitting there with my eyes closed took a lot of trust but he proved over and over again that he <BR>would be there to hold them.  A few minutes of meditation and I would be able to take another third from them, <BR>then he would finish them with one strike.  In between kills we sat and rested.  I listened to tales of far away <BR>places that he had seen and beasts that sent shivers down my spine.  I would ask question after question and he <BR>would always answer as completely as he could.  Once while fighting a lion, two other lions decided to join in.  <BR>They ignored him and came straight for me.  After all, I was the one doing the damage.  My life started to drain <BR>immediately and was dropping quickly.  He rooted the target and turned to the other two.  Lightning bolts shot <BR>from his hands and they dropped.  Rather than risk my life with another attack he killed the target and we went to <BR>rest in safety.  At the end of the hour I was filled with a yearning to gain my levels as fast as possible so that I <BR>too could travel the world and perhaps see some things that he had not..  My desire and faith had been renewed.  <BR>I was just a little way off from my 9th level when we said our goodbyes.  I ran straight to the guild masters and <BR>recieved my spells.  When asked how I had gained so much experience so fast I told them my tale.  Apparently I <BR>was not the first to meet Master Stormeclaw.  A legend had grown amoung the higher level students of Dysan <BR>the Leveller.  When I told my father he just grunted and said that I was full of foolish dreams. "Our family has <BR>always been fishermen, you will too when you've come to your senses."   It didn't make a difference, I knew then <BR>that nothing could stop me.  In a matter of weeks I passed my 12th level test and received the binding spell.  A <BR>spell that set me free.  I left home later that week, returning after each test to spend a few days with my family <BR>and guildmates.  Each time I would ask the masters which of their young students was having the most trouble <BR>and seek them out.  Continueing a tradition that Lord Vangerdahast had started with Dysan and he had passed on <BR>to me.  This time they gave me your name Valder.  Now I pass this on to you.  If you feel you can use this help, <BR>the price is that you carry on our tradition and help others in their time of need.  Let us begin.  <P><BR>The end

ROFL.....Damn good post and story with an excellent message. Everytime I ding a level which provides me with new spells....I always slide to an area where the people are 8lvls down and pick someone out from the crowd and help them level up for an hour or 2. The funny thing is....I've only been playing 2 months (albeit hardcore time played) and I have a list of friends that greatly exceeds the number allowed...I guess a few of those players were secondary's characters for quite a few people because I have had people I don't even know walk up to me and say  "Here's a Gift for You'. This has happened 4 times....once it was a Sacrificial Dagger, a Robe of The Oracle, Nightshade Wreath and Bone Mask/Gatorscale Leggings. I guess it pays to shown kindness to others........ <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">

I have had similar experiences, and I have done similar things.  My two sisters and I roam widely accross the surface of Norrath and we keep much in contact with each other and our guild.  The kindness you do to one of will often be returned by another.  By the same token, I perform what help I can to others, and I have received assistance in return.  Upon asking why this stranger helped me, I am often told that someone I had helped had told them of my generosity.<P>So what goes around comes around.  Kindness is repaid by kindness.  Such are the teachings of Erollisi Marr.<P>Enchantal Joybringer<BR>34th Enchantress of Erollissi Marr<BR>Fennin Ro<P>--------------------<P>Never meddle in the affairs of Dragons, for you are crunchy and good with ketchup.

Working the newbie log in Nek has been a past time of mine for quite a while. Clarity, Haste, and even a Rune will go along way if used wisely (i.e. you can kill 25 blues on a single rune III and not one red) <P>In my travels around the world I have found that no other youngling area compares to Nek and the Field of Bone for having the higher level characters return and help out the young of their kind.<P>--------------------<P>Taldra Yi`Tsarin<BR>Enchanter to Blades of Law<BR>Povar Server
