OK. for you people that love to argue and flame every post you see.... Don't read this.   This post is intended to generate ideas and thoughts that would make BST more attractive in 50+ zones and add to the uniqueness of the class.  This was copy and pasted from what I wrote in the feign death post and thought it worthy for all to read if they wish to do so.<BR>---------------------------------------------<BR>Now the 1st thing about how to prove in roleplay why beastlord should have FD. Well, some just don't by the "play possum" things. OK let me ring off a few more that come to mind. TURTLES, PORCUPINES, both of which roll into a defensive ball or shell to lose the agro on most critters that attack them. Plus you have other animals such as lizards and snakes (cobra's) that expand and itimidate it's attacker to run them off. The blowfish that puffs up to enormous size so that it cant' be eaten and swollowed. The skunk that sprays a very offensive odor to chase many attackers away. So as you see there are a number of animals that have good defensive skills for protection. Especially the Cameleon which hides by changing it's color.<P>Therefore, lets NOT have feigh death then, but something complete different then any other class.. A brand NEW skill for BST only.<P>How about these:<BR>1)  Shell Skill (mimics a turtle, possum or porcupine): which is a clickable skill that allows you to fall on the ground in a devensive nature and AC is temporarily increased by 20 points and agro is NOT lost till 10 seconds later. This would mimic a mob attacking us then after 10 seconds lose interest in us and move along.<P>2) Camo Skill: (mimics many reptile that change color to hides it's ID from attackers) This would give the same effect as Hide or Invis, but since it's not a spell or skill that makes you disappear, but only blends you into the surroundings. Those mobs that can see thru invis would not detect you. SPECIAL skill.<P>3) Intimidate Skill: (mimics a lizzard's or snakes ability to take a posture that intimidating to it's attacker) This would be very similar to fear but is a clickable skill. The skill could get resisted, and duration is variable, but it would all depend on the level of the player and the mobs that is attacking it. BTW.. if this skill works it also has a good chance of clearing the agro list too. Example: 35th level BST sits and meds, then is jumped by a blue mob. If he is unable to deal with this mob due to health and mana, he can use this skill to attempt to fear him off and lose the agro on him. Phew>> I have no idea how you want to work the numbers, but it can be so that it's maybe 50% effective on blue mobs. If this was a green mob then their is even a higher chance of success depending on level difference. Furthermore, while the fear is in effect you can not run behind it wacking it without breaking the fear immediately and gaining agro again. And any add on mobs in a fight can work the same way. YOU Intimidate it away. You can further make this skill so that reload time is not as quick as a FD reload. <P>I like my last option the best because it fall directly in line with roleplay aspects the most. This is why lions, panthers, wolves growl and roar. INTIMIDATION.. why many reptiles (cobra's and some dragon lizzies) change posture. INTIMIDATION>> <P>Hell, there are many animals, insects that even such as peacoc*s, butterflies, and the like that have special defensive skills that are somewhat intimidating or mezmerizing in nature.<P>There you go.. NONE are current skills in the game but something NEW that falls directly into a beastlord's nature of roleplaying and is unique since those that say BST are a special hybrid are happy too.<BR>I see no problem giving the BST even more then one of these skills. Why not have both the Camo skill and Intimidate.. This would make BST very viable and special in the high end game as well since his camo ability would not be compromized by mobs that "see invis".. makes him excellent in stalking a mob undetected (without fighting unless he choose so), or just plain scouting for mobs or corpse recoveries, and the Intimidate would be very useful as well.<P>Think about how may animals and such in nature that are able to move about stalking or otherwise almost completely undetected, or can be quite defensive in nature to avoid a fight in most circumstances. <P>--------------------------------------------<P>That was part of my post which I thought would be interesting and a good topic for thought.. if you would like to add new idea's for skills or edit the 3 existing ones I already did.. feel free to do, but don't flame..

More to add to the topic:<P>As a continuation thought to the camo skill.. how do lions, cheetahs, pathers hunt their prey.  They sneak up undetected to where they are close enough to strike.  This falls directly inline with BST rollplaying.<P>NEW SKILL:  Speed. (mimics those animals like cheetahs to use high speeds)  This again is a clickable skill that at 2 skill point increases your speed by 1%.  You again skill points by using it starting it at level 1.  Limited to 5 points per level as most other skills.  I would allow this skill to cap at 230 in skill which means that at max, (45th level) his SELF speed would be increased by 115% percent for a duration of 30 seconds and reload every 10 minutes.

Personally i feel that the skills that you outlined, however well they might fit into the roleplay aspect of the game, are ludicrously overpowering and are entirely impractical for the VI staff to adopt and transfer into a gameplay environment.<P>I feel that it is entirely unreasonable to expect any of these skills and would personally urge anyone from the VI staff *not* to use them, however unlikely it may seem that they would anyway.<P>Don't get your hopes up, boys.<P>--------------------<P>and that's all i have to say about that<P>Lieflier Arctica - Halfling druid of the Wizened Aspen Grove of Karana of the 35th Equinox

Again I ask you not to flame on this post for the sake of flaming unless you have some factual input in which you can explain why or why not those skills listen now or later would OVERPOWER a class.<P>Could you please explain to me how 30 second  "Speed Skill" that reloads every 10 minutes would overpower me? If you look at the data of SOW and the increase speed it gives you, you would see that by 30th level and getting 5 points per level your "speed skill" would be 155.  This means you get 75% increase movement speed. Is this much more then what SOW gives you?  I think not.  Heck if some shaman gave you sow at 15th level you would actually be faster then that then "speed skill" which would only give you 40% increase at that level.  See as you say, I don't see how this would make us ubber or overpowering?<P>Camo Skill?  How does this make us overpowering?  The ONLY, and I mean ONLY advantage it would give ya is that it protects you from those that see thru invis.  Again I would have this skill tied directly into skill points per level.  Therefore again at lower levels a spell casted on you by another player would be much better then what your skill could give ya.  You can have it so that Camo Skill is on a ration so that at a 200 skill cap he can only maintain his "undetection" for 5 minutes fixed and again have it on a 10 minute reload.  How would this make him overpowering?  I need examples.<P>Intimidation skill:  How does this make us overpowering?  Give examples.. Let me give you an easy formula how this would be put in the game.  Even conned mobs gives you a 50/50 chance of sucess.  For each level below or above the percentage changes accordingly.  Hence a 35th level BST that was attacked by a 5th level newbie wolf would have 50+30=80% chance of success. That same 35th BST attacked by a 50th level mob he would have a 50-15=35% chance of success.  Since the reload would be, maybe 10 seconds, I don't see how this is going to make us overpowering.  In the above examples I have given, I can easily disperse the annoying wolf, where as with the RED mob I might have a 35% of escape. If I was suceessful in the first attempt.. PHEW. thank god.. if not. I have to wait 10 more seconds to retry and guess what? That RED mob is still beating me to death.  In a period of 10 seconds he'll have approx 4 rounds of whacking on me.  How long do you think I would stay alive to have a second chance? <P>None of the above skills mention above are honestly OFFENSIVE in nature and would not give us any overpowering abilit to group or solo better. Am I going to use "speed" while grouped.. NO..  Am I going to use "camo" while grouped..  ONLY for scouting, and corpse recovery.. but the moment you summon corpse or attack something, you are no longer hidden.  Am I going to use "Intimidate" while grouped.. NO<P>And I believe for the most part, 90% of the time, you arent' going to use these new skills soloing either, unless to just practice and raise them up in points.<P>However, will these skills help in the 50+ zones in groups or raids.. YOU bet they will, but they will not take away from other classes abilities or rolls in the game.<P>Again, lets try to be productive here and not just CRY "overpower" with no information or scenarios why it is.   <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">

to the above poster I give a response: NOT flaming,, just don't want misinformation or confusion here.<P>Shell Skill,, yes its very similar to FD however it does make you vulnerable for 10 seconds and the reload would be slower.  This is still inline to rollplaying in character and would not take away from a MONK special skill of FD.<P>Camo Skill,, is close to Sneak however this makes you invis to all mobs including those that "see thru" invis which sneak does not do. Plus camo would allow you full rate of normal speed, NOT slowed down.<P>Intimidate Skill is similar to ID, but you forget one major drawback.  As I said, which you missed, YOU are unable to attack it while it's feared without regaining immediate agro.  ID allows you to keep attacking it while it's back is to you no fighting and Intimidate skill would not allow you to do this.

OK.. I'll buy the one comment that "speed skill" can be on a once a day timer like harm touch or lay of hands.. however, they you don't have to increase that skill either and it's fixed upon the level of the character instead with no skill points given.<P>As for camo? it may step on the toes of a rogue's ability in some circumstances, but not all.  As for the high end game.  I would much rather have a "class" on raids, especially failing ones, that can go in undetected by ANY mob and pull the corpse out with speed and reliablity.  Infact if anything this would actually step on the toes of those classes that summon corpses (but NO coffin needed) The trade of is that Once you summon corpse of a fallen guild member you are visiable again but you do have the hitpoints and speed to beet ass back to the zone and drop off the corpse.  I only suggest this as a high end alternative in being needed in tough zones.<P>The intimidate would not allow us to fear kite.  As I said if you are sucessful to an experience mob (50% approx) you are unable to hit it without it turning and attacking. The flash of light spell does NOT do this.  BTW. if you use flash of light while both you and pet are fighting and you back off.. the mob does not turn and run, he stays planted where he is figting your pet.  So what purpose does this spell have (besides lowering it's ATK rating by 5 points)..<P>The shell skill is similar to FD but with slower reload and 10 minute delay as one person suggested.<P>I chose these line of skills because they are similar but different in many reguards to what is currently occupied by other classes and races.<P>I did not choose any offensive skills because that would be overpowering unless you do something with the pet/master combo.<BR>A pet that hits for up to 3 or 4 times and a BST that adds in his dual weilding and kick (plus spells) is enough damage.  To add in more offensive damage dealing skills would NOT be fair at all.  I do agree that ripo's, area spells have too much negative effect on our pets making us very low on the damage dealing table.  <P>I still suggest and will hold to it that if you are a BST and wish to go in fighting in a zone where you feel uncomfortable with your pet because of pathing or ubber mobs.  We should be compensated for it.  Any pet class that is petless normally is still 70% effective, where as the BST is dropped to 50% and I would like to see that upped to 70% as the other classes enjoy.   Therefore, allow us to cast our pet buffs on ourself instead of summoning a warder.  Verant can easily code this..  Why do I say this?  If you cast a DOT on yorself is it FULL EFFECT.. NO, because VI has allowed it to be only 60% of it's ability when it's casted on PC's.   The same type of coding can be done with the pet buff.  If we cast it on ourself the % that is transfered to us is will not overpower us and most likely get us up to 70-80% of what we could be with pet.  <P>I believe one gent said the pet buff adds 700AC and 2,000 in hit points.  OK. lets use those numbers (i may be wrong).  You cast this on yourself and you only get a reasonable % of that to you.. To compesate what you have lost in not having your pet, and add double hit as well.   This mean that we lose the DD spell and bash that our pets are capable of doing as well, but then that was the trade off in casting the buff on me and not on pet.   You can make this pet buff NOT stackable with other buffs if we cast it on ourself if that still becomes a "unbalancing" issue.

How did I know that this thread would turn into another flaming thread by those that just can't simply read the words that are written, instead of them adding words or thoughts that aren't there?  <P>Did I say mage/necro's would lose 30% damage. NO, I did not.  I said  mage/necro are still 70% of of WHO they are without their pet.  You ASSumed I was talking damage dealing. I was not.  Both Necro's and Mages have things to offer a 50+ group without their pets. Can a Mage/Necro still cause serious damage in a group without their pet?  YES.  Can a mage/necro offer other things to a group besides DD/dots.... YES<P>Whereas Beastlords are more crippled then any pet class in the game without their pet. This is fact and not disputed.  A Beastlord has only 2 things he can offer any groups beyond 50th level when his pet is dead, or not allowed.     1) dual wield and kick, and 2) a lousey 80point evoc spell. Both of which would get yourself sitting on the bench waiting to be called in after all the other choices are depleted.<P>Our DoT's will not be used (like you are ever going to see a RAID without alteast ONE shaman there) Our buffs will not be used (same reason above)  Our slow spell will not be used (same reason above).  Beastlords are gimped in the spell line up because of stacking issues incase you forgot.  OH. and PLEASE don't count the 59th level DD spell for 430, that is a bit late in the game to enjoy it for long.  <IMG SRC="frown.gif" border="0"><P>Most of you keep flaming away that Defense or Alternate skills are NOT viable, yet you push for defining skills on the offensive nature.  We do not need anymore offesive skill to deal out more damage that is already there.  We are already at 80% of what a monk can do, which is fine with me.  All I like to see done offensively is just simply redistribute that so that instead of pet+bst=80% monk damage,,, you get 'no pet'+bst=70% monk damage..  IF you don't like that, well TOO BAD.  The facts still havent' changed about the high end game that BST pets (along with other pets) are too weak and vulnerable to ripo's, area spells.  If you don't want my suggestion of making the pet buff self casting.. FINE.. then just simply make a WHOLE new spell that is a pet buff that protect the pet from those problems.<P>As for the goofball that suggest fear kiting, you are so totally wrong.  OMG I can't believe someone even suggested that. Why in the hell do you think rogues don't fear kite using ID. It's suicidal!!!!! The odds of it running into other mobs that will agro is not worth the risk. Rogues will only use ID towards the end of the fight when its weaken, flash of light will not do any good becasue at that point in the game the pet has too much agro for the mob to turn... NEXT.  BTW.. I was in Stonebrunt not long ago with my beastlord taking on the kobold camps..and this is what happens.:<P>I see Shaman Kobold and target.  Cast flash of light (I use this spell because it DOES NOT AGRO surrounding mobs) If I used slow or dot any other mobs within agro range of what I targeted comes as well.. NOT a good idea, hense flash of light.  At this point the shaman does one of two things. 1) cast back immediately where as I take damage and pet agro's and I have to do "pet back off".. This works in most cases.  2) mob runs, NOT in fear, only because he's BLIND and cant' find me.   I have had numerous times where I have casted flash of light and the mob starts to run off in a direction and stops and cast. My pet has gone agro and I was unable to repeatively back him off. SINCE I have not done ONE point of damage yet my agro is virtually NOTHING, and with the first attack of my pet that mob stops, turns and fights my pet, EVEN tho flash of light has NOT worn off....... NOW explain that?    SO where does this fear kiting you suggest come from?  I've played my class for a long time and I've never seen my pet chase and bite a mob running off after flash of light landed?  UNLESS your pet was chasing him and was NOT able to hit it one time , therefore the mob didn't agro in return. ROFLMAO<P>BTW Tan.. did I not say instead of double attack you could add a built in haste to compensate that..... DOH.. are haste spells not in the game anymore?  This was my point, is you take one thing that you dont' like and run with it without looking at the complete picture.  STOP flaming with nonsense and read before typing..   And when did we start comparing bards,necro's and druids to beastlords?  I have news for you SON.... but all three you just mention are way more valuable to a INDOOR zone group then a beastlord without pet.  EVEN the necro and mage are still more powerful and have more to offer a group without their pets then a beastlord is without his.<P>I can't believe you are even going there.. ARE YOU SAYING beastlords without pets are just as powerful as MAGES, NECROS, CHANTERS, SHAMANS, SK's (pet classes) without pets.  What planet you are from? All those classes can still ROCK the house and add alot to a group without their pets, where as we are limited to 3 attacks and a minor DD spell.  COUGH, COUGH..<P>By the way since I've never played a Chanter or Bard and I don't get into researching them,  Don't they have Haste/Slow spells and do they STACK with the low level beastlord version?   IF they don't then I assume again a beastord could only use his spells if a Shaman, Chanter, Bard is not in the group already.  Like I'm going to see that many groups in high level zones that doesn't have atleast one of the 3.

if you really think mages are all that in a raid situation, then go you need to put yourself in an asylum and do society a favor. Apparently you don't pay attention to the news.  the biggest problem maes have is their raid potential.  on raids, they either <P>a) nuke (and go oom soon with many resists)<P>b) chain summon pets (which would never get buffed)<P>c) sit on the group waiting for the puller to go "oops, I'm lost, coth me"<P>a and b aren't generally useful in raids and are excluded.  as for c, you only need 1 mage really to do it, which isn't all that great as the other 30 maegs that want to go on the raid are told no.<P>--------------------<P>Kaltooth - lvl29 Mage - Torv<BR>Vallinor - lvl35 Beastlord - Torv

Without a pet we are about 60% of a warrior, yet the situations in which we absolutely cannot use a pet are rare.  Perhaps that's as good as we can hope to be in those situations, not everyone can contribute meaningfully to every situation.<P>One might argue that if we get something to compensate for the lack of pet during certain encounters (ie increasing our damage potential by X% ), then magicians and necromancers should get something similar (ie nukes and DoTs doing X% more when a pet isn't present).<P>Realistically, I don't see this happening.  Verant likely isn't going to go to the trouble of coding wierd buffs or skills for beastlords just because we're unhappy with our role in a few limited situations.

Hmm, how about the fact that BL are pretty good as it is, and the skills you mention add power.  Take something that is pretty well balanced and add power to it.  That is the most succint way to say that the abilities you mention are over powering.  Doesnt really matter what the powers are.<BR>The bottom line is, BL can do some things, not others - just like all the other characters.  Is that such a bad thing?<BR>Besides, if you look carefully enough, you will notice that non casters tend to get skills, casters tend to get spells.  Classic example of that is feign death and instill doubt.  Monks get these as skills, necros get them as spells.  BL would get any such things as spells more likely than skills.  We already get invisibility spell at high level.  We already get SoW (maybe SoC should be in our list - shrug).  I think we get turtle skin (cant remember) - granted it doesnt do what you want it to, but it is a defined spell in the game.<P>On a side note, I think we should get primal avatar (after all, we are connected to the primal spirits of the animals) and Dire charm (on animals) and a death spell (animals die).  I wonder if you recognise sarcasm - just about any power could be justified through role play ideas for just about any character if you spent a bit of time thinking about it.  Just because you can do that, does not mean a power isnt imbalancing.<P>Anyway - quite a number of people have suggested the ideas would not be a good thing to give to the BL - maybe - just maybe - they are right?

Don't be an idiot, Rydeson. ID kiting is not only viable it's a very powerful soloing tool. The key to it is nothing more than knowing your pathing and the zone.

Greetings,<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>As for the goofball that suggest fear kiting, you are so totally wrong. OMG I can't believe someone even suggested that. Why in the hell do you think rogues don't fear kite using ID. It's suicidal!!!!! The odds of it running into other mobs that will agro is not worth the risk. Rogues will only use ID towards the end of the fight when its weaken<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>   Rydeson,  Not really sure where this came from, but I can promise you that ID kiting is a very viable and powerful tool.  I tend to use it often when I solo.  I am currently a 49 Rogue.  I use this in dungeons, I use this outdoors, sometimes I will even use it in groups.<P>   Contrary to poular belief this skill is <B>NOT</B> unreliable.  Does it stick on the first try?  sometimes, not always, but then nothing in the game is will stick 100% of the time.  Sometimes, I have to use the skill 5 times before it sticks, but eventually it will stick, even to reds.  But this is the same with almost every skill.<P>   ID would make the Beastlord too powerful, even if they couldn't fight while the mob was feared, as they would simply tank the mob till it sticks, then they would let the warder take over while they heal themselves.  When ID wore off, they would re-engage.  Wash, Rinse, Repeat.<P>   Now to make it even worse, you suggest making the sucess rate roughly 50% for blues.  Ummm, HOLY $417.  My Beastlord will be unstoppable.  I will solo high blues all the way to 60.  Move over Shaman, there is a new solo god in the game.<P>   BTW.  I use this ID, often early, in the battle to get the best effect from it.   <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>   Now on to the "camo skill".  While I would agree that Beastlords as a whole should get sneak, I don't honestly feel that giving us something that is both more powerful and far more useful than one of the Rogue's class defining skills would be appropriate.  Until the 50's.  Rogue, slow way down when using their skill.  And like what you have listed they are invisible to regular and undead mobs, but even they aren't invisible to see invis mobs.  What you are proposing would give Beastlords, the ability to not only move far faster than Rogues, but get past mobs that are all but impossible for the class, whose whole purpose is to be sneaky.  As a Rogue, I would make it my mission to get this one nerfed out of existance.  As a Beastlord, I would abuse this one so much that it would get nerfed in a matter of hours.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>As for camo? it may step on the toes of a rogue's ability in some circumstances, but not all. As for the high end game. I would much rather have a "class" on raids, especially failing ones, that can go in undetected by ANY mob and pull the corpse out with speed and reliablity. Infact if anything this would actually step on the toes of those classes that summon corpses (but NO coffin needed) The trade of is that Once you summon corpse of a fallen guild member you are visiable again but you do have the hitpoints and speed to beet ass back to the zone and drop off the corpse. I only suggest this as a high end alternative in being needed in tough zones.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>   Ummm, I fail to see the usefulness, given the limitation you place on it here.  /corpse has a range of 50 feet.  The agro range on mobs is generally 50+ feet.  Okay, so I camo, get within range of the uber mob that just killed my friends, hit /corpse, and run for the zone.  I make it about 10 steps before I get summoned and eaten for breakfast.<P>   Hmmm, Okay, so I /corpse, and immediately FD, and while I wait 10 seconds for the agro to clear, I get summoned and eaten for breakfast.<P>   Anyway, if you are going to make suggestions like these, please, please, think them through before you do.  These suggestions aren't needed to finish our class, all they do is throw up chaff and interfere with the things we really need.  Things like Valiant Companion.  Disciplines that affect our warders, class specific AA skills.<P>   And for god sakes, play a Beastlord before you try to improve it.  By your own admission in another thread, you know what Beastlords can do, because you grouped with one while playing your Druid.

Sorry to have to correct you Asseron  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"> But I see you are like many others that just don't read simple words in ENGLISH, or comprehend them.<P>Did I ever ONCE said beastlords should get ID. NO .. Did I put restriction on the "sneak" ability that would keep BST from Fear Kiting.. YES.. So as you see, you were totally wrong with your reading comprehension.  Furthermore, 80% or more of the Rogue community do NOT fear kite using ID past 30th level. AND it was your BAD assumption to assume that pet can tank while using "sneak"... I said the mob would stay feared till HIT..   HIT means HIT.. it doesn't matter who hits it.  OOOOF<P>As for your camo agrument you have alot of flaws in your assumption. It was only my intention to use this skill to be something unique for the bst that no other class has.  YOUR bad assumption that EVERY mob summons is crazy.  BTW mobs summoning have a reload timer and you missed the fact that if I played dead I would still be summon?  So your saying that MONK once summon don't stand a chance... WRONG... more illiteracy on your part, and bad examples..<P>I have a beastlord numbnuts along with many other classes however BST do have their limitation, which I won't cover anymore with some because of their double standard opinions they wish to use..  As for the AA skill or pet buffs for raids.. THIS will never happen so live with it... VI has a stance where they stand with pets and their strenth and it won't be compomised.<P>LAST COMMENT about Immune pets.. VI keeps track of this data of how much damage pets do and take and how much mana casters use in the process.  If VI made the pets immune to the many things you all want FEAR, RIPOSTE, SPELLS, this would inturn allow the pest to live alot longer with less troubles of ADDS as well.  This converts to less mana a caster has to use healing or resummoning a new pet and buffs.  The less time and mana a caster has to use on his pets and increase damage a pet would do would allow casters more offensive mana to be used on NUKE or DOTS.  This would over balance the Raid situation and VI won't allow that.   I can guarantee you that IF Verant would to cave into the winning of the casters wanting super immune pets, VI would inturn NERF that with either lowering the pet mob limit, or change the data on mobs to make then harder to kill.  IF you fail to see that you are stupid then I give you credit for.   <P>WHY in the hell do you think VI made so many mobs in LUCLIN tougher to solo then there cousin mobs of equal level in the older zones.  I was just in Skyfire today and tried out one of the NEW mobs to the zone, Nightshade Drake? (name could be a little off) and it was 100% immune to snare and roots.  Speed can not be changed is the message you'll get.  It is VI's vision that they want to promote more GROUPS of pc's.... not soloing or pet groups....

OHHH.  I have been mortally wounded and my logic is flawed because I am a numbnuts.  OHHHH<P>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Did I ever ONCE said beastlords should get ID. NO .. Did I put restriction on the "sneak" ability that would keep BST from Fear Kiting.. YES.. So as you see, you were totally wrong with your reading comprehension. Furthermore, 80% or more of the Rogue community do NOT fear kite using ID past 30th level. AND it was your BAD assumption to assume that pet can tank while using "sneak"... I said the mob would stay feared till HIT.. HIT means HIT.. it doesn't matter who hits it. OOOOF<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>   Umm, no, you were talking about the intimidation skill.  Sneak and Intimidation are two very different things.<P>   To add to the above statement.  80% of the Rogue community will tell you that a Rogue cannot solo for XP beyond level 20.  Does that mean that they are correct?<P>   600 years ago, 95% of the population of Europe "<B>KNEW</B>" the earth was flat.  Does that mean they are correct?<P>   Now, I tell you that I use it, and I tell you that I use it often, and that it is a viable tool.  I guess I must be wrong, though I can't see how.<P><BR>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>AND it was your BAD assumption to assume that pet can tank while using "sneak"... I said the mob would stay feared till HIT.. HIT means HIT.. it doesn't matter who hits it. OOOOF<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>   Ahh, so I assume from this you want Flash Of Light.  Based on what you described above and now this little caveat, I can only assume you want Flash Of Light with a small mem blur, because that is exactly what you have described.  Next.<P>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>LAST COMMENT about Immune pets.. VI keeps track of this data of how much damage pets do and take and how much mana casters use in the process. If VI made the pets immune to the many things you all want FEAR, RIPOSTE, SPELLS, this would inturn allow the pest to live alot longer with less troubles of ADDS as well. This converts to less mana a caster has to use healing or resummoning a new pet and buffs. The less time and mana a caster has to use on his pets and increase damage a pet would do would allow casters more offensive mana to be used on NUKE or DOTS. This would over balance the Raid situation and VI won't allow that. I can guarantee you that IF Verant would to cave into the winning of the casters wanting super immune pets, VI would inturn NERF that with either lowering the pet mob limit, or change the data on mobs to make then harder to kill. IF you fail to see that you are stupid then I give you credit for. <HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>   WTF?   Interesting.  So, you are saying that giving Valiant Companion would make our warders immune to ripostes, AOE nukes, and fear?  Kewl.  I knew the spell was powerful, but not that powerful.<P>   All Valiant Conpanion does is make a mages pet immune to FEAR for a limited time.  Yes, this would make a Beastlord a very small bit more powerful once we got the spell, but it would in no way be over powering, and it would add a small bit to the viability of Beastlords on raids.<P>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>As for your camo agrument you have alot of flaws in your assumption. It was only my intention to use this skill to be something unique for the bst that no other class has.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>   LOL!!!  No, you are wanting to give Beastlords a skill that is far superior to the Rogue classes sneak/hide combo.  Basically duplicating what Rogues have, but making it far more powerful.<P>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>YOUR bad assumption that EVERY mob summons is crazy. BTW mobs summoning have a reload timer and you missed the fact that if I played dead I would still be summon? So your saying that MONK once summon don't stand a chance... WRONG... more illiteracy on your part, and bad examples..<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>   hehehehe.  I guess I simply don't understand the flawed logic you are using then.  You are saying that you want this for doing CR's after a raid wipe out.  Well, most raid mobs over the level of 55 can summon.  Further you state that once you click /corpse, that it will drop.  Now, this means that it will drop while you are in agro range, so unless you not KOS to the mob, you will immediate gain agro, unless the mob is 5 levels below you, in which case, you will have 5 seconds before it agros.  Now then when it agro's you, it is going to come after you, so you use this FD kludge that you propose,  which means that you lay there for 10 seconds while the mob bears down on you and gets at least one round of hits on your prone body.  This one round of hits, since you are prone is at maximum damage.  Against a raid level mob, you are talking a minimum of around 500+ damage per hit, at a minimum of 2 hits.  So if you are lucky, you take only 1000 points of damage. and have to remain idle for another 10 minutes before the FD kludge refreshes.  All in all, it appears to me, that it is your assumptions that are flawed.<P>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>I have a beastlord numbnuts along with many other classes however BST do have their limitation, which I won't cover anymore with some because of their double standard opinions they wish to use.. As for the AA skill or pet buffs for raids.. THIS will never happen so live with it... VI has a stance where they stand with pets and their strenth and it won't be compomised.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>   Hmmm, I do not see others using a double standard here.   As for what VI will and will not do, unless you are tied into VI, there is now way for you to know.  Perhaps I am a VI employee, perhaps Taniwa, or maybe even the others that you have <B>FLAMED</B> for disagreeing with you.<P>   Believe me, I know exatly what our limitations are, and strangely enough, our limitations are not as bad, as you seem to want to make them out as being.  When I find a true limitation, I try to work around it first, and if I am still unsuccessful, I approach it from another direction.  If I am still unsucessful, I will ask others, like Nicodemous, Taniwa, Chunar, etc how they got around it.  Oddly enough, using the above method, I have been able to overcome many of the Beastlords weaknesses, and even turn some into strengths.

Just explaining the fact as I read them from verant and see them in action.  Do me a favor if you are so bent to believe that Verants vision is not changing for the worse.<P>Verants has admitted that SOW was a mistake on their part, in exchange more and more mobs comming into the game have sow speed. AKA Gorilla in Stonebrunt (who's speed can not be effected) Snow giffons in EW that are resistand and break root often, many new mobs such as the tribal in Luclin, the new nightshade drake? in Skyfire that is immune to snare/root... This is all verants way of making SOW less important fighting and if you fail to see that then you need to read more in the Druids/Shaman sections more often to see how this is making solo'ing that much more difficult.<P>More and More new mobs, especially in Luclin are underconned. ( read the boards ) and you'll see that more mana is required to solo these mobs, meaning more down time in medding.  Again VI is frowning upon those that solo and want to promote groups.<P>VI limits on pets that recently was exploited and changed, to include both summon and charmed pets.<P>Many key originators of EQ (Brad) and others have left VI to go elsewhere.  Will we ever get the true story about that?  VI is making changed to EQ in ways that many are not happy about (including brad and gang) and obviously the vision that Brad had differs from what VI wants now.<P>Some of VI's vision is OK but there is a purpose to everything they do such as the soul binders.. you may not believe it but that decision was strictly financial and had NOTHING to do with the game. <P>The Nerfing of illusions.  Back in the old days one used to use a variety of illusion to go to places they could not go because of faction.  NOW, VI has changed that to where ANY illusion makes you KOS reguardless. This was done so that you had to spend time to kill and gain faction, and not just simply do an illusion to bypass that.  This again was done for financial reason and not rollplay. <P>It is and will be VI's intention to make the game harder and longer to progress to keep customers paying each month. However some just get plain frustrated and leave (I have 3 good playing friends that have done exactly that) Hense "soul binders" were placed there because they felt like being nice.  Soul binders were put into the game because many "non biding" classes had a difficult time getting binds and the frustration of that was leading people to either quit the game or make a biding class to play.  <P>The only way to find out what is TRUELY going on inside VI and things are changing, (not for the better) is to talk to employees or exemployees (BRAD) and get the low down, HOWEVER, that will not happen for a period of 2 years.  Im sure every employee at VI are held under a "confidentuality" clause that prohibts them to talk about internal operations, visions, programming etc. etc. of EQ and other sister games.<P>Im sure that I'll probably be one of the first to leave EQ and go with Brad & gangs new MPORG when and if he can make it happen. I loved EQ when it first came out, however the changes in the past years are making it extremely difficult to enjoy it as much as it was in the good old days..<P>In anycase I honestly don't care if you like my views or not.  I state opinions based upon the facts I see first hand, not just cause someone says it's so. If you like the way EQ is evolving, then good for you, however Im not and niether are alot of others (Brad & gang included)..  I think with the developers of EQ leaving VI should send RED FLAGS up to everyone without blinders on.  People don't walk away from 7 figure salaries to venture into unknown territory if they are happy where they are... Common sense

OK Aaeorn, I'll make you a deal about that ID and fear kiting tactics you love to enjoy after 30th level.  I challenge you to take on 4 BLUE mobs of my choosing in which you have to solo without any OUTSIDE help or buffs.  If you survive I'll give you $100 and appoligize.  However, if you die, you give me $100 and admit you were full of bologna and delete your soloing rogue charaters. lol  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">

HAHAHAHAHA.  So now you resort to making fools bets to disprove a point of fact?<P>   See the problem with this is that it is far too easy to stack the deck against me.  I could just as easilly tack on to that, that I would agree so long as you solo 4 green mobs of my choosing.  I would then choose something like Torkel Battlemaster, who quads for 90's and has about 10k HP at level 25.  Then I would choose Raddison Quaak, who chain casts 300pt nukes which appear to be unresistable and is only level 15.  Fun watching him take out a level 60 warrior.    <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>   No.  I will not accept your fools bet, but I will make you a counter offer.  Learn to play a Rogue the way I did, then come back in 6 months and tell me how useless ID is.  If at that time, you still can't figure out how to use ID, I will come to your server and demonstrate it for you.

Rydeson why do you even play a beastlord if you think they are so weak?  It is obvious you aren't able to enjoy this class to it's fullest since you (wrongly) think we need some kind of escape mechanism.  My question to you is why do you fight in zones where you are constantly being hounded to the zoneline?  I assume the problem is fairly constant, or else you wouldn't complain so much about it.  <P>My answer for you is to play a necromancer, they get everything you want.  Logically if you were  a necromancer you would be happier with your eq experience, and everyone here would be happier because they don't have to put up with you makineg incorrect assumptions and posting useless ideas.<P>Although if you did start a necromancer I suppose you would troll their boards, and I don't need a bunch of angry necro's chasing me.     <IMG SRC="cool.gif" border="0">

Actually I need to move back up and correct you once again Nic for selectively taking parts of a story and stating them fact.  <P>1) shell shill as I recall I stated a boost in AC would be given to less any attacking blows down by a mob.   READ<P>2) FoL I will dispute that with you. I use this spell all the time maxing my Div skill out with it and the MOB doesn't care if you are number one on the hate list or not. FYI pet is the same HATE as it's master on the damage tables. And I have seen a number of circumstances where FoL did NOT fear off mobs actively in a fight.<P>As for Tan.  What can I say?  You need to read more on interviews that are posted on many websites that discuss EQ.  In fact it was just recent that VI stated that SOW was meant to be as a utility/travel spell and they are upset that it's become a prime tool in combat kiting tactics.  HENCE the changed in MOB's that resist/immune  snares or roots and the increasing mobs that are just as fast as sow if not faster. (lighcrawlers in seru)<P>As for mobs being overconned.  You obviously have never hunted in luclin yet.  May I suggest you go to virtually any Beastary list and forum and you'll see 95% of those that have hunted in luclin will agree with me.  25th level mobs in luclin (neth lair or seru) have more hit points and HIT much harder then 25th level mobs anywhere in the OLD world or Kunark.  This even holds true for those mobs that are 35th level as well.<P>I'm really getting tired of reading your post that are obvious nothing more then flaming with no clue what you are talking about.  Maybe I'll make you a similar deal.  If I find post that back up everything I have said, you can simply appoligive and admit how much of an unexperience player you are and leave.. lol  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>PSS.. HOW long have pets and riposte been in the GAME 1week? 1month? 1year?  Been there from the get going and VI has not doing anything in the past year about it, nor will they for a reason.  As anyone in the mage forum will tell you, PETS are an expendable tank.  VI concurs with this and hence YOUR pets will never come close to tanking as they are meant to die in raids  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">

I was think Beastlord's would be even better if we had Alchemy and or Tracking. Tracking could be the same as a druids skill level and Alchemy could be about half maybe? what youguys think?

Well D,<P>I have so far died only once and only zoned escaped a dozen times in my lengthy 30 level career. I see as well you make comments without fact and state that I hate my BST, whereas in fact I have stated already I love my BST next to my druid, and the rest are a close 3rd.<P>My purpose here on the boards is to have a little fun poking at the people that have double standards and just give them a good razzing.  The whole issue of new spells, or new skills is all wishful thinking for the most part as that will never happen. What I find the most humorous about these boards are people like Tan, Nic and Sshadow that have virtually cut down ever option anyone has made saying it OVERPOWERS the beastlord.<P>The BST shouldn't have this, or that because it steps on somebodies toes or takes about from this person or that person.  It makes the BST too powerful or blah blah blah,,, BUT in the very next sentence you find these "double talking" posters saying they want high end involvement.  EXCUSE ME.. That is what Druds traded off when they took a soloing career is that their value post 50 in groups diminishes.  The same should be for the BST too.  By adding skills as Tan wants EAGLE STRIKE or whatever or Sshadow wanting COMPLETE immunity for the pet steps on toes, and does make that class overpowering.  Having unreliable pets makes the attraction of a real tank important.<P>As so many would love to point out in the many post that I've read "Risk Reward".  Just like the argument of "Lifesaving" spells or skills.  These same people put that down with all the vigor they can saying "everything should have a risk".. EXACTLY my point as I'm having fun with in these little joust of posting  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">  YOU CAST A PET ON A RAID, THAT IS YOUR OPTION and RISK...  OPTION & RISK.... no one is making you go on those raids or making you cast those pets,  So if the pet dies or fears and bring back a train..... RISK you have to suffer, no different then the RISK I take crossing dangerous country without Invis or Snare/Root or hunting indoors without SOW<P>In conclusion to any of you that have read this.  If you honestly sit back and look at the LOGIC you have "thumb down" others is doesn't hold water to the argument why you want high end compensation.<P>BST can solo just about as well as any other solo'ing class, however in levels past 50 the pet thing gets a little risky in more and more increasing EXP zones as you get closer to 60.  The pet dies (common on raids) you lose value to the group.  Well I have a newsflash for you.  Druids have very little importance in RAIDS with no defining roll.  With what all the HIGH END game promoters are really crying about is that they want to solo if they want just as well, but have a DESIRABLE impact too on raids.  WELL I think that is overpowering and rather spoiled.  What you are saying is that you want your cake and to eat it too...   SORRY.. NO DICE  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">    HOPE you enjoyed the reading and have reflected well on all the post on who wants what and why?<P>All I want is to have things go back to the way they used to before all these lousy crying babies starting whinning  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">
