HI <BR>I think forced RP is great to manny just want to be uber and role-play on the side. Manny suggested that you can change alliments some how. Like I said befor 6 classes get powers from their gods. Claric,Druid,Shamen,Paladain,Shadow Knight,and Ranger. So they can't change at all or they arn't roleplaying are they, seeing as they lose all powers. Necromancers are evial whether they see it that way or not to practice Necrmancer is considered on of the greatest evials. thats 7 classes out of 13 over 1/2.<BR>2 races come to mind Dark elves whom the god of hate planted the seed of hate in them. THey arn't able to RP wanting to be good cause in EQ their god doesn't give them that desire and is effictive in keeping other gods from doing it. Iskar, preety much if you wanna change your Iskar ways you better learn to hide it. Calbis is your only hidding place without your brethern your dead and if you turn on them your dead also. so that limits just to a hand full of charecter (after you pick your god) that can actully RP a charecter and still change alliment.<BR>It be nice to have a RP good grouping with evial but if it was allowed 99.99999% of the time this won't be the case I might as well join another server and my Sk can group with my pali freind for uber exp and loot.Not why I wan't to play on an RP server.<P>Loot codes. wan't to point out Iskar shmen armour I'm still trying to find stuff If I got to high lv before I found the Item can I not get my armour? also for the bracer the 2 no drops are Warlord draewing pen can be got in early 20s with ease and Venimous Parchment I hear the mobs are 40+ whould I have to make sure I saved a drwing pen for 20 lvs? how does the code effect those types of quest? I RP my quest. I find them and do them alone I don't /shout where do I get x item at what lv should I be??? so I don't wan't to be punished if I find a item on a lv 20 mob and i'm 30. I should still be able to get it. (these is the scaled mystic armour Iskar shamen only BTW. and the drops are common no-drops)<P>One more thing all quest for exp/faction only NO-DROP. it defets the reason for quest. also makes Items hard to get like DF belts with my warrior when everyone and their mother is selling them 3-5pp each I'm killing orks to do a quest and have to /roll so others can sell thats not good questing. Quest should be left up to the quester to do. as for Item quest make the Items no drop sure than you can sell the armour but to get exp for doing nothing is bull.<P>--------------------<P>Raithen<BR>In my journys I sometimes find my self in a familer place that I never really been before.

First of all I like the idea about the RP server (Do I have to mention you should have made this a LONG time ago?)<P>Second of all it would be great if you would make it so you can actully "rent" rooms in inns. I know you can buy a key in Felwithe but thats about anything you can use that for. Would be nice if you had actully numbers on the doors and you could use the key to lock the door. Also this feature could be used for guilds or players to make quest for other players.Like the warrior who wants the bard dead cuz he was singing badly about the warrior and hire a rouge to go up and picklock the door and kill the darn bard while he is sleeping (Hey I know its a lame storyline for a quest but it was improvised).<P>Also I have only seen this key selling in Felwithe. Really is something you should make in every Inn out there in Norath. Also make the key stackable and when a player buys a certain amount of keyes (lets say 7) the key disapear in the vendors sales and the keys the player have bought "decays" one after one every EQ day. When the player have no more keyes in his/hers inventory the key will repop at the vendor. Making it so that the player can actully roleplay that he is renting the room for a week and dosnt have to wonder if someone will come up there. Also make those keyes NO DROP to prevent a easy way to twink chars (Buy 10 keys drop all gear in locked room and ect.)<P>I am sure you could implant even more small stuff around in the city making people able to RP. <P>A last idea would be to make people play GEMS against eachothers. Not everywhere in Norath but in Taverns alone. This would add two things. First of all people would actully use the taverns for what taverns now are for. Drinking and playing games. Second of all you would implant a new way to "duel" eachothers even that you arent within lvl range of eachothers. (Dont think you would see many people roleplay a duel if a lvl 8 somehow got to make a lvl 24 so mad it could only be solved by a duel).<P>Zoltrax.<P>"You cant cheat death, but bribe seems to work"

I posted something on an earlier thread of this discussion, and somebody replied.  Obviously, the replier didn't really grasp the meaning of what I posted.  I'm not just out there for MY rules on every server.  I just happen to have a different philosophy when it comes to defining roleplaying.  If a certain set of rules make it out there that I don't like, I'll deal with it, play on another server, or play a different game.<P>Anyway, many of the suggestions I've read so far for the new roleplaying server amount to nothing more than a dumbed-down blue server.  It's going to be a blue server with only 1 character per server and some game-enforced limits on how you can group and communicate based on race or alignment.  Oh yeah, don't forget the loot rule changes.  I'd prefer that a roleplaying server doesn't restrict grouping, buffing, and communications to that degree.  Yes, you'll always have some rules, but the rules proposed so far merely further ideas borrowed from existing fantasy sources.  If I can't group with a 'good' player because I'm 'evil', well that's just a limitation in the server rules.  If I explicitly choose not to group with an 'good' PC, because I'm 'evil', then I'm roleplaying.  IMHO, player interaction rules limited by game mechanics don't form the basis for a very good roleplaying server.  I'm not saying to stop this new 'roleplaying' server and discard the rules proposed so far.  Again, I'm just trying to present an alternative point of view about what game mechanics constitute a roleplaying server.<P>Some others have indicated that PvP is highly desirable in a roleplaying environment, and I heartily agree.  Roleplaying is, by definition, enhanced by player interaction; you notice it when you see another player interacting with you in some way.  Coming mainly from environments where the PvP threat is constant and can't be conveniently dodged by running from the arena or refusing a duel, I find this greatly encourages roleplaying.  Certain zones become very dangerous to be in because of the mere presence of certain players, and equipment selection, spell and song configuration, battle management hot keys, and which buffs you have constantly active change radically (for example, see invis is active most of the time on all player classes that can cast it on PvP servers).  If you kill some NPC's from my hometown, then I might have something to say about messing with the 'homies'.  Sending you back to your bind point with zippy mana and leaving your corpse in front of me is the ultimate in player interaction.   <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>Without a PvP theme, you'll just have a dumbed down blue server.  You simply won't be able to group or communicate with as many people, but the goal will still be to just go out, level, and get phat loot, albeit with only 1 character on the server.  I used to do the same on a blue server, but with less annoying inconveniences than those suggested by the Verant's ideas for a 'roleplaying' server.  I think if you expect a major change in player attitudes and playing patterns without PvP on this potential roleplaying server, you're going to be sorely disappointed.

Hello,<BR>My post directly pertains to the "Warrens Loot Code".<P>This does not eliminate "Bottom Feeding."  It just means  that players have to be more creative in the way they go about Farming items.<P>It also eliminates the reward but leaves the risk. and I hate to say it folkes, but green mobs at higher levels are a risk to most "Solo Players".  So if you are going to make a change like "the Warrens Loot Code" to all zones on a server, you should at least be consistent and eliminate the risk too.  This can be done  by making Green Mobs flee or avoid players that cannot benefit from killing them.<P>example con:   "An orc warrior trembles in fear at the sight of your awsome power"<P>That is the one thing missing from the game now, so to add it would surely fit in with the "Design parameters of the game"<P>If that was implemented with the "Warrens Loot Code" It would at least be consistent and fair.<P>Lets look at "benefit".  I am always seeing posted by Gordon or someone that the game isn't just about experience, but by implementing the "Warrens Loot Code" that is what is actually becoming.  One green mob may not pose a threat, but a dungeon full of green mobs does creat a threat.  <P>Implementing the "Warrens Code" also take away that usual Varent responce of "We dont want you to camp spawns and be bored; We want you to go out an explore and adventure"<BR>That just isnt practical for a solo player.<P>A RP Server should also cater more to soloability than the other servers.  But, at higher lvls even a green mob can be hard to kill, so you are again forcing people to group to be able to get magic items.  A solo player in the 30's is going to have hell killing a Blue mob and in some cases a green  mob.  Here is an example..... A lvl 49 monk will lose to a Green Hill Giant...unless he has alot of great items, which he wont be able to get unless he is grouped. (What is wrong with that picture?)<P>A lvl 30 player who wants a runed circlet cannot get one because all the green mobs will kill him on the way back to the Gobblin Preacher in Permafrost or they will aggro when he tries to kill the preacher.<P>Guys?  Come on......... If you are going to implement the "Warrens Loot Code" to all Zones on the New RP Server and take away the "Reward", then it is only fair that you take away the "Risk"   Green Mobs should not aggro......They should cower in fear or run away.<P>Calvert<P>  <IMG SRC="confused.gif" border="0">

To be perfectly blunt to start this off: I think this is a great idea.<BR>Granted, I don't like the idea of not being able to communicate with other races because I don't speak their langauge, but that can be said about real life too.  I don't like that I can't talk to somebody in Japan, but I accept it and do what I can.  If needed, I'd try to find another way to communicate or learn their language as best I could (good thing in EQ, you can learn faster)<BR>I have to say though, this Getting rid of no drop items is great.  This whole RP server sounds like the server is taking a step towards becoming "true to life".  After all, how many times have you not been able to buy something from someone because they told you it was a No Drop item?  It would be ridiculous (though funny)<BR>Though this same point can be argued for PvP, I'm against that for the reasons mentioned in Brads last post.<BR>I love the teams idea too.  It all seems very  fun and a great challenge for everyone who's been playing on the blue servers that can't roleplay as well as they'd like to with others and it will create another teams server without the PvP.<BR>The one character idea is brilliant because I'm one of those people that doesn't like to twink their characters.  I enjoy the challenge that my characters endure to get their items. (though, it's different if somebody gives it to me as a gift)<BR>The only part I'm against is the lack of grouping between "good" and "evil" classes.  I think that characters can be decisively good or evil by the way they play their characters despite their race or class.  I've met some mean paladins and some really friendly dark elf shadow knights.  I think an option to choose what your alignment is would be nice, though that could really tie in more with religion.  After all, there's a thin line between good and evil in someone's action sometimes.<BR>Just some thoughts.

Oops!   Sorry I left off that I like the rest of the ruleset of the RP server, I just dont think the "Warrens Loot Code" is good design as it stands....Take away the Risk with the removal of the reward and it is fair : )<P>Also, just as a thought......Players should be forced to play their alignment or suffer exp loss with an alignment change that would occure...... i.e.  If good players do evil things...their alignment should shift and visa vera.  This may be too hard to code, but it might help balance the Good & Evil teams, if it is possible : )  It might work better if it was PvP which it isnt.  Oh Well : )<P>Take care!!<P>Calvert

Ok now I am worried, it looks as though the 1 character per account rule is going to stick. This is not good and would be very deppressing. I am the type who enjoys to roleplay at least 2 different classes.. This would be a major disappointment for me.  <IMG SRC="frown.gif" border="0"> <BR>You say its a price we have to pay, but why? You say this is important, but why? I dont understand why this is a rule that must stay as it is. I see that in "true roleplay d&d" you might be only allowed 1 character, but in "true RP d&d" you also get only one life, and if you die, you need to start over. This is not "true RP" so why have just 1 character?  <IMG SRC="confused.gif" border="0">

I'm greatly interested in a roleplaying server. The hardest things to balance are enforcement and freedom. The game needs to encourage roleplaying by rewarding players, and in EQ, there are only really two types of measurable rewards, experience and loot. Experience is the only easy one to use since it is universal.<P>Let the players rate each other on how well they feel they are roleplaying, and have that rating modify experience gain in a small but noticable way. Perhaps 10% exp gain maximum.<P>syntax : /rate playername %<BR>where % is a value from 1 to 100<P>Some restrictions will be needed to keep the system from being abused. <P>1) Each player may only rate another once. If /rate is used again it alters your previous rating for that player.<P>2) the highest and lowest ratings are dropped off the list before averaging the values<P>The single player per account should keep the database down to a manageable size, perhaps a 4000 by 4000 page. <P>-Zaphod

I don't mind the RP restrictions that may be enforced on this potential server.  <P>Unlike VI, I always assumed PvP = RP.  Most games prior to EQ, were PvP.  How can you create a racial or diety tensions without it?  Why can't PvP be hard coded like the other RP restrictions?  <P>I firmly believe VI has done a remarkable job allowing the players to determine the environemnt we play in.  A few include the book of discord, Guild wars, dueling.  Imagine if more chose to turn in the book ... what would happen?  What if Guilds were able to have guild wars with multiple non aligned guilds?  That allows for PvP in a controlled environment.  I don't wish to preach how these could work ... I figure most can make the needed leap to understand how this could be controlled.<P>What I don't understand is the no-comprimise stance by VI about PvP.  There has to be a means to allow RP conflict to flurish that is in control of the players.  Why not allow for non PvP buffer zones around starting cities.  If two zones adjacent to starting cities were PvE, that would allow most characters to Level to 50 without worrying about PKing.  Think about this ... PvE zones would include: Lava, BlackBurrow, Runny Eye, Lake Raythe, TD, White Clad, the Hole,  CT, upperguk, Dahlnirs, OT, FV, warrens, Ocean of Tears , oasis, wcommons, Perma, Lake of Ill Omen, etc.  Basically, remote areas would be PvP.  What a way to make PvE and PvP available?  Just code the zone to be an arena and let folks know a zone is PvP as it loads.<P>Going back to the book of discord, keep the team buffing in place, but allow those not engaged in PvP to buff those who turn in their books.  To buff somebody when there is no hope of retaliation can be seen as non RP, but it would allow PvP players to group effectively with PvE players.<P>Anyway ... I'm excited about the prospect of a RP server.  I just hope it's got some form of PvP that is enforced like the other RP rules.<P>Anyway ... I feel that RP adds depth to the game.  I feel that PvP adds depth to the game.  I feel that having both isn't doubling the possible complexity ... but squares it.<P>A RP server with some form of open PvP would actually cause me to log into the game more often.  As it is .... I'm bored just evercamping.  <P>I wish VI would know that there is a thing called responsible RP with PvP.  Not all players 'gank' others.  I think these PKers would get upset with the RP of those surrounding them and run back to their DOOM server.  One of the most common flaimes I read about is when somebody mentions RP ... PvP players love to flame RPers.  I'm of the opinnion that if a RP servers gets them out of their world/server ... the happier they will be.

Although I'm still weighing in on the Drop/No-Drop issue, I do have something to say about the "Warrens" or "ABF" code being implemented as a standard everywhere in order to prevent farming.<P>I'm not a farmer myself, but I certainly see people's motivations for it, particularly as a new player to EQ with one midlevel character and some very low level alts.  I know that now I am frustrated by some of the creatures that have pummeled me for so long, and my inability to get some of the cool items that others are getting.  For example, I wanted to get a fighting baton on my own, but every excursion into Dalnir was a nightmare of lost lives and lost levels, such that I felt compelled to just buy one and move on.  But I feel resentment at *having* to buy things instead of "earn" them.  The problem I see is that right now people blame farmers for that, because they are seen as monopolizing the camps for financial gain.<P>However, I fear that frustration will only rise with ABF-Warrens code everywhere.  For example, I plan on going back to Dalnir at some point to give those wretched Kly their comeuppance.  However, I want to beat them the way that they beat me, i.e., handily and in humiliating fashion.<P>But does that mean that I should never get a Greenwood Bo Staff for my efforts?  Some would say yes, because I didn't "earn" it by being challenged.  However, that makes the incorrect assumption that I didn't work my behind off just to get to the point where beating Kly could be easy (I'm assuming there is such a point, of course).  In other words, if I spend 40 levels getting pounded, being poor, and being unable to collect useful items, why can't I make up for that somewhat by being able to *finally* get that item that I have coveted my entire career (even though it may not be "ideal" for my level anymore)?  If I'm not "twinked" or loaded with "uberguild" loot then a Greenwood Bo may still be useful to me in my 50s.<P>Or what about other RP reasons for fighting non-challenging stuff, such as to help out the less fortunate?  ABF code could actually encourage uber-twinking rather than slight assistance -- in other words, a high-level pally can't give away kodiak claws and greater lightstones to people since those are too "trivial" for her to get.  Instead, if she wants to help out others she has to help them by giving them hi-level loot because it's a challenge to her.  So if she wants to help make a guildie's life easier, then she has to give him a wurmslayer or mithril two-hander instead of a simpler weapon, for example. So now if my little sister wants to play, I can't go and easily get her some respectable but not uber stuff, I either have to a) give her stuff that is at *my* level or b) buy stuff from other players.<P>And b) is the rub.  Some of the fun of EQ is lost whenever you make it harder for people to earn things on their own instead of having to just buy them.  I completely understand the reasons behind a player economy, but I am infinitely more statisfied when I earn something on my own.  I don't want to pay 9K for an FBSS.  I want to kill the frenzy and finally know the joy of looting it myself and putting it on.  Sure I can buy Wu's armor, but I want to make it myself, and I therefore go through the tortuous process of collecting pelts so that I can increase my skill.<P>But now I have visions of people who are unlucky in either getting the frenzy to drop the sash or in winning the rolls with other players, having to commit suicide so that they don't level up to the point where the frenzy becomes green and they lose their ability to get a sash.  It's the Vox/Naggy proplem magnified, where people deliberately stifle their own development or spend all their time in one place so as to prevent themselves from "outgrowing" something that they want to participate in.  Or, they have to just save up plat and buy it from someone who was lucky enough to get it at the right level but is tired of it or something.<P>It's a penalty on exploring, also--now I have to worry about not leveling too fast or enjoying myself too much in Velious lest I hamper my ability to go to Kurns and get that d*** Berserker Club that I wanted a while back, and so on.  So the solution is to just stay in the same room in Kunark until you get what you want, rather than saying, hey, I'll go do something else for a bit and maybe I'll have better luck when I come back in a month or so...<P>Anyhow, my point wasn't just to complain, but to make a suggestion.  Rather than turn on the loot code and try to make exceptions for everything that it seems people are still going to have a need for even when trivial (i.e., Greater Lighstones or the like), Why not leave it "off" by default with the caveat that certain "uber" items can't be farmed out.  That way hi-levels can still get kodiak claws for people, but players don't have to worry about a level 60 necro and a dozen of his or her friends spending a day in Guk owning all the camps.<P>Again, I'm not opposed to the idea of finally being able to accomplish something after working forever, even if it becomes "easy".  I love soloing griffawns as redemption for the many times I was killed shouting for a bind at the gypsy camp in NK. EQ is HARD.  Maybe it's not so bad to give a player who's worked hard for 2 years the satisfaction of being able to hold the Queen Drachnia room by herself, and still be able to pick up a few items to help pay for spells and components....<P>--------------------<P>Liubai<BR>Grandmaster of the Ashen Order<BR>Hall of Heroes, Morell-Thule<P>"Real skill comes without effort."<BR>-Li Mu Bai, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon

Greetings,<P>I think a lot of the ideas for the new server are great. However, a rp server is not rp without pvp. I know there are issues with pvp the way it is as of yet though as well. So, here is my 2 cents on making this server the best it can be.<P>1) Have everyone con even no matter there<BR>   lvl. You never know what you are in for!<P>2) Anyone that kills a char that is not kos or threatingly becomes threatingly instantly to the other char's city as well as their own regardless of what zone they are in.<P>i.e. A druid wood elf killing a high elf cleric would cause them to become threatingly instantly to Felwithe and kel.<BR>This would make them threatingly to all High elf and wood elf PC's as well. Thus, they could hunt the murdering PC for a reward and faction increase =)<P>i.e. A druid wood elf killing another druid wood elf would cause instant faction loss to threatingly in his own city. Also making themself threatingly to all wood elf PC's.<P>In either of the 2 examples above, once they raise their faction to at least dubious to NPC's, they would become indifferent to their PC cousins, ect.<P>This would only affect the attacker, the cleric for instance could defend themselves without faction loss. Also, the attacker would become threatingly only if THEY killed the the cleric. However, if someone else, or an npc came along and killed them, no faction loss would occur.<P>I chose threatingly instead of kos so that the person has a chance to raise faction within a few hours. Basically a warning that you should not be killing those that are not your enemy.<P>Players that agree to a duel will not have faction or exp loss. And no looting would be allowed for duels. This would be the safe way for 2 people to handle a dispute.<P>3) Allow pc's to gain exp for killing those that are kos or threatingly, and loose exp for killing those that are not.<P>4) Fear and charm are major parts to several classes! They should be put back into pvp. Especially if you can train people like in Sullon Zek. Plus, if you implement the conning system to register everyone as even (white) regardless of level, I don't think the problems you had before would happen. An evil cleric most likely would not go into guk and try fearing everyone when he has no idea of what lvl range that particular person is in. And if they do? so what...I would love to be there when they get resisted from that 58th lvl druid that was helping out a lower lvl friend. Goodbye evil cleric! /wave<P>However, if you still see this as a problem, another suggestion I have is to make fear and char defensive only. This would mean that they would have to be attacked first by a pc before they could cast it. And it could only be cast upon those that attacked them. Furthermore, if the fear/charm caster starts the fight with someone, they could not use those spells on that person even if their opponent defends themselves. <P>5) I do not agree with your good/evil non-grouping rules. This takes away from roleplaying. Even though it may be rare, some evil race types can learn to be good. And those that are considered good, have become evil, more so than the opposite.<P>Even if you contnue with this kind of enforcement, please allow those with illusions to group. It would be great to infiltrate a party of the opposite alignmet and kill them when they least expect it.<P>Better learn the language though if you wish to be a good assasin =)<P>Well, that's just a few ideas for now. <P>thanks,<P>Myrkrul d' Agra<BR>TM

Hello All  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><BR>Just was thinking about what would happen if the warrior epic was no longer no drop with the rune sword substitution trick still enabled (hear it was quickly removed). Whole server would be flooded with RPing Jedi's in moments hehe.

I have noticed in more than a few posts about the new RP sever an almost resentment that Verant is going to place restictions on characters in the new sever and what they can and cannot be able to do.  Im sorry but that is the POINT people.  <IMG SRC="rolleyes.gif" border="0"> <P>Sure it would be nice if everyone just 'rollplayed' their character according to its' make-up but, HELLO!!, that's what EQ was orginally supposed to be remember.  <IMG SRC="eek.gif" border="0"> <P>I for one would like even more restrictions and penalties built in so that the only real challege I will have to stay in character is to get my characters syntax down properly.<BR>If I see one more Paladin kill another 'good' aligned mob or one more druid killing treants or wild animals, I think Im gonna puke!<P>The real problem I see with the new sever (in fact ANY new sever) is that the majority of people will all ready be EXPERTS in the beastality and geography at level one.  We will already know where to take our character to level him (or her) the fastest, which mob drop the loot we desire, etc. etc.  It would be nice if Verant could change the terrain just a little to throw the Role Players a little curve (Hehe I KNOW that doing that would be a LOT more complicated than it sounds, but I can dream cant I?)<P>Frankly a character's INNATE strenghts and desires should play a part in how it approches the environment.  IE dwarfs are historically (or should I say 'fantorically') money and gold hungry so why can't part of their stats reflect how much MONEY they have in the bank.  This would greatly affect how a person playing a dwarf would play.  Erudins are supposed to feel surperior in intellgence to everyone else in Norrath (even the high elves) so why not have the accumulation of scrolls, books and languges learned affect their ability to cast more powerful versions of the same spells others (say humans) can cast?<P>The point is that to role-play the environment must almost FORCE the player to assume the character. As Verant found out, if you leave it up to the players then there is always a 'KWEL d00d' to come along and destroy the illusion.  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" border="0">

Sounds like verant got an idea here (hate to admit it but give the devil its due). The first set of rules sounds good even/especially for PVP servers. You have the makings of a winner. <P>Now please turn this winning idea generator to the Shadow Knight class and who knows how many fans you will win over.

so far so good, i like how things are heading, cept for 2 things.<P>1) i dont know much about warrens loot yet, but say my high level guy, who is not all that uber on the eq part realizes hey, i could use the ring of wandering that will improve my stats and darnit silly me, the same place everybody else is getting that ring wont let me have it.  well i cant get it myself, cuz i am a loser, so i have to go make money now so i can buy it because luckily now it is droppable.  does warrens loot force people who miss out on eq from a certain zone to have to buy that eq or what, some extra info might be nice.<P>2)i like good not being able to group with evil rule.  i think lots of people might try to be neutral, but most likely that will even out.  but what about someone who has redeemed themselves, the Drizzt type.  How bout a quest that either the GMs or a NPC could give out, that allowed an evil to become good or vice versa.  the only problem that i have with this is those following gods, they would not be able to change most likely.  just a suggestion, hope you like it.<P>slick

some other off the wall suggestions.  how bout throw some random elements into the hole rp part. you could do stuff like...<P>1. make someone need to eat a hole lot more<BR>2. make someone allergic to the sun, so that during the day they get a negative to some stat or another<BR>3. someone who is slower than normal<P>you could have some negative choices to accept at creation to maybe give more stat points or have some positive choices take away stat points.  lots of RP games have done things like this, and its kinda cool at times as long as it is balanced.  let me know if you need any help.<P>slick

After reading all the posts ALL!! I think verant should listen to your fan base. This is the first almost unanimus thread of praise for verant EVER. screw it up by not listening to your fan base considering they have given some pretty good additions. <P>My addiditon to add is directly related to the classes. Please balance them based on the RP server. I am more familiar with melee so this is where I am concentrating. <P>Ranger is a hunter and friends of animals. (Not an offensive machine).<BR>sugestion: add double attack to the use of the bow and give bows melee weapon efficiency. Remove double attack from melee. Clean up spells set.<P>Warrior is a battle machine.(like his current skills set).<BR>suggestion: Change nothing<P>Rogue is stealth and cunning, doing most damage from behind, by surprise and with poisons. (NOT a melee damage machine).<BR>suggestion: remove double attack.<P>Monk is spiritual and physical.<BR>suggestion: remove alot of the mad weapons they have. otherwise change nothing<P>Paladin is a zealot warrior of courage and insparation.<BR>suggestion: must to be defensive based, and have enemy specific offensive melee based skills set. Abilities and spells should be bard like in Affect.<P>Shadow Knight is a zealot warrior of death and fear.<BR>suggestion: must be offensive based, and have most offensive melee based skills set. Abilities and spells should be offensive YET self preserving in Affect.<P>Bards are lyrical con artists.<BR>suggestions: Change nothing<P>I like an earlier suggestion of limiting the player gaming to level 30 to 40 and adjust the in game environment appropriately, such as merchants and guards at level 10 or less and creatures appropriate to stature. There should be no 30 level bear.<P>Remove the madness placed on armor, items  and weapons and focus primarily on the individual.<P>Take away the uber madness, such as dragon killing and god killing unless there is an Epic quest which temporarily grants us mere mortals the weapon or power to banish or maime them. <P>PVP or some variation of it whether on a new server or not would also be nice with the changes and rules set expressed by Verant and by all.<BR> <BR>Hope you continue to impress with regards to this RP server Verant.

What about neutral characters?  Will they be able to be buffed / healed by good & evil?  They should only be buffable by other neutral characters or everyone will bypass that rule by making their character neutral.  Kinda like the way chanters choose agnostic to avoid the deity problems.<P>Neutral is neutral.  They don't choose sides, they shouldn't be able to group / be buffed / healed by good or evil.  You can't be neutral and send your forces to help the good alignments.  You have chosen a side if you do.  Thus, create 3 distinct alignments.

As hard as it is for some of you to comprehend this, you do not have to murder your fellow player to role play.  When I am angry with someone in real life, I don't pull a gun and shoot them dead.  When I disagree with someone's religion I do not cut their head off, that's absurd.<P>Role playing is interacting in character, and does NOT in any remotest sense require being able to butcher each other.  Get past that and go back to Quake if you MUST kill other players.<P>--------------------<P>===================================<P>        Grimstaff Theurgist<P>===================================

I am VERY excited about this!  I quit EQ 3 months ago, but I will be back the day this server comes on-line!  I approve of the rules suggested. <P>1)The 1 CHARACTER limit will be a tough choice, but I think that it will make people take their char much more seriously.  I played on Siege Perilous in UO, with similar rules - players were much more ... professional.<P>2) The LANGUAGES will be an outstanding change!  I really hope that merchants and quest-givers only speak their native tongue.  Imagine a wood elf searching through Freeport to find an elf they can sell their good too!  This would make leaving your home area a very tough decision - you will need to learn the local language or find an interpreter to buy food and water and sell any loot you might get.<P>3) The NO GROUPING or buffs across team lines is harsh, but will improve the RPing on the server.  If an ogre and high elf need to help each other defeat enemies to survive on a desert island, they can.  They just won't split the exp!<P>4) I'm glad that the server will be PvE.  I played for the first year on RZ when the game first came out, and I RP'd a pacifist cleric.  I enjoyed it, but grief players just wore me down - I quit the server and moved to RN.  <P>This is not to say that you will not be able to fight for RP reasons on the server!  When I started my first char on Rodcet Nife, a halfling warrior, I noticed a druid guard-killing.  I shouted at her, in character, that she was real mean and should lay off my Uncle Budo if she knew what was good for her!  Then I challenged her to a duel.  (Obviously a level 1 warrior had no chance, but I was willing to die to help defend the Deputies.)  She accepted the duel, and slickly wandered over to stand next to the guards.  *sigh*  Well, I ran over and started smacking her.  After I had done a point or 2 of damage, she hit back.  Suddenly all the guards swung into action, running her down and killing her!  I still have no idea why they did't kill me first, but it wasa glorious moment.  I would think that MOST people playing on a RP server would be willing to accept a duel - it's not as if you lose exp.<P>All in all - YAY VERANT!!!!

Whatever, we've argued and debated, we have lots of Ideas. I'm starting to care less and less about others opinions and want to see this server live ASAP! As long as it's not completely screwed up, or is exactly the same as a normal server, I'll gladly take my characters on my other server, hand all my stuff to someone and move. I wouldn't mind starting completely over, and I would feel proud to be one of the higher lvl people, I mean, when the server opens, EVERYONE will be lvl 1 for the first 5 minutes, then lvl 2 for 10 and 3 for 13, and so on untill 2 weeks later, there is a lvl 50, and finally the range is 1-50+ in 2 weeks. It would be a thin and sparse community, but pleasent. After everyone is say, 30, then there will be few 1-20's. I believe this server will start out in the 2-3000's untill people start thinning out because of the atmosphere and then the true RPers stay. This sounds like fun, hurry and make it live.<P>--------------------<P>Leartes Mindgale<BR>Agnostic High Elven Enchanter of the Rodcet Nife Server.

Creating a RP server should also be about freeing up rules, as with restricting them.<P>So far most of the ideas for this server have been about restricting the ability people have. I.e. restricting who you can group with, restricing ooc channels, restricting Common Tongue, etc... All however being great, what about the balance? What about freeing up?<P>To create a true RP server there must also be some 'adding' or 'freeing' up. Otherwise this server will be just like the others, only with more restrictions. A great example of this is when Brad thought about "Disabling the no-drop flag on the RP server. Lore items would still exist, but ANY item would be tradable." I believe it is THESE ideas that will make the server, ideas that FREE up rules and allow for greater RP.<P>One of the things that the other servers lack (that is backwards towards RPing) is the bad support of deity interaction between PC's. I think a lot can be done to add to the RP environment if there was more communication towards this. Here are some idea's i thought of and hopefully others could thing of more.<P>Players deity come up on a /who list.<P>With the removal/restrictions on the /ooc and /shout channels, what about an additional channel for shouting or way of communicating that only people of your deity heard.<P>There is a removal or limitation towards who good's and evil's can group with. How about a freeing up to complement this and encourage them to group. Either an exp boost to good and evil groups that do not have neuts. Or the ability for a greater range of level's to group with each other. (For example two lvl 9 and 16 people would not group together currently, maybe some encouragement for this kind of greater range grouping could be implemented).<P>Joe

Hi everyone.<BR>  My thoughts on rules, can't say i like them..<BR> if I am a good char, and I need to spy on an evil group, in a regular server, i would learn the language.. and try to befriend the leader to join the group.<BR>  Now lets see.. if I can't learn the language.. OHH good (evil?) char!  Kill him/her (not what I wanted, at least give me a chance huh? same with grouping, HE(she?) can't group with us! must be the other side trying to spy on us! Kill!<P> nono! leave it.<BR> but pvp has to be spur of the moment, the only thing that wil stop a bully from killing you in real life is make the bully afraid, or make the bully think your useful alive. don't make people agree to duel, just let it happen, all the good will stick with the good, and all the evil will either kill themselves off, or stay away from each other.

OK, for a "REAL" RP server to be present you NEED to have some sort of PvP.  YOU HAVE TO!!!  Otherwise this server will be no better than the blue servers.  People HAVE to have the ability to choose their own path.   FOR EXAMPLE!!! If you piss off a rogue, then you are going to get a big surprise when his dagger slips in your back.  A rogue is not going to say "Hey, consent to duel me so I can surprise you later with a backstab"  There will be no surprise!!  The amount of REAL Roleplaying will be brought down.  Also I believe that Verant will never be able to make a REAL RP server.  NEVER!!!  All the immature retards will see to that.  10 year old kids (or people that act like they are 10) (no offense to the 10 year olds that can roleplay though) will get on this server and swear up and down that they are roleplaying there charcters but then there minds will go straight to thinking they are playing Quake 3 or something.  Verant will never be able to weed out all the non-roleplayers so the real roleplayers can have serious fun.  There is always someone spoiling it for us. ALWAYS!!!  So i believe making this server wil be a waste of time.  EQ is set in the ways of having a bunch of retards that don't know how to roleplay.  For us people that do like to roleplay, we are screwed.  We will have to go back to paper and pencil RPGs.  <IMG SRC="frown.gif" border="0"> <BR>I have nothin against them or EQ, I luv em both.   I just think that we will never have the chance to really roleplay on a server that has about 3000 "KIDS" on it.  <P>The main reason I think PvP or something like it is needed is for the roleplaying factors.  Like I said, I love roleplaying rogues.  Not for the "Phat Loot".  I just like roleplaying mischievious characters.  I was wanting to form a "Thieves Guild".  A guild as like in D&D.  A guild that is mostly thieves and few others to help.  I wanted to Roleplay a D&D like mobster guild.  You know ambush people.  Highjack people. Have a group of bandits..have fun roleplaying.  But that is not the only reason.   I believe if a Paladin walks up upon a SK then they will definetly duke it out.  BUT consenting someone to fight destroys the element of surprise..which I might add HELPS GREATLY in any fight.  A great strategy always includes the element of surprise.  Consenting does not leave much room for that.  <P>Well tell me if I have a valid point on any of this or not.  <IMG SRC="confused.gif" border="0"><P>--------------------<P>Prexus Server<BR>=============<BR>Feros - Half-Elf Bard of the 10th Song

I believe that the new RP server is a great idea.  When I first got the game, that is what I first envisioned it would be like.  However, there have been many complaints, the strongest being about language and loot.  The language problem, I believe, is exactly what it should be.  If you were transported into this fantasy world, you wouldn't immediately be able to talk to all the people in your area.  Imagine stepping outside of your house and talking to every person in the city you live in.  Understandably, from a gaming perspective, some bending of reality is needed.  There does need to be some way to have an organized way to sell things.  How about an auction hall in every city?  That way the rest of the people in the zone don't even have to deal with turning off /auction.  As far as OOC and shouts are concerned, OOC should be gone, and shouts should be limited to a radius around you (such as if you went outside and shouted.)  Tells?  I think that is the one area of language that needs to be bent.  You need a way to contact the GM for a problem, or, since this is a game, talk to your friends and family.<BR>Loot.  The biggest complaints I have heard about loot is that there will be high level characters who will farm an item/mob and that is why the Loot code is being put in so that you can only get loot from creatures near your level.  The other side comlains that it makes questing too hard, and that more items should just become NO DROP.  What about a compromise?  Determine which items/quests should be able to be done at any level, and which you have to plan ahead and do at the appropriate level.  It would be nice to have a balance between what can be sold/traded and what you simply have to go out and get yourself.  Maybe a loot destruction code, so that only the group that kills a mob can loot the item (this prevents twinking by having the low level character simply loot the kill.)  This wouldn't have to be done with all mobs, either.  I know I made quite a bit of money off of bat wings and bone chips that other people left on corpses when I was a newbie.<BR>Well, I had more ideas, but it's late and I forgot them, so I'll post again later.<P>Chantyn<BR>Lvl 20 Enchanter<BR>Destiny's Call<BR>Quellious Server

Ok, I'm personally loving the ideas tossed about. I just wanted to throw something out there that a friend brought up to me. How about adding in a market place to the city zones. We all have seen many unused buildings in each city so how about letting auctions only happen in them. Frist off this reduces alot of spam people dont enjoy in popular auction zones. And this gives a place to gather and sell. Set it to where there could be NPCs from other races to translate to common or something of that sort. This breaks the language barrier for a small area, but it is something you could see easily happening over a period of time in cities. Just a few thoughts.<P>Mairsail<BR>47 Magi of Tunare

Perhaps these issues have already been addressed, but I'm too lazy to read every message in this thread =)<P>For the most part, I agree completely with all the proposed rules for the new RP server, but I do have a few questions/comments.<P>-Is it possible to open all classes to all races?  From a game standpoint, an ogre wizard makes a poor choice, but from an RP standpoint, it could be a hoot!  I cant imagine any RP reason that any race couldnt be any class they wanted to be.  This year, even D&D made any races ellegible to be any class, or darn near close to it, they just made it more advantageous to be a more traditional class for race.<P>-Soloing should be made a bit easier regardless of class.  If 'good' people cannot group with 'evil' people and vice versa, its going to be even more difficult for those classes that already have a hard time finding a group due to class.  Also there are some people who like to RP being a 'lone wolf'.<P>-I agree that there should be no /ooc on an RP server, I'm sure they are leaving in /tells (RP reason, all races have specific person ESP?  lol)  If you want to chat about the football game, do it in tells or use tells to get a group and keep it in groupsay if all members of the group agree to it, or go make up an 'ooc for the RP server' chatroom and do it there.<P>-Will there be more GM involvement with more RP events? (Not just the standard werewolf invasion for 45 minutes, but an ongoing storyline with many 'mini'events lasting up to several weeks).  In my experience with text based online RPGs, more RP'd GM interaction equals greater player RP involvement.<P>I'm really looking forward to the new RP server!  And perhaps some of my friends from a heavily RP'd text based online RPG might be willing to give EQ another try if this works out =)<P>My biggest request, let any race be any class!!

This is regarding the whole healing issue.  In my opinion healers that are good usually will heal anyone they want regardless of the person being good or evil.  Its a role playing thing a person that's primary job is healing has a duty to heal others and so that person would feel it is necessary to heal those that are hurt.  A healer can choose not to heal someone because of things that person has done but most often healers heal the hurt they don't just heal goods or evils or neutrals just because they have the same alignment.  But if you do wish to put the restrictions on healing you really should make it so that a neutrals can only be healed by a neutral or at least require them to be in a group to be healed by a non-neutral.  I feel that this would make neutrals less of an unbalancing factor in game play.

This is in Regards to that Grimstaff guys comment up there.<P>I do not agree with people just running around butchering people either, but if their charcter is the type to do that then let it be.<P>PvP is needed for a RP server.  Like I said in my earlier post.  If you piss of a rogue for a bar somehow.  Then later he most likely will sneak up and backstab you.  With a no-PvP server that would be impossible.  And Sks and Necromancers are the typr to go around and slaughter anyone in sight.  Either they worship Inny or Berx, either way they hate people and kill 'em.  People just need to steer clear of these guys unless you arwe the same race or class.  PvP on this server shouldnt be abused like other PvP servers where you walk away from a guard and get slaughtered on the spot.  It should be there to spice up the game.  Roleplaying anyone would be hard if the possibilities were limited too much.  Rogues couldn't pickpockets.  SKs couldnt kill that halfling that was bad mouthing him.  And you would think that a DE SK of Inny would definately smite that little hair-footed dweeb.  I am definately for some sort of PvP to be used, although Verant doesnt want it.  Don't know why, most people think is would be better, but Verant wants to do it there way, not the way they the majority of the people that play want it.  Really weird in my opinion.  <IMG SRC="mad.gif" border="0"><P>--------------------<P>Prexus Server<BR>=============<BR>Feros - Half-Elf Bard of the 10th Song

I absolutely agree with myrkrul's post on conning people.  I also think that PvP should be aloud just that every PC should con even.  That way the only way of knowing what level someone is is by looking at there equipment.  But then Verant would have to find a way to end twinking.  Because the twinks wouldnt get anyone to try to kill them.  But that will also bring a downside for twinks  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"> . <P>For Example if this was implemented....  Lets say that a lvl 35 Wizard was offended by this annoying bard.  The bard was wearing a set of Lambent Armor. So naturally he thought he would be around 30th lvl.  So he thinks it would be a fairly good fight.  So the wizard sparks up his nuke and blast the pesky little bard.  To his amazement, the bard dropped like a fly in one shot.  To bad for twinkee.  Easy kill for wizard.<P>But on the other hand no lvl 10 people would even consider fighting that bard.  Because he has some great armor on.  They think him to be around lvl 30+.  So that twinkee would have no problems with people around his level messin with him.  And if he stays in zones with people around his level then he won't get that many people trying to kill him.<P>I think this kind of PvP rule would be great.  Because it is fooling in some manners and not in others.  JUST LIKE REAL LIFE!!!! Only way you can tell how strong someone is by seeing them fight.  If you see that bard having trouble fighting some dervs, then you know he is lower than lvl 30.  If you see him fighting Hill Giants...thats another story.  Blah Blah Blah..and so on.  <P>Great Idea myrkrul , but the rest of the stuff with faction I don't know about.  I think if you kill a Halfling then your faction should go down with the town of Rivervale, but not that much. maybe you should get as much negative faction from kiling a halfling as you would get positive faction with Qeynos from killing Gnolls.  Small steps.  I think maybe you should be known as a fricking halfling Killing Machine before they want you dead.<P>--------------------<P>Prexus Server<BR>=============<BR>Feros - Half-Elf Bard of the 10th Song

Some "let's make it work suggestions":<P>1.  Allow "free access" for one race to areas currently requiring "keys" obtained through questing.<P>2.  Make all quests easier to learn about "required" quests at the proper time from NPC's.  Spoilers happen because the game is too tough in eeking out necessary information.<P>3.  Create an "education economy."  Have NPC or player "schools" set up in cities where you can pay to learn languages, perhaps lore.<P>4.  Back off the KOS designation, making lesser penalties for racial, etc. hostility. You can be refused entry without being killed, for instance.  You can be permitted to enter, but find that no one will trade with you.  You can enter, trade, but not be able to use training/education facilities.  And some cities, modelled after Thurgadin, for example, can be designated "free zones," open to everyone regardless of race.<P>5.  If you're going to have races with shamans and no clerics, give shamans the rez spell.  The idea of keeping people together so that race and orientation to good/evil is more significant is a good one, but you can't do that if you don't compensate for spells currently denied some races.  You don't have to make every race "human," but the key spells, like rez, have to be made available to some magic user in every race.<P>6.  Heat and Cold should be more significant as well as language.  "Tropical" races such as trolls should lose power in "polar" country, and "polar" races such as barbarians  should lose power in "tropical" country.  Ice spells should be more effective on tropicals and in tropical climates; fire vice versa. Magic in general should vary its effects dependent on race. (I don't think code would permit this one, but it would be nice.)<P>7. Just as a practical matter to deal with greater communication difficulty and "Play Nice" rules, there should be a TINY bit more of PvP possible.  I'm thinking of "group duels" that can be accepted/rejected in most cases, must be accepted in rare cases.  The offer of a duel lets people who don't speak your language know that you are serious about what you want to do, and gives them the option of being serious or backing off.<P>8. NPC trainers should do more than stand around, maybe give lectures, books, etc., depending on what you are training on, maybe giving orders about "required" quests, etc. At least scare the @#$% out of newbies who are just standing around.<P>9. Older servers especially ought to be subject to such things as depressions and natural catastrophes.  Zap!  Every player loses 80% of their plat because of bank failures.  Zap!  40% of player characters find themselves washed up on the beach in their underwear having been hit by a tidal wave or hurricane. (More likely in Oasis than Rivervale?) Keep skills/rank/knowledge etc., but become a "stuff" newbie.<P>10.  Each city should have tax notice posted that will deny you trading privileges there is you don't cough up X amount of gold/plat once a year. Since the rez spell lets you escape death, you might want a new class, the lawyer, to cast a tax-exemption spell.  heeheehee!
