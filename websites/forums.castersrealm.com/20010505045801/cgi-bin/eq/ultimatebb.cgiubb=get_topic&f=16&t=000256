I got to have fun with 2 of them this weekend and I gotta tell ya these guys sucked  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>One was Angustus or something like that from DB and the other was Insidiouz also of DB.<P>Vs Angustus<BR>  It started off with DB guild in fear and 10 of my guild came in to have some fun with them, they had 20 so we lost but myself and one necro were still alive at full HP although we were on opposite ends of fear runnin our a**es off vs all the DB still living.  Angustus was the only one following me (i always check with f9 views when retreating) so I turn around and he runs right smack into a target click and a "youre target is too far away" X4 messages then Pillage casts.  He froze like it was the end of the world (I think he wasnt duel buffed) I saw him try to run from me now and click jboots but I caught up with SOW and mez/tishan/pillage/remez then killed with blind/discordant/mez.  I got about 25p from him in coins and he had bagged when I was catching up to his jboots.<P>The second time we were in another big war with DB and I had managed to mez one of their CLR and was mez/DDing him and all of a sudden insidiouz out of the middle of nowhere pillages me 3 times while im doing that.  I look at the CLR HP and its still at half then I look at my buffs and all I have left is 2 shields and a foot so im like F***it and I run with Insidiouz on my A**!  I resisted about 2 dazzle when runnin too. Anyway I tried to do the same thing to him that I was doing with angustus to lead him away from his friends but he quit chasing.  I looked at my buffs and I had SOW,group MR, and Rune5.  Although I was duel buffed those buffs werent my last 3, pillage appeared to remove them based off of what level the buffs were and left all the highest ones I had till last.<P>Anyway his fatal mistake was not pillaging me again when I was running off, he tried to tishan/dazzle me instead and I resisted the critical mez and got away.  He was also buffed with lvl 46+ SOW so he could have outran me easily if he got rid of my sow but like I said critical errors arent good and I wish he would have kept commin and ran into another pillage/tishan/mez like his other friend did but he didnt fall for the same trap the other did  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">  BTW im pretty sure im still higher level than he is so if he would have pillaged the groupMR I had I might have been able to resist the second critical mez based off level and still 60+MR and go on to beat him easily.  Oh well cant say how it would have happened since he didnt come, Unless he would have gotten a lucky mez it would have still been over for him though.<P>Nice try Insidiouz and Angustus and good job being smart and not leaving your friends to try and solo me.  BTW I do take duels from any of you DB ENC  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">  Rykker is the only one that scares me anyway, he wears HUGE MR 24/7 and is better than the rest at PVP.  I did beat him once at PVE though and didnt fight him in PVP so I guess i edge him out still  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>BTW my fight with Rykker in pve was just me and him both competing for a kill of a CLR mob in an outside zone and we both had to keep dealing with all the mobs that kept trying to come heal it and PK us  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"> I ended up winning after I mezzed the ones after me and started pillaging the ones he had mezzed.  I then DD'd the named (he had mezzed it so it didnt heal itself) and I ran off with it while he was trying to remez the mobs that were on him.  The best of the best should be like that.<P>Tsunamii Starshine<BR>52 Enchantress Rallos Zek<P>--------------------<P>Tsunamii Starshine

Dueled a level 60 necro a few days ago, outside the Seb bubble. I had no poison/disease resist gear worth speaking of and no potions, he had full blue diamond gear (This is with my blue server chanter). We both started with pets and full buffs. Assuming he was a fairly average blue server player (ie, little bit of duel experience but not much), I stuck a few crap buffs up before my normal ones, and clicked em off right before the fight started so I could dispel his DOTs. To my very large surprise, he opened up with 4 charges off a golem metal wand. My pet got on his pet, and I rapture'd him (Takes quite a bit of mana with no enlightenment and gift of brilliance =/). After that I recanted him once, theft of thoughted once, and then mana sieved a third time. Rapture wore before I could cast it again, and he started casting Pyrocruor. At the same time, his pet killed mine (gee, that took a long time), and started hitting me. I dazzled the pet, and then started casting rapture on him - which landed just a second after his deflux. I was now at about 40 hp and he was full. I rune 5'd myself, and mana sieved him twice more. He started casting envenomed bolt after the second mana sieve, but a well placed Chaotic Feedback interrupted him. He immediately began to recast, and I raptured him again. Three more mana sieves and I was out of mana - but so was he. He went spectre form to go for mana, and I cast clarity 2 on myself and then dispelled his spectre illusion - which was a waste of my time, I forgot that spectre illusion costs less mana than recant =/. Right as soon as I have the mana I dazzle his pet again, since I figure that's probably poofing soon. Theft of thought recasts about 20-30 seconds later and I drained all the mana he had just gotten. This left me enough for a pet, so I memorized that. Then he started casting another spell - which turned out to be a deflux; easily soaked by my rune. Pet recasts, I start casting it....as soon as it finishes he drops another deflux on me (not quite sure why). Pet charges after him, he uses harmshield...Dies soon thereafter (poor guy had like no hp gear). Was a fun fight...Would've gone a lot better my way if I didn't have to worry about the damn Ebolt (which would land on me 90% of the time and I had no way of dispelling). I think he could've played his cards a bit better - Pyrocruor is too easily dispelled, especially considering he knew I had no buffs on to get in the way for dispelling. Also, he didn't have himself DoT'd...But I'm not sure how much that would've mattered to the outcome (as I could interrupt approximately 60% of his spells using chaotic feedback and rapture), and he seemed to have poor judgement as far as spells went anyway. Were I him, I would've gone with lifetaps all the way - he had a lot of mana from all the blue diamond/etc. gear he was wearing and could've easily killed me with touch of night/deflux. He could've gone Demilich too if he were lifetapping more often (Demilich is the uber hp drain/uber mana increase necro spell).<P>Anyway, I don't usually share my PvP experiences, but it's a boring Thursday afternoon and I'm sick =(<P>--------------------<P>Branar Shmanar<BR>*Cohors Praetoria*<BR>60 Enchanter<BR>The Seventh Hammer

Good job taking advantage of him being from a blue server.<P>Ok he kinda sucked but oh well.  There was multiple times he could have done something efficient and would have won.  For Branar's info Ill name some of them in case he tries this again any time soon, he might want to think about it a little.<P>1) Cast self DOT on himself before the whole thing started.  Then as his first spell cast ebolt.  Won fight.<BR>2) Use Ebolt on pet to start. Huge advantage.  Pet wouldnt last like 20 seconds with his pet and Ebolt on it.<BR>3) If he would have used Annul on youre rune5. Then Deflux.  Won fight.<BR>4) He rooted pet before he went full out defluxing, it wasnt MR.  Big advantage.<P>Id like to see you interrupt all his stuff with chaotic and rapture when he is DOT.  Youre mana would last about 30 seconds and then he would be FM and you would be OOM.  Plus youre pet would be dead and his wouldnt.<P>Tsunamii Starshine<BR>52 Enchantress Rallos Zek<BR>Breakdancer Tsunamii<BR>29 Bard Rallos Zek<P>--------------------<P>Tsunamii Starshine

Actually Branar almost inspired me to get lvl 59 for Tsunamii.  I dont usually get to mez players that much and never in duels.  Sounds kinda fun.  But then again a 59th lvl bard with SSS sounds so much better than an ENC.  Then again I could take down whole guilds between me and an uber mob if I was 59 on Tsunamii  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">  Me + General VDeers would own Reverant (~6 guild alliance) rofl.  Oh that cleric sucks she shouldnt have been 55+ now she is Raptured.  Oh VDeers took down 2 more people.  Oh that cleric is CHing! Nope! Rapture youre a**!  VDeers takes down 3 more! VDeers is taking down there last cleric!  Just gotta keep these 2 raptured for a sec.... ROFL!  Oh no im LOM! Ill theft that awake cleric and then chaotic him hahahaha!  Peace out!  Welp VDeers Im gonna zone so you dont aggro me thanks for helping me with Reverant.<BR>VDeers: Thanks you own Tsunamii.<P>Tsunamii Starshine<BR>52 Enchantress Rallos Zek<BR>Breakdancer Tsunamii<BR>29 Bard Rallos Zek<P>--------------------<P>Tsunamii Starshine

Well Tsunamii, it is obvious that you are experienced in pvp with your enchanter. I hope to learn more pvp tactics with my enchanter from posts like this. Keep us informed as I feel undermanned on rallos vs DB and other pk guilds that seem to attack us enchanters far too often. I have learned good evasive techniques and rarely am killed by pk unless caught with mob like the damn ac camp in OOT lol. Have had probs with high mr warriors and SK's like Krek and such that like to attack us casters, maybe you have some tips for me I am in my 48th season and survived on rallos by making friends and leveling, now would like to get more pvp exp.<BR>Great post gotta hate DB

I was having all kinda fun yesterday in the arena trying to win vs an enchanter, wizard, and ranger from PDM all trying to take me down.<P>Then after the whole thing was over I owned the entire arena for an hour, I had tanks all over the arena unable to move and casters that I mezzed over and over.  2 of them got pets and said they wanted to fight me 2 people and 2 pets on just me.<P>AE mez did pretty well against them.   Locked up the necro and his pet first then mezzed the SK and his pet and rooted both necro and pet.  Discordant necro and gravity flux him then another discordant took him down.

<I>1) There are a lot of necro dots (splurtish) that are unresistable even if you got full blue diamond and thex dagger and double moggok and everything else.</i><P>All these unresistable DoTs (I think, anyway) are dispellable.

EBolt takes about 45 to do 1200 damage...Meaning the pet would've taken an extra 600 damage, something his pet can deal out in 5-7 seconds. 320 mana to shorten my pet's lifespan by 5 seconds?<P><i>3) Annul doesnt aggro pets when cast on the player who owns it. This was done so magical DOT's could be dispelled off of players with pets, etc.</i><P>Maybe different on blue servers (where you have to be grouped to annul another player unless you're dueling him). I'll test tonight, but I'm pretty sure when he opened up with the golem metal wand my pet went running.<P><i>4) I was referring to rooting the second pet which you said you summoned and you didnt say you enchanted.</i><P>At this point he had almost no mana and his health was draining quickly (good resist gear doesn't leave much room for HP/AC, and he had lich on too). Even if he had rooted the pet, how would he have gotten mana back? ToT + mana sieve + melee to keep him from sitting. He would've just been delaying the inevitable.<P><i>VDeers is lvl 60+ and unraptureable, I meant just straight helping him out but I was in fact kidding.</i><P>Actually he's level 63+ (cons red at level 60). I knew you were kidding, found it rather amusing  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"><P><i>Also Caenem no charmed pets cause no more exp lose than jumping off a cliff or dying to a DOT, or by a pet kill, etc. But then again that all causes exp lose on blues.</i><P>Pet kills are no xp loss on blues, and neither is dying to DoT by another player (not bleeding death, but where you get the XXX has been slain by YYY). Not sure if charmed pets cause xp loss.<P>--------------------<P>Branar Shmanar<BR>*Cohors Praetoria*<BR>60 Enchanter<BR>The Seventh Hammer

2) Ive never seen a necro pet do 600 damage in 7 seconds much less 5 but then again im not lvl 60.  Thats what quad 75's every round every time max damage?  Also in 5 seconds that would have saved him from a theft and sieve or sieve and pillage?  5 seconds is a lot, most duels are lost where someone hesitates more than 1 or 2 seconds.<P>3) Definately on Rallos you can dispell other players and the pet will just chill.<P>4) Root the pet instead of hitting youre rune with a lifetap would have definately been better, Personally I would have rooted the pet then used the last charge on the wand and lifetapped you, if I was in his situation.  He definately had the time and mana to do those things from what you say he did in the duel.<P>5) I was given bad information that any time you die you lose exp on blues.  I guess I am wrong though if you are correct.<P>Tsunamii Starshine<BR>Breakdancer Tsunamii<P>--------------------<P>Tsunamii Starshine

Yes I do have an Ego, but its earned.  Ive got owned oh **** those 6 DB that wasted me the last time really kicked my ass, too bad I didnt get the Talnayen kill before the other 5 got to me.<P>Ok now thats over with.<P>Now on to subject#2 I swear to god I saw a char with a name VERY near Insidiouz in fear, could it be youre guild lvl'd you and played youre char in fear?  <P>Anyway assuming you somehow arent lying the name changes, ok and.  SOMEONE dispelled me 3 times and when I was retreating to regroup and go back in I resisted 2 dazzles and I go to 3rd person to see whose following me and I see someone behind me with a glamour rod and when I click that person I get a name that looks VERY near Insidiouz when I glanced over at my target box and keep runnin to get the follower away from his friends and turn around and the follower wasnt there.  OK are you happy now?  If you still think thats a lie ask all the enchanters in youre guild who it really was and they will tell you they did it unless they for some reason are ashamed or dont want to.  BTW Did you say whas up to angustus?  He will tell you his guild had to revive him after he screwed with me.  Oh I guess you didnt want to bring that **** up huh?  Whatever.<P>The arena I was talking about was the arena at rathe because it was right after the best of the best rangers.  But then again you werent there right?  More people playin youre char... Do you ever even play youre own char?<P>BTW I dont talk like a wigger I talk like a skateboarder.  Thanks.<P>If Rykker was sayin that stupid **** he must be the average two faced person I would expect from DB.  Not like he didnt talk to me about strats and ****.  If he took some of the advice I gave him he is probably a better enchanter than he would have been without too.<P>Actually askin gray might not be a bad idea to see who the person was that did that stuff you keep *****in about, heaven forbid he tells me it was youre char.<P>Please come school me Insidiot show me what its like to get owned.  Have ANY cleric in youre guild try to own me, another one of the classes Ive practiced real pvp against.  Put me up against any druid in range.  I can more than likely take any mage in range too.  Beat Wiqid and Talnayen at the same time a while ago.  Wiqid died and Talnayen got off a gate.  Oops that sucks Im a gay ENC because someone got away.<P>I was in the "Blood Coven" guild for around 4 days, oh ****.  And they arent gay either, they are nice people not like a lot of people that im talking to right now.  I didnt like the way the guild was run so I quit my bad.  I was what lvl 8 at the time?  Ok my freakin bad, did I mention my mom was the one that got me hooked on EQ and started me out in the guild at lvl 1?  Oh god its the end of the world.  Oh no now you will thrash my RL.  Oh well Im not ashamed Ill tell anyone my mom got me on EQ.<P>My name Val'Sharess? It used to be Starshine why do you think I sign with the name Starshine?  Its my name, I married into the Blood Coven.  I married their leader and Im proud of it.  Two girls get married you ask?  I guess you must be a RL girl too because I know youre gonna flame that and I know guys dont flame girl-girl relationships from everything I learned in my RL life.<P>Silmadell, EVERYONE called you a newbie because of all the stupid things you said.  Either you are one or you pretend to be.  Dont pretend like I was the only one.<P>Whas up with all talk?  Have you even threatened to face me on the battle field?  Who do you know besides Maule that got kills one me(that werent in a group at the time).  I think Maule is the only DB to ever get a kill on me solo and he got 2.  They were both one shot Ice comet kills when I was in my 40's also.  I must suck, hell I was medding from fights for both of them and one of them I was also AFK on top of that.  Tell some DB to come try to beat me down solo, I could use some fun in this game on my ENC, it has been a while.<P>My bad I followed Riga's tactics, he is the reason I started my enchanter, really? No kidding.  I would be pretty damn sorry if I never asked him how to PVP, or at least Id be behind the curve.  He has some good advice.  You wouldnt know that though you probably learned everything about EQ on youre own.  MY BAD I used someone with knowledge as a base for my own.  I guess you taught youreself everything you learned in school too since youre all about not learning from teachers and ****.<P>BTW Im one of the nicest people anyone will ever meet unless you meet me on the field of battle and happen to be an enemy.  I do so much **** to be nice you wouldnt believe it.  You wish you could be like that so STFU.<P>Tsunamii Starshine<BR>52 Enchantress Rallos Zek<BR>Breakdancer Tsunamii<BR>30 Bard Rallos Zek<P>--------------------<P>Tsunamii Starshine

<i>2) Ive never seen a necro pet do 600 damage in 7 seconds much less 5 but then again im not lvl 60. Thats what quad 75's every round every time max damage? Also in 5 seconds that would have saved him from a theft and sieve or sieve and pillage? 5 seconds is a lot, most duels are lost where someone hesitates more than 1 or 2 seconds.</i><P>His pet was (I think) quadding for 55s, plus jumpkicking (he used the monk pet) for uh...Heh, I have no clue. I assume it was more than 55  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"><P>My point was really that, because the pet didn't last very long anyway, casting a 6 sceond spell (that I could have easily interrupted anyway) that costs a noticeable amount of mana just to get rid of my pet when it was gonna die anyway would probably be a waste of his time.<P>Insidiouz:<P><i>she also a wigger LOL OMG you a marine that trys to talk ghetto,your a wigger lol...</i><P>Haven't we already had this conversation before? Didn't you apologize once already for all the personal slander you heaped on her?<P><i>its a game....</i><P>Then why do you care enough to post on a messageboard that revolves <b>around a game</b> about your reputation that's she's destroying (or her own that she's boosting) <b>in a game</b>? If she was really making this stuff up, then it doesn't matter, right? It's just a game? Quit the hypocrisy or stop telling us that it's "just" a game.

I agree you could do that strip mez tash mez type thing but IMHO the proper line is Pillage Tishania enthrall, followed by pillage/enthrall recursion till you could get enthrall stuck on.  Then follow with pillages till you break youre own mez and then mez them again and drain mana and then kill.<P>Regardless, If you are facing a VERY prepared opponent they require a pillage/strip/pillage/strip/tishania/enthrall to even have a chance.<P>BTW After SOMEONE pillaged me 3 times I still had up GroupMR, SOW, and Rune5 as the last 3 buffs I had out of the max 15 after the other 3 got dispelled.<P>Tsunamii Starshine<P>--------------------<P>Tsunamii Starshine
