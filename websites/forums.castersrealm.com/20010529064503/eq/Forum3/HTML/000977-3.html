</FONT><HR>In my playing time which is less than a month I have noticed the following:<P>Every starting city guilds have quests to aid the new characters to level up to 8-12.  Then it stops, no more guild specific quests.  You are now on your own to gain levels and set goals which in my opinion sucks for the casual player.  It is already hard leveling solo(casual players have a hard time grouping), now once they "hear" about a good xp area or an item to improve their characters stats they go and it is overcamped by classes that cant even use the item and are way too high for the spawn itself.  If you ask the players there why are they camping the spot the replies are usually "it is for guild memebers" or "we are aiding a much lower level character get this" or "the xp/loot is so awsome here....."<P>Realistically there is no way to stop overcamping by serious players.  Verant could impose xp/loot penalties based on time at spawn, but they wont. <P>If Verant was serious about attempting to cater to its players and give a surrealism to the game it could, but they wont.<P>Verant could easily make class specific items no-drop and/or code items so only that class(es) could pick it up, but they wont. <P>Verant could also keep specific(only that guild. example: only an erudin mage could get xp from completing an erudin mage quest and no one else) guild quests going all the way up to the current max level 60.  Offer special items(no drop/class specific) as well as xp. That would keep the high level characters away from farming low level spawns.  It would also give the casual player goals that they can realistically achieve, but Verant wont do this.<P>Verant could also use the one thing that I havent seen used in gameplay so far.  The deities.  That is an option I think that has vast opportunities to increase gameplay in every aspect.  From character creation, to gameplay, to quests, to certain items, etc.., but they wont use it.  <P>The reason I see Verant not changing or improving any major aspect is that it fears it would lose its serious players.  <P>Think about it some person has spent a god awful amount of time getting his/her character up to level 50-60.  Now lets say Verant comes out and makes a(or several) major change(s) to the game(quests, items, deity aids, etc).  This level 50-60 may lose some of its items, unable to obtain some items, deity choice starts hurting the characters development(the past comes back to haunt it etc).  What do you think this person would do?  Verant fears this person would quit and go on to something else, sure there are those who would shrug it off and continue or restart, but how many? <BR> <BR>I am sure there are alot of game improvement ideas floating around the game design arena in Verant, but nothing major to improve gameplay/surrealism for the casual player will ever happen.  <P>Haquiem 27th Mage <BR>Morrell-Thulle</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000050&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I use to play a text RPG called dragonrealms. One of the most exciting thing about that game was a festival. It lasts anything from 1 day(24hrs) to one week. During the festival, there are merchants selling some cool stuff that costs lots of plats. There are also items for lower levels costing alot less. These are special items that can only be found in the festival. Once the festival is over, you can only buy these items off a player. Festivals are held 2-3 times a year. They are announced maybe 2-3 weeks in advance, thus giving people enough time to plan for it. If you can't make it, you can ask a friend to buy for you on faith  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">. There is usually a GM runned auction too for some unique items that goes into 1000s of plats. The stats on these items should be unbelivable. What these festivals does is it bleeds money out of the game. Many people will hoard their money when the festival comes around. Many others will sell their stuff, sometimes at a lower price to raise funds for these festivals. This, I think is a good system to help the casual gamer get things they otherwise cannot attain due to time constrain. What may also happen is that power-gamers will go hunting for the best money generating mobs and free up some of the camps for the quest items that you wanted. Verant can also create some no-drop items with decent stats at lower prices for newbies. I hope this suggestion makes sense  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000051&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>This thread hit home with me.  A couple of weeks ago, I died two times due to problems that I would describe as being server/software related.  I lost a level and really took a look at how long it was going to take me to get my xp back.  It worked out to almost a week of playing time for me.  <P>I'm a level 25 enchanter.  The frustration really set in when I hit the low 20's and found out how hard it was, and how long it took, to get into groups.  This is my biggest problem with EQ.  I don't really care if folks want to camp for the Supermegagatorscale Codpiece.  I realize that I will have to buy those items that require a long camp.  Luckily, I've put my business sense into making money while I play.  (Don't get me started on selling my jewelry... selling is another time-waster when items on EQ live forever.)<P>What I DO care about is getting online and spending an hour or more shouting for groups.  If you aren't a powergamer, it is fairly difficult to become well-known, particularly when your friends level faster and then move on.  I can't stand the time it takes to group due to the crowding on servers.  I've traveled all over and it is the same everywhere I've been on the mainland (except Guk, perhaps).  Yep, I went to Kunark to hunt.  So far, it is a LOT less crowded in the zone I'm hunting and there are a LOT more targets.<P>So... I've accepted the fact I won't be equal.  I will no longer feel the pressure to level or have the best stuff.  I will play when I want to play and quit when I want to.  If I don't find a group, I do something else (sell, quest) or go read a book.<P>Suggestions for Verant:<P>1. More targets that give xp = more grouping opportunities.<BR>2. Have vendors pay more for items.  This will cut selling time down and take items out of the economy.  (4gp for a splitpaw item is ridiculous).<P>Travst, 25 Enchanter of Prexus<BR> <A HREF="http://www.mindspring.com/~travst" TARGET=_blank>www.mindspring.com/~travst</A>  for my VerantMasters site!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000052&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>We'll see about the 70% retention rate when there is actually a game out that can compete (there isn't currently).  Personally, I don't think DII is the answer, but the fact of the matter is that the game is fundamentally flawed (in my opinion), and is a power-gamer's paradise (we will have all the cool items and be 3l33t you will never get them).  I don't agree that we would become bored if things were more easily attainable- I'd just make more characters if it didn't take so much time to level them.  Also, the reason "uberguilds" exist is because the game was designed for them to exist.  It takes 30+ people to kill a dragon or a god, and the best multi-group coordination (what it takes to be successful) is in a guild.  It follows naturally from their game design.  If I had designed EQ I would have tailored it to anything doable by an appropriately leveled and equipped group of maxium size (6 in EQ's case).  At the most 2 or 3 of said groups, but then only very rarely. There is also the matter of needing huge blocks of available time to do these things- not something everyone has available.<P>As it stands though, the only loyalty EQ (and really  Verant Interactive) has instilled in me is, "I'll keep paying so long as there is no alternative".<P>My two bits on the matter.<p>[This message has been edited by Raggrok Skullcrusha (edited 05-18-2000).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000053&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Well I'm a lvl 41 enchanter and just traded my fbr for a gsd.  I have my sol ro quest items. (mask, wand, gloves)<P>I used to play 3 hours a night every night during the week and maybe 10-12 hours over the weekend.  I did very well with this and could pretty much keep pace with those that played a lot more hours.  But all I did during these times was fighting and xp gaining which burned me out really fast.<P>My play time is a lot less now that I'm higher levels because it takes longer getting into a group, takes longer getting to a place to fight, blah blah.<P>I won't even log on my enchanter now unless I have a 3 hour time frame set aside.<P>I'm only playing still for one reason.  EQ, as bad as it is, is still the best MMORPG out there.

</FONT><HR>At the rate at which I can currently game it's gonna take me 3-5 years to get to 50, this is a way for verrant to lock us casual gamers into having to pay for their services for a long time, which I can't blame them for I have been playing since the game's release I finally hit 29 with my primary character and 25 with a seconday, now if I were to combine the xps for both characters I would have a level 32-33 prinmary character because I play a de sk not the best choice for a casual gamer because of the outrages xp penalties and thats a de not a troll/iksar who is worse.

</FONT><HR>Someone herein said it well - Gordon/Abashi MISSED the point fo the posed question.  (Once again - he does this too often trying to placate too many people, but it is a tough position to be in.)<P>Regardless,<P>"casual gamers" shoudl NOT have to settle for either:<P>a) Play the game for fun, and not quest for items, as this takes to long.<P>or <P>b) Spend every waking moment questing for items at 8-hour camp/spawns.<P>It was said here, somewhere before and I'll say it again...<P>Questing does not have to mean "camp one spot for 8 hours", Gordon.  It could just as easily me a 4-part series of 2-hour quests.  These "portional" quests would cumulatively require the same 8 hours (or more) needed for quests, but be "doable" by those of us who love EQ, but also have social/professional lives to juggle.<P>As a Cleric, I know I'll never see a full set of class-specific armor for just this reason.  I'd LOVE to try for it, but don't want to waste my few allotted hours of EQ per week camping some overcrowded and slow spawn.<P>This is not hard, nor disruptive of EQ as it is.

</FONT><HR>As a casual player as well, the post about the ridiculous emphasis this game has on long duration camping hit home squarely.  I personnaly have RL friends that for one reason or another can be on 24-7, so I send them out for any items that I really need and just cannot get on my own due to time constaints.  However to all you players that say don't whine be happy or the ones who say can't get to level 40+ as a casual gamer I say PHOOIE!  I can get to 60 as a casual player with help from my friends of course, but the point we need to raise is, there is a certain assumption in equipmantage that is inherent in MOB classes at certain levels that make them alot harder if you don't have that equipment!  Now I also agree that there should be a few really rare items, I won't miss not having them, but can anyone say that class specific armor should be among them?  And the best point is, Verant just plain sucks at rewarding Roleplaying!  I have been lucky to come across a few of the GM events in verant, Roleplayed whatever my particular character was at the time to the hilt, and might as well be walking around saying "kewl dood!" and "Phar out" for all the reward or notice I got.  Now, before ya say it, I have been playing in MPD's for more than 12 years and I roleplay very well thank you.  All the other MPD's I have played reward this, and if you are good they reward it substantially, Verant really lacks in this and it does need to be addressed.  It can be an area that casual gamers can shine in, and get rewarded for doing so, No long camps involved no hunting up a group or waiting for a grouplist to open up.  And please let us make the standard equipment of a class available to us that can only play 20-30 hours a week.  Dang longer post than what I wanted, well that was my two-cents worth.<BR>Gregory the Druid.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000058&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

But yet I seem to manage to get everything I need.  I just know places that drop too much loot for thier level and kill em then buy everything.  Let the people sit on thier ass for hours to get a item to sell.  Ill buy it then laugh at them cause i played and had fun the whole time earning the mioney.  And they just sat and watched a screen.  ANd hell if you feel underpowered go exploit.  God knows they are all over.  Just dont get causght yuo can go from level 1-35 in 4 days played I know i did.

</FONT><HR>Gee thanks newbie. You are saying items dont help. They dont at your lvl. Try going Nekid on a plains raid if you think items don't matter.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Meudar:<BR><B>In response to Ticked's message above, it's entirely possible to enjoy this game without being the "best for your lvl"  If you wish to be a casual gamer AND have the best equipment, then sorry, you don't have a prayer.  But Gordon's post is entirely valid.  You don't have to seek out the best stuff for your lvl to enjoy the game.  <P>I play a heck of a lot less than 40 hours a week, and I have a blast.  I see tons of people who are my level (21), who have way better items than I do.  But that doesn't bother me.  My fun isn't relative to my status to other people.  <P>If your enjoyment of the game comes from obtaining the best stuff, then you'll have to get in the camp lines, and spend oodles of time.  But don't blame the game for that.  You chose that playing style, so you have to put in the effort.<P>As to the post that wanted an 8 hour quest split into 4 2 hour sections, that's tough to implement.  If you make four separate 2 hour quests, they'll be even MORE camped because of the shorter time to complete it.   So you'll end up with even less of a shot to get that item.  At least an 8 hour quest time will scare off some people.</B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000060&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Camping is such a bad way to distribute items. This is everQUEST right? <P>If I want to get the superawesomebladeofslicing for my character, it shouldn't involve sitting on my arse for 6 hours waiting for some stupid MOB to "drop out of the sky". Why can't this item be linked to a quest which takes me 4 hours to complete because I travel Norrath, talking to NPC's, seeing the world, and.....OMG actually questing. <P>Verant, please stop the this MOB drops this and that MOB drops that mentality. Maybe I have to get the superawesomebladeofslicing from a particular NPC, but there has to be a better way than just sitting and waiting for him to show up so I can kill him and loot him.

</FONT><HR>Had to chime in on this one...  I'm a casual gamer these days (2-20 hours a week these days).  Now, in Abashi's defense, I've found that 1 hour spent searching web-sites for info beats the crap outta spending 100+ hours trying to "discover" this stuff on my own.  I'm sorry, but EQ is just too damned SLOW to discover anything but the bug or "imbalance" of the day.  The core player (IMHO) needs at least a 5-hour session to make any real productive progress.  That's just the way it goes.<P>I genuinely feel that the scale's been tipped to heavily in favor of 'dealing with' the die-hard power-gamers.  Granted, they spend the majority of time on EQ (and make up the majority of in-game stuff), but I think the checks put in for them have soured the game for the rest of us.<P>I can live with the fact that some stuff is just butt-hard to come by.  I have on rare occasion had a rare spawn pop up on me, and cracked it to see what dropped.  TOO damn many times it was some no-drop dongle needed by some monk or warrior (i.e., NOT MY CLASS) and basically WORTHLESS to me.  I generally pass word along via /shout, but some folks aren't as nice.  No-drop (and its kin, LORE) has been FAR overused as a blanket 'solution' to several problems (some of which it can be argued are now gone thanks to the E-Bay prohibitions.<P>I genuinely feel some of this quest stuff should be put on wandering RANDOM-POPPING mobs (or at least have the pop-point random).  I *don't* like the idea of the 30+-hour camps for an item.  That isn't gaming-- it's poor design.  Making quests where items required are rare-drops on uncommon wandering mobs makes sense, as this still allows the developers to control output (assuming they didn't paint themselves in the corner) while getting rid of the camps.<P>Some people may feel otherwise, but I consider the camps a very 'unrealistic' abstraction.  Furthermore, I think there should be more rare mobs that appear unalone (like the wolf-hunters), specifically on some harder-to-get items.  This would make it harder to just clear a room and wait for mob X to appear.<P>I really feel for folks who lose rare spawns to wandering KSing NPCs.<P>-Aesop<BR>The Multi-Purpose Mage</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000062&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>The guy who Abashi responded to obviously has no clue what a casual gamer is if he needs therapy to help him NOT play.<P>He was also camping the spawn point for Regis the Reverant.  Well duh.  Thats a sure sign that this fella read some spoiler site about where the spawn is and decided to wait there to get it.<P>If he had actually done the quest he would know that you gotta kill Zahal the Vile (named ghoul) before Regis will spawn.  No wonder it took so long.<P>I do agree that the werewolf hunters killing the named spawn is lame though...<P>Do like Abashi said and play the game and take the items as they come along.

</FONT><HR>No, I don't think Everquest is designed for the casual gamer, especially at higher levels.  It can take an hour or more for a 25 and up level player to find a group, let alone kill enough stuff to see an improvement in experience.<P>I can't believe Abashi said you should play the game and see what items you get rather than play for existing items.  That's crap.  Take quests...you really think that a player can find a quest for a high-level item that isn't already being camped by someone else?  And look at monster loot..."Gee...in 5 hours of playing, I've acquired several rusty weapons, some money, and, um...some useless stuff that MIGHT be part of a quest but everyone else already has."  Yeah right.  AC is more for the casual gamer, it just takes a long time to adjust to the new style and interface after playing EQ.  I'm happy I stuck with it, and find it very enjoyable.  Heck, yesterday I saw a 3rd level Spear Master sporting a Flaming Spear with a visual effect that put the Firey Avenger and Soulfire to shame.<P>-Gilligan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000064&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I abashi thinks waiting for an 6-8 hour wait is ok for just the chance that the said mob isnt a placeholder, does happen to have the item (sometimes takes several kills before proper mob has the item), isnt camped already by several other people, other people dont show up later and demand you 'share spawns', isnt just outright ks by item farmers who show up 5 minutes before the pop time and camp out before a gm ever shows up 'Im sorry but there is nothing I can do'... he is totally clueless.  Bah even 72 min for a pop to get into old sebelis... everytime there is now several groups waiting in line and some are groups DEMANDING to cut ahead in line for cr and saying no to the servers uberguilds means very tough times at the higher lvl dungeons/planes reservation.  I have a full time job I dont want to put in another full 8 hour shift just to have some fun.

</FONT><HR>First, I'd like to say in response to the above post, that TWINKING DOES unbalance characters, and if you think it doesnt, just take a paladin for instance.  I have SEEN a 5th level paladin in FULL RO armor (and there are people that play TWO characters at the same time with TWO PC's going at once)just for this purpose of TWINKING with NO DROP items...he also had a Ghoulbane.  NOW then let me tell you, at 5th level, I could have NEVER killed reds solo...but thanks to twinking this was possible.  IF you think thats just eye candy...oh well.<P>Secondly, I have played SEVERAL other multople online user games...and MOST of them do NOT cater to casual gamers.  I mean common, why would they...casual gamers aren't nearly as profitable.  I have played on games that charged by the HOUR, and that doesnt change a thing...except totally emlimiate the casual gamer.  I have played on ONE game however that DID cater to the casual as well as the power gamer.  I would like to explain how this worked...and I'm SURE this was looked at durring EQ development but decided against becuase of reasons beyond me.  Magical Items were level based first of all...so it was IMPOSSIBLE to twink.  A first level just simple couldnt control the strength of the item...unlike simply just not processing like EQ items do.  Secondly, items could be customized with descriptions that made them unique.  So one magical sword looked slightly different than another magical sword.  This was what made the easier items obtainable and still unique...now you might say "but it's the same sword"...and yes your right, but to the casual gamer it was different and allowed for more roleplay opportunity, and game balance was NOT affected.  <P>Lastly this NO DROP thing is what screws up the whole process...this FORCES you to camp, instead of being able to purchase the item. <P>So in conclusion, the solution is this...and IF verant were serious about making this game playable for casual gamers this is how they could do it...I have SEEN this work with similar games...so dont try to say it WONT.  They have to make TWO or MORE versions of items available.  ALL with VERY similar stats (this wont unbalance game play)...One items is generic, easier to get, and can be bought (this is the casual gamer version), and the other item is NEATER looking, different color, maybe even different sounds, but NEARLY impossible to get...this is for the power gamer.<P>NOW THEN...If your serious about items NOT unbalancing the game, then this will change NOTHING.  AND you can easily see the power gamer comming when he has a full set of Purple armor items instead of the casual gamer who has almost the same thing but just a duller color.  NOW if your a casual gamer, this shouldnt matter becuase you now have that planes gear you needed to group and kill critters, and if your a power gamer, you can just scream all you want about HOW COOL your purple armor is.  <P>Once again I'd like to say I have SEEN this work on other games with FAR more hours played by users...still up and running servers BTW.  Technology is always improving and being a code developer I KNOW for a fact these things are not only possible, but could be coded and migrated with minor trouble.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000066&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>RPGs have never been made for casual gamers theyve always been made for people that have alot of extra time to put into them. Now that doesnt mean that someone with only a couple hours a nite to play will not be able to achieve the same goals as someone with alot, it just means that it will take alot longer (realtime) to achieve said goal. Imo they should have never targeted such a general market for eq. It should have been targeted at a more powergamer market because of the type of game it is. If your looking for a casual game that you can jump in and out of at a whim play something like a FPS or even a RTS. RPGs have and always will be very time consuming. Dont blame verant because your too busy to play their game and achieve goals that you have set for yourself in the game. None of that is their problem its yours and if you dont like that fact then simply cancel your account.<P>Ive been on both sides of the wall, casual gamer and power gamer. The way i see it is if you do not have fun playing the game theres no reason wasting your time complaining about it because no company in their right mind would totally overhaul the game because a handful of their customer base thinks the game doesnt do it for them. <P>Filling the message boards full of **** about how you dont like the game does people that actually like the game no good so STOP IT!<P>Alemander<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000067&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Ive said it many times before, and will support the people that have said it in this thread.  <P>I dont mind if something is difficult.  I dont mind if something is time-consuming.  If something takes 50 hours to obtain, so be it.  Just let me accomplish it in two-hour pieces.  I will put in my time.  I will go where I have to go.  I will travel all over Norrath.  I will venture in to every area necessary.  All I ask is that they recognize the fact that not everyone can put in long stretches of time.<P>Are there items that I wont ever have?  Certainly, and I accept that.  I will never be in a plane raid.  I will never be in the deepest part of the newest dungeons.  All I ask is that I have enough of a chance that if I put in my time, I will be rewarded in such a way that my character will be able to hold her own against NPCs of a like level and will be able to protect her group (if shes fortunate enough to find one in the limited playing time she has).<P>Difficult is fine.  Time-consuming is fine.

</FONT><HR>Well, here are my two coppers worth.  <P>I fall into the casual gamers category, and as recently as last week I was fretting over items that I didn't have.  I'm a level 36 druid with a respectable wisdom of 157.  I played with another druid who had an wisdom of 176.  I became jealous.  He had so many cool items that increased his wisdom.  I decided I'd go quest for the items myself.  I went after the Testament of Vanear and the Paw of Opalla.  Wow, was that a mistake.  There is no way for me to spend the time needed to camp for those items.<P>I was so mad I was spitting nails until a friend pointed out to me that it's not necessarily about having the best gear that makes you a good character.  It's the RL intelligence you use when you play.  <P>I'd rather play with an intelligent druid/cleric/whatever with a wisdom of 120 than to play with idiot (not the druid I was talking about earlier) with a wisdom of 200.  If you don't know how to play your character, those kewl dude items don't do you a lick of good.<P>I'd rather play with a smart warrior in all bronze than with a stupid one in full crafted armor.  Some warriors (tanks in general) don't know when to back out and let someone else take some punishment.  Or maybe we can talk about that ranger who is the main puller but goes OOM and has (wants) to med every fight because he deems it necessary to heal himself with his week healing spells if the healer of the group doesn't heal him to full health.  Or maybe he thought his offensive spells did some good when there was a wizard, druid, and others blasting away at the MOB.<P>Let's not even get into magic users doing mana dumps when the tanks need no help killing a MOB.<P>What I'm trying to say is that you don't always have to have the best gear to be an effective player.  Just play smart with what you have and you will be successfull (and build a good reputation for yourself).  I realize that now, and I'm a much happier EQ addict for it.<P>Ack, that was long.  Oh Well.<P>Aelon</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000069&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I think Verant and Gordo are money grubing Sons of *****es that want to make you have to play longer hours and more weeks to obtain anything in the game. Therefore by playing more you pay more. Just like unrecoveralbe corpses, hey sorry we can't help you out on that lost corpse, guess you'll have to play for another few months to recovery everything you lost, Gordo says "Woo hoo Brad we sucked another to play a few more months" Yes Verant cares nothing for their customers, they only care about the money rolling in. As far as I'm concerned the entire Staff at Verant can just take the damn game and shove it were the sun doesn't shine. Wake up people if you going to play you have to realize the game setup is to keep you hooked and playing as long as they can to make more money for them. JUST PLAN SIMPLE FACTS!!!!!<P>Brother John<BR>I know what you're up to Verant and I'll stop you some how.

</FONT><HR>I have to agree that good items take too long to get.  I have played EQ for over a year and tried switching servers to get less populated ones, but its still bad.  The trouble is that many people camp good items to sell them later so maybe Verant can make all the "high camped" items NO DROP and LORE so that only people who can use the item camp it and thus reducing the camping.  Also this is a bit unrealistic, but maybe they should radnomize the spawn places and what each monster drops so that sometimes one thing drops a certain item and sometimes another.  I realize this is probably not gonna happen, but consider my first suggestion making the high camp items NO DROP and LORE.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000071&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Being a relatively new user myself, I have 4 characters I play (depending on my mood) and none of them are above Lev 10.  The reason I do this is because I WANT TO GROUP.  Sometimes people want tanks, other times healers, and still others want casters.  All of my characters have the best equipment they can REALISTICALLY afford...all of which were purchased either at the guilds or through newbie quests.  Granted, it took me perhaps a month to acquire all this.  If there ever was a classification for a casual player, I feel I fit right in there.<P>Now, do I feel this game is built for the casual player?  NO.  Sorry, even with my 4 characters...I still have trouble finding groups. I have no time to commit to a guild so I will never be able to break into the heavily camped spawns.  I go all over the web and read about how a certain area is good for my level...only to be clobbered.  I have learned that some websites are just designed for twinks to level, nothing more.  Even at my level, the quests items are heavily camped.  Everything in Crushbone is camped (so much for me looking for those Leg shoulder pads) by higher levels who are only there for the xp.  I have asked nicely if I could acquire just ONE item.  I was ignored and while I searched for some other ways to acquire it...I was trained on by Crush and his Emissaries.<P>The moral: this is not a casual players game.  A person who spends 1-2 hours a night will quickly find themselves behind and unable to catch up to others.  Casual players are merely scenery...nothing more than the green mobs that walk around randomly or NPC's for quests...we are neither respected, or interacted with even less.  <P>We just happen to pay for it...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000072&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>OH MY GOD!!!! Did I read Verant's response correctly?!?! <P>So basically if you don't have the time to play due to real life, you aren't really meant to get quest items???? What kind of BS is that?<P>What exactly IS the point of EQ? To get levels, to get items and to meet people. So if a person doesn't not really have the time in a week to get items or levels...what is left? To meet people? I love to meet people, but I wouldn't stay on a game JUST to do that.  It is too discouraging.<P>I seriously believe that the casual gamer pays just as much to be ABLE TO PLAY as a more "serious" gamer. So why shouldn't they have the SAME possibilities to get items as anyone else?? Because "not everyone is meant to have every item"?<P>I didn't even have a beef with this whole issue until I read Verant's response...how insensitive to their clients. AND how typical. It is really too bad they treat people this way. <P>I DO understand that it takes away from the "status" of people who DO have really nice items or hard to get items...but to say that basically not everyone has the same POSSIBILITY to own an item is wrong!<P>I was a serious player until I started a new job, and now I could be considered a casual gamer...so Verant's response is very discouraging in my eyes and well flatly rather rude.  <P>As the original poster said "What's the point?"<P>Ceol</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000073&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I have the solution to this problem....read on.  (I will not address camping items...this is just about the casual user) I feel that EQ is a great game and is very fun to play at the lower levels because there is so much to attack..kill..cast spells at etc..it is non stop action.  Then something very twisted happens when you start reaching in your late 20's and 30's.  You start to just sit and wait...and wait ..and wait.  You sit and wait for EXP.  It is hard enough just to find a mob to attack.  Everything is camped.  So finally you get join a group (of six other people) who are camping the treants, or gnolls or avacks or many other mobs, and you sit and wait for that one mob to spawn...and all 6 people kill it in about 3 secs.  Then you wait another 10 mins........this cycle repeats itself until you are very tired of waiting.  So you start to watch TV or read a book between Spawns...this is not how the game was intended to be played (I read one post where this guy watched TV for 72 hrs...while playing the game...is this the way the game was made to be played...people are bord if they are watching TV when playing this game.  <BR> <BR>When EQ made the change last week with the guards it hit me very wrong.  I have never hunted guards so will only impact me later...but when they changed the guards to a 15min cycle ..instead of the 6 min cycle..this was when EQ showed its true intentions.  I agree with the other changes they made with the guards but when they changed the spawn time..this is what it told me....<BR> <BR>WE AT EVERQUEST DO NOT WANT PEOPLE GETTING EXP TOO FAST.  WE WANT YOU TO SIT AND WAIT FOR 15MINS BEFORE YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO KILL SOMETHING ELSE.  WE KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THAT YOU COULD KILL SOMETHING EVERY 4-6 MINS BUT WE INSTEAD TO MAKE YOU WAIT AN ADDITIONAL 10 MINS....BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT YOU TO GET EXP TOO FAST..WE WANT YOU TO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU HAD TO WAIT SOOO LONG TO GET YOUR EXP.  <BR> <BR>We as EQ players are more interested in killing mobs and getting exp, raising levels, casting spells, and having fun...we are not interested in sitting and waiting for 15mins between mobs (or watching TV).  I can not tell you the number of times I have heard whole groups of players and whole zones scream for EQ to turn up the spawn rate.  EQ this is only a game...please do not be selfish with the spawns..it seems you are afraid of letting the higher level players have fun (I understand making people wait for quest items).  If you are afraid of people raising too fast then make it that you need more exp to raise a level.  I would happily kill 100 mobs in a 8 hr period to raise a level then to only kill 24 mobs in the same 8 hr period and make my level.  Please Please Please go back to the drawing board and rethink the reason people are playing EQ..it is to get new items, kill mobs, cast spells, have fun.  If we wanted to sit and chat with other people we would join an AOL chat room...which is what EQ has become for the mid and higher level players.  EQ has the chance to go the distance and become one of the longest running games ever..but If this selfishness of mobs and exp does not stop (come on guys it does not cost you anything to make more mobs or increase the spawn rate) I will be looking for a new home.  <BR> <BR>If you do not want to make these changes...I wish to make a suggestion because what good is a question without a solution or a compromise.  Make one server.. a double or triple spawn rate server...and see how happy the EQ family becomes.  <P>You can even make another server a "casual server" where there are NOT the 5 day wait times for mobs.  This will allow any one who want the item can kill the mob and receive the item.  The casual player will not care about the "PRESTIGE" of the item they will be happy that they can get the item on 5-10hrs a week schedule.  Who cares that everyone else on the server has the "SWORD OF DEATH" ..you have yours and have gotten something that you would not have ever been able to have before.....and best of all...the person is happy....remember it is just a game...and it is only ONE server. <P>Thundor level 30 necro<BR>Asword level 25 warrior<BR>Atree level 30 druid<BR>Alps level 30 mage<BR>Akey level 12 monk<BR>etc..etc.. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000074&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><br>This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/000977-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/000977.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/000977-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/000977-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/000977-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/000977-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/000977-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000977&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000977&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
