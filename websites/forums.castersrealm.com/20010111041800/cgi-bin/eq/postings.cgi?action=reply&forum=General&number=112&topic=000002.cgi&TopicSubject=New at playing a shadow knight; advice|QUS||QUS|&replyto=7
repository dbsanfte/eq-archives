[B]I play an Erudite Sk, he's level 18 at the moment.  Just after I made 2nd lvl I had a friend port me to commons and I made my new home in Neriak.  Most, NPC's were dubious to me there.  Spend a little money and do the Red wine quest and it will raise your faction within the City itself.  Your faction with the guards is a little different.  To get a resonable difference in your faction with them head to the Halflings in the zone and start slashing and Harm Touching away.  Once I hit level 7 I ventured out of nektulos and started killing the orcs in the orc camps.  I spent pretty much all my time there until they were mostly green.  Make sure to loot the belts when you get the chance.  Take these belts to the Captain of the Militia in FreePort.  You will get decent xp and Faction with the militia.  I was only Apprehensive with the guards without doing anything for faction with them.  I'm now Amiable.  I waited a long time to try N Freeport.  When I finally went there the Pallys are WARMLY to me. I was very surprised.  The Clerics are Dubious though.  Also, if you have the extra money or want to become a Brewer, I used 1 back pack of tumpy tonics for faction with the vendors.  Hope this helps.

There are two merchant huts just on the green side of the West Freeport Zone line.  If you enter the one that FACES freeport you'll find Pardor and all will be good. Stay away from the one that faces North towards Neriak. Rinna Lightspinner (or something close to that) is a merchant that HATES Shadow Knights and will attack you on sight.  She hits for about 350 points or so. (Or did last time I crossed her path) <P>In the Western Common Lands, there is a hut very near the Befallen entrance where you can sell as well. The Merchant is an erudite lady who sells gems.<P>Honestly though, I believe you do not start out KoS at all in East and West Freeport.  You should be dubious there and only KOS in North (because of the Paladins).  My advice to you is to kill a bunch of orcs in the commonlands to up your standing with the Paladins if you want to bank in freeport.  You can also do a bunch of quests in the rogue guild to up your faction with the Freeport Militia. It takes a long time, and will require some patience and planning as most quests that up your paladin faction will give you a negative hit on Freeport Militia.  However, the Rogue guild quests are easy to complete and will give you positive Militia faction without hurting your Paladin standing.
