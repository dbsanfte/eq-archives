</FONT><HR>Well as a lvl 55 cleric I can see no way a guild of our lvl can do any of the harder dungeons/planes.  Just last night we went snooping around Selblis and Mr. Trak got a little upset at us. If there was not a Rogue who got lucky and lived.  A few would have been panicing since they we not wise in getting a second key for a summon. as it was my Forbidden rites is one charge less now but 6 people have there full gear still.<P>So Exp res is a must in this game. And in reply to the fellows comments if he has not made friends with a cleric by the time he is lvl 30  then he must be a kiting druid who should get some in game interaction.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001096.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Resurrection+should+be+changed.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>   I'm a lvl 51 cleric and the post had some falsehoods in it. The first one is that all clerics I know will rez if in same zone for free if corpse brought to them when mana permits. As it stands now only clerics can rez till pallys start makin it the the exp rez lvl and when i go to do rezes and go non roleplaying I cannot keep up with the rez requests much less do them all but I payed a high price to get that abaility.  The reason that there are so few high lvl clerics is because they are very difficult to get from 20 to 34 because shammies and druids offer the grp more than clerics do. The poster was correct that if I say i cant do a rez request no amount of money will change my mind because I dont charge for most rezes (only when I have to travel and place myself in great danger for non-guild member) it means I cant travel at that time becaused I grped. <P>     One idea that I have thought up that would be interesting but will never happen is the making of rez potions. Give a lvl 54 cleric a spell that would create a reagent for 1500mana then a shammie as a few more componets and bingo rez potion make the other componets cost about 250 pp. Just a goofy  idea please dont flame me.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001096.cgi&ReplyNum=000002&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Resurrection+should+be+changed.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Hmm, I don't really understand why someone would want to remove Ressurection from the game, just makes no sense to me.  I do agree with what was said about it not being cool to make friends with someone just cause they can cast a spell you like, but personally I just make friends with most everyone.  There is very little I hate more then down time when playing, I like to be doing something most all the time, whether it is killing stuff or questing or helping someone or whatever.  So I don't spend a great deal of time begging and pleading for a Rez when I die.  Just today my group in the Bedroom of Lower Guk got trained by a bunch of nasty crap, and as the Enchantress for the group my first instinct was just to start mezzing, by the time I noticed there were like 10 monsters (most of which were deep red to me) I was already dead.  Losing a half a bubble of xp at a hell level really sucks, but I spent about 5 min asking the zone and my guild if anyone was available for an xp rez, noone was, so I just grabbed my body, looted it, and went from there.  I am a good enough player that overall I gain far more xp then I lose, so why worry about spending some extra time getting more xp, and while I am re-earning this xp I will be gaining money and maybe even items, so it isn't for nothing.  Your idea about having a NPC that can rez for like 250p or whatever and saying that way you will just spend the time gaining money back while you get more xp doesn't amke sense.  The way it is now while you spend time getting xp back you make more cash, same thing just reversed.  Friend of mine plays this mud game, he died the other day and lost about 1.5 million experience points, the way that game works he couldn't even ask for a rez, just had to eat the loss, to translate that xp into EQ xp I would say would be about all the xp needed to go from level 45 to 46, imagine losing that all at once, no thx.<P>As for it making clerics too powerful, well that is wrong, you ever tried to play a cleric?  I have a lot of respect for people who play good clerics cause for me the class is pretty boring.  Med, med, med, heal tank, med, med, med heal tank, med, med, med quickly heal wizard who blasted too much, med, med, heal someone, etc.  Not what I call an exciting battle.  What makes a lot of people play Clerics is the fact that they are so important to others, my personal experience tells me that most people who play clerics generally like to help people, but of course they can't always be there to raise anyone and everyone who needs it, they have a group they need to keep healed too.  Know what happens most of the time when a cleric goes off to rez some poor schmuck? His group usually gets killed and he has a bunch more down time.  <P>The secret to getting rezzes is being nice, shouting out to the zone demanding some cleric stop what he is doing and rez you is not the answer, best bet is to do a /who all cleric 34 60 and see if there are any clerics in your area, is so send them an individual tell asking nicely for a rez, offer to pay them or whatever you can.  If they say they are busy and can't, simply say thx for your time, maybe another time.  Next time you need a rez that cleric is gonna remeber you not magging them and such and will be more likely to help you if they can.  I am not sure, but I bet that clerics talk to each other about people asking for rezzes, and if you are known to be a jerk about bugging them and such, then the word will get around.<P>Secret to EQ, be nice to everyone, most people will be nice to you too!!<P>Dazzle Linarius Human Enchantress level 30 Morrel server (yes really a human Enchantress)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001096.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Resurrection+should+be+changed.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR> Remove exp res's? Hardly.  Give them to other classes? I dont think the paladin should get them, much less anyone OTHER than clerics.  <BR>  The ONLY reasonable argument in the post was that it should not be required to make friends with a cleric.  It isn't.  I'm a 48th lvl enchanter.  I have two cleric friends, both with wildly different play schedules.  As a result I rarely get an exp res from a friend.  Many clerics do outright refuse to res others.  This is their right.  Others require obscene amounts of cash.  Again there right. However, there are as many, if not more that simply ask that you bring your body to them.  Not unreasonable as they have responsibilities to their groups.<BR>  Nothing that I can see needs to be done to the exp res.  However, the loss of exp when killed DOES need to be revised.  It is NOT reasonable to lose 1.5 bubbles of experience to a death, even in a double xp loss lvl.  Hell, the dbl xp loss lvls dont make sense.  At the most, a death should cost you twice the xp winning the fight would have given you.  The xp penalty idea is valid, the amount of the xp penalty however is not.<BR>  Xqo is right, be nice and you're more likely to get a res.  As for the time issue, yes getting an exp res outside of prime time is difficult.  If you cant find one, and cant do without one, maybe you should create a cleric so that they'll always be available?<P>Sirienth, High Elven Enchanter of the 48th Season.<p>[This message has been edited by Sirienth (edited 06-04-2000).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001096.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Resurrection+should+be+changed.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I just want to be able to get ressed for the numerous bug, crash, and EQ lockups I get ALL the time--no other software is as bad, I play lots of games but EQ?  Not only is my time an investment, but its a bad one, for once the software I pay to use crashes, my time is gone and there is absolutely nothing a GM will do about it.<P>So I'm either stupid for playing buggy software willingly, or a liar.<P>I am a necromancer and I can tell you now I'll never even MEMORIZE those useless  ressurect spells they gave us.   A guaranteed exp loss of 100% vs a partial res of 93%?   Screw you verant, your ideas are pathetic--you could give resses out willy-nilly and the players would STILL be behind because there is NO 100% res excepting that of a GM (recently "fixed", according to you, but hey you've never screwed up right?) so what makes you think giving other players the ability to ressurect would "dilute" anything?     I know most of the clerics on Povar, and there are some that will res and some that won't--period.     Not a guild thing, just a "piss off I've been asked 10000 times over the past 3 months and I'm fed up".    You think clerics won't reasonably be expected and in-demand?<P>Give other players a lower res (80%? 90%?) and don't give any other caster the HP buffing and healing abilities, and you know what?  The clerics will be in demand still.<P>Ayama</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001096.cgi&ReplyNum=000005&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Resurrection+should+be+changed.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

There are times, however, when you cannot just pick up and leave your group to help some stranger out.  Rez's are a must and definitely belong in the game. Personally I'm happy to see Paladins getting a high level rez to help out the workload, but either the original poster sucks at making friends, or has had really bad luck.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Astur il'Ayan<BR>Priest of Brell<BR>Vicar of Scarab</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001096.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Resurrection+should+be+changed.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Well I thought I would add my comment to the thread. As Gordon so well put it, a res aint a entitlement but a benefit. <BR>So you can walk without sow (taking more time to travel) but you cant make it without a res (cause it takes time to get the exp back). Thats a good one. <P>Sure at higher levels the time to get the exp backs takes damn long time, BUT guess what, you have spent 50 levels to get there, if you in that time have not grouped and/or meet a cleric that you like and like to keep conctact with, then what can I say? <BR>I play a cleric among other things (40 now), I have rangers, warriors, enchanters etc. on my friend list (on and off line list). If I see them in game I send a hello etc. if I am free I will run over and res them if they need it and they will help me if I need help.<BR>Everquest is based on that you make friends, and while we are on the subject, if you play a highlevel char, ask for a res, and I offer what I can do (39 atm) and you say no thanks, I want at least a 49. Then never expect me to res you again. <BR>There is something about that res that make everyone think that cause it is in the game, everyone is entiteld to it. First of all there are some priorities to think of.<P>1. The group I am with (if it is a bad group I will leave it so, it is usually a good group)<BR>2. The guild<BR>3. Friends<BR>4. People that have helped you now/before but are not as close as friends.<BR>5. The rest of the population<P>Now, if you want me to leave my group, run over 5 zones to do a res on you then leave again? Not only do you ask me to betray my group you are also asking me to leave a good group to help you? When you tele out of the planes to help me with a CR in Lguk I will also run 5 zones to help you, but before that, I dont think so.<P>I dont mind helping people, I have spent countless hours buffing newbies, helping with minor quests, brake spawns etc and I like doing that. What I dont like is d00ds sending me telling me that they ned a res 5 zones away NOW!!!!<BR>When I explain that I have no intrest in running 5 zones to do a res cause I am camping that ultra rare spawn for 7h straight now I get another tell with something like.<P>GET OVER HERE NOW!! I HAVE DIED!!!!!!!<P>When you once again replay that you will not come since you are still camping the spawn and get tell like<P>You suck! All cleric are greedy bastards, I will tell my guild never to group with you.<P>You really feel nice. Imho so is clerics among the most humble and service minded people in the game. We usually dont ask for compensation casting a 500m spell (compare to druids(example), 5pp/sow at platform).<BR>We usually heal anyone in need of it when we travel, we help with CR (spent many hours doing this cause no necro/bard though they could take the time to do it so I ran around looking for it). <BR>We buff anyone (almost at least) that ask for it nicly. Send me a tell with Buff me, or Buff plz and I will ignore you. Send me a tell with I am on a quest to slay the dreaded dervs could you bless me please? And you usually end up with everything I can cast on you including symbol.<P>And to end this long comment, if you think that there is to few clerics, then start one yourself then and res anyone all the time and see how it is before you make rude remarks on our class.<P>Dangrim, 40 cleric, Tunare server<BR>Order of Mjolnir</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001096.cgi&ReplyNum=000008&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Resurrection+should+be+changed.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>If i here you (gordon) call something a blessing rather than an entitlement one more time, i'm going to shoot myself. Rezs are borderline, but they would definently be a bonus if EXP penalties weren't INSANE on higher levels. If they weren't bonkers it would be a bonus, but they are, so they are basically a necesity. If you don't think loosing hours of gameplay kills the fun of a game fast, then you have absolutely zero experiance in games like EQ.<P>And don't call post-50 spells anything other than entitlements...because they are. I play a class that gets spells, i expect to get them....all. Thats how 99.9% of people treat magic classes, and thats how it should be. SHould we have to work for them? yes...should i have to camp in a DIFFICULT zone for 6 hours a night to maybe get a scroll? no...thats more insane than the exp penalties i get for dying while trying to get those spells. Not letting spells be attainible, on a regular basis, to everyone of that class screws with the community through jealously (thats basic human nature, don't argue it) screws up balance (argue that and you get a tack hammer to the dome) and screws up everything...period.<P>Thank you and good night<P>(please excuse all grammar errors and stuff, it's late and i'm tired.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001096.cgi&ReplyNum=000009&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Resurrection+should+be+changed.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Well you guys pretty much said it all but let me add my two cents.<BR>The poster was obviously insane and I am suprised anyone even akcnowledged his post.<BR>Now I can see why he would want more classes to have the spell but he SAID that was a dumb idea.  The point of his post was to get it removed, and while that would certainly end him having to request an EXP Rez, it's like burning down the fire department.  I personally started a cleric just because of the problem that there aren't enough around, but now I'm rethinking my choice.<BR>Oh well just my two cents.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001096.cgi&ReplyNum=000011&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Resurrection+should+be+changed.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Wow...  I think the only thing I could POSSIBLY say to the original poster of that on the EQ boards is that I'm seriously insulted.  I have almost never turned down a request for a rez, and that simply because I was overworked in a big-name group (frenzied ghoul, in particular), and without a clarity to be found.  The only other request for a rez I had that I had to turn down was for one whilst in LGuk, a person in North Karanas asked me to come rez him, although he was rather reasonable when I said that my duty was to my group and that I couldn't leave them.<P>The original poster must have some SERIOUS issues...  I personally wouldn't be surprised if they've just had a bad reputation precede them to whatever zone they're hunting in, and are thus being shunned/ignored.<P>Lohre Soulsaver<BR>Dwarven cleric of the 45th teaching under Brell<BR>Bristlebane<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001096.cgi&ReplyNum=000012&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Resurrection+should+be+changed.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Resurection shouldnt be removed it is a good idead but rather the penalty for death shuold be nigated some - i have quit all 3 of my lv 50's because dieing due to LD or any valid reason means teh loss of 2 full days of exp and that just to F***ing highj a cost 2 whole damn days for one death and if oyu have a bad night a week can be lost seroiusly it piss's me off that they think i can even get a res 50% of the time alot of the groups i end up in never have a cleric and i could care less but being totally penilized for specificly not grouping with a cleric is bull - they based penalty's on the fact that you can get a res and very few people can get them and even if they could it takes alot longer then the 2 hours limit to get a cleric to your corpse most of the time. <P>**** just last night i was killed right in front of a lv 52 cleric who did nothign to help me besides heal the friend he was power lving . i died asked if he could res e since he was just right next to my corpse he told me he was too busy - bah <BR>I get back to my corpse he still sitting there his friend is gone - so i ask again - he says i cant be giving ress's out to people i dont know because then other would think i will do it too so leave me alone -<P>now its 3 am my time none of my friends are on, none the less a cleric to res me.<P>Abashi say make friends with cleric just so you can use their abilities to res - even friends dont leave groups just to res you - they often time have waited hours just to get into that group and aren't willing to leave!!  <P>i say Abashi can suck mine as soon as a new game is releases im canceling my eq - or even sooner maybe just go back to UO like a alot of my friends have done as well because we are all sick of verant total lack of respect to players..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001096.cgi&ReplyNum=000013&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Resurrection+should+be+changed.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I can't belive what some of you all are saing, the EQ people can do what ever they want, it is their game, yes we are paing costermers, but they can do what ever they want, it does not matter to me, the Res spell is fine where it is, but if you are going to give it to another class, give it the Magicans, yes were good already, but everyone knows from the Fox shows "Magican's secrets revealed" that Magican's can bring people back to life.  A Magican IRL is someone who wants to be a real spell caster, but is not good at it yet, they know what they are doing , but can't seem to master spells like Wizards, so they use things to try and confuse you.  RES is a great spell. I have died before by falling of the screen and it is that one person after gate that REses me and I am so happy I could give them everything I had and they say no.  So just leave it be. it is finer where it is<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001096.cgi&ReplyNum=000017&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Resurrection+should+be+changed.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Ummm.. people, could you try to stay totally on topic, and not talk about how dumb the original poster is? If you have nothing constructive to the post to add, then don't add it. Okay, now that that's out of the way... I currently have very few problems with the res system. But, I have a major problem with the Iksar. Verant wants us to roleplay, right? If that's so, why is it that the only res an Iksar can get is from a necro? With this being the case, I doubt that many Iksar will roleplay, because they need to get a good res, and I doubt any necros are going to be carrying any spare Essence Emeralds. Anyway, that's just my 2cp.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001096.cgi&ReplyNum=000018&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Resurrection+should+be+changed.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Ok, First off, this guy sounds like he really ticked off a cleric at one point or another.  2nd, There is NO WAY verant will get rid of the Rezz line of spells for the simple reason, if they did, then they would have to get rid of the cleric's all together.  Cleric's are one of the most abused classes in the game. Sure we are alway's wanted for a group, for what? HEALING and REZZ and BUFF's that's it, The majority of the groups powerloot, and dont even offer the MEDDING Cleric any of the good stuff, just the chump change, for the simple reason they have to continually med, to keep mana up for the upcomming fight.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001096.cgi&ReplyNum=000021&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Resurrection+should+be+changed.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I thought that was a really well written letter, and I think his point is just this: cleric rezzes are not *grossly* overweighting the game, but they are overweighted to a certain degree.  I think he is suggesting that just SOMETHING be done to eliminate the fact that while you can forego enchanter jewelry, overcome the absence of shammy buffs, run without sow, no other thing is as debilitating as not getting a rez at higher levels, where exp takes some a week to get back.<P>I thought the best solution idea, tho, was to give rez capacity to a NPC in some far-off land, for a sizable price -- like around 1k.

</FONT><HR>First, I know this is a cleric topic and I play a wizard, but there are similarities between the requests clerics get for rezzes and the requests I get for portals.<P>Second, I do not charge for portals nor for the binds at the portal destination (if I can bind the party there); I do accept donations, though.  &lt;smile&gt;<P>Third, this particular gamer seems to play the game as if money can buy anything.  I have seen this before.  The dialog goes something like this:<P>G:  I need a portal to ????<BR>Me: I'm sorry, but I am in a hunting group right now.<BR>G:  I will pay you 10pp<BR>Me: I'm sorry, but I cannot leave my group to portal you right now.<BR>G:  I will pay you 20pp to portal me.<BR>Me: Please read the last response from me.<BR>G:  I HAVE to get to ??? right now.  I will pay you 50pp.<BR>Me: I'm sorry, but I just cannot help you at the moment.<BR>G:  &lt;expletives deleted&gt; &lt;references to my parental ancestry deleted&gt; &lt;other insults deleted&gt;<P>Now let me say the above dialog is NOT the ordinary case.  Most gamers stop asking for a portal when they find you are grouped.  Their response is usually an "OK" or some other positive response.<P>However, there are always the few who think that offering more plats will get them a lift, or who are so selfish that they see the game solely from their own perspective.<P>The original poster, who complained about the cleric rezzes, seems to fit into the latter group.  I feel sorry for him or her ... EQ must be a nightmare for him or her to play.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001096.cgi&ReplyNum=000024&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Resurrection+should+be+changed.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><br>This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/001096-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/001096-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/001096-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/001096-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/001096-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=001096&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=001096&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
