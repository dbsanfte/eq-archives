Something which has been bothering me for a while is the way people treat Druids, both in and outside of grouping.  I have heard many complaints about being charged for teleports, sows, buffs, ect, by people who have clearly only played melee types or pure casters (barring enchanters, of course..they get bothered all the time too.)  What people don't realise is that others choose to play Druids for their abilities..not to act as a machine that walks around spending all their mana making people run faster and teleporting them, when they could be getting exp and going up in levels instead.  Don't get me wrong..I have a level 35 Druid on Quellious, and there are times when I devote nearly a full day to strictly buffing, sowing and healing people for free.  I am not a selfish person, but when I'm out soloing or grouping, I would like a little privacy, and to be able to hunt without some stranger running up to me in mid-battle and saying "SOW PLZ!"  Don't they realize how absolutely RUDE that is?  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/rolleyes.gif">  For some strange reason, people think that we are here only to buff them, and heaven forbid they give something in return for interrupting us so that we can spend our time and mana on them.  I know what you're thinking.."why doesn't she use /annonymous or /roleplay?  Well, because it doesn't help.  Even if people can't see what class and level you are by doing a /who on you, the minute they see you, they know what you are.  How many level 35 classes can't wear more than leather type armor?  Not many.  Even if they don't recognise you by sight, as soon as they see you cast a buff, sow or heal on yourself or your group members, the cat's out of the bag..welcome to a round of harassment.  Let's try to put you in a druid's shoes, if you still don't understand.  Say you're out hunting with your group, and you've all just escaped from a pretty bad scrap..everyone is low on hp and you're trying to get mana to buff and heal your party members.  Out of the blue, someone runs up to you and DEMANDS that you sow them...they don't ask. ;-)  They don't offer a donation, either.  So you spend mana your group needs on this stranger so that they can run faster, cause they can't stand running at the normal speed.  This means it will take longer for you to buff, heal and sow yourself and party members.  The stranger runs off without a word.  Sound like fun?  Yes, at higher leves, sow doesn't put much of a dent in your mana, unless you have a wisdom of 20 or something.  At low to mid levels, however it puts a big enough dent to be a nuisance.  That's not all though...everyone seems to think they are the ONLY people in the zone who have approached you for a sow.  Nuh-uh...add about 20 or 30 to that.  When I want to work on trade skills, I literally have to be invisible to do it uninterrupted.  People will bother you when you are banking, selling, buying, fighting for your life, working on trade skills, or even standing there naked, obviously in need of buffs yourself.  The worst part is, they don't see this as an inconvenience.  They will send you tells asking that you drop what you're doing to teleport them to this place or that, and if you say anything about donations, they have a fit.  Do you know how much mana group teleports take?  Do you realise that you've interrupted someone's hunting because you don't want to run from east commons to southern ro?!  Do you stop to think that maybe that person is trying to level their character, just like you are, and does not have an unlimited mana pool, regardless of how high their wisdom is?  If you answered "no" to any of these questions, I'd advise you to play a druid, shaman, or even an enchanter so that you will know what it is like to be stopped every five steps because someone wants to run faster or wants a cool breeze.  I'm sure Wizards have a bit if trouble with other players constantly telling them to teleport them too, but druids get ALL the harrassments.  Okay, enough about having to sneak around to get anything accomplished...let's talk about grouping and why most druids prefer to solo.  First off, as someone else said in another post, druids are highly underrated at higher levels because everyone wants Verant's baby, the Shaman, instead of the group.  We druids are slapped around like a red-headed stepchild in comparison to the other classes in this game...Verant nerfs us more each patch, while stregnthening our brethren, the Shaman, to a point where we can't get groups.  We have but ONE defence, and that defence is also a pain in the ass...we can teleport, and Shammy's can't.  Don't get me wrong..I love shamans and have one who is level 10.  I simply think Verant is giving them too many special powers and class armor while leaving the wolf children starving.  Even when you do get in a group, as a druid, you can do a bit of everything, so you are spending a LOT of mana.  Between buffing, blasting, and healing, Druids use the most mana of any class in the game, and I wish the designated pullers would take pity on them and not pull to a point where the druid never has mana to help with the fight.  There are few things more frustrating than spending all of your mana buffing and sowing the entire party, then the main puller going "Okay..I'm buffed..time to bring a whole camp of orcs, Aviaks, ogres, or whatever down on our heads."  Then the screams and pleads for a heal begin, and you have no mana to either evac your group or heal them, and everyone gets mad at you.  I personally will always ask that the melee types wait untill not only myself, but all casters in the group have at least 30% mana.  Yes, I know it slows down the pulls, but it also prevents death.  How fast can you get experience if you keep dying and have to make a corpse run?  Not very, I'm afraid.  As a druid, I always leave a bubble of mana for healing available, whether those heals go to me or my group members...simply because the "tanks" are too tank-happy and often think we have unlimited mana.  Shamans and enchanters have the same problem.  From an enchanter's point of veiw, here's what happens.  The casters all want breeze or Clarity, the fighters all want Alacrity.  You precast this on everyone and announce that you have 10% mana, only to find that that crazy, impatient warrior has already pulled a mob of 7 creatures.  Guess what?  You can't mesmerize! <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/eek.gif">  Even with breeze/clarity, it takes a certain amount of time for casters to regain mana, just like it takes time for you tanks to heal unless someone in the party is a healer type.  I finally became enraged with a group I was playing when they kept pulling even when I begged them to let me regain mana, and ended up saying "Okay..no more alacrity for the fighters..I can't do crowd controll and speed them up too if you are going to keep pulling like this."  Needless to say, they calmed down a bit on the pulls after I stated that.  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/tongue.gif">  Well, I think I've gotten most of this off of my chest.  I hope people will learn a little empathy and understanding.  By the way..my druid never sows people who say "SOW PLZ".  That sounds like an order a rich person gives to an underling.  If you want me to sow you, wait politely on the side while I finish off my prey, and say something like "If it's not a bother, may I get a sow from you when mana permits?"  I don't expect to hear a reason...I only want a little respect and common courtesy.  Donating is also a good thing, as I will remember you for it and often afterwards give you free buffs, simply because you thought of me.  Have a good one!

I am one of those people that is nice to a fault. I go out some days buffing and sow'ing people for the hell of it, or even just doing a free port once in a while for someone that is totally lost. This is of course with my now retired druid. I still bring her online sometimes so that I can make some money porting.<P>Anyway...I was spending a lot of time in ButcherBlock because that's where my new druid was. So, if I needed to transfer anything from Quunara to Faustina, I'd occassionally buff and sow the little dwarves  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"> Well, there was this one in particular that would just automatically assume i was there to buff him and only him. He'd get buffed, think he was invincible, then come back say I died..buff me....then go off and do it again...I think I must have buffed him 4 times in an hour. Finally I told him that I was leaving. So, I bring out Faustina so I can start leveling her...That stupid little dwarf obviously can't see that the name is different and can't tell that Faustina is a woodelf, not a human. All he saw from the Magic Masters tag and that I was a druid...so he starts bothering Faustina to buff him. WTF!!! Eventhough I kept telling him that I didn't have those buffs and that I couldn't sow...he kept begging me to bring back Quunara! How rude!<P>I also brought out Quunara one day so that I could help my brother power level his new Chanter in NRO. Well, big mistake...I am there buffing and sowing and healing my brother's chanter...all the while, people keep coming up to me asking for buffs and sow. I did one round for everyone and most of them were satisfied. But, this one guy in particular came up to me everytime his sow ran out and asked me for another.....and then he'd ask me to heal him...then he'd ask me to put regen on him....I finally said, LOOK, I CAN'T POWERLEVEL EVERYONE IN THIS PLACE. To which his reply was...I am not looking for a power level, just sow and a heal.<P>Well, does that make it ok? NO, cause I had promised my brother I would help him...not everyone else in the zone. My mana was reserved for him and him only. And I feel that if I tell people nicely that they should respect me for that...not keep bothering me after I already buffed them all once and said that that was the only time I'd be able to do it.<P>I've also had people tell me outright that I am lieing when they ask for a port and I tell them I can't cause I am in a group already. That's just pure bull. They'll walk right up to me and I'll be in the group healing or whatever I happen to be doing and they'll still say I am lieing...DOH!! <P>I can't ***** anymore, heehe!!<P>------------------<BR>Faustina of the Magic Master (new and improved woodelf druid :)<P>Quunara Delaluna of the Magic Masters (retired at the 34th lvl)<P><BR>Morelle-Thule Server

well...as for grouping and having to buff/sow people...druids are in perma-hell<BR>the need for druids in a group is nil in my level...i've sat in karnor's for hours without ever getting groups...even when i get put on lists i get passed by every other class that showed up later than me excepting wizzies...i feel for them too =\<BR>finding groups only gets harder and harder...almost to the point where trying to group is a _total_ waste of time.<BR>im expected to heal tanks getting hit for double 100s each round with...greater healing ????<BR>ok yeah...i can heal as well as a lvl24 cleric...yay me.<BR>getting a cleric that was 20 lvls under me would be more effective in their group...needless to say i get passed up, at least shamans can buff/debuff...they have a use besides healing, all i'm there for is maybe a group chloro...sln every now and then...nothing that a cleric or shaman couldn't do easily...the talk about being forced to solo...isn't all fake.<BR>i am forced to solo unless there's 5 guildies there and they haven't found a 6th yet...and contrary to popular belief...camping a spawn for fast exp...is boring as ____<BR>sitting there by myself medding for 10 mins to stand up and fry a couple guys in under a minute is not fun at all...it's boring...my hope is that someone realizes this and fixes this solo-only class...our ability to solo is not an ability...it's a disability, i can't do anything else...and don't even start with big raids...i'm totally useless on those...

I really cannot believe you whiners.<P>The Druid ensnare line is the most effective pvp spell in the game.  So much so that it really should be strongly nerfed in pvp.  It lasts long enough for the druid to med full while his captive is helpless.  It is seldom resisted for even con even at 65 MR and it doesn't appear to break on subsequent nukes.  On top of that it strips SoW as a by-product.  It is both the safety valve for a lost battle and the Hammer for a kill.<P>You have little to complain about while you have this near-exploit available for pvp.

What are you on about, snare isn't any kind of problem - less problematic than the necro darkness which slows an equal amount with a nasty DoT thrown in.  Use either cancel magic or a pumice stone and problem solved.<P>If you think ensnare is some kind of uber PVP spell, you'll get murdered when you fight and enchanter or a necromancer.<P>Shanya, lvl 49, Innoruuk Server

I agree totally with the original poster.  I'm playing a druid that's 23rd now.  It seems like to everyone in the game, Druid = SoW, and Druid With A Lastname = Port  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">  I've been getting asked for SoW since 5th level (sorry, don't even get it until 14th people) and since 20th or so I'm asked continually for ports (which I don't get until 29th).  For a while I went /roleplay and it cut down on the requests, but I started feeling guilty about it, so I went back to normal.  What really gets my goat is people who behave as if they are OWED your gifts.  As far as I'm concerned, anyone can come up to me and say "may I please have SoW?" and if I have the mana to spare, I will give it, same goes for heals or buffs.  But when I'm in a group and struggling to support them, I have to say no.  Take it gracefully people and say thanks anyway.  The people who give you a hard time when you say no, even if you give a valid raeason, they are the really amazing ones.  Unless your response is you are OOM, they don't care.<BR>

sadly...i too know of these terrible experiences.  before i started playing my druid (who is now my main) i didn't believe that someone could get as many tells about sow and ports as people claimed.  every time i log on i get tons of people asking for sow and or ports.  it depends on my mood how i respond...i'm really nice at heart...so i almost always give sow, but they need to wait for when i'm ready to give it.  the only time i can ever remember not giving someone a sow was when they walked up to me and said "sow".  not even the crappy "plz" that passes as an excuse for politeness!!!  i was power leveling a friend, so i told her to get up and i walked away from the guy not saying anything...took a bit of self control not to say "oh yeah, i have that spell don't i?" and then cast it on myself.  however bad it is with sow, it only gets worse with ports.  anyone who's ever been in a group with more than one druid knows that, yes druids can do a little of everything, but when there's more than one...they can do a lot more of everything.  i was in a group outside the ry'gorr fort in east wastes, don't remember the exact makeup of the group, but there were 2 druids.  someone walked up to the other druid and demanded a tp out of velious.  when she calmly explained that she was the primary healer in the group and could not leave them, he flipped out saying that i could do the healing.  she didn't even go into the fact that i wasn't healing, i was the nuker/snarer, but said that she couldn't spare the mana.  he almost freaked out saying that it was only 300 mana for a group teleport.  she then explained how much mana it really costs (300 mana to group tp, 70 mana to gate back if bound there...plus about 3-4 minutes of meditating that is lost which is a bunch more mana gone).  he would't accept that she couldn't teleport him to west commons.  sadly i've only now hit 34...i would have teleported him to DL or something.  anyway, i just wish there was some way that everyone could understand what a pain it is to constantly sow and tp all of norrath everywhere.  i've said it before and i'll say it again... druids are NOT required to keep all of norrath sowed!!!  anyway, that's about all i have for now...good luck to all.  may Tunare light your path.<P>Chimaera Wolvynspire<BR>The Preserver of Chaos<BR>Void of Chaos<BR>Karana Server

That first post is an absolute killer (I'll print that off and hang it on me wall I think ^_^)<P>That IS the first mega-long post I've ever read where I've wished it to go on for longer! Everything in that post is 100% true, and I've been in a lot of similar situations myself.<P>one thing we should remember though folks... though we may complain about having people ask for these spells- people want them because they are good (somthing to be proud of)... if we keep moaning about people asking for them, the almighty VI monster might decide to take these abilities (which are both a blessing and a curse to us) away from us, and we'd moan a lot more then (or would we? hehehe I wonder if they made all our spells self-only... might be interesting)<P>I for one am happy with what we have... the skin like X seris is a nice hp buff line and sow is... erm well it's sow- nuff said...<P>if asked for buffs I only ever cast skin like (whatever) and sow on the target... all the resists and endures and str aren't worth it unless on a raid or the target specifically asks for them.<P>In a way, we have it better than Shamens- because they spend all their mana on buffs before combat (str/dex/lots of other stats buffs- for each member) and we "might" spend mana on our 1 or 2 buffs depending on who else is in a group... for instance, get a group with a cleric in and casting the skin like X seris of spells is a complete waste of time because the cleric buffs overwrite them<P>- result, we save mana ^_^, get nuking little druids!<P>As for people demanding SOW and buffs off me- I've only had it happen a few times (I'm either one of the lucky ones- or I just don't notice)- one time in particular springs to mind- (are we sitting comfortably? =)<BR>There was this little necro in my guild and I'd help powerlevel him a bit... (got him a level or two)- anyway a few days later, he's on the guildline whinnnneing for a port to NK (little twat), now considering there are quite a lot of druids in our guild- everyone was grouped and settled (how annoying is it when some moron demands a port after you've just got into a decent group and started making some good xp?)- anyway- this went on for a whole um 15 mins... whine whine whine whine, nag nag nag nag... he even started spamming the guildline at one point (deliberatly)- till I said- yeah ok I'll do it... met the little sod in BB and (baring in mind he wanted to goto NK) ported him to Toxx, disbanded and gated back to my group while he was still zoning (BOY THAT FELT GOOD)... his reaction on the guild line.... "your mean"... he then shut up completely, and left the guild (a good overall result ^_^)- he also said he'd petitioned about me- so I also petitioned and explained the situation to a guide- his own words (I jest ye not):<P>"official stance- BAD BAD druid!, unofficial stance- ROFL"<P>Guides and GM's sorta went up in my estimation after that ^_^<BR>Anyway, he told me that there was nothing the GM's could really do against me (unless I kept doing it) and that I could say that I was doing it for rp reasons and that was that (I liked that guide ^_^)<P>but anyway, I must admit (I know it's wrong), that sometimes it is more fun actually staying unanon and letting people ask you for sow/buffs/ports because I just like telling them where to go (if they demand it, that is- a nice request deserves a nice buff)- great for working off pent-up agression bought on by hours upon hours of incessant whining. I dunno weather being a druid has made me nastier as a person or what, but it's got to the point now where I actually "like" arguing with people... *shrug* necromancer is probably a good class for me when I've finished with this one ^_^ I'll be more than evil enough!<P>and to what "thatredguy" said... the<P>"Restate that in a polite sentence and I'll consider it." is definately on the cards <P>bloody good idea ^_^- I'll start subjecting many of the illiterate morons who demand buffs off me to that one *cackle*<P>anyway, just to note- the Druid class is brilliant, tis well balenced, we get decent spells and we are good in either a group or solo (soloing is much more fun- but grouping allows you to meet and get used to new people and trains you up for raids at higher levels), we have good DD's, nice DoT's, snare, root and some handy buffs (oh yeah and the ability to turn into a wolf- how cool is that? ^_^ faster than sow and a cute look at the same time ^_^), I can honestly say I'm content with this class and even if we do get nagged for buffs/ports, the benefits and the fun gained from playing this class far outweigh the shortcomings we get (including the crap leathery armour we have to put up with).<P>But again, good post Shewulf ^_^<BR>I'll reserve my copy of the paperback version anyday =)<BR>

OK, I just hit 29 so I just got ye old basic teleports.  I have always played /anon or /role.  Still, since level 5, if anyone sees me, they ask for sow or port.  Now, generally, I don't mind giving a sow or 2 -- especially to folks that ask nicely.  Sometimes they have to wait though.  I have a lot of played time on my druid for her to be only level 29, but I have probably 3 days worth of time that I have spent just buffing and porting folks.  I never ask for a donation.  If someone gives me one, that's great, if not, oh well.  I have had some people ask very nicely for a sow and tell me at the same time that they have no money though.  I give them the sow -- same with ports.<P>One time though, I was in WFP sowing folks out of the goodness of my heart when this guy who belonged to the server's UBER guild came up and said "SOW ME NOW".  That pissed me off and I said "not going to now" and turned and left.  (Guess I won't be getting into that guild, huh?)  <P>Since I am always anon, I very rarely get tells for ports, but if I am not doing anything and I see folks yelling for one, I will do it.  In fact, the other day, I ported a high level person to BB.  She was trying to get to LFay for some reason, but didn't know how to get there from BB (/ponder lvl 40+ char who doesn't know how to get to LFay from BB?)  Anyway, as I was running her to LFay, she mentioned that she didn't have much money, but that she would give me whatever she had left after making her purchase.  Well, being a kind-hearted druid, I said this wasn't necessary.  I also said I would wait at the LFay zone and would port her back to WC when she was done.<P>I don't mind doing things as long as folks aren't rude, just as many of you do.  I will have to try some of your suggestions for the rude people.  Usually I just ignore them.  But, one thing to keep in mind, there are several classes that get asked for things -- I myself am always looking for breeze/clarity.  Course, I usually do it /ooc and let any 'chanters who want a donation /tell me (cause I always donate if I ask for a buff)<P>Ok, just my 2cp

Um..gee, Mr. Upset Shaman..I didn't even know our dots were nerfed...Hahahah!  I was speaking from experience..perhaps it's different on the server which you play on.  I will tell you for a fact though, on Quellious, if I am holding for a group and a Shaman of the same level as myself comes along, I lose my potential group spot in a split second, because they want the Shaman buffs.  Another thing to think about; you get all of your buffs much, much earlier than Druids do.  Sow at level 9 vs. level 14, Regeneration at level 24 vs. level 34, etc.  Shamans get the most needed group buffs much earlier in their careers than Druids do, which puts them higher on the "most wanted" list.  As for Snare, I agree, it's wonderful...because if it weren't for that wonderful little spell, most Druids would never reach high levels, due to lack of groups hiring us.  If Verant were to take that ability from Druids, I'm sure many of us would sell our gear and retire, because it would cripple us far too much, and we wouldn't even have the option of soloing to gain exp anymore.   Oh, level 60 abilities and spells did you say?  Sorry, I'm only level 35 (still). <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/wink.gif"> I'm afraid that doesn't help me or the rest of my pack very much, since by the time we can USE those skills we won't NEED to group or solo or whatnot.  All that will be left for us to do by that time is make money, PL people or possibly go on Super Raids (which nobody wants us in their groups on anyways).  Trust me, you do have it better as a Shaman.  The fact that Shamans are either large races with high stregnth and stamina or regeneration abilities makes for a much higher survival rate when a creature decides they look tasty and the tanks have trouble taunting them off, for one thing.  A druid gets hit and it's panic city for us..three hits and we're at half hit points or less, and all we can do is scream and run in circles, hoping someone in the group can get it off of us.  LOL...sorry..picture just flashed in my head of me doing that very thing last night in Overthere.  Oh well, nobody is completely happy with their class, and the grass is usually greener on the other side.  Word of advice though..try to speak in whole sentences..it makes your posts much more legible and adds credibility to what you are saying.  Needed word of advice:  How do you indent on this thing?!!  Heheh..thanks for the compliment on my first post, guys.

This is more to shewulf's last post and is nothing to do with that cool and 100% accurate 1st post, so bare with me folks :)<P>The way I work it Shewulf- I port for money, kite for fun and group for xp.<P>Money is somthing I don't get a lot of unless I port, because 90% of the tanks I'm with are all greedy sods and loot without split on ^_^- so porting is my way of making up for that.<P>Grouping is inherantly boring for me, because at 35 (me same level as you ^_^) all they want is either a healer or a snarer/nuker. This is boring- the healing role means you- standup-heal-med-standup-heal-med-standup-heal-med (those poor clerics- the pain that they must feel *sigh*), the snarer/nuker role means you snare-DD-med-snare-DD-med-snare etc etc... kiting is much more exciting- we can DD kite, DoT kite, fear kite (animals), snare-root and DoT, charm-snare-root and DoT- and it's fun because it might not work! (that's where it becomes exciting) but, nevertheless, it's far less mana-efficient than grouping, and I've got 180 WIS...<P>so- as for shamens getting buffs earlier- so what?? (yes I am jealous of em btw- but we get ports *cackle* fair trade) all we (we = meaning both shamens and druids) ever really do in the group at our level anyway is either heal or nuke... yeah ok, the shamen might slow and buff and the druid might snare and buff, but the group has us because we can heal and nuke and anything else after is just a nice bonus.<P>okie me done!<P>nice 1st post shewulf... you should register ^_^

Hmmm , lesee here , the macro thing the other guy stated is a good idea but even better is "soandso's spell fizzles" repeat 10 times and "oom sorry" sit down and continue playing gems =P , also camping a spawn for exp dosent have to be boring and waiting for mana dosent have to happen either , when i solo i never go below 3 bubbles of hp , using elder spiritist gaunts i snare and vambraces i dot with drones of doom , then root for efficiency and sit down and play gems until either a) your drones of doom spell has worn off , at which time i reapply it or b) your engulfing roots spell has worn off , at which time i reapply it , i can solo blue with ease , take em down in about a minute and a half and still have full mana , (i get impatient sometimes and nuke em for that last 600 or so hp) , and as far as grouping goes , its very easy to find a grp as a druid , you just have to get a good rep for knowing what your doing , think of this , if you knew someone had been soloing their entire time as a druid and didnt know a damn thing about healing or buffing or grping , didnt have a macro for heals , didnt know when was the right time to heal and such , you wouldnt want to grp with them either , my druid has a good rep , from lvl 35 up i have been grping anywehre from kaesora to tfs to guk to solb to droga to skyshrine to cs , everywhere , indoor zones and outdoor and ive done fine , and if you cant get into a grp , start your own =) if anyone has any complaints that your a druid , boot em =)...imho druids are a great class they can buff , port , nuke , dot , slow , speed , and the best thing , damage shields =) that stack with mages none the less , the only complaint i would have is verants nerf on dots where if they are running away or toward you in any manner then its only 60% efficient , kinda crappy. but i make due , instead of snare kiting , i snare root kite =P , so dont complain about being a druid , were fun to play , if people bug you , ignore them , if their nice help em out , or dont. whatever suits your fancy , its only a game. And if your want to get into grps easily , get a good rep and get something they want to have in the grp  , like a good sense of humor or a good healing job or some es armour so you can heal and dot and snare at the same time without going oom =)<P>Damion.

Greetings, as a shaman, level 42 at the moment I felt I'd chime in a bit here. I personally think that one of the largest problems facing druids in getting a group is well... all the druids. I'm not meaning this as a personal attack on any individual or the class as a whole, it's just that the class is very popular. And assuming that personalities are spread evenly through all classes, those that have the most people while having the same percentage of inconsiderate or just plain annoying folks amongst them will also have more as a total.<P>What I mean is take for example a group at a spot pulling blues - yellows, I've had this happen to me where there we are, and even though there are so many other spots in the zone a druid will decide to kite over us multiple times. Now, I can understand that if your out taking some risks kiting you would like to have help neerby, but it's plain inconsiderate to kite over a group that was there prior to your arrival in zone, and to do it multiple times doesn't help the situation. I'm not saying that all druids do this, or most, or anyone that posts here. I'm just saying that acts like that can turn people against a class if it happens enough, and since there are more druids and they are one of only a few classes that can kite effectively it's usually one of them that does this. Acts like the one I describe can lead to problems for folks getting along. You also have to remember that alot of Druids do not group very often, especially it seems in the mid levels. If you're not making a positive impact for yourself and your class most people will just see the folks that are out there making a nuisance of themselves and that can cloud their thinking later on when considering groups. I just thought of a couple other examples, but well, I'm not here to fan the flames really.<P><BR>Now as for shaman stat buffs, well I been the only caster with a group that includes between 2 and 3 tanks the entire time I've played eq. The sad thing is everytime I use stat buffs on them they say they never see any benefit from it, well outside stamina. I think that what people should compare stat buffing to is equipment, stat buffs are a major determination of value for an item, and quite a few of them have very nice permanent stat buffs as does enchanted jewelry. If having high stats could drastically alter the outcome of a fight then all those items would be horrendously unbalancing. I think that shaman stat buffs don't do much simply because if they did then all those items would also accomplish the same things, and we'd see folks out there dumping some stuff in favor of the big stats... but that doesn't happen. I'm not saying this to say that druids shouldn't complain or anything, more like airing a theory of mine about stats, and their impact in EQ. I personally think that since EQuipment is the determining factor for all of EQ then stat buffs by adjusting the same values as most eq and being reasonably free simply can't do all that much.<P>Anyhow, this is just my two cents, and no I'm not trying to insult druids, or trying to tell em how to play. I played a druid myself for a while, but decided that they just didn't suit the way I like to play and quit playing one. Ironically I still kite to solo I guess, but its the dot and squat for me with a little root and boot thrown in.<P>Burg Bloodhammer, shaman 42nd level

One other small example of how something started off bad and went well... just the other day a druid who was kiting for the first time in a new zone near where I was hunting rooted the monster so they could regain mana. Now in and of itself that would be fine, but they rooted it literally on top of our tank that was fighting another monster at the time. Fortunately there was enough level difference that the extra didn't hurt too baddly. Now after that the tank sent an ooc bout thanks for the plant there. Now I personally had met that druid and talked with them before and thought they seemed very nice and all. She apologized for the plant and then he led her out to a prime hunting spot that we had used for many levels around her range. I was just thinking last night that I didn't put in any of the good notes I had bout druids and there are quite a few of those as well. <P>I personally have only been ported 1 time by a druid, and that was when I was complaining bout sitting in RV waiting out the night. A druid kindly offered to port me, I ran to the bank to get the un-asked for donation (since I am all to familiar with what spells cost... I've had my share of buff requests as a shammy). I got my port, thanked the person for their time and mana, donated and was on my way. I don't think anyone should feel obligated to help anyone else, but I also think that given sufficient time/mana and all I'll help when I can. It almost seems like a vicious cycle at times, people tick one person off, they ramp up and make other people mad.<P>I've also soloed next to or near many druids that were fine folks, I recall being asked when I was in a group if we'd mind this fellow kiting in that immediate area. We said no, thanked him for asking, and when things went south for us or him there was help at hand. I just wanted to put a few examples of up the kindness and courtesy I've seen from druids as well, since I noticed last night that I hadn't given but one example, and a bad one at that.

Almost to lvl 29 (yeah!!  group port)  (boo I will probablly have to go anon then).  I am also a very kind and generous person but as a druid it is actually hard to accomplish a task as simple as going to your guild to dump some training points and hit the bank to lighten your load.  Need a port, need a buff, need a sow, need an escort.  Add this to the standard begging and hassles every player gets and its no wonder druids, clerics, & chanters can seem to have a nasty attitude.  I will almost certainly have go invis & anon in the lower lvl zones after 29.  Those are the worst zones as many times you are the only druid who can port, sow, ect.  I agree with the first post!!  Especially on it's really rude to run up to any class that is no doubt grouped and ask or demand anything.  I also hate direct tells from strangers requesting anything.  I have only one time in my eq life done that.  I died on the third floor of befallen (dam traps) and after doing several ooc's and shouts for help I finally sent a direct tell to a 50 necro who thankfully helped me get my corpse before it decayed.  But again like the first poster said everyone thinks they are in an emergency situation.  I can see myself not only going anon and roleplay but also soon looking for armor that does not look like standard druid leather  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0">.  I truely do enjoy helping others out allot but sometimes you want to just play uninteruted!!  Actually everyone should play either a cleric, druid, and/or enchanter to lvl 20 or more.  That way they can experience what it's like and would be more considerate when playing any other class.  Well that's my 2 plats.  Good luck and good hunting all!!!!!!

At lvl 41 where I am at the moment, I get alot of requests for sow/ports/buffs.<P>Most of which I am only happy to do providing I'm not in the middle of anything.  As far as the whiners go as most people have already said... just ignore them or cast your lowest lvl buffs on em :P for ports just port em where they don't wanna go.<P>Of course I'd only do that where they really pissed me off!!!

Ok i picked the class so i could do these things SOW/buff/port all of that good stuff druids get. Sometimes even when i am camping something and someone asks really nicely like they are actually roleplaying the character (We all know what a rare and great thing that is). You know the person good evening mi lord i am in dire straits i and my party have died in lands far from these. I being the wordly sort that i am know that your proffesion can mystically move people over great distances And i implore you good sir/maam could you take me to XXX. <BR>I jump right up and ask them where they want to go almost everytime. When these common rules of courtesy are observe while PLAYING YOUR CHARACTER I have no problems doing nice things for people who ask in a fashion similar to this . <BR>However those individuals who stand in front and do that normal little. SOW pls. Oh this will just irritate me to the point where i pretend to be afk.<BR>I have had lvl 55-60 characters ask me in exactly the same fashion as stated above. I was very impressed with this and that person still gave me a bunch of plat.<BR>Anyway before i go off anymore i will leave it at that.<BR>For any people reading this thread trying to figure out how to get a druid to port/ SOW / buff for free try using that vocabulary you picked up and school and roleplay your character you might actually find you like it.

any more i guess i'm kind of bad  if i don't have a spell memmed you don't get it.  And i have sow very seldom memmed anymore.  I solo  almost all the time <lvl 53 and still soloing strong> and my mana = exp  and time.  SO  to make a booring story short if you don't pay i won't buff  tp  or anything else.   If asked rudely  i don't bother with any macro or hiding  i just ignore them and sooner or later they go away.<P>I will if not in the middle of getting exp help someone.  BUT even with my guild  when i first log on i ask if anyone needs a ride and when i log off  i ask again   in between  it better be important  ie  you died.   For melee types  i will help with this problem because of the problem of getting binds and places  but with casters  i have little pity  if they are bound in FV and hunting in GD  just lazy or stupid<P>I have ranted enough  but this is one of my major problems with people  thinking that they deserve a buff or a tp  beause mana is free----- MANA is NOT  FREE---it costs time and my time is important  <IMG SRC="mad.gif" border="0">

This is actually a general question which can pertain to both Druids and Wizards:<P>Has anyone else noticed more and more "Circle/Spire" groupies hanging around?  I'm talking about people who stand around the Druid rings and Wizard ports and jump you the minute you land from a teleport.  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"> It wasn't so bad about a month ago, but now I wish camouflage would stay on when you cast a spell..LOL!  Literally, the minute I ported to West Commons to meet up with a guildmate the other day, I had about 7 people say, almost in unision, "SoW PLZ!"<P>Ye Gods!  <IMG SRC="rolleyes.gif" border="0"> Anywho, I've been playing my enchanter a bit more lately (even though they get the "Breeze, PLZ..you can't win).  How many people in here saw the April Fools joke Baelish posted?  I think it nearly put a grey streak in my hair!  <IMG SRC="redface.gif" border="0">

Was wolf form nerfed? That sucks.<P>Anyways yeah I've just recently started reading this forum and I came across this post that made some very valid points.<P>I'm a 51 druid on the Veeshan server and I usually group in Karnors for xp groups. Personally I hate solo'ing b/c it's boring and i'm a social person but now I'm starting to think that this may be the only way for me to gain xp. <P>In Karnors most groups consist of one cleric, one enchanter/bard, 3 melee (swap one out for a mage/wiz) and a snarer. Well the druid really doesn't fit in anywhere other than the snarer but usually there is 50+ rangers there that can do the job. <P>to put it short <P>need a healer? cleric > druid<BR>need a snarer? ranger > druid - ranger melee<BR>need a nuker/ds? wiz/mage > druid<BR>need crowd control/melee buffs? enchanter/shaman > druid<P>IMHO this puts druids definetly in the solo'ing aspect b/c the only real group beneficial spells we have are our pack spells. <P>example:<P>/shout 51 druid LFG<BR>soandso tells you, "do you regrowth?"<BR>you tell soandso, "sorry i don't get that till 54"<BR>soandso tells you, "oh n/m then"<P>WTF!? sucks to be me eh?

A quick for Namrak, the appeal of Skin Like Nature for newbies is because of the regen component, at low levels the additional 250 HP is an awful lot but, but the regen for 1-2 hours is far more useful, particularly for necromancers and solo tanks  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>Shanya, Innoruuk Server

Dang, says my password is wrong but I don't know what email address I used to register...<P>Okay. been following this thread for a while and have some things to rant on with.<P>I'm a druid of 46 4/5 seasons (tonight, Howling Stones, ding I hope!)<P>And yes, in the past month or so (during which I moved from 41 to 46... I'm a social type) the ringdings -- the lowbies who hang around druid circles to beg for buffs -- do seem to be proliferating.  Worst is when you're either clearly in a group (4-5 other folks pop in when you do all wearing the same guild tag) or perhaps facing the stone sitting down (which I do when I'm in a deep conversation in /tells) and they send you a /tell asking-- or more likely demanding-- a port somewhere else.<P>I rarely port anyone I don't know unless it's a CR.  I don't need the plat (got Ks in the bank and don't need much in the way of equipment we can't camp for ourselves), and I usually am with friends on my way to or from somewhere.<P>I've also stopped mem'ing buffs (except to trade for clarity when a 'chanter asks) just to make folks happy. My regular group has a mid-50's druid, ranger, cleric and mage. So there aren't many buffs I have worth casting on anyone in the group; I keep DDs and DoTs and evac up... I'm the wizzie-dr00d most of the time, backup healer the rest of the time. (cleric keeps mage pet CH'd; I keep dangerranger(s) alive in emergencies)<P>Does this mean I don't wander around the West Gate in FP or the newbie lifts in Kelethin buffing? No! I go up on the walls in WFP and stealth nerf; I run thru newbie areas, buff then camo myself ASAP... the idea is for them to say "Who was that masked druid, anyway?"  THAT is fun. Being beseiged constantly w/ "SoW plz" or "SoW me" or "need sow" (usually spelled that way, which of course isn't a spell, it's a female porcine creature)or "TP me to XY" is NOT fun.<P>I know that for upper level druids the only way to group is w/ an established collection of friends. The group's composition is less important than its regularity and compatibility. Our group rocks... and our best tank is a 55 mage pet. We have 1-2 rangers or 1-2 clerics most nights, 2 druids, and the mage.  Sometimes we get adventurous and make two groups when we get together w/ a chanter and a monk we enjoy but who live in Germany, 6 hours earlier than we are.  The biggest problems are when certain "Friends" come to join up and we have 7 ... there's no good way to make 4/3 groups w/ our usual folks.  And we have alliances where we can sometimes join a larger adventure.<P>I've yet to see the planes; may never get there though I"m of level to do so.  It's not about loot (though it is about exp till I catch up to the 50+'s in the group)-- it's about adventure!  Been to Seb once; died 3X and it was awesome!  That's my idea of EQ heaven, not "SoW plz" and "Port me to XX" and "level 46 druid LFG"<P>Phew... long rant  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">  Bottom line: leave us alone unless it's an emergency; we don't mind helping when the need is real but we hate being pestered by folks who assume that our mana is free and our time is endless.<P>Wolana Kestrel, 46 seasons, druid of Kelethin, Knight General in service to her majesty Queen Jalea, Soldiers of Fortune, Xegony

Speaking of Kelethin, when I'm in an evil mood I'll go there and sow everyone - they all seem happy about it though and really only a few drop off the sides    <IMG SRC="rolleyes.gif" border="0">

I understand about the tells though im a enchanter instead of a druid. Im on my way to OT or whereever and and im minding my own business and out of no where i get demands for clarity. Most of time i oblige but I tell them to come to me because i will not go out of my way unless im asked very nicely and i know there is gonna be a donation. This may sound rude and stupid but clarity it good way to make money for my jewelry habit and it is necessary to do, especially since clarity takes a whole bubb of mana at my level of measly 31, not to mention augmentation,alacrity,dot,charm, granted the dot and charm i use only when necessary but the others are major mana consumers, mainly 3 4 bubb to full bubb of mana for each spell, that adds up even for me, with clarity it takes a lot of time to make up mana over and over again.
