<p>Okay im still real new to the shammy class.  Ive reached 12th lvl but my main is 30th so im not a newbie (totally).  Now i know were not good at soloing pre pet levels, but we all know it does and will happen when you have to solo.  Does anyone have the time to gimme a rundown on how we solo and at what spell levels any of it changes?  I know (for example) lvl 14 on you can do root n nuke.  But does this change at all at say lvl 19 or 24?  Some people would have me believe were decent at meleeing.  Im a bit doubtful on that part.  Experienced shammies please give me an idea how we solo and just how much i can/should melee.  Thank you for your time</p>

Shaman are adequate at melee. They'll never touch a real melee class in that area, but they can melee all the same. My shaman had pretty good ac between 14 and 34. I had a medley of banded, Cabilis scale, and Scaled Mystics armor. At 14, you can root and nuke, but it's sloppy at best. Most of my fights started with my best slow spell followed by my best DoT. Then, I'd just beat the monster to death. Sometimes, I found it better to let 1 DoT run it's course while the mob was rooted, the reapply the DoT, hit it with slow, then finally melee. This strategy worked fine for me every time. At 24, it just gets easier to do the same thing, or you can simply root and poison your target if you really don't like melee. At 29, things got much easier. I had about 680 ac at that point, a good slow spell, and haste. In most cases, I didn't even need to rely on my spells to do damage. I could melee a target to death...though a poison DoT always made things nicer. Most shamans that complain about a lack of melee ability are the ones who dress like druids and ignore ac. A shaman is able to wear heavier armor than druids, so they should take advantage of that. A high wis isn't all that important since we get a mana regen spell at 24, and mana regen is much more important that max mana. If you haven't yet invested much into your shaman, I suggest you run your ac up as high as you can, and not worry too much about wis until you have to. It really does make things much easier. Even if you choose not to melee when gaining exp, you should melee a little (maybe against low blues) just to keep your def skill maxed. That's free ac. You can't beat that with a stick. Shaman do not melee well, but with the right combination of spells, we can bring out target down close to our level so that both we and our opponent stink. Once we get 'em there, our damage spells can give us a nasty edge.

The shaman can solo at all levels and decently, even though not as well as some classes at all of those levels. (Necro's, Mages, and Droooids come to mind.)<P>It is a relatively easy concept for Shaman to solo. Here are the basic steps that are the same up through the levels. Fudge them as you will for your own personal style.<P>1 - Slow (Great line of spells)<BR>2 - Poison DoT<BR>3 - Disease DoT<BR>4 - Root<BR>5 - Back up and Meditate while MoB dies.<BR>6 - Reapply Poison and Root as needed.<BR>7 - Melee/DD to finish up<P>That is it in a nut shell. Sure some Shaman had Warriors as their first character and thus like to melee more than others. So they would not bother with rooting most of the time, just smack the beastie down while the DoT's do their business. Other shaman played weenie casters for too many levels and will run around in circles "kiting" their foes. Each to their own style I guess.<P>I love my Shaman Tank. (Sherman Tank) We have decent enough AC. Close to the rangers/rogues in both AC and HP's though our melee abilities and weaponry is no where near either any 'melee' class. We make up for that with our spell selection. Haste self and slow mobs suddenly makes us into a far better melee class. Toss in a pet and some DoT's and we are a force for solo'ing in a melee style. Did I mention I LOVE my Shaman Tank?<P>In addition, here is just a little something of what you are looking forward to as a shaman in a group situation as well.<P>Keyword : Versatility.<P>Subtle differences in what, as a shaman, I had as a role. But it is the ability to shift roles as the group dynamics change that makes us such a wanted class. Sure we really do not have much in the way of a class defining ability ( Alchemy aside ) which no other class is able to do. But we are the oil that keeps the group working smoothly. We flow into the cracks, filling almost any need the group may have. <P>Last night in 4 groups of various make-ups, I played 4 slightly different roles. Listed are the roles in order of importance for the group.<P>First group in SolB's LBugs consisted of a cleric/monk/ranger/warrior/druid, I was Slow/Haste/Buffer.<P>Second group in King consisted of cleric/monk/ranger/warrior/enchanter, I was Slow/Heal/Buffer. Most of the heals were of the enchanter as she got bounced around mez'ing.<P>In the third group in Tiger consisting of a pally/druid/enchanter, I was Slow/Healer/Melee/Buffer.<P>Fourth group in Tiger was Druid/Enchanter, I was Tank/Slow/DoT/Buffer. This was nearly a solo'ing type situation.<P>--------------------<P>~I'm a little teapot, short and stout. Here is my handle. Here is my spout. Tip me over and pour me out.~ Ancient Halfling Warrior Chant<P>Failbhean, 51 Champion<BR>Failbhe, 52 Mystic

By the way, you said you root and nuke.  This is wrong--very wrong.  Root and dot.  Each DD has a chance of breaking root.  Your dots are more mana efficient as well.

Our DoTs can also break root (since they have a DD component), but it happens far less frequently than a pure DD spell.<P>I usually drop on a Tainted Breath and Envenomed Breath (Yes, they do stack despite what some people claim), then Root and back off to med/heal/Cannibalize (only if I am above 80% health and my regen is doing fine to cover any damage I take).  Most of the time the DoTs drop off before Root, so I get up and renew them, then renew Root when it breaks and repeat the process.<P>After two rounds of poison, most monsters are low enough that they are going to try to flee when Root breaks.  At that point I blast with a couple DDs and loot.  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">

Hey,<P>Where you are lvl 12 most of your soloing is still going to be Melee. <BR>Pull with the Slow or Dot.<BR>Then Melee it to death. There is really not much else to do at this point.<BR>At lvl 14 things change a little where you get a ROOT, DD, and DOT. <BR>But to be honest...get into a GROUP the exp will flow if in the right group.<P>Get to Oasis until lvl 18-19, then head over the Lake of Omen. I lvl 19-29 there in a VERY short time...just make sure you head toward the Sarnak Fort.

" A high wis isn't all that important since we get a mana regen spell at 24, and mana regen is much more important that max mana. "<P>What?  All new shaman please ignore.  There is no mana regen spell at 24.  I'm guessing you mean the combo of Regen and Cannabilize.  Of course, every time you cannabilize you lose HP increasing your downtime.  When I created my first shaman I put no points into wisdom cause I didn't know better and quit the character at lev 29.  I rerolled and did it right next time.  Now my wisdom is 139 at levl 25 and the difference in combat effectiveness between the two characters is tremendous.  Previously I would often zone because I spent my nukes and dots (and lets not forget fizzles) and the mob is left with too much health (and me too little).  That never happens now unless I pull a tough yellow.

Well, putting no points into wisdom is an extreme situation, and a very silly one.  Of course you had trouble.<P>And you knew he was talking about cannibalize, gimme a break.  And cannibalize does make your mana increase, or, regen. Same thing, whatever.<P>And using it doesn't always increase your downtime either; sometimes it decreases it.  <P>Anyway, to the original poster, I'd just say that you should melee at every opportunity, almost.  Keep your casting skills up, too, though, especially being careful not to let conjuration(your DOTs) get too far behind, or divination.  Most shamans let divination, especially, fall far behind.  Keep conj up by conjuring food and water over and over again until you want to scream; keep div up by using sense animals and true north for an hour or so every once in a while.  Casting skills max out at level x 5, plus an extra 5, and melee(for shamans) at level x 4 plus. <P>The reason I say keep melee up every chance you get is that you can increase casting skills in the ways I just mentioned, not by fighting.  Weapons skills and offense and defense ONLY go up by fighting.  You miss your chance, it's gone.  It's easy to get way behind, and most shamans do -- most get far behind in defense, and are only good at one weapon, usually the spear.<P>You're too powerful a character not to be well-rounded in everything.  You're a great tank when soloing, once the mob is slowed and you have a "quick" or "haste" spell on, and are all buffed out -- IF you wear lots and lots of AC gear.  You'll probably want to have plenty of wisdom/mana gear AND AC gear, and switch them in and out depending on the situation.  Even in your 40's and into your 50's, you can still do a LOT of melee damage.  Personally, at level 45 I melee like crazy, using a two-hand blunt, and never cast a DOT at all, and am almost never in danger.  I can do the same thing with a one-hand club or a spear, because I earned it by fighting up close and personal a lot.  I won't be able to do this after a while, because super-high level mobs are just too tough, but I'll be very glad at that point that I built up my skills before then, so I can take a hit, or land a spear or club or staff that fires off a spell into the hide of an enemy.  (What good is a good weapon if you can't land it, or don't have the AC to take a hit while you try?)<P>Anyone who doubts the value of defensive skill should remember that every increase in defense skill equals 2.5 AC.  The only way to increase defense skill is to melee and get hit.  You won't get hit enough in groups for it to matter, once you get beyond perhaps your 20's.  So you'll have to solo to keep your potential AC up, or you won't be nearly as tough as you could be.  And there's no sense not having high AC; there's not a character in the game who doesn't benefit by high AC.  <P>Solo and melee as much as you can while young, because it's much harder getting skill increases and still surviving after you level a bit--mobs become much tougher.  If you group a lot you will probably level much faster, but be weak or only good at one weapon.  If some nice weapon drops into your lap, you won't be able to use it except for the stats on it, and if something hits you, you're in real deep trouble real fast compared to someone who has put in the grunt work, meleeing his defense/AC up.<P>There's plenty of time for casting.  You'll rarely not have casting maxed or close to it.  Don't rush into the wisdom thing and get too hooked on casting; there will come a time when that's all you'll be doing.  Mix it up a little, and melee, and get those melee skills up before the mobs become so tough it's just too late.  You can't regret doing the right thing by your character.  Imagine the difference it would make having 50 more AC, and then go out and get it -- for free! -- by meleeing stuff.

Unfortunately up to 49 I'd say, shamans can't solo really efficiently, it's when they start getting the real good dots that do 1k+ and jbb if they can equip and afford it that they really start to shine, and 50+, they're one of the only classes that can solo damn well in high level dungeons (if they're careful) like karnor's and possibly sebilis (need reflexes though).  That or just partner up with a monk, my best was with a monk at level 56 in kc we cleared a train a of 5, easy when u slow them all with turgurs.<P>--------------------<P>Nektar Nefaste, 59 shaman

I remember when I was 34 in north karana, still pimping my full banded and bf hammer, I almost got smacked by an sg, but I used the following strategy: I trained the hg to guard tower, let him kill the 2 guards, after that he was at about 1/3 hps, and then I cast scourge, and ran around like a little girl for a good while, that's not feasible tho to get steady exp, I know, but at the level I was, I was so happy to get 30pp.<BR>In any case, I didn't solo much at all up until level 45, I didn't even know the true power of a shaman as I'd just dd, heal, buff all the time.<BR>But I still have soloing advice that might be of help, personally, I'd ditch the pet, they're weak, unless u want to summon one after every fight but that's a waste of mana.  As I still use my level 14 root, I'd still stick with that, casting time is lower and less mana.  I'd also put dex and cha buff up to make your spells more effective.  I don't know if dex does anything, maybe it's just luck that it works better when I choose to dex myself, but anyways...  Also make shure to have regen on and cannibalize memmed.  And say you wanna fight an sg or whatever, slow him first, root, dot, sit down at a distance, and just wait (enstill won't make a difference, I've found that mobs have an pretty much equal chance at breaking any root while dd'ed or dotted).  And once u see root break, stand up quick, root him, back up and sit again until dot wears off and recast, etc etc.  I'm figuring an sg has what, 1500 hps?  3-4 scourges should do the job, and while u sit down just watching him decay, u'll be regaining mana, and if he's slowed and manages to hit u before u get root off, shouldn't be too damaging.  It's a long fight, but at that level I think that's one of the better ways to solo as a shaman, and it's not very good at that either because we don't get snare.  You can envy the druids all you won't, but if you hang in there, you'll get your reward in due time.  How many other classes other than shamans are capable of soloing level 51+ mobs?  At level 51 u get one of the best spells in the game, and it slows a mob's attack rate by 75%, which make them beasts.  Oh, and another advantage compared to druids, u can farm dungeons much easier where the good stuff drops, I remember spending one week clearing everything around solo, and got 20 level 39 summon corpse spells and 3 ishva robes that I lottoed with me, myself and I  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">  So yah, all in all, I'd recommend getting into good groups up until high 40s, shamans are not really designed to solo at lower levels, but once u get there, you can start cruisin 5th gear and rise above almost any other class when it comes to solo capabilities. Regrowth/stat buffs/chloroblast/cannibalize III/turgurs/jbb/root/dots u can't really beat that combo :-)   <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" border="0"><P>--------------------<P>Nektar Nefaste, 59 shaman

Cannabilize/Regen is *not* a remedy for inadequate base wisdom.  The more base wisdom you have the less you need to canabilize.  The less you cannabilize the less downtime you have....simple logic.  If I have 140 base wis and the other guy has 115 base wis, the other guy is gonna need to cannabilize more and sit on his butt while his health regens.

uuuuh, it doesn't really matter what your base wis is, it's your current wis that does, and for another your wisdom determines your mana pool, it doesn't matter if you have 150 or 200 wisdom, if you manage to kill a mob with your mana, the downtime will always be just as much all other factors being held constant, it just looks like less to regen because your manabar is in percentage form.  It takes 3/5 of a bub to cast regrowth with my wisdom gear, naked it takes 1.5, but your mana regens just as fast no matter what your manapool is, and cannibalizes gives u just as much mana in each case.<P>--------------------<P>Nektar Nefaste, 59 shaman

And regrowth has a dual advantage too, it saves a ****load of healing mana, if u wanted to test it, it could probably heal 4k dmg for the time it lasts, not an exaggeration, one cannibalize is 78ish dmg and regrowth heals about a third of that per tick, let's say a fourth, in 20 second 90 dmg healed, 1 minute, 360, 10 minutes 3600, not too shabby imo.<P>--------------------<P>Nektar Nefaste, 59 shaman

I have to disagree that shamans are not good at soloing until 49.  I solo all the time, and have at least a bit at most every level to my present level 45, and do it using mostly melee, to boot, and do it with only 120 wis, the rest all AC armor -- although I've used different armor/wis at different times.  <P>The argument that they can't do it EFFICIENTLY is a subset of the above argument, and more complicated than it seems.  The main reason it might seem inefficient is because it can require long downtimes.  That itself is complex and subject to a lot of variables dependent on yet other variables, so what is true for some may not be true for others.  In other words, soloing will be efficient for some, but not others.  I would argue that if it is not efficient for many people, that is more often than not because they have neglected certain aspects of their development and have come to pay the price.  Many shamans start on an irreversible spiral down to weakness.<P>If you are casting a lot of DOTs, you'll  need a lot of downtime to meditate your mana back up.  If you are casting a lot of heals because you get beat up a lot, also lots of downtime.  If you're not managing your pet right and have to heal him all the time, more downtime.<P>However, you might be casting a lot of DOTs and heals because your have poor weapons skills and poor armor and/or have poor defense/AC for your level and the level of mobs you are fighting, and simply are not tough enough to do any physical fighting; you might be relying on DOTs because you realistically have no other choice, given how you have thus far chosen to develop your character.  For most shamans, the latter will be the case.  Very few I ever bump into have their defense maxed, thereby maximizing their natural AC.  However, you can build up your AC through simple hard work.  <P>If you do keep your AC up, you will need substantially fewer heals.  Personally, I never cast one.  I don't even keep heal memmed when soloing.  I just keep chloroplast on.  You'll also need far fewer DOTs.  Therein lies the potential efficiency, once you're fully prepared.<P>As an example from my own experience, when I first noted, at level 39, that I had gotten far behind in my melee skills and defense/AC, I spent a couple of weeks selling SOW potions like mad so I could buy some better AC armor.  Then I went to the Overthere and started soloing to fix myself up.  <P>I pulled with winter's roar (230 DD) and dragged the mob back to my pet, who was far enough away that by the time the mob caught up to the pet and me, I had successfully cast a slow spell.  I cast the venom of snake DOT.  Then the pet and I meleed.  I got beat up pretty good, and sometimes the pet did too, because my weapons skills could have been higher and caused more aggro.  I cast the VOS DOT a second time.  Sometimes I won handily, sometimes I barely survived.  I died a couple of times.<P>After a while, my weapons skills shot way up, as did offense, and, most importantly, defense, which increased my AC.  My defense went up more than 20 points, giving me more than 50 extra AC.  (By now, it has gone up far more.)  This made all the difference in the world.  Now, I pull with my lowest mana DD, just to get some aggro going, or sometimes with malise to lower resistance to my slow spell.  I do NOT DOT any more except, or make any significant expenditure of mana except for the slow spell(which doesn't take much), unless in a situation that runs really sour, like when the mob seems to get maximum hits off on me every time, and I get off minimum hits, and so does my pet, or I pull two mobs by accident.  But that hardly ever, ever happens.  Generally, I cause ALL damage by melee, either from me or my pet.  And I'm far safer doing it than I was back when I had let my skills slip.  I'm generally down anywhere from a bubble of health to two bubbles at the end of a fight.  So I med a minute or two and go pull the next mob.  Pet doesn't need a heal, he's fine.<P>Now, this is extremely efficient, and doesn't call for uber items like the JBB bracer.  It seems I hardly ever sit still.  Was it efficient at first?  Heck, no.  The nay-sayers are right on that one.  But after all my skills built up and my natural AC got built up by taking punches, it has become extremely efficient.<P>So, the nay-sayers are right regarding efficiency and abilty to solo, for their situation, and I am right, for mine.  But mine used to be theirs.  I didn't want it to be, so I did the hard work, and now it isn't.<P>I asked myself how weak I wanted to be, and answered, well, not very.  And I went out and did something about it.<P>Along the way, I gradually swapped out more and more of my wisdom gear for pure AC gear.  For instance, I swapped out my runed mithril bracers (AC 4, wis 5, str 3) for rygorr bracers (AC 9).  I was down a lot of wisdom doing that, and that made me nervous.  But I came to realize that if I had built up enough natural AC, and added enough AC through tough armor, what exactly would I be using my wisdom for, or need it for?  Did I have enough mana without the wisdom bracers to root stray mobs, cast a heal(which I used to have memmed) or two, cast a few slows and DOTS in case the ones I cast failed to stick, and not be left without enough mana for a gate away from extreme danger, or some other need?  Did I still have enough mana for all that?  The answer was a clear yes.  Was I ever likely to really actually need all that mana anyway?  No.<P>That's because AC=mana, in a way -- in the situations I'm talking about.  If you get tough enough and have enough AC that you only need one DOT before the mob dies, not two, do you need the mana for that second DOT?  Same goes for heals.  If you need substantially less mana than you did before, it's also true that you need to wear fewer wisdom items.  They can then be replaced by items with better AC.  This will require still fewer heals on your part, requiring still less in the way of wisdom items.  My wisdom is varies from 120 to 148 when meleeing solo, and I am never in any real danger either way.<P>The trick is to recognize the point of diminishing marginal returns, as economists would say.  At what point do you have too little wisdom for the situation at hand, and at what point do you need to increase your AC gear?  Well, that depends on the mobs you are fighting, and the dangers of the zone.  Lots of wanderers?  You might need more wisdom to cast extra roots.  Very poor natural AC because you've been grouping and player a caster shaman too long?  You could well find soloing very inefficient and even dangerous until you shape up.  At a certain point, the extra AC or wisdom you get by wearing a certain piece of equipment will not be worth it, and only experimentation will show you where the balance lies for you individually.  Importantly, this IN TURN will change as your skills change, and sometimes dramatically.  This is what makes equipment decisions so complex -- it's based on variables that themselves change over time and depend on your situation.  <P>And therein is the rub -- NO question exists as to whether increased AC obtained through meleeing up your natural defense/AC is helpful; it's helpful no matter how high a level you get.<P>The real question I see is whether to go through the slower leveling that sometimes comes when you solo to build up these benefits.  You're not going to be getting the melee experience you need by grouping, and grouping in the right places will level you too quickly to keep you from dropping far behind in your melee skills.  So solo is the only realistic way to keep your melee skills/offense/defense high or maxed for your level.<P>Do you want to spend the time, and, yes, sometimes the boring time necessary to build up your solo ability?  If your armor pieces are presently too lousy to make you feel safe even trying it, are you willing to spend a week or so doing nothing but earning money, say, selling SOW potions, like I did, so you can buy something better?  Those are personal decisions.  <P>Frankly, my dramatic increases in AC gained by meleeing have made me a far, far tougher character than I used to be, beating even my most optimistic expectations, and made my decision a clear winner for me.  For the entire rest of my shaman career, I will enjoy those benefits.  Anybody I group with will also enjoy the benefits of having a shaman far less likely to die, as well.<P>They have also made me a very efficient solo artist far before level 49.  Are all shamans very efficient soloers?  Nope; it's something you have to earn, and you can't get it just by casting or having great armor or being twinked.  YOU MUST FIGHT.  And it's not enough to win; in a way, you must also lose--you must get hit a LOT.  As a matter of fact, doing things the usual way, leveling primarily via casting solo and/or in groups, will almost ensure that, while you can solo, it will not be all that efficient.  So for most people, soloing will be less of an option, and if they don't want to put the hard work in, maybe that's just fine for them.  <P>However, if you are willing to put the hard work in, the benefits will be there for you forever.  The natural AC you've built up will apply whether you are grouped or solo.  If a great weapon drops in your lap, you'll be able to use it right away, and to great effect.  (My two-hand blunt, for instance, used to be horrible, but now it's so good I put out so much damage I don't even need a shield.)  You'll still be just as good a caster as any casting shaman is, if you spend a few hours summoning food and practicing divination or firing off a few newbie evoc DD's at yourself or weenie mobs in a low level zone.  (Alteration takes care of itself, through cannibalize.)  That's important--you give up NOTHING by being a melee shaman while you're still young enough to do it without getting killed, and get enormous gains -- extreme efficiency, even pre-level 49, is certainly among them.  <P>Shamans played like casters too long, however, CANNOT EVER go back and get their melee skills back up, no matter how hard they try and how much they wish they had done things differently.  The mobs just get too tough, while you've gotten too weak.  Casting will be your way to go, and your only realistic option.  You can bet even a level 50 or 60 would be being dishonest if he said he didn't want 50 extra AC.  I can tell you for sure, though, that he doesn't want to get hit long enough by the mobs he's regularly fighting at that level to get it.<P>So being a melee shaman for a while by getting plenty of solo time in has no downsides, but fantastic upsides, while taking the typical easy way out that most shamans do has some unfortunate downsides -- poor weapons skills, poor offense, poor defense and therefore natural AC.<P>The only real consideration to me is time and fun factor.  Soloing can be boring and time consuming.  So you have to ask yourself how much the strength and survivability of your character is worth to you -- don't forget how much it's worth to the group.  A dead shaman often means a dead group.  How long do you want to take to develop your character fully?  I think I've been clear as to the benefits, and made clear that they're not merely theoretical, but come from my own personal experience, and I hope you can see how they would apply to yours.  However, I can't say anything helpful on what anyone might personally value, or how they like best to spend their time.  I can't argue that these benefits come without a cost to be paid -- in terms of a longer time taken to level, and possible boredom, and, until you get the hang of things and your abilities and natural defense/AC increase, an increased chance of dying if you're not careful.  <P>And if you hate soloing in the first place, nothing I've said above can matter.  Even if that's the case, though, you might find soloing less boring when your abilities are raised and you're constantly in action, and not medding.  And after a while, you'll find you level very quickly by soloing too.  Just not necessarily at first.  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">  <BR>_____________________________________<BR>I also disagree that the pet is no good.  If he's dying every time, you're not using him right -- he's probably being used like a tank and not like a DOT.  He should be used, I think, in a way that makes sure he doesn't die--after you've dotted and/or debuffed, then slowed and/or meleed the mob enough so the mob hates your guts and will more or less ignore the pet.  If the mob starts paying more attention to the pet, move closer to the mob so he hits you preferentially.  If that still doesn't do it, fire off a blast or another DOT; that will almost always do it.  Then the pet acts like a DOT, which always works well for me.  I can fight for 10 hours without losing a pet, no problem.  If you can't seem to keep the pet from dying no matter what you do, fight the mob far away from the pet for a while, and only later drag him to the pet.

Sorry to say, but post 50, u can pretty much forget about melee cuz there's no way even if u had 3000 ac that u could absorb double hits of 120-200dmg considering at my level, I have 1200ish base hps unbuffed.  <BR>Reason why shaman pets are useless?  A shaman is not designed to be an outdoor kiter, he shines the most in dungeons where other classes would be crushed in 2 seconds.  Pets in a dungeon, extremly bad idea, for one, he's green, so his and consequently your aggro range is considerably larger, and for another when the mob starts running away he would just cause trains and in a dungeon, very bad idea to put a pet on /notaunt cuz at least if u see the message taunting attacker master and he's nowhere in sight, it's a pretty safe bet to either zone or gate the hell out.  <BR>Up until level 45, I didn't even know what slowing was, I was always grping outdoors, and I'd just heal/buff/melee with my UB0R bf hammer, so I know what the hard way is, although I only maxed 2hb.  However, it's not true that u cannot max your other melee skillz at higher levels, I'm just too lazy to practice piercing on blues during raids for instance, but no matter what level you are, if a shaman slows all the time, you're BOUND to max your defense cuz slow = aggro, aggro = mob on you, mob on you = sometimes he misses u = defense skill automatically goes up.  The only melee skill I regret not practicing is piercing but if I was adamant on maxing it, I could just swing at blue-yellow-red mobs all day during a guild raid.  AC is a key aspect to his survival, but wisdom is crucial to him more than u might think and eventually u will realize my point.  It's like telling a level 55 warrior to solo drolvarg captain in that case, the tank is gunna get SMOKED without a doubt whilst a shaman is perfectly capable of doing so with slows/malosi/cannibalize/heals/dots (shaman dds at high levels are rendered useless because of casting time), the best solution is to try and balance out wisdom and ac at the same time, wisdom being given priority to a certain degree.  I often camp sentient in wakening, double hit for 117 and kicks for 50ish, don't tell me ac is gunna be the determining factor in your success, u need fire power to take down something with 7-8k hps, and without the mana power, u can pride yourself in your ac and melee skillz all u want, but u will go down in a heartbeat with mana being depleted so rapidly.  AC helps, it helps a LOT, but above all, your mana is what counts the most (to a certain extent of course).<P>--------------------<P>Nektar Nefaste, 59 shaman

Well, that's the very POINT of having high AC, Somadjinn. The higher your AC the less you get hit and the less likely you are to get hit for max damage. I have just short of 1800 hitpoints self buffed at 56 and I can stand head to head with dars and boks in Sebilis, solo, long enough that Plague wears off before they die pretty often. The boks beat on me pretty hard still, sometimes I have to toss a heal on myself during the fight, but dars rarely knock a bubble of health off me.<P>I'm still surprised so many people repeat this misinformation over and over again about teh shaman class and melee. It's not that hard to verify or disprove. Assuming you have good AC gear and max defense skill, suit up and go try it. I don't know about YOUR shaman, but my shaman can stand against a slowed Sebilis bok longer than most warriors my level can against an un-slowed Sebilis bok. That's not an un-impressive capabilty.

Speaking from the standpoint of a measily lev 26, I can appreciate the value of AC....I recently went from a 2hb to a piercer/shield combo (+6 wis +15 ac) and saw a rather significant improvement in my remaining HPs after battle.  And, of course, the Jade Chok Prod gave me extra wisdom so it was a win/win solution over my old glowing wooden crook.  As far as mana pool regen is concerned, you can argue it any way you want, but a higher wisdom pool keeps you active for longer periods of time than a smaller pool.  Even if the mana pool is measured on a percent basis I might be draining only 25% with a kill while the other guy is draining 50%....who's up and ready for battle faster?  And regen/cannabilize is not the solution to make that gap up unless you have a bunch more hit points.

Slam, your point on total mana pool is well taken on uber-mob raids where you start the fight with full mana - but not in the average grind group. I can't remember the last time I was full mana in a grind group. I usually try to keep between two and three bubbles of mana all the time, which I do by canning between fights. Having more total mana won't make me mana regen faster, or cannibalize faster either. But having high AC will likely leave me with more health to convert after the fight.

Yes, I did, but I wouldn't strive to get 1k ac at the expense of 60 wisdom either, at lower levels, doesn't matter as much, but have u ever been in OS when the tank pulls 5 mobs at once?  What does a shaman do?  Turgur a couple, pump in some heals to the puller while the cleric is trying the same, and resume to slowing the other ones, and I've often found myself at 20 mana after the whole ordeal is over, including the fact that slows sometimes are resisted and will not land unless the mob is tashed/malosinied, if u have 140 wisdom let's say, in a lot of situations the grp will NOT survive because a mob unslowed at higher levels deal too much dmg, it's nice and dandy to have high ac, but if u don't have the proper amt mana to slow everything around, you're as good as dead.  AC really helps, but considering so much is demanded out of a shaman spellwise, you do need quite a lot of mana to keep the grp alive, and u saying that u can tank a slowed mob more efficiently than a warrior when unslowed just proves my point, if you're oom, you're oom, simple as that and no matter what your ac is, you will drop like a bowling pin if the mob is not slowed.  What you need is a good combination of wisdom/ac, and remember, chanters have poor ac, and how do they survive with all that aggro?  <BR>With good wisdom and mediocre ac, you can  survive ok, with terrible wisdom and excellent ac, good luck.<BR>I have about 860 ac and 1700 hps buffed, and 200 wisdom with bearform (not necessary, 180 wisdom could probably get u just as far), and I do just fine except for times like today in Hate when the puller aggroed 3 clerics of innoruuk, a kirakuwhatever, and an ire ghast, with 3 clerics beating on me like mad unslowed, u think it will make a difference if I had 140 more ac in hopeless situations like those when almost everyone around is dead?  Maybe a couple seconds, but that would just add to the tension   Now time to log back on, and await my rez to re-earn my 57th level   <IMG SRC="tongue.gif" border="0">   <IMG SRC="redface.gif" border="0"><P>--------------------<P>Nektar Nefaste, 59 shaman

Well, I'm not saying AC is the answer to everything all the time; far from it.  I specifically noted that grouping is a different matter.  <P>I also noted that at the highest levels, you won't be able to be meleeing as much as you could even when you're solo -- the mobs just get too tough.  Their hitpoints get outrageous then, and they sometimes triple and quad-hit.  It's encouraging to hear good stories about people meleeing really high mobs, but I know you'll at least have to be much more selective as to which ones you can kill by primarily melee tactics, and your equipment had better be good.<P>But I continue to feel that it's exactly because the mobs have so many hitpoints and hit so hard and fast that higher levels are the worst time to start working on AC and weapons skills.  <P>You survive by a much thinner margin a lot of times.  It's when I'm taking quad-hits from monster mobs that I want my defense/AC ALREADY maxed.  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"> I don't want to begin the process of catching up then -- the mobs are so much tougher than the ones at lower level, that working on AC is much more dangerous then.  At level 30, I may be in some danger when I take double hits from mobs with low hitpoints if I'm not up to snuff, but at level 55, say, quad-hits can be a quick disaster to you, and a couple quick smacks from your friends on a mob's back won't solve the problem in a second or two and end the danger.  If casting our 51 slow is as big an aggro as everyone says, I'll be under a lot of pressure, and really want to be able to handle REAL tough mobs and not die, not be working my way toward it.  I love a margin of error.<P>I also found that it takes a LONG time -- a VERY long time, to work up skills and defense/offense once you've let them slip.  And while you do, you're in more danger than you would otherwise have to be.  I wasn't that far behind at 39, but even at the end of my hell level of 40, my offense and defense had a long way to go, as did my weapons skills.  Every level just put me five points further behind.  It took me till 43 to max my offense, and until 45, I think, to max my defense/AC.  That's six levels of near constant melee!  And I already had been meleeing more than most shamans I knew, and had pretty decent defense/AC and armor, both.  <P>I brought my 2h blunt up to 180, and my 1h blunt to 180, and piercing to 173, but my weapons max is 185 at my level.  I'm still quite far behind, considering how slowly increases come.  Sometimes I literally haven't gotten a single weapon skill or defense increase in five hours.  If 45 wasn't a hell level, I'd have no chance of maxing out all my weapons.  And then next level, of course, that part begins again.  Thank goodness my defense maxed out though!  It's SO much easier to survive now.<P>The thing is, if you max your defense at 55, versus maxing it at 45, you've gone ten whole levels with far less armor -- and survivability -- than you could have had.  And your group could have had, too.  That's a VERY long time to be weaker than you have to be, and right when you're starting to transition into much tougher mobs in scarier places.  <P>And if you die in the process?  Well, dying at lower levels is no fun, but post-50 it's a horror show.  It takes forever to make up that d*mn experience.  That's a huge reason I don't want to be worrying about my melee capabilities at that point.  While I may not need my weapons because I'm mostly casting while grouped in dungeons, I'll definitely want the defense/AC, because dying is awful then -- even with a rez, it stinks.  A death at 20 or 30 or 40 hardly slows me down, in comparison.  THAT's the time to take risks meleeing, or even to care about melee, because melee works very well then.  Also every level earlier that you get your defense up is a very nice gain you can enjoy for that much longer.  From seeing and talking to most of the shamans I bump into in the game, it's a benefit they usually don't have, but I'll bet it's one they'd want.<P>I love hearing stories about us being able to take a pounding at high levels, and want to do everything I can to prepare for that as quickly as possible.  Like I said in my other post, doing so has eliminated a LOT of my downtime, and taken me out of a lot of the danger I used to be in.  A lot of mobs actually don't do a whole lot to my health now, bringing me down maybe half a bubble.  Those guys would have murderized me if I had had to take that kind of abuse before working up both my weapons skills and defense/AC.<P>Now I can go off to face those uber mobs in my coming seasons with a great deal more confidence.  I don't expect I'll be meleeing in the future anywhere near as much as I can and do now, or even be able to. But, I am prepared to take a hit from mobs that one day perhaps I will have to use mostly casting to kill if solo, or that I couldn't solo at all.  Or, as prepared as I possibly can be, anyway.  <P>I'd rather have a shaman with 50 more AC in my group than a shaman without it.  Getting my AC up hasn't cost me a thing -- I can still put wisdom and mana armor on.  I can get my wisdom up to 205 if I want to with the equipment I have at this point, and I have a number of nice mana items too.  I still have all the casting potential of people who haven't worked on melee -- I just also have something extra -- the ability to take a much bigger hit and survive, and, thereby, help my whole group survive.  No small thing!<P>And if I want to run up and land a stun or a Blight Hammer DOT or whatever, I have the option to try it and land a blow, and land it for max damage, and take a hit while trying.<P>If I were in my 50's or mid 50's or late 40's and didn't have uber armor(which I don't) and a JBB(which I don't) or good defense/AC (which I DO) or good weapons skills(which I DO), I think I would probably just skip making the weapons better, with the possible exception of the spear on occasional solo jaunts (read: agonizingly SLOW improvement), and just concentrate on casting.  Frankly, I don't think my groups at high levels will want me meleeing anyway, they'll want me medding and slowing, etc. -- casting.  If I were behind in 2h blunt I doubt I'd bother fixing that by soloing endlessly, same with 1h blunt.  And I think I would miss out on fun that way, and the full variety and power of being a shaman, and, until I got the hell kicked outta me by super-strong mobs for the incredibly long time it takes to maximize defense/AC once you've fallen behind, I'd probably be a real fraidy cat, and have pigeon-holed myself into a corner.  I'd be notably weaker, and my group would be at least a bit weaker, too, because of me.  That all sounds like it s*cks to me.<P>So I'm not saying there's only one way to do it or one level range to do it in, or that you should wear the same AC or have the same considerations solo as you do when grouped, or wear the same stuff when you're weak as you do when strong.  I wore a lot more casting gear when weaker, for instance, because I had no choice -- I NEEDED to dot and cast much more at first.  I'm not even saying everyone has adequate physical armor pieces to even try building up melee like I'm talking about doing.  I did an awful lot of trading and making SOW potions before I could buy my armor and weapons, sometimes barely fighting for days and days on end.  If you're not willing to do that, I can sure understand that.  Bored the daylights outta me.  I don't really like trading.  I like killing stuff.  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"> <P>I'm just saying that there are really great benefits if you keep up your melee aspects as much as you possibly can, and that the longer you have your melee capabilities maxed, the longer you'll benefit from it.  (Conversely, the longer you wait, the more you'll be doing without.  Eventually you might be doing without permanently, on the weapons at least.)  I'm saying it's much harder to do practice melee at later levels, and much more dangerous, and the price for failure is FAR greater.  (My 54 druid knows something about dying in the 50's.)  I'm also saying you'll suffer more from not having those aspects of your character maxed at later levels than you will at lower levels, because life is tougher then, and mobs and situations less forgiving.<P>Therefore, catch-up, even when successful, is not really a great way to do it.  Doing it late is the hardest way to do it at the most dangerous time.  If you try, you probably won't try to do it with every weapon class, and will just forever abandon some.  Then when something great pops in your lap, there's every chance your average shaman will say it sucks if it's not a spear, and even encourage other shamans to feel the same way.  <P>I think this is probably the way most shamans go.  And I don't think it's a great way.  I think shamans can be tougher than some of the shamans I bump into are, and that it helps when you are.  I also think it's just plain old more fun to have as many options as possible.  If you have a choice between more options and fewer options, I can't see why fewer options is the way to go.<P>I could if melee really didn't work past 20, or 30, or 40 -- all of which I've heard shamans say!  And not just once.  I could justify abandoning options if 2h blunts really DID stink, and so did 1h blunts.  My own personal experience is that they do indeed stink -- if they're nowhere near their max for your level.  If they ARE good and high, then they don't stink at all.  So the options many (most? I don't know) shamans deny themselves seem good ones, and I wanted to say how good they've proven for me so far.<P>And even if you hate doing anything but casting and disagree with everything I've said, you just can't deny the value of 50 extra AC.  I made that for myself for free, just by meleeing.  I think it was a great choice.  I could have actually gotten that natural AC much earlier if I had learned the importance of melee earlier; I wish I had.<P>I never said it was always the most fun way to go, or that it was a very fast way to level.  <P>But as it is, I am going to go into my later levels in the best possible situation -- as tough as possible, with every one of my options fully open -- both for simple survival, and for fun.  I think that's worth a lot, and beats all the alternatives by a mile.

Somadjinn, you're right in pointing out about mana regen being different from absolute mana total, of course.  No matter what your mana level, if you cast a spell, it takes the same amount of time to med the mana back. Slamdunkjam, if I cast three spells that cost me 500 mana, say, and I have twice the wisdom of somebody else, we both med/canni the mana back in the same time.  It's just that I can do twice what he can only do once; that has no effect on how fast I get the mana back for any spell I actually cast, though.<P>Somadjinn, I've spoken to some post-50's shamans who tell me they melee a lot post-50.  I'm sure they can't do it on many mobs, and can do it on many others.  At least, that's what they've told me.  You do say that shamans can't solo efficiently until 49, then say they can't melee after 50.  That doesn't match what I've experienced before 49, or what some shamans I know have experienced after 50.  <P>Shamy, you're my melee hero.   <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">  I'd love to be able to melee stuff at your level!  There's no kind of option I don't like, and anyway it sounds like seriously fun butt-kicking, and something to look forward to. <P>I think a high level like you still working up melee skills is definitely doing it the hardest way, though, and having a fungi tunic, epic spear, and the kind of gear a level 60 has, sure must help.  Having gone through it myself, I'm glad I just got most of it over with when it was easier and took less gear, less danger, and less overall power.  I think most people will find that the earlier they start, the better -- and the earlier the pay-off, the long they have to enjoy it.

Right, Blarg, I see what your saying.  The key in your scenario is that you have twice the wisdom.  Last nite in LoIO, I took on a sabertooth that conned formidable blue to me.  I was able to take him out with a combo of nukes, dots and melee.  While I was on my way to the windmill to med, I came across a high blue skelly.  In the past I wouldn't have taken him on.  But, my health was high from the last battle and still had over 50% mana left so I took him on and killed it.  I never would have been able to do that with my previous character.  The key was wisdom.....I was up and active instead of regening/canning cause my 139 wis permitted me to.  It didn't hurt, of course, to have a 15 ac shield and jaundiced boned and totemic armor also.

Since level 40, I've had no melee weapons whatsoever (finally gave up my bf hammer lol), just my paw of opolla and testament of vanear (which I destroyed 2 days ago :eek <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">, and I've maxed my defense a VERY long time ago, and why?  Because slows almost instantaneuously cause aggro as a good shaman will try to cast it on the mobs asap (considering they're not too mr which is the case in the typical situation, but in any case, u could always malosi/malosini which causes practically no aggro and then slow), your defense will AUTOMATICALLY go up, and for a shaman, I'd say the most crucial skill needed is defense, and no melee weapons whatsoever are needed to raise it.  <BR>I've been thinking about it, and some offensive skillz can prove to be useful in some cases, not because of the pure dmg output, but because of procs, I regret that my piercing is still relatively low (60ish) because I hardly ever get the chance to land a stun with my howling harpoon, but it's just a matter of pure laziness too, catching up is the same as building your skill progressively, except that you'll have so many pts to catch all at once, but that's ok, as long as the mob is blue con and above, u can still get improvements, and at level 57 I've seen from the times I've tried gettings imps is not slow, I just get discouraged of having to catch up 140 points one day, and generally stop.<BR>I'll digress a little and explain as to why shamans can be cool and just sponge up the exp sometimes, of course, this is just my theory, but that's what I have been applying in most cases.  A shaman is basically made to slow (and maybe debuff their mr if the situation so calls for a malosi), any buffs they want, they ask for, and don't expect me to guess what stats of theirs are maxed.  On normal pulls with clarity II, I almost always have fm after the fight is over because all I do really is slow at the beginning of a fight, stay up for a while and just cannibalize for mana because I know if I sit down the mob will jump on me instaneously, and after tanks have taunted the mob sufficiently, I just sit down, and so on and so forth with next pulls, but when the tank pulls a nasty train, who do you think is gunna help keeping the group alive when I'm at full mana to start with?  I'll have sufficient enough mana to slow 6 of them and throw in a few chloroblasts to help the cleric out in the beginning where u have the most chances of dying.  That's my philosophy on how shamans should play, everyone in their grp is assigned one specific task or 2, and if everyone gets their **** together, there's no need for the shaman to waste extra mana healing/dotting/nuking, I follow the better to be safe than sorry principle, that is letting the tanks simply melee the mob when there's a single/double pull, and when worst comes to worst, I know the grp can rely on me to have enough mana to deal with 6+ slows in one sweep.  In the case of single/double pulls, that's when I could start practicing my offensive skills because I normally regen my mana to full before they even get the mob to half, but I'm just lazy, and sometimes just sit down or just chain JBB :-)<P>--------------------<P>Nektar Nefaste, 59 shaman

Thanks for the great replies, guys.<P>I know you guys can work up defense without going the solo/heavy melee route, but getting hit a few times per mob when grouped doesn't seem to add up to the kind of volume of hits you sustain when you're soloing something and meleeing it, even if your group pulls quickly.  When I melee/solo, my fights last a couple of minutes, and I get hit sometimes many dozens of times every fight.  Even doing it that way, I often found it hard to catch up on defense, going for hours and hours without a single point increase.  I think grouping a lot will level you faster, but you won't be able to put on defense as fast as someone doing the melee/solo thing.  It just takes too long to get skill increases.  I don't need a mob hitting my tanks, I need to be the tank!  Now that I've maxed out defense/offense, though, I don't have to care any more, really.  My weapons I can max pretty much when I feel like it, I figure; they're behind, but not much now.  I AM glad I got the extra AC now rather than later though.  I never got hit enough in groups to come close to maxing out defense, offense, or weapons per level.<P>One nice thing about weapons skills being high, also, is that I land so often I proc very frequently.  I've often proc'd four Blight Hammer 533 dots in a battle, or four DD's from my drakkell icegrinder, or even six stuns from my howling harpoon.  Wonder how many times I could stun with the 6/23 mortificator spear -- that guy is darn fast.  Probably won't save anyone's life in a group if I'm doing it, but it's very nice to get maximum value from the melee I do contribute.<BR>___________________<BR>Chain JBB sure sounds great.  Only seen one JBB being sold ever, though, in the year and a half I've been playing.  Lotta people seem to have them, but I hear the drop rate has been nerfed.  <IMG SRC="frown.gif" border="0"> Ack, if it's even worse than it has been, I can't imagine how I'm ever gonna get one.  They're just not sold on Drinal, my server, it seems.  <IMG SRC="frown.gif" border="0">  If I get one at all, I'll probably be very, very high level by then.<P>Maybe I should just save up for a strathbone shield instead.  Only seen one of those sold, too, though.  <P>Hell, maybe I'll blow my money on alchemy and stop thinking about it heheh.

Bah you kids these days have it easy.. when i was a youngen I didnt know when my DoT's wore off because I didnt get a message saying 'your sicken spell has worn off' or nothin like that, and thats the way it was and we liked it.  I did actually kite using nukes at 14-19 in EK because of this lack of knowledge.  And we didnt have these new fangled zones in kunark to level up and oasis was much more crowded than it is now, but thats the way it was and we liked it.   At 19-24 we used to fight like mad over the aviak guard spawns in lake rathe and the hermit in SK and I still used nukes mostly and one dot because I didnt want to waste mana if i was cancelling out my dots and thats the way it was and we liked it you durn whippersnappers...  Back in my day, root used to drop sow and you could solo shaman orcs in everfrost and run away like a little girl if you started to lose, but we liked it.  After 9 you shouldnt have any troubles soloing most stuff until you get near 30, since you can always run away faster than the mobs.. dem durn druids didnt get no sow until 14 ha ha ha.  I didnt even use my slow spells until I got my wolf pet because I didnt realize how durn nifty they were, I probably could have leveled a lot faster if I had used drowsy and all dem spells.  And yes, you can solo ok after 50, I went from 51 to 52 in a couple of days killing dem blasted ice giants in everfrost and made a tidy profit too, just slowed it and ebolted it and meleed with pet until i went down some then rooted it with pet on it and backed off and watched pet until it was about half and called it off to superregen (chloro+ pet regen rocks, regrowth rocks harder) until root broke and let pet engage until i got root back up.. if i only had one giant spawn i'd use 2 or 3 ebolts, the 51 damage pets worked and lived the longest, if you dont have one or a 49 pt pet then get one when you have the mana.  I did get 1hb up a ways because der werent no durn cool spears for us that i could get before i was in 40's and when spear of fate came out and all dem new nice piercers I went and put 85 skill points into piercing and raised it up a bit more since then... us shaman dont get many spells to put pts into, i have also put in 20 pts or so into several trade skills and I still have 50 extra pts at 52.. sigh  anyway all dem new user interface features and dem kunark zones shure make it easy for you youngens.. but thats the way it was and we liked it.<P>Petey

Not too long ago, snare wouldn't stack with root, that's the way it was and we liked it.  Not too long ago, u wouldn't be told how much dmg u took when dded, that's the way it was and we liked it.  Not too long ago, we had to buy our food and supplies one by one, that's the way it was and we liked it.  Not too long ago, dr00d tracking was capped at 50, that's the way it was and we liked it.  Not too long ago, rangers got sow at 39, that's the way it was and we liked it.  <BR>Starting to see my point?  At all times, you'll have disadvantages in the game, but we decide to play eq nonetheless because it's interactive, and ever since it came out, what kept people playing was Verant's willingness to evolve, change, and adds to its features.<P>--------------------<P>Nektar Nefaste, 59 shaman
