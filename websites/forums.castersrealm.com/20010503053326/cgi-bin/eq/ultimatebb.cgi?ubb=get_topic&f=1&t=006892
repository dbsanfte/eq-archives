Welcome all to an extra Special relase of Twilight! In this release you are getting the exciting chapter 7, which will answer many of the mysteries of the Twilight and add about 3 times as many more for you to solve(hehe I am the evil one). You are also getting the first character bios.<P>What also makes this release special, is something totally new. Some people have said. "Razy, your a pretty good writer. Why not try something not related to EQ?"<P>Well, I thought about it, and I am going to give it a shot. So over the next 3 releases you are going to get a  totally new series each release. In this week you are getting AD.Police. Next week it will be War, and the last week it will be Neo-Earth. Tell me what you thought and if you would like to see more. So with at further chatter, here it is!<BR>-----------------------------<P><marquee>*(A Thesis of The Cruel Angel), Like an angel that has no sense of mercy..., Rise, young child, to the heavens like a legend... Cold winds, as blue as the sea.Tear open the door to your heart, I see... But unknowing you seem, just staring at me... Standing there smiling serenely. Desperate, for something to touch... A moment of kindness like that in a dream... Your innocent eyes, have yet no idea... Of the path your destiny will follow... But someday you'll become aware of... Everything that you've got behind you...Your wings are for seeking out a new... Future that only you can search for. The cruel angel's thesis bleeds through a portal like your pulsing blood. If you should betray the chapel of your memories, Cruel angel's thesis enters.....through the window of your soul So, child, stand tall and embrace the fire of the legend. Embracing the universe like a blazing star!</marquee><P>---------------------------------<BR>Chapter 7 Nagi Strikes!<BR>--------------------------------<P>"You would dare to defy me?"<BR>-------------------------------------<BR>"I am the master of all! N one can stop me! Not the others! Not the Nameless! No one!!!!"<BR>-------------------------------------<BR>"O...Yes... harder....Yes..that feels so good…."<BR>-------------------------------------<BR>"We will return! And when we come back , the Twilight will fall upon you!"<BR>--------------------------------------<BR>"Now, you shall serve me as one of my own.<BR>--------------------------------------<BR>Memories, thousands of memories and images flooded his mind. driving him insane...then they were gone, all the memories of the past gone……. except for one...<P>Leylia.<BR>---------------------------------------<P><BR>"No! Leylia are you all right!"<P>"Re….re.as…" Leylia began to cough violently, spitting up some blood. Scooping her up into his arms, he started to clean her wounds.<P>"Hold on Leylia, you’ll be fine."<P>"St..op Silver mas…….." Her words drifted away as she faded into unconsciousness.<P>"LEYLIA!! WAKE UP! Don’t Leave me! Please don’t leave me. I..I.." For the first time that he could remember, he was sad. He was crying, <P>/\Why does she matter so  much? She was just someone I am bonded too, like Raziel. But then why am I crying for her? Could I..am I?/\<P>"Please don’t die Leylia….I"<P>A metal boot plod against the marble floor behind him, followed by the chink of armor shifting around. Light began shine from behind him. Reyas gently lay Leylia’s unconscious form on the ground and turned to face the newcomer.<P>The light from the blaze outside Qeynos castle, glinted brightly of his silver armor. The light reflecting of his mask was almost blinding. <P>"You again. You did this! You hurt her!"<P>"And so what if I did? A servant like you can do nothing to stop Veeshan."<P>"I serve no one!"<P>"The pendant around the Dragoon’s neck proves other wise. As long as she bears it, you shall always be a slave and you shall never see the truth."<P>"SHUT UP! I live my life as I choose!"<P>"Such brave words for one who cries over the body of his master."<P>"I SAID SHUT UP!"<P>(*Duel of Fates: Star Wars: The Phantom Menace Sound Track)<P>Flexing his hand briefly, a broadsword of mana forms, further illuminating the hall. Silver Mask extended his arm and a long sword materialized in his hand. Gripping it with two hands, he locked a cool gaze on Reyas and waited.<BR>-------------------------------------<BR>"O..Reyas…Thank you..That felt so good….It was just what I needed<BR>--------------------------------------<BR>"Now, you shall serve me as one of my own."<BR>--------------------------------------<BR>"Now, you shall serve me as one of my own." 	<BR>--------------------------------------<BR>"Now, you shall serve me as one of my own." <BR>--------------------------------------<BR>"Now, you shall serve me as one of my own."<BR>---------------------------------<BR>Memories, hidden came back like a storm in his mind and again he felt himself losing control as power and anger swelled inside of him.<P>--------------------------------------<BR>"Now, you shall serve me as one of my own."<BR>--------------------------------------<BR>"Now, you shall serve me as one of my own."<BR>--------------------------------------<P>"I SERVE NO ONE!"<P>His body once again began radiate with power, and he leapt for Silver Mask. Their blades met again and again, showering the hall with sparks and flashes of light. Reyas swung high and low at Silver Mask, and each swing was countered.<P>"GRAVITY SLASH!"<P>The broad sword pulsed brightly and the marble and stone around them ripped apart and burst. Silver Mask hopped backward out of the attack’s range and landed on the crater edge, resuming his pose and locking the cool glare upon Reyas.<P>Reyas assumed a defensive stance and wait for Silver Mask to make the next move.<P>Silver mask raised his sword above his head, letting energy swell above it.<P>/\ That Technique! That’s the…/\<P>Silver Mask crashed the blade to the ground and wave ripped through the earth. Reyas acting quickly mimicked the move canceling Silver Mask’s attack.<P>"How do you…"<P>The sounds of another person entering the hall reach Reyas, he turns to identify the newcomer. A woman standing tall, wounded heavily wielding a long sword. She steps forward toward Reyas, she is wearing a white mask, badly cracked and the right half is missing revealing part of the bloody face of a High Elf. <P>"No one can defeat Nagi!"<P>With out another word she charged a  somewhat stunned Reyas. Her sword easily pierced his side, and then a bolt of mana slammed into his stomach catapulting him into the wall..<P>Nagi began to approach him but slowly began to weaken, then she drop her blade, then collapsed to the floor.<BR>(*End Track)<BR>Silver Mask approached her and picked up Nagi into his arms and held her for a moment. Then hoisted her above his head.<P>"Return to Veeshan. Your work is done her for now."<P>Nagi began to shimmer slightly, then in an instant she vanished. Silver Mask turned back to Reyas who was still lodged in the hole in the wall. He raised his hand and mana began flow to it.<P>"We will finish this another time. Servant."<P>A beam shot out encompassing Reyas, pain wracked through him as he felt himself dissolving into nothingness.<BR>----------------------------------------<P><BR> The sun was shining brightly through the window when Leylia woke up. She found her chest and right arm bandaged, when she tried to stand. Her gasps of pain, signaled a cleric who had been sitting outside her room.<P>"Now, Now. You must stay and rest child. You  took quite a beating yesterday. You aren’t well enough to be moving around."<P>"But I."<P>"Sssh. Rest child."<P>The cleric began to chant quietly and a bluish hue hovered over Leylia. She suddenly felt cool, as the magic passed over and through her. The pain began to subside a bit.<P>"What happened?"<P>"Thanks to you and your friends, the Freeport Militia was beaten back. I’m not really sure why they attacked us, but my guess is it had something to do with that weird claw symbol on their armor. You know it is truly a blessing of Nife, that your and your friends were able to do so much. In all my days I had never seen such power before.<P>"Where…. are they?"<P>"Your friends?"<P>"Yes."<P>"Your silver haired companion is out somewhere cooling off. He was in quite a fury after the attack. He was lashing out at anything and everything he could get his hands on. He seems to care a lot about you, it tore him apart knowing tat you got hurt and so badly on top of that. As for young Tenrou, I’m afraid he hasn’t been seen since the end of the attack. But that is enough talk for now, sleep child."<BR>-----------------------------------------<BR>(*Death and Rebirth-The Longest Journey Sound Track)<P>"You’re hurt."<P>"I’ll be fine."<P>"What was all that noise outside?"<P>" Just a few invaders, nothing for you to worry about mother. They are all gone."<P>"That’s good…..Tenrou are you crying?"<P>" I can’t stand this….To see you here lain on this bed…To know that I failed you…"<P>"Come here Tenrou..Come to me"<P>Tenrou moves from where he is standing in the dark room and sits down on the bed. Beside his mother, a young dark elf woman, made old by disease and suffering.<P>"Tenrou, you haven’t failed me and you never will. I can see in your eyes the power and destiny that lies within, no Tenrou you have not failed me"<P>"But if only, I had been a little faster..I could have gotten the herbs from Neriak, and you would be all better."<P>"Even if you had gotten them, they would have prolong the inevitable. The plague that destroys me now, has been eating me since I was born. There was nothing you or any one could do."<P>"But I could.."<P>"No, you couldn’t"<P>"I hoped that maybe if, you got better. Father wouldn’t hate me so. Maybe he could be happy, once you were ok."<P>"You father does not hate you. He hurts like you do, even more so, by ho many folds I am not sure, but I know that he hurts. The Council of Qeynos is the ones that placed me out here and made the illusion ring. Not Jacin. Forgive him Tenrou, he is hurt on all sides, by the ones he loves and the ones he serves. Promise me you will forgive him, doesn’t have to be now or in a year. Just forgive him. Promise me."<P>"I promise mother….Mother?…No…..no.....….Rest well mother...."<P>(End Track)<BR>------------------------------------<P>Waves splash violently against the rock face as stones and gravel fell from the ledge. Reyas’s fists smash into the earth again and again splintering pieces of the ledge and sending them to the ocean below.<P>"Damn it all to hell!"<P>/\I’m supposed to be her protector, her guardian. But I couldn’t..Now she’s hurt. Why couldn’t I save her. Why couldn’t I do what  I promised?/\<P>"DAMN IT!"<P>Lashing out he punches a nearby boulder, shattering it. As it breaks apart memories leap through his mind.<P>---------------------------------<BR>"So big bad Re-Re is all tired out? Ahh soo soon?"<BR>----------------------------------<BR>"Stop that! That doesn’t go in there!"<BR> -----------------------------------<BR>"Are you really going to go against her?"<BR>------------------------------------<BR>"Go down to where you so with to protect! Begone!<BR>------------------------------------<BR>....N’on!!!!<BR>-------------------------------------<P>"N’on .....Traica...I know you..You.."<P>His train of thought fades as the memory does suddenly. At that moment, he feels drained, as if all his strength had been sucked out of him. He collapses to the ground and blacks out.<BR>-------------------------------------<P><BR>"Why is your pendant flashing?"<P>"Reyas  must have cooled off. Can you pass it too me please?"<P>"Certainly."<P>As the cleric places the  pendant in Leylia’s hand, Leylia notices something. <P><BR>"Hey..The crack is gone."<BR>-------------------------------<BR>End of This Chapter!<BR>-------------------------------<P><BR>--------------------------------<BR>Preview of Chapter 8 (Spoiler Alert!)<BR>---------------------------------<P>	Rested and recovered from the defense of Qeynos and they’re own personal ordeals. The trio receives permission from the Qeynos Council to go to the sealed continent of Odus. In appreciation of their help in saving Qeynos, the Council authorizes the use of the best ship in the fleet. And they are going to need it, for something dark awaits them on Odus. Find out what and more as the mysteries of the Twilight are revealed in the next exciting chapter: Gunboat Diplomat!<P>---------------------------<BR>The Shadow Falls Character Bios<BR>---------------------------------------<P>Raziel Darkborne<BR>Race: Erudite/Dark Elf<BR>Age: 25<BR>Profession: Hell Lord<BR>Whereabouts: Unknown<P>Raziel is considered by many one of the most powerful people ever to walk on Norrath.  As Paineel’s Hell lord he slew Malik his predecessor and walked, the crimson hell fires of Fear itself. His innate ability to drain the soul of his fallen adversaries intensifies his natural skills.<P>However, even with all this shroud of darkness covering him, Raziel is incredibly playful and has a strong sense of justice. Raziel was also defiant against authority, especially in his choice of mate, Arorua a high elf Grail Lord, his natural enemy. He won her heart by sowing her his true self, a joker at times. Making light of many of her various aspects and such. He was also a romantic.  Letting her see what he is really like under the dark armor.<P>Unfortunately, it was this very passion which drove him insane. Her murder, right in front of him, caused him to lose all control of his anger and power. Moreover, in a rage he flattened the city of Erudin, stormed the Plane of Fear, faced the Ring of Scale, and even aced the crystalline dragon Veeshan herself. Whether he was able to exact his revenge for Arorua’s murder is unknown, like his current whereabouts.<P>Arorua Kaya Darkborne<BR>Race: High Elf<BR>Age: 64<BR>Profession: Grail Lord<BR>Whereabouts: Deceased<P>Arorua is a young High elf, thrust into a midst of adventure and peril. After witnessing the brutal murder of her best friends, she was saved by Raziel. After that, they became fast friends, and trough a tangle of adventures fell in love. This love was tested and strengthened, when the dark creature known only as the Dread King awakened and began to ravage Faydwer with the undead. During the ensuing battle to destroy the Dread King, Karasir, the preceding Grail Lord was slain, and Arorua took his place. Using her natural powers and the protection of Raziel, Arorua destroyed the Dread King, saving Faydwer. <P>After this incident Raziel and Arorua married. Their honeymoon was interrupted by the interference of a cacodemon named Mathasaar, who captured Arorua. Forcing Raziel to reveal his true identity has a Hell Lord. <P>Their love tested once again, and held, they rejoin in Paineel, and Arorua was soon gave birth to a daughter Leylia. At Leylia’s naming ceremony, the people of Erudin attacked and in the ensuing melee, Arorua was murdered in front of Raziel. Ensuing his insanity and rampage across Norrath and the Alter Planes.<P>Reyas<BR>Race: Familiar<BR>Age: Unknown<BR>Profession: Familiar<BR>Whereabouts: Qeynos<P>Reyas is a familiar. A guardian spirit bestowed unto mortals who are deemed worthy to possesses one. Reyas was first bonded to Raziel by Cazic-Thule for obtaining the rank of Hell Knight. During that time, he assumed the form of a raven. He became a fast friend with Raziel. And was a perfect compliment to Raziel’s light-heartedness and his chasing of women. <P>After the death of Arorua, Raziel in his last bit of sanity, bonded Reyas to his daughter Leylia to protect her and eventually lead her home to Paineel.. Now that Leylia is 18 and ready to undertake the journey, he is fulfilling his promise. But now he is beginning to see Leylia in a new light. This revelation was further amplified during the recent attack on Qeynos.<P>Leylia Darkborne<BR>Age: 18<BR>Race: Erudite/High Elf<BR>Profession: Ranger<BR>Whereabouts: Qeynos<P><BR>Leylia the daughter of Raziel and Arorua. Is shrouded under the mystery of the tale of the Twilight. It is driving her from one continent to another, with the minions of Veeshan always right behind her. Leylia does not really understand why Veeshan is commiting so much to killing her or as to why Veeshan has smashed almost every city between Kelethin and Qeynos. She only knows that she must go home, and find out her past. And what is this mysterious power inside her, that can scare a god.<P><BR>Tenrou U’gets<BR>Age: 18<BR>Race: Dark Elf/Human<BR>Profession: Rogue<BR>Whereabouts: Qeynos<P><BR>Tenrou is a tormented by his mixed heritage. Hated by his own father and the people he works for, the only way he can make then except him is by working against his mother’s people, the Tier’dal. He is further devestated by his mother’s illness and his inability to help her. This torment is what drives him to the bed of any woman he can find, in desperation for comfort. This in turn causes more trouble, as it did in HighPass Hold, in which a bounty was placed on his head for his actions. Tenrou seeks an answer to his torment, and possibly by joining Reyas and Leylia he can find an answer to his troubled soul.

And here is the first of Three totatlly unreated to EQ story series. AD. Police.<BR>------------------------<P>"Thousands of people are filling the streets, destroying everything in their path. For the fourth time since WWWIII the people and gangs of Neo-Angeles are in a riot. And this time they are in far more of an uprising then ever before! As you can see looters and vagabonds are destroying this street and everything on it..HEY! Get off the news van!! HEY You...! Put down the gun! Please ! No Don’t!!....."<BR>-----------------------------------------------<BR>"Jason, I don’t like this anymore then you do, but the press is in a feeding frenzy."<P>"I understand. I wish I didn’t have to do it, but I was out of options. At least this way she is alive to see her kids."<P>"I understand. But even so, they are still out for blood. Even with the acquittal they are still after your head. And most of the funding nations are pulling out because of this."<P>"I know, which is why I am giving you this."<P>A small clipboard landed on the desk, with a single sheet of paper on it.<P>"You’re resigning?"<P>"Yes. At least this way Rainbow can keep functioning."<P>"I don’t see how. It’s no bull when I say you are the best Jason."<P>"Thank you sir."<P>"No need for that sir stuff. What will you do now?"<P>"I’ll try to see if I can get my old position at M-Tech. They always said they will have a space waiting for me."<P>The auto-reader on the desk begins to whine, and a small sheet of paper spits out. The General takes it and reads it.<P>"Maybe not. This is for you"<P>Jason takes up the small sheet and is silent as he reads it.<P>"Is this for real?"<BR>---------------------------------------------<P>"What in the hell is going on!?!"<P>"Pipe down Bobby.’"<P>"Why wasn’t I informed of the emergency session."<P>"Because we know you Bobby. You would have held up the whole process. It’s taken us a long time to get this far. And we are not going to let your speeches halt us."<P>"But thats... that"<P>"Not right or legal. We know, but at this point it doesn't really matter. We already had 2/3 majority. There was no need of delaying it with your and others disagreements."<P>"So what is it?"<P>"This"<P>The Senator passed him a small brief. Senator Robert was stunned as he read it.<P>"This ... this can’t be. It’s unconstitutional. It’s It’s.."<P>"Already done."<BR>-------------------------------------<P><BR>*(Searching for Love: Trap Gunner Sound Track)<P>	It is the year 2040. The world has survived the third world war and a depression. In the years following the war, decadence and decay thrives especially in the Neo cities. Cities designed to be the last bastions of humanity. Of all the Neo-cities, the worst is Neo-Angles. Murder, crime and terrorist action occur on an hourly basis.<P>	On July 5, the United States passed the Harriman act. The Harriman act suspends the Constitutional rights and prohibitions that are the building blocks of the U.S. The Harriman act was not a sweeping elimination; it just suspended them whenever a special organization went into action. This organization is the Advanced Special Tactics And Rescue Service or AD.S.T.A.R.S. To the terrorists they are to be feared, to the people of Neo-Angles they are the first, last and only line of defense against the scum of the Earth. They are the<P><BR>					AD.

Just Jason"<P>"Yes, Jason. I am Lieutenant Commander De'Silva and this Commander Colby"<P>"Glad to meet you. So I take it this isn't a joke?"<P>"No it is not. The situation here is very serious. The last riot are what sparked the Harriman act and the Senate to move so quickly."<P>"Something this big, would be headline news. Why is it so unnoticed?"<P>"As you know, the acts passed by the senate are public knowledge. So they hid it inside some junk laws and worded in such away that only some one scrutinizing it would under stand. By then the ADSTARS will be in full swing."<P>"Do any of the regular police agencies aware of our operations?"<P>"They will be today. The  Neo-Angles Police Commissioner and the director of the regional OSS are aware but are under hush orders until we are fully under way."<P>"Amazing, absolutely amazing"<P>"Yes, it is"<P>"Where is the HQ?"<P>"In the central district. The bullet tube can take us there directly."<BR>------------------<P>The three exit the bullet tube and enter on a dimly lit rolling road. Ahead of them is a slightly deshelved building reaching 60 floors into the sky.<P>"This is HQ?"<P>"Yes sir. A lot of the equipment and aesthetics haven't arrived yet. We were pulled together rather quickly."<P>"How many are on the force at the moment?"<P>"Including us?"<P>"Yes."<P>"4. Us and M-Tech liaison to work on the Judge system."<P>"Oy! Aren’t we supposed make the first patrol today?"<P>"Yes sir."<P>"oy…When can we accept the rest of the force?"<P>"Tuesday."<P>"Tuesday.. What about equipment?"<P>"At the moment we have 4 pulse rifles, 2 force-amp pistols and 1 hard suit."<P>"This is terrible…did you say force-amp pistols?"<P>"Yes."<P>"They legalized those?"<P>"Just for us."<P>"Well that's something. What power?"<P>" 1.3 times multiplier pistols"<P>"I take that back. 1.3 times power? Why not just let us go patrolling with baseball bats?"<P>" We do have a few of those."<P>"Smart-ass"<P>"You better believe it"<P>"When are the rest of the arms coming?"<P>"Tuesday"<P>"I'm afraid to ask, what about vehicles?"<P>"One monobike."<P>"We were more organized at kindergarten, let me guess Tuesday?"<P>"No sir. Wednesday"<P>"Is it to late to reject this position?"<P>"Yep."<BR>----------------------------------<P>They enter the building and survey the shambled insides. Remains of the previous owners still scattered about. As they continue on through the building they come to the center of the HQ. In the center is a new room, obviously just installed. The walls of the room where a of a enhanced plexi-glass, bomb ,ballistic and acid proof. It is needed to protect the heart of the ADSTARS. The Mk.1 AI tactical computer, codename Judge.<P>	The M-Tech Liaison dressed in gray overalls wheels himself from underneath the computer, just as the over-pressure doors wump open. As he greets the three, Jason wanders over and begins to inspect the system. Noticing something he questions the Liaison<P>"What’s it been clocked at?"<P>"766 Teraflops."<P>"Impressive. Is it using the new regressive protocols?"<P>"Yes and it’s also been uplinked with a New AI system which…"<P>After this the conversation drifts away from normal English to the babble of higher mathematics, puzzling De’Silva and Colby. A few moments pass by and the conversation returns to English.<P>"Is Judge ready for operation? Or do we have to wait till Tuesday like everything else?"<P>"No sir. She is ready to run. Just need to input your access codes and retina patterns."<P>"Let’s get to it then."<P>"Just lean forward into the terminal and state your ID number."<P>The terminal on the massive computer lights up and begins to whir as Jason leans in to it.<P>"0000001"<P><BR>A small beam walks across his face, scanning the unique patterns of his retinas. The terminal dies out and the massive computer comes to life. A display appears in mid air as Judge boots up.<P><BR>Primary Boot Drive….Online<BR>Second and Third Tier Back ups…Online<BR>Ping Monitor Relay System……Online<BR>Ram Sys check………..complete<P>AI loading in progress………..Complete<P><BR>JUDGE.

How are your tracking systems at the moment are you read for your first day of work?"<P>"My systems are at 100%. I am currently on standby until a ADSTARS element is deployed"<P>And the wireframe vanishes into the nothingness from whence it came.<P>"Well then time to roll."<P>"Sir?"<BR>-----------------------------------------<P>"Sir..er Jason You’re the Chief. We can’t have you going out on patrols."<P>"lets get one thing straight. All ADSTARS will go on patrols. I will not have a desk jockey on my force."<P>"But who will do all the paper work?"<P>"Exactly.."<P>"The Triumvirate is not going to pleased."<P>"Your point?" Power on"<P>The Hard suit turns on noiselessly. He flexes a bit, letting the suit adjust to him. In a moment he gives the back jets a bit of juice, lifting him a few inches of the ground.<P>De’silva places the helmet on Jason, making sure it snaps shut.. Then she turns to a com panel behind her.<P>"Judge Unlock and load Monobike 01 to the front bay."<P>A panel opens next to the launching platform, a monobike being held upright by clamps appears out of it. The monobike then turns 90 degrees making it level for riding. Making a quick hop over the clamps, Jason straddles the bike and guns the engine, roaring to cycle to operation. The clamps swing the bike away from the platform and to the exit ramp.<P>Squeezing the throttle, the bike revs up as the gate clinks open letting sunlight poor inside.<BR>/Ready for Launch?/<P>"Hit it!"<P>The clamps break away with a shower of sparks and the monobike falls a few feet  to hit the ramp at high speed, shooting up a small corridor and launching out into the street.<BR>---------------------------------<P><BR>Hundreds of bullets enter the street carving through buildings and cars. Forcing everyone in the vicinity to duck for cover.<P>"EAT IT! We aren’t giving up one until you send us what we demand!"<P>"We can’t do that! We don’t have that kind of authority! And your not helping the situation by opening fire on us. If you shoot again we will send in forces!"<P>"SHOVE IT!"<P>More bullets leap  out of the besieged building, striking several officers. From behind an armored car being turned into Swiss cheese. The ranking officer calls frantically for support.<P>"This is Unit 41-Adam at SolFaith bank on hundred and Pembroke. We need support down here now! We have a hostage situation and the hostiles are armed with illegal  force-amp rifles! We are getting chewed to pieces down here!"<P>"Unit 41-Adam, this is Commissioner Nakatomi. Hold on tight, a .."<P>The rest of the message is lost to the sound of bullets cutting through the air.<BR>---------------------------------<P>/Chief Micheals./<P>"Jason."<P>/Understood. Jason, a disturbance has been picked up at Hundred and Pembroke./<P>"What kind?"<P>/Hostage situation. Terrorists have seized the SolFaith Bank. They are demanding../<P>"Yadda. We don’t need to know the demands. How many are there?"<P>/Unknown at the moment. 1 is has been opening fire with a force-amp rifle. Estimated to be 15 power. 1 other has been spotted passing  munition to the one keeping the regular police force at bay./<P>"Ok. I am enroute now."<P>/Understood. Plotting fastest available route........route plotted./<P>A map of the city is displayed in side Jason’s helm, a small blue line indicates the route to the bank.<P>"Warning Sirens on"<P>/Unable to comply/<P>"Why?"<P>/Sirens have not been installed/<P>"Tuesday?’<P>/Correct/<P>"I am being to not like this job."<P>Jason throttles up and speeds to the bank, dodging around traffic at high speed. A few minutes later..<P>/Monobike 01 now in range for Ping Monitor operation./<P>"Commence"<P>/Commencing.......Initial data received. There are 6 terrorists. All armed with M-Tech 15 Power Force-Amp Pulse Rifles./<P>"Display the layout of the building and the location of the HT’s"<P>The route map fades away and a map of the SolFaith building replaces it. Then 6 red dots appear on the layout.<P>/Extrapolating Physical data on ADSTAR 000001..Physical data received...plotting entry path for maximum effiency and stealth.../<P>"Belay that."<P>/Plotting halted. Why have you halted the plotting?/<P>"Lets do this my way, lets show the world what we can do. Replot a dynamic entry through the front."<P>/A dynamic entry will reduce safety by 35.329 percent/<P>"Understood. Plot it."<P>/Already done./<P>"Really?"<P>/The dynamic entry as soon as the Ping Monitor data came in./<P>"Why?"<P>/Your datafile indicates a tendency toward speedy and reckless solutions. It is why you are so highly rated./<P>"I’m flattered."<P>/Displaying operation path with current Ping data./<BR>-------------------------------------<P><BR>"Jesus, Mary and Joesph! Where is that back-up! I have 4 men bleeding out here!"<P>"the...sp.. .. o..way.."<P>"Christ, what a perfect time for the radio to go out."<P>"Hey Mickey! What is that?"<P>"What?"<P>"Over there, coming this way!"<P>Off in the distance, the two officers see a black and red monobike approaching at high speed. On the front they can make out in white letters A.D.<P>"It’s some crazy rider punk. He’s going to get himself killed!"<P>From inside the helmet, Jason sees two officers waving at him, motioning him to turn around. But he does the opposite and speeds up.<P>"Holy !! He’s going to ram us!"<P>The officers start to move as the roar of the monobike gets louder and then as they jump out of the way, they here it cry as go airborne, leaping off the car they had been using a shield.<P>In the few seconds the bike was airborne, Jason pushed off it and grasped his pistol. As they both began to come down, he gave the back jets a little juice slowing his descent to just behind the bike.<P>The 6 terrorist inside jump in surprise as the glass of the front of the building shattered and a bike came through landing on one of them. Killing him instantly.<P>The hostages screamed as bullets splattered two of the terrorist’s heads across the room. An armored figure seemed to fly through the air, as he entered the building. He spun around planting a powered round kick to a nearby terrorist in the gut. The figure then smashed an elbow to the back of the terrorist head.<P>The last Terrorist watched in shock as the armored figure punched his comrade in the face with a force greater then that of a bullet. He didn’t even have enough time to let it sink in as a bullet  ripped though his chest, the searing pain would have made him cry out ,but he never felt it when his head shattered like a water balloon.<P>From jump to final shot, only 6 seconds had passed. Not that it mattered to the hostages. Some were still in shock, others were trying to cover their need for new under wear, and a few more were dashing out of the building to the arms of loved ones.<P>/Performance analysis complete. You performed to 98% of projected operation. Since when do you punch and kick Hostage-Takers?/<P>"Since now."<P>Underneath the hard suit, Jason felt a tap on his right shoulder. As he turned he retracted the face shield. He turned to an elderly woman, looking to be about 70.<P>"I just wanted to say thank you for saving us."<P>"No need. Just know that you will be seeing more of me and others as long as the city needs cleansing."<P>"You’re not with the police?"<P>"Not really."<P>Reaching to the fallen monobike he pulls out a small shield-shaped pin.<P>"Take this. It is beacon. Just press down hard on the shield and one of us will be there in a moment."<P>"Who are you?"<P>(*Searching for Love: Trap Gunner Sound Track)<P>"The AD. Police."<P>------------------------------<BR>End of this Patrol!<BR>------------------------------

And here is the first AD. Police Data File. <P><marquee><h1>Warning!!! Top Secret!!! Code Blue Eyes Only! </h1></marquee><BR>--------------------------------<P>AD. Police Data Files<BR>-----------------------------<P>Personal Files:<P>AD.S.T.A.R.S. Serial I.D: 0000001<P>Name: Jason Micheals<BR>Age: 23<BR>Birthdate: 10/31/2017<BR>Birthplace:Unknown<BR>Bloodtype:O-<BR>Rank: Chief<BR>Weekly Patrols Assigned: 9<BR>Patrols completed at time of record update: 11<P>Personal History:<P>	Jason Micheals past is shrouded in secrecy. All efforts by OSS to uncover details from birth to age 17 have failed. He mysteriously appeared as an Level Blue M-Tech computer tech during the first Neo-Angeles riot and then quickly migrated throug M-Tech’s ranks and joined their security force. During the second riots, he quit M-Tech for reasons unknown and vansih for several years. It is suspected that he was undergoing training and was hidden by his next employers. At 21 he reappered as the element leader of a special multi-national anti-terrorrist group known only as Rainbow.<P>	During his time as a Rainbow element leader, he succesfully lead his team through 34 terrorist incidents, with out the loss of one hostage or civilian. His outstanding record was only tarnished by one incident which turned out to be his last mission as a member of Rainbow. During a siege on a Prussian embassy, a Terrorist held a hostage at gunpoint and had no exposed body parts. In order to keep the element of suprise, Jason shot the hostage in the shoulder to cause the hostage to react violently and give a clear shot at the terrorist. The terrosrist was then killed with 2 rounds to the cerebrum and the hostage survived with a minor shoulder wound.<P>	Unfortunatly Press got wind that the injured hostage was shot by Anti-terrorist forces and went in a frenzy. Jason was acquited of any charges of misconduct, becuase it was the only available solution, but the damage had already been done. Civilian and goverment support dwindled to even lower levels and Jason resigned honorably.<P>	It was at this time that he was selected by the Triumvirate to be the Chief of AD.S.T.A.R .S. Though knoen to be somewhat reckless and flipant against authority, Jason is a excellent tactition, cool under fire and one of the best Anti-Terrorist operatives in the world. He is also well-versed in M-Tech equipment, who are the major supplier of arms and data tracks for the opereation. Making him the only canidate for Chief of AD.S.T.A.R.S. <BR>AD.S.T.A.R.S Equipment and Weapons Listing:<P>Special Prototype Tatical Inteligence Processor Mk.1 <BR>CodeName: JUDGE<BR>Systems and Software Developer: M-Tech Systems<P>	The Judge system is a revolutionary piece of computer technology. It is a self programing system which can plot and calculate millions of variables to aid the AD.S.T.A.R.S elements end terrorist actions. The Judge computer in conjuction with the Ping Monitor can plot points of entry and attack ,tripling the effectiveness and effienctcy of the elements. Ensuring that hostages and civilians are saved and that Terrorists never have a chance.<P><BR>Ping Monitor<BR>Systems Devloper: M-Tech Systems<P>	The Ping Monitoer is a more advanced version of the electromagnetic heart monitors used by elite military units. Unlike the heart monitor which can only detect the pulses emitted by the human heart, the Ping monitor can detect the pulses emitted by the etire body. This also gives an interesting side-effect. Any metallic object near the subject also shows up, allowing AD.S.T.A.R.S. elements to know , which terrorist is armed with what type of weapon, how many rounds remaining, and relative direction and bearing. It allows allows them to detect any sleepers in the hostages.<P>Force-Amp Technology<BR>Developer: M-Tech Systems<P>	By using a weak electromagnetic field, the force being used to push a bullet out of a gun can be refocused on the exiting round. Increase the range,power and muzzle velocity of a round. The number of powers a force-amp has indicated how many times the exit force has been reapplied to the round. So, if 15 power force amp pistol, fired a 9mm parrabellum round, the exitting strength of the parrabellum would be several hundred times more destructive then a regular round.Because of the incredible strength this technology provides to arms, the United States banned the technology in U.S. territories. Unfortunatly M-Tech is a multi-national corporation and the U.S. is the only country to ban the technology.
