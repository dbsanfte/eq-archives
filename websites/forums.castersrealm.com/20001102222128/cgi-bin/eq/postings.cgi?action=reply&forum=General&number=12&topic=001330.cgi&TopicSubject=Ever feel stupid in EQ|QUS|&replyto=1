I approached and THEN realize I was targetting a pet, and the NPC himself was not so indifferent, and I'm running again. I made it to the boat, and piloted it away unconcious after being knocked out as I took control. <BR>   At this point I had no idea where I was going, and stamina dropped rapidly.

I am in SK aviaks at lvl 22, when a RLfriend 12 necro logs on.  I have had a bag full of bones and pierce weapons for his pet stored in  the bank for a week.  Wanting to twink him a tad and ditch the bag, I pay 10pp to a nice druid to get me to WC.  I run to NFP bank, go to Oasis where he is fighting caimens and make the trade.  After twinking him for a few rounds he needs to log.  No biggie, I take on a DW Croc.  Blue to me, but hell I am tough 22 shammy right?  WRONG!  I have one bubble of mana left from twinky boy, and it kills me as I crawl toward the Nro Zone .  Died within feet of the zone.<P>The kicker?  I am still bound in aviak city!  Now its Tuesday morning and I am off today till 4pm.  I get up and try to log on to make the long walk, but Ahhhhhh  Verant found it in their infinite wisdom to take the servers down for SEVEN HOURS today.  Now I am laying there dead for two days and I lost a bubble to help a LVL 12 RL friend.  I am a friggin retard for fighting like a warrior.

Well, he was kicking our butts and had dot'd me and I was dying quickly (real low on life) and low on mana.  Most of my buffs had worn off (including sow and regen) so I decided to sow myself so I could run away to the zone. I tried to cast, but was too low on mana, so I cannabalized just enough to sow myself.  I began to run to the zone and died shortly from the dot on my way (I can only guess that the dot was not recognized properly by my brain).  To this day I am still baffled at how dumb I was at that moment.  Ah well, never know if i'd lived anyway.

Since they lacked the money to pay for it themselves I ponied up the cash to buy the jewels.  So my friend and I head off to S Karana to turn this crap over and finally get the bracers some exp.<P>Well we get there and I'm busily talking to my guild having a good old time yukking it up with them.

I noticed that my chloro and alacrity were fading too.  Since i've NEVER been worried about things like this before, i rooted it, took a step back, started casting.
