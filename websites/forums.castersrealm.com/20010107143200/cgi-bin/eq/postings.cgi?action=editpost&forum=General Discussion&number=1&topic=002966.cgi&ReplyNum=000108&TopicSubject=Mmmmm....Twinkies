<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Corven your a jack ass, you take a person's view and you slaughter it just because you believe differently.  Silent Advice has some good points and from your responses I see that you are exactly the kind of person that he was talking about... the one that is to high level to get exp from the mobs he is farming and doesn't care about those that could get the exp.  Since your so inclined to voice your own idiotic opinion I think I will at least voice mine with a little more backing to why I think as I do, not like you thinking it’s right and that being a good enough excuse.

 ------------------------------------------
[b] 1) Yes it does, they are jealous because they are upset with others benefitting from something they are not benefitting from! [/b]
[b]2) I believe it is because you choose not to spend your time doing it! [/b]
[b]3) The quote "while my group could be getting good exp and loot from these mobs." implies jealousy that the other person is taking exp and loot that you are somehow entitled to over him! JEALOUSY!!! [/b]
[b]4) It does include jealousy! But you are right, you don't have to like it. But until the rules of the game are changed, you do have to put up with it. Unless you invoke the PNP rules and demand an equal turn at the mobs with your group that their group has! [/b]
[b]5) At least you admit that you changed your view once you reached the level where you were able to twink your character out! I admire you for this acknowledgement. [/b]
[b]Just to be clear to everyone, playing your game is your business but it is Verant's business to see that the rules are obeyed by all! I personally have made a GM abide by the PNP rules and rule in my favor over someone who was farming an item for over 3 days! The person and the GM did not like it, but when a senior GM showed up, he said that the rules were as I had stated them and even if the GM trainee didn't like them she still had to abide by them and enforce them. If you know the rules, then you also know that you can force yourself into any farming spawn that you want to compete with! Either way you have at least a 50/50 chance of obtaining the item! [/b]
 ------------------------------------------

1)For starters this game has been out for over a year now and everyone should be able to twink to an extent meaning they have the means to do so if they choose to so why would someone be jealous if they were against it?  It's not like most people can't twink.  Second, some people like the role-play aspect of EQ and to not twink makes it that more of a challenge to them in some ways.
2)We’ll skip this one, it’s about one’s preference and I really don’t want to get into a “I said I like it so it’s ok to do” argument with you.
3)This is by far anything but jealousy from my standpoint.  You are so close-minded you can’t see the real reason why someone would be upset about this.  You take it for jealousy but you should be looking at it from a lower level persons view instead of the higher levels.  The reason I can see Silent Advice having a problem with this is that a high level that [b]doesn’t[/b] (as he initially said) get exp from the mobs takes away from a group that can be getting exp and earning an item instead of buying it from high levels all the time.  I can see this as being true because I enjoy an item more if I earned it by killing the monster for it not buying it from a high level.
4)You’re an idiot on this one, you are telling someone what he or she is feeling.  Just because he or she doesn’t like something doesn’t mean he or she is Jealous.  Maybe he or she doesn’t like it cause of some bad experiences.  I don’t have much to say except grow up and realize that you can’t determine what others think.
5)Just because he or she changed his or her view at higher level makes you admire him or her?  That’s the crapiest excuse to admire someone especially when your ripping his or her post from limb to limb up to that point.  

[b]I personally have made a GM abide by the PNP rules and rule in my favor over someone who was farming an item for over 3 days!

Once again you’re a jackass.  You seriously think a group of level 30s can out damage a 50-55 level druid, magician, necromancer or anything else with high damage?  That’s the stupidest thing I have heard.  Compete with a high level that can do over half damage to something your level in one spell.  I have seen a high level druid take out a clockwork with two spells that was farming Sol A and you think my group of three 38s could out damage her?  Your dilusional.

The play nice rules do help in most instances but not in all so you can’t always fall back on them.  From personal experiences your lucky to find a farmer that even cares if you want to share the spawn or not, they may say yes but they won’t let you attack the named mob before they get the kill, most are not afraid of getting in trouble by GMs or Guides.

Damn I hate when people try and tell others how to think.  If I came off sounding that way then I am sorry but knock off the tearing into someone’s thread just cause you don’t agree with them and I will stop as well.  Everyone has a choice whether or not to twink and it is just that… [b]their[/b] choice, whether you think they are idiots for not twinking or for twinking is your opinion.  Let it go and don’t worry about what others do with their characters and you will have more fun in the game instead of complaining about every other twinked out player runs by.
