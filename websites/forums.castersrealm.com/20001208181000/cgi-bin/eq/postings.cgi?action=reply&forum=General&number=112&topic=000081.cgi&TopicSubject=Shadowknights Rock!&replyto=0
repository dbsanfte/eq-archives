[B]How come everyone is so down on Shadowknights whenever I read the forums here in castersrealm?

Me and my best friend have two SKs each. I don't see it that we are unwanted in a group. As a matter of fact, when people heard me and him were online just last night, we had like 3 groups begging us to come and join them. The funny thing was that we were already in a group and not advertising that we were Looking for a Group.

If SKs are hated as much as what your boards and Allakazam's polls say, then how come it is that both our high lvl and low lvl SKs are desired when we walk into a zone and people hear that we are online? 

I don't see the SK as being useless in either their tanking ability or their casting ability. SKs have some of the very best armor suited to the SK character -- possibly better than any other class-specific armor in the game. SKs also have some of the best spells for grouping. Whenever I'm in a group with either my low lvl SK or my high lvl SK, the group prefers that I pull because of my casting ability and my ability to tank the damage while other tanks taunt off me or the enchanter mezzes the mob. By far, both my SKs do more damage than any warrior I have grouped with lately.

Please let people know that SKs are one of the BEST classes in the game with the BEST class specific armor in the game and have some of the MOST useful spells in the game. Hands down, NO-ONE pulls better than an SK once they have reached level 30. Even the level 15 and 22 spells are respectable.

As far as the SK pets go, they aren't meant to tank for you! They are simply to help you do additional damage to the already awesome damage you already do. Use the /pet notaunt command to take the taunt out of your pet and you will hang on to him a much longer time. The pet also serves in giving you a couple of valuable seconds should you find yourself in trouble and need to run for the zone. Simply turn on the taunt using /pet taunt command and then head for the zone. Your pet will surely die, but you will have a head start on mob that is attacking you and you have a chance of escaping that you wouldn't otherwise have in some situations.

In my humble opinion, Shadowknights are one of the very best and definately one of the most fun classes to play in the whole game.
But be warned, SKs are one of the highest difficulty classes and only someone who wants a TRUE challenge should play one. For those of you who want the easy road, go ahead and play a woodelf druid, but don't complain that SKs are useless just because you don't understand how valuable they are or don't want to play a real challenge in your character.[/B][/QUOTE]

LoH is far better than HT in every way. LoH can not be resisted, always does full amount of healing, and heals A LOT more hp than HT could even think about dealing assuming it does actually hit the target. furthermore, i am not complaining, i enjoy the SK as much as the paladin but i do feel that HT is kind of a worthless attribute in some aspects seems how it doesnt ever do an enormous amount of damage compared to casters of equal levels and HT comes back after 24 game hours not a few min med time. perhaps making HT have a higher damage potential (leaving it still resistable), giving it a full damage guarantee but the same max damage that it currently has, or by making it a lifetap. in my opinion, making HT a lifetap effect would better suit the design of the character as well as evening out the opposite classes in every way (SK's and paladins). </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#DEDFDF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">drkknght145</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">sk and paladin are the same just ones good and the others evil  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#F7F7F7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">cleaver77</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I have a 22 iskar SK and a 24 dwarven paladin, and I agree that both classes are fine classes. <P>The SK is indeed the most fun class to play I think because they are just plain interesting. I tried a warrior and got bored by level 15. I agree, a SK is hard to play and takes a long time to get up in the levels. But the fact is, with every new batch of spells you will see the SK become more and more effective. Even just at 15, when you get clinging darkness, you will see a nice difference. <P>Paladins are also a great class. Compared to a SK, paladins will do less damage overall in a battle, but have less downtime because of thier healing. both are fun to play. And dont let the exp penelty disuade you. It may take more work then other classes, but when you get to level 20 you will start to see the real benefits of the class open up. Happy EQing. <P>------------------<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#DEDFDF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">alfredo</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I am in the high forties now, and my human SK was my very first EQ character, from the game's start up.  In my opinion, I think we can hold our own, but EQ is a group vision, and most people I run into don't want to group, and rate the solo players like the necros and druids of much higher worth.  Casters rule all over us melee types.  If you like casting SK spells, start a necro, you will fall in love.  At my level, I never usually get all my spells off before the fight is over --- I don't rate casting anywhere near as high as Feigh Death and high AC.  As for the pet I got right now --- that taunt fix won't work.  Don't matter if it taunting or not --- it gonna get smacked twice and die --- stuff I fighting is merciless, and can drop your hit points in a few rounds.  Our pets, at half our level and limited hit points === forget it.  I hope it improves later, IF I can keep leveling )</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#F7F7F7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Sabor</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">To Lord Pluvious...As a lvl 19 SK, Harm Touch has saved my butt quite often.

Used correctly they might not seem, at first, to be as powerful as any other classes but in the long run they show their true colours. The HT does have it's uses, but you have to play that card at the right time. The armor is indeed very nice, though there is better out there. I'll say this much about SK's: of all the classes in the game, when roleplayed correctly they're the meanest, nastiest, and most powerful bad-asses in the game.<P>Chew on that guys.<BR>I am Satan</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#F7F7F7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Raziel</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Right on Daemion!!</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#DEDFDF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">drkknght145</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">i use the spells for pulling  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#F7F7F7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kanekra</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">SK's are one awesome class. I never have trouble finding a group and am usually the puller. Overall, we may not do quite as much damage as warriors, but with spells and feign we are excellent pullers. And I dont think anyone can outtaunt a SK, which is one main reason they are desirable. With darkness and fear, we can solo quite well and with a druid in a group, I can keep the mobs feared, which cuts way down on downtime.The other day one person told me I was an incredible player and the funny thing is I was using my stiletto of the bloodclaw and my skill was only 46 at the time which just goest to show we make quite an impression even when we arent the heaviest damage dealers.

I like to solo often because it is a challenge and gives me the time to master the combination of spells and tanking. I'm glad that I  am about to get 30 because this now gives me Heat Blood and Feign Death plus raises my lifetap from 11 to 45. From this level on I can see few classes capable of soloing and fewer capable of saving a group during a severe overpull which I already have a few times. By using Darkness to slow the enemy - fear to make MOB's run - feign death to save yourself - and tanking to protect others, A SK can show that they are the best class to have in a group.<p>[This message has been edited by Kodex (edited 09-19-2000).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#F7F7F7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Murkadunk da Trollie</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Sk are indeed very strong, and aswell in pvp and are probably the only melee type that have a good change against any caster.
