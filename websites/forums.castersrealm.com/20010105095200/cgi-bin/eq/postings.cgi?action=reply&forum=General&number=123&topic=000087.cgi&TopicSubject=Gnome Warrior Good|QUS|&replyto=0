(unless it's true about the ac bonus against mobs bigger than them) But there's not anything that'll make them significantly worse. (now that I've learned all about warriors   <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"> hehe) They can do the same thing other warriors can do. They may hit a little lower or have a little less hp than some, but they do their job. I have to admit, I think the gnome helms look pretty cool. And a gnome wielding and ex axe looks cool. (in that funny sort of way) As to why she chose one, I guess she can answer that base on her reasons. Actually, she can answer it all since this was directed to her. lol  What was I thinking? Oh well, too late now, I like saying stuff and watching my post counter go up.

People were sacrificing huge amounts of AC to get bigger, better stats.  People were convinced that stats made the warrior.  People were convinced that Gnomes would simply suck as Warriors because of their low stats.<P>My opinions were similar to these.  And I picked a Gnome warrior anyways.  Why?  I wanted a challenge.  I wanted to play a character that would have serious obstacles to overcome, so that when I eventually reached 50th level, I could say "Well sure, you got your *Barbarian* warrior to 50th level.  But that's easy!  I got a *Gnome* warrior to 50th!"<P>It wasn't until I was well underway that we started learning how melee works in EQ.  And we learned that playing a Gnome warrior isn't a whole lot tougher than playing a Barbarian or an Ogre warrior.  (And in some places, like Sol A and Sol B, it's actually easier to be a Gnome than an Ogre or a Barb.)<P>As for solid statistical evidence to support that Gnomes don't make bad warriors, all I can say is:  I'm 46th level.  I'd be higher if it weren't for the fact that (A) I took a 4-month vacation from EQ; and (B) I've been futzing around with my alt characters lately and haven't been playing my warrior as much.  But when I do play my Warrior, I do just fine.<P>So if a Gnome warrior can get to 46th level, then we've got to have *something* going for us.   <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/biggrin.gif"><BR><P>------------------<BR><B>Ruatha Kneeslasher &lt;Wings of Honor&gt;</B><BR>46th Level Gnome Warriorette<BR><I><B>Some day we'll look back on all of this, laugh nervously, and change the subject...</B></I></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#F7F7F7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aileen of Quellious</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">It's not about the race you choose.

I can go toe to toe with anything a lvl 60 ogre or barbarian can!  <P>People think warriors just hit the auto attack button and that's all their is to it.  Sure we don't have as many complicated tasks as an enchanter or a bard, but there are many strategies we can still employ.  <P>Working together with one's group is essential.  It's bad warrior tactics to go hitting mezzed creatures.  It's bad to ignore the mob hitting your cleric.  <P>I think with disciplines, warriors get added tactics.  I know when and where to use defensive.  Warriors can make or break a group depending on how well they work with the party (I guess that goes for any class/char really)<P>But, to reiterate.  It's not the race, it's the person playing the character.   <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/wink.gif">  <P>-Aileen<P>ps:  AC helps too.   <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/wink.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#DEDFDF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Baarak Orchammer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aye, it seems that race you choose is for the sake of style. There are some moderate advantages of the large races- Higher strength and stamina, bashing without a shield. That's really about it. Do they make an huge difference? Not really. Strength gives you a very slight damage increase and (more importantly) lets you carry lots of stuff. Stamina gives you more hit points. At higher levels that is the only real difference between a gnome and an ogre. Bashing without a shield is nice, but ghetto bashing does exist.<P>Play what makes you happy!

I have gone through my periods of time where I wanted to play the healer of a group instead of being the one that stood there and got pounded while trying to keep the  mobs off the casters/healers but something clicked inside me about 2 months ago, I loved my dwarven warrior and had to play him, I had to get him to planes ready stage.  I have gotten more levels in the past couple months then I have ever gotten in that time period cause I of my enthusiasm to play a warrior.<P>My oppinion on what race is the best for warrior class would have to be.... Look inside you, see what you imagine yourself as, once you have the picture go from there.  Sounds weird but thats what I did and I love playing my dwarf.  You can always increase stats with items later on if your not happy with what you ended with so don't worry to much about what race has better stats.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#F7F7F7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Bick</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><I>People think warriors just hit the auto attack button and that's all their is to it.</I><P>Yes many people think that but there is MUCH skill in playing a Warrior.  I can attest to that as an Enchanter... maybe more than any other class.  Grouping with good Warriors is the reason I started my Warrior.<P>Here are a few things that come to mind, from an Enchanter's point of view:<P>What type of mob to go for first?  Not such a problem you might think, but it might be crucial which mob you go for so that your groupmates don't die.  Example:  Efreeti Raids .. IMP PROTECTORS FIRST!  The Imp Protectors are HARD TO MEZ, but the Lava Guardians are easy.  Save your Enchanter his life, thus saving your whole group's life.<P>What to attack and when.  I seriously doubt that there isn't an Enchanter out there who hasn't been killed when the Melee broke his mez.  <P>How to save the casters when they get attacked.  You can take the blows .. so taunt that thing off the casters!   <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">  I was so impressed with a certain warrior on my server who I grouped with in my high 20's to low 30's.  Talk about perfect timing, that guy knew what to look for, when to attack, when to back off...  He knew to look for the 'Bick begins to cast a spell' and even had a good grasp of the timing of my spells to know when to stop attacking, so as to not keep attacking through my mez, breaking it, which would then aggro the mob on me, killing me.  I dropped my jaw to the floor a few times watching him work.<P>When to throw in the towel.  I've been in whole groups that were wiped out because the Warrior/Tank couldn't suck it up and just die away from the group because of an overpull.<P>What you can expect from your casters.  Yesterday my Enc was killed in Karnors because the Warrior pulled too soon after I was rez'd.  He didn't understand that since we were in close quarters (skelly captain) I needed certain buffs, namely my MR buffs so I wouldn't get caught in my own AOE mez's.  To him, I had medded up enough, and I certainly had if the spawn wasn't in such a small area.  <P>Hmmm, I can't think of any others, but I'll say this about tanks.  I like Warriors best   <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">.  When I want a tank I look for a warrior.  Best hps, best ac, great dmg output.  Come, let me Swift Like the Wind you my Warrior friends  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"><P>Bick 51st Enc<BR>Keturo 29th War<p>[This message has been edited by Bick (edited 09-14-2000).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#DEDFDF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Bloode</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I hate to say it but not to many people outside the warrior class (sometimes even within the warrior class) understand what Bick just described.  To have someone notice that your character is a little more complex then just click and attack is a great thing.<P>Anyways, I know this is a little off topic but I just thought of it.  Have any of you other warriors out there ever have anyone you know or in your group tell you how to do your job?  If so... doesn't that get annoying?  I mean, I been doing this job for 40 seasons and people have the nerve to yell during a fight telling me that I need to do this instead of that.  Just for instance, I was in Sol B the other day, we didn't have an enchanter so my job (assigned by myself beings no other tank in the group wanted the job) was to get as many mobs on me while the rest of the group finished off one by one.  Well I was doing my usual see how many mobs can beat on bloode after the puller came back with four Kobolds when the group leader started yelling telling me to assist the puller, ignoring him I continued to taunt the kobolds that were creaming our healer and again he told me to assist the puller.  After the fight was done, I sat down, the healer thanked me for not letting him die and healed me up.  Our group leader came over to me and started *****ing at me, saying that we could of had them dead sooner if I wasn't messing around by trying to solo the rest.  Now you all have to understand.  I am a good natured person and rarely do I blow up but this just happened to be one of the times I couldn't contain myself.  I told him to sit his butt down and heal up for starters, and secondly that he needs to worry about himself before he starts telling a tank how to do his job.  I then proceeded to tell him that a group isn't worth anything if the healer dies and without me taunting the kobolds off the healer he would of been dead (our healer agreed with this), so I told him that I will do my job and he can do his job although I had yet to see what his job was.<P>Anyway, sorry to get off subject but thought I would share that with you all.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#F7F7F7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Polle</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><BR>That's pretty much true for any class, quite frankly.

It was great at lvl 14-16 in Oasis. The best group I've ever had. The reason why is because me and the enchanter understood what our jobs were and how to do them, and the druids understood mes'ing. I'd run over the hill at P2 and grab the orc camp. (4 orcs, usually one "a" orc warrior and the other 3 were blue to yellow "an" orc warriors and priests) I'd say inc, get "a" first. Me and the rogue would beat it down while the chanter would mes the other 3 and the druids would heal. If they all broke and went on the chanter, I'd let the rogue take the "a" for a sec with the druids healing him while I'd taunt the others so the chanter could re-mes. Or if they broke and went on the healers, I'd spin back and fourth taunting and hitting until mes'd. The druids wouldn't attack, and I'd stop and back off as soon as the mes hit.  They all knew it was more than just a click and stand there, they could see me running around in circles, attracting all the mobs, and all of us living. The druids and chanter would actually say "on me" when a mes broke, as a signal to me, then I'd be right on it and taunt it back until mes'd. That group couldn't have worked that well if any one person hadn't been there had we not known how to work together. It was awesome. As a melee, I always want an enchanter, one other melee, (tank now since I'm playing a monk) and either a cleric, or a 2 person combo of druids and/or shamen. <P>   --Orakio<BR>PS: We did realise that the druids could have lulled the orcs in the first place, but I didn't feel that it would be as much fun.  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"> A couple of us almost died several times, but we acted quickly enough to make it work.

I've been in groups where I thought the lead tank should run the show, and also certain situations where I (Enchanter) should run the show.  Also, about dying, I would not argue against your statement that Warriors (or melees in general) die more often than the Enchanter.  The frequency of an Enchanter's death is most determined by the competency of the group.  At low levels you fight with less experienced people and I would say that the Enchanter dies more often, but at high levels, playing with experienced people, the Enchanter dies less.
