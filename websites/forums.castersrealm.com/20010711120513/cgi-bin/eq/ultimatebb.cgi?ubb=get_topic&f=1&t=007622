The truth is I think Verant stinks atm and these are the reasons why:<BR>1.) Drop rates on good things are decreasing, but the number of people required to set foot in the zone to get it and the number of people that need them increase. i.e.- velious quest armors. 2 out of those three quest armors require fighting in the Temple of Veeshan. 5 different classes need the same pieces to complete quests yet the crap seems to have a drop rate equal to or less than plane items.<P>2.) Their Hybrid mana solutions. It is a terrible one because they really didn't fix anything. They made it so hybrids would have the same amount of mana as a caster with equal int or wis but it still costs more for you to cast that spell and you still get the spell later. The thing is, hybrids do not have the same wis or int as the parent class and thus this whole mana thing works itself out naturally if they had the same mana as a caster who had the same wis or int(given it would make NO sense for the conversions to be different anyway) and the spell costs were exactly the same because they get the spells later and they will have less mana than parent class. Still not sure? How many effective rangers do you know walk around with 200 +wis?? paladin? I'll tell you right now, I do not know about other people but I will be damned if I take in a 60 paladin with 200 wis in my group so I could have a full power level 44 cleric that could not complete heal and could not tank for anything.<P>3.) The new forums. Yes they prevent trash talkers from getting their words in but it also prevents reason from getting through. <P>4.) Dwarf Quest armor stinks. Not only are the stats everywhere,(AC rangin from being 2 more than deepwater to being 5 less than deepwater on some pieces) but the stats also seem almost exact to the dropped armor in Growth, Hate, and Fear(new ones ofcourse) and that is pretty stupid.<P>5.) Their lame effort to try and retain customers all of a sudden seeing the competition is comming by doing things like offering to make a "roleplay" server. HELLO, this is NOT a roleplaying game it is a powergamers game. When their a re Dark Elf Rogues that con amiable to paladin and cleric guild masters, there is no roleplay. When there are Dark Elf clerics, there is no roleplay. When the only way to obtain something from a being, eventhough you con amiable to them, is by killing them, there is NO roleplay. <P>6.) /inspect on /inspect off turns of a person's ability to inspect another person?? I have NO idea of who thought this one up. Listen, I do not care what side you are on(Don't care if inspected without asking, do care, care so much you have killed over it) it does NOT matter why? Just make it so that those that do not wish to be inspected can turn it off and those that do can turn it on. EVERYONE IS NOW HAPPY  <P>7.) Conning system stinks because it is a bassis for exp and it shouldn't be. I have played MANY a roleplaying game and NEVER have I seen such a deficient system in my life. Any other game I have played individual mobs yield a certain amount of exp not some color coded chart! Why? Well lets think, is a Drovlarg Sentry just as easy to beat as a gnoll pup? NO!! but they both con green and they both give no exp, the only difference is one will actually have a chance of killing me and if I barely win he will give me nothing! You can not make those two mobs equal when it comes to exp, that is stupid because are no where near equal in challenge.<P>That does it for now, but I am sure there are more gripes I have but it is late and work is in a few hours. <P>Bring on the flames! I'll stand by my words and combat each and every challenger or devil's advocate (it's kinda fun  ) and I'll either adequately defend or I'll have a change of heart but either way I learn something. <P><B>Now, I said I can now see people being able to change factions but I do believe that some faction changes should be permanent and that some hatreds should be permanent.<P>In EQ you can jump from one faction to the other and back in a relatively short amount of time and that shouldn't be the case.</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by The Chicken:<BR><STRONG>I am humbled by your wisdom. I couldn't have said it better myself. The following is a repost from what I had to say on the "the truth" theard. I'm reposting it here in support of ragefactor, and the fact that I didnt write it all out to have the tread locked 24 hours later and fall to the bottom of the list, unread, do to the flaming of others. These are the 3 main posts I made. Maybe this thread can be "the truth 2" without all the flames and enlightend discussion with observers brillaint header and lead in.<BR>1. Amen Rage. I agree with everything you said, although I do belive evil races should be allowed clerics. They are preists to their gods, and all gods needs their holy men. I do think, however, they should be granted different spells. They did this nicely in AD&D by limiting certain spells and granting unique abilities depending on what god one choose to worship. This makes since because clerics and priests are given their power directly from their god and no evil god would tolerate using its power for the healing or blessing of a goodly race and vice versa. As a matter of fact doing that has grave consequnces in AD&D.<P>Taobob your constant roleplaying arguments in these boards are so broad one could say Quake III is a roleplaying game. Now yes it could be argued that it is and one could make it so. However, we all know damn well it anit. Same with everquest. Just like Rage said if you roleplay in everquest you are going against the grain. The game fights you when you try to accomplish roleplaying in an atmosphere that roleplaying was, poorly at best, implemented. Yes you can roleplay in this game but it makes about as much sense as doing so in Quake. <P>2. This is my take on everquest and roleplaying. I truly wish it was what I consider a roleplaying game, but its not. Take Diablo 2 for example. I think all of us (save for maybe taobob) can agree its not a roleplaying game. Now besides 1st person view and factions (its also a 1 player game but it can be played online so thats rather a moot subject), the gameplay is almost indentical. 1st person view and factions does not make a dungeon hack (diablo 2) a roleplaying game. Which is what they tried to do with everquest. <BR>Yea so you can talk to other people, but you can do that in diablo 2 if you play it online. It doesnt make it a roleplaying game if you talk in character while playing a dungeon hack.<P>3. My, my how this has grown since I commented on pages 1 and 2 (read them for earlier arguments). I think the problem is alot of the people saying this a role-playing game have very limited experiance with the genre. This is to be expected since once something goes mainstream (like everquest did) it attracts alot of new people. In true roleplaying games there is cause and effect relationship with the world. Gods play an intricate part in this cause and effect. Say for example I'm an evil necromancer who was granted some arcane powers from his dark god. If I used those powers to help goodlys in anyway (grouping etc) I would fall from his favor very quickly and there would be dire consequnces for my blasphemous ways. *Spoiler for the dark elf trilogy* Take for example this as well when it comes to the ablilty for how easy it is for dark races to forsake thier people. Drizzt (the famous drow with a good heart)when he was young went on a surface raid to kill light elves. He saw the brutal killing of them and refused to take part secretly by fake killing a elven girl and saving her life in the process. The drow's dark god Lolth saw this and was not pleased. His family fell from her favor which lead to his family's demise and his escape into the underdark. Where he was hunted night and day by his own kind seeking to please thier goddess. When he finally found the surface it took him a lifetime to create even a few friends that would trust him and look beyond the color of his skin.*End of spoiler*<BR>So yes these things can happen but the consequnces for those actions are dire indeed. Not so in everquest. One can run about doing whatever one pleases with little or no effect and even then most of the time its reversable. That is a fatal flaw in calling everquest a role-playing game. If one can do whatever he or she wants why role-play it serves no purpose. <P>My second point is the reward system. There is zero, none, not one bit of reward for role-playing in everquest that I have ever seen. Why should people go out of there way and do it when its meaningless. I dont go to work everday for nothing. Yes you can say its fun but its also more work then powergaming. So this is what happened in the beginning when I started playing just after beta there was alot of role-players, but as time moved on people saw that it really served no purpose in this game and stopped doing it. Why role-play when nothing comes of it and the powergamer route is more rewarding and time friendly. Yes you can say what you want but the fact remains people wont do something for nothing very long. The only way to advance in this game is killing and more killing thus i call it a hack and slash. Some trade skills are useful but most are not and how do you make money to learn a trade skill? yep you guessed it killing.<P>So the warp things up its not the players fault role-playing is dead or dying in this game. Having played good solid role-playing games for years I can see the glaring flaws this game has in that aspect.<P>Taobob just because a game says role-playing on the box or has the look of a fantasy role-playing does not mean it is by a long shot. <P>Like I said before and I'll say it again just because you can talk in character in a hack and slash does not make it a role-playing game.<P>Heh and for my shameless Neverwinter Nights plug. Check out <A HREF="http://www.neverwinternights.com" TARGET=_blank>www.neverwinternights.com</A>  it seems to me,at least from what i can see the best real role-playing game thats comming out soon. AI and scripted code can never replace the real role-playing feel a dm gives. <P>Comments? </STRONG><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Just trying to save you sometime Chicken.  Hope ya don't mind.<P>Later,<P><BR>   <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" border="0">

a:  I don't know if verant stinks.  I do know that they have provided a game with the primary intention of making money.  The secondary intent is for their vision, and somewhere further down the list is the opinion of individual players.<P>1:  I think almost everyone agrees that drop rates are a problem.  The solution, however, is a little more difficult to arrive at.  An economy that uses drop rates to determine rarity is in for problems.  EQ uses that system, and it isn't likely to be changed.  There are other solutions out there, but this is the one they have.  If EQ2 (if there ever is such a thing) uses the same method, then I will admit verant has noodles for brains.<P>2) I also agree that the hybrid solution is not good.  Verant has a different vision that mine for what a hybrid should be.  I believe hybrids should be more powerful than parent classes.  I also believe that the current setup makes them mostly worthless.  A single paladin should be able to slay a dragon.<P>3) I don't know about this one.  Nothing in what I purchased told me I would have on-line access to developers for EQ to voice my concerns.  It was a free gift, that they decided they could not afford.  It is their perogative.  <P>4)  I agree that the item power/risk/reward system is unbalanced.  Not just with dwarf armor.  This is a problem of trying to put out new stuff that is better than the last, but the last was already uber.  Reminds me of monty haul AD&D campaigns.  Many items are not worth getting.  That said, if one is playing more for the fun of getting all the dwarf stuff, it can be fun to do.  Also, I wouldn't put someone down for not trying to get all the new stuff just because it is a little better.<P>5)  I have answered this before.  My opinion is that on a scale of 1-10 where 1 is does not support role-play and 10 is 'actively encourages role-play, I give EQ a 4.5.<P>6)  You obviously have this wrong.  The command turns on and off NOTIFICATION of whether someone is inspecting you.  They can still inspect.  You just don't know it.<P>7)  I agree with this whole-heartedly.  I do believe that it is possible to reach a point at which you no longer get experience for something, but it should be trivial by then.  It is clear that EQ uses a system of increased level costs, so decreasing experience is almost pointless.  That isn't my problem with it, however.  The message for green cons is that you will most likely win, when that is clearly not the case after about level 30.  The con system lies, because monsters are compared against your level, but they are powered for a group of your level.  I have seen it put this way:  After lvl 25, figure that the con means for a group of people your level rather than a single person your level.<P>I, too, have many problems with the mechanics of EQ.  That said, they did a fairly good job of making a game that plays fairly well, and, for the most part, allows players fairly uniterrupted play.  As a software developer, and a game afficianado, I find that overall I am impressed with the effort.  Other games will come out that are better.  Other companies will make them.  Verant will either go broke or create an even better game.  That has been the evolution of gaming for ever.  If the game development community does not listen, then some new company will come in and steal their market.  <P>In the mean time, most of what you say is correct.  What do you expect us to do about it?  I plan on making the best of it and have fun.  For me, that is role-play in the disciples of balance guild.  I don't care about having the best items, nor about leveling fast.  I intend to make friends and have a good time.<P>--------------------<P>Josef - Servant of Balance

<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">
There is some truth in what you say here, but there is also opinion based strickly on how you feel the game, ...I don't know the right term, ... cheats you?<P>1.) "Drop rates on good things are decreasing, but the number of people required to set foot in the zone to get it and the number of people that need them increase." ---- absolutely true, and absolutely needed. the amount of effort it takes me at 55th level to get the new armor should NOT be equal to the amount of effort required for a 12th level character to get bronze armor. It should get exponentially more and more difficult the further you progress. It should be near impossible to get the best items, and therefor impressive to see them on ANY character let alone on your own. <P>2.) "Their Hybrid mana solutions." --- here I can understand a degree of frustration. But the fact remains that a hybrid should never be able to cast any spell as efficiently as the parent class. The balance has to be maintained between parent/hybrid. The hybrid gets the spells later, yes. But what you suggest, the hybrid having the same mana calcs and same casting costs for a given spell, could only be balanced if the parent were allowed every combat ability of the hybrid, but were only awarded them later. I think the first part is what you invision, please correct me if I'm wrong. In that scenario what I suggest would be the only way to maintain balance and not have the parent's be under-effective.<P>3.) "The new forums."  --- Really nothing to argue here. Have to agree completely.<P>4.) "Dwarf Quest armor stinks." --- don't know enough about it to discuss it. <P>5.) "Their lame effort ..." --- I guess for this one I question why you play? Are you opposed to RP? Do you wish the game were more supportive of it? Have to understand what you would prefer to understand what it is you expect. As far as VI's efforts go, yeah, they want to keep players. I don't think that they have done an unreasonable job in the last months in upkeep and improvement of the game. Sure, it's designed to keep people, but what does anyone care? If it's better, it's better, regradless of the conspiracy behind it. If it's not, then why do people stay?<P>6.) "/inspect on /inspect off"  --- I'm just going to guess that this was a bizarre sideline, that missed the edit phase. It really has nothing to do with VI or it's quality unless you think that thought towards it is wasted effort. Of course I think thought towards the mana conversion is wasted effort and everything should've never changed, but that's personal opinion and I can respect that you feel strongly about it. <P>7.) "Conning system stinks" --- the conning system does have flaws. As for why anything that is green to you doesn't give you xp, that's a limitation of the engine. There is no person there for every situation to say, "you don't deserve any xp for that, because it was stupidly easy for you" so there has to be code that does it. Verant is aware as anyone that people will exploit the intent of the game. I don't think it's unfair of them to try to limit it as much as possible. Do you have any clue how many 55th level players would be sitting in Upper Guk on 10 hour foglok slaughters because they actually got experience for it? I understand that the line drawn now is a bit harsh, but it is done with the intentions in the right place. I would love to hear suggestions that tempered protection from exploit and allowed for risk in gaining xp. The game gets harder and harder, and I've been killed by things 20 levels below me. But it doesn't mean that they game is hopelessly flawed. <P>"Bring on the flames! I'll stand by my words and combat each and every challenger or devil's advocate (it's kinda fun ) and I'll either adequately defend or I'll have a change of heart but either way I learn something. "  --- This is such a fantasically encouraging statement that it is the only reason I responded in the first place. <P>The game has flaws. There is not a doubt. But overall can you say with absolute certainty that Verant does more wrong than right? Given time have they not addressed a great many things people were concerned about? Does it not stand to reason that given more time, more things will be addressed? Another point that should be brought to the fore, is that you disagree(along with many others) about many of the positions Verant has taken. But many disagree with you on the same topics. Someone once said (and I don't know who), that the best way to ensure that you satisfy no one, is to try to satisfy everyone.<P>--------------------<P>Aazamn <BR>56th Defiler of Prexus<BR>"The best way to ensure that you satisfy no one, is to try to satisfy everyone." - unknown

Drop rates on good things are decreasing, but the number of people required to set foot in the zone to get it and the number of people that need them increase. i.e.- velious quest armors. 2 out of those three quest armors require fighting in the Temple of Veeshan. 5 different classes need the same pieces to complete quests yet the crap seems to have a drop rate equal to or less than plane items.<BR></STRONG><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>For a long time, I have said Verant should have stopped certain items from dropping entirely after a while (much like the Manastone, except not because it is overpowered, but to stop the flow of them into the game).

Their Hybrid mana solutions. It is a terrible one because they really didn't fix anything. They made it so hybrids would have the same amount of mana as a caster with equal int or wis but it still costs more for you to cast that spell and you still get the spell later. The thing is, hybrids do not have the same wis or int as the parent class and thus this whole mana thing works itself out naturally if they had the same mana as a caster who had the same wis or int(given it would make NO sense for the conversions to be different anyway) and the spell costs were exactly the same because they get the spells later and they will have less mana than parent class. Still not sure? How many effective rangers do you know walk around with 200 +wis?? paladin? I'll tell you right now, I do not know about other people but I will be damned if I take in a 60 paladin with 200 wis in my group so I could have a full power level 44 cleric that could not complete heal and could not tank for anything.<BR></STRONG><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Agree with you here.  Hybrids in general need some work.  My first character hunted from level six to 50 with a Ranger (who post 50, powered way past me to 60 as he could play much more often then me).  Was he overpowered during the early days of EverQuest when warriors were wearing banded too?  You betcha.  Too bad once the higher level items started trickling down and the massive warrior buffings from the early days went into effect, they started to lose that power.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><STRONG><BR>3.)

It is a descent paladin only sword.  Do you expect it to be carried around by some shadowknight?  Should a paladin be the one to carry such a blade?

Yes, there are exceptions to this rule.  I don't think that every creature should continue to give experience to players.  That would honestly only encourage people to hunt lower end creatures.

The way you turn this into a RP game(sure there are more):<P>1.) More items that are comparable and desirable as opposed to everything moving up a ladder. FD and Nature's Defender are an example of a step in the right direction. <BR>Not everyone is after the samething here(that's also in part due to the difficulty of obtaining the other and because it becomes more difficult after 52) but it is a step in right direction. This encourages traveling and makes it more so of not caring about phat loot because you are going to get good items as long as you are playing and you aremore likely to look unigue because of the variety.<P>2.) Because of lack of variety the very first thing that should be doen is increase drop rates rather than decrease. Why? People when they want something are going to camp it no matter how long it takes. Camping is only worse if the item drops less because they want that item so rather than being gone in an hour or two they are there for eight.<P>3.) Too much of a hack n slash. You have to kill basically everything to get anything. Rather than just being able to get one of those velious shields dwarfs have, I have to kill them for it and I am warmly to them. Where is the quest where they just want me to travel through some dangerous realm to deliver medicine or something. I have to kill a paladin for a holy sword and that paladin likes me. Why not ask him for it and maybe he will say duel me and prove your worth one-on-one or maybe he says if you bring me such and such I will grant you the blade you need to help my people.<P>4.) Factions, some should be permanent as it as more verb and challenge when there are bloodwars or die hard adversaries. For this reason this should effect players as well. Like people take massive exp penalties for grouping with oneanother when they are supposed to be enemies or their stats are lowered or something kind of like rez effects becuase it is the diety placing a mark on them while they cooperate with the enemy. <P>5.) Make it so that there is plenty to do other than fight and make it worth doing. Say your faction goes up for donating and having no money in the bank or if you constantly steal from others your faction goes up with your diety and related things. <P>That's just it. For those of you who say you think roleplay is to do whatever you want, you are completely wrong and have lost the concept of TRUE rp. You want to roleplay a good DE but suffer no consequences for your decision or have the penalties be minor. Wow, all you have to do is kill a few orcs and your our friend. You can kill mobs that raise faction with good but do not lower faction with an evil other than that particular mob, and if you are raising faction with good you should lose your faction with evil faster than raising it with the good and I mean much faster.<P>That is roleplay. If a mobster sold out his group to the Feds do the feds automatically like them? Is it easier to get the FBI to like you for turning traitor or to get killed for being a traitor?   Can you jump back and forth with the two?  Piss of the mobsters then go back and be friends with them then piss them off again and go to the FBI again then go back to mobsters?  and this is what Rp is about.

<BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by RageFactor:<BR><STRONG>The truth is I think Verant stinks atm and these are the reasons why:<BR>1.) Drop rates on good things are decreasing, but the number of people required to set foot in the zone to get it and the number of people that need them increase. i.e.- velious quest armors. 2 out of those three quest armors require fighting in the Temple of Veeshan. 5 different classes need the same pieces to complete quests yet the crap seems to have a drop rate equal to or less than plane items.<BR></STRONG><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>The only dropping in rate has occurred in Velious, and that same thing happened when they released kunark.  They start out with the first week or two with drops really high (i.e. I got an entire set of sentient armor in a day in wakening lands) to introduce the items into the economy, then they drop the rates on em (i.e. I got one piece of sentient armor in one day a few weeks later).  And when something's the best or very close to the best, it's not meant for everybody to have.  It's meant for the best of the best to have, if it was easy to get then it'd be pointless to get it.<BR>   <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><BR><STRONG><BR>2.) Their Hybrid mana solutions. It is a terrible one because they really didn't fix anything. They made it so hybrids would have the same amount of mana as a caster with equal int or wis but it still costs more for you to cast that spell and you still get the spell later. The thing is, hybrids do not have the same wis or int as the parent class and thus this whole mana thing works itself out naturally if they had the same mana as a caster who had the same wis or int(given it would make NO sense for the conversions to be different anyway) and the spell costs were exactly the same because they get the spells later and they will have less mana than parent class. Still not sure? How many effective rangers do you know walk around with 200 +wis?? paladin? I'll tell you right now, I do not know about other people but I will be damned if I take in a 60 paladin with 200 wis in my group so I could have a full power level 44 cleric that could not complete heal and could not tank for anything.<BR></STRONG><BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>I still don't get this argument... Verant gave hybrids a bit more mana (from what I understand, 8 levels worth, cause for the first 8 levels of a hybrid's life they don't have mana), which increased the want for hybrids in groups a bit, so what's wrong with that?<P>   <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><BR><STRONG><BR>3.) The new forums. Yes they prevent trash talkers from getting their words in but it also prevents reason from getting through. <BR></STRONG><BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>You can still send in comments and stuff to Verant, and, actually, chances are they will read it... on the previous boards if you put up a new subject in one minute it would be on the second page... how's Verant supposed to read it when it dissappears so fast?  And if you want players to read you opinions, post here, not on the EQ boards... pretty simple<P>   <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><BR><STRONG><BR>4.) Dwarf Quest armor stinks. Not only are the stats everywhere,(AC rangin from being 2 more than deepwater to being 5 less than deepwater on some pieces) but the stats also seem almost exact to the dropped armor in Growth, Hate, and Fear(new ones ofcourse) and that is pretty stupid.<BR></STRONG><BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>dwarf quest armor (at least the casters..) has the exact same stats as plane of growth armor, with a little less resists I believe.  What's so wrong with that?  PoG armor is pretty damn cool...  the Dwarf quests is just a way to get it if you don't want to ruin your kelethin/felwithe factions.  AC isn't everything, you should check the right click effects and resists on it.<P>   <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><BR><STRONG><BR>5.) Their lame effort to try and retain customers all of a sudden seeing the competition is comming by doing things like offering to make a "roleplay" server. HELLO, this is NOT a roleplaying game it is a powergamers game. When their a re Dark Elf Rogues that con amiable to paladin and cleric guild masters, there is no roleplay. When there are Dark Elf clerics, there is no roleplay. When the only way to obtain something from a being, eventhough you con amiable to them, is by killing them, there is NO roleplay. <BR></STRONG><BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>This is only a roleplaying game if you make it one, and it's only NOT a roleplaying game if you don't treat it as one.  Sure if you don't roleplay but be a power-gamer the game's easier, but that isn't much fun.  Roleplaying adds quite a bit of value and fun to this game (as i just recently found out    <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" border="0">)<BR>   <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><BR><STRONG><BR>6.) /inspect on /inspect off turns of a person's ability to inspect another person?? I have NO idea of who thought this one up. Listen, I do not care what side you are on(Don't care if inspected without asking, do care, care so much you have killed over it) it does NOT matter why? Just make it so that those that do not wish to be inspected can turn it off and those that do can turn it on. EVERYONE IS NOW HAPPY  <BR></STRONG><BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>All inspecting is is taking a closer look at what the person is wearing, like (an example by absor) if I wanted to read the print on the front of your shirt i might get a bit closer to read it.  /inspect off is so that when you're turning with the mouse, you don't accidentally right-click on ppl, which can get annoying for both you and for them.  If you don't want to know if somebody's inspecting you, turn off the inspect messages, simple as that.<P>   <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><BR><STRONG><BR>7.) Conning system stinks because it is a bassis for exp and it shouldn't be. I have played MANY a roleplaying game and NEVER have I seen such a deficient system in my life. Any other game I have played individual mobs yield a certain amount of exp not some color coded chart! Why? Well lets think, is a Drovlarg Sentry just as easy to beat as a gnoll pup? NO!! but they both con green and they both give no exp, the only difference is one will actually have a chance of killing me and if I barely win he will give me nothing! You can not make those two mobs equal when it comes to exp, that is stupid because are no where near equal in challenge.<BR></STRONG><BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>You've got to be the first person I've seen complain about the conning system, green means no exp, so whether it's a green 11 levels below you or a green 50 levels below you, it won't give you exp if you kill it, so it's green...  tho the fact that melee's can't solo high greens is rather funny sometimes    <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>   <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><BR><STRONG><BR>Now, I said I can now see people being able to change factions but I do believe that some faction changes should be permanent and that some hatreds should be permanent.<P>In EQ you can jump from one faction to the other and back in a relatively short amount of time and that shouldn't be the case.<BR></STRONG><BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>Ever been in velious?  Ever tried to get dragon faction up to warmly, then after you've killed enough giants for it to be there ever tried to then kill dwarves to get giants to warmly?  It will take weeks if you play for, say, 2 hours a day killing only dwarves.  Now old-world, yeah, factions can be flipped around pretty easy, but they're not gonna change a system like that after 2 years...<P>(after 500 some posts, this is the first time I've taken an entire post apart piece by piece and responded to it, go me    <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"> )<P><BR>Edit: one more thing, it took me at least 7 hours of giant killing(3 or 4 of which were deep inside kael where giants give bigger faction hits) to get dragons to DUBIOUS, dubious!!  If I want to get to warmly it's gonna be a hell of a lot more killing.  If I hadn't been deep inside kael it would have taken probably twice, or maybe three times as long.  After I get dragons to warmly, it'd take forever to get giants up to warmly... so of course I'm not even gonna bother heh.<P>Edit: one more thing...<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Gravelgut:<BR><STRONG>2) I also agree that the hybrid solution is not good.  Verant has a different vision that mine for what a hybrid should be.  I believe hybrids should be more powerful than parent classes.  I also believe that the current setup makes them mostly worthless.  A single paladin should be able to slay a dragon.<BR></STRONG><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>The thing is, back in the good old days (a whopping year and a half ago) hybrids WERE more powerful than the rest of the classes... but verant saw that once hybrids hit level 50, and the rest of the classes were level 50, it really wasn't fair... so they nerfed hybrids, then later took away the penalty for being a hybrid (the 40% exp penalty) cause that penalty was put in in the first place because hybrids were stronger... they just took 30% more time to level up.<P>And a paladin slaying a dragon, maybe in fantasy stories, but sorry, I don't want a paladin killing naggy and taking everything myself  <IMG SRC="tongue.gif" border="0"><P>Unless you want a really weak dragon that only paladins can attack that doesn't drop anything?  That'd be just silly.<P>--------------------<P>-Saethan<P><I>Your basis everything belongs to us!</I>

1)  Unfortunately, the game engine does not support much in the way of different items.  If the skill system actually differentiated weapons, it might work.  There are already a ton of items that are different.  Players have categorized and calculated the min/max ratio of everything such that there are clear favorites.  But everybody is going to want that axe of the dwarvish lords.<P>2)  Your solution isn't a solution.  Imagine an AD&D campaign.  "He has the axe of the dwarvish lords.  I want one too."  "But it is an artifact.  There is only one."  "So what.  I am just as entitled to it as him."<P>What do you do?  Create a second?  Drop more?  The solution isn't to increase drop rates.  It is to provide a varied way of obtaining an item, through random quests of appropriate difficulty.  The item will only drop if the person is on the quest, and they cannot pass it along to someone else without the possibility of item decay.<P>Not everyone can have everything.  Some items should be limited, though those items may have the unique possibility of teleporting away to the next person.  I can hear the howling now.<P>3)I agree 100%  There should be many other ways to get experience.<P>4)I am divided on this issue.  The problem is, in reality, people can change.  So can peoples opinions.  Therefore I support faction change.  On the other hand, certain types of behavior should create permanent faction changes that cannot be fixed.  Imagine an evil dark elf participating in a hate plane raid and killing Inny!  Pure trouble.  Other kinds of things should be unrecoverable as well.  Until you don't have to kill your friends for your epic quest, however, I hope they don't change this.<P>5)  Again, 100% agreement.  It stinks that the only thing you really get exp or money for is fighting.  Actually, you can make a lot of money trading with other players, so perhaps it is just the experience thing.  I would like player made goods to be the best with the possible exception of epic stuff.<P>Final)  If a mobster sold out to the feds, he would be hated by the feds and the mobsters.  If he then joined a police force, and worked hard, helped the feds numerous times, and spent the next 20 years doing good, the feds would like him.  The mob would always hate him and never forgive.<P>--------------------<P>Josef - Servant of Balance

<BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><STRONG><BR>1.) More items that are comparable and desirable as opposed to everything moving up a ladder. FD and Nature's Defender are an example of a step in the right direction. <BR>Not everyone is after the samething here(that's also in part due to the difficulty of obtaining the other and because it becomes more difficult after 52) but it is a step in right direction. This encourages traveling and makes it more so of not caring about phat loot because you are going to get good items as long as you are playing and you aremore likely to look unigue because of the variety.<BR></STRONG><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Okay, so putting more quests in that resolve around hacking and slashing to get an item to turn in for a nice weapon is a good way to promote roleplaying?  To me, you seem to say hackin' and slashin' is bad (at least in number three you do).<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><STRONG><BR>2.) Because of lack of variety the very first thing that should be doen is increase drop rates rather than decrease. Why? People when they want something are going to camp it no matter how long it takes. Camping is only worse if the item drops less because they want that item so rather than being gone in an hour or two they are there for eight.<BR></STRONG><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>On of the things I honestly have long wished for is that items in the game were actually meaningul.  What would it be like&#8230; if that Short Sword of the Ykesha was rare?  What if it dropped once every 10,000 kills?  What if the norm was for players to be using forged weapons, banded, and fine plate instead of magic drop items (taking into an account, that creatures were balanced towards that side instead of what they currently are)?  To me, personally, I would like it better.  Yanno&#8230; having that Short Sword of Ykesha would be an extreme honor and status item, instead of the relative junk item it is today.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><STRONG><BR>3.) Too much of a hack n slash. You have to kill basically everything to get anything. Rather than just being able to get one of those velious shields dwarfs have, I have to kill them for it and I am warmly to them. Where is the quest where they just want me to travel through some dangerous realm to deliver medicine or something. I have to kill a paladin for a holy sword and that paladin likes me. Why not ask him for it and maybe he will say duel me and prove your worth one-on-one or maybe he says if you bring me such and such I will grant you the blade you need to help my people.<BR></STRONG><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Wow.  Roleplaying experience listed right here.  To kill the paladin for his sword or not to.  Tough choices to make.  Bingo, roleplaying&#8230; what would you character do?  Would he kill him?  Yes/no?  Simple question.  Make the choice by character.  And yes, I do believe the frog should allow you to quest for it.  The easy method is to kill him.  The hard method is to do the quest (and hopefully, the quest blade would be slightly better then the kill blade).<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><STRONG><BR>4.) Factions, some should be permanent as it as more verb and challenge when there are bloodwars or die hard adversaries. For this reason this should effect players as well. Like people take massive exp penalties for grouping with oneanother when they are supposed to be enemies or their stats are lowered or something kind of like rez effects becuase it is the diety placing a mark on them while they cooperate with the enemy. <BR></STRONG><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Personally, I don't mind the faction system as it is right now.  Trust me, it takes a good deal of work (that most people grow tired from doing) to take a dark elf necromancer and make him warmly in a lot of cities.  I know of a Iksar Necromancer who is warmly to most of the cities on Norrath.  He happens to love playing the faction game.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><STRONG><BR>5.) Make it so that there is plenty to do other than fight and make it worth doing. Say your faction goes up for donating and having no money in the bank or if you constantly steal from others your faction goes up with your diety and related things. <BR></STRONG><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Donate a couple gold to Lashun Novashine in Qeynos and see what happens.  Faction raises.  All in the end this does is make it easier for people to gain good faction.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><STRONG><BR>That's just it. For those of you who say you think roleplay is to do whatever you want, you are completely wrong and have lost the concept of TRUE rp. You want to roleplay a good DE but suffer no consequences for your decision or have the penalties be minor. Wow, all you have to do is kill a few orcs and your our friend. You can kill mobs that raise faction with good but do not lower faction with an evil other than that particular mob, and if you are raising faction with good you should lose your faction with evil faster than raising it with the good and I mean much faster.<BR></STRONG><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Sorry to say, but I happen to disagree with you.  I do not believe the true concept of roleplaying is that you have to suffer consequences.  Yes, they are part of it.<P>Roleplaying to me is just what it says.  To play out a role.  I create a character.  I envision his life, his dreams, his desires, his wants, his fears.  Everything about the character.  Yes, I make changes as I play him, but I also stay true to his overall 'story'.  To me, that is the definition of true roleplaying.<P>Go kill guards.  I guarantee you will lose more faction with the side you are killing then you gain with the opposing side.<P>Go take a look around in Neriak.  I am sure you will find a quest that requires you to go out and kill those very same orcs.  Shouldn't you be gaining faction with the dark elves as well?<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><STRONG><BR>That is roleplay. If a mobster sold out his group to the Feds do the feds automatically like them? Is it easier to get the FBI to like you for turning traitor or to get killed for being a traitor?

This type of stuff seems at home there.  Can you stay amiable to the dwarves, while gaining ground with the giants as well?  What about adding the dragons as well?

Figured I'd move this over from the other thread, seeing as Rage wants to start this debate over, I just hope that he remembers that him flaming and personally attacking people will get it locked...<P>_____________<P>Just a couple of things I'd like to say reagarding Ragefactor and both of these threads...<P>The reason that perspective is something that is not understood by others is because it is a personal thing... My perspective of the game, or even of real life is very different than the "majority" but that does not make it any less right in my eyes...<P>Ragefactor didn't actually admit until page three of his post that he was "Waving the flag of role-playing" and in fact had disparaging personal attacks for everyone who held a different perspective than his... My first response to him with my perspective that role-play was how the game is designed and marketed was responded to with his personal attacks at me based on his limited perspective... If he were truly trying to "wave the flag of role-playing" then in my opinion he did a very poor job of it by constantly stating that EQ is for powergaming and not role-play...<P>As to Observer's post here, I think that it was completely unnecessary to bring this discussion up again (and honestly the old man did ramble, as well as making very little sense at times). The only part in his entire description of Rage and the discussion that held true for any of the previous discussion was his analagy about swimming upstream... <P>I noted early on in Ragefactor's post that the sign says "role-playing" (on the box) and maybe it was swimming up stream, but I personally don't care and play for fun... Rage responded by attacking me and my playstyle and then even my "perspective of role-play" saying I was being limited and that being a powergamer would achieve more.. This of course brought up the discussion of him wanting to be an over-achiever in a game, and possibly obsession with that, and later it was revealed possibly why he felt that way (because he did role-play and try and swim against the stream but his roommate might have influenced his thinking to swim with the current instead of against it)...<P>Overall, the last thread deserved to be closed in my opinion, and it was mostly because the original poster could not make his points without attacking people (and that was why people responded with attacks of their own).. <P>The salmon swim upsteam to propagate their species (and I role-play hoping it will catch on and be the norm not the exception), but just because the trip is harder (or possibly more challenging going against the current) it is by no means less satisfying or showing less achievement.. <P>PS Still says RPG on the box, the website, in the FAQ, and I prefer to think I'm not swimming against the stream anyway but that it's the other people who are..   <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">  <P>end paste<BR>___________<P>Just one thing from this thread to comment on that Rage said in this thread:<P>   <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><B>The way you turn this into a RP game(sure there are more)</B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Again this is from your perspective Rage, and turning it into a role-play game is up to the individual <B>NOT</B> the company making the game... They have given us the ruleset, and the environment, and turning it into a role-play game shouldn't be too difficult seeing it already is one..

<B>2)  Your solution isn't a solution.  Imagine an AD&D campaign.  "He has the axe of the dwarvish lords.  I want one too."  "But it is an artifact.  There is only one."  "So what.  I am just as entitled to it as him."</B><P>There should be artifact items in a game but my statement was not including special cases but most cases.  I.E. - higher drop rates for the quest armors of velious since more people will need it and due to lack of variety basically everyone is after the same thing. <P><B>The solution isn't to increase drop rates.  It is to provide a varied way of obtaining an item, through random quests of appropriate difficulty.  </B><P>I like this idea.  I like it alot and can see your point.  Actually I have said things along this line by saying there should be wother ways of getting things besides killing.  I am just saying that due to the lack of variety, you would need to increase drop rates as this decreases camping, as well as providing other items so that not everyone is after the same thing.  Your solution also aids in placing the RP back into RPG <P><B>Not everyone can have everything.  Some items should be limited, though those items may have the unique possibility of teleporting away to the next person.  I can hear the howling now.</B><P>All to true but then you add other unique items.  Maybe a person would prefer to go after the sword of lightning over the sword of Earth.  They must choose one or the other if they want either as they are double lore.  In that example some people may prefer the effects of one blade over the other and thus will try to complete that while others seek the other.  This gives more uniqueness, than the ladder system in which everyone's aim is the same.  You want limited items, make them artifact.<P><B>I am divided on this issue.  The problem is, in reality, people can change.  So can peoples opinions.  Therefore I support faction change.  On the other hand, certain types of behavior should create permanent faction changes that cannot be fixed.  Imagine an evil dark elf participating in a hate plane raid and killing Inny!  Pure trouble.  Other kinds of things should be unrecoverable as well.  Until you don't have to kill your friends for your epic quest, however, I hope they don't change this.</B><P>I agree with you my friend.  People should be able to change but a person must understand that by EQs ow story line DEs should never want to be good.  In AD&D anyone can worship anyone and dark elves were once regular elves that were driven under and their skin changed because of the environment.  In EQ an evil diety made them. <P> I say fine, anything can happen but there would be consequences beyond those currently provided.  People actually jump back and forth on factions and that does not make any sense as that does not happen in real life.  <P>You screw the mob for the FBI the two now BOTH hate you for somethime until you work very very hard for either or and after many years(if ever) you will right things with one of them.<P><B>Final)  If a mobster sold out to the feds, he would be hated by the feds and the mobsters.  If he then joined a police force, and worked hard, helped the feds numerous times, and spent the next 20 years doing good, the feds would like him.  The mob would always hate him and never forgive.</B><P>My point exactly when it comes to factions, now describe that scenario eq style and tell me if it makes sense.<P>Thank you very much for your reply and sensible arguments.  You kick ass.<P>*Now serving..."<P>  <IMG SRC="mad.gif" border="0">  <IMG SRC="mad.gif" border="0"> RageFactor Co.  <IMG SRC="mad.gif" border="0">   <IMG SRC="mad.gif" border="0"> <BR>"Cause life can hit but we hit harder!"<P>Later,<BR>  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" border="0">

<BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Raiv:<BR><STRONG>Sorry to say, but I happen to disagree with you.  I do not believe the true concept of roleplaying is that you have to suffer consequences.  Yes, they are part of it.<P>Roleplaying to me is just what it says.  To play out a role.  I create a character.  I envision his life, his dreams, his desires, his wants, his fears.  Everything about the character.  Yes, I make changes as I play him, but I also stay true to his overall 'story'.  To me, that is the definition of true roleplaying.<P>Go kill guards.  I guarantee you will lose more faction with the side you are killing then you gain with the opposing side.<P>Go take a look around in Neriak.  I am sure you will find a quest that requires you to go out and kill those very same orcs.  Shouldn't you be gaining faction with the dark elves as well?<P> [QUOTE][qb]<BR>That is roleplay. If a mobster sold out his group to the Feds do the feds automatically like them? Is it easier to get the FBI to like you for turning traitor or to get killed for being a traitor?   Can you jump back and forth with the two?  Piss of the mobsters then go back and be friends with them then piss them off again and go to the FBI again then go back to mobsters?  and this is what Rp is about.<BR></STRONG><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR> <BR>Head out to Velious.  This type of stuff seems at home there.  Can you stay amiable to the dwarves, while gaining ground with the giants as well?  What about adding the dragons as well?  Will you not end up losing ground with others?<P>This example is better put into practice in a nice live environment with a storyteller (game master, dungeon master, whatever) who is working with a small group of players rather then a large setting like EverQuest.<P>But then again, that is just my opinion&#8230;[/QB][/QUOTE]<P>You assumed too much.  First off, does adding more variety of items in the game mean that the quests for them must be hack n slash?  That was not a logical course of assumption especially based on my later arguments.<P>Second, who says you can not jump from one faction to another?  Can you do that in Real life?  You can in velious because people are dong it now just so they can get te items they desire from each select group.  Find the mobs that piss the other guy off and wham you will be amiable to them in a few days.<P>killing guards?  Yeah, you do lose faction but do you know how many people( I know plenty) that found some quest to do so that they can raise their faction back up with Freeport and are back to being okay with them?<P>Stop trying to defend EQs faction system as it makes no sense, or atleast it makes little sense at all.

Reread my post Rage, <P>I did not attack you, and gave my opinions (like yopu gave yours)... I did not call you a powergamer, and in fact the only time I referred to you personally was where I spoke about your "limited perspective"...<P>Try again without personal attacks...<P>I am not convinced that Lightning is not you, and you discussing anything with him is not the point... His personal attacks are quite like yours and his profile was created today (and all ten of his posts were in response to you).. Either way, even if this isn't you posting, seeing as this is your thread and you don't want it to get out of control (see title of thread) I would tell your company employee to not flame or he'll be fired...<P>Oh yeah, here's something you missed <B>again</B> that I said and instead focus on attacking me and not muy ideas or opinions:<P><B>Ragefactor didn't actually admit until page three of his post that he was "Waving the flag of role-playing" and in fact had disparaging personal attacks for everyone who held a different perspective than his... My first response to him with my perspective that role-play was how the game is designed and marketed was responded to with his personal attacks at me based on his limited perspective... If he were truly trying to "wave the flag of role-playing" then in my opinion he did a very poor job of it by constantly stating that EQ is for powergaming and not role-play... <I>(I can find that old thread and post my initial post and your response to me too Rage if you want)<P>And this bit from the end:</I><BR>Again this is from your perspective Rage, and turning it into a role-play game is up to the individual NOT the company making the game... They have given us the ruleset, and the environment, and turning it into a role-play game shouldn't be too difficult seeing it already is one..</B>

EQ is a good game, it just takes too damm long to do anything worthwhile or get anything good at higher lvls,  and just gets worse and worse till you have to spend more time at it then at your real life job...   A full time job for an entire year is /83 days played... thats nothing compared to what 50+ players have amassed for A GAME!<P>--------------------<P>57,51,34,27,23,23,21,19,13,10th toons of too many classes..

Just to back Taobob up.  I KNOW for a fact that he, much like myself, is not a powergamer.  I have played with him on numerous occasions and its never about "getting to 60 first or see what Uber item we can get" it really is just about going out and having fun.  Hell I have been level 33 for about a month or so now becuase I am having way too much fun going around and talking to people and helping them.  I spent 2 weeks alone chilling in Halas making armor for newbs. =)  But thats off-subject.  I just wanted to defend Taobob by saying he is in no way a powergamer.<P>--------------------<P><B>/g INC, Mistmoore, all of it.</B><BR>---<BR>"Everything is, at the same time, crazy, normal and conservative.

Hey Rage,<P>If you were really trying to "wave the role-playing flag" you'd be advocating it (like I do) and not making blanket statements like this one: <B>HELLO, this is NOT a roleplaying game it is a powergamers game.</B> <P>Verant is not to blame here, because role-playing is <B>subjective</B> and it's up to the individual player to actually create the role-playing (heck you yourself mentioned any game could be a role-play game)... So why do things need to be changed? So why does something this obvious escape you?? Why are you even coming here, and attacking the people who continue to say that EQ is a role-playing game (like me)?? From what I can see the only reason is because you yourself do not believe that EQ is a role-play game anymore, and <B>YOU</B> are the only one that can change that (not Verant, not the other players, not any enhancement, and certainly not by calling it a powergame)...

Hi, all I'd just like to clear up my reasons for posting on this thread and why I feel it is so important. <P>I'm not saying it isn't a fun game by any means. I had almost 2 years of enjoyment out of it. I've have quit playing simply because after that long almost any game would become boring. I really think this game has helped pave the road for future online games.<P>So the the question I know your asking. Why the heck is this loser still posting if he does not even play anymore? Well I love this new genre of muliplayer games and I know future developers read these boards. What I'm trying to do in this thread in particular is dispell the illusion that this is a roleplaying game. Why you ask? Because if future developers see the popularity of this game,and see people think its a roleplaying game how do you think they are going to make future roleplaying games. Yep just like this one. This game is a dungeon hack like diablo which is fine I don't have a problem with that fact, but if people start thinking that this is a roleplaying game and given the popularity of it developers can and have already mimiced it. Where then will the real roleplaying games come from if this is considered by gamers a roleplaying game? So please folks don't go leting them think this is role-playing and force us to but up with endless dungeon hack clones that will flood the market on the box saying role-playing game. Think hard about your actions and what you want. If your a powergamer fine tell them what this game is and how you like it, you will get a good share of games that way, but please true role-players don't ever call this game a role-playing game because we know its not. We don't want to putup with the endless dungeon hack's. We want a true role-playing game. Demand fuels this market if they think they have the true role-players satisfied they wont change.<P>Sorry to be kinda redundant but I want to drive these facts into peoples skulls. I for one dont want to see this happen.<P>Hehe thanks for the repost rage.

It all depends on how you guys choose to play, and its THAT type of game it becomes, alittle diffrent, for each and every player. This means that everyone impossibly can have the same result in the hand. The magician that only played 10lvls wont see this game in the same way as a lvl56 monk. Verant made this game, and all chars, he can fill you in on it.<P>Humans ! Always on their high horses and consider themself to be fully capable of acting both as judge and executor.

EQ is the closest to "role-play" as anyone's gotten so far (and IMO Ultima and other MUDs were too). <P>It's up to the player to role-play anyway, and the less people do it, the less <B>they</B> consider it as a role-play game, but it's still a RPG (you just can't accept that and alot of powergamers can't because they don't want to admit they play a game the people they called geeks and losers used to play with only dice and their imagination)...

Reasons why I believe EQ is a roleplaying game: (note I'm not saying the system is perfect, nothing I've played yet is, I'm simply providing reasons why EQ appeals to me on a roleplay scale)<P>1-You are given a character which you can customize(to a point).<BR>2-You are then thrown into a massive world filled with all sorts of fantasy. There are various factions in this world, and you have many friends and enemies right from the start.<BR>3-You can make an effect on how others perceive you. You define your role, every action in the game comes with a consequence.(you hit a tiger, a tiger hits you. You kill a guard, the guard's 'buddies' think less of you for it. This is limited but that doesn't mean the game would be better without it).<BR>4-Your character grows with the passage of time(mentally or through leveling up, or both). This growth is again dependent on you.<BR>5-Your character can continue to make friends and enemies, based upon their actions. Your actions DO have consequences, even if some are limited(I agree a pally who acts in a way that isn't fitting with the essence of a paladin should be stripped of his power by his god, and a 'good' shadowknight should also lose his 'evil' powers).<BR>6-there are quests(even if they don't yield the xp they should) that are very involving. Ever just hang out in your hometown, talking to every NPC? Freeport has a LOT more going on than I had found out with one character. (for the record, my favorite quests are rogue quests. just something about sneaking into a hotel to kill someone...)<BR>7-character interaction is a key point in this game(IMO, grouping is needed by almost every character). Character interaction is only as flexible as the people controlling their characters, and this makes me want to see more roleplayers in the game. Still, the 'tools' are there for the using.<P>Again, I'm not saying the game couldn't or shouldn't improve. I'm saying that despite everything that has been geared towards powergaming(verant needs to make a profit, these seem to be the biggest customers), the game was originally intended for roleplaying and continues to offer an atmosphere for the roleplayers. I've known people who roleplayed in a FPS(still do, actually) and it is my belief that EQ offers more potential for roleplaying than Rainbow 6. I think Verant could (and should) make improvements on the game. I also think that as it is right now EQ IS a roleplaying game, if a flawed one(though what game IS perfect?)<P>of course, this is by my judgement of a RPG, and as Islar pointed out different people define different things as RPGs. (ie: final fantasy, rainbow 6, EQ, even myst) (I only consider one of those a 'real' RPG.)<P>--------------------<P>Life without honor is life in vain. -Ravell

Taobob before I reply to your counter argument I would like to know a few things. What do you consider a role-playing game? Define this as well as you can. Also answer these.<P>1. Do you consider Quake a role-playing game why or why not?<P>2. Do you consider Diablo a role-playing game why or why not?<P>3. Do you consider Pandora's Box (its a puzzle game if you dont know about it dont need to answer) why or why not?<P>4. Do you consider Starcraft a role-playing game why or why not?<P><BR>These will help me understand just what you mean by role-playing. I ask this since you have some unique perspectives on things. Were you the same taobob who said everquest has no downtime on the old GenDis boards?<P>Thanks for the effort. I think it will help me and many others that don't understand your logic on role-play.

This thread is much more positive than the other one.  I truly hope for the purity of good and sound debate that it remains this way.  <P>Several things about this thing is that people seem to be forgetting main poits of the argument of those that claim this is not a roleplaying game.<P>First of all it is how you define a roleplaying game.  The definiton of a roleplaying game must eliminate other genre's or else it is no longer a definition as it is not defining anything.  The defininition must include elements in which it generates the prefix of roleplaying.<P>The definition also is the portion that includes only the elements found in every roleplaying game.  If part of the definition does not exist in a roleplaying game then by definition it would eliminate that game as a roleplaying game.  <P>Keep in mind because the definition holds true for all roleplaying games, the definition would not include special features of either game.  Something like possesing artifact equipment.<P>Previous definitions:<P>A game that allows for you to assume a role other than that of yourself.<P>This definition is to general in the sense that this is any game on the market.  It is also too limited in the sense that a person can roleplay themself in a situation.<P>Another person that it is a game that allows you to assume a role and has a background and again we find this is ever game that is on the market today from fighter to action to shooter to hack -n- slash.<P>What roleplay is when a person assumes the role of something and applies that role in some kind of realistic situational(we old folks make up words) cause and effects with in some type of situation.<P>A person may roleplay themself being stuck in a tree.  People do not fly, so it would not be accurate roleplay if a person roleplays themself and say that they fly out of a tree.  Perhaps a gentle person roleplays themself as a bank robber.  They probably are not roleplaying accurately if they shoot the tellr for no reason as this is outside of the boundries of the given charcter thus they did not "play" the role properly.<P>Now in a roleplaying game, it is the structure for which roleplay occurs.  In its very design it will encourage roleplay much like at a job it will most likely encourage people to work so they do not lose money, therefore most people at a job will be working as the design encourages it.<P>A roleplaying game establishes a set of rules based of generated backgrounds and histories and based of these rules there must be consequences when a person goes against the norm just as it is in real life as essentially speaking a roleplaying game is another form of a real life environment.<P>I think what is throwing a lot of people off is the fact that this is a medievel game.  For some reason or another people automatically associate roleplaying game with medieval and I believe this is due to the game AD&D.  <P>Everquest, is not a roleplaying game.  Although it does establish backgrounds and histories, it does not generate realistic rules for what they themselves created.<P>The game also does not encourage roleplaying and because this is the main focus and point of the definition this is what most certainly de rails Everquest to be a roleplaying game.<P>It has been stated many many times and it still holds true.  You know the design of something because people are more than likely to choose the path of least resistance.  If majority of the people playing a game are powergammers thanthis would in turn mean that the game's design is in fact a non roleplaying game as people flow with design.<P>It is not logical to see the clear differences in numbers between powergammers and roleplayers and say that it is a roleplaying game.  <P>Another misconception, not everything you read is entirely true.  Everquest is marketed as a roleplaying game but does that make it a roleplaying game?  Do you know how many companies are marketed as America's favorite this and the world's greatest that?  It is no different in this case here.<P>I do not believe anyone is attacking the fun element of the game and I believe that this is also aiding in the clouding of the truth that is trying to be shown here.  Anything can be made fun or enjoyable as that is simply perception based, but understand this has absolutely nothing to do with what is and what is not.  <P>Your emotions have no bearing on whether something is or it is not.  Whether Xmod2, or Lightning or any of you are having fun in Everquest really has no bearing on the point trying to be made.  I do not believe that either of the people you speak against said they were not having fun.  Assumptions cloud truth.  When you are not sure on the stand point of another simply ask.  I have read and see no implication of anyone not having fun. <P>There are only two things that are being said in light of the roleplaying aspects of Everquest:<P>1.) Everquest is not a roleplaying game.<P>points for this.<P>-it posseses the element of a roleplayin game but so does every game that exists <P>-based on other roleplaying games and taking the things that they all have in common, one finds that of those things that ALL of the other roleplaying games share, EQ lacks one or two of those things.(You can not define something and have one thing out of that list of inclusion that does not meet all of the requirements with in that list)<P>-The simple question of which populates the game more roleplayers or powergammers?  This tells you what type of game you are in as people flow path of least resistance(in general).  <P>2.)Everquest should be a roleplayin game.  <P>-Since it is being advertised as a roleplaying game then those that are roleplaying should reap the rewards and prosper better than anyone who tries to go against design.<P>-It should be changed so that it will be a roleplaying game.  <P>Those that are arguing against these points are arguing against a change.  You are saying that you desire the game to remain exactly as it is.  I will not accuse anyone here of being a powergammer but I do think that we are simply having misunderstandings of what each person is trying to say.<P>The game may be fun and a person does choose whether or not they are having fun but it is the developers who decide what kind of game we are having fun hence the name developers.  <P>If you want the sheep to head north do you just place up arrows and signs that say north?  No, you have a dog that will try to catch them and keep them in line.  You are there to help keep them in line.  Maybe a few sheep will stil stray as this is life as not everyone will do everything as it is supposed to be no matter how much encouragement you use but most will and this is a universal rule.  <P>Encouragement encourages towards its design and while most will follow the path of encouragement some will not.  <P>Why would Everquest be the only exception to this rule?  <P>I have many many examples as to where this rule applies( I had better as it is universal), but I have rambled enough for the night.  Maybe next time.    <P>Eventhough you said I may use the logo, I will not as I have cause you enough trouble. As if you do not have enough trouble and ridicule to deal with you now posses my burdens as well and for this I fully apologize.<P>/e sips from his "Chang Wufei" mug<P>I hope all of you sleep well tonight and have a pleasant time through out all of your days.  Goodnight.

I am going to ignore for now the post made by Observer, because he is anything but an observer and contradicts himself more than once... His two points were that Everquest is not a role-playing game (for reasons as inane as the population not being a role-playing one) and that Everquest should be a role-playing game (which it should be, but that does not mean the game needs to be changed when it is instead the players thoughts that should change)...<P>Now to the comments that were made by The Chicken (another 'person' that believes every word Rage says is law) I will not answer your numbered questions about what games I consider "role-playing" games, because in a sense all games require you assume a "role"... <P>The question that I will answer about role-play is this one:<B>What do you consider a role-playing game? </B><P>The type of game that I consider a "role-playing" one is another subjective opinion based on perspective... I played Dungeons and Dragons (the original not Advanced or Edition2 or 3) when I was seven years old, and it was about creating a character whose story <B>you</B> wrote... As role-playing games progressed, I played many pen & paper games and even GM'd them (and I created many of my own campaigns)... Role-playing to me is being given "the setting" and then creating your characters adventures, and EQ has that... There is no linear story, because everything is about decisions you make and the story <B>the individual</B> creates... <P>I honestly question the reasoning behind "powergaming" because it is in effect writing a very boring story of a person sitting behind a computer spending hours playing a game (and not of an individual character).. Twinking and powerleveling equate to the same thing to me, destroying the "story" of you character by making it a story about the person behind the machine(because you can avoid the struggle and interaction with new "characters" while comparing the accomplishments of the player and not the character)..  <P>I have tremendously more fun interacting with others, working together and struggling than I do sitting in dead silence while solo, waiting for mana/health to recover or something to "spawn"... I want to play a game (any game) for fun, and this must be fun to some people, but I have more fun joking with others about their characters, and acting as my character then I do the person behind the computer.. <P>I don't discuss the person behind the monitor, because if I wanted to do that it'd be little more than a chat room with graphics (which was a draw to this game for people who played First Person Shooters)... I talk about the character I'm playing as, because I am him in game, and the people who describe their other characters and their accomplishments are considered lunatics who've adventured too much (and therefore have split personalities).. I also don't complain about Verant or real life in game because that makes no sense in Norrath either..<P>One question that also equates to this same discussion was asked by the Chicken, and it was this:<B>I ask this since you have some unique perspectives on things. Were you the same taobob who said everquest has no downtime on the old GenDis boards?</B><P>Yes, I am the same taobob who said EQ has no downtime on the old GenDis boards, and I have always firmly believed that "downtime" is an excuse the players make for creating their own boredom by not writing a believable story.. "Downtime" is something that can also be changed by role-playing and interaction, because then it isn't downtime it's part of the characters story... It all comes down to the way that the <B>player</B> decides to direct their character(s) and people who complain about boredom should either change it and make it exciting for themselves or quit complaining and deal with what they do to themselves... <P>By the way I still am of the opinion that Rage created a bunch of different profiles, then again it also could just be that all these posters not only share the same <B>exact</B> opinion, but contradict themselves the same exact way, and write in a very similar style...

Hahaha!  KK!  Oh well.  I dunno guys.  For Ragey to be three people, sound like three different people is wierd to me as a thouht I mean.  I don't remember a time when I wondered if somebody was someoneelse or any o that stuff.  <P>Seein it here though I started doin a little lookin into it me self.     <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"> I don't think any of us sound remotely the same or type the same but cause of the fact that we share super similar beliefs and stuff like that I can see why maybe a person might think a bunch us are the same person but then I got to thinkin and realized the same could be said about a couple a people.  Then I started playin with those little icons around our names and **** like that and found that ya learn alot about people and it even shows times a person posts and i order for what you guys say is true to be right or whatever this guy who is all these people would have to be up 24hrs a day every single day.  That don't sound right.<P>Anywayz I don't think he is three people but whatever.  I'm gonna try to refrain from callin you all ****** or anything like that cause I don't want to take this board up but you guys sound like a bunch a sore losers now.  GEEZ people will ya just find something about what is bein said instead of going all into this s***? I mean ain't that kinda stupid when we were talking about EQ bein roleplay or not?<P>Who gives a [/i]fill in blank[i](OOH coding!)about who is saying what or whatever when we should be worried about what is bein said?  I think your wrong and you think I'm wrong about who the people are but lets just droppit and get back to topic PUUUULEESE!<P>Proud member here<===<P>  <IMG SRC="mad.gif" border="0"> RageFactor Co.   <IMG SRC="mad.gif" border="0"> <P>I'm outtie!<BR>  <IMG SRC="tongue.gif" border="0">
