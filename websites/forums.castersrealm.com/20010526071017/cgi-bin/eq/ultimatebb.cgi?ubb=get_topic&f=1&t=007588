Heya all;<BR>I am a vetrin MMORPG player who plays Asherons Call. Though I like AC alot I like adventuring and exploring new games as well. Espically MMORPG's. Soon my friends and I may be moving to EQ for a little to try the game out. I cant wait to feel the way I did when I entreed AC for the first time. Sitting on a mountain top watching the sun rise over the desert town of Al Arquas. Then the adventure and learning of the game that followed. I will be moving to EQ to experinece this once again in a diffrent game system. However I am doing my research now and trying to avoid some hardships I experienced in AC.<P>One thing about me is I love magic. I almost all my chars in any rpg be it D&D or Star Wars, Rifts, Vampire have been magic users. I am aware that the mage class is the hardest class to begin with and becomes the most powerful in the end...well in most games. One problem I encountered in AC was that mages though in the end they do the most damage, they have a very limited group of enemies they can kill for xp since there are so many foe's in the game now that have an Insanely uber magic resistance, and even some that are totally immune to magic altogether and ignore your magical protections. That on top of the very very long casting times on the higher level spells in the game made the mages a shadow in comparison to melee until you get to a special island made for the most powerful in the game (level 45+). With that the enemies the mages fought often did not drop expensive loot so you would often be broke fighting just so you can restock your spell comps for the next outing. And even then they didnt last long. In AC melee could even become supream in there class and almost as good as a mage of the same level in there schools of magic which they have trained. There where just too many cons in AC for mages. I made several mages out of the many chars I made and got fustrated with the nerfs they put on the mages because they where too powerful when the game started.<P><BR>In short I wish to avoid this experience again. I dont want to make another mage just to find that every other class is better in the middle, and end. In your honest opinion all is it worth being a Wizard in EQ, or do most other classes totally beat out the wizard in the end? Do you have to spend several minutes preparing for every battle just so you can live through it? I would like to hear your honest cons and pros of this class and some comparisons on how they stand on various levels with other classes. <P>Also:<BR>Where can I read up about the magic system in EQ and the melee system?<P>What problems do mages have to deal with, how do they learn new spells, do they require spell components and if so how often do you have to restock generally (very often, rarley, etc) and how much does a spell comp restock cost (too much...it's where most of my money goes, a small fraction, about half my winnings)<P>How can I learn how your 'Groupings' (I think that is what you call a party in EQ) work (its the equivlent to fellowships in AC). I wanna know how xp and treasure is divided. Pros and cons too.<P>How good is the player trade system. <P>Are trade skills good money makers?<BR>Are trade skills in good demand by others in EQ?<BR>Would you likely find trade skills on a main character?<P>If someone can help point me in the right direction it would be helpful. <P>DO I HAVE TO BUY ALL THE EXPANSIONS OF EQ TO START OF DO I START WITH ORIGINAL GAME PACK AND BUY OTHER EXPANSIONS AND I GO UP IN LEVEL?<P>Is EQ in just one bing world or is it divided up into several servers that are clones of the same world?<P>Thanks<BR>Magius of Wintersebb<BR>Magius Majere of Solclaim<BR>Palan Majere of Solclaim<BR>etc, etc all from AC<P><BR>--=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>My observations & and opinions of EQ so far:<P>*Looks like a great game, very diffrent from ac, a whole new world to explore!  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" border="0"><P>*Graphics are nice  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"><P>*Not sure but the 'Groups' in EQ look more promising then the 'Fellowships' of AC so far.   <IMG SRC="confused.gif" border="0"><P>*Magic system looks better then AC. No more melee players who are as good as or better then a mage of the same level   <IMG SRC="cool.gif" border="0"><P>* The Developers look to have isolated themselves and dont seem to pay attention to the player base enough. Unlike in AC where the devs are almost you best buddies   <IMG SRC="frown.gif" border="0"><P>* Not many sites out there to teach you the EQ system for those who have never played it before. Unlike in AC where you can find it so easy and many templates to boot.   <IMG SRC="mad.gif" border="0">

You'll probably get a LOT of replies to your post, but here are my two cents:<P>For some great information on the casting classes, check out the Caster's Realm site at eq.castersrealm.com  Do a bit of research and you'll find answers to all your questions!<P>If you love magic then I think you'll really like Everquest, though I would advise you to research the wizard class thoroughly before making that choice.  (Wizards feel they are not well balanced compared to other caster classes.)<P>The most versatile and group friendly magic class is enchanter.  That's what I play.  We get more total spells than any other class in the game, and we are practically essential to groups between levels 30 and 50.<BR>That said, enchanters are NOT damage dealers; we practice what has come to be known as "crowd control", meaning we mesmerize creatures so our party can fight only one thing at a time.  It's dangerous, yet exhilirating work.<P>If you want to blast away with powerful spells you might want to think about a mage.  They get the second best DD (direct damage) spells AND they get pets!  If you don't know, pets are summoned companions that will fight for you.  Mages get four to choose from: earth, air, fire, and water.<P>Comparing EQ and AC:  They are very different games so give yourself some time to adjust.  (Play a character to level 10 or so before you make up your mind about the game.)  Here are a few major differences:<P>1) The monsters that can give you experience are usually quite dangerous.  You will never have the Diablo experience of walking around and wiping out everything that moves.  (This is why groups are so important in EQ.)<P>2) Everquest is probably the most challenging game I've ever played.  If you want to be good at it you'll need to play a lot and read the message boards for strategies and tips.  (I kind of like this aspect of the game, but it turns some people off.)<P>3)  It is MUCH easier to solo in AC.  All classes in EQ can solo at the early levels, but that will change as they get to higher levels.  If being able to solo to 60 is important to you you'll probably want to play a druid, a necromancer, or a mage.  I've heard that shaman can also solo pretty well, too.<P>4)  Dying at mid/high levels is a real pain, especially if you are used to AC.  Don't do it.  ;-)

Well, first off magic users offensively speaking are not the most "powerful" in the endgame in EQ either (endgame being levels 50-60).  Stuff you fight for loot post-50 has so many hitpoints that on most bigger raids melee ends up doing 80% of the total damage at least.  Rogues (thief class) and monks especially are the big damage kings at this stage.  Both get special attacks that do insane damage.  For rogues it's backstab which can do 300+ per stab and monks get special flying thunder kicks and whatnot.  Wizards and magicians and necromancers can toss in a few direct damage spells on big fights but even if they stick it's not going to make the difference between victory and defeat for the group usually.  Enchanters, the fourth "pure caster" class are a different story.  They have never been touted as offensive casters so they are not hampered by this turn of events the way the other three classes are, and in fact they are still very much wanted in the endgame if not downright necessary. <P>The way magic works in EQ is simple - you have a pool of potential mana at your disposal and when you use it up you have to meditate to get it back.  One of the problems with high level casters is our mana pool doesn't increase appreciably at the very highest levels, certainly not at the same geometric rate that NPCs' hitpoints do.  A wizard in a level 35 group is a great asset because he/she can do proportionately big damage to the level 30ish NPCs the group is fighting.  At 55 the wizard might have double the mana but mobs have 5 or 10 times the hitpoints.  Do the math =P  Now couple in the fact that mobs at very high levels tend to resist a lot, and many are simply completely resistant to magic.  The utility of the offensive casters gets marginal.  <P>That said, from 1 to 50 casters in EQ are just fine no matter which class you pick.  Most folks don't get up much past level 50 anyway so for probably 90% of anyone who ever starts an EQ character you won't be affected by these problems.  It used to be that the pure casters were absolute kings of damage, but when the first EQ expansion came out literally tons of new melee weapons started dropping very commonly on higher level NPCs, and many of these dwarfed the stats of the best weapons in the game pre-expansion.  Combined with new super-armor (also from expansions), tanks suddenly became much, much more powerful than before while casters basically stayed in the same place. <P>As for spells, it's much simpler than in AC.  The vast majority are for sale at vendors in your guild houses.   You get new spells every 4th or 5th level your whole career up to 50, and when you hit the magic level you simply buy your next line of spells.  A few are research only but researching spells is a simple matter of collecting the right pages and combining them in a container.  Once you have your spells, you "scribe" them into your spellbook.  To use a spell you "memorize" it by placing it in one of 8 slots.  Once there it's ready to be cast and recast over and over until you run out of mana.   It's also easy to swap out a new spell for an old one in your 8 slots.  All in all a very simple system.  <P>Groups can be anywhere from 2 to 6 in size.  Experience is split evenly among the group members, weighted by level (higher levels get proportionally more experience from a kill), but there is a "group bonus" multiplier that everyone gets based on how many are in the group.  I think with a full group of six it's 20% or something like that (4% per each member not counting yourself).  Loot is generally handled my having a tank master loot coin and trivial items and then he/she splits evenly with everyone at the end.  Or, you can all turn on "autosplit" which will automatically give a share of coin to each group member when anyone loots the NPC.  Anyone in the group has the ability to loot a mob that group killed.  Non-group members are barred from looting that NPC for a few minutes.  If two or more groups or solo players have damaged an NPC, the group or player that does the most total damage gets the kill and the loot rights and exp.  Good items are usually awarded either by who needs/will use, or possibly by everyone rolling a random number and highest/lowest wins depending on what's agreed to beforehand.  <P>Big raids against the best NPCs often consist of 3 or more groups of six fighting as one big group.  In this case the regular rules apply and only one of the smaller grouplets will get the kill exp and loot rights.  <P>Trade skills are not generally profitable at all except they are becoming implemented more and more for high end quests so you may end up learning some trades out of necessity.  Used to be jewelcraft could make you big money if you were an enchanter but now with the servers so old and magic jewelry never being destroyed there is a glut of stuff out there and it's no longer hugely profitable giving it  takes several thousand platinum to get to master level.  Some skills are fun to do, however, and can be worth your while in a roleplaying sense.  I think Verant is trying hard to make the tradeskill system more usefull overall.  For example, recently they made it so master bakers can whip up certain dishes that give the consumer bonuses to their stats.  <P>I've played both EQ and AC and personally I preferred Everquest.  It simply has a hard to define aspect of immersiveness and fun to I just didn't find in AC.  If you like casters, go ahead and make a wizard or magician or necromancer and knock yourself out  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0">  (Enchanter isn't the ideal first character as they are subtle and complex and frustrating to learn when you're completely new to the game even though they are ultimately the 'most wanted' caster'.  <P>Oh yeah, you might also look into one of the wisdom-based caster classes like shaman or druid.  Druids especially get some damn respectable offensive spell power of their own as well as some of the niftiest utility spells in the game, and they are among the best solo players.  <P>That also reminds me, one thing you will notice about EQ is that unlike AC, most classes find it extremely difficult to solo.  Verant has a thing that solo=bad, so except for a few classes (mage, druid, necro)soloing is generally going to be a lot more trouble than it's worth.  Some will dispute this and claim they soloed a monk/warrior/etc up to 50, but 99% of the time that is the person's 4th character and was decked out in level 55 gear from day 1.  As a new player coming in with nothing you will find soloing difficult at best past level 10 or so. <P>Good luck and welcome to Norrath!

I have never played AC, so I cannot tell you the differences between the two.<P>However, I can tell you about the casters of EQ.<P><B>Magician</B> - A class with the ability to conjure a huge variety of things with ease, including the best pets in the game.  They also dish out quite a lot of magical damage, similar to the Wizard.  At high levels, they receive the ability to conjure other players.<P><B>Wizard</B> - The masters of magical damage, along with the ability to teleport.<P><B>Necromancer</B> - Masters of the undead.  They have very many powerful spells, many relating to undead.  They have a wide range of magical damage spells, and come with a pet.  They are considered one of the top soloers.<P><B>Enchanter</B> - The support class.  The Enchanter has the most desired buffs in the game, such as spells that increase attack speed and mana regeneration.  They also have the ability to 'mez' a mob, which puts it in some sort of trance in which it does not attack for a set period.  These two attributes make an Enchanter quite helpful for dungeon fighting.<P><B>Druid</B> - Most would agree, Druid is the easiest class in the game.  A Druid is a priest, with the ability to heal along with a wide range of buffs.  HP buffs, Damage Shields, HP Regeneration and Spirit of Wolf, a spell which increases your running speed for a set duration.  They also have a nice range of magical damage spells.<P><B>Shaman</B> - Another priest class, also has the largest amount of buffs, for nearly every stat.  As a priest, they have the ability to heal.  They also are known for their mob debuffs, such as Slow, to slow the mob's attack speed.  Shamen also receive a pet, and are considered the best soloers past level 50.<P><B>Cleric</B> - A priest and the best healer out of all the priests.  They have a minimal soloing ability, but can stand quite well aganist undead.  They also hold the best HP buffs.<P>--------------------<P><B>Logix Spybreak</B><BR><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=63676" TARGET=_blank>55th Dark Elven Beguiler</A><BR>Undead Lords<P><B>Lise Auror</B><BR>23rd Human Monk<BR>Ayonae Ro

I'd like to say that all the replies so far have been very good. EQ is a game that you will love after you learn the ropes, then you will love it even more once you start to be able to buy good items for your character(s). I think that the best 'feeling' you get is when your character starts to really gain power over monsters that would have posed problems in the past. <P>The rare items in the game will make you wanna play even more, "when my character gets weapon 'X' or spell 'X' its gonna be curtains for the monsters, I WILL HAVE REVENGE!" etc. etc. However you attain these items/spells either by fighting the specific monster that drops them or selling other loots and saving the cash, you will always get a nice feeling of accomplishment. <P>There's just <b>too much</b> todo in EQ. A good example would be what I did with my level 45 enchanter, I took a break from levelling and trading to go exploring, there were so many zones (areas of the game world) that I had not seen and others that I had not explored deeply, I was supprised at what a nice change this was from the usual rush of getting to level 60 (the top level any character can attain). <P>You don't have to be level 60 to have a good time tho, many even argue that the mid levels of the game are the most fun. From level 1 to 10 you will most probably solo (not really as fun as grouping imho), but after level 8 or 10 you can start grouping (full group consists of 6 players) and here is where you get a feeling of 'being a part of the action', "That monster was tough! I believe that if I wasn't here my group might have been in trouble" etc. <P>If you like RPG or MMORPG type games, then you'll love EQ, hope to see you online soon. <P>to answer some questions: <P>the EQ trade system is currently going through alot of ups and downs due to the expansions that are being released (certain old world items dropping in price) <P>some trade skills make you really good money, others are more for fun, the ones that make you most money also cost the most to get to a good skill in. <P>the original Everquest game will allow you to get up to level 50, Ruins of Kunark will allow you to reach level 60, Scars of Velious is more for level 35+ players, monsters here are very tough, but the rewards (items dropped by monsters) are better and worth more. <P>A word about the classes in the game: <BR>a level 60 warrior is an AMAZING character, just as amazing as ALL other charcters, but each character depends strongly on the others (not only for gaining XP points, but mainly for gaining great items or fighting in dangerous zones). A level 60 warrior can do nothing deep in a dungeon alone, but if he takes a cleric, enchanter, wizard etc. he will shine! (as long as all group members do their jobs correctly, hehe). <P>I think you can find all the info you need on <b>this</b> website (http://eq.castersrealm.com) and on Everlore (http://www.everlore.com). <P>Don't ask others for advice on choosing a character, read up and try to decide which one(s) will best suit your playing style.<P>Good luck finding your magic info  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>--------------------<P><B>Fume</B> 45th Gnome Enchanter - <B>Corellia Benevolentia</B> 30th Human Paladin - <B>Sheymus</B> 26th Hafling Druid - <B>Keikan Foo</B> 23rd Iksar Monk - <B>Thundorr Helmcrusher</B> 20th Barbarian Warrior - <B>Tsuki</B> 23rd Wood Elf Rogue - <B>Xume Uberfiend</B> 22nd Gnome Necromancer - <B>Poob</B> 7th Troll Warrior

Thanks for all the advice guys. Pretty much from what I find is that AC is a total opposite to EQ as far as game mechanics go. However the elements are the same. I have had lots of experience with a trade system where items are always dropping in price and stuff though it was never really for money, but for items such as motes and shards in AC which are used to construct some of the greatest quest items around.<P>  EQ seems to hold alot of suprises. That is somthing to look forward to  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"> I do like the change of extreams from a solo baised game to a group baised game however forced it may be. So now I begin the process of convincing my friends to join me. Our own pre built party as we had in AC. <P>One more question...How big are the 'Zones'. I really hope they are pretty big cuz I am used to a no zone environment.

Some zones are huge like West Commons and Lake of Ill Omen, and could take you several minutes to cross them without SoW (Spirit of the Wolf (a spell cast by druids to hasten your travels)). Most of the dungeons are small and maze-like, but more dense in monsters, this is why you'd need a good party to 'break and enter'. Moving from 1 zone to another can get anoyying at first, but you really get used to it, wow, imagine if there wasn't any zones, when would I go pee?? lol<P>--------------------<P><B>Fume</B> 45th Gnome Enchanter - <B>Corellia Benevolentia</B> 30th Human Paladin - <B>Sheymus</B> 26th Hafling Druid - <B>Keikan Foo</B> 23rd Iksar Monk - <B>Thundorr Helmcrusher</B> 20th Barbarian Warrior - <B>Tsuki</B> 23rd Wood Elf Rogue - <B>Xume Uberfiend</B> 22nd Gnome Necromancer - <B>Poob</B> 7th Troll Warrior

[[Moving from 1 zone to another can get anoyying at first]]<P>I came to EQ from Ultima Online, and the first time I hit a zone line I distinctly remember thinking: "Oh my dear lord, you have GOT to be kidding me."<P>But Fume is right, everyone gets used to it pretty quickly.  The biggest annoyance, for me, is that the zone lines are invisible and sometimes I'll stumble through one accidentally.  Worse, I've gotten turned around and gone right back into the zone I just left!  Grrrrrr.

Zone lines are also a blessing - they are a means of escape from death.  MOB's cannot cross a zone boundry, so in the post 50 levels you will have a lot of groups and/or solo artists fighting in dungeons right at the zone for safety reasons.<P>I wanted to touch briefly on spell components-<BR>All classes which have spell requiring a reagent or component can be purchased from vendors in every city, or looted off extremely common MOBs in many zones.<P>To my knowledge, there is not a single spell in the game requiring more than one type of component to cast, though some spells like the magician series of armor class / regeneration buffs do require up to 4 of a particular component.<P>I would strongly suggest you to check into playing a Druid as your first character.  They are the most versatile class in the game, having these abilities:<P>1)Healing, surpassed only by clerics, equal to shaman<P>2)Direct Damage magic, surpassed only marginally by wizards, tied with magicians.  <P>2a) Area Effect Magic, surpassed only marginally by wizards, tied with magicians.<P>3)Damage over Time magic, surpassed only by shaman and marginally by necromancers<P>4)Player Movement enhancer, surpassed only marginally by shaman (or bards if grouped with them)<P>5)MOB movement reductioin, best in game<P>6)MOB movement prevention (root), best in game<P>7)Teleport, both group and self-only, tied with wizards<P>8)Group evacuation teleport, tied with wizards<P>9)Buffs:  Player Hit Point (2nd best), Armor Class(3rd best), Regeneration(best), Magic Resists(2nd best), Levitation(best), Underwater Breathing(best), Infravision(best), Player unresistable damage shields (surpassed marginally by magicians), etc..<P>As you can see, the Druid is the jack of all trades, with more offensive, defensive and utility abilities of any other class in the game by far.  Druids have the extreme ability to solo, and are wanted in groups throughout all levels.  The only thing druids cannot do is melee after level 15 or so, like all primary magic users.<P>-Anthe<BR>55 Elementalist (magician)<P>-Limper<BR>40 Warrior<P>-Bandoslav<BR>35 Cleric<P>-Drokule<BR>22 Druid<P>-Krapola<BR>25 Ranger

The most useful and desired classes in the game are cleric enchanter, and warrior.  If you were going to start playing with some friends, i would suggest that 3 of you pick these classes.  the other classes also have useful benefits, but those 3 are considered "key" classes.<P>For the real tough dungeons you pretty much have to have a cleric and enchanter, you can get by without a warrior, but the warrior takes damage the best.

First of all, if you say "mage" in eq, everybody thinks you're referring to the magician class, it's better to call them casters, then when referring to magicians use mage...<P><i>Where can I read up about the magic system in EQ and the melee system?</i><BR>You're here  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" border="0"> castersrealm has a great section on each class, read up, and enjoy<P><i>What problems do mages have to deal with, how do they learn new spells, do they require spell components and if so how often do you have to restock generally (very often, rarley, etc) and how much does a spell comp restock cost (too much...it's where most of my money goes, a small fraction, about half my winnings)</i><P>New spells you buy off merchants or research, or get as loot from mobs in the higher levels, then click on your book, and it scribes it, then you click on your memorization slots (you can have 8 spells out at a time) and you memorize it... Some spells require components, but unless you're a cleric casting hit point shields all the time, it doesn't take up much of your cash flow.  My magician only has to restock on gems every week or so if I'm playing a few hours a day, actually I haven't restocked in over a month cause I'm not playing much lately.<P><i>How can I learn how your 'Groupings' (I think that is what you call a party in EQ) work (its the equivlent to fellowships in AC). I wanna know how xp and treasure is divided. Pros and cons too.</i><BR>EQ is built around grouping.  Grouping is the best way to get anything done.  Loot in groups is decided by the group, sometimes there is a master looter who loots every corpse of everything you kill then splits it up evenly, sometimes you take turns looting, sometimes it's FFA just don't be greedy...  XP is divided depending on your level, the highest levels get the biggest share of exp.  But the difference from the highest level to the lowest level on how much exp you get isn't that much different.<P><i>How good is the player trade system. </i><BR>Usually each server has an 'auction' zone, where you go and auction the stuff you want to sell...  Most stuff you sell for platinum, or trade for other items of close value, it works pretty good.  Tho in my opinion the economy is falling apart cause more and more stuff is being introduced to it without ever loosing any.<P>I gotta go now, hehe just noticed the time... if I get time later tonight I'll respond to the rest of your questions.<P>--------------------<P>-Saethan<P><I>Your basis everything belongs to us!</I> (All your base are belong to us run through the alta vista translator a cpl times)

Wow you got to be the first mage to say that his down time in ac was little. It takes around 5 minutes in later levels to buff so that you live through your encounters. In that time you CAN kick any enemies ass that you encounter IF its magic D is reasonable. Unfortunatly all the new enemies in the game have insane magic D. Spells are too slow casting in ac so warriros tend to get your kills as well. BTW you should know that the down time increases with level and becoms up to 50% of your spells endurance meaning that you only get around 5-10 minutes of hunting before you have to buff again. Yes the dreaded comp restocks are very heavy and have to be done every about 3-4 buff runs meaning and costing about as much as you made or more on that hunting session. Maby the mages where decent over there when you played them but not anymore. In AC the mages feel left out though they have been getting some attention recently. They still refuse to address the real issues of mages and continue to make other classes better. This is due to demand since most of there populas is fighters of the Unarmed Combat, sword and dagger now (yup they imporved them). They cannot nerf so to speak any of thease skills to make them back in the proper balance with mages in AC cuz it would piss too many off. However AC is opposite to EQ in most ways and instead of nerfing like they do in EQ they just Make everything 'better' so to speek in AC except those skills they dont think need imporving (this is how they answered the situation where the cheepest skill UA was the best. They just made every other weapon type better so that UA would not be the best anymore without pissing the populas...Again leaving behind mages). Unfortnuatly about mages soloing in AC its only half true. In later levels You can solo on Aerifile Island though in mid levels (20-40) you cannot really solo at all save for a few select creatures (tusker guards and slaves) since they are week and give good xp. Other then that you can solo weeklings and get no xp. Mages in AC definitly cannot quest alone since they dont have the manna and very little area spells so they get swarmed easily and on top of that they have to buff still weather they are fighting tough or easy enemies since either can do alot of damage to you if you dont. I dont know how things are in EQ compared to this but I do think they will share some similar problems and I just wanted to let you know that things are not quite as you said in AC. However I do agree the fact that the games are complete opposite. AC is solo baised (pretty much since it is not worth grouping in ac), where as EQ is group forced. AC nerfs by making everything else more uber where as EQ nerfs stuff by making it worse (each is just as bad, well AC's methiod I think could get worse since it creates more problems). Each game is good in its own ways and each one has its downfalls. I will not say AC is better then EQ or vice versa. They are both first Gen MMORPG's and each is done well and in its own unique way. It all depends what you like. I for one dont enjoy soloing as I did in ac. I was always behind in levels cuz I got board of just leveling since I didnt really socialize when I did so I hanged around in towns with my friends and did quests. In EQ its grouping and I look forward to team tactics since I like that. I do have experience as a mage in many systems so yes I am used to mages being very weak and vunerable espically in the beginning levels. EQ is kinda like dnd in more ways then AC with is more unique (diffrent monsters and lore and such). It uses the same concepts from DnD such as the fact that no one individual can fight at or above his level alone since they will likely die due to swarmage from enemies or just the foe's pure strengths. DnD is a party baised system and so is EQ. DnD is a class baised system as is EQ.<P>Two Diffrent MMORPG's <BR>Each Great in there own way<BR>Each Bad in there own way<BR>Both are fun<BR>None better then the other<P>That is the way I look at it. Your loyalties may lie with EQ because you liked it better. However this is a view of someone who has studied both and compared. I have been doing my research on EQ for a long long time and asked my friends extensivly about it (that play it). It all depends on what you like party or solo, DnD style monsters or Unique.

Level 60 pet to be exact, two bonechips and a peridot, just don't ask necros how much they like that pet, ugly scene ;-)<P>Having myself switched from AC to EQ a little while ago I hope to offer a tiny bit of advice.<P>In AC it was all about a small group of players taking on a large group of critters (higher level critters I might add).<P>In EQ its all about a large group of players taking on a very small (usually one or two) group of critters (usually lower level).<P>It doesn't seem that much but I can tell you honestly that its one heck of a shock :-)  As you get higher in level you'll die at least once to something that if you could have killed it, would have yielded no xp at all. That's always a danger in EQ.  In AC eventually "green cons" won't be a problem to get rid of, a bother more then anything else.<P>I read briefly over your complaints about AC and a few things come to mind.  No offence but you seem like the type of char who in AC asked the devs for levitation spells so you could float above the lowly melee ;-)  Well you can do that in EQ but it doesn't really mean much :-)  Melee is the way to go for killing big big things, magic works for just regular xp groups though but on epic encounters its functionality drops.  Rulwen said it very well.<P>All in all though I'd say this is the best times to switch over.  The one thing I remember the most about AC was dev involvement.  The monthly dev chats, just running into em in game world, involvement in public bulletin boards, responding to player concerns, adding humour to the monthly props, so on and so forth.  EQ though seems to be getting closer to that direction.  I don't expect I'll ever get a gold wrapped Pack Cow signed by Devilmouse himself in EQ, or see Innoruuk visit a town just to look around, scare some folks and share a twinky, but at least it does seem to me that the EQ dev seem more attentive to player concerns then I was originally led to believe upon starting the game.  Throw in a whole host of tiny functionality upgrades and EQ is in my mind getting more convenient to play. (though I'm convinced EQ will always be a much longer, slower game then AC)<P>Oh, one more thing. . AC is very very forgiving compared to EQ.  I remember a saying in AC, "If you don't have vitae you didn't have any fun".  In AC I remember purposely tempting fate and getting a thrill out of how narrowly I survived or how badly I would get clobbered.  In EQ though dying really really hurts, and logging with less xp then you had logging in is entirely possible.  In EQ I avoid death with an unnatural paranoia :-)  Don't get me wrong I don't want to dump on EQ, its a fine game and I think the Turbies could really learn from its interface if nothing else, but its a big switch over and the shock of it can very easily send you back to AC if your not prepared ;-)<P>Good luck Magius on whatever class you choose.<P>Cheers!<P>-Xankar Soulgazer, Drinal

I played AC since Beta and I have to wonder what you guys are talking about with the devs. I never have seen any of them ingame, never see them on any boards but Cod (and they go there because of the fact that a person who works for Turbine used to work for Cod so they get full control of the message boards which is just plain wrong IMO). I know Verant has a bad reputation, but I dont think monthly chats that answer no questions of any relevance and an occasional posting on a board that they basically own would qualify as feeling like the devs are my personal friend or something. I always found them to be slightly insulting, very ego maniacal and despite them having a greater presence on fansites and once or twice in over 2 years in game I still feel like they are very out of touch with their player base.<P>I think one thing that does need mentioning is that the devs for AC have little control over anything. Sony seems more hands off than MS. Verant also does police their game much better than AC. I see a lot of people calling out Verant for being too strict, but play AC even for one month and you will play side by side with cheaters literally every single time you log on. They even have 3rd party apps that run within AC to give you quicker attack speed, run speed and it will actually track monsters for you as well. At least in EQ you on even ground with the other players.<P>Sorry to be so down on the devs from AC, but I never like much of what they had to say and I also honestly believe that they completely ruined a once great game with terrible patches, poorly tested content and a blind eye to cheating. I really hope Verant is better in the end because by the end of my stay in AC I was totally disenfranchised with Turbine and MS.
