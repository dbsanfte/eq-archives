</FONT><HR>I agree with Gordon here.  I know a fellow who played into his 40's with only a FBR and some other common items.  He was excellent, and didn't 'need' special items to play well.  And like he said, of course if you play more you're going to have more chances at nice things...duh?  Does that mean everything should spawn quickly and often to cater to the person that only plays an hour a week?  I agree, the game would be extremely boring.  When I first started this game, I chose a server that had only been up for 2 weeks.  My ranger stayed in leather armor until his low 20's, something you will virtually never see these days, and he remained competitive.<P>Mystin De`Vermiis<BR>22nd Enchanter of the Tribunal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000025&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Well regarding this power gamer vs casual gamer arguement. If they tailored the game for the casual gamer it would put the powergamers, who in general are either kids or students or total losers, at a bigger advantage then they already have. I mean if you made things even easier or on less of a time scale these lamers would just have everything. Hmm they already have everything cause they have so much time its pathetic. I know some of these guys who play in excess of 50 hours a week. Well kids I guess can do that and students who dont have to work can to. <P>I got to level 53 as a casual gamer so it can be done but I dont have the time to camp the big items or the planes regularly. But if they decreases the time it took to say get a smr it wouldnt change much the powergamers/farmers would just get even more of them. As for the planes... if the made them less difficult and less time consuming you would have these powergaming uber guilds becoming more and more powerful with ease and then they would have to make things harder as these guys would just walk thru things that are challenging to the majority of players. They already "walk" thru hard areas and I think effected the difficulty level of some of the Kunark zones by the fact that verant had to make them tough enough for these uberguilds not to be able to just waltz thru killing everything in their path.<P>I dont see a reasonable solution to the problem. Gotta make due with what you got and forget about what others have. Anyways most of the powergamers seem to be quitting in droves lately so theres hope.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000026&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I think that the issue of the casual player is more serious than simply whether or not certain items are attainable.  It's a double whammy in the truest sense of the term:  Because you cannot play the game in 5-10 hour blocks, you are unable to obtain a substantial number of the desirable items in the game...  but couple that with the fact that you will be "level-lapped" by everybody you know so quickly that there will likely be nobody around to assist you with these quests, and suddenly 75% of the desirable items in the game are well beyond your reach.<P>I don't know that I can think of a "quick solution" to help smooth out the disparity between people who have 50 hours a week to play and those who can only spare 10 - but it seems like ther has to be a solution that's equitable.<P>I truly love the adventure and comeraderie of everquest, but it's very upsetting to know that I really just can't play the game unless I have a block of 3 hours to dedicate to it.  This might be less true for melee classes, but the wizard class (and any caster class without a pet) is all but crippled wihtout a group - so there's no way to even begin making any progress in the game in under an hour.<P>Isn't there a creative solution somewhere?  Could there be "solo zones" where grouping is not permitted or experience is only given for one hour of gameplay? Couldn't they create quests that still take similar amounts of effort to the existing quests, but could be accomplished in more bite-sized pieces?  Puzzles of intelligence and magic rather than the current  "run all over the globe and kill stuff" bounties that pass for quests?<P>Ultimately, yes - it's just a game.  But more and more, it's a game that frustrates me because it could be so much more with a little help and a few cherries thrown in for freshness now and again.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000027&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I agree the items that are kick ass should take a long time to obtain.  Like Aalandan has stated we all would like a red corvette and the malibu dream house and thos items go to the people who are willing to bust ass to get it.   If you don't bust ass and work hard you don't deserve the uber items in RL or in Game.   <P>In real life you have many options to obtain what you want.  You can work at a job do well get promoted and reach a station in life where you can obtain a loan to purchase those items.  You can invest in the stockmarket and if you are extremely lucky or clever make a killing and buy those items with cash.  You can even (though very unlikely) gamble enough money to buy those items.  You can perhaps get loans from friends or family to help buy those items.  You can even steal those items if you want them badly enough and willing to suffer the moral and legal consequences to such actions.  There are so many ways to obtain the cool items in RL.  <P>However the game sets up the situation to obtain those items in one way and only one way.  They make those items no drop so they can't be transfered (imagine the malibu beachhouse being no-drop  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/rolleyes.gif"> ).  They disallow Ebay purchasing (yes it is very much in their right to do so as it is there intellectual property) so the casual player who has the money can no long buy the items.   The only way to obtain alot of those items is to camp a rare spawn for hours on end or to set aside a very huge chunk of time to go on a plane raid. <P>There should be atleast alternatives to obtain those items in the game.  They could have implemented a very long quest involving massive travel to obtain an uber item.  Forinstance make a non-camp quest so arduous, yet do-able in chunks, that it will only be chosen as a last ditch option.  Say have a Quest NPC who spawns only on certain game days and maybe in different locations.  <P>This is what the casual gamer complains about.  Not that the items should be easy to get but the focus should be shifted a bit to allow alternatives to the massive combat camp times.  <P>Verrant is basically taking the easy way out by putting items on mobs that need to be killed and camped.  To make a very involved quest is difficult and requires a lot of creativity.  <P>Mixilplix Psi'Morphalus - Mith Marr<BR>Semi-Casual Gaming Enchanter who has a Life</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000028&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>The argument that EQ mimics life in that the more you put in, the more you receive is extremely valid and one that I personally agree with.  I do not question Verant's direction as far as rewarding the power gamers with planar armor and such, they deserve some differentiation.  The problem is that the ONLY way to measure something's value in EQ is how much TIME was spent to attain it.  I hate to insinuate these types of things because I'm not a Conspiracy Theorist, but it sure strikes me as strange that a game that is pay-for-play (more time = more money for Verant) has implemented a system that rewards you almost exclusively for how much time you spend in-game.  Make quests that require something other than time, geez, figure out 1 single way to reward people other than time spent.  I think the casual gamer is not unhappy that power gamers get rewarded, its that casual gamers have no reward system to speak of.<p>[This message has been edited by gaijinn (edited 05-18-2000).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000029&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

More and its just BORING and not worth it.<P>Does this mean an item should take an hour to get or be easy? No. Plane items for instance I think are perfict. Hard to get and take time and effort , perfict. But constant pulls and no bordom.<P>Quests with 10, 1 hour parts are cool. Quests with one 10 hour spawn just suck donuts though.<P>And yes at the higher level items are necessary to get into groups. I would never let a cleric in banded or bronze into a level 50 group. To much liability.<P>They need to make this game playable for thew casual player. They have made every effort to keep the power gamer item starved.<P>When in response a player kill steals,trains and harasses a camp to make people leave its a direct result of the frustration caused by their clueless itemization rules.<P>They always blame the person doing it but never accept responsibility for their culpibility in driving the player to it.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000031&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I used to play a game called dragonrealms. Its a text game. One of the most exciting part of the game is a festival. Its a GM event and what happens is that there are merchants in the festivals that sells cool stuff. Stuff that you'll not see in the game otherwise. What verant can do is to organise such festivals with one-time merchants selling no-drop special items for casual gamers. I thinks one such event every season should be enough. Since the items will be no-drop, it can't be traded, thus no-one who do not need it really will get it. Of course, it should be fairly expensive, yet useful. Another effect will be that most casual gamers will hoard their money for these festivals, thus driving the prices for those other items that can be gotten from quest down, maybe making it not worthwhile for those power-gamers to camp it so that they can sell the quest items for a quick buck.<p>[This message has been edited by yewpoh (edited 05-18-2000).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000032&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>The point that most people are missing is this. The casual gamer has no problem spending the time to do the quests. However they want to be able to spend the time broken up some. For example let's take a spawn that has to normally be camped 12 hours straight to get the item off it. The casual gamer would rather have the quest require them to get 6 items that all take approx. 2 hours to get in order to get the item.<P>Also as one person commented what has Abashi's official Verant response always been to people saying their class is not balanced at certain levels? It has ALWAYS been along the line of "If you are in the equipment you should be in by that level then you are balanced. But no a level 50 warrior in non planes armor with non planes weapons is not going to be as powerful as one that is in all planes gear"<P>So tell me if it is supposed to be balanced then how is the casual gamer who is not going to be in planes gear supposed to get groups and hunt in level appropriate areas? Answer appears to be they aren't. They are just supposed to accept being relegated to hunting with maybe a few friends or going around saving newbies because they are not in level appropriate items because they can't camp items for 15 hours a day.<P>Tell me how it is balanced if the casual gamer cannot get groups because they cannot do their job as well as the powergamers.<P>Sadil</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000033&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

Failure to do so will just result in messy deaths.<P>Grouping is not possible for the casual user. Organizing groups takes too long when you are only going to be online for an hour or two. There is no time to, as Brad always puts it, "Do a Dungeon" in a 2 hours period.<P>The game just doesn't support casual users.

</FONT><HR>I am a former powergamer turned 'casual' gamer due to outside circumstances (aka job). I used to play for the majority of the time I was awake (known as 'living' in the game), now I play maybe 2 hours after work and the occasional lunch break. But time restrictions aren't what led to my change in play style. In the old powergame days, I gave up item camping due to the ridiculous levels some people take it to.<P>We all can point to the guilds that have the spawn for item 'X' timed to the nearest 20 seconds, and swarm the area just as it pops, or have members rotate camping times. This is a reason I stopped camping items as a focus in the game and turned more towards just playing and not worrying about loot. In fact, to this end I created a monk and left my former life as a wizard behind.<P>This has really helped me now that I am back playing EQ again (I had taken off several months), as I view nice items as a bonus to playing, not the reason to play.<P>So sure, I may never get my jboots (well, yeah I will hehe), or a lot of the 'k3wl l3wt', but I will have fun in any event. That's what it's all about to me.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000036&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Like many others, I simply do not have the time, or honestly the desire, to commit 80+ hours a week to Everquest. At lower levels I was able to do alright spending only 1-2 hours online each evening, but as I get higher level it has become increasingly difficult, to the point I often do not bother.<BR>The problems I face as a casual gamer are two-fold.  Because I cannot commit to the long camps for the better equipment, I am becoming more and more underpowered for my current level... and because I am underpowered I cannot effectively solo.  So it forces it me find groups, but because of the structure of EQ, nearly everything worth camping is covered with players...when was the last time a casual gamer got into a treant group at 7pm EST?  So, often what time I can commit to playing is spent attempting to find a group... by the time I get into a group it is almost time for me to go.<BR>So yes, I definately believe that Everquest is flawed by design when it comes to catering to the casual gamer.  I understand that at the same time, it has to be challenging to those who do have the 80+ hours a week to devote to the game, but I feel the game is currently geared towards making it as difficult as possible to keep the powergamers from becoming too henious (which i can understand) but that really leaves the casual gamer holding the bag.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000038&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Verant is very successful with EQ right now. When all of us "casual gamers" shut down our accounts, Verant will change their tune. It is nice for them to be able to follow a "vision" but as soon as that vision starts losing customers it will be time to change the vision. <P>Most people wont shut their accounts down though. They are just too addicted. That will change with time. Even in Kunark you are doing the same things you did before. pull, kill. pull kill. Hell, unless you are a monk, you dont even get a chance to see the depths of most dungeons. This will ultimately be the death of EQ. The only difference is that now, in some areas you can lose your corpse and everything on it. It is only a matter of time now before EQ is put out to pasture. <P>If you play EQ you are just a rat in a maze trying to get the cheeze. Well, even a rat with a brain the size of a pea will eventually give up if they cant get the cheeze. And if you haven't realized yet, you will never get the cheeze. There is no cheeze. If the cheeze actually exisited, it would affect class balance so much that Verant would have to cut the cheeze  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">,(read as nerf). <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000041&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I have watched for over the past year the responses of Verants represenatives, and can almost always know what their answers will be. Our vision is fulfilled for the game, we envision class balance with the changes, this subject is dead, or usually not in these words tough luck thats the way it is. When I started playing I was off frm work for a period of time , and had hours to put into the game, now that I am back to work just a casual gamer. What do I see, yes random drops in Kunark are great, but what of the power gamers that got their upgrade fast, they reaped the reward of a Verant screw up and tough luck for the rest of us, when the shipping was thier screw up. They billed our accounts immediately, yet too 4 weeks after kunark opened for me to receive my upgrade. Long spawns are senseless. Jboots for example, I have spent a total of 147 hours camping for the ac both in Southern RO and OOT, do I have the jboots, nope. Why? Verant is happy with this setup. Verant also stated that Kunark is group oriented, yet I have a lvl 45 sk, and watch lvl 39 necros solo critters in  kunark. Class balance ? I dont think so. I thinks its great that some casters have power, but this is a little extreme, yet let the necros jump on the bandwagon and they get catered to. I love the game , but I see a general line of Verant leaning more to cater to Uber Guilds, and power gamers. They state they have a balanced economy for supply and demand, but if you will spend just several sundays at any bazaar you will tend to find the same people offering the great items, and demanding the outrageous amounts that come with them. I have yet to see an earnest answer from Abashi on any issues, always arrogance and  general inconsideration. Yes, Verant is aware that they have a winner in Everquest, and they seem to genuinely want to advance the game. But in doing so they are sacrficing some of their customer base. How long will it go on?

</FONT><HR>I can understand the response that not everyone needs to have every cool item, and that some items are meant to be nearly unique.<P>However, these items are not optional items, because it seems that hunting grounds are created with the assumption that the character will have a certain level of equipment.  I have very few of these "special" items, and I have an awful time hunting.  I need to hunt in big groups to take monsters that consider blue to me, the result is very slow experience and money.<P>Of the few items I have, none were earned by me.  The Shiny Brass Shield I have and the Screaming Mace I had were both sold to me.  I now have a Cold Iron Morningstar, which was given to me by another character with way too much money.  I don't have any magical armor, except for a cloak that was given to me by a friend (who got it from a twinked character who had more than he could use).  The rest of my armor was made for me by a friend.<P>The funny thing about the comment that a change would be the same as making all items available at vendors is that for me that's exactly the way it is.  I can only buy things.<P>And I'm not going to spend hours just waiting my turn to camp the items I need.<P>I've been doing well in the game so far, but after finally reaching 20th level I'm hitting a wall because I don't have the equipment I need to fight creatures that give me experience.  I was having fun at first but now I'm getting frustrated.<P>Maybe Kundark is better, but I don't have that expansion, and I would like to see the original game improved.  Or at least make encounters that don't assume I have all these items that are supposed to be optional.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000043&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Class-specific armor quests are far and away different than loot that drops off of a particular named mob.  I mean seriously, Gordon read the posts you are replying to more than once. The original author and I don't want every item in the game. We also don't want to have to wave goodbye to our families and friends to get to do a quest for a nice, tho not overpowered item. I would prefer more class specific stuff, something that makes another player say, "Hey thats a Novice's Staff of Elemental Control, you must be a magician!" or "Hey you're wearing a Bracer of the Healer, you must be a cleric!" <P>Being a magician myself, I can't wait to earn the components for the Sol Ro magician only robe. Not because of the stats or resistance buff but because, dammit, I'm a magician and no other class can wear that piece! People recognize the robe as being Mage only. If I wanted the biggest, baddest armor, I'd buy 10000pp on Ebay and get the Molten Cloak and Frogluk Bonecaster robe at one of the Friday Bazaars.<P>Items like J-Boots are sufficiently powerful that they should require a lot of effort. Questable class specific armor should be attainable by all. A quest taking 8 hours or more to complete is fine, as long as the parts are broken up into 2-3 hour chunks. Then as a casual player I can still complete the quest but it may take me 5 nights instead 1 for a hard core gamer.<P>Thank you for listening.<BR>CG</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000044&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I really only have one thing to say - Verant knows there stuff.  I continually read posts from disgruntled people on a WIDE variety of differing subjects,  and Verant is always patient and understanding, but firm AS THEY SHOULD BE.  Everquest is fun. Verant seems to know the necessary things to keep us players motivated and interested.  Every action has a reaction, and Verant is thoughtful enough to take all things into consideration. I believe that the majority of their decisions will result in continued enjoyment of the game, and am extremely happy that they don't bow down to popular opinion.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000045&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>My level 22 Warrior has a Mith 2h, I saw a level 25 Warrior get whooped by a lizard defender in Cazic but I whooped that lizards arse(yellow to me, blue to him) in fact I have been soloing them bad boys.  The other warrior had very mediocre equipment, bronze and the like while I had full crafted, SSB, and numerous other sweet items.  Bottom line is items make you better, significantly so in some cases as mentioned above.  I got lucky and caught a rare spawn in Qeynos hills and got the rare drop.

</FONT><HR>I am a casual gamer and I really like this game.  One of the things I like is the camaderie (?) such that I have no qualms about going up to other players and starting groups.  The problem that I see is that I will get in a group that works well.  The next time I login amny are two or more levels higher!  This makes it hard to keep on track.  It also starts making me look more at the eps situation than roleplaying so that I can stay with a particular group that I get along with.  With this game I don't know that there is a real solution other than having everyone in the group agree to play at the same time (haha).  <BR>As far as items, etc.  has EQ ever thought about doing special quests geared towards the individual player.  I realize that this could be a huge drain on resources since you could have 1000's of individual quests going on at the same time.  The quests could be genericised.  For example the mage trainer in Felwithe asks for some batwings for spell components.  You get them, deliver and get some exp and a spell in return.  This could be genericised so that depending on the PC who talks with her, it might be batwings, or spiderling silk or... and then you might receive something different , esp if you already have the item.  <BR>Again I realize this could create a huge drain on the server resources since it would have to track what quests each person is doing at any given moment.  Just curious to see what their thoughts were</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000048&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I love EQ the game itself rocks. They people behind the game now thats another story. These people have alot to learn.<P>Say what you want there is no casual gamaing in EQ. The bottom line is this if you are true to your character and want to advance, maybe not as fast as the die hards you at some point will camp for something. <P>You can only go so far with the items you start with. The trade skills are so horrible you are forced into not using them. These trade skills would have been just the thing for the causal gamers. Allowing one with only a couple of hours a night to do something other than, camp, fight, med, level, camp fight med...<P>Take the manastone for example. When this item was first found. People camped the hell outta this thing. I would often find higher levels who were getting no exp harvesting these. This was way back when, mind you. <P>A whole guild tooks shifts on this item. I was so fustrated. Everytime I had time to go down there. Someone from this particular guild would be there. I got to the point were I was thinking these guys were either filthy rich guys or vampires. <P>Explotation by Clerics got the stone tossed. <BR>Pwr gamers had farmed it soo much totally giving a causal gamer no chance to even think about getting this item. So the stone goes bye bye. But the very same people who Verant said had a hand it getting it tossed was able to keep theirs???<P>Thats when I knew who this game is catered too. Im sure NOW you will hear yeah they got to keep em but we nerfed em. The manastone didnt get nerfed until well after it had been gone from the game for months. Which brought up the Casters w/manastone vs Casters w/o manastones debate.<P>Verant needs a casual server a rp server and a Hardcore server. If someone wants to wait 10-12 hrs for a spawn put them on the hardcore server. Just beacuse someone is ok with wating this long doesnt mean I should be. I want to play and have fun. Every minute I spend in EQ I should be able to do something productive. Be it selling arrows, armor, fish, booze or whatever. This game does not have these features.<P>Another example here is a fix for a Rouge "casual gamer" that would blow his socks off. Rouges can apply posion right? If im an Archer type I should be able to order up some posion tipped arrows or have the Rouge posion my Shurikens or if Im a melee type have him posion my weapon. Give the skills functionality then the casual game is born. Verant has stated many times that they would not do things like this.<P>Now they are trying to say they cater to the casual gamers. Hogwash. Come on how stupid do they think we are. All Verant needs to do is LISTEN to its LARGE customer base. But they wont their attitude has reflected this prompting most people to give up on them. Most are just playing until something esle comes out. Then the next fad will start all over again. <P>But unless this ship is righted that fad wont be about another Verant product for awhile. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000049&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><br>This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/000977-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/000977.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/000977-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/000977-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/000977-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/000977-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/000977-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000977&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000977&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
