<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">I am one bubble into level 53.  Obviously each post 50 level takes a long time to get past.  These are my unscientific comments on the mage at level 53.  It isn't bad.  In fact I like the level.  The only drawback concerns the massive hit points of many of the npcs.  The ability of the mage to solo post 50 seriously declines because of the fact that many high blues have a massive amount of hit points.  Many classes can be seen soloing far more effective than mages such as wizards, necros, druids and possibly shamans.  Now for the good points.  At level 53 I picked up two spells which are quite nice.  (You can keep the other two spells at this level,they are virtually useless).  The two spells are Boon Of Immolation and the 53 air  pet.  Boon of Immolation casts a group damage shield equal to lava shield.  It does costs 360 mana but it does seem to last a while.  If you have a full group then the odds are that at least three members are fighting.  This would include traditional tanks, hybrids and even bards.  Instead of targeting one or more tanks, I can cast one spell and everyone has the shield.  Personally I have had no problem in an npc aggroing on me because of the shield, it just doesnt seem to happen.  The second spell is the 53 air pet.  From an unscientific point of view it is quite nice.  I have heard of no tests of an air pet versus earth.  However the 53 air pet seems to have close to the same amount of hit points as the 51 earth pet.  Add in their superior ability for agility and the air pet seems to last longer in a fight or multiple fights than the earth pet even if it is tanking.  I have used the air and earth pets in the Dreadlands and Karanors.   Next I will try out the air pet in Burning Wood and Skyfire.  Besides I never get a comment when I group up asking me to get rid of the air pet.  But I do get that comment in many group situations with earth pets.  Root interferring with snare.  Add in the stuns of an air pet and the tanks really enjoy having them around.  Yes I have soloed with the air pet against the sentrys in Karanors and the ragers and ravishers in Dreadlands.  The air pet stands up quite nice to the pounding.  You just can't chain nuke because of the lack of root.  One final comment to this litany without paragraphs.  I used to be upset that our they downgraded our DDs post 50.  Downgraded  in the sense that Druid's DD is now better and we didn't get a very serious upgrade.  Char the level 52 DD is fire based and at level 52 only does 60 more damage than the level 44 DD spell which is magical.  Char does have a faster cast time and is resisted by more crowds.  So now I have to learn who to cast the char on.  Why am I no longer as upset about the lack of a serious upgrade.  Simple, in group situations (based on at least two tanks and my pet ) rarely does the npc aggro on me.  Obviously, we are all taught by experience to not over nuke.  However I can launch a nuke fairly early in the fight and no aggro.  Why, because the damage of the tanks and the pet.  The speed and damage of post 50 tanks (and the pet) seems to have improved.  I know that Kunark has been good to tanks.  It certainly has been good to my Paladin.  One can still overnuke. However by being a mediocre nuker (that term sounds terrible) the npcs are not aggroing on me.  Some people may flame me because of my partial acceptance of the lowered damage we do in nukes.  But oh well thats life.  Life for a post 50 mage is not all bad.  Frustrating at times.  Give me a defensive spell.  Of course, that will happen when we find Santa Clause. Cheer up mages I like post 50 on the whole.</TEXTAREA>
