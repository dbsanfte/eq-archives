of course there should be a roleplaying server, but it seems highly unlikely..There is just way too many elements in stake here..<P>For one; You cant control a PC actions..so there wont be alot of consistence, which is important in a roleplaying game.<P>2; you will pretty much wipe out all evil classes because the diffculty level in playing them would be way to high for people to play and there is alot more good races then evil in the game..Think when a dark elf war walks out of nektulos and a bunch of high elfs or wood elfs or human or what have you, all of them will jump the Dark elf and kill him...that would be the roleplaying aura. <P>and there are some many other possibilies that would make it really unlikely to happen...but if it does i will be there!

I have been saying for almost 2 years they should have a RP server.<P>Of course they can not regulate who will RP and who wont but, labeling the server a RP server would in my opinion draw in the true RPers making them a majority. When i first started playing EQ (Back when Mino Axes were the most uber weapon one could get) i attempted to RP, i was responded to like i had 2 heads.  Try walking into a zone where people are shouting OOC  "How bout those Super bowl scores!" and ask them nicely to please keep it in OOC, you will most likely get 20 people telling you to shut up LOL.  On a RP server with the majority RPers perhaps it would be the OOCer being told to shut up :P<P>Darktalya Faran<BR>Level 56 Mage of Rodcet<BR>Proud wife of Gadbois Faran<P>

Kudos Darktalya,<BR> I remember meeting up with Darktalya so many moons ago... we have a strong COntingent of Roleplayers on Rodcet Nife.. and we do as well on Fennin Ro.. What I would like to see.. is for the Dark Elven Roleplaying society from Fennin Ro all go to a RP server.. you wanted to know what would happen? hehe they are the strongest Dark Elven group I can think of.. trust me.. there will always be those that enjoy playing the Darker Races.. though I agree.. there should be some balance issues for Dark Races... But I think that it isnt QUITE as difficult as everyone is making this out to be.. surely there will be some inconsistances... BUT you get a few groups together.. most of those Inconsistances can be ignored if not overlooked. That is what the Knights Templar and the House Velahr and so many other Roleplaying Guilds have done on Rodcet Nife... you give those guys a RP Based Server.. and they would Rule.<P>just my two platnuim. and yes.. its worth that.<P>Shingen Hawkwood<BR>AKA the Red Mage of Rodcet Nife

I would start playing the game again more than likely (dunno if this is good or bad thing  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/wink.gif">).  I got EQ the day it went retail, and the most fun I had was the first month or so when some people were still roleplaying.  There was a definant sort of community that hung out at the towers in west karana, still leary about exploring outwards, still roleplaying because the "power-gaming" aspect of EQ had not yet been discovered.  I mean, at this point I would never level a new character in west karana (it sux0r!).  But I wouldn't mind levelling in West Karana if I was travelling with like-minded roleplayers, because even if the flow of experience was slow, I would be reaping the benefits of roleplay.  I'm chatty enough that I could spend an entire gaming session in Qeynos, gesturing, walking about, drinking beer, etc.  But not in EQ the way it is now.  It's not nearly interesting enough because out of every one person you meet that roleplays, 30 others don't (including myself at this point with two chars 50+ etc etc).<P>Kaita

gentlemen,<BR>I have been playing EQ for a short amount of time now and a pure roleplay server would be a great addition.  The reasons why have been said over and over, I think however the how is getting in the way.  To start take out all /ooc and /shout and /auctions.  This would limit the "breaking of the roleplay atmosphere."  Next no common tougue.  A common lang for a continent maybe but no common lang.  Then those races that like one another on the same continent can converse like the orgre's and troll's but the high elves and and halflings could not (unless the were skilled in the others lang).  NPC's would do the same speak in native toungues.  <BR>Groups could only consist of evil or good alignments mixing would not be permitted.  This adds to teh decsion of making a cleric, warrior, or any other class that may fall on either side.  Also guilds would become more exclusive.  They would become a lot more fun to join instead of "hey can i get in?" "sure lets go"  It will be "May I join your fellowship my friend?"  "That will depend on you proving yourself to me and my guildmates."  This would add so many new dementions to the game.<BR>Limit the char amount to one.  this makes for true gaming without self twinking.  Now if a true roleplay char wants to take a newbie under his wing and teach him the ways then so be it,it is up to that player.  <BR>These are just a few suggestions on how to start the roleplay server.  I know i would join to play in a heartbeat if it were added.  I mostly roleplay with my necromancer anyway, so this would be a bonus to me.  Add a roleplay server to EQ would only add to the entertainment of the true player and as you can see from the amount of posts, give the gamer what they want in the game<BR>wooglin

My Take on a Roleplay server.<P>1. Single Charecter allowed. This will cut down on many casual twinks because to have a second charecter to twink you will have to have a second account.<P>2. Cut Shout range down to Yell range. Only have /ooc as a zone wide channel and auction I guess.<P>3. Have race specific NPC's speak in a chosen language. Some Will of course speak common as well but If you want to converse with a powerful High Elf paladin you should be able to understand him. Or that Dwarven blacksmith.....<P>4. Use the guild function alot smarter. Make certain quests only able to be completed if you are in the NPC's guild. NPC guildleaders could invite people to the guild as easily as PC's can. Make it level dependant and Faction dependant. There could be a Level range for certain guilds. Like For low levels &lt;Order of the Bixie&gt; then 20 to 40 level &lt;Order of the Griffin&gt; then 41 60 &lt;Order of the dragon&gt; <P>Make Other Quests that directly hinder or require the same items, used by an enemy NPC guild. And when those guilds are at war due to GM actions the guildys are too....<P>To flesh that out more. If there were NPC controlled guilds Who with the proper faction you could join. You could have a controlable form of PVP that wouldnt deter the player Vs environment game. Useing Faction hits for leaving the guild without using proper channels would deter casual PKing for one guild then joining another guild. And Since the guild Is NPC controlled GM's could alter the quest data on the NPC to utalise zones more frequently.<P>Also During large events GMS could take over the NPC and have a walking breathing guildmaster for the day or for special rewards.<P>You would still have PC guilds forming and doing thier own thing but they would not be established in the towns like the NPC guilds are. And would at best be seen as Mercs.<P>And With a NPC controlled guild declaring war on the PC guild, all sorts fo things could happen. &lt;Pc guild leader would have to agree&gt;<P>5. Use the ability to change spawn and Loot tables more often in zones to reflect change. Halloween of 1999 had an alternite spawn table that had undead of various types and alternite named guards that were green and non aggro. Make more of these types of zone wide changes that will allow a more dynamic environment. <P>In example. North Qeynos. There is a slowly brewing faction that supports bertoxolouss. If NPC's guilds have a war based on that storyline and Bertox followers win. then change the spawn table to reflect it. More corrupt guards, Vendors selling things that reflect the change as well. Supporters of good hiding in allyways. That sort of thing. If you had 4-5 spawn tables for each zone to reflect the changes in story so much the better. <P>Have the scale set up so that <P>a. is total victory for Antonius bayle. The zone reflects it, total followers of Nife and Karanas running everywhere.<P>b. Marginal Victory for Antonius Bayle. Some vendors outed, the more obvous corrupt guards gone and replaced, but there is still some seedy underbelly.<P>c. Stalemate. As the zone has been for the last 2 years.<P>d. Marginal victory for Bertoxxolous. Nife and Karanas temples are worn down. Vendors are sick, Prices are higher, good guards are weaker and of a lower level. More corruption is rampant, guards demand payment for services and such.<P>e. Total Victory For Bertoxx. Good is all but wiped out. Vendors reflect this. Food is scarce. Nife and Karanas temple people and vendors are moved to other zones or simply not there anymore. Guards factions are much less forgiving of strangers.<P>Do this for most of the major town zones or the more populated adventure zones and you could really have a more dynamic and breathing environment. No need to change the Static layout of the zone. Simply change the objects people relate to. The NPC'S. Verant has shown they can do just that.<P><BR>Enough for now. I may post more later.<P>Feather Silverthorn. Thief. E Marr.

one thing that really takes away from the roleplay envornment in eq is the ability to twink a lvl 1 bard or cleric with labinent or cleric quest armour. the only way to stop things like this and keep the majority of folks who would not wish to rp their character is to limit the number of characters on the server to 1. although i like playing multiple charcaters alot and understand that verant isn't going to make a ton of rp servers so i can have my seconds and thirds and fourths on them, limiting number of characters would stop twinking and help turn those who don't wish to roleplay away from the server.<BR>other things that i think would need to be done are removal of the common tounge from town merchants, and some form of pvp rules adjustment that is fair and less able to be abused by those who seek to ruin the game for all (like the people who sat out side of towns killing anyone who walked out in UO)<BR>

I just read that discussion on CastersRealm and I feel the need to make some comments that I hope people will read. I have multiple characters on 2 servers now. I have well established 6 characters on the blue server Solusek Ro and now 1 on Tallon Zek. On Solusek Ro I find myself in an atmosphere of being more "IN IT FOR MYSELF" attitude and I rarely Roleplay. You seem to be more objective based then anything Else. I must get to this level, or I will camp this till I get my sheild. I find myself never compelled to roleplay. I group when I need to and Solo when I want. On Tallon Zek is an Entire Different Story ! ! ! Here I am "Forced" almost if you will into roleplaying. It is the NATURE of this server. I believe this mainly due to the fact that it is a "TEAM" server. Here there is Definitely a FINE LINE between Good/Evil or Lighty's and Darks as they put it. There is more brotherhood and Kinship here then there ever is on SOLUSEK RO!!! Here People watch out for you, they work together, they help you. Why Because they know one day they may be getting attacked by a Lighty or a dark and need somone to help. I play an Iksar Shamen on Tallon Zek. In a Weeks Time I have Powered him to Level 13. From my understanding there is a weak Contingent of HIGH level Iksar. We are also outnumbered by the Lights. So we stick together and work together. I find that the TEAM PvP is the way to go. Making it a Good Vs. Evil atmosphere makes the mentality and the desire to slip into this alternate ego very easy to do and happens almost naturally. I don't think a ROLEPLAY server is the best Idea. I think that makin the PVP's all Good Vs. Evil will Yeild you a Much better Desired Result. One thing that I do Feel is Lacking is the EXP gain from Killing a PC. I think there is more so a risk Vs. Gain Factor Here then there is on a BLUE server and thus Warrants the reward of EXP. I think that this may be an Viable Option for you as a reward for Roleplaying. YOu could look at this as an easy to do Incentive for Roleplaying. Thats Just my 2cp worth coming from somone that knows both sides to this coin

   I like the idea of a RP only server. I probably would not use it because I am pretty much not into roleplaying as much I used to be but the option would be nice.<BR>   Points I think that need to be made and/or points that have been made that I agree on. <BR>   a&gt; Shout and OOC limited to /yell range and /auction eliminated. Why? In a pure RP environment there is no need for an auction specific command and limioting the range on the other 2 would prevent them from being used as zonewide auctioning commands. ((Personally I feel that zone wide auctioning ruins the RP feel of the game more than anything else. Though.. I would love to go to a Fan Convention and yell at the top of my lungs "Want To But one hotdog!!!"<BR>  b&gt; One character per account limitation per Rp server. This could end some of the solo twinking that I **cough cough** I mean others have done. This would not stop team twinking (I hate that word by the way) but at least it force more people to work together.<BR>  c&gt; Not every race should know common language. Make them travel and learn. How? Well...<BR>  d&gt; Create some quests that allow characters to change their factions radiaclly. This is proabably unfeesable but it would be bice to create an Ogre that could live in Qetnos. The side effect to this is that this ogre should become KoS to all Ogre's, Ogre's allies, and other appropriate species/classes inversely proportinate to 5-10 times their faction gains. These quests should be level limited and only available to be completed once per level limit and never to regain that lost faction. ((Maybe a bad idea but it is just an idea))<BR>  e&gt; Change the faction gain/loss system. Characters should always loose faction pretaining to their class/race/religion whenever they do anything counter to it no matter where in the world it is. A bit unrealistic yes... but it should stop (or at least slow) players who do quests for rewards that go against their alignment.<BR>  f&gt; More physically visiable emotes. why? Because they are fun to do and watch.<BR>  g&gt; Limit the range of zone wide commands... I feel very strongly about this.<BR>  h&gt; Create "Shout stones" that allow a person to use one to shgout zonewide commands. One use... non stackable... quest item... expensive when purchasing from a vendor.<BR>  i&gt; So you say "Eliminating zone wide shouts/ooc's will greatly hinder me when I am lost or am looking for my corpse." Well in reply I say "Yes, it would wouldn't it. **smile**". Too frigging bad... be more carefull... travel with others... but what about the "Train incoming" shout? Well... won't it be far more exciting to suuddenly here the shouts of "TRAIN OH FOR THE LOVE OF HEAVEN A HUGE TRAIN INCOMING!!!" and knowing that you have only seconds to high tail it out of their? In think it would be very exciting indeed!<BR>  j&gt; Eliminate the zone wide shouts/auction/occ's... I cannot stress this enough. It so detracting from an atmosphere of RolePlaying to see in the middle of your Rping "Thebigtoe auctions WTB Giant Rats Wiskers 50pp a piece : WTS My sence of selce worth 100pp" ((or some such nonsence). <P>   These are just a few idea's that come to me while reading about this subject. If I misspelled anything do not be surprised as I am the TypoKing and cannot type or spell worth beans.<P>      The Big Toe <BR>  "Not just any big toe... but **THEE** Big Toe"

Most changes they could make to encourage role-playing would actually make the game harder, but I think the people who truly want to role-play would accept this.  Especially since would discourage people who just want to play on a fresh server or to just create grief for others.  Here are some of the things that I think would be valuable. <P>1. Religion and in a broader sense faction:  It should affect more than just NPC interaction.  For example, if a good cleric tried to heal an evil character then either the healer's faction would suffer or perhaps the spell simply wouldn't work.  After all a cleric healing powers come from their god and why should their god wish to expend power on an enemy of his.  There are lots of ways this type of thing could be integrated into gameplay.<P><BR>2. Chat channels:  Shout should be limited to the range of yell.  Ooc should be removed entirely.  Auction should be limited to city zones only.  Guildsay I am really torn on, it's not really realistic but removing it might have to big an impact.<P>3. Guilds:  I think that there should be some official guilds formed by a GM/senior guide.  There should be some advantages for being in an official guild so that being removed from them has a price.  In this way the GM/senior guide would be able to enforce behavior to a certain extent but still leave the ultimate decision to the player.  The officers should be players and they should be responsible for organizing most guild activities with the GM/senior guide only occasionally doing guile level quests.<P>4. Number of characters:  Each account should only be able to create one character.  Not only would this affect twinking but also creates the feeling that the player represents a single persona and not many.<P>5. Language:  Each race should start with a good knowledge of their own racial language and a minor knowledge in some of the races neighboring their starting cites.  Dark races should also have a very minor understanding of dark speech.  Since there is no "human" language give them common as theirs.  There should be some class specific exceptions to this.  For example a shadow knight or necro from Freeport who worships Innoruuk should have a minor knowledge of dark speech where as the good classes starting in Freeport should not.  NPCs should be limited to only speaking their racial language.  This would include NPCs of non-player races.  Dragon and goblin would finally have a purpose.  I am not sure how to handle language training with guild masters.  There really is no good reason why the High Elf paladin guild leader should be teaching Dark Elf but on the other hand how else would the Non-player race languages first be introduced to players to learn.  I suppose you could hail the quest npc until you have heard him speak often enough to learn it but that goes against the whole intent of the server.  Perhaps it could be introduced via the official guilds I spoke of above.<BR><p>[This message has been edited by Xombie (edited March 24, 2001).]

Making a RP only server is a good idea. RPing is hard to do and have fun with if everyone around you isnt doing it too. Things on this server should all aim to make the environment better for roleplaying. Simple things like implementing actual uses for different languages and in-game events would make the world of norrath seem more and more real.

Just want to support the idea of a Role Playing only server.  I've read a number of excellent ideas all over the place about this, and can only wonder why it hasn't happened:  despite all the reasons I've read about why it can't happen, it seems like a no brainer, and I think it should happen.<P>Has anyone thought of getting together a petition?  Just a list of signatures of all the active subscribers, people who are paying to play, who'd like to have a role playing server.  From all I've read, it would appear that there's *plenty* of support among the player base for such a development.<P>I have no idea how to generate a petition of the type I'm thinking.  Maybe someone's done it already, maybe it's in the works, or maybe there's some better way to let Verant know how many people really want a RP only server (maybe, this is it).  If anyone has thoughts on this, or wants to get something going, email me:<P>hawkeye@sunsetwinona.com<P>Maybe if Verant really knew how much support there is for such a thing, it could happen.<P>Has anyone compiled a list of websites/bb's that have info on this issue?  I'd like to see it.<P>Erethmis 11 monk Tholuxe Paells<BR>aka Hawkeye Parker

When I started EQ in August I was pretty green. I roleplayed a lot but when I watched those around me power gaming and power lvling, I quite Rastavan because he couldn't keep up. I would love a new server of RPers that don't feel the need to twink or KS... who do feel the need to play in character conflicts an all. We don't need to be KOS to each other, just unfriendly. It also might be fun to con player in respect to how they view your prim faction(indigo brotherhood for DE warriors etc).

Some very good Ideas on how to work with RP server.  You folks seem to think that /auction needs to be eliminated.  I agree, but only because I already know a perfect way in the current game structure to buy sell w/o having to /auction it.<P>Have any of you ever noticed that in some cities you can go to an inn or tavern and leave a message on a "communications board"?  I am sure that many of you have, and do you not agree that this would eliminate the need for /auction on any server?  Just remove it and make them use the boards.<P>I also agree on the /ooc /shout eliminations,  However, perhaps the need for a /train command similar to the /yell for help command could be implemented, this would allow you to warn others in a yelling range of the immenent arrival.<P>And as far as loosing bodies while traveling...  You can still use /tell to speak to others, I think most would agree that it would be excusable to use this until visual conatact is made with another character.<P>I think they should be able to code the RP server so that it will flat out not allow opposite religions to group.  Make the religions more a faction element so that choosing your religion is part of the RP experience.  Keep in mind I am not overly religious in RL, just that I think it has a place in the game, and it is not being used fully.<P>And how about not being able to use beneficial spells on opposing religions?  Why would your "God" grant you the power to heal another when the to "Gods" do not get along?<P>Anyway, I think there are many more Ideas out there, in all of your minds, and if Verant will just listen a bit, they will see just what the RP people want and how to make the issues work in game.<P>Funny thing is though, I am not sure if I would change to a RP server.  We can turn off the /ooc/shout/auction commands in game.  We are only limiting ourselves to one server.  Why not just do it on the server you are on now and not talk to anyone who does not RP?  Do not interact with those who are not willing to play the game as it was intended.  Put your foot forward in making all the servers RP.<P>Strost Shadowdreamer<BR>Shadowknight Incarnate<BR>Tallon Zek

In a perfect world an RP server would be a wonderfull adition to EQ. HOwever this is not a perfect world. Making a RP only server will not make the problems go away. Posts here seem to believe that the k00l d3wds, KS'rs and general malcontents will not play on or will be quickly shun'd from a RP server. This is not true. Look at it from their side. They would have a server where thay can indulge in all their worst traits and be able to call it RPing. Simply imagine a group of "evil" chars in a zone continualy stealing kills and insulting other people in shouts & says. When a GM is called they claim they are RPing. On a regular server this is a violation of the PnP. But, on a RP server would the GM even have the ability or the authority to tell them thy are not RPing in the way it was intended? For in reality they would be acting exactly the way an evil race would. Also, alot would start when any RP server was initially opened. There would be no Uber guilds to regulate them or bring any sort of pressure. In fact a guild compromised soley of powergamgers and kOOl d3wds would quickly be formed. Any other such people who joined the server at a later date would quickly gravitate to that guild and as such be protected from reprisals by any of the other established guilds on the server. An RP server will not be an EQ utopia, it will be the ultimate exercise in frustration and disapointment. There is no way to determine who is RPing and who is not. One persons way of acting may be totally diff from another persons. They can think the other person is not RPing while at the same time claiming that they are. This is only the way the people will act. This is not even scratching the surface of any limitations that have been suggested. Such as the reduced shout range or removal of auction. Because no matter what is taken away, any one who wants to make trouble is going ot find a way. Simply put, there are a'holes out there in the world, some of them play EQ, and that will never change. Making a RP server would be like giving them the keys to the candy store.

Dice-<P>My deepest aplogies for a Ia m abit inebriated(sp?) ok aso I am drunk rightnow... anyway I have played on the nmelss server, then on to vallon zek and now to rallos zek getting closer to true roleplay atmosphere everythime i switch servers.  I know I'll get flame for this but the PvP environment must be employed to be a successful rp server.<BR>On the issue of 'evil' characters being utterly bad, mean , nastly and all arounf just not good.. then let 'em! They are supposed tobe evil! Lok at the team servers.. the numberes are WAY in the good's corner.. the number of evils on these servers is soo outnumbersed but hey they stil try.. hell i play 'eveil' characters and 'good' characters! <BR>If the 'good' guys are over run bythe 'bad' guys then so be it.. doesn't always have to be like the movies... then the good guys would be the under dogs for once sheesh!<BR>I fully support the one character per rp server even though i play 12 characters across 3 different servers... granted my characters on the blue servers and even teams are collecting dust presently... but only because becasue i thik tht true pvp fosters rp also... at least for those of us who want the very best experience and i do not mea this as in game experience.<BR>I like the fact that when i travel in hostile territory hat i have to watch out for EVERYBODY and not just the npc's... t makes me paranoid as hell wearin my gear when i know at any second some naked ganker may try an kill me fr it.. but het they areevil so what!  Wearin my gear gives me an edge so i have more of a chance 1 on 1 ... gettin slaughtered by a death squad sucks but hey man..... get into your own group then if you are afraid...<BR>Maybe I am noy makin sence cuz like i said i had a lait nite and i 'm kinda drunk but a rp server would totally rock cuz i hate runnin into the kewl dooz when i am imersed into my game.... suddenly iam back on earth again... i play eq to b in norrath, earth is good but norrath is my escape. Please make it so i CAN escape into this beautiful world please!? Btw i thnk many guys up here have excellent ideaads about th rp server like no shout ooc, no coomon tongue and such. Make the game way harder for the kewl doodz and they wont play.<BR>maybe i am wrong but as it is now the rp's are dispersed throughout all the servers and so the population is sparse at best on any one servers but if yu labled one as RP only and changed a few thinges then we'd all know whereto go and ciyld regulate the game ourselves then on out.<BR>I know eq was supposed to be a RP game on every server but it is too successful now days and has atracted too many non-rp's . te power gmers syndrome to 'conquer' thegame is too much.... it's not the destination that counts, but how one gets there that matters... please help us realize our dream!<BR>                      Thank you-<BR>                         a very loyal gamer,<BR>                                Ilijit

Excellent point Dice about people using the RP excuse to just be jerks. Was going to respond to this myself when seeing the mention of House Velhr as a RP guild LOL (Will shut up an be nice now). <P>Ok about Dark elfs (I know this is going to bring up controversy as it always does) I play a "Good" Dark elf, my story (And i'm stickin to it) is that my mother (A Dark Elf) fell secretly in love with my father (A human) who was trying to bring the word of light to any Dark elfs who wished to change their ways.  My mother who struggled with her own light and dark sides eventually came to see the light but was found out and ostrasized by her own race, she was cast out to raise her only child (Darktalya) on her own teaching her the way of light. <P>Playing a good Dark elf would in my opinion be an ultimate RP challenge in a RP environment and great fun as well.<P>With all the other issues aside, i think the thing that urks me the most is people shouting OOC across the zone and the wide acceptance of this making RP almost non existant on most servers.  <P>People all have their own RP styles and in my opinion should be able to RP their own style with some acceptions.  <P>A. NO ooc except in OOC channel which can be turned off.<P>B. using RP as an excuse to ruin other peoples RP enjoyment I.E KSing, harassment Etc...<P>PvPing is a big yuck for me.  Altho i know RP involves PvP it is something i personally cant stomach. This would be the only reason I personally might not go to a RP server.  Not saying its a bad thing or people shouldnt do it, i just cant stomach PvP.  Heck i get physically ill watching a duel LOL.  <P>I used to play Dragonrealms and 1 thing i liked about it is they had a class called Empath, they were the only class who could heal. They also could not hunt or kill anything without losing some abilities. It was widly accepted you do not steal from or attack an empath, giving those who couldnt stomach PvP an option to RP without PvP.<P>Darktalya Faran<BR>Level 56 Mage of Rodcet<BR>Proud wife of Gadbois Faran<P>

While I do like the idea of a dedicated roleplaying server, I have to disagree with a couple of points I've seen so far.<BR>1.  The lack of a common language.  While this might make rping more necessary, wouldn't it also make the game unduly difficult in some cases?<BR>2.  Team vs Team PVP roleplaying.  Doesn't team vs. team inherently limit the amount of roleplaying one can do, if you're dark elf is automatically "evil", or you dwarf "good?"  While I do believe PvP to be an improtant aspect of an RP server, I do think that having the freedom to develop your character as you see fit would be required.  Without getting overcomplicated with that whole PvP faction issue, there may be a couple of possible solutions: A)  GM or EQ run "guilds."  I like the idea, but I think we are overcomplicating the issue.  Aren't the various religions and sects diverse enough to accomodate almost every circumstance.  If these were utilized to their fullest, with players having free selection of religious standing regardless of race or class, and likewise the ability to select their starting point based on religion or sect rather than race (similar to the Paineel division, but with more versatility.)  Wouldn't this allow for a greater degree of roleplaying.  If this worked, then I like the idea of Team vs Team based on those parameters. B) The ability to change sect or religion, through quests or actions that affect faction.  These would probably be epic quests, but wouldn't they add variety to the realm as a whole.  C) Final Death - I hate to even bring this up, but wouldn't people roleplay and cooperate alot more if their characters death after 5th, or even 10th level, was final.  Obviously ressurections and such would be available within a certain period of time, probably similar to the current corpse decay time.  While that might be harsh, can you imagine how attached and dedicated people would become to their characters, beyond the point they are now?<P>In closing, I want to say that I don't honestly believe the RP server is a workable idea in the current game.  Honestly, the lack of continuity, the continued availability of Epic Quests and "unique" items interefere a great deal with the persisten atmosphere needed for a truly satisfying roleplaying experience.<BR>

I think there should be an equal mix of detterants and rewards for roleplayin -- that way players that are new to roleplaying wont think that the whole server is out to get them.  Also as for PvPing there should be lvl ranges just like with experience sharing.  If the warrior cons red to the shaman the warrior should not be able to attack him(classes are just an example).  I also agree that roleplaying is its own reward but players new to roleplaying most likely see it that way until they actually roleplay.  The way the game has become people see a new NPC and they immediately say "lets kill it".  This definitely needs to me rememdied.  I also think hat there should be some "safe" zones and areas where PvPing cannot occur.  Although this may not be realistic it is a way to keep people from being killed by someone seeking that rusty weapon while they attacking a bat.

Role-playing Server by geez I wish we could have one.  The race war server tried but allocated races that would not really work together.  As far as people saying evil races would be at a disadvantage not true, just look at your own servers and see how many people play dark elves, fine a grp of high elves camp outside nek forest, kill few dark elves, what would happen is a gang of dark elves zone out into commons and slaughter the high elves.<P>What I'd love to see is the dark races combining forces and one day clear the towns of felwithe and wood elf tree city, imagine the sight of 40 trolls and ogres zoning in the with their dark elf allies at the wizard port in g fay and going on a rampage, I live for the day to see that.<P>What would make a role-playing derver more interesting is to allow only one char on this server, with say nine lives once the nine lives are up your char is deleted, this would make for better roleplaying and stop mass killin, imagine having a character hunted down and your killed on site by many people for committing murderous tendacies, obviuosly code would have to be done to facilatate this, lets say your name above the char changes color for every pvp you do.<P>I also believe to really facilatate a role-playing server religion and faction need to play a major part, with the introduction of equipment that displays the symbol of a god, and should a paladin and a shadownight grp instead of gettin experience they get negative instead, likewise rule would apply for dark elves and high elves grping together.<P>I am all for a rpg server, come on verant/sony the games been out 2 years its about time your give us rpger's a server of our own.<P>Keaira 53 gnome rogue <BR>

Life is good... To even see verant Discussing this issue is something that I've been waiting for for over a year! And after reading through most of the posts on this page it seems the vote is in the RPers favor.<P>I read through the loooong post on casters ralm and I think that they are going perhaps just a bit deep into the subject. All we really need is a server that is tagged as a role plays server (RP server) After that, I have faith in the general population of the server to keep things in order. Perhaps my hope is misplaced, But I have a strong beliefe in my fellow RPers to push out the kill/loot/sell/repeaters.<P>That's my 2cp<P>Brunder Battleblades.

All i got to say is YES do it.<BR>I agree with alot of people its virtually impossible to rp on the existing servers with people in /ooc talking about the superbowl etc or flaming one another to try and get on peoples ignore lists, do away with /ooc, limit /shout to yell range etc. Have it so that u can only have one character on the server, no common language but maybe good's can talk to good's and evil to evil regardless of race. Also i think no transfering of characters would be a good idea completely start from scratch thus the character personality will develop with the character rather than say a lvl 50 thats never been rp'd before suddenly developing a persponality and traits etc.<P>well can think of loads more things but wont bore u's any longer part from to say i hope it happen, and i'll definitly be playing on it if it does happen!

I have been looking forward to a roleplaying encouraged server since just after I started playing EverQuest.  After reading discussions on message boards and talking with my roleplaying friends, I have come up with a few suggestions to offer.<BR>First suggestion, the logistics of enforcing 'roleplaying' are nigh unto impossible.  With a few thousand players to 'police', there will always be 'incidents'.  And of course, there is always the debate as to what qualifies as roleplaying.  Therefore I think it might be a bit inappropriate to name a server 'Roleplaying Only'.  <BR>As a roleplayer I tend to 'tune out' the non roleplayers and 'focus' on the roleplayers I have met.  From what I have gathered most roleplayers do this as well.  My suggestion would be to make the proposed server 'Roleplaying Encouraged'.  <BR>It should be a place for roleplayers to gravitate to.  The expextation that everyone on such a server will roleplay is unrealistic, but shouldn't detract from the large number of players who do wish to roleplay.  My assumption is that if ten percent or so of any given server are roleplayers (a number I am pulling out of the air) then such a server could theoretically pull a large portion of those players into an environment to interact with each other, leading to possibly ideally a 2/3 or greater roleplaying population.  That would be great by me!  It would be nice to have a server that roleplayers were in a majority.  In my humble opinion, that is the ideal to aim for.<BR>Another suggestion would be add a few NPC's in starting cities, who could give tips on roleplaying when hailed.  I am aware of how ridiculous that sounds in a 'roleplaying' environment, but a suggested ettiquite and expectation of how to use the formats of the game may be very helpful, and alleviate a lot of early complaints.  Another and more obvious use for these NPC's is for players who are interested in Roleplaying, but don't yet have a clear idea of how.  This would give them some starting tips without being chastised by the more experienced players for their faux pas, and discouraged from playing.<BR>My last suggestion is for existing servers(in the rather likely event that a roleplaying server is not created) and deals with the /anon and /roleplay tags.  Currently it seems that /roleplay is more of a way of going anon (thus hiding yourself from lowbies who want a port/rez/locate etc.) while still proudly showing guild affiliation.  And why not?  If someone is in a guild but doesn't want to be bothered, why should they be?  Therefore, I am suggesting that the /anon system be updated.  <BR>Could it be possible to choose which items are anonymous, or un-seeable?  Such as hiding level, class, race, location, guild, or even your name independently? <BR>A quick example: /anon level on  /anon class off, Would read [Cleric] instead of [32 Cleric].  <BR>If such a thing is possible, could the /roleplay command make a tag that said [Roleplaying] on /who search lists instead of [Anonymous] with a guild tag?  This way other players can be alerted to a player's desire and/or expectation to roleplay, and take appropriate action, i.e. join in or avoid the weirdo. *giggle* <BR>If such an update is implemented, reputation could easily precede someone, so please do not make [Roleplaying] automaticly anonymous.  Let that be a choice made by the individual players.<BR>Those are my suggestions, thanks for reading.<P>-(Back in Character)<P>*Gracious Bow*<P>Vonhase Nobleheart, Knight of Felwithe<BR>32 Seasons in the Service of King Tearis Thex

I like the idea of a roleplaying only server, but there are too many problems that will go with it.<P>How do you define what is and isnt roleplaying. Especially when it comes to the interactions of good and evil aligned characters.<P>I for one rp, but I am married to a pally(cause i corrupted her in more then one way <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" border="0"> but that is beside the point). An evil could rp to be good inorder to get along with every one else, or may even rp to see the 'light'. If the teams are hard coded, you could really impede on everyone's fun. <P>I think this is the main reason VI doesnt want to try it. It's just to much of a hassle and people are far to unpredictable.

If there was a rp server some people would go there just to play with less lag/people and probably wouldn't care about rping and it would be hard to prove or force somonone to roleplay.

I strongly agree with an rp server.  Though, I disagree with getting rid of auctioning and /ooc.  While playing paper and pencil games(palladium books rules!!!!) and doing some free form RPing on IRC, I know that OOC is always present in roleplaying.  From a few wisecracks here and there to just a question one may have that can't be asked IC.  If you don't like the ooc or auctions you can always turn them off.  Its really simple to do so.  Options/chat filter, then find the OOC and Auction thinger and click it off.  For those of us that don't mind it, we can leave it on.  It makes people on both sides of the argument happy.  Though, I would say it starts off.  And, if you want those two options on, you have to make the effort, rather than making those who dislike it, turn it off.  Just my cp.  Though, personally, I really don't care what the server has.  As long as Verant makes a server and labels it RP server.  If someone's not RPing, theres always /ignore      <IMG SRC="tongue.gif" border="0"> <P>Xinoy Kuriakos, High Elf enchanter and Jewelry Crafter(106)<P>I just can't help but wonder how they'll handle my enchanter illusions...  or, wait..  did I just create another debate?

I'm all for a RP server... I think that everyone should be limited to one character, and that the languages should be racial only... As mentioned above, Dark Elves can only speak Dark Elvish with a slight ability to speak Dark Speach and maybe the languages of those races that Dark Elves are not hated by, like Ogres and such... This would rule out the ability of a Dark Elf having a conversation with a Human and so forth... Merchants should be the same way as guards should and so on... Languages should be learned from the guild masters in your characters starting city, or maybe the guild masters in cities that you have raised faction with, in which you will learn the basics, to get better at it you would have to speak it frequently, after awhile you would be able to speak it...<P>Shout should be yell range and ooc should be turned off or able to be turned off... Guild say should be turned off, and a drastic idea here... I think that there should be a way to write letters which you can leave at your guild office or what not, kind of like a in game message board of sorts... This would help the guild's and would help keep people within their homes, and may even make the cities of your character feel 'more like home' if that is possible...<P>Hmm, I'm getting tired of writting and the sun is up and I am now to sleep... So anyways I agree with everything said so far, and I fully agree with the enviroment changes mentioned earlier... How neat it would be to actually see the effects of war or the effects of a raid by your enemies on your city... Toppled buildings, a scarceness in supplies...<P>I said my thoughts... I now be on my way...<P>--------------------<P> <IMG SRC="http://www.jps.net/~niteravn/Demised.jpg""> <BR>33rd season Teir'Dal Dark Knight<BR>And the prophecy read, "Fear what you can not understand...

Why don't we compile a list of what everyone realistically wants and submit them to Verant?  I envision an EQ RP server being a lot like UO's Seige Perilous server, but not relying on PvP of course. <P>So here is what we want:<P>A server for us roleplayers!<BR>1. One character per account on the server only.<BR>2. Realistic speech (everyone does not speak common)<BR>3. As for "mobs" and NPC's, eliminate as much as possible fixed drops and fixed spawning times.<BR>4. Evil vs Good -- A high elf cleric that is good shouldn't be able to heal a Innoruk worshipping warrior -- or maybe he can, but takes damage himself or faction hits for doing so.  Or wrath of his God, ouch!<BR>5. Death penalty?  I think it should be avoidable for a price -- Actually I dont know if this is possible with the code, but how about just being knocked unconscience until everyone around you is knocked out, then the monsters will kill you, but if people survive and kill them first you shouldn't be dead, just unconscience -- But for death, people with a lot of money should be able to spend it on priests or healers from their religions to get them back to their status -- money can buy anything!<BR>6. Shout limited to yell distance.<BR>7. OOC eliminated.<BR>8. Auction available only in towns (if at all)<BR>9. Guild say not available unless you have a "guild crystal communicator" or something like that (like in UO)<BR>10. Names should not be shown overhead.<BR>11. /who command eliminated, or reduced so it doesnt show level or guild.<BR>12. All classes only bindable in cities? (suggestion)<BR>13. Evil vs. Good is based on both race and religion -- a human worshipping Innoruk shouldn't be fighting on the same side as a Paladin of Mith Marr, etc..<BR>14. GM's should roleplay characters as well -- and be able to ban people that blatently don't roleplay.<BR>15. GM's also should be very involved in dynamic quests for the server -- or get some good guides/etc to have the power to create quests as well, and often! (At least a couple a day would be great!)<BR>16. Official guilds are a great idea -- The Soldiers of Tunare, Warriors of Innoruk, etc -- All named after your deity, etc.  Maybe some player subguilds of those, i.e, Soldiers of Tunare, Beta Legion, etc.. (just an idea)<BR>17. Obvious twinking should be frowned upon -- But you can't ban someone who gives a level 7 friend of his a good item that they don't need -- but if you see a level 7 warrior in full quest armor with a lamentation, etc -- something is rotten in Denmark  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"> (from a RP standpoint, twinking is somewhat realistic I guess... what if you are born into royalty? ah well.)<P>Anyway, that's all I have for now -- Let's submit this!

Many good and informitive posts, but we are searching for a dream that cannot be realised.  Look at the opposing views already about what is or isnt "roleplay".<P>Why "punish" the cleric or not let him heal?  In RP mindset, can we not argue that the cleric heals the dying warrior to try to get him to change religion to the healers god?  In DnD, my cleric always boasts of his god, and has had many players "convert" as they have seen the light hehehehe.<P>I like no common tongue, that finally gives a reason for people to learn languages.  But someone asked why would a Hi Elf learn DE?  Simple, for the same reason US people learned Russian, Russians learned English...to know what your possible opponent says and writes.  Join a group and dont understand each other?  Cool, now sit and learn a language seems appropriate.<P>There are many issues to a RP server, the biggest deciding on what is and isnt RP.  Get 20 RP people in a room and you will get 20 different answers.  As a RP'er, I dont understand why I take a "faction" hit when I kill someone/something and there is no witnesses.  Will Verant take away faction hits?  No.<P>Even on the issue of PvE and PvP it seems we are split (I hate PvP, the world is tough enough) <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">  Yet others, and rightfully so, say PvE is best RP.  Even then, to be real RP, I think a PvE RP server would have anyone able to kill anyone...Why?  If I am in a group and the rogue decides to PP the mob and cheat the group, then the Pali or anyone else should be able to kill him for that act of betraying the groups trust.<P>Only 1 char?  Why?  RP is the ability to RP any character.  If we set up a RP server people should be able to RP any number of characters.  Many old timer DnD people have.  Most seem to post that only 1 char will stop/slow twinking or "farming".  I dont think anything will stop farming other than random loot drops because greedy people will always be greedy.  Twinking will still occur if I "RP" and my "Aunt Darktalya" thinks it dishonourable to let me face the world in a tunic...so generously would give me "spare" items she has in the bank.<P>I could go on, but you get the basic idea, we can not get a true RP server...we can get close, but it can never be RP as many thirst for.<P>--------------------<P>Burzug Ironfyst, Paladin, Rodcet Nife<BR>"It is an honour to serve others"
