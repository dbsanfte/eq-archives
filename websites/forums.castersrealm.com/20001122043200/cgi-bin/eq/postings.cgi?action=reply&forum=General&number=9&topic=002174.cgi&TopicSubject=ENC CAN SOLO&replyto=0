I've been spending a good deal of my time in-game beating the living (dead?) hell out of the Oasis Spectres. Mainly for two reasons: Good XP, and thanks to my work scheduel none of my friends are on when I am. This leaves me a bit restricted when it comes to landing a group as I am also on during the off-hours of the server.<P>I can, and have been able to, pull five Spectres off the island... killing them all and getting XP for all of them. With our Charm and Mesmerize lines we are nearly unstoppable... save for mana and not having a snare-like spell.<P>Yes, Charm isn't 100% reliable... but if you keep calm and in control of the situation, you will have no fear of a brake or the ever so fun "one second" duration charms.<P>Or maybe it is hard to get two mobs where you are hunting... do what I refer to as "Mez Kite". Drop your highest MR debuff on the creature then mesmerise it. Run to max range then nuke it. Mesmerise it... back to max and nuke again. If you get pressed for mana, use the longer duration Mez'es for a breather. There are a few times, thanks to resists and fizzels, that I've taken a breather next to my sleeping prey. Using a timer makes Mez management a bit easier too.<P>Don't have too much fun with your new friends.<P>------------------<BR>Fezzen *long german last name which I can't remember how to spell*<P>Enchanter of the 36th Circle<BR>Master in the arts of Dying</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#DEDFDF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ealar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aye we are an amazing solo class, but it takes skill and quick reactions to do it right.

Being able to outpace the Specs make them very easy to solo... but you can do them without JBoots / SoW.<P>From sheer stupidity on my part (Bound in West Commons, wandering about in Frontier Mountains aimlessly), I was forced to earn back 39th naked. Only thing different from solo'ing them with gear is you have to run around a bit more.

Shoot, I have been soloing for quite sometime.  Hehe, best thing to get through 35 is soloing.  Long and boring, but easy and a crap load faster than grouping.  Now, at 39th, I group with one charater, a druid.  Why, because he pulls multiple mobs and we both AOE all of them to death.  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">  I love Gravity Flux!<P>Calinis Dreammaker 39th<BR>Povar</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#DEDFDF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Taeinea</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">In general, this method isn't much different from doing crowd control in a regular group.  The primary difference is that you have an unwilling tank, who could turn on you at any moment, and no backup when resists happen.<P>Hmmm... only five spectres to deal with?  Cast Mesmerization on all of them, then charm one.  Then re-cast Mesmerization to hold the uncharmed four.  Move a bit away, and when the spell break message (for mesmerization) appears (meaning that your charmed spectre is no longer mesmerized), sick him after one.<P>Then kite-enthrall the others while the first two battle it out.  (By kite-enthrall, I mean enthrall them while keeping yourself out of their melee range.)  Or just keep holding them with Mesmerization.  Med in the meantime.<P>While meditating, stay away from the two who are currently fighting, and stand up and look at what's happening between mana regen ticks (unless you're already 35th level...).  Don't trust the "your charm has worn off" message, as it sometimes appears sometime after you're being smacked around by your former pet.<P>Add a DD or two to the first non-charmed spectre to help ensure that your charmed buddy wins the fight.<P>If charm breaks early, liberally use enthrall or mesmerization or color flux (if you're unlucky enough to be in melee range with a spectre) to restore control.  Just don't get yourself caught in the area of effect for mesmerization if you can help it.<P>Once the first spectre is down, once the other spectres are completely under your control, enthrall the injured one, charm a different spectre, and send the new charmee to fight the formerly charmed, quite injured spectre.  Charming the others in turn helps guarantee that you get all the XP for all the kills, since a full-health spectre will probably defeat a well injured spectre, which your formerly charmed spectre should be.<P>You can also work on spreading the spectres out by allowing them to break mes/enthrall without re-applying it; then individually stop them, some distance from each other, and then use Memory Blur to make 'em forget and go back home (if five at a time is too much...).  Just beware that you could get lots of younger characters killed when the spectres start wandering if you do this too near them (or when the spectres start pathing all the way around the lake...).<P>Separating them like this would be important for the purpose of keeping them from re-aggroing each other if the Memory Blur doesn't work on one or more of them.  Then again, if you're expert enough to separate them like this, you probably won't have much difficulty taking on all five.<P>The biggest cost of this method is the charm spells themselves; you would ordinarily only need one or two DD's on the first spectre to be slain in order to guarantee that the charmed spectre wins; after that, by charming different spectres to use on the injured spectres, no additional DD is required.<P>To avoid the problems associated with insta-break charms, wait until the spectres are already mesmerized/enthralled before charming.  This means you have a few seconds less on your charm duration, but an insta-break charm is very recoverable and results in no damage.<P>Of course, keep your best Rune spell up.  The loot from the spectres will more than cover the costs.<P>And, since you are in Oasis, you should have absolutely no problems trading Clarity for SoW.<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#F7F7F7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Taeinea</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Somehow, I left out "intentionally break charm (hide or invis), and then" just before "enthrall the injured one" in the seventh paragraph.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#DEDFDF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hikaru Sunstryder</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">About being in Tim Deep with the Spirocs.
