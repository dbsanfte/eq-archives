</FONT><HR>    And I would refer you to my thread earlier about me not thinking about this being a race, and as far as I can see I am the only one other than a select few who does care... I have seen a total of about 4 people do anything at all to even help advance this quest, weather they did advance it or they closed off a possible avenue and lost valuable items, they helped.<BR>    I'm the only one who's posted relevant information on this particular message board (aside from a few people with good spirits who were willing to help at the beginning who have since moved on to boards where there’s less flaming retards like yourself) only to have people come on, like you, and re-post the info, then flame me for a bunch of gay stuff, that in your mind "sounds" like it's legit...  <BR>    Obviously not that many people care what I post because I've gotten 2 replies--not just to my post, but to this whole thread--in the last THREE days... that tells me a lot... it makes me proud to be a monk, in a community of those who care where our class goes, and in all honesty I don't play EQ any more I've been here only logging on to EQ to find out new info, search for new NPC's etc, other than that been playing Diablo 2.  <BR>    You can think what ever you want, but don't blame me for what you think is wrong.  I never once stated I was the only one who cares, I used a figure of speech and did, however say that only about 12 people were working on it.  Is this an actual, factual statistical number I researched and drew a consensus of 12 on?  No, it's called a Figure of Speech, as stated above, the exact figure of speech being a Hyperbole, i.e. a Gross Exaggeration, obviously more than 12 people have worked on our quest so far, this is used to signify only a mediocre amount of the overall general populace has worked on it, which, from what I have seen from looser flamers like you, is true.<BR>    I have never once on this board personally told someone to "get a life" or flamed them unless firstly flamed, but to you, I say stfu and go play with your little twinkie iksar self.  I'm a level 50 Iksar myself, but I'm d*** sure you didn't spend time getting items like I did.  Do you have full planer items already?  Do you have a CoF, Jade Mace, and Wu's Trance stick?  Did you earn them yourself, or twink them?  Until you can answer all of those questions with out fear of being flamed as a loozer l33wt fr34k or continuing your statement with a "yes, but..." then stfu and get the hell off of the big league boards put here to help us in exploring every possible avenue of our classes epic quest.  If you don't have anything pertinent to add to the conversation, then don't say anything at all.<BR>    I will, however, expect a fully flamed reply from you and your 12 year old mentality, in which you follow society in the "d00d u sux0r, get a life!" flames.  So please, feel free to flame me, the person who came to these boards and tried to keep them alive for visiting monks who don't know of other, new and better epic quest/Monk message boards.<P>I've said my peace, and continuously await your fully flamed reply, to which I can reply and, once again, shoot you out of the sky.<P>p.s. Feel free to use a dictionary, as I know your feeble mind can't comprehend half of the post, so you might as well just admit you needed your ol’ pal Webster's help on it and hopefully you learned a few new words in the process.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=127&topic=000006.cgi&ReplyNum=000052&forum=Class+Super+Items&TopicSubject=Monk+Quest">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>And, he was 45, I aquired him by lossing one of my close friends in battle, Zamadar, the level 32 Human Monk for him, and Razik came without armor, doesn't mean I twinked him with his items.  I earned them. I've been to fear, gotten all the items, been to Naggy/Vox, almost won Gofm, but lost by like 3 numbers, and was at least in the random for a vox bracer, but I didn't come close on that one. =(</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=127&topic=000006.cgi&ReplyNum=000054&forum=Class+Super+Items&TopicSubject=Monk+Quest">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>"...the person who came to these boards and tried to keep them alive for visiting monks who don't know of other, new and better epic quest/Monk message boards."--Namru Firewalker<P>I don't intend this board to keep up with Monkley Buisness, and I've had a while to cool down, I just don't take kindly to people flaming me or personally assulting me who don't know me(not you Ashana, the other you, you had a perfectly valid point, just as the case would be, Razik came stripped, and I had to loose a similar level monk, along with another char to get him, so I feel my only crime is changing race really.  But still, a valid point on your end, non-the-less, depends on your definition) or at least having some reason to tell me to "get a life" when nothing was said to insult them, or that should have even offended them.  He did this to me, so I retaliated, and I'm still expecting he responce sometime soon, or waiting for a bunch of anonymous players to all of a sudden start posting who don't like me, either of the two would be him.<P>Sigh, I ramble too much, I know, but if I'm even playing the game, and I see you on, I'll send ya a tell Ash, because from what I can see, your fairly cool, even knowing I didn't get Razik till he was lvl 45 or so... You didn't flame me for it, you simply stated it, which is how things should be.  And I thank you for that.<P>Anyhow, it's early, and time to leave for school, so peace, and take care Monk Community, even the person I just flamed, because my rant is over with, and if you post info here again, I'll accept it with trust, as long as it's not more of that garbage from above(and I do know that I just said I expect a flame from him above, which I do, but this is encompassing that, unless it's some god-awful flame about a bunch of meaningless redundant statments.. this SHOULD be my last post on these boards about this tho, I took this thread WAY off topic.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=127&topic=000006.cgi&ReplyNum=000055&forum=Class+Super+Items&TopicSubject=Monk+Quest">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>"...I come from a winning server if you will"<P>ROFL, Namru you lame idiot shut the hell up.  You're the first moron that came on this board and started belittling people. <BR>If you know so much, whats the stats on your new epic quest item genius because obviously you've finished it by now since yer just sooooo smart.<BR>Just because not everyone here took a big risk like turning in their RotWF and stuff like that it doesnt mean they arent TRYING. People are out there searching zones for what they can find.  They come here and post information they think will help in the furthering of this quest and all you came here to do was be condescending and brag about your "full planar, gofm and WU'S TRANCE STICK"....ooooh!! well whoopty freakin doo.  All hail to the great Namru.  <BR>LOL, thanks very much Mr. LAME.<BR>"Pride in your class?"  you wanna know about pride in your class? i've been playing  a monk since day one.  Back when everyone though monks sucked and thought the idea of them not being able to wear armor or wield weapons was just the crappiest thing ever. No one wanted a monk in their group. I stuck with my class. I loved the idea that i didnt have to rely on equiptment, but rather my skill to keep me going.  Although i feel i am one of the better equipt monks on my server but certainly not the best, i understand that the equiptment doesnt make the monk. <P>Good job everyone on the progress so far everyone, keep up the good work.

</FONT><HR>All hail the great monk with no weapons armor, or skill whatsoever but has been playing since day one!<P>I never said people wern't trying, and I never said you have to loose something mighty to be considered trying, check out the last time anything relevant was posted on this thread to our quest by anyone other than me, it's about what, a month ago, I'm trying to keep THIS thread alive for people who don't know better, Mr. Graeat "From the beginning" Monk.  All hail he who is inexpireanced and a reatrd from day one!  I'm not the first person who started flaming, me saying I was from what, I CONSIDERED a winning server was nothing to do with this at all, it was letting the guy who asked me why I thought of this as a race know that I might not take a "loss" as well as I could, because my server has had many achivments, wich I am very proud of... Tell me to stfu all you want, and be mature about it...  Hell, I mean, you MUST be the mature one, I see you, like what, 3 days after my post, AND after I appologized to the guy for flaming him, you came and re-opend a closed argument, just to put yourself in the middle and put your whole friken piggy bank in, when no one even wanted your first 2 cents.  And actually, I, most assuradly unlike you, can make an educated guess at what our weapon might be, being as smart as I am and all, by your own admission (recognize the sarcasim, I'm not that self-prideful--Mr. I'm the blood and sweat of the Monk class, I had it rough when I wanted it easy.)  In fact, about having a CoF etc etc, I never even said I did have them, it was implied, but never outright said, how do you know that I didn't just pick what is considered to be the pinnacle of equipment for our class?  The time I actually said I had the equip was AFTER someone I know said that I didn't aquire the char until he was lvl 45, which I lost a (blood and sweat from early on, pre-kunark started) lvl 32 human monk for, and I explained I still 'earned' the stuff he had by my own means, not by twinking...<P>So Mr. Blood and sweat, lets open up some more closed issues, take this thread off the topic some more, so you can look at your Britany Spears movies that you downloaded off of the internet and masturbate intentlly while popping the zits on your for-head... sorry for making it personal, but I'm starting to get a little pissed.<P>Thanks for your time, and have a great life Mr. Anonymous Blood and Sweat when I wha wha whaaaa... Someone hold my hand while I take a piss.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=127&topic=000006.cgi&ReplyNum=000057&forum=Class+Super+Items&TopicSubject=Monk+Quest">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Oh yeah, I almost forgot...  In order for me to consider you 'trying' to help, you wouldn't even have to do much, I consider the guy who said "Nope, I checked all of Steamfront for a new spawn, that could be trunt, but didn't find anything" to be trying, or even the guy who just takes all the info and puts it in one nice neat little thread, he tried, he tried alot more than you, I also forgot, my educated guess on our weapon, is it will be around a 1.5 ratio, and proc Fists of Mastery xx Second stun, with a 500 DD.<P>Glad to make your day, because I'm sure you knew that already.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=127&topic=000006.cgi&ReplyNum=000058&forum=Class+Super+Items&TopicSubject=Monk+Quest">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>    Alright all you little b*tches need to stop squabbling and get back to the point of this message board. Information about our quest. Im sick and tired of all this sh*t that keeps being posted about who's so high and mighty all all the other sh*t that taken up way to much space already. I man c'mon one person makes one coment and you fell the need to write an entire f*ckin paragraph falming him back, when all he told you to do was get a life. Flaming is a waste of f*ckin space so you all need to shut the hell up and get on with you lifes. <P>     Ya ya, I know you gonna say im a contridicting bastard for yelling at you all about flaming when this message in its is a flame. But this is the first time and only time that I will ever flame this board, cause frankly I tired of reading all your sh*t thats been posterd here over the last few days.<P>     So quit your f*cking flaming eachother back and forth and start posting some information that really matters. And if someone happens to post something that already been said who cares! just skip reading that post and on to the next one and wallah your problem is solved.<P>     Now of course I'm expecting to get some good flame responses from all you f*cking 12 year olds out there, however you can flame the sh*t out of me, but its not gonna do any good, since franly I don't have a flying f*ck what you think of me.<P>     So to recap STOP THE F*CKING FLAMING! and get back to the real info.<P>And thats about all I have to say about that!<P>Thanks,<P>Raine Shadowfist<BR>48th Level Monk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=127&topic=000006.cgi&ReplyNum=000059&forum=Class+Super+Items&TopicSubject=Monk+Quest">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Right... ok, now that that rant is done with lets get this board back on track, so here's just a tidbit of new info, incase anyone out there missed it<P><BR>"Due to some difficulties regarding the Epic Quests implemented two patches ago, the epic quests for the Monk, Wizard, and Druid will not be completable until the next patch.

</FONT><HR>The stated "difficulties" with the monk quest is someone was handing the scale from Eejag in to Kerian over and over, getting mass amounts of exp, something like lvl 54-60 in 2 days.<P>So next server side patch will prolly remove the EXP component and put him back in, or he'll give you a differant item when he hands back the "scale"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=127&topic=000006.cgi&ReplyNum=000061&forum=Class+Super+Items&TopicSubject=Monk+Quest">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">
