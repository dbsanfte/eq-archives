I was looking over our new SoL spells today,  oh and I was so overjoyed.  At level 9 we get a spell that's exactly the same as snare exept for one thing, thats right folks, different names.  Oh, and I just loved the archery buffs. Now we can hit the mob for 20 dmg 90% of the time.  We get a self only 75 Hp 70 Atk 14 Ac 20 Dmg Shield at 60, I'm not too disappointed in that.  Pallies get mini aegolism btw.  I don't see why verant can't seem to correct these mistakes that're so obvious, or why add spells that we don't even need?  I'd rather have TRUE NORTH than 800 variations of a root spell and 3 different types of snare.  <P>Offense hybrid? Hah, we're doing same melee damage as warriors vi said it themselves.  Meanwhile War has 2x as many hps.  I guess our 117 dmg dot at 39 makes up for it?<P>This is pathetic, I can't tank shiz, I have small dmg output, my spells suck.  I understand were a class that has minor skillz in every field.  Why? dunno, healing for 90 at 52, I cast it constant and it's like a regen.  Or I could just cast our brand new 5 min duration 100 mana regen spell at 49, might be decent? If I could cast it over 2 times without being oom.  I had to sacrifice wisdom to get my strength over 80.  <P>I'd just like to either be able to solo, or get a group.  If you have some awesome skillz, rangers can be pullers, fd class is better for doing that.  Could snare in dungeons, druid would be better for that.<BR>Could tank, any class be better than ranger.<BR>Damage output, 80% of the classes can do equal/more/shizloads more than rangers.<BR>What're rangers good at? Nothing.<BR>Why? VI probably couldn't tell you that.<P>Bottom line is, Rangers need improvements BAD and VI is ignoring this, and has been for a long time.  Everyone in-game is aware rangers suck,  but verant isn't?  I find that hard to believe.<P>Kilivek ManaSponge 52 Ranger Rodcet Nife

After reading your post I highly doubt that you are level 52, you just think you are level 52.  First off the level 49 dot reduces ac by 14 or so and does 250dmg, second off we outdamage warriors.  We are not tanks, that is true, but we don't need to be.  Second off your quote about the arrow damage, now my current ranger is only level 35 but hits for 27 dmg with his trueshot and crits for 48 half of the time.  I didn't have to sacrfice wisdom items on my wood elf ranger to have a strength of 110, dex of 110, agl of 125, and wis of 100, and no I'm not twinked, I accually did most of the ivy etched quests with a few friends of mine.  I wield a pair of iceteeth still as well as a berzerkers sword and I still outdamage anyone that I group with.  I hardly ever group however, the main reason that I am a ranger is so I can depend on myself to do things, I don't need a druid to cast sow on me, I don't need someone to buff me and I don't need someone to debuff what I'm fighting.  If you can't stand being that best at nothing then stop being a ranger.  The only way that you could possibly have gotten to level 52 with knowledge like that is some serious plvlin and major twinking.

Sry no one in their right mind waste time pl'ing a ranger. 250 dmg dot, 14 ac reducer?<BR>Gd thats just soo freakin uber.  btw it's resisted lots, takes mana of course.  I think i'm 52? Wth? Under my info it says Level 52 maybe it's glitched or something.<BR>27 with trueshot. wow. 49 crit. wow.  <BR>You depend on yourself to do things,  SoW level 30 Ranger spell level 9 shaman spell level 14 druid spell.  Nice gap.  You can buff yourself for 75 hps at 60, grats. (Maybe half a hit?)  35 you can tank decent, and do decent amounts of damage. 50+ Different story, please EXPERIENCE these things for yourself before critizing others.<BR>P.S. You don't need anyone to debuff, sow, or buff.  What about doing damage and healing? =)<BR>--Manasponge

Wow I didn't think anyone who is 52 could know so little about the class they play.<BR>Lets see first of all the new snare type spell is not the same as snare.. It has a .5 sec casting time.. Ask most rangers and 90% will say they love this spell, it is one of the most useful spells we got with this expansion.<P>Second even though VI says we are supposed to do the same damage as warriors I can outdamage almost all the warriors I group with if we have similar equip. And thats just with melee, let me throw in a couple call of flames and I easly outdamage them.<P>Lets see third I at 56 can tank most mobs (non-uber) with not that much trouble. It just requires that the healer your with be a little more careful.<P>Fourth your spells suck? Man your must get different spell that I do because the ones I get come in very useful in groups and soloing. Whats your wisdom 10? Just wondering if casting a 100mana spell twice makes you go oom. Druids better at snaring? haha thats a good one.<P>About 80% of the classes doing more dam than us?... First you can't compare caster classes and melee classes, not the same thing junior.<BR>Out of the melee classes you will find 2 that outdamage us most of the time..  Monks and Rogues.<P>Rangers used to be one of the weaker classes but we have had many upgrades and tweaks that have balanced us out. We are in fact one of the most balanced classes in the game right now. True some are still over-powered but deal with it.<P>One of the reason the 'Rangers suck' thing is still rolling around is because of people like you who 1. Lack the skill to play a ranger properly..  2. Lack the intelligence to play a ranger properly..  3. Cry and whine like children about how bad we suck..<P>So I think I speak for most of the ranger community when I say please bring your Char up on the select screen and hit that delete key. Please take one for the team.<P>Lulian Moringlight<BR>Ranger of the 56th season.<BR>Officer of the Order of the Illuminati on The Tribunal.<P>And I wasn't planning on insulting anyone in this post but the more I read the original post the more it pissed me off.    <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">

Er caster damage isn't the same thing?  Sry but damage and damage seem like same thing?<BR>We can't snare better than druids?<BR>Druids get best snare on their epic, other than that they get the same snare as us.  <BR>Rangers suck?  Go duel sk plz.<BR>You can tank at 56, I can to, when mobs slowed, I have aego/focus, etc etc. Or it's a skeleton.<P>Please come up with some facts instead of this "10 on the whinometer" or whatever the hell.  Give me a reason not to complain.<BR>We can probably outdamage a warrior,  nuking dotting etc.  They have 2x as many hps, basically 20 second invincability.  We have a .5 casting time snare. <P>I'm stupid?  I'm the one that notices how much rangers need help.  You people that call them uber awesome ninja l33t shiz are stupid.  They're good at moments like when you're trying to find your way around in the snow, but when you're trying solo....<P>If you're going to post, don't do it just to get a lot of posts on your record.  Have a reason.  No one cares if i'm at 10 on the whinometer,  think before you post ppl.<P>--53 ManaSponge

I agree that the new spells we received with the release of SoL are not very helpful for the most part. I'm a level 52 Ranger and I basically don't cast any of them.<P> As far as the ones we already have, well you're crazy if you don't love them. <P>"You can buff 75 HP's at level 60." <P>What? At level 52 I can add ~190 HP's, ~65 AC, and ~50 ATK with my buffs. I was sticking full Firestrikes (302pt DD's) on garangas last night in Maiden's Eye and easily keeping up with the damage of a level 53 Warrior. She was standing right next to me, behind the MoB.<P>Who needs HP's and AC when ya don't get hit more than once or twice in 3 hours. I sure don't feel broken. As far as the same damage as Warriors. Well, I think you misunderstood. We are on the same damage table as Warriors. Warriors however do not share our ATK buffs, not to mention the innate ATK bonus for 55+ Rangers.<P>Um...heard of this Trueshot Disc? Weaponshield? Call of the Predator?<P>Do you really think that the Warrior/Pally/SK taking ripostes/dodges/parries/blocks from MoBs and getting stunned is outdamaging the Ranger /Rogue/Monk behind the MoB with the whoopass can opener? <P>You want to be overpowered? Go play a Rogue.<P>--------------------<P>Calyxto Chaos<BR>52nd Season Pathfinder of Tunare<BR>Dalridian Knights<BR>Terris-Thule

I am also a 52nd Ranger.  I'm wearing a mix of ThornyVine from Fear, and various armor pieces from Kunark and Velious.  I can't take huge hits without a cleric in my pocket, but I've filled in as main tank in certain situations.<P>What weapons are you swinging?  Think FAST.<BR>That's right.  Think FAST.  And get a haste item as soon as you can.  You can outdamage a Warrior, an unhasted Monk.  I don't even have so-called "uber" weapons.  I mix and match between Dragonbone Yak, Revultant Whip, and Flux-Bladed Axe.  I am also wearing an FBSS, also not an "uber" haste item.  You'll be surprised when you don't worry about huge damage per hit and switch to speed.  You'll actually have to worry about out-taunting the warrior big time. <P>Bows?  Well, I don't have the trueshot discipline yet, but I've crit hit a standing target for 196 with a Bow of the Underfoot(The Hole) and a Wrapped Velium Bow(Dragon Necropolis).  I'll be interested to see the result with Eye of The Falcon.<P>Think about it.  A 55% Snare with a cast of .5 secs?  I'm using it right now instead of mana-free Snare from Tolan's gloves.  Ensnare just takes too darn long.  And I stick both the lower level snares on Mobs in Seb, actually most anywhere, on a regular basis.  I am often asked by our warriors for "ranger buffs plz?", after the cleric, the chanter, the druid.  No, we are no MAJOR caster, but our spells can add to our usefulness to any group.<P>You need to look outside the box.  A lot of people spent a long time convincing Rangers they were "crippled".  But you have strengths and weaknesses.  Play to your strengths, not your weaknesses.  <P>Ask a Pallie or SK.  They might tell you they envy our damage output, or our utility spells.  I have very good Monk friend, my pulling partner for POF, who hates me because of my tracking.  Offer a warrior the ability to heal himself for 90 without mortgaginbg the farm for potions, and see him smile.  SOW, LEV, Endure Breath useful in a lot of places.  Stinging Swarm is a great puller in huge zones where you might sometimes lose a MOB with SOW.  Call of Flame is our best DD, 2 sec cast, the only DD I have that can match my dmg/time, and it's a decent finisher for running MOBs.<P>In a dungeon, monk outpulls me big time.  But, put me outdoors and I'll pull with the best of them.  You can even tick off the majority of druid pullers.  There are many more poorly played Druids than there are poorly played Rangers.  Hint - that first bowshot has no casting time.  And, yes, I can pull in Fear, but usually I tag for my Monk buddy.  We're currently trying to find a great Rogue to make the team complete.<P>Stop beating yourself up for what you are not.  You're only hurting yourself, Brother Ranger.  Find the right kind of friends, find the right mix of classes that offset each other's weaknesses.  If you let yourself have FUN with your Ranger, you'll be a better Ranger.  Jack up that AC to around the 900+ range, always carry a stack of peridots for that cleric who symbols you.<BR>Select your weapons thinking ginsu, not a meat cleaver. <P>I hope you'll take another look, and start to enjoy being what you are.  You'll never be a warrior or a druid.  And, at 52, you've put too much of yourself in your Ranger to just throw it away.   Have a little FUN. :<P>Gregar Mataennoo<BR>Ridgerunner<BR>Ranger 52<BR>Innoruuk Server<BR>Born Mar. 26, 1999

Just a few examples of why Rangers kick a$$.<P>1. Third-highest damage output for a melee class in the game, and that's without spells.<P>2. We tank better than the two melee classes that do more damage than us, given equal-valued gear.<P>3. No need to value low delay as much as Warriors do for taunt, particularly in the offhand, which doesn't get a damage bonus.<P>4. Ranjahs trak gud.     <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" border="0">  You might say that the Bard or Druid can Track as well (eventually), but would you rather send out the Bard/Druid, or the Ranger, during downtime?  I thought so.<P>5. We snare.  And we snare like gods.<P>6. Rangers look cool.<P>7. We can effectively do something that no other class in the game can do.  Bow kiting.  No other solo tactic is quite like this: practically zero mana cost, low risk of taking *any* damage, only need arrows and time.  Grab a Tolan's Bracer and you're home free.  Combine bow-kiting with melee'ing and you have a super-viable way to solo non-animals.<P>8. Speaking of animals, go solo clear up to 60th once you hit 22nd and get Panic Animal.  I've spoken with several Rangers who say that they got 99% of their xp 50-60 solo'ing, since most raids aren't done for the experience to begin with.  Who else can do this with a similar rate of xp gain (considering Rangers fear/snaring have almost zero downtime)?  Necromancer, Wizard, Druid.  That's it.  Other classes *can* solo at these levels, but can't match the sheer speed of xp accumulation that Rangers and the "solo casters" can.  Believe me... solo'ing as a Shadowknight, even with an Ebon Mace and a shield, fear-kiting medium blues... it ain't all that fast even at 53.  Invoke Fear sucks up a LOT of mana, as does Darkness, even with 117 Int.   <IMG SRC="frown.gif" border="0"><P>9. We get Spirit of Wolf.  'Nuff said.<P>10. Baby heals are better than nothing.  Ask a Warrior.<P>11. More incredible class-specific weapons than any other class besides the Monk and Shadowknight.<P>12. Our AC and HP is *FINE* for what a Ranger does.  Perhaps you've been trying to be the main tank on raids?

Some of you make good points.  <BR>1. That new snare...It sticks for 2 mins I understand you cast while the mobs running, but I just feel lazy sometimes =)  Ensnare is what? 2 seconds?  I'll only do about 5 damage in that 1.5 seconds anyway not that important.<BR>2. Track?  I'd rather have ports instead of a color coaded track with a nifty scrollbar (not complaining, but could be better).<BR>3. Damage--We can do more than a warrior in a sprint of damage but after we cast and cast in the next fight the warrior does the same steady damage.  We're an "offense hybrid" right?  Aren't we on same damage table has Warriors, Sk's, and Paladins?  Not to sure about that though.  <BR>Rangers get a FEW VERY awesome weapons, and when we get those, our speed epic, poa cloak yes we're good.  I guess VI is expecting everyone to kill Vulak and be in high-end guild?  These high-end items aren't possible for me to get yet, except for epic.<P>4. Spells--As Yuffie said "We get sow, 'nuff said".  At level 30,  druids get it in under HALF of that.  Once again i'm not complaining but maybe a little sooner?<BR>Hybrid between Druids/Warriors. Er.<BR>Druids get self ports at 19.  We don't.  Statistically we should get group ports, I would be VERY happy with self ports.  <P>We can solo animals, very nice I like this.  BUT it just doesn't cut it in dungeons and 50+ where it's very hard to find a safe camp with grindable animals. Call of Earth, nice.<BR>Call of Predator, good. 8 VARIATIONS OF ROOT WTF ARE THEY THINKING, er, i mean...bad?<BR>We have decent buffs...They shouldn't be much better, cept for regen a little earlier than Chrolo at 55.  <P>5. Heals--Baby heals? These are much worse.  Especially when monks can out bindwound me.  I can't keep up with shamans cannibing damage if I heal constant.  "'Nuff Said".<P>6. Hp/Ac--Everyone needs more ac/hp it's a fact of life.  I can tank, mob slowed, with all buffs possible.  Then I try to solo the mob without the buffs/slow and it just eats me. <P>7. Rangers look cool..*sigh*..This may vary or something.  Not much of a balancing fact either.<P>8. Greger said to play my strengths?  Clarify plz.  Wtf are they?<BR>I usually don't have a hard time getting the aggro off the warrior, unless I snare/nuke/taunt at the very start.  <BR>Haste: Sash of DragonBorn<BR>Prim Hand:Lamentation<BR>Secondary:Flamesong<BR>I did 1245 damage in about 1 minute on a blue sonic bat in SolB.Straight melee.<BR>Should I feel bad that Wizards can do that in one spell?  Or rogues in 5 Backstabs? <P>9. One question Yuffie, why wouldn't you rather send out the druid/bard to pull?  Because the group needs their mana or songs more than the rangers 8 root spells? I thought so.<BR> <BR>--53rd Manasponge

I thought so."<P>... um.. /bonk.  You just stated the EXACT same freaking thing *I* did.     <IMG SRC="tongue.gif" border="0">  Try to read a little more carefully next time.<P>Druids get SoW at less than half the level we do.  Well no duh.  Ask my Paladin when she finally got a Symbol spell as compared to a Cleric.  Same for SKs.  ALL hybrids get spells later than their parent class... that's why they're HYBRIDS.<P>As for Rangers not getting ports, well gee, my Shadowknight would really like the Dark Pact line of spells.  Not gonna happen though.  If hybrids got every spell and line that their parent classes did... well, you'd be hearing from a *ton* of very unhappy pure casters and priests.<P>As for Spirit of Wolf, why the heck do you need it pre-30th?  Up 'til that point and sometimes even afterward, a corpse recovery is virtually danger-free and takes five to ten minutes.  You don't really need to travel anywhere far away from a town or port site.  Rangers get SoW when it actually starts to become important.  I'd *LIKE* to have it earlier, but there's no justifying reason why we should.<P>And in case you haven't played EQ for a while, Rangers USED to get Spirit of Wolf at *39*, not 30.  Verant lowered it quite some time ago, when Pallies got Resist Magic at 30 and SKs got something else.<P>Don't like the 8 root spells?  No one's forcing you to buy them.  You think Paladins actually frequently use half of their available spells?  Do you really think that Shadowknights use half of theirs on a regular basis?  Hell no.<P>You want better heals than a Ranger's baby heals?  Play a Paladin.     <IMG SRC="tongue.gif" border="0">  Simple as that.  You want to have the heals of the paladin and the utility/offensive spells of a Ranger?  Riiiiiight.  And I guess you want to wear platemail as well, and wield the Paladin and SK epics at the same time while shooting fireballs out of your butt.     <IMG SRC="rolleyes.gif" border="0"><P>Quote:<BR>"6. Hp/Ac--Everyone needs more ac/hp it's a fact of life. I can tank, mob slowed, with all buffs possible. Then I try to solo the mob without the buffs/slow and it just eats me."<P>Here we go again.  "I want to have the offensive abilities of a Ranger and still be able to tank as well as an SK/Paladin!"  Getting hit too hard?  Improve your gear.  Rangers can tank just peachy-like in xp groups in the mid-50's.<P>Quote:<BR>"We can solo animals, very nice I like this. BUT it just doesn't cut it in dungeons and 50+ where it's very hard to find a safe camp with grindable animals."<P>Name some classes that *do* solo in dungeons for the primary purpose of gaining xp.  Necromancers are practically the only class that can do it efficiently, and they're better suited to the outdoors.  It doesn't matter *what* class you are, there aren't any 'safe camps' for a solo individual at post-50, and even before then.  Things can always go wrong, and you can always have adds.  You want risk-free xp?  Not going to happen.<P>Quote:<BR>"1. That new snare...It sticks for 2 mins I understand you cast while the mobs running, but I just feel lazy sometimes =) Ensnare is what? 2 seconds? I'll only do about 5 damage in that 1.5 seconds anyway not that important."<P>New snare lasts for a random duration, sometimes zero seconds, sometimes around 30.  It's a multi-purpose spell.  Try it out for a while and figure them out... or read one of the other six threads on this board where it's uses are discussed.<P>Quote:<BR>"2. Track? I'd rather have ports instead of a color coaded track with a nifty scrollbar (not complaining, but could be better)."<P>Something makes me doubt you've gotten past level 10.  Not saying you haven't, but that's about the most broken statement I've ever heard.  Want to port?  There's practically ALWAYS a druid or a wizard around who'll do it for a donation in your zone or one zone over... and if not, just do a /who check.  Track is one of the reasons groups in many outdoors zones *adore* Rangers.  Track probably takes 40-50% off of my solo time... I can find the exact mob at the exact con I want to kill with the click of a button.<P>Quote:<BR>"3. Damage--We can do more than a warrior in a sprint of damage but after we cast and cast in the next fight the warrior does the same steady damage. We're an "offense hybrid" right? Aren't we on same damage table has Warriors, Sk's, and Paladins? Not to sure about that though."<P>Not sure what you're doing wrong, but there are a few reasons Rangers outdamage Warriors other than spells.  First, we frequently are NOT the tanks, which lets us stand behind the mob with the Rogue if we're good enough at aggro management to avoid getting any.  If you need to have the benefits of being behind a mob explained to you... well, go read another thread on it.<P>Secondly, Rangers get to focus more on DPS and less on taunt factor when selecting weapons.  If a Ranger actually wants taunt at some point in their life, they aren't exactly going to have a problem doing so unless they're totally OOM.  Third, we of course get the spells you mentioned... and nuking is only ONE way our spells increase our damage output.<P>Quote:<BR>"Rangers get a FEW VERY awesome weapons, and when we get those, our speed epic, poa cloak yes we're good. I guess VI is expecting everyone to kill Vulak and be in high-end guild? These high-end items aren't possible for me to get yet, except for epic."<P>Yeah, that really does suck... except for the part about that being true for every OTHER class in the game as well.  Rangers should get "VERY awesome weapons" earlier than anyone else?  Why?  It's certainly not as if we have to wait any longer than other melee classes to get equivalent weapons.<P>And if the Swiftwind and PoA cloak are the only two really cool Ranger items you can think of, you really need to go research Ranger items.  If you don't try to get gear appropriate for your level, of course you're going to suck.  What did you expect?  Besides, you certainly do NOT need Swiftwind and the PoA cloak to kick butt.<P>You want the best in the game, you have to work for it... just like everyone else.  If you don't want to put forth the effort, you don't get the cookie.  Your whole post seemed to be more of an unending whine than anything.  Maybe you were just in a bad mood or something when you wrote that.<P>And the "Rangers look cool" was a freaking joke.     <IMG SRC="tongue.gif" border="0">  It's called class-pride.  Try to have some of it.<P>--------------------<P>Quotes to live by:<P>"When you said 'cast the demon out', I figured you meant throw Seranos through the second story window.

1.  Yes, the reason they want them is to stay is because they can CONTRIBUTE to the group more than rangers can.  <BR>2. Sow-I know we got it at 39 when did I say we didn't?  30 is when you DON'T need it because clerics can just rez you, (which makes me doubt you've gotten past level 29).

Hp/Ac- Did I say I wanted SK's tanking skills? I don't remember saying that.  I want an increase nevertheless, but not +200hps per level, as you think I want.  Plate? No. Sk/Pallys get plate, we don't, so we should be better in some other field right?<BR>6. I never said I wanted to solo in dungeons,  Fear doesn't work well in dungeons of course if you didn't know...and when we can't fear, we can't solo .<BR>7. Please tell me uses for 0-30 second snare.  <BR>8. Track...most level 50+'s won't stop killing to port you.

Damage--The Sk/Pal/War getting stunned is not a reason we could outdamage, if we're both behind rangers should be able to outdamage.<BR>10.

I'm honestly starting to think you're just trolling, but... alright, round 4...<P>1. Um, well no *duh* a Druid or a Bard contributes more to group downtime than a Ranger.  However, you're going to need to actually *kill* mobs sometime... something a Druid doesn't do so well (and certainly not with sustained pulls), and a Bard... well, let's not even go there... if you'd rather have a Bard for a damage dealer over a Ranger...<P>Riiiiiight.<P>2. LMAO... yeah, right, I'm going to pay for a rez at level 30?  Not that a Ranger should be dying solo or in a group anyway, even before SoW.  Even when I do group, there's *rarely* a cleric in the group, so that means I have to hunt one down.  Not worth my time when I can just hoof it back to my corpse in the same amount of time.  50pp for a port?  What kind of extortionists are your servers' druids and wizards?     <IMG SRC="eek.gif" border="0">  Druids and Wizards will often port for free on Lanys, Druzzil, and Tunare if you ask them nicely enough... and 20pp is more than enough to buy you a port anywhere.  Often, 20pp will get you a "Hey, thanks!!" and several buffs from a Druid.  And Spirit of Wolf is more useful as a travel spell than a CR spell for me *anyway*... ports only get you near your destination at best... you still have to run.<P>3. A damage free root would be nice, and not just for mezzes (damage+effect = higher resist rate), but Gate or Clarity would be nice too.  Your point?<P>4. Why in the heck do you need better heals?  Rangers don't *NEED* more healing power.  We don't take squat for damage solo'ing animals, and there's always a healer in a group... so what's the sense of getting better heals when our parent class only heals roughly as well as a Paladin to begin with?  Mebbe you should look at the Druid spell list.<P>5. Plate-wearers are complaining as-is that Rangers are keeping up with their AC until the VERY end game due to the proliferation of high AC Ranger-usable armor (starting at the low end with Tree Weave).  You want more AC?  Pfft.  We don't get hit anyway, and when we *do* end up being the tanks in xp groups like Velks (rare but it happens), we do so just fine.  Raids?  Warriors are the only frequently selected choice for "the guy who'll get hit" on raids.  So what exactly is your reason for wanting more AC?<P>6. First, I NEVER said Fear was a good idea in dungeons, I was saying WHY should Rangers be able to do so?  As for outdoors, if snare-fear-whack'em is your only viable method of solo'ing... your gear must suck.  No offense, but that's the only explanation I can think of, other than that you haven't even tried it.  Animal fearing is by far the fastest, but not the only method of solo'ing.  Here are a few thoughts.  Bowkite the little bastards down a bit if necessary.  DoT.  Engage in melee.  Root, back off, and use your bow or nukes if you're having a bad run of things.  Meditate up to full, and hell, by your level you could have an Ikky Regen BP anyway... heal a bit to make up for the fact that you med faster than you regen, rinse and repeat.<P>7. /sigh.  Alright, here goes.<P>#1: The group snarer is a retard and forgot to snare or had some *really* bad luck with resists, and the mob is off running.  Tangling goes off almost instantly and *RARELY* lasts for only a few seconds... almost always lasts for around 20... but not always.  If you really want to sit around letting that mob run (often at near-full speed) while you're casting a full Snare, more power to you.<P>#2. You suddenly get aggro'ed by two mobs that run at SoW speed (whether naturally or by being SoWed by a shaman mob)... which can happen fairly frequently in Luclin-Velious-Kunark.  Getting pummelled by two mobs at once can make it a *little* hard to get that Snare off.  Tangling is almost instant-cast, and repops fairly quickly... certainly by the time you run away a bit to only get one mob beating on you.<P>Need more reasons?  I'd like to move on now... but I think I've justified the existence of a level *9* spell.  Want to argue pointless spells?  Let's look at some truly pathethic ones... Ward Summoned, Invoke Lightning...<P>8. Great point... other than for the fact that you don't *need* a 50+ to port you.  And if you don't do a /who all druid (or wizard) (level range you need), that's your problem.  I look for porters on the /who list who are in zones that one commonly ports to... ie: GD, WC, BB... and nicely ask if they're porting at the moment, and if they aren't that I was sorry for bothering them.  Never had a rude reply once, and most (probably 90% of the time), they were happy to port me for a donation.<P>That's ignoring the fact that by that level, you should have already made friends with dozens of people... many of which would be Druids and Wizards.  I have a half dozen on my friends' list... and it's rare that one of them isn't actively porting.<P>And that's ignoring the fact that you're probably in a guild at level 53... or are at least on friendly terms with some guilds.  Never had a problem finding a guildmate who was free if I couldn't find a port due to it being at the lowest population time of the night.<P>Teleports aren't exactly hard to come by.  I wouldn't give up Ranger tracking for it, that's for sure... but maybe that's just because I've played a Druid and I know that I didn't really use them that often for my own benefit... more often it was porting a guildmate or a friend somewhere around Norrath.<P>9. Damage: If you can't outdamage an SK or Paladin given equal position to the mob, that has to be due to the fact that your weapons are inferior.  It's not even a competition before spells are brought into play.  If you consider spells, the damage differential is a joke... SKs don't do jack for damage with magic, and neither do Paladins, except in very special circumstances (read: undead).  Personal experience.<P>10. ... VI tries to improve us through drops, not stats?  That's Everquest... nothing Ranger-specific about that statement.<P>--------------------<P>Quotes to live by:<P>"When you said 'cast the demon out', I figured you meant throw Seranos through the second story window.

And like Tylus said, I sort of doubt you even *have* a Ranger, much less one in his 50's.  I'd go check Rodcet for myself, but if you *are*... all that would prove is that you likely either bought the account off eBay or got PLed to that point.<P>One of the two.  No earned Ranger in his or her 50's would seriously let this kind of troll crap out of his/her mouth after the way Rangers have been boosted over the years.<P>--------------------<P>Quotes to live by:<P>"When you said 'cast the demon out', I figured you meant throw Seranos through the second story window.

1. Rangers do more damage than bard ,  but bards have stuff that more than makes up for that.<BR>2. Yes, it's that hard for more to get a port...sometimes ppl will port for free, very rarely though.  If there is rarely a cleric in your group,  I seriously doubt you've made it past 50.  On my server, atleast, they're almost a necessity.  <BR>3. Wtf  Clarity isn't even a druid spell?  Gate...No one else gets besides pure casters... Maybe I should've clarified different spells as druid spells.<BR>4. Heals moved a few levels back 57 for Gheal is kind of ridiculas.<BR>5. When a mob aggroes me, I get the hell beaten out of me. (Around 900 Ac)  Most of my thought for an increase would be in hitpoints.<BR>6. I've tried Snare Root Dot Arrows DD,  my downtime was always terrible.<BR>7. <BR>  1..1 doesn't happen very often,  I'm not taking up 2 spell slots with 2 snares either.<BR>  2. Good point, rarely find many sow speed mobs.   <BR>Truely pathetic spells? Glimpse?<BR>8. I'm usually not in the karanas or some level 20-30 zone...Most of the time i'll hunt mobs my level which other people in the game do too.  <BR>Don't ask for can't get ports from guild for several reasons.<BR>9. Weapons must be inferior then.<BR>10.  Some classes are pretty much kickass, as long as they have gear relative to their level.

Look, most of your concepts are based on incorrect assumptions about the Druid class to begin with.  Go look at the Druid spell list... you might be a little shocked.  They don't get a non-damage Root EITHER.  So why should Rangers, again?  As for the rest of your post...<P>Glimpse is useful for getting your Divination skill up... cheap with a low recycle time.  When I said pathetic spells, I meant truly useless, and Glimpse actually does have a purpose, albeit a small one.  It's not like Rangers are the only one saddled with this admittedly weak spell, so I'm not sure why you're whining about it.<P>As for you getting your butt kicked when a mob aggros you, I'd first suggest you actually TRY to get some decent armor and focus on AC instead of +Dex or whatever it is you decided was more important... and secondly, I'd point out the simple fact that Rangers are offensive hybrids.  We ALREADY tank fairly well... better than Bards, Monks, and Rogues.  Worse than Warriors, Paladins, and SKs, but that makes perfect sense to me.  And naturally, we don't do quite as much damage as Monks (though with spells it leans in our favor), certainly not as much as Rogues... but we do more damage than Paladin or SK, and even damage with a Warrior even counting their crits.<P>Druids don't get Gate?  Well crap, I must have found an exploit, because my Druid's been doing it since level 5.   <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" border="0">  As for Clarity, that was an exaggeration used to prove my point... cripes.  You're asking for things that Rangers DON'T need, nor should they get them.<P>Furthermore, I'm STILL not sure why you're so demanding that Rangers get better heals.  Um, Druids aren't exactly good healers to begin with... WHY then, should Rangers have their healing skills bumped up?  Because it would be cool isn't a good enough answer.  A Ranger's healing ability follows course with the Druid's in the same way as the Paladin's does with the Cleric's.  You want Rangers to get better heals?  Better demand improved heals for Paladins as well unless you don't mind being a hypocrite.<P>As for rezzes, I don't even remember how we got off on this tangent, but the only time I *need* a cleric handy is on a raid.  Xp group in Velks or Chardok?  I'll happily take a Shaman.  /shrug.  Clerics are nice, but not the necessity for non-raid gaming that some people try to claim... and I don't raid more than a couple times a week.  Deaths outside of raids should be once-every-couple-months events anyway... so it's not a pressing issue, and raids always have clerics, so I don't see what your point is.<P>I never said Snare-Root-DoT-Arrows-DD.  Read my statement about alternate strategies again... or I can break it down for you a little more delicately.  First you see a big nasty monster.  You Harmony if need be to pull it alone.  You also make sure Mr Monster can't Summon your treehugging butt.  You then Snare to pull it... fire off a few arrows.  You do NOT DoT yet, as DoTs don't do nearly full damage unless the mob is stationary or feared.  DD once if you want and mana permits.  Have your proc spell up, DoT the monster, and let it come to melee range.  Proceed to melee the crap out of it until it starts to run.  Resnare as necessary.  Root and back off to finish it off if it's doing too much damage.  Kill monster.  XP and money, yay.  Go heal (via buffs, healing spells, regen BP, etc).  Repeat until you want to do something else.<P>And that's if you're just feeling saucy and want to do something that actually involves a slight amount of risk... as opposed to whacking animals in the butt.<P>As for that utterly senseless remark about the 50+ druids and wizards being necessary, take the time to actually LOOK at when they get their spells.   <IMG SRC="rolleyes.gif" border="0">  You've never even seen a spell list for these classes, have you?  Name some teleportation (Abscond, Decession, etc don't count) spells for 50+.<P>Just out of curiosity, what weapons ARE you using that seem to continually do less damage than any Paladin or SK?  Twin Yak Attack?  Crystal Fiber and a GBSword?<P>No one's forcing you to use Tangling Weeds.  Like I said, it's just a level 9 spell... kinda cute how you're focusing so heavily on that one spell (which you proved you had no knowledge of to begin with) and ignoring all the other cool spells Rangers got with Luclin.<P>No one's forcing you to play a Ranger, for that matter.<P>And a statement like "Some classes are pretty much kickass" is a blanket opinion to begin with that can't be supported, nor can it be disproved... it's your opinion.  I could say "Wizards are more 'kickass' than any other class in the game" if I wanted, but it wouldn't mean jack squat.<P>But honestly, do us all a favor and quit playing EQ for a while... go do something else.  It's obvious that either...<P>#1. You're full of crap to begin with and you don't actually have a level 53 anything.<P>#2. You bought your account on EBay or were PLed to your current point by a friend.<P>#3. You actually *did* earn your character, and you're so burned out on the game that you can only see what you want to see... ie: reasons to support your quitting the game.<P>Just leave and take your bad vibes with you, and come back if you get a better attitude about the game.  It *is* just a game, after all.<P>--------------------<P>Quotes to live by:<P>"When you said 'cast the demon out', I figured you meant throw Seranos through the second story window.

You do very well at twisting ****.

Rest a few. then boom i'm up and killing again.   Nice.<BR>Problem is,  not everyone has regen bp.  Like I said before IF you have the weapons IF you have the armor.  You kick ass.

Then I noticed VI did the awesome deed of giving it a 2 pt ds so it doesn't stack with CoE etc.  Why can't they just give us a regen that has small values that make it a LOT less useful.<BR>The .5 Snare,  WHY can't they just make it stick longer and give it to us at a later level?  I don't need 2 snares at level 9. <BR>I loved your use for glimpse btw.  <BR>**** I use Ward summoned while fighting necros.  and Invoke lightning when i'm grinding skeles.  <BR>I never said I wanted Cheal.

Just showing the comparison about how VI makes spells have less value with little "helpful" additions.<P>"Melee Balancing" Patch said.  Rangers will now be tanking equals with bards...putting them right where we want them.  I might not have it word for word.  But something like that.<P>You're right, no ones forcing me to, but I'd have to see DAYS of grinding, being lfg, running, buying, selling, medding, dying.  All go to waste because at 40+ the class starts getting worse and worse.<P>I'm curious what your AC and what weapons you're using, and maybe even you're level. <BR> <BR>As for my "Some classes are pretty much kickass" WAS an opinion, but about 90% of the players will agree that some classes are overpowered, and I sure as hell hope nobody says a ranger.

Catch a clue, no class in the game "kicks ass" without good gear.<P>Casters and Priests?  Pffft.  Get that +Int and +Wis gear or you're going to be telling the group OOM after every other pull.<P>Monks?  Heh, unarmed ratio for monks still sucks until the high-end game compared to the weapons, and even toward the end most still choose weapons.<P>Warriors?  No.  Rogues?  No.  Paladins?  No.  Shadowknight?  No.  Ranger?  No.<P>Even Bards lose a ton of efficiency without expensive instruments, so 'no' there as well.<P>As for the Regen BP, if you can't raise 6k or less at level 53, you seriously need to re-evaluate what you spend your time doing, other than *#$&@'ing about how much your class sucks to other Rangers.<P>The BP isn't even necessary, the Regen for downtime and while pulling is just a nice bonus.  The BP itself sucks for AC and has no stats by the time you can get it untwinked.  I solo'ed easily long before I got my hands on one of those.<P>Like I said.  Minimal downtime.  Regen BP is just the icing on the cake, I know several Rangers solo'ing in EW in their mid-50's who just never bothered to invest in one.  I like to hunt elsewhere now and then for a break from the 'usual' Ranger zones.  Raptors work great, although the risk of adds is worse.<P>Of course, there are those rare instances where spells just refuse to stick and mobs break every fear right after you cast it.  /shrug.  It happens, but it's vastly an exception to the rule.<P>Quote:<BR>"Rangers can't solo, and rangers can't group."<BR>"We can solo animals...VERY WELL"<P>So which is it?  Oh waaaah.  We're insanely wrong against one type of mob that can be found all over Norrath at every possible level range you could desire, some with decent loot and all outside where there's relatively little danger.<P>Yeah, we suck alright.  /sarcasm off.<P>You think Necros or Druids or Wizards don't have downtime?  They tend to have MORE than your average Ranger provided the Snare/Fears don't get resisted too much, which shouldn't happen if you're solo'ing blues.  Extremely minimal mana cost per fight.  Low risk of taking more than a single bub of health in damage, and usually a lot less than that when you get into the rhythm of things.  Shadowknights?  Their Darknesses and Invoke Fears at 50+ require a LOT of mana... I know this firsthand, and Darkness is easy to resist as a dual-component spell.<P>As for my equipment... the only piece of gear I have that's extraordinary is Tolan's Darkwood Breastplate, our Trak BP.  /shrug.  The rest is a mix of more Tolan's and miscellanious items, almost all of which can be camped in small groups.<P>Weapons?  Lupine Dagger in primary, Frostbringer or Centi Longsword in secondary depending on how much taunt I want, nothing "uber".  Sash of the Dragonborn helps, but that's only a few percent higher than the FBSS or SCHs, which are easily available.  Oh, and Swarmcaller for a 2HS just because Tagar's is nice.<P>As for getting groups, well, first... that's one thing a guild is for at the higher levels when pickup groups start to dwindle.  Even outside of a guild, I don't seem to have trouble finding groups.  /shrug.<P>--------------------<P>Quotes to live by:<P>"When you said 'cast the demon out', I figured you meant throw Seranos through the second story window.  My bad."<BR>- Milia Romanova, Paladin of Tyr<P>"And if any warrior ever laughs at me, I'll duel him. It's a long walk back to his corpse when he can't sow himself."<BR>- Mosey Stormbow, Ranger-type-person

First of all,  I WANT to be a ranger, but I WANT rangers improved. I'm not quitting the class just because VI ignores every complaint made about rangers need improvements.<BR>If you can't see that rangers need many improvements you're in pure denial.  If you're as good as you say you are,  and I suck as bad as I do...just because of equipment.  That is the most unbalanced and ****ed up thing i've ever heard.<P>If ANY Group that doesn't already have a cler, enc, or war.  Ask a ranger to join,  it's because they're desperate or stupid.<BR>Why would they want a ranger?  Snare? thats all I can think of.  <P>Every class has a little downtime,  druids get a pet, fear, dot, dd, heal, regen, buff.  Essentially everything a ranger gets except 10x as effective.  Then you say we're balanced because we can melee like a warrior?  <P>As for a necro having more downtime, *sigh* maybe you should just stop posting? <P>Pick up groups start to dwindle wtf?  Isn't every group a pickup group?  Theres no way for me to really prove no one really wants a ranger in a group...you'll just have to figure that out yourself.

So many stupid people, so little time....<P>If you are having problems gettin into groups, it might not be the ranger aspect that's the problem. It might just be you.<P>New snare is very nice. Short cast time, which means you can wait till the last second to cast it, or you can catch that running mob before he is out of range for Snare.<P>Sow at level 30. Better than 39. Any sooner would be stupid, as druids don't get it till around 14. You really think a ranger should get it when?<P>Ports. Dead horse. Won't happen. Get Thurg potions. Get a Tolan's BP if you can. Use the Nexus.<P>Snare. Druids get Ensnare at 29. Thus their snare is better than ours for most our life. We have Snare until 51. While Ensnare might not stick for long, on some mobs, Snare is resisted and Ensnare is not, due to level difference in spells.<P>Baby heals. While we don't heal as well as some, you would be supprised what you can do with what you have. And if you have a mana regen item or clarity, those baby heals can actually keep your group going.<P>Big booms. While you might do the same damage in 2 minutes as a wizard can do in 1 spell, sometimes a wizard is useless, due to magic resists on mobs. Your melee is not resisted. Backstabs, well we all know that rogues are the damage kings, as long as they can stay on the back side, but if they are doin backstabs, they can't hold a candle to rangers.<P>Track. Scroll bar with color coded mobs. You must be kidding. This is one of the nicest things VI has done for the ranger class, bar none. It is VERY useful, given the tracksort and trackfilter options.<P>At one time rangers were in need of help, but now, I think they can hold their own with anyone in game. The spells, WS and TS, damage meleer's, track. We are very powerful players imo. Can we tank as well as a warrior? No. But we do get WS, which can be helpful in situations, and yes, we can tank some in normal situations with warriors, just not as well. Can we damage melee as much as a monk or rogue? No. But we are close enough to make us worthy of a group. Can we heal as well as a Paly? No, but anything less than a cleric is really comparable to a degree. Can we pull? Outdoors we are super, indoors we can still do well. Monks and FD'ers are better indoors. <P>Bottom line. If you aren't happy, then change. Don't expect the world to change around you, you have to adapt. You sound like to me, a druid type player. Maybe this is something to consider?<P>If you are stuck on melee, then try others out. You never know what you might find. Monks are alot of fun, albeit no spells. Warriors are a little boring imo, but can be fun at times. SKs are fun, palies are a little boring to me, but can be powerful at times. Bards are alot of fun, if you can play them right. Rogues are a little fun at times, but I hate looking at Butts all the time.<P>My advice. Re think your play style. It's never too late to change classes. I know of many who have a full roster of 50+ characters, and a few with 2 60s.

My first thought was ...troll. <P>Then I realized, I've met this guy before. <P>He's the guy who says Crk plz.<BR> <BR>The word skillz has the same amount of letters as the word skills, yet he spells it wrong. He wants to have spells, better melee than a warrior and the hit points of a better tank. He comes in, lampoons a class, and professes to know it well enough to tell everyone they are wrong and he is right. <P>I knew I'd grouped with this guy before. <P>He's the guy who grabs that earring of station and logs. <P>He's the guy who tell you to STFU and heal cause he kills fast, cause he's L337 and gots mad skillz. <P>He's the guy who inspects you without asking and starts telling you what equipment to buy, and then loots all the mobs before you can click on 'em - everytime. <P>Someone once posted that stupid people can make it to level 50, but they can't make it to level 60 because they have to group.<P>It's amazing you've made it this far, without knowing the specifics  of your spell line. Gratz on 52. <P>Only 5000 more pickup groups to go before  level 60, eh ? <BR> <P>All the classes get repetitious spells , they're called upgrades.

Well ya gotta look at what are taking up the other 5 spot in that group, they may need the tank, a healer or crowd control... Chances are they allready have a damage dealer (Rogue, monk or ranger) Ya have to have a balanced group you should know that by 53     <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"> <P>I guess you could play crowd control and ghetto mezz stuff, or play combat healer and watch people fall left and right, or play tank and well you could do a decent job, the down time cause of all the healing you would be longer, although I don't say you shouldn't the self only DS and other DS that stack are pretty good... <P>What I'm saying here is the primary and secondary weapon are tied together they are not independent... j/k actualy It's called balancing You don't see bard complaining cause they can't use bows, or warriors that they can only bind up till 50% until they use AA, or monks that thier equip has next to no AC, or wizzies that they have to wave when ever they TL someone wether they like it or not, or Clerics that they have to heal rangers     <IMG SRC="tongue.gif" border="0"> and the list goes on..     <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" border="0"><P>*edit*<BR>Ohh yeah, about the spells this new snare confuses the hell outta me too, it's a GCP I tells ya
