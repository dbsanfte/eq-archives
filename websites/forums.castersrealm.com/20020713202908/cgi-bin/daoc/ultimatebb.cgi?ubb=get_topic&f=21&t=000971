[Disclaimer: This started out as a reply to another thread, but quickly took on a life of its own.  I submit it for your perusal, I will warn you ahead of time, it is very long...]<P>The following is my own personal opinion.  I seek not to speak for anyone else, nor do I make any claims to know everything there is to know about this class.  It is up to the individual to take from it what he or she will..and as always, feel free to agree or disagree...<P>To date, I have played 4 different Sorcerers on the live servers, (and a couple of variants in beta, but sorcerers were so different then that I hardly even mention that anymore).  And after each of the first three I learned a little bit more about how I like to play my Sorcerer, and how best to use the tools I have at my disposal along the way.  What I have arrived at is a template, or spec progression, that suits my own personal taste to a tee.  It allows me to do all the things I enjoy doing, and has proven to be enough fun that I can say with assuredness that this is the template I will take out to 50.  <P>In a nutshell, I will be spending my spec points relatively evenly between Matter and Mind with the goal of hitting the "charm milestones" along the way.  What that means is making sure I get the charm that will allow me yellow pets just as the previous spell phases out.  Any excess points will be placed into body.  At level 50 I will have the following spec levels: Matter:35, Body:22, Mind:34.  I can hear the collective gasp of disbelief from all those body spec'ed sorcerers out there so I will share some of the reasons why I have arrived at this rather uncommon template, and why it fits the way I like to play so well.<P>I will start with the given, having a 2/3+ spec level in Mind allows me the ability to not only bring to a group the traditional abilities one would associate with a Sorcerer, but also do them well.  At level 50 I will have the second highest ranged AE Mez and by hitting the "charm milestones" I will ensure that I have even con pets at my disposal all along the way, including level 50 pets.<P>With only a slight focus in body, I primarily rely on the base line drain for fast damage.  The spec progression I plan calls for an increased emphasis on body in later levels, right at the time I hit the main RvR and right when a tightening of the damage variance of the base-line drains will be most needed.  At level 50, I will have a 22 in body, but with items I can pull that up to the low to mid 30's which will ensure that the damage variance of the drain, though still greater than the norm, would still be very livable for me.<P>Which brings me to matter and the big question, why on earth do you make matter a primary spec?  To answer that, I will offer some examples of how I have used the dots to full effect.  In clerk groups what I would typically do, if I was the primary crowd controller, is allow the puller to do his thing and cast an AE mez on the incoming group.  Assuming they stragglers were immobilized, I would then assist on the tank and cast either my base-line or spec-line DoT.  The determining factor between the two would be how tank heavy our group was, and the level of damage output I expected from who we had available.  The trick is to do damage and not draw aggro.  So in cases where I expected high damage output from our tanks, I would cast the base-line DoT because its damage occurs over 4 pulses for a higher amount each pulse.  The pulses were doing between high 50's and low 60's each time.  My focus in matter ensured that the damage variance was very minimal...which in turn meant that, assuming the mob lived 4 pulses, I was contributing a guaranteed 200+ points of damage to the mob.  In cases where I didn't think the tanks could dish out damage fast enough to hold the aggro against my base-line DoT, I would use the spec DoT because it pulses 6 times at a lower amount each time.  It works out to be about the same amount of damage in the end which in this case is a good thing (though this is also one of the primary things I feel should be fixed with the matter spec track..but thats another post...).  The real beauty of it is the fact that while the DoT was ticking, I was absolutely free to keep my eyes on the remaining mezzed mobs and re-mez if necessary.  In short, the fire and forget property of DoTs allows me spend more time focussing on keeping mobs immobilized, while at the same time contributing to the damage output of the group.  I used this technique to great effect in Darkness Falls as well. When I was soloing, I would use the very same tactic with the exception that my pet was the tank.  I would pull with debuffs, and send my pet in to build aggro.  Once engaged, I make the assessment of whether I should cast the base-line or spec line Dot.  Typically against yellow and lower, I would use the Base-line DoT...against Oranges, I would use the spec DoT.  I would then time my drains so as not to draw the aggro.  And yes, I consistently would solo oranges without a second thought...and provided I had a source of pets nearby (because against an orange the pet does take quite a beating) I could do them in fairly rapid succession.  <P>In RvR things require a different set of tactics, however.  In cases where I was in a group and we had the spell initiative (i.e. either the opposing group ran into our spell casting distance, or we surpised them and ran into theirs) and I scored a quickcast AE Mez, I followed pretty much the same tactics as above....DoT'ing and focussing on keeping the others immobilized.  (Incidentally, these were the rare times when I would get noticeable RP, but were also the least fun...).  In cases where it was more of a skirmish in addition to trying to help out the tanks with damage output, I would be focussed on finding opposing spell casters and archers and keeping them interrupted or occupied, often these times I would die very quickly because getting them into my spell casting distance meant I had just walked into theirs and I would see my "bolt of death" heading right for me.  (Incidently I would get very little if any RP from these type of chaotic skirmishes...but the successes I had and the RP gained I savored much more...not to mention I had by far, the most fun in these type of encounters).  <BR> <BR>The point to all of this, is that I spec primarily in matter...by choice.  Not out of a sense of self-punishment, and not for lack of knowledge of the pros and cons of what I gain or give up.  I enjoy it, and wouldn't change it for the world.  Make of that what you will....<P>--------------------<P>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<BR>Myrcil the Briton Matter Sorcerer<BR>Member of the Furious Pantaloons<BR>Galahad Server<BR>Member of the Sorcerer Testing Team in Beta<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<P>"Who could ever calculate the path of a molecule?<BR>How do we know that the creations of worlds are not determined by falling grains of sand?"<BR>  --Victor Hugo, Les Miserables

I agree on both counts Meekrobe, Matter is absolutely lacking in terms of what it offers..something I sincerely hope Mythic does something about...and Matter spec is definitely more viable for a Cabbie than it is for a Sorcerer.<P>And Cozsorc, I respect your opinion.  And you are correct in that having a spec DoT that works out to do the same damage as the base dot is silly.  In my post I wrote:<P>"It works out to be about the same amount of damage in the end which in this case is a good thing (though this is also one of the primary things I feel should be fixed with the matter spec track..but thats another post...)."<P>Though I wouldn't characterize it as 120% broken, I do agree it needs work.  And as far as the damage output, the damage variance on the base line drains isn't that bad given the very low focus I place on training it.  If I am out to deal damage, chain casting my base line drains with their chance for criticals on top of a DoT pulsing at the upper limits of its damage range is not too shabby and has worked for me.  I will admit it is not for everyone...<P>--------------------<P>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<BR>Myrcil the Briton Matter Sorcerer<BR>Member of the Furious Pantaloons<BR>Galahad Server<BR>Member of the Sorcerer Testing Team in Beta<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<P>"Who could ever calculate the path of a molecule?<BR>How do we know that the creations of worlds are not determined by falling grains of sand?"<BR>  --Victor Hugo, Les Miserables

I think another concern I have in NOT keeping mind upto 'at least' 44 is:<P>I'm was 45 until last night-- (I have not tried mezzing at 46 yet), but was doign trees.  I have had about 36 mind spec at lvl 45, and the tress resist mez ~40% of the time on the first cast.<P>Now, I do NOT know if resists is strictly level based or if spec effects the resistance... BUT, Most of the mobs at the Trees are red++ and grape+++ to me when I was 45 (I suspect they will still be at 46).<P>So, if I having that bad of a resist rate with mind spec at 36, level 45... I would imaging that only have 34 mind at lvl 45 or 46 (Provided that SPEC effects resists) will be make it devistating for you to level once you start trees..<P>Now-- I might be completely wrong, and the player level is the only thing that effects resists, in which case, I still wouldn't go matter, but body if you stop mind at 34.<P>Personally, I'm taking mind to 44... personal choice.<P> -- Coz<P>--------------------<P>LvL 45 Sorcorer, Albion/Tristan<BR>LvL 41 Cleric, Albion/Tristan

Before this gets characterized as an endorsement for everyone to re-roll as matter spec sorcerers, I figured I would dig through and repost my suggestion for fixing the school of matter.<P>You can find the full thread at the following:<BR> <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/daoc/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=21&t=000624" TARGET=_blank>http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/daoc/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=21&t=000624</A> <P>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<BR>There are some serious problems with the matter base and spec lines.  What I am going to try and do is deal with these problems in a rational manner so that hopefully someone will see the wisdom and do something to fix it…<P>The most glaring flaw in the design of the matter line is the scaling of the damages for the base-line versus spec-line DoT's.  The Damage over time spells are the meat of the Matter school and comprise the primary attack option for someone spending spec points in matter.  A major factor that stands in stark opposition to a DoT's usefulness is the fact that often fights do not last long enough for a DoT to do it's full damage.  This is a serious problem, but one that requires a reworking of the core dynamics of the game, and that, in turn, is not something I would feel comfortable having the developers muck with at this point.  I would suggest that our first concern should be to get our spells to work well and make sense first…(jeeez, this is such déjà vu from beta, this game is live, right?)<P>So, that having been said, lets examine the mess that is the school of matter twisting.  As I mentioned, DoTs are it's bread and butter.  But the setup, as it stands now, makes very little sense.  For starters, one of the differences between the base and spec DoTs is the fact that a base-line DoT will pulse 4 times while the spec DoT will pulse 6 times. This is an aspect I really do not have a problem with.  In fact, I think it is a nice way to setup the difference between the two and lays the foundation to really adding an incentive for the spec dot.  It’s the analysis of how the developers implemented the spells given this foundation that really begs the question, what were they thinking? <P>Keep in mind this is just base damage.  A lot is factored into how much the the spell will actually pulse for.  It may perform better or worse for you depending on how many (if any) spec points you have placed into matter.  <P>Base-line DoT vs Spec-line DoT<BR>Lvl: 1    BaseDmg: 2  <BR>Lvl: 2    BaseDmg: 4 <BR>Lvl: 3    BaseDmg: 6    SpecLvl: 3    SpecDmg: 6  <BR>Lvl: 5    BaseDmg: 9    SpecLvl: 5    SpecDmg: 9<BR>Lvl: 7    BaseDmg: 13    SpecLvl: 7    SpecDmg: 13<BR>Lvl: 10    BaseDmg: 17    SpecLvl: 10    SpecDmg: 17    <BR>Lvl: 13    BaseDmg: 23    SpecLvl: 13    SpecDmg: 23    <BR>Lvl: 16    BaseDmg: 29    SpecLvl: 16    SpecDmg: 29<BR>Lvl: 21    BaseDmg: 37    SpecLvl: 21    SpecDmg: 37<BR>Lvl: 27    BaseDmg: 49    SpecLvl: 27    SpecDmg: 49<BR>Lvl: 35    BaseDmg: 63    SpecLvl: 35    SpecDmg: 63<BR>Lvl: 44    BaseDmg: 79    SpecLvl: 44    SpecDmg: 79<BR>Lvl: 50                              SpecLvl: 50    SpecDmg: 89<P>So, okay, I formatted the above list to illustrate a point.  According to all the testing I did in Beta (and believe me, I did tons) the same set of circumstances effect both the base and spec DoTs.  What that means is that all other things remaining equal, at level 10, assuming you full spec in matter, your base line DoT will pulse for the same average damage over a period of time as your spec line DoT at a level 10 spec.  The difference being your spec line DoT will pulse twice more than your base DoT.  But what are the ramifications of this setup?  Well what it amounts to is that the only way to ensure that your spec DoT will be more effective (i.e. Do more damage) than your base DoT will be to full spec all the way through.<P>In a word, that setup is ridiculous.  The same person who full specs in matter, and has the distinguished honor of having a spec dot that is better than his base dot will also have just sealed the door on having an equal level pet or any significant AoE mez…two important tools in Sorcerers RvR arsenal.  That same person would have also sealed the door on any meaningful DD as well as ensure that the damage for his drains will be flakey to say the least.  It does not surprise me in the least that almost no one specs in matter currently. Why would anyone who has all the facts want to, honestly?<P>Well, okay, enough gloom and doom.  I am going to offer 2 scenarios that may work to improve the viability of our DoTs and in turn make the Matter school more appealing.<P>Scenario 1: Re-scale the spec line DoTs<BR>Basically, one way that could fix things is to scale the Spec DoT base damage in such a way as to make it so that someone 2/3rds spec'ing (supposedly the target level) will have a spec dot with equal base damage as the base-line DoT.  Simply put….someone at level 24 with 2/3rds spec in Matter (a spec level of 16)  would have access to the 21st level base-line dot with a base damage of 37….the level 16 spec-line DoT should have a base damage of 37 also.  The same would hold true all the way through.  But there is a draw-back to this scenario.  What it would mean is that someone full-speccing in matter would then have a spec line DoT that has the potential to do almost un-balancing damage.  But is that really a bad thing?  They are giving up the possibility to have an even level pet.  They are accepting the fact that their Drains will do a very wide range of damage.  I believe there are enough balancing factors in place to warrant at least a little investigation into whether this would work or not..<P>Scenario 2: Make the Spec line DoT AoE<BR>This is the less invasive and more likely of the two scenarios I propose.  It amounts to a band-aid fix that at least addresses the obvious problem of the spec line spell not being enough of an incentive to spec in matter.  It does have some advantages over the current setup, however.  For example, take a sorcerer at level 27 who 2/3rd specs in matter (spec level of 18).  They would have the level 27 base line DoT with a base damage of 49 and the level 16 spec DoT with a base damage of 29.  Now, take a hypothetical encounter where the sorcerer, casting this AoE spec DoT, manages to stick it on 2 enemies.  The net base damage per pulse for that spell in that encounter would effectively become 58.  Maybe he gets 3 in the AoE.  It then effectively becomes 87.  Now, I know some of you are thinking why on earth would a sorcerer in his or her right mind want to stick a dot on 3 monsters and draw agro…isn’t that suicide? Perhaps, but that’s not where this spell would truly shine.  Imagine it's RvR and your level 45 and you 2/3rd spec'ed in matter.  You would have a spec level of 30.  Those of you who have spec'ed 2/3rds in mind, how many have you caught in an AoE mez?….3, 5, 7?  Imagine in the chaos that it was a DoT…you would be actively doing damage to all 7 for 6 pulses.  Heck, imagine turning around and tossing an AoE dot into another group of people…now how many are you actively effecting?  The balancing factor here is that at a spec level of 30 you would only have access to a spec dot with a base damage of 49.  Of course, level is factored into the equation that determines how much the spell will actually pulse for….but it certainly isn't bolt damage.  The fact that you would do the damage to potentially lots of people are what would make it useful.  <BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<P>Again, I agree Matter is broken....above is my suggestion on how to fix it. And I still enjoy my choice in making matter a primary spec...<P>--------------------<P>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<BR>Myrcil the Briton Matter Sorcerer<BR>Member of the Furious Pantaloons<BR>Galahad Server<BR>Member of the Sorcerer Testing Team in Beta<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<P>"Who could ever calculate the path of a molecule?<BR>How do we know that the creations of worlds are not determined by falling grains of sand?"<BR>  --Victor Hugo, Les Miserables

Well Jenlei, I find it respectable that you not only rolled the dice on what the populus had denounced as a career path, but then took all the criticism in stride and with integrity.  If Matter works for you...so much the better.  Just because Matter is the minority group doesn't mean that there are some people who find ways to make it do the job.<P>I think no one can disagree, though, that it needs more.

Woot Another Matter Sorcerer.  However, I am only lvl 21 with a 19 spec in Matter.  At 50 I plan on being 44 Matter 30 Body.  The only problem I see with Matter Sorcerers is there needs to be a way for us to get pets.  Maybe there should be a way to summon a Earth, wind, water, or fire pet, or something along those lines.<P>--------------------<P>Cenergy 50th Smite Cleric<BR>Tuthican 36th Sword/Board<BR>Blemish 20th Matter Sorc<BR>Googley pet minstrel

How is the DoT more of a "fire and forget" spell than just throwing in a single body spec nuke?<P>How long does it take you to cast that DoT? It takes me 2 seconds (base) to cast my body spec nuke, and I'd guess it does about the same damage. I just have to wait a sec to cast it so I don't take aggro.<P>For me (and apparently lots of other sorcerers), the lack of spells in the Matter line is what drives me away from it. I'm level 50, and I'm 35 body, 34 mind, so I'm just holding out for Matter since dumping my remaining points into Body wouldn't get me a better nuke at this point (and the debufs are useless of course). Let's hope they add some interesting stuff to Matter!<P>Regardless of the logical arguments, I'm glad you've found a template that makes you happy - that IS what counts in any case.<P>--------------------<P>Naeen / 50 Sorc / Morgan Le Fay<BR>See my sorc guide at  <A HREF="http://www.hallowedcrusaders.org" TARGET=_blank>http://www.hallowedcrusaders.org</A>  (see Articles)

A few things I like about matter is....<P>I can drop a DOT on a stealther and he can't stealth again for 24 seconds, not to mention at lvl 23 my DOT hits him for 200+ damage.<P>In fights I can just cast my DOT on about 10 different people run back and watch the battle unfold.  Since my DOT is hitting for 200+ at lvl 23, I just did over 2000 damage in that fight.  That is alot of damage at my lvl and the mana drain is not that bad.  It also brings me in some decent RP's.<P>--------------------<P>Cenergy 50th Smite Cleric<BR>Tuthican 36th Sword/Board<BR>Blemish 20th Matter Sorc<BR>Googley pet minstrel

Wow, couple of great points raised so far.  Lets see if I can address a couple...<P>(If any of the original posters feel my quote skews the initial intent of the selection taken out of context, just let me know and I will try and clarifiy...)<P>First this from Naeen...<P>"How is the DoT more of a "fire and forget" spell than just throwing in a single body spec nuke?"<P>That is an excellent question! Let me try and explain the thought I had in mind when I typed that.  For starters, there are literally dozens of factors that effect my role in a group...am I the primary crowd controller?, are there other sorcerers in the group?, is there a minstrel in a group?...etc.  For the sake of this example, I will assume that I am the primary CC'er and the group is engaging mobs that exhibit BAF behavior.  My goal, in this hypothetical group, is to control the mobs that are not melee engaged.  Once I have successfully immobilized the extras, either by mez or by sending a pet to hold attention, then my next goal is to assist with damage dealing.  Now, for me, I am never really trying to be the one that deals the most damage...so long as I contribute in some way, I feel good about our victory.  Having a little bit experience in a primarily body spec'ed sorcerer, I know that the DD's cannot be cast too early in the fight or else you will draw aggro...and most likely die.  A fact that Naeen alludes to when he said, "I just have to wait a sec to cast it so I don't take aggro".  DoT's, however, I can cast early, and provided they stick, can forget about the mob for all intents and purposes and focus on my CC duty.  <P>In RvR, the fire and forget mentality gets translated into exactly what Cenergy describes when he wrote...<P>"In fights I can just cast my DOT on about 10 different people run back and watch the battle unfold. Since my DOT is hitting for 200+ at lvl 23, I just did over 2000 damage in that fight. That is alot of damage at my lvl and the mana drain is not that bad. It also brings me in some decent RP's."<P>One of my funniest RvR stories involves something very similar...it also happens to be one of my earliest.  I was in a keep re-taking group that had just liberated Benowyc and we got a crazy idea to check out the middy mile fort.  When we got there we ran through the gate and totally surprised a group of mids setting up to head out....not to mention they totally surprised us too...<P>The result was utter chaos...I was frantically hitting g, 1, 3 [target nearest enemy, /face, DoT].  I stuck DoT's on 4 peole in rapid succession amidst the mass of tons of fighting all around....my heart was pounding out of my chest.  I spotted a dwarf off on the side and ran towards him.  In my haste I didn't realize he was making spell casting motions...or I was too frantic to notice...and then BOOOOM, I blew up so hard I think my relatives in Texas felt it...I forget how much damage it did...but I know the next two times someone tried to rez me I died again due to the excess damage...<P>Anyway, at some point in all that I got 12 RP.  I don't remember how I got the points, but I talked about that encounter for a full week...it was so fun....I was laughing hysterically by the end...<P>But I digress....great points everyone...keep em coming.  Oh, one more thing, your Template, Malachi, is very interesting.  I would be very interested to hear the clever tactics you would devise to utilize the wide arsenal it would afford you...<P>--------------------<P>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<BR>Myrcil the Briton Matter Sorcerer<BR>Member of the Furious Pantaloons<BR>Galahad Server<BR>Member of the Sorcerer Testing Team in Beta<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<P>"Who could ever calculate the path of a molecule?<BR>How do we know that the creations of worlds are not determined by falling grains of sand?"<BR>  --Victor Hugo, Les Miserables

Wow, thats fantastic Riz, I am happy that works for you.  I see the fact that you can do 110 at level 23 plus crits as a great thing.  The fact that I am a matter spec'ed sorcerer and my DoTs are my primary damage dealer means that I bring something slightly different to a group in addition to those CC trademarks that make sorcerers group friendly.  As a matter of fact, I actually enjoy grouping with sorcerers specc'ed that way, because while I am off immobilizing enemies and softening them up with DoT's the tanks and the body spec'ed sorcerer are off taking them down and we all are reaping the mutual rewards.  <P>The bottom line is what Naeen so eloquently nailed right smack dab on the head...<P>"Regardless of the logical arguments, I'm glad you've found a template that makes you happy - that IS what counts in any case."<P>--------------------<P>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<BR>Myrcil the Briton Matter Sorcerer<BR>Member of the Furious Pantaloons<BR>Galahad Server<BR>Member of the Sorcerer Testing Team in Beta<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<P>"Who could ever calculate the path of a molecule?<BR>How do we know that the creations of worlds are not determined by falling grains of sand?"<BR>  --Victor Hugo, Les Miserables

Jenlei, first, props for providing a well thought out, detailed post.<P>However, I still have to disagree with you.  Add either of the fixes you put in, and Matter is still god awful.  Why?  A few points of note, that I know have been discussed here before, but eh.<P>- DoT vs our DD.  DD is leaps and bounds more mana efficient, will not render a mez completely useless (until it becomes so anyway in the next patch.  le sigh), and will usually hit for more damage anyway, even without a crit.<P>- One spell a spec line does not make.  Obviously, there are other classes that are basically 1 spell spec, but there are at least other spells in the line that have SOME use.  The one, count em, one other spell in the line is a complete joke.<P>So anyway, increasing the potence of the DoT line isn't gonna cut it, IMNSFHO.  Matter needs a complete overhaul.  Start from scratch and add new spells from the ground up.  I honestly wouldn't even care *that* much if we weren't given a chance to re-spec.  At the very least, it would show that Mythic is paying attention to our poor class.<P>As a side note, me and my 29 Sorc on Guin are gonna tough it out.  I came very close to quitting, but I intend to be stubborn.  For better (ha!) or for worse (most likely), the Gimp will live on.  <P>Besides, it could be worse.  We could be Cabalists.    <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>--------------------<P>- Aestus Prasinon<BR>- Saracen Sorcerer: Guinevere<BR>- Deus Vincit :Fear the Mint:

Very good points, Aestus! <P>(This post is turning out far better than I had originally thought by the way...I fully expected to have to duck and cover the moment I hit the 'add post' button)<P>To answer your points,<P>"DoT vs our DD. DD is leaps and bounds more mana efficient, will not render a mez completely useless (until it becomes so anyway in the next patch. le sigh), and will usually hit for more damage anyway, even without a crit."<P>I personally feel that a lot depends on your own view of your sorcerer and how you envision him contributing in the virtual world.  I think the largest contributing factor to why you and I would tend to disagree is the fact that I do not consider my sorcerer primarily a damage dealer.  To me, I feel just as good after a fight if I have successfully kept all the mobs mezzed and all my group mates have survived as I would if I had drained, or DoT'ed them all to death.  Now, that does not mean I endorse that attitude for everyone, as a matter of fact, I am counting on the fact that others, including other sorcerers like Rizeo, are more focussed on damage dealing.  I see myself in more of a symbiotic role where I get the most exp and rp by helping my group to stay alive...and, also throwing in some not too shabby damage along the way.<P>When I solo, however, is when the damage output becomes key.  And is really the only time I imagine the ease of blowing something up at range.  But I have found more than enough tactics to allow me to be successful by myself both with and without a pet and still remaining primarily matter specced.<P>And your second point,<P>"One spell a spec line does not make. Obviously, there are other classes that are basically 1 spell spec, but there are at least other spells in the line that have SOME use. The one, count em, one other spell in the line is a complete joke."<P>I absolutely 100% agree with this as well as your elaboration that follows.  Matter needs fixing in a big way.   What I offered was a way to fix the silliness of the base and spec dots doing the same amount of damage for a 2/3 spec matter sorcerer.  That, of course, is only one facet of the, as you correctly put it, 'overhaul' that needs to take place with the spec line.<P>--------------------<P>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<BR>Myrcil the Briton Matter Sorcerer<BR>Member of the Furious Pantaloons<BR>Galahad Server<BR>Member of the Sorcerer Testing Team in Beta<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<P>"Who could ever calculate the path of a molecule?<BR>How do we know that the creations of worlds are not determined by falling grains of sand?"<BR>  --Victor Hugo, Les Miserables

I like DOT's.  I think they are a neat trick.  But.....They raise the question of agro management.  I feel one of my main contributions to a group is to make certain that the tanks control the agro.  Now if a pull goes bad or a healer has to use an instant, I don't wnat to use my level 8 amnesia on the mob with MY dot ticking on him....<P>--------------------<P>Albundy NerfedAlot.

34 mind 35 body and in a pyg group I not only do cc but deal more damage than everyone else combined.<P>The other day in rvr I mezzed an orange sb (I'm 49 so he was 50 and most likely kitted out in epic gear), got some range and nuke him before he reached me. With matter you'd do what? Mez, dot and run?<P>So you can dot a stealther? So can I if I want to with the base dot. I'd much rather mash my pet attack key while getting in root range then nuke him.<P>Ultimately if you're happy then that's the main thing but you've come here say that you've played various sorc templates and that's what you prefer, I just don't see the attraction.

DOTs actually help with aggro in many cases. The fire and forget nature comes into play when they do not interrupt what else you can do while they are still working. You can apply a DOT and STILL blast... now your DOT damage is added each round on top of your blasts.<P>Back in BETA the matter was was the do all and end all of both Cabbies AND Sorcerors. Not even the mighty paladin, nor the horribly overpowered fire wizard could compare with what we could do. Soloing 2 or 3 reds at a time with no pet was commonplace.<P>...alas, things have changed.<P>But the pendulum has swung too far the other way. Matter is indeed an underdeveloped line. this does NOT mean the spells in the line are useless. We could not survive without the matter line, but speccing to gain abilities in the telekinesis line is less than spectacular. Spec used to increase the effectiveness of our self buffs, that was changed. DOTs used to layer, that was changed (and this one I 100% agree with). But after some logical realignment of the spells, matter is left wanting.<P>We can all agree on this, but this does not mean the spells in the matter line are useless, far from it.<P>My general spec path is one that allows me to do everything a sorceror is capable of reasonably well. I am not a weak wizzy who mezzes, I am not a weak cabby who cannot summon. I am a sorceror. The end result is Mind 34, Body 30 and Matter 29.<P>Now of prime importance to me is keeping an even con pet. Then I split all points fairly evenly between the other 2 specs. I will change depending on if a key spell will become available one way or the other.<P>The reason 30 Body is important for me is the AE root, but this is far mroe important in RvR than PvE to me. <P>DOTs are frequently resisted less than my other weapons. Enemys cannot run out of DOT range once it is applied. And I can still be doing damage to help the gorup without drawing aggro, or having to take my attention off the CC duties.<P>And there is not much more satisfying than DOTing the assassin who tried to kill you, watching him run back to the safety of his guards, and still dropping dead before your eyes.<P>Also, the DOT damage was something i tried to have addressed long ago. They adjusted it some but not enough IMO. The advanced specs do the same amount of damage per tick, but for 2 tickls longer. this only applies if you are almost completely Matter spec though. If the line was worth total dedication, this would be great. The spec level DOTs need to be scaled to be earned 1/3 earlier to match the baseline DOTs on a per tick damage basis. this would open it up and have the last 15 to 20 levels add some truly devastating DOTs.<P>But ya know what? The entire focus of the spec has always been 2/3 of your level. Why spells were added above elvel 30 i don't know, but the whole 2/3 balance is thrown out the window when there are spells ABOVE lev 30 spec that you really need (want) for your class. The level 32 charm is a prime example. To remain capable we HAVE to go over the 2/3 spec target. The spec level spells shoudl have topped out at 30, and anything higher shoudl have only been gained in baseline.<P>....but I digress....<P>--------------------<P>i3ullseye<BR>"You're good, but me?

There are plenty of debates as to effectiveness and efficiency, but DoTs are just a different playstyle.  Jenlei enjoys it, and so much the better I say.  More diversity!<P>A couple of points in arguement for DoTs, there's a couple prime uses...<P>First, I find them to be *very* pro-agro-management.  It's true that a Sorcerer can chain-cast about 4 DDs in the same power amount of one DoT, and do twice as much damage.  That's great, but in some instances, that's a *bad* thing.  See, DoTs allow you to sprinkle damage...doing four DDs for twice the damage will anger the Mob at you, which is a bad thing.  DoTs add your own extra bit of damage without worry of removing agro from the tanks (any tank that can't hit for 200 damage in the timeframe of 4-6 ticks shouldn't be whacking at the mob, they should be hitting grass snakes to practice more, or get a new sword instead of the wooden one they're using).  Now, there's the issue about amnesia: when the beast gets on the Cleric, the normal thing is either confuse it off (drastic), or wipe it's memory so the next hit by the fighters will redraw agro, right?  Well, when a DoT is on there, true, timing could make it so *you* are the next one who draws agro.  But consider this:  that one zap by the DoT is about 50 damage, right?  Hopefully one of the multiple fighters on the beast should be able to hit for more than 50 damage.  Mercenaries specifically hit very fast, so between that and Bladeturn, it seems like it's at least possible to avoid the nasty situation.<P>Second, and *very* important....DoTs are effective in RvR specifically against casters.  It interrupts them profusely, meaning they can only use their quickcast to get anything off.  So, in a battle, DoTs *can* be effective. <P>Now, someone asks, "Why not just DD the caster to death?"  Well, it depends on what you want to do in the fight.....say you have about 10 seconds to work before you die (yes, we die fast, as if anyone needs to learn that *grin*).  In that ten seconds, you can DD one caster to death and take him out of the fight, or you can apply about 3-4 DoTs to 3-4 different casters and keep all 3-4 of them unable to cast for however long the DoTs last.<P>(Note: I haven't tried this before.  Heh.  So I'm theorizing with what I know of how DoTs work.  Those who practice it, can you verify this?  Is there space between ticks when a caster can get a spell off?  Or is the space just small enough that it will always interrupt the caster?)

What sort of balanced sorceror doesn't use amnesia against high level mobs? You're job is crowd control AND aggro management. Cast a dot then try to get the mob off a caster/cleric and chances are you're getting it next. Not exactly a new idea but don't spout about how great a dot is just because the damage is spread over time, so what?

Again, I reiterate that it *should* seem likely that a Tank will hit the mob harder than your piddly DoT tick and *should* be able to get it off you before you die.  A single mob hasn't been able to kill me in one swipe since I hit 40 or so.  I died once when two trees hit me simultaneously, but that's technically two hits at the same time...<P>So while it can be considered risky, it's also not too wild of a technique if the Tanks are doing their job and putting out damage.

DoT does NOT interrupt u every ticks, i've tried many time got DoT on me and im still casting.  the mostly reason that make u think u got interrupt when DoT on u is cause the "interrupt bug". a DD or any attack do the same thing to interrupt u in 5 secords.<P>--------------------<P>Gawaine<BR>Koy R4L3 49 Sorcerer

Bottom lime is that any situation you can come up with to use dots, you could have used nukes for less power.<P>And, bringing up things like stealthers can not stealth with a dot on them? What is that? If you can target a stealther you should be using your pet to keep him from stealthing.<P>Spending all those points in matter to get a dot that is barely better than the free base line dot just does not make much sense.<P>Battik<BR>P.S. I love the story of the guy that kept switching targets and dotting. How exactly is that any different than switching targets and nuking, other than using twice as much power?

Well Battik, Meek, whatever your play style.  Some things make more sense than others, but what's important is enjoying it.  I've heard Archers whine that they're bored because they can only do one thing: one-hit Crit even con Mages.  It's damned effective....but highly boring to some of them.<P>So what matters is enjoying your work, however you choose to do it.  <P>For arguementative purposes...for both the stealther and the 4 people idea.  First, on the stealther one, a DoT makes certain they don't stealth for the amount of time it takes.  Sicking your pet on it is nice, but what about when we die within the first 15 seconds of a fight, as many Sorcerers do?  Then their pet walks off, and the Stealther can go back to work.  Same with the four people, even if we die the DoT keeps ticking.  Now I know you can do the same amount faster with a DD....but it's at least possible, if that's your style, to try using DoTs since, by Meek's admission, we aren't expected to do major amounts of damage (think it was meant for PvE, but it applies somewhat to RvR as well, to some extent, yes?)<P>There's probably a definate answer out there somewhere about which is technically more efficient, more sensible, etc.  But if you enjoy doing what you do, then by all means, let no sensibilities or efficiencies stop you from enjoying.

You are wrong Stellaris, the original post was not just about how much the poster enjoyed playing a matter specced sorcerer.<BR>It actually implied that by using dots the sorcerer could provide better CC. Which of course is simply not true. Calling a DoT a "fire and forget" spell is kind of funny to me. Are nukes not fire and forget? If you have problems drawing aggro using nukes then maybe you are just nuking too early. <P>Ok, stealther attacks, send your pet and dot if you are that worried about it. You do not need to have specced matter to do that. <P>I ma not sure what the "4 person idea" is, unless you mean the switching targets and dotting. In that case your nukes are doing as much damage as the dot would and all at once. The faster the damage in rvr the better, actually in pve too. If you die while switchig targets and dotting you have to stop doing that just as if you were killed when nuking.<P>I don't care how anyone speccs, if you want to go 50 matter go for it     <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"> But, the original post was trying to point out the advantages of speccing matter when in reality the negatives far out weigh the positives. In fact after reading the post I still could not see any positives for speccing matter.<P>Battik

I'm find it amusing that people are worried about drawing agro as a Sorc due to damage output.  I could'nt draw agro if my life depended on it, not with DD and definately not with DoT.  The only time a Sorc has to worry about agro is while mezzing.  Maybe its the groups I'm in, but general rule is that I'd have to chain nuke from the start of the fight to even come close to enough damage to draw agro.  And before someone tells me its because I have poor stats: 255dex, 255int (thank you buf bot!), 50 (35+15) Body skill.  Ah well, moot arguement anyway, this game is about RvR, not PvE.  <P>Syth

Fire and forget exclusively refers to soemthing you activate, then it continues to work and do it's job without any further attention from you. A blast does NOT ualify, becuase after the blast it is doing nothing else, hence DOTs and Debuffs are Fire and Forget, DDs are not.<P>Of utmost importance to me is range... range is everything in this game. And if you apply a DOT to a target, the range you can continue dealing damage to them has beome infinite. I always break a Mez with a DOT in RvR. Then there are 2 options. they charge me and my pet and blasts can whittle them down, or they run away, and my DOT continues to do damage while my pet chases. Normally it is the DOT that drops their health enough to lower their run speed and they MUSt turn to face my pet, with no END.<P>The DOT is the primary form of damage I apply in RvR. Before the Pet, before the DD, always the DOT.<P>I don't see hwo anyone can not understand the Fire and forget comment made here. I can't understand how anyone can't see the inherent bonus when your target runs out of range, or goes stealth, and you can STILL be doing damage to them.<P>--------------------<P>i3ullseye<BR>"You're good, but me?
