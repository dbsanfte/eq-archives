Rupture? bah, i just dissease DoT myself with a low level DoT and bye bye your mezzes (by the way, rupture is awfully mana expensive)<P>And how would you exactly duel me playing your bard, as well considering high magic resist (no stuns, no bellows, no mezzes, no magic trick on me), since you NEED to melee me to win (ever heard of shadow step? aye, melees worst nightmare). And please bro, dront tell me you DoT kite me around with Selos ROFL. That is useful agains a melee. But songs got shorter radious than spells when i comes to cast the away. And if you get close to me, I load dissease/poison DoTs on you. If you resists em, I just lifetap you down with DemiLich (=clarity 4) all the time up. I dueled that 60 bard friend of mine like 8 times in a row in the Arena, and he could NEVER win me. He had actually to melee me to deal any considerable damage, hence I would shadowStep and lifetap back, no biggie.<P><BR>    <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR> When it becomes an absolute necessity we have the bard who can do 2 mobs or so and at 53+ can do CC on like 5.  <HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Bejesus Crist mate, you absolutely have no frikking clue. A bard can hardly keep 3 mobs controlled (hardly any better than a necro). Or are you maybe talking about charming one, send it to another 2 while having the last 2 mezzed?? Please bro, wake up, that aint feasible. Charm brakes = 3 frogs on your butt.

Besides, Ive seen a high level rogue with epic solo 2 warriors in a row, one after the other with no HP regen between fights (yes, at high level their dmg output is THAT crazy). Considering warrior's damage output is WAY higher than a pally's, and that you WILL NOT be able to heal yourself with a duel wielder rogue devil double stabbing you (read casting interrupts + stun/root is resisted fairly easily) you will get owned in pure stright melee damage (and you wouldnt turn your back to a rogue would you?)<P>And many many many other things I have read that just show how newbie-clueless you are. Just stop posting bro and level up a bit, and you will realize what is it about.<P>--------------------<P>Yaguex, warlock, Paradigm, Solusek Ro.

Yaguex,<BR>     Sorry to break this to you but youre an idiot.  I said "I dont like necros in group PVP".  You blue servers have no f**ing clue what group PVP is because you cant do it.  The only way you can do it is in the arena itself and nobody will go there because level 60's will farm their whole group.  Necro's arent bad solo killing other solo people, as long as they can get darken to stick and the other person cant gate.  I have personally gated from over 100 necro PK's and only died to necros like 3 times. Necros arent Wizards they just plain cant kill you before you gate, its impossible.  Their DD's suck and I guarantee you they dont ever have a 5 second kill ability at any level with any spell.  I can resist their snares just as easily as they can resist my mez and I could JBoots away from their pet NP if I still had em(jboots), or I could just SOW away(potions) like I always do now.  <P>My last 5 necro fights went like this:<BR>1) She gets the jump on me when im totally not ready.  Pet is hitting my rune and im resisting DOTS, I gate when pet finally got through rune for 18 damage, thats all I took that fight.<BR>2) I talked trash on /ooc and since she still had me targetted she hit /d and I accepted.  I buffed myself and summon/buff pet then medded to half mana found her and owned her, my pet killed hers with help from a DD and her jboots couldnt outrun my SOW, I couldnt get anythin to stick on her but finally managed to get her into a corner against the water and she had to try to swim to the other side to escape my pet, it nailed her hard since it was faster than her in the water and she died as she stepped onto shore.<BR>3) I sat by corpse so I could laugh at her when she got it.  She got her stuff in skeleton form and started fighting and I pillage/tishan/root her and it was over in a few seconds.<BR>4) Some other necro tried to gank me while I was duelling a wiz.  Wiz quit killing me and I gated easily away from the defluxing nec.  Gate wins VS deflux 100% of the time.<BR>5) Some necro tried to PK me when I was challenging everyone in the zone to a duel, I mezzed his pet and gated then dispelled DOTS (shaman potions) then buffed up.  The necro stayed in zone and I hunted him down.  Mezzed his pet and then tishan/mez him since he wasnt in skeleton form(no DOT to break mez) and then blind him followed by STRloss stack and another blind and then I kept him blind the entire time while I discordant/mez him.  He got off one harmshield and 16 seconds later I casted mez which hit ~0.5 seconds after the last blink of the protection and then discordant him to finish.  His only other spells were gates that got locked up.<P>The first 3 was against a notable PK necro, second was a duel interruption where I was already down to half HP from the wiz(level 58, killed me in ~30 seconds first time, first time I lost a duel in months) and the necro was higher level and the 5th was against an idiot that must have been worrying about fire/cold resist because he didnt load up the MR when he stayed in zone.<P>Note every single time I got jumped by the necro and every single time except #3 he had pet up and zero times I died from the attacks.  That was the events of the last 3 days I played EQ.  Almost every day I have to do that same damn thing.  Not like its a once in a lifetime thing.  I play on Rallos, like 20% of all chars are necros on my server because of how good they can supposedly PK.  I dont think they are so good because they dont have fast damage and they cant cast MR on their pets(for idiot blues like you this means their pets arent ~90% MR).<P>I dont know what you think high level is but the first person was 50th so didnt have splurt and both the other 2 splurted me.  I guess those arent high enough levels?<P>Why the hell are you saying "not useful in groups?" then talking about bards?  Im talking about necros, I dont group with them because 90% of the time they dont know how to do it.  BARDS on the other hand do tend to do well in groups which Im sure you would have figured out if you werent an idiot and learned to read.<P>I duel people with 158MR and self dot all the time, its NP really, I just beat another 53 necro in a duel like 2 weeks ago which had untouchable MR and disease cloud up.  We both had pets and she couldnt do **** to mine since mine had MR and I knocked hers out of the whole fight with 2 dazzles.  I made her OOM with sieve and dropped her protections with pillages and the pet wasted her in no time flat.  BTW I am 52 not 59 so I cant RAPTURE.  Rapture also DOESNT suck because in normal PVP (which you know nothing about) everyone isnt duel buffed with self DOT so its an automatic ability to strip all mana/buffs before they break it and then start in with tishania/blind/discordant/mez because people dont have 158MR when they are trying to level usually.  You cant prepare only to battle enchanters when you travel because every other class (notably wizards) will own you easily with ice and fire spells.  The likelyhood of you fighting an enchanter is much worse than fighting wiz or druid or necro so thats what people prepare to fight, that leaves Enchanters with serious debuffing abilities easy kills most of the time now especially after tishania upgrade.<P>If you gotta ask how a bard will duel you, you also must be an idiot, a smart bard can win ANY duel easily in an outdoor zone and can win most duels in indoor zones easily as well.  They kill pets in 18 seconds no matter what you do to them, they can leave level 60 cheetahs in the dust, they can run off and heal way faster than any class can recover the damage they did before the bard ran.  If the bard would have let me play his char and the duel was in karanas the whole zone would have laughed at you 8 times when you kept losing.  All I gotta do is run off when I get to half life and youre at half mana.  I heal up in the time it takes you to get a bubble of mana.  Do that 3 more times or so and youll be OOM and an easy kill since bards track.  The bard you duelled was stupid, because he gave up the best advantage he had, the ability to tactically retreat and use his awesome recovery spells like Hymn and cantana to recover his HP in extremely fast times and then come back and finish you off.  There is no classes in EQ that can take a smart well equipped bard in the karanas, NONE AT ALL.  Get me the info for a 60 bard on your server and I will battle every single damn person on your server and beat every single one of them with the possible exception of a FEW shadowknights and a lot of the fights with bards would be a draw because bards just plain cant beat other bards they totally cancel each other out.<P>If you dont think a bard can keep 3 mobs mezzed once he gets his mez upgrade youre also an idiot.  The mez upgrade for a bard has enthrall hold time.  Yes thats ~36 seconds.  Easy to keep 3 totally locked NP with hold times like that.  If there are bards on your server with that spell who still use pixie strike to mez then I could see why you are saying that but that would also mean all the bards on your server are just as clueless as you are which I dont think I can believe....<P>Yes I do fight in sebilis, its the only dungeon my guild can fight safely in because my guild and its friends totally control that dungeon on our server, its practically the only one we can go to safely at all.  Every other one we will be attacked all the time by people who KOS my guild or we will end up fighting our enemy guilds the whole time we are there and we wont get to exp.  I would love to fight in howling stones or guk or sol B, but I cant, I do fight players and kill them all the time in those dungeons though (not HS because I didnt waste the time to get a key dont even know where this dungeon is because I know I cant go there, again, because I PVP and you dont).  Also bards can tank 3 mobs with good equiptment and buffs for a surprising amount of time especially with CH's.  If the CH pulls some frogs off the bard onto the CLR its NP to mez the 3 with upgrade and keep them that way while the bard throws up some heal songs or stuff to pass the time before they need to refresh mez.<P>About the BOTB, there is a reason I said "nearly wins" because we get top 4 every damn time.  Why dont we win?  Because we arent UBER we dont kill dain we dont kill karana we dont kill yael we dont kill tormax we dont kill the statue, in short the equiptment we go up against makes it so we nearly cant compete at all, yet we still do compete in ghetto items and still get top 4.  If every server had to play the final best of the best with the items the Rallos/Tallon/Vallon player had we wouldnt get under top 2 and we would win almost every time, again this didnt occur to you because you just plain cant think.<P>For the Paladin/Ranger that im gonna be, note that it is on the new server Sullon Zek and people WONT have uber items with bomb resists when they are starting out and they will be able to be affected by stuff like stun/root/snare.  Also all the way up to the very high levels a rooted rogue will die to a paladin NP.  At 50+ there is a much higher swing toward the rogue especially with weapons like trak teeth (which there wont be any of on people before they are like level 60 on Sullon).  Also I will assume you dont know anything about resists or you would know that people can cast MR spells on people much lower than them and have them hit a lot of the time even on high MR just because of the level difference.  I can land mez on low 40's people without tishan a lot of times even if they have like 100MR and if they got 160 I can just tishan them down to 100 and go from there.  <P>Also Im a girl so dont call me "bro" please.  Also, I did spend my damn 60 days levelling to 52 so I could spend the other 60 days once I got there PVPing and killing other players 24/7.  The only reason I log onto my 52 ENC is so I can kill people that war me.  I hate EXPing more than any other person in EQ, and I so much love jumping unsuspecting players and killing them easily even if they are full/full/full.  Its no wonder everyone in the guilds we war are in full no drop only, because they have to fight us and lose all their stuff that is droppable, again you have no idea what thats like because youre on a wuss boy goodie goodie server.<P>Heck when was the last time youre server did better than mine in a BOTB? Never? I thought so... Arent you guys nearly dead last every time?<P>In short I think I have successfully proved that you know nothing about "REAL" PVP and only know how to defeat players that genuinely suck (or let you win, in the case of the idiot bard who doesnt use his class advantages).  If I have not proven this then I will again explain why all the comments you will post in response to this are also wrong and as idiotic as these you just stated.  I wish you could come to Rallos and be say level 51 with all the items you have now so I could take them all and sell them so I could buy stuff like ornate rune shield and other non-ghetto stuff.  I even have items because they look pretty and they have no stats.  Why? Because even enchanters lose fights sometimes and they rarely ever get loot because our enemies dont wear any.  I  was happy when I looted an earring from singe in sol a with 3INT and some AC on it, then that got taken too when a group attacked me, Oh well.<P>Also I would like you to show me an enchanter level 52 on any server that can come close to my number of solo 50+ kills (400+, ~5-10 a day, as many as I can find that war me).  On the 1% chance that any enchanter has that some blue server idiot ENC can match my kills it will be VS sucky opponents (read: people like you who dont know what PVP is) and I will be able to run circles around them in PVP things I learned at level 1 that you guys still dont know.<P>Do you know the name/race/sex/class/level/resists of over half of the 50+ on your server?  I damn sure do because knowledge is power and its easy to prepare for them if you know their whole character and all its weaknesses, another reason I get so many kills, again I would bet you never thought about this because you just plain suck I guess.  <P>Have you ever been in an actual guild war?  I would bet money the answer is "no", which is also why I would bet you probably never bothered to sit down and care who other people are.  So not only do I know the name/class/lvl/resist/etc of people in a guild that wars me but I know that information for ~10 guilds.  You probably cant even begin to comprehend how someone like me would have that kind of thing stored in the main access part of my brain to be recalled accurately, in seconds, immediately after I get jumped or see a persons name on /who.  Why can I do that? Because ive been around these people for 120 played days, not to mention youre an idiot if you dont know all this information about 95% of the people that have the ability to attack you whenever they want.  Pretty much the only ones that surprise me are the ones that are PL'd chars of other people that I do know.<P>Some of your statements have decent merit though against people that are probably average on your server, but they just plain dont cut it on real servers like mine.  Please /petition and get a GM to put you on my server.  Please god do this, I wanna see your char a month from now in full no drop(from getting wiz ganked a bunch of times and losing everything, haha I bet you wouldnt make it through the first time someone Ice comet kill you in one shot, youd /petition to go right back to your wussy server), getting killed by me easily even though you took all the steps you just mentioned to be able to defeat me(and me only which is why you would drop to everyone else).<P><BR>Do I have a gigactic ego? Yes, but show me ANYONE IN EQ that could teach me more than say 1 thing about PVP and Ill step down as the best PVPer in EQ but until then here is some things you probably also dont know...<P>1)  For each level you are away from your opponent you have ~8.5 resist higher or lower per level you are in relation to your target.<BR>2)  Its easier to resist Ice Comet fully with 25CR than it is with 120CR because wizard spells have automatic subtraction on resists, per class balancing which will roll the resist counter off the low end of the chart and put you on a mob type resist table based only off level.  I have resisted 3 Ice Comets fully and they have all been when I was naked, Same thing for druid scorciae I resisted it immediately after a REZ.  Note you have a better chance at absorbing "some" damage having higher resists because they help you get partials once you get 140+ resist.<BR>3)  You dont gain HP from lifetapping if they have rune up and the rune takes all of the damage.<BR>4)  If you go linkdead in PVP and are 53+ on the old world you cannot be mezzed, per standard PVE code in that area, even with rapture.<BR>5)  Rapture cannot hit level 60 players they are too high level for it to affect anywhere the spell is capped at 59th level.<BR>6)  DOTS with partially resistable or zero initial damage components are nearly impossible to resist, and thats why they are so hard to resist, not because of special game code (IE: Splurt, Drones of Doom, Winged Death, Choke).<P>Tsunamii Starshine<BR>52 Enchantress Rallos Zek<BR>Best PVPer in EQ<BR>More real kills than any other ENC in EQ<BR>More duel kills than any other ENC in EQ<BR>Most knowledgeable PVPer in EQ<BR>Level 52 most likely to beat any lvl 60 caster in EQ<BR>Biggest EGO in EQ<BR>Nicest girl around when you arent an idiot and try being nice to me<BR>Most likely to spend the time to teach someone the tricks to being elite in PVP<P>Tsunamii Starshine<BR>52 Enchantress Rallos Zek<P>--------------------<P>Tsunamii Starshine

Who are you Mythd?  You dont list level so I can only guess mid 30's max?  I said enchanters suck at PVP because they do, they always have been crippled in the killing department by huge MR (~130 on even cons after tishania upgrade), and thus normal enchanters will lose most duels because they dont know how to deal with that kind of MR.  They have only one other attack besides all MR based spells (the only broken resist) and thats a pet, no ice or fire damage or support spells and no heals.<P>Also when was the last time you saw an enchanter kill a tank that had invincible MR?  It can be done but even I cant do it most of the time because enchanters dont have the damage to do it, usually they will run OOM before the opponent dies (from DD resists) and you cant mez/med a melee or anyone else for that matter because they will just log while mezzed.<P>Also I dont appreciate being called a "raving newbie" since I know as much as or more about PVP than youre entire server combined, and can prove it.<P>Tsunamii Starshine<BR>52 Enchantress Rallos Zek<P>--------------------<P>Tsunamii Starshine

Also at newbie levels enchanters are among the worst PKers because they just plain dont have the mana to power enough chaotic feedbacks to kill someone considering its partial resistability and low damage anyway, not to mention the opponent has to be at least level 6 to fight so that means at least 6 chaotics to kill.  That isnt including roots and mez which cost a good deal of mana at that level also, assuming you were able to spend 50% of mana on nukes (very agressive only using root/chaotic and no mez) you would have to have the actual mana power to cast 12 chaotics by level 6 (which wont happen no matter what race you make your enc because of item restriction).  This figure gets slightly better at 16 when you can Warp/mez and only spend ~15% of mana on support (assuming you are killing agressively), but still with that amount of mana and the amount of resists people will be able to get will make them able to resist some of the DD's and you still wont be able to kill them.  Once you get the 24DD so you can spend ~10% on support spells you can kill pretty effectively, but the items they will be able to get by this level will still be able to fight against you well.  Also how do you plan on getting the money to get good resist jewlery as a newbie when you cant twink?<P>Also if you look over the last 2 years in this particular forum you will see I have written very detailed outlines how to defeat nearly every class in the game and get a glimpse at all the PVP I did.  Ive probably written more PVP outlines after huge PVP studies than youve fought in PVP battles.  Ive done the research, Ive fought the fights in duels and guildwars and I spent the time to learn everything about every class.  Maybe you should do the same and maybe you will know where Im commin from(the "you" specifically refers to all the haters out and about).  Actually Ive probably had more enchanters come and say hi to me and get info about being an ENC that has allowed them to win against unusual odds than youve had PVP kills.  Ask all the people that made newbies on Rallos to talk to me and get strats from me what kinda PVP skill I got, or maybe make a newbie dark elf and watch me PVP for a while.  The stuff I do will amaze you.  I commonly get away from 3 players, and commonly make 2 tanks run from me, and commonly kill them right out when there is only one person that wars me.  <P>The only thing that really screws me up is hesikih a 60 druid who continually cures poisons and chloroblasts people in his guild when I am trying to kill them.<P>Tsunamii Starshine<BR>52 Enchantress Rallos Zek<P>--------------------<P>Tsunamii Starshine

I have played on the sullon and can tell you from my experience there as an enc will pvp really well.<BR>It shows how little you know when you go talking about casting dd's till you go oom, you really so stupid to use nukes in pvp against 50+ warriors?<BR>Encs dont suck at pvp many of us are a playing example to this, your 52 have you played a high lvl enc? Caus 52 aint =).<BR>You might suck at pvp but thats no foundation to decide the class does.<BR>Let me repeat that for you, encs dont suck at pvp from your chapter after chapter of whines you suck at pvp.<BR>All clear for you?

<i>5) Rapture cannot hit level 60 players they are too high level for it to affect anywhere the spell is capped at 59th level.</i><P>This is incorrect. Just last night I mezzed a level 60 monk while screwing around before our Zland raid. As you said above, mez caps apply only while players are LD - otherwise, mez works everywhere, on everyone.<P>BTW, the rest of your post was an interesting read  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"><P><i>How would you exactly duel me playing your ench when I got 158 MR ?</i><P>Enchanters have about 8 spells that are <b>incredibly</b> useful against people with capped out MR.<P>The fact that you ask this question tells me that probably you'd lose the first duel against any enchanter using the right strategy, simply because you wouldn't be ready. You might win after that, but I would say you'd be sufficiently surprised that you couldn't kill him/her the first time round.<P>Oh, and dyou know someone named Tenazi/Tanani/Skelas? Maybe from M59 or something?

She doesn't suck at PvP; I think that's pretty safe to say, considering the size of her ego =P.

Ok how the hell would I ever get an ego if I suck at PVP, if I sucked that would imply that I dont win 99% of the time which is wrong.  If I sucked, one would imply that I would lose and thus not be able to gain said "ego".  <P>BTW 52 IS high level ask anyone 45 or under.<P>As for your enchanter on sullon... ok since you so refuse to see it my way when the server goes live lets get our characters to level 10 and fight.  If I pick paladin by that level I will be able to buff my HP by 20 which is quite a lot compared to a 32DD which can be partially resisted plus I can heal myself for 20 more between the cast of your DD's.  PLUS I would have LOH.<P>I guess I am that stupid to use nukes against 50+ tanks because they hit most of the time on my server after pillage/tishania.<P>What I see from reading your post Mythd is that youve been happy with youre enchanter all the way up never got pissed off because tishania didnt do anything a long time ago.  You must have been level 60 for a long time because Neferti who is also on teams has said over the last 2 years that everyone has such high MR there that the only thing you can do in PVP is sieve and pillage and let your friends kill them.  If youre level 60 I guess you dont have to worry about people who con higher having 70MR(after pillage/tishania) resisting everything you use.<P>BTW give me a 60 enchanter on your server (with 200MR) info and Id come over there and wreck you any time you want.  I dont have one but its only an 8 level difference, would just take me a couple seconds of lookin at the spell list and then my skill would crush you I guarantee it.  Actually, screw that give me a 60ENC/200MR and Ill use spells only level 52 or less and still win because thats the only ones I can use on my char and thats the ones I know and love.<P>Or you could just delevel to 52 and fight me.  You know what, I think Ill level to 60 and hope you win your server so I can kill you in the best of the best.  That sounds really nice.<P>Tsunamii Starshine<BR>52 Enchantress Rallos Zek<P>--------------------<P>Tsunamii Starshine

I dont have time to read your book report on my post just a few things i saw as i glanced down,<BR>So these nukes they get resisted or they dont? you wanna make up your mind might help you form some sort of solid arguement that doesnt involve your ego every other line. I was 60 way b4 tash changes and i pvped almost as well not using nukes. What you gotta understand is not every fight you get into is a clear cut thing between ya target having mr or not. It says something for your opponents if you can land blindness =) i mean really lol.<BR>As to blue cons where lvls make a difference i fight against 60's as well as low lvls like yourself. Just adjust your tatics as you fight different peps nuking till you go oom sounds a little weak, but what do i know? just pvped on vallon/tallon since day 1. Maybe if I post alot of crap on tatics (hahah) with no mention of what your opponent will or can do i can get a degree from you and then truely pvp as well you do.<BR>From what i saw the rest of your post is talking smack because you know you cant back it up, we are on a different server, maybe i see you in the botb? Not very likely i think =) maybe if you lvl up a bit u might make it to the arena.<BR>Mythd

An enchanter can beat pretty much anyone without actually landing an MR based spell.  It just depends on how cheap your willing to be?  Personally I feel beating a lvl 60 warrior by, in essance, kiting them around is NOT an honorable way to win.  Its lame, and it sucks.  But we are forced to do this if we want to win, because others just blast thier MR up.  And I agree, if you have to gate away, you loose.  Thats why enchanters suck.  If we get enough time to prepare sure we can do well, WHY NOT PLAY ON A BLUE SERVER THEN LIKE ME.  Cuz thats how our PVP works, hun.  All of your amazing PvP "conquests" involve you gating out, preparing for that specific fight, then coming back.  Why not cut out the gating out like a wimp, and just hit /d like we do?  Oh, right, but your on a PvP server, your better than I ever could be.  If you really are the best, then we will be seeing you win your servers, AND the final BotB?  <P>Coward<P>--------------------<P>Cannial<BR>Enchanter of Quellious<BR>Member of Lotus Cult

<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">
All the times I gate its usually a poor girls shadowstep.  All 5 fights with the necros were in neriak forest which is where I was bound before 2 hours ago.  Note when I said "I gated, sat down, medded a little, then came back and beat his a**", nowhere in there did it say I zoned.  I retreated, regrouped, and then came back to finish him off.<P>Also necros memming darken in duels is purely based on the server you play on.  Probably the only one they dont is on your server and the other teams, I know I hear a lot of blue necros talking about using it.  Also when a necro teams up with ENC to pvp I dont see why they wouldnt.<P>As for the "MR GEAR" statement you made, enchanters get rid of all their opponents buffs early in the fight as well as drop MR by 50 points at 44+.  To still have MR required to withstand the spells, someone would have to have ~90MR after tishania unbuffed on someone 4 levels less.  Add on the 50 to that and every person 4 levels less than a 44 ENC would have to have 140MR the entire time they played the game.  Now considering that is ONLY to defeat enchanters and getting that high of unbuffed MR requires nearly every item slot to be filled with MR items they will die to wizards and mages, etc like 100% of the time by their ice comets and stuff.  Nobody I know prepares for enchanters instead of preparing for everyone else, with the exception of 2 warriors.  Every single other person I know would rather prepare for everything else and hope the enchanters that attacked them suck at PVP.<P>I dont know where the statement "no experienced necro will use pets against bards/enchanters" came from.  They are about the best things I can think of to use against enchanters/bards on my server.  They serve as good interrupts and kill enchanter pets usually and vs bards it keeps them busy for a few seconds so maybe the necro can stack up 2 dots.  Probably on your server they can be charmed and sent against the master but they cant on mine, so I dont see why necros on my server wouldnt use them.<P>As for vexing mordania thats what 600 mana or so?  Not to mention its very easy to dispell and a good bard would have your HP gain dispelled and then his dot dispelled in say like 6 seconds... That means you gain NO life and they lose very nearly NO life.  Very inefficient if you ask me.  Then since you didnt gain the life you have to chill and sit on your ass while you get mana back to cast it again.  Not to mention the bard can dispell the mob so it doesnt lose life then you got a bard and a mob on you.<P>Bard counters to that strategy have already been discussed so I wont go into that, also note that lich series can be dispelled.  Yes that does mean the bard can just dispell you every time you cast it to try to gain mana.  It costs you ~5 to cast and costs him about 0 to dispell and takes you 6 seconds to get the mana tick.  Doesnt sound like youll gain much from that.<P>It seems Arazanos has PVE skill from your statement but PVE skill is very different from PVP skill.  A bard choosing not to use his maneuverability in PVP sounds like he needs to relearn the basics.  Also I would like to know how you killed him, was it purely with lich up and you just chain deflux him?  If he let ANY dot you cast stay on him he must not be that smart of an individual.  The most it could take to fully get rid of the effects of a necro dot is ~9 seconds, and thats for the lifetap dots.  Any other dot he could have just dispelled or used shaman potions to cure.  Ive had necros and shamans try to kill me by chain casting DOTS trying to stack everything up and hoping I die.  Those 10 stacks of cure poison and cure disease destroyed their strategy in a heartbeat.<P>I also said "Keep 5 frogs CC'd" if I remember right, CC doesnt always mean mez, it could mean mezzing 3 and the bard tanking 1 while the group tanks 1, or mezzing 3 and charming one onto the other mob, or mezzing all 5, the possibilities are near limitless.<P>Also as far as 3 Krups shredding a 1100 ac warrior... I think you are assuming that a shaman didnt slow these, if they are all shaman slowed then CH's can easily keep the warrior alive while enchanters mez the extras.<P>___________________________________________<BR>Again, the same case like when you said the bard can feasible keep 5 mobs mezzed at once, you are changing your own words.  You said literally "RZ wins nearly every BotB".  Mind if I call you a lier?<BR>___________________________________________<P>Well I hate to break it to you but you cant read too well.... I said "nearly wins" not "wins nearly".  The meaning of "nearly wins" is this: Almost wins.  The new sentence would be "Rallos almost wins all BotB".  And yes we do "almost win" every BotB I dont think we have done worse than final 4 yet.<P>Also note that I never once said I couldnt learn something from other people.  I said that almost nobody can show me anything that I dont already know because I already learned it all either on my own or having someone teach me it such as Rigamortiz.  Hell Branar taught me something just now when he said rapture mezzes level 60 players.  I didnt know nor did I care that it does because I didnt think I would ever be level 60 until I decided that Im gonna kick your ass in the BotB.  I just passively heard that it didnt and never bothered to investigate.  See, I will acknowledge that I can be told something I dont know by someone else.  You on the other hand cant get simple concepts through your head like "item loot and its effects on resistances" and "bard movement abilities being very important" and "52 being a high level".<P>I know a ton of people who know that without being told and you seem to think you know more than even I do and think those are all incorrect statements or irrelivant.<P>Also Nath that was meant to be funny and Im glad you thought it was.<P>Mythd: Please STFU if you arent going to read someones post please dont reply you sound really stupid when people read what I say then you say stuff that very easily says "i didnt read what this person wrote".  If you are going to criticize at least know what you are criticizing.<P>BTW please tell me how you plan on killing someone with no nukes and no pet and no group members Mythd.  What you have to understand is that it is that clear cut, If you have no pet up and they have invincible MR you cannot win the fight, you might gate or run but you wont be killing them any time soon.  Yes it does say something if enchanters can land blind, it says "I play on item loot and you dont" which implies "a few wizards ganked me a few times when I was low on HP and took my MR stuff now its not astronomically high".  I know about nuking people and mana management and **** just like you know Mythd I played on Rallos ever since day 2.  I have had to switch up to different methods and stuff just like you have dont pretend like I havent.  Also if you want to post on tactics feel free, If you look in the past 2 years in this forum you would see all the guides I wrote on battling nearly every class in the game that took into account all major strategies those classes could and probably would use.  <P>Dont worry about the smack talkin either, I do it and I CAN back it up and I WILL level up and I do hope you can make it to test server on your servers BOTB because I do so much hope I get to kill you in the event itself or after it.<P>Wanna make a deal?  How about whoever loses to the other on test deletes their enchanter?  Come on Mythd what do ya say?<P>Tsunamii Starshine<BR>52 Enchantress Rallos Zek<P>--------------------<P>Tsunamii Starshine

Your time on this board on advice and tips has been pages and pages of self glorifying crap.<BR>I read your posts and laugh you simply have no idea, its never that clear cut. I can just now see how your fights go, dispel tash mez mez mez oh it landed woot nuke nuke it landed yeah i can take this guy out, super your capable of pressing nuke and mez alternatively. Thats one of the sole reasons why u think its so clear cut if u dont land a nuke or mez u think its over, ergo the limit or lack of your skill.<BR>Your a noob with a big mouth, lvl up and fight me in the botb if u make it there, i doubt it, i will need to make it myself wont be all that easy but if i see you there lets shut you up.<BR>As for fighting on test i will fight you and i will beat you but i see no reason to state my character over it, quite a enjoyable game i play and id like to keep my efforts in it. I have a naked enc on test atm hes lvl 14 i think i will delvl him to 10 to fight you pre wipe, let me know when your rdy.<BR>You not see a patern yet? people with some clues on high end pvp are telling you to shut up your ego? Your not the best pvper in eq, i read your posts thats enough for me to see that.<BR>And heres some advice for you bro, charm, learn to use it.<BR>jelly_no1@hotmail.com is my addy send me a mail when your pally is rdy to fight make it short and sweet im not opening a 10 page email from you. Thx for much for ya time if anything it has been amusing. Nothing more id like to add to these boards, later. =)<BR>Mythd =)

You must not have read much of my posts because all the guides I wrote are with the pretense that the opponent is nearly unhittable MR.<P>Also I will be levelling my 53 ENC over the next month or so until I get 60 then Ill work on sullon maybe.  I hear they are changing all the PVP servers so we will be able to hit out of range people on them, I might not even need to switch now.

I doubt Mythd ever read any of your guides, which sound like more self-glorifying bull**** to me. Fact is, Mythd is considered by most high level people on tallon to be the best pvp enchanter on the server (poll on tzt). I used to play on rallos and still talk to quite a few people who play there, and as for best enchanters, I've never heard your name mentioned once. Stick to trying to impress bluebies with your l33t strategies that only work on people with 20 mr, because Mythd or whoever wins server on tallon isn't going to be fighting you on test.<P>-Carn<BR>59 Beguiler

What people are you talking to?  The only person that can touch me is possibly Rykker who I think is level 53 too.<P>Tell me who are the names that got dropped and who dropped them for my server?  I guaranteed can cut out 75% of your list because im sure they havent PVP'd since level 48, at least not against PVP guilds.  <P>Try askin the people in the guilds that war Peacebreakers which Enchanter they dont want to come up against.  Try askin some low 50's in those guilds which ones they dont want to come up against.<P>Actually to tell the truth I cant think of any other enchanters on my server that even PVP besides myself and Darkenbane enchanters.  I dont hear about/see any other enchanters PVPing.<P>Come on drop some names I wanna know who you think ill be fighting.  This should be funny...<P>Come on say Hunsa you know you want to.  She is the favorite I heard when I was like 48 because she was one of the only 2 level 60 enchanters on the server.  How about Endymia she was second favorite!  Come on say some  from all those power gaming guilds that never PVP in their life.<P>Dont worry if I can get 60 fast enough it will be me up there vs whoever beats you Mythd.<P>Tsunamii Starshine<BR>52 Enchantress Rallos Zek<P>--------------------<P>Tsunamii Starshine

Mythd is in Pandemonium and they PVP every day. He's a good pvper, but like any high level chanter knows, it is never a sure thing in any battle.<P>You play on Rallos where MR isn't necessarily going to be super high because people don't always wear their best items. On TZ I routinely run into people that have 150 MR unbuffed, it really is that easy to get it that high in the high level range. Some have it higher then that.<P>So nukes are basically never going to land unless they are much lower level, even then they will get resisted a ton.<P>The only sure fire way a chanter can do damage is with a pet, preferably speeded with epic and with MR on them. That's how I win most of my fights, especially in dungeons where the opponent can't kite or run around much without risking an xp death.<P>Chanters have it tough in pvp. Everyone knows our weakness. However, a good chanter can overcome that to some extent and still pvp quite well, especially against other casters where sieve and tot come in so handy. <P>Bards, and other tanks are another story, they are just very hard to take out.<P>Kirae <BR>59 Chanter<BR>Nox Noctis<BR>TZ

I definately know all that, Ive used a pet to kill more people 10+ levels higher.....<P>Im glad I can use DD's and not have to rely on only pet to kill people, why because most people wont try to stick around when they see all their buffs drop.  They know if I get off mez before they get off gate that they are screwed major.  And if they have MR up there and they get killed by a wizard they lose a TON of money value in items.  People generally dont want to do this so will take off all droppable items when they are travelling.  This is what allows me to hit them with enchanters massive debuff lines.<P>Ive definately defeated my share of 150MR 10 levels higher opponents (who must have been a little behind the power curve because I was able to make up the huge level difference).<P>BTW I am in Peacebreakers and I definately PVP more than every day, most days I log on just to kill people in the 10+ guilds we war.<P>Tsunamii Starshine<BR>53 Enchantress Rallos Zek<P>--------------------<P>Tsunamii Starshine

But don't think that others don't know them as well or don't pvp as much as you do. Mythd and Zebb are both very good pvp chanters and their guild pretty much is kos to the entire server. My guild and stance is against them, we are enemies, but I respect them as players. I would still say that chanters are not the best at pvp, especially solo, but we rock in group pvp.<P>  <IMG SRC="cool.gif" border="0"> <P>Kirae<BR>59 Chanter<BR>Nox Noctis<BR>Tallon Zek

Dont want involve myself in this discussion too much (but I still do lol), I hope it calms down a bit. I will just make some (or a lot of) loose comments. Mythd and Tsu I know you both and you two are both good pkers.<P>Oh a big /rude Carn, your adding nothing to the discussion, that is just mindless flaming.<P>Mythd: Tsu's posts are indeed long but also informative and yes I figured that out by myself a long time ago but its nice to see it written down and nice for others to learn of it, also sometimes thinking out loud is not a bad thing. And yes she admitted having a bit of an ego, but that doesnt mean she isnt a good pker.<P>Tsu: Mythd doesnt like bragging at all, even if you win all your fights. Thats probably why he reacted so fiercely.<P>Anyways heres my lil (actually kinda long) rant. Level is a VERY big advantage in PvP. For example lately I have been seeing a lot more nukes (I probe a bit with a bio orb to see if nukes are a good idea) and mezzes (whether it be glamour or even sometimes Dazzle) land (monks are fun to fight sometimes teehee).<P>Only sure way to PvP as an enc is with a pet while you annoy your opponent a bit with dispels sieves interrupts and stuff. Oh yeah its nice if you can str debuff or root or so - not likely if fighting higher level people but possible if your 60 and the other is not. You can do without, for example last week I solo killed (dont fight many people solo because Im always in groups) a level 60 rogue -with 200ish MR with epic, fungi and using poisons- by kiting him around my pet but that was certainly not easy.<P>Another way is by using charmed stuff and hoping you can stop your opponent from removing charm, your charm will hold long enough and they cant outrun it... so bad luck most of the time and too much risk of an xp death (not much of a problem if a lot of clerics you know are level 56+ and you are 60 anyways). Charmed stuff is a bad idea because people generally outrun it (unless your root or str debuff sticks long enough) and I dont feel like trying to kite people around charmed pets. Problem is charm breaks, people rooting or fearing your charmed pet (because you cast tashanian on it and didnt give it a MR buff - if you do good luck having a long charm). Of course it gets a lot easier at level 60 when you are way higher level then the mob so you might even buff it (dont know if dictate would be good because it refreshes real slow which takes a spell slot and is lots of mana, you can give your pet a MR buff safely though if you know you will win within 45 secs).<P>At some point you get rapture which will make a very dangerous addition in group PvP. RCB's (rapture casting bastards, soon I'll be one too         <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0">) as a friend put it are much better at PvP then people without, regardless of skill. Of course self dotting and such will circumvent this a bit but our self dots are kind of crappy (either short duration or hard to stick on yourself for the higher level ones and swapping your MR gear all the time is tiresome).<P>Having uber gear does also matter, gimmie some BD's         <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"> Oh yeah and its not good if people are way less lagged and zone way faster then you if you have a crappy comp :/<P>Anyways a good enchanter is a huge asset in group PvP, even if its just 2 people. For example (not meant as bragging but I must have some example) I was hunting for a bit of pp's (I was kinda broke and the hill giant hunting darks were all OOR) in TT a few weeks back (we got some regen BP's yay) with a druid friend of mine. Trak teeth is a darkie zone (well kinda) but we killed everyone there for hours every time we went there (because we were bored killing foragers all the time it was nice to see new people enter the zone). At one point we had a 5 vs 2 battle (and we fought plenty of level 60's there) and we won all the fights (except one which was 5 (of which 2 level 60 necros) + 2 pets vs 3 which ended on a draw - we killed 2 of them and got rid of the pets, they killed uhm... me /cry), people started to petition because they thought we were using some kind of bug (spirit of cheetah lol) the gm who came laughed very hard         <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"><P>Good communication and feeling/knowing what the other is planning to do is very important (we knew exactly what to expect from eachother, for example if we wanted to retreat I was covered then he soc'ed, we knew of eachother when we would chase and when to let people run and so on and so on - it matters a lot) and with only 2 people thats a lot easier. PvP with people who dont communicate or prepare well and usually ends in you losing (happens sometimes /shrug). Indoor zones are nasty because you wont be able to shake melees easily (no levitate, no running because mobs are ahead and so and hard to channel through their hits). Just a lil rant still         <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"> Actually sheesh that was a bit too long lol.<P><I>My guild and stance is against them, we are enemies, but I respect them as players.</I><P>Same there I agree with Kirae. Everyone (me too) is at war with Pandemonium (Zebb and Mythd are the members I respect despite their guild, Carn is also a member of them but he just adds mindless flames) on our server so they PvP a lot, they are also very well equipped (high HP and resists) and most level 60 which is a *huge* advantage. Pandemonium will disappear soon. In the past I have grouped with Mythd (pre-pandemonium) and yep he is a competent enchanter. But I also respect Tsunamii as a player (even tho she brags a bit       <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0">), and she is also a very competent PvP chanter.<P>--------------------<P><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=20190" TARGET=_blank>Neferti</A><BR>Human Beguileress<BR><A HREF="http://www.pixelexiq.com/kotwr/" TARGET=_blank>Knights of the White Rose</A><BR>Tallon Zek

There is one point im trying to make which you seem to not be able to grasp Mythd.  Skill is relative, you dont have to be able to beat everyone to be the best PVPer.  If that was the case then nobody could ever be good at their class and level if they were level 59 or less.<P>There is a bard Canticle on Rallos Zek level 49.  He can PVP inside dungeons.  He antiPked both a druid and a wizard at the same time all over the inside of sol B while they were trying to kill him.  Sure your bard can solo a room by himself but can he take out 2 people that are continuously trying to train him and casting through walls and everything else like that?  Being able to clear a room is based off whatever tactics you are using, being able to kill someone else especially with a bard requires countering what they do and slowly chipping away at them.  Doing that on 2 people requires much more still.   Doing that on 2 people while not getting killed by mobs is where you really start maxxing.<P>Why dont you get your bard friend and a druid up and try to re-enact what canticle did and see if he makes it.  Train him with 2 or 3 blues and then start blastin.  Use everythin you got to win because thats what the druid and wiz were doing.<P>There is a level 12 Wizard Seanmacc on Rallos who literally destroys nearly any small group in range.<P>Tsunamii Starshine<P>--------------------<P>Tsunamii Starshine

Mythd all I have to tell you is a blue server PvP is completely different than Rallos/Vallon/Tallon.  I'd challenge you to say enchanters are so good on a team server where there is no item loot.  Enchanters at high level are tough to win with.  Solo, if we are against a caster we have a chance as long as we can steal all their mana.  Against a tank you can either forget it or be prepared for a very long fight.<P>Tsu is absolutely right in her thinkings with enchanters.  Strategies for a level 52 enchanter may be different than a level 60 for PvE but they sure don't change much for PvP.<P>Level up an enchanter on a teams server before you critisize Tsu otherwise your the one that looks like a newb.<P>--------------------<P>Rashen<BR>54 Enchanter<BR>Vallon Zek
