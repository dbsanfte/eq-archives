I would consider trading the following items that I am currently using, if it involved getting something that I want more than the item itself.  In other words, probably not for cash but only for items off of my "wish list" below, since I would rather wear these items than have more cash in the bank.

Make an offer.  No tears.  If you want to whine about the prices shown on EQPrices, do it somewhere else.  

If you think the prices are wrong, feel free to submit prices to the web sites for what YOU PERSONALLY have actually BOUGHT OR SOLD the item for, in terms of platinum piece value.  If you have not PERSONALLY bought or sold the item, how do you KNOW the prices are wrong?

I reserve the right to accept or reject any offer on any item at my sole discretion.  Deal with it.  Note that I paid more than twice the list price for the Froglok Crown, so I will not be selling that item at list price.  Some prices appear to be higher on Vallon Zek than on the average server, probably due to the fact that good pvp gear is worth more.  Some prices are lower.  That's the way things work.

One more thing -- if you ask me "how much do you want for it", I'm going to slap you silly.  I want the most that I can get for it, naturally.  Suggested offering prices are clearly shown above -- see where it says "price"?  

For the stuff that I am interested in, I might be willing to pay more than list price, depending on the item and which items of mine you are interested in.  If you have one of the items on my "wish" list for trade, please let me know and let's work out a trade.

Make your best offer.  If your offer is the best and I like your offer, I will more than likely accept your offer and we will trade.  How hard is that to understand?  Even an ogre can figure that out.
