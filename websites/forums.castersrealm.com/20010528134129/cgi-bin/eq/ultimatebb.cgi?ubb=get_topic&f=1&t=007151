It is not unusual for people to think that corporations are only concerned about profit and are not concerned about quality. Sometimes it is fairly accurate. Sometimes people are just complaining without thinking.

Many of the disenchanted players feel that Verant is against them because their thoughts\ideas are not implemented in what they consider a timely manner.  I agree that the game has many issues, but I do not believe that Verant purposely tries to punish its customers, that's just silly.  It's just like politics, there are left wings and right wings, the left wings hate Verant and it's staff and the right wing (VAKs) will defend Verant without admitting some of the leftist point of view.  Unfortunately there seems to be very few people left in the middle which is why it seems it's Verant vs Customers.

EQ<P>It really isn't an unusual state of affairs.  Every single company or organisation on the Net which creates an online community, will court disdain from a vocal minority of its userbase.<P>It usually stems from perceptions of ownership.  When a person uses any online community-based service for a length of time, they come to see it as theirs.  What usually sets in then is the 'if it weren't for us, you wouldn't have a service' attitude. <P>This is usually hotly followed by the perception from some users that they really know how to run that service better than its own creaters simply because they use it so much and 'understand' what other users want (as they are one themselves).<P>The fact is that any company running a service on the Net has to balance business considerations with user considerations.  They are not, contrary to popular belief, running a service for the user.  They are running a service to make money.  If the user likes that service, then the more popular it is and the more likely it is to make money.  So, their interest in pleasing the user is <I>wholly</I> bound with their need for financial success.<P>What does this mean?  Well it means, to be blunt, that the people who say that such companies don't care what the users want, or think, are talking out of their arse.  Of course the company cares, users equal revenue.  <P>It also means that some people wallow in the mistaken belief that they could run a better service themselves.  In 99% of cases, that is untrue.  People who say that usually have no concept whatsoever of what it is like to run a financially viable Internet service and, to be frank, would probably burn in a pit of debts if they attempted it.  Why?  Because their perspective is <I>soley</I> from the users side.  They would give the user everything they wanted or desired and, given a free reign, most users want the world on a stick.<P>That's your answer.  Been there, done it, bought the T-shirt.

If I were a senior producer there, i'd have said "Yes, we <I>could</I> do that, however it isn't practical at this time".  That, of course, creates its own ****-storm.  If something is possible, and most things are possible when we're talking about code, then users see no reason why it can't be done.  If a company gives any reason for not granting a request which even <I>touches</I> on cost analysis - then they're immediately 'uncaring', 'cold', and 'profit mongering'.  However, in most cases, it will come down to costs -v- benefit, manpower, and company priorities which are the reason for things not being done.  It's simply a matter of how much a company wants to be honest about that.  I work in the much the same job as Abashi does in a company which is a little bigger than Verant.  I take the blunt approach and, I can tell you, i've had everything from calls for my resignation right through to death threats for taking the 100% honest path.  You just can't win.<P>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><B><BR>You see, sometimes the users <I>do</I> know what will make a product better.

The ones who don't, invariably think they do and the ones who do usually can't see any reason why their suggestions aren't implemented at the drop of a hat.  Of course a company wants feedback on products, but we aren't talking about a 'feedback form' on a piece of paper here - we're talking about a living, breathing community who has numerous ways to 'feedback' in real-time and a very real line of contact with the staff who could grant their requests.  That doesn't happen when you fill out a form after buying a vacuum cleaner.  In Verant's world of communication they are, again, damned if they don't address every piece of feedback they get.  In our vacuum scenario, I doubt anyone would expect a letter from Head Office telling them whether their feedback was going to be implemented or not.<P>Again, simply because something will make a product better, doesn't necessarily mean to say it's cost effective.  If they spend X$ in time and money to make Y, then they need to recoup X$ back again.  If their marketing research tells them that doing Y is not going to make their product attractive enough to recoup those costs - then they won't do it, no matter how great an idea it is.  You see this in every product, in every walk of life.  Why don't <I>all</I> cars have passenger and side air-bags, with side protection bars, ABS, and satellite tracking?  They're great ideas and they improve safety and lower insurance and risk of theft.  Well, because manufacturers have to recoup the cost of putting those features in and not everyone is prepared to, or can afford to, pay the extra money.<P>In short - it's a game to us, it's a business to them.

Don't be stupid, the problem is that customers have no recourse when they have a problem other than "in-game customer service", meaning a 17 year old Game Master with an attitude problem who hides behind mis-statements of official VI policy to do absolutely nothing to help you.<P>This, as could easily be predicted, only increases the frustration of the customer. You won't find any company, anywhere in the world in any business, that has good customer relations with such awful customer service. It's just that simple.

Read some of Absor's replies from the last couple of days.  Particularly today's post where he says something like "obviously you have no idea how this works". Implicitly demeaning the poster.  Then you'll know where the attitude comes from.<P>The interaction of Verant employees with the people who pay for their software reminds me of nothing so much as the Computer Guy from SNL.  It'd be funny if it weren't so sad.

Skaar<P>If you have a technical problem with the software, you have a phone line, an email address and a technical support board.<P>I think you're mixing up customer service with something else entirely to be honest.  They have no obligations to do <I>anything</I> to help you in game unless you are prevented from playing any further due to a bug.  If they wanted to, and to cut costs, they could do away with GMs and Guides all together and simply fall back on the technical support routes in scenarios such as you having a character popping under the world.<P>I'd expect that most requests through to GMs are probably disputes over spawns, complaints about other players, and item loss.  Verant don't <I>have</I> to do anything to help in any of those cases.  It would be cheaper for them if they didn't.  You should view those things as free player help, not customer service.

First of all Skaar you can find companies who have great customer relations with terrible customer service, Dick's Last Resort comes to mind.  And besides, they understand that if one person isn't pleased they are going to be accused of having horrible customer service, that's a given when you're talking about companies and the public.  I have had some experiences with customer service in which I didn't like the outcome, but I have never been embarrassed or put down in any events, they gave me their answer and that was that.  Why argue with them about their game?  Yes you pay to play, you pay to play by their rules.  They can't spoon feed everyone, and even if they did people would probably still complain that someone else's spoon was better.

Humm, lots of VAK's claiming it all is "their" fault (customers) for not understanding poor little VI.<P>The attitude, when I first saw it anyway, started 2-3 days after release when the client was truly bad, and after finding out the number for tech support PRINTED in the manual, and POSTED ON THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE had been closed and no notice of what the new number was. When asked about this Brad's only comment was "so what". Verant CS has gone downhill from there.

Verant has nazi attitude towards a lot of issues.<P>Remember that VI is interested in money and to make money they HAVE to make a majority of the customers happy.<P>They have a lot of polocies that i don't agree with. For instance if you take advantage of a pathing bug, you get banned. IMO thats the wrong thing to do, after all its VI's mistake in the first place, how can you punish someone over your own mistake.  A better approach would be to reward the player for finding the pathing bug, and then correct the problem. Of course i'm looking at it froma non-nazi point of view.<P>This is just one example of why i think VI are a bunch of a-holes, theres other bad polocies ranging from npc AI, general bugs, trading accounts aand ebay.  Probably more that i can't think of off the top of my head, but theres plenty of reasons not to like the company, however even so, i still like the game and continue to play it.<P>Its kind of like Prince, people say hes an ******* and hate him, but still listen to his music<P>(edit)<P>And about GM's and Guides:<P>Verant pretty much has to have them, they don't really have a choice, their software is incredibly buggy and non-functional in a lot of ways, the GM's are thier failsafe, thier to cover thier butt and fix the problems created by thier own software.  If the program was written correctly, they wouldn't need GM's or guides

Let's see <P>First they have a phone number - Have you ever tried to call it.  I have never gotten through.<P>Second they have email - Have you sent one.  I have and it was never responded to.<P>Third they do have a technical message board.  It was responded too.  The response I feel did not address the issue but at least I got a response.  <P>Problem still exists by the way.  (GEForce cards and graphical lock ups after a patch about two patchs ago).<P>There are many bugs still in the game, boat stamina bug, falling through world, pathing issues.<P>I have seen this attitude before.  I always appears at the same time in the game history.  The VAK's ( or similar for other games ) defend it.  Heck I even defended it for another game as I was an offical board moderator for them.  About a year later they sell the game to some third party to run it as the profit is not there anymore.  I know not one of the defenders will believe it but remeber this post a year from now.

That i'm not bothered about.  I still enjoy the game greatly and i've never had any customer service problems.  When I find a game I enjoy more, then i'll move.  But I really don't see the need to rant on about how evil and power-mongering the company is. I can only think the people who do are trying to be 'popular' and gain a bit of the limelight, or are simply too unforgiving and believe their $9.99 a month buys them a platinum star personal service where every need should be met instantly.

Well, lets see... the "sock puppet" (I really like that one!)spokespersons for VI have repeatedly posted that the bottom line is what is important to them, and if something is too difficult or costly (and these vague critera are quoted directly), they will not make the change or whatever.  As has been repeatedly pointed out, numerous player-frustrating bugs linger forever, while player-beneficial bugs are cause for immediate emergency patches.<P>Add to this the personal attacks on the player base posted on the old board, and you can see why VI has the repution of being against the players.<P>It is also worth noting that there is a difference between "Guides" and "GMs".  Guides are just volunteers trying to help other players in-game for free, and they have VERY limited powers... GMs are the actual VI employees with access to player files, etc.

This conflict and the perception of hostility on both sides has a long history.  Let me tell you three stories in way of explaination of what happened.<P>Story number 1<P>In Beta, the Shamans were given an Alchemy skill, it was set up so that they could make potions, training their skill in the low 20s to get better each level.  Shamans reported in bug reports, emails, and feedbacks that there was a problem with Alchemy.  While you could try it at level 1, you could not train it any higher at any level.  No matter what level you were your trainer would either tell you you were not high enough level or that you were already maxed for your level.<P>Shamans pointed this out and waited, the fact that most of the Alchemy recipes were broken, many of the herbs weren't in the game, and other little dumb things (like how the recipes gave you a totally different result than the game said they would) they let go until it could be trained.<P>Verant said they'd look into it and then came back that it worked fine, people were mistaken.  The Shamans protested, noting that they actually play this game and this was totally wrong, could they look again.  After a few months, Verant did another test, and said the same thing, they checked it and it worked fine.<P>Finally, after 9 months of constant complaints, long threads on the message board, emails, and commentary, Verant tested Alchemy with a character on a live server without it being artifically leveled.  And they found out, what do you know!  The players were RIGHT!<P>Story number 2<P>Wizards were designed in beta to be the most powerful damage caster in the game, their original description said "the masters of dishing out damage, with no rivals" and they indeed were.  The spells cost less mana, did 50% more damage, and could be cast while moving.  This was clearly too powerful and the spells were raised in mana cost, lowered in range, made only castable while standing still, and lowered in damage.<P>Then Verant noticed that the class not only didn't fit the description any more, but they really had been immensely weakened.  So they were given teleports (also to make sure Druids didn't have a monopoly on the spell line).  This was recognized by Verant to STILL not be enough of a balance, and sight spells were added to Wizards.<P>Then Verant admitted that the spells really didn't do what they had hoped, and that the class still had issues.<P>Fast forward a year or so, after Wizards trying to point out their problems in every way they can, and every single response from Verant is the same: Wizards are balanced, they are fine, they need no work, your damage is fine.  Minor changes like a purchased blast at level 49 and UV vision for a class SPECIFICALLY described with sight spells (at the highest level of any caster that gets it).<P>Finally, Verant noticed there was a problem.  Harvest was added to alleviate their extreme mana dependency, and in the class talks, Verant finally (reluctantly) admitted that there were real problems with the class, including the efficiency of some spells.<P>Story number 3<P>When Kunark came out first, they added in many new spells, primarily after level 50.  These were to drop off monsters, any monster above level 45 had the chance to drop one in Kunark, and certain areas dropped the highest level spells.<P>Except that wasn't true.  The players pointed out that the spells were NOT dropping like Verant said, especially the high level ones which NEVER EVER dropped.  Verant insisted they were, even to the point of being slightly insulting.  They said the players weren't trying the right places, that they expected the spells to drop too much.<P>Finally, after a series of increasingly irate messages, Verant finally went onto a live server and personally checked the areas that these spells were allegedly dropping.  Lo and behold, they were NOT dropping at all in most cases.  And when Verant tests, they autokill things, taking a second or so to drop something that you'd take a full fight to kill.  The spell drop rate was also found to be very, very low for the few spells that DID drop.<P>So three tries later we finally have the drop rate where it is now.  These are just three of dozens of stories where Verant and the players just didn't see eye to eye.<P>The players were got frustrated and angry with Verant, the company's attitude, and the way they dismissed concerns.  Verant got annoyed with constantly whining customers who keep bringing up Alchemy and can't EVER seem to be happy with ANY decision they make.<P>I leave you with a final story:<P>Verant starts a message board, which becomes a place to comment on problems and ask questions about the game.  Like all message boards, some people are abusive and troublesome.  Verant tries to crack down on the abuse, but doesn't put the effort into really policing the board that is needed to keep the tone polite and friendly.  Further, their bans from the message board also carry over into the game.<P>Instead of making you stop posting a while on the message board, they also kept you from playing at ALL when suspended.  Then the Verant rep goes to a tiny convention and finds out from a small minority of the people there that they don't like the message boards.  This coincides with an attempt to actually reach out to the players and find out the problems they see with their classes, an attempt to balance the game better.  Verant is deluged in problems they never wanted to know or admit were there, balance issues more complex and deeper set in the game than they had considered.<P>Suddenly the boards change format so that you can't post on there any more, only send in an email and hope for response.  The fact that the game ALREADY has this format (ever use /feedback in the game?) and that is utterly ignored is not mentioned.<P><BR>There is a long history to this, but all you have to do is read a few interviews with Abashi and Aradune to get a feel for Verant's attitude toward their customers, especially those with the gall to post on a message board.

"The official stance has been that people who complain about everything are in the minority, and people who are generally satisfied represent the average player.

I'm not going to go into specifics in this debate - it's pretty futile, especially when you are talking about class balance.  Every single class out there has a significant group of people who think their class isn't balanced - and usually on the strength of "But X class can do Y and we're supposed to do Y better!".  I agree that alchemy was pretty borked, and still is really - but, again, that's specifics.<P>One thing I would say.  I'm totally for people being banned from the game if they're banned from the message boards.  I do that myself with forums I run.  If people consistantly break Terms & Conditions whilst posting to the message boards, then they get their dial-up account terminated.  You'll find acceptable use stated in all T&C's.  I certainly checked them before ever posting on Verant's Boards as I didn't want to lose my account.  It would seem other people <B>didn't</B> check them.  In those cases, all I can say is that it was their own stupid fault.<P>I think part of the problem is that when there genuinely is a problem, many people just don't have a clue about how to articulate it.  Many people can't go beyond "You suck Verant...X is screwed!".  If I read a posting like that, I can assure you that I wouldn't bother lifting a finger to see what the poster was going on about until they learnt to put their complaint in a civil manner and with a good explanation attached.  <P>I used to read the boards consistantly and it was very definately the minority who managed to be at all articulate when expressing concern over an issue.  They also seemed to forget that the people they were complaining to are human and, human nature being what it is, those people are far less likely to pull the stops out for someone who is insulting them from the first.<P>I honestly don't have a problem with the way Abashi et al writes.  Yes, he's sometimes pretty brusk and condescending, but then he's usually that way to people who are being complete arseholes.  In his shoes, i'd be exactly the same....in fact I am, frequently. <P>It also doesn't help anyone's case that, whenever a debate like this arises, people like me who play devil's advocate immediately get insulted and called 'sock puppets' and 'VAKS'.  All that does is prove my point about employees not wanting to deal with belligerent and abusive people     <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0">

Every board administrator seems to think it's the ultimate power-trip to tell people they will have their ISP cancelled if don't play by the rules. Ban them from your forums, Ban the range of IP's they can have, we will gladly supply them for you, but don't try sending e-mail's about poor maturity in posting to us, please.<P>BTW, we had a bulletin board administrator who actually did something wrong on the internet; he spammed our e-mail server with 73,000 e-mails about the same user. So please refrain from that, it doesn't make us want to kick users anymore if you put a huge load on our servers. It just makes us want to call up your ISP for doing something a little bit, just a tiny bit (sarcasm), more wrong than posting immaturely to a message board; E-mail floods can be considered a DOS attack . . .

I was on the boards from very early on and at that point they were maybe 70-80% positive and 20-30% negative.<P>Then Abashi came as the customer rep.  He over reacted to the negative folks.  Instead of giving bland corporate responses he actually argued with and attacked them with snide comments.<P>In the areas where logic failed, he basically told folks to stuff it more than once instead of just saying, "Well that's the way it is and we can't change it because we don't have enough programmers to do it."<P>He would say the players were lying and then get caught later by proof that they had not been and the software was indeed broken and then would say that wonderful phrase, "Well it is broken as intended" which was then shown to not be true when a few months later it was fixed.<P>And then there was the Mystere and "We don't need your kind of players here" roleplaying fiasco by Scotto where they banned a major roleplaying for fan fiction written on a third party site.<P>And now there is the lovely propaganda land they've created.  The couple of polite responses I sent which contradicted their party line have not seen the board ( Amazingly a slow and laggy connection doesn't apparently affect your running speed-- everyone runs the same speed-- that's their story and they are sticking to it).<P>It's a darn fine game but I'm done with Verant and Sony pretty much for life.  I'll finish out EQ and then play non-verant mmorgs on principle.

Gestalt,<P>Yup, Abashi probably goes too far at some times.  He would do better to just do the literary equivalent of smiling sweetly and then quietly nuke the a/c of the person annoying him in the background.
