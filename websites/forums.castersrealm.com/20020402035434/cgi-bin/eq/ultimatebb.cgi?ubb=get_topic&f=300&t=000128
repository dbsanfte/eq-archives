i just copied and pasted this from:<BR> <A HREF="http://pub78.ezboard.com/feqbeastlordfrm3.showMessageRange?topicID=62.topic&start=41&stop=53" TARGET=_blank>http://pub78.ezboard.com/feqbeastlordfrm3.showMessageRange?topicID=62.topic&start=41&stop=53</A> <P>ok, well, i know it's been stated before and all that, so im not going to bother and type it all out, but im just going to copy and paste (sources at the bottom). gunna add my comments and that, for all i've seen SO FAR. so here goes<P>Get citizenship and then give your slate to Poren. He gives you a pattern and a sewing pouch. The pattern and 3 shade silk bandages (each made from 2 shade silk threads, which are each made from 2 shadeling silks) combine in the pouch to get you some handwraps and some scraps. Shadeling silks drop off of xakra worms (in Shar Vahl pits and Shadeweaver's Thicket) and lesser shades (in ST).<P>Give Poren the scraps. He then wants 2 young rockhopper claws and some forged fasteners. Young rockhopper claws drop off the young hoppers in the pits in SV. Forged fasteners are obtained by asking 'what forged fasteners?' of Kagazz, in SV. He gives you a box to fill with 4 scorpion legs (found in SV pits). Fill it and return it and get the fasteners. Combine the 2 claws and the fasteners and the handwraps to get some new recruit claws (sorry forgot name/stats).<P>Give claws and cloak to Poren, he gives you a new cloak and a seal. Give the seal to Mahron Sood (-108, -673 in SV). Sood gives you a map to give to Kery Miann (294,-348, upstairs in SV).<P>Kery gives you a stone knife. combine stone knife and HQ rockhopper hide in a sewing kit to get some straps. Get two straps, and give them and your claws to Kery. She gives you a note for Rittuh Purrik (in the camp in Hollowshade Moor). <P>Rittuh gives you a pack and says to fill it with 6 hopper tails. Get them from rockhoppers in the zone, hit Combine, and give Rittuh the result. She gives you back an 'Exaggerated Report' to give to Mian.<P>Give Mian the report and get a carved wooden box. Go to Paludal caves and kill glowing muddiggers, and put the glowing carapace or whatever from one in the box along with your cloak and combine. <BR>Give resultant chest back to Mian. Mian gives you a new cloak (ac6, Tailoring +2%, str1 sta2 hp5) Tells you to give your claws to Kaam Rahiir in the library and he will show you how to imbue the magically.<P>Kaam Rahiir is in the library outside the palace propper. (around -240 by 126) He takes your claws and returns them with a 2 slot combine bag and sends you after sonic wolf molars and hints that they come from the pups. These drop off any sonic wolf in Hollowshade, but are MUCH more frequent off of Pups. Once you have combined the 2 molars, return the Sack to Kaam who will give you some Reinforced Claw Mounts. He tells you to use them with the tomes sold by Qua and that you will need a stretching dowel. Qua is right next door to Kaam with 2 other Librarians. You get the Stretching dowel from Jhimis. Jhimis wants 2 small owlbearclaws and your Apprentice cloak. the small owlbear claws drop off Owlbear cubs( green and light blue to a 20th beastlord. as a 16 beastlord, i got about 1 in 20 or so continous kills. if you can find the cub behind the fort (and to the east a little bit) you can kill alot very fast because his respawn is about 10 seconds hehe) in Holloshade Moor. After turning the owlbear claws and your cloak into Jhimis he gives you a stretching dowel that looks like a spool of thread. <P>Your going to have to work with the 4 other classes of the Vah shir to get your weapons...BL's make the Lashings.<BR>To make the Toughened Sinew Lashings you need to combine the following in your tailoring kit:<P>Toughened Sinew Lashings<BR>Owlbear Tendons (off Owlbears)<BR>Sonic Wolf Tendons (of Sonic Wolves)<BR>Stretching Dowels (hand in your cloak with 2 young owlbear claws to "his name esapes me")<BR>Kelp Salts (from Moor Tortoises)<BR>Fish Oil Soaked Rags (from a Grimling Fisherman)<BR>(I will post a list of ALL class combines at the end of this since we as a class may need to help the other classes get their quest stuff in order to help ourselves )<P>To get the claws you will need to combine the following into the weapon construction kit that you can buy from Qua:<P>1) Reactive Sealant Soak (shaman)<BR>2) Sonic Wolf Bane (Rogue)<BR>3) Toughened Sinew Lashings (what we make)<BR>4) Ceramic Claw Sleeve Set (Bard)<BR>5) Porous Claws (Warrior)<BR>6) Reinforced Claw mounts ( get from kaam)<P>There is no skill check at this combine part. So if you have the 6 pieces then you have the weapon. (unless you goof it up)<P>What you get Sonic Wolf Bane claws<BR>Primary 10dmg 32 dly +2 dmg to sonic wolves<BR>Secondary 10dmg 32dly +2 dmg to sonic wolves +1 dex +1 str <BR>Give them and your class cloak to Kaam Rahiir and he will give the claws back and give you a new cloak.<P>The cloak you get back is as follows:<P>ac 7<BR>+2str +3 stam +1 wis +10 hps +3% to tailoring<P>Kaam Rahiir says 'These claws are very well crafted! Your work is very impressive. Please take them to Ahom Guzhin. He is an old friend of mine. The sonic wolf claws were the result of some of his original studies in the moor. He has dedicated his life to studying creatures of the moor and can almost always be found there. Be careful when you go looking for him. You've done well here, but dont get careless.

THE FOLLOWING IS BASED ON A WARRIORS VIEW, SO BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU DO FROM HERE ON IN, DONT TELL ME I DIDNT TELL YOU SO):<P>The reward will vary based on the class of the questor.<P>Once you create your Sonic Wolf Bane weapon, you need to bring the weapon to the person that gave you the quest, along with your Apprentice Cloak. Bards return them to Hana Sulm, beastlords return theirs to Kaam Rahiir, rogues return theirs to Elder Taruun Ternq, members of the shaman class return theirs to Jaima Seyel, and warriors return theirs to Khala Dun Kuash.<P>Below is the text from the warrior version of the quest. While the text will vary slightly from class to class, all will be sent to find Ahom Guzhin.<P>Khala Dun Kuash says 'Now ths is a nice dagger! Do you like it better than mine? I thought so. When I was looking in my storeroom for the dagger molds, I found this for you. Here take it and wear it with pride... you're now officially a Khala Dun Journeyman! Pretty exciting surprise, eh? I thought so! No, you need to take the cloak to Ahom Guzhin. He'll meet you in the moor. He's always in the moor. Bye friend!<P>Kuash will give you back the dagger, along with a new cloak, which is your Khala Dun Journeyman's Cloak. (Other classes will receive their class-specific Journeyman's Cloak. Stats are not available at this time)<P>It's at this point that the quest was stalled for quite a long time. Despite Kuash's assurances that Ahom Guzhin is always in the Moor, he was apparently removed when the Hollowshade War was turned off. He appeared back in the game on March 7, and it seems he disappeared again about a week later, as the Hollowshade War was very buggy.<P>It also appears that while the quests for each Vah Shir class were different up to the creation of the Sonic Wolf Bane weapon, once that weapon has been created the quest is the same for each class, but the rewards are different. In any case, bring your Journeyman's Cloak to Ahom Guzhin, who is found inside the tunnel from Hollowshade Moor to Grimling Forest (if he's in the game that is).<P>You say, 'Hail, Ahom Guzhin'<BR>Ahom Guzhin says 'Please do not think poorly of me, but I must see your Journeyman's cloak if you wish to converse. Be quick about it. This place is not completely safe. '<P>Hand him your Journeyman's Cloak...<P>Ahom Guzhin says 'Ah, there it is... I haven't seen one of those in a while. I remember when I first became a journeyman myself. That was many seasons and twice as many trails ago. Time becomes most deft in the period just after you figure that you've got a grasp on it. '<P>Ahom Guzhin says 'Well, let us get back to pebbles and tax, shall we? You displayed a great deal of bravery in coming out here and looking for me. I fear my age is beginning to show. I can't evade danger as I did in my youth. With that in mind, I would like you to take this journal back to town for me. Historian Sharar will tend to my notes for me. She is a trusted friend and a valuable scholar. Please give it to her with my thanks. '<P>He will hand you a journal to take to Historian Sharar, who is outside the Palace in Shar Vahl.<P>You say, 'Hail, Historian Sharar'<BR>Historian Sharar says 'It is a pleasure to meet you, friend. Please let me know if you have trouble finding the book that you seek. If you request something that we do not have available, I can make a note to keep an eye out for it. We are getting in a great variety of interesting new material these days. Speaking of which, I need someone to take a tome to Elder Animist Dumul. He has been frantically researching something or another. I'm sure that you could pry a little and learn more about it if you were to take this book to him. Is that something that you would be interested in doing? '<P>Hand him the journal that you got from Ahom Guzhin.<P>Historian Sharar says 'I see that you've found the codger. He really should settle down and come in from the weather. I often find myself worrying about him these days. Adventure takes its toll on everyone. I'd like to see him settle down before the moor takes a final toll from him. '<BR>Historian Sharar says 'Well, I can't say that it isn't a pleasure to have his journal. He's documented the moor with such splendid detail. I cannot wait to see what he's written in these last few seasons. It is all so very helpful. Just take a look at these earplugs. They are a product of his last set of notes. He came up with the idea, while hunting owlbear in the moor. They are supposed to keep the sound they make from harming you. You can keep them, if you take this note to General Avilah for me. '<P>Historian Sharer hands you an Earring of the Owlbear, and a note to take to General Avilah. The Earring of the Owlbear is a NO DROP earring with no stats, and a right click effect of Immunity to Owlbear Screech (helpful to those who have to kill them, ugh i hate that spell). Take the note to General Avilah...<P>You say, 'Hail, General Avilah'<BR>General Avilah says 'Thank you for delivering this. While I have you here, perhaps you can help. We are in dire need of assistance in the moor. All of the reports from our Taruun are indicating the same thing. The area has to be swept clear of the factions that currently inhabit it. The land itself seems defendable, we need someone to gather some soldiers and clear the area. '<BR>General Avilah says 'If you accomplish this mission for us, I will be able to reward you for your actions in this leadership role. You will need only to return this box to me to collect your reward and promotion. It will need to contain a grimling chieftain staff, an owlbear guardian talon, a sonic wolf guardian fang, and your Journeyman's Cloak. Good luck too you, should you elect to accept this challenge. '<BR>You gain experience!!<P>General Avilah gives you a 4 slot box in which to collect the needed items. Each of the needed items drops rarely from grimlings, owlbears, and sonic wolves in Hollowshade Moor. They are all Magic, Lore, and No Drop (note that these items may not be dropping unless the Hollowshade War is working). Once you have all three items, place them in the box along with your Journeyman's cloak, and hit combine. Take the combined box back to General Avilah.<P>General Avilah says 'You have proven to be a great leader and excellent soldier. Please accept this cloak as a symbol of your accomplishment. We would be proud to have you as a member of our ranks. You can choose to stay within the ranks of your sect or you can work with us was a member of the Shar Vahl Garrison. If you wish to continue your work as a member of the garrison, please take this form, sign it in triplicate and give it to Captain Darznel. Either way, please stand still, while I offer you our formal salutation. '<BR>General Avilah shouts 'Ahem... Citizens of Shar Vahl, Attention! It is my duty and honor as commander of the Shar Vahl Garrison to thank Tnar for their fine work. Give 'em your complete respect and salute 'em when you see them in passing. We enjoy our freedom, because of brave citizens like Tnar. Thank you for your time... Carry on! '<P>General Avilah will hand you a form to take to Captain Darznel, along with your new Garrison Cloak. The new cloak is called a Khala Dun Garrison Cloak, and it is AC 9, Str +6, Dex +4, Sta +4, Agi +2, HP +30, with +3% to Blacksmithing skill. Congratulations! (This is the WARRIORreward, details not available for the rewards for other classes.)<P>Now it's time to trek back to Grimling Forest and hand the form to Captain Darznel...<P>You say, 'Hail, Captain Darznel'<BR>Captain Darznel says 'Well met, friend. May I be of assistance? '<P>Hand him the form you got from General Avilah...<P>Captain Darznel says 'Let's see, yes... yes... It looks like you signed everything in the correct spot. That can only mean that you're not only brave, but you have some wits as well. If you have all of your teeth and can stand on one leg until the count of five, I think we can make use of you. '<BR>Captain Darznel says 'Take this Polished Acrylia Sphere and give it to Scout Husman. He's been leading raiding parties against the grunt camps. Adventurers are great, but we need a real soldier to assist him this time. Perhaps we will get better results with your help. '<BR>Captain Darznel says 'After you complete that raid, please go with Scouts Danarin and Derrin. Once you secure those camps, bring me any grimling intelligence reports or documents that you may have found. Place the documents and your Garrison cloak in this bag and bring them back to me. Complete this task and you may even get a promotion. '<P>Captain Darznel will hand you a 4 slot box, and a Polished Acrylia Sphere. You will need to complete the raids given by each scout, and loot the Captured Grimling Documents that each officer drops. They will appear as Captured Grimling Documents I, II, and III. Be sure to also loot the body part dropped by the officer and hand it back to the scout, so you will have the medals that you will need for the next part.<P>Once you have completed the three raids (bring friends - it can be tough to keep the scout alive), place the three Captured Grimling Documents in the box, along with your Garrison Cloak, and hit combine. Hand the combined box back to Captain Darznel.<P>Captain Darznel says 'This documentation is a great start. Judging by the amount of material here, we'll be able to formulate a new battle within the week. It shouldn't take our linguists too long to decipher this scribble. '<BR>Captain Darznel says 'I cannot help but think that your presence and leadership are what made those missions such wonderful successes. I have been authorized to give you a field promotion for your valor and bravery in combat. You're ability to lead was the keystone in the success of those engagements. Welcome to the rank of Garrison Officer, Tnar! '<BR>Captain Darznel says 'We can celebrate your promotion when we make it back to the rear. Right now, I need you to lead another set of missions into the grunt occupied territory. Speak to Captain Necin and show him the Soldier's chest that you've filled with the medals that you earned from the first set of raids. He will direct you through the next several mission. Once you have completed the missions, combine the Medallion of the Hero of Shar Vahl and your Officer's cloak in this Satchel. Take the Locked Satchel to Sergeant Cursah. He will assist you from that point forward. '<P>Captain Darznel will hand you a 2 slot container, and your new Garrison Officer cloak! The new cloak is called Khala Dun Officer's Cloak, and it's stats are AC 12, Str +10, Dex +8, Sta +8, Int +3, Agi +5, HP +50, with +3% to Blacksmithing. Like all the other cloaks it is LORE and NO DROP, useable only by Vah Shir Warriors. Congratulations! (Again, this is the WARRIOR reward, details are not available for the other class rewards.)<P>Ok, this is ALL the known stuff BEFORE Ahom was taken out, and knowing vernant, they probaly changed it, so again, dont yell at me for not warning you. feel free to copy this as you please for your own message boards.<P>-Sources<BR>Heartsfire01 (good descriptions)<BR>EverQuest Traders Corner<P>--------------------<P>Gaoes Lifegiver 55 cleric<P>Gaoe Crachor 50 ench<P>Dark Nightshade-<BR>Innoruuk<P><BR>I am Kung Fu Master.<BR>I like to be in control of myself.
