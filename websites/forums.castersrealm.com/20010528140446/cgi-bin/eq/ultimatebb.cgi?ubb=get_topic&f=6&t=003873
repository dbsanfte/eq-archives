This is a petition.  A petition that verant actually fix and improve the mage class, as they havent been fixed or improved since beta (I played a mage in beta 3).<P>Many of you on the tribunal server, prexus, lanys tvyl, rallos zek, and test might have talked to me, as for the last 2 weeks I have been spending quite a bit of EQ time going around to these servers (chosen randomly, except for tribunal which I play on) to discuss the problems with fellow mages and see if all mages were agreed on them.  Thus far I have a list of over 40 mages who have heard in depth all of which I will outline in this message, and all 40 mages were in complete agreement with the problems at hand.  Only 2 mages out of the 45+ that I talked to had any dispute about any of the problems - not all of them - but merely one or two.  I would also like to take this chance to appologize to all of the mages I have bothered in-game about this, as most people dont log on to have some stranger start talking to them about thier class for 10 minutes while they should be helping thier group kill monsters.<P>I will first outline the problems as both I and the mages I've talked to see them, and will then post proposed solutions below by problem #.<P>Problem 1 - wandering mages, sitting ducks...<BR>This is one of the biggest problems with mages, both in combat (soloing especially), and in travelling (which is half of the game).  The problem is quite simple - a mage gets aggrod on by a monster: 1) he has a pet to defend himself, in which the pet can eventually taunt the monster off of the mage so the mage can either help his pet kill the monster or he can get a head start running to zone -OR- 2) he has no pet to defend himself, in which case he also has no way to get the monster off of him, and so he dies.  This is a huge problem, mages are the ONLY class that have no means to evade a monster that is aggrod on them while they are perhaps just running through a zone, or fighting a monster that just WILL NOT taunt onto his/her pet.  Necros have snare (darkness), root at 34, shadow step, and feign death - by all means a good necro should never die.  Enchanters have root, stuns, mezmerize, memory wipes, charms...the list goes on...enchanters are the best at getting an aggrod monster off of them, whether it be when travelling through a zone or in a fight gone bad.  Wizards have snare and root, starting at lvl 4 - this is thier bread and butter, they also have stuns, so wizards are by all means quite capable of travelling anywhere without risk and ensuring that they can get away from a monster if they end up in a fight gone bad.  Dictating whether or not you should stay and fight/die or run and live is half of the game, so it is a big deal.  However for mages, we do not have that choice, we stay and die, end of story.<P>Problem 2 - conjuration masters: but, but, I can summon you lots of toilet paper!<BR>This problem has arisen from the fact that mage summon spells havent changed since beta, and all the equipment in norrath certainly HAS.  In beta, when a tank was on a corpse run, he might ask me for 2 swords of runes so that he might fight off anything that aggros him along the way.  Back then, this weapon was quite adequate, it still isnt as good as fine steel, and although it is the mages best summoned weapon, it is still good enough to give to a person in need (heck, a rusty sword is better then nothing, right?).  Mage weapons are useless, we only summon them for necro pets and recently our own pets (mages pets used to be unable to wield weapons), and still, they are only summoned to make our pets look "neater"...they dont actually help them much, if at all (I have seen absolutely no difference, so I will continue to believe, until I see some actual implemented code, that weapons do not do a single thing but make the pet look different).  Mages can summon food, drink, bandages at 4, a useless pouch at 8, infravision stone at 16 (until then, erudites and humans, you are blind), water breathing stone at 24, more food and drink at 24, ultravision stone at 29, finally a ring that gives us levitation at 39, and a modulating rod at 44.  Not exactly masters of conjuration if you ask me: we are the only caster class that is unable to enhance vision until 16, the items we summon give us effects that should be available at half the lvl in which we recieve them (who needs levitate at 39? at 20 it would be useful, at 39 its just something more we can summon for newbies who dont even thank us).  Also, I just outlined everything a mage can summon...that isnt much you say, and no, its not...the infravision and ultravision stones are useful only to erudite or human mages, the water breathing stone is mostly unused, the levitation ring at the level which we recieve it is not even useful anymore, bandages are good, food and drink is good to have, those pouches are useless - too small and you cant even put most items into them, and the modulating rod...well, better thought of then it actually is.<P>Problem 3 - how do you kill monsters with a mage again?<BR>This has been a problem since beta, however it wasnt as much of a problem back then, as the rest of the classes hadnt been so highly enhanced and improved yet, and the monsters hadnt been tuned up and buffed.  Back in beta, a mage was actually a foe to reckon with.  Our pets were almost on par with necro pets, our DD spells were sufficient, our AE spells were nice to have (although unusable now), and at least half of the items we summoned were actually useful.  Sadly, this game is all about hack and slash, thats all there is to this game, and although verant has implemented this hack and slash ideollogy (sp?) in a manner which it is much more entertaining then the normal diablo clone, it is still hack and slash.  If your class doesnt have sufficient means to dispatch monsters with, then your class is useless...I could care less if you can cast clarity, sow, all the buffs in the game, heals, etc....if you cannot kill monsters solo your class is group dependant and thus you can no longer just log on and play the game, you must log on and try to find a group before your time runs out and you have to log off.  A mage has 1 way to kill monsters.  Direct damage spells and his/her pet.  That is all we have.  Now, our DD spells are supposedly second only to wizard...this is untrue during most of the game (lvl 1 to 60).  We also have a few AE spells.  However, AE spells only get us killed, and so they are useless (and mana inefficient to begin with).<BR>So, the first issue with this problem is mage pets.  Mage pets, every single one of them, can be easily taken out by a necro pet of same level.  Throw into this equation the mage pet being buffed by the mage burnout, fire shielded by the mage fire shield, and given the best weapon the mage has: the necro pet will still win.  I have tried this duel every lvl of the game, as I have previously played a lvl 50 mage along with a lvl 50 necro all the way to 50.  I have also tried pretty much every pet at every level (I had to do some of the duels for lvl 24 through 44 pets when I was in fact 50 and could actually research the pets we could not buy).  Mages should summon the most fearsome pets on norrath, we are afterall CONJURATION MASTERS, are we not?  Mage pets should be bar-none able to out-tank, out-damage, and out-taunt any other pet of the same level in the game.  Our pets should have more HP, more armor class (our pets get hit for max damage by mobs of same level as them), more attack rating, more strength/dexterity so that they hit harder, land more of thier hits, and can actually take some damage.  Mage's pet's spells (root, gust of air, burst of fire, slash of ice) are also more of a burden then a good thing, as they resist 99% of the time, they require the pet to sacrifice a round of combat (where they could be missing the target in melee instead), and they cause the pet to stand still and allow the monster chasing us to get ahead of them (most solo fights invole the mage running from the monster, and the pet trying to keep up hitting it from behind trying to taunt it).  I do think that pet's spells were a good idea, however they were not implemented correctly.  If verant wishes to keep this good idea of thiers, they should at least FIX it.  Make pet's spells unresistable to monsters up to 8 levels above the pet (ie: halfway to our next spell lvl, white monsters cannot resist our pet's spells).  Also, do not make our pets sacrifice a round of combat to cast the spell, implement it as a proc (with a very high proc rate) instead to allow them to continue hitting (otherwise, for example, our earth pet sits there and casts root 6 times in a row and every time it resists, which accomplished absolutely nothing except make the monster hate the mage more since the pet isnt taunting or doing damage).  Pet's spells in fact do not do much, the root obviously does some good (allowing the mage to flee), and the gust of air obviously does some good (it stuns the monster, ie: allowing the mage to flee), but they resist so much that I would much rather not have them at all the way it is right now.<BR>The next issue with this problem is mage DD and AE - our only other asset besides our weak little pets.  Mage DD spells are NOT second only to wizard.  Mage DD spells are only a few points higher then necro DD spells, they are sometimes even less then enchanter DD spells, and even druids have a higher DD then mages for half of the game (ie: 1 through 50).  Mage DD and AE spells SHOULD be second only to wizard, EVERY level of the game, WITHOUT question whatsoever.  That doesnt mean that we should do 1 MORE point of damage then the necro, enchanter, and druid spells of any specific level, it means we should do 20, 50, 80 points LESS then the wizard spell of that specific level.  Mage DDs at level 29 for example, 176 damage, versus necro DD at 24, 160 damage.  We should be doing about 200 DD at level 29, more in line with the wizard's DD of 250 at that level.  We still arent as mana efficient - by far, and we still dont do as much damage, and we still cant cast our DDs as fast - this keeps wizards out in the front by far in direct damage (especially with wizard spells being less resistable).<BR>Also, our AE spells should be pumped up a bit.  The way I see it, although wizard SHOULD be the master of dealing damage in anyway spellwise, mages are tuned for AE spells.  We throw rains of fire down over our pets wreaking havoc on the monsters he is taunting away from us - that is what a mage should be like - that is what verant says a mage is - that is very very far from the truth.<BR>Our malise line of spells, it should have the same resistance check as tashan, it is the same kind of spell, and the shamans have been petitioning this for almost a year now.<P>######################################<BR>Proposed solutions<BR>######################################<BR>Problem 1 - wandering mages, sitting ducks...<BR>Mages are masters of conjuration and masters of the elements.  Our post lvl 50 class names are even "Elementalist" and "Conjurer" so if verant even disputes this, they have proven how mentally ill they are.  Snare and root come straight from the earth element.  We should have both of these spells.  We should have single target root, single target snare, AE root, and AE snare.  Mages should have these spells starting at either lvl 4 or 8 and they should correspond to about the same level that any other class gets the spells.  This would give us a way to evade monsters, a way to be more helpful to our group, and it would actually finally give mages what they were meant to have - mastery of the element: earth.<P>Problem 2 - conjuration masters: but, but, I can summon you lots of toilet paper!<BR>I already know that verant has admitted to this problem, so I wont go into too much detail as I have faith in thier abilities, and hope they have already come up with some solutions.  Basically it is simple, every weapon a mage summons is useless at the level he/she is able to summon it.  Back when there were level 40s wielding well-balanced and fine steel weapons, and that was normal and "good" equipment for thier level, mage weapons were not all that bad.  However, now, they are rusty short swords.  The items a mage summons are also useless and very limited.  We should be able to summon items that give us any desired effect in the game.  I would even go so far as to say we should be able to summon sow rocks (1 charge stones alike that of the water breathing stone that click to give us sow equivalent to [(our level) - (level we recieved sow rock)].  For example if we recieved the sow rock spell at 20, at lvl 20 we would summon a lvl 1 sow rock spell (equivalent to lvl 9 shaman sow).  We are also the only class that has no means to regenerate mana faster.  We are the ONLY caster class that just has to sit and meditate every point of our mana the hard way.  This should not be so, especially since our DDs are mana inefficient, and our summons cost a huge amount.  We should be able to summon a "breeze fan" at level 20 (4 levels after enchanter breeze), and a "clarity rod" at level 34 (5 levels after enchanter clarity).  These items would be one charge items, alike all other mage summoned items, that will give the appropriate and corresponding level of a "breeze" and "clarity" type spell.  This will hopefully negate the hard fact that mages have the longest downtime of any caster.  Now, I realize you are all perhaps thinking I am crazy to think that mages should recieve sow.  However, think about this, what do mages have that one of the 3 other caster classes dont?  We can summon food and drink...thats about it.  We should be able to conjure items that give us any desired effect we want, why not give our class something unique? Actually give us what was promised?  Its definitely not something mages dont deserve, afterall, it falls completely in line with what our profession is, so why not actually fix our class?<P>Problem 3 - how do you kill monsters with a mage again?<BR>Mage pets should be the best pets in norrath.  That is our calling, to be able to summon beings of great power to do our bidding.  We are not enchanters that merely animate inanimate objects, we are not necromancers that reanimte dead corpses or control the essence of bones, we summon actual beings from the planes of the elements.  They have names, they have personalities, they are our friends and companions.  Mage pets should have much higher AC, mage pets should NOT get hit for the same amount of damage as the mage him/herself gets hit for.  Mage pets should have more HP, as a mage, your heal pet spell is one spell that MUST be memorized AT ALL TIMES, otherwise your pet dies and there goes another summon stone (and usually a bit of exp too, since you die next).  Pet healing spell should be for emergencies, it shouldnt be a neccessity.  Right now I am playing a level 30 mage, and to even try and solo low blues/high greens I have to heal my pet at least twice or it WILL die.  The process of a fight with mage solo right now usually goes like this: burnout on pet, fire shield on pet, malise or nuke moster to pull, send pet on it, run around in circles until pet can taunt monster, sit and med for 10 sec, heal pet, nuke, heal pet, sit and med for 10 sec, nuke, heal pet, nuke, by now mana is all gone, so I either die or I am victorious with at the most 20% mana left and a pet that has at the very most 40% of his life.  Then I sit and meditate and go grocery shopping or run some errands, because it takes that long to meditate back to full, and without full mana you cannot solo monsters that give anything near good experience, especially since mage has such a high experience penalty.  In groups where our pets arent the tanks, we dont have this problem too often, but we are still not very useful in a group.  Personally I would rather have a necro, enchanter, wiz, druid, shaman, or just another good tank in my group then another mage.  We are weak, and we are mostly useless.<P><BR>And this was one heck of a long post...so my parting words will be that if you are a fellow mage, help our petition out, because I know you know the burdensome task we have at just being able to play.  It is a game, we pay for it, this should not be the case.<BR>Also, if you are a mage and think differently about anything written here, please voice your oppinion.  The above stated problems are only problems in the eyes of myself and the mages I have talked to.  The more ideas and oppinions we get, the better overall solution will be.<P>Conjour Mastarre, gnomish level 34 mage, fenin ro, beta - deceased<BR>Malaan Ktok N'Maar, dark elf level 24 mage, bristlebane - deceased<BR>Nezar N`Amun, erudite level 50 mage, erollisi marr - deceased<BR>Dor'egal N`Amun, erudite level 30 mage, the tribunal - going into retirement

Man, I feel for you, but I really don't see where you're coming from.<P>I hit 49 this last Sunday, and I've been feeling pretty omnipotent.  I go to OOT and on one load of mana I kill 2 SF cycs and Gornit (just for the extra $$).  My pet usually ends the fight with 30 or 40% of his health left too.  On the same Sunday, I also got Jboots =).<P>I see your highest was 50, so you have had to had similar experiences, even if you're a poor player, and I don't believe anyone could be that poor.<P>Granted, we lose some of our shine past 50, and people don't want to group with us due to ancient stereotypes, but prove them wrong, do it yourself and stand back and go, "HA!".<P>Remember, it's a game, treat it as such.  If you don't like playing a mage, play something else, if you don't like anything else, quit and buy a new game.  Who cares if EQ is the only MMORPG of its type on the market, you don't have to play.  If the only candy bars on the planet tasted like cat turds, would you have to eat them?<P>Ken,<BR>49th Newborn Mage<BR>It feels like a new game.

Funny - I've duelled necros before and their pets DEFINATELY do NOT beat our pets - at any level until L52 (where the 50+ firepet sucks ass).<P>Now, I can agree with the summoning stuff...I even somewhat agree with the "we don't have any way to defend ourselves without a pet" - the answer is easy - get a sow so you can run faster than the monsters in most zones, or b, as soon as you zone in, summon a pet - it's only 5 silver....<P>M

Sorry, after about the fifth thing you said that was incorrect about the mage class, i stopped reading...<P>1) If I'm not with a pet to protect me, I'm traveling.  If I'm traveling, I'm invis, Sow'ed, and lev'ing...For some reason, as much as mage's complain about it..I NEVER feel as if I'm going to die constantly when traveling.../shrug I guess you just have to know where to travel.<P>2) Learn what your summons do before you bash them.  How can you say you don't use levitation? summoned bags? dagger of symbols (which you forgot)? throwing weapons? arrows? and on and on... Jeez..The first thing I do when i log in is summon Gift of Xev, Coldstone (i'm a erudite), and 3-4 lev rings.  I'm constantly asked by others for food, water, bandages, arrows, throwing knives, lev rings, waterstones....and I use most of them too.  And now with the research that AC items help our pets..some of these other summons are beginning to really make a nice difference.<P>3) too many errors to list.."AE spells will just get you killed" is my favorite.  This is a grouping game, if you don't like to group, quit, buy diablo and be happy.  I also like "our DD's are only slightly better than necro's and enchanters have better than us"...ROFL..you have to be joking. Do you ever look at things like mana ratio, casting time, recast time, taunt factor, sv type...lol..amazing.<P>I've got a proposed solution for ya.  Play another class, cause after your 4 attempts at mages, you still obviously don't understand this class.  <P>Sorry this comes off as harsh, but I'm just a little tired of reading winers lately.<P>Irrani Izwhoot<BR>55 Mage of Innoruuk<BR>GM of Storm

Sorry to say it man, but I gotta agree with everybody else.<BR>I mean I'm not perfect...I have screwed up royally with my mage before...but I can also do some "magic" with him.  With that said, some of the problems you seem to have can only be explained by the sad conclusion that you're not very good at playing a mage..sorry.  <P>1.) root...snare? Honestly that is what our pets are for, and if you're not casting a pet for protection at each zone then you should at least make sure you have sow up, levitate, and an invis.<BR>2.) Was this the pet one? Well if so, all I can say is you're wrong...dead wrong.  A 49 earth pet with BOIII and Shield of Lava will absolutely spank a 49 necro pet, and probably would still beat him without a DS.  A 49 fire pet would be absolutely no competion, and if you're doing full comparisson on which one is better given the buffs the owner can use...were you equiping your pets with swords of runes.  Do you remember that little proc that goes off on now only summoned things...guess what his pet is summoned and that would tear him up.  You're just wrong. Post the logs of the fights to prove it complete with con messages, then you might have some validity.<P>3.) It really all depends on what you expected out your summons.  I wanted stuff that would make me more self-sufficient cause I initially wanted to solo alot..which i did and enjoyed it.  (I group alot more now)  We could use more, but some of the ones we have, you have to look at the benefits.  Our improved sight summons never wear off, so unless you go linkdead, once one is summoned you never have to recast.  "No other caster" can claim that. Some of our other items like waterstone and lev rings are right clickable effects which can not be interrupted.  That can come in handy when you're running from a nasty and need to get off a quick lev to make the escape a little easier.<P>I love my class.  If you were to send me a tell in game I would say, "yeah you have some good points, but I think im fine the way I am....I like the challenge  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">"<BR>And inside I would be thinking, "I'm getting so sick of these whining fools, go start a rogue or monk and leave me alone"<P>Hehe, I have a rogue twink  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"><BR><P>------------------<BR>Tomlyn Drayke<BR>Lvl 49 Mage<BR>Prexus<P>"But whosoever should cross that line, into true corruption,into our domain....One day you will look behind you and you will see We Three, and on that day, YOU WILL REAP IT!" ---"Boondock Saints"

playing a mage to 58 i have to agree with some of he says<P>i personly think they need to make pets more wanted in group. befor rok pets were wanted(necro pets but mages pets were welcomed soon as they got dw). now with the huge Melee upgrades and the downgrade to pets past 50, pets are not wanted like they use to be.(put it this way, who whould you want more in a group or raid, a tank or a mage...nuff said)<BR>and  mages should be 2nd best dders. Wtf do necros nuke for the same damage as a mage at 34 and a freaking priest class outnuking mages at non dd upgrade levels and past 50.<P>

I'm a level 52 mage. I like my mage and after playing lots of other classes (granted... not to a very high level) my Mage is my favorite. <P>I have but one request for a change really. (I could cite other requests, but they all seem to pale in comparison to this one..)<P>Without nerfing our pets, remove the requirement that we must outdamage them in order to get full exp for a kill. we have no root, we have no snare, we have no real means of escape (other than our pets... which I'm getting to..). The reasoning is simply this:<P>My pet is both my armor and my weapon. I live and die by my pet. If I summon a sword and melee something do I have to outdamage the sword in order to get exp? Does a warrior have to somehow outdamage his weapon to get exp? Without my pet I am NOT an efficient damage dealer (I'm talking primarily solo here since that's where the damage penalty actually comes into play.) Remove the damage penalty and I do NOT think we've unbalanced anything. <P>Perilbane Mooncaster<BR>Mage of the 52nd Circle<P>PS... oh yeah... and why the hell did I put all that effort into research only to find that after 50 I can't research ANY of my spells?<P>

I think the disgruntled old mage is definately showing signs of age. Primarily, age has caused forgetfullness. Every improvement and change in the last 1 1/2 years seems to have been forgotten.<P>I've died once due to a traveling accident in the last 3 months....it was the DL dragon (Gore-whatever). Like snare/root would have helped there heh? This magician need for root/snare is fantasy, learn to travel intelligently.

I have to agree with Disgruntled completely here.  Just a few tweaks would help even out our class substantially.<P>1.  Our melee ability is somewhat lacking.  In a melee duel, I was soundly trounced by a ranger.  We should have slightly better melee than them, and we should gain access to at least all of their weapons.<P>2.  Bring our hitpoints up to the level of say, Troll warriors.  This would give us the time to make it to the zone should we be STUPID enough to be travelling without invis, lev, or any other protection (ie those "pet" things I keep hearing about).<P>3.  Our summoned weapons should be procing complete heal, ice comet, or some other useful spell.  I mean, them being free isn't NEARLY enough.<P>Sigh... Disgruntled old mage needs to spend some time playing another class, and seeing how tough they have it.  And we're supposed to be one of the SMARTER classes.... sheesh!<P>/rant<P>Grunngy

Hmm, while Mages could certainly use some tweaking, things are definitely NOT as bad as the original poster said.<P>Maybe Verant should make a plate armor wearing, dual weilding, double attacking, fear kiting, clarity casting, sow casting, backstabbing, healing, tracking class, with both elemental and undead pets.  Then we can all be the same.  Wouldn't that be fun?  /sarcasm off<P>Shiri

ok my 2cp<P>I actually read that whole mess and the only thing i agree with is we should have more summons but not the ones you mentioned.<P>Honestly if your not casting a pet every zone or traveling invisi whats the deal?  Especially post 34 when you get summon monster for free?  I hit that guy every zone and if something agros he beats it down while run.  this will be even more effective in one bub when i get summon companion (39).  run away safely bring pet heheh <P>We DON'T need root/snare/sow/ice comet/or dragonslaying spell of destruction.  We are one of the most powerful classes up to 50 and post 44 we especially rock.  My dds work fine for the baddies i face and my AE spells are useful now since pets don't count.<P>Speaking of pets, i gotta ask what you're smoking.  My pets kick necro pets ass everytime.  ANY PET.  Fire pet is just hilarious to watch, never seen a skelly go down so fast.  Earth pet is great soooooo many hps the skelly has no chance.  hilarious watching an air pet stun one and beat it down.  Water pet chews through them just about as quick.  Hell, even my Monster Summon 1 which is a random cast can ususally take a similar level skelly and that is unfocused hehe, what are you talking about?<P>We rock, end of story.  Sure we have limits, and they seem huge but they are necessary.  If we had root and snare can you imagine the power?<P>Situation:<BR>YTM con at 39.<BR>Fire pet attack lvl 39 so about 35pt damage shield innate.<BR>me root mob<BR>pet attacks and gets beat on.<BR>nuke nuke nuke sorry baddy you can't get me i rooted you.<BR>Heal pet as needed and laugh at baddy.<P>Get out of here. there is no way VI would do this and it would make the game far to easy to be any fun.<P>Your pets are already a get out of jail free card.  summon one every zone.  Ask pullers how useless they think your arrows are. or your tanks and clerics how useless the coldstone is.  It ain't glamorous but its a living.  Make friends with druids, get sowed when you need it, help them when they need it.  You picked the most versatile class in the game DUE TO OUR PETS.  If you don't have a pet up every minute of your play time, thats your own fault.  Mages are Pet masters, despite your misguided rant(u dont seem to be using them right) thats what we do, and why we have four of them (well 5 with MS).  you should learn proper game mechanics and function then repost this.<P>I'll ding 39 today.  This is my second char on the same server.  I only started playing in November.  something to remember for the game and RL, it ain't the quantity of knowledge that counts but the quality.  Even with all your characters, you still don't know how to play a mage right evidently.  I haven't died in about 15 levels except for my own stupidity.  We Rock end of story end of rant answer.<P>------------------<BR>Balas, Battle Mage of Tor.<P>---May your heel always hit rock before your helm.

Magicians are in need of some major tweaking.<P>But not in the line of what the original poster asked for.

First of all, I am a very new mage (lvl 11)  and I have been doing some reaseach.  Ok, I agree with the digruntled old mage when he says we need more sumoning spells.  Face it, food  WAHOO!!  Go buy some.  Some of the items coming up are pretty neat thugh.  For the weapons he totally has the money.  Only, weapons DO affect your pet, i have done experments.  Upon discoveing this i concluded WE NEED BETTER WEAPONS!  I also agree that we do NOT need root.  If you want a god class, start a frekin druid.  However, there is one thing that bothers me, which no body touched.  Only one skill poin in reasearch?  Comon, I am no lvl 5904 mage, but I do know that MUST be an inconvenience, espically stacked with alll the other drabacks held aginst us.  Well, I feel better.<P>Dragnorr  lvl 11 mage of doom BWAHAHAHA!!!!

Man... to the original poster:<P>Umm last time you logged your Mage on was what?  2 years ago in beta 4?<P>/rant on<P>Dude you are TOTALLY clueless and pretty much everything you said was either mostly wrong or completely wrong.  Not a good track record so far as a post goes.  I can ONLY assume you  took that long to lvl all of those different chars up on all those different servers.  Play a mage to 55 or 60 THEN you wont NEED to ask what is wrong with the class!<P>1. Our pets stink post 50.  Pre 50 they are the best there are... PERIOD!  Fix = 1/4 more hp at each lvl post 50 than they currently have and raise skill cap on them to lvl 55 warrior skill caps.  Damage is fine but fix the damn skill cap. Oh and the fire pets post 50... *cough* just delete the damn things or fix them *cough*.<P>2. Our spells STINK because you can't make them stick on anything over about lvl 52 or 53.  Fix the the resist rates or give us an unresistable LINE of DD starting at 39.  These should be based on the shard spells.. Who the HELL ever heard of a mob resisting a rain of spikes!!!  That ought to be MELEE damage not freaking MAGIC damage!  It's a freaking SUMMONS for Gods sake!<P>3. Summons... Move all the crappy summons we have now down about 20/30 levels and they will be about right (cake and ale at 51!!! WTF is that!?!?!).  Then give us some GOOD PROCING mob type specific summons and some NICE BUFF summons (even if only self and pet) and call it even.<P>4. On the summon sow stuff... get a grip. Play a drood or a shammy if you want sow.  Go camp Jboots like every other half witted Mage did (like me).  <P>5. On the Root/Snare... I am okay with the Root/AOE Root thing because I DO agree that works with our class.. the snare.. well it doesn't so I would say no on that one because it doesn't fit the Mage class model. <P>People... on the mage class discussion I saw all KINDS of stupid suggestions (new pet skins is a good example with NO utility at all).  No wonder Alan COMPLETELY ignored everything that was said in there.  Why is it that the least thoughtful people always post the stupid ideas and drown out the really intelligent ones?  I don't care about cool LOOKING stuff I want good damage spells a great pet and great summons that all provide something grouped or ungrouped... Raid or not a raid.  For God's sakes, stop filling up threads with absolute crap will ya!<P>/rant off<P>Belgerion<BR>55 Mage (semi-retired)<BR>Master of Nothing but Coth

What some call 'enhancements' aren't really anything but a revert after a nerf. If I remember correctly, the old old mage pets were very tough, or so I've heard. Then they nerfed them. Then they gave them Spells, which in some cases 'nerfed' them since the spells have a sort of post-casting time on them. Then they gave them duel wield, but slowed the pets attack rate. While I don't know exactly how much they changed the delay, it could very well mean that our pets getting Dual wield did absolutely nothing as far as effectiveness. I still haven't seen any evidence one way or another on this. <P>------------------<BR>Is the phrase "I know" just "I think" with delusions of grandeur?<P>Zebanar B.

Every class has its drawbacks. Some classes are worse than others. Mages drawbacks are minimal. Most people who are complaining about the class seem to just not know how to play a mage correctly. Are there some minor tweaks that could help the mage class? Yes. However, you can't take away reasonable disadvantages from the class and still have playing the character fun.<P>Someone falls off a bridge and dies - uh, lev ring would have solved that problem.<P>We don't get SoW - uh, camp jboots.<P>We get invis so most mobs won't see us when we travel. Before I got my giant faction up I ran through Kael invis so I would not agro. I did not have to worry like clerics and warriors that sit at the zone waiting for someone to come by and invis them so they can travel through.<P>Yes, it would be nice to have more summons. However, I use mod rods, lev rings, and coldstones on a daily basis. There are situations where sword of runes, dispel staffs, MR/PR/DR daggers, and waterstones are needed. CoH summons other players. Pets are summoned. Yes, half our summons are worthless, but the ones we have that are not worthless are worth a hell of a lot more than toilet paper. Somehow I think you would complain bitterly if they took away the good ones that you already have.<P>Oh, and speaking of pets...that is how Mages kill MOBs. Our nukes are OK, but are not our primary form of damage. I can solo mobs just dandy when I want to. And using the correct pet in the correct situation in a group makes it so that you can do things with a group that you normally couldn't.<P>Obviously you have no clue how to use AEs, or you would not call them useless.<P>Obviously you do not know how play a mage well. Obviously you have never played a crappy class or you would realize how great Mages are.<P>Tepid<BR>Level 56 Mage<BR>Mith Marr<P>

Let me first say that I feel the pain of the original poster. ALthough he has made some untrue remarks in my opinion he is not entirely off base.<P>In my opinion:<P>Mages need some sort of defense....The pet sow spells come in handy but they need to be lower level maybe off a vendor or research only. Or a in zone quick cast gate.. or a 2 sec cast time pet with appropriate stats that will allow the mage to flee, zone or gate.. ROOT and or SNARE is not what we need. leave that to the druids <P>PETS : IMHO since Verant made pets that are equal to Player Characters we have become less effective against Kunark and SoV mobs and in raids. Lvl 54-60 Pet spells summon a creature 10+ levels lower than the mob..... This combo makes pets not hit for max or even hit at all (run your log to test this) so in large battle mages are not that powerful. Posible solution: make the pets like an unarmed warrior/monk/wiz/rogue of equal level of the spell. Before you get all crazy saying no way in hell think of a naked warrior against a SoV mob<P>Summonings post 50: That suck...enough said<BR>Fix the mage bags so things dont poof when LD...<BR>To the poster that said arrows shurikens, food drink bandages etc etc etc....the new SoV armor makes that line of spells USELESS, many many times I say need arrows NO MY ARMOR SUMMONS THEM, SHURIKENS ..NO MY ARMOR SUMMONS, Food Drink DITTO DITTO DITTO... /em sit back and drink the summoned beer <cheers> I am master conjurer BAH !<P>I would not ask for more DD or a new line of spells but perhaps group spells would be very very very nice. And fix our pets yeah they do more than other classes pets but then again shouldnt they ? < FYI pre pet NPC to PC change my 51 earth beat a lvl 53 warrior in Full planes gear with no weapons or DMG shield, NOW 58 Earth that was burnout3, DMG shielded (cadaceau 33pt)at LOST to a lvl 53 Warrior........... Yeah right no nerf.....<P><BR>

(Since my post ran ut of proportions my suggestions is at the bottom, rest of the text is explanations and motivations mostly. Oh and much whining of course wouldnt want to miss out on that. How come all that matters in these questions and stuff is lvl 40+ is everything below that well balanced?? doesnt feel like it to a non twinked char in any case. Oh well here the post starts)<P>Playing a soon to be 23 mage (two blue bubs left) and when I hit 24 I will probably change character to something that doesnt take me three years to research spells to.<P>Donwloaded the research spell list and it seems that I am gonna hunt forever to get all the things I need to make the spells..<P>Where is the info of this in game btw?<BR>It seems only way to play this game is to get guides from the net. Bougth a grimoire and some other books. Open them up gibberish  and null in them readable.. Oki probably have to learn some language, that i can take. <P>Uhmmm just like what language? <P>Couldnt one get some hints as to which language I am after to learn?<BR>(as like I have trained in old erudian, could'nt it say the text looks like old erudian)<BR>Bougth the book on languages, got some clues that it was old erudian I wanted to learn. Asked alittle around and you get languages by speaking them in a group. Where do I find a person to learn me old erudian then???<P>Sold all the books and went to download the list from the net instead.<BR>Next problem.. <BR>Spell components that I havent heard about and travells all around the world to get them.<BR>I am not sure I want to know how many failures I am gonna get on the way either. Using up hard fought components.<P>As of now my biggest concern is how to move from one point to another. Invis helps but cant count the times I have died from undeads that see thru it and "smack" me dead.<BR>Go aorund you say, sure but the lag that amost always is there since I only have 512k/s connection makes it kind of hard..  See the ghoul, running big circle round ghoul, ghould wasnt standing there he was going another direction and cuts my path or something like it..<P>A thougth here is to give mages a "invis all" spell at lvl 16? undead and usual invis, would help a lot without making us "to migthy". Which I guess is the reason we cant fear or root or snare or some other spell.<P>Uhm levitate btw my friend plays a shaman and he got it at lvl 9 ?? <BR>I get it at 39? A little lower maybe wouldnt hurt...?<P>To the lev, invis and sow'ed traveller there..<BR>Uhm just how much wouldnt that cost me?<BR>A sow i can bum now and then but it most of the times costs me money. I always go invis since I got it.<BR>Levitate? uhm yes but the 39 lvls before I get it then?<P>Why do I have area effect spells btw? If I use them grouped I get a whole bunch of mean mobs trying to beat me to death, same thing with soloing. I havent got sow so i get beat to death trying to outrun a mob. Only thing i use them for is to cast when a grouping goes to hell and I need to aggro some mob of the healer or another caster who's life is falling rapidly so that he can beat me instead, giving more time for the tanks to hopefully taunt him of me. These kamikaze acts are getting rare though since I loose to much exp on this. (usually die from this trying to help)<P>Have to agree that the pets spells is to easy resisted or have to short hold on them, talking about root here mostly. It never says anything about if the water pet gives any dmg.<BR>I just hope it does.. :-))<P>I am just thankful that the mage isle in OOT wasnt guarded by spectres which would have figured, but by a cyclops that didnt see invis people.<P>Then its this matter with the summoned food and stuff, i zone i get disconnected loggin in and starting to summon food again to replace all that I lost not forgetting the heatstone since i am erudian.<BR>Nowadays I just go and buy food and water since i can at least play when i get in and only have to summon the heatstone before going out in the game.<P>Couldnt mages get to keep when ld'ing what they have summoned for themselfs? Summoning is btw quite useless, it isnt like it is asked for by anyone. More then by my friend who also is a newbie.<BR>I try advertise my knowings in my groups. Anyone want bandage, food, drink, arrows, daggers, heatstone?<BR>In one tenth of my groups I get to make anything more then heatstones for the few human players. (the few that has not been twinked with various armour and stuff that is)<P>Would be fun if I could summon something useful that people wanted. CR weapons and food is the only thing i seem to be worth.<BR>Oh I forgot bandages to raise ones skill in bind wounds. Since my bandages are cheaper then the ones you buy.<BR>I actually got paid for arrows once though, I wouldnt have asked for money since I was glad just to be able to actually help someone with my spells and skills, but he paid of free will.<P><BR>I like the idea of mages but since I dont have any spells to make me money or to trade for other usefull spells. (see sow, tp, clarity, heal) <BR>Anyone seen a /shout trading fire shield for clarity ?? didnt think so. <P>I think I am done with this class.<P>At least until I can lvl some other character up to twink and pay for my spells with this one.<BR>All money I get during lvling is gone as soon as I get to buy my new spells. How do people afford all the armor and stuff they are running all over the place with?<BR>Only cool thing I have gotten so far is a elemental binder which I bougth for 75pp. Hope I wasnt ripped of on it.<P><BR>Metelaze magician 22 (soon RIP)<BR>Cazic-Thule<P><BR>**(suggestions)<P>Couldnt one get some hints as to which language I am after to learn?<BR>(as like I have trained in old erudian, could'nt it say the text looks like old erudian) But still be gibberish to read but I could at least now what language to search for.<P><BR>A thougth here is to give mages a "invis all" spell at lvl 16? undead and usual invis, would help a lot without making us "to migthy".

i didnt read this thread, but ive read a thousand like it. <P>mages have lost their luster, im sorry to all those diehards that wont admit it. <P>the class was my first and i played him for over 1.8years and seen him involve from a  killing machine to a LFG gimp.<P>i have played my char to the max, i found myself nuking less and less, concentrating on debuffs, mod rods, suiciding/resummoning pets.<P>i never signed on to be a utility player w/o enough utility spells, i signed on to be a dmg dealer, therefore this mage has been retired 53 levels strong.<P>as far as im concerned this game isnt about who can do what and who can do that. it was about fun, when peeps started going lfg for and hour with no luck it is time to admit there is a problem. <P>i suggest any 50+ mage to head to seb 10 times. go lfg and see if you get a group. id go out on a limb and say you'd get a group 3 of the 10 times, after 2 hours of lfging.<P>i dont care how VI decides to fix that, but thats the prob, not if snare, self clarity, etc will unbalance the game. the game is already unbalanced to the core.<P>just let us have some fun. let us all have some groups, when that happens for all classes then the game is balanced.<P><BR>

Post 50 mages are a major liability in a group.  It's a class that is not balanced, live with it or move on.  Pre 50 I loved my mage but realized he could no longer compete with the big boys.  He was my only character. I now have a monk and a mage both 58.  My Monk makes short work of any mage but I still play my mage because I ENJOY it. It's a game folks!  If you are looking to feel like a God there are lots of rats in Freeport to kill.  Have at 'em.

I remeber playing aD&D and being a summoner..it was cool to summone different stuff..not just eliementals, monsters, or weapons...but other things like giant swarms of flies or a horse or a ball of light that would float at my sholder. Perhaps our class could get more imaginative about our summons. different thing would add coler to the class...maybe even some things that would be wanted by others, like....a shield that has a fire shield on it and would burn enything trying to beat on the user..and that dmg shield and AC would get higher as the mages level would increase. Or perhaps a 'bandage of marr' that would heal 50% more hp with the bind wound skill...this is just my thoughts..i read things on boards and watch others play (yadda yadda yadda) and i think to my self on what i would do to make the class more fun. oh well...thats my two coppers worth.

Well.... The only ONE thing that i think mages need (and i know many that will agree with me) is Group friendly ...anythings.<P>   Pets are not group friendly, UNLESS, you can control your pets, but this is a tough task indeed for how much our pets our worth in Kunark situations and especially velious.<P>Example:<P>Sebilis Juggernaut Raid:  im a 55 magician, was asked to join a 2 group juggernaut raid (going all the way past the reet knights into Trakanon's room).  Tell me, why do you think they asked me to join the raid?.. for Damage dealing?.. for my "awsome BALANCED" pets?.. no.. it was for CoH.  They knew that, and i knew that.  This is our only real group friendly spell in Kunark/velious.. its an amazing spell, dont get me wrong, but its the only thing anyone thinks of when they think of 55 + magicians.. not the pets.. not the DDs.<P>   As many of you may know.. to get to the Juggs, you have to be constantly on the move, killing level 53+ Mobs left and right, and a lot of times getting multiples, and once you get multiples, you alwasy have Enchanters Mezzing/rooting.  <P>Mage, stands around, dmg shielding tanks.. has no pet because he was on the move and pathing dis allows the use of pets. not only pathing but the fact the pets will break mezzed mobs as well, and this can be a life or death situation if it happens.  So the little that we have left, which i actually found useful, is Malosi.  I always was casting Malosi on every Shroom that we pulled to make it much easier for the Enchanters to mez.  This is funny because before 50.. we did all the Damage (A lot of it done by the pets), now im just helping the enchanters mez mobs so that the tanks can do all the damage.<P>   Our role in these situations has changed completely.  i dont think i had casted one nuke on any mob on the way down to Traks lair.. not one.  Its pretty ridiculous to waste 175, or 399 mana to cast Scars of sigil or sirocco (which is highly resisted.. especially against 53 + mobs wtf its almost useless unless you solo mobs that are under 50.. then it usually works great) and 450 dmg is next to nothing compared to what both groups are doing.. especially the Warriors and monks.. <P>   level 59 monk outdamaged my entire group, we had a mage pet, necro pet, a wizard and i think a shaman.. ... we were all casting like mad as well, (also hard nuking at the end in case there still is the hate dmg list.) And the monk still got some of the kills.. <P>(sorry if im confusing, i tend to ramble in no particular order)<P>   Anyways.. to sum up what ive had to say, <P>1) We need to be more Group friendly.. i dont care How you do it (verant) just do it.. i like to group, hard to find a group for anything else but CoH. *shrug*<P>2) Maybe post 55, our pets should doing a lot more dmg than you have set them?, i know this would cause an unbalance in Pre-kunark/velious dungeons, but i dont think it would hurt.  Especially since we now would want to group in the new dungeons, our pets MIGHT be a little more effective.  Or maybe give us a new spell line that will make us more group friendly, that makes us a necessity other than CoH (see how i stress this). some kind of lure?... (i know i know, stepping on wizards toes).. or make our AoE Rain spells a LOT less resisted.. so we can actually deal some real damage.. even with sirocco (max dmg 1890, which is an AWSOME, dmg / mana ratio) on these new mobs we are just dealing nothing ( 100k hps.. 2000 hps isnt going to do much).. and take into consideration that we DO run out of mana, and on these new mobs we are useless.. once we run out of mana, we are utterly completely useless, but to stand around and maybe Tank a melee round to save a Warrior, or someone much more needed.<P>3) pet control.. i like the /pet no attack idea.. do it.  (although i already dont have much problems with handling my pets, it is an annoyance to me when my pet switches targets or beats on mezzed mobs every once in a while.) <P><BR>Deminn Rhys (used to be Nass but offended the GMs *sigh*)<BR>55 Conjurer<BR>Tarew Marr<P><BR>

What you said is TOTAL BS!!! mage pets are 3X as good as necro pets!!! summon bandages, well, at lvl 20 I have maxed out my skill and can help the healers save mana. IMHO, I think mages deal out the most damage out of any classs in norrath, and I think the most brutal group ever would be 6 mages. SO DID YOU BUY YOUR CHARACTER ON EBAY??? OR ARE YOU JUST RETARDED??

I am really wondering about the disgrunteled old mage here.  The only (somewhat) relevent point I think he has is about the usefulness of our summoned items.  Other than that, I would only agree with the fact that our 50+ pets suck hard.  Granted, I am only level 25 and don't play as often as I would like to, I have heard from more than just 40 mages that the problems originally posted were not the problems to be addressing.  Correct me if I'm wrong but the Earth pets are modeled after warriors, water after rouge, air after monk, and fire after wizard right.  The only thing good about these pets that I've heard is that the water pet can backstab.  Well, thats great for the water pet!  I want to know how much earth pets attack for and get hit for, I want to know how much overall damage output an air pet has, I want to know how good the fire pets blast is (it IS modeled after a wizard afterall).  From what I hear most mages complain about, these are the major problems with our class.  I just hope they make the class desireable post 50 by the time I get there.
