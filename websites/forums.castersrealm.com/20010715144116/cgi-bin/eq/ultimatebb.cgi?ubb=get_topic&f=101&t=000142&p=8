[QUOTE]Originally posted by Daimyo Wildfyre:<BR><STRONG>Here's the bottom line. The way raids work, not every class can be useful. </STRONG><P>Depends on what you fight just like anything else.  Sometimes you had better have a few pet classes with you when you go to raid.  Sometimes you better have a massive doter on hand.  Sometimes you had better have crowd control, other times you better have a fierce damage shield.  More often than not you had better have an fd puller.  <P>This is just common sense.  You generalized too much when saying on raids.  The point is there is no, we had better have a paladin type raid.  <P><STRONG>On a raid, all that matters is dealing damage and healing damage. That's really it.</STRONG><P>That is BASICALLY what it comes down to, but what is the formula for this?  What makes it so that healing and dealing damage is most efficient? <P><STRONG>Crowd control doesn't matter, buffs don't make a huge difference except for resist-type buffs, and utility means dick.</STRONG><P>Never lead a raid.  EVER!  You have no idea how silly you sound.  Yes on some raids Crowd control is near impossible but other raids it is a pure necessity.  Utility buffs mean nothing?  *LOLOL*  Your main tank is dead in two hits then and when the mobs are through with him who do they go after next?<P><STRONG> All that matters is killing the bad guy as fast as possible witgh as few casualties as possible.</STRONG><P>Hate to tell you this but if you aren't using the buffs and pets and such 9 times out of 10 (if you even kill the mob) you are most certainly not killing the guy as fast as possible and you certainly are having plenty of casualties.<P><STRONG> And that means Warriors, rogues, wizards, and clerics.</STRONG><P>You named the MOST useful but to say that others never have a use in a big raid is just plain silly.  Their argument is not the same and never should ever be thought of in remotely the same way.<P>  <IMG SRC="mad.gif" border="0">   <IMG SRC="mad.gif" border="0"> RageFactor Co.   <IMG SRC="mad.gif" border="0">   <IMG SRC="mad.gif" border="0">

I have crit'ed for 1301 with a 50/60 piercer. That's not a negligable amount of damage, by any means.<P>The point, however, si the frequency with which these hits occur. Assuming I have 255 DEX (buffed with shammy stuff and some DEX gear for the purposes of testing), I land a crit about every 30 normal strikes of a weapon. Percentage-wise, we're talking less than 5% of my total hits, and less than maybe 7% of my total damage comes from crits. THIS is why I call them eye candy--they make a big difference in single fights, but in the grand scheme of things they don't really add much to my damage during, say, a 5 hour period. Don't get me wrong, I LIKE crits.

Man, maybe your warrior has some bad luck with crits because my roomate crits a lot and very hard and if e turns that disc on, well...<P>Anyways, our LoH and HT can only be used once every 90 mins and will full heal a single target for roughly 3000k at the most on average when talking about max hp.<P>Your crits are terrible fierce and when you go beserk it gets worse and if you use the disc which recycles every 75 mins(decreases after a few levels) and allows you to do insane amounts of damage exceeding 3000k and you say LoH is better?  HT is better?  *LOL*<P>I'm sorry but I would trade my warrior in if this held true.<P>Even with my disc against undead I noticed that a warrior still out crit me on an UNDEAD mob.  My supposed specialty and he crit more than me with no disc and with my disc on.  <P>Every 30 swings you say?  More like every 22-25 but we'll say 30.  How long does it take for you to swing 30 times?  With haste?  With shissar? Wearing haste items?  Duel wielding?<P>Do you know what I do every 30 swings?  swing again, no matter what I fight.  Spells you say?  Clerics are always there so technically my usefullness there is neutralized.  What am I left with?  A weaker defense because the AC on my items being lower than a warriors and a mediocre fighting ability because my weaps are weaker and so am I.<P>Whoever you are basically saying that other classes have the same right to complain as us: <P>===>lake<P>  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" border="0">

[QUOTE]Originally posted by RageFactor:<BR><STRONG>[QUOTE]Originally posted by Daimyo Wildfyre:<BR>[qb]Here's the bottom line. The way raids work, not every class can be useful. </STRONG><P>"Depends on what you fight just like anything else.  Sometimes you had better have a few pet classes with you when you go to raid.  Sometimes you better have a massive doter on hand.  Sometimes you had better have crowd control, other times you better have a fierce damage shield.  More often than not you had better have an fd puller."  <P>Ever been on a raid Rage? High lvl raids are all about efficiency... This dosen't mean that paladins and mages can't get into a raid but if the slot could be filled by a Warrior or Wizard and one is available, in almost every circumstance they will get invited to go before you... You still are usefull on a raid because every little bit counts...Oh, and you will never see a pet on a raid. As Daimyo the wise stated (who has been on a few raids in his time, I mean he is lvl 60 is he not?) pet's get people killed on raids, One of the reasons mage's and necro's are almost worthless on plane raids... Crowd control isn't that necissary because if the puller gets a few add's there are more than enough groups there to take care of them. <P>"This is just common sense.  You generalized too much when saying on raids.  The point is there is no, we had better have a paladin type raid."  <P>Of course there isn't... Never will be... Raids are about efficiency... Best tanks, healers, dd and melee dmg  dealers are the most efficient at their tasks... Because of this they are more needed.<P><STRONG>On a raid, all that matters is dealing damage and healing damage. That's really it.</STRONG><P>"That is BASICALLY what it comes down to, but what is the formula for this?  What makes it so that healing and dealing damage is most efficient?" <P>A group on any dragon raid should have at least 1 Cleric in the group and 1 backup healer. The rest of the slots are filled in with pure melee second and anything else the organizer could get s/he hands on third.<P><STRONG>Crowd control doesn't matter, buffs don't make a huge difference except for resist-type buffs, and utility means dick.</STRONG><P>"Never lead a raid.  EVER!  You have no idea how silly you sound.  Yes on some raids Crowd control is near impossible but other raids it is a pure necessity.  Utility buffs mean nothing?  *LOLOL*  Your main tank is dead in two hits then and when the mobs are through with him who do they go after next?"<P>Sure every bit helps. Its always good to have a few necro's to cast DMF on the party when doing naggy to avoid the lava but thats just about all you need in terms of utility spells on a naggy raid... About crowd control? I already said something about that... On large raids there are enough groups to deal with the add's the puller gets.<P><STRONG> All that matters is killing the bad guy as fast as possible witgh as few casualties as possible.</STRONG><P>"Hate to tell you this but if you aren't using the buffs and pets and such 9 times out of 10 (if you even kill the mob) you are most certainly not killing the guy as fast as possible and you certainly are having plenty of casualties."<P>There are always a few casualties on a raid... Can't be avoided. But there would be a hell of alot more casualties if someone allowed a mage or necro to summon a pet on a raid. Buffs help but not that much when your tanks dont last more than a few seconds against the mob without defensive disc.<P><STRONG> And that means Warriors, rogues, wizards, and clerics.</STRONG><P>"You named the MOST useful but to say that others never have a use in a big raid is just plain silly.  Their argument is not the same and never should ever be thought of in remotely the same way."<P>Effeciency... Warriors, Rogues, Wizards, Clerics are the most efficient at their tasks... Everyone else is CannonFodder(Which is a large part of the raid, you always need warm bodies there to keep mob from hitting the main dmg dealers and healers in the fight)

From my experience I crit about every 60 hits... Daimyo's 30 is quite above average and criting every 25 hits is almost unheard of.... Hell I wish I could crit every 25 hits... Then I would look at them as more than eye candy... For most of the warrior community crits are just morale boosters that pick you up when your feeling left out on all the cool spells or abilities other classes get to use...

Druids...best frieds on raids...can we say evac?<P>Hmmm.  Ive never been evac'd on a raid.  Raids can have up to 10 groups going at a time (that is a little much, but it happens).  If things go bad on a raid you don't evac, cause breaking in is the hardest part on any raid.  Usually you camp a couple of clerics and the rest go down in a blaze of glory  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>D's quote about the only really needed classes on raids are warriors, clerics, rogues (are nice), and wizards is for the most part correct.  (Although I probably would have thrown monk in there as well for pulling  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"> )  He is just right, there isn't much use for anything else.  Utility is nice to have, but not needed (trust me, I feel this the most as I am the king of useless utility spells)  EVERYTHING ELSE IS JUST ICING.  Basically it boils down to the fact that there aren't enough warriors, wizards, clerics, and rogues to make up the full needs of a raid every time, so others have to fill in.  Its how the game is designed, and I hope it changes with Luclin, but I'm not holding my breath.<P>--------------------<P>Tomlyn Drayke-Lvl 55 Conjurer<BR>Fallken Stallken-Lvl 25 Rogue<BR>Prexus<P>"He knows the guy with the bandages around his ass ain't goin nowhere.

Have anyone of the people saying "Everyone else is just icing" ever raided anything other than your refrigerator at home?<P>Listen for a minute.  I'll tell you this just so that you know.  Not every raid is the same.  You named the base people, the ones that you will always need but that does not change which others you may end up needing depending upon the places you raid and who you are raiding.<P>You will NEED the ablities of other classes given the mob you are dealing with.  Those you have mentioned are just the base formula as to what you will almost always need but their part alone is never enough for dealing with everything that exists.

[/i]</B><P>Glad you quoted me here because it is just common sense. <P><STRONG>Best tanks, healers, dd and melee dmg  dealers are the most efficient at their tasks... Because of this they are more needed.</STRONG><P>Do you fight everything in the game the exact same way?  If you do you're stupid but I don't think you are so I say to you why is that?  EFFICIENCY.  You named the BASE of success for a raid now you add the part that must be adapted.  The adaption portion is part of the efficiency.  You may have all those you named but do you have a heavy dmg shield?  Do you have a high fire resistance caster to compensate for the 1500 dmg AE?  <P>Don't tell me that those elements are all you need ever.  That is what you are saying and I'm telling you that is completely wrong.  <P><STRONG>Sure every bit helps. Its always good to have a few necro's to cast DMF on the party when doing naggy to avoid the lava but thats just about all you need in terms of utility spells on a naggy raid...</STRONG><P>Again you are focusing on one type of raid and I am talking about all types and including grouping.  Your argument is non existant for this reason. <P><STRONG>About crowd control? I already said something about that... On large raids there are enough groups to deal with the add's the puller gets.</STRONG><P>I said something about this too and it had something to do with depending upon the raid adds without crowd control will spell death.<P><BR><STRONG>There are always a few casualties on a raid... Can't be avoided. But there would be a hell of alot more casualties if someone allowed a mage or necro to summon a pet on a raid. Buffs help but not that much when your tanks dont last more than a few seconds against the mob without defensive disc.</STRONG><P>Going from 3000k hit points to 5000k hit points is going to help a great deal.  Having a fire resist of 100 rather than 30 is going to help a great deal against AE fire.  Having your meleers hasted and stred and raising there attacks matters because you are doing that much more damage faster.  <P>True every raid has casualties but depending upon what buffs you have against certain mobs it could mean the difference between everyone dying, some people dying, or the mob dying or the mob living.  <P>So tell me, what was your point here again?<P><STRONG>Everyone else is CannonFodder(Which is a large part of the raid, you always need warm bodies there to keep mob from hitting the main dmg dealers and healers in the fight)</STRONG><P>I hope you only stay to leading dragon raids if you have ever led any(I doubt this considering what you said about the buffs and given that before a dragon raid they set up buffing stations but that's because they only make a little difference right?) because you would get us all killed.  <P>We don't NEED anyone but the warriors, clerics, enchanters, and monks.  *LOLOL*  Lead a raid or two and then get back to me.<P>  <IMG SRC="mad.gif" border="0">   <IMG SRC="mad.gif" border="0"> RageFactor Co.  <IMG SRC="mad.gif" border="0">   <IMG SRC="mad.gif" border="0"> <P>Later,<BR>  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" border="0">

can we say FEAR RAID? break groups always eveac out, ALWAYS go in kill or train away EVAC out, then moveon in again, why let everyone die in there, WASTE OF TIME. if you didnt evac these raids would take all day. About warriors crits, does anyone care? when you said 5 to 7 % of damage, i didnt now you ment OVERALL, i thought ya ment ONE fight, at 1 bubble. problem solved, <P>Loh is every 72 not 90.<P>Druids are second best blasters in game, 1012 DD ice/fire spells, i cant think of any other class with a DD of that caliber, necro's have dots, shamans, also have dots, that exceed that amount, but druids can use a 1300 dot and a 900 dot, stacked ( breath of ro) and (winged death). so that about 2000+ damage there then blasting for 1000 a shot, it's pretty strong. druids are the MOST versitile class in the game. they have a little everything ( no tanking of course ), and they can always find a way to be useful. Certains mobs render tanks useless. such as the city of mist fire lord guy, 2000 ae fire spell. kills of tanks like hell, so get a ton of mages with fire pets in there.<P>Every class helps out, and in groups it's balanced nicely, but raid wise. it would be nice for paladins to be brought along as something more than a pickup class ( to grab the nodrop armor ), sk's can be used because of FD. rangers have track, helpful to pull. paladins need some sort of thing to make them more useful. not to make them some uber class that off sets groups, i mean a RAID oriented skill that HELPS others, and will make others want to bring us along. that is my main problem here, not warriors or rangers or sk's or who does what damage.<P>I've come along way from the guy that complained about EVERY aspect, and i thank that to the majority of these posts, and from playing my paladin more, ( and playing my ranger friend, who i personally found totally useless to the group, other than doing some damage)  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"><P>--------------------<P>-PsychoSimatic-<BR>-Garethec Swordbreaker-<BR>-Bertoxxulous-

Jesus, where do I start.<P>Rage: We are talking about a couple of different things, so let me clarify what I meant by my earlier statements.<P>By "Raid," I mean the real, full-scale fight against the BOSS MOB. I mean the guild who's fought their way up Velk's lab, and is prepping for the fight with the big boy himself. I mean the guild who's planning to kill Trakanon in 15 minutes. I mean the guild who broke into Sleepers and means to have a go at Kerafyrm.<P>On these raids, there are two things that matter.<BR>1. Killing the bad guy.<BR>2. Keeping as many good guys alive.<P>To do this, we need a few things.<BR>1. Damage Source--warriors, rogues, monks, wizards<BR>2. Healer source--clerics, sometime shamans, druids<BR>3. Utility--Buffs from chanters, shamans, druids; Crowd control; DMF (for naggy); other case-specific buffs.<P>Line by line:<BR>"Druids can't do any damage? Since when? They get nukes plus they have resist buffs and THAT is what will save your life. "<BR>**Druid nukes don't land on uber mobs. Generally speaking, druids don't get to nuke on raids, since they're usually placed as a primary healer in a caster group. They heal and they buff. That's it.**<P>"Most mobs that are incredible hard to kill are mobs with a dangerous AE of some kind and resistance is what saves you from it. "<BR>**Druids aren't the only class that come with nice resist buffs. Clerics have decent ones as well--and person by person, a cleric is a lot more useful and important than a druid is.**<P>"Your argument was an isolated incidence, I am talking about a paladins entire career. "<BR>**My argument was that paladins aren't especially useful on raids. No doubt. This does not mean that paladins are useless in day-to-day groups. Paladins make superb secondary tanks, along with Shadowknights. Whether they make good enough tanks is a topic for another thread. Who's talking about an isolated incident?**<P>"Depends on what you fight just like anything else. Sometimes you had better have a few pet classes with you when you go to raid. Sometimes you better have a massive doter on hand. Sometimes you had better have crowd control, other times you better have a fierce damage shield. More often than not you had better have an fd puller. "<BR>**Unfortunately, pet classes are usually not a good thing. I can think of no true uber raid where pets are necessary, and a number where pets get the whole raid party killed. Massive DoTs are OUTLAWED on raids because in the past they have caused corpses to poof. Therefore, they are not allowed, even though VI claims to have fixed the problem. Crowd control is often useful, no doubt. But it isn't crucial to the epic fight against the BOSS MOB itself.**<P>"The point is there is no, we had better have a paladin type raid. "<BR>**There is no "we better have a _insert_the_following_ type raid, either: <BR>1. Shadowknight.<BR>2. Druid.<BR>3. Necromancer.<BR>4. Ranger.<BR>5. Magician.<BR>6. Rogue.<BR>7. Shaman.<P>The point is, the only classes that are UNIVERSALLY necessary on raids are warriors and clerics. Wizards are usually useful, as are monks for pulling. Only a VERY FEW CLASSES ARE ESSENTIAL FOR A RAID. And granted, paladins aren't one of them. There is a difference between essential and useful. All classes are useful, some are less useful than others.**<P>"Never lead a raid. EVER! You have no idea how silly you sound. Yes on some raids Crowd control is near impossible but other raids it is a pure necessity. Utility buffs mean nothing? *LOLOL* Your main tank is dead in two hits then and when the mobs are through with him who do they go after next?"<BR>**I led the first raid into Sleeper's on Fennin. I led the first raid into VP. I led the first raids on Naggy and Vox. I have led more raids than you have likely been on. On some raids, CC is important, agreed--but at the actual moment of the BOSS MOB fight, it is worthless. By "Utility," I mean what hybrids, druids, shamans, and others have have--utility in their ability to perform many different tasks with some degree of profiency, but not as well as the pure class can. Raids are always about efficency, and that means having the job done by the class made to do that job.**<P>"Hate to tell you this but if you aren't using the buffs and pets and such 9 times out of 10 (if you even kill the mob) you are most certainly not killing the guy as fast as possible and you certainly are having plenty of casualties."<BR>**You use a pet against Yelinak, Kerafyrm, Zlandicar, Klandicar, Dracoliche, or any of the other viciously powerful dragons that are running around in Norrath right now, the raid can get destroyed. A feared pet in PoF is the most dangerous thing you can have. A feared pet in ToV is even worse. A feared pet in Necropolis isn't real good, either.<BR>I am also aware that resist buffs are good. When did I ever say that resist buffs were useless?**<P>"You named the MOST useful but to say that others never have a use in a big raid is just plain silly. Their argument is not the same and never should ever be thought of in remotely the same way."<BR>**Isn't that exactly what YOU are arguing? hat paladins never have a use on a big raid? Neither do SK's, Rangers, Necromancers, and others. What I said was, raids demand efficiency. Hybrids are not efficient, they are not the best at what they do. Druids, similarly, are not the best at anything they do--except possibly resist buffing.**<P>"Aren't as powerful? Man, maybe your warrior has some bad luck with crits because my roomate crits a lot and very hard and if e turns that disc on, well..."<BR>**A big part of LH and HT is the fact that they are triggered. I can't guarantee that if I'm fighting and NEED that crit to survive, it'll happen. Nine times out of ten, it doesn't. LoH works as soon as you need it to. Harm Touch likewise. Yeah, my crits probably end up adding more damage than Harm Touch does. So what? I'm supposed to do melee damage. The SK's spells and pet combined easily overcome any advantage I have from crits. Any warrior that uses the crit discipline on a raid should be SHOT. Defensive is the absolute necessity on any raid.<P>"Every 30 swings you say? More like every 22-25 but we'll say 30"<BR>**30 was generous. Let's say 45.**<P>"Do you know what I do every 30 swings? swing again, no matter what I fight. Spells you say? Clerics are always there so technically my usefullness there is neutralized. What am I left with? A weaker defense because the AC on my items being lower than a warriors and a mediocre fighting ability because my weaps are weaker and so am I."<BR>**Clerics negate only your buffs. You can still heal yourself and others--just cuz the cleric does it better doesn't invalidate your own ability. You have access to weapons that are every bit as spectacular as a warriors'. The primal 2handers out of Sleeper's are a perfect example. The fact that you cannot duel wield simply means you do slightly less damage, which is at it should be.**<P>"Listen for a minute. I'll tell you this just so that you know. Not every raid is the same. "<BR>**Very true. But most raids require a certain small core of classes that changes very little. I can't think of any raid where a necro, SK, Pally, rogue, Druid, Magician, Bard is an absolute necessity. Obviously they make it easier. But they are not required for the raid to be a success. Clerics and warriors, usually monks and enchanters as well, often wizards--they are the absolute and only necessities.**<P>"What about to save the mana of main healers? Shamans and druids have the same amount of mana and their heals are very close. "<BR>**Shaman and druid heals don't hold a candle to clerics, especially on tanks. CH is the absolute most powerful weapon (figuratively speaking) in a healer's arsenal. Shamans and druids don't have CH.**<P>"I also ask that you never lead an important raid ever."<BR>**Refer to the above.**<P>"The point is that there are circumstances in which EVERY class(with the exception of the paladin) will be looked for in some situation. "<BR>**Wrong. SK's are never a necessity. Nor are necromancers. Nor are rogues. Nor are druids. Very few classes are REQUIRED in a particular raid situation.**<P>"No, stupid people get people killed, especially stupid people with pets. "<BR>**Stupid or not, a feared pet in Hate, Fear, Necropolis, ToV, or Sleeper's gets the raid killed.**<P>"Actually, adds can be the entire reason why your raid fails. Again depends on various factors. "<BR>**Complete agreement. But when I said crowd control didn't matter, I was referring to the BOSS MOB fight itself.**<P>"Going from 3000k hit points to 5000k hit points is going to help a great deal. Having a fire resist of 100 rather than 30 is going to help a great deal against AE fire. Having your meleers hasted and stred and raising there attacks matters because you are doing that much more damage faster. "<BR>**Already mentioned clerics. We all know HP is good. If ANYONE is ever on a dragon raid I'm leading without the appropriate unbuffed resists at 75, I remove them from the raid. They are a liability in that case, and they don't come.**<P>"can we say FEAR RAID? break groups always eveac out, "<BR>**There are a number of ways to break Fear. That's one of the worst.**<P>"Druids are second best blasters in game, 1012 DD ice/fire spells, i cant think of any other class with a DD of that caliber, "<BR>**Wildfire does 1024 damage. There is no ice-based equivalent of that damage caliber. Mages, at every spell circle up to that one (58, I believe) have better and mroe efficent dd.**<P>These are my thoughts. Respond if you wish.<P>--------------------<P>Do you know pain?<BR>Do you know rage?<BR>Do you know power?<P>Then that is all you need know of me.

Ok to the big mother poster   <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"> , if you have a Uber guild hosting a fear raid, no worries, but im talking your average guild, 1 guild hosts maybe bring some friends. nothing amazing, you cant just send everyone in. or the roamers will rape you badly.<P>Secondly necro's are a MUST on most raids, corpse recoverly with coffins is a wonderful thing. rouges, best damage dealers there are, back stabs for 900ish with epics is definatly something that adds up. druids.... well yeh..... they..... BEAR PETS, thats what they have.. rangers get.... i think... umm feet like cat? paladins, well not much. LOH the cleric, "better pull another pally out of the box, this ones spent," sk's are nice fore scouting around with FD, never know maybe your monk is a paralyzed from the waist down and cant go runnign around... it happens.......<P>the only pets i've noticed that are real bad when it comes to fear and charm are chanters, necro's and shamans ( druids never use theres) for some reason i dont see mage ones gettin it as badly. maybe they have better resists or somthing, not sure. but true when it happens it's just as bad as a normal person, only the pets off on it's own and thats when it gets ugly....<P>But honestly, all classes have some sort of reason to tag along, it would jsut be better if pallies/sk's had a stronger one. ( still like my LOH and HT idea), oh and about LOH and HT being there when you need it... did you know HT gets resisted and LOH fizzles or gets interupted?. i asked GM once, he said LOH is a normal spell, only differnce is takes no mana and you can cast while moving. now THAT is gay. " damn im in trouble >LOH<........... nothing....... >dead<<P>  <IMG SRC="mad.gif" border="0">   <IMG SRC="frown.gif" border="0">   <IMG SRC="confused.gif" border="0"><P>--------------------<P>-PsychoSimatic-<BR>-Garethec Swordbreaker-<BR>-Bertoxxulous-

<B>By "Raid," I mean the real, full-scale fight against the BOSS MOB.</B><P>1.) Who cares what YOU define to be a raid?  A raid is a raid regardless as to how important YOU guage it to be.<P>2.) You are isolating all of this to just raids again. *yawn* I am talking about a person's entire career and last time I checked raiding was not all a person ever did in their life.<P>3.) In light of 2 what dos anything you are saying have to do with any of my complaints?  "Let's try little to nothing for 500"<P><B><BR>1. Killing the bad guy.<BR>2. Keeping as many good guys alive.</B><P>duh! Name one raid where this is not the case.<P><B>To do this, we need a few things.<BR>1. Damage Source--warriors, rogues, monks, wizards<BR>2. Healer source--clerics, sometime shamans, druids<BR>3. Utility--Buffs from chanters, shamans, druids; Crowd control; DMF (for naggy); other case-specific buffs.</B><P>No kidding, I've been saying this uh I don't know--forever.<P><B>Generally speaking, druids don't get to nuke on raids, since they're usually placed as a primary healer in a caster group. They heal and they buff. That's it.**</B><P>1.) Good thing you said generally speaking because again, I can not concur with you as far as experience.<P>2.) Last time I checked being a primary healer and having resist buffs depending on the kind most certainly were a need as far as being the MOST efficient.<P><BR><B>**Druids aren't the only class that come with nice resist buffs.</B><P>Wow.  Did you figure this out all by yourself?<P><B> Clerics have decent ones as well--and person by person, a cleric is a lot more useful and important than a druid is.**</B><P>Umm, efficiency isn't about getting <I>decent</I> resist buffs it is about getting the best hence the word efficiency.  Again a person must ask, "Where were you going with this?" as you were actually supporting my statement as to needing others for MAXIMUM efficiency.<P><BR><B>**My argument was that paladins aren't especially useful on raids. No doubt.</B><P>No kidding, and this is what I said.<P><B> This does not mean that paladins are useless in day-to-day groups.</B><P>Show me the line where I said they were useless and I'll address this.  I'll also show you the lines where I said that NO ONE was useless and yet again this has absolutely nothing to do with my argument.<P><B> Paladins make superb secondary tanks, along with Shadowknights. </B><P>No way.  Shadowknights have two major points of specifity that I can think of right now.  They are sought after for their snare and their ability to FD pull again paladins are sought after for nill which would be my argument that you have yet to address.<P><B>Whether they make good enough tanks is a topic for another thread. </B><P>What you speak of is great for another thread to.  Maybe you should start one?<P><B>Who's talking about an isolated incident?**</B><P>*LOLOL*<P><B><I>By "Raid," I mean the real, full-scale fight against the BOSS MOB.</I></B><P>Well, since that statement does not cover or come close to including every occurence of battle in EQ as a matter of fact if I quoted you further it would even be as to sooo specific(opposite of general and entire) to only include things that Uber guilds do rather than a majority, I'll let you answer your own question given you already did in a way.  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"><P><BR><B>**Unfortunately, pet classes are usually not a good thing. I can think of no true uber raid where pets are necessary, and a number where pets get the whole raid party killed.</B><P>Then those people controlling the pets were poorly trained and sucked badly.  I've been apart of a few successful raids with pets present and even times when the pet was specifically used to carry out a task.<P><B> Massive DoTs are OUTLAWED on raids because in the past they have caused corpses to poof.</B><P>They fixed that and what actually causes mobs to poof is when an npc delivers the most damage to a mob as opposed to a pc and when a person goes LD that is exactly what they become, an npc.  Please do more research.<P><B> Therefore, they are not allowed, even though VI claims to have fixed the problem.</B><P>Please say during your raids.  DoTs are outlawed during YOUR raids.  Please do a raid with only the base classes and try taking down an uber mob and tell me how long it takes and how many of you die.  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"><P><B> Crowd control is often useful, no doubt. But it isn't crucial to the epic fight against the BOSS MOB itself.**</B><P>Nevermind the adds that will wipe out an entire raid. *shrugs*  Have you ever led a totally successful raid?  Have you ever fought super mobs and only had one person die?  Have you ever done any with no casualties and were you the leader and were there no buffs on people and no other class there except the warrior, clerics and wizards?  <P>2.) and again stay of the raid topic as it has no bearing on the argument.  All it shows me is that although there is a possibility that you've attended many raids you certainly do not understand how they work.<P><B>"The point is there is no, we had better have a paladin type raid. "<BR>**There is no "we better have a _insert_the_following_ type raid, either: <BR>1. Shadowknight.<BR>2. Druid.<BR>3. Necromancer.<BR>4. Ranger.<BR>5. Magician.<BR>6. Rogue.<BR>7. Shaman.</B><P>"We had better have a FD puller."<BR>Monk, Shdowknight, Necromancer<P>"With a good deal of rogues and backstab this guy goes down easy"<BR>Rogues<P>"We need our main tank buffed to the max to take all the hits and he'll keep the mob on him."<P>Shaman, Druid, Cleric, bard<P>"Our resistance has to be very high up for this guy or we'll be dead in only a couple secs from the AEs alone"<P>Shaman, Bard, Druid, Cleric<P>"Let the pets tank him down as the first wave and then let the tanks go in and then we nuke him"<P>Magician, Necros, Shadowknights.<P>"Give the tank a damage shield as it will help him keep aggro"<P>Magician, Druid, Bard.<P>"We do not fight this guy without slow"<P>Shaman, Enchanter, Druid(with epic)<P>"Need a snarer or we don't go"<P>Druid, Ranger, Shadowknight, Necro<P>"Make sure there is someone that can call of the hero and another person that can summon corpses, it makes this whole thing go alot faster."<P>Magician, Necros, Shadowknight<P>What were you saying about not needing other for efficiency?  I couldn't here you.<P><B>The point is, the only classes that are UNIVERSALLY necessary on raids are warriors and clerics.</B><P>*points to the word universally* and this is why your argument is just all over the place(or atleast one of them)  I said there were no cases where a paladin is just sought out after just for being a paladin and you are talkign about classes that are needed in just about EVERY raid?  Who said anything about that?  Wasn't me.  )<P><B>Only a VERY FEW CLASSES ARE ESSENTIAL FOR A RAID. </B><P>Depends on raid.  Nuff said<P><B>And granted, paladins aren't one of them. There is a difference between essential and useful. All classes are useful, some are less useful than others.**</B><P>Some raids and some groups, other classes are essential to do something but not paladins hence my argument.<P><B>**I led the first raid into Sleeper's on Fennin. I led the first raid into VP. I led the first raids on Naggy and Vox.</B> <P>Somehow, I just can't believe this given your prior statements.  doesn't matter if I believe you or not, if you did you did if you didn't you didn't but if you did it is sad that you were unable to learn anything from them.<P><B>I have led more raids than you have likely been on. </B><P>*LOL*  I guarantee you haven't even led more raids then I have attended.  <P><B>On some raids, CC is important, agreed--but at the actual moment of the BOSS MOB fight, it is worthless. By "Utility," I mean what hybrids, druids, shamans, and others have have--utility in their ability to perform many different tasks with some degree of profiency, but not as well as the pure class can. </B><P>Name the "pure" class that can dot the best in comparison to all the other classes.  Name the "pure" class that snares the best in comparison to all the other classes.  Name the "pure" classes that can buff resists the best(casted not sung as they satck).  Hmmm.<P><B>Raids are always about efficency, and that means having the job done by the class made to do that job.**</B><P>True true but this works more for my argument rather than yours.<P><BR><B>**You use a pet against Yelinak, Kerafyrm, Zlandicar, Klandicar, Dracoliche, or any of the other viciously powerful dragons that are running around in Norrath right now, the raid can get destroyed. A feared pet in PoF is the most dangerous thing you can have. A feared pet in ToV is even worse. A feared pet in Necropolis isn't real good, either.</B><P>Anyone feared is bad.  Pet or otherwise.  What's your point? and please tell me again how all of teh above named have anything to do with this argument given I was talking about common occurences and most frequently occuring situations given that would make more sense as we are talking about majority of paladins?<P><B>I am also aware that resist buffs are good. When did I ever say that resist buffs were useless?**</B><P>You never said they were useless, but you did say that they were not needed for efficiency and unless you edit your post, I may quote you later on it.<P><B>**Isn't that exactly what YOU are arguing? hat paladins never have a use on a big raid? </B><P>For the 89th time no.  I've been telling you for about 3 posts now that you were off topic and I even explained why and I'm doing it again here.  You don't take hints well do you?<P><B>What I said was, raids demand efficiency. Hybrids are not efficient, they are not the best at what they do. </B><P>Depends on the raid and the hybrid and to get you out of this raid crap it depends on the situation.  People recognize this(well save you anyway) and will seek them out for these reasons.<P><B>Druids, similarly, are not the best at anything they do--except possibly resist buffing.**</B><P>That's good enough apparently because people tend to look for them depending upon various situations.<P><BR><B>**A big part of LH and HT is the fact that they are triggered. </B><P>That disc is triggered.<P><B>I can't guarantee that if I'm fighting and NEED that crit to survive, it'll happen. </B>  <P>Turn disc on.<P><B>Nine times out of ten, it doesn't. LoH works as soon as you need it to. Harm Touch likewise. </B>  and then it is gone for how long.  For the umpteenth time, you swing every 30 times you crit, I swing 30 times on any mob I swing again.  <P><B>Yeah, my crits probably end up adding more damage than Harm Touch does. So what? I'm supposed to do melee damage.</B><P>HT should hurt more than your crit disc.  It is a evilly granted gift from the dieties.<P><B> The SK's spells and pet combined easily overcome any advantage I have from crits. </B><P>Absolutely right and with the necro not being a necesity to groups under many circumstances they are often sought after for their abilities to snare and FD pull.  you know?  Where were you going with this?<P><B>Any warrior that uses the crit discipline on a raid should be SHOT. Defensive is the absolute necessity on any raid.</B><P>Anyone who uses it at the wrong time should be executed but given the proper timing etc mobs will just get ate in secs flat with Disc and wizzies nuking.  <P>I don't just speak from calculations, I speak from being on raids that took less than mins to end and with 0 casualties being a common occurence.  <P>Your warriors or your strategist obviously don't know how to use certain things to their advantage I guess.*shrugs*  <P>"Every 30 swings you say? More like every 22-25 but we'll say 30"<P><B>**30 was generous. Let's say 45.**</B><P>Trade your warrior in guy.<P><B>**Clerics negate only your buffs. You can still heal yourself and others--just cuz the cleric does it better doesn't invalidate your own ability. </B><P>If the clerics are keeping everyone at Full hp what the hell are you healing for?<P><B>You have access to weapons that are every bit as spectacular as a warriors'.</B><P>In what world?  Your weapon goes from being a two hander to two duel wieldable weapons.  Tell me which one of our weapons do this?<P><B> The primal 2handers out of Sleeper's are a perfect example. </B><P>I'm gonna reintroduce you to concepts that seem to negate you: average and most.  Nowe in light of that name some exotic weaps that compare.  <P><B>The fact that you cannot duel wield simply means you do slightly less damage, which is at it should be.**</B><P>Slightly?  Have you lost your mind?  I'm sorry but quading for 80s getting hits close to 200 at times with either hand and being able to bash as well is a hell of a lot more damage than what my two hander is going to do or my sword shield combo.<P><BR><B>**Very true. But most raids require a certain small core of classes that changes very little. </B><P>That's sad.  Most of the time when used correctly those other classes will mean life or death.  Please, just lead a raid with only "pure" classes and tell me how successful you are.<P><B>But they are not required for the raid to be a success. Clerics and warriors, usually monks and enchanters as well, often wizards--they are the absolute and only necessities.**</B> <P>Actually on the topic of success NO ONE is TRUELY a necessity as anyone being used properly could be used for success but you forgot we were talkign about eficiency and I was talking about max efficiency in which case this statement gets watered down plenty like most of the others you've made.<P><B>**Shaman and druid heals don't hold a candle to clerics, especially on tanks. CH is the absolute most powerful weapon (figuratively speaking) in a healer's arsenal. Shamans and druids don't have CH.**</B><P>And don't need it as I have seen it many a time when a druid or shaman has had to step up and heal as the cleric will instruct them to do this.<P><B>**Refer to the above.**</B><P>*shrug*  Doesn't matter.  What you say here dictates otherwise.<P>RageFactor:<B><I>"The point is that there are circumstances in which EVERY class(with the exception of the paladin) will be looked for in some situation. "</B></I><P><B>**Wrong. SK's are never a necessity. Nor are necromancers. Nor are rogues. Nor are druids. Very few classes are REQUIRED in a particular raid situation.**</B><P>1.) wrong again.  For maximum efficiency it depends on the raid.<P>2.) Please point out where I said raid in the above statement.  I believe the word used was situation.  I'll spell it out for you: s-i-t-u-a-t-i-o-n.  Where did you get the word raid?  <P><B>**Stupid or not, a feared pet in Hate, Fear, Necropolis, ToV, or Sleeper's gets the raid killed.**</B><P>Name a time when a feared anything is good. *LOL*  Again, your point is?<P><B>**Complete agreement. But when I said crowd control didn't matter, I was referring to the BOSS MOB fight itself.**</B><P>Umm that is normally why the adds kill everyone, because while beign weakened from fighting the boss the adds are killing everyone while people are focusing on the boss.<P><B>**Already mentioned clerics. We all know HP is good. If ANYONE is ever on a dragon raid I'm leading without the appropriate unbuffed resists at 75, I remove them from the raid. They are a liability in that case, and they don't come.**</B><P>Since getting to the best or maximum hp and resistances would require other classes then the ones you named as a "pure" class you basically just destroyed the basis of your entire argument right there.<P><B>**There are a number of ways to break Fear. That's one of the worst.**</B><P><BR><B>**Wildfire does 1024 damage. There is no ice-based equivalent of that damage caliber. Mages, at every spell circle up to that one (58, I believe) have better and more efficent dd.**</B><P>Druids are third I believe and the point here was that the little fireflies can nuke.<P><B>These are my thoughts. Respond if you wish.</B><P>Np there bud.  Nice talking to you and hope to see more of your posts around on this board.  <P>  <IMG SRC="mad.gif" border="0"> RageFactor Co.  <IMG SRC="mad.gif" border="0">   <IMG SRC="mad.gif" border="0"> <P>Later,<BR>  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" border="0">

First, Ragefactor, we're talking about different things. You attacked my post earlier on this page as pertaining to only one situation--the "raid" siutation, which as you've stated is a highly variable one. What I am arguing is that paladins have no set place on raids. You seem to agree.<P>What are you arguing? If I could figure this out, possibly our discussion could turn into something other than a back and forth flamewar.<P>--------------------<P>Do you know pain?<BR>Do you know rage?<BR>Do you know power?<P>Then that is all you need know of me.

Usually Paladins are not NEEDED on raids but are always useful due to our tanking skills and our small little buffs such as divine glory and divine favour. As for paladins not being not as good of a tank as a warrior, your wrong to an extent. Warriors can take more damage than us yes, but we can heal ourselfs and also have LoH and DA. On raids damage dealing will always go to rogues(if they get some back), monks, and nukers. Warriors are just there to take damage and to taunt the mobs off of the damage dealers. As for nukes not landing on "uber" mobs, your wrong, on most parts. Just need a good ol' tash and malo and see the nukes fly. Yes some mobs are super MR and some only Lull line spells can hit but most uber mobs aren't like that. As for pets on raids, they are a no no on plane breaks and VS. As for most other boss mobs pets are always a good thing in taking and dealing some damage especially with a mage that has a epic chain summoning them. There are no raids that I have been on that NEED pets but i can think of at least 1 that would save your raid alot of trouble. Queen in chardok, has fire AE, on just about every chardok raid that I been on with my guild we had mages summon fire pets and just throwing them at her to ware(sp?) her down, then the melees run in and beat the crap outta her while the casters heal/debuff/nuke.<P>Laterz   <IMG SRC="cool.gif" border="0"><P>--------------------<P>Daakkon Bladebane<BR>55 Knight<BR>King's Court<BR>Drinal

Actually, warriors and rogues are usually the most damaging class on a raid. Monks can often compete with warriors; except the fact that fewer hp and the lack of lots of easy to acquire resist equipment means they die sooner.<P>On Velious mobs with hundreds of thousands of HP, no caster will outdamage a tank (any tank, includign all hybrids) with decent gear. A wizard who chain-nukes Velketor (HP circa 300k) will do perhaps 12-14000 damage with a full bar using the wrath of whatever (the unresistable giant one). A warrior in the typical raid situation deals somwhere around 25k damage, sometimes more or less depending on how many players are there.<P>"As for nukes not landing on "uber" mobs, your wrong, on most parts. Just need a good ol' tash and malo and see the nukes fly. "<BR>**Go land tashani or malosi on a Velious dragon. Then we'll talk. Obviously, if debuffs could land nukes could land. But most Velious mobs are so highly magic resistant that not even near-lure debuffs like the mage level 60 mala can land.**<P>"Yes some mobs are super MR and some only Lull line spells can hit but most uber mobs aren't like that. "<BR>**Trakanon, along with almost all Velious mobs are like that. The kunark and old-world dragons, as well as a number of the other kunark bosses are not, granted--but the toughest mobs in the game are.**<P>"As for paladins not being not as good of a tank as a warrior, your wrong to an extent. Warriors can take more damage than us yes, but we can heal ourselfs and also have LoH and DA."<BR>**Paladins are less capable main tanks after about level 40. They can still do it, granted, but more inefficiently due to lower AC and lower HP. Because clerics use CHeal at this point, the fewer the HP of the person being healed, the more inefficient it becomes. At 55, when warriors get Defensive, the ability for paladins to main tank relative to them becomes obsolete. However, paladins are superb secondary tanks in that they are excellent caster cover, stunner, and last-ditch lifesaver.**<P>And I agree completely--mage pets are extremely useful on the Queen in Chardok and also on the Queen in CoM. Almost essential.<P>--------------------<P>Do you know pain?<BR>Do you know rage?<BR>Do you know power?<P>Then that is all you need know of me.

Back in the century when I used to play EQ. Paladin's are usually the last to die in a Nagafen raid. I am usually one of the last tanks to go because I knew when to back off, and heal and mainly because of Lay Hands also. Paladins make better tanks than warrior in my opinion. Even in lesser mobs, you can use root and stun. Also, if you know how to play your char, then you are of course better off. Some people are just too retarded to control their character to maximize their usefulness. By saying retarded, I mean that they are not as skillful in controlling the character's movement, which is the key in escaping a train in a lot of situations.<P>-Citrus <BR>Retired paladin

You need to define what kind of tank you're talking about. In a group without a strong healer, paladins are certainly more powerful than warriors. And they make good tanks up until the 50's. However, if a cleric is present to keep a warrior healthy, the warriro is simply a better tank than the paladin.<P>This doesn't really mean we're any "better" than paladins, just that we are more capable at doing one particular thing.<P>As far as Naggy raids go, it's been a long time since I went on one of those; however, back in the day ::grin:: the person who had the best fire resists was the last one to go. It all depends on a multitude of factors. Of course, if you're backing off to heal yourself against a dragon, you are soemtimes hurting the raid too--because the dragon isn't dropping as fast.<P>--------------------<P>Do you know pain?<BR>Do you know rage?<BR>Do you know power?<P>Then that is all you need know of me.

52 mage here<P>pallies rule... i love pallies....<P>in a non raid scenario downtime=bad, unless we are taking massive reds down then its worth it but usually downtime is bad.  now a warrior is great, but then his downtime his just as great... unless we have a cleric... another xp sucking entity that keeps wars from being my favourite in groups.<P>i like hybrids, they are creative fun and hell smart enough to understand that mage groups are this odd thing to manage.  mind u i like clerics and i like chanters.  i just hate how dependant we have all become of them.  that puts the other good classes at a loss.   just the other day i had a baddass group of 2 rangers a rogue my mage self and 2 pallies.   guess who was tanking?  my pet !  they key to a good mage is not only crazy damage dealing but damage absorption by pets.  did u know if u stick a mob inside a pet or get the mage to put the pet inside the mob, the pet will take up all the aggro unless rEALLY pissed off?  yes it takes practice from the mage and the whole group but its a beautiful thing to see a coordinated group. (something hybrids and their multitalents are really good at )  u get a pally and ranger both on east and west, pet inside while i maneuver north and south, rogue whereever he needs to be.  tada.  massive death to all mobs with practically no downtime.  all classes can buff themselves and stay relatively full mana ready for the multi pulls that will inevitably arrive.  on 2 and 3 mob pulls is where each one shows their other talents... u cld split up each group pally ranger and me the other pally ranger and rogue for a 2 mob hit.  if a 3rd add comes i can hold him while they finish the other 2 off.   pallies are good tanks havent u heard  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0">  then i can unload myh happlily full mana tank on one of their mobs to get it down fast.  a good mage can recast pets till there is no tomorrow so a mage pet can entertain a mob till needed or dead.<P>true efficiency is seen by organization and fast kills. oooh the war is so important because he can survive the 4 mob pull and tank till the chanter mezzes them all... um  why do that when  u can try to pull one by one.  of more than one comes then so be it but dont be so friggin eager to pull an army because it makes the war look cool.  then again for this to happen u need a chanter and cleric and war.  thats half a group just to make the tank look good.  i like hybrids because they milk the **** out of their abilities.  a good SK can outtaunt pretty much any mob off of a caster.  a good pally can tank everything for a few precious seconds everyone meds for that last bang spell.   when traveling pally root has saved me from imminent death.... ( yeah a pet less mage is a piece of ****... thus i hate raids that dont allow them... and most dont)  When ur out there in the field, the wilderness  u want these neat little abilities everyone whines that the clerics or warriors have better.   yes a clerics buffs overrides the pallies but u know they are not allways around.  clerics are great mind you.   they provide a safety net and allow for risky fun play..... at hte cost of xp.    ive had nice pally ranger rogue mage cleric warrior groups where the cleric just sits there to buff the melee chars.   just because a group has a war doesnt mean u have to use him as a meat shield.  u can fear, have pet tank,  dictate, stun silly  well u all know  what im talking about.   in the REAL EQ world, the one u are out there gaining xp, palladins rock.  versatility is key.  all classes are cool. and straying from the war cleric chanter combo can be a novel and gratifying experience.   <P>on raids:<P>do other hybrids help... yes<BR>are they needed....... no<BR>% of lifetime in raids............ very small<P>let the warriors have their fun... they are entitled to it.  we can have the rest of eq time  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"><P>those of you who keep trying to tell people that they are being stubborn and need to see the bic picture are all in the right.  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">  eq is not just about raids or just about xp.  its about traveling, exploring, testing, talking, treasure hunting, raiding, camping, factionbuilding, xp hunting and pvp fun.   most of the *****ing ive read in this article is "pallies suck, just look how everyone does this better and we arent wanted"  lol  any group wld take a pally over a mage post 50 any day.  u guys are needed to make rogues and rangers look good.  u guys keep parties alive thru root and blindness, loh, rezzes, heals, helming, waving that bright sword like a flag of triumph that lays waste to the vile hoards of underfoot.  ( sorry halflings hehe) did i forget to mention u do great role play?<P>quit ur *****ing folks.  u have it pretty good.  thank ur stars ur not one of the more hurting classes like wizards, mages, necros .... *gasp* look htey are all caster classes. <P>yea we all know that verant is trying to stick affirmative-classbalance-action upon us for being so powerful sub 50.   so i shut up and take it like a man. i play to have fun and i still have fun.  so relax folks and enjoy the fact you still have a very respected and utility high class that is the paladin. good luck guys and get those fiery defenders!!

Define this define that. Who cares. Think of all the situations yourself. Paladins has more benefits than warriors. Thats all.

Wow. After reading this entire string, which took me around 3 hours over 3 nights, I must say I am much more knowledgable about my class. I play a 31 Paladin and quite like him. Now that I have read everything in this string, I know a lot more about my capabilities as a tank, healer, taunter, etc... Forgive me if this is way off-topic, but I would just like to thank you all for enlightening me with your knowledge. It's always nice to get every single aspect possible of something. Props to everyone who posted. Plus, despite the fact that *****ing and moaning rarely settles anything, it does help out those seeking information.<P>--------------------<P>Spaerhawk<BR>31st Paladin<BR>Rodcet Nife Server

Citrus: what you've just said about warriors truly upsets me. Do you really think that because we don't have spells we're any "easier" to play than you are? <P>Being a tank of any kind takes a fair amount of concentration--because of the variables regarding protecting casters, keeping attention, and so on--being a tank does take some effort. Additioanlly, warriors are often pullers--especially in dungeons where many casters live, since feign death doesn't work well while being nuked.<P>Paladins are not better than warriors, but neither are warriors better than paladins. Why start a flame war by suggesting such a thing?<P>--------------------<P>Do you know pain?<BR>Do you know rage?<BR>Do you know power?<P>Then that is all you need know of me.

Sorry if you I upsetted you. But Everything a warrior can do a paladin can do plus a little more. Isnt it the truth? A warrior might have more hp and more ac, but paladins with buffs and lay hands are just as good if not better. I am just trying to say a paladin has more things to play around with.<P>-Citrus

That makes no sense.  <P>Is a lawyer just as combat able to fight as a marine or soldier?  Nope.<P>Is a policemen going to be equal in combat with a mailman?  Nope.<P>The game is so screwed up that nothing can really fix it without re doing everything.<P>You see warriors have to exist from a roleplaying standpoint as most fighters have no real interest in magic but still want to fight.  <P>Warriors are your basic defenders of a city or anythign else.  They are your basic soldiers.<P>Since they must exist that would mean verant would have to try and balance them to be equal with everyone else.  <P>In actuality a paladin should get every ability a warrior has with the exception of duel wield as they are actually no more than Holy Warriors.  Warriors that were so devout in the faith of a good diety that they were granted extra abilities for their fight.<P>Any hybrid should be above that of a warrior as they are nothing more than warriors with some purpose whether it is protector of a forest, protector of people, or a destoyer of all things good and thus gain magical abilities along with their fighting abilities.  <P>When they make hybrids they do it in relation to their parent classes.  They try to keep in mind that they do not want hybrids to be better eventhough they should be.<P>So the best way to solve this problem is to just recognize that the only advantages for being a warrior over a hybrid would be the weapon proficiencies and possesing all warrior skills.  <P>Or to remove warriors all together.  Neither of which will occur.<P>The funny thing is they are so worried about balancing the classes out yet they are adding a whole new class, the beastlord.<P>Since they told us we should be equals we want for that to happen but with the beastlord comming out I can see many heated debates and questions occuring.<P>We'll see what the future holds for EQ...)<P>Later,<P><BR>  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" border="0">

"the game never was and never will be based on role playing. if it was, paladins would have THE most INSANE sword ever, can we say HOLY WEAPON, and i know this goes back a bit for ya citrus."<BR>**Really. Keep in mind that just because paladins are warriors for God by trade, they are not the only fighters with a god behind them. Warriors might argue that because they are strengthened by Rallos Zek, then He bestowed upon them a mighty weapon called the Blade of the Berserker, or something. I'm aware that paladins have a bit of a superiority complex because they are strengthened by God, but there are many gods in Norrath and not all of them look kindly upon paladins.**<P>I agree with you, though. Everquest simply is not a game that supports role-playing very well--the PvP servers are the closest thing we have to that.<P>". honestly how could that off set the game at ALL, paladins have THE HARDEST epic quest.... "<BR>**Have you done the paladins epic quest?<BR>If so, have you done the warrior's? The wizard's? The druid's? The magician's? The Shadowknight's? You have no way to make such a blanket statement without first person experience. I have assisted in parts of every class's epic. In my experience, the magician epic is probably the toughest--not because there are difficult bosses to kill, necessarily--but because a number of the components are not mage-epic-quest specific, the pegasus cloak for example. But that's another issue. The point is, the paladin epic is not really all that difficult relative to some of the others.**<P>"well where are the paladin only shields? "<BR>**1: Shield of the Stalwart Seas--Eru Paladins only. <BR>2: Life's Guard--30ac, paladins only<BR>3: Shield of the Immaculate--25? ac, paladin only.**<P>Your problem, psycho, is that you like your class, and you want paladins to be kick ass. The problem is, you simply need to look at overall balance--making the paladin epic the best weapon in the game, making insanely powerful shields with effects, etc etc is _unbalancing_. Sorry. It just is.<P>--------------------<P>Do you know pain?<BR>Do you know rage?<BR>Do you know power?<P>Then that is all you need know of me.

Hi all,<P>I think if the Epic Sword was 1 hander, it would be the greatest improvement for paladin ever. But then again, getting it is like saying "mom im going to hell to fetch my soul from satan, be back by dinner" <P>Comment on the different class epic quests. Oh come on... the example of the pegasus cloak is pretty lame... I would rather sit at karanas all day and wait for cloak than kill a dragon and kill a necro thats as tough as a dragon, then go thru 4 islands of plane of air and etc etc.... Getting the cloak requires 1 person to do. <P>Also another point is that, most of these classes really dont *NEED* an epic quest weapon. What is a necro gonna do with an epic weapon? Mage? Like I have said before, for new readers, Mage and necros and other caster classes are already over powered. Only melee classes need addition attack bonuses. Giving a caster an epic weapon is like saying giving a warrior an item that summons him a level 50 pet. Is that fair? NO. <P>Maybe its Verant's strategy to keep the casters playing. Since majority of the players are casters. So in order to keep the caster customers, they always seem to improve casters? Just a thought.<P>Addition, the epic weapon for paladin is a piece of $#!^, no addition haste, no addition buffs. Junk! If you dont like the truth, then suck it! =)<P>My apology if i get anyone upset. Just stating what I think is the truth. <P>-Citrus<BR>Retired paladin

Hmmm, I'm kinda coming into this a little late, but in my experience, CC is essential for any RAID.  A raid is not just the fight with the BOSS MOB.  It's the fight with the boss mob PLUS all it took to get to him.  And sometimes, there aren't even boss mobs associated with raids.  For example, the other night I went on a joint guild raid to Kael Drakkal.  There was no boss mob we were after.  We were there for armor drops (see Thurgadin quests).  And quite frankly, without chanters there for CC (not mezzes, charms) a lot more of us would have died.  Some might not consider that a raid cuz it had no boss mob, but any time a get together with 35 peeps from 2 guilds with a hunt objective, I consider it a raid.<P>--------------------<P>Atern Gemfitter<BR>53rd 'chanter<BR>Crimson Fist<BR>Tholuxe Paells

Dynamo, yes i have done druid,ranger epics, fairly easy, they have triggered spawn the only hard part is killing that dark reaver guy in 10 seconds, from what i understood clerics have the easiest erpic due to it's nature, the cleric epic is 100% essecntial to the sucess of most raids, mage epic didnt seem to bad, Sk i havent seen, i heard it was fairly hard. but the REASON the paladin epic is the hardest it's 3 quests in one, soulfire ( not too bad takes little time because of spawn times, usally 6 hours), then the fiery avenger, which is extremely hard to get, then you have an entire quest to do after that.<P>personally i think it's unfair that Sk's and Paladins are FORCED into using a 2 handed epic.<P>those shields you named<P>ERU paladin only, the WORST type of paladin to be, of course they get a damned good shield. only way to even come close to balancing them off, the others are drops off the gods in planes, VERY RARE. not somthing your going to come buy very often.<P>Which is why paladins need a decent shield, and not a no drop one, something that can be handled around.<P>--------------------<P>-PsychoSimatic-<BR>-Garethec Swordbreaker-<BR>-Bertoxxulous-

First of all most of my issues concern PVP, and not so much the lack of offense but the amout of misses paladins have. 6 misses in a row for a warrior duel wielding isnt all that much for a single weapon even with a noose that is alot, and that isnt including missing two bashes in a row as well.. Gives most pkers time to gate, yonder, shadow step what ever! You put two warrior classes fighting and it comes down to equipment and skill and that includes joust runs, to getting clear to heal, DD or what ever you believe needs to be done. All Warriors are second to Magic classes.<P>  I sit on my Shaman and watch my mana go up faster then my hps and that is with choloplast going as well,  I do believe that mana regens faster then hit points but WHY that makes no sense why should it be like that? If I am wrong some one plz test the theory.<BR>  I am just tired of being ganked that is it and most times I dont die.. havent died in a long time, but still LOH is gone and then for the next 70min I am a victem - Ranger spells, pally spells? Bard all are useless<BR>try to root some one after level 50 almost imposible and if you get a lucky root off it last about two seconds or they yonder out of it while you are swinging at air. Pallies and rangers could be real threats to magic types if their spells landed, ranger with snare, pally can fire off all 3 stuns one after another with very little time after you fire the first three, 4 seconds later you can refire them.. Why cant they land their spells better BECAUSE verrants was to stubborn to give the true tank class the full warrior a few useful spells at high levels, a root a blind, snare something to help them kill the casters, <BR>   They just upped the MR debuff on chanters WHY??  clerics cant hit any better, Pallies cant root, Rangers cant so why give it to chanters all of a sudden? No matter what spell a hybrid would use none opens up to the humility of sitting there mezzed and watching your pker sit in front of you OOM gaining mana while you are helpless. To me it seems when ever a caster cant kill another player well enough they do something to fix it..  Why havent they figured a way to help the Warrior class just dont understand.. Sorry to you all on the blue servers but duels arent the samething no way even close to it..
