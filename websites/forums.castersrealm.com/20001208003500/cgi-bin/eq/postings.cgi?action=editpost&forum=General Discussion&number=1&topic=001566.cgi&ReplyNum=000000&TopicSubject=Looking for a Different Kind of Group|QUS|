<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Background:  My main problem with EQ is that there are not enough hours in the day to play. I have a day job (go to school as well), so my EQ time is limited to a few hours every weeknight.  And weekends are usually booked up with my other hobbies (can’t play EQ forever, guys) and errands that I don’t get to during the week.  I’ve played a number of characters, joined a guild or two, had some fun.  I ended up having to leave those guilds because I couldn’t keep up with the other members due to lack of playing time. If I join a guild, I want to group with other members.  So I ended up trying out new characters that could I could solo well with. That was fun for a day or two, but I really missed the fun times with a regular group.
Proposal:  I want to put together a regular group (maybe even a guild one day if there’s enough interest) of people like me who have a limited amount of playing time.  Ideally, I would like to see a small, close-knit group who enjoys role-playing, practicing trade skills (gotta build up that alcohol tolerance), helping out newbies, etc.  The following is a list of ideas I have about this group (guild):

1. The majority of the playing time to be between 5:00pm-12:00am EST on weeknights.  Obviously, you can play anytime you want, but I‘d like to try to keep everybody within 3 lvls of each other so we can all group.  I think it would be nice to have a range of time that you know you would be able to find the group online. 
2. We all start at level 1.  That way there is no need for powerleveling. Also, it would be great to have everyone “grow up” together.  If you’ve ever wanted to start a second character, here’s your chance. Not sure about twinking though.
3. I’d like to see all classes represented. That way we can have group that can complement each other, and its adds a lot of variety.  So if I can get 6 people initially, I’d like us all to be of a different class.
4. I’d like to see all trade skills represented (well most of them).  I think trade skills are great and add alot to roleplaying.
5. Well educated EQ’ers.  When I ‘m at work, I’m constantly reading message boards on EQ sites, learning about quests, reading class boards.  I want to group with people who a genuine interest in the game.
6. Would like to have a member with some HTML skills. Perhaps we could have a web site, or at least a message board where we could contact each other while at work.  
7. Leveling isn’t the prime directive. Having fun and helping out the group is.

These are some ideas of the kind of regular group that I would like to join.  I may be the only one in the world who has these ideas. That’s okay, at least I tried.  But if you have these same ideas and interests, email me at paola3817@yahoo.com or post here.  I’d like to hear what people think about this.  Am I  totally off-base here?  
Thanks for reading this, and I hope to hear from you.
