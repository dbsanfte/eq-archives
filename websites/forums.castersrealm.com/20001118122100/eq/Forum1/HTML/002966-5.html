I admire you for this acknowledgement.<P>Just to be clear to everyone, playing your game is your business but it is Verant's business to see that the rules are obeyed by all! I personally have made a GM abide by the PNP rules and rule in my favor over someone who was farming an item for over 3 days! The person and the GM did not like it, but when a senior GM showed up, he said that the rules were as I had stated them and even if the GM trainee didn't like them she still had to abide by them and enforce them. If you know the rules, then you also know that you can force yourself into any farming spawn that you want to compete with! Either way you have at least a 50/50 chance of obtaining the item!<P>Corven</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002966.cgi&ReplyNum=000100&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Mmmmm....Twinkies">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I am not against twinking in and of itself.  HOWEVER...there are some cases where I believe it has a negative effect on the community.<P>One of these is taking up rare drop items that only one class can use (or items for class only quests).  For instance, the rogue who has a hard time getting Ravenscale because he has to compete with everyone who wants it for their rogue TWINK.  Or the shadowknight who keeps losing the roll on decayed drops because everyone else wants to do the quest for their TWINK.  It's hard enough to get these items without that kind of unconsideration on the part of others.  <P>Sure, if no one is at a camp, and you want to camp something for your twink...go ahead!  I just hope that if someone who can really use the item for themself, not for a twink, then you would be willing to share the spawn or move.<P>Another thing is if the person has a bad "I'm better than you are because your armor sucks" attitude.  Otherwise...who cares?<P>And DON'T get me started on twinked BEGGARS!!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002966.cgi&ReplyNum=000101&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Mmmmm....Twinkies">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I second Leandria's thoughts.<P>I was waiting while a druid and warrior were camping the drake leggings for their monk twinks.  I didn't get whiny about it, but just waited.  After two PH spawns they left and I took over.  In between spawns I noticed a 52 wiz also looking for them, but she didn't invoke PNP and said merely that she was just hoping it wasn't camped.  All in all I thought everyone was cool in this situation.  If more players acted/reacted in this manner there would probably be a large diffusion in anti-twink posts.<P>If people would sprinkle a little "community awareness" in with their self-absorbtion it would be much more palatable for us all.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002966.cgi&ReplyNum=000103&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Mmmmm....Twinkies">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR><BR>Raze, I stated my point very clearly, you read post and inserted your own idea into what i was saying and missed the whole point. But dont worry everyone on these boards does that, it's the only way you can make your point. <P>NO one is jealous of anyone. How can I be, I have very little stuff on my highest level charachter because i could care less about highest INT, or highest STR. I care less about what you or anyone else twinks with. But I'll bet you this, Most Twinked PC's you meet will begg cheat and steal to get the upper hand. Most will. there are few that just have this huge accumulation of stuff that they just cant give away and so twink a second charachter, but thats thier perrogative. Jealousy has nothing to do with anything, thats a childish response to defend your point and guess what...It's weak, very weak.<P>Point out the main reason you twink. It's because you want to start another charachter and get him to the same level as your previous character as soon as possible. Heck anyone can fly through the first 9-12 levels of newbiedom, but with that extra bit of protection it's a bit safer. and thats why they twink, "You DIE LESS". I hated starting out in this game nearly quit at level 4 because I died so much. <P>And thats why most people twink, few kids show off a bit, some bragg about good fourtune, but recognize this the only reason anyone twinks is so they dont die so often, and they gain as much xp as they can while they are alive. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002966.cgi&ReplyNum=000104&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Mmmmm....Twinkies">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Hmm...<BR>From your initial point of view (Me twink -you jealous) you then went to the more congenial (It's just my point of view - your's is equally valid) and returned to the confrontational (See above). If you look hard at yourself you will find that you are probably guilty of that which you are accusing others - jealousy!<BR>Your defence is the best in the book -'Offence is the best form of Defence' by which I mean you use twinking to ensure no-one has a more impressive character than your own.<BR>The main problem with this defence is that with 300,000 players there is always someone better than you and thus your own lack of self-assuredness is converted into an outwardly aggressive persona (at least online!)<BR>This is NOT a flame but an observation of what appear to be your motives as to your gameplay and treatment of others (? in RL also?)<BR>As a psychiatrist please accept apologies if this is not the case and makes no sense to you.<BR>Personally I admit to pangs of jealousy when Mega-twinks run past but this is an entirely normal reaction in the sometimes competetive atmosphere of EQ.<BR>I do however get much more pleasure from the Role-Playing aspects of the game and enjoy interacting with others more than camping a spawn site (Boring, repetetive but good for getting 'just one more level')<BR>Finally, I am amazed how far this thread has run on and I am sure 'Chaos Theory' must have something to do with it!!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002966.cgi&ReplyNum=000105&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Mmmmm....Twinkies">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Corven your a jack ass, you take a person's view and you slaughter it just because you believe differently.  Silent Advice has some good points and from your responses I see that you are exactly the kind of person that he was talking about... the one that is to high level to get exp from the mobs he is farming and doesn't care about those that could get the exp.  Since your so inclined to voice your own idiotic opinion I think I will at least voice mine with a little more backing to why I think as I do, not like you thinking it’s right and that being a good enough excuse.<P> ------------------------------------------<BR><B> 1) Yes it does, they are jealous because they are upset with others benefitting from something they are not benefitting from! </B><BR><B>2) I believe it is because you choose not to spend your time doing it! </B><BR><B>3) The quote "while my group could be getting good exp and loot from these mobs." implies jealousy that the other person is taking exp and loot that you are somehow entitled to over him! JEALOUSY!!! </B><BR><B>4) It does include jealousy! But you are right, you don't have to like it. But until the rules of the game are changed, you do have to put up with it. Unless you invoke the PNP rules and demand an equal turn at the mobs with your group that their group has! </B><BR><B>5) At least you admit that you changed your view once you reached the level where you were able to twink your character out! I admire you for this acknowledgement. </B><BR><B>Just to be clear to everyone, playing your game is your business but it is Verant's business to see that the rules are obeyed by all! I personally have made a GM abide by the PNP rules and rule in my favor over someone who was farming an item for over 3 days! The person and the GM did not like it, but when a senior GM showed up, he said that the rules were as I had stated them and even if the GM trainee didn't like them she still had to abide by them and enforce them. If you know the rules, then you also know that you can force yourself into any farming spawn that you want to compete with! Either way you have at least a 50/50 chance of obtaining the item! </B><BR> ------------------------------------------<P>1)For starters this game has been out for over a year now and everyone should be able to twink to an extent meaning they have the means to do so if they choose to so why would someone be jealous if they were against it?  It's not like most people can't twink.  Second, some people like the role-play aspect of EQ and to not twink makes it that more of a challenge to them in some ways.<BR>2)We’ll skip this one, it’s about one’s preference and I really don’t want to get into a “I said I like it so it’s ok to do” argument with you.<BR>3)This is by far anything but jealousy from my standpoint.  You are so close-minded you can’t see the real reason why someone would be upset about this.  You take it for jealousy but you should be looking at it from a lower level persons view instead of the higher levels.  The reason I can see Silent Advice having a problem with this is that a high level that <B>doesn’t</B> (as he initially said) get exp from the mobs takes away from a group that can be getting exp and earning an item instead of buying it from high levels all the time.  I can see this as being true because I enjoy an item more if I earned it by killing the monster for it not buying it from a high level.<BR>4)You’re an idiot on this one, you are telling someone what he or she is feeling.  Just because he or she doesn’t like something doesn’t mean he or she is Jealous.  Maybe he or she doesn’t like it cause of some bad experiences.  I don’t have much to say except grow up and realize that you can’t determine what others think.<BR>5)Just because he or she changed his or her view at higher level makes you admire him or her?  That’s the crapiest excuse to admire someone especially when your ripping his or her post from limb to limb up to that point.  <P><B>I personally have made a GM abide by the PNP rules and rule in my favor over someone who was farming an item for over 3 days!

You seriously think a group of level 30s can out damage a 50-55 level druid, magician, necromancer or anything else with high damage?  That’s the stupidest thing I have heard.  Compete with a high level that can do over half damage to something your level in one spell.  I have seen a high level druid take out a clockwork with two spells that was farming Sol A and you think my group of three 38s could out damage her?  Your dilusional.<P>The play nice rules do help in most instances but not in all so you can’t always fall back on them.  From personal experiences your lucky to find a farmer that even cares if you want to share the spawn or not, they may say yes but they won’t let you attack the named mob before they get the kill, most are not afraid of getting in trouble by GMs or Guides.<P>Damn I hate when people try and tell others how to think.  If I came off sounding that way then I am sorry but knock off the tearing into someone’s thread just cause you don’t agree with them and I will stop as well.  Everyone has a choice whether or not to twink and it is just that… <B>their</B> choice, whether you think they are idiots for not twinking or for twinking is your opinion.  Let it go and don’t worry about what others do with their characters and you will have more fun in the game instead of complaining about every other twinked out player runs by.<BR><p>[This message has been edited by Trist (edited October 13, 2000).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002966.cgi&ReplyNum=000108&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Mmmmm....Twinkies">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Prometheus:<BR><B><BR>(1) From your initial point of view (Me twink -you jealous) you then went to the more congenial (It's just my point of view - your's is equally valid) and returned to the confrontational (See above). <P>(2) If you look hard at yourself you will find that you are probably guilty of that which you are accusing others - jealousy!<P>(3) Your defence is the best in the book -'Offence is the best form of Defence' by which I mean you use twinking to ensure no-one has a more impressive character than your own.<P>(4) The main problem with this defence is that with 300,000 players there is always someone better than you and thus your own lack of self-assuredness is converted into an outwardly aggressive persona (at least online!)<P>(5)This is NOT a flame but an observation of what appear to be your motives as to your gameplay and treatment of others (? in RL also?)<P>(6) As a psychiatrist please accept apologies if this is not the case and makes no sense to you.<P>(7) I do however get much more pleasure from the Role-Playing aspects of the game and enjoy interacting with others more than camping a spawn site (Boring, repetetive but good for getting 'just one more level')<P>(8) Finally, I am amazed how far this thread has run on and I am sure 'Chaos Theory' must have something to do with it!!</B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>1) I'm not the initial one who said "me twink-you jealous". I do agree with this statement for the most part though. Also, you need to read the full post if you are to truly understand my point of view.<P>2) Of course I'm jealous of others in this game with better stuff than me---who wouldn't be? But, I don't get mad at them for having it. Instead, I work my own characters to the point where they too can enjoy these kind of toys.<P>3) No, I do not twink to ensure that no-one has a more impressive character than my own. However, I do twink to make an impressive character in my own eyes. I also like the ability to stand and fight when most others are forced to run. This is one of the main reasons I twink my character--Durability.<P>4) I admit that there are many many others out there with better equipment than mine---it always happens when there is no-drop equipment from the planes which can only be accessed after level 46. And if you care to check these posts, I am not the aggressive one here, but simply defending my point of view from all the other aggressive posts.<P>5) This may not be a flame for you, but the next post stating that this post applied specifically to me turned this post into a flame against me. As far as in the game, you have the right to come and play with me anytime you feel like you want to. However, whether or not you get into my group, is entirely up to my group members which usually consist of my guildmates, people who are my friends and count me as their friend.<P>6) If you are truly a psychiatrist, then you should know that everyone is different. And even if something works for one person, doesn't mean it will work for another person.<P>7) I also enjoy the roleplaying aspect more than camping an item. I have only camped items a few times and do not personally believe in FARMING. This was one of the main reasons I informed people as to how they could insert themselves into a spawn.<P>8) One of the reasons why this thread has run so far is because I don't turn tail and run when someone flames me. Instead, I try to accurately defend my position on why I play my game the way I play it.<P>As I have said many times before, read the whole thread here before flaming me. If you do, I think you may change your mind about what I am saying. Midian did come around to agreeing with me after he was one of my staunchest opponents. Why? Because he found himself in a situation like what I was talking about and could now see what it was I was saying. Likewise, you will also someday come into one of these situations and think to yourself: "Now I know what he was talking about!", even if you still do not agree with me.<P>Corven</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002966.cgi&ReplyNum=000110&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Mmmmm....Twinkies">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

I wonder who this name really belongs to? Hmmmm!<P>2) I did not slaughter his view, I just pointed out where his statement of his view was inaccurate. I did say that he had every right not to like this though and that until the game is changed that it was what everyone has to put up with. And I do not FARM. I do insert myself into situations where I can get experience. And as to being too high in level, you show that you have not fully read this whole post and your lack of reading again entitles you to the name you called me. My highest character is only level 32 and I no longer play him anymore. Or is it that you are such a newbie that 32 is an unreachable level for you?<P>3) I am inclined to voice my opinion which I have the right to do. Just as you have the right to voice your opinion. This is one of the reasons for this board, so people can post their opinions on a subject--so long as they remain civil. Otherwise you risk the auditors of this board removing your opinion and then you might as well have said nothing.<P>4)I disagree with the statement that everyone has this ability. I have personally met several people within the last few weeks that are on their very first character and still in their 20's or less. I do agree with the thought that others shouldn't be jealous because they don't have what others do. As to your second point here, I agree that some choose to play this way and they have every right to do so. I myself am contemplating starting completely over on the new server.<P>5) At least here you agree that it falls down to what a person chooses to do with his/her time.<P>6) First of all, I am considered a low level as far as these threads are concerned. This you would know if you had READ the whole thread. As far as the lack of experience a high level gets, it doesn't matter because he is getting the loot he is going after. Any GM will tell you that any level character has the right to hunt any other level character if they so choose. This is why many necros and sk's hunt low skels for their bone chips that they need for their pets. Again, if he wants an equal turn at the mobs--INVOKE THE PNP RULES---they do work.<P>7) Again, if you are angry that someone is getting something that you should "rightfully" be getting in their stead, then that is JEALOUSY. Don't Bill Clinton this thought pattern. Meaning don't say something is other than what it really is. Bill Clinton REALLY had sex with Monica and Silent Advice REALLY is jealous because someone is camping where he wants to camp.<P>8) My admiration of someone can be stated even when I do not agree with what they are saying. Reminds me of what someone once told me: Stand up for your beliefs! You may be right. You may be wrong. But at least you stand for something!<P>9) Again with the namecalling? And you say that I need to grow up! What I said was that any player can invoke the PNP rules and have an equal turn at the mob in demand. Most players at a camp will not want to relinquish an equal turn to you (Note: you have to ask for the turn nicely before you can call a GM). If they say yes, then all is well--no GM needed. If they say no, then call a GM and he/she will determine an equal split according to the number of groups that are at the spawn. By compete, I mean an equal share at the spawn--refer to above PNP situation.<P>10) But you say: what if a high level refuses to acknowledge the PNP rules and takes out the kill anyway. a) They may suffer banishment if not a strong reprimand (I have personally seen them reprimanded for this). b) Some GMs stick around after the decision to see how the upperlevels are going to act when the spawn comes and if they are going to rightfully share the spawn. c) If they do wrongfully killsteal the mob and loot the item, they not only risk the above but are guaranteed to lose the loot as well as their character if they are not careful. Most are not afraid of consulting a GM because the others who were wronged do not know the PNP rules and care not to learn them. When they don't know them, then they can't use them in the given situations where they need them.<P>11) If you hate others telling someone how to think, then why do YOU do the same thing? (A bit of hippocrisy perhaps) And as to tearing into someone else's thread as you so aptly put it, you should READ the entire post to know how this post progressed. If you do ACTUALLY read it, then you will know that I started my opinion on this post defending the individual's right to play their game any way they want to play it--whether they want to twink or not. I just happen to enjoy twinking myself. Also I have had to revert to answering posts after this fashion due to the fact that all of my posts have been torn into by another poster. And I am not worried about other people's characters and how they choose to play them, essentially I am defending their right to do so against those who don't want twinkies to be able to twink their characters and would prefer everything to be no-drop instead. The problem with this is that if everything were no drop--then the class specific items would be unattainable because it would require a balanced group to hold the camp and the only ones wanting to camp the item would be the class that the item is for.<P>In the end of it all, play your character the way you wanna play it. Don't climb all over someone because they wanna twink. If you can twink--then do so or dont so according to how you want to play.<P>Have fun with this one!<P>Corven<P>[This message has been edited by Corven/Slarek (edited October 14, 2000).]<P>[This message has been edited by Corven/Slarek (edited October 14, 2000).]<p>[This message has been edited by Corven/Slarek (edited October 14, 2000).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002966.cgi&ReplyNum=000111&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Mmmmm....Twinkies">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Ok Midian, <P>However, you DID see my point of view--which I said. And you still don't agree with me--which you have the right to do. What I was pointing out was that what I am saying has valid reasons behind it. Meaning that I have been in those situations where the newbie player caused my group harm and I try to avoid them using criteria of my own so I can level efficiently while still playing and having a good time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002966.cgi&ReplyNum=000113&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Mmmmm....Twinkies">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

So i have been known to also at times when going through a newbie zone to make a contest for newbies or whatever suits my fancy at the time giving away something i have on me. It might not be much in the view of some but to those true newbies even 1 platinum can make you feel rich. So i will continue my good deeds even to the warning of some 'i got burned being nice to newbies'. So if i want to put an SMR on some bat in a newbie zone.. who cares i will laugh when the bat dies and the twink doesn't even stop to check the corpse =) <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002966.cgi&ReplyNum=000121&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Mmmmm....Twinkies">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

We don t care you cheat to kill mobs, it s just unfair you cheap when you kill players.<P>(this apply to all the cheatings in PvP, and there is A LOT)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002966.cgi&ReplyNum=000123&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Mmmmm....Twinkies">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I have seen A LOT of newbies, twinked by friends or by their guild...<P>They just play soooo bad it's ridiculous.<P>A level 15 Ogre Warrior with a RC who don't even know the existence of the taunt ability LOL...<P>I prefer grouping with a TRUE newbie.. At least, he will listen to you and not think "I have a big sword i do lot of damage, i don't listen to this guy speaking of 'TAUNT'"<P>I group with anyone. Then i make friends and i group with them again, or i dont and i dont group with them anymore. Every one must have a chance.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002966.cgi&ReplyNum=000124&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Mmmmm....Twinkies">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><br>This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum1/HTML/002966-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum1/HTML/002966.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum1/HTML/002966-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum1/HTML/002966-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum1/HTML/002966-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum1/HTML/002966-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=002966&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=002966&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
