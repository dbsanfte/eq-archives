<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">
The sun was just peaking over the hills to the east, twinkling through the lush growth of the forest.  The air was silent still, there was an uneasy peaceful feeling in the land this morning.  This was very different from the normal wakening in this war torn land.  More often than not your sleep is rudely interrupted by the sound of steel clashing against steel, the anguished cries of battle or the final sigh of another life ending abruptly.  But today was different.  I dared not open an eye lest the serenity I was feeling would come to an abrupt halt.  But alas I wanted to see what a peaceful day looked like here in the forest so I barely squinted through one eye to secretly glimpse the peaceful surroundings.  As the minutes went by, the sun rose higher and turned the morning dew into a foggy steam that began to rise from the forest floor.  A large skunk scurried by, stopping to nibble on the thick leaves of this tropical land, then darted off in another direction.  The pungent sweet odor of the tropical flowers invaded my space.   I could feel the air grow warmer and the hair along my arms stand up against the sudden gush of cool air off the ocean from the west.  I could almost taste the salt as I breathed the air that became tainted as it rushed across the choppy seas.  It was a new day in this land called Butcher Block.  And little did I know that this day would be the defining of my very existence for the rest of my eternity in the land of Norrath.  <P>I fully opened my eyes now and brushed away the trance induced by my medding stupor.  It was time.  Time to once again prepare myself for the battles that lie ahead.  My comrades would be waiting.  Indeed, they would be anticipating my arrival and very likely could be holding up the start of the crusade on my behalf.  For I am....the healer.  <P>Warriors and rangers, monks and wizards, it did not matter who they were. We were all on the side of good.  The side of everything we have been taught should be good.  We all had a single purpose, to destroy the godless creatures who so heartlessly had invaded our fair land.  But strong as the warrior is, as nimble as the ranger and monk are and as wise and intelligent as the wizard can be, they all pale when they find they are about to die by the hands of these vermin.  Down to a thread of health they stand choking, trying to absorb one last breath to perhaps allow them one final and  mighty strike that will fell the enemy.  Allow their life to go on.  But...the strike is a miss!  The casting is interrupted!  And they are about to meet their deity.  All hope is gone,  when all of a sudden in a rush of wind and blue that surrounds them, building up from their feet, swirling round and round as it traverses upwards with hurricane force and the sound of a fury to envelope their entire body, they are suddenly able to take in a deep breath once again.  Their muscles bulge once again in defiance.  Their legs grow mighty and their heart races to pump the thickened blood back to the extremities of their very souls.  And the enemy who moments before was cackling with glee over the impending demise of its next victim is struck down himself with a final cry of defiance.  The cleric has spoken.  As life itself was about to end, the cleric has healed his comrades and brethren and allowed them to continue their quest for justice.    (Shameless Advertisement:  Hear Ye....If you haven't signed up yet, please check your mail for details of my Prepaid Heal Plan...don't be caught short in your next battle!)<P>It is not by my sword, nor by my arrow that I dispel the feared and hated invaders of our lands.  Rather, I use my god-given powers of the Heal to make sure that my comrades are able to go on, to fight the good fight.  And should they die in their haste, I am there to reawaken their lost soul with the almighty power of the rez!  <P>Aye, it was time to move!  I would first check my possessions  to be sure I was outfitted correctly for the day's events.  If not, I could surely swing by the 7-11 in Kaladim for any additional provisions I would need.   On this day I found I badly needed to offload the mountain of coin so willingly donated by the scurvy villains we had spent the last eve dispelling.  I immediately broke into marathon pace as I set out for the gates of Kaladim.  To the vaults of the inner city I would travel.  I quickly found the twisting path and used the travel time to view my surroundings.  The forest is known for its towering trees which create an umbrella to the hot sun above, allowing temperatures at the forest floor to remain tolerable.  Looking around I could see there were plenty of forest creatures about.  I bid hello to several of my distant family members scurrying across the path...the spiders!   They did the same and stopped to warn me of bandits that were about this morning.  With that in mind, I slowed my pace so that I could sufficiently view the path and surroundings that were ahead of me.  Sure enough, not too far down the path there he was.  I knew his tactics.  He would stand there motionless, flashing me his toothless unshaven grin.  He would allow me to approach unheeded and then likely strike me from behind as I passed.  Alas that was not to be on this day as I stopped and with but a twitch of my finger,  sent a crashing spell of smite over the villain which immediately struck him down where he stood.  I again picked up my pace and ran past his unholy corpse, not bothering to loot him on this morn.  Some very young warrior would surely come across the body and exclaim with delight over the treasures he would find.  This made me feel good.  Now I was approaching one of the landmarks of this forest...the famous crossroads in the central part of the great forest.  This was a grand location for doing nothing but sit and watch the citizens of our fine land come together to meet and to trade and to sell their wares.    All manner of people pass here in the shadow of the guards who patrol this intersection.  Some in great shining armor which glistens from the plains, while others wear nearly nothing at all as they run to retrieve what is left of their almighty soul left rotting in some far off dungeon.  Beggars abound, and most of all...the lovers.  Yes, the lovers meet at this crossroads all the time.  You can overhear their yearnings and vows as they meet to once again hold each other for a brief moment.  It makes me think back to my own upbringing, and the fact that I never knew my parents.  But they must have been lovers who perhaps met at this same spot in a now  forgotten time ago.  I continue my swift journey towards the city, wondering if I would ever meet someone at these crossroads myself.  Nonsense.  No time for such trivial pursuits when there is a war to fight!<P>I finally rounded the final curve to see the glaring lights of the gate to Kaladim.  The city is built into the sides of the largest mountain in this forest and it is a grand city to behold.  Home of the infamous Tumpy Tonic...a brew that will surely send a young lad or lass soaring to heights they could barely think of.  I noted the Verant Tinkerer's vehicle outside of Tumpy's house on this day.  I stopped to ask what was going on...the tinkerer indicated only that his boss was sick of the kids' access to such a high-flying brew.  He would tell me no more.  I sighed and lit out for the bank.  Just outside the bank was a vendor whom I struck up a conversation with and bartered with on the sale of much armor and weaponry taken from the enemy.  He would not budge on his prices however, even after I suggested his house might be in danger of an invasion of small poisonous creatures.  I reluctantly sold all that I had and proceeded to the teller's window.  This particular teller is not a very talkative sort so I simply went about my business.  I once again noticed that the bank failed to post the interest to my account.  I left muttering about finding a better bank, perhaps with cute tellers too.  "And why in hell don't you have direct deposit?" I called out as I left the building.<P>PART II<P>Outside the bank, I started for the exit but suddenly stopped short and turned around.  There in front of me was the entrance to the Kaladim Mine.  I passed this point perhaps hundreds of times, yet for some reason unknown to me, there was a sudden attraction, drawing me to the nearly hidden entrance of the darkened interior.  For the first time ever I dared enter the confines of this mining operation not knowing why the strange attraction.  There seemed not to be anything out of the ordinary as I passed several miners busily working away to fill their carts with some mineral.  Yet, I was drawn deeper into the blackness.  The temperature grew warmer as I made my way deeper into the cavern.  Odd, I thought, since I always thought the temperature under the earth would remain somewhat cooler.  But it was as if a great warmth of love and harmony was enveloping my being.  Suddenly I stopped short as if meeting a hidden gate that would not allow further progress.  I peered into the eerie silence and spotted nothing more than an ancient etching left in the side of the stone facade.  It was obviously an inscription left by an adoring father which started "For my darling daughter, Sar...".  The rest was obliterated by years of decay and neglect.  Strangely, this inscription brought joy to my soul and I felt I had found something important here.  I noted the location and turned back to retrace my path in the mine.<P>Once again outside in the light of the city, I decided to save time and gated back to the spot in the forest where I had awoken earlier to this glorious day.  My packs were full of the supplies I would need, I was well rested and content knowing I was now able to proceed on to meet my comrades in that heathen center known as the Estate of Unrest.  Aye it was years ago now that this estate was once a grand and glorious home to the Governor of this land.  In all it's regal splendor it was a sight to behold.  The sun shone overhead the beautiful fountains in the front yard, where guests would mingle and sample the fine foods laid out by the Governor's mistress.  Couples would stroll the gardens, getting lost in the mazes on either side of the front walk.  Aye, one wonders if they did not get lost on purpose in order to find a moment of privacy away from the other guest's view.  And there were the formal balls held in the tower with it's magnificent view of the courtyard below.  The beautiful maidens dressed in their finest silks would be escorted up the winding stairs to dance and delight in this once elegant ballroom.  But that splendor, along with the laughter and gaiety of the visitors was now a distant memory.  The villainous undead had taken up residence in this once magnificent home, killing off all life and destroying all of its contents.  The exterior of the palace was showing the years of neglect with shutters astray, the paint peeling, weeds overtaking the lawns and gardens.  Even the sun refused to shine on this now despicable center of evil.  It was a dark and evil place indeed.  It was our duty to capture it back from these vermin, and restore its former beauty.  That is where I would once again carry the battle on this new day.<P>I quickly made my way to the narrow pass that led to Dagnor's Cauldron.  This mountainous terrain had to be traversed to reach the entrance of the estate.  This land was named after Governor Dagnor who was the last living inhabitant of the great estate.  It was called Cauldron since the warm water lake sat like water in a cauldron, with the blue-black mountains rising majestically on all sides.  It was truly a beautiful sight by day, and even more so in the light of the moon on a crystal dark night.  I vowed to one day sit by this panorama with one I would hold dear and share in the warmth of the moon casting a glisten to the still waters below.  But I shook off these frivolous thoughts and proceeded onwards.  Through miles of narrow twisting paths I ran to finally make my way up the final ascent, past long dead trees to reach the crescent of this mountain now overlooking the gaping sea below.  It was a view which always takes my very breath away.  I carefully descended to the shoreline and proceeded to make my way to the far south.  I passed several rats which  were now able to run rampant in this land simply because no one had the time to tend to their eradication.  Gobs had also taken up residence here, and I ran directly through their campsite, taunting them to dare take up arms against me.   They could rejoice in the fact that I had other enemies on my mind this day as I now neared the cave entrance to the estate.  <P>As I entered the cave, it was apparent that the wars were not going well so early in the day.  The narrow cave was crowded with my fellow crusaders, most of them spent and bloodied by the battles being fought in the Estate.  I stopped and healed several warriors and even a lowly paladin.  There was an enchantress there dressed in flowing green who bore the very odd name Joan Ofarc.  I had met this wench several times before and she was noted as a strong and able fighter whose crafting skill in the jewelry arts would very soon be second to no one in the land.  I bid her good morrow and offered several of my finest buffs to aid in her pursuits.  She explained the situation that lied ahead in the Estates.  In a torrent of tears she explained that a group of adventurers attempted to take control of the General's room in the basement, but were quickly overpowered which caused a tremendous stampeding train of undead to the exit of the Estate.  "Aye, but what of my comrades at the Altar?" I asked.  She said she had no knowledge of their status and bid me to hurry in to help.   I ran to the entrance as fast as I could.<P>Immediately upon entering I was struck with the smell and the sound of death all around.  Bodies were strewn along the path amongst the bones of several of the undead skeletons they were able to destroy.  The smell of rotting flesh was enough to close my nostrils to this invasion of the spirit.  Things did not look well.  I continued past the fountains now flowing with the blood of my comrades and kicked open the double front doors of the house.  I could hear the wails of some werebat, intended no doubt to cast any warrior into uncontrolled shivers which would incapacitate him just long enough for this despicable creature to carve a deathly wound.  Just as I entered, a dry bones skeleton attacked from the side.  I didn't have time to play with this boney enemy, so I rooted the heathen and used my spells of wrath and smite to cut him down without his even touching this cleric.  I found the secret basement entrance hidden behind the library bookshelf.  One needed only pull a certain volume out of its place to open these hidden doors.  On this occasion I noted that the book happened to be something about Cajun Cooking by some Chef Emeril Lagasse.  I proceeded down the stairs wondering what this person's next line of work would be.   Surely, no one would go for this so called Cajun cooking.  Off the stairs and down the cornering hallway I ran.  I could hear it.  Yes!  They were alive yet!  I was not too late.  <P>I reached the final staircase which overlooked the Altar room.  There my comrades were toe to toe with several skeletons and a monstrous and ugly hag.  I quickly surveyed the situation and hailed them so that I could be added to the group where our combined fighting power would naturally be enhanced as we complemented each other in skill and training.  We had a single warrior, a druid, a wizard and a fellow guildmate and cleric Anagar!  Anagar had done a fine job keeping the group alive, but I noted he was wounded and unable to continue his healing from sheer exhaustion.  The warrior had found his beserker strength and was dealing out tremendous damage to one of the barbed bones.   The druid was out of mana and had resorted to hacking away at the hag with his shining blade.  The wizard had joined in the fray as well.  I immediately healed my good friend Anagar who smiled appreciatively.  I then healed the warrior and took him off of death's doorstep.  Anagar sent a heal to the wizard and to the druid.  He was once again out of mana, but the tide of battle was turning in our favor.  I sent a spell of wrath that obliterated the ugly hag.  I said to the group..."we are not yet at full strength...we need a 6th fighter to fully take advantage of group tactics!"  The wizard joined in and said there was a  female ranger and barbarian warrior who both just entered the estates and were eager to join the fray.  At this point, a clammor of chains and swords arose from above the altar as the General himself came running in on our weakened group.   At his side were 2 Tentacles of Terror and not one, but two more of the despicable hags!  We were doomed I thought unless we could get help down here immediately.  We all took to attacking the General while I implored our leader to get the warrior down here NOW!  I dispelled my final heal on the druid who was taking heavy damage.  I was out of mana and then I heard our leader exclaim...."I invited the ranger"   NO!!  We were surely doomed.<P>PART III<P>Without mana, I was left with only my staff to help fend off this horrendous enemy.  But I would not run.  A cleric's duty is to be the final one out.  But no one was running.  The group was intent on destroying these invaders.  I joined in the fray against the general.  Meanwhile, our wizard found enough mana to dispel one of the despicable hags with but two spells.  Yet the other hag was now attacking the wizard. One blast sent him flying backwards, up against the side of the alter.  I could not stop my attack on the general to help...the general had to die at all costs.  Before the wizard could gather his wits, I saw him take another blast from the hag.  This one caused his knees to buckle and he knelt there dazed by the powerful spells draining his life away.  Then suddenly, a Tentacle Terror blasted the poor fellow clear across the room where he smacked the wall and then crumpled lifeless to the cold floor.  A great sadness came over me as I watched my dear friend die in front of me, unable to help.   By this time, enough mana had regenerated that I could send a stun to the general.  For a brief moment we were free to hack away at the demon as he stood there helpless to defend himself.  <P>Suddenly however, I felt the sharp sting of steel against my back.  I turned around to find the hag had impaled me with her dagger, and my muscles were weakening, my heart racing to keep up with the pain.  I turned to strike her and suddenly felt the effect of her life draining spell.  I yelled in pain as my knees buckled and I could not find the strength to stand.  Out of the corner of my eye, I could see the druid fall to the ground with one last gasp for breath.  We were surely doomed...our lifelong ambition to dispel the invaders of this mansion were failing fast.  I had let the group down.  I had failed in the duties bestowed upon me by my parents whom I had never met.  My step parents could not possibly know the pain I was in at that moment, so far away on Erud's Crossing.  Surely if they were here beside me, all would be different.  I was ready to meet the deity who failed to give me enough strength to defeat these vile creatures of the night.<P>"DON'T MAKE me cut CHOOOO" came the cry I heard from above!  I immediately stopped thinking of death and turned to see the most radiant, the most beautiful creature ever to adorn this estate charging down the stairs.  For a brief moment it was as if there were no enemies to fight, there was no death permeating the stale air of this dungeon alter, there was just the beauty instilled by this lovely elf now entering the room with the charge of a cannon ball.  I noted with pleasure that if I were to die, at least it would be with my eyes on the beauty of this strange ranger rather than the ugliness of the haggard woman so intent on taking my life.   Her name was Shaniqua.  She literally pounced on the hag.  With swords in each hand, she barely missed a beat as she tore into the beast with both blades finding their mark.  All I could see was the flash of steel as blow after blow after blow landed and delivered it's deathly purpose.  I heard her yell with each strike, then she would kick the hag as if taught by some Tae kwon do master.  These attacks had the desired effect.  The hag turned her attention to this ranger, but it was too late for her.  With grand style not often seen among rangers, Shaniqua literally cut the hag to pieces.  But without a moment to compose herself, she immediately tore into one of the Tentacle Terrors and proceeded to bludgeon the beast.  My strength began to return.  I sat, mesmerized by the scene in front of me.  This delicate looking Shaniqua was turning the tide of battle in our favor.  Anagar had managed to get off another heal on the warrior and the general was looking pale!  Meanwhile the clamor of sword striking sword,  the cries of pain from all of us filled the alter and sent other adventurers running for the zone.  Aye!  Anagar was blasted by the other tentacle and now unable to continue once again.  The warrior was gaining the edge on the general however, while Shaniqua was taking damage in her lone fight against the tentacle.  I suddenly realized that my mana had regenerated sufficiently for one heal.  With all the energy I could muster, I slowly rose to my feet and sent the healing spell to this mystical ranger who had surely saved my life.  And just as I noted the heal had its effect, the Tentacle sighed loudly and moved no more.  But just as suddenly, the last tentacle moved secretly behind me and again I felt the sting of steel cutting into my flesh.  I  felt my life blood falling to the floor as I again felt my knees ready to buckle.  I could not remain standing as I slowly sank to the floor.  Shaniqua immediately attacked the Tentacle with both swords again at blazing speed.   The warrior struck the general with a final critical blow<BR>and before he hit the floor dead, the warrior was also on the Tentacle.  But the vermin still had me in its sights.  Again the force of steel against flesh was met with pain and the realization that this time there was no turning it back.  I was about to fall to the floor when I suddenly felt the arms of an embrace.   There she was.  I managed to open my  eyes to the most beautiful sight in all the world.  It was Shaniqua holding me, preventing the sudden thud of my brain against the hard brick floor.  Her eyes were like stars in the sky, peering down from overhead.  Surely I must have died and this is one of god's own angels holding me now I thought.  Our eyes met.  For a brief second in time, it was as if untold hours and days and years of thoughts and desires were exchanged between us.  No words were needed,  yet we both knew.  There was an instant bond between us on this fateful day.  Regardless how short a time we were to be together.  With a sigh, I felt my eyes slowly closing.  With all the strength of all my spider brethren, I could not keep them open, even with the enticement of this most beautiful woman tenderly holding me now in her arms.  Her hand wiped away the grime and blood from my forehead.  All at once there was a rush of silence all around.  The fighting had stopped.  The air cleared from its heavy musty state and the cold temperature of the basement was suddenly an engulfing warmth that I had never felt before.  There was song in the air.  I knew that no matter what happened, my heart would go on.  I was now part of her forever.  I opened my eyes wide once more to see the beautiful ranger, now looking as if about to cry, and I managed to touch her hand with mine, to somehow reassure her that everything was fine...as I closed my eyes with a final sigh that seemed to end the song that was floating through my ears.    <P>Prologue<P>Rolling and turning, over and over, spinning and spinning, constantly moving in seemingly endless circles.  Caught in some unknown force, not a breath to be had.  Everything out of focus as if peering through the most ornate crystal.  I was swimming, I was running, I was tumbling uncontrollably.  Light forces entering around me, dancing in a thousand colors as this prism prison sent the light into an explosion of color surrounding me.  No balance could be had, nor any comprehension of what this experience was.  I had no control at all as I spun and tumbled in my confines.  It was as if I was in a slow motion world, while I myself was moving faster than the light that penetrated.  And still I felt the world turning over and over and over.  What was this pool of refreshment that covered my soul, I wondered.  And yes, it was my soul, not the body that had sheltered it for all my years.  My very soul was caught in this tempest of motion and fluid, bathed in colorful light and in what was in all respects, a very physical embodiment of a very non-physical emotion.  Love was all around.  It permeated the senses and  became one with my mind and the spirit.  It was an ecstasy filling me to capacity and spilling out into my entrapment.  It....was my entrapment.  My mind began to flutter with a great speed, with a great need.  Images racing through,  were they real?   Was it me?  To the crossroads of Butcherblock, hand in hand, meeting as lovers and friends....to the far away islands of pirates and camping on the beach in paradise tents, to the shores of some great moon-lit lake,  beholding an image of some great inspiring love held in my arms for the first time ever.  Crossing great distances in the tenderest of moments to touch a gentle love in reassurance, sharing the pain and the hope and the dream of one so dear and so far away.  The loving image of a half worn inscription deep in the mines of this great land, and the still greater love that inspired the inscription, running hand in hand through forests and desserts and across great expanses, never alone and feeling secure and protected.  What was this experience?  And still this world would not stop it's turning and tumbling....sending me to dizzying splendor.  I could not move, yet I moved fast and slow at the same time.  Sounds were muffled yet I could hear a mourning.  A mourning for a love lost before it yet had the time to root and grow and be nourished.  Yet I was not sad....I was jubilant with the apprehension that all of my thoughts were of a time to come, not of things long past.  And then it happened....<P>The tear slowly fell from her eye and briefly traced a path across Shaniqua's cheek and I felt myself falling and falling still trapped in my world of light and love.  Suddenly it stopped abruptly and my world exploded with a shattering loud enough to hide the sun and the skies.  My soul was once again free.  Freed by the love of one so dear,  a love that came from this instant bond we shared in meeting at this place called the alter.  My soul once again entered the body of this cleric whose forehead I was standing upon. The tear had left a small clearing, washing away the grime and the blood that had smattered upon him.  I immediately felt a rush of coldness, quickly followed by the delicious warmth of arms that protected me.  It was her.  She was still here, waiting for me, this Shaniqua, this love of my life.  She knew all along.  She knew I would not leave her.  I blinked.  I open my eyes and we meet in a sightful embrace once again.  The smile we share with each other brings light to this dreary room, and the music returns once again.  We gaze upon each other and we know we will be together for the rest of all eternity in this land of Norrath.  <BR>
