It seems to be almost common knowledge that any druid or wizard that can port is automatically a rude, sniveling, and money-grubbing jerk. However, if you find that you are having trouble getting a port, it could be you that is the problem.<P>As a Level 50 wizard with several alternate characters that cannot port themselves around, I understand the pain and urgency associated with the perceived need to get a port, especially when your corpse is laying in a zone that is so far away from your bind point, that if you end up having to run/boat to it, you will have eaten through all your playing time for the day and have to log soon after you reach your corpse if not before you reach it. In this frustrating scenario, you essentially will have not advanced your character, but instead will have regressed your character due to the loss of experience associated with dieing<P>Now you return to your bind point, naked and perhaps even a little angry for having died, and knowing the frustrating down time ahead of you to get your corpse back. You do a /who all wizard/druid and begin immediately with… ‘can you port me plz.’<P>To your horror, you begin to notice that 95% of your tells have gone ignored, especially by the higher level porters. Those that do respond reply with a terse, “no I’m busy.” The frustration begins to build and the notion that porters are evil scumbags that sit in ivory towers entrenches itself deeper in your mind.<P>Finally, you get a reply that someone is willing to port you. But deep in the white wash of your current disgust about the entire situation, you show little to no gratitude. In fact, it is not soon after the gracious porter agrees to port you that the porter finds out you are not physically near the port-in site of the nearest zone, such as a wizard pyramid or druid rings. Then, after telling the porter that you are on your way to the port site (and failing to tell him/her where you are running from to give him/her some idea of how long it will be until you get there) you realize that there are actually a couple of items you might as well pick up from your bank or an NPC vendor, so you inform the porter of the impending delay of your arrival so that you can carry out your forthcoming transactions. Of course, to carry out the transactions you would like to do will take you in the opposite direction of where the wizard/druid is, so you then bark at them to meet you where you are headed.<P>By now, understandably, most wizards/druids will have retreated into what you would call, ‘their ivory towers’ and renege on their prior offer to help you out. And because your own disgust about the whole situation has become far disproportionate to the reality of your experience, you curse the name of the wizard/druid for seemingly having disappeared from the face of Norrath, while perhaps deep (DEEP) down you are perplexed by their behavior.<P>And the tragedy of this whole scenario is what occurs on the other side of the fence. And that is the notion that porters must struggle with, which is that non-porters are a bunch of needy, whiney, indifferent, and downright unappreciative little heathens that expect, no, that demand others to address their needs at a moments notice or forever be frowned upon. <P>So for those of you that need a port, whether its because you want to hook up with some friends on the other side of Norrath, or because your corpse is sitting at the bottom of some dungeon 50 zones away, here are some tips:<P>1)	Understand that wizards/druids are players too. If they are not currently dedicating time to porting people around, they are most likely in the middle of some activity. Be courteous if your request will interrupt that activity. Hell, take a leap of faith and just be courteous no matter what.<P>2)	When you request a port, be ready to port at that moment. In other words, don’t ask for a port unless you are ready to go. Make sure you have done all your shopping before you ask for a port. Make sure you are at a wizard pyramid/spires/platform or a druid ring so that you make it convenient for the wizard/druid to get to you. Do these things BEFORE you ask for a port. Sometimes I get the feeling that once I have agreed to port someone, that person feels as if they have ‘secured’ my services and that I will just simply wait around until they are good and ready to leave. This is rude, don’t do that. If you are going to ask for help from a porter, have respect for their playing time by thinking beyond your needs and keeping their time in mind.<P>3)	Understand that ports are not like having someone buff you. It requires the porter to physically travel with you. This means that after your port is all well and done and you have already begun the process of forever forgetting the person that just ported you, they are probably still trying to get back to wherever it was they left so they could port you. The main idea here is that the porting process takes twice as much time for the porter as it does the portee. Respect that and take it into consideration when you are turned down for a port for the billionth time.<P>4)	When you get a port, offer something. It doesn’t need to be platinum or some item. It could be just a simple thank you and a /bow. In fact, you will find that when you are in dire circumstances, most porters won’t mind if you can’t offer anything materialistic anyway. That’s because all players can empathize with a bad turn of events. I can’t tell you how many times I have ported people who were allegedly in, ‘desperate need of a port’ who upon arrival of their requested destination simply disband and run off without even a simple thank you. In order to avoid succumbing to the generalization that most players are unappreciative little pricks, I keep a nice little spreadsheet going with names of players that have done this to me. You can be sure that I am in my highest ivory tower when I hear you shouting across the zone in gfay that your corpse is in a pit in Velketor’s Laboratory in Velious. That’s right, I’m one of those rude wizard jerks that won’t respond to your tells pleading to me that you need my help badly. Sucks doesn’t it?<P>That’s it. Simple really.<P>--------------------<P>Nepti Orlandrel, Wizard Of The 50th Season, Povar

My big pet peeve is people that shout "Need a port" or "Anyone porting" in a zone.<P>Specify a location, dammit.  When shout say that you need a port to NK, or IC, or wherever the heck you're going.  It will increase your chances of getting a port immeasurably.  Some wizards and druids aren't high enough level to port everywhere, so then they have to ask you where you're going, you have to reply, then they have to tell you whether or not they can port there.  There are also wizards and druids that don't have Kunark or Velious, I'm sure.<P>Also, if you really want to get to BB but GFay will work as well (Or any similar situation), specify that in your shout.  I see people yelling for a port to BB all the time, and I'm sure GFay would work almost as well, but if they don't say "BB or GFay" then I don't bother asking.

Tips from a non porting class, who never has all that much difficulty getting a port (just added tips from the other perspective)<P>1.  Don't spam the zone you are in for a port continuously, especially the zone does not have a portal.  Believe it or not, Porting classes don't wait in every zone for a person to port.  Announce once, politely, that you seek a port <to a destination> and continue your travel to a zone with a portal.  If you are in a zone with a portal, /shout ing once every 5 seconds is a good way to make it to /ignore lists.<P>2.  Be polite, always, first and foremost.  I have several characters, and I did a test once.  I had one on, and /shouted the usual "need port plz" thing in zone, several times, and eventually added, "need port plz, paying" to it.  It took a goodly amount of time, and cost me 20 Plats.  I then logged a different character, and /shouted my request, politely, as in "Stranded <class name> seeks a Port to <zone>, please /tell if you are willing or have time, thank you".  I was ported, for free, inside of 2 minutes, and had to turn down 2 other porters that sent me tells.  Not conclusive, I know, but it does make a difference.<P>3.  Try to offer something.  The person has taken away from their play time to make yours better.  Ask if donations are accepted, and if they are, donate.  If the person says donations are optional, donate as well.  At the very minimum, you should be offering your sincere thanks to the person.  Another thing I do is add them to my friends list, at least for a time, and send them a tell down the road, maybe in a few days, thanking them again.  Be sincere, however.  Druids and Wizards have a keen sense of being sucked up to.<P>4.  Be flexible.  Your porter may need to port others to different zones than the one you need to get to.  Even if they port to 4 other zones before yours, be quiet and enjoy the ride.  The Ocean of Tears isn't all that pretty that you want to see it more than you have to, right?<P>5.  Keep in mind that you don't ever NEED a port.  You may want one badly, but you never, really, actually NEED one except in the very most extreme and dire circumstances.  This being said, no one actually owes it to you, by virtue of chosen profession, to port you.  It's a service, just as Clarity or a Heal is.  And those classes don't owe you those buffs either, and although you may 'need' a heal at times, you never need Clairty.<P>6.  Unless you are in these dire straights, try if you can to avoid /telling a porter with a request to port you.  If you must use /tell, be ready for rejection, and don't be angry when you receive one.  Because you will be rejected using /tell to ask for a Port.<P>7.  Did I mention be polite, always?  I think I did, but I can't stress it enough.  So, be polite, please  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>Ports are out there, waiting for you.  But remember, you may have to ride the boat someday, it's what we all did, back when porters were few and far between  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>Fhyre Stohrm<BR>58 Mage<BR>Bertox

LOL JohnnyC yes that is another effective way to go about it I suppose hehehe.<P>And thanks to those of you that responded. And for the record, I practice what I preach. If I ask for a clarity, I go to them, I offer them a donation. If I'm medding because I got spanked badly and only have a bubble of hp left, and some kind shaman passes by and heals my, I heartily thank them for taking the time.<P>Like anything else, it's a two-way street. I suppose my four steps could be applied to anything, not just porting.<P>--------------------<P>Nepti Orlandrel, Wizard Of The 50th Season, Povar

I think part of the problem stems from the deterioration of parenting abilities in the past 30 years in America. Parents seem to have gotten the misguided notion that giving their children all of the things they didn't have growing up, is good for their children. The end result is often times a child which is selfish, disrespectful, and unable to cope socially due to what is perceived by most others as very rude behavior. Parents of a strict upbringing can also have the tendency to be more lenient on their children. Using the rationale of "I don't want my kids resenting me like I resented my Mother/Father". They fall into a role more like a best friend, rather than a parent or guardian. This upbringing also lends itself to a child that can be described as "Does not play well with others". Of course, this is in my opinion, and by no means intended to be a blanket statement.<P>Also, the anonymity factor that the game provides often facilitates behavior in individuals that they wouldn't normally do in real life. What do they care if they piss someone off that they will never meet face to face? They are on your /ignore list? Most likely they could care less.<P><BR>Troy

I can't disagree. Being polite should be common sense.  Of course, there's precious little sense which is actually common.<P>I'll add my own spin on things, though.<P>Just as many a player of the (*cough*cough*)  class, as well as the (*cough*cough*) class, has said that complete heal should never have been put into the game, I think that <I>port</I> spells should also have never been put into the game.<P>CH (pre +aggro and various other fairly recent things) ensured clerics a lock on high end group spots.  Meaning that one player had an unfair playability advantage over most other players.  This is essentially correct, the painful path of the cleric not with-standing.<P>Ports also instill certain players with an unfair playability advantage.  <P>One person having the ability to go from Erudin to Feydwer in a handful of seconds, while others have to take two ships and run the length of a continent in between, is one hell of an advantage.  <P>So is the ability to port to friendly NPCs so you can sell off your heavy loot, then gate back to where you were fighting.  All in the span of a few minutes, as opposed to other casters having to run all the way to town then gate back, and melees having to run <I>both</I> ways.<P>People <I>should</I> be polite.  In game, I always try to be.  But running from zone to zone trying to find the single port-able class member who is willing to save you an hour or two of travel time gets old very fast.<P>Advantages <I>that</I> big should only be given to the highest level players if, indeed, they should be given out at all.<P>BTW: As you prepare to flame or rebut me, you might also keep in mind that my first thought when seeing this topic was <I>"Oh, <B>great</B>.  Another port class b!tch session about how hard it is to have one of the greatest spells in the game"</I>.

Porting Etiquette 101:<P>1. Be polite.<P>2. Respect that the druid/wizard is also trying to hunt for loot/experience. (So do not pester them with tells saying, Are you done yet?)<P>3. Be ready to go at that moment you ask for a port. (I had some warrior ask me to pick him up in WC and when I arrived he said hold one one more kill... I waited 10 minutes!! Most people would have left already... I even ported him for free and no thank you   <IMG SRC="frown.gif" border="0"> ).<P>4. A kind gesture is all that I ask in exchange.<P>5. If you are not in a zone with a wizzie spire or druid ring try to at least meet me halfway.<P>6. And please know your destination... I do not know every single zone and its surrounding zones yet. Also when I see "Plz, seeking port to BB." the only port I know of is Butcherblock NOT Blackburrow!<P><BR><sigh> These instances, though rare, have actually occurred.<P>--------------------<P>Kyarra Kyndheart<BR>Druid of 38th Season<BR>Phoenix Order-Long may she burn!!<BR>Drinal<P>Alts:<BR>Hildy 13th season halfling rogue<BR>Enkarra a high elf cleric-7th<BR>Zrae Dark elf enchantress lvl 4<BR>Maltika Gnome Magician of 3rd casting

Quandary I actually agree with you. I think in-game transportation mechanisms, besides boats, should have been made part of the in-game infrastructure, like the teleports in Asheron's Call.<P>But this thread isn't really debating that. And while you might interpret this as a flame (because it seems from your post that you expect one), I'm not complaining about my porting spells.<P>Just in case anybody else has missed the point, I'm suggesting better ways for non-porters to get a port when they need one. <P>Again, I didn't post here to complain about being able to port.<P>It urks me too when I watch E! or some other show where gorgeous models complain about how tough their lives are in the modeling world.<P>--------------------<P>Nepti Orlandrel, Wizard Of The 50th Season, Povar

In response to alot of the points raised here:<P>Porting is a pain in the ass to everyone concerned.  I have played both a druid and a warrior so I know both sides.<P>If you are a porter... the requests for ports become intrusive when you get random requests like "u port me to wc ok?" which get annoying very quickly.  I also found after a while even the nicest requests where annoying due to the fact that porting required 2 zonings and some running (based on where I was bound).  With a slow connection the porting could take upwards of 10 min.  I don't have alot of time to play eq constantly with RL commitments so to drop everything when I'm trying to have fun is quite annoying. (hence the good use for the /anon)<P>From a melee standpoint.... Even worse that being a porter.  I know that I never liked to be hastled for ports so I don't send /tell s to people I don't know.  Auctioning for a port is about the best way I've found to get a port from say DL to WC.  The money I pay for ports doesn't really bother me ( I just collect FS in a tink bag), it's the wasted time.  <BR>In all reality no one really should be taking the boat post 50.  Let's face it.  From dreadlands to Freeport is a good 90 min if you run and boat and boat.  I believe this to be a huge abuse of any person's real life time.  We drive 2x in rush hour traffic to get to work, do we really want communting time in eq?   <IMG SRC="rolleyes.gif" border="0"> <P>The solution?  NPC porters.  These should be located at the druid/wizzy rings to port players for pp.. I know that some people will get mad and say that this is robbing them of a class defining ability but in all reality it wouldn't.  Afterall they are putting in purchasable Jboots now so porting isn't such a bad idea.

My biggest tip for people seeking ports...<BR>If you're in the Dreadlands shouting for 30 minutes that you need an Evac to EJ (for a sebilis hunt) realize that it will only take you 20 minutes to actually run there.<P>It's always boggled my mind how some will shout over and over for 30 minutes for a port when they could run there in less time.  DL to EJ, WC to NK and so on.<P>Please oh, please never tell a wizard/druid how they can port you.  It is not your place to tell someone where to bind.  <P>No, chances are that wizard or druid is not going to port you out of Tim's Deep.

Excellent adivse, however, its way, way too late for me. I only port friends and guildmates, and THATS it. (Ive exprienced one too many rude peeps)<P>Im usually not mean about it, and will answer with a "mayhapse you should find a younger druid/wizard. Im sure they will be more than happy to port you for that fee." <P>Now that dosent mean, you shouldnt ask, and if asked politly and if you are right there with me, and your obviously on a CR (you are naked), then I MAY port. This however is the exception, not the norm.<P>Yes, Im one of those people that wont port, no matter what. Be prepared for people like me. Getting mad and calling me a ***** WONT help. Trust me on that. Offering me 10 or 20 or 100 pp wont make any difference. For some one that has spent nearly 6k on tailoring your money means very little to me.<P>Dragana<BR>52 Wanderer<BR>Bertoxx

Dragana it's because your experiences that I posted here. I'm quickly becoming jaded as well. I'm posting this message on several EQ boards as sort of a last ditch effort before I get 'pushed too far' too.<P>Clearly, your position is understandable.

Having a level 52 druid i know the pains of porting first hand.  I also have a 40 enchanter and when i play him I would never not pay for a port, i always offer at least 50pp.  If i'm going to waste someone elses time to taxi me around. then im going to give them something return.<P>Remember you can go anywhere in the game without using ports, so when you ask someone else to port you, you are doing a tradeoff, using thier time to save you time.  you OWE them.<P>Even if a druid/wizard refused payment from me i would find some otherway to help them out, or remember them so i can do something for them later.<P>In reality its the person who asks for a free port that is being greedy, he is taking without giving.<P>Thats the bottom line to getting a port IMO.  Give something in return for the service they are providing. whether it be plat or some other means

I certainly understand the frustrations of porters and can empathize with them.<P>I posted on these boards about the friendliess that seems to have left EQ.  What I would like to tell you fine porters is that there are still many nice, friendly people out there who are VERY grateful to get a port.<P>I, and the warriors like me, would like to say please don't get too jaded yet.   <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">  There are some of us left who do not send tells, do not spam a zone and always pay, bow and thank you for the port and your time.<P>--------------------<P>Mosephus Scroungetale<BR>41st Season Warrior of Kaladim<BR>Long Live Eagles Eye!<BR>Rodcet Nife

The most annoying thing I've found about being a porting class, is how many people ask me for a port (I'm only level 26). If you're going to ask for a service, at least know which people to ask. I do, however, look forward to being able to help out by porting people when the time comes.<P>Esse  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>--------------------<P>Esseilte Blacstaff<BR>Guardians of Magic<BR>Druidess of Tunare and Happiest Woman in all of Norrath!

Well Quandary I certainly agree with your point of view as I experience it myself whenever I'm on with one of my alts.<P>I'm not sure where this vicious circle started, but all I know is it is perpetuated by rudeness and indifference to services rendered.<P>As a lowly L15 enchanter, I have yet to get a free port from a wizard or druid.

Peyo, have you ever made that run from DL to EJ? Don't forget that you are a tank who does not have SOW, invis or levitation, cannot see in the dark and cannot gate if trouble? Even the 10 minute run from Karnors to Druid ring can be very deadly-especially if you run into gorenaire.<P>Ok, maybe its easier to ask for SOW than to port. None the less, if I wanted to run to Skyfire from DL-I'd rather take a port.

Hmm...All I can say is that my druid doesn't charge, but the other side is that I won't do go out of my way to port anyone. Meaning that if I am going that way, then I will give someone asking port a free ride.  Don't ask nor do I accept payment.  Unless it is a ddruid only spell.  But that time I was on my cleric and he offered a 53 spell I needed for my druid.<P>But as far as my warrior is concerned, he rides the boat.  Having been a porter, I don't like to ask anyone to take their time to port me unless they just offer it.  I won't refuse if they offer it.  The only other ports I get are from guildies that offers, Again, I usually won't ask unless it is an emergency having had xperience of being a porter within a guild.<P>Tindalus

I completely agree that people should be polite and considerate. <P>Of course, I hope that people who play teleporting classes are considerate of those who cannot travel across continents in the blink of an eye. I'm happy to say that there are many such people who are.<P>Making players the only means of teleportation was a bad decision on Verant's part.

More food for thought...<P>How many times have you seen someone /shout "Looking for evac to EJ" in dreadlands for oh 30 minutes?<P>I am amazed because that evac only saves you 1/2 a zone (check if you don't believe me). Plus they don't count the time it takes the druid to run to the nearest dungeon from the druid ring in dreadlands (you need to run to Karnors).<P>My character is bound in the dreadlands right next to the FV zone tunnel. I could "run" to sebilis in the time it takes to get an evac to EJ.  Lets assume the druid is at the ring, he will need to run to KC, and zone into KC before he can even evac!<P>And for what? Barely 1 zone? (I dont count all of FV zone since the tunnel exit from dreadlands is almost 1/2 way to the zone (just hug the left wall upon exit).<P>People are lazy *grin*<P>I once watched a newbie shout for SoW. He was at felwith and claimed he needed SoW for a corpse run to crushbone.  (Man did he get flamed)
