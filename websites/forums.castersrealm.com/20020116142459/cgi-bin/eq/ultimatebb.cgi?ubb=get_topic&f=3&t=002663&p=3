<I>Most of what I have to say on this has already been covered. To the whiners: sod off, casters can solo to 60 better than anyone else. These changes are aimed at the high end raiding crowd, and are very much needed.</I><P>That's crap. Melees are already more versatile and useful than casters. They didn't need a power increase as much as casters did.<P>The benefits casters provide, I acknowledge - raids aren't much fun without c2 and haste, or a mage to CoH latecomers, or a necro to feed mana to the clerics.<P>How much fun dyou think those people have? I can solo to 60, sure...And when I get there I get the joy of going on a raid and casting 3 spells the entire time (c2, haste, tashanian)? Awesome. Thanks a bunch, that's really what I wanted as the culmnation of my EQ career.<P>Agro management requires skill and coordination. FD pulling requires skill and coordination. Healing requires skill and coordination. <P>Perfecting these things can take a while, and keep you on the edge of your seat, enjoying every minute of 30-40 people coordinating carefully to keep agro on one person and to keep that person alive while still dealing maximum damage to the monster. <P>Sitting on my ass for seven hours and casting the same 3 spells over and over again requires a good book to read, and, preferably, a second computer so I can surf the internet to read posts about other casters *****ing about the same thing.<P>Don't get me wrong, these changes are great. I hope a few of you melees have second computers to play the wizard required to port you to the raid (and DB/GB to finish mobs), the enchanter required to buff you all, and the mage to CoH in the latecomers. Because I, for one, am leveling up my monk twink.<P>Regardless of how powerful or useful I am, I play this game to have fun. To be challenged, to defeat epic monsters. When all I do is haste everyone and c2 everyone, I may be accounting for 45% of the raid's damage, but I don't enjoy any of it.<P>BTW, PvPers, I feel for you. Gotta suck to always be getting the shaft with regards to balance in a portion of the game that is so much fun.<P>--------------------<P>Branar Shmanar<BR>60 Enchanter<BR>The Seventh Hammer

All I want to know is this...Does someone high up at Verant have a ranger?  Triple attack?  They already deal out more damage than a warrior.  You say they are taking too much damage?  Well no kidding, the one hitting the fastest and doing the most damage usually does.  You fix this by giving them triple attack AND more defense?  This is the only thing any of the classes had on em was defense and now you're giving them that too, while the warriors who are trained in fighting don't even have triple attack.  And what about the poor pally's and sk's?  My gosh, if you're going to help some classes look into these guys.  Casters?  Well, who needs nukers anymore?  <P>I always go back to the old saying, 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it'.  Rangers have been getting perks for over a year now.  Every patch seems to have something for them and I for one am sick of it.  Sure, I could start over and play a ranger, but what about all that time I and countless others have spent working their way up to 50 only to have all the same advantages of our certain class given to rangers.  The only disadvantage rangers will have after this ridiculous change is that you have to be a wood elf, half elf, or human.  <P>PVP?  Rangers and monks are already about the best PVP melee around.  Rangers can root, dot, nuke and then use their damn bow discipline to kill you while you're stuck in one spot.<P>Well, let me just point out one thing before this change is made.  Once you give rangers triple attack, they're going to be getting hit even more because of the aggro they're going to get.  My solution...give them quadruple attack and raise their defense more.  Yeah, that oughta do it.<P>Verant, please leave well enough alone.  Fix the paladins and sk's if you're going to fix something.  When's the last time you heard someone say, ohhh, grab a pally, we could really use his healing and flash of light?  These classes are melee and don't even have double attack.  But I digress. <P>My apologies, I'm just really sick and tired of rangers.  Whiniest class in EQ imho.<P>--------------------<P>Kildurin Dawning<BR>Paladin of Terris Thule

note to branar : don't complain on how fun it is for u without thinking about the other classes <BR>haye, skil and coordination : first, melees, oh, that is much more interesting to have to hit the auto-attack key , then after that , only having to chain hit taunt and kick/bash/otherability button, you really think it is funnier than ur work ? <BR>now, clerics, who MUST always be sitting , all their life long , to have the mana to heal the tanks, and all they have to do is stand up at the good time, cast a spell between two or three, sit down and wait , they always need to be raeady, they can't even read a book like u do !<BR>and finally , you who say more important is fun, why u play EQ , if u don't have fun ??<P>myself , i still have fun , not really fighting : u just see how boring it can be , but a lot of other aspects : u are not in a multiplayer game for nothing !<P>--------------------<P>Sylviania Delaforet<BR>Ranger of Tunare, The Mother Of All

Woo hoo! I am a paladin on Lanys. This news is WONDERFUL!<P>After browsing through a lot of the posts here, I can see that a lot of you people who have complained about this topic don't live and breath as a paladin or SK...<P>Warriors aren't being nerfed. That's the most moronic statement here. Nothing at all is changing about warriors. I'm sure your horrendously powerful disciplines, goofy STR and HP, ridiculous selection of weapons, and other advantages will get you through those cold lonely Norrath nights. :P<P>What is happening here is that paladins and shadowknights will FINALLY be reasonable substitutes for other melee classes! We might *actually* be able to cause significant amounts of damage to a target, now!<BR>Many of you people obviously have no idea how frustrating it is to see screens full of misses and occasional hits for 30's with epic weapons, and have that be NORMAL for you.<P>Casters, you aren't being nerfed. I'd still love to see a non-zerg-like raid go anywhere without clerics, druids, shamans, magicians, enchanters, or wizards. (Sorry, necros...)<P>Keep in mind, there are MANY powerful spells being released with Luclin that will add to your usefulness tenfold. Anti-Summoning Shield, the Silence spells, etc. etc....<BR>The new enchanter spells also compliment these improved melee abilities rather well, with taunt procs and such. <P>People, your lives will be better because of this. Nobody is going to be out of work all of the sudden simply because a few skill points get added here an there.<P>Everybody (that I saw) downing this idea really doesn't know what they're talking about. You must be the same people who talked about giving paladins pets and warriors the Gate skill and ridiculous things like that in the Class Talk threads earlier this year...<P>Verant, I'm glad you all finally realized that the 50-60 game is seriously scrooged for hybrid classes, and are going to change it! THANK YOU!<P>I love these upgrades! Woo hoo!!

I play a ranger.  I as well as many are not happy with the changes VI has made.  If you read our boards you would see very few if ANY asking for offensive cap increases or triple attacks.  <P>We were and are very happy with our dmg output.  We have been asking, no begging for more defense, better dodge, and improved archery.  <P>Oh well, at least they did good on the moveing up of SOW and enhancing track  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0">.  <P>I can see why warriors are upset when VI gives us equal offense and now triple attack.  It's not what rangers have been asking for!!  It just means we can build agro that much more and die that much faster!!

Seriously, there are way too many people with class envy here who see that an improvement to another class is a setback for their class.  As someone else said, these changes are being looked into to set things more in line with the way things worked PRE LEVEL 50.  Monks are supposed to be one of the best in melee damage perhaps only being outdone by some high damage backstabs by a rogue.  Everyone knows that Rangers get taken down way too easily and for many reasons.  A defense cap raise to 210 at level 60 will not change a whole lot, but it will have some impact.<P>The only problem I see with all of this is a warrior's taunt skill.  They really do need an increase in taunt abilities, and with an upgrade to ranger melee skills, and 2 handed weapons, it's only going to be harder for the warrior to taunt off.<P>So please, quit thinking of yourself, and think of the betterment of your everyday life in EQ, which is your group or guild.  If I was ANY class, if that skill raise can be enough to keep that ranger alive longer, or the added damage to kill that mob quicker, everyone should be happy.

I want to say that most of the so-called concessions given to the hybrids were given due to the fact that, at least for the ranger class, they were quite out of kilter.  The ranger class was unbalanced, and to a certain degree still is.<P>What happens with the ranger class is, as they progress in level, they are also assumed to be moving up into stronger guilds that can equip them.<P>Then end result is a well equipped ranger with some uber loot helps them survive and do good damage.  The so-called consessions given them were mostly given to the mid to low end rangers.  Some minor, less then dramatic, adjustements were made to some buff spells of the high-end ranger, and the offense was increased slightly.  Overall, though the 55+ ranger noticed little increase in survivability due to these changes.<P>What makes a high end ranger really productive is their ability to obtain great gear.  This means that they need the likes of a self buffed AC in the range of 1050.  Without it they die miserably.  If they can't self-buff HP to at least 2k then they are a weakling.<P>I know this because I went from being a relatively ill-equipped ranger (in mostly TV armor and lamentations) at 54 to a very well equipped ranger at 60.  Once I got my epics and joined a large guild my game changed.  I would have continued to proceed at a dismal level of performance if I hadn't joined a large guild and received this equipment.<P>I see it every day that I participate with other rangers--those not within my guild.  I know what is causing their problems.<P>Ranger melee was the 4th best in the game or 3rd worst (however you want to look at it) even after the updates.  This left them dismally weak in AC and HP and only the 4th best damage dealer of the melee behind the rogue, monk, and warrior.<P>They paid this penalty because they were hybrids capable of spell-casting.  The problem with spell casting is that it is mana based.  Mana is finite.  The warrior disciplines were added to make up for some of this disparity.<P>So, the ranger had the 4th best damage of melee and some spells while all the other classes had better melee and their disciplines.<P>This upgrade to damage is a good one and it really helps.  It is obvious that it won't be on the same level as the warriors, monks, and rogues, due to obvious limiting factors hardcoded into the program to keep them from outdamaging comparably equipped warriors.<P>The upgrade to 210 in defense is only minor.  It should, in reality be 230, 20 more points then the proposed changes.<P>On the high end the ranger is a fantastic melee class capable of doing things that you wouldn't normally expect.  The key word here is "normally".  You have to be at the highest of the high end to be the survivor and have to have some of the best equipment.  If this doesn't happen you are a wash.<P>All in all, the changes are good.  The addition of 10 defense points will certainly help.  It may even allow me to get a 1100 cleric buffed AC.  That is still a far cry from the 1450 AC seen regularly on most warriors and knights.<P>The key is that with the increased, actually excessive AC of the warrior and knights.  They can shift their AC points lowering them in favor of some other stat such as HP.  Whereas the ranger never has this choice.  Rangers couldn't shift their AC for resist gear and be a measurable force.<P>It is sometimes difficult to see what I'm talking about unless you hit the high end and have great equipment and armor.  In my guild, we've added 2 55+ rangers since we formed the guild with a guild merger.  Both of these ranger I immediately inspected.  I couldn't help but feel some pitty on them regarding their equipment.  Seriously.  It was that bad.  But, within a month or two they had some very nice gear replacing their junk.  I fail to see how many other rangers not in large guilds would have the same gear enabling them to fight the way our rangers currently do.  Even so, we still only have 5 main rangers with only one or two active.<P>The ranger class still remains one of the few classes in the game that absolutely could be done without.  The game can be played and wouldn't be any worse off it the ranger class didn't exist.  Virtually every other class has an ability that makes the desirable in one fashion or another.  The ranger has none.  Any skill the ranger has there are 2 or more classes that also have that skill.<P>--------------------<P>Metaphisto, 60 Ranger<BR>Thryll, 57 Necro<BR>Caution, 55 Wizard<BR>Rourke, 56 Cleric<BR>Loga, 55 Bard<BR>Rhose, 52 Warrior<BR>Tiggre, 40 Beastlord<BR>The Defiant<BR>Innoruuk

btw, im not done complaining. i am beyond upset.

Personaly I think this is some kind of late april fools joke or somethin...Because i certainly hope they are not seriously considering puttin this waste of time in game.  I've all but quit EQ because of the gross imbalance between casters and melee, go look at any REALLY big guild (as in, clearin north ToV) and look at how many druids/mages/necros they have, wizards are fine for dragon/giantsbane, but the rest are useless.  And the few on my server that are invited to a big guild usualy have to make an alt or are asked to park their mage near the warders in sleepers, or at the PoM zone, woohoo fun, in which case they have to make an alt to play anyways, just what i leveled to 60 to do.  If ya look thru most big guild rosters, rogue/monk/ranger/warriors will outnumber druid/necro/mage about 10/1 and they get an upgrade?  HELLLLLO?  I meen, do they think that they outnumber us 10/1 because they are great conversationalists?  Some of the people in the big guild on my server are total newbies that have been playin the game for 2 months.  As an example a monk in that guild, when she was 55 (and a member) in june, asked me who lady vox was, is she in that guild because she's a good player and knows alot about the game?  No, because she is a damage class and knows how to hit the "A" button.  Anyone payin attention at verant over there?  Anyone still TESTING this game out or what?  I meen as exciting as standing up, nuking, being resisted, then sitting on my hands is...I think its more fun to actualy be able to hit the mob and feel somewhat useful.  Okay group is rushing big dragon guy....../afk to get dinner...Come back 10 minutes later, hey dragon is dead...all caster loot defaulted to the some-what-useful casters, wizards and enchanters, yaaaah.../camp desktop so i can CoH you all back here in a week.<P>I used to have numbers on approx. how much damage each melee class did compaired to each caster at level 60 but I can't seem to find the numbers I had, but rogues/monks/warriors, obviously rogues were the highest, then monks, then warriors, but all in the general area of 2x the average caster, in a group on normal mobs, not ones with 10000000 resist all. Now lets change monks to 12x and rangers to 3x us, yah thats class balance for ya.  Wizards are lacking in the group catagory but not in raids once they are 60.<P>People say everyone should be happy beause mobs will die easier, yah well i won't be there when they die because i'm one of the useless classes, so wtf do i care if that mob dies easier?<P>Paladin's and SKs whinin for tripple, attack, i have a paladin and even i think thats a joke as well, you have spells, remember them?  Sooo why should ya get the same damage output as other melees....raising their melee skills as long as they still don't do the same output as others is fine, but should not be near the same, should be a noticeable diffarence.<P>Looking at the changes, a level 60 monk with a Tstaff which is not too rare nowadays, with tripple attack WITHOUT the new damage crap, would outdamage a mage and his pet if the mage had unlimmited mana and was chain nuking and was never resisted, hey maybe they'll give casters unlimmited mana and a damage upgrade to balance us?  Nahh doubt it.  The reason i made a caster when this damn game came out is because casters, in every game i have ever played, were the damage classes, low defense, high damage output, right?  Nah we got laughable defense and even worse damage output.  Before kunark the game was very very balanced, casters did alot of damage and melees did their job, took the damn hits.  Now the game has turned into a one sided event where everyone is a melee class.  But hey, maybe they figure the game is bugged and if they keep buffing melee classes it'll loop around like factions used to, who knows what they are thinking.  I could go on and ***** s'more but hey, i've got better things to do then complain to the apparently deaf programmers when it comes to casters....

Wow.  Having a 56 necro, 56 Cleric, 29 Druid (port ***** in progress), and now my 23 Monk, I can see myself wanting more and more tomplay the monk.<P>I made the Necro to fit in with my playing times, and I wasn't bound to a group all the time.  My biggest thing with this isn't class envy but I feel I need to point this out.  On large target raids Necros feed mana.<P>NEVERMIND THE FACT THAT PRE 55 I NEVER FED MANA TO ANYONE.  Glad to see this is my class defining ability.  I was also glad to see that I was warned in the BoTB tournament for doing just that.  I gave mana to my opponent.  Now while everyone thought that was hilarious, the GMs did not and they exiled me from the Arena and I was warned anout my "insocial behaviour."<P>I do think that the upgrades to other classes can be a good thing, but it does limit the other classes in group desirability.<P>They need to look at all the classes across the board and make changes to all at the same time to really get a feel for how it balances the game.

As a 55 Ranger I welcome triple attack but I agree with an earlier post about jolt or cinder jolt.  I was grouped with a 55 Warrior in Sebilis a couple of days ago who was using 2 fast 1HS weapons.  I was using a lupine dagger and a green jade axe.  The Warrior was non stop taunting, bashing, and kicking and I would cast cinder jolt 4 to 6 times each mob.  The Warrior could not get the aggro off of me.  Jolt needs to work better.  As for the increase to the defensive cap I say we need more then 210.<P>--------------------<P>[img]http://www.whipsnade.freewebspace.com/images/redskywhip.jpg[/img]<BR>Ranger of the 56th Season<BR>Rogue of the 14th Season<BR>Monk of the 12th Season

They are trying to fix these classes and these are what they are trying first.  If they don't work, They will try something else.  Also, you can't tamper with all the classes and test them all at the same time.  You'll have no basis for comparison.  Please people, hold your complaints about it.  Voice what you think needs to be done not whine about it.

Well Sylviana, let me say this to you.  I am not Kildurin anymore as I moved to a different server as a warrior because paladins just plain get the shaft really.  As far as knowing what I'm talking about with rangers in PvP?  I'm in a 50+ guild that has tournaments quite often and the rangers are damn near untouchable in one on ones.  So do I know what I'm talking about?  Maybe, maybe not.  Fact remains that giving rangers triple attack and upping their defense THEN saying that the reason they're doing it is because they get hit too much?  Please explain the logic in that.  <P>If I offended you with saying that rangers are the whiniest class I'm sorry.  Just going off my personal experience from reading these forums and listening to people on EQ talk.  Rangers are always complaining about something.  I personally think the classes are fine the way they are.  If anyone needs help, it's the pally's and SK's, not the rangers.  And I hardly see how upping the damage on slow delay 2Hers is on equal par to giving triple attack and raising the defensive ability.  Just ludicrous.<P>Oh, one last note of interest.  I do have a low level ranger that is going to become my main.  If ya can't beat em, join em.  Whiniest class in EQ, here I come!!!!!!!!<P>--------------------<P>Kildurin Dawning<BR>Paladin of Terris Thule

1.) I think it's great that they are fixing inter-melee balance. Everyone knows that warriors and rogues were leaps and bounds ahead of any other melee/hybrid in terms of usefulness. This is primarily, of course, do to the fact that most hybrid spells are useless in a group.<P>2.) This further weakens casters. Enchanters won't be effected much, due to the fact that their abilities are not replaceable by a melee. But where does it leave Wizards, Mages, and Necros? The simple answer is, of course, screwed. Such is this game these days. The prime advantage of playing a mage or necro has been negated (soloability) by summoning mobs at high levels, and ultra-twinkage at lower levels. Wizards will still retain some usefulness against uber velious dragons due to the bane spells however. So one caster class gets a break at 60. Joy.<P><BR>I'm fairly certain that this will be the final straw for most casters, and I really wouldn't doubt it if most of them either jump to melees, or quit entirely. I see no point in playing a class like a wizard,necro, or mage, that does less damage, has less defense, and has no real significant soloing advantage over a melee class. The marginal "utility" spells that we have are negated by said effects (invis, levitate,etc.) can be obtained on many very easy to get items.<P>I suppose verant will finally realize this eventually, the same way that they realize now how out of whack current melee standings are. For me however, it will be far, far too late. I won't wait 6 months or a year just so that I can feel somewhat useful.<P>/boggle Verant<P>--------------------<P>Burn. Burn. die.

Speaking from a monk's perspective I say its about time.  When I originally decided to play a monk the appeal was that we were suppose to be the most damage dealing melee class developing our bodies into weapons and armor.<P>In fact, it was the original vision that our hands would be able to deal more damage than any weapon.  This was true by about 20-25% up until the release of Kunark.  I was greatly disappointed to see monks gain weapons and armor.  I expected to see more skills, feats and blessings from the gods.  For example once a monk reaches level 30 the gods bless our hands making them magical.<P>Once the level caps were raised to 60 the margin diminished from a 20-25% damage adavantage to about 5%.<P>Also I recently sold my Imbued Fighters Staff because 2 jade maces outperformed it and now that they are going to modify 2 handed weapons is going to make me wonder if I should have held on to it now.<P>IMO I feel monks should revert back to at least the 20-25% damage advantage over a warrior class.  I am hoping with the new triple attack along with the improved damage table for a monk this will restore the balance.<P>I personally think the orginal version of monks where they are unarmed and unarmored or at least lightly armored was great.  I would have liked to have seen more automatic abilities as a monk gained in levels.  I am not too particularly fond of disciplines in the way they are now.<P>I think Hand to Hand damage and Damage Reducing AC and Damage avoidance AC should rise every level.<P>Monks in most every game genre are masters of exotic powers.  Simple things would be to make the monk immune to poison, disease, increase regeneration, improved vision, faster natural travel speed, chance for attacks to autostun, the special attacks we have I think should evolve and gain special features (like stun), critical hits, only able to be harmed by magical weapons or attacks, natural increases to resistances, feign death could improve to where there is a rising chance to remain feigned when a spell lands, special attacks are a joke especially thunderkick where I almost never use it as the damage is way too erratic and hardly worth using when more than half the time a regular flying kick does better and I still have the option to use a defensive disc.  I would also like to see a monks minimum damage rise as he gains in levels.  I often see a pet consistantly quad hitting for 50 points where a monks damage can range from 1 - 70 for my level.  I would like to see the minumum damage be more like 40 - 70.<P>In anycase at least the problem with monk output damage is getting some attention as it has been overtaken by the other classes post 50.  Although Rogues have considerable more melee damage output than any other class.  I have routinely seen rogues double backstabbing as high as 500 for a single hit.  I think Backstabbing should have a high damage output but I think a monk should be more than just damage output and more attention should be payed to the fact that they are suppose to be blessed and enhanced by the gods and working on their body, mind, and spirit.

Hmmm...after reading posts about high level play and how boring it is for apparently every class (hit autoattack + taunt, cast c2 +haste, etc, etc), and think the obvious conclusion is that the high level game SUCKS. <P>I think Verant needs to return to their 6 person group roots. There is absolutely nothing epic about 40 players beating on one NPC with 32K hp for an hour. <P>It could be done...group gets a unique dungeon instance KEY. Only that group can enter that instance of the dungeon and combat epic NPC balanced to a 6 person group. Groups 2, 3, 4, ... get their own unique instances of the same dungeon. <P>Ranger triple attack is DUMB. The whole problem with rangers is that they can't survive the agro their CURRENT damage output generates. Doing anything for rangers or monks while Paladins and SKs are so unbalanced is insane. <P>Heck the absolute most fun I have had in my EQ career has been in the last month starting a new level 1, minimally twinked, character and hitting all of the deserted lowbie dungeons with a 4-6 person pickup group. With 90% of Prexus being 50+, playing a lvl 16 is like being on a new, empty server. <P>The "high level game" is pathetic, nothing more than the low level game with larger numbers and more infantile attitude from those who believe their EQ "uber-ness" really matters.

PLEASE pay attention to this.<P>I tire of everyone saying the game is all about Enchanters, Clerics and Warriors. This is way to broad and very unrealistic statement.<P><BR>1. Enchanter<P>In high level raids&#8230;it only takes 1..that&#8217;s UNO, One, Single enchanter for 6+ groups. Their epic takes care of haste and clarity is not a mana drain for what few need it. Offensively, they will cast Tash if anything. Damage spells and Debuffs are all magic based for enchanters and are resisted 99.999999999999% of the time. Verant has purposely removed crowd control in these high-end encounters so they have no part in that.  Basically their rolls become more boring than clerics. They spend their time refreshing buffs and then sit.<P><BR>2. Clerics<P>Ideally, if you could get all clerics, this can be said. But, it&#8217;s not very realistic. Any class that can heal better than a ranger will be accepted as backup&#8230;and backup is needed.<P>3. Warriors<P>OK..you need them to take the damage, but who is going to kill the MoB? Usually casters wont even be able to touch it. You need Monks and Rouges to get that HP bar down while the Warriors take the beating.

I'm not sure Kal-BB has the sort of attitude which motivates developers to pause for thought  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" border="0"> but I certainly agree with the gist of Kal's post -- and with Branar, to an extent. The low-end game is deceptive in its equality of casters vs. melee types, such that players with caster types continue to invest time building their characters - and eventually become disillusioned when they later encounter a drastic decrease in playability of their class.<P>You don't need to parse any logs to see the disparity between melee and caster classes as levels increase, houever. Just go sit in each of the bigger zones for each level range for a while (e.g., LOIO for low 20's, FM for upper 20's to mid 30's, DL for upper 30's to mid 40's, etc.)<P>Pay attention to the shouts and oocs of LFG's and groups looking for more.<P> - In the 20's, just about any combination of classes can work to round out a group.<BR> - In the 30's, players quickly see a necessity to base the group on a healer + tank ... then fill in the rest with other classes and you can easily make due.<BR> - In the 40's, no group is considered complete without a cleric (face it, druid/shammy heals are vastly inferior, and it is actually more mana efficient for secondary healer types to damage the mobs quickly with spells than it is to keep a tank's health sustained for a longer fight). But with a cleric, add a tank type and you're still able to supplement the group with whatever other classes happen to be available.<P>By the time you reach zones where 50+ characters can get experience (albeit painstakingly slowly), the open-natured formation of groups comes to a grinding halt. You NEED a cleric; you NEED a tank; and you PREFER an enchanter (but really just to enhance the performance of the tank and cleric).<P>Needing/preferring three classes as a core for every group isn't a problem, per se, it's the inherant limitation imposed ... it ties up HALF -- three of the six -- spots which make up a 'full' group. When you only have three spots, you're forced to form opinions very quickly about which three other classes are the strongest supplements for the "core" three.<P>It doesn't really matter which three supplemental classes are considered best by most players. As a result of three spots being reserved for the core, you end up with 11 (soon to be 12) OTHER classes, all vying for a piddly 3 spots. The "class balance" issue wouldn't produce so many hard feelings (mistakenly referred to as class envy) if Verant based the game on INCLUSION instead of EXCLUSION. They SAY the game is about grouping and they SAY that they intend for players of all classes to group, yet they construct the game in such a way that SOME classes are, by default, ungroupable because other classes simply make better supplements to the core three.<P>Do the math: you can't possibly argue that having 3 spots for 12 classes makes the game about inclusion. Verant penalizes players who don't group, and limits how much of Norrath they can experience on their own -- and then makes the task of grouping nearly impossible because they invested months of time in a class. <P>Therefore, I strongly agree with the poster who said increasing the limit on the number of people allowed in a "group" would go a long way in resolving problems. I'd say it would solve problems on a number of fronts, so much so that I'm sorely disappointed that THIS hasn't been more of a focus amongst development changes. All these patched tweaks and adjustments made to individual classes are painfully irrelevent to all but a PvP environment.<P>As for the PvP pundits (who refer to PvE as "carebear" servers), please stop and realize that EQ itself originated as a PvE game, and although PvP might be an attraction for an almost insignifant minority of players, it is the PvE concept that has allowed EQ to exist and thrive for as long as it has. Personally, I believe all development decisions should be based on PvE, and changes for PvP should be developed entirely separately.<P>Oh, and PLEASE don't say "well quit whining and make a core class" -- that misses the point entirely. Regardless of class balance factors like damage output, the goal is that all available player classes should be equally groupable. It's obvious that limiting a group to six members presents a substantial obstacle to that goal.<P>-Blank

Actually, these changes have been needed for quite some times.<P>Now what I would like is that Verant look at the caster classes. The only way to do effective damage to High end mobs is by melee (cept a few exceptions). Resists are way too strong as of now. After Verant take a look at a caster's life 50+ and makes the changes accordingly, we will be able to say that finally, the high end game will be balanced.<P>We'll then be ready for the next lvl upgrade to 70.

I don't get it--does "making the tables the same" mean that SKs and Pallys will get the same offensive caps (weapons, offense, etc)?<P>If so, then it's about time!  If not, WHAT A JOKE!!!

I think that hybrid classes (shadowknights, paladins, rangers) are underpowered even with these changes; or, more precisely to say, they aren't as desirable for groups/raids on higher levels as base classes are. This makes the class system unbalanced.<P>In my opinion, hybrid classes should get:<P>either a weaker form of Defense discipline (like 35 percent damage reduction, reusable after 15 minutes)<P>or triple-attack to increase their value as damage dealers.<P>With one of these two changes, every hybrid class will have much easier time on higher levels.<P>I will try to explain it, in hope that someone from Verant might (accidentally) read this and do something about.<P>(hmm now when I'm reading this all again, it seems as a rehash of every hybrid class point that people posted already... but maybe it'll help Verant developers if they see it all in one place  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0">)  )<P>Classes are unbalanced when some classes do not have a meaningful role in playing, where they would be the best.<P>What is a role of a tank? For example a warrior? At higher levels it is not only damage dealing - it is more as a meatshield. Basically, equip a warrior with stamina gear for hp, and ac/agi gear for armor class, and <BR>he has thousands of health points.<BR>Combine it with Defense discipline (45 percent damage reduction), that is reusable &gt;&gt;every ten minutes&lt;&lt;, and you get something that can keep the mob busy while damage dealers (rogues with backstab and wizards with nukes, for example) actually kill it.<P>Add cleric's complete heal on the top. It is more efficient to complete heal someone with 6000 hit points and 45 percent damage reduction, than someone with 2500 and no damage reduction. Not only less mana expense <BR>over time; with end-game creatures it is even a question if a complete heal can be cast fast enough to prevent the main tank from dying.<P>Can Paladins/Shadowknights/Rangers have a role in it?<BR>Without extremely high-end stamina gear, hardly. And even with that, when we consider Defense discipline of a warrior, it is still 45 percent more efficient to use a warrior.<P>Damage dealing?<BR>Wizards can nuke some targets for up to 2000 hp, or use ice comets for 1000 damage. Rogues with good equipment and a backstab? I heard stories about 500+ hits. Not to mention Assasinate, which outperforms Harm Touch so much that it becomes funny. Even with Shadowknight's epic, it is not possible to deal such damage.<P>Where, then, is the use for shadowknights/paladins/rangers?<P>Of course, evey class &gt;&gt;can&lt;&lt; be used, and a good raid leader will make use of anything available; yet it is a duty of the game developer to balance the classes and enable every class to have a meaningful role, comparable to other classes in its usefulness. So I think that hybrid <BR>classes should get better abilities in order to be properly balanced.<P>I have nothing against raising caster's abilities in PvP - this has nothing to do with PvP, only with normal (player vs mob) game.<P>It might also be said that hybrid classes have spells, and that these spells should balance the fact that they are less of a tank than a warrior is. But it is so only while soloing. And as we all know, soloing becomes harder on higher levels - above 50 it can be &gt;&gt;very&lt;&lt; hard.<P>Besides, EverQuest is a massive multiplayer game. It means that people are supposed to play together. Many quests are very hard to accomplish if one is not in a group. In many other ways as well, people are practically forced to group.<P>Once in a group, hybrid spells aren't so useful - clerics can heal other people better than paladins (they can heal a paladin better than he would heal himself), druids can also heal and buff better than rangers, any necromancer will have much better dot spells than a shadowknight - so how do these spells balance the situation?<P>It can also be said that if I wanted to be the best in one field, I should make a warrior or cleric and then go to raids - but then we could as well have 4-5 classes in EQ and that's that. I enjoy my shadowknight, and I enjoy soloing from time to time, or going in small groups or just me and one more player - but I want some meaningful role in high-level encounters. Something that would make people want me there, as a shadowknight. ANd I suppose every paladin and ranger thinks in the same way.<P>And oh yes, before someone says - shadowknights are indeed the best taunters - I can easily outtaunt warriors that are several levels above me - but that turns me into the main tank, and then I need health points and/or defense discipline to actually survive. If I don't taunt - then what's the use?<P>I saw some people posting that SKs/Pallies aren't supposed to be damage dealers, that they should &gt;&gt;take&lt;&lt; the damage - if it is so, then we definitely need a defensive discipline, otherwise, as it is now, we can't either deal or take the damage.<P>Compare shadowknight disciplined with warrior disciplines. Not only that the warrior has 11 disciplines, compared to 4 for SK/Pally/Ranger, warrior disciplines are also much more useful and some of them have shorter reuse times, top of them being Defensive with reuse time that goes down to 10 minutes,compared to 72 for all hybrids.<P>Usability? The only SK discipline, for example, that would enable him to spare some health points would be leech curse - for 15 seconds get 1 hp for every 1 dmg. So for 15 seconds I make, if I'm &gt;&gt;very&lt;&lt; lucky, maybe 800 hp damage, if that. Maybe half that. Means I will be able to get 800 hp once per 72 minutes once I get that discipline. Any cleric with a single complete heal will give me double that in no time.<P>A warrior turns on his "Defensive" and for 180 seconds he receives 45 percent less damage. Now this is defined on the basis of the damage the ubermob deals, and not on the basis of the damage the player deals as is the case with a SK. How much damage can Cazic-Thule deal in 180 seconds? A mob that quads for 400 hp? How much melee damage can dragons deal in 180 seconds? Now calculate 45 percent out of it. And on the top of it a warrior can repeat that, every 10-15 minutes.<P>I'm not saying that hybrids should be the same in melee as warriors - after all, we do have spells - but this is too much of a difference. This makes hybrids look useless. The difference should be more reasonable.<P>Balance? Classes were supposed to be balanced even before - in theory, lvl 40 warrior and lvl 40 SK/Pally should be balanced because while one of them has better melee, another has spells.<BR>If on a "balanced" situation you add 11 disciplines on one side, and some of them &gt;&gt;very&lt;&lt; useful and reusable very often, and on another you add 4 disciplines, not very usable and on 1 hr 12 min reuse time, how is that balanced?????<P>Anyway... I have said what I think, and I hope that the situation will improve toward real balance, that will make all classes equally usable and desirable for all situations. Differences among classes should not make one class more and one less desirable; differences should be there simply to enable different approaches to problems, with equal chances of resolving them, so that people with different styles of playing would equally enjoy the game.

It appears from most peoples posts that their main concern isnt that one class outdamages another to an extreme extent, but rather what effect that has on their respective classes usefulness to a group and hence their ability to get a group in the first place.<P>The only solution I can see to this is to give each class specific abilities that would make them essential members of a group in certain zones.<P>For example you could have zones that would be unplayable without a rangers track, or zones where a warriors taunt didnt work but give sk's and paladins a spell/ability that would taunt.<P>Maybe even a zone where reducing agro radius was essential to give the druids something to do.<P>Just a few thoughts

<IMG SRC="eek.gif" border="0"> I honestly question why they see the need for rangers to have triple attacks. Is it becoz so many rangers bitc^ about not able to get into groups at high level so Verant upped their damage output to be more disirable?<P>It seems that a Ranger's role in a group is getting more hazy. They can't tank well coz of low ac/hp yet most often they get the unwarranted aggro. So now they get 10 more Defense and triple attack? It is really mind boggling!<P>And it really seemed that Ranger are in the limelight coz they were really really getting good changes from Verant. I mean, did you see any other class in the last 12 mths getting so many positive changes?<P>I welcome the SK and Pally's change so that their damage output is not so laughable.<P>I hope that Warriors has got more tools to be able to maintain aggro. Maybe a taunt disc or higher taunt skills.<P>I hope that Magicians/Necros/Druids/Wizards get positive changes so that they are more useful against high end mobs. Its not that they are totally useless but against high end mobs and zones their use is limited to the resist level of the mob. What is the use of being able to do 6,000 damage in 30 sec when your enemy will shrug off your magical attacks?<P>I hope that before Verant decides to do test for more changes they can D E F I N E the classes in a more narrow term. Yes, repeat after me - D E F I N E  T H E  C L A S S E S !!<P>Why are we bitc^ing about the changes when they are only on TEST SERVER? Because this is the only way we can be heard before they go on LIVE and cause even more problems and headache.
