</FONT><HR><BR>Igbert's Guide to Charm Solo'ing <BR>49th Chanter <BR>Rodcet Nife <P><BR>I successfully solo'ed my enchanter from level 40 to level 49 in a matter <BR>of 4 weeks. <BR>This was basically one weekend day, and 3 or 4 evenings for a few hours per <BR>week. Not a ton of time really. Some people say enchanters are horrible at <BR>solo'ing (I played a rogue to 50, trust me, enchanters are wonderful <BR>soloers). I would even go so far as to say enchanters MAY be the best <BR>solo'ing class around. My backing is that solo'ing is all about damage <BR>output and (avoiding) damage input. For casters damage output is about mana to damage <BR>efficiency. Damage input is almost irrelevant because a casters job (even <BR>in soloing, is to not get hit). Given the right circumstances (which I'll <BR>discuss), the charm spell is the most mana to damage efficient spell in the <BR>game. A charmed 45th level mob puts a mage pet to shame. Especially considering<BR>such a mob can be weilded by (theoretically) an enchanter of 39th level.<P>I've also read the laments of enchanters saying that charm is a death trap. <BR>As I said, I leveled 40 through 49 with almost no grouping and just charm <BR>solo'ing. I died 3 times in that entire time. Once because of linkdeath <BR>(which is incredibly dangerous in a charmed scenario) and the other two <BR>times because my pet hit me and I had a bad string of 3 successive stuns. <BR>Three rounds of combat from my pet was enough to drop my rune and kill <BR>me. <BR>There are two thoughts associated with that. One is, don't let your pet <BR>hit you for 3 rounds  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">. And two, despite I'm a pretty wimpy little <BR>enchanter, 3 rounds of combat that can kill me must be doing some very serious <BR>damage. <P>First I'll list the absolute required ingredients for successful charm <BR>solo'ing for me. I'm sure other recipes work, but this is my success list. <BR>I'll then describe some very specific scenarios. <P>1.   SoW. I hate this requirement and that's why I list it first. Mostly <BR>because enchanters don't have it naturally, but despite my disdain, I <BR>cannot see my way around it. Jboots work fine. Enchanters have little <BR>trouble trading clarity to a solo'ing druid for sow and potions aren't <BR>that <BR>expensive. Sad but true - you must be able to outrun your pet. <P>2.   A wide open zone. Along with SoW, you need to be able to run. And <BR>Outrun. You "can" rely on your color-stun spells and charm indoors (getting that <BR>wonderful xp bonus) but that really is just too dangerous. You are <BR>accepting the fact you'll get hit once in awhile. I've gone killing 30 <BR>mobs without getting hit once (even my rune). Outdoor zones are solo'ers dreams. <BR>The zone should also have some dead area where chance of getting jumped is <BR>minimal. Trakanon's teeth is outdoor, but the whole zone is ambush <BR>nightmare. <P>3.   A high-level mob undercon near many normal conning blues. At level 43 <BR>I solo'ed BOTH the kromrif guards in eastern wastes that stand in front of <BR>Kael. My 55th wizard friend lamented he barely had enough mana to do one. I <BR>could do both simultaneously. It was a dance but I could do it. They conned <BR>white or yellow at that time.  I did it, but it was inefficient. Efficiency <BR>is everything, not dramatics. When those two guards fought each other, <BR>they pretty much beat the snot out of each other. Huge hitpoints and huge damage <BR>output. Once my pet won, I'd blast him to kingdom come. This cost me tons <BR>of mana for 2 kills. I learned quickly that by charming one guard, he could <BR>kill 10-15 dire wolves, walrus, snow griffons, giant scouts, etc before <BR>dying. While he was killing, I was medding. I rarely went below 60 mana <BR>until the time he was almost dead and had to zap my former pet dead. Trust <BR>me, this is the key to efficiency - your pet should be very tough and <BR>should kill many, many low blues. As solice to my wizard friend, I could not (and<BR>still cannot) solo one of those guards.. only two  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">.<P>4.   The mobs you will kill (and charm) are not casters. Fighting casters <BR>is always a pain. They simply put out too much damage too fast and ignore <BR>your runes. Chanters are all about controlling melee fights. Stick to it. <P><BR>That's really it. That's what you need to get going. Your spells are all <BR>you need after this. <BR>Firstly, I'll describe levels 43-49. I'll describe earlier levels <BR>subsequently, because charming lower lev mobs is easier. It is easier because of one <BR>very important factor. The casting time of Beguile (which works on up to <BR>39th level mobs) is 3.5. The casting time of Cajoling whispers (which works <BR>on up to 45th level mobs) is 4.5. That casting time is incredibly <BR>important. <P>The absolute, number one, most IMPORTANT rule of charming is: <BR>(pardon the caps, but this really is important) <P>DON'T EVER BE NEAR YOUR PET. EVER. <P>(I don't care if he cons amiable, its a lie, he really wants to rip your stinky little <BR>gnomish guts out, eat you, and poop you out tomorrow) <P>The two times I died occurred when my pet unfortunately broke charm in <BR>the 5 seconds per hour that circumstances had me standing by my pet. <P>Simple rule: If your pet is fighting - you are standing OUT of charm/root <BR>spell range medding. You have your pet targeted, your mouse cursor on your <BR>root spell, and your fingers on the CTRL-S keys ready to stand up. <P>If your pet is NOT fighting - you are running with your pet chasing (slowly <BR>losing ground) to your next target. <P>The enchanters that sit medding with a 45th level Frost Giant pet standing <BR>near them are the ones that say charm never lasts and is suicide. <P>By the way ? I did this successful charming episode with 170 INT and 115 <BR>CHA (buffed). Charms lasted anywhere from 6 seconds to 5-6 mins <BR>(estimated). Any charm over 30 seconds is useful. Charm Breaking is not <BR>really a problem. If you aren't ready for it, you die. If you are, its <BR>just the cost of doing business. <P>Ok.. Spell line up from 43-49. <P>1.   Tash <BR>2.   Direct Damage <BR>3.   Root ? (not immoblize, not enstill.. your 8th level Root ? there's a <BR>reason, read on) <BR>4.   Fastest Haste <BR>5.   Tepid Deeds (not shiftless deeds, tepid) <BR>6.   Rune III <BR>7.   Cajoling Whispers <BR>8.   Memblur <P><BR>Notice I use root and tepid deeds instead of better spells. Root casts <BR>in 2.5, immobilize (39th) in 1.8. For this reason, you may choose immobilize,<BR>BUT you will rarely, if ever cast direct damage on a rooted mob. You don't <BR>care if root breaks. Generally, you WANT roots to break quickly. If there <BR>was a 20second sure-hold root, it would be perfect. Also, you'll cast alot of<BR>roots and the mana savings adds up.<P>Tepid slows 50% - shiftless 60%. You will hardly use this spell anyway. You <BR>shouldn't fight too many mobs that pose a challenge to your pet. Tepid is alot<BR>less mana than shiftless. Really not worth it here imho. Generally, <BR>spells 5 and 8 (memblur) are optional. If you wish to put Gate there, <BR>that's a good choice. Another type of root (enstill is longer than root) <BR>for situational use is good too. Also mez if you aren't doing giants. <P>Buffs: The only buffs I keep up are Shielding, CHA buff, and Rune III (and <BR>Clarity duh). Rune 4 is just too dam expensive (10 Rune 3's per Rune 4 <BR>in casting cost). If you are rich, go for 4.  Also, keeping up Troll Illusion <BR>isn't a bad idea if you get hit - the regen is nice. Of course, last but <BR>not least - Sow (or jboots). Buy potions, give druids backrubs, whatever. <BR>Its required. <BR>Shade is ok, but I don't really get hit much. And when I do, Runes eat <BR>it up. Resist magic could be very real, but fighting casters isn't a good <BR>idea anyway. <P>Ok.. Here is my charming scenario levels 43-49. <P>Zone: Eastern Wastes <BR>Important points: Kromrif guards outside Kael can easily be pulled solo. <BR>Just north of Kael is a "dead" zone" there seem to be no wandering <BR>monsters there. Just east of Kael there are tons of wandering blue mobs. <BR>Kromrif guards conned white to me while 43, 44, 45. They seem to vary these <BR>levels. Also, Cajoling Whispers (according to eq.castersrealm.com) charms <BR>only up to 45th level mobs and I never had a problem charming these guards. <P>Medded to full, buffs on as indicated above, spell line up as above. <P>Steps: <BR>1.   Walk down ramp, as far away as possible, tash a guard - run up ramp. <BR>Note that tash is uber important. MR is what seems to matter for broken <BR>charms, not CHA. When my tash spell wears off, I expect a charm break soon <BR>after. <BR>2.   After traveling past top of ramp awhile, turn, wait one sec (so as to <BR>not be spell interrupted) and cast root. <BR>3.   If root is resisted (not often with tash) run north to dead area. <BR>Side slip, run past trees, jump - whatever it takes to gain some ground on the <BR>very upset giant. When you get ample distance, try to reroot (use 3rd <BR>person view camera liberally to check distances). <BR>4.   Once pet is rooted, cast charm. Recast until it sticks. (resists are about 20%<BR>for me I'd estimate).<BR>5.   If root is still holding (likely), approach pet and cast your haste <BR>spell on him (spell range is much smaller than charm). If root is not <BR>holding, head southeast towards mobs. Worry about hasting him once he <BR>is fighting. Since this will be your pet for the next 10-20 minutes, you can <BR>remove the haste spell from your list and replace it with something else if <BR>you like. <BR>6.   If root still holds, go south east and find some prey. Target it and <BR>tash it. Run back to your rooted pet hitting your hotkey "/pet attack" <BR>when near him. Try not to get too close to your rooted pet. Once past pet, <BR>turn and root target near the pet. It is important that during the fight, <BR>you keep the target mob rooted. That way, when charm breaks (not if) you <BR>only have to deal with a free mad pet, not two mad mobs. Also, I did group <BR>some with druids during this. Their snare made recharm a snap but I felt <BR>constrained getting my pets to new locations. However, their tracking is <BR>incredibly useful in finding the next mob. EW is great because there are <BR>LOTS of mobs, a sparser zone would be annoying. Nothing is more frustrating running<BR>a long way with a charmed mob in tow - you know the charm is begging to break.<BR>7.   While pet is fighting target mob, head out of root range and med <BR>watching the battle. Keep your PET targeted (F1 twice) and your fingers on <BR>CTRL-S to stand up. Also your mouse on the root casting icon. Some battles, <BR>your pet will not break charm and you simply get the kill. If he does <BR>break, stand up, root, and recharm. If anything is resisted, start running <BR>and try again. Sometimes, you will lose an almost dead mob because of an <BR>unfortunate charm-break and resists but don't worry about this. Start <BR>working on the next mob, such losses are rare. Also, if the target mob <BR>breaks root during the fight, you can reroot him. If he is almost dead, <BR>don't bother. The best way I've found to reroot is be out of root range and<BR>start madly clicking the root casting "spell gem". Once he enters range, it<BR>will start casting. I tried making a hot key "/sit off" then "/cast 3" but<BR>that meant I had to guess I was in root casting range.. too iffy. <BR>8.   Eventually, you'll have two mad mobs chasing you. If both are giants <BR>(kromrif ex-pet and say a scout) then they are fast runners and you must simply do <BR>some creative rooting to get things under control. Remember, the northwest <BR>area is your friend (just NW of kael entrance), it's a wide open uninhabited area with plenty of room <BR>to root. If the target mob is a manticore or dire wolf, they are slow. <BR>Run awhile, root your ex-pet, then root your target next to him. Even though, <BR>neither is charmed they will fight! They still have each other on their <BR>hate list. If your uncharmed giant kills the target mob ? it will poof! <BR>Don't let that happen if possible, recharm asap. <BR>9.   Once your pet gets hurt enough. Tell him to sit. Then cast invis on <BR>yourself and blast him a few times to get that kill too. There is a nasty <BR>bug that an almost dead mob will warp back to his starting point. This <BR>does happen to these guards and its quite a bother. Blasting my pet is what <BR>really eats mana. A kromrif guard with only a sliver of health still seems <BR>to take a few 44th DD's to bring down. <P>Other topics: <BR>========== <P>Memblurring for xp: <BR>Its said that if a pet does over 50% of the damage, it gets 50% of the <BR>kill. So, you can try to outdamage your pet, but that's horribly mana <BR>inefficient (probably impossible once you see those kromrif guards quading <BR>for 130). Also you could call your pet off an almost dead target and <BR>memblur the old target. Wooly Rhino's start out indiff so on a successful <BR>memblur they go back to indiff. I can attest sometimes it has taken me <BR>4 memblurs to make that happen! I can then blast and (theoretically) get <BR>full xp for the kill. Keep in mind however, the entire time I am casting memblur <BR>(which has a long recast time) my pet is standing right next to me. A charm <BR>break then is deadly. To me, this has become not worth it. I typically <BR>don't personally damage my targets at all. Let the pet do the work and <BR>make up for it in volume. If memblur worked consistently, I might consider <BR>changing my tactics. <P>Note that one kromrif guard has killed up to 14 (fourteen!) xp yielding <BR>mobs for me before being so damaged I needed to retire him. That's in a <BR>span of 10-15 minutes. I then med to full in a few more mins and go get the<BR>other guard!<P>Poofs: <P>Poofs suck. That is, you blast a mob for final kill and it disappears! <BR>No corpse, no xp. This happens because some other (non charmed) mob did more <BR>damage than you and is still alive. Scenarios: <P>1.   Your pet and target mob fight until almost both are completely dead. <BR>Then charm breaks. They both wander off because they are both at a sliver <BR>of health. They have both done 99% damage to each other. If you blast <BR>EITHER, it will poof. If you blast both, the first will poof, the second <BR>will not (because you killed the first who had the most credit for the <BR>kill!). The answer? Recharm your pet, blast the second (or let your pet <BR>kill it), then cast invis and blast your pet. You'll get both kills. <BR>2.   Both your pet and mob are rooted. A moment before the target mob dies, <BR>your pet breaks charm. Because they are rooted next to each other, they <BR>still fight. If the target mob dies then, it poofs. Recharm immediately if <BR>possible. <BR>3.   Your pet fights some mob almost to the death then breaks charm and <BR>chases you. Roots are resisted for awhile. By the time you get your pet <BR>under control, you are halfway across the zone and have no idea where the <BR>original target mob is. One battle later, you blast your own pet and he <BR>poofs. The old target mob (across the zone somewhere) still did more damage <BR>than you and got credit. The only solution here is to memblur your pet <BR>a few times and hope it works. <P>Eventually, you'll lose a nice kill to a poof. Again, its part of the game, <BR>just say "oh poop" and move on. <P>General other rules: <P>Keep Rune up at all times. You are a silly person if you don't. <P>If you are waiting for someone, need to do nothing, whatever - still don't <BR>let your pet near you. Tell him to "/pet sit down" somewhere and stand away <BR>from him. Or just keep running with him chasing far behind. <P>Slowing mobs is not too important. You can, but if your undercon charmed <BR>pet is adequate it doesn't matter much. The final goal is have a pet that <BR>has a SLIVER of health left and kills as many mobs as he can before then. I <BR>slow manticores against my kromrif pet because they really do alot of damage. <BR>If you are full mana during mid-battle (often) then feel free. Full mana is wasted mana. <P>The 35-43 game: <BR>-------------------- <P>This just changes your spells and location. Also your tactics slightly. <BR>First off, change Cajoling Whispers for Beguile. Your DD is weaker but <BR>that isn't too important. You STILL must follow the rule of finding a mean pet <BR>to kill low blues. Iceclad works for this. The two giants standing at the <BR>bridge can kill dire wolves and snow dervish like no tomorrow. <P>The most interesting change is in recharming. A Frost Giant takes about 4 <BR>seconds to get from just inside recharming range to splattering you across <BR>the snow. Beguile takes 3.5 to cast (Cajoling whispers 4.5). If you <BR>sufficiently outrun a mad ex-pet, can just rapidly click the Beguile spell <BR>until it starts casting and get the recharm intact just before he reaches <BR>you. It saves a lot of trouble in re-rooting. The bad news is that it truly <BR>does take you to the edge of do-ability. If the charm resists, you will <BR>likely get hit once or twice. <P>Possible charming zones: <P>+Levels 20-30: Griffins in the Karanas are a known undercon. You can charm <BR>a green griffin and do some fine damage with it. Karana's have nice dead <BR>zones hear the south water (don't get too close to guards) <BR>+Levels 35-40: Iceclad giants at bridge are nice pets. Plenty of dead zone <BR>near bridge and by water <BR>+Levels 38-45: Frost Giant fort in EW. Berzerkers are good, so is Frost <BR>Giant Captain. Dead zone south (same as "dead zone north" for kael <BR>entrance) <BR>+Levels 43-49: Kael entrance - kromrif guards. Dead zone north of kael <BR>entrance. This is Mecca. These giants can pulverize so many mobs that live<BR>just east.<BR>+Levels: 44+: Burning wood - no wonderful undercon but wasps work. Wurms <BR>are trouble because of their long necks. Dead zone by skyfire zone <BR>entrance. <BR>+Levels 30ish: Overthere: No definitive undercons, but plenty of room. <P><BR>Conclusion: <BR>There you go. Charm-soloing is incredibly profitable in xp. Note that I <BR>rarely loot, I fill up too fast. These rules can be applied to druids too. <BR>They haste their pets BETTER than enchanters and their snare spells makes <BR>recharming a non-event. Wooly Rhino's in EW work well for a 40+ druid. <P>Also, charm soloing is nowhere as near as boring as necro/mage soloing or <BR>root/nuke. It's a dance and you have to get good at it. Don't get attached <BR>to your pet either. He'll want to kill you in a minute or two. Switching <BR>pets midstream is great if the mana is high. Your pet is a walking piece of <BR>experience too. <P>Lastly, I'd just like to say I played a rogue to 50 (my first primary) <BR>and it was 100 times harder than an enchanter. My enchanter at 43 could kill <BR>10 giants in 10 minutes. My 50 rogue couldn't kill one. Sure, sure, <BR>solo'ing is not a measure of power. Then what is?

</FONT><HR>Very nicely written post, Igbert!<P>I'd like to add my own comment on the whole solo vs. group thread that will inevitably start...<P>Charm Soloing is FUN!<P>I started brand new enchanter just so I could charm solo all day with him!  It's SUCH a rush, but Drekaar the dark elf enchanter (hey... HIDE kicks ass when charm soloing) is just a stud... almost 20th now, and loving it.<P>I've got some differences from you still... but I think this is probably the best charm-soloing guide I've seen.  Even the stuff you do that I don't, you explained your reasonings to the point that I can't argue them.   <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">  I can just say I like my way better--but I'll be trying yours now.   <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"><P>Myself, I got a couple things I do different:<BR><UL TYPE=SQUARE><BR><LI>I *never* haste my pet.  The pet needs an "edge" (unless you happen to find that perfect underconning pet) for beating your opponent, but I'm a big fan of attack slows or damage shields (Drekaar doesn't have access to those yet).<BR><LI>I'm also not a "runner" on the recharm.  I stand there and just take it--it's more dangerous, but allows tight quarters.  Granted I'm 19th and using Charm (which Color Flux nicely covers for casting time), but even with Xornn I use Mesmerize (level 4) to cover the casting time on Cajoling Whispers/Allure.  Color Shift perfectly covers the casting time on Beguile, which is why I was so disappointed with Color Skew.  I felt we should get a color stun that would cover the cast for our current charm... Flux for Charm, Shift for Beguile, Skew for Cajoling, Slant for Allure... but ole Skew just doesn't do the job.   <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/frown.gif"><BR><LI>While I do the same method of running my pet from mob to mob till time to kill him, there are times when I just want to med up and I like my pet, so I'll med with him healing up.  The key is /pet guard here, and getting a <B>long</B> ways away.   <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">  I'll usually med till charm breaks, recharm, then go about my business again.<BR><LI>On the blurring... I've found that Blanket of Forgetfulness almost ALWAYS blurs, and the easy way to till if it works... when the mob starts to flee throw BoF... if your pet doesn't return to you, blur didn't take, so just let it finish.  Now... I DON'T blur while charming for two reasons:  1)It's costly to use blurs... mana I don't have to spare since I'm trying to conserve.  2)Since the best idea is to keep the mob rooted, it rarely flees, so it's not worth it.  Hmm... add 3)The charmed pet is standing by you.  Never thought about that till you said something.<BR></UL><P>Here's how my charm-solo usually goes for Drekaar:<BR>Buffs: Breeze, Shielding, SoW (Rune just isn't worth it till 34th)<BR>Lineup: Sanity Warp, Charm, Color Flux, Root, Enthrall, Languid Pace, Tashan, Swap (usually Breeze)<P>Find my pet-to-be and Tashan... run back to my "camp site" and Charm.  I keep three hotkeys "/pet attack" "/pet guard here" "/pet follow me" (the other pet commands are hotkeyd on the next bank over).  Guard pet and run out to get my mob.  Tashan it and run back.  If charm breaks at any point during the pull I root my incoming (if it exists) and go back to recharm.<P>Otherwise as I return to pet I flick Attack and Root the incoming, then slow the incoming and med.  I med a long ways from the fight but usually not far enough to charm in time.  Stay targetted on pet, toggle to enemy once and awhile... but keep the pet targetted.  ReRoot always, because one mob to recharm is nothing.  It's two that gets you killed.<P>Why haste over slow?  Countering points really... haste makes the pet win by increasing damage output thereby shortening the fight thereby making the charm "longer" by allowing it to hold through more xp gain.  However, the haste makes your pet a greater threat to you (as if it weren't able to maul you anyway).  Attack slows cripple the opposing mob, and increase the life expectancy of your pet, thereby allowing him to be used for more fights.  Damage shields are nice and cute, but don't increase the life of your pet and only ensure your pet wins... they don't really allow him to OWN a mob, which is the lure of hasting.  To each their own I say.  (I'll admit... if a mage is soloing nearby... I haste.   <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"> )<P>Okay... so charm breaks.  Best case, I stand and recharm, pet goes right back to beating ass, or if he's really low I kill him, then kill the enemy mob.  To recharm... either fire off the spell if you have room, or else you can Color Flux/Charm (or Color Shift/Beguile... or Mesmerize/Cajoling-Allure), or you can Root/Charm.  I like my pet going back in ASAP which is why I like the stuns.<P>Worst case... enemy root and my charm break at the same time.  Run.  Land mez on your pet as quickly as possible, then get your enemy rooted again.  Run back and Tashan/Charm your pet again.  (Anytime you have a spare time to recharm, retash too.)  THIS scenario is what drives so many enchanters from the charming racket, including me for 44 levels.  It wasn't until I finally bit the bullet and got GOOD at it that I started seeing 1)How rarely it happens, and 2)How a cool head saves you.<P>After all, we derail 5-10 mob trains all day, and this is only 2?<P>Again, WONDERFUL guide, very detailed, and even if I do it differently, I have no argument why NOT to do it your way.  I recommend everyone wanting to learn to try Igbert's methods out and then adapt them to your feel!<P>One last addenum.  Root casts in 2.0 seconds flat.  Enstill is the 2.5 second.  Root is just such an amazing spell.<P>------------------<BR>Xornn Mier'noen, 51st High Elf Illusionist<BR>Loraax Leapfoot, 28th Halfling Warrior<BR>The Nameless Server<BR>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.cyberjunkie.com/eugee" TARGET=_blank>Xornn's Guide to Enchanting</A></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003747.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=General&TopicSubject=Igbert|APO|s+Guide+to+Charm-Solo|APO|ing">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

I read Burning Woods could ya give some extra info on that? <P>PS: for more info on the dwarves in BB check the lvl 29 to 50 guide its in there very detailed (not by me)<P><P>------------------<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003747.cgi&ReplyNum=000002&forum=General&TopicSubject=Igbert|APO|s+Guide+to+Charm-Solo|APO|ing">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Nicely written Igbert!  After experimenting with haste/slow/damage shield/DD, I believe hasting your pet is the most mana efficient.  You can slow your victim but then you end up casting it on each and every one.<P>SoW is absolutely critically required.  I've tried charm soloing with out it and you end up with HUGE down time waiting for your health to regen even with Rune III.  I guess I need to get off my lazy duff and camp the ancient cyclops.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003747.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=General&TopicSubject=Igbert|APO|s+Guide+to+Charm-Solo|APO|ing">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Nice guide.  Ive read both yours and eugee's.  I think Ill try a combination of each.  I think I might drop mez, and just stick to root.  Still up in the air about slowing/speeding/feedback.  I dont plan on using more than one of those.  Heres a list of what I have narrowed my spells down to:<BR>Tash<BR>Beguile<BR>(Tepid/Alacrity/Feedback)/Anarchy<BR>Root<BR>Color Flux<BR>ColorShift<BR>Blur<BR>Rune (This spell never leaves this slot!)<P>I have to have rune up all the time.

</FONT><HR>Mal,<P>See you need a spell slot for your nuke.  Drop blur--you HAVE to keep the enemy rooted for consistent results anyway, and the ole pet doesn't back off of a rooted mob well anyway.<P>Look at my lineup based on spell <I>type</I> without looking at spell names:<P>Level 19:<BR>Sanity Warp - Kill<BR>Charm - Control<BR>Color Flux - Cover<BR>Root - Hold<BR>Mesmerize - Pause<BR>Languid Pace/Quickness - "Edge"<BR>Tashan - Duration<BR>Swap - Buffs<P>Level 32:<BR>Chaos Flux - Kill<BR>Beguile - Control<BR>Color Shift - Cover<BR>Root - Hold<BR>Mesmerize - Pause<BR>Tepid Deeds/Feedback/Alacrity - "Edge"<BR>Tashani - Duration<BR>Swap - Buffs<P>Level 44<BR>Discordant Mind - Kill<BR>Cajoling Whispers/Beguile - Control<BR>Color Shift - Cover<BR>Root - Hold<BR>Mesmerize - Pause<BR>Shiftless Deeds/Feedback/Celerity - "Edge"<BR>Tashania - Duration<BR>Swap - Buffs<P>Level 51 (current for me)<BR>Discordant Mind - Nuke<BR>Allure - Control<BR>Color Skew - Cover<BR>Root - Hold<BR>Mesmerize - Pause<BR>Shiftless Deeds/Feedback/Swift Like the Wind - "Edge"<BR>Tashania - Duration<BR>Swap - Buffs<P>Kill, Control, Cover, Hold, Pause, "Edge", Duration, Buffs.<P>I don't mem both stuns because I'm using an attack slow.  A mob with a slowed attack rate isn't just crippled for your pet, it's crippled in the event it rushes you.  I like the attack slow (good point was raised, it's a large chunk of extra mana) because the worst case scenario has much less impact with attack slows in play.  Look at the three most used "edges" (4th place goes to DOTing/Nuking--but don't EVER DOT when solo--you will regret when you can't mez, or accidentally charm the DOTed one).<P>I take two mobs attacking on a delay of 30, swinging every 3 seconds.  Let's assume they are same level, so will roughly take each other down at the same rate.  These mobs will likely take each other to nearly nothing.  That means you get one fight out of your pet, and unless you try to do some very messy blurring, 1.5 mobs of xp in the end, minimal mana usage.  (Without "edge".)<P>Adding "edge" at level 50 (for really raunchy haste levels) we have:<P>Swift Like the Wind:<BR>60% haste, changing the pets swing time to 1.875 seconds apart.  Now the pet will have 32 combat tics to every 20 tics of the enemy.  Very very impressive.  When charm breaks (not if) you will have 1.125 LESS seconds between combat tics to deal with the mob.  Haste will make the mob MORE deadly to you, and in the "worst case" scenario, you are in deep kaka.  SoW/JBoots makes hasting viable, as you just run away, but Haste is suicide without SoW (stay tuned for more on this mention).  Haste usually lets your pet nail 2 mobs, then give itself for your xp pool... 2 mobs of xp, minimal mana usage.  (Bear in mind still that undercons only live in select places... I'm looking at the run of the mill "make me Jabober" mobs)<P>Feedback:<BR>11pt damage shield on the mob.  As the mobs are going to beating the snot out of each other, the enemy will take an additional 11 damage per hit it scores.  Assuming both mobs score even hits (not a stretch) then assume after every 20 tics, with double-attacking mobs, if half the blows land, that's 220 extra damage.  Very impressive--at 29th.  Seeing as most mobs only double hit without two weapons though... it's still about 220 extra damage at 50th.  Not so impressive, and it will help, but not likely your pet kill more than 2 mobs.  Worst case scenario, two mobs swinging at you at normal rate.  Still full xp for pet, two half xp kills, 2 full xp equivalent.<P>Shiftless Deeds (my choice):<BR>Slow at 50th:  (5% + Level) = 55% slow, so our 3 second delay becomes 6.67 seconds.  Now for every 20 combat tics for our pet, the enemy has 9.  (By the way, Tepid Deeds at 50th... (20% + Level/2) = 45% slow or 4.62 second combat tic--13 tics per 20.)  Anyway, the pet doesn't have an "edge" it's got a rigged fight.  Vs a similar mob, it will SLAUGHTER it.  Vs a weaker one it will emerge nearly unscathed.  Vs a tougher one, it can often drop it, but you might need to drop a nuke in assistance.  But just looking at the combat tics, if your pet needs 20 combat tics to drop the mob (1 minute of combat--pretty realistic guess), then it is answered by 9 attack tics.  Less than half it's life if they are shelling out about the same damage.  Counting it's healing time, you can drop 3 mobs in a row consistently.  That's 2.5 mobs of xp per pet charmed.  And the question most important to me:  Worst case scenario--my normal speed pet, and a mob that swings every 6.7 seconds!  I can almost ignore it!  THIS is my lure to slows... it trivializes the worst case scenario into something MUCH easier to manage.<P>Mana cost?<BR>Haste - 250 mana at charm start.<BR>Feedback - 75 mana per fight, 150 usually.<BR>Shiftless Deeds - 200 mana per fight, 600 usually.<P>Haste DOES use very little mana in the long run... one cast for however many mobs the pet survives.  Mana comes back faster than hit points though... keep that in mind.<P>Feedback is next to nothing still... you gain it back during the fight STANDING with Clarity.<P>Shiftless Deeds is a monster resource hog, but even Tepid Deeds is crippling, and only 100 mana.  But 4.5 seconds vs 6.7 seconds on the attack tic... over TWO extra seconds!?  I didn't even have to think about it.  You will see more mana usage.  But honestly you just med during fights.  That's what you do--and 230 mana per fight (Root and Slow) isn't that hard to regain.  Your mana drops at charm time, not during the fight.<P>Xornn's "edge" explained.   <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"><P>All three methods work good... and if you really want the necros/mages to weep, hell yes, find a mob that will dual wield, give it SLtW, and proceed to DESTROY everything.  Just remember who buffed the **** out of that thing when it rushes you.<P>Xornn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003747.cgi&ReplyNum=000005&forum=General&TopicSubject=Igbert|APO|s+Guide+to+Charm-Solo|APO|ing">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Ahh the good times, Levels 34 to 50.  Perfect for an enchanter to charm solo.  As many people have mentioned there are many variations on the theme, but they all work given the right person and the right spot.<P>Few notes from my own experiences..<P>By charm soloing, I was able to gather xp so fast and by casting so little that I managed to level from 40 to 50 with a 30 point defecit in skill points for casting abilities.

Hit color shift, beguile - voila.  Cheap easy recharm.<P>Cajoling whispers does not fit in any of the Flux stuns.  I rediscovered mesmerize for holding (non-giants) still while recharming.  The same applies to Allure at levels 49 to 52.<P>At 53, you get Boltrans which does cast in the span of a shift.<P>At 51, many of the old haunts are beginning to green out to you.  Dreadlands is good still but it takes a while to find two blues amidst heaps of greens.  More running with the pet in tow lowers the effeciency.<P>Above 50 charm solo spots:<P>*warning* as you get above level 50, more and more things will /con blue to you.  Many Blue cons can summon.

</FONT><HR>Eugee, heres some reasoning behind my spell lineup:<P>Tash and beguile are understandable.<BR>If I want to control either the target or my pet I want to root and blur.<BR>I root because its very fast and can keep either former pet or target in one place.<BR>Blur is one of my favorite spells in the game.  If my pet no longer likes me:<BR>Root, back away, blur.  He is outta aggro range.  If my pet dies same thing happens to target.  <BR>At the end of a fight, I blur nuke.  You did give me some advice a while ago about the ineffectiveness of blur/nuke.  Being that between the ungreying of spells and the cast time of anarchy my pet may out damage me.  Given my current level I dont think that will happen (35th), since mobs just arent that fast yet.<BR>I didnt save a slot for DD because after I cast either feedback or tepid I will want to sit and med until both are near dead.  Plenty of time to rememorize a spell.  I also dont want to cast the DD more than once, and then at the end of an encounter, so both feedback and DD are one cast spells most likely.<BR>I didnt put in Mez, which I normally wouldnt go without, because I know I need to root the mob, and once hes rooted im either recasting beguile (should it be a charmbreaking incident) or my pet is already wailing on him.  I may need to reconsider this, and then I would take out the Colorshift in place of it.  I just like having the backup stun, should one get interrupted or fizzle. I am also leaning towards feedback over tepid.  I know that I will cast the feedback once an encounter on my pet.  Tepid will most likely be cast on the enemy, but if my pet breaks, hes wont be slowed, and I want to make sure I can get off a root in time.  Root will tend to hold long enough to blur, and should the blur not work I should be far enough away to recast root.  Have to try out this theory myself, hehe.<BR>Mal<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003747.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=General&TopicSubject=Igbert|APO|s+Guide+to+Charm-Solo|APO|ing">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I like charm soloing anything that can be messed. This allows the stun, mes, root, or what ever to escape.<P>Your lineup for soloing with a giant is great, I do prefer to slow the other mob with my 50 mana version because it is very efficient, and makes the battle go by very quick. <P>Feedback I use with a pair of mobs that are identical and I want to keep the damage almost even.<P>I love the damage of a hasted pet, and having one eat through multiple mobs on one charm makes us feel great. I have yet to hand mine weapons though. I heard one enchanter that handed two gnoll whips to his pet, now that would be very exciting, having a former pet be able to continuously stun you while he kills you. <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"><P>Longest pet I kept so far was 1.5hours. This was done with me and a druid. Druid snared the mob, then I tashed, charmed, hasted as he pulled target with snare, and my pet attacked. I would cast fear on the target and he would pull next one. I would call when charm broke and he would re-ensnare I would retash and recharm. Pulling caster mobs were faster kills, I never got hit once, and the exp was flying due to the damage output and constant pulling. I did get with a spell once or twice that night, but that was expected.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003747.cgi&ReplyNum=000009&forum=General&TopicSubject=Igbert|APO|s+Guide+to+Charm-Solo|APO|ing">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Charm soloing is a great way to get experience. IT is also a lot of fun. However I do have some differing opinions with the above guide.<P>Giants are bad. It is FUN to solo giants using charm. And I do it a lot for the fun of it. However if I was truly after xp, and worried about dieing, I would not do giants. Giants run faster than the average mob, thus making you run farther for the recharm, adding more time to the recharm time. They cannot be mezzed, mez can save your butt countless times while charm soloing.<P>My general spell line up is...<P>discordant mind<BR>dazzle (for parking any extra that may wander over)<BR>mesmerization(when root and charm break around the same time, this helps a lot)<BR>tashania<BR>mesmerize (yup the first one)<BR>color shift<BR>color flux (for those quick move aways, this chain stun is perfect amount of time and not costly with mana)<BR>root (nothing more than the first root you get is needed)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003747.cgi&ReplyNum=000011&forum=General&TopicSubject=Igbert|APO|s+Guide+to+Charm-Solo|APO|ing">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Thank you for this very informative guide (and yours as well Eugee).  I just hit 24th level, and last night I tried my first premeditated solo charm with wooly mammoths in Everfrost.  It took a little while to get just the right conditions (I took a beating the first time), but the second time I was rewarded with victory over a blue and a white, and the nice bonus of four mammoth tusks.  What a rush!  Groups are great, but this is a great way to put some zip into solo in between.<P>Just as a technical note, I did do it without SoW, but having now done it, I agree it's crazy to do without.

</FONT><HR>A little strategy I have hit upon with my<BR>level 15 enchanter charm soloing in Lavastorm<BR>is to deliberately charm a No Exp pet and<BR>send it against a low blue mob.  The<BR>green pet is easy to charm/recharm and is<BR>not to terribly dangerous.  The twist in my<BR>method is that I WANT my pet to die.  I <BR>charm the pet, send it agains the nearest<BR>blue mob.  Make sure to root the blue mob<BR>at all times and then debuff the blue mob<BR>enough so that he kills my pet but is seriously damaged himself.  I then nuke the<BR>mob to death for full xp after he has killed<BR>my pet.  So the fight ends with 1 full exp<BR>kill and no charmed pet to worry about.  You<BR>then grab the nearest green mob and do it<BR>again.  This only is good in zones with<BR>plenty of green/low blue mobs to grab.<BR>Worst case scenario is you have a green mob<BR>and a slowed blue mob after you at once.<BR>This is not that hard to handle and you<BR>can get by without the SoW.<P>Guille<BR>15th Enchanter Innoruuk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003747.cgi&ReplyNum=000014&forum=General&TopicSubject=Igbert|APO|s+Guide+to+Charm-Solo|APO|ing">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>As with all XP farms, the KEY is lvl vs hp.<BR>Lvl is the PRIMARY thing factor in experience, followed by location. Nothing else matters. Mobs with high HP for level (giants)=more mana expended/longer time to kill=more downtime=less xp. Basically, giants SUCK for XP. The idea is to kill mobs that are high level, with low XP. Happ in butcherblock is a perfect example of this, about 800hp on a lvl 35 mob, which means she takes half the mana to kill.<BR>-Malk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003747.cgi&ReplyNum=000015&forum=General&TopicSubject=Igbert|APO|s+Guide+to+Charm-Solo|APO|ing">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Great guide.  I soloed 42-47 in a very similar way in BW.  The one thing I do different, and I seem to be the only enchanter who does it, is rarely use root!  My line up was:<P>Mez<BR>Tash<BR>Charm (CW)<BR>Celerity / Fear (cant remenber name sonce I retired)<BR>Disco<BR>Entrance<BR>Invis<BR>Rune III<P><BR>I try and charm the highest pet that I can keep reasonably controlled - eg Scoriae hornets at 45+. I open with mes, tash, charm, speed.  Then I sit and swap speed for fear.  Then I just keep mowing thru stuff until my pet is ready to be killed.  When I fight stuff I usually fear (occasionally slow if mobs are wondering by).  In most Kunark, Velious zone mobs just zig zag and dont run far.  If charm breaks I entrance the target, then run and get some distance, then mes and recharm my pet.  When mes breaks I juts /pet attack to break the entrance and away be go again.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003747.cgi&ReplyNum=000016&forum=General&TopicSubject=Igbert|APO|s+Guide+to+Charm-Solo|APO|ing">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I've tried to charm solo but have had horible luck. I'm curently level 21 and was trying to charm solo in Lake of Ill Omens.  It was a pain because when i was finding a victim to charm i was often attacked by a wondering mob, then my mezz would brake and i would end up fleeing. The only time I did get any good exp is when i came across a sanark which coned yellow and a goblin that coned even.  I charmed the sanark and got the exp when he killed the goblin, then nuked the sanark when the charm broke and got the exp for him. (ok this really has nothing to do with anything, but it was fun <BR> <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"> .<P>Anyways, where is a good place to charm solo around level 21?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003747.cgi&ReplyNum=000017&forum=General&TopicSubject=Igbert|APO|s+Guide+to+Charm-Solo|APO|ing">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Well I tried out Igbert's suggestions. And while the XP per minuite is perhaps no better than in a full group that knows that they are doing, the plus is that there is 0 setup time. <P>Further, it is actually fun! During charm kiting there is ~ 0 downtime. The only down time is when you try to kill your old pet becuase nukes require so much mana. <P>I liked it so much that I went out and bought a wack load of SoW potions so I can keep on doing it for at least the next 5 levels. <P>Pretty good guide, Igbert. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003747.cgi&ReplyNum=000018&forum=General&TopicSubject=Igbert|APO|s+Guide+to+Charm-Solo|APO|ing">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>FYI there's two other great undercon giants in EW.  Wardon somethingorother at the prizons and the Frost Giant Captain. The Frost Giant Captain is always 45 th lv. so this is good if you are high lv, and I've yet to see him capmed whereas the Wardon is almost always camped, and the two Kael guards are frequently camped.  The Capain also seems a bit tougher than the guards, I used him for hours the other day (well mostly running away, but hey.) and charms about the same as a lv 45 guard.  <P>You find the captain at the giant fort.  If he isn't out standing by the two savage guards he will usually be in the right building near the entrance.  this is the best spot to find him.  If he's in a building you charm one of the savage guards, and kill the other, then kill the one you charmed.  Then you can pull the captain alone from inside.  If he's standing betwen the two savages, then it's a bit tougher, and I'll leave it to you to figure out a way, because mine haven't been that great.  <P>The only thing to worry about with him is that you will run out of mana.  I found that if you just root him and mem blur he will go back, you can med up and go get him all over again, usually with full or close to full health.  If you are lucky, he will even just stand where you blurred him for about 5 min. waiting patiently for you to recharm him.  I've even occasionally had him just stand there and wait when a charm broke.<P><P>------------------<BR>-Justi Saurane 45 Erudite Enchantress, Worshiper of Quellious the Tranquil, of Brell Serlis Guild Leader of Ancient Hands.
