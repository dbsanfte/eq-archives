I grow tired of people whining about there characters, armor, weapons. I read all the time how bad Enchanters suck. So now its my turn to jump on the Wambulance for a ride.<P><BR>Enchanters are all about math, At level 44 I can decrease a mobs speed 55% and increase my tanks 50%, which means faster kills and less heals(more exp). Clarity lets nukers nuke more and clerics heal more(more exp). I dont see us as a crowd control class but as the best group exp increasing class there is. My tank can go pull 3 things I mezz 2 and he takes them as he wishes which means less leg work, which means more exp. When some idiot runs some train into us I mezz them and we kill them when we are ready, rather than having to zone.(more exp) Any group that turns down an Enchanter I laugh at, we are not over powered or under powered. Its simply the person playing the character in my humble opinion.<P>I so tired of people whining about being under powered, let me call a wambulance for you. Where does it say that every character has to be in perfect harmony with everyone and thing around him/her. All RPG games have certain characters that are easier to play than others, kinda shows skill level to play something harder. I have played every class at one time or another in EQ, some I really cared for and some I didnt. 2 choices, I can get online and on forums and cry about it or I can move on and consider it a lessoned learned. <P>/prepares to dodge the flames

Well I wont flame you since you are right about most posts. I howere play a paladin and let me tell you about why people complain about beeing a paladin. Let me start with the facts on why I still play my paladin:<P>I started a paladin for rolplaying reasons. Beeing a well trained knight, fighting for all that is good. Dooing goodly things in an evil and corrupt world etc...<BR>I thought it was really cool. I was a tank and at lvl 9 I got some spells which made it even more fun. Well...  The first blow I got as a paladin was when I was grouped at the dervcamp in WC. We had just had a massive battle. The cleric was out of mana so I started healing everybody. Well one of them anyway since my heal spell at that time healed 10pts of dmg. They laughed at me and asked me to keep my heal for myself cause they "regenerated" faster. I didnt pay much attention to it since I knew I had another heal spell comming in a few lvls. Anyway. I lvl and grow in power and one day I am to get a sword I need. The Ghoulbane. Yes we paladins need the sword so that we in the end will get our epic. Anyway, I travel down to Guk and to my great dispair I find them to be indifferent. Wait a minute, do I have to kill a creature that doesnt attack me and more...  The Shin Lord is a PALADIN? hmm  What is so honorable about attacking a friendly paladin to take his sword ? Ok, some people will probably say : "Buy the sword then." Is that so much more honorable I wonder? Buying the sword of a slayn paladin. I think not. Anyway, I need the sword for my EPIC so I closed my eyes and relieved him of his sword (*SIGH*). Finally I had my first part of the Epic, cool ! On to the Armor of Ro. Whats a paladin without a shiny armor right ? The quests are tough but really cool, like a head of a nightfall gigant, 2 gigant cyclop skulls etc etc... I get my first few molds and then Im off to the Temple of Solusek Ro to get started on my Ronium (alloy needed to make the Armor of Ro).<BR>First of all...  The temple of Solusek Ro does NOT fall into my good aligned spot. Solusek is the god of fire and he doesnt really have a clear alignement he just burns everything thats not to his liking. So it struck me...  Armor of Ro? Armor of Solusek Ro ?  Why do we paladins have a paladin only armor that belongs to Solusek Ro ? Shouldnt Mithaniell Marr, the paladin true god, have given us an armor ?  Oh well, I brush it off and continues since its the only questable armor I can get hold of at the lvl (30ish). I get a cauldron to mix the ingreedients in from the paladin in the temple and he tells me that I need :<P>Sands of Ro,2 enchanted plat bars,Soil of underfoot, Mistmore Granite and Melatite.<P>Well, sands of ro drops of Sand Gigants.<BR>The MM Granite is dropped by Gargs in MM.<BR>The plat bars is bought at a merchant.<BR>Then we have Melatite and Soil of Underfoot, thoes are kind of interesting.<BR>Melatite is dropped by the gnome robots in Sol A and since they are Gnome made they also loewr the faction with Gnomes (???) Why should we have to get bad faction with the Gnomes ?  What did they ever do to me ?<BR>The Soil of Underfoot is obtained by giving 4 fairy dusts to the head cleric in Kaladim. Not a tough quest at all but have you ever seen a fairy ? They are beaufitul creatures, the sound they make is very awesome and best of all they con Amiably to me =)  Wait a second... I have to kill these guys too ? Yup and not only 4 of them since the dust isnt dropped everytime. Ok so Im dubiously to the gnomes now and KoS to the fairies and the frogloks hate me cause I killed their paladin.<P>Wow...  I have a hard time seeing the roleplaying aspect of all this...  Ok, I did have a choice acording to Verant. I could skip getting my epic and I could skip my armor of Ro (Im still wearing it now at lvl 45) and go on using my Banded armor that I worked my ass off to afford.<P><BR>Ok enough about Roleplay issues. What about game mechanics. At lvl 20 I started hitting harder with my sword and I loved it for about 10 lvls. When I got to lvl 30 I was outdamaged by warriors to the extent that it wasnt funny. I dont hit very hard, I miss often, I am hit often etc.  Well at lvl 30 I brushed it off as beeing because I had inferior gear or something. Now at lvl 45 I have several experiences of beeing the only tank in a group and when the casters are out of mana  I stand there hitting on the half dead blue creature and MISS-MISS,MISS-HIT(12),MISS,HIT(58)-HIT(23),MISS-MISS,HIT(83)-MISS. I dont know if I can explain how embarrassing it was to stand there and dying while the nukers medded up and had to nuke it to death. I was using a Firerune Brand at the time (21/40 with a 37dmg proc) and my 2hs was maxed at 200 and still is.<BR>After a while we got a warrior to the group. He had 2 weapons and when for some reason the mobs started dying BEFORE the nukers ran out of mana. Very strange indeed. And even stranger was the fact that the cleric had about 80m all of the time.<BR>Some people will probably say : "Well you had another person in the group how strange is it that the mobs go down faster ?" Not strange at all but what I am saying is. Before the warrior showed up I wasnt there to deal dmg, I never am, I was there to keep the nukers alive. And sure, warriors might think that they are that aswell but warriors also DEAL damage at a rate that is WAY faster than paladins. Warriors have, 2 weapons (usually) doubble hits with both, gets crits. They have more HP, more AC, higher offence skill, same defence skill, higher 1hs,2hs,1hb,2hb,piercing, higher dodge skill, higher parry, better disarm (why do paladins get the skill at all ?), better taunt, etc etc...<P>Ok, we get spells.<BR>I have cleric buffs that no one ever wants if there is a cleric in sight. I have heals that doesnt heal much for the lvl (the 39 spell greater healing is a great spell and the first heal that I have really used alot)<BR>We get our cleric spells 15 lvls after clerics do and thats 15lvls to late.<P>Ok enough about skills and spells.<BR>I have made an interesting discovery about the SoV class quest armor. Warriors get more AC than us, ok I can live with that. Clerics get the same amount of AC as us, why the heck ? Shouldnt we have more AC than priests?<BR>BARDS get more AC than us !!!  they have BPs with 50 AC !!! Whats up with that ?   Ok I just noticed that they must have changed the shining armor but that must have changed recently. <BR>Shining BP:<BR>Allakhazam : AC: +54 Str: +14 Sta: +7 Agi: +7 Dex: +7 Wis: +7 Magic Resist: +8 Cold Resist: +4 HP: +50 Mana: +50<P>Castersrealm : 44 AC, +50 MANA, +50 HP, +6 AGI, +14 STR, +6 DEX, +6 STA, +6 WIS, +3 SV COLD, +7 SV MAGIC<P>Bard Kael quest BP<BR>Troubadour's Breastplate (Castersrealm):<BR>9 WT, 50 AC, +50 HP, +10 AGI, +10 CHA, +14 STR, +2 SV COLD, +2 SV DISEASE, +2 SV FIRE, +8 SV MAGIC, +2 SV POISON, EFF: SELO'S SONG OF TRAVEL<P><BR>I dont see the point ??  And no Im not after gear nerfs Im just trying to see some logic in all this...  Paladins are known for their bigass armor and in EQ alot of classes has better AC ?  Whats up with that ?<P>Warriors have : Better fighting skills, taunt better, higher HP, higher AC.<P><BR>Ok, not for a question. What is the main role for paladins ?  When do you ever hear : "To do this we need a paladin!"  Ive never felt useful to a group. Rangers for example have an excellent skill, tracking but paladins dont have a skill that makes them useable enough to a group to have people want them..<BR>Paladins are mostly accepted into groups when there isnt a warrior around.<BR>I know this cause Ive been denied to join groups because of "We need a true tank to do this" alot of times *sigh*. I am glad I have a few RL friends I play with cause sitting on my ass for 5 hours trying to get a group is not very fun (has happened a few times).<P>Long post but thanks for reading.<P>Dissapointed, not very honorable paladin of Mithaniell Marr.<P>--------------------<P>Talarion Lionsmane<BR>Paladin of Mithaniell Marr<BR>(lvl45 atm)

I agree.  If all the classes were equal...what fun would EQ be?  Everyone with the same skills, spells and abilities.  Bleah.  I think the variation is great!<P>As far as questing goes it doesn't seem they're designed so that you can solo every item you need.  And why should they?  Questing in a group is half the fun of the game!<P>I can understand certain "balance" issues but before long all the "balance" complaining just turns into the fact that everyone wants the same skills as everyone else.<P>As a 40 Warrior I've thought, at times, it would be nice to have a heal spell.  I mean, what warrior doesn't get tired of sitting on his butt for hours at a time healing up?  Then I remember that would go against the very nature of a Warrior.  A warrior would not want spells to help him.  He's there to use his mind (well, not in the case of Ogres/Trolls  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0">, his fists, weapons, cunning and brute strength to survive and overcome the enemy.<P>I have empathy for classes that are affected by changes Verant makes that may/may not affect class "balance".  However, you can only balance so much and then it comes down to one simple thing: playing the character and overcoming. Doing what YOU need to do to get the job done.<P>Imlk, I totally agree with you.  I've posted similar things in the now defunct Verant EQ forums and was flamed like you wouldn't believe by the whiners and criers that seem to hate EQ with a vengance and, yet, <I>still</I> pay their $9.95 a month to play.  It boggles the mind.<P>--------------------<P>Mosephus Scroungetale<BR>41st Season Warrior of Kaladim<BR>Long Live Eagles Eye!<BR>Rodcet Nife

I see the point Taloroin is making about role-playing, but plain and simple there is no room for Role-playing in EQ do to game mechanics or you wouldn’t ever get a group. Or ooc would look like this, "Level 29 Pali LFG, wont group with Dark Elfs, Trolls, or Orges, also wont group with necros or Shadow Knights" how often do you think that will work on a normal server?<BR>90% of the time you would have to solo do to your deity or race or class. EQ won’t ever be able to support RP gaming. People play Everquest for its social aspect in my humble opinion, me now being married and having 2 children sometimes don’t get out of the house much, so once the kids go to bed me and my wife jump online and get together with all my other friends that have kids and relax for a few hours.<P>Like Mosephus said people complain about EQ all the time on these little forums, but they still play the game because in the end its fun and very cost efficient form of entertainment. You go to the movies that can easily cost you 15 bucks for 2 hours. EQ 10 bucks for a month, sit in the comfort of your own home in your underwhere, and chill. I dont not eat, breathe and poop everyquest, I play paintball, fly stunt kites, lift weights, and enjoy martial arts plus work a full time job so dont try to take the aproach that Im a EQ freak.<P>One last thing.Cut Guides and GMs some slack.<BR>I know the rules and guidelines that EQ has to follow because I am a former Guide, the guides have to deal with a lot of stupid stuff everyday. You wouldn’t believe how lame some petitions are. But they do have a customer service book that they send you while in training and you have to follow that to make all things far. Guides get very little in return for there long hours, they can never kill anything period. Only can duel in Sunset(GM Home), can never have any object on their body other than what they get in sunset. Cant even forage food just to make all guides the same. So please be kind to your Guides. Its tuff having God like power and not being able to use it.

Imlkgn, I salute you. <P>In the first post, you dispel some common misconceptions aboutthe Enchanter class. Soloing (I can imagine) would be pretty tough for them, but they're invaluable in a group, espescially in a dungeon. Anyone who has been lucky enough to have mez on their side in a fight or during a train knows that Enchanters are awesome. Also, only they can enchant metals and are the only non-Iksar allowed in Cabilis because of illusion, same for Neriak and the good races. <P>On the point of the wambulance...people love to complain and misery loves company. My mage has her limitations, but it's those limitations that make her positive qualities that much more enjoyable. After reading enough BBS posts, you can conclude one of two things:<BR>A) Apparently every class sucks.<BR>B) Everyone hates EQ and keeps playing it.<P>Too funny.<P>Next (and this one goes out to my lamenting paladin friend, Talarion), I truly feel bad that your lot in Norrath life is so miserable. I had no idea how hard the life of a paladin was. OK, my bad, enough sarcasm. Honestly, you should try out other characters and see if any of them appeal to you more than your paladin. I will say, however, that if you continue to base your character's worth on the comparison to other classes, you'll hate every character you play. Most warriors would love to have heal and LoH. All rangers wish they could wear plate mail. I roleplay with a wonderful paladin on my server whenever I can find her and she seems to really enjoy the class. I know I appreciate her tanking abilities and heal spells in case my AoE spell causes a wee bit of aggro on myself. My real advice here is to play your paladin and don't worry about my mage, SoandSo's warrior or anyone else. <P>Finally, another good call on the guides and GM's. These are people following VI rules and Sony CSG policy. They have to follow the rules like any good employee does. Also consider for a momnet how many /petitions must scroll their windows. It boggles the mind. <P>Just my 2cp.<P>--------------------<P>Aaneldarie Tura'Seorsa<BR>24th Mage of Tunare<BR>--Avatars of Tunare--<BR>Vazaelle

Greetings,<P>It's pretty simple really. Every class has a strength and a weakness. Example - Shaman, which I play.<P>Pros - pet, good buffs, good debuffs, wear decent armor to take beatings<P>Cons - weaker pet than mages or necros, dots not as strong as necros, nukes not as strong as caster and not as mana efficient.<P>Overall, we have some strong points and some weak points. We are a great class if played properly. <B>That right there is the operative phrase. Played properly.</B><P>Take a pally. Great offense, great defense. Not as many hp as a "pure" tank, but makes up for it with spells and class specific disciplines.<P>So, overall, each class does not "suck". True, some are better suited for some aspects of the game than others, but do not confuse this with a bad class.<P>Personally, I love having Pallies. I love havin necros, bards, tanks, all classes. It ain't the class, it's the person BEHIND the class.<P>--------------------<P>Wordaen Silvershadow <BR>47th Heyokah <BR>Veeshan Server <BR>Officer, Elite Force

Talarion, you're dumb. Why would you CARE about killing another pally to get his sword? It's PART OF THE GAME! If you don't want Armor of Ro, THEN DON'T GET IT!<P><BR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Warriors have : Better fighting skills, taunt better, higher HP, higher AC<BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>We're SUPPOSED TO!! Warriors have the highest AC and HP in the game! If you don't like paladins, don't play them!<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>. Wait a minute, do I have to kill a creature that doesnt attack me and more... The Shin Lord is a PALADIN? hmm What is so honorable about attacking a friendly paladin to take his sword ? Ok, some people will probably say : "Buy the sword then." Is that so much more honorable I wonder? Buying the sword of a slayn paladin. I think not. Anyway, I need the sword for my EPIC so I closed my eyes and relieved him of his sword (*SIGH*). <HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Why do you care if you kill another MoB that happens to be your class? I do it all the time! If you need the sword, stop being a baby, kill the guy and take his sword, no big.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR> First of all... The temple of Solusek Ro does NOT fall into my good aligned spot. Solusek is the god of fire and he doesnt really have a clear alignement he just burns everything thats not to his liking. So it struck me... Armor of Ro? Armor of Solusek Ro ? Why do we paladins have a paladin only armor that belongs to Solusek Ro ? Shouldnt Mithaniell Marr, the paladin true god, have given us an armor ?  <HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Again, it's just armor, best pally armor you can get until DW. Why does it MATTER which God gives it to you? I personally would be happy if Rallos Zek gave it to me! It's good armor!<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Clerics get the same amount of AC as us, why the heck ? Shouldnt we have more AC than priests?<BR>BARDS get more AC than us !!! they have BPs with 50 AC !!! Whats up with that ? Ok I just noticed that they must have changed the shining armor but that must have changed recently. <HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Pallys don't get THAT much AC, so what? I agree they should have more that clerics, but bards and warriors need the AC more than you do. Bard's healing song isn't that healing, and warriors can't heal at all.<P>Oh, well, enough for today, later all.<P>--------------------<P>Shandria Swiftblade of Rodcet Nife

Remember that the AC listed on an item is not  the amount that it will add to your AC.  Each class has a multiplier that adjusts the actual AC you get from an item.  The multiplier for a paladin is larger than the one for a cleric.
