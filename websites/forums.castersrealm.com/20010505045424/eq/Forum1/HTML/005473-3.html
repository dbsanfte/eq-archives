</FONT><HR>Amber (First Post)<BR>*'While the player who read and understood your post is camping Pyzjn can the rest of them <BR>*just go have fun?<BR>*Don't you just love it when EQ can be boiled down to this? Each and every part of the game <BR>*could be made the same way, and in fact is by a lot of players. Thanks for the info I'm<BR>*sure but if I still played then I'd find it easier to just let the game suck all by itself. <BR>*Saves the effort of thinking too much that way'<P>utkdawg (First Post)<BR>*'Well,Larcon still can't use proper grammar. At least he didn't try to use your or you're a <BR>*lot.<BR>*[This message has been edited by utkdawg (edited February 26, 2001).]<P>Hmmm, let's see here, where shall I start?<BR>utkdawg,<BR>*'The reason I ripped into Laroc was because of a prior thread when he did lash out for no <BR>*reason at all, then proceeded to defend himself in a foolish way while making himself look <BR>*worse since he was wrong. '<BR>Where, exactly, do you think you were doing anything different.  You aren't starting out <BR>good with me in the arguement front.  Read, re-read, then, read again, then respond.  Guess <BR>what, I was 20 minutes late for work because I wanted to re-read all of the posts made <BR>except the first one, geesh, I am fast, but, not that fast would have been later still at <BR>that point)<P>You should really try reading what was posted, in the order they were posted.<BR>You attack larocmoonblade for attacking Amber.  Hmm, let's see.  larocmoonblade attacked <BR>Amber for attacking Ampere (who was attempting to help those that would be interested in the <BR>information, and may *feel free to speak up on this Ampere* be considering the error in this <BR>action due to the Immediate jump on that Amber felt was neccesary.<P>I don't care if someone made a bad error in their arguement on a different thread.  It is <BR>WRONG to follow them around just to belittle them.  Just as, I would never do so with either <BR>Amber or yourself utkdawg.  Sometimes you may have valid points in which I would support <BR>your statements.  Other times, there may be errors in your statements which I may feel the <BR>need to point out.  But, in neither case would it be appropriate for me to rely 100% on a <BR>past arguement (the point of your vs you're) in future encounters with someone.<P>Yes, larocmoonblades' first post on this topic was ignored by me.  Why, because he didn't <BR>put out any valid arguements, he simply trolled.  But, responding with equall venom and <BR>anger when attacked, does not make you any less of a Troll.  And, I hope you don't feel that <BR>I was attacking either of you on personal issues.  Rather, that I felt your posts, even in <BR>reply to someone else, were extremely distracting from the original topic of Pyzin.<P>As to your statement about my remark about chemically imbalanced people, hmm, let's see, you <BR>(basically) threaten my life <BR>*'I would dare you to say that to my face; I guarantee you would never, ever speak again and <BR>*I do not joke'<BR>(not a good sign as to your status as 'balanced').<P>Also, you will notice that, in making that statement, I also included myself (main reason I <BR>don't own a hand gun or drive, too volatile a personallity with very few inhibitions to <BR>control myself) when I stated <BR>*'(I already know I am not or I wouldn't be posting to all of the people out there that do <BR>*these things, I would just IGNORE it, but, hey, I never claimed to be chemically balanced <BR>*=P )'<BR>Oh, and utkdawg, I don't think it does your image all that much help to, blindly state such <BR>a thing.  You have no knowledge of me, my abilities, nor my likely hood for retaliation.  My <BR>chemical balance, being what it is, has required that I make certain allowances (through my <BR>sense of humor) for such 'attacks' against my person.  My old responses were not very <BR>healthy for me or my freedom from institutional controled environments.<P>Amber, <BR>Oh my, oh yes, you are sooooo right...bzzzzzzzzz, wrong answer and thank you for playing.<P>Read what I wrote before you decide to attack it (oops, never mind, that really wouldn't be <BR>following form for you, now would it, at least, not for this subject).<P>Where, exactly, did I 'help out poor old laroc'.  Let's really take a look at this.<BR>My only reference to that person in my post was<BR>*'Cause, see, most people, at least those that are chemically balanced, don't get such a <BR>*hate on for someone that has made an ass/idiot of themselves as to argue that you're is the <BR>*plural of your.'<BR>Hmm, oh, I see, it was the point where I stated that this individual 'has made an ass/idiot <BR>of themselves' I see, that is where it got confusing for you.  I do apologize if that seemed <BR>like support for that persons point of view to you, but, I lack the desire to use my harsher <BR>words in this forum.<P>As to where I got my definition of Troll, that would come from having been part of the BBS <BR>systems since way back in the days where you actually had to dial up the server computer of <BR>the BBS.  We had trolls back then too, and they usually would get deleted immediately by the <BR>server owners.<P>As to where you 'already answered the point about grammar correction.'<P>Yup, there it was, right in the middle of another attack, this time on someone else, about which course study YOU saw grammar and puctuation discussed.  Some of us got to see it in all of our course studies that were 'written English' related.  That would be, all the courses where we were discussing the written language.  Some of us just got lucky, or unlucky depending on your point of view, to get to discuss syntax in all of our language related studies.  None of my Professors graded any of our written materials without consideration towards punctuation and spelling as well as grammatical syntax.  After all, anyone can use a spell checker too make sure words are spelled the write weigh.<BR>Oh, actually, my Engineering Professors didn't care about spelling or punctuation (outside of the equations) as much...except if it was a presentation material (oh, oops, my Professors also believed in preparing their students for the real world where presentations and appropriation commitees could be the norm and papers and documents aren't always prepared by some secretary).<P>As to my 'walking in with [my] eyes shut', I don't give a rat's !@@ as to what happened on another thread.  I don't care what attacks someone else is making on you.  Yes, I hold you to a higher standard than that individual (I don't care who that person is either).  I feel that the person attacking a thread in the first place, has less right to defend themselves in THAT thread.<P>You don't like that someone is going around bad mouthing you in other threads, even ones you aren't posting on, GOOD, I agree 100%, and, if you want to talk about that subject on a different thread, I would have supported  you 100% because they are wrong, just wrong, to go attacking you where you have not given cause.<P>And, I apologize for not making my post completely clear on this subject, as you apparently missed it.<BR>I was not referring to your first post as the 'off topic' posts, but rather the continued 5yr old tantrum/fight that was held three ways most of the time, with pot shots by others.<P>As to my status as a poster, funny thing about that, you don't have to post to read the threads.  I do go and read them.  I felt the desire to post a reply on this one, so I registered.<BR>Amber, I have seen other posts of yours and enjoyed them greatly, but, I have to be honest, they weren't your flame/attack ones.  I think you have a very good style to your writing.  That being said, I also think you can be a cold hearted %*%#^ =), I like %*%#^'s, they tend to be more honest with you when you fowl up.<P>As to the brain rot, I was refering, solely, to yours and utkdawgs and larocmoonblades (and those that felt the need to 'bandwagon') back-and-forth attacks.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=005473.cgi&ReplyNum=000051&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Pyzjn">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Now, Ampere, I would like to discuss some of the information and how you managed to get it.  More for the methods you used then for the whole Pyzin thing.  Might, someday, decide to try for that GBS, more as the status symbol then as a functional piece of garb, but, for now, I am more interested in trying to determine where things are going to be and where they have been.<P>Perhaps noone else has noticed, or cares, but those that hunt will understand.  There is no spore, rubbings, trails (sure there are roads, but they are the 'travel' roads for characters, not trails of game) or other signs of use to me for finding these things.  I don't want to play a ranger or druid (isn't there a third that gets it) just for the tracking skill, though I will most likely get my roomate to play his druid more often when we are trying to find specific prey.  I think that, game wise, the ability to intuit the locations and timings of the NPCs and MOBs is the closest thing to 'real' tracking that I will be able to achieve as the game 'tracking' only tells you direction/(distance???) and isn't realistic as normal tracking can tell you the frequency that a particular creature passes a particular point, why it goes that direction (if you follow the trail and discover what signs are about the area of termination), and what times of day (little more difficult,  more intuition then factual information, though, bedding sites and the like are very helpfull).<P>I love the 'realism' of the game.  And, I understand why, technical stuff, that they can't make it more realistic (yet).  But, every little trick that helps helps.<P>Oh, as to your first post Amber, true.  But, don't you think the people that play this game, even the children, have the intelect to make the decision as to whether or not they will use  this information or forget it?<BR>I understand that some of you, with photographic memories and iditic(sp?) memories may have a difficult time forgetting what you read, I know I do, sometimes, but there are tricks that can help.  Those that don't want information like this about Pyzin (or insert NPC/MOB here) won't use it and most likely won't read it either.  Those that do, are very thankfull that someone has taken the time to figure it out.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=005473.cgi&ReplyNum=000052&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Pyzjn">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>RobMC: <P>Seriously man, drop it. You don't know what the hell you're talking about. Iacromoonblade is a troll (not that that's a bad thing in his case  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/wink.gif"> ) that has been around here a long time. Anything goes when posting about him, because he doesn't hold back when posting about others.<P>Amber didn't attack Ampere. She explained that. Ampere seems to accept it, so why can't you? She was merely observing that she hates the fact that the older games get the more everything about them is known. If every spawn in the game is known about in such detail as Ampere provided for Pyzjin, then the game becomes a lot more boring. It's her opinion, and she has a right to it. She didn't flame anyone, so where do YOU get off flaming her?<P>In steps Iacromoonblade. True to form, he says something insulting, and he gets flamed for it (and for other remarks on other threads, wake up, each thread is not it's own separate world). Utkdawg, who has been here a bit but not long enough to take whatever Iacromoonblade says with a pinch of salt...ermmm sugar...flames Iacromoonblade. This is a justifiable flame.<P>Oh wait, out of nowhere here you come, knowing very little yet speaking a lot. Now I can't really hold it against you, you didn't know people's backgrounds.<P>But let me repeat. Amber is not a troll. Neither is Utkdawg.<P>And as for you Commonsin please read the above, it applies in part to you as well.<P><BR>I now have to go scrub my skin raw.

</FONT><HR><b>Commonsin</b>,<P><i>“Take the original poster for example - how the hell did that person figure out all of that?!!”</i><P>I’m pretty much a loner in game, not too many online friends. It took quite awhile to figure out the spawn cycle. I made my druid exclusively for farming GBS’s, and used my main character to twink him so I could power to level 20. Once I gained the tracking ability, I would camp Pyzjn during the EQ night, and then port out after the final pop time to get experience, then at 3PM game time I would gate back to Qeynos Hills. My druid is level 40 now, so you can imagine the time it would take to make 20 levels of experience during the day, and camp Pyzjn just about every EQ night.<P><BR><b>Mr. Bungle</b>,<P><i>“Verant brainwashed him into thinking it was fun and worth-while”</i><P>Incorrect. My personal greed is the driving force behind my madness.<P><BR><b>Robmc</b>,<P><i>“Now, Ampere, I would like to discuss some of the information and how you managed to get it.”</i><P>I read your post and am a little confused of what you are asking. Any question you have regarding Pyzjn I will answer completely.<P><BR><b>utkdawg</b>,<P><i>“Oh, actually on topic for once. I thought the EQ night lasted until 8am? In Kithicor Woods, for example, the mean undead mobs (damn, they hurt!) despawn at 8am... If I am not mistaken the EQ night is from 7pm to 8am, please correct me if I am wrong.”</i><P>With respect to the Pyzjn spawn cycle, the day starts at 6AM EQ time and the night starts at 8PM EQ time. The daytime placeholders begin spawning at 6AM while the nighttime placeholders begin spawning at 8PM. This information is for Qeynos Hills only. I’m not sure of the Kithicor timetable, so you might be correct there.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=005473.cgi&ReplyNum=000060&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Pyzjn">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

Her rare drop is a Glowing Black Stone, stats are: +9int +10 sv magic. It’s a handheld item that gives a red glowing effect. She has dropped 9 GBS’s for me in 220 kills, and the going rate of this stone has varied between 15-20 Kpp, or equivalent priced gear.<P>I don’t know if the GBS is part of a greater quest. I have read a story that says if you give this item to <I>Varsoon the Undying</I>, an undead invasion will commence. I never tested that theory out, although I imagine I would get the GBS back after I killed him, the GBS is not no-drop. Also, I have read that if Pyzjn meets <I>Varsoon the Undying</I>, she will give the GBS to him causing an undead invasion. Note that it is <I>Varsoon the Undying</I> I read about, not Varsoon as she cannot meet him because he is part of her spawn cycle.<P>No matter what spawn point, there are 24 of them, she pops at, she will <B>always</B> walk to the center of the ruins, even after she is distracted by killing newbies.<P><p>[This message has been edited by Ampere (edited March 02, 2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=005473.cgi&ReplyNum=000063&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Pyzjn">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

Just talked one of my 16yr old employees not to go to the local JC but to go to MIT because HE would understand higher math functions faster then I do.<P>About the length of my posts, I do apologize, I could probably have trimmed them down a bit in editing, but, I wanted to hit all the main points where I was attacked, (NOTE: not for defending lacro, I never was defending him or his actions, merely attacking the actions of others that I hold to a higher standard of behaviour.).<P>Amber, utkdawg, <BR>I fully accept your reasons for attacking lacro at this point.  I still think you could have (both of you) ignored him, but, at least I understand.<BR>I do not apologize for anything I said, I do feel that, there are better ways to deal with someone attacking you.  I like the utter breakdown of the responses.  Unfortunately, most of those early posts were too short to have a meaningfull detailed overanalized response.  But, I tried.<P>Amber, I have read other posts by you, I did expect better from you.  One of the reasons for the jumpdown.<BR>utkdawg, seen only a few of your posts, don't remember any of them, included you by name but not lacro because, well, simply put because I was attacking the two of you, and most certainly not defending the latter.<P>Oh, and Lacro.<BR>I never was defending you.  In fact, the main reason I avoided using your name in the first point is, I didn't want to go ripping on you with them.<BR>You will notice that, in reference to what they were saying about you (BTW: People, what is the title of that you're your thread, I would love to read it.), I said that anyone that makes an ass/idiot of themselves with such an arguement isn't really worth noticing.  <BR>You should have been ignored by them as a childish troll, which you prove to be in your attacks on me in your last post.<P>Anyway, I won't go there, cause, well, in my world Idiots simply cease to exist.<BR>Otherwise, I would be in some institute somewhere for the mass homicides, cause this world is just too full of idiots.<P>Again, to recap.<BR>The soap box has been removed.<BR>My understanding for Amber and utkdawg.<BR>My simpathy for lacro, you really won't go far in life with that kind of attitude.<P>Hey, Darksinger, thanks for bringing some things to my attention.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=005473.cgi&ReplyNum=000070&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Pyzjn">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Darksinger,<BR>Thanks man.<P>BTW: Some of us are still new enough to the game, under one year here, for now, that a lot of this information is still new to me.<BR>And, guys, this game is still so popular that the software companies local carry it in larger quantity than any other single title.<BR>And, I have seen them go out the door faster then the other titles.<BR>So, there are quite a few new players that may want help of this nature.<BR>She, Amber, forgot that point.  For her, and anyone like her, the game is getting old.  This would probably explain her 'if I still played' comment.  But, you know what, all that does is belittle the efforts of the person that posted the information.  It's like saying 'you know you got some good facts there, but, whocares, the same thing has been figured out a million times by other people, so your hard work and effort are meaningless'. . . where it shoud have stopped at 'you know you got some good facts there.'<BR>Just because you have seen the same information 5 times, doesn't mean that the person putting it out there has seen it even once before.  And, it definitely doesn't mean someone else isn't reading his/her works for the first time.<BR>I like the way this one was formatted.  It made sense to me.  I still haven't tried it, heck, I still don't really want it (the GBS) yet.  I will want it, but, right now, I am just having fun figuring out what I can and can't take at certain levels.   I have restartd my character three times, except my necro, who I put aside when the kills get too easy.<BR>But, I am starting to think about certain things and quests being the main one.  And, the techniques used to determine this information could prove very handy in some of these quests I have been looking at.<BR>Determining when and why something happens in this game, even if the determination is that it is random, is very important.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=005473.cgi&ReplyNum=000074&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Pyzjn">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">
