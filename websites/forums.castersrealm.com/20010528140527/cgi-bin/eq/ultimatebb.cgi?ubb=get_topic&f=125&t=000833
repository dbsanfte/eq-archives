Since there is no stories section for monks, I'll just post this here.<P>Last night, I decided to go to Dalnir. You see, it was getting REALLy hard to get good exp at level 32 around the giant fort in FM for me. After hunting giants in a group for 5 hours, I ended up with 4 bubs of blue, which is amazingly little. As well, if I tried to solo the giants, I got about a bub of blue from soloing three giants over a long period of time. I don't know why, but the giant fort just didn't work for me anymore. Then it hit me: Dalnir! Maybe I can pick up some Crescent armour, a fighting baton or two, and raise some good exp...and so it begun!<P>Saryrn is not a heavy populated server, of course, and forgetting that, as soon as I zoned into the Dalnir zone I did a /ooc Level 32 monk, lfg. Then there was silence...I thought to myself, what the hell's happening?! Then I did a simple " / " and found out that there were only 3 people in the zone...me and two level 60's (that freaked me out a bit). Anyway, I tried soloing a bit at the entrance, got a bub of blue from a monster (I was very happy). But I was pretty low on HP...then a mob comes, fears me, and starts nuking away at me...I was a step from the zoning point, twirling around in a circle, yet couldn't zone..Finally, I zoned with some 100 hp's left. Then I think to myself " Phew, thank God!"...wrong! I notice right then that the mob also buffed me nicely with poison. So there I am, mend down, alone for miles, sitting, with 100 hp's left, and loosing about 5 hp's every 5 seconds, very slowly, yet surely dying! When my HP was down to about 16, and I was almost crying like a little schoolgirl cause I was about to zone back all the way into FV about 5 zones away, the poison finally ran its course! I was safe, for now...<P>Continuing the adventure - A level 51 necro appears in front of me when i was about to die and heals me "a bit" (life transfer). He then asks me magically: Hey, I'm hunting in the "church" area of Dalnir, waiting for a spawn, and crescent stuff usually drops there. You wanna come along? Whatever drops except the item I need for my quest is yours! That's when I replied "YES" and started hugging and thanking him.<P>Of course, the church area is on the 3rd floor of Dalnir, where 50% of the mobs con red or yellow (mostly red), and the rest blue (but if 2 blues aggro, you're dead anyway). So, I get a superior camouflage and levitate from a druid outside the Dalnir zone, I zone in, and head for the church. All looked fine! I dropped through a well to the 2nd floor...all right, I said to myself, 1 more floor down and I'm there!Wrong...camouflage wore off as soon as I dropped to second floor. That's when FD came in handy (monk kiddies out there, when you get the FD skill, practice it and raise it for all you're worth! It pays back more than you can imagine). Then, by running a bit, then FD, and so on, I finally made it to the curch. There I pretty much awaited FD'ed while the nice necro was killing lots of klys. And by the way, I passed by a level 52's corpse to my surprise. The Necro then told me that until level 55, if you get carless, death can come very easily in Dalnir...I was about to later discover why. <P>After about an hour and a half, off of countless klys, no crescent armour dropped. It seemed to be my bad luck night. However, the necro's item that he needed for his quest (which he had been camping for a month) was finally dropped! He was jumping for joy, and sending his pet on a rampage around the place out of happiness. Then, we had to get outta there, since he wanted to leave that evil place (cause he spent a month there waiting on a spawn) and I sure as hell wasn't gonna hang around in a room with 8 mobs that conned a nice red to me all by myself. So I got up, him clearing the path for me, and me FD'ing in harder rooms which he took a bit of time clearing. Then, I was almost out. ALL I had to do was pass through a long passage, guarded on both sides by about 10 klys (per side) and topped at the end, right in front of the portal, with a level 48 kly necro. You can imagine how happy I was at the idea of making a run for it. Thankfully, a druid agreed to give me a camo so that I can safely get out. While he was about to cast it, a kly started attacking him. What the kly didn't know was that he was messing with a 52 druid who was near watter, and was somehow able to cast spells. So, therefore, kly goes bye bye rather quickly. That's when a bit of luck just hit me. That kly the druid killed dropped the crescent slippers (4 AC, 2 STR, 2 AGI, 2 DEX). Given I still had my cured silk shoes, I was bursting with joy when I looted them, and I was happy when I equipped em (not VERY happy at equipping them cause they gave the same damn look as the cured silk shoes, a look which I was hoping to change). Anyway, I get camo afterwards, and start making a run through the klys to the portal! Then, now still in a blur to me, the whole thing went like this : <P>I passed by 2 klys and still runnin..I'm halfway there...ok, passed 5 more klys, almost there...(then it happens) "you feel yourself starting to appear" ... oh damn... "the spirit of the wolf leaves you" this can't be good..."you appear" ... I'm as good as dead...<P>Then the "H.H.W.N.L.H.A.N.T.S." Professional Association started (Hit Heracle With Nukes Like He's a Nuke Test Site). Now I know why the level 52 died...The first kly invoker nukes me for 350 dmg, the second one I pass for 300 dmg, and one outta nowhere for 365 dmg, all this in about 2 seconds. Thankfully I had skin like nature and my HP was buffed to 1150. However, after taking those nukes, one more like the previous ones would have been enough to kill me. Just then, I desperately click the hotkey for my resistant discipline, and I resist a spell (dunno what it was, but it was 90% likely to kill me). However, I felt like I was gonna surely die, as I was a few steps from the portal and the level 48 kly necro, who was already glowing due to the spell he was preparing to cast on me. Just then, I see my HP go back up to half!!! (the necro that helped me in the church area probably transfered his life to me so that I could make it to the portal). I get hit by the kly necro spell, take in heavy dmg, but still manage to zone with about 50 HP's left. Then the necro that helped me all throughout this zones as well, appearing in front of me. I say: "Thanks man, I was a gonner for a while there...hey, btw, what happened to the train I gathered behind me all the way to the portal?!" He just replied: "Dunno, portaled after you did". Then, I zone back into Dalnir, to warn people about a group of about 12 klys (one of those klys a 48 necro)that was runnin around (a group more than enough to finish a level 60 off if they encountered one). It was too late. A 40 bard, part of the "Le Conseil de Norrath", was putting the french language into its most colorful form by swearing various things. He was also playing his speed song like he never ever played before in his life...yeah, that's right..the train hit him. Anyway, I think he ended up portaling safely, and that was the end of it. I had to go, so I thanked everyone, then I camped out! <P>And that closes, for now, my adventures in Dalnir. I typed all this to share a few things with the ppl here, and cause I am bored right now. Crescent armour gives awsome STR btw, and although some parts are not worth upgrading, Slippers, Gi, Pants, Armwraps, and Gloves are certainly awsome for a STR focused untwinked 30-40 monk. My adivce to anyone going there is: find a group until you become familiar to the zone, or you'll be dead in a very short time!!! As well, don't bring weapons with AoE proc (like I brought my Adamantine Bo Stick) because things there have an INSANE aggro on you when you use a AoE spell. Well, that's about it, I gotta eat now anyway, then go to sleep! I close the book of tales for the day. Good night all!  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>P.S. If anyone has fun and interesting stories they like to share, PLEASE post em. So what if we don't get a story topic like other classes, and only get a general topic, post it on the general, it doesn't matter! I'll be more than happy to read em!   <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" border="0"> <BR>Good night!

I don't know why, but the giant fort just didn't work for me anymore. Then it hit me:<BR>                         Dalnir! Maybe I can pick up some Crescent armour, a fighting baton or two, and raise some good exp...and so<BR>                         it begun!<P>                         Saryrn is not a heavy populated server, of course, and forgetting that, as soon as I zoned into the Dalnir zone<BR>                         I did a /ooc Level 32 monk, lfg. Then there was silence...I thought to myself, what the hell's happening?! Then<BR>                         I did a simple " / " and found out that there were only 3 people in the zone...me and two level 60's (that<BR>                         freaked me out a bit). Anyway, I tried soloing a bit at the entrance, got a bub of blue from a monster (I was<BR>                         very happy). But I was pretty low on HP...then a mob comes, fears me, and starts nuking away at me...I was<BR>                         a step from the zoning point, twirling around in a circle, yet couldn't zone..Finally, I zoned with some 100 hp's<BR>                         left. Then I think to myself " Phew, thank God!"...wrong! I notice right then that the mob also buffed me nicely<BR>                         with poison. So there I am, mend down, alone for miles, sitting, with 100 hp's left, and loosing about 5 hp's<BR>                         every 5 seconds, very slowly, yet surely dying! When my HP was down to about 16, and I was almost crying<BR>                         like a little schoolgirl cause I was about to zone back all the way into FV about 5 zones away, the poison<BR>                         finally ran its course! I was safe, for now...<P>                         Continuing the adventure - A level 51 necro appears in front of me when i was about to die and heals me "a<BR>                         bit" (life transfer). He then asks me magically: Hey, I'm hunting in the "church" area of Dalnir, waiting for a<BR>                         spawn, and crescent stuff usually drops there. You wanna come along? Whatever drops except the item I<BR>                         need for my quest is yours! That's when I replied "YES" and started hugging and thanking him.<P>                         Of course, the church area is on the 3rd floor of Dalnir, where 50% of the mobs con red or yellow (mostly<BR>                         red), and the rest blue (but if 2 blues aggro, you're dead anyway). So, I get a superior camouflage and<BR>                         levitate from a druid outside the Dalnir zone, I zone in, and head for the church. All looked fine! I dropped<BR>                         through a well to the 2nd floor...all right, I said to myself, 1 more floor down and I'm there!Wrong...camouflage<BR>                         wore off as soon as I dropped to second floor. That's when FD came in handy (monk kiddies out there, when<BR>                         you get the FD skill, practice it and raise it for all you're worth! It pays back more than you can imagine).<BR>                         Then, by running a bit, then FD, and so on, I finally made it to the curch. There I pretty much awaited FD'ed<BR>                         while the nice necro was killing lots of klys. And by the way, I passed by a level 52's corpse to my surprise.<BR>                         The Necro then told me that until level 55, if you get carless, death can come very easily in Dalnir...I was<BR>                         about to later discover why. <P>                         After about an hour and a half, off of countless klys, no crescent armour dropped. It seemed to be my bad<BR>                         luck night. However, the necro's item that he needed for his quest (which he had been camping for a month)<BR>                         was finally dropped! He was jumping for joy, and sending his pet on a rampage around the place out of<BR>                         happiness. Then, we had to get outta there, since he wanted to leave that evil place (cause he spent a<BR>                         month there waiting on a spawn) and I sure as hell wasn't gonna hang around in a room with 8 mobs that<BR>                         conned a nice red to me all by myself. So I got up, him clearing the path for me, and me FD'ing in harder<BR>                         rooms which he took a bit of time clearing. Then, I was almost out. ALL I had to do was pass through a long<BR>                         passage, guarded on both sides by about 10 klys (per side) and topped at the end, right in front of the portal,<BR>                         with a level 48 kly necro. You can imagine how happy I was at the idea of making a run for it. Thankfully, a<BR>                         druid agreed to give me a camo so that I can safely get out. While he was about to cast it, a kly started<BR>                         attacking him. What the kly didn't know was that he was messing with a 52 druid who was near watter, and<BR>                         was somehow able to cast spells. So, therefore, kly goes bye bye rather quickly. That's when a bit of luck just<BR>                         hit me. That kly the druid killed dropped the crescent slippers (4 AC, 2 STR, 2 AGI, 2 DEX). Given I still had my<BR>                         cured silk shoes, I was bursting with joy when I looted them, and I was happy when I equipped em (not VERY<BR>                         happy at equipping them cause they gave the same damn look as the cured silk shoes, a look which I was<BR>                         hoping to change). Anyway, I get camo afterwards, and start making a run through the klys to the portal!<BR>                         Then, now still in a blur to me, the whole thing went like this : <P>                         I passed by 2 klys and still runnin..I'm halfway there...ok, passed 5 more klys, almost there...(then it happens)<BR>                         "you feel yourself starting to appear" ... oh damn... "the spirit of the wolf leaves you" this can't be good..."you<BR>                         appear" ... I'm as good as dead...<P>                         Then the "H.H.W.N.L.H.A.N.T.S." Professional Association started (Hit Heracle With Nukes Like He's a Nuke<BR>                         Test Site). Now I know why the level 52 died...The first kly invoker nukes me for 350 dmg, the second one I<BR>                         pass for 300 dmg, and one outta nowhere for 365 dmg, all this in about 2 seconds. Thankfully I had skin like<BR>                         nature and my HP was buffed to 1150. However, after taking those nukes, one more like the previous ones<BR>                         would have been enough to kill me. Just then, I desperately click the hotkey for my resistant discipline, and I<BR>                         resist a spell (dunno what it was, but it was 90% likely to kill me). However, I felt like I was gonna surely die,<BR>                         as I was a few steps from the portal and the level 48 kly necro, who was already glowing due to the spell he<BR>                         was preparing to cast on me. Just then, I see my HP go back up to half!!! (the necro that helped me in the<BR>                         church area probably transfered his life to me so that I could make it to the portal). I get hit by the kly necro<BR>                         spell, take in heavy dmg, but still manage to zone with about 50 HP's left. Then the necro that helped me all<BR>                         throughout this zones as well, appearing in front of me. I say: "Thanks man, I was a gonner for a while<BR>                         there...hey, btw, what happened to the train I gathered behind me all the way to the portal?!" He just replied:<BR>                         "Dunno, portaled after you did". Then, I zone back into Dalnir, to warn people about a group of about 12 klys<BR>                         (one of those klys a 48 necro)that was runnin around (a group more than enough to finish a level 60 off if<BR>                         they encountered one). It was too late. A 40 bard, part of the "Le Conseil de Norrath", was putting the french<BR>                         language into its most colorful form by swearing various things. He was also playing his speed song like he<BR>                         never ever played before in his life...yeah, that's right..the train hit him. Anyway, I think he ended up portaling<BR>                         safely, and that was the end of it. I had to go, so I thanked everyone, then I camped out! <P>                         And that closes, for now, my adventures in Dalnir. I typed all this to share a few things with the ppl here, and<BR>                         cause I am bored right now. Crescent armour gives awsome STR btw, and although some parts are not worth<BR>                         upgrading, Slippers, Gi, Pants, Armwraps, and Gloves are certainly awsome for a STR focused untwinked 30-40<BR>                         monk. My adivce to anyone going there is: find a group until you become familiar to the zone, or you'll be dead<BR>                         in a very short time!!! As well, don't bring weapons with AoE proc (like I brought my Adamantine Bo Stick)<BR>                         because things there have an INSANE aggro on you when you use a AoE spell. Well, that's about it, I gotta<BR>                         eat now anyway, then go to sleep! I close the book of tales for the day. Good night all! <P>                         P.S. If anyone has fun and interesting stories they like to share, PLEASE post em. So what if we don't get a<BR>                         story topic like other classes, and only get a general topic, post it on the general, it doesn't matter! I'll be<BR>                         more than happy to read em!  <BR>                         Good night! Since there is no stories section for monks, I'll just post this here.<P>                         Last night, I decided to go to Dalnir. You see, it was getting REALLy hard to get good exp at level 32 around<BR>                         the giant fort in FM for me. After hunting giants in a group for 5 hours, I ended up with 4 bubs of blue, which<BR>                         is amazingly little.

Then there was silence...I thought to myself, what the hell's happening?! Then<BR>                         I did a simple " / " and found out that there were only 3 people in the zone...me and two level 60's (that<BR>                         freaked me out a bit). Anyway, I tried soloing a bit at the entrance, got a bub of blue from a monster (I was<BR>                         very happy).

I typed all this to share a few things with the ppl here, and<BR>                         cause I am bored right now. Crescent armour gives awsome STR btw, and although some parts are not worth<BR>                         upgrading, Slippers, Gi, Pants, Armwraps, and Gloves are certainly awsome for a STR focused untwinked 30-40<BR>                         monk. My adivce to anyone going there is: find a group until you become familiar to the zone, or you'll be dead<BR>                         in a very short time!!! As well, don't bring weapons with AoE proc (like I brought my Adamantine Bo Stick)<BR>                         because things there have an INSANE aggro on you when you use a AoE spell. Well, that's about it, I gotta<BR>                         eat now anyway, then go to sleep! I close the book of tales for the day. Good night all! <P>                         P.S. If anyone has fun and interesting stories they like to share, PLEASE post em. So what if we don't get a<BR>                         story topic like other classes, and only get a general topic, post it on the general, it doesn't matter! I'll be<BR>                         more than happy to read em!  <BR>                         Good night!

Wow, adventerous night.  My first puzzlement is why at 32 your exp is so bad at the giant fort.  I play for about 5 hours a night and consistantly get half a level there.  If you can pull tumps pull them over the other ones. They are a few levels higher and I notice much more exp on them.  If you are in a good group go for craigs.  My group consists of me (33 monk), 33 monk, 32 druid, 35 pally, 37 warrior, 34 druid.  Our whole group is amazed at the exp, but like I said we only pull craigs and tumps.<P>Now onto Dalnirs...I had a similiar situation first time there.  I had heard Dalnirs is level 25-35 so the group I mentioned before should do fine there.  WRONG.  I think the conning in Kunark for casters is way off myself.  Take the bonecasters is FM, con easy blue to me and 1 of them can almost wipe out the above mentioned group.  Well we invised, got to the crypt, clearing as we had gone.  We dropped thru the crypt into the little puddle.  I wanted to find the exit on 2 so we would have a quick exit if we had to.  Well the Kmart invis we had wore off all of us at the wrong time.  We went thru that hole in the east wall to find the zone out and we all appeared and started running around willy nilly looking for the exit.  5 of the 6 died, I zoned out with about 11hp.  Getting the bodies back was fun.  Got a 51 ranger friend of mine to help (better camo was hoping) and finally got all bodies pulled to that entrance on 2 and got my 42 cleric to ress.  Then the 51 ranger starts exploring and falls down to 3.  So we dropped one of the druids thru to evac to BB while I tood the rest out the exit (camo held this time).  <P>Its definately a dungeon on my list to master.  There is some nice stuff there.  Need to come up with a more organized plan and move slower.  But you are right, it trains easy and the casters there do some serious damage.<P>Glad it turned out well.  Oh, and the only cresent piece I got was the headbad.  Boy is it junk  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>--------------------<P>Kenelm - Human Monk - Level 41 * Landrysa - Human Druid - Level 35<BR>Rannulf - Human Enchanter - Level 35 * Sebekaz - Iksar Shaman - Level 30<BR>Karzikan - Human Rogue - Level 24 * Gasparde - Human Bard - Level 17<BR>---<BR>Tarew Marr
