This is what I really want. For them to change the name that appears on the Credit card from *SOE*Everquest to something that doesnt pertain to EQ. Everquest has become a Taboo word in the household. How about changing it to *SOE*FLOWERSFORWIFE. I can deal with paying cash for flowers every 3 months to cover up, LOL.

To those of you who continue to post yet say you are out of EQ, why are you still here posting.  You dont play the game anymore, why should we care what you say.  Take your thirteen dollars and go to DAOC, and get off the EQ message boards. <BR>Or maybe your just a bunch of whiny women and you think you should be heard. Bye!<P>Arcabaum Trueblade<BR>Prexus

I started playing shortly after the release of Kunark(3 days or so to be exact).  Just to prove myself wrong I went to all the places that annoyed me back then to see if they still had the same bugs.  Guess what, the bugs are still there.  Mobs still run underground in FoB, Guards still con incorrectly in the Karana's.  Ogres still con amiable when they attack on sight, Falls for 10k damage still happen while zoning.  Zoning with low hp's still causes all your buffs to go away.  CS still takes an hour + to say they can't help you, and the Lead GM will be notified.  The advertised features of SoL still arn't there.  Luclin is still super laggy with a 64meg AMD GeForce 3 video card on a Athlon Palamino 1600+ based board  with 512meg DDRAM.  Add that to my countries currency being worth only slightly more then the Mexican Peso(Canada), and suddenly VI can take this game and shove it.  Paying $Cdn15.00 to be a beta tester was bad enough, but this goes to far for me.  I guess the only question left is do I E-Bay my toons or do I just delete them, and forget all the time I spent on them.  Poor Sony.  I guess being a multi-national conglomerate they can't afford to do things right.<P>--------------------<P>Tanelsa Teir'dal Necro 41(semi-retired)<BR>Illessa Scaled Shaman 58<BR>Dhast The Discerning Ogress Barsher<BR>CT the place to be

Ghrevil,<P>Actually 60% of the costs you have listed are depreciated costs or write offs for tax purposes.  I am not saying they don't pay those cost up front, but they make them back when they file for taxes.  I don't like the cost increase but I will pay it.  At the same time I expect to see results for the added cost that VI is charging.  No more of the same ole same ole lines they have given for the last 3 years.

I'm glad to see a lot of great posts here.<P>You know, an extra three bucks a month won't kill us.  However, it's a trend we don't want to see continue.<P>Let's face it, they can't make everyone happy.  Even if they fixed a lot of problems, they would still have many people unhappy.<P>However.   There are outstanding issues that we all want to see resolved.   We want a new interface.   We want the Bazzar.   We want the normal day-to-day bugs corrected.   Get the horses working better, please.  Simply put:  Give us what you said you would.<P>This all can take time, sure.  But when we all see some new hype about a new expansion coming out, it infuriates us!  And we have every right to be angry.   Why the hell are you doing working on a new expansion, when all we want you to be working on now is fixing the outstanding issues?<P>The funny thing I see in many of these posts is how most people are willing to actually pay the extra 30%, and happily so, just to get the bugs fixed.  That's pretty bad.<P>They don't give us expansions, we pay for them.  The new features?  We PAY for them.  If you're increasing the rate because of the expansions costing you more money, then give the expansions away for free.<P>If anything, I'd like to see better customer service.  We are treated from the customer service end as parisites, always looking to screw them for items or whatever, and are given NO respect.   Hell, EQ costs as much as my ISP, and if I have a problem with that, I call them (free phone support?  Novel.), they believe what I am saying, and they don't tell me that I did something wrong or that they can't help me.  If I say I couldn't connect last week, they give me a week for free.   <P>Someone here mentioned "You show devotion to them, they show devotion to you"...   hehe yea okay.   In other words "If you sign a contract that you will pay us a whole bunch of money or we can sue you/wreck your credit/etc, and not have to do ANYTHING at all to keep you interested except the contract, we will give you a lower price."<P>Plus, nothing has been said from the SoE side about using the extra income for anything.  They did not say they were going to use the money to improve the game.  They want us to believe that they are FORCED to raise the rates; just to continue the way they have been.<P>Well I don't know.   I like Everquest.  It's fun for now, I can't wait to get my Magician Epic if I ever can (don't get me started on that one) and I'd like to see all the dragons take part in killing them.   <P>But, I'll get sick of it - because nothing changes, it's always broken in some way or another, and they don't deliver on their promises.<P>-CB

Want a kick read the covers of original EQ and the expansions. My favorite one is original EQ. It says on the cover that enchanters can enchant weapons. 3 years still not in game. <P>Read the features of SoL. Read all about the bazaar. Hmm thats not in game either.<P>Exactly what do we get for the money we pay now?<P>--Bonkey

<BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Falcone:<BR><STRONG>well I read most of the posts here. Some good points, some are way off base. First the rate hike it self. I see many comments of "30% is not modest". First point is that , when looked at on an anual basis, the price hike is 10% not 30%. An increase is price for product in the range of 5 to 10% a year is pretty common across most retail or cust service industries. This is to cover both the raises they have given to their employees as well as the increased costs of raw materials which, in this case, would be serevers and computer parts( you dont think they havent put new Hard drives and CPUs in each of the server units do you?) as well as bandwith cost. Among the things that everyone seems to be getting wrong is That Mr Smedley talks of having a development team numbering 50 people. Many post here have misquoted this as saying Verant has 50 employees. Hello he was talking about the development team. There is also a maintenece staff for hardware and network upgrades and repairs. There is The CS staff. There is the sales staff. There is the producer staff. If the total number of all these people is under 200, I would be very surprised.</STRONG><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>You sound like a true blue VI/SOE staffer attempting to promote the year subscription rate.  Unfortunately, two things. 1) If someone does sign up for a year subscription rate, which costs less, they will not get that same rate the year after.  Because of this, their rate, and thus percent increase, will go up beyond 10% in total. 2) Because most of us are unhappy, you must be crazy to think we would sign up for a full year of the same subpar crap that we have dealt with for the past 3 years.  The monthly rate increase is a 30% increase, so that makes the rest of your comments about a 10% rate increase moot.  And I don't care how many employees are working for that company, I only care about them requiring more money to play the same old game (or lack thereof).<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><STRONG>As for those of you who have played this game since day one or at least since the days of early Kunark and state that VI has not upgraded or fixed anything, What the hell game have you been playing? Class penalties have been removed. Ui has been upgraded alot since velious. 2 new races, 2 new classes. contunued attempt to improve and upgrade and balance classes (this is on going inspite of the fact that VI has stated on numerous occasions that they would no longer look at class balancing). The latest round of improvements, especially the chat features are vast improvements to the game. Ally or raid channels has been on the top of the wish list for a long time. This also helps to alivieate the bazaar fiasco to an extent as now a global trade channel is at this very moment in use on you server. (on Karana the channel is trade: no password). I went through the EC tunnel and thought I was going LD cause I didn't see hardly anyone. It was empty or almost so. Existing zones have been upgraded and added. Someone posted that the old world zones should be upgraded like Blackburrow and Runneye. Ah well you might have had a chance of making a point if you didn't use as examples 2 zones that have been revamped. Kithicor forest, Blackburrow, Runneye, Befallen, Split paw lair, Cazic-thule, Lesser Faydark. These old world zones have all been revamped at one time or another since release ( did I miss any ?). 5 outer planes. Stonebrunt Mtns, The hole, and Paineel have all been added on zones to the Original EQ for free.</STRONG><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>You haven't been paying attention to our posts.  We have acknowledged getting upgrades, but that most upgrades came with expansions that we purchased.  Velious UI improvements?  Yup, came with Velious.  2 new races and classes?  Yup came with Kunark and SoL.  Continued class balance?  Ya, 3 years after the game's release VI finally gets around to caster balance... how nice.  Multiple chat channels?  Yes, something players have asked for forever, but only now included because a) other competitor games have done it, and b) as you said, help alleviate the bazaar fiasco.  Unfortunately, alternate chat channels was not a selling point for SoL - a new Bazaar WAS a selling point for SoL, and still has yet to be delivered. Thus blatant illegal false advertising.  Upgraded zones?  Some of which were disappointing, and some of which were almost a necessity (neriak).  So, in a couple of cases, is nice, but does not warrant a 30% rate increase.  Added new zones for free?  Again, would like to point out that the game was initially released short a few zones, so it sure was nice of them to make up for their downfall.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><STRONG>Another thing I hear people gripe about is the CS. I have played since 5 months after release and have never had a problem getting my problem addressed in a timley professional or curtios manner. Maybe you think you can do better. Id like to see the hands of all the people who have had to provide CS to 100000 customers at once? Thats what I thought, very few of you.</STRONG><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>We are not talking about you or the minority who may have had "nothing but good" CS experience (no matter how much I don't believe that comment anyway).  We are talking about the majority of us who have had many bad experiences.  I could care less if I could do better at CS - that is besides the point.  The point is that they have cruddy CS service, which is acknowledged by the majority of the player base.  So cruddy, in fact, that again, a 30% rate increase is not warranted.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><STRONG>Does this mean the game is perfect. Of course not. Show me a game that is. Show me a game that has up to 100000 people all accessing the servers over the internet and playing a RT game of this magnitude that doesnt have problems. Oh wait, there arnt any other games that even qualify . Why? Because in spite of the problems, and yes Im as disappointed as anyone with them, This is by far, the best interactive RT MMORPG out there.</STRONG><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>I don't care if there are any other games that have come out that can truly compete with EQ.  EQ is still full of shotty programming and the companies are constantly making bad decisions.  Again, just because no real competition has come out for this game (although some might disagree with me) does not warrant a 30% rate increase.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><STRONG>One last point that I dont think anyone has raised. Whether you like it or not, VI is developing other games most notably SWG. This cost money. These games, while in development, are not generating revenue. art of the increase in the EQ subs rate is to pay for this development. Some of you may feel this is wrong but there isnt a succesful gaming company out there that doesnt take a percentage of their income and put it towards development of future product. The cost of Beta servers for SWG are also a very real cost that part of this increase goes to play for. The good news is that once SWG goes live, it will be more self supporting and my guess is that you will be able o do a dual subscription that will keep you near the same cost for EQ ( much like the long term plans for the current rate hike ).</STRONG><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Wrong.  Many game companies do take the proceeds from game A to help develop game B, but I WILL NOT pay extra money for EQ so they can further develop a non-EQ related game, one which I will never play.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><STRONG>In short costs do rise and a 10% annual increase is not that out of line. You can say what you like about bugs and incomplete items but this is the best game on the internet period, thats why we all play.</STRONG><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Actually, in short a 30% rate increase is very out of line.  This is the ONLY real game out there on the market, but even still, it is far from great.  And that is why I am cancelling my account.

ROFL, Crank.  Ok, here's my take, which will be at variance with many of the ranters here:<P>The price increase isn't that bad.  Nothing else has stayed the same price for three years.  Especially not programmer and network engineer compensation.  Crank this into your calculations: EQ does not run on that $799 Best Buy special sitting on your desk.  Every "server" is actually approximately 27 networked computers.  Not cheap, best-bang-for-the-buck boxes like you or I use, but heavy-duty, high volume $10,000 and <I>up</I> servers.  27 x 45= <B>1,215</B> machines.  (note, we are not even getting into hubs, switches, cabling, racks, physical space, UPS...this is why its called a "server farm.") Of that number, how many will need replacing in any given month?  Generally, a computer is totally obsolete in 3 years.  So average 1/3 of the servers: or <B>405</B> new computers/year just to run the game.  There's a cool $4 mill and we haven't even gotten into the desktop systems used by the 50-odd programmers and content developers, then the GM's, etc.<P>Now it's also obvious that they're repositioning their price structure to be in line with the other MMORPG's, which I do object to, because that's price fixing.  <P>And I also sent to the Developer's Corner a word or two about the Bazaar and UI. We <B>do</B> deserve an update on those, considering a price increase and new expansion have been announced.

Though maybe a price increase is warranted for the Everquest service, I am very upset at the short notice!  Something like this should be though about long before and players should be notified at least 90 days ahead of said price increase.  It's good business to let your customers know well ahead of time for such things.

Here is what i would like to see.  EQ has scheduled patches, and scheduled down time.  That is fine, the game needs patches, and maybe it can't be patched as easilly while it's up and running.  But for every scheduled patch, there are 2 or more EMERGANCY patches, or unscheduled patches, and login server failures.  EQ should reimburse us for UNSCHEDULED down time.  If your ISP goes down, you can get reimbursed for the down time.  Good hosting services will automatically refund you for their downtime, and will tell you exactly how much down time they had that wasn't scheduled. I don't agree with their reasoning behind raising the prices, i've also read many of the posts (not all, 4 pages is a lot) and agree with a lot of the points.  Unfortunately no matter how much we complain, the price change will happen.  The least they could do is refund us for the down time they experience.  How many people got refunds for when SoL shut down the servers for days at a time?  I didn't.  <P>Cantril Ivoryshield<BR>51 Cleric of Bristlebane<BR>Sularus Oth Mithas<BR>Mith Marr

I have been out of the game of EQ since after SOL came out. When the framerates and sound and overall playability of the game was lost to me, I then decided it was not worth paying my fee every month for something that was taking a long time to fix. And from a lot of the forums i read this problem has still not been fixed. The game worked fine before SoL. When i tried to quit my account with EQ, I got a bill stating they were still charging my credit card for EQ after i supposely cancelled it through the software. Well when i tried to call their support, i was either disconnected or got a busy signal. Well I put the EQ number on speed dial and kept calling them for 3 hours until i got through. This is not a toll call either. I want to thank EQ for gouging me on my phone bill to call their crappy support to notify them that they screwed up charging me again. I also would like to see exactly what people are getting for this price increase?? I keep checking the forums hoping the problems will go away and get better so that I can justify coming back to playing the game.<P>If everyone in the whole game were to QUIT their accounts for a while, I bet EQ would take notice and maybe finally get their SH_t together! LETS DO A SICK OUT!!! Or more like a QUIT OUT! Belive me businesses take notice when no one shows up for work. Maybe Verant will listen to what their customers have to say when they arent getting their money anymore. Good , I had to vent!!! I committed 2 years of my life to this game and think it is one of the best out there. I would like to come back but I will not give money to something that does not work.

I don't believe that the rate increase is unreasonable.  For those that do it is a very simple matter of cancelling your account.  What about all the time you have already invested in it?  That is up to you.  This is a source of entertainment not an investment.  You will never reap anything from this service but entertainment.  If you die tomorrow your family will receive nothing from it.  If you have invested your time in this game then it is because you wanted too for the entertainment value.  I read a post that said you'd like a detailed accounting of why the increase.  I don't know about your job experience, but I've never worked for a company that would do this and it is a ridiculous notion.  VI is providing a service for a cost.  Either you feel the service is worth it and pay or you don't.  I have been very frustrated at time with the tech support, bugs, lack of content, and everything else.  I still choose to play though because overall I like the game and enjoy playing it.  If I didn't then I would cancel today and find something else to ammuse myself.  My biggest gripe with VI/SOE right now is the fact that Luclin was sold as having several improvements that still do not exist.  This is a real case of not getting what you pay for.  You can all flame me for being an idiot, but this is my choice and I don't ask you to like it.<P>--------------------<P>Tanvarien Panteras<BR>33rd Level Ranger<BR>Elite Guards of Norrath

Look, the real issue here isn't whether the price increase is warranted or not, or whether it's to much or to little.  Rather, the issue to me is that SOE and Verant continue to charge for services they promise, but consistantly fail to deliver in a reasonable and/or timely manner.  It has now been over 3 months since the release of Luclin and aside from the new graphics engine, the other main selling features of the expansion(bazaar, new UI) are still undelivered and they do not even have an estimate of when they will be completed.  What is the most frustrating to me is that instead of commiting their entire team to fixing the current problems and delivering what they have PROMISED and I have ALREADY PAID FOR, they stick a small team to work on it in their spare time while the rest of the staff hastily throws together new expansions ,that like the last one, will be buggy and incomplete when released leaving us frustrated once again.  <P>SOE and Verant like to compare their product to other forms of entertainment like going to the movies.  Lets really look at that analogy a little closer.  If SOE and Verant ran a movie theatre, this is how your movie experience would be:  First, you would have to buy a movie pass for $40 that would allow you to go to the theatre and watch movies, in addition, there would be a $12 monthly fee to cover "operating expenses" and "new movies".  However, when a highly anticipated new feature film is released, you will be charged an additional $30 to be able to watch it, but this only happens about once a year.  After you have recieved your movie pass, you walk in to a theatre that is packed.  There is hardly any room to sit.  You finally find a seat and the show begins.  For some reason the movie plays as if in slow motion, stopping altogether at times.  The soundtrack is erratic and for some reason all you can hear is footsteps.  About half way through the movie, right at a climatic scene, it suddenly goes black and all you can see on the screen are the words "YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED".  The next thing you  know you find yourself standing in the parking lot butt naked.  You spend the next 30 minutes trying to get back in the theatre, but all the doors are locked.  Eventually, you get back in and try to track down a manager to find out where your clothes are and what the heck is going on.  You notice on the door to the managers office a sign that says his office hours are from 8:00am to 10:00pm monday thru friday.  Looking at your watch you notice its 6:00pm on friday but no one is in the office.  You wander around for the next 5 hours looking for the manager before finally an employee shows up to help.  However, come to find out, the employee, although very friendly, is just a volunteer and has no authority to help you recover your clothes.  He also has no idea how you ended up in the parking lot either.  Finally, you find your clothes with the help of some friends and head off to watch the new feature film you've paid $30 for.  After the movie starts 45 minutes late, you begin to watch the film, fascinated by the new dazzling special effects.  Suddenly, half way through the film, the screen once again goes black.  Almost immediately, you hear a voice come over the intercom announcing that they haven't actually finished filming the movie yet and they are unsure when it will be completed.  You sit there in disbelief for a moment when suddenly, the screen flares back on.  This time however, it is not the second half of the movie, but rather a preview for the upcoming sequel that you can purchase your pass to shortly for another $30.<P>The real sad part is that we will continue to buy expansions and pay the monthly fee for a shoddy product simply because there is nothing better out there.  <P>Tralik Windwielder<BR>51 Pathfinder

While I am inclined to agree with Ghrevil and deadend from page 2 of this thread, I can just as easily see the other side of the arguement. <P>Anyone here with a basic education in business and economics understands the rate of inflation and cost of goods etc etc. (As in why keeping your money in a bank account will never make you any money because your just barely staying above the rate of inflation) <P>That in mind I understand the price hike. Afterall who here remembered when we went to see Episode 1 in the movie theaters and were suprised to see ticket prices went up anywhere from 25 cents to 50 cents a ticket? <P>While I do understand the price increase, I unfortunatly feel this will give us a false sense of assurance. Much like the Israelis being suckered into the idea if they give more land to the Palestinians they will finally get peace, we too may be dupped with such false ideas.<P>My attitude is this:<BR>I dont care much about the price hike, I can deal with that. But I was some results in return. <BR>When I teleport into west commnland I dont want to die because I took 700 points of damage from falling. When I am trading in EC I dont want my bags to just mysteriously disappear. <BR>When I am playong I dont want some 2nd mouse cursor to appear in the middle of the screen. <BR>Stupid things like this is what brings this is what ratlles my chain. I hope Sony (I never understood why people called it Verant .. it is Sony.. sony owns the game) takes the extra money they get from us and BUYS A CLUE!

Still Ghrevil here... Lost my Vaer password so had to make another, and now I found my Vaer again.. ;p<P>Anyway...<P>Xanasbik, I really think you are going to find DAoC isn't any better than EQ and if you think it is, you are going to be majorly disappointed.<P>Anglico, apparently you know taxes, so you would know they don't get 100% of that money in return.  You can claim this loss or cost, but you won't get all that money in return.<P>I am not sure who was concerned about insulting me with the extra costs involved, but no worries.. ;p  I actually put that under 'Controllables'.  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>On to other issues.  The 'principle' doesn't get you anywhere.  Lawsuits and arguments are not won on the 'principle' of things.  It is the 'reality' of things that will win your argument.  The reality is, this is life and EQ has been around since 1999.  They have added, changed, fixed, supported, and even catered to more than you guys will every admit to because of your 'principle'.  Never do you design or alter a game based on the vocal minority, and whether you like it or not you are the vocal minority.  Making a game like that will only make you crash and burn.<P>Of course I believe they should make sure to keep advancing with the money, and that is where my principle lies.  If you are going to charge me more, make sure I get more.  Whether that be more free content, more support, more events, faster bug fixes, whatever.  I have been reading all these numbers saying that make blah blah and that should be enough.  Well, if you run a business you will know that "blah blah" is not enough to keep that business growing.  You can keep making "blah blah" and keep the service the same, the product the same, the store the same, and the customers less than the same.  "Blah blah" is boring and doesn't do anything for the product or the consumer.<P>Also, from what I understand, EQ does not have 500,000 paying subscribers.  They have had 500,000 accounts opened and with accounts closed etc, they are probably at about 250,000 to 300,000 paying subscribers, if that.  Still a high number, but it will bring your figures down a notch.<P>It's really amazing to see people that have no clue what goes into business, gaming or MMORPGs sit here and argue points that can't have any knowledge of without being part of at least one of those items.  Being only a consumer makes people ignorant of the situation and being ignorant of the situation means you won't know the facts.  Leave the game if you don't like the price increase, but don't try to tell Verant you know what they are doing when you have no clue what it takes to do what they do.<P>Oh, one more thing, I am not an employee of Sony, Verant, 989, etc....etc....etc....

Greetings all.  <BR>This is incredible.  I'll start off with the statement and fact that a $3 increase in cost per month indicates that these people have no concept of the word "TACT".  <P>I own 4, count'em 4 EQ accounts and I have three computers networked together and three of the accounts are online at the same time.  That's $12/month more that I have to pay now for a grand total of $51.80/month. Ok so I don't really need cable T.V. if i'm playing EQ.  But seriously, I don't understand why such a huge increase in cost has occurred here.  This is a 30% increase.  Will my 51 Wizzie get a 30% increase in the damage he can do now?  Or 30% increase in my mana regen ability?  no.  Of course not.  The best logical question is ...will i get a 30% increase in service?  I have had several times where I petition and get no response at all.  I petition again and find that my petition is still in the que after HOURS of waiting.  I send in a bug report and don't even so much as get a response that they have received the info that I'm volunteering to them...free of charge...in order to increase the quality of software that I'm PAYING to use already.  <P>The tactful thing to do here, would have been to raise the cost from $9.95/month to $10.95/month  then after 6 months or a year, go to $11.95/month and so on till they got to $12.95.  Obviously somebody woke up and suddenly realized they have not been charging us enough and oh since "...we have not increased the cost for the last 3 years..." we are going to make up for lost time!  Is that the way you KEEP a loyal customer base?  I don't think so.  Yeah, for entertainment value $12.95/month is nothing.  Movies, Ice Skating, Dirt Biking, water skiing...it all costs money and usually much more than $12.95 for a whole month of fun.  Even a good paper back book costs $7.95 or more (new off the shelf).  But with those things, quality of customer service is not part of the package.  <P>Oh yeah, I forgot that on top of all this, you have to PAY $50 per character to have it moved from one account to another on the same server.  If you request to switch servers...not only do you have to pay, you LOOSE all your stuff!!!!  Yes, and especially your quested items that are NO DROP...that can not in any way affect the server's economy.  All that time you spent camping PoF and you finally won the roll...all for nothing.<P>My worry i suppose, is that next month or next year, will they decide to raise the mark another $3.00???  I don't care if i've played since I first started and I have 10 level 60 chars, I'll be finding a place that doesn't have this idea that they haven't been charging enough so it's time to make up for lost time/money without SUBSTANTIALLY increasing their services.<P>There are those who probably think i'm a whinning baby.  Well, friend, I paid enough per month BEFORE the increased monthly charge to have the right to be a whinning baby.  So until you are willing to donate to my cause, you can take a hike.<P>Sincerely Thayland

Ok, ladies and gents...here comes my 2cp...<P>This is a problem, this extra $3.06 a month is rediculous.  The reasons listed for the increase do not justify the increase.  For the past three years EQ has been running on their current budget of $9.89/mo./user.  This being a huge number, ought to cover their expenses for everquest.  Granted its a HUGE game, its by far no nearly the best game.   Don't get me wrong.  I love the game, I'm hooked.  However, most of the time I can't stand looking at the screen.  I'm very into the eye candy, I want beautiful mountains, mist, flowing water...and believe me my computer can handle it.  And I know most everyone who plays EQ has a computer that can handle not the top-notch graphics, but better looking things then what we see...not blocks on blocks.  Thats gripe number one.  <P>I haven't gotten a real chance to run into too many bugs.  I know they exist, I don't get to play just like every one else when they're fixing a problem caused by a fix to another problem cause by a fix....etc etc etc.  Thats bad...but not the worse I've seen.  There are some games out there that continously get pathched, network code constantly changed because people are hacking it, or there are holes here and there for this and that.  All I can say is, I haven't run into any.  Nobody has hacked my account, I've never seen anybody cheat, kudos for that.  So, to everyone who complains about patches...if you don't want the patches stop complaining about the game.  The patches will stop   <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"> Second gripe...<P>Back onto the money thing...ok...here in the US, we look at an average of 3% inflation each year.  That means the cost of living, advertising, salaries, everything and anything you could ever put on an EQ bill...on average...increases about 3% a year.  So, knowing that lets take the original cost of EQ, which I pay $9.89 per month.  Multiply that time 1.03 and you get how much it would cost, or actually how much it should cost to play EQ based on the original price.  Do that multiplication 2 times more and you'll come to the number inflation has dictated for the price of EQ monthly.  My calcs show thats rougly $10.81/mo./user american dollars.  Lets see here, WHERE IS ALL THE OTHER MONEY GOING YOU DOLTS!!!<P>I like one post I saw, I think whoever thought 30% increase is ok should get their @$$ down to my office and tell my boss that I need a 30% increase, and don't tell me I didn't work for it...<P>Utilieas<BR>26 Mage<BR>Brell<P>--------------------<P>----------------------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=160671" TARGET=_blank>Luman</A>, 17 Cleric, Brell<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=160662" TARGET=_blank>Utilieas</A>, 26 mage, Brell

I haven't read all the posts in this thread but i have gotten the gist.  seems everyone is pissed of over two stinking dollars.  What everyone seems to be forgetting is that VI or SOE whichever you want to call it is a business and businesses exist for one reason only. to make money. SOE or VI (what ever) is doing exactly what they and all business everywhere are meant to do. increase profits.<P>--------------------<P>The worlds worst keyboardist

There are some things I expected even before price changes<P>one is more lattatude for guides and gm I believe it is better to have a few people that might take advantage of the system than to penalize a player with a lagitament grievence.<P>second  more zones means diddly to me I have a whole moon full of zones I can hardly use<BR>what I want to see is more in depth quest  I would like to see guides or volunteers  play the roles that some of the very limited inteligence NPCs do.<P>an example  a quest for a pirate treasure  where you must talk to pegleg paul  he has been known to hang around the sea hag tavern  but could be anywhere.<BR>(the volunteer or guide has certain information to issue  possibly a clue to the second piece of the map  the trick is he has lattitude to role play the old sea dog to give the game some spice and a volunteer is not required to sit this 24/7  all it would take would be  access to a special role account  and the specific charactor quest instructions)  maby  pegleg needs to get drunk, or tell him an old sea story, or even threaten him to get him to cough up the info.  whats nice is this would change depending on who is playing the charactor.

Either way, they're huge, and their costs are huge.  What I'm saying is, if they had budgeted $9.89 three years ago and have been running on that number ever since, then something has fouled up top.  More money in their pockets is not justification.  And not being their accountant has nothing to do with it.  Its common sense.  They've been making profit these past three years, otherwise the game would be gone.  They're making profit now!  They're profit margin is just slipping and they're raising costs to keep that profit on par with what it was when the game first came out.  My oppinion is, it shouldn't be.  The game is not on par with anything thats coming out these days, so I'm paying 30% more for a game that isn't 30% better.<P>Your turn...<P>--------------------<P>----------------------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=160671" TARGET=_blank>Luman</A>, 17 Cleric, Brell<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=160662" TARGET=_blank>Utilieas</A>, 26 mage, Brell

Vaer I spent many hours this morning and yesterday doing some web research, reading forums etc for DOAC.  And I think you're right I prolly won't like DOAC--I don't like the RvR aspect of the game.  I like playing casters so i was looking mostly at wiz and eldritch on DOAC.  Many of my RL friends that I play with on EQ like playing melee'r or druid.  So here is my problem with DOAC.  If I start playing DOAC I have no doubt some of my RL will too.  But the problem would be they would likely end up playing a class in a different realm.  So I would never be able to group with them again or even send them /tells cause ppl from one realm can't chat with those from the other ones.  So here is my problem, as a wiz I had dreams of Gandoff from LoTRs, but apparently EQ had Dr Bombay from Bewitched in mind when creating the wiz.<P>--------------------<P>Xanasbik<BR>52 Wiz<BR>Underworld Knights<BR>Zeb

Perhaps there is some misunderstanding here.  Verant/SOE indeed DO need to work on what they ALREADY HAVE before jumping into new expansions.  Every new expansion it has been exactly the same story:<P><B>VI</B>: "Hey look!  We're making a new expansion called Ruins of Kunark.  It will increase content by 30%.  There will be zones for people of all levels... And just LOOK at all the new stuff!  The Iksar are a new playable race!"<BR><B>Customer</B>: "But for the last year people have been screaming at you to fix xxx bug and balance all the classes.  If you release new content, is there a snowball's chance in hell you'll have ANYONE working on that old stuff, or are they all going to be working on fixing the bugs you released with your new expansion?  Do you even HAVE a CS department?"<P>1 Year Later======<BR><B>Verant/SOE</B>: "Look!  We're releasing a new expansion called Scars of Velious.  It will increase world size by 30%!  And even though no players level 34 or below can go there without getting their @$$ handed to them by, of all things, a snow bunny, the players above level 35 have all sorts of pHaT l3wT to explore.  No, there are no new playable races, but we added two new Planes..."<BR><B>Irate Customer</B>: "You still haven't fixed all that old stuff... and are you ever going to balance the classes?

It's called Shadows of Luclin!  We're completely overhauling everything and adding a new race AND new class.  And just look at all the new content!  I bet that's at LEAST 30% of the old world... right?"<BR><B>Customer</B>: "Okay, I see you've been working on, err... balancing the classes... sort of, I guess... but why does it take me 5 minutes to zone, even before I buy the expansion... and hey all my buffs suddenly disappeared?  Why is the Bazaar not implemented?  Why are there missing mobs in the dungeons?  It still costs 300kpp to get 250 tailoring... and my guild could get better loot, much cheaper, and much faster, from sacking ToV and ST... and why do half of the new models look like cheesy comic book cliches?  At least Alternative Advancement is kinda cool.  But... You're never going to get a CS department, are you?

I want to see specifically the new UI and the Bazaar features that were promised with Luclin.<BR>I resisted buying a game that forced me to upgrade my computer, and still performs poorly.<BR>I don't mind the price increase.  Frankly I was surprised that it was so long in coming.

*gathers thoughts together*<P>I apologize now for the long post....<P><BR>I have played the game since as far back as it existed.  I have seen the world of Norrath change hundreds of times over the years.  I have seen some friendships made and many more destroyed.  I have seen loot tear asunder the guilds and friends as the game progresses.<P>In the beginning, it was Norrath, the Old World if you will.  There was much rejoicing in the lands and people came far and wide to play the game.  In time, many reached the level limits of 50th and explored all there was to explore.  classes came into being, like enchanters, that had no real power in the beginning and grew to enormous power.  There were many changes to the game made.  A great many pondered the future of Norrath then.<P>In the wisdom, Kurnark was born.  The people once more rejoiced.  The lands were rushed upon and devoured by the eager people.  The riches and spoils went to those that could find them first.  Secrets were kept as long as possible until the word got out and "BLAM" the loot flooded the markets once more.  All "Old World" stuff became as commonplace as the combine weapons we all fought to buy in the start of the game.  Or perhaps the Runed Totem staves?  In time, all of the "problems" of the "Old World" was forgotten and put aside.<P>In time, the money began to slow.  People flocked to the new games on the market, AO, DAoC and etc.  Many felt this was because of the quality of the games.  Not necessarily the "same genre" of game platform.  In time, some of these same people (even myself) for a time tried these new games.  But in the end, Everquest reigned supreme compared to the rest of the competitors.  Hence, we flocked once more to our beloved world of Norrath.  The other games continued to survive as there are many that feel Sony/VI screwed them over or they had had enough of the poor customer service.<P>Then came Velious.  We hardly had time to really enjoy velious at all and then Shadows of Luclin appeared.<P>Just when things came to head, the Shadows of Luclin were casted across the people of Norrath and the problems once more became just memories to hash on behind the scenes.  SoL made promises beyond compare.  ALL of us raced out, not only to buy the game, but to buy NEW hardware.  For it seemed that the world of Norrath, our beloved world, required even MORE from us.  New hardware.  It wasn't $30 to upgrade to Shadows of Luclin for some, it was $1000-2000.00 for each player to upgrade to handle the engine for Shadows of Luclin.  Many of Norrath once more rejoiced at the beauty and splendor of Shadows of Luclin (myself included).  Again, problems were forgotten or backshelved once more in lieu of a new platform.<P>Then, we all find out about "Legends" and now "Planes of Power".<P><BR>Here is some things to consider, from an old fossil -<P>1.) People leave guilds and friends over loot 85% of the time.  Loot changes wind as fast as the expansions come out.  This is because the expansions MUST be more/better than the prior.  Hence, if people were to stop and think on it - "All of those you fought over to get that one item was pointless because in 9-12 months, a new expansion will be released obsoleting it."   Expansions are NOT just released for the players to have MORE to do, but they are required to drive the "economy" of the game.  To keep the game from stagnating on itself.  Perhaps instead of new expansions, look at ways of improving the game economy.<P>2.) I know I can feel lied to at times from Sony/VI when articles appear saying/quoting, "We currently aren't working on something else, etc etc" and then a month or two later, we find out that you HAD INDEED started something different.  You lied many times on this, and many of us have witnessed it.  Some have stepped forward and spoken out.  Me, I chose to bite my lip and be disappointed.  Foresight is hindsight.  Why do we need MORE EXPANSIONS, Planes of Power for example, WHEN you haven't finished pieces of "Old World", Kurnark, Velious, and Shadows of Luclin?   I mean 3 years, 36 months, you have had 3 major upgrades/expansions.  This does not include ALL the free content.  You are releasing expansions at a minimum of every 9 months.  This means that ALL the bugs are going to be fixed in 9 months WHILE you are writing new code?  I don't buy it.  I think many others don't either.  We ALL know that you feel the only way to rake in the money is to get new content out the door so players have "something" to do.  I just feel that Sony/VI lies to us a lot of the time.  You make us think your fixing the problems, but then turn around and announce new products/services.   I will admit, $10 a month is not a lot to pay, but when there are 400,000+ subscribers a month, that is a lot of money involved. People do notice.<P>3.) There are many promises that have been made over the years, and many of the them have been kept.  We, the players, salute you for this.  However, there have been many promises unkept as well over the years.  We the players wonder HOW/WHEN your going to fix these, when you obviously have other products/services in production?  When are the balancing issues for example going to be done, if your staff is split across multiple services?  You can't keep doing this.  It will bite you in the ass as newer games ARE coming.  You ALREADY know that about half, if not more, of your user base is going to try Star Wars Galaxies.   Many are going to be doing Shadowbane, City of Heroes and World of Warcraft as well.  You have a lot of competition ahead.  If you want to win your customers, win them through your actions.  Customer Service/Tech Support seems to be a major issue.  As I have told others in my life - "If you are not part of the solution, then you are part of the problem."  Take the time now to improve Customer Service/Tech Support.  I will glady pay you your 30% increase for that one item alone.  You lose people because it seems you don't really care about them.  Hence, the "vision" you have, is different than the "vision" we hold.<P>4.) Get out among the players, talk to them more.  Find out what is REALLY going on out there.  Many feel unwanted, unnoticed.  The Legends thing, while be a great monetary factor, really put the rest of the community in a bad light.  It made it seem that - "You want the good stuff, you need to pay for it".   I thought I was already paying for the "good stuff" myself.  Was I wrong?<P>and on and on and on.....<P>In closing, I have played a very long time in Norrath (about 385 days played since retail).  I still have only seen maybe 75% of the old world, 50% Kurnark, 35% of Velious and 15% of Luclin.  I don't have time to enjoy anything new.  You are pushing me at the bit, when the truth is - "We as players, can't keep the pace you've set for us".   I'm tired of paying for more expansions, when I never really get to enjoy them fully.  I will pay your increase, only in hopes that you, as the "vision" will at least take some course of action to better the experience of Everquest for new and old players alike.  Not expansions, not new zones, but better customer service/tech support.  Better in-game support.  Better overall experiences in the game (GM quests and such).  The game has PLENTY of content.  Fix what you have already before the next game comes along and steals your customers....<P><BR>Lunamin Silvermoon<BR>Fossil of Fennin Ro

And one more note: Sony does not buy 405 new computers a year  They just don't.  I know this because every expansion they release ever-more clogged network code.  That is one reason it takes 5 minutes to zone.  That issue is not a bug, not a new feature, it is a result of overclogged code, even when your computer doesn't HAVE the expansion and is thus incapable of using the new expansion structure.<P>They couldn't afford to replace those computers even if they wanted to, and when exactly would this switching occur?  You can't just recopy all that data from the old server 'puters onto new ones.  Since MMOG's are PERSISTENT, there's no tiem for this, and don't think they can recopy that volume of information while a server goes down for 2 hours.  In short, VI/SOE doesn't replace those nifty $10g computers.  They simply make new Legends servers with those nifty new 'puters.  K?<P>I mean, have you ever heard a patch say, 'We were just going to upgrade the computers so we can handle the load/new content?'  Come on now, don't lie to yourselves...  those =obsolete= computers have housed your characters from creation to current day.<P>--------------------<P>That's just the way it is...

What I find funny are the SOE, Verant sympathizers. "Oh they are a buisness, they need to make money, blah, blah, blah" Why should we care about whether they do well or not? They dont care whether I make a good living or not. I dont see Verant emailing me and say "If you are a little short on funds for the rent we will send a check" They do well based on their planning. <P>This whole post is about customers (us) and how we feel as valued customers. Has nothing to do with how much they charge whether they need it or not or anything on those lines. If they increase it to 50 dollars, and the game was what we all dream it would be hell yes we would pay. <P>EQ has not treated us as valued customers. The charges per month, the cost of buying expansions, bugs, and broken promises we were dealing with, all of this was (in my opinion) barely kept us staying with EQ. I think now with the increase per month and a extra expansion in the horizon that we have to pay for has cross the line on giving value to the customer. <P>As customers we should complain and do whats neccessary to show what we dont and do like. Because no matter what the Vision is the customers will always determine the fate.

Sony is cashing in.  This is typically the point where companies lose their edge and go downhill.  Reason is all the key employees know the company is making more money too so they go to the trough to get more.  Then their producivity takes a dive because they start enjoying their freetime more because they have more money so they start calling in sick more, take more time off, leave early, avoid difficult software changes, not to mention the fatigue of working on the same stuff for so long begins to gnaw at them...  time will tell.
