I would like to ask people take a subjective look at what I am about to say below and be <BR>a judge for what has taken place. Thank you for your time.<P>This is what happened today around 3:30 AM Eastern Time on Povar, in the Shadows of Luclin Zone --- thegrey. Since the expanstion started, some of my guildmates and I have been doing AOE exping. Usual group consists of 1 cleric, 1 enc(me), 2 Wizard, 1 puller and 6th person( sometimes melee sometimes caster ). We explored many zones to find good places to do AOE and thegrey was a zone to our liking because of fast respawns of undead mobs and relatively<BR>low hp despite being blue to 60. The key to a good AOE group is making sure the enchanter can successfully continute to AOE chain stun. That is why having my back to a wall is very important because push = spell interruptions. Thus we always find a corner or a wall to put my back in so I can<BR>ancor there and not worry about being pushed by mobs resisting the stuns. With that in mind, we chose one of the corner( was choosen arbitrarily ) in the room where the zone of Mons Letalis meets thegrey(n1800, 270). I ancored myself at corner and have wizards and cleric next to me against the wall while our puller pulls anywhere from 15-35 mobs to us for us to chain stun/AOE. What happened today was while we were doing this( on our 14th hour or so ), all of sudden our mobs pulled suddenly just poofs. After 2 of such episodes, a senior guide named Trigorin appeared and issued us a warning without giving any reason. We asked him why and after not getting a reply we asked for a GM. After waiting around for about 35-40 min and no GM showed up and no explaination offered,<BR>as sudden as Trigorin appeared, he disappeared. We waited around for a few more min and thought prehaps he was mistaken in issuing that warning and just left without further explaination, since people have been doing AOE for years and no rules or regulations said that was illegal.<BR>So we resumed our routine exp grind. Our puller again pulled about 15 or so mobs. As mobs reached us and just as we started casting. My group members one by one went link dead. Trigorin apparently world kicked my group 1 by 1 until I am the only one left with 15 skeletons in front of me and 4 LD group members next to me about to die. So I chain stunned until the resisted mobs<BR>killed me, allowing 2 of my group members to time out while other two died to the mobs after I perished. A guild cleric ressed us and as we sat there expecting an explaination, GM Pelegorian showed up, claiming we are using pathing exploit in that corner to avoid taking dmg from mobs. <BR>I dunno who petitioned in the first place or what Trigorin told Pelegorian, that corner certain has no pathing bugs that we were aware of. Some mobs sometimes get above us on the roof because they didn't follow close <BR>enough and pathed above instead of inside. However, they still hit us through wall/roof. The corner is by no means a safe spot, as I have died no less then 10 times in my long 14 hour day due to pulling too many, or fizzle on my stun or unlucky spell interruption for multiple times.<BR>Whatever it is, there was never any time that we were "safe" from being dmged by mobs we pull. We might appear to be "safe" because I am chain stunning and barring any resists( sometimes I do get very few resists on a pull ), we aren't taking much dmg. That appearance is not caused by "pathing<BR>exploit" or "safe spot". It is the result of well practiced chain stunning and AOE group workingtogether as a unit. So we tried our best to get this point across to the GM, which obvious seemed to be lost on him. Then we offered to demonstrate that what we said is true and what he claimed is not. He refuse to let us demonstrate and after a few unsuccessful try to presuave him to <BR>let us show him the facts, he resorted to removing some of our group member's last names and disappeared afterwards. I normally have a lot of respect for GMs and Guides in general, for I know what they do are unappreciated. And I am usually on friendly terms with most guides and GMs on the server. But this is the first time something this unreasonable has happened in my experience coming from Povar Guide/GMs: not<BR>only do we get a warning for no reason, or<BR>a wrong reason anyways, we were world kicked that caused death and exp loss, and had <BR>our last names removed because GM was angry at us for trying to present facts to him to dispute his claim.<P>Anyways, I would just like to share this with everyone and you can all test out for yourself whether this so called "pathing exploit" exists at that spot( right corner from zone in is what we used, although we could have just as easily used left corner ). This also serve as a warning<BR>to anyone also doing similar grouping/tactics at that spot, for there might be a guide/GM on your homesevrver that will give out warning for the same reason. <P>Yana<BR>60 Enc[Triton].

Yah- heh. I had a GM tell us we had to regroup a mage, that I kicked out of group because he kept asking for haste. <P>Made no damn sense at all, but we had to do it. So we grouped, let him melee and he died. Then he petitioned us for letting him die.<P>I'm sorry this happened to you. He should've explained it better. <P>Must've been a flower. <P>You know - a  Bloomin' Idiot.

Just a heads up yana, i dont really know the exact details of your situation nor do i even know of the spot you were using or any geometry/pathing errors your spot may have.I am also not saying you have cheated.<P>However this:<BR>"<BR>The corner is by no means a safe spot, as I have died no less then 10 times in my long 14 hour day due to pulling too many, or fizzle on my stun or unlucky spell interruption for multiple times."<P>Is not and has never been a valid excuse if in fact there was a pathing issue.<BR>The reason:<BR> There are a lot of players that abuse and cheat the system and claim that the fact that since they are not immune 100% to danger that somehow makes the cheating ok.You can see these peeps in SG for example getting warnings,abusing the horrible pathing or repeatedly charming water mobs/seeking safety on land. Why on this very board so many enchanters claim it is legitimate tactic because somehow along the line they have been exposed to some risk.<P>Here is how the gm is looking at it: it doesnt matter if you have died or not,it doesnt matter if you are exposed to danger or not...what matter is this:<BR>Is there anything in geometry/pathing that you are using/exploiting to make your hunt easier/safer? Is there anything illegitimate that is benefitting you reguardless on wether or not you are 100% safe? If the GM thinks so then he will act.<BR>This is what you need to convince the GM,that you arent aware of any exploitation,not that you have been exposed to some danger, explain the reason why you picked that corner.<P>You should discuss your situation in more details with your gm and failing that with the lead gm (just ask a guide to give you his email address).Make sure you have not been marked (permanent note that tag ya as having 1 exploitation incident on your account)<P>Saltino<BR>Phantasmist

Unfortunately trying to argue with a gm never works and it only makes them do petty things to you like make you all go ld in the middle of a bad fight... sure he could have tp'd you to the 'catbox' (gm prison cell), but it's more fun for them to make you die and lose exp.  In EQ you are guilty if accused by them and  you just gotta take the lumps 'the gods decree...'.  Just tp to near sebillis and go AOE in there.  GM's gotta stick up for their guides or else no one's gonna respect them.  So you got a bs judgement call, it happens all the time.  Argueing with them prob got you all soulmarked instead of just warned.

Ok, here is what happened - i would like to call myself an expert AoE since i have done no less then 400-500 hours of it if not more.<P>Ok, the reason it looked like an exploit is because the mobs stopped in their tracks.  This is because of the lame ass 3 mob hit rule.  Obviously if you are pulling 15-30 mobs you know your sheet and I am not going to talk down.  This is just an alternate explanation you can give to the GM.  Explain the aggro rules to them because some are totally clueless.<P>Ok, back to AoE 101.  Your puller pulled the train.  Only 3 mobs start attacking, you stun, 3 more add...so forth and so forth until you have them gathered for AoE nukes.<P>I can totally see how it could look like an exploit becuase you could have a fricken train from here to kingdom come all just standing there.  That is a tell tale sign of both AoE and exploiting.  In exploiting safe spots mobs just stand there.  In AoE mobs just stand there because the puller/group is already maxed out in number of mobs that can attack.  Both look the same but one is TOTALLY legit and one is not.  <P>I would push strongly to have that warning expunged.  It is totally unfair and part of how EQ works.  Aoe is not cheaing.  It is the single best way to AoE in EQ.  A server GM should know about how aggro works and if not then you need to hit CS directly.  <P>BTW, look for a mage for your 6th spot.  They can single handly increase AoE groups 10 fold.  Why?  Because they have a pet to deal with single pulls and most importantly have mod rods to even out mana.  Puller + cleric + chanter + 3 burners rocks.  If you are lucky make your puller a bard  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>Anyhow, i babbled but this is a serious topic that needs to be explained to your server GM.<P>-slizz<BR>Slayer of good and evil scum on SZ

OK, let me play counterpoint to the conspiracy theorists here.  First of all there are people at Verant that are full aware of how much exp you can get doing AE.  It exceeds what the highest efficiency standard exp group can do, but not so much so that it would be on the cutting block.  It is also fairly risky and all but the best groups end up doing CR's, which cut it back closer to a standard group.  The potential for AE has been known since beta and unless there are new abilities that trivialize it, I highly doubt that there needs to be a change.<P>Now that does not say that your particular GM was really aware of how it worked, but they should at least know about the enchanter's stun cycle.  It also sounds like you caught your guide in a foul mood and one or more of you ticked him off further.  They usually don't do petty acts like removing last names unless someone was being a pita.  We had ragefire buffed in the only run I ever encountered with the GM's.  Jerks could have ruined the epic.  Though I won't pretend that guild didn't deserve it.  <P>Anyway, here is a more likely scenario.  You picked a spot that actually does have pathing issues.  Not because it had pathing issues but because it was a good set up point.  You even said yourself that some were getting up on the roof.  Then you (or otheres) ignored his warnings and were confrontational.  If you had moved to a different spot I bet he wouldn't have freaked.  Pathing issues are pretty obvious when you are looking at them from the outside.  And, when the guides find out about them, they can and do pop in GM invis and see if anyone is abusing them.<P>Suna

Here's the funny thing about the "exploiting in SG."  Let's say an enchanter is jumping into the water, charming a sea horse, sending it into the fray, and jumping back to land where it's safe.  Okay.  The exploit here is that once the charm wears off, the seahorses can't get to you because you're no longer in the water.<P>This is a great deal different from exploiting pathing, let's look at it this way:<P>I'm standing at the edge of a pool in Sea World with a shot gun.  I take a shot at, say, a dolphin.  Now, I'm up on land... how is this "mob" going to do anything about me shooting at it in the pool?  It can't, really.  It can't come up out of the water.  And it would be REALLY STUPID if the Sea horses in SG could pop up out of the water and come get you.<P>As opposed to...<P>I'm on a safari somewhere with a shot gun, I take a shot at, say, a lion.  If that lion doesn't fall over dead (Or say I miss) there's no reason it shouldn't be able to pummel my butt into the ground.  If this lion runs back and forth in front of me without touching me, that would be bad pathing.<P>At least killing the sea horses in SG and not having them pop up on land to get you is somewhat realistic. =P  I can't see how anyone would honestly expect the enchanter to stay in the water while trying to fight them.<P>As for the GM LDing folks while fighting.. that was BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE.  If they were exploiting, should they have been told to stop?  Yes.  Should they have been warned?  Yes.  Forced LD and left to die?  Hell no.  At worst, the GM should have /killed the mobs, put a mark on their records, and if continued possibly kicked out of the game and put the names in his/her report for further review (Possible suspension).  But I can't see ANY excuse for rendering them LD in the middle of a fight knowing darn well most of them would die.  That's heartless and rude.<P>Of course, this is just my opinion and may (And likely doesn't)not reflect the opinion of others.<P>--------------------<P>- Ssela

That sucks. People are paranoid enough since the &#8220;Sleeper&#8221; fiasco. I would have though the Verant would be a little more observant since then.<P>Take this to the top. Hey, worst that can happen is that Enchanter color series gets nerfed.<P>SoL has a lot of issues. Verant has to understand this. I truly believe that you had no idea of a pathing issue if one existed. I can say that because something similar happened to my group in Greigs End.<P>There was a mob on a platform that we targeted and nuked as soon as we got in the room. After a few seconds, I noticed something wasn&#8217;t right and told the group to stop. The mob couldn&#8217;t get of the platform. I went and stood right next to it and it couldn&#8217;t even hit me. <P>Now, I did the petition thing first, but I wasn&#8217;t going to risk death either. I knew it would be hours (SoL second day) before I would hear from a GM. So, using a staff that procs &#8220;knock back&#8221;, I was able to get the mob down and it immediately began to chew on me. We continued for hours and each time that mob would respawn, I would knock it off so it could attack. Every time I did I was thinking, &#8220;Great, here I am assisting a mob so it can attack me and the GM is going to finally show up and claim that I am cheating.&#8221; But that didn&#8217;t happen. A GM never showed.

Now thats a good question...<P>Would jumping in the water, dotting something, and then jumping out be considered an exploit?  I would think that that is just physics...a shark can't come out to get you...just like you HAVE to go in to get it.  <P>This all comes back to mob intelligence...verant hasn't written any in so they have to "cheat" to make the mobs challenging.  <P>My favorite example is from when I first got levitate...I thought "Great, now I can get to places where the monsters can't get me".  I levitated up to a nice rooftop and zapped the first mob that came into range.  All of a sudden he's climbed 2 stories in 1 second and pounds me to pulp.  Wouldn't that be a mob EXPLOITING me?  I think he should of at least gotten a warning.<P>--------------------<P>Ootpek Ubiqutous<BR>50th enchanter of Xev<P>Ubiquitous:Being or seeming to be everywhere at the same time; omnipresent.

Sleepers Bit<P>Uber Guild gets its name and many of its members banned. What did they do?<P>To defeat the warders, they used 2 things.<BR>1. They placed mages under a bridge. While the Clerics chain-healed tanks, the Mages would CoH them under the bridge where they were safe from attack (unless summoned).<BR>2. Used the Rez Effect in some way that I don&#8217;t understand.<P>While doing this, the GMs were secretly watching. The even logged them saying to each other that they were cheating. Verant never posted these logs (complete anyway) for people to see and I&#8217;m willing to be it was something like &#8220;I bet Verant would consider this exploiting&#8221;. Before the last warder died, the GM &#8220;spawned&#8221; the sleeper (whos model was a huge human) and he wiped out everything in the zone. The bannings commenced soon afterwards and a huge debate of the whole EQ community began. <P>For the Guild<BR>1. Most people considered it to be a legitimate tactic. The considered it very clever and not cheating because there were many deaths and the attackers were not 100% safe from attack. <BR>2. Many felt like Verant acted like a spoiled child because the players outsmarted them. Plus, due to the GM spawning the sleeper (and they swear they cant spawn mobs&#8230;heh), screenshots showed that the programming was incomplete for that zone. Verant denied this at first,  then admitted to it later.<BR>3. Many thought it pretty lame that the GMs would hide and watch them continue and not stop their actions immediately.<P>For Verant<BR>1. These guys were not necessarily &#8220;innocent&#8221;. Many had prior warnings on their accounts.<BR>2. Err&#8230;.I cant think of another&#8230;but anyway.<P>What came out of this was the whole player community started to question what was an exploit? Verants original answer was that it a MoB was unable to fight back, then it was an exploit. Not a very good answers considering things like &#8220;root nuking&#8221;. Heck, even the Warders was able to attack back, just not as well as Verant intended them to.   <P>I think the last statement made was that they would &#8220;investigate&#8221; possible exploitations. If a player/party were unaware that what they were exploiting (unless obvious like nuking from on top of a house), they would just be told to stop without actually marking their account. After reading about your deal, I guess I remember wrong : (

like has been said before, if he was exploiting a safespot how did he die when they ld'd his group?  aoe groups have never been considered a exploit, and if you say they have please point to some documentation dont just expect us to believe it cause you say so.  and as far as the 3 mob hit rule (i thought it was 4 but thats neither here nor there) magicians and necros griped about this forever because it applied to their pets also.  they could put 12 pets on a mob but only 3 or 4 hit the mob the rest just stand there.  i am not sure if verant ever fixed this for pet classes since they changed the way the game handles pets (i bet against it though).  how can an aoe group be considered exploiting the games ai?  <P>the only thing i can see he may have done wrong is doing it near a zone line.  better to do it in an out of the way place to prevent killing innocent bystanders, there are plenty of other places in the grey to do it.  we used a zone wall last night and were doing 35 mobs with a group of 4  =)

The 'Sleeper' incident was with Conquest (don't recall the server). They were in the process of getting owned by the 4th warder when someone in VI killed it causing sleeper to get spawned. The zone designer (sorry, don't recall the name) and a couple other VI employees were watching it.<P>As for VI watching and letting it happen, why not? First, they have a legitimate reason to watch, to see if the scenario plays the way they think it should (i.e. programmed to), and to let the 'suspects' produce enough evidence to convict or acquit themselves. It's not entrapment because VI didn't suggest that they use the tactics they did. Did VI misinterpret what evidence they gathered? Yep, big time. But apparently there was enough that they felt demonstrated that Conquest was exploiting something. VI also decided to nerf CotH so there had to be a significant change in location to clear the agro. The rez effects prevented the slow effect from the warder from taking because it didn't stack with rez. Which Conquest knew, but in their defense should they have not rezzed people and given up? And it's obvious that VI can spawn mobs at will - *some* VI people can at least. They spawned mobs for the BotB, they regularly respawn the planes and zones when needed. What they are not *allowed* to do is spawn mobs on a whim. *Can't* doesn't necessarily mean they are unable to.<P>In this incident, however, there was some major non-communication and abuse of power. The GM should have, on the initial warning, told them what the warning was for. Changing their names and world-kicking them was just a petty abuse of power.<P>I've been in a few AE groups and you definately want your back in a corner if at all possible to reduce interrupts. Why is that exploiting world geometry? I've used corners of buildings in CoM and KC, and they're definately not safe spots or pathing errors.<P>--------------------<P>Max<P>Level 56 Druid, level 51 Enchanter and level 16 Cleric of Mischief

A couple things:<BR>1. The reason why we know anyone can get hit through the wall is that there are roamers or stragglers that sometimes goes above us and aggro on us and hit us through wall/roof.<P>2. I know what a safe spot is( example. Fire pot in lower guk; right stairs in Karnors ). This corner is not a safe spot. <P>3. Pathing, mob pathing is the same regardless where in that zone you are at, as long as you are ancored in a corner. I have tried 4-5 diff spots since then, some mobs will stagger behind others and get stuck by obstacles for a time no matter which spot I used. Verant did their best to fix pathing by having mobs "port" on to their targets. It is exactly what happens after a slight period in which some getting stuck by obstacles in reaching us.<P>4. AOE groups are the most efficient exp groups, but not unbalancing. A very good melee group or a decked melee soloing( with some help on buffing/healing ) come close to the exp gain of AE group. It's merely a heck a lot of better then wizards and enchanters trying to solo.<P>Anyways, I have sent email to Lead GM/Guides and someone from guild talked to server GM on Povar. They are currently investigating the issue.

Well, if anyone somehow missed it, Verant has had its say in the matter.  Evidently, 'Exploiting' is now defined as performing any action or series of actions which result in a gain of experience which is out of line with the risk taken to gain that experience. See the links below.<BR> <BR>And I have to say that I agree with them.  Not with their solution in the Grey, which unfairly penalizes EVERY caster that sets foot in the zone (which amazingly, they seem to realize!), but I'm sorry--theres no way in H E double-L that any single group should be able to walk into a zone and tackle 40+ exp-giving mobs <B>at once</B> and survive, let alone prosper. Even with the 'occasional' death.  Such a match should result in the complete wipeout of the party, save gating/evacing.  Debates as to whether it's faster or slower than the "holy trinity" are irrelevant, the point is <B>it should not even be possible. </B><P>Yah, whine about it.  It was an exploit, plain and simple.  Now casters are useless in that zone, except for being buff ho's.

Sigh,<P>The problem is, people keep trying to apply logic to the issue. This isn't suceptible to logic.  (watches everyone boggle)<P>This is a DESIGN issue.  Verant is aiming for  a scenario that promotes a <B>balanced</B> group fighting its way through obstacles.  Not an unbalanced group annihilating half the zone at once and then repeating 20 minutes later.  A figure I am suspicious of, BTW.  <P>It is entirely logical to be able to do AE groups  It is also poor design, as who'd bother being a tank?  You only need one...but AE nuking casters, hey, thats the class to be!  People complain enough about how the "holy trinity" is so necessary--how do you think the player base would feel about 68% of the players in any group needing to be nukers to get max xp?  <P>I'll give you as simple an example as possible of design vs. logic.<P>Logically, in a game of checkers, you could say "you know, I'll just use these red colored squares to move my checkers. The designer put them on the board, so he must have meant for them to be used. Then I'll move my pieces all the way over to the far end with impunity (because the other player is locked into playing a set way) king them all, and have twice the mobility!  The other player can't beat me then, even though he may take a few of my pieces at best."<P>So my advice is this. If you don't like the rules being set up, in fact <B>designed</B> to channel the game in a certain direction, take your checkers and go home.  Or to any other MMORPG.  Verant just decided to use the red squares too.  I hope they find a better solution, but one was definately needed.<P>Elizor<P>PS: final note--if an AE group <B>REALLY</B> doesn't get xp faster than a "standard group" then why are the AE'rs in such an uproar?  Seems they'd just shrug over VI's being absurd and go find another type of group, doesn't it?

In my experience it doesn't take 20 minutes to med from OOM to FM, even without clarity or C2. My 56 druid will med to full in about 12 minutes. Add C2 and it would drop to about 9. Pack Chloro (400 mana) and in 10 minutes you've recovered 1000 hps on 6 group members. Nearly full recovery in 10 minutes. I also tend to think that the estimation of a 6 mob pull every 3 minutes is a bit optimistic.<P>And apparently VI is still in the process of tuning The Grey. Check the news, but they've reduced the MR of mobs from the initial MR buffup (over-reaction), and added a uncommon spawn that is fairly resistant, in an attempt to make AOE groups viable in The Grey but not overpowering. They have also increased fire and cold resists on the mobs.<P>--------------------<P>Max<P>Level 56 Druid, level 51 Enchanter and level 16 Cleric of Mischief

I'd like to know the approximate level of the AoE groups in the Grey(Gray?).  I'd assume they were mid to upper 50s.  Personally, I don't see why we shouldn't be able to do that at higher levels.  I mean, at levels 1-50, maybe that would be "exploiting" or whatever you want to call it. But in the mid 50's, you've paid your dues, you've walked the treadmill, you should be powerful. I don't think that every zone out there should be like the former Grey, but I think specific and occasional zones that are more suited for AoE groups would provide another dynamic of gameplay.  I guess what I'm saying is, I don't see anything wrong with zones where the "holy trinity" is king, let those who don't want to AoE go there. But as a balance, I think it would be nice to have a zone where you can AoE with ease.  If we can't be powerful at level 50, 55, or 60, how long do we have to wait? Until level 70?<P>Don't get me wrong, power isn't everything. But at higher levels, I think you've earned the ability to take down 57 mobs if you can.<BR>The Grey seemed to provide a perfect atmosphere for that. <P>INvoir

"Well, if anyone somehow missed it, Verant has had its say in the matter. Evidently, 'Exploiting' is now defined as performing any action or series of actions which result in a gain of experience which is out of line with the risk taken to gain that experience."<P>The risk associated with AoE groups is inline with the exp gain because such tactics has far greater risk then standard groups. Many trivial things can go wrong that can cause wiping out of the entire group and if you carefully read the post above, we died about 10 times in a 14 hour period. That is far more death then your usually run of the mill melee group. At our lvl and with our gear, there is almost 0 risk associated with melee group in the zones where aoe groups are exping, there is little risk even without enchanters and clerics. The second best group combination for gaining exp we have found is 5 melee + 1 bard. With top gear, dmg taken is reduced so much that bard regen is enough to keep people healed and bard songs + 5 melee makes the group kill faster then standard melee setup. Even that kind of groups have almost no risks. <P>As for the exploit, I clearly mentioned we were warned for "pathing exploit", not for using the aoe tactics. In fact, my server GM and Lead GM plus a bunch of Verant staffs observed my group doing aoe in sebilis just a couple days ago and approved that our tactics are well within the rules of the game and there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. That clarifies the fact that Verant admits AOE is a legal tactics.

crimsonsplat, normally i ignore posts like yours but your really annoyed me because none of your arguments have any foundation.<P>"Evidently, 'Exploiting' is now defined as performing any action or series of actions which result in a gain of experience which is out of line with the risk taken to gain that experience."<P>i read the link you posted and cant find a single place where they state this is the definition of an exploit.  matter of fact he specifically states aoe's are a valid tactic.<P>"The problem is, people keep trying to apply logic to the issue. This isn't suceptible to logic."<P>i would suggest to you to never use this argument again lol.<P>"It is entirely logical to be able to do AE groups It is also poor design, as who'd bother being a tank? You only need one...but AE nuking casters, hey, thats the class to be! People complain enough about how the "holy trinity" is so necessary--how do you think the player base would feel about 68% of the players in any group needing to be nukers to get max xp?"<P>first of all if you are referring to 4 casters and a cleric and chanter that number works out to 66.666% which does not round up to 68%.  i can only imagine how they would feel when the group only wants one melee, because they are always trying to get 3 or four of us chanters into a group.  oh no wait, they only want one chanter, but 3 warriors is fine.  aoe groups can do maybe a handful of zones in the whole game, a cleric and 5 melees can do ANY zone.<P>"Yah, whine about it. It was an exploit, plain and simple. Now casters are useless in that zone, except for being buff ho's. Gratz on your wonderful accomplishment."<P>it was NOT an exploit as was stated by verant (perhaps they will consult you for your opinion later) and also you are level 40, did we ruin a zone you are too low to even fight in for you?  terribly sorry.<P>and i dont even have a clue what your checkers analogy was about your gonna have to explain that.
