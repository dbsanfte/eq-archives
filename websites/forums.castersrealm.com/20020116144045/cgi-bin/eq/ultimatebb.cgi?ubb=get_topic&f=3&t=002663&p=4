not going to repost here what i already posted in the warrior forum.<P>Will say thay should have uped taunt and i mean way up for warriors with this extra dmg everyone else is doing it is going to make it near impossable to taunt. For that matter it already is near that now to take agro away from a ranger, monk or SK most of the times it just doesn't happen. Then the next thing you know your getting blamed cause you were not taunting and the ranger died.<P>It's no win and this just makes it worse.<P>--------------------<P>Tinena Moonblade Champion <BR>Povar

I would first like say that Verant is doing a great job with their coding and bug fixing.<P>As to the changes that will be entered soon, I welcome every single one of them. But, in time I expect to see improvements to the magic resistance to enable to casters to be more effective. Plus an additional change to the warrior taunt to allow them to pull the attacks.<P>One of the points I would like to make is this: Monks were designed to produce more melee damage in a face to face fight than any other class. Rogue get to do more damage from the back side of a fight. The warriors are designed to take the NPC punishment along with the massive weapon versatility.  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" border="0"> <P>As for the Dual classes, you need to look at what you have vs what you don't have. What I mean is look at the armor you can wear, the power of your spells, the number of attacks you get etc. If you can cast spells you will not be able to stand toe to toe like a warrior or a monk. Plus if you sit back and try and cast nothing but spells you will never out perform a pure caster. So what is the design of your class  <IMG SRC="confused.gif" border="0">  Rangers are designed to be more fighter than caster. Druids are designed to be more caster than fighter. Shamans are more caster than fighter. Palidans mimice a cleric but are more fighter than anything else. Sks are more of a fighter than their mimic the necro. Finally the Bard is the fighter of the druid.<P>As for Pure casters, when verant fixes the magic resistance so you don't fail as often your lives will be fine. As for enhancements beyond that, I see that the SoL has additional spells for every spell caster. What is the problem  <IMG SRC="confused.gif" border="0"> If you truly understand your role as a player you should realize that this game is not designed to be a SOLOist. This game is designed for team work for a common goal (just like real life). With that idea in mind any changes to the game, if they are in favor of the team goals, should be welcomed.<P><BR>Great Job Verant and keep up the good work.

These changes are good, but they aren't what should have been fixed first.<P>Casters/Priests have not gotten the proper attention they deserved in quite some time now, and a lot of us caster types would like to see our needs addressed instead of ignored.<P>First, Melee have the ability to regen their hitpoints with a variety of fairly campable and available regeneration type items.  The only thing that casters have available to them are very rare and difficult to get flowing thought items.  Let me put it a different way - CT drops the caster "regen" item.  The myconid spore king drops the melee "regen" item.<P>Furthermore, Nukers damage is pathetic compared to melee.  Sure Wizards were thrown a bone with the dragon bane spells, but what about dr00ds and Mages?  Mages summon shards of the core, then go sit down.  Dr00ds buff circles, then go sit down.  Clerics trying to solo a single undead mob at high levels?  Forget about it.  My level 60 cleric with 226wis and ~500 mana had to med kite the ancient jarsath in FV for a half hour.  (that's a green con btw).  Has anyone at Verant tested trying to solo an undead with like a level 58 cleric?  Expel undead is pathetic.<P>These are the changes that I think need addressed:<BR>1)  mana regen items made a bit more available for casters instead of being only available to god farming uberguilds.<P>2)  Dmg output increased for casters.  Cleric dmg vs. undead for instance.<P>3)  Ability to nuke high level mobs for non wizard classes, if even for small amounts...<P>4)  Primary specialization cap increased.<P>5)  Secondary specialization caps increased.<P>6)  Wis and Int "soft" 200 cap increased.<P>7)  Melee skill caps increased for non melee classes.<P>and finally something that I'd like to see, if for nothing more than fun...<BR>Give the clerics bash.  I can swing my shield, I swear!!!  look I can move my shield arm!<BR>/raise

Here's my thoughts on the whole thing after posting a few times already.   <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">  I'm a ranger and I love my class. (*Damn you R.A. Salvatore!*) <BR>Triple attack is a horribly bad idea.  I don't know how often I have out damaged the primary tank during a battle.  It doesn't happen all the time, but when the Uber mob smacks you 4-10 times for 90+ damage before the warrior can taunt them off you, as a ranger you'll be dead in no time. I don't know how many times I've tried to take on a blue mob just to have my ass handed to me making me flee for zone.<BR>Upping the defense is not a bad idea, but just a few points seems a little meager.   <BR>Here's what I think that rangers should really recieve:<BR>****************<BR>- Our defense should be increased more than 10 points.<BR>- Tripple attack should go the way of the dodo.<BR>- Give us a disipline that no one else has that people want.  Thus giving us a reason to be in a group. Classes that already have this are: Enchanters give da crack, Clerics keep ya alive, Warriors are the meat shield, rougues have that nasty backstab, Shammys have the stat buffs, Druids keep you speeded up (Sow Sow Sow), Monks are the pullers.

<BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Caelaiena:<BR><STRONG>These changes are good, but they aren't what should have been fixed first.<P>Casters/Priests have not gotten the proper attention they deserved in quite some time now, and a lot of us caster types would like to see our needs addressed instead of ignored.<P>First, Melee have the ability to regen their hitpoints with a variety of fairly campable and available regeneration type items.  The only thing that casters have available to them are very rare and difficult to get flowing thought items.  Let me put it a different way - CT drops the caster "regen" item.  The myconid spore king drops the melee "regen" item.<P>Furthermore, Nukers damage is pathetic compared to melee.  Sure Wizards were thrown a bone with the dragon bane spells, but what about dr00ds and Mages?  Mages summon shards of the core, then go sit down.  Dr00ds buff circles, then go sit down.  Clerics trying to solo a single undead mob at high levels?  Forget about it.  My level 60 cleric with 226wis and ~500 mana had to med kite the ancient jarsath in FV for a half hour.  (that's a green con btw).  Has anyone at Verant tested trying to solo an undead with like a level 58 cleric?  Expel undead is pathetic.<P>These are the changes that I think need addressed:<BR>1)  mana regen items made a bit more available for casters instead of being only available to god farming uberguilds.<P>2)  Dmg output increased for casters.  Cleric dmg vs. undead for instance.<P>3)  Ability to nuke high level mobs for non wizard classes, if even for small amounts...<P>4)  Primary specialization cap increased.<P>5)  Secondary specialization caps increased.<P>6)  Wis and Int "soft" 200 cap increased.<P>7)  Melee skill caps increased for non melee classes.<P>and finally something that I'd like to see, if for nothing more than fun...<BR>Give the clerics bash.  I can swing my shield, I swear!!!  look I can move my shield arm!<BR>/raise</STRONG><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>/sigh<BR>you make the other casters with valid points seem irrational.<P>you want verant to higher the offensive abilities vs undead for clerics? um... are you MAD? your a group peice. you heal. in sacrifice for your vastly superior healing ability, you do piss poor damage output. if you want to do damage vs undead, make a necro or an sk.<BR>you want to be able to melee as well? well  i am certain you picked the wrong class... what you wanted was a shadow knight.<P>although you do have alot of valid points.<BR>it would be useful if they raised or better yet removed the int/wis cap. i dont even know why they have it. mages and necros should also get a form of "bane/lure" spells as well. it should do about half as much damage as the wizards.<BR>in addition, charisma should affect the resist rates on your spells.<P>--------------------<P>Noonie

My take on it -<P><B>New melee tables.</B>  The way I read this, Warriors, Rogues, and Rangers stay where they are, SK's and Pallies get a bump (to the existing melee table), and Monks get a new table all their own.  Oh goody.  More damage for monks.  So now, instead of two Iksar monk twinks soloing mobs at zone-ins, we'll have four.  Was there any doubt among people who actually play the game that Monks already deal significantly more damage than any melee class other than Rogues?  Any doubt at all?  It just boggles my mind that one of the few things that ISN'T broken about melee damage gets changed.  To give them more damage (relative to tanks) with no aggro management changes to either class seems a little screwy.  I imagine you'll be seeing a lot more flopping in the middle of fights.<P>The bump to SK's and Pallies is appropriate and far overdue.  These potentially fun and interesting classes are everybody's laughing boy.  Yes, they have some handy utility spells and what-not, but Verant created the high level encounters to be about melee damage output, and Pallies/SK's have no place in that model.  The way things have gone for these guys, though, I have my doubts that Verant is interested in making a change that will be big enough to be meaningful.<P>Rogues already set the standard for damage output and it doesn't need to be raised.<P>It seems to me that Rangers do significant damage and that to give them more damage would mean that they will have even more problems dealing with aggro.  Give them an effective Jolt and leave melee output where it is.<P>Warriors.  Jesus, what were they thinking?  No damage output increase, no changes to taunt, and increased damage from Monks.  Life just got worse.  Still, my guess is the ratio of Warriors lfg to Hybrids lfg will remain around Zero to A_Lot.<P><B>Two Handed Weapons.</B>  Leave it to Verant.  Players scream for a year about the 2HS model and how it's broken and how nobody uses them.  It's been going on so long that people have given up on it and just assume that it's supposed to be that way.  Then Verant comes out with a statement that makes it sound like some Nobel Prize level of research was required to figure out that 2HS is broken.  I mean for ****'s sake how many consecutive misses do you have to have to have before you figure out that you're better off with a fast one-hander that hits for 70% twice as often?  I know, I know - I shouldn't whine when they fix things.<P><B>Rangers.</B>  Defense cap increase.  Cheers, you deserve it.  Triple attack.  Hmmm, this looks like a "careful what you wish for".  Hey, maybe they'll fix Jolt.    <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P><B>Bards.</B>  Shrug.  It's nice that the ones who like to melee will get to feel less bad about it.  I've always felt that they are just amazing when played with all instruments, but it's nice to give them some improvement to the melee option.  A bonus to a difficult class.  Cheers.<P>What They Should Have Done:  All of the above, except ...<P> - Keep monks on the same table, for the reasons noted above.<BR> - Limit triple attack to monks.  I really don't see this as an "improvement" to Rangers.<BR> - Signicantly increase the Defensive skills for Pallies and SK's.  Sk's, in particular, are supposed to be taunting mofos, but their defense, AC, and HP's are all significantly lower than a Warrior of similar level.  Why give them the ability to taunt and then make them look like n00bs if they use it?<BR> - Bump Taunt for Warriors.  Something tells me they're going to need it ...<P>Lumine

For those saying that more abilities should be given to the hybrids to help "bridge the gap" between them and melees, are you in support of giving the pure melee's some utility spells to help "bridge the gap" as well?<P>Geez, have you ever heard of balance?<P>Hybrids have had the xp penalty removed for all intents and purpose, melee caps changed, defense or offense increased, given their own disciplines (Yes, I know most aren't as useful as a warriors defensive, but the Rangers arrow disc kicks ass).<P>Sigh.<P>Cao

Reading the comments here, this is what I think people really want ...<P>Everquest to be easy. No challenge.<P>Yep, that's right. Warriors are saying that they will have a tougher time keeping agro. Shadowknights are useless because they don't get triple attack. Rangers are useless because they DO get triple attack, and will be smacked down even more.<P>Don't people realize that Everquest SHOULD require some finesse? What fun would it be if you pressed the 'a' button and everything took care of itself? Warriors outtaunted everybody. Monks did crazy damage without fear of retaliation, Rangers never had to worry about agro, etc.<P>How about using a bit of skill? Don't expect things handed to you on a silver platter.<P>The way I've seen it, battles just got a lot more interesting. The potential damage dealt by melee has been upped. But so has the danger.<P>How 'bout mixing it up. Swap in some 2 handed weapons now. Step back from attack and cast a spell, or throw a dagger.<P>Everquest isn't and shouldn't be about going 100% all the time. It DOES require tactics and strategy to be most effective. I personally appreciate that aspect to the game. And I think the changes have added a new layer of strategy. Which is great!  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">

Pure classes should specialize and be the best, but nothing more.</STRONG><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>i can only imagine that this is being addressed to me, as i posted that hybrids by design shouldnt be more effective at anything than either parent class (the colorful word i used was that they should suck). and if not, im going to address this anyway.<P>hybrids, people should only play for fun. because they could be replaced by either of their parent classes and have it be better for the group. you cant honestly believe that having 2 paladins is better for a group than having a warrior and a cleric?<BR>look, the game as it is now only has room for people who are the BEST at something. there is no room for a paladin with weak damage output, and weak healing abilities, or an sk with weak melee, and weak offensive spells. it's just unrealistic.<BR>your claim that hybrids should be more powerful than pure classes is completely untrue. if you are talking about pvp, then yes, you are right. a warrior or a cleric should not be more powerful than a paladin 1 on 1. but if you honestly believe that any normal xp group would be better off with 2 sks rather than 1 warrior, and 1 necromancer... youre insane. pure classes are made to complement each other and work together. a hybrid who is not a specialist in ANY field is only a detriment to a group.<P>in addition, my REAL gripe is how verant is bending over backwards to make the poor hybrids feel useful, when they are the way they are by class design.<BR>in contrast, you have the mages and necros, the two classes who by far need the biggest boost, both pure casters who are only in their menial position due to flaws in game design...and they receive NOTHING time and time again.<P>--------------------<P>Noonie

I hear that arguement a lot about clerics being healers only (as opposed to being able to kill an undead), and I've even seen reference to the aforementioned posted by VI on occasion.  Please pardon I don't have a reference handy.  However it still doesn't diffuse the fact that it's nearly impossible to solo a very low blue con or high green con for a high level cleric, and I don't mean to suggest either that the cleric is a soloing class.  I simply want to be able to kill mobs that I must to do certain quests when the melee types will roll their eyes and laugh at you for requesting help because you are not capable of killing them.  Is that fair because we can heal well?  <P>The point of my post was to agree with many of the posts that I see here, in that the chasm between melee and casters grows wider with this change, and it leaves a sour taste in the mouths of casters and priests who feel somewhat impotent in the high level game.  (with reguards to nuking classes, not suggesting that a cleric belongs listed amoung them)<P>I beg pardon for anyone who thinks this was off topic, perhaps I was too specific on why I think that VI's development time was spent in the wrong area...

Okay, Atarax, I obviously can't make a joke without someone saying something back.  Normally, I just ignore people like you, but I've got a bit of free time right now.<P>Atarax, you really are a moron.  No really.  You may not have noticed it, but you really are a moron.<P>I think you failed reading comprehension when you were in school.  Did you actually read my whole post?  In case, you hadn't figured it out, I was indirectly addressing PvP concerns.  I think that Verant changes people's class expectations, and that these changes can be particularly felt on PvP servers.  Maybe that's why I made the parenthesized remark about see-invis, "(important change on PvP servers)".  Ya' think?<P>Are you literate?  Is English your first language?<P>I obviously meant the first part of my post as a joke, hence the phrase "Seriously, though...".  <P>Let me repeat:  "Seriously, though...".<P>Let me give a bit of remedial explanation, since you've demonstrated the need for it.  The 'fixation with rangers' bit is a poorly veiled suggestion that Verant doesn't look at all classes fairly and equally.  I can't believe that you read any of my ranger complaints that seriously.  Do you need momm y to hold your hand to interpret text for you?  Maybe you took my suggestion about giving shaman backstab and enchanters Harm Touch seriously, too.  <P>I'm not trying to make definitive statements about specific class comparisons.  In fact, I didn't unless you take the part about shamans getting backstab and enchanters having Harm Touch seriously.<P>Gee, I wonder why I called you a moron...<P>I don't wonder why I called you a moron, Atarax.  You deserved it for poor reading skills and poor manners.

Monks *were* meant to do significantly more damage than warriors from the beginning. VI just out and out said it, but it was well known before that. It was that way pre-Kunark, and so shall it be again. Warriors are still going to be the best meat shields, but monks are going to be catching up to rogues slightly as damage dealers.<P>Hybrids *were* meant to be viable as melee to a greater extent than they were. This has been addressed now. Hybrids pay a lot for their abilities, and there's nothing wrong with having them improved a little.<P>All the folks arguing against these changes because they 'widen the gap' are morons. There is a job for everyone on big raids, and any halfway decent guild knows it.<P>Read Kendrick's post if you care for a little enlightenment. Next is the caster's go under the knife. I'm fairly sure we'll be finding new dropped spells in the patches over the next few months. Maybe even new items with cooler effects for casters.

Well I have to say that Sk and Pali's need a hugh boost in some area.  I am currently a 59 sk on solusek ro and have really lost my desire to play my sk. <BR>First off I still dont have my epic, I would bet that almost all rogues and monks have theirs way before sk or pali's get theirs.  <BR>I miss so much its pathetic. Sk and Pali dm output is not just below other melee/hybred classes it is laughable.  When your talking about taking out a mob like Treah in PoG with 250+K hps a single sk might do 3-4 K. We would never use spells on such mob because if we get aggro we are dead and risk the success of the entire raid. Our spells at high level are ok to decent but I have to say that the spells they plan to give sk with SoL are completely insulting and not worthy of even adding to the class. If you want to implement those spells just leave them out and save your programmers time for other things. Sk have never been a so called debuffing class and I have no idea where verant got an idea that we should. At level 60 sk get the title of GraveLord. We are no such thing. Where is our so called power over the dead. Sk class at high end game are nearly useless and I have personally felt this uselessness.  HT is an absolute joke. At level 59 my HT with disc does 1411 dammage. Fairly nice and if I am on a raid my group can get xp once nearly every hour when I use it. A level 60 rogue gets assassinate which rocks beyond immagination. <BR>Sk's cant directly heal themselves in any mannor at all, we have to siphon off other creatures.  Sk's got a fix to HT that they added using our 54 disc so that is just another way verant screwed sk's again.  I have personally started a rogue as they are in high demand in upper game due to dm output.  Triple attack for monks and rangers is nice addition to those classes. I dont see Triple attack as something rangers should get tho.  Rangers should get better spells since they are a hybred.  SK and Pali either need higher offensive caps and triple attack so we can at least do a fair amount of dammage. If you have played a sk or pali post 50 range you know what I am saying. I dont think sk or pali should do as much dm as a warrior, rogue, or monk.  I do think we should do some dammage tho. I would really like to see verant do something with the SoL spells we get to make us more of GraveLords.  Give sk some more power over undead and such.  Those spells that are debuffs above lvl 50 are just plain not useful at all. They may have taunt value but heck using Shadow Vortex, Shroud of Pain and Shourd Hate and our lvl 9 spell Disease Cloud generate so much taunt no one can taunt stuff off us. Verant had some great ideas with Necros, Pali, Mages, and the other casting classes. The cloak spell is a good idea but please change the duration of the spell to make it semi usefull. I will not be using it in its current form.  Too much mana, too short a duration, not enough increase in stats to make it useful.<BR>Raising 2 hand dm is a good step for us and I totally agree with that move. Maybe we will see some warriors start using their epic in 2h form. I wont hold my breath on that tho since 2 1hs create more taunt.  Well it seems Im on a rant again. Flame me if you must, these are only opinions and what I have learned thru my play.<P>--------------------<P>Nostradomas Blackorchid<BR>Shadow Knight<BR>Solusek Ro

"Briefly, on the subject of casting classes. They are next, and they are a lot easier to balance out amongst each other and against the melee classes. The bulk of caster changes can be done via content, rather than code, and they WILL receive attention."<P>I find it interesting that Verant believes that Melee - which is generally admitted even by them to have been overdone with gear - needs work with code (skills, melee combat tables)... but Casters don't. I'm one of the many who has been pointing out the paucity of good caster gear out there, the lack of items that you'd really want. But really now, how can throwing a few trinkets at casters make up the gap caused by the gear melee has gotten PLUS the gap this greater combat ability causes?<P>Does this make anyone else wonder what they are thinking with?<P>--------------------<P>===================================<P>        Grimstaff Theurgist<P>===================================

So it's not fair to say "I'd rather have a warrior and a cleric than 2 paladins." The more apropos question to ask would be "Would you rather have a warrior and a cleric, or 1 paladin?" Let's not forget that by having a pally, you've just opened up another group spot on your roster. Let's ALSO not forget that in a battle against a caster, I'd take a Paladin any day over a Warrior. Let's ALSO not forget that not every group is a Holy Triad group. Sometimes you have to make due and fight with who you have.<P>No offense, but I think the issue as you've presented it is way, WAY off. Hybrids can and do serve a very important part in group. Suggesting that "a hybrid who is not a specialist in ANY field is only a detriment to a group" is, quite simply, inane and stupid. And it's your type of opinion that is the reason a lot of people <B>trying to have fun</B> are being stymied, and unable to get a group.<P>It seriously angers me that some people seem malicious in trying to ruin the gaming experience of others by having a smarmy "gotta be l33t" attitude. People bandy about hypotetical situations that almost never happen as if they should be regarded as gospel. Sure, if you can get together a warrior, enchanter, wizard, rogue, cleric and shaman in a group, it'd be pretty powerful. But what about snaring? What happens when the rogue overagros and the warrior can't taunt off him in time? What happens when the baddie goes after the enchanter and there's no paladin around to stun it, or no ranger around to snare and get massive agro quickly, no shadowknight to do whatever is necessary to quickly and efficiently get hate back?<P>ANY group can be effective in Everquest. But the attitudes of some people, quite frank, SUCK. It's the 5 or 10% of gripers and the "if you're not a warrior, cleric, enchanter or rogue, we don't want you" type of people that can take a fun game like Everquest and make it a chore.<P>Oh, and  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>you have the mages and necros, the two classes who by far need the biggest boost, both pure casters who are only in their menial position due to flaws in game design...and they receive NOTHING time and time again<HR></BLOCKQUOTE> is just indicitive of the entire mentality of some people. EVERY class has a role to play at EVERY level of the game. Such a negative attitude toward something that should be fun and enjoyable is pretty damn sad.<P>I'll not say something like "If you don't like the game, don't play it" to end off. I personally hate when people say that.  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"> However, I will say this. Don't assume that because you hold some idiotic view that hybrids are useless, and mages and necros suck, and blah blah blah, that any right thinking person agrees with you.

The hybrids did have some exp penalty removed but they didn't receive the offensive and defensive increases accordingly.  There are still penalties associated with being a hybrid.<P>One is the mana casting penalty.  It costs 30% more to cast, that's 30% less per wis/int point.  Also, spells for hybrids are significantly lower in level then the pure casters.  <P>To offset this the pure melee got disciplines, and very nice ones some with short recycle times.  They also have other things such as higher level spells on equipment then the hybrid has.  Take the invig off the legs of some warrior gear.  It does a 100 hp heal.  The hybrid had to wait to level 57 to get a better heal.<P>--------------------<P>Metaphisto, 60 Ranger<BR>Thryll, 57 Necro<BR>Caution, 55 Wizard<BR>Rourke, 56 Cleric<BR>Loga, 55 Bard<BR>Rhose, 52 Warrior<BR>Tiggre, 40 Beastlord<BR>The Defiant<BR>Innoruuk

Okay, while reading this I see a lot of casters bashing melees, and a bunch of melee's who think this melee class got it better, or this melee class is to uber now.  All I can say is this...  GET OVER YOURSELF...  In the true END game, I can't see one class I wouldn't want to have with me.  <P>First in response to the statement that enchanters are useless... sure there are several mobs which are hard or near impossible to just mez off the bat, but you have some one malo the mob the chanter tash's boom you have a mez on almost any Mezable mob.  not to mention C2......  oh gods hit me with it again please<P>Second, mages...  Your pets are tanks in and of themselves, there are several fights where guilds send in the mage pets and just chain heal them with clerics until it gets low enough for the wizards to finish it off!  No tank can take 2k aoe procs with the mob tripeling for 300 pts every attack, but pets can and are cheap to resummon (in comparison to rez'ing a tank and oh gods the xp loss even with a 96% rez).<BR> <BR>Necros get used alot for their mana twitching, That's great and boring sure, but it's a job and clerics will love you for it... Besides you are still one of the best soloing classs in game<P>Wizards are sick and wrong in their own happy way (I love wizards) If you were to get 30 wizards together lvl 60, you could take out almost any dragon or giant  in game(assuming they all had their dragon/giant nuke) and would need only 1 tank to hold initial agro.  not to mention a wizard can do 5k damage in the time it takes a monk to do half that, (sure he would be oom but the monk would be dead having run his cleric and group oom)<P>Rogues have possibly the highest damage output in game when grouped with a good tank, their new tripple attack will make fights go so much smoother, <P>Monks, sure they can outdamage anyone in toe to toe combat, but they have some of the lowest base resists in game, and when compared to a plate class next to no hitpoints.  let them deal their damage I don't want to have to tank this thing for long....<P>Druids are used for their utilitarian purposes, there is no other class in game that can do all the things a druid can, although there are some of them that can do a few of them better (but you don't have room for all of them in one group)<P>Bards are mana batteries sure, and I have seen a lvl 60 bard who could turn the tides of epic battles with his songs (gj pava!)<P>Clerics are a given can't live without them if your a tank, no one is nearly as mana efficient with heals.<P>Shamans have the ungodly slow, some nice damage PETS! at mid levels and have you heard about the shaman who solo'd a dragon in WW?  well I would gladly take someone who can SOLO a dragon on a dragon raid.<P>Warriors are the primary tank, the shield that stops the fecil material from hitting the oscillating air circulation device... we depend on our gear and we have the scars to prove our worth<P>Paladins are great tanks when the warrior falls, and the LoH while only usable once is great for avoiding TWO's<P>Shadowknights have a decent damage output and can tank decently, their HT while usable only once in a fight can occasionaly help<P>Rangers with the post 50 addition of jolt, and cinder jolt have become great damage dealers in any group, along with being able to preform several utilitarian jobs such as snaring, and sowing.<P>As you can see everyone has their purpose but shadow knights and pally's have possibly the least use in epic encounters.  with the upgrade they may actually be able to be more usefull, Monks and rogues will help end fights faster, Rangers able to last longer and get in those few extra swings which could end the fight, Warriors will be able to consider some new weapons that might improve their usefullness, and as for all the casters?  most melee classes have trouble soloing a green in many places let alone somthing for xp, that is somthing that many casters forget (I know I did at one point) So to conclude, this patch if it goes live will allow for everyone to preform better, kill more, get more loot, and die less!  that's GREAT NEWS!  if you have any doubts, go play on test and ask a few of the higer levels what they think after seeing the changes in effect.<P>The (-~S_C_H_I_Z_O~-) list<P>Novenlestmeiche - Ayonae ro - 55 Wood elf druid<BR>Andeberon - Cazic-Thule - 38 Wood Elf Druid<BR>Reezon - Ayonae Ro - 49 Halfling Rogue<BR>Daft - Ayonae Ro - 44 Human Monk<BR>Gourgone - Cazic-Thule - 45 Troll Warrior<BR>Aristautle - Ayonae Ro - 58 High Elf Cleric

&lt;I&gt;Don't people realize that Everquest SHOULD require some finesse? What fun would it be if you pressed the 'a' button and everything took care of itself?&lt;/i&gt;<P>AMEN RADUUS. If your class is boring, it's either YOUR fault (because you're not pushing the limits of what you can do) or the game's fault (because it doesn't allow you enough room to push the limits).<P>In the melee cases, a lot of times, if your character is simply "push a and then kick every now and then", then you're missing a lot of the game. I've played a melee in the end game. There are ways to make your character more interesting.<P>&lt;I&gt;: don't complain on how fun it is for u without thinking about the other classes <BR>haye, skil and coordination : first, melees, oh, that is much more interesting to have to hit the auto-attack key , then after that , only having to chain hit taunt and kick/bash/otherability button, you really think it is funnier than ur work&lt;/I&gt;<P>CORRECT Punctuation. Capitilization. Sentences. If English is your first language, you should not express your thoughts until they're in a manner people can understand easily. If English is your second language, I sympathize with you - it's a difficult one to learn. Don't post to English based message boards until you can better understand and communicate with it, please...you risk making a mockery of yourself.<P>If you're just typing like that because you're lazy, show more respect for other posters. In a medium such as the board, based on text, it's generally accepted that you should make sure you're understood by other posters. You don't appear to be doing that.<P>Now, on to what I considered your main points (although I wouldn't rule out the possibility that I'm completely misunderstanding you):<P>&lt;i&gt;they can't even read a book like u do&lt;/i&gt;<P>Yes, that's my point. *Their* attention is occupied. For me, I just set my tells to bright pink or blue or something, sit back, and glance up at the screen every now and then to make sure I'm not missing any buff requests. The game should be a challenge. Challenges are fun. When I can read and play at the same time, it's not a challenge.<P>&lt;i&gt;you who say more important is fun, why u play EQ , if u don't have fun ??&lt;/i&gt;<P>Because a)I like my guildmates, and b)I feel I owe them, for what they've done for me. Beyond that, I still have fun playing the game...just not as my enchanter.<P>&lt;i&gt;first, melees, oh, that is much more interesting to have to hit the auto-attack key , then after that , only having to chain hit taunt and kick/bash/otherability button, you really think it is funnier than ur work&lt;/i&gt;<P>Yes, I really think it is more fun than my work. Which would you rather be: the person who is there ONLY to make it so that other people can kill monsters, or the person who's there KILLING the monsters. As to whether autoattack/kick/taunt/bash/etc. is really all there is to being a melee...That's kind of sad, if you think that's it. Maybe the changes will take you out of your little safety niche where you willingly hit 3 buttons all night. Hopefully enchanters will get a change soon that keeps me from being forced to hit 3 buttons all night.<P>&lt;i&gt;The new enchanter spells also compliment these improved melee abilities rather well, with taunt procs and such.&lt;/i&gt;<P>Oh boy. Once again, my sole job will be to watch other people kill stuff. Only I'll be EVEN BETTER at watching other people kill stuff! Excuse me if I don't just go shoot myself, out of sheer joy.<P>Don't get me wrong. These changes are needed, and they rebalance the way melee is at 60.<P>Some things are even more broken than the dual wield/2hslashing disparity, though. For instance, the fact that on a given raid I spend more time reading and AFK than I do at the keyboard. I don't pay 9.99 monthly for the privelege to read books in front of my computer.<P>--------------------<P>Branar Shmanar<BR>60 Enchanter<BR>The Seventh Hammer

It's a game.  It's supposed to be played for fun.  And yes, I'd have a better time grouping with two fun pallies than I did with the group of children that dropped their SK to add my Rogue last week.<P><I>look, the game as it is now only has room for people who are the BEST at something. there is no room for a paladin with weak damage output, and weak healing abilities, or an sk with weak melee, and weak offensive spells. it's just unrealistic.</I><P>Why do you play?  Are you getting paid for group damage output per unit of time?  If so, share that info with the board, I'm sure there are folks who would like to know about it.<P>If you're saying that you're just really driven by getting exp and taking down the maximum amount of mobs in a session, then fine.  Just say that.  Let people know that you, personally, have no use for hybrids.  Nothing wrong with admitting to that.  Just don't try to tell everyone else, many of whom do not share your view of the game, that there is "no room" for hybrids.<P>Personally, I can't imagine anything more boring than playing a warrior or a cleric.  But that's my bias, your views may be different.  See how that works?<P><BR><I>but if you honestly believe that any normal xp group would be better off with 2 sks rather than 1 warrior, and 1 necromancer... youre insane. pure classes are made to complement each other and work together. a hybrid who is not a specialist in ANY field is only a detriment to a group.</I><P>Horse****.  Why are you making these gross generalizations about classes?   SKs can hold aggro BETTER than a warrior 3-4 levels higher.  One of the very best exp groups I've ever had was in Seb with an SK that I thought was far too low for the camp.  Yes, he took more heals than a Warrior would have, but the casters rarely got aggroed and so didn't need healing at all.  Ask your cleric which is the easier healing scenario - a single tank who takes a CH or three casters all needing Sup Heal at the same time?  And give me a well-played SK over 90% of the necros out there anytime.  You want to see a group get blown up?  Put a necro deep in a dungeon and watch as he draws aggro on overdots, allows his pet to break mezzes, etc.  Yes, a well-played necro can add a ton of damage.  A badly-played necro is a death waiting to happen.  A bad SK is just a weak tank.  Easy decision.<P><I>in addition, my REAL gripe is how verant is bending over backwards to make the poor hybrids feel useful, when they are the way they are by class design.</I><P>And who designed those classes?  That's right, the same people who are making the changes.<P><I>in contrast, you have the mages and necros, the two classes who by far need the biggest boost, both pure casters who are only in their menial position due to flaws in game design...and they receive NOTHING time and time again.</I><P>Wow, so you feel poor game design justifies a "boost" to these classes, while poor game design is just tough **** for Hybrids?  Nice double standard.  Anyway, well-played mages and necros need nothing more in the way of damage output.  Agree that mages need some useful utility spells.  Since they're a good soloing class, I'd say give 'em teleports so they could get to good hunting spots quickly.  Might drive down the cost of rides for the rest of us, too  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>Lumine

** Melee Changes **<BR>We're wrapping up an extensive look at why there are so few hybrids at the top end game, and why those few that are there are dedicated to doing the suicidal pulls and suicidal LoHs as their only real contribution. We've implemented some changes which now appear on Test. Please try these changes out and let us know if hybrids still suck.<P>* Melee Tables *<P>Melee combat is based, at least we think, in part, on tables that determine how much each class functions. Up until we released kunark, we had a clue, so we had all melee and hybrids on the same table, with the exception of monks who we wanted to do more damage so they were on a seperate table (one that had them doing more damage). However, when we released kunark, we had no clue how to raise the level cap and effectivly raise damage output on the melee type classes so we moved all pure melee types onto the monk table, didn't modify the monks, and left the hybrids on the old table.<P>The problem here is that we are stupid and dont fully understand our own skill based system. We didn't realize that with lower skill caps, combined with a lower damage dealing table, would result in very poor ability for the hybrids to deal damage.<P>Therefore, we have hired a talented group of teenage high school students who understand basic math. They have informed us that if hybrids are also moved onto the same table that their lack of weapon and offensive skills will still be lower than the other melee classes, but they will be able to deal enough damage to pull their own weight.<P>Monks, however, once again due to our own inability to understand our skill system, are doing roughly the same damage as warriors, this was not our "Vision"(tm). So we will be raising monks ability to deal damage so that they will do slighly more damage than a warrior, just like in the good old days pre-kunark when the classes were actually some what balanced.<P>* Two-Handed Weapons *<P>The effectiveness of these weapons falls slightly below our desire for them, again due to our inability to comprehend our own skill based system. This tends to make SK/Pal suck when it comes to damage output. We'd also like to see warriors actually using some of the two-handers that we have put into the game.<P>Therefore, we will be increasing the minimum damage of these weapons for all classes once they reach 50th level. There will be an increase in the minimum damage of two-handed weapons based on the weilders level and the delay of the weapon, like it should be, but early on we hated SK/Pal and decided not to give them a nice heafy minimum damage bonus like we did with the dual wielding classes. Obviously we aren't going to give out exact numbers, because we still don't fully understand how this skill based system will actually work, but it should result in a sold increase in damage output while using two-handed weapons.<P>We also believe that there has been a bit of disparity between the very high-end one-handed weapons and their counterpart two-handed weapons. The high end one-handed weapons actually out damage the even higher end two-handers, not only that, but they allow the SK/Pal to also use a shield for even better stat gains. A high end one-hander with an high end shield simply blows away any stat gain (and damage output) of the most uber two-handers in the game (primals and ToV weapons). We will, on a case by case basis, be improving many of the high-end two-handed weapons. Because this is essentially a fix for our stupidity, we will be making these changes retroactive (meaning you won't have to trade the items in or hunt for new ones, we will simply do the right thing and existing weapons will just change since this was our mistake).<P>* Rangers *<P>We've also noticed, while intended to hit harder in combat than other melee/hybrid classes, are getting their asses kicked harder than we planned. Again, this only happens in the 50+ range, not due to our misunderstanding of our own skill system, but because its so easy to get good quality armor and weapons pre-50 compared to the equipment that was available pre-kunark. So we will be increasing the defense cap for rangers again, slightly, to 210 at 60th level. Exactally how these points will be distributed is uncertain, since we don't understand our skill system, but will probably just be 1 point per level after 50, because even our programers can do simple math. We will also be giving rangers triple attack to help them build even more agro to negate all the positive changes we are making.<P>* Monks *<P>Monks will be getting tripple attack. This along with the improvement of their combat tables should place them about where we want them, combat-wise, assuming that we understand how these changes to our skill system work.<P>* Bards *<P>Bards are indeed intended to have the least ability to deal damage physically of all the calsses we're discussing. However, with their lack of double attack coupled with our total lack of understanding of our skill system, they don't meeet even our intentions for their damage output. We will, therefore, be raising the offense and one-handed weapon caps for bards over 50th level to match that of a warriors. Once again we don't fully understand how our skill system works, but this change should, we think, allow them to do more melee damage, without making them more effective than the knights at any given level.<P>Obviously we want to see how this all pans out when applied to the game, because we lack the ability to figure it out ourself. Feel free to send your comments on the results you see to us through the Developer's Corner on our web site. Again we are relying on you to help us here because we still have no clue.<P>It is very important that you understand that these are changes we are testing. And when we say testing, we really are testing. We change a number here and there and then pray that it actually has the desired effect. These changes (and any others made on the Test Server) may not be moved to the Live Servers because we are not sure we have the ability to copy code from one server to another. After all, thats the reason we're a test server, so we can try out new things and see if we can change something and it actually have the desired effect.

Well, if they were going to boost melees, I'm a little encouraged that they did not boost warriors and rogues.  Those two classes currently dominate most high end encounters, and don't really need any more juice (sorry, high level warriors and rogues... I don't know anyone can deny the supremacy of the warrior/rogue/cleric triangle in raid encounters.)<P>But melee in general dominates high end encounters compared to casting anyway.  <P>Is it reasonable to assume that casters are going to get a major boost in power as well? I know that Wizards can do pretty good damage in encounters that allow Banes, IF they have those spells, but other than that, casters are basically shafted in the high end game.

my thoughts...<P>--bards:  good<BR>--hybrids:  good, 2h was broke, and you needed the damage table, but that's as far as it needs to go.<BR>--warriors:  they need to fix that taunt button.  perhaps VI want's to ditch the MT strategy on big mobs.<BR>--rangers:  needed the defense increase.  don't deserve the triple attack, you are a half-breed after all.  also, you were doing more damage and gaining more agro than you could handle before.  jolt won't save ya on those big resistant mobs.<BR>--monks:  the triple attack is justified as you are a pure melee.  but, along with 2 damage table increases?  be glad they fixed your FD, yer gonna need it.<BR>--rogues:  as long as monks/rangers don't start outdamaging us, it's ok.  if they do, you will have a hard time explaining why a pure melee class did not receive triple atk while a half-breed did.  VI needs to stop nerfing our high end weapons now.<BR>--priests:  you guys are support roles, therefore unaffected.  clerics, rangers are now mana sinks.  druids, even though you are part offense, ya really can't complain because you are a master of no trade.<BR>--chanters:  unaffected.<BR>--offensive int casters (mage, wiz, necro):  accept your role as a support class or quit your char.  after a year of VI contantly slapping you guys around (i agree, its unfair and sux, however..), you should have learned by now.<P>outside of class balancing...<BR>this just made the end game MUCH closer MUCH faster than it would have normally taken for a lot of guilds.  NTOV will soon be crowded, and guilds will look around for something else to do.  Keep in mind SoL is not planned to have much high-end content.<P>This may be attractive short term for many players.  It might keep potential EQ-&gt;DAOC refugees minimized for a while.  But did VI just shoot themselves in the foot long term?  They need to make some more high-end content soon or lose player base.<P>2cp<BR>Lifty Swiftpocket<BR>Valoran Assassin of Karana<P>--------------------<P>Lifty Swiftpocket (Rake)<BR>Rondeveron Stormsmith (Channeler)<BR>of Karana

To Noonie ...<P>Fair enough.  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>I definately won't deny that there are flaws with Everquest. I generally look past those flaws both because I enjoy the game so much, and because there's not much I can do about it.  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"> I've sent some suggestions to the dev board (mostly begging them to expand the text you can place in a social button, as well as making the lines wrap!!!), but I really don't expect to see anything done about it.  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>But I think one thing people forget when taking into account "class balance" is the intangibles. I imagine many rogues, considered uber and needed by most anyone, envy the ability of a mage to solo within minutes of logging on. I wouldn't be surprised if Warriors sometimes turn green with envy when they see a Shadowknight out taunt them, layer dot's on a baddie, and finish said mob off with a life tap.<P>Basically every class has its strong and weak points. And it's SO EASY to overlook what you do have when looking at what you don't, or comparing yourself to another class.<P>That's not to say high level encounters shouldn't be fixed. I'm a strong believer that diversity in those high encounters can only be a good thing. (how about having a wizard spell that allows a specific mage spell to always land on a mob? 1 wizard casts, and 3 mages nuke)<P>However, I also STRONGLY believe that no class is useless. Far from it. I personally take great enjoyment in figuring HOW to effectively mesh classes together. Everquest, despite the flaws it has, is just an incredibly complex and fascinating game. And yes there are a few problems with it. But hopefully Verant has proven that they are willing to listen to the customer and make changes that make the game better, and more enjoyable.  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">

I think that these changes going in are great.  I for one do not think this will unbalance the usefullness of casters in a group(I only play PvE so cannot make a statement for PvP).  Not to say that he was right in doing this but I have seen my roommate, a lvl 55 druid,  KS a whole group of peeps in KC.  Now,  I doubt that you will ever see a melee type KS a 6 man group in a high level dungeon.  Now as for being a high lvl SK,  I notice that 2hd weapontry vs 1hd weapontry is very unbalance.  When fighting high blues to reds I notice my miss rate is so high factored in with the minimum damage occuring way too much with my 2hd blunt(Deathbringers Rod 30/40) that I often end up switching to my 1hd blunt(MOSS 19/19) so that I can do at least a little damage  <IMG SRC="confused.gif" border="0"> .  Hopefully this change will put to rest this difficulty with 2hders.  I would like to think that I would be in "damage dealing mode" when using my DB Rod and in "tanking" mode when using my Moss and a shield.  Even if these changes dont go live,  I will still love playing my Ogre SK (/emote drools all over himself while hungrily staring at {insert dwarfs name here}!).<P>--------------------<P>Reyortsed Fosyssuw<BR>50 Shadow Knight<BR>"The only definite product of life is death"

This is another real let down for the warrior class is many ways. I felt like the warrior role in EQ was very much set when i first started playing - At the cost of having no magical abilities whatsoever we had a special place in the field of melee. Warriors are supposed to be THE best tanks in the game =&gt; Highest hit points, highest AC and the best combination of offensive and defensive melee skills in the game. With the constant upgrades to the Hybrid classes ( And dont get me wrong, some of them were much needed) the warriors place is becoming unfocused. Why add a warrior to the group when you could add a ranger that can buff/sow/ and with spells that add weapon procs ( and this was supposed to even out the damage ouput ) given TRIPLE attack outdamage a warrior. With velious theres ranger armor thats gives them allmost as high an ac as a warrior now. The same goes for SKs and palladins , they have more to offer and the gap between their combat skills and the warriors keeps getting smaller all the time. I feel like the warrior class is really being phased out.<P>--------------------<P>Denolen Halfelven 43rd season War<BR>Duellan Fyrefist 41st season Rang

All I can say about the new Melee changes as it applies to Rangers are....It is about time.  Yes..Rangers are Melee types and should be hit, but they are currently being hit WAY too hard.  And due to the fact that they do deal out a good quantity of damage (I am usually hitting for four hits with Duel/Double Hit capability before any other melee types in my group get a single hit off) we build of a tremendous anount of aggro.  Add snare to that and sometimes a mob wil never aggro on anybody else during the battle.  Without Jolt, a Ranger would be dying in every high-level mob battle. And how in all the nine hells can Rogues have a better defense capability than a Ranger.  That makes no sense at all.  With the additions of Triple Attack and a better Defense capability, this once again makes the Ranger a viable additon to any high-level group.<P>Sandalorn Ellesarien

<BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Lumine-Jaz:<BR><STRONG>Originally posted by Noonie:<BR><I>hybrids, people should only play for fun. because they could be replaced by either of their parent classes and have it be better for the group. you cant honestly believe that having 2 paladins is better for a group than having a warrior and a cleric?</I><P>Bro?  It's a game.  It's supposed to be played for fun.  And yes, I'd have a better time grouping with two fun pallies than I did with the group of children that dropped their SK to add my Rogue last week.<P><I>look, the game as it is now only has room for people who are the BEST at something. there is no room for a paladin with weak damage output, and weak healing abilities, or an sk with weak melee, and weak offensive spells. it's just unrealistic.</I><P>Why do you play?  Are you getting paid for group damage output per unit of time?  If so, share that info with the board, I'm sure there are folks who would like to know about it.<P>If you're saying that you're just really driven by getting exp and taking down the maximum amount of mobs in a session, then fine.  Just say that.  Let people know that you, personally, have no use for hybrids.  Nothing wrong with admitting to that.  Just don't try to tell everyone else, many of whom do not share your view of the game, that there is "no room" for hybrids.<P>Personally, I can't imagine anything more boring than playing a warrior or a cleric.  But that's my bias, your views may be different.  See how that works?<P><BR><I>but if you honestly believe that any normal xp group would be better off with 2 sks rather than 1 warrior, and 1 necromancer... youre insane. pure classes are made to complement each other and work together. a hybrid who is not a specialist in ANY field is only a detriment to a group.</I><P>Horse****.  Why are you making these gross generalizations about classes?   SKs can hold aggro BETTER than a warrior 3-4 levels higher.  One of the very best exp groups I've ever had was in Seb with an SK that I thought was far too low for the camp.  Yes, he took more heals than a Warrior would have, but the casters rarely got aggroed and so didn't need healing at all.  Ask your cleric which is the easier healing scenario - a single tank who takes a CH or three casters all needing Sup Heal at the same time?  And give me a well-played SK over 90% of the necros out there anytime.  You want to see a group get blown up?  Put a necro deep in a dungeon and watch as he draws aggro on overdots, allows his pet to break mezzes, etc.  Yes, a well-played necro can add a ton of damage.  A badly-played necro is a death waiting to happen.  A bad SK is just a weak tank.  Easy decision.<P><I>in addition, my REAL gripe is how verant is bending over backwards to make the poor hybrids feel useful, when they are the way they are by class design.</I><P>And who designed those classes?  That's right, the same people who are making the changes.<P><I>in contrast, you have the mages and necros, the two classes who by far need the biggest boost, both pure casters who are only in their menial position due to flaws in game design...and they receive NOTHING time and time again.</I><P>Wow, so you feel poor game design justifies a "boost" to these classes, while poor game design is just tough **** for Hybrids?  Nice double standard.  Anyway, well-played mages and necros need nothing more in the way of damage output.  Agree that mages need some useful utility spells.  Since they're a good soloing class, I'd say give 'em teleports so they could get to good hunting spots quickly.  Might drive down the cost of rides for the rest of us, too   <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>Lumine</STRONG><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>k your post agrivates me. first id like to point out that i am a mage, hardly an essential class. also i would like to point out, i am clearly speaking from the GAMES point of view, and the rules theyve laid out for us, not my own. i dont agree with the games exclusiveness and bad planning. in addition i would like to say i welcome any hybrid to a group i was in, of course i would. i would have to be some sort of psycho not to. but you *cant* tell me that me that they only get invited when a warrior cant be found. <BR>actually you dont have to tell me, as you already did with your example, about the sk who you picked up when a "real tank" couldnt be found... thus making you a bold faced hypocrite.<P>anyway the point is i am agrivated, because i am stating a truthful, un-pc fact. something EVERYONE including yourself knows... that a hybrid isnt as effective as either parent class. and i get ATTACKED and made to look like some sort of wacky power gamer.<BR>sure, whatever.<P>--------------------<P>Noonie
