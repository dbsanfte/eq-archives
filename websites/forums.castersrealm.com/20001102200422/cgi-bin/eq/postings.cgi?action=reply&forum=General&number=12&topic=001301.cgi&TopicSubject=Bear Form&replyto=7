Shamans are supposedly like 'spiritual' casters. We deal with spells such as Spirit of Snake, Spirit of Bear, Spirit of cat, and the famous Spirit of Wolf. You'd think if we're so in touch with these animalistic line of spells, we'd qualify for a 'form' line of spells such as the druid who can change into wolves. It couldnt be so hard for verant to implement this type of thing, with the numerous bear models throughout the game. Just an idea,<P>Freoborn Wulf, 18th Year Shaman of Quellious.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#F7F7F7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Invay</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">There is a pretty good thread about this on the Everlore shaman board.  Also, the idea was proposed to Brad in a chat once, he thought is was cool.  <P>But then again, just because he thought it was cool in no way means that it will happen.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#DEDFDF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Warwulfe</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I would SO love to have a Bear Form. <P>I think Verant's twisted reason for not giving it to us is this:<P>If they give us Bear Form, class jealousy WILL result.  They believe, and probably rightly so, that the biggest reason why the Druid populations are so huge is because of Wolf Form.  I mean, let's face it, Druids are an amazingly attractive class to play, and then they go throw Wolf Form on top of it.  You look unique, you run fast, you have ultravision, and you have increased attack rating.  No other class gets that.<P>For awhile, a Druid could go into just about any dungeon or town unmolested.  Notice how they fixed that?  The reason is, DRUID-MANIA had reached an all-time high and really showed no signs of declining.  Melee class after melee class, tired of running through 6 zones at a snail's pace got tired of the same old grind and started Druids for a much-welcome breath of fresh air.<P>Now, let's look at Shaman.  For a long time, there were barely ANY SHAMAN AT ALL!  Shortly after the Totemic quests were implemented, more and more Shaman start popping up everywhere.  Totemic looks cool.  Shortly after this, Shaman could use spears.  Spears look cool on Shaman.  A spear-wielding casting class is UNIQUE. All this, combined with the word getting out that Shaman "rock" at higher levels, caused an explosion in Shaman populations across most servers.  <P>I believe Verant thinks that if they give us Bear Form, it's going to further destablize class population proportions.  Of course, I say screw it, give us Bear Form!  Now that I am level 45 I really can see that there's not much unique about a Shaman.  We do look pretty cool with our big bad 2h blunts, spears, and plate armor, but as a nature-based priest class we ought to be able to change our form at will.<P>Ah well, enough ranting...  it's off my chest.

Supposedly they do not have bears mapped for every zone. Whereas wolves ARE mapped for every zone.

"We would love to give necromancers spectre pets, but the model isn't in every zone" Basically, if you ***** and moan long enough, you'll be able to get the to fix that  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#F7F7F7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Freoborn</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Wolf form with its haste, sow and ultravision is sweet alright, but hell, bear form with maybe Strength and stamina inserted, plus maybe even haste to represent a double claw attack would just rock.

Just look at the native american cultures they had more shamanistic(word??) principles and were more associated with animals. The South American shamans had tales of them shape-shifting.<P>Piece of info, Druids are Celtic myth no where else have I seen it. When I was oh 10-12 i was addicted to myth (I think it was a stress reliever). And they delt more with nature (curing with herbs and stuff) and politics.<P>So I say if they can add spectre, plus they say enchanters can't have it cause too many polygons on it and they don't want too many running around, I say BS. I mean at high levels what do you see more enchanters or necros?? So, I think they can add 1 bear, the black or brown I don't care. It would add STR and STA and give Ultravision.

Druids in D&D had the ability to shape shift, and could turn into a wolf once per day.  That is where they got the idea from.  It wasn't something they pulled out of their butt.<P>But, in some lore of D&D, barbarian shamen could turn other people into animals.  It was  not pretty and it most certainly wasn't painless... but they could do it.<P>EQ was based largely off of D&D.  And now they'll shun any ideas that are similar to the game.  I'm glad it's not a carbon copy of D&D (God knows I hate their magic system), but I think some good ideas still exist there.<P>------------------<BR>Numbuk<BR>Ogre Mojo Majik Ting<BR>Morell-Thule</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></td></tr></table>
