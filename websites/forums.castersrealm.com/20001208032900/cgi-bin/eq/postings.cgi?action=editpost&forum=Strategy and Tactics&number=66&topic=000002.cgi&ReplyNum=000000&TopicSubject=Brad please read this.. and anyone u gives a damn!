<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL"> I posted the following in reply to McQuaid's explanation of why he keeps nerfing unto death. It's aside from specific complaints about the wizard class. The most annoying thing about his long post was that it was saying in effect, "I'm sorry, kids...but I only do what's best for you, even if you don't understand why." I'm buying Asheron's call tonight to give it a try and see if it's good enough to replace EQ on my hard drive. 

Dear Mr. McQuaid: 

First of all, I want to compliment you on a highly complex, addictively fun game. Besides my own personal enjoyment, it has provided a conversation topic with my 15 year-old daughter (who has long since out-leveled me), which is hard to come by. I want to reply, though, and tell you what my perception is of the controversy surrounding the continual changes to Everquest. 
It is most likely NOT the individual nerfs that are so troublesome so the players of your game. We all understand the need for balance. However, the basic paradigm seems to be that you expect your game to be played a certain way. Mr. McQuaid, you have created a complex, rich environment which has subsequently been populated by thousands of individual free wills. The more that the game is changed to restrict our play, the more it chafes. If you begin with the premise that the game must be controlled to a relatively high degree, and that new changes you instill must have unpredicted side effects rubbed out, then you must and will continually nerf the game. And you will continue to experience a degree of enmity from those of us who would rather you left well enough alone. Taken to one extreme is an unbalanced game that is taken advantage of by a few. The other is a dull, predictable, scripted game which only allows movement within the confines of the script. A beautiful, vast, dull, boring world, and stripped of a sense of discovery and accomplishment. A world where we are expected to succeed, but punished if we find a better way to perform a task. 
In the real world, many people worship a God that they consider to be the epitome of fairness and justice. One of the chief factors when people turn away from religion is when they perceive, justly or not, that their god has become capricious and doesn’t really care about them. Everquest is a world, and you and the rest of Verant are functionally the deities thereof. You control Norrath, and many of us find your governance of your creation to be capricious and overly rigid. 
As an allegory, perhaps you should read (or re-read) Mary Shelley’s cautionary tale of creations imbued with free will - Frankenstein. Dr. Frankenstein (Mr. McQuaid) is a bright, talented man who has a vision of perfection (online RPG). He labors to exhaustion (beta), and finally brings it to life (goes gold). His creation is ultimately not controllable, and his attempts to do so bring ultimate disaster. 
Have some faith in your creation, sir. The environment is rich, complex, and big enough to accommodate all kinds of play. You simply cannot anticipate and control everthing that will happen in an environment with as many degrees of freedom as Everquest has without incurring resentment. You’ve designed the instrument; please see that a large portion of EQ’s success and our enjoyment of it is that we are allowed to play the instrument and compose our own tunes. And it’s annoying as hell when someone keeps taking the instrument out of our hands just when we’re getting good at it, changing the tuning of the strings and the placement of the frets, and handing it back to us, saying, “There. It’s better now, you’ll see. I know it’s going to take a while to get used to the new arrangement, but I really didn’t like those high notes you were playing. This will make much more soothing music, the kind of music I enjoy”. 
I understand why you feel you must do what you do. But there are degrees, sir, and you do too much for my taste. And I am decidedly not alone.
