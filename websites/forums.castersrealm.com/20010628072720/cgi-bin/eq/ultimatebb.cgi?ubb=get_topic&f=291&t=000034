Hey. Just to let you know, I'm starting another series.

I like this new adventure.  It almost seems more focused than your first story (though I really like the first story).  Things seem more...more...explained, I think.  Am I making sense?  <P>Oh well, at any rate I like it and am interested in the next installment! =)

This is the end installment of chapter 1.<BR>Enjoy.<BR>Night Descending, Chapter 1: Conflagration<P>Firiona Vie burned. Fires were everywhere, as Iksar warriors wrecked buildings and murdered civilians.<BR>Of course, the soldiers of Firiona Vie weren&#8217;t exactly taking this lying down, and pitched battle had degenerated into a seek-and-destroy game of hide-and-seek. Iksar and Firiona forces had occupied various buildings, and these had become small fortresses. Others moved through the sewers or ruined streets, hiding and killing at once. Even the forests, normally filled with only deadly beasts, were full of soldiers. Ruins had been occupied there as well.<P>The hunting gave Yakov Shadeleaf an edge. Trained in tracking, he hunted in the burning streets silently and with great effect. His chain mail burned redly in the ruddy gloom. He slipped quietly behind another iksar warrior, pulled him down, and gave him a rather pointed display of swordsmanship. Of course, the warrior couldn&#8217;t learn if he was dead, so it was rather unfortunate his teaching skills were being wasted. <P>He stood up and wiped his blade. Damn.....too much time wasted. This wasn&#8217;t good. He had to hurry to the Temple, see if Xedri was still alive. He began to walk, then run. Hurry....<P>He looked up, and saw the ramp to the Temple. He also saw the four or so iksar warriors guarding the bridge, but he heard the sounds of fighting. No time for finesse. Time to get spectacular.<P>He rushed right up the bridge, decapitating a single warrior before he even knew what hit him. The rest turned, snarling in their hideous language, and charged.<P>He blocked an overhead cleave, twisted out of the way and struck back, staining the floor red. The iksar lurched, snarled, and died, it&#8217;s blood spattering the ranger&#8217;s armor. He tripped, his legs tangled in the tail of his victim. An iksar struck with his sheerblade and Yakov felt it like an icicle had been driven into his chest. He kicked back instinctively, whirling his legs around to cause confusion and regain his balance.<P>The swordsman had little time to gloat over his strike. Yakov drove both his blades into the scaly chest, holding on grimly until the thing stopped twitching. He then nearly lost his head to the last warrior&#8217;s stroke, but twisted his head out of the way.<P>Then the warrior tried his last ace, raising his blade and chanting in Dark Speech. A bolt of poison struck the ranger, and he felt doubly nauseous from the mental blow and the sickness. But it wasn&#8217;t enough. Rising to his feet, Yakov cried &#8220;Arc Chain!&#8221; and a bolt of lightning fixed itself to the iksar&#8217;s head. It howled and tried to get it off, but the lightning kept to it, striking constantly until the iksar&#8217;s body was a charred husk.<P>Was he in time? Was Xedri and her troop still alive? Yakov&#8217;s own men had been scattered, and quite a few of them were dead, if not captured for sacrifice. He had a second&#8217;s vision of her being dragged off screaming to be butchered to the god of Fear, Cazic-Thule. He panicked, and moving into the Temple at a dead run he looked upon the scene taking place inside.<P>&#8220;You traitor...&#8221; Xedri stood, masked in the Wood Elf illusion she had been given to wear until she could inform the outpost commander about who and what she was. Her soldiers had massed behind her, and an opposing group stood as well. But the beings facing her with weapons drawn were not exclusively Iksar. A good amount of Wood Elves and Half Elves stood with the Iksar, and their commander, a High Elf whom Yakov recognized as decorated commander Telak Parlon, had his sword out and at the ready.<P>&#8220;Don&#8217;t give me that, girl.&#8221; Telak smiled. &#8220;What matters is that I&#8217;m on the winning side. Innoruuk and his minions ARE the winning side.&#8221; He laughed and dashed forward, and ripped something invisible off Xedri&#8217;s head. She dropped screaming, with the disorienting alternation between characteristics Yakov identified with transformation. &#8220;It appears I&#8217;m not the only traitor.&#8221; he said, his eyes widening in recognition.<P>The troops Xedri commanded gasped as their leader was revealed for what she truly was. They saw the Dark Elven body and began to attack. &#8220;Stop!&#8221; Yakov shouted, his voice carrying across the Temple courtyard. &#8220;Are you mad? She&#8217;s your commander! She&#8217;s a friend!&#8221;<P>Telak&#8217;s eyes narrowed. &#8220;Shadeleaf. Haven&#8217;t you, your cousin, and HER been sleeping off the past 12 years? What are you doing here?&#8221;<P>&#8220;None of your business. Drop the sword and you won&#8217;t be killed. Now what&#8216;s this about Innoruuk? Aren&#8216;t Iksar the worshippers of Cazic-Thule?&#8221; Yakov accepted  Cazic-Thule only a little more, for he was part of the pact against Veeshan and therefore had a right to the world. Innoruuk didn&#8217;t.<P>&#8220;Not for now, Shadeleaf. They&#8216;ve seen the truth that Hate is all-powerful.&#8221; A dark elven knight stepped out from the crowd. His black armor shimmered. &#8220;I am Fer&#8217;ath. Give us the traitor Nightshade and we&#8217;ll withdraw.&#8221;<P>Yakov grasped his sword. &#8220;Never. Withdraw, Fer&#8216;ath, and you won&#8216;t die just yet.&#8221; He knew perfectly well Fer&#8217;ath had no intention of accepting, but the trading of warnings was one of those customary precursors to a fight. Xedri got up, with her form still flickering slightly between Dark and Wood elf. The other troops fanned out, to take the other group.<P>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take Fer&#8217;ath. I know how my people fight.&#8221; she whispered.<P>&#8220;Are you sure? You&#8217;re not entirely good with our techniques, and Tunare might be unhappy if you use shadowknight magic.&#8221;<P>&#8220;She&#8217;ll forgive me.&#8221; she replied. &#8220;I hope.&#8221; Then Xedri leapt into action. Drawing her ruby-bladed sword, she ran at Fer&#8217;ath with the speed of a viper. Swinging directly at his head, Xedri hoped to end it right there. Unfortunately, it was not to be. Fer&#8217;ath parried her attack with ease and bashed her in a very sensitive spot. She shrieked with rage and yelled &#8220;Blood Roots!&#8221; Blood red roots blasted up from the ground and crushed the knight, who grunted as his rib was broken. But he was just as talented. <P>&#8220;Dark Force!&#8221; Black fiery spheres of energy swarmed the female warrior, and her scream,  high and terrible, echoed from the center. Then she brushed them aside, her armor torn and rent, her breathing hard. <P>&#8220;So you want to play, huh?&#8221; Her lips curved into a smile. &#8220;Good.&#8221; She leapt high in the air and dealt a devastating blow to Fer&#8217;ath, then, still in the air, she kicked down hard at his groin, knocking her foe into a crouch as she exacted retribution for the inappropriate blow he&#8217;d thrown. Yar&#8217;at...she thought. What should I do? She thought it rather ironic that the soul of her friend knew her capabilities better then herself, but it couldn&#8217;t be helped.<P>(Ok. Fer&#8217;ath....Fer&#8217;ath...I remember him from class . As I recall, he&#8217;s focused on external damage. He&#8217;s not going to expect attacks that damage him internally, spiritually, or psychologically. So use drainage attacks.)<P>Aren&#8217;t those all evil? <P>(Not really. It comes from the user, the good or evil in a spell. You need to remember that.)<P>Since when were you such an expert in the spiritual realm?<P>(Ummm...Xedri? Need I remind you that&#8217;s the only place I exist at the moment, thanks to my own clumsiness and a certain young woman, so I know it pretty damn well? I wasn&#8217;t the one in what&#8217;s basically hibernation for 12 years...so I had plenty of time to study. Besides, I paid attention in class.)<P>Right. You have a point. Paying attention is a good thing.<P>(Definitely. Now stop talking and kick his a--!)<P>She parried two strikes from her opponent, noting clinically the skill he displayed while having a broken rib, then held her sword up high and shouted &#8220;Soul Vortex!&#8221; Green tendrils rotated around the blade, then struck Fer&#8217;ath, draining some of his life force right away. He dropped into a crouch and cursed.<P>&#8220;DAMNIT. You&#8217;re good, Nightshade. No wonder you could fake your own death. I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll have to postpone the end of this match til I get my breath back.&#8221; He laughed and vanished in a small black whirling gate.<P><BR>Yakov began to circle around his foe. His blades were held outward, deceptively inviting Telak to take a shot at killing, but they were actually quite ready to parry anything the fallen Paladin would throw at their wielder. &#8220;Hmm... I see why you have allied with the darkies.&#8221; Yakov said. &#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s cause you can&#8217;t fight anything on your own?&#8221; he taunted.<P>Much to the ranger&#8217;s disappointment, the fallen knight didn&#8217;t take the bait. Telak smiled. &#8220;No. I don&#8217;t think so, it&#8217;s more about choosing the more capable as allies.&#8221; He lunged, striking hard, but it didn&#8217;t get through Yakov&#8217;s defenses. Yakov turned his parry into a counter-attack, lunging, but he met the fallen Paladin&#8217;s fist straight in the face. OW....<P>He, enraged, charged Telak, swinging sharp, quick blows. Telak parried each, and Yakov felt at last he had found an equal. A hungry light burned in the lightning of his eyes.  He pressed Telak hard, until he felt a strike in his back as one of the enemy troops bashed him to his knees.<P>Telak smiled. &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe you fell for that.&#8221; He raised his right arm and shouted &#8220;Judgment!&#8221;  Yakov was struck by hundreds of tiny blasts of force. He struck the wall and his vision went dark. <P>When it returned, his second sword was lying several feet away. He still had the grip on his first, though. Bringing it up in a loop, he said quietly &#8220;You just made a serious mistake, you know. You made me angry.&#8221; He raised his sword to the sky and pointed at Telak. &#8220;Lightning Stab!&#8221;<P>Bolts of lightning slammed into the fallen paladin, and each formed the shape of a sword blade for a split second before dissipating. Telak stumbled, then yelled &#8220;Retreat!&#8221; His men ran, and Yakov was too tired to pursue him. He collapsed as the world dropped out from under him.<P><BR>&#8220;Yakov!&#8221; Xedri ran over to the ranger. A deep red stain was around his body. She screamed &#8220;Somebody get over here and help me!&#8221;<P>One of the few survivors of her unit, a cleric, answered and placed a hand coolly on Yakov&#8217;s body. &#8220;He&#8217;s in trouble. We need to get him somewhere where I can get to work on him. The room over there..&#8221;<P>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you heal him?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Normally I could, madam, but he&#8217;s been poisoned. Damn iksies use nasty stuff on their weapons.&#8221; He looked hard at Xedri as they dragged Yakov to the room. &#8220;Have you a knife?&#8221;<P>&#8220;..Yes.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Give it to me and get his armor off him.&#8221; Xedri handed the knife to the cleric as he removed the chainmail cuirass. &#8220;All right. Hold him down, but keep out of the way.&#8221;<P>Yakov&#8217;s wound was a little puffy, and as Xedri watched, the cleric calmly sliced it open. Yakov&#8217;s reaction, even unconscious, was quite predictable. He woke up, screamed, and promptly fell unconscious again. Xedri shrieked in shock, but the cleric kept a cool head and slapped some VERY clean bandages on Yakov&#8217;s wound. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to need to work on him. I&#8217;d suggest, madam, you not watch. It&#8217;s not pretty.&#8221;<P>Xedri practically ran from the room.<P><BR>She dumped another bottle of oil on the ground, and watched with a smirk on her face as it ignited another tree and sprayed fire on five or so iksar warriors. &#8220;Little bit of burns never hurt anyone, scaly!&#8221;<P>They rushed at her, still burning. She decapitated one, cut another in two pieces.  &#8220;Get your worthless hide OUT of here Relat!&#8221; she yelled at her comrade.<P>The human wizard gave her a look and yelled back &#8220;Not until you do!&#8221; He raised his hands, shouted &#8220;Fire Flux!&#8221; and incinerated another group of charging iksar with a rain of fire that wouldn&#8217;t look out of place in Hell.<P>Tessa Parlon smiled back at her friend. &#8220;Stubborn as ever, eh?&#8221; She turned back to the battle. Situation=Bad. The iksar were whittling down her unit slowly, but steadily. She was going to die. Where the hell was her father and his troops? Why weren&#8217;t they helping?<P>She had her answer moments later, as elves, humans, and other &#8216;allied&#8217; people jumped into the battle. But they were....attacking HER troops! &#8220;What d&#8217;ya think you&#8217;re doing?&#8221; one of her men screamed seconds before he was cut down. One scoundrel engaged her, and she traded blows with him. He cut at her legs, but she contemptuously knocked his blow aside. He snarled at her and punched, then began to rain blows down on her.<P>She was blasted onto her back by a strong slash of his. Struggling to get up, she expected full well to be killed, but she heard her opponent scream and die. But another, larger group of  men and women attacked the traitors, sweeping many of them from the field.<P>Tessa looked back at the city, or what was left of it. The burning statue of Firiona Vie matched perfectly her own somber mood. For some reason, the burning statue seemed to be an omen, an omen of what the world might become.<P>Tessa sighed and returned to the battle.<P>Yakov awoke to see a clean, white room. He instinctively reached for his sword, only to realize it wasn&#8217;t on his belt. He looked around, a habit he&#8217;d picked up, checking for points of easy defense, etc.<P>This is pathetic. No one is gonna attack me!<P>He looked over to the door, and attempted valiantly to get up. On the third try, the door banged open and Xedri came flying in. &#8220;How do you feel?&#8221; she asked breathlessly.<P>&#8220;My ribs hurt, and I think I damaged my lungs, but otherwise, I feel fine.&#8221; he answered. &#8220;What&#8217;s going on? Were you hurt?&#8221;<P>&#8220;The iksies have been pushed back.&#8221; Her face turned into a scowl. &#8220;The traitors are at large, and it&#8217;s a reasonable bet that quite a few of em are alive.&#8221; She gave a wicked little smile. &#8220;The high-ups decided you did something major, so you&#8217;re being invited to a celebration in Felwithe for the &#8216;heroic defense of the outpost&#8217;.&#8221; <P>Yakov went short of breath. &#8220;Oh no.&#8221;<P>Xedri paled slightly. &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;<P>Yakov winced. &#8220;Umm....Xedri? I have no idea how to dance, sing, or any social-event behavior whatsoever.&#8221;

End Chapter 2<P>Enjoy.Night Descending, Chapter 2: Martyr<P>Yakov stood in an unoccupied house, while Xedri attempted to teach him how to dance. &#8220;Ok. Now, twirl me around......like that. And now...&#8221; she trailed off as he followed instructions. He was a good dancer, probably from conditioning, but he learned with more then a little impatience.<P>How did that go again? <P>(You know, Xedri, the idea is to check BEFORE you teach him. He needs to be confident, so let&#8217;s not let him figure out that you&#8217;re totally inept.)<P>Gee, thanks.<P>Xedri showed him the simplest way to do it, and he left. His departure caused her more then a little relief. &#8220;Finally...&#8221; she muttered. She grabbed a drink, took a sip, and went to buy her new dress. She intended to knock Yakov onto his back with it.<P>Yakov walked into the King&#8217;s court but two hours later for the celebration. He looked around, and there was Maesyn Trueshot at a table. &#8220;Maesyn!&#8221; he cried and ran over to his teacher.<P>&#8220;Yakov! How are you? You&#8217;ve finally snapped out of it.&#8221; Maesyn gave Yakov a little smirk. &#8220;And that pretty thing you picked up? How is she?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Oh, she&#8217;s fine.&#8221; Yakov smiled. &#8220;Do you know if Jes is here?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Just listen for the sound of dice, Yakov.&#8221; Maesyn grinned and pointed at the gambling tables. &#8220;You cousin seems to have this strange luck streak. I wonder...could she be..&#8221; he gave a fake little gasp &#8220;cheating?&#8221;<P>Yakov grinned halfheartedly. &#8220;You know her. Probably.&#8221;<P>Maesyn Trueshot&#8217;s face grew serious. &#8220;Yakov, you missed a lot while you were out. Aielle graduated, you know.&#8221;<P>Yakov winced. &#8220;Her? The pacifist?&#8221; He remembered Aielle. She&#8217;d given him enough trouble with swordplay lessons, so he had a special little place in his heart for her. <P>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid so. I was very unhappy for a while. She&#8217;s a little naive, but she&#8217;s got the best spirit you&#8217;ll ever see. &#8220; Maesyn smiled in the memory and pointed to the bottle in the center of the table. &#8220;Want some?&#8221;<P>Yakov poured a small portion into his glass. Maesyn nodded. &#8220;Tell me, Yakov, why did you go out the way you did? I don&#8217;t know of many elves who do that sort of thing, and they&#8217;re usually older. Why did you do that?&#8221;<P>Yakov&#8217;s face grew glum. &#8220;There are two reasons. First, times were pretty boring, and Tunare knows I needed the rest. The business with that thing, my best friend&#8217;s death, the Dread King and that erudite lad, it was all wearing me thin. Second is more important.&#8221;<P>He began to pace. &#8220;Master, I don&#8217;t really exist outside of the combat arena. I know how to fight, make weapons, and hunt. That is about it. If I&#8217;m not killing, I&#8217;m teaching others how to kill, or making things to kill with. I know nothing else.&#8221;<P>&#8220;You were having lifestyle issues?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Pretty much. I don&#8217;t really know what to do besides fight. I was hoping if I got a rest like that, maybe I could, I don&#8217;t know, learn to live in peacetime. Besides, I don&#8217;t want to drag others down with me.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Hmm. You mean her?&#8221; Maesyn asked, and though he didn&#8217;t specify a name, both men knew exactly who he was talking about.<P>&#8220;Yes. From what I could get out of her, she was raised, and pretty much bred, for warfare. It was so hard for her to break out of it. I was a bad influence, and I still am. I was hoping that while I was out, while I couldn&#8217;t affect her, she would find....someone. Someone better then me.<P>&#8220;You love her, don&#8217;t you Yakov?&#8221;<P>&#8220;I guess so. And part of that is realizing I don&#8217;t really deserve her. I tried to talk her out of going with me. I told her I wanted some time alone. She said that it really didn&#8217;t matter and she was doing whether I liked it or not. And so she did.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Does she know?&#8221;<P>&#8220;To her, I think, I&#8217;m just a friend. It&#8217;s gotten close enough that sometimes I want to shout it out to the world that I love her and get together. But, that&#8217;s the coward&#8217;s way out.&#8221; Yakov smiled bitterly. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to get her to someone more deserving. Then, who knows? Maybe I&#8217;ll find something more worthy then killing.&#8221;<P>&#8220;You treat yourself too badly, Yakov.&#8221; Maesyn Trueshot began to get up. &#8220;You&#8217;ve saved lives. You&#8217;ve done noble things. If anyone is good, you are.&#8221; He waved a young High Elf woman over. &#8220;This is Tessa Parlon. Tessa, this is Yakov Shadeleaf.&#8221; The young woman was dressed rather aggressively, and Yakov mutely and discreetly admired the nice view.<P>Parlon.......Hey. That means....<P>The young woman smiled. Her cheer was infectious. &#8220;So, you were at the fight too, huh?&#8221;&#8217;<P>Yakov nodded mutely. <P>Tessa gave a little laugh. &#8220;My my. Did they take out your vocal cords or something? Hey, wait... Where have I heard about you before?&#8221;<P>He heard a light, feminine cough he&#8217;d come to associate with Xedri. He turned around....and his jaw dropped.<P>To say it bluntly, Xedri was stunning. She was wearing a black, rather low-cut dress even by elven standards. Her white hair had obviously been paid a LOT of attention to. But what made her the most attractive wasn&#8217;t the hair, or her excellent makeup, or even the dress. It was the expression of simple joy she wore, and for a moment Yakov felt his heart light up with &#8220;if only&#8221;s.<P>&#8220;Care to dance, Lieutenant?&#8221; Her voice was so obviously a challenge that he couldn&#8217;t refuse.<P>&#8220;Why of course.&#8221; he heard himself say, though he really wouldn&#8217;t have thought he could have even made a squeak. <P>She started whirling him around on the floor. He&#8217;d never remember exactly how long he managed to stay relatively straight, because he was too busy trying to put some sense into his heart. But eventually he heard her say, &#8220;You dance very well, Yakov.&#8221;<P>&#8220;I had a good teacher,&#8221; he replied and smiled, though his mind was still screaming YOU IDIOT! at him.<BR>He felt a light tap. Turning around, he saw a High Elven aide. &#8220;Lieutenant Shadeleaf? Xedri Nightshade?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; they answered at the same time. <P>&#8220;I&#8217;m really, really sorry to ask this, but Milord Thex would desire your company in the room down the hall.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Got it. We&#8217;ll be there.&#8221; he muttered. The aide vanished into the crowd. &#8220;Damnit.&#8221; he said to her. &#8220;It&#8217;s not fair!&#8221;<P>She giggled like a schoolgirl and disentangled her arms from his. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;<P>They were walking down a hall. He opened the indicated door, and stepped into the small office.<P>An aged High Elf rose quietly from the single desk and motioned the two soldiers to a pair of chairs. Despite his formidable age, King Tearis Thex was a mighty man still. His sword lay in it&#8217;s sheath near his desk. Yakov felt his eyes tracing around the room and blushed inwardly. He didn&#8217;t even deserve to speak with the King, let alone pry!<P><BR>Xedri&#8217;s breathing quickened for but a second. Instincts from her childhood had screamed at her at the first sight of the man who was now her lord, but she managed to get it under control. Thex smiled kindly at her. &#8220;Young Xedri, I understand.&#8221; He paused. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m going to have to ask you to recall what happened in Firiona Vie.&#8221;<P>Xedri told, as quickly as she could. Thex sighed. &#8220;The whole world is coming apart, my warriors. Nothing has been going right. I&#8217;m worried, young ones. If we cannot keep this....this madness from infecting our troops, how can we keep it from spreading?&#8221;<P>A crash sounded from the hallway beyond. Yakov stood, and pulled his sword, Ringith, from his belt. It had been hidden by his black leather clothing. Xedri smiled at her friend and reached over her back, pulling her own sword from it&#8217;s hiding place.<P>&#8220;How on earth did you manage to hide such a huge sword, young Xedri?&#8221; Thex asked with slight amusement in his voice. Another crash and a scream echoed from the hallway. <P>&#8220;No one looks at my back. Everyone&#8217;s looking right here&#8221; she said, pointing at the front of her dress. Yakov for some reason blushed, and knelt at the door for a moment. There was a sickening ripping sound from beyond. Yakov listened for a split second. <P>&#8220;Eight.&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;Stay here. I&#8217;ll deal with this.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Xedri and Thex asked simultaneously. <P>&#8220;I&#8217;m expendable. You aren&#8217;t.&#8221; He opened the door quietly, then just as quietly closed it.<P>Xedri and Thex waited. There was a sudden chorus of yells, and a scream. A sickening splatter echoed into the office, then the sounds blurred into metallic rings, rips, tearing noises. Then Yakov started yelling and it was all blurred out by his screams of rage. There were more yells as well, screams of terror and cries for help. The majority were in Elvish, though there were a couple of Iksar hisses. A sword rammed it&#8217;s way through the door, then a heavy weight rebounded off the door and there was a sickening slicing noise. Xedri felt desires from her &#8216;darker&#8217; side of her psyche rising as well as nausea.<P>It continued for five minutes, then everything turned dead quiet. Xedri opened the door, then dropped to her knees, retching in sick horror.<P>Suffice it to say that the carpet had been blue, but it was definitely red now.<P>She heard Yar&#8217;at in her mind yelling at her to get a hold of herself, but she couldn&#8217;t stop. She felt so ill that she nearly passed out.<P>Yakov knelt in the center of the ruined hall. The bodies of his enemies were on the floor-what was left of them anyways. He turned around and faced her without a hint of shock or remorse. &#8220;Not very pretty, is it?&#8221; he said. &#8220;It never is.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Yakov....&#8221;<P>Thex emerged from his room. His voice was kindly, but cold and hard. &#8220;Are you finished, Lieutenant?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Finished.&#8221; Yakov said in just as hard a voice. He picked up Ringith and wiped the blade clean on a fallen man&#8217;s tunic. The sword gleamed like frozen lightning, it&#8217;s sapphire edges glinting as if hungry for battle.<P>&#8220;That&#8217;s good, Lieutenant, because you aren&#8217;t going to fail the people counting on you.&#8221; Thex withdrew his great sword from it&#8217;s sheath. Flames licked the blade constantly. &#8220;We have a building full of people who are for the most part defenseless, and we have intruders. We have to get rid of them.&#8221;<P>&#8220;S...sir? You...you&#8217;re going with us?&#8221;<P>&#8220;I DO know how to fight, Lieutenant.&#8221;<P>They moved silently through the building, heading for the central feasting hall. Dead guards were evident in some places, and once they actually came upon a running battle, just at the door of the hall. Two men, one of which was in the livery of Felwithe and another in Kelethin colors, were holding back a much greater force of at least six traitorous elves. Yakov and Xedri pulled their weapons into guard positions, but they never needed to strike a blow.<P> For at that point, Thex demonstrated exactly why he had survived so many assassination attempts and lived to become the King of the Elves.<P>He dropped into a crouch and pointed his sword at a cluster of traitors. Yelling hoarsely in a much stronger voice then one would think, Thex called out &#8220;Spirit Fire!&#8221; A blast of white light fired itself from his blade tip.<P>Anything in the way of that awful light was simply obliterated. Gone. Only char marks remained of where the victims had once stood. Grinning like a much younger man, Thex brought his sword back into guard position.<P>The surviving man and woman, so similar they were probably brother and sister, dropped to their knees, went into seizures, and fell unconscious.<P>Yakov and Xedri stared.<P>Thex calmly sheathed his sword. That was probably a mistake, for a small dart sliced through the air from a passageway. It struck Thex in the right shoulder, ripping through armor and vanishing into the wound.<P>All four elven soldiers cried out at once. One of the guards was running after the fleeing assassin in seconds. Both disappeared into a side passageway, and a few seconds there was a shocking detonation and a scream. The soldier returned with a grim set to his face.<P>The other man was trying to treat Thex, while Yakov and Xedri looked on. He looked up angrily. &#8220;I don&#8217;t need your help!&#8221; he snapped. &#8220;Get in that room now! Nobody in there is armed!&#8221;<P>Tessa was about to get a drink when an explosion rocked the building. She groped for her sword, only realizing it was back at home seconds later. A group of men burst into the room, and most of the dancers pulled back. She began to shrink towards an armored man.<P>A man in black armor, built like a wood elf, entered the room and surveyed it. &#8220;Well, what are you waiting for?&#8221; he asked his men in a hideous voice. Something wasn&#8217;t right about that voice. &#8220;Kill them, you idiots!&#8221;<P>Another man emerged from the group. He was wearing a suit of grayish armor that she would recognize instantly. It&#8217;s father! she thought with a wild surge of glee. He would help them! He&#8217;d show those ruffians what a true warrior did!<P>Telak Parlon smiled chillingly. &#8220;Good idea.&#8221; He drew his sword. <P>Tessa, her mind stunned, still leapt onto the enemy soldier&#8217;s back. She dealt him a single, savage punch to the head and he collapsed. Grabbing his sword, she ignored the rest of the soldiers and charged her father.<P>&#8220;Why, father!?&#8221; she screamed at him, and tried to knock the sword out of his hands.<P>He didn&#8217;t answer, and she couldn&#8217;t see his face under the helmet. He swung back, and she was literally blasted off her feet and onto the ground. Her body fought with gravity for a split second.<P>Gravity won. She was knocked out by the fall.<P>Yakov kicked open the door. His rage was doubled as he saw the soldiers attacking practically helpless civilians, and molten, liquid fire filled the room from their spells. His sword soared out, plunging through armor and flesh without even the most momentary hesitation. Then he stopped.<P>A man familiar to him stood in the center of the room. He was younger then Yakov was by a year or two, which was to elves about a third of a year. His hands lipped flame, and in one of them was a dread sword. The Despair.<P>Black as night, the Despair was an incredibly destructive blade, named so for the low to high pitched howling it made as it struck. The man was also wearing black armor Yakov knew no ranger had ever been trained to wear.<P>&#8220;Pyr.&#8221; he gasped. <P>The young ranger turned around, and Yakov suppressed a shudder. Pyr&#8217;s face was twisting, as if it was constantly shifting emotion, from loathing to pleading. A dark look alternated with a terrorized light in his eyes. And when he spoke, the voice was definitely not his. &#8220;Shadeleaf.&#8221; The voice was frighteningly familiar.<P>Ve&#8216;ach......<P>&#8220;You!&#8221; Yakov replied, and with an enraged slash tried to strike the sword out of Pyr&#8217;s uncontrolled hand. But the possessed young man was far too quick. He parried and riposted in one fluid move, then ignited the entire floor. Yakov was knocked back, but with a contemptuous dismissing tone he addressed the abomination before him. &#8220;How dare you defile this place with your foul presence?!&#8221;<P>Ve&#8217;ach&#8217;s stolen face shifted into a grin for a second. &#8220;It seemed that they forgot my invitation, so Innoruuk made a new one for me.&#8221; His sword lashed out like a whip, but it bounced off Yakov&#8217;s quick guard. <P>Yakov leapt high into the air and hovered there for a split second. &#8220;Thunderstrike!&#8221; he yelled. Lightning pierced the roof and hit Pyr/Ve&#8217;ach, but he gave no visible sign of damage. &#8220;You are supposed to be dead!&#8221; he shouted.<P>Ve&#8217;ach smiled mirthlessly. &#8220;Yeah, I guess I am. But don&#8217;t feel bad. This guy was second choice.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Second choice?&#8221; Yakov struck hard, buckling the visor and snapping it off. Ve&#8217;ach&#8217;s expression did not change.<P>&#8220;You were my first.&#8221;<P>Yakov&#8217;s skin began to feel distinctly uncomfortable. &#8220;And what is it you want?&#8221; he asked harshly.<P>&#8220;My lord Innoruuk has decided the time is ripe for our conquest. Even as we speak, the plane of Growth is being assaulted, the upstarts at Highpass are under attack, and my lord gave me the honor of leading the attack here. &#8221; <P>&#8220;You&#8217;re dead, Ve&#8217;ach. You can&#8217;t do anything. I&#8216;d love to see you try and take Lady Tunare on. I&#8216;m assuming there wouldn&#8216;t be enough to scrape off a wall...&#8221;<P>Ve&#8217;ach laughed. &#8220;Your goddess dies now, Shadeleaf. Innoruuk could deal with the Black Elf, could he not? His death is one of the omens of the prophecy. Tunare shall die NOW, Yakov, and you with her! Enjoy eternity, Shadeleaf...&#8221;<P>Yakov didn&#8217;t even bother to reply, but cut towards the evil thing&#8217;s head. Ve&#8217;ach hissed as the sword cut his stolen cheek, leaving a bloody wound. His eyes narrowed with anger.<P> Ve&#8217;ach yelled &#8220;Fire Flux&#8221; and flames engulfed the ranger. The sensation of burning was awful, and Yakov screamed in agony, dropping to the floor and sword clattering to the ground. I hope by all the true gods Dirk&#8217;s around! he thought desperately. <P>Ve&#8217;ach raised the Despair.<P>A familiar voice shouted &#8220;Nocturne Beam!&#8221;. A black beam, carrying with it the glint and majesty of night, knocked into Ve&#8217;ach. He laughed, mockingly, and raised the sword again. &#8220;Whoever is interfering, I&#8217;ll deal with you in your own time!&#8221;<P>Pyr&#8217;s face contorted, and the young ranger screamed &#8220;NO!&#8221; in his own voice and drove the Despair into himself. Then that momentary control vanished, and Ve&#8217;ach smiled again, regardless of the sword embedded in his torso. &#8220;Hmm. No good for now. You can try, but it&#8217;s inevitable! You can&#8217;t fight destiny! I&#8217;ll see you later, Shadeleaf.&#8221; He vanished in a black swirl.<P>Xedri parried one hit from a fallen paladin, then gave him something new to worry about with a quick one-two combination of sword thrusts. The man gasped and died, and Xedri&#8217;s attention shifted to a new target. Telak Parlon. She raised her sword, and it descended, the world seeming to slow down. <P>Telak parried the stroke perfectly, his attention leaving the fallen woman he was standing over and shifting in under a second. He raised his free hand, and Xedri felt suddenly very afraid. She wasn&#8217;t good enough to take on Parlon! What was she thinking?<P> A force wrapped itself around her waist, and carried her screaming into the air. She struck the ceiling hard, then was smashed into a wall. The breath was knocked out of her, the world began to darken. <P>She faintly heard the slamming of an opening door. Her head slowly and painfully turned towards the new source of aggravation. She just wanted to rest...<P>Thex emerged from the doorway, and his face was terrible to see. Then she blacked out.<P>Yakov heard the screaming of energy from Thex&#8217;s spell before he turned around. Bolts of white light swarmed the room, blasting their victims to shreds.  He turned and knelt towards his king. This is getting out of hand, he thought.<P>As the last man dropped to the floor, there was another slamming open of the door. &#8220;Sir!&#8221; screamed a panicked cleric.<P>Thex turned and nodded. &#8220;What is it, Melar?&#8221;<P>&#8220;The priests at the temple were praying to Lady Tunare! But their contact has gone out! We can&#8217;t commune with her! The sun is gone like a snuffed candle! Felwithe is filled with terror!&#8221;<P>--------------------<P>Good is subjective. Evil never changes.

Yet another update. This is the end of chapter three. Please, please, please, tell me what you think of it.<P> Night Descending, Chapter Three: Nightmares<P>Inside the Plane of Growth, the evil army stood and gloated over Tunare&#8217;s fallen form. A Demon Prince, general of the army, howled out his triumph.<P>&#8220;You don&#8217;t really think you&#8217;ve won, do you?&#8221; The voice was emotionless, without pity or ridicule.<P>The twenty-foot high Demon Prince raised his awful face to the speaker. A black-cloaked form stood calmly on a ridge. The figure cast no shadow.<P>&#8220;Attack it!!!!&#8221; the Prince roared. His army started forward, howling and slavering and shouting war cries.<P>The figure didn&#8217;t move. As the nightmarish host bore down on it, it slowly and deliberately raised one arm. A black aura began to form about that arm. As the army continued it&#8217;s frightful charge, the figure sighed and said &#8220;Stop.&#8221;<P>The demons paid no heed.<P>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say I didn&#8217;t warn you...&#8221; The figure pointed with one gauntleted hand at the enemy host. &#8220;Vengeance!&#8221; it cried in a voice of thunder. The black aura leapt from the arm and formed a corona around the entire enemy army, stopping them dead.<P>Lightning seethed within that awful corona, blasted it&#8217;s victims to ruined masses of charcoal. As the lightning subsided, about half of the victims were dead right away. Then black bolts rained in towards the center of the corona, and finally, the entire black mass of energy crystallized, then slowly dissipated. The bodies of the dead broke apart with it, then vanished.<P>There were very few survivors, and all of those were grievously injured.<P>The Demon Prince gaped at the figure which had just annihilated his entire force. It slowly descended towards him. &#8220;You know, even if you were to win here, killing a goddess is something beyond your power, or mine, or anyone else&#8217;s. They exist on a different level of reality, you know. So you may have put Tunare out of action for a while, but your entire raid was futile unless other conditions are met. As long as there are some who worship her, you can&#8217;t win easily.&#8221; The figure stopped within sword reach. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give you a chance to run. If you are smart, you&#8217;ll take it.&#8221;<P>The Demon Prince struck, hundreds of green bolts striking the figure. It gave no sign of injury, but laughed. &#8220;All right.&#8221;<P>The figure raised it&#8217;s hand into a sword-grasping position, and a sword of blazing energy appeared in it&#8217;s hand. It went into a guard position.<P>The Demon Prince struck, hundreds of claw blows descending at frightful speed. The sword blade parried each and every one of them. Not a single scratch to the cloak of the figure impacted. The return strike slashed one of the Demon&#8217;s arms off. Black blood drenched the ground. <P>The Demon and the figure traded lightning-quick blows for several minutes. As blow after blow struck his face, the Demon began to slaver and howl even more. Finally, a single claw strike hit the figure, and the cloak was whipped away.<P>The Demon screamed then, a terrified wail. As the figure looked up at him, it&#8217;s hand gripped his chest and slipped through the flesh. It picked the fifty-ton monster up like a feather, then got hold of the creature&#8217;s heart. The Demon screamed again, the hatred spilling out of him like a plague. The figure&#8217;s expression did not change. As it&#8217;s fingers grasped the heart of it&#8217;s victim, it began to crush it, iron-like force compressing the organ.<P>There was a terrible sound as it was crushed like an eggshell. The Demon&#8217;s mouth lolled open, and a dreadful shower of blood poured out for a little while. Then the mouth closed as he died.<P>Black fire swept through it then, igniting it&#8217;s body until it was a blazing inferno. The figure threw the body as if it weighed nothing, it&#8217;s great weight crashing to the ground.<P>The black-armored man replaced his cloak. Then, eyes still visible under the hood, he turned to the surviving demons.<P>They suddenly decided it was a little too hot in the Plane of Growth, and left rather quickly. The black-clad figure laughed harshly, then spoke to empty air. &#8220;I got them before they could attack your shrine. Are you all right?&#8221; The ruined body of Tunare faded into nothingness.<P>Tunare&#8217;s silent voice echoed in his head. (Thank you. I thought you were dead.)<P>I encourage that rumor as much as possible. Makes it easier to move around.<P>(Well, I must reward you in some way. I cannot have you go unpaid for this.)<P>It&#8217;s nothing. I have my own goals, Lady. I don&#8217;t need payment until I fulfill them.<P>(Well, it&#8217;s just as well. I&#8217;m barely alive. I&#8217;m still very weak.)<P>Then I guess I&#8217;d better see no more of them get through to damage you, eh?<P><BR>Yakov twisted and turned in bed. His mind was occupied by nightmares of previous battles.<P>Yakov, twenty years ago, swung hard. It impacted on the side of the dark elf&#8217;s helmet and bounced off. The return strike hit him in the right leg, dropping the young elf to the ground and damaging a tendon. He screamed in pain, then desperately parried stroke after stroke at his face.<P>One got through. It sliced open an area on his right cheek, and dark blood stained his vision. Wiping his face off with one arm, Yakov looked up only in time to see Ve&#8217;ach&#8217;s demonstration of a good kick right into his face. The shadowknight laughed coldly. &#8220;Time to die, ranger!&#8221;<P>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so!&#8221; Arila smashed Ve&#8217;ach hard in the back. Summoning the forces of wind, she cried &#8220;Windstorm!&#8221; A huge tornado blasted Ve&#8217;ach away. Kneeling down, she asked &#8220;Are you all right?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Hurts to move, Arila. Ahh...can you see what you can do?&#8221;<P>Arila muttered a quick prayer. Yakov managed to get into a crouch. &#8220;Well at least he&#8217;s finished. Let&#8217;s get out of here, Yakov. I&#8217;ll buy you a drink, on me.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Where did you ever get that idea, young lady?&#8221; Ve&#8217;ach asked. Raising the Despair, the shadow knight dropped down from the sky.<P>&#8220;Arila, look out!&#8221;<P>Arila turned-just in time to receive the Despair right into her heart. She screamed, an awful sound to hear, and writhed on the tip of the blade. Ve&#8217;ach grinned widely, and raised the sword up, pulling her up with it.<BR>&#8220;No!&#8221; Yakov screamed, and managed to pull himself up, raising his sword.<P>Ve&#8217;ach began to chant in a hideous language. <P>&#8220;I&#8217;ll kill you!&#8221;<P>Arila screamed in agony.<P>&#8220;Stop, damn you!&#8221;<P>Ve&#8217;ach paid no heed, but continued his chanting, as it got louder and louder. Arila&#8217;s still writhing body began to glow a deep green, and it wavered somewhat. She screamed a final time, and as it kept going, she began to melt into a formless cloud of life energy.<P>&#8220;A-R-I-LA!&#8221; Yakov yelled.<P>The cloud of energy that had been his girlfriend merged with the Despair. There was a faintly audible, but clearly recognized, sigh in her voice, then it disappeared.<P>Yakov raised the blade. &#8220;I&#8217;ll KILL you!&#8221; he screamed, then leapt high in the air and slashed open Ve&#8217;ach&#8217;s torso. But he wasn&#8217;t finished with the clearly wounded shadowknight, and continued to rip parts of armor and chunks of flesh off the evil man. Ve&#8217;ach tried desperately to parry, but strike after strike connected. Fixing Ve&#8217;ach a glare of pure hate, he drove the sword directly through the shadowknight&#8217;s chest, then flooded it with megawatt after megawatt of lightning. <P>Ve&#8217;ach&#8217;s corpse, a bloody, ruined thing toppled to the ground. The Despair vanished in an inky whirl.<P>Kneeling on the ground, exhausted, Yakov Shadeleaf wept.<P>Yakov woke up gasping. He angrily punched his pillow and got dressed as quickly as he possibly could. Pulling on his chainmail cloak, and donning his mithril breastplate, the ranger grabbed some provisions and hurried out of the inn.<P>&#8220;Going somewhere?&#8221; Xedri&#8217;s voice was quiet, but it sent a shiver through him.<P>&#8220;Actually, I was thinking about it.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Well, you were intending to leave me behind, I see.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Actually, I was.&#8221; He turned around and gave her a steady look. &#8220;Well, is the rest of Felwithe tagging along?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Not really. Just my little friend here.&#8221; <P>&#8220;Little?&#8221; came a voice from around a corner. Tessa Parlon punched Xedri lightly in the shoulder. &#8220;Well? Is this your friend?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Sort of a letdown, isn&#8217;t it? I&#8217;ve always told him he should pay more attention to his clothes.&#8221; Xedri turned and smiled mockingly at Yakov. &#8220;As you can see, dear, we aren&#8217;t exactly gonna let you go off by yourself. So, where were you planning to go, anyways?&#8221;<P>Yakov could only gape. Then, getting his voice, he said &#8220;Back to Kunark for now. I&#8217;m going to have a look at Firiona Vie, or what&#8217;s left of it. There has to be some sort of clue there.&#8221;<P>&#8220;What about Highpass?&#8221;<P>&#8220;That&#8217;s where we are going afterwards. If I remember correctly, Highpass can take any assault for a while.&#8221;<P>&#8220;And when did you last remember correctly? Highpass is more important then a ruined city.&#8221;<P>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a point.&#8221; <P>The sun had yet to come out two days later. In the West Commonlands, it was like eternal night had claimed the world. Unaffected by the sun, dark elves marauded and killed all in their path. Yakov and his two lady friends had to be quiet or they would die.<P>&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe this.&#8221; he said quietly, watching the manically laughing evil ones torch another homestead. Then another thing caught his eyes. &#8220;NO!&#8221; he shouted, and leapt forth, leaving his two companions to stare.<P>The dark elves were sacrificing children. They turned from their gruesome work to draw their swords and face the ranger. One of the four began to chant a spell, the other three rushed at him.<P>The first thrust was so powerful it went right through Yakov&#8217;s victim. The sword blade punched through the hardened steel breastplate and right out the other side. Then, as he pulled his sword back out, all sorts of things people need came out along with it. The man screamed and fell dying.<P>The other two attacked him simultaneously. Parrying a stroke from one and then the other, Yakov was forced to constantly switch position to avoid losing his head-literally. As he swung, Yakov noticed both the blood-red symbols painted on their armor and the fact that one of them was notably clumsier then the other.<P>The chanting man finished chanting, and a skeleton rose from the earth to enter the melee. But the ranger didn&#8217;t miss a beat. He separated the skeleton&#8217;s lower body from it&#8217;s torso, then, as if just to emphasize his displeasure, he drove his sword into the caster&#8217;s heart. Turning around, he received a light stroke from one of the men, and hissed in anger.<P>He feinted at the striker, and as the man parried a stroke which never came, cut his head off. He turned around...<P>Just in time to get stabbed in the chest. He gasped, and heard Xedri scream and draw her own sword. But as the man leered at him, he grabbed the sword blade in both hands, regardless of the mild cutting, then fed it-and it&#8217;s wielder- a blast or six of electricity. Screaming in agony, the man fell don, a burning corpse seconds later.<P>Yakov gasped and fell down. He nearly blacked out with the pain. &#8220;You need a surgeon!&#8221; Xedri exclaimed. &#8220;That should have killed you.&#8221;<P>&#8220;I&#8217;ve...always...been...tough...to...kill.&#8221; he managed to get out. &#8220;Somebody...get this....off me.&#8221; He pointed at his breastplate. <P>&#8220;I&#8217;ll handle this.&#8221; Tessa&#8217;s voice. She knelt down and laid her hands on the wound, Yakov immediately felt a lot better, but his chest was sore. <P>&#8220;How in hell?&#8221; Xedri asked.<P>&#8220;I am a healer, remember?&#8221;<BR>She helped him to his feet, then pointed. &#8220;The road to Highpass is that way.&#8221;<P>After an hour&#8217;s travel, he saw a forest. He felt the hairs on his neck rising. &#8220;Kithicor.&#8221; he muttered.<P>&#8220;What?&#8221; Tessa asked. <P>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me you&#8217;ve never heard of Kithicor.&#8221; Xedri said. She was looking at the forest with the sort of enthusiasm one would look at his or her own grave.<P>Xedri shivered. The forest of Kithicor had a bad reputation. Of those who went in at night, very few came out. And nearly all of those were driven mad. This is day, she though. So there isn&#8217;t going to be any danger.....is there?<P>(I would bet on it.)<P>Why?<P>(The problem with this eclipse is that day is basically night. But you do have to go through, or turn around and give up.)<P>I don&#8217;t give up. And I&#8217;m not scared of old stories.<P>(Xedri, it&#8217;s a bad place. I honestly would suggest you stay out.)<P>Forget it.<P>(Sigh.)<P>She spoke aloud. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to go through, you know.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Yakov didn&#8217;t look happy about it, but his face hardened.<P>The forest of Kithicor whispered of death. It smelled like an open grave, and she could hear shrieks, moans, and scraping noises. Yakov looked at the ground, then breathed quietly. &#8220;They are all around us. Listen very carefully. If I get in trouble, I want you two to RUN. Run as hard as you can, and do not leave the path if you value your life. Only follow the Highpass road. Pay no attention to anything else. I want no heroics.&#8221;<P>&#8220;What is so awful in here?&#8221; Tessa asked. <P>&#8220;Look.&#8221; Yakov pointed. A vague shape slipped through the trees. Then Tessa saw. There was the remains of a house, and it&#8217;s butchered inhabitants lay near it, their ruined faces twisted into expressions of terror.<P>Tessa&#8217;s face turned white.<P>&#8220;Seen enough not to doubt me?&#8221;<P>Tessa nodded. <P>They started down the path. Yakov&#8217;s eyes were wide open. He frequently looked around, his hand on his sword hilt, his face drawn. &#8220;Sh...&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Can you hear that?&#8221;<P>Xedri stretched out her mind to scan the area for undead. Her mind met something powerful for a second, then she broke the contact and whispered back. &#8220;Something really powerful is coming for us.&#8221;<P>Yakov drew his sword and pulled a second one from his swordbelt. &#8220;Run. This is a foe beyond any of you.&#8221;<P>The two women stared at him.<P>&#8220;Do I have to repeat myself? RUN!&#8221; He gave Xedri another look. &#8220;RUN, DAMN YOU!!!!&#8221;<P>She ran. She could hear a sort of sighing sound in the wind. She kept right on running, Tessa behind her. They flew down paths, not daring to look around for enemies. We&#8217;re screwed, Yar&#8217;at! <P>(Don&#8217;t give up so easily-look up! Xedri, look up!)<P>A black shadow dropped from the trees above her and landed on top of Tessa, who fell with a scream. The shadow rose up, and Xedri felt her stomach turn. It was a terrible sight to behold. A skeletal form, with skin, but the skin was so tight that Xedri could see the bones moving beneath it. It opened a mouth dripping with greenish ichors and shrieked. <P>Xedri had her sword out faster then she had ever done before. She knew that unless she found some way to destroy the monster, both of them were doomed to a fate worse then death. She fed the nightmare the pointed end of her sword, then rose up into the air with a yell and cried &#8220;Shadow Strike!&#8221; Darkness encased the ghoul, but it brushed it aside and slashed at Xedri. She felt the skin on her chest open, and a strange sort of dead feeling. Ignoring that, she cut off a limb, but the monster knocked her down. It opened a mouth filled with rotting carrion and snapped at her face.<P>&#8220;Die, damn you!&#8221; she shrieked at the ghoul, then fed it a painful helping of sword. It pulled hard, ignoring the sword lodged in it&#8217;s head. She managed to beat it off with her fists, then pulled back and shouted &#8220;Shatter!&#8221; The bones of the ghoul finally snapped apart, and the whole nightmarish thing broke into tiny shards.<P>She ran over to the wounded paladin, who was gasping on the ground. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m going to make it...&#8221; Tessa managed to get out. Then Xedri saw the greenish wound, and shivered.<P>&#8220;Tessa, get a hold of yourself. Tessa, listen to me.&#8221; Xedri stopped as her friend looked up. &#8220;I want you to think about your blood. There&#8217;s poison in it. Burn it out.&#8221;<P>Tessa weakly gripped her own torso, and muttered a prayer. The skin she grabbed turned bright red for a second, and the wounded paladin screamed as she heated her own bloodstream. Then it was over, and Tessa&#8217;s eyes rolled up in her head and she passed out.<P>The sound of clapping echoed through the forest. &#8220;A good show, if I do say so myself.&#8221;<P>Xedri turned around. &#8220;Oh no, not you.&#8221; she said weakly.<P>Fer&#8217;ath smiled. &#8220;I was rather impressed with your work with the ghoul. Now, would you please get your sword?&#8221;<P>At the entrance to the Kithicor woods, a single shadow descended from the night and passed through the trees. The sound of any animal had silenced.<P>Yakov breathed quietly, waiting. He had known the second that he had told his friends to run that he was consigning himself to death, yet he knew it was the right thing to do. Oddly, he felt more at peace then he had in years. If I&#8217;m going to die, I&#8217;d rather die protecting my friends then die old and gray, he thought.<P>He suddenly felt extraordinarily cold. Every hair on his body stood at attention. He didn&#8217;t bother to turn around. &#8220;I know you are there. Come out, and let&#8216;s dance. I&#8216;ll show you how a man fights.&#8221;<P>He heard something moving. Oddly, there was no moan. He suddenly realized his breath was visible. Kithicor isn&#8217;t that cold, he thought. What&#8217;s going on?<P>He turned, and his eyes opened wide....<P>A greenish form stood before him. <P>&#8220;Arila....&#8221; he breathed. <P>&#8220;Yakov...&#8221; Her voice was clear. This can&#8217;t be. She&#8217;s dead. She&#8217;s more then dead!<P>&#8220;How...can this be? I saw him kill you! I saw him....&#8221; his voice trailed off. A single tear creased his face. Arila was exactly as he&#8217;d remembered. and that scared him badly. Now he truly felt afraid, scared like he hadn&#8217;t for as long as he could remember.<P>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221; Her voice was bitter. &#8220;Yeah, you SAW him do it. You SAW, and you did NOTHING!&#8221; Her voice rose to a scream. &#8220;You didn&#8217;t even try to stop him.&#8221; she wept. She drew a scimitar, it&#8216;s edges blood red. &#8220;That&#8217;s why.....that&#8217;s why you&#8217;re going to JOIN me!&#8221; She rushed at him. He desperately parried the stroke, his finely honed skills scrambled by the enormity of his situation.<P>&#8220;Arila...I...I didn&#8217;t just watch! Arila....I loved you! I wouldn&#8217;t do that!&#8221;<P>&#8220;Loved?&#8221; Her voice was a harsh, bitter laugh. &#8220;You didn&#8217;t love me.&#8221; She slashed at him again. He parried, without trying to counterattack. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; she taunted. &#8220;Are you suddenly filled with guilt? ARE YOU?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Arila...I don&#8217;t want this! I can&#8217;t hit you!&#8221; He shivered. &#8220;You can&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll hit you!&#8221;<P>She mocked him. &#8220;Oh, suddenly Master Shadeleaf has a conscience! This is strange!&#8221; She cut hard at him, ripping a bloody wound in his side. &#8220;Are you suffering?&#8221; she shrieked, a dreadful hunger in her voice. &#8220;ARE YOU SUFFERING LIKE YOU MADE ME SUFFER?&#8221; She raised her hands. &#8220;I&#8217;ll show you!&#8221; Fire rushed into her hands and she called &#8220;Pyroblaze!&#8221; The flames licked at him, burning him, filling his body and his mind with agony. &#8220;It makes me wonder what I ever saw in you.&#8221; she said callously.<P>That simple statement shattered his resolve. He realized then that he would truly die alone. His heart sank.<P>My whole life comes down to this. Bloody and burning and dying, killed by the woman I loved. It is a pity that everything I have done is death and that I will have to live with this for all eternity... His thoughts screeched to a halt as he saw Arila standing above him.<P>&#8220;Get up! Get up and fight me! GET UP!&#8221; She kicked him, hard. He wondered for a second how a spirit could hit him so hard.<P>&#8220;No.&#8221; he whispered.<P>&#8220;NO?&#8221; Angrily she raised her burning hands and poured a little bit of fire at him. &#8220;NO?? Get up!&#8221;<P>&#8220;I won&#8217;t do it.&#8221; Blood ran into his eyes for a second, then he brushed it away. &#8220;Kill me if you want to, but I&#8217;m never going to hurt you.&#8221;<P>Arila raised her scimitar with a wild scream.<P>Please tell what how it's doing. PLEASE.<P>--------------------<P>Good is subjective. Evil never changes.
