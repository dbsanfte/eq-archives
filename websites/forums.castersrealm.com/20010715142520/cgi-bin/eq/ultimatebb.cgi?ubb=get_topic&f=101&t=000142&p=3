AMAZED SHUT THE FUKING HELL UP YOU STUPID BAST@RD, everoyne just now has made fuking great points, our Epic, PFFFT BLOW ME wtf is that? god sake, I MIGHT of been able to swallow that turd if they had even fuking taken the time to make new graphics for it, why not make it like the warrior epic either 1 hand or 2? give us a choice, i dunno im trying to reach half way on this one. Why doesnt verrant say "Opps our bad lets change that..."<P>Ac, yes what was said is true, we dont get enough and neither do warriors/Sk, i think those 3 classes should actually be able to tank(ac wise), warriors are up there already, SK's got a little edge(on melee taunting) not much and in some area's are worse than pallies, but over all we need some help, and dont throw that class envy bull shyt in my face again, you stupid imbred bast@rds, i know god damned well what the problem is and if your to fuking busy running around with your druid or what ever well dont even bother posting your crap on this thread again.<P>------------------<BR>-PsychoSimatic-<BR>-Garethec Azzenblade-<BR>-Bertoxxulous-

I just want to say a little thought I had, and I'm not gonna read replies so don't bother talking to me.<P>I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that comparatively with other classes, our epic is not all that good.  Now, with that in mind, pallys in theory get the best swords in the game (thats holy swords, and unfortunately, they are not the best).  Shouldn't our epic actually be the BEST?  Aren't we supposed to be blessed by our gods?  Warriors are tanks, they should get good armor.  Rangers should really get an epic bow, but thats just my opinion.  Shouldn't the pally have the best sword in the game?  Thats just what I think.

I won't take the time to comment on most of the issues raised here. Most of my concerns have been discussed, and most of the points that I would make for/against psycho's arguments have been made. I'll just answer some questions:<P>>ok wtf, we HAVE NO WEPS IN FEAR, or in any other planes that i can think of, if we do pleas tell me, but ohter than that everyone else does. -psycho<P>We do have a weapon from the planes that is dropped. we have several actually but the most prominent one and my favorite is <P>Darkmetal Holy Water Sprinkler<BR>dmg: 16<BR>dly: 29<BR>slot: Primary Hand<BR>type: 1hb<BR>bonuses: +4 wis<P>I love mine and even though it's not as good as some of the kunark weapons available to us and other classes, neither are the war/ran/sk weapons that drop in hate/fear.<P>>it's ALMOST THE EXACT SAME AS THE FA!!! 2HS (which is lame, as I NEED a shield and a 1 handed weapon to use for ac and bashing), -zuchrom69<P>the fiery defender is not exactly like the fiery avenger. it is a different graphic completely, the hilt looks different and if you haven't noticed-there is no blade at all...just the fire (this point btw I have issues with myself. at higher levels most people do raids with particle effects turned off and thus the sword looks like the pali is just holding the hilt...wtg verant design team) But about the shield issue: the Fiery defender has 15 ac and I believe you CAN bash with it. It's the superior damage of the 2 hander with the shield + bash bonus of the 1 handed style. It is not the best epic but it does NOT suck.<P>>I was borrowing a friends lvl 47 Human Paladin (in FULL Ro armor with a Soulfire) -Benko<P>ROFL this just cracked me up. 47 pali in FULL ro? you say that as if it's something special. Soulfire? If you use your soulfire for anything but the five charges of CH, you don't know anything about paladins. C'mon guys don't you think this is the funniest comment in this entire post? By lvl 47 you should have full DW (except legs and bp) or you should be well on your way to it. LOL. no wonder you couldn't kill the frickin ghost...play your druid man.<P>anyway keep arguin. it makes me laugh.<P>Braxter<BR>52 pal<BR>veeshan<P><BR>

Ok this is my response to the fellow that borrowed his friend lvl 47 paladin in Full Ro and Soulfire to solo the Ghoust in Unrest.<P>First off, unlike warriors it does take some tactics to play a paladin. I dunno abt your friend, but I always carry my Ghoulbane and Cracked Darkwood Shield around with me along with my Blade of Xalgoz wherever I go. When I'm fighting a spell casting mob, I would use my sword and shield combo and bash or stun whenever the mob is casting a spell. Yes using a 1hs and shield on a mob could be slow but ye're saving yourself alot of dmg with the bashing and stunning to interrupt spell casting. Plus of course in Unrest against all those undeads Ghoulbane's 162 dd do come in handy!! Unless your friend is an airhead, Ghostroom in Unrest should be a breeze.<P>I just finished a session with a great group in the Lord room LGuk. There were a 44 SK, 42 Warrior, 43 Rogue, 43 Chanter, 40 Cleric and me a 40 Paly ( or thereabout I think ), there was a pull gone bad and the cleric died. There were 3 to 5 mobs then and the chanter was LOM for more debuff and mez and the warrior and sk were at 50% heath. During those fights I had to break off to throw a Gheal or two. That bought us enuff time for the cleric to make his way NEKKID all the way to the Lord room to come save us. Of course I wasnt the one to save the day but hey I did my part and the group pulled thru. So that says something about our class as a whole and we're not that awful if we learn how to use what Verant has given us and play our paly to their fullest.<P>AND PSYCO**** DONT RESPOND TO THIS POST COZ I'M NOT RESPONDING TO YOUR POSTS. I JUST WANNA SAY SOMETHING TO THOSE THAT THINK PALADINS IS A FUC*ED UP CLASS.<P>Dsilver<BR>M Marr Paladin of the 40th Crusade<BR>Drinal<P><BR>

I knew that name Soan sounded familiar. Now I remember who you are. You challenged me to a duel on Fenin Ro when I was level 45 and you were level 50. You had to have your cleric friend heal you when I was about to beat you down. When I was strafing in circles you said you were getting dizzy LOL. <P>Ok no more hating  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"> Just wanted to bring back old memories. <P>-Citrus

Ok, here is some more info, sorry, was catching up and never registered here before, but this is getting more fun than the game :-)<P>Theologian Claymore<BR>Statistical Information<BR>Classes:  Paladins<BR>Races:  All Races<BR>Type: 2H Slash<BR>Damage: 20<BR>Delay: 36<BR>Stats:  +4 INT +5 STR<BR>Special Attributes:  MAGIC, NO DROP, LORE<BR>Slot(s):  Primary Hand Slot<BR>Weight:  6.5 Stone<P>Dropped in the Plane of Hate<P>Also, I am one of the first Paladins on the Veeshan server, semi retired, but starting to play again since they finally took out that exp decriment we suffered through.  Paladins are only as good as you play it, there really is nothing wrong, and with the right tactics we can be better than any of the other melee classes...  I have personally dueled every melee class my level or above (last one was a 52 monk when I was 51) and won, just takes the right tactics and use of spells mixed with skills.<P>And as far as grouping, most of the time when I seek out a group, I get in one, so Paladins are well respected still.  Just be persistent, usually we are seen as arrogant, but that is due to persistance.  And keep a secondary around to play when you get frustrated.<P>Tentori Holyblade<BR>Holy Follower of Mithaniel Marr

No disrespect, but... dueling has no meaning what so ever, wow you can kill another class, paladins are one of the best dueling classes (LOH) but it's what you bring to the group that matters, so unless ya play on a Pvp it's nothing huge, and rember your only the best duelign class every 72 minutes....<P>------------------<BR>-PsychoSimatic-<BR>-Garethec Azzenblade-<BR>-Bertoxxulous-

I guess I mistaken you for someone who takes pride in your class....  All I was trying to do was put forth a sense of pride instead of hearing others whine about what is wrong.  I have taken my pally through the game from the start of EQ, living improvement to nerf to improvement to nerf, just adjusting my tactics each way.  That is one thing about a Pally, we have tactics noone else can use and at times, have to make the toughest decisions, do we back off and heal, do we continue tanking, LoH the ench or save it for the clr, etc etc...  Just go with it, or try another class for a while, maybe you will see there are hardly any downfalls to a Pally.

Also, i realize that a good way to relate to a topic is through your own experience, but guys come on, lets not pour our hearts out on this stuff, stick to the topics, which once again i say are " Plane weps, Epics, Armor, And us gettin screwed in the arse all around the place", and dont tell me that " i should try another class >snort< you just complain and whine >pushes glasses up< cause you just dont know what our doing" yeh sure thing all star.....<P>------------------<BR>-PsychoSimatic-<BR>-Garethec Azzenblade-<BR>-Bertoxxulous-

Think Psyco needs a shrink. If you're not convinced that Paladin as a class is not enjoyable then don't play one and don't post here airing your opinions of paladin and paladin equipment when nothing we say will satisfy you and theres nothing you can do to Verant to make paladin equipment the way you want it.<P>So warrior and ranger equipment is great huh? And they're not underpowered post 45 huh? Then for cripes sake go play em instead of ranting here. Sheesh, its a game where you have fun so go on and have fun with other classes if paladin is too farked up a class for you. We don't care and you wont be missed either. GOOD RIDDANCE I WOULD SAY.<P>Adieu Amigo<P>

But we still love the class! We're the holy warriors, the defenders of all that is good and just. We play paladins for the romance, for the roleplaying possibilities, and because we love to do so.<P>Psychosimatic: OMG STFU you are stupid, how can you not agree with me? LOOK AT THE STATS MAN! You retard!<P>Psyshosimatic: Oh btw, we're now officially changind the topis of this thread to planar gear and high lvl raids and how pallies suck there too.

Pyscho reminds me of a guy named Dumar who used to post on the SK boards a few months back.<P>You see, there was a big debate about which races made for the best SK's. Dumar was absolutely convinced that the Troll Sk was the best possible choice. Exp penalty be damned! They were the best according to him. Anyone who dissagreed with him became the target for his personal attacks and "colorful" language. (he had a penchant for calling people ****ing idiots)<P>There were many people who politley dissagreed and pointed out the strengths of Dark Elf, Erudite, and Human SK's. But no, Trolls and ogres were the best.<P>You wanna know the only difference between Dumar and Psycho?<P>Dumar knew what he was talkin about.<P><P>------------------<BR>"A man who was once a devil?" <BR>"Is he above both?"

Hehehehe, awww poor babies, what is this complain about me day, lol. <P>You all say with right tactics paladins are a great class, BUT NOT ONCE, NEVER EVER, IN THE ENTIRE POST HAVE YOU EVER MENTIONED WHAT THESE TACTICS ARE. now is it just me, or it seems that either no one knows these tactics OR they dont exist.<P>SO based on what i have seen from these posts lot of 45 and lower people post, exactly the ages that dont have the major kick back, we still have little problems but over all, paladins are fine, they dont do as much damage but it's not a huge problem, not sure if the new healign stuff matters to us at all, but it's 46 and up that are the major problems, paladins are called a pickup class on fear and other raids, or basically it means, were there to pick up no drop pally only items so they dont go to waste, what purpose do we have on raids? we sit there and hit the thing a little,  maybe sit back and heal the other tanks, i cant think of anything really usful that we do, now instead of all of you saying the i constantly turn all your pathetic little stories down, tell me why im wrong, dont say " you just complain and dont know how to play pallies" or " class envy just go play a druid" or the more popular " you just turn everyone down and dont listen" <P>Has it crossed your minds that none of you have yet to mention anything useful? what do you want me to do, all of a sudden just STOP and say " Holy jesus your all right i've been so stupid based on all the arguments and differnt opinions i have recieved i MUST be wrong, even though they hold no based or actualy content..."<P>No sorry not going to happen, so in the next posts, get over your little complexes and tell me of these " Oh so sacred tactics " that everyone cripes about.<P><P>------------------<BR>-PsychoSimatic-<BR>-Garethec Azzenblade-<BR>-Bertoxxulous-

The basics man, the basics and a bit of common sense is all you need to play a paladin.<P>The fact that you ask suggests that you don't know them. This would be in agreement with your dissatisfaction with paladins in general - after all, if you're unable to play them, then you won't like them.<P>Well, let me try and help ;-)<P>You're a tank, so act like one. You can pull with spells and/or a bow, so call out your targets and when your casters are ready, pull. You can tank better or as well as any puller, so just keep the mob agroed on you. Monitor the pull, if any casters are getting pounded taunt the mob off - as a pally, you can outtaunt most tanks (except maybe the sk) by simply chain stunning the mob. Even if the mob is unstunnable, the spells will work to get it worked up at you. If a vital group member is getting pounded, you do what any paladin worth his salt would do and LoH on him. Never, ever use LoH on yourself in a group unless you're the main tank and your death means the death of everyone else.<P>What else can we put in here for you to understand the paladin? Play intelligently, always monitor the group health bars. If someone else is main tank and they're getting pounded, heal them in between your swings, so the mob attacks you or if not, so the main tank doesn't die (even your small heals heal a little in a fight).<P>As a paladin your job is also to cut downtime. You'll usually have spare mana, and the cleric will be busy in between fights medding. That's when you heal the party (if someone's at 70-80% health the cleric should med it out while YOU get everyone back to their full strenght). Your main tanks, usually including you, will need to have the best buffs up, but you should be sure to keep your enchanter/wiz/cleric etc. buffed with your buffs. They're not the best, but they'll always help if a pull goes bad, and since those people usually don't get buffed because they don't (usually) need it, they'll appreciate your help in that respect.<P>The basics man, the basics and a little goodwill, coupled with some intelligent decision maiking, will make you a good paladin.<P>Unless, of course, you'd rather sit there and *****.

Psycho, if you want to do damage, do a pure melee-<BR>This is my view of a paladin.<BR>We are a defensive tank.  "As clerics are the light hand of healing, so are paladins the stalwart shield of justice."  Our AC is second ONLY to Warriors, being 75% warrior, 25% healer.  Case in point- Kruegen (find a ranger with better AC than him- that's without a shield btw) AND our HP is second only to a warriors.  With mobs doing 500 damage a round quad attacking such as Yelinak, Monks and Rogues don't stand very long before they're pureed.<BR>On that note, I'm surprised so many paladins nowadays insist on using 2hslash.  If they have a fiery defender, I can see it, but, that's NOT as common as you're making it out to be.  It's advantage is that it procs a stun AND allows you to bash.  The more common combination that you see much more often is a Sarnak Battle Shield and Sword of Morning- procs 50dd stun, and allows him to bash, WITH better AC I might add.  Or if they're lucky- a rod of faith (25:32) and The Qeynos Shield (75AC- artifact  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"><BR>Your job as a paladin is a stunner, not a damage dealer.  At any time you should have Holy Might and your lvl 30 stun loaded for a long period of time, and hopefully two DW bracers. (I cycle all these, it's a great way of keeping mobs pissed off at the right people.)<BR>If you don't like your class, go play an alt.  We'll all thank you for it <BR>-------------------------------------<BR>Lydirn Whiteheart<BR>Cavalier- Ayonae Ro

Psycho,<P>You're somewhat correct about our role on planes raids. We aren't as useful as the core classes (war, cle, enc, rog, mnk), but we do come in handy. More handy than a ranger could ever be.<P>1.) THE TANK<BR>Our AC and HP puts us up there with warriors for tanking mobs (speaking strictly of PoF, PoH, and PoA, as I wouldn't go killing stuff in PoG and PoM is out of my reach). The HUGE difference between a warrior tanking and a Paladin tanking is the damage that they do allows them to keep the mob taunted and agroed. We would have a hard time doing so if we depended solely on our melee capabilities. THIS is where our casting comes into play. Stuns taunt better than a warrior dishing out 5 times more damage than us. Hell, monks out-taunt warriors without even having the skill. No monk (within 3 lvls of me) can out-taunt me after having stunned a mob 4 times or so. On page 4 of my hotkeys (my offensive page) I have a taunt button in position 1, 3 stun spells, and DW bracer in the next 4 slots.<P>Don't get me wrong, we CANNOT out-tank warriors by any means. But we are not as far away as you think, and we aren't nearly as far away as rangers. And by the way, you would be hard-pressed to find a warrior that wants to spend hours going to your plane (Fear) to tank for you. He has very little to benefit from it in the ways of exp/loot. Most of the fear raids that I've been on had a Paladin as the main tank. Sad but true.<P>2.) THE NUKER/DMG DEALER<BR>So let's say that in a planes raid, you are A_Paladin_05 who is just there to roll on your lucky Valo Bracer or Trueheart Shield. Let's say the raid already has a primary, secondary, and hell even a tertiary tank. How can you make yourself useful? Easy: carry your weight. Think of it this way-If there are 30 people on the raid, then your combined output should be either doing 1/30th of the dmg to each mob, or healing up to 1/30th of the hp's lost on the raid (primarily, but not limited to, your group). Here's the general guideline I use. If the pull is undead, I will nuke and attack so hard and so fast that our group almost always gets the exp. On 4-group raids, by the time an unead mob is dead, I can have unloaded around 5 nukes at 162 dd to each PLUS my lowly melee damage. This puts me up to wizzie lvl in damage dealing (1500 or so damage to a mob: 2 or 3 mana efficient wizzie spells). Put 2 paladins in a group and they get exp on every undead mob. Provided they have clarity.<P>3.) THE HEALER/DMG DEALER<BR>If the mob is not undead, target it, attack and regen mana. After the fight click on casters to see how their health bar is doing. If they need a heal, throw them one. God knows the cleric in their group isn't gonna do it. <P>The idea here is that there is ALWAYS something to do on a raid, but most of the minor stuff gets shrugged off by others who say 'I'll just let someone else who is better suited do it.'<BR>_____________________________<P>Now some info about DW armor. This stuff DOES NOT suck. I agree that the effects on DW armor suck (except maybe the helm and bracer), but you don't wear that stuff for it's effects. Trust me, point for point AC will make you more of a viable tank than strenght. You ARE NOT a damage dealer as you well know. You are a damage absorber. <P>The paladin that tells you he is unhappy with his class will be the same paladin that has mith arms, legs, bp, and all the str gear he could get his hands on, wielding a high dmg sword with FBSS. At high levels, this paladin is a snack for most mobs. The longer you can tank a mob at 45+, the sooner the real damage dealers can bring him down. Therefore, Deepwater Armor is the best gear a paladin can hope to have, except maybe some of the new uber-velious stuff. <P>There is a general rule in everquest that many tanks swear by: AC is KING - Stats are for Casters! I cannot begin to explain how important this is. Your number one numerical concern should be your AC. My strength floats around 130 140 with mediocre stat armor, but my AC reaches 1000 at lvl 52 with a good shield, the best cleric buffs, and yaulp. I'm not saying that mobs can't touch me, but I am saying that with 200 less AC I would be mincemeat in Sebilis, a zone where I often find myself the primary tank.<P>A warrior tanking at any time/place=optimum.<P>A paladin tanking in Sebilis/Karnors/Chardok =viable alternative to warrior<P>A ranger tanking in any of these zones=dead group<P>A monk tanking in any of these zones=dead enchanter/dead cleric=dead group<P>Braxter Atishbazi<BR>52 Paladin<BR>Veeshan

Thank you, see that was a helpful post. Not just a complaining little sissy post. <P>I love when i get to beat on undead stuff hehehe, on of the few joys i get, that's when i can outdamage any other tank class. but how much undead stuff is in fear???<P>Now for DW i never said it "SUCKED" i just said the effects are a little lacking, love the AC, oh and can you chain cast with bracers?? you people act like you can, i never had em so i never could try.<P>So we are usful in groups, so why do all these crack head druids say were not? little freaks. Yeh funk them, feel a little better knowing this. You have soothed my worries on what i have coming to me, still quirks me a little that we get shunned from groups though.<P>And people constantly ***** about our res, saying it has no use since at higher lvl's you always have a cleric handy, ( still think a 90% res is prefectly fine and they can go shove it)<P>But i still have one last bone to pick, what about shadow knights? you never hear anything about them, dont they have the same defense and hp as us, yet no one ever mentions them as a tank? oh yeh, and what the heck is going on with all the agro/healing stuff????<P><P>------------------<BR>-PsychoSimatic-<BR>-Garethec Azzenblade-<BR>-Bertoxxulous-

LoL calm down, you're acting like a kid in a candy store =D. Ok I'll answer all of those questions to the best of my abilities.<P>>but how much undead stuff is in fear???<P>I'd say about 1/5th or maybe less of fear is undead. The mobs that drop Valorium, Fetid Fiends(male ones only) are large scaled zombies. Bout 15 feet tall I'd say. Man you should see me when the puller shouts INCOMING a fetid fiend TO CAMP. hehe. You know that message you get when you try to cast a spell but the spellgem hasn't come back on yet? You have not recovered yet. I spam myself witht that thing  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/wink.gif">.<P>>oh and can you chain cast with bracers?? <P>Unfortunately no. The casting time is way too slow. I cycle it into my spells when a mob needs to be chain stunned. As soon as my longer lasting stun hits I have to hit the bracer so that it casts right after the stun wears off. Not a good way to deal damage at all, since it's like 3 seconds of not attacking =(. But, hey it has an AC of 16.<P>>So we are usful in groups, so why do all these crack head druids say were not? <P>Multiple reasons. First, is that some myths are hard to break. Yeah we did used to suck up exp from everyone else, but that has changed and the dr00ds have been too busy soloing to notice. Second, people don't realize what you bring to the group. Most players only care about numbers. How much damage you deal reflects your worth to them. They don't realize that keeping a mob stunned throughout the entire battle takes slack off the chanter/cleric. Healing them after the battle doesn't give them confidence in you. Seeing the message a_caster_mob_02's spell has been interrupted doesn't tell them of your worth. And try telling a druid in your Fear group that the reason he got exp off that fetid fiend was because you were nuking. He'd laugh in your face. It HAD to be his nukes that did it. Oh well, I don't mind so much.<P>>And people constantly ***** about our res, saying it has no use since at higher lvl's you always have a cleric handy, ( still think a 90% res is prefectly fine and they can go shove it)<P>Well they're kind of right. The difference between a 96% rez and a 90% rez is a great deal at high lvls. About an hour of playing time at lvl 59 (which along with 54, is a true hell). So even at lvl 59, when I get my new rez spell, I'll still be looking for lvl 56 clerics. But at the same time, 90% of the exp lost is A LOT OF ****ING EXP, no matter what lvl you are. Enough for people to care about it, heh.<P>But i still have one last bone to pick, what about shadow knights? you never hear anything about them, dont they have the same defense and hp as us, yet no one ever mentions them as a tank? <P>The reason that no one ever talks about them also multifaceted. First, there aren't NEARLY as many sk's as there are pallies. They kinda get brushed to the side mostly. But although I know very little about the class, one of my best friends in the game has a lvl 52 sk that I group with a whole helluva lot. Yeah they do have the same Defense as us, and are usually a bit stronger cuz they get to be the big races. But they don't taunt as well as we do with their spells (not sure if this is true, just basing it on my personal experience. I know that dots really piss mobs off so I guess an SK could taunt as well as we could theoretically. I've just never seen it done). <P>There was a poll done by VI once about what is the class that you look for in a group or something like that and sk's got dead last. So abashi (I think it was abashi) talked about it in a thread. His main point was that since there aren't that many sk's, nobody gets to see their worth, so nobody thinks about inviting them into a group. It was up to them to go out and show ppl what they're made of, blah blah blah. Although I agreed with him on it, I do think that he was kinda glossing over the fact that sk's needed some real fixing. They have made out well I think, and us hybrids are still in the same boat, virtually.<P>>oh yeh, and what the heck is going on with all the agro/healing stuff????<P>Now this one is a tall order. Everyone has their say in this, but I'm gonna give you my version. It's very opinionated so beware.<P>It starts with Verant wanting to ensure that people keep subscribing to EQ, that people don't feel like they have won the game, that people keep trying at the same thing over and over until they succeed. The cleric class seemed to work against this desire. They made things that were virtually impossible easily doable, if you knew what you were doing. The spell Complete Healing made clerics too powerful. It could heal well over 3k hp, making it MUCH more mana efficient than its predecessor, superior healing. This is the spell that allowed FoH to clear Veeshan's Peak. It's like football: you can have the best offense in the game, but you can't go anywhere without a defense (St. Louis Rams circa 2000). So Verant nerfed the hell outa that spell.<P>First they did it to the Donal's Breastplate. It used to allow a cleric to keep casting CH using no mana. It was way too uber. Abashi summed it up: A cleric and a warrior could take out any mob in the game with this item as long as the mob couldn't kill the warrior before the recast time of the bp was up. The warrior would never die. <P>So they nerfed it. Now, they can only cast it on a player once every 7 mins. It works like a buff. You cast it and a buff icon shows up on the character which cannot be dispelled or replaced. Note they can cast it on multiple players in that 7 mins, but not the same person.<P>This completely changes the tactics needed to do uber-raids. No longer can Furor tank a mob that takes a bub of his health with every hit for an entire battle and not worry about the clerics running out of mana. But there was still the actual spell to deal with.<P>The next thing they did was examine the spell itself. They couldn't just get rid of it completely since that would be a logistical nightmare. And they couldn't change its healing/mana ratio for the same reason. But one thing they COULD do to lessen its power drastically is make it to where mobs got REALLY pissed off when the cleric casted it. So they raised the agro on the spell. Every mob has a hate list that they keep as a part of their AI programming. All spells cast within agro range of the mob add an amount of agro to the player that casts it (this is why enchanters get beat down so much when mez breaks) CH used to add to the list but nothing that couldn't be done away with using taunt and just damaging the monster. So they nerfed it. They raised the amount of agro due to CH so much that now it seems that every time the cleric casts CH the mob jumps on him. Cleric dies, the rest of the group dies, or even the rest of the raid party. This pissed off a lot of people, and in my opinion it is the main reason why furor is quitting EQ.<P>So that's my version of how things happened. But speaking again from personal experience, CH hasn't changed all that much. I don't see mobs instantly jumping on the cleric for every cast of CH in my groups. And the hate that it does add can be circumnavigated. All you need are new tactics. All mobs are now rooted prior to engagement so that they don't have a chance to go over and whail on the cleric. I haven't been to any Veeshan's Peak raids so I can't speak for the uber raiders.<P>Anyway, hope some of this info helped. G/L with your paladin bro, I'm sure he'll make a fine knight someday.<P>-Braxter<BR>

baxter cleared up a lot if questions, so thanks to him, but I have one really pressing question that I think probably hasn't really be asked since the first page of this post: What are the core issues that make people claim (and I don't disagree) that paladins and sk's are falling behind.  One person make a really long, neat list with a good bit of detail about each one.  Honestly, argueing about one issue after tanother doesn't grab much attention, 'cause it's too much to read.  Mabye if psycosimantic still checks on this he could say something.  Comment on the list.  Proofread the list.  And for God's sake, include examples.  Don't say that the Fiery Defender suck's compare to so-and-so-epic, tell about the time when you dueled the guy with it and he kicked your @$$.  We can actually get things fixed if we compare our shortcommings and come up with 1 or 2 things that could be done to fix everything.  Psycosemantic, please respond.

Thanks Baxter, and hey All star "I dont have one yet" what are you slow? you sound like ya think i never respond back to my own posts, look at the damned thing im the one doing most of the talking (excluding that big momma of a post baxter tossed up)<P>And yes i dislike our epic, mainly because of the graphics, same graphics on all our holy swords, fire on a stick wow.... some one responded to this saying there was no sword just flames and a special hilt, ohhhhhh WHOOPDY FUKING DOO, i wanta  sword not  a hilt, now thanks to you, you reminded me that i still have some b1itching to do, WE DONT HAVE ENOUGH HOLY SWORDS, were supposed to be the holy sword class of the game right? best weps out there, all gun hoo on that stuff, am i right ? well hmm soulfire firey avenger and firey defender....3........hmmmmmmmmm.<P>Lists falls a LITTLE FUKIGN SHORT OF WHAT I HAD IN MIND, and dont go rattling off some weapons that mobs drop in kunark or velious, those arent holy weapons, i think they should revamp this system entirely, soulfire is out dated, and a real shame, who wants the firey avenger? no one, just get the defender, i dont like the idea of "upgrading" your sword, sure it adds alot of work to quests, and doesnt put your old sword to waste, but the fact that in a sense the sword you had is the same you had, right?<P>Now what was your little questions >I dont have one yet<? ahhh yes, that we dont make a nice and tidy list format of everything we talk about...<P>maybe because we tackle one at a time and move on?<P>but ill try and help you on this since i can see your plight.<P>1) Holy weapons<P>2) Epics<P>3) Armor<P>4) tree humping rangers<P>5) crack head druids<P>6) Healing problems<P>7) line of smite spells dont come early enough<P>8) i hate the human helms more than anything....<P><BR>that's about the order i look at stuff<P>hehehehe, i broke 100 posts...... hehehehe<BR>thanks ya'll (no im not from down south) hmmm should i shoot for 200 now or just make a new one??<P><P>------------------<BR>-PsychoSimatic-<BR>-Garethec Azzenblade-<BR>-Bertoxxulous-

hehe wow this topic has generated more responces and interest than probly more than any ive seen so far so i cant not post something to such a display.First off here is my experience for the topic.<BR>Mohegadan Mandragoran<BR>53 Paly of Mithaniel Marr<BR>server Mithaniel Marr hehe<BR>Guildless at the moment<BR>Now i think many questions were raised some answered and most younger entries not answered so i will give the life of a paly <BR>to those that really have interest in this class(aka patch day and im really bored)<BR>First many palys starting now or recently after the changes made to the class havent seen what were many problems over the last year plus in the life of the paly. First was the exp ,being the almighty factor in grouping and so forth running hand in hand in importance with loot), was a huge issue to hybrids in general. now that there is no penalty for the hyrbrid or the group it has helped some for newer players though the old guard seem highly unable to change their minds on that fact. not sure if they just dont read patch messages or what . anyways you as newer palys have to contend with ather things now instead of that so atleast there your a step ahead of many old disgruntled of our class. second 1 through 30 as lvls is not really much difference than with other classes depending on the amount of tweeking. as a general rule everyone is pretty par with others in groups<BR>other than maybe rangers have little vantage in areas where tracking is essential which may or may not be your experience. now lvls 30 - 40 is where you begin to really see the differences in melee classes though not to any huge extent as of yet. palys get greater healing during this time and rangers get sow and sks have a few more dot spells. ac is still pretty close though now hps begin to tell the tale more than ac here. war and sks due to the large race factor and minor race regen begin their ascension in raid and group usefullness though at these lvls its more pratice than actually the real thing. palys hps due to the race differences begin to fall short but buff spells and some good healing for that lvl allow pairs and 3 man groups with no clerics for the most part. agian tweeking changes many of these factors.<BR>and as for tanking ability were still righ in it with the other 2 , with rangers now being very nice damage doers with sow and snare to make druids not needed if you cant get one away from quad kiting) rock on druids hehe i think we all wish we could do that). now the real argument begins post 40 for the fact that you should now be preparing for and practicing for raids in small group excursions and couple group raids of certian areas aka com places like that tt and so forth. also here is where palys skills begin capping out till post 50 so as you go farther into the 40s you really begin to see the difference between classes. now are spells are still at this point in the usefull range but due to the huge mob power difference that begins to tailor off because pure healers becaome more and more needed.Especially post 46. now up to this point as a paly finding groups and partnering should have been pretty easy if you get along with people and also because your most of time fighting with newer people like yourselves. so worring about what life is like up to that time i say simply dont your like any other class and should be able to have fun group and do things you want . plus palys probable have the most and best quests up to that lvl to keep you busy when questing is your thing. Believe me i know ive done most of them up to there).k here though is where the true problem then begins 46 to 60 but basicaly 50 to 60.<BR>   over the past months several changes have been done by verant to appease many classes the first of which was the ubber weapons. now for the newer palys this stemed from a long argument over the palys getting FA and war weapons that dealt as much or more damage being removed from game or put in places very few were in big enough guilds to attain. so verant in its wisdom decided after long debates over who should get FA type weapons decides all classes should have a weapon to push their abilities beyond the norm which in my opinion was great . i thought all classes should be able to show greatness in their special ways and also have items to set them above others of their class for doing all the quest work. remember pals are and should be quest veterans post 46 due to all the quests we get so a new one for use should have been no big deal. K after the patch there was a scramble for these items at a rate i dont think even verant expected. hehe i even think many slept less thn war time veterans during the initial shock of ubber!!) hehe a term that now has probly more meaning than any other term in eq today, but ill get into that later).Now if memory serves me right i believe the bards and druids ubber were posted first and of course the stats alone on both got everyones attention very quickly anticipating their own . i think the rogues was next and most just went oh my guess roges finaly get some justice for all their lack of attention over past many lvls. their ubber was quite nice and the effect you can only say wow when it works,not sure percentages on that rogues so i wont comment on that. anyways the next post i think noone was prepared for, The Cleric's ubber. The shock , i know i was , was more than probably anyone expected,including verant probably. The stats were wowish right off the bat but were hugely over shadowed by the fact of infinate, manaless 56 lvl 96% reses. What can you say but oh my. well thats exactly what the larger guild leaders said as they invisioned large VP or lower dungeon type raids with even 1 cleric or heavan forbid several clerics with this thing. wipe outs before took ours of painfull orginization with ussualy the raid ending prematurely after cr's were done . now wipeouts could be fixed as fast as you could get the corpses back.And shortly after the the lemming raid method was introduced but thats a whole nother story. anyways at that point there were a flury of posts about the other class epics and once agian a stunning response was felt over the chanters epic. Stats agian great but the effect though not quite as astounding as clerics was wowish all the same. manaless speed of shissar, one of their best haste spells now cost them nothing and became every melee classes dream to have in a group to strut their stuff and make many nearly impossible raids attainable for now the damage output was tremendous for any raid with one of these bad boys behind it.Now by the end of of all the uber weapon posts verant faced a new argument . many felt their weapons did not match with the 1:cleric 2: enchanter 3: rogue 4:monk in ability . warriors alone were upset for their weapon though huge in damage delay ratio were not happy with stats and effect with their quest being nothing to envy in its difficulty in doing . Some changes were made though eventually and things settled down for most part but mages and wizards still had a valid argument on the enormous rareity of their epics and the mobs they faced. once agian i agreed and this argument is still going as far as i know. <BR> Now the above is related to let you know and understand the inherant problems that high lvl palys face. first epics changed the whole aspect and class balancing of the game.<BR>People felt right off clerics epics were a must along with chanters though 1 or 2 chanters with their epic per raid was felt to be good while as many clerics as possible were wanted with their epics. along with the chanters epics came the new need to start triing to get the damage doers their epics aka monks rogues rangers and if all possibly warriors though once agian theirs seemed the harder of the 4 to get.Now in getting their epic weapons besides the stats boost that was so wanted for most of the kunark seb/karnors armor was all ac and effect the damage out put of these 4 when paired with a manaless 60+% haste effect could be,well devastating, especially with duel wield, all these classes getting duel wield as well. The sk's had an initial beef that their weapons were way sub par then after their effect was upgraded slowly began to say hehe i love being an sk. their epic of today has earned them alot of respect in the damage doer category along with rangers. so slowly they have begun to become a priority in raids along with all the other classes that have been mentioned above.Now to link all this with post 50 and what you face).<BR>  Post 50 for palys is one of fun but flustration so be prepared.Warriors are the main stay for any raids or most high lvl groups.Monks are the main pullers and damage doers in most situations(hehe they swing so much i dont see how they dont get tired). rangers have developed from the need for track, damage and snare,for some reason its still hard as heck to get druids to stop quad kitting hehe).Rogues usefullness has grown as each new expansion and dungeon requires rogues to progress and also their damage is arguably better than monks.Sks's damage and hps are not that much lower than warriors though not the same arguably very close,and many of their spells are seen to be very usefull in many situations though that is often argued by them. now palys are set for defense and supporting role in casting with some but limited damage output.now this is probably where most will begin to argue with me or say play another class but its you other classes who tell us this and refuse manytimes to include us in raids groups or especially epic hunts.The paly that started this post had some idea of what he was saying though it was a very bad way of saying it i think because he listened to what other paly's and classes said about us. and unlike that said person i will give examples of what im saying.<BR>Lets start with another average day in seb, say the crypt area(aka pla). down there mistakes made ussualy mean wipeout and a long cr process if no necro or sk( more vauluable for that one)to summon corpse. so you build a group like this war,cleric,chanter,rogue,wizzard,paly just because hehe this is about palys and you head down. now lets identify each classes role. War is main tank given. Cleric is main healer given.Chanter is crowd control,managiver,slower,tash(how do they keep their mana up).rogue gets you down there<BR>,damage doer.wizzard snares,damage doer,evac,stunner.And then we have paly whats he there for.well its definately not damage doer and his hps are alot farther behind war by now so he can take damage for a time but the cleric will be oom in no time if he takes it all,he chain stuns now with 3 stunn spells which is great but if hes bulked on ac armor to do tank job his wisdom is sorely lacking and so your mana pool is always down which means your medding more than fighting or your keeping the rest slowed because they are waiting on you to get mana back. paly's cant fight and med at same time,something most other classes seem to forget very quickly.but in this case we say that things are going well the palys can stunn freely with c2 and still keep mana above 60 while tanking tuanting off casters and still keep pace. quite alot for us palys to do . definately keeps you attentive as a paly.then lets say as your fighting a crypt guardian that complete heals no biggie you deal with that now alot you get a add another guardian. chanter says no prob hes meditating on his inner life in general instead of beating all you down. so your still on said guardian then a undead smelly froggy comes in and sayes hey your blood smells good feed me so he attacks and chanter says no prob this ones contemplating why he should eat somewhere else. well during that mezz breaks enough that he has to keep eye on them,which is ussualy the case and of course the chanter is prime on their hate list so hes now stunning to get mezz off instead of getting interupted alond with the paly begining to see problems groing so hes rooting if possible,not unless tash is in, stunning works better than root if no tash but not more than 50 percent of time and tuanting the mobs off chanters as possible so he can regain his hold on the crowd. now ofcourse during all this everyone is hurting some along with war so cleric has had to push the spells up to group effect taking more mana than ching one target so his mana is depleting quickly,hes having to start asking for assistance so agian paly startes healing when he can inbetween kepping mobs off casters,dealing damage to said original guardian,and keeping mana for stuns or mobs ch making the situation hopeless.at this time the words every group dreads when hearing happens LOM. all the casters by this point are starting to exaust their large mana pulls after a kill or 2 besides the mobs you are facing now and saying you finaly kill original guardian by then because normaly there is atleast another romer from otherside of crypt comes walking in and now you have replaced one for another. this is not a rare circumstance its quite regular there and many other places. so worries begin to start but everything is tenable because war cleric chanter are still up and kicking . now after the last mez the war though taking most of damage from the add is still up but needs healing s cleric casts then says ive got one more left then oom. chanter says 20 because hes concentrating on mezzing and stunning to stay alive and his mana even is going quickly so tashing is out. wizzards are triing spells that resist less but are not near s damaging to compensate for chanter not tashing.rogues is triing to deal most of damage without getting the mobs attention because the cleric needs to med badly.nowas your killing the next mob mez breaks and chanter is stormed agian paly once agian is called to action there to save chanter but now his mana is at 50 at most probly much lower by now cleric heals chanter to keep him up probly because hes taking alot more damage now being that prob atleast 1 of the mobs that breaks mez isnt slowed . remember chanter is lom conserving mana for mez.now the cleric having to heal chanter is oom and the war hps are decreasing regularly with no chance of healing anytime soon. cleric shouts paly loh war so the act that so often is said to be apreciated but rarely is in my experiences happens . said paly loh's war and buys cleric 20 more seconds for a ch maybe more depending on how much beating the war is taken . now by now prob said second guardian is down and probably another mob is half way so chanter has time to med longer than 20 sec before remezzing and slowly we say that things are getting better the worst is over and more mana for tashing and slowing alow the wizzard to boom boom the way they love to and stunns to work most of time so palys and wizzards are keeping the casting to a minimum from the leftover mobs. and after a long drawn out fight everyone says great job the chanter says next time we kill frogys first and ill mez the guardians which everyone nods at the wisdom at that and cleric says wtg paly you save the war so the paly feels good about him self. now to make the whole action more realistic lets consider the new hate accrueing of the clerics and how that much healing would have got their hate sky high and also figure into the fact that unless your just breaking inot pla then most probably that combat began probably at 60+ mana for casters and paly because he cant med and fight same time was probably around the same if not less. could it have been done even saying you did things right and killed the frogys first and mezzed the guardians. the answer is yes and it has happened quite often with me and my groups in many highlvl places and ussualy after that said group i send same people a tell that are on for another group and their ready to go along because they liked the fact that palys are great for doomsday circumstances and when everything is going well you dont need another great damage doer along so having the extra insurance of a paly<BR>along for those kinda of pulls or camps that go bad is great . but the problem is not many<BR>feel that way till their in those circumstances atleast a few times for a paly to bail them out. most feel the situation will nvr get that bad if you have a monk or ranger or shaman or any other class that can benefit the group as a hole all the time and put out enough damage to kill the mobs alot quicker than with a paladin so paladins are faced with proving a viable place in groups to everyone they meet for most part. this is not complaining it is a chalenge you face as a paly when you play one, for most otehr classes abilities are evident all the time where as palys are circumstancial for the most part.now lets link this with the epic weapons( said weapons that are meant to enhance the ability of that characters special contribution to a party and then the whole picture comes into view and its why you see very few hey lets get are palys epic because it will help us as a whole. our epic gives us more damge and still alows us to bash as if we wielded shield but were still not movers and shakers in the damage world so its great effect in the paly needs to help us is nonexistant so when palys get its ussualy because for status or noone is ready for theirs quite yet or and why not get his kind of thing so hes happy. which leads us to raids. there are so many people on raids they ussually either work or they dont. the paly's use in the small group doomsday kind of thing is nonexistant. their stuns and spells wont work on the mobs you face in those kinda raids, are damage is so far below the other melee were not really wanted in place of another class that can help so much more agianst this big mofo and are loh is a one time shot for healing which means after were reduced to using gh's till 57 then sup heal which helps alot but still not good enough compared with casting time and the amount of damage the mobs then hit for.<BR>so now i hear you saying what are palys good for in said raids or with their epics palys do great damage look at the weapon's stats.i will answer the second part first. for some unknown reason we palys have great weapon stats but even with them we ussualy miss more than we hit and our damage minimum is ussualy pretty low and we hit for minimum alot more than maximum damage for weapon. so when its all figured up are damage even with a great stats isnt very good at all. second are bash skill maxes pretty low so we dont connect with bash very often even at high lvls making it not a very usefull skill agianst big mobs. third we have to try to keep our other stats up do to casting and weapon procs to help some in those departments so we cant just str stm just to have close on hps and attack rating war have.so as far as what good are they in large raids well thats a question most ask and answer them selves by saying not ussualy worth it get another class. that is what you face as palys post 50 and what for some reason the same people who say i love palys in my group of which seemed 90 percent in these almost 100 posts sayed say the axaxt opposite when their in game and doing a raid in game say plane of air or dragon necropolis or high lvl dungeaons that require quite a little army to go into. many of them are the first to say no we need another class . that is not to say everyone of the positive palys posts here are just saying it here and all of them are not allowing palys into raids . but when you are on and try and get into these raids at even 55 + most of the time unless they just need bodies the answer is no and thats just not my experiences on it its many palys. now as a 53 paly i cant expect to go to places like that but in the places other around 53 people go for raids thats the same answer ig et to so its not just because hey your 53 what do you expect. this as a whole is what verant needs to change . to give us some use not nessarilly damage but something to make us stand out as helpfull on raids. i posted something before int the palys section of balancing whci i will cut and paste now so you can see my ideas and comment your self onw aht you think.<BR>I THINK AS PLAYERS WE SEE WHERE OUR PROBLEMS AS PALYS ARISE FOR RAIDS AND KEEPING CLASS BALANCE BUT MAKING OUR CLASS VERY RESPECTABLE ON RAIDS. SO FAR THE CHANGES MADE HAVE BEEN GOOD AND BROUGHT US CLOSE BUT WE ARE STILL LACKING ON DAMAGE OR SOMETHING OTHER THAT MAKES US STAND OUT AND OTHERS TO APRECIATE IN GROUPS OR RAIDS. NOW THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU DO THIS WITHOUT TICKING OFF EVERY WARRIOR IN NORRATH . I SAY WITH 2 IMPROVEMENTS 1 FOR WAR 1 FOR PALY . THE WAR IS SIMPLE SO ILL EXPLAIN THAT FIRST .<BR>I HAVE THROUGH EXPERIENCE SEEN IN OTHER ROLEPLAYING GAMES WHETHER PC OR DICE THAT WHAT SETS THE WAR CLASS APPART IS HIS EXPERT USE OF MANY WEAPONS AND EXTROIDANARY USE OF 1 PATICULAR TYPE . THAT IS WHAT I RECOMEND FIRST ADD A SKILL FOR THEM SIMILAR TO SPELL SCHOOL MASTERY ACCEPT MAKE IT WEAPON MASTERY LONG SWORD , BATTLE AXE , BASTARD SWORD AND SO FORTH . WITH THOSE TYPES OF WEAPONS EQUIPED GIVE WAR A GREATER DAMAGE MARGIN, HIGHER MIN DAMAGE , AND GREATER CHANCE FOR CRIT HITS WITH THE HITS BEING ACTUALY WORTH SOMETHING NOT JUST HIGH END NORMAL HITS .IF YOU MAKE IT A ONETIME ONE CATEGORY CHOICE STARTING AT A CERTIAN LVL LIKE 45 THEN IT WILL GIVE EACH INDIVIDUAL WARRIOR SOME CUSTOMIZING AND STILL GIVE THEM SOME ADVANTAGE BUT TEMPERED WITH SOME LIMIT . SOMETHING ALONG THAT LINE WOULD MAKE THEM VERY HAPPY IM SURE . NOW PALYS WOULD BE SOLVED BY ADDING GREAT ABILITIES WHILE WIELDING A HOLY SWORD . SIMILAR TO TSR'S IDEA GIVE US GREATER DAMAGE AGIANST EVIL CREATURES , HIGH MAGIC RESISTANCE TO MOBS OUR LVL AND LOWER AND A AURA OF GOODNESS/POWER WITH SOME PROTECTION FOR US AND THOSE CLOSE BY WHILE HINDERING THE ENEMY A LITTLE . THIS SHOULD BE WHILE WIELDING ANY HOLY SWORD OR SOME EFFECTS ALONG THOSE LINES TEMPERED WITH GREATER AGRO RADIUS BECAUSE OUR AURA AND GREATER HATE FROM MOBS . THAT AND WITH THE PATICULAR SWORDS AFFECT WOULD BE GREAT TO MAKE US SPECIAL IN RAIDS AND GROUPS . NOW THESE 2 IDEAS ARE NO MEANS THE ANSWER OUT RIGHT BUT IT IS A POSITIVE DIRECTION FOR VERANT TO WORK FROM IN GIVING BALANCE. PS SKS COULD BE SIMILAR IN NATURE AS PALYS JUST OPPOSITE LIKE ANTI PALADINS . HOPE YOU ALL LIKE THE IDEA AND THANKS FOR TIME . FRIENDLY NEIGHBORHOOD PALY MOHE<BR>and follow up here)<BR>HEHE ITS ME AGIAN. SORRY WANTED TO BE MORE SPECIFIC ON THE IDEAS I HAD. FOR THE AURA OF GOODNESS/POWER GROUP STATS COULD IMPROVE LIKE THIS<BR>FOR COURAGE HPS 100 STR 20 ATTACK 20-30<BR>FOR THE BLESSING PART DEFENCE 20-30<BR>RESISTS 10-20 <BR>AND MAYBE NO SUMMONED MOBS WILL ATTACK GROUP IE PETS) TILL THEY ARE ATTACKED FIRST <BR>THOSE BONUSES MAY BE TO HIGH BUT JUST GIVING IDEA WHERE THE AURA COULD EFFECT AND IF STACKABLE WITH BARD SONGS AND SPELLS WOULD MAKE PALYS VERY NICE TO HAVE AROUND ESPECIALLY IN VEL AND LARGE RAIDS<BR>OK NOW THE WAR PART . I READ A WHILE BACK THAT WARRIORS WERE NOT HAPPY THAT ITS ONLY GOOD TO PLAY A TROLL OR OGRE OR BARBARIAN WAR. SO MY WEAPON MASTER CAN HELP FIX THAT TO<BR>. FOR EXAMPLE LONG SWORDS AND SHORT SWORDS ARE WEAPONS MASTERED AND DESIGNED BY AGILE AND DEXTROUS RACES . WHY NOT HAVE THE MASTER SKILL LVL OF THOSE 2 TYPES OF WEAPONS ALONG WITH PERSONS DEX AND AGILITY SCORED DECIDE THE BONUS IS PARRIING, REPOSTEING AND CRITICAL HITS CHANCES, AND BECASUE ELVEN BLADESONG WARRIORS ARE SO RENOUNED FOR THEIR DEADLY LONDSWORD USE(REMINDER JUST EXAMPLE OF WHAT YOU COULD DO AS BONUSES FOR ALL WEAPONS DEPENDING ON TYPYE AND ABILITY SCORES) THEIR DEFENCE AND ATTACK IS DECIDED BY DEX AND AGI INSTEAD OF STR OR MORE SO THAN STR . YOU COULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS FOR ALL THE WEAPON TYPES SO THAT ALL RACES MAY INHERETLY BE ALITTLE BETTER WITH CERTIAN WEAPONS . HEHE MAKES PLAYING A HALF ELF OR ELF WARRIOR GOOD TO) . ALSO I WOULD LOWER THE DELAY ALITTLE DEPENDING ON WPN MASTER SKILL LVL FOR THAT WEAPON SO THERE IS SOMETHING REALLY NEW TO BEING A WEAPON MASTER NOT JUST THE SAME OLD GREATER CHANCE OF CRITICAL HITS THAT MANY CANT SEE WHEN IN GAME HAPPENING . THATS ABOUT IT FOR EXPLAINING IDEA HEHE . IF YOU LIKE POST THIS ON VERANTS FORUM IF YOU CAN I CANT GET A POST ON THERE FOR SOME REASON . YOUR FRIENDLY NEIGHBORHOOD PALY AGIAN MOHE<P>now please if your not busy and feel like commenting on this extinsive narative please do so . i meant no jabs at anyone or any classes just some of my own personal feelings on this subject

Now that's a big mamma,<P>Thanks for the whole scenario, and it makes perfect sense and you made some extremely good points.<P>Exactly what im thinking, were below par but to raise pallies you need to raise warriors and Sk's also, we need some help we dont have a point on raids and in groups we help but we dont bring anything special to group.<P>Now in that scenario in pla, the paladin saves the day, well what if you dont have LOH? everyone dies and that's that, so in the end paladins are only useful every 72 minutes. and unless your on a 72 minute respawn well your out of luck. Now it may just be me, but my stuns get resisted alot, and even when im hititn max, it's not gonna be the save the day sort of thing, now in that previous group replace the pally with a monk ranger bard or rouge, well you dont need the LOH cause that things dead, war takes hits and does great damage with rouge your talking alot of damage, they do more than warriors and monks, (which many monks complain about) monks are also way way up there (sort of tied with rouges based on weps) rangers not far behind at all, they have real nice offensive spells, and dont tell me a 500 damage blast isnt good, because it's more than enough and by lvl 46 your gonna have the reluvant whip, just go on 1 or 2 hate raids and your gonna get it, ( i know i have ranger friend got his same day he hit 46) <P>Now im not saying that they need to jack paladins up with some insane instantaneous death weapon, just give us something UNIQUE that we bring to a group, something that tells people ohh lets take that paladin for so and so reason, every other class has one, rangers not as much as others but they get there point across little better than us. and that reminds me, on dragons raids, the main tank some times is a monk or ranger, doesnt matter everyone is beating on the thing, happened before on a naggy raid i was on (as druid friend), and in fear you'll always have a warrior, jsut because of the weapons that drop, they'll be there dont worry, your not gooing to have a paladins, not once ever have i seen a raid with a paladin as the main. maybe it's just me but that's my experince.<P>now i dont know what sititn in this forum and complaning will do but i sure hope something get's done about this...<P><P>------------------<BR>-PsychoSimatic-<BR>-Garethec Azzenblade-<BR>-Bertoxxulous-
