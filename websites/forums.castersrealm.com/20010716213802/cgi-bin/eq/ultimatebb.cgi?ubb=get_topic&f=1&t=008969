EverQuest 2 Features<P>Feature Level<BR>A feature&#8217;s level is defined in one of three tiers: system, feature, and detail.  A system would be like &#8216;advanced AI&#8217; or the &#8216;spell system&#8217;, a feature would be &#8216;continuous world&#8217;, and a detail would be &#8216;pack animal AI&#8217;.<P>Feature Priority<BR>A feature&#8217;s priority is defined in one of three tiers: essential, important, and frosting.  An essential feature is one such that were it missing it simply would not be the game being developed.  An important feature is one that defines the games characteristics, but were it to be removed the game&#8217;s foundation would still be intact, and frosting is a &#8216;gee that would be cool, but if it didn&#8217;t make it into the game, the game is still every bit as great.&#8217;<P><BR>AI System<P>NPC Scripting Language<BR>Level:  System<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>A scripting language for NPCs is really just an efficient and powerful tool for Game Designers to give directions and intelligence to NPCs.   This also ties in with the Object Oriented Database (see Database System) in that these scripts need to be part of the database, and a sub-class should be able to inherit scripts from parent class(es).<P><BR>Party Auto-Follow<BR>Auto-follow party leader ala text based MUDs<BR>Level:  Feature<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>Using the same or similar AI routines for NPC movement, a player will be able to give up movement control of his character by targeting another player and choosing to follow that player.<P>Hiring NPCs<BR>Level:  Feature<BR>Priority:  Frosting<BR>In addition to pets and familiars, players will be able to hire NPCs (for example, mercenaries, guards, etc). to perform tasks, including escort, guard duty of properties, etc.<P>Character States and Demeanors<BR>Level: Feature<BR>Priority:  Frosting<BR>A player will be able to choose a state or demeanor for his character.  For example, the player could choose a friendly demeanor, which would perhaps sheath his weapon and put a smile on his face.  This should be visible to other players AND processed by NPCs, affecting their reactions if appropriate.<P>Sophisticated NPC Spawning<BR>Level:  Feature<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>NPC Spawning should be triggered by a variety of world conditions, including environmental conditions, PC populations, time of day, season, using special items, etc.  This should also tie into the Quest System (meaning the completion and/or failure of quests could result in NPC spawns).<P><BR>NPC Behavioral Classes<BR>Level:  Detail<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>Part of the Object Oriented definition of an NPC should include a variety of inheritable behavioral classes.  For example, an animal NPC might possess pack behavior.<P>Advanced NPC Reactions<BR>Level:  Detail<BR>Priority:  Frosting<BR>NPCs will analyse another PC or NPC and evaluate reactions based on additional aspects, including items worn, demeanor, etc. <P>Advanced NPC Vendors<BR>Level:  Detail<BR>Priority:  Frosting<BR>NPC Merchants/Vendors will be divided into classes, each with different purchase preferences, varieties of wares, propensity to over/under charge, etc.<P>Character Engine<P>Modular Characters<BR>Level:  System<BR>Priority:  Essential<BR>Basic models with lots of attachment points for swapping / layering geometry for facial hair, hairdos, armor, gloves, boots, capes, hoods, sashes <P>Customizable Facial Features<BR>Level:  Detail<BR>Priority:  Essential<BR>During character creation, the player will be able to customize his character&#8217;s face by cycling through several facial combinations.  This involves both breaking the character&#8217;s head into additional polygons and also using texture layering.<P>Customizable Body Features<BR>Level:  Detail<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>During character creation, the player will be able to customize his character&#8217;s body by adjusting skin color, body size, and body shape.  This customization is limited by parameters dependent upon the race chosen.  For example, trolls are green.  The player may choose shades of green within certain parameters, but will be unable to change his troll&#8217;s skin color to brown.<P>Facial Expressions<BR>Level:  Detail<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>Using various emotes, players will not only be able to trigger animations, but also change the expression on their character&#8217;s face.  <P>Additional Social Animations/Emotes<BR>Level: Detail<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>The inclusion of a large set of animations dedicated to Emoticons and Socials will help community building and can be linked to the demeanor system.  Examples of emotes:  point, bow, surprise, shake hands, salute, hands on hips, hands crossed, laugh, dances, victory, weapons display, etc.<P>Content<P>Player Generated Content<BR>Level:  System<BR>Priority:  Essential<P>Larger World Size<BR>Level:  System<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>World consists of all five continents, Antonica, Kunark, Velious, and Faydwer.  A sixth continent of sorts will exist, and that will be the Underfoot, which is a huge subterranean world that lies underneath the Norrathean hemisphere.  We must keep in mind, however, that the scale still needs to be such that an exaggerated, fun environment exists and that by increasing the world size we face greater challenges in terms of filling it with game content as well as unique landmarks that identify one area over another. <P>Enhanced Encounter Table Placement Tools<BR>Level:  Detail<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>An enhanced tool, preferably integrated into the avatar client, needs to be built that allows the world builder to quickly and efficiently place encounters.  More randomness in placing encounter tables is also desired.<P>Database System<P>Object Oriented Database<BR>Level: System<BR>Priority:  Essential<BR>Game Designers will use an Object Oriented database to maintain game data, including characters, items, etc.  The database will have a C++ API, allowing programmers to extract data from this database, write it to loadable binary files, and propagate it to test and live servers.  By using an Object Oriented Database, game designers will be able to create data classes with inheritance (a huge time saver considering the inherited nature of the various EQ data structures).  By calling a custom program, Game Designers will be able to export data from the Object Database into binary files and to propagate them to world/zone servers preferably without having to bring those servers down.<P>Real-time Kill tracking by database<BR>Level:  Feature<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>Keeping track of who has killed what NPCs/PCs, how often, and in what quantity is key to addressing camping issues.<P>Graphics Engine<P>Continuous World<BR>Level:  System<BR>Priority:  Essential<BR>The EverQuest 2 engine needs to display to the player one continuous world in the sense that there will be no separate zones or levels as there were in EverQuest 1 and as exist in most 3D games.  As the player traverses the world the data will be loaded incrementally, preferably in such a matter imperceptible to the player (no bogging down when the data is being read from a storage device).  Also, the entire hemisphere of Norrath will exist in game data such that the player can travel virtually anywhere that would exist in the game map.<P>Imperceptible Clipping Plane<BR>Level:  System<BR>Priority:  Essential<BR>By using advanced Level of Detail (LOD) and other technology, the player will not be able to perceive a clipping plane.  This will dramatically increase the immersive nature of the game in that the player could stand on top of a mountain and look down at the valleys, ocean, etc.<P>Auto-Generated Ppoints<BR>Level:  System<BR>Priority:  Essential<BR>The ability for NPCs and other system-side AI entities to traverse the 3D world needs to NOT rely on the manual placing of Ppoints (waypoints), in that this very laborious task takes away time from World Builders to place additional content into the game.  Whether or not Ppoints are created through some export process, or in real time, or whether AI is handled through some non-waypoint related real-time algorythym has yet to be determined.<P>Deformable Geometry<BR>Level:  System<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>The ability of virtually all geometry (terrain, objects, etc.) to be deformable is important.  Bodies of water should ripple and have waves and perceptible currents.  Spell effects could cause earthquakes or other phenomena that deform the adjacent terrain. <P>Curved Surfaces<BR>Level:  System<BR>Priority:  Frosting<BR>Enabling the engine to use curved surfaces should be investigated and used if deemed a valuable and appropriate technology given the game&#8217;s engine needs and where we perceive technology both in terms of software and hardware to be at given EverQuest 2&#8217;s projected release date.  Curved surfaces could be used in terrain, objects, and characters.<P>Sophisticated Shadows<BR>Level:  System<BR>Priority:  Frosting<BR>The ability for the engine to cast sophisticated shadows is important.  This includes characters, objects and even atmospheric or fog effects, for example clouds casting shadows as the move across the sky.	<P>Sophisticated Fog Effects<BR>Level:  System<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>Sophisticated Fog Effects need to be part of the engine.  Fog should not be used to hide a clipping plane, but rather used for effect.  Volumetric Fog is recommended.  The ability to fill a swamp with ground hugging fog, for spell effects to generate bodies of fog, etc. is important.<P>Vehicles<BR>Level:  Feature<BR>Priority:  Essential<BR>The ability to attach mounts to players is essential.   Examples of Vehicles would include but are not limited to the following:  horses, dragons, ships, magic carpets, etc.  Vehicles will have hit points, can take damage and die/be destroyed.   Players will be able to own Vehicles.  NPCs will be able to pilot Vehicles.<P>Flying<BR>Level:  Feature<BR>Priority:  Important<BR> It is important that the camera be able to move virtually anywhere in the world, including up in the air looking down on, for example, a city.  The player should be able to, under certain circumstances (use of a spell or vehicle), fly above and around the game world.  This ability necessitates that the engine be able to handle drawing complex objects in the distance using LOD and other technologies.  It also necessitates that the AI allows NPCs to fly and for other gameplay and game balance elements support this means of transportation.<P>Texture Layers<BR>Level:  Feature<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>The ability for the artist to layer textures is very important, and this includes the ability to layer texture in such a manner that both textures are visible, and also in a manner where they are not.  Texture Layering should be applicable to all characters, objects, and world geometry.  Examples of texture layering applications include but are not limited to:  scars, shield insignia, signs, players appearing dirty, bloody, etc.	<P>Procedural &#8220;Textures&#8221;<BR>Level:  Feature<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>The ability of the engine to use and generate Procedural textures both in place of and in combination with conventional textures is very important.  Examples of Procedural Texture applications include but are not limited to water, lava, waterfalls, infravision, and ultravision.	<P>Environmental Effects and Disasters<BR>Level:  Feature<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>The engine should include technologies enabling the world to display Environmental Effects, including those that affect the world and its occupants.  Examples include but are not limited to storms, tornadoes, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, wind, cold, drought, famine, and plague.	<P>Inverse Kinematics	<BR>Level:  Feature<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>The engine should allow artists to use Inverse Kinematics for animations and other applications.<P>Visible Seasonal Changes	<BR>Level: Feature<BR>Priority:  Frosting<BR>In combination with sky, weather, and other visual atmospheric conditions the game should implement visual seasonal changes.  These would be tied into game time and date, and could not only be visually noticed but should also be able to affect game play, including NPC spawning and other events.<P>In-Game Viewable Graphic Files/Images<BR>Level: Feature<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>The ability to display graphics images in-game would be important and could be used for displaying maps or other documents.<P>Advanced Physics<BR>Level:  System	<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>Advanced physics would include air and water currents, slippery slopes, etc.  The system would also tie into client and server movement so that discrepancies related to latency when movement is extrapolated would be minimal.<P>Lego Approach to Interior Level Building<BR>Level:  System<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>Cites, dungeons, etc. should be created by assembling pre-constructed (geometry and textures if desired) objects.  This allows the world builder to rapidly assemble levels.  Sufficient flexibility in terms of object placement needs to be present such that levels do not appear to have patterns or to be made of a set of objects (even though they are).  In other words, we will avoid the Diablo/Asheron&#8217;s Call effect.<P>Ability to Attach Portals to Lego Blocks	<BR>Level: Detail	<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>Attaching portals at object creation, not level creation, would be a huge time saver.<P>Advanced Particle and Object System<BR>Level:  System	<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>An advanced particle system, including a flexible and easy to use tool, is very important.  This system would be used for spell effects, atmospheric effects, etc.  Examples would include the ability to summon objects like fiery walls, blades, etc.	<P>Visible Atmospheric Events <BR>Level: Detail	<BR>Priority:  Frosting<BR>Visible atmospheric events (like rainbows after it rains) that use the advanced particle system would be nice.   Other examples would be tornadoes, snow, hail, rain, etc.	<P>Visible Deteriorating Corpses <BR>Level:  Detail	<BR>Priority:  Frosting<BR>When a PC or NPC corpse deteriorates there should be an effect and animation, as opposed to it simply disappearing.<P>Faction System<P>Robust Faction System<BR>Level:  System<BR>Priority:  Essential<BR>A faction system built upon the principals of the EverQuest 1, yet in such a way that it is easily communicated to players, incorporating advanced levels of player feedback at core of the system.<P>Cities and other population centers representing singular faction archetypes<BR>Level:  Detail<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>Using the new faction system, cities would tend to represent faction archetypes.<P>Advanced Item Restrictions<BR>Level:  Detail<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>Items may be restricted based on race, class, size, faction, or any combination thereof.<P>GamePlay<P>Sophisticated Guild System<BR>Level:  System<BR>Priority:  Essential<BR>A more detailed guild system will be created that includes multiple levels and ranks for the members, the ability for the guild to be modified and maintained in-game, guild wars, guild alliances, guild treasuries, guild owned buildings, etc.	<P>Multiple Environment Types<BR>Level:  Feature	<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>The ability to set the properties of different terrain types is important, which would influence the types of vehicles that could be used to traverse the terrain, the fatigue incurred, the speed at which it is traversed, etc.	<P>Damaging Environmental Effects	<BR>Level:  Feature	<BR>Priority:  Frosting<BR>This would include areas of extreme heat, cold, or electrically or magically charged areas that do damage or otherwise affect a player in their range of influence.<P>Advanced Encumbrance System<BR>Level:  Detail	<BR>Priority:  Frosting<BR>An advanced encumbrance system, further affecting gameplay, will be developed.	<P>NPC Vendors Casting Spells <BR>Level:  Detail	<BR>Priority:  Frosting<BR>NPCs Vendors will be able to not only sell and buy items, but also to cast spells upon a player for a price.  This would possibly include paid binding in inns.  <P>Tolls for access to various areas	<BR>Level:  Detail	<BR>Priority:  Frosting<BR>NPCs will be able to block access to specified areas, only allowing a player to pass after a toll is given (whether it be paid in money or items).  Killing the NPC would also grant access.<P>Interface<P>Screenless, scalable, customizable, resolution independent Interface	<BR>Level:  System	<BR>Priority:  essential<BR>An intuitive advanced interface will be developed, one that is totally customizable by the player, scalable, and totally resolution independent.  It will not use 2d overlays, but rather will be built using polygons and will thus be both efficient and very flexible in terms of scaling.  Extensive user testing will also take place during development to insure the interface is intuitive and easy to use for the majority of players.<P>3D Overlays and Icons<BR>Level:  Feature	<BR>Priority:  Essential<BR>No 2d overlays will be used in the game - everything will be based on polygons, even if the image is meant to appear to be 2d.  This includes the interface, item icons, fonts, etc.  While this means more polygons displayed, the added resolution independence as well as flexibility in terms of display will more than make up for the additional overhead.	<P>Advanced, Robust Chat Interface<BR>Level:  Feature	<BR>Priority:  Essential<BR>The advanced Chat Interface will be integrated into the rest of the scalable, customizable, resolution independent interface.  The chat interface will also allow for out-of-game communication, including sending messages, real-time chat, and email to and from players in and out of the game.  EverQuest 2 will include an external ICQ-like mini-app that will allow players to communicate with players in-game while they themselves are not in the game. <BR>Unicode<BR>Level:  Feature	<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>All text based communication will use Unicode and allow for the use of multiple alphabets, including Kanji. 	<P>Advanced Camera System<BR>Level:  Feature	<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>The advanced Camera System will include both automatic and manual adjustment of the camera based on preference and the view type selected.  Flexibility will include aspect ratio, zoom, and widescreen adjustments.  Better, more natural camera controls will either be keyboard, mouse, or joystick driven.	<P>Item System<P>Restricted Item Entropy<BR>Level:  Feature	<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>We will investigate limited item entropy, including losing items in certain encounters, limited wearing out of items (renewed by blacksmithy) etc.	<P>Intelligent Items<BR>Level:  Detail	<BR>Priority:  Frosting<BR>The ability to assign NPC AI to items, such that items could imitate NPC functionality.	<P>Customization of Items<BR>Level:  Detail	<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>A player will be able to name certain items; items created via trade skills will bear the mark of their creator; etc.<BR> <BR>Enhanced Inventory System<BR>Level: System<BR>Priority: Essential<BR>The enhanced inventory system will take advantage of texture layering and the fact that virtually any item worn will be visible in the 3D view.<P>Clothing Layer:<BR>Top:		Shirt, Blouse, Tunic, Dress	<BR>Bottom:		Pants, Skirt, Kilt, Dress<P>Ornament Layer:<BR>Forehead:	Headband<BR>Eyes:		Eyepatch, Monical<BR>Nose:		Nose-ring, Bone<BR>Ears: (x2)	Earring<BR>Nape:		Necklace, Choker<BR>Wrists:(x2)	Bracelets<BR>Fingers:(x2)	Ring<BR>Chest:		Sash, Bandoleer<BR>Navel:		Belly-ring, Gem<BR>Back:		Backpack, Weapon Harness, Cape, Shield, Bow<BR>Waist:		Belt, Sash<BR>Ankles:(x2)	Anklets<BR>Toes: (x2)	Toe-rings<P>Armor Layer:<BR>Head:		Helmet, Cap, Hood<BR>Face:		Mask<BR>Neck:		Collar<BR>Shoulders:	Shoulderpads<BR>Upper Arms:	Sleeves<BR>Fore Arms:(x2)	Bracers, Buckler<BR>Hands:		Gloves<BR>Upper Body:	Breastplate<BR>Lower Body:	Leggings, Armored Kilt<BR>Feet:		Boots, Sandals<P>Held Items:<BR>Right Hand:	Sword, Spear, Dagger, Shield, Bow, Crossbow, etc., any Item.<BR>Left Hand:	Sword, Spear, Dagger, Shield, Bow, Crossbow, etc., any Item.<P>	Container Items: There will be NO General Inventory Slots like in EverQuest.  Container Items will provide the additional carrying capacity players will need.  For example: A Backpack is Item Type "Back" and can be placed in the "Back Slot" on the Ornament Layer and will have our standard 8 Large General Slot capacity.  A Jewelers Belt would be Item Type "Waist" and could be placed in the "Waist Slot" on the Ornament Layer and provide 4 Tiny General Slots.  A pair of Cutpurse Boots would be of Item Type "Feet", would be placed in the "Feet Slot" on the Armor Layer and provide 2 Small General Slots.  A Leather Hooked Belt might have two "Hanging Slots" into which containers of Item Type "Hanging" could be placed; a Large Bag or a Leather Scabbard for example.<BR>	Compound Items: Pseudo-Container Items that have specialized "Inventory" slots associated with them that alter their function and appearance based on the item that is placed within them.  For example:  A Feathered Hat, would have a "Feather Slot".  Any Item type "Feather" could be placed in the hat.  We could have several different magic Feathers or even just different colored feathers.  Another example would be a Charm Bracelet, that might have multiple "Charm Slots&#8221; that other items of type "Charm" could be placed on the bracelet.<BR>	Conditional Slots: Similar to the way 2h weapons worked in EQ, the Inventory System for EQ2 needs to be aware of the character equipping Items that may invalidate their ability to use other Inventory Slots or restrict the Type of Item that may be placed in other specific Inventory Slots.  For EXAMPLE:  A character that wishes to wear a Peasant Dress may place that Item in EITHER the Top Slot or the Bottom Slot on the Clothing Layer.  When they do so the OTHER slot on the Clothing Layer MUST be "grayed out" as a Peasant Dress takes both the Top Slot and Bottom Slot.  IN ADDITION, if this character attempts to equip, for example, Bronze Plate Leggings in the Lower Body Slot on the Armor Layer, they should receive a message to the affect of; "You may not Equip your Bronze Plate Leggings while wearing a Peasant Dress."  But, they could, for example, equip a Banded Bronze Kilt in that same Lower Body Slot on the Armor Layer without any problem.  There will be many situations like this.  This level of sophistication will require much more fore-thought and thoroughness on the part of everyone creating items for EQ2, but, in order for us to stick to the mandate of "seeing all equipment on the character", this kind of conditional equipment system is necessary.<BR>	Primary, Secondary, Ranged and Ammo Slots: These will no longer be Inventory Slots but merely visual indicators of and a way of specifying which weapons are your Primary Melee, Secondary Melee, Ranged Weapon, and Ammo of choice.  Engaging in melee or ranged combat will cause your character to stow whatever they are carrying in their Left and Right Hand Slots, if they can (if they can not stow the items they will drop them), and draw their weapons of choice from wherever they were previously stowed.<BR>	Note About Animations: It might be nice, if possible, using IK, to actually animate a character "equipping" his/her items; for example, a warrior might walk around with a Long Sword in a Sheath attached to a Leather Belt in his Waist Slot on the Ornament Layer and a Bow slung across his Back while he carries a Torch in his Left Hand Slot and a Large Sack in his Right Hand Slot.  He spies an enemy in the distance and hides behind a tree.  He targets his enemy and presses the Ranged Weapon Slot (that Graphically displays the Bow that is on his Back).  Automatically, his character douses the Torch and Stows it in the Large Sack, then Stows the Large Sack on the last open "Hanging Slot" on his Leather Belt.  Then, still on automatic, he draws the Bow from his back and an arrow from the Large Sack and fires it at his Enemy.  It hits, the enemy rushes him.  He switches on Auto-Melee, and automatically Stows his Bow on his Back and Draws his Long Sword and attacks.<P>Level Building<P>Restricted Activity Zones<BR>Level:  Feature<BR>Priority:  Essential<BR>World Builders will be able to define rectangular zones with the world in which certain activities, events, and actions are permitted.  Outside of those zones these activities, events, and actions will not be permitted.<P>Player Houses using zoning ala SimCity	<BR>Level:  System	<BR>Priority:  Essential<BR>Using Restricted Activity Zones, World Builders will set aside residential areas in which players can build houses, castles, towers, and other player owned structures.  These structures will cost different amounts of money based on the size of the structure, and the zones will be subdivided into lots, with player owned structures taking up more lots the larger they are.  Placing these structures will be grid based such that residential blocks will develop over time as opposed to the random urban sprawl seen in UO.<P>Player commercial sites using zoning ala SimCity	<BR>Level:  System	<BR>Priority:  Frosting<BR>Commercial zones will work similarly to Residential Zones, however players will be able to own and operate buildings in which players can buy and sell items.  This may include hiring NPC vendors to run these commercial sites.<P>Magic System<P>Advanced Somatic Magic System<BR>Level:  System	<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>Advanced magic system will incorporate somatic components with many animations to support the somatic aspect of spellcasting.   A detailed research skill will be tied closely to this system.	<P>Sympathetic Magic/Item system	<BR>Level:  System	<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>(to be debated)<P>Group Spells & Spell Combinations	<BR>Level:  Feature	<BR>Priority:  Frosting<BR>The spell system will include spells that require multiple players&#8217; cooperation in order to successfully cast.  <P>Lycanthropy 	<BR>Level:  Detail	<BR>Priority:  Frosting<BR>Characters will be subject to the Lycanthropy curse when bit by a Lycanthrope.<P>Vampirism<BR>Level:  Detail<BR>Priority:  Frosting<BR>Characters will be subject to Vampirism when bit by a Vampire.<P>Familiars<BR>Level:  Detail	<BR>Priority:  Frosting (unless required by a new character class)<BR>Persistent pets whose presence endows benefit to owner and whose death harms owner	<P>Sophisticated Bard System<BR>Level:  Detail	<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>A detailed bard system of songs related to the composition of the songs, the instruments necessary to play them and/or to enhance their effect.  This includes a method to compose and play music on in-game instruments, including instruments carried in a character&#8217;s inventory as well as fixed instruments (for example organs, harpsichords, etc.) that a bard could play were he within range.  The magical effect of songs enhanced by fixed instruments or songs requiring a fixed instrument could be significantly more powerful in that the placement of fixed instruments is controlled by the World Builders (for example, an incentive to loiter in a tavern might exist in that a bard might be there playing a very effective healing song on a fixed instrument).  Also note that songs played or sung by a bard in-game will produce audible music via the player&#8217;s sound card.<P>Contagious Disease<BR>Level:  Detail	<BR>Priority:  Frosting<BR>Players will have the chance of being infected by diseases when exposed to already infected player based on distance and time.  The possibility of Plagues in cities and such becomes reality.	<P>Some Spells linked to Caster<BR>Level:  Detail	<BR>Priority:  Frosting<BR>Some spell types will be linked to the status of the caster, such that were the caster to die or be otherwise incapacitated, his spell would go away.	<P>More Spell Uniqueness	<BR>Level:  Detail	<BR>Priority:  Important<BR>An effort to create more unique classes of spells will be made such that the wide variety of spells available in EQ 2 are less derivative. <P>Quest System<P>Advanced Quest System <BR>Level:  System	<BR>Priority:  Essential<BR>Quest entities will be independent of an NPC or other object.  Streamlined system for setting up quests, possibly with fewer options than we had in EQ1 with emphasis on making them easy to implement, test, and understand.  Quests are separate entities that are controlled by the server bank and have NPCs, Items, Dialog, treasure, associated with them instead of having them by associated with the NPC. This way we can add a random factor to who gives/ends the quest.  Possibly each FACTION then has a set number of quests that ANY NPC in that faction can give out.  So by default EVERY NPC in an intelligent faction would have a generic quest to give out then we can spend our time on more specific and sweeping ones.<P>Race/Class System<P>Additional  and more Elaborate Races & Classes<BR>Level:  System<BR>Priority:  Essential<P>Level Based Classes & Professions<BR>2 experience tables.

I've always loved to think of improvements to video games, and even to design sequels.  I would love to be a game designer, but programing all of the features I would feel were neccesary would take me a few decades....   <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"> <P>So, doing it as a hobby has been my choice for the most part.  I've given a fair bit of thought to EQ2, or even just basic improvements to everquest.  I would LOVE to see you make this topic into a website, or at least a new messageboard (or for anyone to do this, and post the link here).<P>Monsters that can move through zones, if they remain, or perhaps NPCs that can do the same, would be much more entertaining than knowing where "NPC X" is going to be at "Y" time.  <P>NPCs that can level up... now there's a better reason for why you want to kill a god on the first try.<P>The ability to write "books" in game, and distribute them to other players.  Not only can some players have fun writing in-game, but it would add an entire new level of depth to the world, if the last dragon raid you went on was the best selling adventure story nextweek.<P>The Vagrant Story method of weaponry entertained me greatly... for those unfamiliar with it, as one used a weapon against certain "classes" of enemies, i.e. humans, dragons, beasts, the weapon grew more powerful against that type, and weaker against other types.  If this development of items was present in EQ2, then a warrior could seek out not just the best weapon, but the best weapons against each monster category.  Who wouldn't be proud to own a "Wurmslayer" that actually was excellant at slaying wurms?<P>Dynamic towns.  The longer it exists, the more it develops.  A system of town development would also allow for a system of town destruction... and thus kingdom warfare with some very significant outcomes.  Imagine a racewar server where races litterally could take over a continent... balance to limit this would be an issue, of course, so that one faction couldn't own the entire world, but warfare with persistent outcomes... that would be awesome.<P>Keep this tread alive people... you know the good ideas will keep rolling in.   <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">

This sounds INCREDIBLE!! That is if these are REALLY all going to be in the game. djdexters referral is a great thought as in it would be AWSOME to have a guild treasury! "We are going to fight DE's! Gather all the DE slaying swords!" Very cool!<P>I am very excited about the developments of guilds. I would LOVE to purchase a 4 story guild building the size of a city block. Guards at each door, treasury deep within, and several lucrative shops in town selling all manor of things. I would strive to make this happen, and wouldn't know what to do with myself if it did. HOPE THIS ALL REALLY HAPPENS IN EQ2!!!<P>--------------------<P>My bent 2 cp.<P>Man o' Man. Crazziness just took on a WHOLE new meaning.
