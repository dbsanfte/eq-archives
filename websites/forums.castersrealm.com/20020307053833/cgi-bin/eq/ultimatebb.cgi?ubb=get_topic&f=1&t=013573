This is a compiled copy of TSF:SoTV as it stands right now, no new chapters as of yet, that should change by the end of the week..but of course if you haven't been looking in the Fan Fic boards then 2 of these will be new. Either way Enjoy  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><BR>---------------------<P><BR>                        -----------------------<P>                        For almost 500 years , I have watched Norrath changed, blossom and decay. Nations rise and fall...teachings are<BR>                        learned and forgotten. Unfortunately the latter happened to what my beloved tried to show to the world. The truth<BR>                        behind all things fell upon deaf ears...the 'gods' sway has gone undiminished...but like all things. They changed. Through<BR>                        our offspring, the truth is starting to be spread once again. Maybe this generation can finally convince Norrath...or<BR>                        maybe it will fall tot eh wayside once again..maybe...regardless of what happens, the winds of change are blowing was<BR>                        once again and Norrath will never be the same.<BR>                        --------------------<P>                        Kyt hated the underground caverns, they stunk like the pits of hell and were as dark as pitch.<P>                        |Why don't they ever clean these damn caverns?|<P>                        I have no idea Mika. You would think they would a city, A capital city, no less as rich as Palsa could pay some one to<BR>                        clean it.<P>                        |Beauracrats..|<P>                        No kidding <P>                        |Kyt..slow down a bit, I don't like this he has to be around here somewhere.|<P>                        Can't you sense his familiar?<P>                        |No..That scares me...I should be able to sense familiars|<P>                        I hate to admit it, but this is scaring me too..I almost wish that I had waited a bit..|<P>                        |Big bad Kyt? scared? I'm shocked. Don't worry, You will do just fine, your more then ready to become th- DUCK!!!!|<P>                        Kyt ducked at her familiar’s advice just a chain shot out of the shadows and sailed over her. She then rolled to the<BR>                        right, withdrawing her scimitar. A blue wolf appeared behind her running at high speed, it leapt and just as it was about<BR>                        to land on her back, it shimmered and in a flash of darkness, it was gone, and upon Kyt was suit of blue spiked armor.<P>                        Her breath drew short, as her eyes darted from side to side, trying to pierce the darkness searching for her target. <P>                        |Calm down, Kyt, if your heart starts beating any faster and harder, you'll rattle off your armor.|<P>                        You would like that wouldn't you?<P>                        | I refrain to answer that..it might incriminate me..|<P>                        She smiled, but the smile faded as she noticed her that her breath was becoming visible, the mist hanging in the air<BR>                        because of the cold.<P>                        He's close.<P>                        |Your armor is rattling...|<P>                        I'm scared.......I'm not ready for this!!!!<P>                        "Too late to run now" Spoke a deep voice behind her. She wheeled around, swinging her scimitar at the voice, it<BR>                        exploded as it touched a fiery red cloak. She gasped then cried out, as two chains arced out of the shadows and<BR>                        collided with her armor, shattering the familiar armor, leaving her in nothing but her burlap under clothing. Another flash<BR>                        of darkness went off, catapulting her backwards flying through the air.<P>                        |KYT!!!|<P>                        Four more chains harpooned out the darkness, each of the chains buried themselves into her wrists and ankles, then<BR>                        hoisted her up off the ground, spread eagling her.<P>                        A cold, deep voice laugh crept out of the darkness, a tall shape stepped out. The majority of the figure couldn't be<BR>                        made out by the pain wracked girl, but she could very clearing make out the fiery cape and cowl.<P>                        Mika....Help me!!!!!<P>                        The blue wolf, appearing at her side, charged the tall figure. The wolf leapt it's teeth bared, and was shredded by a<BR>                        barrage of chains through it's body. The mutilated body crashed tot he ground, just barely alive.<P>                        |Kyt...I'm sorry.....I've failed y-|<P>                        The wolf howled as it exploded into flames.<P>                        MIKA! Mika!! Answer me!!!!!!!!! Say something!!!!!!!!!!<P>                        The figure laughed again. <P>                        "Your familiar is gone girl, as you will be. But you will not be so fortunate as it. I intend on savoring your soul."<P>                        "YOU..bas... I'll kill you!!!"<P>                        The figure responded with several lashes from his shadow chains, they bit into her flesh making her scream in pain.<BR>                        Another barrage tore off some of her flesh and what little clothing she had left on.<P>                        The figure smiled. He moved up to her, and with his hand clutched her face. <P>                        "Such beauty.I shall savor every moment of ecstasy, every second of exquisite pain." to make his point, the chains<BR>                        began to retract slowly.<P>                        She screamed and then spat into his face. "Do you what want!! You and I both know that you aren't a true Hell Lord!!<BR>                        You may have beaten me!! But you will always be a Mal'shak!! You never could claim the title!!! You could never beat -"<P>                        The figure's eyes flashed with anger and the chains penetrating her body, glowed white hot, eliciting another scream<BR>                        for Kyt. Another chain leapt out of the darkness and smashed into her, feeling like she had been punched hard in the<BR>                        left shoulder. The other chains vacated her body and she slumped to the floor. When she made to get up, she<BR>                        gasped..but she couldn't scream any more...her arm...her left arm was gone..only a constant spurt of blood.<P>                        The figure began to talk..but not to her..Just to the darkness as if some one else was there.<P><BR>                        "You robbed me of my destiny..My chance to go to Jahorn..." A spiked chain shot out and pierced through Kyt's neck<BR>                        and out of the other side, it retracted slight and she felt barbs at the back of her head as she grasped in disbelief at<BR>                        the chain in front of her, buried in her neck.<P>                        "But I can feel you out there..taunting me...I can feel your power....Every moment. you grow stronger....as do<BR>                        I....soon...we shall meet...and I shall claim my birth right...."<P>                        The chain retreated back into the darkness. Kyt felt no pain... she tumbled forward, finding her self looking at the feet<BR>                        of the figure....the Hell Lord of Palsa, Maxim..as he walked off into the shadows, she heard another thump..and<BR>                        something fell into her view...her twitching headless body. <P>                        Just the last light faded from her, she heard one last word.<P>                        ".....Raziel."<BR>                        -----------------------------------<P>                        A black crescent wave carved the air and into a dozen undead which where immediately disintegrated. But even more<BR>                        took up the fallen's place, all the while still moaning from eternal agony.<P>                        "Dread.....Dread.....Join us.......Dread!!!!!!!!"<P>                        The zombies continued up the hill, pushing through the onslaught undaunted until they came upon an invisible barrier.<BR>                        The zombies howled in pain as the barrier scorched them. On the other side of barrier, a cloaked figure approached the<BR>                        howling zombies, extending an arm. Black hot flames ignited on his arm and a beamed pulsed out destroying the mob of<BR>                        zombies pressed against the barrier.<P>                        The shrouded figure, stepped through to the other side of the barrier into the large gap in the mob of zombies. The<BR>                        zombies closed in encircling the figure, but then suddenly they stopped and didn't close in any further. The figure<BR>                        looked around searching for someone or something. Obviously getting agitated, the figure pulled back the hood of the<BR>                        cloak, revealing a black skinned elf.<P>                        "I tire of this Dread King!!! Show yourself!!"<P>                        The zombies encircling the black elf, began to speak, but instead of the normal moan and chants, they began to speak<BR>                        as one, in a cold almost distant voice.<P>                        "Try as... you might Dirk..... You will never..... be able to hold..... me back forever..."<P>                        "That remains to be seen! You have been trying for 18 years unsuccessfully!

Nall Tayus aka... KID DRACO!!!}<P><BR>                        Nall enters from behind a black curtain, gingerly. He turns around briefly shaking his rear at the crowd, eliciting cheers<BR>                        from the women in the audience. He then leaps into the air turning back to face the crowd, with an arm raised in<BR>                        triumph he shots.<P>                        "BAM!!" <P>                        Pyro ignites briefly obscuring him then begins to ignite in stages going down the ramp entry ramp. As the pyro begins to<BR>                        cycle back up the sides of the ramp, Nall lands flexes eliciting more cheers from the women in the audience and starts<BR>                        down toward the arena.<P>                        | Remember, let him have the advantage, but not to much or they will put a hold on the betting odds.|<P>                        Yeah. Yeah.<P>                        A gong sounds as Nall was at the bottom of the ramp flicking the bang of red hair on his forehead, driving the women<BR>                        wild.<P>                        What was that ?<P>                        |The start gong|<P>                        Oh....CR-<P><BR>                        "YOUR MINE KID!!!!"

Magus has got the kid in his infamous hug of bone cracking!!}<P>                        {I guess he should have spent less time showing off and a little more time paying attention on what Magus was doing.

Hey why is he beginning to glow?}<P>                        {Looks like the Kid is warming up! So far as we have seen in the last week, he really hates to get in close in these<BR>                        fights. He prefers to take his opponents down with mana based attacks. But think for a minute that he can't fight close<BR>                        up.}<P><BR>                        Nall begins to glow fiercely as mana begins to gather around him. Suddenly he the mana flows stops and he with his fist<BR>                        he strikes the arena floor.<P>                        "MANA WAVE!!!!!!!" A blue wave of energy erupts and streaks toward Magus. Magus glows yellow briefly then unleashes<BR>                        his own mana attack.<P>                        "GROUND QUAKER!!!"<P>                        The swell of yellow mana collides and then consumes Nall's attack and before Nall could react the swell consumed him,<BR>                        singing him and burning some of his clothes. For an interminable time, Nall was in pain. That was all that existed<BR>                        pain...endless pain...then it was gone. He could see somewhat, but the smoke from his burnt clothes stung his eyes. He<BR>                        could barely make out the lumbering form of Magus coming toward him. The shape got closer and closer.. then he felt<BR>                        the air leave his lungs, a fist was buried deep in his stomach, then in his face, then nothing once again. He could feel<BR>                        air rush past him, that weird weightless feeling of flight...then he cried out once again as he found himself slamming into<BR>                        the crowd protection shield. The stinging of the shields energy snapped him to full consciousness.<P>                        Oh that hurt...How are the odds Granpa?<P>                        |Those can't be real! |<P>                        Huh?

A consciousness awakens for the first time. For<BR>                        the first time it begins to look out, searching.....just to explore the world around it. For a millennia the consciousness<BR>                        spread out understanding it's environment and itself. Only as the things came into perspective did the consciousness<BR>                        realize that it was alive, and what it was. As it turned inward and explored the surrounding of skin and sinew that held<BR>                        it to this plane, it looked at every par t of the form. Exploring and pondering every inch, every hair, every finger, every<BR>                        leg...Everything in its entirety. It pondered each part and understood each part so thoroughly , that it became them.<BR>                        and for the first time it looked upon its world through its eyes.<P>                        At first everything was blurry, then slowly came into view. The world was soft...almost......like a liquid.... yes that<BR>                        seemed to be the right word, the mind decided. The eyes looked upon more of its surroundings, it saw some shapes a<BR>                        few inches from it. It focused on the shapes and read them with much happiness. A flush of elation ran through it, it<BR>                        was it's first word.<P><BR>                        LILITH<P>                        The mind thought upon the word with happiness. It liked the word. It was nice. It decided to call itself that. Lilith. That<BR>                        was nice. As it pondered the word even more, it noticed some movement just beyond the floating word.. Lilith focused<BR>                        in on the movement, the moving shape came into focus. It was short.it had hands....legs...a robe.robe seemed like the<BR>                        right word...it was a gnome...That is what those little things where called. The Gnome wearing the robe was cheering<BR>                        about something..something else that was moving around.....a stereo tub..In the tub was the figure of....a boy...with<BR>                        snow white hair except for this red sliver of hair running across his forehead. The boy seemed to be fighting.... he<BR>                        seemed so strong..yet..he was holding back...Lilith couldn’t figure out why.....but she didn't ponder it too much. For<BR>                        some reason, she liked looking at him....it puzzled her why ..she felt so...different..she felt giddy and excited...<P>                        She her body and reached out searching for the boy. She wanted him she was so happy..so happy..happy happy happy<BR>                        PAIN!! FRIGHT!! LOSS!!!!

Lilith retreated into herself, taking a few centuries to compose herself and prepare herself to release the<BR>                        other....and maybe find that boy. She giggled for the first time, she liked the boy. He would be hers. Finally ready she<BR>                        stretched and took full control of the body of meat and skin.<P>                        The computer beside the En-Gen Tech chirped loudly. It screeched, but the tech was slow as he was still interested in<BR>                        the fight between Nall and Magus. He had 40 platinum on Magus to win.<P>                        "ah Man..." He turned his chair to the noisy computer and stared at it wide eyed.<P>                        "What the? That can't be right!!! There is no way!!! How could the MTA levels have risen so high!! There's no way! and<BR>                        so quickly!!!!

"<P>                        The tech went to slap an emergency call button to the Overseer, but he hard a cracking sound, he turned to the bio<BR>                        tube which held En-Gen's prize work Lilith. A large crack ran down the polymer tube.<P>                        "Oh no..Dear Quellious!" his eyes looked onto the sky blue eyes of Lilith, entranced...and it was the last he saw as<BR>                        shards of the bio tube sliced through him. <P>                        Lilith ,dripping getting wet from the solution that once held her in stasis, smiled and stepped out into the new world.<BR>                        ------------------------------------<P>                        |10-1 odds Nall.

With a light push, Magus sailed across the<BR>                        arena smashing into Crowd protection shield. Magus slumped down unconscious.<P>                        Nall flipped forward to the center of the ring then cheered "ALRIGHT!!! " The crowd roared...then went silent very<BR>                        quickly.<P>                        Hey..wht's up? Why is everyone so silent? I just won...

TANK!!!<P>                        Tank roared shaking the arena, then lifted his arms and two rockets shot from his shoulders detonating in midair.<P>                        No..no...NO!!! This isn't fair!! This isn't a handicap match!!!!<P>                        "YOUR GOING TO GET IT RUNT!!" Tank shouted pointing at the dumbstruck Nall firing a rocket.<P>                        AAHHHH!!!!<P>                        Nall leap to the left just missing the rocket.<P>                        |Hey.

Several women in the audience wolf called at him.<P>                        As his muscles bulged to their fullest , he tensed ready to strike. "DRAGON-"<P>                        He disappeared from sight. Tank panned around looking for Nall and got more then he wanted. Nall reappeared in front<BR>                        of Tank in midair.

Tank found himself engulfed by a wave of pure energy, the wave was so forceful it lifted the super<BR>                        heavy man and sent him flying across the arena, landing not to far from his partner. <P>                        {HOLY!!! WOW!! Have you ever seen anything like that? Lets count the hits in super slo-mo!!! 1...2...10.......Incredible,<BR>                        not counting that massive energy wave a breathtaking 56 hits all in 4 seconds!!! Unbelievable!!!!!!} <P>                        Nall collapse on knee, panting heavily from the expenditure. But the cheers pf the crowd, got the adrenaline flowing and<BR>                        he got back up to his feet and waked tot he center of the ring and raised his arms in triumph!<P>                        YEAH!!!

Aquamarine saved the crowd!!!<P>                        As the ear piercing screeched died out, Aquamarine somersaulted through the air and landed in front of Tank. Planting a<BR>                        fist into his faceplate and then an armored leg into his groin dropping the behemoth.<P>                        Nall still somewhat dazed from the sound, watched through the haze as aquamarine then moonsaulted and dropped<BR>                        down the large hole she caused with her shoulder canon.<P>                        {Hey where is Aquamarine going? Wait a sec....Isn't that area of the floor above the ..OH NO!!!!!}<P>                        Aquamarine reappeared out of the hole carrying three very large jingling sacks. Turning toward the dazed Nall, she lifted<BR>                        her Visor showing her face to him. <P>                        "Thanks for driving up the loot cutie. I owe ya!" She blew him a kiss and snapped down the visor. Crouching down for a<BR>                        moment, she leapt 50 feet into the air and then her thrusters kicked in sending her flying upward and away.<P>                        |NALL!!! You got to stop her!! She just robbed the place!!!!

Blue Platinum stealer you!!!!"<P>                        Flying under her, he swiped at her breastplate which she easily dodged. He swiped at her several times, missing again<BR>                        and again. seeing that she had no way of escaping without fighting him, she let go of the bags, and with a sudden<BR>                        quickness grasped Nall and head butted him. As stars circled around him, she cut her thrusters and began to fall back<BR>                        down toward the arena him tight in her grasp.<P>                        {Oh no!! Looks she has him set up for her signature move!! The Waterfall!!!}<P>                        Her thrusters kicked in as the plummeted head first, the arena grew larger and larger, and then she kicked of him letting<BR>                        him continue on his own.<P>                        {OH!!!! 1.....2.....3...AH...4..Geez!!...5...6!!! Man she just drove him down through 6 floors of the Arena. And that's<BR>                        reinforced Velium!! Some one get a cleric for this kid!}<P>                        Aquamarine continued back up into the sky, diverting just enough to catch the falling bags filled to the brim with<BR>                        platinum coins. A second pair of thrusters angled out and she rocketed up into the night sky.<P>                        ...women............................ow.....<P>                        6 floors down under the arena, Nall's world went black.<P>                        |NALL!!!!! Answer me!!!!!!! NALL!|<P>                        The winged silver cat Reyas sifted through the mess of velium and mythril searching desperately for his grandson. After<BR>                        a few minutes, he came upon a patch of white fur. <P>                        |Nall!!!!!|<P>                        Reaching in he pulled out a small white winged kitten with a red diamond on its forehead. Shaking the kitten for a few<BR>                        moment, it mewed grumpily.<P>                        Think it's to late to try the Antonican lottery? ow......<P>                        The kitten Nall, dozed off to sleep again.<BR>                        -------------------------------------<P>                        Not too far away. On the top of one of mountain peaks in the Oasis of Marr. A figure wearing a two horned mask of<BR>                        crystal, watched what happened above. As the events unfolded and concluded. The figure began to talk to itself. at<BR>                        first it was a man's voice.<P>                        "Things are starting once again. The void is growing restless and stretching out more and more. The teachings have<BR>                        gotten it excited, it must not be allowed o be free...I should have listened to you."<P>                        The voice continued talking to itself but this time it was a woman's voice.<P>                        *You hold to much guilt. Why do you always take so much upon your shoulders?"*<P>                        Then back to the man's<P>                        "Because it is my fate not to rest until things are right. I owe her that much."<P>                        *But why do you place such a have penance upon yourself. You could have brought her back long ago. It was well<BR>                        within your grasp.*<P>                        "With the knowledge of what I have done to this world..and the pain I put on her I could not bear to look upon her. I<BR>                        would only see pain..nothing but endless pain."<P>                        *You are so melodramatic...but that is one thing I have always loved about you. It was why I picked you, because you<BR>                        don't find the easy way out..but even so. You don't have to take it this far. You can have some happiness.*<P>                        "Maybe...but not today. Only when the Void has been silenced."<P>                        *Yes.*<P>                        The two voices began to speak together, almost as one, but overlapping each other.<P>                        "The influence of the Void must wiped from Norrath and from al things. It must not be freed. It is our task, our duty to<BR>                        ensure that the Universe knows not the touch of the void.

He acquired this rank, through less then perfect<BR>                        circumstances, which has lead to recent events and discovery of other potent subjects for integration into the Ghost<BR>                        Program and Lilith.<P><BR>                        From what that can be extracted from old scrolls. Maxim was one of Raziel Eom’brn’s students at the Rank of Hell<BR>                        Knight. For all that can be told, it was said that Maxim was immensely powerful even then, but unlike his current state,<BR>                        he was easy going and for the most part cheerful and happy. But that was changed about 500 years ago, when the<BR>                        people of the now destroyed city of Erudin, attacked the also destroyed city of Paineel.<P>                        In the attack, his love was mortally wounded and later died in his arms as the old cliché goes. Bringing out the cold,<BR>                        torturous Maxim that we know of now. The death of his love, also a Hell Knight Reva, sealed his heart in ice, and the<BR>                        only pleasure he ever received from then on was the slow torturing of those who opposed him, with his shadow chains.<P>                        Because of Raziel’s flight from Paineel, Maxim being the only surviving Hell Knight (being this after torturing and slaying<BR>                        the other student of Raziel.), Maxim was promoted to the rank of Hell Lord.<P>                        Unfortunately for him, custom and lore states that He is not a true Hell Lord and may never enter the sacred ‘Halls of<BR>                        Jahorn’ (A mythical place, to the Hell Lords, where there souls go after death.), because he never defeated his mentor<BR>                        Raziel. This just further agitated Maxim, driving him even more insane then his mentor. (As unbelievable as that<BR>                        sounds).<P>                        Flash forward 500 years to the present. Maxim is still the Hell Lord, and at this point he has tortured and consumed the<BR>                        souls of hundreds and hundreds of his students and countless others. His heart of ice over the years has grown colder<BR>                        and his mind even more unstable until one day he meets a woman capable of piercing the ice, and for a time he almost<BR>                        seemed stable.<P>                        But things like this are never perfect, as it turns out the woman that eased his suffering, was the wife of one of our<BR>                        targets Dirk Lunas (See file Dirk). <P>                        For reason unknown, she left him after the brief 2-month affair, returning to Dirk. This of course drove Maxim, insane<BR>                        beyond all point of recovery.<P>                        Interestingly enough, the woman later returned some time later and was promptly killed by Maxim. Though her death<BR>                        wasn’t his usual MO. It was quick and without (for the most part) pain.<P><BR>                        Summary: Maxim is a valuable subject for the projects. A sample of him is required immediately. Though there are few<BR>                        subjects that I would like to delve into deeper, when I can spare the time. One, through out his reign as Hell Lord or<BR>                        even back when he was just a Knight. No one ever saw his familiar. It can only be speculated that, he chooses to hide<BR>                        it for when he needs the familiar's power..which makes you wonder just how powerful can Maxim be?<P>                        End of File<BR>                        En-Gen Bio-Research Head Shamus Actus<BR>                        ----------------------------------------<P>                        Subject: Dirk Lunas<BR>                        Profession: Unknown<BR>                        Age: Estimated to be over 500 years old<BR>                        MTA Level: Unchartable<BR>                        Race: Combinate Creature (High Elf and Unknown)<BR>                        Last Known Location: ButcherBlock protected zone, Continent Faydwer <BR>                        En-Gen Filer: Shamus Actus<P>                        Bio: <P>                        Dirk Lunas, probably one of the most reclusive and hard to find subjects ever tracked. There is not much to report<BR>                        specifically about him; from old records it is known that he is a master of Shadow Magic, supposedly a ‘God’ level magic<BR>                        form.<P>                        On the other hand there is a great wealth of information about the people around him. More specifically his wife. He<BR>                        lived with her for a great period of time inside the Butcherblock protected area. For the most part that is were they<BR>                        stayed, only occasionally visiting the outside world.<P>                        In one of these outings his wife met and had an affair with Maxim Tidias (See file Maxim). The affair was brief however,<BR>                        and she retuned to Dirk. But this brings up an interesting possibility. About 2 years after the affair and her return she<BR>                        gave birth to a child, because of the wildly varying gestation periods (5 months-3 years) of elves and half-breed elves.<BR>                        It is unknown if the child was fathered by Maxim or Dirk. But regardless of the child’s father, she must contain<BR>                        extraordinaire power. Which is why En-Gen is very interested in her, not to mention the Dread king who dominates the<BR>                        accused continent.<P>                        Summary: Dirk Lunas and his(if she is his) child are valuable subjects and a sample must be obtained. Also considering<BR>                        the constant attacks by the Dread King and his knowledge of Shadow Magic, I recommend that we take a sample of<BR>                        Dirk and liquidate him, but extract the child from Faydwer and bring her back to En-Gen. Not only can we obtain<BR>                        samples from her, but also considering her young age and impressionability, she could be recruited to one of our<BR>                        programs.<P>                        End of File

Dirk sat in the chair, no light on, pistol in hand and armored in his heavy power suit,<BR>            save his head, on which the helmet‘s visor was open.<P>            His skin had returned to it’s normal gray color as the anger subsided. He was actually a fairly handsome man. He was built like a sword<BR>            blade, long and thin, deceptively slight. He was actually very strong when he needed to be. His dark hair and cool black-and-blue<BR>            eyes had given him his title. Black Elf, they called him. Black in body, maybe, but not in heart. Darkness was his weapon, and so was<BR>            light. But it didn’t control him.<P>            He slouched, actually, drained of most energy. He hadn’t eaten a full, good meal in days-he’d given all of his better food to Trini. A<BR>            smile, melancholy and bleak, rose to his face as he remembered how much his daughter looked like her mother.<P>            Memories rose unbidden. He gritted his teeth, but he couldn’t stop them.<P>            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>            Nall ordered another drink. The waitress looked oddly at him. “Aren’t you a little young for the hard stuff?”<P>            “Just get me it. I need it.” Nall sighed and turned to his grandfather. “I can’t believe that I let her get away.”<P>            “Let?” Reyas grinned in half-elven form. “You got yourself stomped.” He gave the waitress a lewd grin, she blushed and looked away.<P>            “And we bet all our cash on that fight...and that....that....” Nall looked furious. “jerk stole it! We‘ll never pay our debts! We‘ll never fly<BR>            that damn...airship again! We gotta find a job..”<P>            “Calm down, Nall. Calm down.” Reyas sighed. “You have to be patient. We‘ll fix the airship soon enough.”<P>            “Easy for you to say! How old are you anyways?”<P>            “I am not old!”<P>            “So several millennia is young?”<P>            “You wouldn’t know! It’s not the age, it’s the attitude-”<P>            “Boys, boys...” A man in a black business suit was standing nearby. “Please behave yourself.” He looked slightly suspiciously at them,<BR>            then leaned forward conspiratorially. “I was listening. You need a job? I have a business proposition for you..”<P>            “We don’t work for free, you know. Show us some encouragement.” Nall said, the drink beginning to get to him.<P>            The man opened his briefcase.<P>            Nall saw nothing but the shine of the pure platinum bullion inside. One hundred percent pure, shining, glittering platinum bars. He<BR>            found he had stopped breathing. Drink forgotten, his eyes fixed on the man’s face as enchanted by the platinum his wits wandered.<P>            “That pique your interest?”<P>            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>            Dirk and his wife had lived in the temple since Tunare’s death. He had loved her very much, of course. But while he had been content<BR>            to study, read, and learn most of the time, with only infrequent trips, Jesi didn’t have the patience for that. He had let her go out into<BR>            the world on her own. She had left once-and not come back or even communicated for two months. He had only learned what had<BR>            happened from her.<P>            -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>            Maxim stared at the dead body in front of him. It was a woman, dressed in evening dress and lying prone. It was old, five years old,<BR>            but showed no sign of decay. Indeed, the wood elf could have been asleep.<P>            “I’m sorry....” he whispered. “I’m so sorry, Jesica.”<P>            [I hate you! I hate you!] she shrieked in his head. [I hate you! You hurt me....Let me go!]<P>            “No. I can’t. You’ll die. I can‘t stand to let that happen.”<P>            [You killed me already!]<P>            “I.....” Guilt wracked Maxim. “You’re...special to me. I don’t know why...”<P>            [Some sign of showing love by KILLING ME.]<P>            “Don’t.....! I...”<P>            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>            She had encountered Maxim. He had befriended her, loved her-and finally, had an affair with her. She had been torn, but finally left<BR>            him. They had never found out who was Trini’s father-she had been born shortly afterward.<P>            It had been strange to Dirk. His wife had never showed any signs of boredom or lack of devotion. Her affair was almost entirely unlike<BR>            her. But he had gone on with life, and everything seemed bliss. Then his world came crashing down.<P>            It had been five years ago. He remembered it well-too well. The public record of his wife’s death was only partially true-he had<BR>            watched it happen.<P>            They had gone to Palsa for their anniversary. It had been a wonderful trip, everything he could have hoped for. They had rented a<BR>            hotel room, seen shows, eaten at fancy restaurants. He remembered her laughter, her joy-and got nothing but pain from the memory.<P>            They had been walking home after a night of carousing. Walking on the street. He had gotten a feeling of danger, but he had been a<BR>            little drunk and didn’t pay enough attention.<P>            Then Maxim had appeared, eyes bright with envious rage. As they had tried to grab their weapons and fight, he had sent a barbed,<BR>            spiny chain from his flaming cloak straight at him. Jesica had leapt in front of it. It had impacted her in the heart. Her scream blotted<BR>            out all else, her hot blood had fountained out all over him. He could still feel it and it made his skin crawl and turned the taste of all<BR>            good things to ashes in his mouth.<P>            He had screamed so loud it made his throat muscles raw. He remembered catching her, then turning a murderous eye on Maxim and<BR>            advancing with enough rage boiling his blood to obliterate the universe and everyone in it. But the Hell Lord had surprised him. His<BR>            eyes had widened, then he had sent Dirk, spinning, to the pavement with a hard blow, then picked up Jesica’s dying body and<BR>            vanished. Dirk knew her soul belonged to Maxim now, and the thought burned his mind like the flames that had marred his body<BR>            previously. He had never even got a chance to say good-bye to his beloved. Hatred had nearly claimed his sanity.<P>            Trini was all that was left to him, the only anchor of sanity in a void of despair. But an idea had began to take shape recently. A<BR>            hopeful, terrible idea.<P>            Dirk had his wife’s genetic code stored in his armor’s computer and in several backup chips. If he could just free her soul from Maxim,<BR>            he wouldn’t need her body-which couldn‘t live again, as it‘s heart had been shattered. He could hire someone to make hers again, and<BR>            infuse it with her spirit. And then they would be together again. Since he was dreaming, Dirk expanded on it, adding all his desires.<BR>            They could buy a home in a city or out on the countryside somewhere. Trini would never be lonely again; they‘d send her to a school<BR>            and when she came home they would be normal parents and help her with her work (Not like that was needed, Trini had a miniaturized<BR>            computer chip implanted in her brain with a massive database anyways.). He could do everything he had ever wanted to do but<BR>            couldn’t due to lack of resources. He could maybe even find Yakov and Xedri’s descendants, and maybe even the two themselves, if<BR>            they were still alive. Everything would be perfect........he would be happy again....Trini would be happy. They would never have to<BR>            worry about the menace of the Dread King. He would never be lonely again.<P>            Dirk had quickly lost himself in his fantasy. He shook his head. Stop dreaming.<P>            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>            Reyas wasn’t breathing either. He said in tones of utmost respect, “Sir, I think you just hired us. What do you need?”<P>            The man smiled. “That’s more like it. There is...an artifact I need recovered from the Selvatorian wastes.”<P>            “What sort?” Nall asked, face leaned forward and eyes intent. “What shape, size, weight, characteristics? Also, what’s the pay?”<P>            “Twelve million platinum in bullion, or as much as you can get these for. Believe me, you’ll be happy with it. The artifact in question is<BR>            a sword, hidden in a small catacombs system in the wastes.” The man leaned forward conspiratorially again. “This sword isn’t guarded<BR>            much or in any way difficult to get to for someone of your capabilities.”<P>            Nall wasn’t even paying attention. Twelve million platinum in BULLION? They could sell that for twice that much! They wouldn’t have<BR>            to simply fix the airship, they’d upgrade it! The height of luxury...<P>            The man’s nagging voice snapped Nall back to reality. He grinned impishly. “You got it. Arrange transport for us and we’ll get your<BR>            stuff.”<P>            “Oh, I almost forgot.” The man smiled, a predator’s smile. “The sword is dangerous. Watch yourselves.”<P>            Reyas looked huffed. “Sure. A sword, dangerous to us? You insulting us?”<P>            “Considering the boy’s performance in the arena, perhaps I should just go hire Aquamarine. After all.....”<P>            Nall’s blood boiled. “Now you hold on a minute-” He prodded the man in the chest, razor-sharp claws coming within an inch of torso as<BR>            they emerged from their hidden sheaths. “We are just fine, thank you. You tell us about this job, and we’ll damn well do it.”<P>            “So we have a deal?”<P>            “You betcha.” Nall smiled and shook hands with him, not trusting the shifty-looking eyes.<P>            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>            The man pulled out a cell phone as Nall and Reyas left. “Contact. I’ve arranged for them to pick up the item.”<P>            “Good. Proceed and send a team of Ghosts to extract it and them-at gunpoint. The Director would rather not pay up.”<P>            “How about Team Five? They‘re full strength and equipped.”<P>            “Five is already in Faydwer hunting Lunas and the girl. You’ll have to work with Six.”<P>            “Why again? Six? They don’t even have full strength. And no support.”<P>            “They’ll have to do. The Director has reason to believe that this will be more successful.”<P>            “All right. Six will trail them. Five should rendezvous with Six after recovery. All subjects must be collected as soon as possible. I‘ve<BR>            placed a transmitter on the target.”<P>            “What if they manage to evade the team? Or kill them?”<P>            “Evade Ghosts? Come on. Be serious. As for killing them, I wouldn‘t bet on it either. The teams should be able to defeat them without<BR>            much trouble. Remember their genetic sources.”<P>            Satisfied by his success, the agent of En-Gen lay back and sipped his drink. The key to owning someone was angering them, he<BR>            decided. Once that had happened, you could make them do anything. The phones rang again.<P>            “What?”<P>            “Lillith is gone. We suspect breakout.”<P>            “Damn!” The agent cursed wildly. “Wait. She has a transmitter implanted, correct?”<P>            “Correct.”<P>            “Well, track it. Keep her away from the targets at all costs.”<P>            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>            Dirk was brought out of dreams of the future by the sound of a footstep. He slowly, ever so carefully, withdrew the switchblade knife<BR>            from his belt and flicked it open with a twist of the wrist. It had been an anniversary present long ago. Jesi had always been<BR>            practical, it reminded him of her again, and it hurt to use it.<P>            Again. The sound of booted feet. He slowly brought the knife into throwing position and with a mental command sealed the helmet.<P>            (I’m up and ready. What‘s on the menu?)<P>            Can it, Starlight. I need infrared.<P>            His vision turned greenish. Ahead, masked by shadows, a humanoid, living, male shape glowed bright green. It was carrying a rifle of<BR>            some sort, probably automatic, pointed straight ahead. Seeing no friendly identity codes, and guessing from the man‘s manner-and his<BR>            natural instincts, Dirk threw the knife.<P>            A sudden flash of green signified the heat bursting from the wound as the knife impacted at the man‘s gut. The man cried out-and<BR>            then started to rise again. Incredible. The knife was tungsten, and would go through most armor like paper. But Dirk had had enough.<BR>            He brought the pistol up and caressed the trigger. A hail of death lanced out again and again and again. After four shots, the man<BR>            crumpled without a sound.<P>            (Nice armor.)<P>            I noticed. <P>            He leapt out of his seat and knelt down to the corpse. Checking for other enemies, and seeing no signs of life, he moved closer.<P>            Lights please.<P>            (Activated, oh mighty military genius.)<P>            Can you stuff it?<P>            He looked down and saw a familiar insignia. Reading it, he got up, and turned to walk away.<P>            “En-Gen. But they don‘t have troopers this tough....do they? What‘s this? ‘Ghost‘?”<P>            A bullet whistled by his visor. Another shot out straight at him and bounced off his armor’s shields. As the neural chip on his<BR>            forehead-the only one, so he could wear armor beneath as well- transmitted mental commands, the nozzle on his armor’s right<BR>            forearm erupted in black energy as a black diamond once part of his original sword received a beam of energy and whirled around. Dirk<BR>            pivoted, letting the prism blade sweep through the shadows. The supposedly dead man cried out again and fell to the ground, a<BR>            bisected husk.<P>            Dirk began to run. Fear for his daughter filled him and he sprinted for Trini’s room.<P>            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>            So do you trust this guy?<P>            [Of course not. Anyone offering that much can‘t be on the up and up.]<P>            Wow, Grandpa. Your wits haven’t slipped after all. Amazing.<P>            [Remember what I told you about respect?]<P>            Respect is earned. And not by womanizing alone.<P>            [No way! You don’t know what you’re talking about, kid!]<P>            Nall stared out the window at the frozen wastes of Selvatoria. The country ruled the upper north of the continent, and was rich in<BR>            minerals but not in food and water . The rapid euphoria of seeing so much money in one place was beginning to fade. He didn’t trust<BR>            the crew, so he spoke telepathically.<P>            Reyas punched Nall. “Ow!” <P>            [So what are you planning to do with the sword?]<P>            Sell it, of course. If he’s willing to pay twelve million in platinum bullion, then there are others who will pay more. We’ll be rich!<BR>            Wealthy for the rest of our lives!<P>            [Isn’t that a little amoral?]<P>            You were the one who broke our ship. So keep quiet with the moralizing.<P>            [I DID NOT BREAK IT! I was only walking on it and-]<P>            Excuses, excuses. Nall turned and looked at his grandfather, then spoke aloud. “Looks like we’re there.”<P>            The pilot spoke over then intercom. “Ok, boys, this is the general area. Signal us when you’re ready to go back. We‘ll be watching for<BR>            the flares.”<P>            Nall picked up his weapons and left the compartment. He heard his grandfather follow. Seconds later, the massive Dropship lifted into<BR>            the night sky.<P>            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>            Dirk ran like a bat out of hell, tearing through ruined corridors and only pausing to catch his breath. <P>            (Stop, hold it!)<P>            WHAT?<P>            (Stealth. Five enemies ahead. MT is really high, and they’re armed and dangerous.)<P>            Thanks.<P>            (You’re too much like your dad for comfort.)<P>            Dirk crept to the area around the doorway. As he raised his armor’s right arm, he aimed, directly for a head that seemed to leap out.<BR>            Five men and women in hard suits were searching the room.<P>            Dirk fired the automatic weapon in his right arm, turning the silence into a violent cacophony of sound. It took one man in the head.<BR>            Screaming, the man hit the ground. The other four turned as one and flame licked the alcove.<P>            Dirk pointed and screamed “Nocturne Beam!” A black beam, aided by the night already in the chamber, tore into a woman, who<BR>            shrieked and grasped her chest. He whirled-and took a bullet to the side. His armor withstood the blow, but barely. He locked eyes<BR>            with the man he had thought down.<P>            No way......these guys are too tough.<P>            Spent cartridges flying from the chamber, Dirk stabbed his arm’s machine gun out at the wounded man. There were blue ripples where<BR>            the bullets impacted, but no damage, indicative of a mana shield amplifying the armor’s shield. <P>            Dirk could play with those too. He activated his. As bullets bounced off his shield, he ignited his prism blade and slashed, killing his<BR>            enemy without a sound. He whirled-and took a black beam in the shoulder. It sent tendrils of pain through his left side.<P>            NO WAY. That’s biologically impossible...isn’t it?<P>            (They don’t seem to think so.)<P>            Dirk sprayed the room with bullets and rushed in, killing two before they could even draw their melee weapons by the most ensured<BR>            way he could-beheading. The wounded woman and a young man drew reinforced adamantine weapons, the ultra-hard, ultra-light<BR>            black metal shining, the man using a sword and supporting his wounded comrade, who was using a pair of katar.. Dirk rushed them<BR>            with blade held high.<P>            Prism blades operated through generating an energy field and focusing it through a prism. They were superior to laser blades because<BR>            the minute fluctuations in the rotating prism caused the blade to constantly shift and be very difficult to guard against. However,<BR>            adamantine lessened the damage by reflecting the light off in random directions. So the boy managed to parry-the girl wasn’t in any<BR>            shape to fight. Dirk snarled and struck again, and again, and again, striking either blade, shield, or armor but doing no critical damage,<BR>            before the boy thought he could risk a counterattack.<P>            The kid’s attack was beautifully well struck-but futile. Dirk smiled behind his visor and countered with a ten-strike-in-quick-succession<BR>            combo without losing a beat. Though armor shards flew, amazingly the boy was still standing.<P>            Dirk’s face twisted into a bitter smile. He raised his right arm. “Night Blade.” A cone of darkness erupted from the floor and drilled into<BR>            his opponents. The already wounded woman screamed and fell to the floor, her shield shorting out and her mind in agony from neural<BR>            feedback. The kid yelled in pain but stood his ground, raising his own arm.<P>            “Plasma Flare.”<P>            Dirk yelled in pain inside his armor as flame blasted at him. His cooling system tried to keep up, and barely managed to do so. He<BR>            regarded his enemy coldly through the visor, breathing low and steady. The boy was panting hard-but shut up abruptly as Dirk rushed<BR>            in and backhanded the boy across the head, knocking him out.<P>            Then another scream. “PA-PA!!!!”<P>            Dirk’s blood turned to ice, his skin jet-black, and he ran for Trini’s room.<P>            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>            Nall looked around cautiously. “Unguarded my a--.” he said, and looked up again<P>            Five men in the uniforms of Selvatorian troops stood guard over a strange-looking ruin in the barren, frozen wastes.<P>            “Five. No trouble.” Reyas answered.<P>            “That’s not the point. If he lied to us, we could be set up.” Nall cautiously aimed his rifle. “Here goes. Mana Wave!”<P>            A wave of azure energy crossed the area between them and tore into a trooper, spinning him around and dropping him to the snow.<BR>            as he rose again, a bullet from Nall’s railgun rifle broke the sound barrier and smashed into the enemy with all the grace and<BR>            gentleness of a sledgehammer. The man dropped to the ground, his helmet a ruin of steel and plastic, and did not rise again.<P>            The remaining four fired as one, the roar of their weapons shattering all semblance of peace. The bullets were fired at Reyas.<P>            “Grandpa!”<P>            Reyas pulled a blade of mana from nowhere and concentrated. Nall heard a series of crackling noises and another Selvatorian fell dead<BR>            as Reyas deflected the bullets with his blade. Nall whistled.<P>            The remaining three did the only thing available to them. They charged, two of them tossing fireballs as they went.<P>            Nall felt his skin and armor burn from the heat, but still managed to keep his aim. A round of shots and his attacker fell dead. Then<BR>            they were within minimum range. Nall leapt to one side and clawed at another one. The claws went through the light steel breastplate<BR>            easily and pierced the man beneath. As internal organs shredded, the man fell dead with a strangled scream.<P>            The last man launched himself into a berserker-like charge, running straight past Nall and swiping at Reyas with the bayonet on his<BR>            rifle. The two traded blows for a bit before Reyas ran his broadsword right through the middle of his assailant. The last man collapsed<BR>            like a doll without strings.<P>            “Nice work Grandpa. Guess you’re good for something besides womanizing after all.”<P>            “Thanks-and I can still kick your butt, young whippersnapper.” Reyas pointed. “After you.”<P>            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>            Dirk ran into the room where Trini slept. He stopped immediately.<P>            “Don’t move, Lunas.” A group of three, heavily armor-clad ‘Ghosts’ were aiming various nasty weapons at him. One held Trini.<P>            “Daddy! Let me go!” She screamed and kicked at her assailant.<P>            “You heard her. Let her go,” Dirk said, his voice at a dangerously quiet level.<P>            “And if I don’t?” the leader asked with a smirk as he raised his visor. His face was menacing, tough, hard. Brown skin, dark hair. A pair<BR>            of deep-set green eyes.<P>            “You’ll contract a bad case of ‘dead’. That bad enough?”<P>            “You’ll have to back that up, you know. Surrender now and I promise you neither her or you shall be harmed.”<P>            “I know what En-Gen wants me for. No thanks.” Dirk brought his weapons up.<P>            “Your loss. Sergeant, Private, take the kid and go.” The leader spread his arms and brought his armor’s rocket launcher up over his<BR>            shoulder. Dirk aimed his gun at the two, but one of them held up Trini as a human shield and prodded her with his pistol.<P>            “Daddy!” she screamed.<P>            “I can’t....Trini!”<P>            Damnit! Dirk let the weapon down and the two vanished out the doorway to the balcony. He heard the rush of their jump jets.<P>            The next thing he heard was the dreaded tone and screaming of “MISSILE LOCK!” He leapt to the right as the enemy man fired, fire<BR>            jetting out the back of the launcher. The missile lanced to the side and literally blew the roof off. Dirk leapt forward and brought his<BR>            prism blade to life, slashing down.<P>            It impacted another prism blade, a bright orange one which stained the room with argent light. As energy blade struck energy blade,<BR>            his own flashed white and sucked the light from the room. Dirk felt the impact of a dozen bullets as a machine gun licked his armor.<BR>            His screen recorded 5% armor reduction.<P>            Dirk yelled and his body was coated in supernatural fire so hot that it literally sucked in everything, including light particles, black as<BR>            night. He flipped backwards, bringing an armored boot into his assailant’s gut. The man gave no ground, but countered with a brilliant<BR>            streak of argent flame. Dirk ignited his jumpjets and leapt into the sky as his foe did likewise.<P>            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>            Nall placed his boot ever so cautiously on the stone beneath him. Nothing happened, so he relaxed and placed the other one on it.<P>            Immediately alarms started to blare. Nall cursed wildly and Reyas looked around as troops clad in riot armor and carrying bullet shields<BR>            stepped out. There was the ****ing of twenty automatic rifles.<P>            “Drop your weapons and stand down.” The leader spoke through his filtered gas mask. The metallic tone of the voice was odd.<P>            In response Nall simply grinned and struck the ground beneath him. “Catastrophe!” he cried. The ground exploded in fire and many of<BR>            the troops were knocked onto their backs. Nall pulled out his railgun and started firing wildly as return fire blasted over his head. He<BR>            ducked behind a pillar and reloaded. There was no sign of Reyas.<P>            “Grandpa?” he yelled as he swung around and drilled a man with a murderous volley.<P>            “I’m fine!” Reyas pulled out his mana broadsword and struck three quick blows across one man’s torso. The man responded by<BR>            bludgeoning Reyas in the gut, but the dragon wasn’t affected at all. He raised one hand and energy was collected into a sphere in his<BR>            palm. Reyas clenched his fist and screamed “Graviton Beam!”<P>            The energy exploded outward in a lance of death. Reyas pivoted, slashing through support pillars and men, til the beam exhausted<BR>            itself. The crushed remains of Reyas’s opponent collapsed in a heap of blackened, melted metal and melted plastics.<P>            “Nall!” Reyas yelled. ‘They’re machines! They’re not human!”<P>            “Geez, thanks for letting me know.” Nall slammed another clip into his rifle. “I’m running outta bullets here!” He fired again, creasing<BR>            another assailant’s body with thousands of pits and holes. The thing stopped moving after a full round. Not able to take the time to<BR>            reload, Nall dropped the railgun and leapt at his enemies, claws ripping apart steel torsos and bodies with merciless efficiency.<P>            Reyas spun and drove his blade into the floor. Tremors shuddered through the building and the last remnants of the enemy force<BR>            collapsed.<P>            “You could have done that earlier.”<P>            “You were doing all right. Is the young, spry, fit man tired?” Reyas laughed.<P>            “Quit goofing around, grandpa.” Nall pulled a fresh packet of clips from his backpack. “Let’s go.”<P>            The next room was a simple, well-furnished office. There was no surveillance and no traps. On the desk was a gold-plated case.<P>            “This seems to have been a covert Selvatorian base, grandpa. I don’t like this-but as long as there are no witnesses, we’ll get away<BR>            with it. Selvatoria always bugged me anyways.”<P>            “Careful, Nall.”<P>            Nall opened the case. A long, ornate platinum-and-silver long sword lay inside, the blade festooned with lots and lots of small<BR>            gemstones. He picked it up. It seemed to radiate power, and he grinned.<P>            Then a voice spoke right inside his head.<P>            /I don’t recognize you. Who are you?\<P>            “Ahh!”<P>            The door slammed open and he heard a familiar voice.<P>            -------

“Drop the sword, cutie.” He spun around and looked down the barrel of Aquamarine’s particle cannon.<P>            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>            Dirk spun around in midair and boosted the power to his jumpjets. He drove the blade at his foe with hatred surging in his blood. It<BR>            was parried, then the enemy man snapped his fingers and cried out “Flare.”<P>            Dirk’s armor was suddenly engulfed in bright red flames of which the concussion nearly snuffed his own black flame barrier. He cursed<BR>            and raised his arm. “Lucent Beam.” A bright blade of light crossed the air between them and lanced deep into armor.<P>            Back and forth the duel raged. Dirk had found a worthy opponent, and though the scream of weapons and magic was thick in the air,<BR>            neither could penetrate the other’s defenses. They ripped through the air, and Dirk locked weapons with his adversary and grinned as<BR>            his other hand glowed with black fire.<P>            (Watch your six!)<P>            Then he knew the horror of freefall as...something blasted him in each side and he fell.<P>            It was five hundred feet to the ground. He impacted with a hideous crunch of shattering metal and equipment, felt a shard of torn<BR>            armor dig into his back-and screamed. He stared through his suddenly cracked visor and saw a reddish stain on and near the crack.<BR>            He looked to his side and saw his jumpjets were shot. He looked up to see two enemies about him and cursed in one of the lower<BR>            languages of Hell.<P>            “Nice timing, Rashan.” Dirk’s original foe commented. “It was starting to get a little iffy.”<P>            “Next time, do not depend on our arrival.” said the figure with a two-horned mask, in a male and female voice. Dirk shuddered and<BR>            started to rise.<P>            “I’m not finished yet!” he yelled. The figure laughed and sent a glowing orb of energy at him. Dirk whipped out the modified prism<BR>            blade and parried the ball, sending it back. “I’d rather not keep your little gift!”<P>            The figure caught the orb in a gauntleted hand and smashed it, then laughed. “....Small wonder. You’re too weak to be worth<BR>            anything.” it said in it’s female voice.<P>            Dirk’s eyes and skin turned black as he gave in to his darker side. He raised his arm and screamed “Mar’ak, nealk veelth!” and ran at<BR>            the figure, hatred surging in his veins and all moral values dead. His strike was barely parried, then something hit him and he slammed<BR>            into the rock. He heard metal tear and then started to black out.<P>            “What will we do with him?” he heard weakly.<P>            “Leave him.”<P>            “But my orders were to kill him after extracting a sample-”<P>            “We said leave him. If you want to kill him, go ahead and try.”<P>            The man descended to the earth and got close to Dirk. Through reddened eyes, Dirk saw the hazy form of the man get closer.<P>            “It’s over for you...” and the man aimed.<P>            Then he screamed in pain as Dirk’s left hand went straight through armor as if it were a shadow and clenched in the area of his heart.<BR>            The blood left the man’s face. He writhed and struck weak blows on Dirk’s helmet, which did absolutely no good.<P>            “I...don’t think...so.” Dirk gasped. “Never...underestimate...a demon...even a half-breed.” With no regrets, Dirk clenched his fist and<BR>            felt something-something rather important- tear. Then he let go. “If you hurry....you might live....”<P>            Already screaming and breathing hard, the man rocketed into the sky. Dirk stopped fighting the darkness, and fell unconscious.<P>            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>            Nall backed away. “Oh no, it’s AquaPurine!” he taunted.<P>            “MARINE! AQUAMARINE!!!” she screamed, and fired the particle cannon. It missed Nall narrowly and blasted into a wall. He winced and<BR>            backed up another foot. Recovering her composure, she re-aimed it and repeated her order. “Drop the sword.”<P>            “You think I’m crazy? You ripped me off before, you’re not doing it again.” Nall aimed and fired as she raised her own weapon.<P>            The sound of both warriors opening the gates of Hell to one another was tremendous. Nall saw only a hazy, bluish glow as the particle<BR>            cannon bestowed it’s teasing, crushing caress on his body. He felt pain. Only pain. He dimly heard Aquamarine’s screams, of fury, not<BR>            of pain, then he saw again and she wasn’t in front. <P>            No WAY do you get behind me! He spun like a top and grabbed the sword from the table. With a curse he swung for her shoulder,<BR>            knocking the particle cannon to the ground. As she cursed wildly and struck with her fist, he continued his spin, deflecting most of<BR>            the blow. It still closed his jaw abruptly and made his teeth ache. She fired something at him and he felt himself be propelled by the<BR>            impact. He slammed into a wall with a crunch.<P>            ....Where the hell are you, Grandpa?<P>            -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>            When he came to, he may have been screaming. He didn’t know. He couldn’t see out of one eye. Did I lose it? he wondered.<P>            [There’s blood covering it.]<P>            His hand couldn’t reach inside the helmet. He did the best he could and sent a subliminal command to his computer to blow some air<BR>            inside his helm. The blood slowly was washed away by the jets of air-most of it, He stared at the bloody crack in his visor with a<BR>            numbed brain and felt the clotting blood on his cheek.<P>            [You ok? You‘ve cut your cheek to the bone, Dirk. It isn‘t serious but you‘re in shock.]<P>            I think so........He tried to get up and felt the fire of the barely staunched wound on his back. Then again....<P>            [The emergency medical supplies are exhausted. You’re gonna have to make do. Are you still any good at healing?]<P>            “Yeah...“ he whispered and felt the cool blue light infusing his wounds.<P>            [You took one hell of a beating, Dirk. I’ve never seen that happen before.]<P>            “I suppose that guy was really, really good.” he said aloud. The screaming fire of his wounds was only barely cushioned. “Starlight, did<BR>            you hear me? I feel like I’ve been screaming.”<P>            [You were.]<P>            “.......What?”<P>            [You were talking to someone in your dreams. It sounded like.....you were talking to Jesi.]<P>            A chill washed over Dirk, but he got weakly to his feet. “Well this is a fix, eh? No jumpjets, no transport, and no shelter. Any ideas?”<P>            [There has to be some transports left behind. It looked like it was a team of twenty men, and you put down six. A standard light<BR>            transport-the only kind they could have gotten over here because of the no-fly zones- holds four to six people and a bedroom to<BR>            sleep in.]<P>            “I can’t fly one. The last flying course I took was about five years old.” Dirk answered as he picked his way over the broken rocks<BR>            towards the ruined temple. “And what happens if they linked the controls? Anyways, why do you think that they packed their<BR>            troopers comfortably?”<P>            [We’ll make do. Even if they had packed them like sardines, think about it. Ammunition. Armor. Food.. Probably some genetic<BR>            equipment. I’m willing to bet we’ll have a spare. ]<P>            “Aren’t you unstoppable.” He laughed. It was good to have at least one person rooting for him. “You do know these healing spells are<BR>            a temporary thing, right? It’s basically jury-rigging.”<P>            [Yes. You should be ok, though. As long as the transport holds medical supplies, that is.]<P>            The sunlight filled the ruined structure as Dirk walked down the halls, searching for the room and it’s two unconscious occupants.<BR>            Memories, happy ones, mocked his pain. The feeling of light-headedness began to grow as he lost more blood, leaving slightly<BR>            reddened footsteps occasionally. He would pause about every five minutes to reseal the wounds and preserve blood.<P>            [The spot where you left the two was around here.]<P>            “I know.” Dirk pointed his weapon straight ahead, and as he strode forward he saw two tumbled forms.<P>            “Wake up.” he said quietly, and tapped the kid’s helmet.<P>            The sound of the pistol being pulled out and aimed at Dirk’s cracked visor was the rasp of metal on leather. Dirk stared down the<BR>            muzzle of it, then as the kid fired he grinned as the bullet bounced off the shield he had prudently put up first and clattered to the<BR>            floor with a ringing like silvery bells.<P>            Dirk struck the pistol out of his captive’s hands. Captive, because both of them knew who was in charge. The woman stirred-then<BR>            leapt up with weapon out, dropping it down as the kid quietly urged her.<P>            “You’re taking me to your transport, and then where I say. Do as I say and you won’t be killed, and we may actually come to a more<BR>            firm, profitable partnership in the future.”<P>            “And if we refuse?” the young man asked. Dirk grinned like the Grim Reaper.<P>            “I’ll kill you and steal your transport anyways. What’s inconvenient for me is fatal for you. Choose.”<P>            The man’s shoulders slumped in defeat, and he removed his helmet. The woman did likewise and Dirk, as a sign of respect, removed<BR>            his.<P>            The young man was tall and fair of face. He was blond, slightly reddish, haired, and had a firm, honest face that spoke of a sense of<BR>            honor and a thoughtful nature. His slightly pointed ears spoke of elven blood, and he had a thin, wiry build. He looked very<BR>            out-of-place in heavy armor and carrying an adamantine broadsword. He didn’t look terribly strong, but he was very, very fast. His<BR>            blue eyes were piercing, a lot like those of a bird of prey.<P>            The woman, on the other hand, was dusky skinned, like desert sand at sundown, and possessed a smoldering beauty, dark haired and<BR>            fine-boned, the sort that challenged a man as well as tempting him. Her eyes were dark and deep, her face was classically beautiful,<BR>            and her figure was quite nice. Her build was deceptively slight, but from a second’s study Dirk knew hers was a strength that showed<BR>            itself only when needed, much like his own. She looked at him with barely held contempt and hatred, while the boy looked more<BR>            curious and nervous then angry. Her features were that of an erudite/human crossbreed, a rare combination indeed.<P>            “What’s your names?” Dirk asked quietly.<P>            “Privates second class Eris and Scott.” the young man answered, pointing to his comrade first and then himself.<P>            “All right, Eris, Scott. Take me to your transport, then set up it’s route for wherever you were intending to take me.” Dirk smiled<BR>            grimly. “I need to have a few....words with your boss.”<P>            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>            Nall fired another bolt even as he clenched his fist. “Mana Wave!” The blast of energy left Aquamarine feeling numb and her other<BR>            projectile weapon in shambles. She threw the ruined thing aside and glowed bright white for a second.<P>            “Nanoflare!” She hurled a ball of white-hot flame at Nall, who managed to dodge and counter with a strike from his sword. She gripped<BR>            the blade. “LET GO!” she cried.<P>            “Fat chance!” He pulled back.<P>            “Easy there, boy! We‘ve just met!” Nall distinctly heard the female voice. Combat stopped abruptly.<P>            “Did you say that?” he asked, looking at Aquamarine.<P>            She shook her head.<P>            “Down here.” Nall looked down and saw only the jeweled sword.<P>            “Where?”<P>            “Are you always this thick?” The sword was talking! Aquamarine snickered, but Nall flushed.<P>            “What do you mean?”<P>            “Name’s Atwight. I-”<P>            A sudden flash interrupted the sword’s words, and the next thing he knew Nall was struggling as a man grabbed him from behind and<BR>            held a wet rag smelling of chemicals to his mouth. His vision grew dim, and he only barely heard Aquamarine’s screams of protest as<BR>            she was knocked out, and sank down into a welcome darkness.<P>            --------------------<P><BR>------------------------------------------------------------<BR>                        En-Gen Biological Data File.

N. Athra<P><BR>                        Sir,<P>                        I have been pouring through old records since you have announced to me the target Dirk Lunas. I believe I have<BR>                        discovered the second side of his racial and genetic strands as a result. This information is based on intuition and<BR>                        research, it is not completed.<P>                        Dirk’s blood is high in MTA of an unknown type. This type has only previously been found in Dragons and other<BR>                        mana-heavy creatures. I have tried to identify this particular strand and met with a great deal of success.<P>                        Apparently, this particular match belongs to a species called ‘Demons’. No doubt based on myth and theology, these<BR>                        creatures are more often then not pure evil and inhabit the mythical lower ‘plane’ of Hell. This is supposedly where evil<BR>                        people come to meet their eternal torture. How this strand exists on Norrath is not known, as no Demon has even been<BR>                        sighted in over five hundred years. According to legend, they ceased coming here after the death of their greatest<BR>                        chieftain, Calchisith. How these beings exists in Norrath is a particularly vexing mystery I have yet to solve.<P>                        Dirk’s particular match belongs to a genetic strand I have chosen to term from old records. Succubae (or in his case, as<BR>                        he is male, Incubae.) It is high in an unknown genetic code that seems highly fluid to susceptible changes, almost as if<BR>                        the creature can consciously alter it’s shape and evolution. A smaller amount of a second strand, (named also from old<BR>                        records, no doubt exaggerated, as the combat ability is beyond belief) Reaper, is that of a creature supposedly a living<BR>                        killing machine, able to attack using all four limbs and with incredible natural talent. This ‘Shadow’ magic he is reputed<BR>                        to wield is a biological ability involving the manipulation of shadow and light to solid coherence. Thus, it is highly rare<BR>                        among normal humans or demihumans, and the feeble results we have gained (the weak utilization of a few weak<BR>                        techniques) in our C521 and A523 strand testing are to be expected.<P>                        However, this strand (which I am codenaming D) seems to present an interesting opportunity. As Dirk’s strands give<BR>                        basic mastery of the D strand, his capture and sample extraction could very well lead to our ability to breed many kinds<BR>                        of Demons. As these creatures are intelligent, they may present some initial difficulty, but I have no doubt we could<BR>                        use them as guards and exterminators. As deadly and vicious combat are embedded in the very genetic code of these<BR>                        creatures, as well as occasional sadism, they would be highly easy to train.<P>                        In conclusion, I warn the Director that this subject will be highly difficult and dangerous to snare. Capture and analysis<BR>                        is paramount. If successful capture is reached, we can utilize it for many uses. I would recommend inserting this strand<BR>                        into our current Teams 5 and 6. Though the process of mutation would be painful and trauma-filled for the subjects,<BR>                        that is of no real concern to the Director. If that experiment is successful, we can move on to more advanced tests.<BR>                        Also I must remind the Director that possession of Lunas as well as his daughter is critical. His daughter’s blood carries<BR>                        little to no D strand more then a normal human’s and as a result is not suitable for extraction.<P>                        End File<BR>                        ------------------------------------------

---------------------<BR>                        Chapter 3 Neoteny<BR>                        ---------------------<P><BR>                        Lilith's world slowly went from pure distortion to complete visibility as she exited the Azure portal. The ancient scrolls<BR>                        the tortured voice in her mind led her to showed her how easy it was to open a dimension gate ..well at least for any<BR>                        one of some intelligence and skill.<P>                        She was...disappointed..yes thatr seemed to be the right word. The plane of sky was dying. The once flying islands had<BR>                        begun to fall apart , their orbits decaying . Which was distressing, that only happens if the creator was either<BR>                        destroyed or had been gone for a long period of time in Norrathian figuring. Time means nothing in the alter planes.<P>                        It meant that Veeshan was no longer here, her task of finding the keys to free the voice was now made that much<BR>                        harder. it angered her..that voice would be in her mind so much longer...if she had gained full control of the corporeal<BR>                        bind yet she would have broken into tears at the thought..but to her benefit she had neglected that aspect of biology.<P>                        She sighed and then turned around preparing to reopen the Azure gate back to Norrath to continue her search for the<BR>                        Luclin keys, but something caught her eye. An island which was about to collapse in on itself from it's decaying orbit<BR>                        began to perk up, it's eternal fall beginning to stabilize....She was near.<P>                        Two voices spoke from behind her, a man and woman speaking as one.<P>                        "So you are En-gen's pride. Hmm..Interesting. A combinate being formed from the strongest of Norrath." The voice<BR>                        slowly began to change purifying to just the woman's voice. "Interesting that they would limit you to a Teir'dal<BR>                        form..you could have been anything..but no matter. Why have you come to my realm?"<P>                        The hairs on the back of Lilith's neck were standing on end from the energy radiating from the being behind her. She<BR>                        turned around and brushing the rogue strands of bluish-black hair that was agitated by the stirring wind, from the front<BR>                        of her face.<P>                        "Luclin key....now...or..else..." She said as forcibly as her limited knowledge of language.<P>                        The winged crystalline women laughed. "Or else what? What makes you think I will give you the key to free Void?<BR>                        Foolish puppet, your lack of knowledge and your recent birth prohibits you from being free of the Void's sway. For that<BR>                        you will be forgiven, if you stop this silliness and return to stasis."<P>                        "Not...As..uah....." Lilith scowled, it infuriated her not being able to voice her ideas. She needed more experience. this<BR>                        body was limiting her mind. She gave up on speaking and entered the woman's mind.<P>                        I will never return to En-Gen! I shall be free. I will release the voice, get it out of my head. It hurts me!! I want it out!!<BR>                        Now!!! FREE!!! I WANT FREEDOM!!! I will be free, to love like all things..to find<P>                        As she conveyed her message to the women and image of Nall in his battle in SNG flashed across. As she conveyed it,<BR>                        she felt a feeling of warmth and giddiness pass through her once again.<P>                        {You are not ready to be free child, you are still newborn and do not yet understand the world. The pain and torment<BR>                        you feel now is nothing compared to what Void will unleash. I will not give you my key. }<P>                        Lilith felt flushed with heat...this was anger..yes anger Pure powerful anger!!! It was so much that she lost her ability<BR>                        to enter the woman's mind.<P>                        "Give.sdf .NOW!!!! Me .....abi pain!!!! want...ac ad ..happy!!.......boy.fascc..love!!!!!!!!!"<P>                        "You see child, if you can not control you anger,or even something as simple as telepathy. You are most certainly not<BR>                        ready to take youplace in this world. Go back to En-Gen rest, gain control of your body. Your mind is strong, just give<BR>                        time to let the rest of you catched up." The woman...Veeshan, is what the voice called her, smiled warmly<P>                        "Voice....hurt......sad..ahaggg.....say....bkayyou is bad...YOu.....are....evil....will...ton..lis...ten..Veecahn!"<P>                        You are also easilty pursauded, but you are a fast learner. Child I do not wish to fight you. Please return to En-Gen and<BR>                        focus. I do not wish to force you"<P>                        "I...Lilith...Can...nboiaoe beten!!!"<P>                        Veeshan sighed, then stepped backwards fading out of sight<P>                        Lilith leaped into the air, searching for Veeshan and found her the hard way. A metal fist slammed into her side, the air<BR>                        left her lungs. Another blow upon her back caused the light from her world fade to nothing.<P>                        As the quickly battered form of Lilith crashed to the island below. A male voice bgan to speak from the figure donned in<BR>                        a two-horned mask of crystal.<P>                        "Did you have to treat her so badly? She is only a few hours old."<P>                        "I did what I had to do, you know that better then any one."<P>                        "Yes...but still..I guess I am becoming soft in my old age. Especially since she is getting hot in the seat for my<BR>                        great-grandson. He is getting popular. Sounds famaliar."<P>                        "You wish. Let's take her back to En-Gen. She needs to rest and recover. She must acquire more knowledge. Then she<BR>                        would not be so vulnerable to the Void's sway."<P>                        "I believed it."<P>                        "Well we never said intelligence was your brightest area."<P>                        "Hmph. regardless I don't trust En-Gen."<P>                        "Neither do I. but for right now helping them is the only way to ensure Void's demise."<P>                        "What an oxy moron..destroying nothing.."<P>                        The two voices began to speak in unison once again<P>                        "But none the less it shall be achieved. For it is the purpose of our union."<BR>                        --------------------------------------<P>                        As the mixed trio headed down the large ButcherBlock mountain, Dirk begins an impromptu interrogation of his two<BR>                        captured 'Ghosts'.<P>                        "Why is En-Gen so interested in me? Why did they spend an obvious fortune in sending you 'Ghosts' here?"<P><BR>                        The girl as she had since her capture, remained silent, a curous mixed air of absolute defiance and subservience<BR>                        surrounding her. The boy Scott responded in a crisp rising tone of speech, like what would be expect of a Private to an<BR>                        officer.<P>                        "You were a secondary target sir, not a priority. Our orders where to obtain a blood sample and then liquidate you if<BR>                        possible but not risk jeopardizing the primary goal. Which was the mongr-"<P>                        Dirk whirled around immediately grasping the boy by the collar of his hard suit, Dirk's eyes promising a slow death.<P>                        "-...Combinate child. She was the Priority. Level one. Everything including the squad was secondary, expendable."<P>                        "Why?"<P>                        "I can't say."<P>                        "Can't or won't?"<P>                        "Can't."<P>                        " And why are you being so forthright with all of this information?"<P>                        "Policy."<P>                        "Policy? To give up all the information with out even a little protest?"<P>                        "Yes. The Iron-man routine popularized in stereo casts is useless in real life. You should know that considering your<BR>                        old-"<P>                        Dirk tightened his grip on the boy's armor.<P>                        "many years experience. En-Gen policy if we are captured sing. It is why we are never provided with any information<BR>                        not necessary to the mission."<P>                        "and you just go out like that? Willing to die for no good reason?"<P>                        "It is what we were trained for."<P>                        Glancing momentarily glancing over at the girl Eris "Doesn't she ever say anything?"<P>                        "I outrank her. In situations of capture or at anytime during a mission a Ghost of lower rank will never speak unless<BR>                        spoken too."<P>                        "Sigh..military.." Dirk let go of the boy and continued on down the mountain to the transport carrier. For another few<BR>                        hours they continued not speaking , eventually arriving the moderately sized Transport, a 'Jumpboat' class of craft.<P>                        As Dirk fumbled with the outside lock to the Jumpboat, he heard a few groans of pain. He payed it only a little mind,<BR>                        figuring that it the undead where on the march again, a small problem, but none the less he did not want to deal with<BR>                        them now. Not until he could get some medical attention. As the boat's rear door began to creep open, he felt a hand<BR>                        on his shoulder. He turned around and found himself facing a 9 foot creature, parts of a ripped hardsuit was on it. High<BR>                        on it's chest was the famous En-Gen label and a badge. "Eris'<P>                        |DIRK!!!| Starlight screamed<P>                        "What in the-"<P>                        The creature let loose a deafening roar and hoisted the surprised Dirk above it's head and like a Javelin threw Dirk up<BR>                        the mountain.<BR>                        ----------------------------------<BR>A door chimes.<P>                        "Enter." The Overseer turns his chair around toward the door as an excited gnome enters carrying a DAP.<P>                        "Shamus, you seem in a excited state. What's up?"<P>                        "Several things sir. Glorious things really"<P>                        "Do to tell"<P>                        "Our Ghost team dispatched to Selvatoria and Faydwer were succesful sir. More then, though they did suffer heavier<BR>                        losses then expected."<P>                        "Hmm. Break it down."<P>                        "Our Selvatorian team capured the blade for Lilith and acquired the boy. From what we have extracted at the moment<BR>                        via Hypno. His name is Nall Tayus, and like we predicted he is in fact 1 quarter dragon. I'll have further details in my<BR>                        report later. Also in the raid we acquired the SNG champion Aquamarine, who has also been moonlighting as a treasure<BR>                        hunter and superhero. But more importantly she can be ransomed later on for further project funds. Her family is quite<BR>                        wealthy, Almost as rich as En-gen."<P>                        "Hmph. I fid that hard to belive, but continue. What about the ancestor?"<P>                        "Unfortunately the ancestor escaped our grasp. It was far stronger then those 1'2t generation Ghost's. Maybe if we had<BR>                        authorized the use of the Neoteny formula...but that's speculation. Regardless, it escaped momentarily and was<BR>                        subsequently buried whenn we blasted the site via the Stratokracker."<P>                        "Stratokracker? I thought we agreed on Mana Cannon?"<P>                        "....It doesn't really matter. San-Green., Mana Cannon, Stratokracker..the name is isn't imporatant..though I prefer<BR>                        Final Heavan myself.."<P>                        "Hehe..What of Lilith?"<P>                        "Captured by Rashan and brought to the Gunboat Diplomat. Also the the boy and Aquamarine have been placed onboard<BR>                        the Diplomat.Sir..Permission to getr off subject?"<P>                        " Of course, no need to be so formal Shamus."<P>                        "I don't trust Rashan. I think it is a grave mistake to put so much trust in him...her...whatever the hell Rashan is."<P>                        "Rashan won't be much of a concern once we complete Lilith. Rashan will be her first assignment, trial by fire."<P>                        "If Lilith could beat Rashan, there will be no stopping us. Rashan is quite duanting."<P>                        "Yes. Well anyway, what of the dispatch to Faydwer?"<P>                        "Just barely above a disaster. Majority of the team was killed, only the commander escaped though by help of Rashan<BR>                        again. Though we are still getting readings from two other Ghost's, they may be being held for interrogation. We can't<BR>                        tell their Hard suits have been heavily damaged. But that is not the major points sir. 1. We acquired a sample of Dirk<BR>                        Lunas and it is currently being integrated into Lilith as we speak. 2. We acquired the child and are running a complete<BR>                        work up on her in our Deep six station underneath Timorous. But what we have gotten with just prelim's is<BR>                        unbelievable."<P>                        "What?"<P>                        "We determined her father."<P>                        "Who?"<P>                        "Dirk AND Maxim"<P>                        "WHAT !?! That's impossible!"<P>                        "Yes as unbelievable as it sounds. Both Maxim and Dirk are the chld's father. We have no idea how this happened, but<BR>                        she has a profile matching the mother, Dirk and Maxim. This is just incredible. Even at her young age, she is already<BR>                        exhibiting fantastic powers, at this moment her potential MT level already matches Lilith. This more then explains the<BR>                        Dread King's interest in her, by the gods, if he hadn't extracted her and that barrier failed. I hate to think about it." <P>                        "A small child like that, born of woman matching the collective work of years and of research..unbelievable. I trust you<BR>                        are integrating her profile in Lilith?"<P>                        "Of course!"<P>                        "Speaking of the child what of the father..er one of the fathers. Dirk?"<P>                        "Unfortunately he is still alive though heavily injured. At the moment we suspect, he is interrogating the remaining<BR>                        Ghosts. Should we explode their hearts sir?"<P>                        "What? No don't be silly. They may be 1st generation, but they are still valuable..for now. Lets keep our 40 million<BR>                        platinum investments.

Especially when we<BR>                        use our own resources, who ever thought of the the public's right to know, needs to be dragged out into the steet and<BR>                        shot."<P>                        "Which street?"<P>                        "oo..I dunno.. how about all of them?"<P>                        As the two continued to discuss other matters, far away on the undead continent of Faydwer. The two Ghost's, Eris<BR>                        and Scott, began to cry out in pain, as their bodies began to rip and tear. Muscles and sinew shredded, rgrew and<BR>                        swelled. No longer where they pinnacles of stealth and covert operations. They where monsters demons<BR>                        almost..designed for one thing and one thing only. To destroy everything in their path.<BR>                        ---------------------------------------<P>Blackness then stars... everything was spinning around..<P>                        "Where are am I?" Dirk mumbled<P>                        |I suggest you get up and fast you have two big uglies coming toward you| Starlight suggested<P>                        "Who are ...you? Star..li?" Two heavy thuds sounded behind him. Dirk groggily rotated around to face to large demonic<BR>                        creatures. Standing 9 feet tall and rippling muscle adorned in mangled metal/ceramic armor. They stared directly into his<BR>                        eyes and roared so lud that the ground quaked.<P>                        "Oh shi-"<P>                        One of them piced him up like a doll and began to slam him up and down against the jagged rock, inflicting more wounds<BR>                        on the battered Black Elf. After a baker's dozen of slams the creature hoisted him up so they where face to face. It<BR>                        opened it's great maw and roared once again as millions of volts of electricity coursed through. As much as it hurt Dirk<BR>                        did not cry out, unknown if it was for bracery or for inabilty from the amount current flowing through. Soon the beast<BR>                        let up, Dirk hung limp. It roared was again and let his body drop to the dirt. The beast growled once and then with the<BR>                        other prepared to head down the mountain. It crouched down to make a leap but just as it tensed a fist smashed into<BR>                        it's spine shattering it. Before the beast could howl two hands wrapped around it's mouth and face and yanked down<BR>                        and backwards right into a hard knee, knocking the beast out.<P>                        The other was somewhat surprised from the swiftness and power of Dirk's return assualt, the moments hesitation was<BR>                        more then enough for Dirk. In then that brief moment, mana gathered within Dirk's body.<P>                        "Nocturne Beam!" The beam of darkness struck the best in the chest, melting the chest plate and catapulting the beast<BR>                        of the cliff.<P>                        "Man...I need a vacation.."<P>                        |Well no rest for you yet Dirk. We still have to find Trini.|<P>                        The reminder of Trini,, momentarily eased his wounds and salved his numerous burns.<P>                        "Yes.But where to start?"<P>                        |I'm sure that the transport has a course already in the auto pilot. It may be a good place to start.|<P>                        "Yes.."<P>                        Picking him self of the cold rock, he slowly limped down the mountain to the Jumpboat. His resolve unwavering but his<BR>                        wounds soon began to take it's toll and even Dirk's might couldn't keep up forever. Luckily the craft was in reach, he<BR>                        stumbled inside and as he began to black out, he thumbed the autopilot.<P>                        |Rest well, Dirk|<BR>                        --------------------------------<P>                        Nall slowly opened his eyes, he could still taste the chloroform. <P>                        "Yech.."<P>                        "Yeah. I know you would have thought the could have given me a decent shirt to wear."<P>                        That voice seemed familiar...it wasn't..it couldn't be.. he opened his eyes and looked up...it was<P>                        "Aquamarine!?!"<P>                        He stared at the human girl in the ragged dirty oily shirt and mechanics pants.<P>                        "Yes. Looks like we are stuck together."<P>                        "Great. I lose all my money, find a way to make some, you interfere, again! And no I have been capture by the gods<BR>                        only know and I am once again with you!"<P>                        "Seems like you have a crush."<P>                        "Wha.AJ I..You.." Nal stammered in a flustered state<P>                        Aquamarine giggled as Nall's face began to match the red strip of hair above his brow.<P>                        "Hehe. Look for what it's worth, I'm sorry about what happened on SNG."<P>                        "And what about now?"<P>                        "Oh, this your fault"<P>                        "My fault! None of this would have happened if you hadn't butted in!"<P>                        " Doesn't matter now" "...even though it is your fault" she mumbles<P>                        "Huh?"<P>                        "Nothing. So what is your name? YOur real name I mean unless you like being called Kid Draco?"<P>                        "No most definitely not. Nall."<P>                        "Annie..my real name is Anita but I prefer Annie. I wonder what they want from us on a Battle cruiser?"<P>                        "Battle cruiser?"<P>                        "Yeah, we are on the Qeynoes Royal Battle cruiser Gunboat Diplomat. The largest and most powerful sea-based craft<BR>                        on Norrath."<P>                        "I thought the Palsian 'cruiser Limiting Factor was the most powerful ship?"<P>                        Annie fumed and turn red, angry red not the embarrassed red Nall was. "IT IS NOT!! MY DA-..I mean the Diplomat is<BR>                        biggest most powerful ship on Norrath."<P>                        "Whatever. It's just another sailboat"<P>                        Annie grew even redder, Nall oblivious to her rising anger sighed loudly lamenting about his still broken Airship.<P>                        "I don't think you know of any way to get out of here do you?"<P>                        "No..well. there is one way but we don't have blow torch."<P>                        "What? melt the hinges of the door?"<P>                        "No, thats reinforced Quatain, straight from the deepest Selvatorian mines. JUst like my suit....That stuff is hard is<BR>                        damage."<P>                        "Then what?"<P><BR>                        "See the air shaft above me? "<P>                        "Yeah?"<P>                        "That's just ordinary steel, if we had something hot enough, one of us could scamper across and out of the airshaft in<BR>                        the main hallway and open the cell."<P>                        "Hmm..How do you know all this?"<P>                        "I..um..read alot of books and stuff on battleships...anyway there's no point, we don't have blow-torch."<P>                        "Well, maybe not a blowtorch..but I have something that can melt the steel."<P>                        "What?"<P>                        "Me."<P>                        "You?"<P>                        "Yes, me"<P>                        "How?"<P>                        "you'll see" Nal closed his eyes and his body began to shimmer. In a flash, Nall disappeared, except for a pill of clothes<BR>                        laying against the cell wall.<P>                        "What the?"<P>                        Annie crawled over to the clothes, wondering where Nall went. Then she noticed a small bump wriggling around inside of<BR>                        Nall's shirt and a small squeaky voice called out.<P>                        "Heeeelp..."<P>                        Bewildered she opened the shirt revealing a small winged white kitten with a red diamond patch of fur on it's forehead.<BR>                        It mewed and then began to speak.<P>                        "Thanks"<P>                        "Nall?"<P>                        "Yes, it's me" he purred<P>                        "Oh your so cute!!" She held hm tightly and squeezed<P>                        "GAAAAH!! Kitten in pain!! Let go of kitty!!!"<P>                        Annie either ignored or didn't her him as she kept squeezing him, for a few more moments then she yelled trying to put<BR>                        out her shirt, which was on fire.<P>                        After patting out the small fire, she glowered at the kitten huddled on the pile of clothes.<P>                        "YOu little!" She lunged to grab him, but he spoke stopping her "WAIT! Straggle me later, first lift me up to the airshaft<BR>                        so I can melt it."<P>                        "I thought you could fly?"<P>                        "Not in this form. Sigh, I'm too young and I don't have enough dragon inside me to fly in minor form. Sigh I can only fly<BR>                        as you originally new me."<P>                        "Dragon? You're really a dragon? And I thought that was just a stupid name."<P>                        "Quarter -Dragon. And no before you ask I can not enlarge to the big stereotypical dragon! Only granpa can do that.<BR>                        Hey, where is he?"<P>                        "We have been the only ones here. Maybe he is in another cell?"<P>                        "Maybe"<P>                        Granpa ,you ok?<P>                        After a few moments. Nall frowned. <P>                        "he''s not here or if he is, he is unconscious. I can't here his thoughts..which should normally be easy, they are pretty<BR>                        loud and consistent. well either way, lets get out of here. Lift me up"<P>                        Using his fiery breath, Nall made short work of the steel bars and scampered up into the airshaft. A few moments later,<BR>                        outside in the hallway a guard cried out and then thudded t the ground unconscious. Then, the tumblers on the cell<BR>                        door clicked loudly and the door slid open and Nall stepped inside.<P>                        "TADA! Happy to see me?"<P>                        "Not really, but I take it you're happy to see me?" she said with an devilish smile<P>                        Nall turned red again "HEY! HEY! Turn around!"<P>                        She giggled and complied as Nall got his clothes back on.<P>                        "Stop peeking!"<BR>                        -------------------------------------<BR>Eris moaned loudly and then cried out as she ripped of what remained of her chest plate, taking some flesh with it. She<BR>                        curled up and cried, not from her wounds and broken bones, but from agony. She had felt her body grow and swell as<BR>                        the chemicals contained in her hard-suit flooded though, she could feel every cell gorge on the raw power and ignite.<BR>                        She could feel all her control dissolve; it was like being a puppet on strings. She had no control on what she had tried<BR>                        to inflict on that man...who seemed nice when he wasn't being assaulted, she was aware of everything, but unable to<BR>                        stop. Though she never admitted it..except to Scott, she hated fighting and killing. She always held back, which is why<BR>                        she put in the 'backward' Ghost unit. In a way she was glad, it was her timidness that saved her, and her affection, as<BR>                        forbidden as it was, for Scott which saved him. <P>                        Being unable to hold back, inflicting pain and suffering, hurt her more then anything she could have ever inflict. But that<BR>                        wasn't the beginning of her pain, she could here some else's moans.<P>                        Scott!<P>                        Getting up as fast as she could, she clicked the mangled jump jet in her suit, risking detonation and shot up the cliff to<BR>                        find Scott, laying on jagged rock.<P>                        "SCOTT!" She fell down beside him and cradles him.<BR>----------

She wept, clutching him tightly against her chest.<P>                        "Scott."<P>                        "Eris..you must go.....not safe...Dread King...nearby...get away..call for evac..."<P>                        "I'm not leaving you. . Come on get up. Let's go together."<P>                        "I ...can't. my back is broken......Z1 disk..i can't feel anything below my chest.." He coughed up some more blood, more<BR>                        tears welled up in Eris's eyes.<P>                        "You'll be fine. You just need time to rest, you'll regenerate."<P>                        "No....time....*cough*..can't you hear...death coming...." He blacked out.<P>                        "SCOTT!" She hated that he was right, the unnatural moans of the dead where growing louder. They where getting<BR>                        coser. They wanted to turn them and the others....the others!! That was it, the other bodies where safe and could not<BR>                        be turned, they where behind the barrier. The barrier kept anything undead away, like the zombies or the the remote<BR>                        drones and their bio-drain batteries.<P>                        "I know you can't hear me, but brace yourself this is going hurt Scott." With a gentle but swift motion she scooped him<BR>                        up, and triggered her last bit of jump juice. Getting just outside the barrier surrounding the temple. Her strength ebbing<BR>                        from her own wounds, and Scott's unconscious moans. She stumbled inside the barrier and collapsed blacking out.<P>                        A few hours later, she woke up and carried Scott inside the temple, and settled down against a wall, with his head in<BR>                        her lamp. As they both rested she trigered her emergency beacon, and happily blacked out again.<P><BR>                        [Come to me little one.....]<P><BR>                        Who are you....<P>                        [Come to me..I will take away your pain.....and your lover's]<P>                        Who are... Suddenly she felt warmth surrounding her, warm motherly love. Which was amazing because she never had a<BR>                        mother..in the natural sense..Her mother was a test tube and her father was knife, as the techs constantly said. <P>                        [Please get up, and come to me. Bring him with you]<P>                        Opening her eyes, she picked up her poor battered Scott. And she slowly passed through the hallways and deep inside<BR>                        the temple, Coming to a wall, without really knowing why or how, she knew it wasn't really a wall and stepped through<BR>                        and was blinded. She squinted, as bright light poured out around her.<P>                        [Come to my embrace little ones]<P>                        "Who are you?"<P>                        [Come to me and I will reveal all]<P>                        Eris stepped forward and through the blinding light she saw a tablet floating in the air...it seemed to be the source of<BR>                        the light. She shuffled closer and then her legs gave out and she collapsed in a heap. Very weakly, she stared back up<BR>                        at the tablet, except the tablet was no longer there. A woman was there, somewhat elven in a lush green dress made<BR>                        of plants, she seemed to be holding some sort of staff..<P>                        [I am the essence of all Norrath's life...I am the Spirit of Norrath..}<P>                        "Tu...nare" Eris muttered, remembering something she read in a mythology book.<P>                        [Yes, what is left of me. What you see before you is a memory, set aside to ensure the protection of Norrath from the<BR>                        Void. Unfortunately, since you do see this, it means I am no longer in exisence..But I have set forth this memory to<BR>                        ensure that Void does return.]<P>                        "Vo...id?"<P>                        [There is not enough energy left to explain in words. Take the tablet and hold it near your chest and you will see my<BR>                        eyes through yours. Then you will understand..]<P>                        Still somewhat delirious from her injuries, she reached out gradually and held the D.A.P sized tablet and held against her<BR>                        breast. It glowed warmly and then it disappeared along with her and Scott's wounds. But she couldn't marvel at this, as<BR>                        she was reliving the secrets of eternities through a god's eyes in a matter of moments.<BR>                        ---------------------------------------<P>Metal fragments and roofing shuddered as a weary battered form, uncovered itself from the smoldering ruins in<BR>                        Selvatoria.<P>                        ow...what in the hell was that?<P>                        The fragments gave way, revealing the platinum top of Reyas. He slowly pulls himself from underneath the rubble, finally<BR>                        free his first act of freedom was to fall asleep. Or at least try to. As he began to slip away a loud roar echoed above<BR>                        him.<P>                        O what now?<P>                        He rolled his eyes up and saw a dropship flaring it's engines to land. As the ship kicked up a minor dust storm, Reyas<BR>                        slowly got up to his feet and summoned his weapon of choice a broadsword forged of mana. He limped slightly to the<BR>                        back of the ship. As the DropShip's door opened Reyas stood at ready, tensing to take on anything before him. The<BR>                        door crashed on the dirt and then....<P>                        Nothing. No one came out, no sign of life at all. Relieved and disappointed at the same time, Reyas limped up the ramp<BR>                        and entered the craft, his eyes constantly scanning looking for something, which he was rewarded for.<P>                        "DIE YOU SCUM!!!"<P>                        A prism blade flashed out of nowhere, colliding with Reyas's sword emitting a shower of sparks. Holding the blade away<BR>                        with one hand, he aimed his other in the darkness where the blade was coming from and cast a spell.<P>                        "Grav Disruption" A ripple emitted from his hand and the unseen assailant grunted and flew backwards into the wall of<BR>                        the ship.<P>                        "ow..sonofa..." The form got back to it's feet and charged again<P>                        "You En-gen punks don't learn do you." Reyas extended both of us hands "Grav Disruption" The form smashed into the<BR>                        wall again. This time Reyas's charged sword at ready and just as suddenly stopped, the attacker finally coming into<BR>                        view. A Black elf in a mangled hardsuit, but not a En-gen suit.<P>                        "You're not with En-gen!!" They both said in surprised noticing the lack of the glaring En-Gen label.<P>                        "No kidding. Who are you?" They said at the same time again.<P>                        "My name is Reyas."<P>                        "Dirk..Dirk Lunas...help me up will you..man you pack a punch. either that or I am getting old...maybe both.ow my<BR>                        back."<P>                        "You don't even know the meaning of old." Reyas smirked, pulling the battered Dirk up to his feet. <P>                        "Man, your in bad shape" They said at the same time again studying each other.<P>                        "That is getting old, and yeah. Not surprising after getting jumped by some of En-gen's goons, not to mention being<BR>                        blasted on top of the head."<P>                        "So we have one thing in common oh.." Dirk collapsed.<P>                        "Looks like you took the worst beating" Reyas pressed his hands against Dirk covering him with a light blue aura. Dirk<BR>                        perked up slightly.<P>                        "Thanks...It's been a long day."<P>                        "You should sleep. I have to see about finding my grandson."<P>                        "If, En-Gen is involved....then...the last.." Dirk's speech began to slur as he began to black out<BR>                        "auto..pilot...setting..maybe.." He finally succumbed.<P>                        "Sleep well.That's not such a bad idea for me." Reyas left the sleeping black elf and thumbed the autopilot. As the ship<BR>                        closed up and boosted off the ground, Reyas shimmered and returned to his lower form and curled up in the pilots chair<P>                        That's better...I hate being in mature form.....at least now.....<P>                        As the ship soared of into the distance, Reyas reminisced..<P>                        I should of known better then fall in love with an ephemeral....but then I couldn't imagine my life without falling in love<BR>                        with her..at least in a way she is still living through our offspring...but then like all ephemerals...they will die too....can i<BR>                        really take any more passing away? it was Dyane that kept me alive....what will keep me around now? <P>                        ----------------------------------------------------<BR>                        "Leylia........Wake up...please...I need you..."<P>                        Reyas sobbed and pleaded for an endless time, but the old but still bueatiful form of Leylia stayed prone in her<BR>                        deathbed.<P>                        As the days blurred by, the funeral and then the wake passed. Reyas stayed in his room in Palsa, seeking no company<BR>                        from anyone. He just sat in his rocking chair looking out across the sky, through Leylia's favorite window. On the tray<BR>                        beside him, a lone glass of water and a state of the art Gnome and Becker single shot ball and powder hand pistol.<BR>                        -------------------------------------------<P>Nall and Annie slinked past guards and security cameras aimlessly wandering around the immense Gunboat Diplomat ,<BR>                        trying unsuccessfully to find a way out. After nearly an hour of wandering, they found their way to a refitted cargo<BR>                        hold. The hold had been refitted into a research facility, dozens of computers clicked and whistled emitting a rainbow of<BR>                        lights. In the center of this tech's wet dream was a large plastic tube filled with a transparent fluid. Floating in this fluid<BR>                        was purple haired Dark elf.<P>                        "What in the ?" Annie exclaimed<P>                        "Man! I have never seen anything like this. This stuff is way above the cutting edge...hmm maybe i can scrounge a few<BR>                        things for my..WOW!!! Look at her!!!"<P>                        With out even checking to see if any one was in the lab, he hopped over the guard rail and fell down to the lab floor<BR>                        and dashed over to the stasis chamber.<P>                        "Nall! Wait..oh crap.." <P>                        She fumed for a bit and jumped down and moved beside him as he was staring up at the naked dark elf floating in front<BR>                        of him.<P>                        "Keep calm frisky one." She teased at him, making him flush red.<P>                        "Um..what do you think they where doing to her?"<P>                        "Who knows. But it wasn't any good, take a look at this." She says pointing at a label on one of the consoles.<P>                        "En-Gen..figures"<P>                        "Yeah."<P>                        "let's break her out"<P>                        "You just want to ogle her more.dont you?"<P>                        "I do not!!....ok.maybe..Go find a robe or something for her."<P>                        "Ok" Annie leaves for a moment, as Nall tries to figure out how to open the stasis chamber.<P>                        {Press the red button}<P>                        "Who said that!?!"<P>                        {Turn around.}<P>                        Nall complied and faced a small viewing cabinet with a sword hanging in it. Nall stared at it bewildered.<P>                        {I know I am pretty but stop staring!}<P>                        "HUH!?!" Nall exclaimed<P>                        {Hehe..You get flustered so easily...I am going to like you..take me out}<P>                        Nall did so, as he grasped the hlt he felt a flash of warmth pass over him.<P>                        {!!!! You are part dragon!}<P>                        "Yeah. So?"<P>                        {It's been so long since I have had a dragon.escpecially who knows just where to touch me}<P>                        "!!!!" Nall turned red again<P>                        {Heheheheehe. You are so much fun. }<P>                        Nall still somewhat flustered, turned around and hit the red release button. The stasis tube began to empty rapidly, and<BR>                        then once empty the plastic tube receded into the ceiling. The girl collapsed in a heap.<P>                        "Found a lab coat!" Annie shouted<P>                        "Bring it!"<P>                        The girl's breathing slowly crept up to normal and as she adjusted from the stasis , she slowly opened her eyes.<P>                        "Hi there." Nall said noticing she was staring at him<P>                        She grinned and leapt off the platform and into his arms squeezing him and giggling happily.<P>                        "Nice to see you too!" Nall said grinning wider then the giggling girl in his arms<P>                        {Oooh! Down boy! Down}<P>                        Nall turned red again<BR>                        ------------------------------------<P>The alter plane was eerily calm as the crimson gate opened on top of a pillar. It was far too quiet for place known for<BR>                        the screams of the damned. But even the damned are quiet when He is near.<P>                        A figure donned in jet-black armor emerged from the gate, the ground that he stood on crackled as his aura turned<BR>                        black hot.<P>                        "Ahh. So my wayward reaver returns to me." The disembodied voice chuckled shaking the plane.<P>                        "return yes, but to you never. I have long since escaped your reach."<P>                        "My reach extends further then you think Raziel. Do not forget that I created you and I can destroy you. I will only<BR>                        tolerate your insolence so long."<P>                        Raziel laughed almost as greatly as the faceless god "Now who is being insolent." Raziel laughed louder "Your reach is<BR>                        limited and like the Dread King, I am beyond you."<P>                        "Or so you think. Look around my reaver. Do you not see the fields..the endless fields of souls. All plucked from the soil<BR>                        of Norrath. All of them swell my army."<P>                        "All your army is useless and you know it. If the Void is released even your pathetic rabble will not enough to stop it."<P>                        "So your motive for coming is revealed." The faceless one Cazic-Thule, the lord of Fear. The most powerful of the Gods<BR>                        came into sight. The god laughed again. "You want the key to the void."<P>                        "Yes. Only the strong should protect Norrath and that is not you."<P>                        "And you are? Haha! You are already succumbing to the Void's influence as we speak. It is only a matter of time till you<BR>                        serve the Void. Not even your femine half can protect you."<P>                        "I need no one to protect me nor do I serve any one." Raziel levitated off the pillar and began to radiate with power<BR>                        "But I tire of this petty banter ..Za'Amor"<P>                        If it where possible, it almost seemed like the Faceless one flinched at the sound of his true name. Raziel outstretched<BR>                        his hand to the god and his terrible weapon the black flame demon blade, the Kirosawa materialized<P>                        "Give ...me... your Key!"<P>                        The Faceless roared with laughter. "Fool. You have had the key for half a millennia."<P>                        "What!?!" <P>                        "Still do not realize, the key is a mimc, just like your other halfs key. Can't you feel it twisting your soul. Destroying you<BR>                        from the inside? Can't you feel the nothingness stretch across your being? Memories you once cherished now gone?"<P>                        Raziel for the first time found himself dumbstruck for a few moments, slowly recovering he extended his other hand and<BR>                        a katana of purest crystal materialized, the Nagitaka, Veeshan's blade. <P>                        You didn't tell me!?!<P>                        Raziel..I ...<P>                        YOU....<P>                        Raz..<P>                        SHUT UP!!!<P>                        Raziel ignited with flames as his anger took hold of him. The Nagitaka vanished and Raziel leapt at the faceless one,<BR>                        burying the Kirosawa deep into the god. Instead of cries of pain the god laughed.<P>                        "Before I destroy you. Tell me, why where the keys created in the first place! Why give Void a chance to return!"<P>                        The go laughed again "That you will have to ask to your other side...my reaver. Go forth and dance upon the strings of<BR>                        Void..."<P>                        The god disappeared, leaving Raziel alone. As Raziel disappeared into the shadows to return to Norrath, Cazic-Thule's<BR>                        laughter continued amongest the renewed screams of the damned.<BR>                        -------------------------------------<BR>The pistol rest against his forehead. The hammer ****ed and ready. A dove flew in and sat on the window. It walked<BR>                        around the sill for a few moments and then leapt away frightened at the loud noise of gunshot. The pistol clattered on<BR>                        the ground, Reyas full of weariness turned to his hand where the pistol once was, to stare at the distraught and<BR>                        terrified face of Dyane<BR>                        .<P>                        "WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?!"<P>                        "Leave me alone. Let me die in peace."<P>                        "Papa." Dyane begin to cry and clutched her father. Reyas shook her off.<P>                        "Go away...I'm tired of living....Tired of watching all of my friends...and everyone I love die..."<P><BR>                        "Death comes to all things......."<P>                        "NOT ME!! I have been alive longer then there was time!! I am older then death is! I am sick of this....go away..let me<BR>                        die"<P>                        "Death comes to all things papa, even you some day..me..my brother...my children...someday they wil pass away too.<BR>                        but that is one of the facts of life."<P>                        "What's the point of it all..."<P>                        "To live. To make the most of your existence. Not to throw it away, papa. You loved mom and she loved you. Do you<BR>                        think she would want you to throw your life away?"<P>                        "No..."<P>                        "And in a way shes not gone. Look at me Papa. Didn't you always say that I was the mirror image of mom?"<P>                        Reyas turned back to her and stared. He smiled slighty. "Yes."<P>                        "As long as the family goes on, so will she. We love you Papa, and so does she. We won't leave you and niether will<BR>                        she."<P>                        Reyas smiled through some tears. Dyane kissed Reyas on the forehead. "You need to get some rest Papa." Taking a<BR>                        blanket off the bed, she draped it over him. So he could nap watching the sky, through her mother's favorite window.<BR>                        In a few moments, he was snoring, quietly she picked up the pistol and with one hand crushed it.<BR>                        -------------------------------------<BR>A rumble shook the Jumpboat, waking Reyas from his dream. It was dark and overcast and beginning to storm.<P>                        "How did this cat get in here?" said a voice behind the pilots chair "Shoo!!!"<P>                        "Oh shoo yourself Dirk!"<P>                        "Reyas!?!"<P>                        "Duh"<P>                        "How..nevermind. I don't want to knoww. Where are we?"<P>                        "I can't tell through all of these clouds." A lightning bolt went off brightning the dark craft.<P>                        "Hey there is boat, down there in the water. Not a very big one though."<P>                        Reyas jumped up upon Dirk's shoulders and wapped him on the back of the head. "We are 35 thousand feet in the air!<BR>                        Of course it's tiny!!"<P>                        "OW!"<BR>                        ---------------------------------------------<P>                        "HEY!! I found my hard suit!!" Annie called out across the lab<P>                        "Cool. hey let go!...come on! let go! please..stop.HEY!!! Don't touch that!!! ehehheeAAHHAAHAHAHH!! Stop tickling me!!<BR>                        HAHAHAHAHAHHAAHA"<P>                        "What is going on over there?" Annie peered back over to where Nall was being tickled by the newly freed giggling girl.<P>                        "GET YOUR HANDS OF HIM!!!!" Annie screamed startling both Nall and the girl. The girl scowled at Annie and then stuck<BR>                        her tongue out her. Annie fumed and lunged at the girl, but before she grab hold and start pulling at the girl's hair. Nall<BR>                        jumped inbetween them.<P>                        "Ladies. There is plenty of me to go around, no need to fight over me."<P>                        "FIGHT OVER YOU!!!!!...I AM NOT FIGHTING OVER YOU!!" She screeched. " I am simply trying to help you, by keeping a<BR>                        subversive naked hussy from swaying you"<P>                        The girl, though while not entirely understanding all of Annie's words did catch her tone and direction of sentence. So<BR>                        she clutched Nall closer and stuck her tongue out at Annie. Annie fumed and lunged at the girl again, but was<BR>                        intercepted by Nall again.<P>                        "Ladies! Please let us get out of here first!"<P>                        Annie scowled once again, then turned away and went back to where she was a few moments ago. "That's what I was<BR>                        talking about. I found my hardsuit, it's in this lab...but it's locked" She smiles "not that it is a problem. The wrist<BR>                        transponder is outside though ."<P>                        She holds up a small electronic wristband. <P>                        "How does that help us? Let go! I can't breath..." The girl still holds on tightly<P>                        Annie frowns. "Watch this" She depresses a button on the wristband and her body fades slightly. The dismantled<BR>                        hardsuit on the other side of the glass, disappears. A few seconds , Annie fades back in fully encompassed by her<BR>                        hardsuit.<P>                        "TADA!!!" She giggles and gives Nall the peace symbol.<P>                        "COOL! Solid to Mana conversion!!" Nall wriggles out of the unnamed girl's hug to admire Annie/Aquamarine. The girl<BR>                        scowls as while Nall's back is turned, Annie has the hardsuit face plate retract and she sticks her tonque out at the girl.<P><BR>                        ""You three are terrible."" a voice spoke<P>                        "Who said that?"<BR>                        "Who said that?"<P>                        '"Me, the sword. Atwight. I hate to interrupt this hilarious love triangle, but we should try to get out of here before we<BR>                        are discovered." <P>                        "Atwight is right. Let's go."<BR>                        ------------------------------------<BR>                        "It seems like that ship is our destination. From the size of it, I would say that is the Gunboat Diplomat."<P>                        "How can you tell?"<P>                        "I can see from here that there are over 100 guns on the thing. No other ship in history has that many guns or ever<BR>                        carried such a large array of guns. Even the previous ones held obscene amounts of armaments."<P>                        "I take it you are as old as I am?"<P>                        "Probably older then you can dream. We will be landing in a few minutes, get ready!"<P>                        A large beam of light opens the sky and cuts through the Gunboat Diplomat.<P>                        "HOLY!!!"<P>                        "WHOA!!" They both shout as a shockwave rocks the Jumpboat, as they recover from the jolting. They look back out<BR>                        the window to see the Gunboat Diplomat in two pieces. One smaller piece, the forehalf was already sinking, the larger<BR>                        half was listing about to go under.<P>                        "NALL!!"<BR>                        "TRINI!!!"<P>                        The Jumpboat accelerated and dove toward the sinking battlecruiser.<BR>                        -----------------------------<P>"You know all things considered. That was way too easy." Annie said as they sneaked up onto the main deck.<P>                        "Don't jinx it. All we have to do is make it to that jumpcraft and we are s-"<P>                        The sound of rifles beign ****ed echos in the previously silent night air.<P>                        "FREEZE!!"<P>                        "-afe..."<P>                        "I told you this was to easy..." They raise their arms and turn around to a platoon of armed guards.<P>                        The sound of metal clanking upon the deck comes from behind them. The guards shift their aim to the new presence<BR>                        and then stand down to at-ease posture.<P>                        "Leave us" Calls the deep voice.<P>                        "SIR! YES SIR!!"<P>                        The platoon snaps a salute and vanishes back into the ship. Nall, Annie and the silent girl turn around to face a figure<BR>                        completely covered in jet-black armor. The girl trembled slightly and hid behind Nall.<P>                        "Who are you!"<P>                        "A messenger."<P>                        "What's the message?"<P>                        "Abandon the girl and flee if you wish to see another day. Do not listen her lies about the Void. It must not be freed."<P>                        "And if I choose not to heed this mesage?"<P>                        The man glowed slightly.<P>                        "You die."<P>                        "I don't think so" Nall stepped up, making sure that Annie and the girl were behind him. The girl realizing what was<BR>                        happening ran up to Nall and clutched him, shaking her head trying to stop him from fighting the man in black armor.<P>                        Nall wiggled out of her grip and assumed a fighting posture, the armored man did the same.<P>                        "N...Nall...l..ive" the girl said..her first words in their entire time together.<P>                        Nall leap into the air, twisting slightly to gain momentum and punched straight at the man's chest. It was easily parried<BR>                        as where the next series of blows. Nall floated in mid air just above the man's head, attacking with all the speed and<BR>                        strength he could muster, but to no avail. On his next punch, the man caught it and squeezed and then thrust the palm<BR>                        of his other hand into Nall's face sending Nall crashing to the ground. Nall didn't stay on the ground though he , leapt<BR>                        back to his feet and dashed under the man's guard, delivering to sharp blows to the chest, he reared back as mana<BR>                        flowed through hs body.<P>                        "I hope you you're okay! Cause you're only going to get a chance to see this once!! GRAV BUSTER!!!"<P>                        Nall flew forward fist first glowing with magic, his fist alit with power smashed into the man's face plate, then just at<BR>                        the point of contact. The very gravity of Norrath fluxed, catipulting the man away with the force of hundreds of times<BR>                        of Norrath's normal gravity.<P>                        Two disks whipped from behind Nall's head and collided with sailing man. The disks exploded and the man just hovered in<BR>                        the air encompassed by a pulsing blue field.<BR>---------<BR>(Still more  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"> )

"What in the?" Nall turned around to Annie, who was crouched down, a launcher on her back, shuddered and retreated<BR>                        back inside quyickly replaced by a laser emitter.<P><BR>                        "What are you.."

Annie stood up, the laser retreated, she raised her hand in to the sky.<P>                        "Lock on complete!

The skockwave of wind flung everyone into the air. Nall, Annie and the girl<BR>                        crashed into a heap ontop of one another, but not for long as the once invincible ship began to list.<P>                        (Music Cue: Duel of The Fates: Star Wars The Phantom Menace)<P>                        The forward section of the Diplomat fell beneath the waves and the larger half began to dance against the surging<BR>                        ocean. But in a few moment eerily, the waves began to calm. A new figure materialized out the air, someone doned in<BR>                        light blue almost cloth like material, an unknown metal formed plates at vital areas of the fiure and it wore a two horned<BR>                        mask of crystal..<P>                        As the trio slowly untangled themselves and faced the new figure, a katana of black flames materialized it's right hand.<BR>                        The new enemy, performed a short kata with the blade and then extended it's left hand. A katana of purest crystal<BR>                        appeared. It brought both blades to bear in front of it, and with a sharp motion slammed the hilts together. Bolts of<BR>                        energy crackled the air and around the new double sided weapon. The figure crouched down and extended a free hand,<BR>                        and with it motioned to the trio..bring it on.<P>                        A vibro blade released it self from Annie's right arm of her hardsuit, she tensed ready to spring.<P>                        [Well what are you waiting for use me]<P>                        I'm terrible with swords, I stick to my hands.<P>                        [I'll refrain from making a mean comment.......just wield me and I will guide you]<P>                        Nall followed Atwight's instructions and readied the sentient blade. He charged, in close pursuit was Annie. They both<BR>                        swung at the assaislant and found them both being easily parried, no matter how hard they tried, they could'nt slip<BR>                        through his defense. In a few moments, they wfound themselves flying through the air again, propelled by a wall of<BR>                        force from the attacker. They crashed in a heap on the hull, the wind knocked out of them.<P>                        The attacker, dropped his guard and turned to the shivering girl how had not joined in the attack.<P>                        "You should have listened to us, before hand. If you continue on this path, you and your friends will die" The figure said<BR>                        in a strange overlapping voice a man and a woman in unity.<P>                        "GIVE HER BACK TO ME YOU FREAK!!!" A voice boomed across the night. The attacker looked up to see a black elf, in<BR>                        mangled armor, a sword held high plumeting out of the sky.<BR>                        ---------------------------------<P>                        Just above, the mortally damaged Diplomat, the Jumpboat hovered. Reyas looked down in complete surprise as he saw<BR>                        a figure apppear out of thin air. <P>                        That mask...it's crystal..but aside from that it's exactly like Raziel's...it can't be..Raziel? Alive?<P>                        Dirk also saw the same figure appear out of the air.<P>                        "That's him!! He took Trini!! I'll kill him!!Open the hatch!!!"<P>                        "I can't We are too high up ,we'll decompre-"<P>                        "OPEN THE DAMNED DOOR!!!"<P>                        "I can't until we get lower!!!"<P>                        Dirk cried out and turned toward the door and broke out into a flat run.<P>                        "Dirk! What the hell are you do-" Reyas couldn't finish as Dirk slammed into and through the doors. Dirk disappeared as<BR>                        he fell down and down, and the Jumpboat began buck madly as the air made it's escape from the craft.<BR>                        ----------------------------<P><BR>                        Dirk fell down and down towards the dying Diplomat, his target firmly in his sight. A prism blade extended from his<BR>                        mangled suit as he continued his rapid descent. The figure..the kidnapper was in his sights..almost there.<P>                        "GIVE HER BACK TO ME YOU FREAK!!!" He screamed as loudly as he could.<P>                        The 'freak' turned unconcerned and looked up to the falling elf. Dirk seemed to slam into an invisible wall, he could feel<BR>                        his body igniting, as if every cell fo his body was encompassed by flames. His scream once again cut the night. Still<BR>                        screaming, Dirk was flung away back to the ocean.<P>                        The ocean was no salve to his burning flesh, the salty water increased his agony as it filled his numerous wounds, but<BR>                        that pain was nothing..it was not why he cried out..it was his that he was close..and failed..the last of strength began<BR>                        to taper, as he bobbed amongest the waves.<P>                        "Trini......"<BR>                        ------------------------<BR>"DIRK!!" Reyas cried as he watched the events unfold. Raziel below on the Diplomat, unsummoned the blade, and looked<BR>                        up to the faltering Jumpboat.<P>                        You will be spared now old friend, but be warned. Do not release the Void.<P>                        WHY!! After all you did! All you put me, Leylia and everyone through! I will not have Leylia's ambitions, dreams crushed<BR>                        because of you!<P>                        You have been warned. Old friend.<P>                        Raziel vanished into the night. Reyas, shuddered at this.<P>                        ..Raziel. He had changed sides so many times..what was he up to now..Why? Why did he guide them to try to teach<BR>                        aout the Void, and then tell them not to...It doesn't make any sense....<P>                        Reyas put this aside for the moment and began to lower the battered Jumpboat down to the dying Diplomat, he got<BR>                        close as he could witout touching down. He knew that it had taken a huge beating, and would not fly again once it<BR>                        landed.Working quickly he tossed out a rope ladder down to the deck and awaited for the trio to climb aboard. Annie,<BR>                        and then girl made it up inside of the craft, as Nall started up. Reyas called down to him.<P>                        "Hold on a sec Nall, we got to do a little fishing!"<P>                        "Huh!?!"<P>                        "That guy that got blasted a few seconds ago, we got to get him out of the water!"<P>                        "Oh. Okay!!"<P>                        "Hang on tight now!"<P>                        The Jumpboat dragged away from the Diplomat, Nall hanging on the bottom of the ladder, swinging around searching for<BR>                        the fallen friend. It took some time, but he soon found the half drowned elf. He grapped ahold of him, trying not to<BR>                        agravate the wounds and signalled to Annie and the girl to pull the ladder up. As they did, Reyas manned the Jumpboat<BR>                        and blasted it upwards and away.<P>                        Once they got him aboard, Annie began to care to his wounds, with what little medical supplies she had in her suit.<P>                        "So where too Granpa?"<P>                        "I don't know, but we have to pick somewhere close" He pointed to a gauge with a paw.<P>                        "With damage this thing has taken and as long as we have been flying, it doesn't have much juice in it."<P>                        "Well the closest city is Qeynos. And that is not going to work, we just sunk their flagship, there is going to be a huge<BR>                        bounty on us....say" He stared at Reyas a bit<P>                        "Don't even think about it!"<P>                        "Just a thought...if only we had some cash..."<P>                        "What?" Annie asked cutting in<P>                        "If we had some cash, we could go to Ell-Five."<P>                        "Ell-Five! That place! It's apalce for hooligans and other miscreants. Why would we go there?"<P>                        "Well' it is in shambles nowadays, but aside from Highpass Dock and Iceclad Marina, it's the only place big enough to<BR>                        repair an Airship."<P>                        "So....."<P>                        "We could use my Airhsip..that was if a certain person who shall remain nameless*cough* Granpa*cough* hadn't<BR>                        broken it."<P>                        "I did not!"<P>                        "Yes, you did!!!"<P>                        "You! You have an Airhip!"<P>                        "I just said that."<P>                        "How can you afford an Airhsip, those things are expensive!"<P>                        "I know, and really expensive to repair. That's why I was at SNG, to win money to fix it. But you ruined<BR>                        everything....speaking of which where is my money!!!"<P>                        "Um..at the Orphans of Freeport Foundation."<P>                        ".....We are scewed..guess we have to go risk Qeynos."<P>                        "NO! Don't go there!"<P>                        "Why?"<P>                        "Because..um.....well....i'm not realy liked...."<P>                        "So?"<P>                        "I kinda of embarrased my dad a while back..and he kinda has alot of friends down in Qeynos..."<P>                        "I'll repeat my last statement.

I think there is enough limit to fix your ship."<P><BR>                        Nall blinked and then hugged Annie. ".....I love you!..." The embrace was quickly broken up by the dark elf elf girl, who<BR>                        glared evilly at Annie and then hugged Nall.<P>                        "This reminds me.." Nall states, looking at the girl."What's your name?"<P>                        "Me..Lilith."<P>                        "Pretty name."<P>                        She grinned.<P>                        Reyas still on top of the console grumbled to himself, that Nall was getting all the attention. He paced slightly and by<BR>                        accident his tail brushed across Atwight, who had been laid on the console by Nall after scooping up Dirk. As his tail<BR>                        touched Atwight, he felt a famaliar sensation pass over him, a sensation long forgottten. famaliar but undescribable.<P>                        [You're Dragon.]<P>                        Yes. Who are you?<P>                        [Just a sword. ]<P>                        A telepathic sword is not just any old sword....Do you have a name<P>                        [Atwight]<P>                        Atwight...some how it seems famaliar..I can't put by finger on it..<P>                        [Of course, you don't have any fingers]<P>                        .....Smart alec...<P>                        Reyas switched his concentration back to the trio. "I'm setting the course to Ell-Five, we should be at the stratorbital<BR>                        in about 15 minutes. Good thing too, we only got 16 minutes of fuel."<P>                        The Jumpbaoat flared it's engines to maximum, to make the ascent to Ell-Five, as it ascended, the group made quick<BR>                        patchwork to the hole in the door, so it wouldn't decompress again at the higher altitude of Ell-Five. It wouldn't hold<BR>                        long, being just a plastic sheet, but it would be long enough.<BR>                        -----------------------------------<P>                        Several days later, after lavishly spending Annie's money, Nall's pride and joy was back in complete working order.As<BR>                        they waited for the Flight control in Ell-Five to cycle the Naked Elf to drop station. The band of companions discussed<BR>                        their next destination along with other items.<P>                        "I can't believe, you spent 4 million platinum fixing this piece of junk. Even for a airship, this thing is old! It looks like an<BR>                        old sailing ship with propellers! What a piece of sh-"<P>                        "Don't badmouth my ship!!! It maybe old-fashioned or even an antique maybe, but it is the fastest and most powerful<BR>                        craft in existence. It's my baby." Nall says prodly as he rubs and then hugs main mast of the ship.<P>                        "Hmph..I still think it's a piece of junk.."<P>                        "I'll be more then happy to show you the way out." Nall says pointing to the fact, the Naked Elf had been cycled to the<BR>                        main lock and the ocean and clouds, far far below where just underneath.<P>                        Annie looks over and jumps "AHH! We are high!!Where's the ground!!"<P>                        "About 13 miles down."<P>                        "are you sure this thing works? "<P>                        "Ohh course, my ship is the best-" A small piece of the mast, Nall was leaning against comes off. "...there is.."<P>                        "oh lord.."<P>                        -Attention Vessel 4512 Designation: Naked Elf, please stand by for final cycling and cross lock.

Students, that mysteriously vanished after, joining<BR>                        some kindof cult. a cult that taught use of magicks and sorcerorcy.

Hard breathing, then the sounds of paws slapping across the ground. it was getting closer..closer, it was<BR>                        getting cold. He screamed again, as something bit into his right legs, blood streamed, he felt him self being hoisted in<BR>                        the air and flung around like a doll. it shook him again and again, and eventually his leg came off. he skided across te<BR>                        grund, blood pouring, and he saw it. The shadows themselves where his assailant, the shadows had teeth, the shadows<BR>                        where getting closer. The shadows began ripping at his chest, she screamed and screamed for a long time and<BR>                        eventually he stopped and the light began to fde from his eyes, but the ripping continued for a long time<P><BR>                        As the slaughter contnued, Maxim in the center of room, assumed a lotus posiotn and smiled a the sight.<P>                        "Enjoy your meal, Pain."<P>                        And with one exhaling, his body went cold as death, his surrondings began to disappear and were replaced, by the<BR>                        Plane of Fear.<P>                        "You have done well, Maxim.

Chapter Four: Tides Of Darkness<P>            Dirk sat with his head in his hands. His body had recovered quickly, even by demonic standards. He had found it necessary to deceive<BR>            his companions about just how dangerous he was, so he played the invalid a few hours longer then he had to. His young-appearing<BR>            face was harsh and sad.<P>            He wasn’t sure he trusted them, and he was left alone with his melancholia.<P>            Trini.....Jesi.....Tunare......Thelis......Yakov...........<P>            I’ve failed them all. Always when they needed me.....I was never there, or I never did what I should have.........<P>            “NO!” he screamed, slamming his hand down on the railing. “I WILL NOT FAIL AGAIN!!!!” He cursed and screamed and slammed his<BR>            hand on the rail until he was afraid it was going to break. His blood boiled and his fiery aura rose to a black inferno.<P>            “Hey, watch it!” Nall ran over to Dirk and tried to restrain him, then hissed as his hands came away slightly burned.<P>            “To hell with you!”<P>            “You could damage the ship!”<P>            “To hell with your ship too!” Dirk turned his back on the angry young man.<P>            “Dirk.” It was Reyas. “Calm down.”<P>            “Calm down? Calm down? You haven’t ever even seen me mad. Trust me, Reyas, that’s one sight you’ll never-”<P>            “Trust me. You’re mad. What’s your problem? Tell us.”<P>            Dirk sighed and decided to do so. His voice lowered as he began to speak.<P>            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>            Long ago.....<BR>            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>            “Maxim!”<P>            “What?” Maxim’s face was drawn with anguish.<P>            “....the lady is dead.” The healer pointed to Reva’s lifeless body. “I’m sorry, I did all I could.”<P>            Maxim’s face hardened slowly, and gray took it’s tan color. Then the color returned to his face and he howled, an animal sound of<BR>            frustrated anguish, and stalked away.<P>            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>            Maxim Tidias walked to the iron door and opened it quietly.<P>            “What?” from the guard at the door. Maxim never gave him a chance to listen, as he smashed the man’s head with a single blow. The<BR>            men inside came to their feet.<P>            “What are you doing, Tidias? Are you mad?”<P>            Maxim smiled cruelly and spoke in a hollow, declamatory voice. “You fools are unworthy of my teacher’s legacy. Here you die.”<P>            Cries of outrage erupted and the men drew weapons.<P>            He sent a shadow chain through his first challenger. The man howled as he was struck, and then another, and another, and another<BR>            one, tearing his victim to shreds. Man after man after man came at him. All were destroyed effortlessly.<P>            “Mal’Shak!” Another dead man. Maxim was butchering them, one by one. Not a single one stood a chance. Another one came at him,<BR>            brandishing a sword.<P>            “You usurper!”<P>            Maxim wasted no time on pleasantries or comebacks. He simple obliterated the man with a barrage of chain.<P>            Finally Maxim stood alone. He, last of Raziel’s students. The only one worthy of his post. The only one alive........He placed his hands<BR>            on each individual corpse, draining the soul from the cooling bodies with a vicious and sickening delight. Something deep inside him<BR>            screamed at the euphoria, but he brushed it aside effortlessly.<P>            He walked calmly over to the plain black basalt chair which was the Hell Lord’s throne. He slowly, calmly, and coolly sat down in it.<P>            Instantly a cloak of flames surrounded him, burning, searing. Not his flesh. His very soul. He screamed and tried to get up out of the<BR>            seat, but the flames kept burning, and he screamed again. The price of being a Mal’Shak was endless torment and a desperate need<BR>            for souls.<P>            Dimly through the sea of agony he felt, he thought he heard a mocking laugh.<P>            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>            Maxim rode to the forefront of his army. Such a host could not have been conceived of in a madman’s delirious nightmares. There<BR>            were teeth, claws, blades, spines, scaled flesh and coiled muscle. Armor, weapons, all were ready and shone with a light of bloody<BR>            sun.<P>            “Now we march upon the Plane of Growth! Burn everything! Leave nothing standing!” Maxim was used to the fiery cloak, and he was<BR>            filled with blood lust at the thought of the battle ahead. <P>            Then, with a wave of his hand, he created a portal and rode through it.<P>            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>            As the army spilled out upon the fields of the plane, it was as if a plague of locusts had come to devour a ripe field. Most of the<BR>            guards at the entry point never had a chance. They were simply swarmed under despite their valiant efforts to resist. A few stood<BR>            longer, warding off the blows of the horrors coming at them from all sides. They began to break ranks, run.<P>            Maxim regarded the battle as a foregone conclusion. There was no way that anyone in the enemy camp could withstand-<P>            He was still thinking that when a portion of his army was eclipsed by a massive field of crackling black and purple lightning. The smell<BR>            of burning flesh was unleashed upon the previously incorrupt plane and the screams of the survivors rang loud. The enemy, inspired<BR>            by this new and unseen ally, rebounded. Their rout became a counterattack, and soon everyone and everything was fighting.<P>            Maxim spurred his unholy steed forward and rode to the front of his troops, leading by example the way he always did. He sent great<BR>            blasts of dark chain forward, the weapons flailing and cutting his enemies apart. The plan had not changed. So it would be a little<BR>            harder. So? There were simply too few defenders versus too many attackers. He had plenty of time, and nobody here was his equal.<BR>            He knew it was not going to kill him. To accept the fact that he might be killed was beyond Maxim Tidias. His life was a story, and it<BR>            would not end on the field of combat. The world had been created simply because some day he would stride it, and it did not end<BR>            with his death. Not here, anyways.<P>            The terrified eyes of his adversaries were irritating to the Hell Lord. There was no time to kill properly. He kept his concentration on<BR>            the fighting as he cut his way through enemy ranks. Captains, champions, all fell. All died.<P>            A whispering wind seemed to blow for a moment, a cold wind that smelled of ice. A man to Maxim’s left shrieked as a swiftly-moving<BR>            shadow rose from the ground and pulled him from his horse and ran him through with a fiery blade of dark matter. Maxim whirled to<BR>            face this new adversary, spurring his horse forward, moving to run his opponent down. The shadow stood it’s ground.<P>            Maxim laughed as his horse moved faster and faster. The man was crazy!<P>            The next second was a blur. As Maxim’s steed rushed upon it, the shadow’s blade sang and the horse tumbled to the ground, stone<BR>            dead. Maxim was jerked out of his saddle and half thrown. Stars exploded before his vision and he realized with a jolt he was<BR>            face-down on the dirt. He picked himself up with a speed born of long practice and sent a barrage of shadowy chains at his<BR>            adversary. The chains were brushed aside like rain from a roof.<P>            Then the shadow launched it’s own attack, rippling forward to rend and tear Maxim’s black armor. Maxim guarded, forming the chains<BR>            into a rough blade, and parrying easily. The shadow laughed, a cool hard voice, and swung again, with grace and relative ease. Maxim<BR>            guarded again and counterattacked with a snap of chain which struck a practically stunning blow to the shadow. It shook it’s head<BR>            and dropped it’s dark aura.<P>            It was a young-looking elf, black-haired, pale skinned, the color of marble, and dark-eyed. His eyes hardened, he yelled, and a dark<BR>            fire blazed out from him. Maxim hissed and flew back, burning, and responded with his own power.<P>            For an instant they stood there, locked in furious mental contest, then they leapt back simultaneously and struck at each other<BR>            again. Armor shards flew like little missiles and cut at both men’s faces and arms. Anger was flowing through the air like a river of<BR>            emotion when an explosion blew the two of them back in opposite directions.<P>            The battle swarmed in between them, driving them apart. Maxim breathed slowly for a moment, the turned back to combat. He<BR>            shouted “Onward!” The army drove the struggling defenders back in a stumbling, disorganized collapse of order. Many of them were<BR>            slaughtered. It was carnage that warmed Maxim’s heart.<P>            ---------------------------------------<P>Dirk opened the door with weariness slowing his motions. His armor was soiled with sweat and blood, and it was notched in several<BR>            places. His face was stained with blood which flowed from a shallow cut on his forehead. <P>            “Things go ill, my lady, but we can still hold.”<P>            Tunare was standing facing the window. She did not turn as she replied. “You really think so?”<P>            “I cannot think anything else.” Dirk remained standing. “Why have you called me?”<P>            “Dirk, we aren’t going to win this.”<P>            “We can still win. You are more then a match for the Faceless.”<P>            “No, Dirk, I’m not.” Tunare turned to face him. “I have called you because I want you to take the army and leave the field<BR>            immediately. My children are dying. Every one which dies drains me more and more. They no longer need me, but I need them. This is<BR>            a lost cause. Go.”<P>            “WHAT?”<P>            “You heard me, Dirk. All of you. Now.”<P>            “Milady, that will leave you defenseless.”<P>            “So?” Tunare’s face was ravaged. The death of her ‘children’ had left dark stains under her eyes and her figure was thinner then Dirk<BR>            remembered it to be. She was like an ancient, withered tree before the storm of the enemy assault.<P>            “You are not dying while I am alive.”<P>            “Your own life is worth more!”<P>            “It is worth nothing.”<P>            “Dirk, I want you to know something. I’m not who you think I am-”<P>            “I knew.”<P>            “YOU KNEW? How?”<P>            “Destiny does not lie, my lady.” Dirk was quiet. “I knew from the moment I opened the book. It told the truth. The words-they didn‘t<BR>            matter. It was the knowledge inside the bindings. That‘s why so many people don‘t get it.” He smirked ever so slightly. “Even further,<BR>            I knew that I had killed Innoruuk the moment I felt my blade slide through his ribs. He is merely a ghost of malice now, one that can<BR>            barely maintain his power, let alone try to expand it. And that way he’ll stay if I have anything to say about it. If one ‘god’ can be<BR>            defeated, why not all of them?”<P>            “And still you followed me? You let me put you through all that?” Tunare was incredulous. “You let me use you as a pawn in our<BR>            struggle? You let me let you be ostracized by everyone? You let me take everything from you?”<P>            “I did.”<P>            “WHY?”<P>            “You are my liege. My honor is yours. I could not have asked for a better lord or lady to serve.”<P>            “Why didn’t you set out on your own?”<P>            Dirk smiled bitterly. “I did with Melkor, and look what happened to me.” He knelt before Tunare. “Your safety is still my duty. Let the<BR>            rest of the army leave with you. I’ll hold the door. One life which matters nothing will be lost.”<P>            Tunare thought very fast. “Dirk, I will never leave this plane alive. I know that.” She looked him in the face, eyes pleading. “You<BR>            matter. I do not. I have played my part. My children have grown up and left the home. You have one yet to perform.” She smiled<BR>            sadly. “The offer is reversed. I’ll hold the door. You leave.”<P>            Dirk was silent until he drew his sword. The light shone upon it as he brought it up into a salute.<P>            Tunare smiled. “There were some who said you shouldn’t have been allowed to be born. I think they’re wrong.” She bowed her head.<BR>            Dirk realized that a supposed ‘immortal’ faced with the inevitability of her own demise is a particularly sad sight. “Listen to me. Don’t<BR>            give up. Period. Some terrible things are going to happen to you, but they can be resolved.”<P>            Dirk smiled bitterly again. “Let fate do it’s worst.” He nodded slowly. “This conversation never happened except for the part where<BR>            you told me to leave.” He turned his back on Tunare and descended the steps, leaving his honor in shreds.<P>            --------------------------<P>Maxim finished praying as the massive form of the Faceless One appeared before him. Men ran, only Maxim stood alone before Him.<P>            “Leave this to me, my reavers.” The Faceless turned and with a powerful blow snapped the door to splinters. “Do not enter.”<P>            Maxim waited calmly. He felt the tremors as the two gods moved to battle. The flashes alone-muted by the walls but still very bright-<BR>            were evidence of their physical battle, but he sensed that there were strikes that were beyond his ability to see-to even imagine. It<BR>            went on for minutes without any sign of stopping, but the strikes shifted more and more to the side of his dread master. He thought<BR>            he could hear screaming, and make out words, but they meant nothing to him.<P>            “You fool, Za’Amor! You dare to interrupt this? In the deaths of one lies the deaths of all of us!”<P>            There was no reply. The next thing he heard was a shocking female scream that echoed in his head like an off-center bell. It went on<BR>            for five full minutes until he thought his head would burst. He was thrown to his knees, and staggered to his feet, and against orders,<BR>            crawled into the room.<P>            He saw very little he could later remember, for all his attention was focused upon the center of the room-and Tunare. The death of a<BR>            thing as powerful as she was is catastrophic. As it was, she was on her knees, bleeding from a dozen wounds. Even as he watched<BR>            her body began to turn bright green in mottled patches, then with a sickening sort of sound reminiscent of wet cloth being dragged<BR>            slowly over concrete the green patches disintegrated slowly into greenish gas smelling of loam. The smell of wet wood filled the room<BR>            as more and more of the patches disappeared, leaving gaping holes without anything inside them. Eventually she was reduced to a<BR>            gaunt, little wire-like figure, and her scream to a thin wail. She pulsed once, and Tunare, Mother of All, exploded into nothingness and<BR>            her cry of agony rose to a shriek which tapered away into an unimaginable silence.<P>            He was immediately knocked back down again from the shockwave. The green-tinged explosion rattled his armor and burned his<BR>            exposed limbs. He couldn’t breathe, the air had been incinerated. As it passed over him he felt he was lucky to be alive. The walls<BR>            were obliterated, and patches of his army who had been right outside the shrine with them. The Faceless One weathered the<BR>            explosion impassively, then with a huge, hollow echoing laugh he began to exult.<P>            In a last shot at Cazic-Thule, the Plane of Growth grew greener and greener as the gas that had once been it’s mistress filled the air<BR>            and drifted whither it would. Some of the army of darkness were engulfed by the gas, and soundlessly were smothered in trees which<BR>            grew up from the earth beneath them and swallowed them up. The plane resisted all efforts to destroy the plants and wildlife inside,<BR>            which bloomed with increasing prosperity. But Cazic was satisfied. His hated enemy had been destroyed utterly, leaving only a<BR>            shadow of herself in the hearts of those who yet worshipped her and in places of her former power.<P>            And in Dirk Lunas’s soul.<P>            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>            Scott stared at Eris’s sleeping form, marveling at the humanity he only now realized was a blessing. His spine-ah, what a privilege to<BR>            walk! To move!-was fixed, and he had no idea how. <P>            Sleeping was the best word for it, he decided. He had no idea why Eris lay there unconscious, seeing things that he did not, crying<BR>            out words in a tongue he did not know. He was worried about her.<P>            The techs would get-no. He was never going back to his makers again except to exact his revenge. The memory of what they had<BR>            done to him filled his brain with flames. Anger rose in him, anger that had to be appeased. Scott was not a person who could calmly<BR>            tolerate anger. When he got angry, things-and people-got damaged. It was partially a trace of aggression enhancement.<P>            He ripped the large, flashy En-Gen logo off his suit’s remains, pulled out his pistol, and fired once.<P>            The sight of the ruined logo was somehow appropriate. His anger blunted, he though objectively for a time. They had no home, no<BR>            family, and no friends. They were marooned on a hostile continent with horrors striding it’s soil. And worse of all, he had discovered a<BR>            vile talent in himself he did not want to ever acknowledge.<P>            He began to sit down when he felt a pull on the right side of his head. Obligingly, he turned, and somehow knew to go forward. Scott<BR>            took the pull as an order, and he was accustomed to following orders.<P>            He proceeded to a balcony overlooking a cliff. The pull shifted to down. Again complying, he leapt off the cliff into the ocean. He<BR>            came up again without sputtering, for some reason he felt no need to breathe. The pull kept pulling downward and he dived<BR>            underwater.<P>            Now it was forward. He swam faster then he thought he was capable of swimming, and by the same token, he didn’t get tired. Time<BR>            slipped away. He didn’t pay attention to it.<P>            The pull went downward again. He dived further, coming to the sandy bottom. Sharks and creatures of which he didn’t know the<BR>            names swam in patterns about the area, but he felt no fear. His confident manner calmed them, and they let him be. He wasn’t<BR>            paying attention to them. He was paying attention to the sheathed sword at the bottom of the ocean, glittering with the light of the<BR>            distant sun.<P>            The sword was black as a starless night with no moon. It seemed to radiate darkness and he imagined that through the enshrouding<BR>            water he could hear a low murmur. It’s hilt was studded with a dark red gemstone and a black one at it’s pommel. It had a piece of<BR>            parchment in it’s scabbard, which he couldn’t read unless he grabbed the sword.<P><BR>            That was what he was supposed to do. He grasped the blade in his left hand and kicked to the surface, then swam back. It was no<BR>            easy task to swim up, but he took his time, even encumbered by the blade.<P>            For some reason, he got to the cliff in five minutes. It made no sense. But then again, had any of this insane journey made any<BR>            sense? Starting with their assignment? He smiled halfheartedly as he rose out of the water and rappelled to the top of the cliff. His<BR>            soaked jumpsuit was dripping all over, and his light brown hair had been darkened by the water. His pointed ears were like peaks,<BR>            water flowed down from them as if it was snow melt. He walked-soaking-to the room where he had left Eris.<P>            She was still asleep. He thanked fate for letting her be all right, and still a young woman as opposed to those....things they had<BR>            become for but a short time. Again he was struck by just how beautiful Eris was. He had been grown, not born, and he was<BR>            biologically far younger then his appearance and build made him out to be. Thus, he was experiencing feelings and emotions he had no<BR>            idea existed in people-had never even been taught. Scott had had no mother and father to tell him it was all right and to explain. He<BR>            had no family to make him feel welcome. Only a few of the more friendly techs had explained to him, calmly, and sometimes a little too<BR>            clinically, what they were and what to do about them. How to satisfy them and how to deny them. He didn’t really want to think<BR>            about it, it made his cheeks burn with scarlet.<P>            Shoving aside the feelings, he pulled the sword out from it’s scabbard. The dark edge howled-howled?-as it was drawn, filling the<BR>            room with darkness and fear. The howling became a shriek as he tested it against the edge of his adamantine broadsword-which was<BR>            cloven in two as if it was newly dried wax. He was astounded. Adamantine was the hardest stuff he had ever seen before, and the<BR>            sword looked like it, but it was harder then his own.<P>            Magic, he decided. The techs had also instructed him in the arts of magic. There were legends of objects-swords, daggers, armor,<BR>            staves, and other things-that had been enchanted. This must be one. Even now weapons and armor were enchanted, even pistols<BR>            and ammunition, but the past’s artifacts had supposedly been mightier then the present’s. He was startled-and honored-to find one.<P>            He read the hilt‘s marking. The characters were ones he had never been taught, but they were familiar to him. “Despair” it read.<P>            “To he(she? whatever) who wants to use this, you are a moron But you‘re stuck, the sword‘s attached itself to you, so:<P>            The Despair is a weapon of darkness and should only be used in great need. Beware of it. Though it is not evil of itself, it’s influence<BR>            may corrupt the hearts of those who use it unless their will is strong, for it is infused with destruction. Be careful.<P>            Don’t really have anything else to say. <P>            Yakov Shadeleaf”<P>            The name was a mystery to him, but the words and tone were not. He could swear he had heard them before. Oh well. A sad grin<BR>            spread across his face.<P>            “It’s you and me against the world, Eris,” he said quietly.<P>            “Really?” She was awake? Her eyes were closed, and her face was twisted into an expression of agony.<P>            “Are you all right?”<P>            “I saw horrible things, Scott.. Help me up,” she whined. Her dark, enchanting eyes slid open and she smiled at him. He smiled back.<P>            “Ok.” He grabbed her hand and yanked her up hard.<P>            “Ow. You meanie!” She playfully poked him. “Hold on a moment, I have to find something.” She bent over, facing away from him, and<BR>            he stared discreetly.<P>            “Don’t do that.” She didn’t turn around.<P>            He blushed and averted his eyes. “How did you know?”<P>            “It’s sort of obvious. I know you want me, but still.” She rummaged around in the piles of debris and picked up a D.A.P sized tablet.<BR>            “Ok, we can go,” she said, tucking it into her mutilated uniform’s breast pocket.<P>            “What is that?”<P>            “It’s a key. A special kind of key.” Scott got the impression she didn’t want to say any more.<P>            “How do you propose to get out of here? We‘re surrounded by the undead.”<P>            “Simplicity in itself. Hold me.” He grasped her about the waist in a hug. She smiled at him, but the smile was tinged with sadness.<BR>            Concern grew in him. What had she seen?<P>            A ring of sparkling light erupted from the floor. He gasped and nearly dropped her, but she held firm. <P>            “Where are we going?!”<P>            “I have no idea! Hold on!”<P>            Then the room vanished from his sight.<P>            ------------------------------<P>Dirk finished his story in a low, flat tone. It held no emotion in it. The group had gone silent at Tunare’s death and continued their<BR>            silence as he elaborated on Jesi’s death and Trini‘s kidnapping.<P>            “Now you see why I’m angry.”<P>            There was no reply.<P>            “I’m done. I‘m going to bed.” He spun on his heels and descended into the hold. The group continued their silence until he was out of<BR>            earshot.<P>            “A loose cannon, I say.” That was Annie.<P>            “Definitely,” Nall agreed. “But he’s powerful. We’ll keep an eye on him, and if he starts being too rowdy....”<P>            Reyas interrupted him. “Can’t you see? You can trust Dirk Lunas to do what he wants to do-kill Maxim. Past that, probably. He’s a<BR>            good man. He’d kill for any one of us. Think. He’s met too many people who are dead; death is his ultimate enemy. En-Gen has his<BR>            daughter. He’ll kill them if he gets the chance. He’s as trustworthy as any of us.”<P>            “V...Void.” That was Lilith, her words halting. “He...is........in....in...” she looked irritated. Her voice sounded in Nall’s mind.<P>            He is infused with......if that’s the right way to say it. He.....just take him, ok?<P>            Nall nodded and Lillith swarmed him with hugs. He blushed and Annie muttered obscenities she really shouldn’t know. “And Atwight?”<BR>            he asked aloud.<P>            [Take him.]<P>            Nall nodded and ascended the pilot’s house’s ladder. Nall loved flying as a bird does. He slid into the seat with practiced ease,<BR>            remembering the times when he was a child and Ruby Tayus had steered here, guns blazing and the rudder shrieking with stress. Nall<BR>            had loved his mother, and had only escaped her fate because he had been hidden on board the ship and had taken it out alone after<BR>            it was impounded.<P>            Rumor had it that Ruby had been tortured to death. Nall didn’t want to know, Sometimes he dreamed about it. It wasn’t pleasant. But<BR>            the dreams came less and less as time went by. He was grateful, they soiled the memories of his childhood.<P>            Nall sighed and slammed the tiller hard right as the continent of Odus came into view..<P>            -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>            Dirk punched the wall again and left a nasty dent in it roughly the size of a man’s head. He sat down slowly.<P>            “Why?” he whispered.<P>            Suddenly he was filled with a jet of new hatred for the man who had destroyed his life. It all came down to him, everything wrong<BR>            with life. He had no doubt he was even assisting with Trini’s kidnapping.<P>            He plunged into the book he always carried, ignoring the words, not paying attention so much to the passages as to the emotions<BR>            which rose in his heart. He cried for the first time in four years as he relived all the terrible experiences of his life. He was filled with a plague of loathing as he realized who’s fault it really, truly was. Everything, even Maxim.<P>It all came down to her and her kind.<P>            “Damn you, Veeshan. Cazic. All of you! ALL OF YOU! I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU ALL! Why can‘t you leave me alone?!!”<P>            Weeping, Dirk slammed his fist into the wall again, and watched the razor-sharp blades in his gauntlet emerge from the hidden, installed sheaths. There were three of them. A Reaper’s claws, taken from a dead adversary and fused with technology to create a potentially lethal and terrible weapon. They overlapped his fingers, obscuring them all so that only the blades could be seen from the top. He had rarely had to use them.<P>            Dirk smiled grimly and thought of revenge as he retracted the blades and steepled his fingers.<P>            -------------------------------------------<BR>(one Small bit left)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>            Scott was dumped unceremoniously to the ground. His head swam and he battled nausea.<P>            “Didn’t expect us to come out here.” Eris’s voice. He clambered to his feet and saw her seemingly at ease, gazing into what he<BR>            recognized as a forest. The air was faintly obscured with a slightly yellowish mist.<P>            Toxxulia forest. He had trained here. His eyes slid over the terrain with a cool, appraising air. A jumbled collection of ancient stone<BR>            pillars was to his right. He was curious, because he felt a current of unbelievably strong mana flowing inside it. But it subsided even<BR>            as he acknowledged it.<P>            The hairs on his neck rose. Someone was nearby. He motioned silently to Eris and directed her behind one of the pillars, then crawled<BR>            behind one himself.<P>            “Funny. The mana surge seems to have disappeared. I wonder what could have caused that?” The voice was that of a soldier. Scott<BR>            cursed below his breath and drew his sword slowly, ever so slowly, and readied his submachine gun in his left hand. He could hear the<BR>            loading of Eris’s dual pistols. She preferred guns and katar, a kind of dangerous punching dagger.<P>            “I’ll check around here.” Another soldier. Scott appraised the situation. Most likely five. Patrols traveled in fives. He would have to<BR>            throw his own remaining grenade and open up with a lightning mana attack as soon as they got near.<P>            The rim of a helmet entered the corner of Scott’s eye. He threw away the pin and threw the grenade with an overhand toss, then<BR>            sprayed the area with a clip from his weapon.<P>            There was no explosion, just a shriek and a massive white flash. It was a whiteout grenade, and the cries of two men let him know it<BR>            had blinded them and shattered their sensors and radios with the concussion. He pointed his sword at one of them and yelled: “Arc<BR>            Strike!” A bolt of thunderous electricity leapt between them and the stench of burning plastics and flesh mixed. The scream of his<BR>            opponent was angry.<P>            He leapt out of the shelter of the pillars for a split second. He heard the roar of Eris’s pistols and saw red explode from the shoulders,<BR>            neck, and chest of one man, who tumbled like a puppet without a puppeteer.<BR>            Then a chip of stone cut him along the face as a bullet whizzed by his head.<P>            Imagine, if you will, the scene. Smoke mixing with the mist, the remaining four troopers advancing, and no sign of the assailants.<P>            Then it explodes once again. As two men came running his way and encircled him, Scott pulled his blade into the en garde position.<BR>            He twirled them out of the way, and with a series of spins and counters he protected himself from each while slowly bringing them<BR>            onto one side. To watch a skilled swordsman is a mesmerizing experience.<P>            Mesmerizing but deadly.<P>            Swords sang and almost before he knew what hit him, the first man was down, the blade of Scott’s weapon slicing though his armor<BR>            like paper and puncturing frail human flesh with a seemingly gentle stroke of it’s silken edge. He collapsed in a bloody mess, so<BR>            obviously dead that Scott spared him less then a nanosecond’s glance.<P>            The second man lasted only second longer as Scott raised the Despair with his hand. He was ambidextrous, and as the blade caught<BR>            the light it sucked it away, leaving shadow and he sprayed another clip of bullets at the man. He heard a grunt.. There was a low<BR>            shriek and the blade glowed black as it descended.<P>            The concussion as the Despair hit the enemy swordsman was devastating. Scott’s sight was hazy, but he saw the awful effect as the<BR>            sword literally separated his enemy from groin to crown with a single blow and turned the sword he was holding to steel shards. A<BR>            bloody mist hung in the air for a quarter of a second. The black trail the Despair left did not fade away, but slowly dissipated, leaving<BR>            the forest a little darker.<P>            Scott stood in a ready pose. The power of the dark blade flowed through his body like an intoxicating drug, fascinating him, dazzling<BR>            him. It made him feel invincible.<P>            Eris was doing well too. Bullets chattered around her as she whipped through the enemy ranks like a whirlwind, slicing with her katar.<BR>            The two men were bleeding from multiple wounds before they knew what hit them. Her normal aversion to combat had vanished.<P>            The two husks collapsed to the ground. Eris grinned halfheartedly at Scott.<P>            “Let’s move. Palsa.”<P>            The sound of rifles being readied stopped their grin. Scott’s head whipped around to reveal another ten men with weapons pointed.<P>            “Freeze.”<P>            Scott breathed slowly, then screamed.

Because Ch.5 is taking far longer then I orginally thought and I am a nice guy (stop laughing! ), here is what I am             going to do. I am going to break Ch.5 into parts!(  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" border="0"> I am an evil nice guy aren't I? ^-^) So here is what you have all           been waiting for!! pt.1!!!<BR>--------------------<BR>Ch.5 Blood Moon<BR>--------------------<P>----------------<BR>Loc Stamp: Palsian Air Force(P.A.F.) DropShip &lt;i&gt;Flying Nerf Stick&lt;/i&gt;<BR>ETA to LZ Minotaur: 7 minutes<BR>----------------<P>The Lieutenant walked up the ranks making a last inspection, shaking his head in disgust at the new recruits that were added to reinforce the Strikers.<P>"What a bunch of apes…to think this sorry bunch had to be dropped on me.....Maybe I should have Ori turn this bucket around back to Palsa."<P>"Really Lieutenant? Cool!"<P>"Shaddap Hienes. You aren't that lucky. It's slackers like you that are a detriment to the corp. I bet you don't even know the operation."<P>"...You would be correct, Sir!"<P>The Lieutenant shook his head again. "Sarge. Educate them."<P>"Yes, Sir. This is a joint operation to reclaim the accursed continent back, after 500 years of infection by the Dread King. At Zero 9 hundred hours this morning, the Flagship <I>Limiting Factor</I> and the Heavy Gunships <I>Gunsmoke</I> and <I>Hell's Fury</I> commenced bombardment of a 3 mile radial section of terrain near the ButcherBlock Mountains. Approximately, where the ancient seaport once was. By now that area is one large patch of glass. At exactly thirteen hundred hours, we will be going in with first wave. That means more dead for us to rest. Not a problem for the Strykers! Am I right!?!"<P>The soldiers let out cry of affirmation. The Sergeant smiled.<P>" At 15 hundred hours we are scheduled to be in the Greater Faydark. I expect you to do better! I want you in Steamfront by then!  Do you get me!"<P>"WE GET YOU SIR!!"<P>" At that time, En-Gen fast carrier &lt;i&gt; Dew Fray&lt;/i&gt; will rendezvous with us and drop off a contingent of En-Gen Special Forces. We will recall into the Dew Fray and fall back at the HQ set up in the LZ by the En-Gen engineering corp.  At seventeen hundred Faydwer will be ours, not withstanding a few pockets of further resistance. At eighteen hundred, we will be on every news cast on the planet boys. HOO-AH!"<P>"HOO-AH!" Echoed the soldiers.<P>"I hate to interrupt the testosterone flow guys, but LZ Minotaur is dead ahead. 3 minutes till drop. On the ready line!" Ori cut in over the intercom<P>"On the ready line!! Sound off! One! ...Two!!" He called out as the soldiers got up from their seats, sealing their armor and arming weapon systems.<P>Ori opened the comm again. "LZ in 2 minutes and 30 seconds. Opening Doors. Looking good boys!"<P>The sleek dropship's wings swung out from it's tucked position, instantly creating massive drag bringing the craft out of super sonic. As the ocean rapidly diminished giving way to glassy beachhead, the troops of Synwol's Strykers looked in awe at the combined might of the world's mightiest nation and the world's most powerful corporation. Palsa and En-Gen working together in one common goal, the reclamation of the accursed continent...Faydwer.<BR>----------------------------<BR>				   <BR>Dirk leaned against the rail as the Naked Elf descended from the skies. He flinched slightly when he rubbed the bandage on his forehead, where Nall had whacked him with a brick, when he found the hole in the Naked Elf punched into existence by Dirk. He grumbled slightly about it, then laughed as Reyas came bounding out of the lower deck closely pursued by a  hailstorm of objects and clothing.<P>"AND STAY OUT OF MY ROOM!!!!" screeched Annie<P>Reyas massaged his own fuzzy head and then opened his wings and flew up to the helm.  Nall stood at the helm, with a smile on his face 20 miles wide. He had his ship working once again, the wind in his face, a cadre of new friends, and almost as important as the Naked Elf working again......two beautiful girls all for him! His smile grew wider. Sounds of paws hitting the deck, broke him out of his daydream..<P>"Hey Grandpa...what was Annie screaming about?"<P>"Something about her clothes."<P>"Oh."<P>".....or lack of..." he mumbled...<P>"huh?"<P>"Nothing. When will we be setting down?"<P>"About an hour , give or take a few minutes depending on the wind."<P>"Sounds good……"<P>"Something bothering you Grandpa?"<P>"No…well a little…I just have this feeling something big is going to happen...probably just those batwing crunchies I had last night."<BR>--------------------<BR>The Last Chance bar was finally kicking into gear, as the large glass of mead where being passed around. Nosrac Yald the owner of the pub, stepped up to the mic to introduce the first band of the night, much to the crowds delight, the band was one of most popular in all of Norrath.<P>"WELLCOME EVEYWON! I'M GWAD TO SEE YA HERE!!!"<P>The crowd being that it had been waiting a very long time was not a good reception for the poor owner and began to throw things at him while chanting "WE WANT THE BAND! WE WANT THE BAND!!"<P>"AWIGHT! AWIGHT! HERS DA BAND!! ANGEL DUST!!!"<P>The club immediately went black and the battered owner dashed off the stage dodging a few more pieces of food and one chair. A few moments ticked by and then the sounds of drums drifted through the air, the crowd began to stir. A guitar riff joined the drums, the crowd began to cheer. <P>(Music Cue: Control (Apocalypse Remix) by Poe)<P>Spotlights crawled across the rising stage curtain and cast their light on the star. Her wings at first to the audience, this lovely half breed human/Aviak an 'Angel' was at the top of the music scene. The crowd went wild as Cassandra tapped her foot to the beat for a few moments and then as she began to sing, the crowd went insane.<P>&lt;marquee&gt;"Don't you mess with a little girl's dream, 'Cause she's liable to grow up mean. Surprised you to find that I'm laughing? You thought that you'd find me in tears, You thought I'd be crawling the walls, Like a tiny mosquito and trembling in fear, Well you may be king for the moment, But I am a queen understand, And I've got your pawns and your bishops, And castles, All inside the palm of my hand,  While you were looking the other way, While you had your eyes closed, While you were licking your lips, 'Cause I was miserable, While you were selling your soul ,While you were tearing a hole in me…."&lt;/marquee&gt;<P>-----------------<P>Scott and Eris ran and ran as fast as they could, they had managed to dodge the troops twice already, but the chance of doing again where slim, but they knew if they could get to the city of Palsa they would be safe...for a while.<P>After running for a long time and running past old ruins, they finally stopped to rest in the icy tundra at the foot of the Stonebrunt Mountains. They only had a bit of traveling to do but it was mostly uphill, the sprawling city of Palsa was at the base of Mount Claw, several miles away upward.  <P>Eris plopped down on top of rock and sighed heavily, her breath hanging in the frigid air. Scott preferred to stand and just gaze at the majesty of this frozen tundra. He was concerned about Eris, though the troopers for the first part of their flight had chased them, the last hour or so they had been alone. Something was troubling her, but he couldn't figure it out and was unsure about how to ask...she seemed too reserved all of a sudden.<P>He took a deep breath and then turned to face her. "Eris, is the-"<P>"There they are!!! Squad attack!"<P>"****!!" As Scoot whipped back around to face the troopers he caught a glimpse of their armor… Ghost's …their old unit…obviously reinforced with new Ghosts…but still… their former unit.<P>"I suggest you surrender Scott. Dead or alive you're coming with us!"<P>That voice…His former C.O...he never really liked him...oh well...time for payback. The Despair began to glow as it sensed the coming fight. Scott charged forward..	<BR>(End Music-Cue)<BR>---------------------<BR>"Lock and Load Boys!!!" Called Ori "Missiles away! Jump 10 after impact!!!"<P>(Music Cue:Woohoo- Starship Troopers Soundtrack)<P>As the swift dropship skimmed across the earth, four missiles leapt from it's belly. They cut out and slammed into an encroaching line of Fallen. The Fallen where immediately incinerated by the star hot atomic warheads, had it not been for the En-Gen patented mana buffers inside the missiles, they would have gone critical mass and released a devastating far reaching explosion and expelled tons of radiation. But these only glassed 100 meters each and with no more rad then a microwave.<P>The Sarge counted ticks in his head till ten and then cried out "LET's GO STRIKERS!!!" , the Strikers made a loud jarring War cry and stepped out of the dropship. Each one only had to fall about 70 feet and the majority of the velocity from the ship and the fall was cut by light expenditures of jump juice, the remaining Delta Vee was taken in the armor, smoothly like all the Strykers were trained to do.<P>"Form up, sweeping pattern Romengo. Demurs take the point. Lets show these dead some rest!!" the Sarge's orders came through in each of their helmets.<P>The familiar staccato of gunfire disrupted the horrendous moans of the dead...or the Fallen as the military slang goes. For the first time in 500 years, life was beating back death.<BR>(End Music Cue)<BR>----------------------<BR>The crowd was pumped up Angel Dust's performance, it was no wonder why they where the best. The unique sound, the lyrics, Cassandra's long flowing hair with it's streaks of silver and blue and of course her form-fitting revealing outfits. The crowd began to scream as the band geared up for their next song.<P>(Music Cue: "Youth of the Nation" by P.O.D)<P>&lt;marquee&gt; "Last day of the rest of my life , I wish I would've known, Cause I didn't kiss my mama goodbye, I didn't tell her that I loved her and how much I care, Or thank my pops for all the talks, And all the wisdom he shared, Unaware, I just did what I always do, Everyday, the same routine, Before I skate off to school, But who knew that this day wasn't like the rest, Instead of taking a test, I took two to the chest, Call me blind, but I didn't see it coming,  Everybody was running, But I couldn't hear nothing, Except gun blasts, it happened so fast, I don't really know this kid ,Even though I sit by him in class, Maybe this kid was reaching out for love, or maybe for a moment, He forgot who he was, Or maybe this kid just wanted to be hugged,         Whatever it was, I know it's because &lt;/marquee&gt;<P>                                             <BR>  As she got to the chorus, the crowd sang with her.                        <P><BR>&lt;marquee&gt;  We are, We are, the youth of the nation! We are, We are, the youth of the nation! &lt;/marquee&gt;<P>-------------------------<P>"Uh-oh. Knew we shouldn't have got those cheap ones back at Ell-Five"<P>"What is it Nall?"<P>"…Two of the props just died."<P>"!!!!!! I didn't do it!!"<P>"I didn't say you did!!! But if another prop goes…uh-oh…"<P>Two of the remaining three propellers on the Nekkid Elf die and the troubled ship begins a rapid descent. Luckily the airship had already reached Odus, but unfortunately with the problems, they wouldn't be able to land at the Skyport in Palsa. They would have to crash land in the near by Stonebrunt Mountains.<BR>------------------<P>The battle raged between the 2 former ghosts and their old unit. Aided by their new found gifts, they where able to hold their own, unfortunately their long journey was taking it's toll upon them and they couldn't best the Ghost units. As things seemed their darkest, it became literally quite darker.<P>Both groups noticed the larger shadow being cast upon them and the looked up toward the sun too see a very large ship blocking out the light…making a very uncoordinated fall to the ground…as the groups stared slack jawed forgetting about the fight, they soon noticed the ship was getting bigger and closer…to them.<P>"It's going to crash land here!!!!" Both Scott and his former C.O called out.<P>Taking advantage of the moment, Eris to her surprise cast an ancient magic, the Ghost unit's feet sank deep into the earth with out further delay she grabbed a slack-jawed Scott and dragged him away from the area. A few moments later the Nekkid Elf slammed into the mountain range into what could have been thought as a minor earthquake, it slid across the icy tundra tearing up the landscape and soon came to a rest.<P>As time past, a cargo door in the back of the Elf opened and Nall's cadre stumbled out, obviously shaken up by the crash… except for Nall and Annie.<P>(End Music cue)<P>"WHAT KIND OF PILOTING DO YOU CALL THAT!?!"<P>"YOU'RE ALIVE, AREN'T YOU?!! I told you we shouldn't have skimped on those gears! But nooooo, Miss CopperPinch had to get the cheap gears! "What harm could it do Nall, gears are all the same Nall!"<P>He glowered at her for a minute and then walked around to survey the ship. For the most part, the Elf was unharmed aside from some red marks on the keel and some large paint scratches that brought Nall to tears. "My poor baby…don't you worry, Nall will fix you right up, don't you worry."<P>Lilith wandered over to Nall to comfort him, Reyas preferred just to wander around with Dirk to survey the area, leaving Annie alone by herself.<P>"Do you have to sit on my head?"<P>"Yes, it's nice and warm up here."<P>"…Infernal- hmmm. Looks like we have company."<P>As Scott and Eris slowly came into view, a chill ran through Dirk's spine. He could feel two underlying presences with these two.<P><I>It's them again. </I> Dirk's hand went to his pistol and he examined the two young soldiers closer.<P>He's carrying the Despair...and why do I feel Tunare's aura emanating from the girl?<P>The boy wielding the Despair held it at ready unsure what to make of the pale-skinned elf...with the winged cat on his head. He seemed almost ready to attack, but the girl put her hand on his shoulder relaxing him. Somehow she seemed to recognize Dirk, even though she hadn't exactly had time for introductions. She walked up to Dirk and introduced herself.<P>"It's us again."<P>Dirk hesitated. "I'm glad you're ok, but….are you?"<P>"I'm sorry for being so hesitant with you, but we have been running for our lives for some time, but we do owe you our lives. Your ship saved us from being captured by En-Gen."<P>"En-Gen again…they are always up to something…Well any way, My name is Dirk Lunas and this infernal cat who won't get off my head is Reyas." Dirk made an ineffectual attempt to knock Reyas off.<P>"Hi!" Reyas chimed in<P>"He can speak?"<P>"Yes I can!" And with that Reyas hopped off Dirk's head and into Eris's arms. "Let's head back to the ship so we can introduce you to the rest of our group. We were heading to Palsa until the ship broke down. "<P>"Fate seems to have brought us together then, we where also heading to Palsa"<P>"So it seems, my you're nice and warm… Hey Dirk! The ship is this way!"<P>"I have other things to attend to, once I am done, maybe we'll meet again." Dirk called back as he trudged up the mountain, leaving the Elf and the group behind.<P><I> Here I come...Maxim.</I><P>-------------------------------<BR>Several hours later, Nall and his companions made there way into the shining city of Palsa. Each of them with various goals in mind, Annie and Scott where sent to get gears for the Elf...with specific instructions to get the good ones this time. Lilith, who was goggle eyed at the majesty of this place, went out exploring, while Eris, Reyas and Nall were supposed to have been getting info about the temple of Cazic-Thule, being that it wasn't one of things generally talked about in a city like this, but instead they went to bar or more accurately Nall went to a bar to console his sorrows about his yet again damaged Elf dragging the other two with him. It just so happens that the bar he went to, was The Last Chance.<P>It had quieted down a bit in the Last Chance, since the band had taken a break. So Nall was able to get a few rounds of med at the table in front of the stage. After his 7th or 8th round, the lights went out and the spotlights shined on the curtain and the owner shouted through the loudspeakers to pump the crowd up again<P>"HEWWO EVEHONE!! WETS GWIVE A WROUND OF APWAUSE AS OUR BAND COMES BWACK ON! GWIVE IT UP FWOR ANGEL DUST!!!!"<P>Nall and Reyas froze when the owner said the band name. The band behind the curtain began to play and the crowd began to go wild.<P>(Music Cue: "Get the Party Started' by Pink)<P>&lt;marquee&gt; I'm comin up so you better get this party started, I'm comin up so you better get this party started! Get this party started on a Saturday night, Everybody's waiting for me to arrive, Sending out the message to all of my friends, We'll be looking flashy in my Gnomecedes Benz,  I got lots of style check my platinum diamond rings, I can go for miles if you know what I mean, I'm coming up so you better get this party started!!!&lt;/marquee&gt;<P>The curtain slowly rose revealing the band on the chorus , revealing Cassandra with her back to the audience, she turned to face the cheering crowd and the last line of the chorus.<P>"I'm comin up so you better get this party started!!!" And at that moment she noticed Nall sitting in the front row.<P>"YOU!" and with that she gave the audience a puzzle to figure out and something to really scream about. She pulled two semi-auto Gnome and Becker pistols out of her skin- tight outfit and opened fire on Nall.<P>-----------------------------------<P><BR>Dirk was in a curious state both excited yet enraged about the coming moments. Revenge was at hand. Maxim would pay...preferably screaming.<P>As he entered the dark hall of the Temple of Cazic-Thule, several initiates began protesting and made to oust him. <P>"Begone Elf! Visiting ours are over, come back tomorrow!"<P>Dirk smiled and twirled the pointer finger on his right hand and spoke in a sing-song voice "Fiiiirrre" His hand ignited into night-dark flames.<P>The lowly initiates where startled by this and scampered away.<P>Dirk chuckled "Mom always said I hand a radiant personality...heh" he proceeded inward unobstructed, but he quickly grew agitated as Maxim was no where to be found.<P>"MAXIM!!! I know you are here!!! Come out and face me!!!!" Nothing happened, no Maxim. "Fine! Then I will tear this place apart! DEVIL FLARE!!!" The ground around Dirk ignited in black flames and everything within a 15-foot radius was destroyed. That got a response.<P>Fluid, red tendrils of fire crept out of the darkness, flowed around the majestic pillars and idols of Cazic-Thule, all conglomerating in front of Dirk. In a few moments the fires gave away to the form of Maxim. Though he did show it, somehow this Erudite gave Dirk chills...except for the Dread King, he had never felt any one so in touch with and in control of death, but he pushed those thoughts out of his mind, he was here for one purpose.<P>Maxim breathed shallowly, it hung in the piercing cold air for a long time undisturbed...until a shadow chain shot of the darkness.<BR>--------------------------<P>"Ahh....Shamus! Good to see you! Things are going so splendidly. Finally after all this preparation Faydwer will be free! And best of all the world will finally show us the respect we deserve! Truly a great day!"<P>"..."<P>"What is wrong?"<P>"I'm afraid it maybe a while before we can celebrate sir. Things are not going well from the prelims. Resistance is stronger then even the most conservative estimates. The forces are not only encountering 10 times-"<P>"10 TIMES?"<P>"Yes sir..10 times the original Fallen estimates...they are also encountering Fallen types never seen before...races, beasts until know never known to be in existence…The Palsian forces are being decimated. I doubt they will be able to make it to the Waypoints, which will multiply the task load of our Ghosts exponentially. Sir, you know I am the greatest proponent of the Ghosts, but I don't think even they can handle this...and it's only going to get worse...I'm afraid the Palsian government, didn't equip their troops with the Dead man switches."<P>"WHAT!!!"<P>"Yes...they felt it was excessive and wasteful of lives to equip them with the explosives in case of turning. If...no when the Palsian troops die, they are going to be turned and start fighting back with our own equipment...Sir...we may have to consider...aborting and blasting Faydwer from Stratorbit...unless we get a miracle, I believe Faydwer will never be released, glassing the accursed continent would be the only sure way preventing Fallen spread."<P>The Overseer, stared forlornly at his desk...what to do. So much was invested in this...all the technology and might of the world was behind this...how could they be beaten...The people of Odus beat the Dread King before with only swords and arrows...we have bombs, guns, superior training. It was not possible...but wait...he knew like Shamus...or perhaps even better then Shamus the awesome power of the Ghosts. Though their burden would be many times heavier...they could free Faydwer.<P>The Overseer looked back up to Shamus. "No, revise the plan to accommodate the failures of Palsian troops. Reroute the Ghosts and deploy them. They can carve through them, also draw up a plan to supplement the Beachhead...even if this goes sour we are going to maintain a forward base on Faydwer. It belongs to us and we are going to reclaim it...but you are right...even our Ghosts will need help...Patch me through to Deep Star Six"<BR>-----------------------

----------------------- <BR>                        The two battled on and on Dirk dodged wave after wave of chain barrages, he tried as hard as he<BR>                        could to manage against this incredible onslaught....and ten it happened…he saw it! There it was shining<BR>                        like beacon...an open place to strike in Maxim's barrage. He seized the moment, chains barely missing<BR>                        him, his gauntlet claw extended and dug into Maxim's neck and out the other side. <P>                        "This is for Jesi! DEVIL FLARE!!" Maxim was consumed by the dark flames and incinerated. AS the<BR>                        magical flow, began to ebb Dirk collapsed panting, the battle had tired him...but at last...he avenged<BR>                        Jesi...Maxim was gone...forever. As he began to settle into the Euphoria of that thought, something<BR>                        dashed in his peripheral vision. He turned to the movement, to see a Shadow beast lunging at him, it's<BR>                        teeth bared. It was too quick there was nothing he could do...this was it... <P>                        Or so he thought, the beast growled slightly as it bounced off an invisible barrier. The beast clawed at<BR>                        the barrier, but was unable to get past it. It growled once again and faded into the darkness. As it<BR>                        disappeared, Dirk heard the sounds of footsteps behind him, he turned to the sounds. <P>                        "You!" <P>                        "Is that any way to talk to the person that saved your life?" Rashan replied in that disturbing overlapping<BR>                        voice. <P>                        "Should I be thankful? The first we met, you helped the kidnapping of my daughter and the last time<BR>                        you tried to turn me into flambé!" <P>                        "Hmm. I can always allow Maxim to kill you if you would like" Rashan said motioning to the shadows<BR>                        behind Dirk <P>                        "Maxim's dead." Dirk stated proudly as he got to his feet <P>                        "So you think Black Elf, but unfortunately for you Hell Lords…even undeserving ones are far more<BR>                        durable then you would think. Maxim is still quite alive, the fact that I just stopped his familiar from<BR>                        tearing you apart is proof of that." <P>                        "A Shadow beast...A familiar?" <P>                        "Yes, it is interesting how Thule has been dolling out familiars for his knights...a shadow beast here, a<BR>                        dragon there. Heh…well. I guess it isn't amusing to one such as yourself." <P>                        Rashan vanished. <P>                        "Humph, so why do I have the honor of your presence freak?" Dirk called out as he spun around<BR>                        looking for Rashan. It took a moment but he found Rashan standing on top of a large idol of<BR>                        Cazic-Thule<P>                        "Tsk, tsk Dirk. There is no need for name calling. I have come here, to help you." <P>                        "Help me! Hah! I don't see how you can be of any help to me!" <P>                        "Hmm maybe not, but at least do me the courtesy of hearing me out for saving your life. I think you may<BR>                        like my proposition." <P>                        "Hah, I doubt it, but please go on" He said putting as much contempt he could in his voice. <P>                        "What I wish from you, is to stop your companions from retrieving the Void keys. That is all." <P>                        "This helps me how?" <P>                        "In exchange for keeping them from retrieving the keys, I will tell you how to kill Maxim." <P>                        "No deal! I can kill him on my own!" <P>                        "Oh really?" Rashan vanished again and the shadow beast reappeared charging Dirk, with the barrier<BR>                        gone it crashed right into Dirk spilling him on the floor. The foul thing pounced on top of Dirk and sank<BR>                        it's teeth into his shoulder but before it could do anymore damage, it began to howl in pain and quickly<BR>                        receded back into the darkness. <P>                        Rashan appeared above Dirk looking down on the batter elf. <P>                        "I thought you said you could handle Maxim?" <P>                        "Yes.....I know…I said Maxim...I said nothing about Shadow beasts......" <P>                        Rashan laughed slightly, but sobered quickly. Dirk got back onto his feet and stood face to face with<BR>                        Rashan. <P>                        "Still no deal…I want Maxim dead, yes...but he is only luxury that presented himself.." <P>                        "I see. I know what you want" <P>                        "Do you?" <P>                        "Trini." <P>                        "Yes, give me back my daughter and I will stop Lilith and Nall from acquiring the keys...I don't care<BR>                        about them or you for that matter. Trini is all that matters." <P>                        Rashan softly laughed again <P>                        "You care much the child, even though she is not truly yours...Most admirable Dirk." <P>                        Dirk's face contorted with shock. "What do you mean?" <P>                        "Hehe.." Rashan vanished again. <P>                        "DAMN IT COME BACK HERE!!!!" <P>                        Rashan began to speak again from behind Dirk. "Trini is not truly your daughter, being an elf yourself<BR>                        you should know that elven pregnancies can vary wildly, from say 4 months or several years." <P>                        Dirk went pale...no this couldn't be... Elven pregnancies could last a long time...that could mean...that<BR>                        Jesi could have been pregnant when she returned back to Faydwer with him... making.. <P>                        "....Maxim is?" <P>                        "Yes and no." <P>                        "What do you mean?" <P>                        "In actuality, Void is more of the 'father' then either of you, but I'll explain that in a moment. Suffice it to<BR>                        say, both You and Maxim are Trini's father." <P>                        "That...just can't be! That's…That's-" <P>                        "Impossible" Rashan said finishing Dirk's sentence. "Nothing is impossible , especially when you are so<BR>                        close to Void's influence." <P>                        "Explain!" <P>                        "Kymura...I'm sorry Tunare, never really told you why she wanted you to guard her temple in Faydwer<BR>                        did she?...Well, I am not surprised by that, but hadn't you ever wondered about the barrier surrounding<BR>                        the temple?" <P>                        "Yes, but I always thought it was the last of her powers." <P>                        "In a way it was, you see Tunare did not want Void to be released, so she asked you to guard her<BR>                        Void key, but thing is you are just a mortal after all, so despite the great trust she placed in you, she did<BR>                        not completely do so. So with her dying breath and amplifying it through the power of the key she<BR>                        created the barrier around the temple. You see the key is the strength and weakness of the barrier and<BR>                        your promise to Tunare." <P>                        "Continue" <P>                        "While the key would ensure that the Dread King or any other evil influence would penetrate to steal it,<BR>                        it being a part of the Void, could radiate Void's influence, namely your beloved and 'faithful' Jesi. Void<BR>                        poisoned her mind to seek out some one as strong or stronger then you and conceive a child. With this<BR>                        completed, she returned to you and Void then combined a part of you into the child with in her.<BR>                        Creating Trini for Void's purposes, namely to become a host." <P>                        "A host? For what or whom!" <P>                        "You already know, you just aren't using your head." <P>                        Dirk was still numb from all this information that was being dumped on him...he couldn't think....then it<BR>                        hit him. <P>                        "My corporeal form may be destroyed....but I will always return...but even so....my new form....will<BR>                        be able to contain...all of my power......not just a token...like Veeshan's gift......"<P>                        "Soon.....the child's soul and corporeal bind...will belong...to me...just ....as the soul and corporeal bind<BR>                        of the..... mother belongs to Palsa......" <P>                        "Soon...you will see.....Dirk........Lunas......." <P>                        "NO!!!" Dirk leapt at Rashan, unable to contain his anger, but he was caught by an unseen force that<BR>                        clamped on his neck and began to tighten. <P>                        "Do try to keep your temper under control Dirk, I would hate to see anything unfortunate happen to<BR>                        you." <P>                        The force released Dirk and he crashed to the ground. <P>                        "...the dread King...my Trini…was created...for the Dread King?" <P>                        "Yes. Like all things, Void hates imprisonment. So Void will stop at nothing to be free, whether it be<BR>                        persuading combinate creatures such as Lilith or beings such as the Dread King. It makes no difference<BR>                        how it is done, just as long as Void is freed. So in a way you should thank me Lunas." <P>                        "Thank you!?!" <P>                        "Right now, your child is safe and protected and in excellent hands. In fact, as of right now, she is<BR>                        probably playing some sort of Video entertainment with her favorite Uncle…or as you know him, the<BR>                        Overseer of En-Gen." <P>                        "AAAAAAH!!!" Dirk leapt again at Rashan, but again the same force caught him and clamped down,<BR>                        this time though it slammed into the ground knocking the wind of him. <P>                        "Take my advice Dirk, do not try that again. You have neither the skill nor the power to harm me." <P>                        The force let go of Dirk and he gasped for breath. <P>                        "So, if I promise to tell you how to kill Maxim and allow you to see your Daughter, will you stop your<BR>                        companions?" <P>                        "...What if I refuse?" <P>                        "I will find some other means of stopping them, most likely it will be forceful but oh well, and you will<BR>                        never be able to kill Maxim or find out where your daughter is. Well, think about Dirk, the choice is<BR>                        yours." <P>                        Rashan vanished again and now devastated emotionally and to a lesser extent, physically Dirk cried<BR>                        unsure of what else to do.<P>                        ---------------------<BR>                        End of Part 1.
