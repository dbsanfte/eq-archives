I was in a group last night in Solb (Champ Room), and it was a good group! After me threatening to 'unmem' mez a couple of times, it really truly was a good group!  For the most part everyone was assisting and things were going quite well.  In fact, dare I say it, I was even a little bored for a bit there and said as much to the group. I enjoy the excitement of a couple of adds/fast pulls/etc.  A rogue that was grouped with us jokingly said "Laby is always bored unless she's got 14 adds to deal with".  Personally, I believe he was exaggerating just a bit   <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"> <P><BR>Anyway,,,not a soul was in lbat, so our puller started pulling from there as well pulling from the king and priest rooms.  Refresh celerity and aug and the puller goes out to pull. He's got a couple of adds!! I'm thinking "WOOOHOOO!!!" - I may even have yelled it! I live for adds ya know ;-)  Here they come, 2 beetles and 2 bats!  Yessss!!  I'm awake now.  I get the two bats mezzed and while throwing a mez on the second beetle I hear "Peel" from one of the clerics (we had 2), turn around toward the cleric, throw a mez on the kobold that is on him, and out of the corner of my eye, I see another kobold pop in the room- another quick mez takes care of him.  By this time, the rogue and sk (and mage pet) are on the second beetle and making fast work of it.   I've got 2 bats and 2 kobolds sitting on ice. And I'll be damned if shaman and pet didn't run into the room.  Toss off two mezzes on them, refresh the mez on the bat and sit down real quick. By this time the second beetle is dead and they are working on one of the bats.  I'm wondering if I can hold everything - this really seems like too many. HAHAHA!!  Surprise, here comes another shaman and pet!  Stand, mez, mez, sit.  Mez breaks on one of the Soluseks and it's on the cleric.  Stand, run over, target, mez the Solusek - sit.  Mage pet is on something - at this point I don't even bother saying anything - I just let it go.  Another of the kobolds mez breaks - at about the same time they have killed the first bat - so the group makes fast work of that particular kobold (I believe it was one of the shaman).  I've still got a bat on ice, and I lost count of how many kobolds.  Champion pops!!! HOLY %&*$!!!  "Mezzing a Kobold Champion".  "20M"  The mage is trying to cast another pet but he has a kobold on him (I'm assuming the one that killed his first pet) so I stand up and mez that.  I yell for the group to take the BAT next.  I KNOW that the mez on the bat is next to break and I'm down to 20m.  They saw the Champion,,, so who do they go after next?   The Champion!!!  I'm yelling: <BR>"BAT"<BR>"BAT"<BR>"BAT NEXT"<BR>Puller is yelling:<BR>"Champ"<BR>"Hail a Kobold Champion"<BR>And they break mez on the Champion.  Grrrrr,,,    Refresh mez on the bat. Sit, hit escape to clear my target, and wait to get hit.   I've still got 4 or so kobolds on ice, plus the bat and I'm just a little hot under the collar.  I give the group a small piece of my mind.  "Dammit!! You need to listen to me.  I know what I have a harder time keeping mezzed, and generally which  mez is going to break next".  The mage laughs at me,, grrrr,, I tell him "I'm dead serious here".  They concede and I think all is well on that front at least.  I stand up, retarget and refresh a couple of the mezzes.  Down to 10M now and I say as much to the group.  (Actually, I believe I told them I had ZERO mana) and I suggest that maybe we should zone.  A bat and 4 kobolds still on ice and I'm doubting my ability to keep the rest just sitting there. I again tell them to "ZONE please"!  No one listens, no one goes for the zone, instead they just work their way through.  Once the bat was dead, the kobolds were a piece of cake.   LOL,, how we pulled it off, I still don't know but we did!!  I was able to throw out a couple more  mezzes and we just did it!!   That was exhilarating!!  It was wonderful!!!  When all was said and done, there were 12 corpses on the ground.  I was OOM, clerics were LOM and I suggested a small break to let us med for a few.   <P>Here's where it gets a bit screwy.  I get up to about 40m when clarity needs refreshed on everyone.  4 clarities later and I'm back down to 30m.  Mage leaves the group, puller decides to pull "just one".<BR>In come 3.  Mez, mez, sit.  "20m".  Ranger joins the group.  At 30m I stand up and aug her, refresh aug on the rogue and SK, telling him that he gets aug for now, and  celerity when I med up a bit more and announce that I'm at 20M, and please could I med to at least 40m - I need to recast buffs on myself.<BR>He pulls again (grrrrr...)  In come 3 (?) again - not real sure on the number, I was getting a bit angry at this point.  I stand up, mez, mez, sit.  Ranger asks mid-battle "Can I have clarity please?"   I respond, "after the fight when I have mana".  <BR>"20M"<BR>Ranger: "Clarity please"<BR>Me: "I need to med please"<BR>Puller: "inc a 'whatever he happens to get'"<BR>Puller in a tell to me: "We have two clerics, I can keep pulling"<BR>Me in a tell to Puller: "If we get room pops and a pull like the last big fight, we're going to be in trouble"<BR>Ranger: "Clarity please"<BR>Me: "Give me a minute and I'll give you clarity!"<BR>Puller: "Incoming a couple more even though I know you asked for a break"<BR>Mez, (ranger: "Clarity please") mez, sit<BR>Me: "10m"<BR>Me: "After this I need to go."<BR>Puller in a tell to me:  "Aw, I'm sorry. Please stay, I'll wait for you to med a bit"<BR>Ranger: "Clarity please"<BR>Puller: "Inc a 'something or other'"<BR>I sit down, mem gate, stand up and cast clarity on the ranger, say my goodbyes and gate out.<P>Grrrr,,, such a good group, we worked well together, but at the end it just kind of fell apart.  It didn't seem like anyone was listening.   Or maybe I am just too high-strung or a control freak in these kinds of situations,  but after a big fight like described, if there is an opportunity, I need a little breather, I want to med back up a bit, and make sure I've got my own buffs refreshed as well as everyone elses.  When I didn't get that opportunity, after mentioning several times that I needed to med, I had to leave.  <P>After I gated I got a tell from the puller.  "You were awesome!! I loved grouping with you"  <BR>hehehe<P><BR>Labyrrinth<BR>45 Enchanter<BR>Rodcet Nife

Laby,<BR>A couple of points....<BR>1)  You rock.  Solidly. What you describe was an enchanter at her finest.  /bow<P>2)  You were overpulled.  I know the old saying that the cleric says when to pull, and the enchanter says what next - but that only goes so far.  Sometimes the enchanter has to be able to call a medding break too, specifically after the mess you described - and handled beautifully.  <P>2a)  Next time you group with that puller, /duel him.  I'm serious.  You weren't using AOEs anyway (or I presume you would have!), and the next time he went out to pull when you were at 10 mana you could root him on the spot.  I've only had to do it to a tank once, but he learned FAST that when I say it's time to med, it's time to damn well med.  (Don't mezz them, they can't fight on spawns if you do.)<P>3)  Don't be mad at the ranger, many hybrids feel ignored by enchanters and bug us for clarity repeatedly because they think they won't get it at all.  I don't understand it, but I've been told that MANY times.  Also, this ranger had just joined your group, so he/she wasn't in the groove yet.<P>Feel proud, chanter girl.  You did all of us honor that night.<P>SoulFrost DeDanaan<BR>50th Enchanter<BR>Order of the Jade Dragon<BR>Xegony

Particularly don't get mad at the ranger in that group cause they typically snare and don't get to med.  But, you are right it is not at all uncommon for hybrids (or anybody for that matter) to not understand/care why you can't buff them exactly when they are ready for it.<P>Truth is in a 2 cleric group, you can often leave some stuff unmezzed/unslowed.  This is, of course, assuming that they aren't mana hosed too.  That's hard for us enchanters to accept, but you should really be trying to balance out the mana among all the support classes.  So if you are at 30 mana and the 2 clerics are at 80, let the tanks get whacked for a bit.  And, if they complain about it you have some support in the argument that you need to slow down.  And, if the tanks complain, then you've proved your point.  It sounds like exactly what the group wanted you to do.  We don't have to do everything to our maximum potential all the time if it means that the group as a whole can speed up.<P>Suna

Laby, it would be an honor to be in your group anytime.  I think a chanter in that situations must, I mean MUST be a control freak.  You know your spells.  You know what you can keep messed.  You know what mob is going to wake up first.  You know that if it goes bad, you will be the first to die.  That gives you control.  If they dont give you the control, do what you did.

When u get those big pulls try working charm in there... it will end up saving you mana more than likely because the mobs will die a lot faster and almost always lasts longer than a mez (with tash and 200cha). Hehe its a way to manage mana kinda, also AoE mez only costs 70 mana (or 50?)and will definately lower stress rate on you. <P>Other than that you seem to have complete control of your Enc. Hehe you are doing it the hard way imo wth all those single mezzes but thats just my play style =D<P><BR>Vizier<BR>50th Easy going Enchanter on Fennin

Depends on how good the puller is, and how good your group is. After the initial break the enchanter should have an easier time simply because spawns become staggered. If he is a competent puller, he may try to break in as much as he can before the room repops. While playing my warrior, I often stretch the enchanter to the breaking point initially. I also push to keep the spawns broken while people are AFK. The real key is if the puller is good and if he understands the limits of his group. I've been in groups where the cleric has to be 80% mana before a pull, and others where the cleric has 20% mana he's GTG.<P>Also, remember that you don't have to mez every single mob. If a puller is bored, let him get beat down by a couple mobs. People become ansy pulling when the cleric is LOM and they are at 40% health. Just don't do it out of spite, cause they can come back to haunt you.<P>By the sounds of it, you did a pretty good job.

Great work Labyrrinth!<P>No one, with the exception of your fellow enchanter compatriots, realizes how stressful our job can be especially in the situation that you described.<P>I have found myself logging off from EQ for the night and being unable to sleep for hours based on a nerve-racking grouping that I experienced that night.  I believe that no other class in the game experiences the same amount of taxing stress.  That is why I love being an enchanter!  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>--------------------<P>-Meobed<BR>46 Erudite Enchanter<BR>Bristlebane Server

Funny Laby,<P>Who was the ranger?  Was it Standly?  I've been camping the king a lot lately on Rodcet, and after 30 seconds of grouping with him, I added him to my never ever group with again list.  So did my wife, and the rest of my group.<P>He joins our group:<P>'Hail Standly!<BR>'Welcome Standly.<BR>'Hiya Standly.<BR>Standly says, 'Buffs plz.'<BR>I had just given him celerity and was refreshing clarity on all group members as a timer, when he said it.  And of course I'm like, oh no.<BR>So my wife reso's him, AoF, I give him RM after refreshing the group.  Then he goes out to pull, even though we had a puller already.<P>We say, 'xxx is pulling for us Standly.'<P>Standly, 'O'<BR>Standly, 'I gotta go.  Bye.'<BR>And not but .1 seconds later:<BR>Standly has left the group.<P>Where do these people come from?<P>Oh well.  See ya in game Laby.  Glad to see another Rodcet enchanter on these boards.<P>Fyre

The best way i have found of handling that situation ( short of disbanding the group), is to announce to the group :<P>20M medding through.<P><BR>If they choose to pull at that point, especially with 2 clerics, just let them get whacked on, while you med.<P>Sounds like you did everything you should have done from a crowd control point, and there was nothing wrong with you asking for a short med time to buff yourself, etc.<P>Some pullers want to push us faster than we want to go.  If you announce to the group you are medding through, and they bring in 3 mobs, unless it will create a life or death situation dont mez them.<P>The clerics will complain about getting hit, the tanks will say  "ADD", to which you reply, i said i was 20m, and medding through.<P>Dont step in unless it looks like the group is going to be killed.  <P>Pulling tanks KNOW that enchanters will mezz adds, regardless of whether they say they want to med a bit or not.  They know we cant stand to see mobs running around.<P>Once they understand when you say "medding through", you actually mean " medding through", they will usually adjust their play style accordingly.<P><BR>Another thing too.. Groups will ALWAYS go for the named mob next, regardless of WHAT the enchanter says.  It is a VERY rare group that has the discipline to leave that mob mezzed until the enchanter says to go for it.  If a named mob is inc, or pops, dont even bother mezzing it most times cause THAT mob is the one everyone is gonna jump on.<P>I wish they wouldnt, cause just like in your case there are plenty times when it SHOULD be left mezzed, but they see the potential phat lewts, and go for it /shrug.

If people won't listen to you, don't buff em. (i'd hold buffs until i have more mana in a situation like that, although admittedly clarity costs like nothing).<P>i dont usually call mez order but when i do, people know to listen.<P>High-strung isn't the correct description -- there are times when we need to be listened to in order to do our jobs. I like continuous pulling and being trained as much as the next guy unless I'm LOM. And unlike some other classes (well, clerics deal with this) we can have to deal with the prospect of going AFK a sec and coming back to the whole group dead. (just happened once to me, i swear i was gone ten seconds).<P>In future if someone's pushing you too hard, just call LOM, medding afk. then stand up and walk around the room once or so, take a deep breath, and resume. then do some buffs. if you call AFK to group and turn on the flag, and the puller brings adds anyway, then it's their damn fault.<P>--------------------<P>Andrewe<BR>lvl 52 enchanter, Bristlebane

Sounds like a fun fight, You did fine  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">.<P>I/m with the poster that mentioned throwing a chram in there.  I use charm in similar situations, stopping the wizzie ledge while in SR/BR with the room repoping, pulling the whole bar area in Sol A, and most recently in KC-RCY and well. <P>Mana management:  I usually try to balance mana with the cleric.  You had two and could have left some stuff unslowed or even unmesed for a bit to even out the mana load.  As for the ranger, he was new to the group(to his credit) but he should have also known that he needs to wait till you have sufficient mana to be able to do your primary role, CC.  He can regen mana faster later or be FM after he sees the LOADING sign when his low AC butt gets smacked down.<P>Best, <P>Finbarr

Thank you everyone, very much, for the compliments, comments, and suggestions.  I guess I just needed to know if I was being unreasonable at any time during what I described.  Mind you, no one in my group ever insinuated such a thing,,, it was my own conscious at work   <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"> <P>I now have a few ideas of ways to deal with the situation should it ever (I should say WHEN) it happens again.  The fight itself was fine,, wonderful in fact!!  It was the time afterwards that got to me (in truth, probably a combination of the two).  It won't next time! LOL<P>As for leaving a mob unmezzed?  <GASP!>  Surely you jest.  There just seems to be something extraordinarily unnatural about that!!  I see an extra out there I have to mezz!  LOL    Seriously though, I will try that sometime.<P>Charming?  I've practiced it a bit and if I were in a group of regulars I might try it.  Truth be told though, I am not comfortable enough with it myself to subject my group to it - especially in the fight described. This is definitely something I need to work on eventually!  Dreadlands (outdoors - YUCK!!!) here I come,,, <P>And Fyre - Hi there :-) I've seen you a few times in Solb - was wondering if you were one and the same as on these boards.  Now I know!  As for the ranger, LOL, no it wasn't Standly, but yes, I've had a run in or two with him.  Not a bad guy, more like a puppy full of energy.  He wants to GO GO GO!!  Just need to keep an eye out when he's around, LOL.  Ok, correction, when he's anywhere in the same zone.<P>Labyrrinth<BR>45 Enchanter<BR>Rodcet Nife

Well, myself being a Cleric, I think ya did a great job! I tend to always listen to the chanter in the group before I say I'm gtg. You guys are the one's that allow me to do my job, and the last thing I want is some mob bashin on me while i'm tryin ta heal. In the above case, if chanter say's need to med a bit, I say ok, gonna get a drink of water, brb, and take a quick break of my own. <P>Oren Grudgebearer

Personally I am usually pretty easy going.  I DID lose it the other night in Sebilis in an exit group though.  On our way there we got trained and had about 5 frogs on us.  I use AE mezz and AE stuns so I can usually deal with this sort of thing...provided I get a heal if I get multiple interrupts.<P>Well, I didn't.  I got whacked on for several rounds without any support from the cleric, who, it turned out, was healing the tanks during the fight when they were no where near <50%.  The result was my death, the death of the cleric, and the tanks making it out safely.<P>Anyhow, I said, in group, that I was going to leave if the cleric did not pay attention to my health bar.  The cleric then disbanded and left, refusing me a rez.<P>I guess it was a crappy thing to say but honestly!  I had had a bad day and was just not in the mood.  Usually I am innured to the "Chanter EXP peanalty" of dying once per fight but I just couldn't take it.<P>Ugh.<P>Alariel, 54 chanter

if i'm ever low low low on mana and there's no casters to theft it from, i mem level 4 mez.   its only like 25 mana, and it always casts for me even if i can barely see any blue.  granted u have to refresh it more often, but its better then trying to cast entrance and getting the ha ha ha you're oom message.  once i get my mana back to a decent level i'll switch back to entrance.

You were in the right.  On the other hand I find that alot of times groups are too cautious and don't push themselves to see what they can really do and handle.  Groups that drive me nuts are the ones that have to be near full mana to pull...and so on.  Alot of times you can push the envelope a bit and you will be suprised by what you can handle.<BR>   Oh yeah advice...find a good puller and always look him up for a group.  Soon you will work together seamlessly.<P>--------------------<P>Zvezda Darkesbane<BR>Enchanter of the 59th Circle, Vision<BR>Ayonae Ro

As a warrior, I'd agree with the people that said just med through.  Personally, if I'm pulling and the enchanter is OOM but I've got 2 clerics at 80 mana, I'm gonna keep on pulling.  I know the chanter is medding, so I'll try for singles or doubles, but I'll assume we can survive without every mob being mezzed all the time.  <P>When the clerics are out of mana, it's time for a med break (this will never happen with 2 clerics with clarity unless there is a big wreck).  Just let the puller know that you won't be helping unless it's a disaster, and trust them to pull stuff that the group can handle without you.  If they pull too much and someone dies, then it's time to tell them to knock it off or lose their enchanter.<P>Sounds like you did an awesome job mezzing that much stuff with low mana, but sometimes you have to just trust your group and med. <P>Just a meathead opinion (65 int)<P><BR>Also, I'll second what Zvezda said, nothing rocks  more than a group that has played a lot together and knows everyone's limitations.

I have experienced the ranger feels left out thing too.  I am only level 20, but when I grouped with her, a monk, and a rogue, she was very appreciative of the quickness.  She said other enchanters don't bother with quickness on her and they have even called her "a lesser tank."

When charm wears off in 7 seconds (heh it always does when you need it to hold awhile) you've completely wasted hundreds of mana by the time the mob is under control.  Having 200 charisma and tashing the mob has never really made much of a difference for me either unfortunately.

Firstly let me say, knowing Champion room well, nice job!  Champion room in my experience, is one of the rockier spawn camps to hold.  Reminded me strongly of LTR and AoF in Cazic.  A strong group could be doing really well for hours, then a mix of a few things happening at once and you are telling your evacer the word<P>As for pullers pulling when told not to, heh I have been on both sides of this frustrating situation.<P>As a SK and dungeon/puller specialist it was always my philosophy to keep the enc and cleric as busy as possible.  If you can clear an area through, it becomes that much more stable and easy to maintain.  A steady flow of 1s to 3s being far preferable to the pull of four at same time as a repop, then dragging two more as you come back...<P>As a puller I don't sit down.  I run to a routine loop (that way you know what will pop next), and I pull asap.  With a chanter in group I will almost never split.  3 or four mobs should be no probs to a full group with an enchanter.  (As an aside thats why I dont like monks generally  they split a lot, slowing down pulls/xp, when the enchanter actually does the job better)<P>Guess what I am saying is that it can be very counterproductive to hold pulls for a lom enchanter.  Its the asap clearing of mobs within the spawn area that maxes your killpower and minimises your risk. <P>That said if an enchanter says lom you didnt see me pulling multiples unless the cleric and tanks were holding very strong  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"><P>On the other side of the equation, like all of us, I have been the victim of pullers who do NOT listen when I say lom, and still pull multiples.  Having died trying to do my job and going oom while the tanks ignored me totally I dont let that happen anymore  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">  <P>You did the right thing 100% if you ask me.  If you arent happy, and people wont listen to you, leave nicely.<P>--------------------<P>Celenaur Celefeanturi<BR>Teir Dal Enchanter<BR>Noctiluca<BR>Erollisi Marr<BR>"We walk where it is darkest.

Thats was nice work!<P>We enchanters need to be High Strung to a point, we have IMHO the Highest stress class in the game. When the S**t hits the fan we are the ones that HAVE to stare it down.  <P>I keep AOE and Latest charm memed 100% of the time.  I am not a big fan of AOE mez, never been but when i need it, I know its there.  Charm on the the otherhand I love, with decent Charisma and EXPERIANCE with charm its our second greatest tool (mez being 1st)  Charm IMHO is meant for groups, sure you can charm solo but i beleive it was designed with groups in mind, just getting the group to work with it is the tricky part.  Just like with AOE mez I usually don't have to use it but its great when i do.  <P>BTW Sonic bats make GREAT pets vs Nox, found that out this morning.<P>Cati Mindweaver<BR>Level "please let it end" 40 Enchanter of Thoxule

Lava Beetles with SLTW make pretty loyal pets too, btw.  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>IMHO AE mez is a very important tool. When it goes unresisted it saves the group quite a bit of damage. For instance, against a 4 mob pull, using Dazzle leaves your group taking an extra 22.5 seconds worth of damage (an extra 7.5 seconds from one mob, and an extra 15 seconds from another mob), and is more mana efficient when you're keeping 3+ mobs mezzed.<P><BR>As for charming on a big pull, admittedly it is risky if you're lom, but if you have plenty of mana it's usually a worthwhile gamble.<P>Arlina

There comes a time when that three pull will kill your tank before you can get them all dazzled... mesmerization is certainly nice then. (of course, we like to hunt way over our head, so i'm talking things like chardok zoneout with six people lvls 46-52.)<P>there is a big difference in playstyles between the intermittent pull people and the constant pull people. reading back over the thread, this dissonance seems to be the real cause of the problem here. It is true that a constantly pulling group is going to get more experience than a pull 3, med up, pull 3, type of group. <P>However, people who aren't expecting constant pulls are often not conserving their mana usage accordingly, and so it's important everyone understand that. first times i was in one of these groups (pulls did not stop for hours at a time even if one or more of us were < 40m) i was stressed out ... these days i prefer to play that way. take a break when someone wants to afk a sec, fine, but while you're on, you're on.  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>--------------------<P>Andrewe<BR>lvl 52 enchanter, Bristlebane

Well I can say it always happens like that for us.  My biggest problem is when mezzes are broke, but it hurts really when someone casts a DoT spell and i can do anything to help but maybe root it.  Applaud, we are a tough class always under the stress of crowd control.  I took the charge of calling all targets cause if u don't they all wind up just breaking mezzes cause the still don't understand /assist.

It's a temporary "mez" and although does cause a lot of hate to start it is not the type of spell where the mob will stick on you for awhile.

Ugh... so that's the problem!  I was in a really good group in Sebilis the other night, but they had one very troublesome habit.<P>We'd usually get 3 at a time and they'd typically finish the first mob before mez wore off.  Ok, so there would be two mobs on hold... I'd tash and slow and debuff one while the group was fighting (to prepare it for them), then walk over to the last one to re-mez it while they're taunting the second one.  I mez the last one and the puller immediately runs over and attacks it instead of the one he was taunting... not only does the last one attack me because of the recent aggro, but now I have to rush to mez the debuffed one before it wakes up.  Besides the difficulty for me, the group is fighting the fast one, and the debuffs are likely to wear off the last one before they get to it.  Besides the mana I wasted and aggro created, the group is now attacking the caster instead of the warrior so I won't get to use ToT again!<P>And it's all because some clever enchanter trained his group to attack what he's pointing at!  Hey... for *this* enchanter, the one I'm pointing at is the one I'm mezzing!

I am going to have to go with Llorian on this one.  If the puller pulls when I tell him not too, he finds himself fighting whatever he brings back.  They are normally expecting this anyways, so it rarely comes as a surprise  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>I will mezz if it becomes necessary but after that combat the clerics will also be finding themselves LOM and asking him to stop pulling  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>It is important that the group mana is balanced, if you find yourself OOM and the cleric is at 80% you start backing off and letting them handle some of the overpull with heals.<P>Often I am responsible for slowing, if I find myself constantly LOM and the cleric is constantly FM, I start getting VERY selective on what I slow  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>The puller often knows what he needs to do to keep the spawn broken properly and will push the edges a bit to ensure that it remains broken.  On the other hand sometimes they are Lemmings  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>I use charm alot for soloing or 2 person groups.  In full groups I'll often have charm up if there are a lot of pets kicking about.  It is surprising how many people cannot handle their pets properly.  My spell line up and tactics are quite different for pet groups and tank groups.<P>All in all I personally think you did quite well.  I would have handled the situation by medding through as Llorian suggested but that is simply personal preference.<P>--------------------<P>Zanithar TideBreaker<BR>55th Beguiler<BR>Cazic Thule<BR>250 JewelCraft

Just explain to the group..you are OOM and don't advise more pulling yet, because you fear people will die. <P>And that if they do pull you will do the smart thing and gate. Usually the mobs will be there 30 secs later when you have another bubble of mana in your bar.<P>I like fast pulls but if it gets unsafe I let them know..I will go down for a group if we get an overpull, but I WON'T go down for a group that overpulls on purpose after I tell them not to. <P>As a 58 enc Gate is a wonderful bartering tool when dealing with a zealous puller. Knowing if he doesn't listen and pulls a hard pull, it will quickly turn into an IMPOSSIBLE pull and he can't gate...<P>I also play a 55 cleric and in that case...I just don't heal the puller until I'm ready to send him out LOL. Ever see a puller run to pull 3 mobs when he is at 30% health? Not often ;-) <P>So if gate hints don't work, send a /tell to the cleric....<P>--------------------<P><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=22139" TARGET=_blank>Citra Brooke-58 ENC</A><BR><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=22147" TARGET=_blank>Pilsburry Doghboy-55 CLR</A><BR><B>Veeshan</B>

Sylphan, that's a funny story. I think a lot of enchanters actually use /point (or hail) to indicate next target, but sometimes not. I can imagine it was pretty frustrating.<P>Typically when I'm with new people i just tell them, 'if i need to call next target for some reason, i will hail it twice' (or something like that). Although I'm starting to call next target more and more often, since our groups are pushing hard enough that it matters whether or not we kill the mob with the oldest mez first.<P>--------------------<P>Andrewe<BR>lvl 52 enchanter, Bristlebane

To be honest my mana is the least important of the group.  If I have 1 bubble of mana I feel fine in terms of pulling, as long as its less than 4.  The only real difference is that if I'm very low all I'm going to do is mez and sit, no slows, no roots, no speed.  And after a few pulls like that the puller will realize it and slow down, or worst case say "speed plz" and I'll say "lom".
