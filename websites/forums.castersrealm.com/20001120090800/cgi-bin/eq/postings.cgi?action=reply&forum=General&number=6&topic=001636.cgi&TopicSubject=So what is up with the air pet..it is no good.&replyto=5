[B]Sorry, 

I meant the lvl 50 plus pet.

Wow, Zebanar, I hear the lvl 59 pet is an SK with a 350 pt harm touch. I personally am going to quit the game if the necros receive a pet much stronger than ours for the price of a peridot. At lvl 59, I can buy Peridots in stacks. 

If Verant totally makes the mage pets once again weaker than the necro pets because a peridot I for one will quit. If necros get the monk pet, I am quitting. 

I am sick of Abashi's and GZ's total bias towards the necro class at the expense of other classes. That wizard pet does sound pretty useless if it gates and casts lvl 20 weak wizard spells. Don't know what they were thinking. I would rather have the super damage sheilded fire pet. It was the only one that really tore up the necro pet, and I believe Abashi and GZ took it away so that won't happen anymore. And just watching the mage spell line, I have to say I feel GZ and Abashi have a personal dislike for the mage class. And do whatever they can to make sure the necro class stays ahead of us and is weaker than them in all areas but DD. Even pets we are not the best anymore it seems. The necros are receiving our one defining ability, pet versatility.[/B][/QUOTE]

Here's my takes.<P><BR>The wizard pet is kinda neat I guess.  It's fun to use simply because it's something new.  As far as effectivness, I'm not sure his spells are making up for the lack of melee damage, but I haven't been using the fire pet for too long, so I don't really know yet.<P>The 53 air pet doesn't suck.  Because it is higher level, it can actually land that stun.  I've played in groups where the only tank is the 53 air pet, and we've done fine.  Cleric cheals about every 2-3rd fight, about the same as when I use an earth elemental.  This is fighting in old sebilis btw.  As far as it being a monk class, there really isn't anything 'visable' to support this.  No flying kick or whatnot.  But, I suppose if verant thinks monks avoid damage and tank very well, then yes, the air pet is a monk.  It seems to have much higher defensive skills and ac than it's level 49 counterpart.<P>The pet I'm going to be a bit worried about is the 54 water pet.  If it is a rogue class and backstabs, then it's probably going to have about 1/2 of the hps of the 49 version, much like the necro pet.  This in my opinion would suck, since water pets have always been used as good damage tanks.  Their immunity to poison also comes in handy for certain mobs.  The other thought being the only time you'd be able to use these things very effectivly would be partnering with a necro, or grouped with a druid/cleric (anyone who can snare/fear really).  I haven't gotten to play with the 54 pet yet, so we'll have to see.  I'm not making any judgements till i've had a week or so to play with new pets  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/wink.gif"><P>------------------<BR>Tarnac Jizmak<BR>53rd Magi<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#DEDFDF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">amneth</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">One of the monk defensive abilties is block. It is unique to the monk. Has the air pet ever blocked. I didn't really expect it to do a flying kick, but I kind of expected it to block as part of its improved defensive skills. And does it seem to strike faster than the old air pet or the earth pet for that matter.<P>And what I am getting at also is the necro pet at 59 takes a peridot to cast. And I am wondering if it is because they are not master summoners, or if they simply are giving the necro a super strong SK pet with a 350 pt harm touch and considering the peridot the penalty. I for one could stacks of 20 peridots easily at that lvl if I received a super strong pet. And that will be pathetic to me if they consider that a balancing factor of the spell. I am only lvl 30 and rising fast, 8 days played, and could buy a stack of 20 peridots right now. </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#F7F7F7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Zeemu</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">It should been nice if Earth pet also could do Critical hits becauase they are based of Warriors.<BR>Anyone know what class the L56 necropet is???

Just because it doesn't block or flying kick or whatever doesn't mean its dual wield and double attack skills are higher than earth, or that its ac isn't substantially higher. <P>Also, nobody has seemingly tested the haste thing out. I mean actually turned on timestamp and seen how often it hits compared to the earth pet. With such logic as <BR>"it doesn't have haste either, or if it has haste it has less HP than the 49 pet" we're not going to find anything out for sure. (How are those 2 things even related?)<P>I haven't gotten the air pet yet, but when I do, I'll post some real data about how quickly he hits vs. the air pets.<P>Sinark, 54th Mage of Karana</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#F7F7F7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Zebanar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Tarnac I've had the 49 and 53 air pets fight.<P>The results where the 53 pet won by about 20-25% each time. This was out of <BR>about 3-4 fights. <P>I'm assuming this is due to three things:<P>53 Air pet stunning the lower level one more than the other way around.<BR>53 Air pet simply being higher level <BR>53 Air pet having a few more Hitpoints.<BR>53 air pet Stun damage? Not sure if it was there, but if it was..that means there is<BR>even smaller differences in Pet HP.  <P><BR>Basically its the 49 pet that's higher level. The hit point adjustment<BR>seems no where as large as it was for the earth elemental. <P>Has anyone tested the 39 vs the 44 pets? or the 44 vs the 49 pets? I realize<BR>a huge "difference" in pets from 44 to 49 is an illusion due to Burnout III. <P>Either way, I was expecting a monk pet. As for the 52 fire casting for damage..<BR>Well, it really depends if you can get its spells to connect enough times. <P>If the spell Force shock hits it will do 180ish damage no matter. It has a resist modifier<BR>of 25. I'm guessing this is akin to adding 25 MR to your opponent. At any rate with a resist<BR>of 65(90? w/ modifier) I was able to resist the spell *ALOT*. <P>It has a casting time of 2.8, this is slightly faster than a non burnedout pet <BR>in one round of combat. The other pets do not hit every time(about 30-75% vs blues).<BR>Furthermore there is no way to adjust there hitting % by alot. <P>With fire I assume with Malosi+Tashina the spell can hit alot.. at least vs blues. <P>I'm guessing the difference between the wizard pet damage and other pets damage isn't that<BR>much. Considering all things such as:<P>Wizard pet:<P>+Debuffs-Malosi+Tash. Increases chances to hit.<BR>+Casts shieldskin on itself.<BR>-No upgrade(to my knowledge) due to Burnout III. <BR>-isn't always chain casting. He does stop in between. <BR>-LOW melee attack. <BR>-Ranged attacks really aren't helpful for a pet since he's always standing on the mob<BR>anyway. <BR>-Gates<P>Melee pet:<P>+Burnout III makes the melee pets probably slightly better in damage dealing. <BR>-no way to adjust % to hit mob. <P>At any rate considering the rumors of this pet gating, the slight chance that it can<BR>do more damage simply isn't worth it. The spell is a nice idea, but that's all. I can't<BR>say I'll use it. <P><BR><P>------------------<BR>Zebanar Medding<BR>Elementalist of the 51st Circle<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#DEDFDF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Prooski Du'Maas</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I like the wind pet for no other reason than I like the wind pet, Its group friendly and tanks LOVE them, and I need tanks so thus wind will always be my favorite pet  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></td></tr></table>
