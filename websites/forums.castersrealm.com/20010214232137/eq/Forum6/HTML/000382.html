</FONT><HR>Well. I just read about our new item. Been in a plane. (yes, its late).<P>Anyway. Here are my thoughts on this item, and how it is useful, and how it could be better.<P>First let me point something out I did not see anyone else mention. Specialize Conjuration. At L50 a caster with 200 int has 2100 mana. I can cast Shock of Swords 10 times, give or take for a bad roll on specialize (I am specialized in Conjuration). That should have cost me 2500 mana. That's a saving of roughly 40 mana per cast. Or 16% less. With that in mind, we are spending roughly 168 mana. Not a huge difference, but worth making a note of.<P>Ok, I frankly agree this should be a 2 charge item. I can never see it as more than that. It becomes too good. Too effecient. With 2 charges. 250 mana, -400 hp, -168 mana. Net= 82 mana, -400 hp. A manastone gives roughly 170 mana for the same amount of hp loss. Of course, since you would summon this item prior to needing it...250 mana for 400 hp is an _excellent_ trade. Can you see why 3 or more charges is ridiculous? 2 charges would also give a wizard or a druid 250/300 mana they need for an evac (realisiticly a L50 of these classes has 50 mana in a sliver of a bubble).<P>So how is this useful in its current incarnation? It's limited. It's a panic button. Will I pass one of these out to everyone in the group? Heck no. Will it make us wanted? I do think it will make us more wanted, not a lot more, but more than now. Greater Healing - 150 mana, 270 hp restored. Again, most casters have 25 mana even when they are "oom."<P>I think the Real problem is that we had our aims set too high. We expected too much. We had our hopes up from what GZ said about it being cooler than a ring of regen (cool, but VERY much out of our domain). I am preparing a letter to GZ, very well written sort. Doing some cost analysis (yeah business classes, hehe). In it I plan on demonstrating how 1 additional charge on this item will make it a viable item, sought after as an added bonus to a group, make us wanted type thing. That it will NOT be unbalancing or exploitable. I think this item is an excellent, very appropraite item. It is right up the alley of a magician as a mana storing device. I just feel it needs a slight modification. You need to look at this from their point of view. Anytime you are swapping hp for mana, it becomes a challenge to insure that it cannot be abused badly. Cleric/manastone/complete heal is a good example. Complete heal, 400 mana. 20 clicks on a manastone, 1200 hps burned to cover the cost of the spell.<P>Ok, the present incarnation is limited and underpowered. Mages have waited 10 months for this spell. And it is not as powerful as we had hoped. It is not a class power spell (teleports, Ice Comet, Ressurect, Summon Corpse, SoW, Stat buffs, regeneration, Mesmerize/clarity), and I think that is what we were all hoping for. We wanted to be special. Unique. Given something that makes others react to a magician asking for a group (Go get that guy/girl! we need a mage for that awesome spell!!). I am not sure what is the thought behind this. I can honestly say if we make a big enough, well thought out, Non flamming (d3wd that n3w sp3]] suxs! Bite me! blah blah blah) arguement, we may be able to get this looked at again. Anyone else just want 5 minutes with GZ alone to talk? Get his insight on this? I can only imagine. This is his baby, he wants all the classes to be well balanced, fun, and have their role. If you dont believe this, grow up. He does not keep any one class down because he plays a necro (where did that come from anyway? He playes EVERY caster class)<P>I've said it before, I'll say it again. I love the mage class. This new spell is a good addition (not great, or a great leg up) and stays in theme with our class. If you don't like our spell list, play a necro and solo your little heart out. The Magician class is designed for groups. We group very well. We bring more to a group than a necro does, and with this new item, a bit more now.<P>If you reply to this message, and I hope you do, reply in a clear intelligent, well thought out manner. Pointing out that if you summon and use it immediately (Completely wrong use of the item) you lose 75 mana is not the sort of reply I want to see. Sorry if I seem bitter on that, but I hate flamming posts as they are a waste of time to read, add nothing to a discussion, and only make people mad.<P>Lilara d'Estra<BR>Level 50 Magician of Prexus<BR>Dark Nova<BR>Team Pet Magician<BR>A mage who WILL buy the spell, and use it as it was intended.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=6&topic=000382.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=General&TopicSubject=Dear+fellow+mages.+The+new+Item.+Positive+feedback+Only.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Wow, incredible post. I do hope you follow though with an e-mail to GZ.  An extra charge would be useful.  Another tweak that would make the spell very useful would be a change to make the effect useable on others. As in a monk using the charge to drain 200 life from himself to give 125 mana to the evacer or healer.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=6&topic=000382.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=General&TopicSubject=Dear+fellow+mages.+The+new+Item.+Positive+feedback+Only.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Well, when you have 100 mana left and your pet is about to die having that rod might be would be great.<P>The problem is that it is useful in so very very few circumstances and it is a level 44 spell.<P>Compare it to the spell list of any other caster class at 44. It is weak weak weak.<P>One other note, I have played a Magician for 47 levels. I will never claim to be a great one but some people I have grouped with have been kind enough on some occasions to say that I am pretty good. When somone makes a statement like "play another class" they lose all credibility with me.

</FONT><HR>Saumerez, I apologize if I was a bit huffy in that post about playing another class, but when I hear all the anger people have over this, it sadens me. Mainly because I love my class. I didn't used to. I went through the "hell" middle levels as a mage, feeling unwanted, and most useless. I then entered the higher tiers of the magicians carreer and fell head over heals in love. As a L47, I would gather you feel the same way. And it becomes that much better at 49! So again, sorry for the tartness.<P>I agree. 1 charge is highly restricted in use. I pray they change this. Or, make this a L34 spell and give us an upgrade at 44? Would be a good way to solve this.<P>I still want to say this again, as I feel it's important. This sort of item is what being a magician is all about! The storage of mana! This is a great idea, although slightly underimplemented. Lets keep positive remarks flowing and I will include them in my email!!!<P>Much love for the Mage community,<BR>Lilara d'Estra<BR>Level 50 magician of prexus<BR>Dark Nova<BR>Pet Lover (except when someone shouts, "Who owns Lober?!?!? He's Soloing an Abhorent!!! Camp!!) <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=6&topic=000382.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=General&TopicSubject=Dear+fellow+mages.+The+new+Item.+Positive+feedback+Only.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Actually, the part that bugged me was the suggestion that a "very well written" letter should be sent.  As if that would never have occurred to the rest of us.  It's possible to be sweet but still be pretty darn rude.<P>As an aside, my character is level 20.  For future reference, what does a level 50 character do for fun?  In an RPG, I like the challenge of advancing, and this game seems to be designed so that you tend to "outgrow" zones.  I would think pingponging between 49 and 50 wouldn't be the same.  <P>Does it become just adventuring when you reach the top?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=6&topic=000382.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=General&TopicSubject=Dear+fellow+mages.+The+new+Item.+Positive+feedback+Only.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>As I posted separately, I can think of some possible 'fixes' for this spell.<P>1. Give it more than just 1 charge. Not sure what a proper number would be but they could even make it require a reagent that cost 10 pp to cast, thus creating yet another money sink.<P>2. Make it NO Drop with unlimited charges. This is the one I would most like to see implemented.<P>3. Leave it with just one charge but make it possible to cast the effect on an NPC. Doing 200 damage to a MOB and sieving away 125 of it's mana might make the item actually useful with just one proc.<P>4. Leave it with just one charge but make it possible to give another PC the mana using your own hps. Not sure about the viability of this option, but it sure sounds nifty.<P>Just my thoughts, but I sure hope it isn't implemented AS IS...  I was quite disappointed.  I was hoping we might get a summoned item with an effect but without charges, much like the Coldstone.  <P>Yaman<BR>Mage and Proud of It!!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=6&topic=000382.cgi&ReplyNum=000005&forum=General&TopicSubject=Dear+fellow+mages.+The+new+Item.+Positive+feedback+Only.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Has it every occurred to you that the disgust people are feeling just might be a result of their love of the class?  I don't have any other characters, have been playing since release, I AM A MAGE, I am not a dewd, I RP every night I play, I love my class and NO I don't think all the classes get the same consideration at Verant (rogues anyone?).  Please argue this point with me!  Parents don’t even treat their own kids same, and your going to argue that it is a coincidence that the necro and ranger “just happen” to be the two most balanced classes in the game?  GZ doesn’t play every caster in the same fashion as you or I would, he hasn’t started from scratch and built their personality and abilities up from scratch.<P>I will not summon one of these as a "panic button".  It will not happen for the same reason I will not summon a waterstone every time I log on.  I am not going to take the time in the off chance that if I fall in the OOT I just happened to have one on me.  It's fluff.  The waterstone actually has more utility than this spell (Kedge)(this statement assumes I will buy the spell, I won't)<P>Without retyping what Saumerez said, this is how I feel, I look at this new "teat on a bull" spell at 44th <BR>level and then look at any other casters book at 44th level and it is WEAK (or GZ's sick joke).  How can you argue differently?  If this is what "being a mage is all about" then how can you argue that the classes get the same consideration?<P>As for making us wanted more...even a little more...I’m trying to imagine some anonymous cleric saying to his group, "grab the mage, he can summon me a teat on a bull".  Yes, this is a bit of sarcasm but don't think you are reaching a tad concerning this summoning making a mage any more desirable in a group?  What Cleric is going to want to carry around 6-8 lbs. worth of worthlessness just on the off chance they might need that extra couple points of mana to save the day?  Secondly, if you are in a group that would regularly employ this device out of necessity than I would say to you -- Leave where you are, you are either in a crappy group or are in to deep.<P>M.A.<BR>(summoner of teats on a bull)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=6&topic=000382.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=General&TopicSubject=Dear+fellow+mages.+The+new+Item.+Positive+feedback+Only.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Good post Lilara, BUT...<P>Anyone who has reached level 44 knows when this spell is useful, only in a rare emergency.  The fact is, if you summon a Rod to keep in your inventory for an emergency, there is more chance of the Rod disappearing when you camp or get dropped then there is that you will actually use it.  Which means another 200 mana down the drain.<P>GZ has stated his primary character is a Necromancer.  I don't claim this effects his judgement, but I do believe that when you look at Necromancer spells (ie. Liche) and then you look at the ONE charge on this item, its a joke.  Multiple charges (your idea of two is great, three would be perfect) would not be unbalancing at all.<P>I always had Specialize Conjuration as my primary from the start and it definetly helps, BUT the mana cost reduction is not enough to offset the cost of this summons/charge by far.<P>I for one am not buying this spell, just because its like all the other staff summons thus far, completely useless.  If GZ does add a charge I would welcome it in my spellbook.  I hope GZ is swayed by your email.  <BR><P>------------------<BR><B>Augusten</B><BR>Gnome Mage Extraordinaire, Veeshan<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=6&topic=000382.cgi&ReplyNum=000008&forum=General&TopicSubject=Dear+fellow+mages.+The+new+Item.+Positive+feedback+Only.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I also am a mage and loving it. Dont want to play any other class either. A couple of things though:<BR>1) Mages where NOT meant to group but we are VERY good to group with. Thats my opinion.<BR>2) Some how we DID get overlooked in various aspects of the game; quest itmes, research, and a unique spell. That is to say that certain areas of play were either undepowered (read: useless), too hard to do or get, or just plain non-existant.<BR>Unfortunately this rod falls negatively into 2 of the 3 catagories. <sigh> Its seems to be underpowered with limited use, and it is a unique spell to mages that no one will really want. Because it is unique (in that you can give the summoned rod to others) Verant will feel that he has addressed this issue and move on leaving us with a unique spell of limited use I fear.<BR>Frankly I was hoping for a ring of chloroplast. You can have the rod. I hope that GZ listens to the request to add a least one more charge to the item.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=6&topic=000382.cgi&ReplyNum=000012&forum=General&TopicSubject=Dear+fellow+mages.+The+new+Item.+Positive+feedback+Only.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

I am hoping by using a forum other than one read by mostly mages this spell will never see's the light of day off of the test server.

</FONT><HR>Ok..  Well, it should be pretty obvious that there is not any messages on the board saying that we actually do seriously "LOVE" this item ('We' meaning those who seriously play the Magician class.)<P>I myself am a magician and I seriously think this could be a cool item.  It DOES fit into the idea of a magician.  Mages conjure supplies; arrows, bandages, throwing daggers, etc, and having to med instead of blast is what I kindof hoped the mage class would be in the fact that we help the group in ways that no one else can.<P>The idea that we can have something that converts health to mana better than a manastone is seriously AWSOME!  But it's totally jackass to only give it one charge.  <P>I suggest maybe 2 to 5 charges.  How would that be any sort of overpowering?  Is there a limit to when you should use it? YES, would people be able to abuse it for 5 minus charges?  No...<P>And if they did want to abuse it and say it did have five charges, how would the mage feel?  Could someone stand to pop them out like candy for money?  Hopefully he's in a group that has an enchanter and bard, or that would seriously take all day.  I myself would limit them and hand them out in exchange for wolf etc.<P>So what about a fight scenario?  Well, for 200 health, I could only use it 3 times, and I'd have 100 health left.  I get hit twice, I'd die before I could spend the mana.  BUT, the point is.  I HAD THE CHOICE. I MADE THAT CHOICE!  It wasn't set in stone for me...<P>We're NOT getting a ring of regineration, because too many classes have healing-type spells already.  Get that out of your minds.<P>I'm off of work now!  YEA!!

</FONT><HR>Yes the idea of "storing mana" fits with the class description. Someone explain to me this:<P>If the stone was simply 125 mana with no negative HP hit, and cost us 200 mana to cast... why would this be a problem? <P>For once, we would have a unique summoning, not a silly shadow of the manastone.  It's lore, its freakin summoned (which means you are guaranteed to lose link within minutes after creation) and it costs alot of mana to make. What would be the problem with this? <P>As it is, no sane mage would buy the spell. It's a joke, and please stop talking about charges, 99 times out of 100 you will LOSE LINK before you use the thing once.  Mages are known to be efficient users of mana, and at level 44 a summoned item better be damned good. Storing mana without the retarded HP hit (which is ONLY there based on the model of the manastone) would at least make it marginally useful. I probably still wouldn't buy the spell, it would be used so infrequently. <P>Dagny<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=6&topic=000382.cgi&ReplyNum=000015&forum=General&TopicSubject=Dear+fellow+mages.+The+new+Item.+Positive+feedback+Only.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Ok.. I love Mages.. <P>Now.. This sounds like an excellent item.  I think it's purpose will really shine as a last stand item (you know.. OOM).<P>We all know that one spell can turn the tide of a battle and this device gives you the chance to do that.  This little device may contain the mana the Wizzie or Druid needs to cast evac.  It may have the mana to cast one last heal, one more nuke on a Mob, one last mez...<P>Heck.. 125 mana will allow me to cast almost every spell up to lvl39 and a bunch more useful ones after.<P>Like most summoned items you usually whip it up before you need it.. not when you need it.. hopefully when it comes time to use this device you will have forgotten how much it costs.<P>So if you use it and don't end up needing the mana... then you have to med a little bit longer.. no big deal.  If you use it and it saves your life.. then the creation of the device will be priceless.<P>From what I've seen so far I'll be asking my friendly mage for one every chance I get.<P>I guess that only time will tell about how useful this is.. and if it's not.. then ask Verant to fix it.<P>Mahar Delusion<BR>Enchanter - Povar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=6&topic=000382.cgi&ReplyNum=000016&forum=General&TopicSubject=Dear+fellow+mages.+The+new+Item.+Positive+feedback+Only.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I think anonymous was very correct about have 2-5 charges in the staff. If you proc the staff three times and you get all the mana, you prolly only have like 100 hp left after that.

</FONT><HR>well, not really a good plan.  Ive tried this before.  There seems to be a particular time at which things on the ground in the zone get  wiped from the system.  I think it might be a half hour long.<P>In other words, if the next floor wipe is at 12:00 and its 11:59, and you put your stuff down, itll be gone in an instant.  Yes, this happened to me.  I put some bandages on the ground.  They vanished right before my eyes after about 10 seconds.  Ive also put things on the ground and they hadnt disappeared for about a half hour.  In other words, its very unpredictable.<P>------------------<BR>Rhion Sligo<BR>Magician of Erudin<P>"If you aren't falling, you aren't learning."<BR>     -me</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=6&topic=000382.cgi&ReplyNum=000021&forum=General&TopicSubject=Dear+fellow+mages.+The+new+Item.+Positive+feedback+Only.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>  This spell just doesnt help much.  I agree that as a summon the casting cost doesn't matter, 200 mana * each party member before entering the dungeon will be forgotten.  Think of this as a mana buff for another caster.  They get 125 mana for the cost of 200hp on them and 200 mana from you.  You can only do this before the battle.  After the battle it would be huge downtime.  If your cleric or wizzie is oom and you have the mana to cast up a bunch of these things, what where you doing in the fight?  ok, lets says you do have the mana, you cast 5 of these things and each is used by the healer.  Now your out 1000 mana, the healer is down 1000 hp and up 625 mana, less the cost of complete healing.  For the experts of mana efficiency, this is terribly inefficient.  The use for this is to hand out 1 to each party member including the tanks as a last resort for healing or evac or the last nuke.  It will rarely be used except in an emergency, and only might save you then.<BR>  I'll buy it and use it, it might save me someday.  But its very weak, inefficient, and not worthy of being a 44th level summon.  Compare this spell to a clarity in usefulness to ourselves ot to others and see what you think comes out on top. What level was clarity?  I'll not be wanted in a group any more because of these things but I might sell a few to the casters of the party that doesn't want me.<BR>  PS, this was carefully designed to reduce its use in twinking newbie casters, a few more charges wouldn't ruin it or its intended use for high levels or make it easy to abuse.  A mana store (+125 mana) or mana release (no hp cost) would be abuseable for twinks and also make this spell worth carrying.  I would like to see either of the latter, rather than the former.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=6&topic=000382.cgi&ReplyNum=000023&forum=General&TopicSubject=Dear+fellow+mages.+The+new+Item.+Positive+feedback+Only.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>  I love to play my Magician, and that is why this spell insults me.  As some have said, it will only be usefull in desperate situation in its current form.  And even then (considering your probably in trouble) you have to have the 200 hp available.<P>  Now, we have said it before but it seems repeating over and over is the only way to get through, we dont want more POWER we want something UNIQUE *AND* USEFULL.  Something akin to say, teleport/evac - clarity - resurrect - etc.  Something that is very usefull and makes us wanted.<P>  Ok now for the spell.  A few ways to make it barely usefull have been proposed but still the only way I can see it becoming something I will use is if we can use it in a way similar to canibalism or the necros lich line (is that the right name?).  Else its going to be something that you cast once upon logging and that you feel all giddy inside if you use it before loging.  (if you always need it, as its been said, your group is full of incompetents or you have a death wish).  And I LOVED the idea about it being gloves, would be a nice change.<P>  Heres a few ideas to add to the list.<P>- Make us pay the 200 hp WHEN we cast the spell.  That would already make it less pathetic when your in danger.  Even with a cleric abusing this would be a long process since someone pays the 200 hp somewhere.  <BR>- The ratios could also be changed.  More charges, less mana per charge. I dunno  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif"><BR>- Making it no drop would prevent cleric abuse.<P>- And as someone else said, why even pay hp.  Why does it have to be the same as a mana stone hey?  Just give me a rod that costs some mana and charges less mana than what it cost that Ill be able to use back in the futur.  Come to think of it make this the MAIN idea of my post.  Make this rod and item I can use to store mana for futur use.  DONT make it lore OR make it more costly for more mana (I prefer the latter).  Still giving less mana than its cost.  Make it cost 500 mana for 400 charge for all I care  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif">.  Make it into a line of maybe 2 -3 of those that do the same but some lower level and giving less mana.  Idealy make them give the same mana you paid.  No HP loss.  What it would do is give us the ability to have more 'bubbles of mana' available, if you prepared.  Using this you could have 8 bubbles in effect instead of 5. Its just an idea that came to me, I wonder how it would do live in the game.  Could we solo more with it? .. Probably but Im not sure.  We could sure kite a VERY big mob (if your ready to summon your 500 mana rest for 5 minutes spell.  Now wouldnt THAT make us unique?  I wonder.<P>  In its current form (the semantics assume GZ will change it, which I honestly doubt since he seems to think its Ok and we all know how hard it is to change his mind) I will still buy the spell.  But not because Ill use it.  Because I buy ALL my spells.
