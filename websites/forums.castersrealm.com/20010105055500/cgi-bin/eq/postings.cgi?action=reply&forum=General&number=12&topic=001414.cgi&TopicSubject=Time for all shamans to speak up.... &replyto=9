<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Dwilgar:
[B]Why do you keep saying that Forlorn Deeds is almost as good as Turgur's?

Turgur's is 6 levels sooner: 51 vs. 57

Turgur's is 8% more slowdown at max: 75% vs. 67%

Turgur's lasts longer: 6+ mins vs 2 mins.

Turgur's casts fasters: 3 sec vs 6 sec

Turgur's is only 25 more mana.

Explain to me again how Forlorn is even close to an equivalent spell?  Turgur's  is better any way you choose to measure it.

Other classes have done it, we can too ... it takes UNBELIEVABLE amounts of screaming and complaining but eventually it will pay off. I am sadened to say that us shamans have to resort to such tactics but since Verant is not smart enough to realize the error of their ways , we have to do it the hard way.<P>SHAMANS unite.... lets get our power back!!! Don't just roll over and accept this cruel joke that Verant is playing on us.... petition, shout , post to every EQ related board, get petitions out..... form sit-outs on your servers, refuse to sow and heal (maybe too extreme, use your judgement)... do whatever it takes ( low tactics for sure, but there is no other way). <P>We the players have the power.... after all we are what's keeping EQ alive, there is  a great strength in numbers.<P>- Angry Shammy</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#F7F7F7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kudzu</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Just quit playing, if you aren't happy with a game, just quit playing. <P>Would you eat at a restraunt where they serve rotten food every time you eat there?

And saying that shaman isn't a pet-class won't do, the pet is an integral part of what high level shamans are about.

It's hands down the most powerful race/class combo in the game.  The iksar natural regen + dark pact line of spells make for constant clarity.  Hell, my Iksar gains hitpoints with the level 20 allure of death spell on when sitting down.

Well, they are for evil shamans on my server (Tallon Zek) since we play racewar without crossteaming so there is no competition from druids and paladins, but anyway. A spell doesn't stop being good just because others get it. Of course, it does significantly affect the role of the shaman in a group, but I was just talking about the spells themselves.<P>I think Bane of Nife is fine, for the simply reason that it stacks with Ebolt. In just two castings you can have 2800 points of fast DoTs on the target - and the necros can take care of the Ebolt part. BoN should be more efficient though, I can agree.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#DEDFDF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Mithranndir</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Yeah I hate to say it becasue I really love(d) my shaman but the more I think about it I can't see much point in going on and on and on for little or no reward of ability or usefulness/effeciency above what I can do now with my shaman.

All those new nifty spears, for one, and tons of Shaman-specific stuff in the expansion.  Those Druids sure complain about all our cool weapons too.  Weapons that proc Scourge and decent DD.  Sure, they get some of them too, but most of the time they are not in a position to use them like we are.   <P>Togors/Turgur's is insanely powerful.  Sure, go play your Necro, and I'll play mine too when I have the time.  But Shaman style of solo combat IMO is much more my style, and I like when mobs swing feebly at me every 5 or 6 seconds while DoTs, pet, and I smash them.<P>Necros, when played right, are very powerful.  Shaman, when played right, are very powerful.  I'm talking about the solo game only, of course.  The only things that make a Necro more flexible and powerful in solo combat are Feign Death and Harmshield.  Otherwise, they'd be fighting scared the entire time.  Me, I can take hits from that mob and smile.  <P>Now, I'll grant you, our group buffs do suck.  In fact, we really don't have that much to bring to a group, other than Turgur's.  Our pet could be a LITTLE bit better, but our pet is basically a taunting HP-sack for solo'ing, not a main weapon in our arsenal.  <P>I would have liked to have seen Group Chloro/Regrowth, Group SoW, and a Group Talisman (that does NOT overwrite mage shields).  I would like to have seen an area effect Malosi to differentiate our abilities from the Magician's in this line of spells.  <P>And finally, this Avatar spell is pretty much ****e.  Give me a Str/Attack/Regen spell like Rage or Fury to stick on those tanks.  Make it last 1 minute, 200-300 mana, and cast time of 2 seconds (no recast time), similar to Burst of Strength.  <P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#F7F7F7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Skaar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dwilgar, sorry to say it, but I think you are reaching for something to like, something that is unique to shamans, in the post Kunark world.<P>75% vs 67% slowdown? Significant? You'd have to examine log files pretty close to even see a difference. 6+ mins vs 2 mins? OK, that's nice... for kiting I guess. I never kite so 6+ minutes is useless to me. It's a rare fight that lasts long enough for Plague to be worth casting, so 2 minutes seems ample on a melee slow down. Meleeing for over 2 minutes is a pretty bad idea at level 50+ anyway, even with attack slow downs.<BR>3 sec vs 6 sec casting time? Turgur's is only 25 more mana? None of this seems like a dramatic difference to me, especially considering that the lower level spell will oevr write the higher level one anyway. Take into account the fact that Enchanters can mez, charm, clarity, haste, debuff, etc.... Who will choose a shaman just for a 7% increase in attack slow downs? Nobody. And you know it, I suspect. Therfe are so many places now people say "you can't really do that area without an enchanter". WHo says that about shamans?<P>Dotty, you have chosen to say the "supplements" we got to our spell lines make up for the general lack of meaningful "enhancements". That's fine - for you. It's not fine for me. I have never been satisfied being invited into a group because they couldn't find a cleric. I want to have something valuable and unique I can add to a group. In the post-50 world, I don't. It's just that simple. Other classes have had to deal with this problem before. I just didn't expect it to happen to shamans. I don't understand why they crippled one of the only "balanced" classes in the game. I just don't.<P>And no, I will not start a new character. I don't like where verant has gone with Everquest. It's apparrent to me now that powerlevelling and collecting loot are all that there ever will be to do in this game. And that's just not very much fun anymore, especially when I am not looking forward to any of the new spells. <P>I have only logged into my server twice this week, and both times for less than 2 hours. That's WAY down from my normal playtime. I suspect it will not be long before I stop logging in at all. From what I can see, a lot of people have already stopped playing. I think Verant needs to examine server loads relative to a month ago instead of subscription rates if they want to see what the future holds for EQ. I suspect most people will keep their accounts active for some time after they stop playing. Just prior to Kunark shipping my server was averaging 2000 people during prime time. It's under 1500 now at the same times. My bet is a lot of those 1500 are playing twinks too, based on how empty the high level Kunark zones are. What happens when they decide they bored with their new characters too. <P>Verant, pull your head out. It may not be too late.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#DEDFDF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dwilgar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">8% greater slowdown is a huge effect when mobs are double hitting for 120+.<P>6 min duration is a great effect when you have multiple mobs to slow and it takes more than a minute to kill each one.<P>Fast casting time is great when a mob is beating your ass down and you have to slow it.<P>Getting the spell 6 levels soon is HUGE since I don't see many level 57 enchanters running around.  I see tons of level 51 and higher shaman.  Turgur's utterly destroys the second best enchanter slowdown spell (Shiftless Deeds).<P>Pound for pound Turgur's kicks ass -- end of story.<P>As regards picking a shaman over an enchanter, or vise versa, I was, and am, making no judgements on that situation.  The sole purpose of my comment was to point out that Turgur's is a much better spell than Forlorn Deeds, dispite continued statements of the opposite.<P>------------------<BR>Dwilgar<BR>High Shamaness of Oggok<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></td></tr></table>
