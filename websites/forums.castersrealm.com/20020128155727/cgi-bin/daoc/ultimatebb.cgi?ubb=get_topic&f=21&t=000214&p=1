A few questions were asked of us, most soecifically we were asked if any spell line was seen as deficient. I am posting a copy of my report here since this actually has a much wider impact than just items on Test.<P>Focus is being turned on spells. This is a quick breakdown of the spells as is, and a basic description of what they do.<P>Sorceror Spells<P>Base Matter (Core Matters)<BR>Ward Blow (AF Buff) +Single Blade-Turn :Just a basic defensive Buff, and included in this line is one blade turning spell at level 19.<BR>Acid/Corrosive DOT: This is a 4 tick DOT that lasts 24 seconds.<P>Advanced Matter (Telekinesis)<BR>Forces DOT: This is a DOT that lasts 24 seconds and does damage 6 times (once every 4 seconds)<BR>Dex  Debuff: This drains the targets dexterity. The effect is minimal most times.<P>Base Body (Body Destruction)<BR>Life Drain/Consumption: Basic life transfer. Costs more power and is less efficient than straight direct damage spells.<BR>Strength  Debuff: Lowers the targets strength. Can sometimes see a noticable drop in damage done by the MOB.<BR>Snare/Root: Slows the target to 1%, then they slowly move faster after the fact. Damage breaks this instantly.<P>Advanced Body (Disorientation)<BR>Direct Damage: More efficient than the life drains as far as power spent and damage done.<BR>Dexterity/Quickness Debuff: Drains both stats from the target. The effect again is not readily apparent many times.<BR>Area Effect Root/Snare: Nice upgrade to the base snare, but this one has a small area of effect.<P>Base Mind (Mind Twisting)<BR>Confusion: Target will attack random enemies, and sometimes even allies. Only works on NPCs so limited RvR use.<BR>Mesmerize: Immobilizes the target completely. Can not be cast on a target after it takes a small amount of damage.<BR>Run Speed Buff: Movement rate of all in your group is increased, but does not work on our pets.<BR>Amnesia: Wipes the targets agro list. They do NOT however forget you, so they come immediately for you after you cast this. Useless for PvP, but the casting itself does qualify as a spell cast to interrupt the target.<P>Advanced Mind (Domination)<BR>Charm: Can get up to even level pets if the spell is kept current. Some levels, and many areas, are severely lacking in Charmable MOBs. Though it says humanoids are the target, many MANY creatures are technically humanoid and can not be charmed.<BR>AE Mesmerize: Upgrade to the base Mez, with a decent area effect added.<BR>Strength and Constitution Debuff: The most noticeable and potent debuff in our arsenal. Since many Sorcerors spec MIND high, this stays effective longer than the other debuffs, and helps when hunting with your pet to keep them from taking too much damage.<P>Now on to the analysis.:<P>Areas for improvement to what exists.<P>Just focusing on what IS in place and how it could be improved.<P>First the run spell needs to work on the pet. This has been broken for far too long. Maybe making it a single target spell with a 10 minute duration would better for this. It would also allow it to get away from being a song, which is totally out of place.<P>Next would be our charms. Plain and simple, we need to be able to charm more targets. Many elemental types cannot be charmed. Nor can smaller giant types (Ogres and Ettins). Seems if ANY other classification could be applied, it takes precedence and makes the MOB no longer humanoid. If it has arms and legs, and can speak a spoken language, we should be able to charm it.<P>Clarify how amnesia should work, and if it is not working as intended fix it. Right now all agro is wiped, but the list is not cleared and the MOB still comes straight for you. If they are supposed to forget their entire list, lets get it fixed.<P>The debuffs need to have more tangible effect. Maybe instead of increasing how much they debuff, a secondary effect could be added to them for substance. <P>And lastly the blade turn. Very nice addition to casters, and very needed. But sorcerors seem to have lower hit points than many other casters. We are far less survivable than the casters in Hibernia who can wear armor. And the other casters who fulfill our role get heavier armor or healing, and in at least one case both. So perhaps our blade turn should be a Karmic Repurcussion. Half the damage that would have been done to us could be reflected back at the attacker.<P><BR>Areas for addition to what exists.<P>Ok, now plenty of new twists on our spells could help immensely in PvP. But the one area that just screams for attention is the Matter line. As it stands there are 2 basic spells in the base line (lumping the single blade turn spell with the other AF buffs as a defensive spell). There is the defensive line, and the basic DOT. The advanced spec of matter adds a new DOT (which adds nothing on top of the original, but replaces it) and a Snare spell…which the DOTs themselves nullify.<P>So the only way to make your advanced DOT worth using is to spec very heavily in matter. This makes you then use the advanced DOT instead of the basic, rendering these lines basically the same. You cast one or the other depending on levels, so it is in effect one spell based on the matter skill. Topping that off, once you HAVE opted to use the higher DOT, and focused your training on Matter, now the second benefit, the Snare/Root spell, is nullified when you use the other primary spell in the line, the DOT.<P>There needs to be more here.<P>Of all the areas that seem to be neglected, Matter is by far the least chosen spec path. Not that many choose body either. Our Mind spec is strong, and really defines the class. Body adds a DD and a nice single target root, so is quite capable for solo play. Matter is the one line that fails.<P>Suggestions:<P>As mentioned earlier, maybe a spell that reflects the damage taken back upon the attacker. This could be combined with a blade turn type buff, or become it’s own buff layered on top of the others. <P>Perhaps following the idea of telekinesis, a force based spell to push targets back would be effective. Maybe a physical wall of force, or a bubble shield effect.<P>A levitation spell would be EXCELLENT in this line, and could alleviate all that horrible falling damage. If this is a group spell it would allow us to aid a group in crossing moats and other waterways quickly for PvP. This would be a great addition to battlefield strategy.<P>There are many more suggestions to be made, and many more good ideas out there. But the matter line is definitely in need of SOME sort of attention. A few key things to keep in mind, do NOT add things to the advanced path that would nullify the use of one in the basic path. There are already 2 DOTs and a Snare/Root that basically equate to ONE spell you can cast at a given time. You must ensure that the higher spec spell can complement the character, and actually add some functionality. Improving on how well a particular effect works should be left a matter of level.<P>The general community if furious at this point. The frustration level is high. Sorcerors were fairly rare to begin with, not that many groups can not rely on their Mez to be quite as effective in groups, they are getting less group invites. Not only have we always been weak in PvP (relatively) we now may have less Sorcerors actually making it to high enough level to even consider PvP. Many choose the sorcerer with the idea that we will be the best in crowd control and that is our niche. As sweeping changes are made to class abilities as a whole, it is becoming apparent that we are NOT necessarily the best at Crowd Control, and these changes actually do not address the initial imbalances they were intended for, but only weaken the other classes grouped into the category affected by the change.<P>If by beefing up the matter line you could add more group and PvP functionality, it could go a long way toward bringing the sorcerer back up to the standards everyone has come to expect from the class.<P>--------------------<P>i3ullseye<BR>"You're good, but me?

i3ullseye,<P><BR>To start with I want to say that I&#8217;m sorely disappointed in the message you sent to Mythic.  You know what the Sorcerer community wants; yet you ignored us and squandered a golden opportunity to have our opinions heard so that you could peruse your own agenda.  I know that it is not required of you, but it would have been extremely nice if you had consulted us before hand.<P>What the Sorcerer Community really wants:<P><B>Crowd Control</B><P>We need to be able to effectively crowd control in a large group situations (so that means high red, low purple, and the occasional purple).  We need to be able to do this reliably, not the Mez and pray routine we currently have to endure.  If we can&#8217;t crowd control reliably, groups will not trust us to crowd control at all. Before anyone thinks any of these suggestions are overpowered, kindly refer to the Midguard Healer&#8217;s spell list!<P><I>Crowd Control Suggestions</I><UL TYPE=SQUARE><LI>Reduced Mez resistance.<BR><LI>Remove the variable duration nonsense, interrupts, diminishing returns and resists are enough to contend with.<BR><LI>Faster casting on Mez spells across the board.  That Mez does me no good if by the time I cast it the Mob is already beating on the cleric.<BR><LI>Increased Mez range.<BR><LI>Instant cast Mez spells on timers for emergencies.<BR><LI>Point Blank AE Stuns (that do NOT break Mez).<BR></UL><P><B>Group Desirability</B><P>We need to be able to bring something to a group even in situations where crowd control in not required.<P><I>Group Desirability Suggestions</I><UL TYPE=SQUARE><LI>Concentration based Endurance Regeneration bufs.<BR><LI>Concentration based Power Regeneration bufs.<BR><LI>Concentration based Agro multiplier bufs.<BR><LI>Concentration based Agro reduction bufs.<BR></UL><P><B>Realm Vs Realm</B><P>Currently in RvR the Sorcerer is merely a good source of RP&#8217;s for the opposing realms.

I am sorry but I totally agree with Ravn.<P> Where do you get your info from i3ullseye? <P> I have yet to see ANYONE complain about matter line of spells or even Body spells. 99% of ALL complaints have been with Mind spells.<P> I do not know who you seem to be helping with some of the suggestions above but its not the MAJORITY or Sorcerer's  <IMG SRC="frown.gif" border="0"> <P> I do suggest YOU as the leader of the Sorcerer class take the time to actually Level a sorcerer past 30 and see what all the fuss is about.

Several things I have noticed.<BR>1.  DD spell has shorter distance than others.  Debuff, step forward and cast dd.<P>2.  As far as pet keeping up, Don't make it another spell to cast.  Last night I was in a group with two sorcerers and his spell worked on my pet and mine on his.  Change it so the pet is affected by our amplify spell.<P>3.  Bladeturn:  If damage is reflected back to mob, would that make it so the pet couldn't get mob off you without casting the amnesia spell.  (Blindside)<P>4.  Agree wholeheartedly that we need to be able to charm more creatures.<P>5.  I am Mind and Body.  If changes were made to make Matter better, would they be to base or specialization.  Out of luck at this point if specialization.

Um, I was given a specific question. That question was which one spell line seems to need more substance? Which line does not seem as full as the others?<P>Matter is by FAR the least utilised, and it IS stated as such on Pendragon. Both the mage classes find Matter underwhelming. I answered the question given, sheesh. I added as much extraneous info about other broken items as I thought i could get away with, but that was NOT the point of the report.<P>In the quick summary of spells I pointed out that certain spells are useless in PvP. I added that if matter could be added to in a way to increase gorup freindliness, AND help PvP, we would be better off. Is this NOT 2 of the very points you asked for even in this thread here?<P>So I ask the question to all of you then.<P><B>Which one of our spell lines would be seen as incomplete or lacking?</B><P>Now after reading that you tell me if my report is very far off the mark.<P>--------------------<P>i3ullseye<BR>"You're good, but me?

Now read my very last comments:<P>   <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><HR><BR>The general community if furious at this point. The frustration level is high. Sorcerors were fairly rare to begin with, not that many groups can not rely on their Mez to be quite as effective in groups, they are getting less group invites. Not only have we always been weak in PvP (relatively) we now may have less Sorcerors actually making it to high enough level to even consider PvP. Many choose the sorcerer with the idea that we will be the best in crowd control and that is our niche. As sweeping changes are made to class abilities as a whole, it is becoming apparent that we are NOT necessarily the best at Crowd Control, and these changes actually do not address the initial imbalances they were intended for, but only weaken the other classes grouped into the category affected by the change. <BR>If by beefing up the matter line you could add more group and PvP functionality, it could go a long way toward bringing the sorcerer back up to the standards everyone has come to expect from the class.<BR>  <HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Now what the hell were you reading? Basically I think I should thank you for lengthening out the statements I made in my closing paragraph for me. <P>And as far as the speed song (it pulses and actually lists as a song, not a spell) I am suggesting they try to make it a single target item so it may overcome its brokenness. I think that our pet starting as an enemy is part of the coding problem with it, and making it castable ON a target could overcome this. This would also allow us to buff someone not in our group, and for others to NOT have to stay within spell range of us.<P>I have detailed these suggestions out time and again on the Pendragon boards, and this report is meant for there. So the ideas and the underlying information is generally known and acknowledged. I am sorry if I did not break that down completely, but that report was written for the Pendragon forums, not for here. I only posted it here out of courtesy.<P>And that wasn’t even the question asked. I merely put that in there to keep reminding them that the spell is broken. <P>Man, tough room here….

Hmmm I too am more inclined to agree with Ravn. Tho i3ullseye, I have to say your suggestions have been very helpful to my playing a sorc so far  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">  Some of your suggested changes are necessary, but not sufficient. <P>1.  Matter spec.  I agree this needs to be fixed...BUT this will only help relatively NEW sorcs, not those of us who have already put most of our points into mind and body.  Laudable to create a new line of characters with some ability in matter, but we who have already placed our points need survivability too.  I'm not going to go back and re-level another sorc to 36...I'll quit first.  <P>2.  If indeed we are supposed to be masters of crowd control, I for one would really like to actually be able to DO that.  As it stands in RVR the stun is way more useful than the mez for doing that.  Stun is faster to cast, it can be cast on ppl with low health, it cannot be healed and you can inflict additional damage and not break the stun.  Only disadvantage to stun is duration is less.  Well in the rvr battles I've been in once I'm stunned, I'm dead...so shorter duration seems not to matter much.  Crowd control in rvr currently belongs to the stunners.  <P>Suggestions:  First...make stun healable! Stun implies a shock to the system and mez does not...so also make mez NOT healable.  Secondly...concentration spells should be broken by mez AND stun...shouldn't be able to concentrate after either has been done to you.  3rd make mez range equal to that of bolt casters...ya damage is their forte so they should have good range...but mezzing is ours and we deserve the same consideration.  REMEMBER mez alone does very little...if I'm alone and mez someone orange and above, my choice is usually to just run...that's not true for a wizzie who can finish someone off with two bolt spells.  Yet the wizzie gets realm points and I get nothing for using my spec'ed ability.  Pets in rvr are hard to find and often lower level...plus when you die as often as we do in rvr, it's REALLY hard to hold on to one for any length of time...so we really can't count on them for aid.  Plus, unlike pve we have no way to keep aggro on them, we can't even use our tanks to shield us...once we are targeted by an archer, we are pretty much dead, even WITH bladeturn.  <P>So if you think mez changes are unbalancing, consider that an archer can kill a sorc usually in 2 shots, maybe 3 at outside, and since their range is so long and they have stealth, there is really nothing the sorc can do about it.  When they do that, the archer gets realm points.  BUT as a sorc, there is NOTHING I'm able to return the favor to.  So if the perceived problem with mez is that other players will get frustrated because they have to wait for up to a minute to play again, consider the sorc who is killed without opportunity to respond almost all the time, and has to either get rez and recover (longer than one minute I assure you) or release and head back to from the bindstone(sometimes up to 15 minutes to get back in the action).  If one minute mez is frustrating, I ASSURE you 15 is more so.  <P>Giving longer range on mez would at least give us a ghost of a chance of surviving an archer snipe...tho I don't think I'd still survive it very often because of difficulty in targeting the archer.  Still, if it were an option I'd consider it more fair.  As it is, I'm a sitting duck for archers or anyone with greater range.  <P>I'm also a sitting duck for stun because I can start casting my mez, and after I do it, a stunner still has time to run in close start casting, get his stun off and interrupt my mez...so much for crowd control.  Ya, maybe i can use quickcast, and I do as often as possible...but resists are getting pretty common, and on a purple now, the mez can be gone before I even get my quickcast back, assuming it's not resisted.  <P>I can't emphasize enuff that unlike stun, mez is NOT instant death for the mezzed. A tank gets ONE HIT on a mezzed character before he can defend himself...NOT true for stun, I've taken 4 and 5 hits while stunned without being able to respond.  Sorcs will still have a hard time killing rvr folk even if the mez takes, plus since a whisper cancels and it can't be cast on things that have taken appreciable damage, at the current point in time if you wanna do crowd control I'd suggest a character with stun.  <P>Finally, a disguise option would be an EXCELLENT addition to the sorc mind spec line for rvr...kudos on that suggestion.  Let us target a mob or player an cast the spell to take on that character's  or appearance for 15 minutes or so.  Idea works very well for making the sorc a much more desirable rvr class since right now we are simply sitting ducks.  I REALLY like this suggestion, and it's not as powerful as stealth, but gives us SOME options.  <P>Finally, I think charm should also affect players just like it affects mobs.  There's no logical reason it shouldn't.  We already lose amnesia in rvr and most of the usefulness of confusion.  Here's what I think charming players adds:<P>First of all charming a character in rvr would be rare, given the requirements that already exist for charm.  Second, if we could get the charm off, we'd be able to take a hostage...which I think would add immensely to rvr tactics.  What I would do to prevent the complaints about a sorc taking control of someone's character for hours on end is introduce a suicide command so that the charmed player can suicide and die at any time while charmed.  This is less nasty than archers currently have it against sorcs, since they can send sorcs to the bindstone almost automatically without giving the sorc a choice.  That way, the sorc can actually send the player against his friends in a battle...and the player would have the choice...hope that the sorc bites it before he does appreciable damage to his friends, OR suicide to prevent doing that damage.  I think this addition alone would make the sorc a way more popular character without unbalancing anything too much just because the effect is so cool.  Remember, charms in rvr would be a bear to get off, would only apply to players your level or under, and sending against a mob to kill the player should also result in no loss of con or xp...with the message "you have recently been charmed, you lose no xp or con"...the same fix that prevents you from getting xp for killing a recently charmed critter. <P>Tequitus (36 sorc)

Few things...<P>The question asked has no bearin on new or old sorcerors, it was merely which line needed more meat added to it.<P>It was NOT which ones needed fixed.<P>It was NOT what would sorcerors like to see added to the class.<P>A disguise type spell will likely never happen. I woudln't mind seeing it, but the rogues have precious few unique abilities as is. the only other types that will get shifting will be Berserkers becoming animals and such. Only the rogue types will have true disguise or stealth. I don't think we will ever see spells that can duplicate this and move in on their territory.<P><BR>And I also see us NEVER getting charm that works on other PCs. I would love to see it, but it just isn't likely to happen. Just being stunned and helpless is frustrating enough, what kind of outcry would there be if we could take total control of the target. Now they have to actually watch as we use them to fight. If we don;t get them killed, then what? They stay transfixed, staring at their monitors while we have total control of their game?<P>Charm woudl also be a one shot kill. This one spell would take them ENTIRELY out of the combat. <P>Just not gonna happen....<P>--------------------<P>i3ullseye<BR>"You're good, but me?

I think the best way would be somewhere between Ravn and i3bullseye.  Even though Ravn has some great suggestions, if all of Ravn's suggestions were taken, we would be far too powerful.  Also those changes would take far too much programming and Mythic wont be doing that any time soon.  I can see that i3bullseye is striving towards balance but sometimes goes to far in weakening the class.  My view can be summed up in four changes in this order and number one should be addressed immediately:<P>1) Fix mez for PvE and PvP and make CC effective and reliable.<BR>2) Sorcers need a use when CC is not needed<BR>3) Fix matter line<BR>4) Fix charm<P>The first priority should go to Mind and CC because that is the largest benifit that we bring to a party.  We should be compared to a Healer because they are much more powerful than us.  A group with a Healer will always win against a group with a Sorcerer because they have faster casting times and insta casts and two crowd control lines, both mez and stun compared to our one.  Also Healers get clarity so can cast their spells with almost no mana cost.  Healers are also much more sturdy and can tank so can get much closer and can cast without having to worry about collapsing like a fragile sorcerer.  Not only that but when diminishing return runs out, a Healer can still stun or fall back into a tank or cleric position while a Sorcerer simply has to run away.  In RvR, the Sorcerer should be balanced against the Healer, our Midguard equivelant.  Sorcerer should have faster or equivelant cast to Healer and should have more powerful CC, after all we are a pure caster and sacrifice armor, absorbtion, hp and any melee ability.<P>Sorcerers are suppose to be the CC class and we need to be able to do CC effectively and reliably in a group.  When we fail, it causes our death and other group deaths and we are a failure in the eyes of the group.  We need a way to recover if we get a resist.  Maybe Mez resist should not cause monsters to aggro to us immediately.  Maybe when they wake from mez they should not b-line straight towards us.  Maybe sorcerers should have a unnotice self buff which causes monsters to not notice them (so they are never aggroed to us unless the monsters make a difficult skill check).  Maybe we need a stun line.  Lastly, two sorcerers in a group should be able to work together.  As it is now, two sorcerers can easily step on each others toes and render mez shortlasting or useless.  A mezhappy cleric can do the same thing.  Mez should not be so dangerous and Sorcerer should not have to die 10 times more often then other group members.<P>Sadly, theurgist are now better CC than us and Cabalists, Wizards and Smite Clerics are catching up to us in CC ability.  My cleric is starting to hear "We need a theurgist to handle the adds" in groups now.  Two theurgists in a group are infinitely more effective at CC than two sorcerers and a theurgist can always take away crowd controling from a sorcerer because pets break mez.<P>Second priority is to give sorcerers a use when mez is not necessary or is used up.  I think that the easiest way for this is to make the debuffs effective.  I have done testing and casting DD is always more effective than debuff.  DD's shorten the fight more causing the tanks to take less damage and does more damage on the monster.  It doesn't matter how big the group is wether you are soloing in a group of 2-3 or in a 8 person group.  I have tried against blues to purples.  I have tested debuffs in all those cases and they are always inferior to chain casting DD's.  We always end up taking less damage and killing the monster faster when using straight DD's, but our DD's are not even very good.  When fighting places where CC is not required, Sorcerers need to be able to still contribute to a group.<P>The Matter line needs improvement and anyone that does not admit this does not have any points in Matter.  Don't be selfish, think of the gimped Matter sorcerers for once, they need some help.  Improving the matter line should be third priority.<P>Fourth priority should be fixing charm so we can charm more pets and fixing our runspeed buff so that our pet does not lag behind, cause aggro and get us and our group killed.  This would help alleviate the pet shortage at some levels and would be an additional CC tool.<P>Lastly, I have heard reports that mid purple's hits cancel bladeturn, so bladeturn is useless in a group fighting mid-purples.  If this is true, maybe it needs to be examined.  What level of purples hit through it?  Does this get worse or better as level increases?  Do we need more powerful bladeturns at higher levels to negate this?<P>Thanks i3bullseye, you are doing a great job straightening out our class.  I might not agree with all your decisions, but it is great that we have someone examining the class that cares about it and who has the complete picture in mind and is trying to evolve the class in a way that we don't get too powerful and then nerfed again somewhere down the line.

Bullseye, you are doing a great service to sorcerers.  I have adopted some of the techniques you have put forth in this forum.  It's human nature to see things from your on point of view without worrying about the why another person responded the way they did.  You did your job and answered the question presented to you.  You also know better than any of us what Mythic may respond positively to.  Hey man, I just get lonely out here.  People don't actively pursue a sorcerer for a group.  Once I get in groups, they tend to appreciate my mez skills.  Would love to be as needed as a healer.<BR>Thanks for your support and don't get too ticked.  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">

Heh I agree charming in rvr will likely never happen, but I can dream right?  I don't think it's overpowered if you accompany it with a suicide command...certainly no worse from my view than getting two shotted by an archer and having to kiss the bindstone, taking up 15 minutes of my playtime getting back to the fight, but I can see that the whining about charm would be pretty loud, tho I'm not convinced that whining alone should matter, or even does matter, given that my pet still lags behind me, and I'd never seen ANYONE bitching about sorc's mez lasting too long on purples.  Stuns, yes, mez no.   <P>As for encroaching on scout classes with disguise, ya might also never happen, but disguise would be significantly less effective in rvr than stealth is...I still can't target most ppl stealthed, and that means instadeath for me...disguise would not be so severe since targeting wouldn't be compromised and you give yourself away the second you start casting a spell.  <P>BUT if encroaching on someone's specialty is a problem, then we need to address the ability of SEVERAL other classes who seem to be better at crowd control than we sorcs are...stun being a prime example.  Clerics and healers already have it pretty good, do they really need to encroach on OUR domain...the one thing really that makes us useful?  Cleric without stun would STILL be in way higher demand for groups than sorcs are (for reasons given in the above post).  Anyway, if Mythic uses that as an excuse NOT to give us diguise, then they have a bit of fixing to do on other classes to keep from encroaching on the main thing that makes sorcs even slightly useful in a group. <P>Heh, anyway keep pluggin away for us i3bullseye, you've done a good job so far  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">

Would they be nice? Yes. Are they needed? No. We are not Wizards that need long range nukes. We are not Midgard Healers and need the Dazzle line ( AoE stun from EQ). I dont need insta cast Mez nor faster casting times. Ever hear of the quickcast feature? How much range do you need in a dungeon? <P>This is how I do it. Puller calls 3 inc, I target the rear mob and cast AoE mez. I then proceed to back up a bit and wait for the tell tell signs that Mez is about to break ( you kow the ones where the mob acts like he is non aggro and stands up straight). Then either cast Mez or an AoE again. I cant tell you how many times people that have never played with a sorcerer before start to love me. As long as everyone pays attention to me calling out next target ( dont most sorcerers do that?), then all is good.<P>This is especially nice now that we have bladeturn spell.

Stops and Inturrupts ALL forms of combat. Archers fumble with thier bows, casters cant cast that spell they were trying to get off. And the spell is cheap and fast casting.<P>No Illusions, this is not EQ. <P>Only valis point I see is maybe RP's for debuffs and Mezzes as that can turn the tide of a battle.

As far as our speed spell, why should we take a step back just to make a coders job easier for pets? If it was to be a Single target spell the duration would definately need to be bumped up ALOT. Say 15-20 mins as a suggestion.<P> If the Devs will not work with our suggestions of Mez's (which seems the way lately) maybe allow us to use half our other spells in RvR. <BR> Now I am not saying let charm work on PC's. Maybe let us be able to have a wider/longer range on our DoT's. Or maybe give us an AE confuse spell (with a longer range) that would interupt all spell's/atks (except heals)<BR> <BR> Alot of the problems in RvR is that our spells have no range what so ever. I mean look at theurgist can send pets at a range of 50% futher away then we can even cast our Lifetap line of spells. That combined with our lack of AF (which seems bugged also now  <IMG SRC="frown.gif" border="0"> ) and our lack of HP's not only makes us meat bags in RvR but also outdoor PvE. Since Mez has been revamped and alot of our Mez's are broken quickly or just resisted we die quickly to high lvl pulls because we only get one shot before mobs are on us and groups.<P> As far as us haveing to use Quickcast just so we are able to have even a slim chance of casting a spell  before mobs are on us is rediculous  <IMG SRC="frown.gif" border="0"> We not only use twice the amount of mana as those with instant cast but also those with longer range spells they could cast.

Every point in Matter spec increases the AF provided by our shield spells by 3 (at level 30), and I&#8217;m told that this added AF gets better with the higher versions of the shield spell.  Furthermore, the Matter spec DoT is an enemy caster&#8217;s (or archer&#8217;s) nightmare.  The DoT takes them completely out of the battle for its duration.  Regardless, you are correct the Matter line is incomplete.<P>Now, the rest of your report is what I consider &#8220;far off the mark&#8221;.  You made several suggestions that no one wants, while neglecting to mention the suggestions we have asked for.  Run song is fine, we do not want it as a single target buf.  Levitation is cute, but hardly going to solve our class problems.  A force based pushback spell, no idea how this would be implemented, you&#8217;ll need to clarify.  Your damage reflection shield is a flight of fancy, while the damage reduction would be nice, it would most likely end up being implemented as a totally useless self-only damage shield.<P>      <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><HR> The general community if furious at this point. The frustration level is high. Sorcerors were fairly rare to begin with, not that many groups can not rely on their Mez to be quite as effective in groups, they are getting less group invites.

Many choose the sorcerer with the idea that we will be the best in crowd control and that is our niche. As sweeping changes are made to class abilities as a whole, it is becoming apparent that we are NOT necessarily the best at Crowd Control, and these changes actually do not address the initial imbalances they were intended for, but only weaken the other classes grouped into the category affected by the change. <HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>Whole heartedly agree, this was a good paragraph.<P>      <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><HR>Man, tough room here&#8230;.

Ravn...<P>I play a 26th Sorceress right now. I dont know what you consider HIGH level, but there is the answer to your question.<P>All I mostly do is group. Most of what my group hunts is purples. You know, those Golden Oak Fellwoods at lvl 21, Black popular fellwoods. All those are purple to me and I was mezzing them at lvl 20. At lvl 20 I was mezzing deep purple mobs in the Catacombs with AoE mezzes. I dont know where you hunt, but where I hunt AoE mezzes are life savers. <P>As to you grouping with smart tanks...are there any? Thought that was an oxymoron. I do call out next target when there are different targets to be had. See tree refernce above. I guess if all you hunt is the exact same mob over and over, no wonder you are bitter about your class you chose to play. <P>To your comment about minstrels: yes, I actually have one of them. It is actually my very 1st character in this game. Bards have ALWAYS been a jack of all trades class. They have ALWAYS had spells that do the same effect as what casters could do. Them being a jack of all trades is a class defining characteristic. <P>Where in my post did I ask for longer range nukes? You actually asked for longer range on our mezzes. I mispoke when i said nukes. There is no reason why we should have a longer range mez. <P>There is a time and a place for most of our spells in RvR. At 26, I actually do spend alot of time in RvR. Confusion works wonders when your group is engaged and a lone sniper decided to come and play. At 25, mez gets resisted alot more than confusion does. I can AoE mez the group I am fighting, then play with the sniper. Most of the RvR I do is small group or team hunts. If all you are doing is the 200+ keep battles, then I feel you are missing alot of the uses for our spells. <P><BR>So, I do know of which I speak. I feel that most of your flames/retort to bullseyes post was meant to flame and feel that most of your suggestions were assine(sp). To me, you seem like an ex-EQer that played an enchanter and feel that sorcerer's should be the same. I have been both and dont want my class to be like an EQ chanter at all. <P><BR>Nioron MacMorna<BR>Guinievere Server

Read the posts and I have to say, I totally agree with Ravn.  Sorcerers are weak and not equipped to do their job.  Up until about level 30, I was doing the crowd control (with a lot of help) because we naturally assumed that Sorcerers would be better at it.  If any of you know a minstrel or cleric who really knows his class, you'd realize they can do crowd control a lot better than we can.  They are better prepared to take the hits and have the spells to help them with crowd control.  Clerics have insta mez, stuns, more hp and better armour to take the hits.  Minstrels don't get insta mez, but they can keep a mob out indefinitely and they have stuns to help them do their job.  A good minstrel will also be able to twist a heal or manasong in  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"><P>RVR.  Haha.  Only recently started doing RVR but here's what some of my experiences have been like so far.  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">  Went to Emain last night.  First fight was against hibbies.  Tried to mez.  Out of range.  Stepped in closer and began casting.  &lt;soandso&gt; nukes you to death in two nukes.  Later on that night, we had about 20 middies at the Albion wall.  They were all pretty clustered together.  I thought "ooooh, perfect opportunity to mez them".  I hit my ae mez button.  Out of range.  Stepped in closer and began casting and then I got "you have been mezzed".  Some troll stepped in and then proceeded to whack me to death  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" border="0">  Don't get me wrong, I've been able to mez a small party when we surprise them.  Of course, they are usually grey - yellow only. :b  <P>We definitely need reduced casting time.  I would definitely love to get stun, but I doubt we'll ever get that.  If we can't get stun, we need to be able to quickcast mez as many times as we need to.  And to keep it from being so overpowering, I guess you could keep increasing the casting cost every time you quickcast it.  &lt;shrug&gt;  I personally could live with that because right now, all my power goes to nuking because the minstrels and clerics in my guild are doing the crowd control. <P>Aeriana<BR>36 Sorceress<BR>Punching Bag<BR>Gawaine<P>--------------------<P>Aeriana<BR>TnT

Well first I want to congratulate i3ullseye for doing a good job at assessing the sorcerer class. You don't hear that often because when you say things that does not benfit people, all sorts of posts will be made. For example, you stated that matter line need the most help which I agree. Not much people go the matter route. Therefore they do not know. To make it short, all I have to say is good job and keep up what you are doing. You are fair in your judgement.<P>Gader<BR>Sorceror, Merlin

I have come to the same conclusion as most the people on this board: namely, that our crowd control abilities are useless in situations where they should be effective. Whilst Confuse and Amnesia may work, people rarely notice me casting Amnesia to save a caster, and Confuse has such a ridiculous effect it generally results in the tanks going after the target and getting more aggro in the process, as the creature runs around the room and warps through walls. I normally get told off for casting this, even if it can save lives.<BR>Now, I am currently in the Catacombs with my level 30 Sorcerer, and my mezzes are very effective. I get hardly any resists because, presumably, the mobs are mostly orange to me. At the same time, the healers have gone to the Barrows at 26 (ok, perhaps a slight exaggeration) and are gaining experience at a much faster rate than me. I go to the Barrows and, if I am lucky enough to get an invite (because I bring nothing tangible to the group), I quickly become a costly liability. I can't mezz anything (aside from the occasional red mob in the first room), my debuffs don't appear to help in the slightest (target goes down very quickly anyway with a few tanks on it and Wizard nuking), and you have read my comments on Confuse and Amnesia.<BR>My point is, why should I be only be able to effectively mezz targets which give me pretty lame experience, whilst people who are the same level as me and playing tanks, for example, can hit targets I can't mezz?<BR>I was getting compliments in the Catacombs for my abilities to mezz, but when I go the Barrows at 30 I quickly look like a bad player, or at the very least a completely usless class.<BR>I know that everyone playing a Sorcerer thinks we should be able to mezz higher targets, or else how are we supposed to group effectively with people the same level who can take on those targets?<BR>Something is clearly wrong here. Either we should be able to contribute or they shouldn't be able to take them down so quickly.

kamdar,<P>Im sorry but the difference between a level 26 Sorcerer and a level 33 Sorcerer is immense.<P>You are at the turning point now, as you get closer and closer to level 30 you will begin to see what Ravn and others are so infuriated about.<P>I havent played in over a week, im having so little fun ( make that NO fun) with my 36 Sorcerer.      <IMG SRC="mad.gif" border="0"> <P>As for bullseye, I appreciate the job your trying to do, but I have to agree with ravn in as much as, the class doesnt need levitate or a single target speed spell. those are at best tertiary additions to our class.<P>The class takes a massive dive in playability/viabilty and fun post level 30, we need to be able to survive red and purple mobs beating on us for more than 1 second ! that is our primary weakness in PvE. As far as RvR goes, we as a class are a joke ! Ive tried many many times out there to join in the fun ! If I can get close enough to AE mezz, it usually spells the end for me a few seconds later.<P>Sorcerers are cannon fodder out there. The vast majority of our spells either do not work or are in the process of being nerfed.<P>Ask yourself this question....<P>How many other classes go into RvR and lose their primary ability  ? answer, none ! <BR>The nerf to charm (inability to charm players in RvR)  is the equivalent of an armsman going into RvR using only a shield because his sword/axe or polearm doesnt work in RvR,  they wouldnt stand for it and neither should we.<P>Mythic needs to be told straight, give us a viable role in RvR.<P>As for charming enemy players, its a MUST, all that needs working out are the details. I would propose a short duration charm, perhaps 20 seconds and then a freeze on recast for perhaps 10 minutes, details to be discussed. Charm, thats what we are about, or at least the vast majority of us. I had no idea when I chose a Sorcerer that I wouldnt be able to charm enemy players, I was really looking forward to it.<P>I'd change classes in a heartbeat if I had the chance ! thats how bad we are overall, thats why no one plays the class, least not in any significant numbers ! <P>I humbly suggest that next time you are asked a question that requires a specific answer, that you use ome creative license.<P>FORGET matter line altogether. Think to yourself, well 99% of Sorcerers are mind/body spec'd therefore I think either one of them needs something extra.<P>Any of the two fundemental spec lines would have done. I think by choosing matter you fell into a well designed trap.<P>If they now add to the matter line, myself and 99% of level 25+ Sorcerers are going to be hurting because we didnt spec that line.<P>So in closing, we need to be able to survive melee encounters for a few more seconds in PvE and we need our fundemental spell line to work in RvR OR be given a DAMN good replacement in the mind or body spec lines.<P>Some good ideas here from several posters.<P>I know you (bullseye) dont have to post here, but if you dont get a consensus from your piers, whats the point in your telling mythic anything.<P>Lets stop dancing around with tertiary spells and get our basic needs addressed. Thats post level 30 needs !

Hello all,<P>    Level 35 sorceror here.   I have to agree with Ravn also.   I'm getting pretty frustrated with this class.   I mezzed 2 wights at barrows and the both stuck.  Well that is great but the mezz broke in 5 seconds while the group was enganged with the third, and I died.   After that happened the cleric said maybe he should handle the mezzing since he can take more hits.  *sigh*.   Even though it ticked me off I know he's right.  I could care less about just about everyother issue sorcerors have, I just want our crowd control issues fixed.  I think thats why most chose this class.   <P>-Sillaf

I as well agree with Ravn. Not to slight 13ullseye, but before any fine tuning to a spell line need to be done, the class needs to be viable, first. You are 100% on the money that the Sorc community is pissed. <P>Three things need to be done, before ANY other tweaking is done:<BR>1.Un-nerf the mez resists<BR>2.Increase the range for ae/single target mez<BR>3.Reduce casting time on ae/single target mez<P>I'm not one to tell another man what to do, but you did choose to represent us and with every bit of requested input, I'd force feed them these three requests. <P>Fact is, in PvE we die lots. I've found that it is not at all productive to group for XP in dungeons (or really at all). I say this, considering if we attempt to do our job as lead cc'r. If we sit back, do minor debuffs and soak up XP, we are about as safe as other casters. I recomend 13ullseye go to the the Barrow's or do /who Barrows and see how many Sorc's are there. 99% of the time.... none, if you think I'm joking, try it.<P>I understand the question as it was posed to you, but in all honesty if I wanted DoT's, I would have made a Cabalist.<P>I can't believe it's already a week past, since our mez nerf and Mythic hasn't corrected it. This ISN'T like a minor class adjustment. Doing cc was dicey at best, now it's vitually out of the question (this being lvl30+). <P>For those commenting, but below lvl30, don't attempt to push issues in the name of being right. Look around, listen to your realm mates and appreciate that there might be things in the universe which you haven't grasped, quite yet.<P>respectfully yours,<P>Dop

!3ullseye,<P>I had sent you a PM on the vault boards offering my feedback, to which you completely ignored.<P>As you know I am one of the high level (currently half way through 41) Sorcerers on a populated server. You are a mid level Sorcerer on an underpopulated server.<P>With my knowledge and experience all I wanted to do was provide my feedback of the high level game, to which you completely ignored.<P>You may be doing a good job, but you still don't consult many of us. And we, after all, are the ones with the most experience.<P>With your letter to Mythic, I would probably agree with your points on the Matter line being the most incomplete. One thing I would strongly suggest in the future would be to consult the rest of us, who just might have some genuine ideas on spells other than the ones you want.<P>--------------------<P>Veragon- 41 Albion Sorcerer on Guinivere<BR>35 Body, 21 Mind

As a Sorc on Palomedies, I do not find it hard to get into groups.  In fact, I and my brethern are often sought after as group members ( once the requsite tanks and healers are in place of course).<P>So, I find the general statement of non-groupage somewhat silly.<P>Just for the record im a 2/3 mind/body spec. <P>I will include some observations from this weekends play in the Catacombs ( im lvl 27 ) where I went from lvl 24 to 27.<P>1.  No problem getting a group at all.  Sometime had to decline offers.<P>2.  When pulling Tribunes ( mostly low purple and later on red ) single target mez landed 100% of the time except when the mob was enguaged in close melee.  I used "pre-targeting and was much more successful in lading mez on mobs inbound than those already in combat. <P>3  Multiple target mez (ae) mostly successful on purples and reds ( and 80% roughly ) on oranges, same effect on engaged mobs vs. enrout.<P>4.  Was able to land mez on mobs who were less than 10% damaged ( eyeballed the damage vs the xp dot to guage..not accurate but best I could do.<P>5.  Debuffs didnt matter in combat as the mobs were often dead quickly.<P>6.  Same as #5 for dots.<P>7.  Confuse and amnesia were party-savers in every case.  Used only when the mob got onto the healer(s).  Amnesia resisted more when mob was in combat than not.  Confusion rarely resisted except by purples ( nasty ones ).<P>I found myself able to mez the adds, and keep mobs off the healers.  I did have my personal body guard ( thanks Rem!) who was assigned to keep mobs off me.  The primary spells used were Mez, Confuse, Amnesia, AE mez and Mind DD. ( which gets big adds against undead it seems).<P>In every case where we had a bad pull ( more than 3 purples ) if I died ( this only happened 3 times all weekend ) the party died.  If I was protected we lived with only one or two tank deaths ( Brave lads! ).<P>Perhaps dividing the spells into 2 categories will help in the discussion or analsys, Party use spells and Soloing spells.<P>One further note:  Those players who have played Eq with an Enchanter understand not to swat mezzed mobs and how the "parking lot" style of fighting works.  Generaly they have /assist macros set up and stay on one mob then get the next etc.  I does take some time to introduce this to UO players or those <P><BR>Dyyphyz Stonehead

well, i for one avoid the Vault boards like the plague. I didn't ignore your PM, i never recieved it as i dislike most of the rabid hyenas who frequent there. this is a much nicer atmosphere.<P>Second, enough already. i was NOT asked how to imprve the sorceror, i was asked WHICH SPELL LINE SEEMED THIN. And i answered it. For all the people jumping on each other for levels gained and so called experiences, there sure is a lot of basic misperceptions of how things work in this game. Most of the sorcerors on Pendragon do NOT have any real problems solo. The most blaring problem is in RvR.<P>--------------------<P>i3ullseye<BR>"You're good, but me?

Getting through to me won't help.<P><BR>Log onto pendragon and play some there. log some time there. petition problems there. that is the control environment, and if the few sorcerors who play there are taking all these changes in stride, and still soloing effectively, then nothing is going to change. If you can;t get an even level pet, and rip through blues almost non stop, soemthing is wrong. if you can't hunt 2 or 3 targets at once for nice group bonuses, you are NOT using all the tools at your disposal.<P>Read some of the online strategies people are posting on the web. try different spell combos. try different equipment.<P>Our target is to reliably solo blue MOBs for xperience at any given level. thats it, not yellow, not orange because we have a pet. Now with a pet we CAN do orange, and can fairly reliably do yellow. But the pet healing, the Xp split, and the downtime makes this NO MORE EFFICIENT THAN HUTNING RAW BLUES. This is not something we can cry about and change it, this is by design. Noone can hunt as many blues at once as us for an extended period of time. this generated a very healthy group bonus for us and actually makes us solo faster than most AT TARGET.<P>I think maybe it is I who is not getting through to most people here. The generally accepted idea of where classes should be power wise is NOT the mathematically engineered place that they fall in game. If we are intended to run at 22Mph in game, it doesn't matter if yout hin we shoudl go 25Mph, it isn't going to change.<P>--------------------<P>i3ullseye<BR>"You're good, but me?

How the heck did this get thrown off to "solo ability" ?<P>Solo ability is nothing to do with the main problems the class is having !<P>Its problems in GROUPS in PvE post 30 and a complete lack of viability at any level in RvR.<P>Bullseye, again, I thank you for your efforts, but how can you suggest I start a Sorcerer on pendragon ? I have a level 36 Sorcerer on a regular server. if I were to start over again I would not pick a Sorcerer, hell I can barely summon up the impetus to log in now.  If you mean I can start a Sorcerer get him to level 5 and then start telling them how badly the class sucks post 30, then I will do that !<P>Can I do that ?<P>Whether you like the IGN boards or not, they get results from Mythic and thats what this class needs POST 30 .<P>If you or any other Sorcerer isnt post level 30, then you/they just dont know what the gripe is all about......you will soon enough though !

Well !3ullseye, you specifically put a post on the Vault boards telling the people there you would check it at least once a week, and with writing that I thought you would get the PM.

!3ullseye:<P>I think that your original post addressed the question posed to you, and it has some good suggestions for the matter line, which IS our most useless spell line at ths point.<P>That having been said, I think one of the most vexing problem I personally am facing as a sorceror today is in RvR.  As others have commented (and as you have noted), it's just plain tough.  Although our AOE debuffs and mezzes are theoretically useful, it is difficult to survive long enough to use them.<P>Anyway, apart from the somewhat useless matter line and mezzing concerns of the class, I hope that we can become more viable in RvR.  I think that making the "confuse" spell work on other players -- for a much shorter duration -- might be a step in the right direction, and I hope that perhaps you could pass this suggestion along if the opportunity presents itself.<P>EDIT: I think the "soloing" aspect of the thread arose because that's the way Mythic balances the classes/game -- by gauging how well you solo blues.  A viable balancing strategy?  Not entirely sure, but I think not.<P>EDIT #2: I think that it's tough to expect your paying customers to invest significant time playing a game on a "test" server.  There needs to be some incentive for playing there, and there currently is not.  I think that it makes more sense to test as much as you can for bugs on the test server, then release the patch and get the balance feedback from the community as a whole.  Perhaps if that is the model used, it makes sense to select a number of individuals from all servers who are willing to provide feedback and compile the information they provide on the changes.  That might provide a representative sampling of how the changes affect balance, while reducing the millions of posts that Mythic would otherwise need to read through.<P>--------------------<P>--Kestrel Trebor, Sorceror<BR>The Sacred Brotherhood<BR>"Honor, loyalty, and above all, brotherhood!"<BR>Albion, Percival Server

Hello all,<P>May I start by saying Amen to Anum and Ravn.  Great posts.  We don't have a problem with the present Team Leader but lead where the masses want to go.  I am not saying you can get something fixed but you are our voice with Mythic.  Speak to the problems that concern most of us.  The pet problems and solo ability is at most a secondary concern. The game was built on an RVR Engine and I hate to say it boys and girls but Sorcerers suck RVR at present. Most 30+ Sorcerers are concerned with the following. <P>-Class Limitations with respect to RVR <P>-Lack a Mezzing Dominance as a Class<P>Point 1- Casting on an enemy rvr is great when you have to practically have to charge them to get within spell range.  What is the point when you know the tank are going to sprint at the fool caster that wanted to drop a nuke on them and crush them after your 1st spell lands.  Did they developers even take into account spell range with respect to an enemy sprinting at a caster? Endurance nothing a tank can easily kill a sorcerer without using styles.  It really fumes me when I see Theurgists and Wizards nuking away RVR when I still quite a ways out of range.<BR>Solution- We need longer range or heck I would love even 1 bolt type spell that can potentially hit from a range of more than 1500. Longer Range, Longer Range.<P>Point 2- Why would a group offer a spot to a sorcerer when a Smite Cleric can stun? It is more or less same result as mez, but a cleric can wear metal armor, has more hit points, and can heal (i.e. they are tougher than a sorcerer/don't die in 2 hits) Oh and can rez playered that died.<BR>Solution- I don't know but I am rather pissed that cleric's can do what our class was tailor made to do but with instant cast.<BR>As I see it, each class should have something they do best.  Healers/Cleric well they should heal the best no argument.  We should crowd control the best and right now I dont think that is the case.<P>In closing, I noticed Sillaf posted.  He and I being 2/3 of the all sorcerers 35+ on our server posting about the problems with this class says something. That is right.  On our server there are only 3 sorcerers 35+. Maybe 8 total over 30th level. Why would anyone play a sorcerer when it has so many problems.  Changes need to be made.<P>Lembolas Dazzlebolt<BR>Gawaine<P>--------------------<P>-Lembolas Dazzlebolt

Well said Lembolas, your final point about the numbers of level 30+ Sorcerers on your server clearly makes the point.<P>Why are there so few of us  ?  because we are a very broken class post 30.

Sorry guys, this i the vocal minority syndrom at it's worst. <P>Do we have issues?  yes.<P>Do I bring them up, especially RvR? yes.<P>I fought tooth and nail against the reduced duration of our mez, and i am still fighting it as best i can. it was just a bad move all around. But may of the other items are just not what the MAJORITY of sorcerors seem to think. <P>In game many sorcerors group on many live servers. The sorceror still has the most crowd control tools available of any Albion class. There are server logs, and dev witnesses that refute MANY of the statements here. Stun is NO WAY near as useful as Mez as an opening spell, in PvP or PvE. Other classes are doign things with spells almost identical to ours that many here complain hey can't do.<P>Sorry, but the majority is not represented here.  <P>Now there are gret ideas here, and good feedback. I do NOT discuss items from Pendragon here, because then all i get is hearsay and opinion. Every time a sorceror posts their successes in PvP or in a good gorup, it immediately gets washed under by all the negative screams of how weak we are.<P>WE HAVE PROBLEMS!<P>But they are not the problems most here scream. The vault is MUCh worse. If a theurgist can do fine, with a lower pet, and less crowd control, how are we so damned gimped? easy, we aren't.<P>So based on hat he design team wants us to be, we need to fix the problems with what is not working and go from there. I am now getting direct feedback from he devs on issues like amnesia being broekn, if Charisma has ANY use whatsoever, how quickcast works, etc...<P>Things are now getting back on track after a huge launch. I don't expect them to be full swing till after the holidays. But they are coming in line.<P>So lets do what they ask, and fix what is wrong. THEN we can make suggestions for improvement.<P>and BTW..once again it is verified. Quick cast is indeed uninterruptable. If you can log one bing truly interrupted please post it or mail it to me, but as i have yet to see one the issue may b one of technique or hardware/lag issues.<P>--------------------<P>i3ullseye<BR>"You're good, but me?

Heh,<P>Bullseye, this is the most high level (30+)Sorcerers I have seen in one place.<P>I had a thread or two over at the IGN dev board and almost all of what I said here was supported there.<P>So, where are the majority of Sorcerers that your talking to ?  and what level are they ?<P>I just cant help but think they must be below level 30, because almost to a man/woman every level 30+ Sorcerer ive spoken to or conversed with in any form, says what ive said here.<P>Were in need of serious fixing in RvR and some way to survive more than a second of a mob beating on us in PvE.<P>We solo great in PvE when we can find a pet    <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"><P>So, again I ask the question, where are the majority of Sorcerers that you're talking to ?  and what level are they ?

so you have logged onto EVERy server and talked to EVERY sorceror over 30 no matter what time they have ogged on? i think not.<P>There are probably 5 sorcerors on pendragon that are over 30, mroe than a live server? i think not.<P>This is not just me here, this is the devs, the other TLs, and many MANY server logs. <P>this is also the largest gorup i have found of dedicated sorcerors on any forum, and it is great. but how many actually post here? A dozen? maybe 20? that is FAR from the majority on all servers.<P>--------------------<P>i3ullseye<BR>"You're good, but me?
