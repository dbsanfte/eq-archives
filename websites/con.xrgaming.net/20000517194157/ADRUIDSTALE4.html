My journey to Felwithe had shown me many new and wondrous things.  A city of unparalleled beauty, a world of which I had so little knowledge of beyond fables and legend.  It had also shown me a world of pain and sacrifice.  The evil trap set by the Crushbone Orcs had revealed to me their ways.  Ways of treachery and deceit.  Murder and Chaos.  This too, I now knew as part of the world I lived in. </P><P>&#9;As I returned to the guild hall, I was met by Master Heartwood.  He had been wondering what I had been up to on this day.  A day on which I had risen so early and been gone so long.  A day on which I had returned battered and beaten, yet still alive.</P><P>&#9;"I was on a quest, Master"  I answered hesitantly.</P><P>&#9;"Did you find what you were after Kaali?"  he asked.</P><P>&#9;I paused for a moment, and said "I'm afraid so".  It was the only answer that I could give that seemed the truth.</P><P>&#9;He nodded and turned to leave.</P><P>&#9;"I went to Felwithe Master"  I mumbled.</P><P>&#9;He stopped and turned to me "Indeed?  What did you find there Kaali?"</P><P>&#9;I related the events that had occurred during my journey.  I told him of the group of High-Elf I had first encountered, of how they were careless and acted as children.  I told him of my first sights of the city, and how awe inspiring I had found it, and of the wondrous pool I had found in the city, and of my unfortunate discovery that it was indeed not for swimming.</P><P>&#9;I think it was the first time I had ever heard the Master laugh.  </P><P>&#9;I then told him of the trap set by the Orcs.  Of how they had attacked the High-Elf hunting parties without cause or mercy, and how they had been turned, and defeated.  How they had killed two of the High-Elf, and would have killed us all.</P><P>&#9;Master Heartwood did not seem surprised.  He placed his hand on my shoulder and told me that this was the way of the Orcs, and that they knew not of mercy or compassion.  He reminded me of the earliest teachings of the Druid.  Of how it was our duty to maintain balance against such creatures and vanquish them at every turn.  </P><P>&#9;I saw something in this that I had not realized in all my years in the guild schools.   We, the Druids, were the opposing force, the balance against their ways.  For every merciless act and cold hearted deed done by the Orc, it was us, the Soldiers of Tunare that would be the balance against their tyranny.  For as long as the Orc existed, we the druid would stand vigil against them.  This was a never ending struggle, or at least, a struggle that would not end until all that was of the Orc was destroyed.</P><P>&#9;Balance in its purist form.</P><P>&#9;I slept uneasy that night, disturbed by dreams of the days events.  I saw the faces and twisted bodies of those slain, and of the numerous Orc dead.   I could hear the screams of pain, and the look on the faces of those who had survived, as they looked upon their friends who had not.</P><P>&#9;I woke the next morning still exhausted from the day before and the restful nights sleep I never got.  As I exited the guild hall, I was greeted with a sound that seemed to make the previous days events fade for a bit.</P><P>&#9;"Hail, soapfoot!  You druid folk sure know how to waste a day!"  </P><P>&#9;It was Raij, already back from an early morning hunt.</P><P>&#9;</P><P>&#9;"Well met Raij.  Good to see you.  Good to see anyone for that matter."  I quipped.</P><P>&#9;I was still quite sore and stiff from the most recent battle and I fear it showed in my manner.  Raij looked at me curiously and asked why I was so.  I began to relate the tale of my adventures and of the Orc trap.  As I did, I could see Raij beginning to form an idea in his mind.  A crafty fellow was he, always planning, always thinking, always on the lookout for an opportunity.   </P><P>&#9;It was then that I noticed a sly grin appear on his face.</P><P>&#9;"Oh dear, I know that look my friend.  What are you up to now?" I said apprehensively.</P><P>&#9;"What?  Who me?" he said, the grin now a broad smile. His eyes shot back and forth to see who was about.  "Ever seen Crushbone?" he asked in his low grumbled tone.</P><P>&#9;I'd never seen this place that the Orc call their home.  All knew of it, all knew where it was, and most had sense enough to avoid it.  I also knew that Raij had been talking of going there since the first day we had met.</P><P>&#9;"You like to slay Orcs eh?  I know how this can be done, and perhaps even do all of us a favor in the balance" he said.</P><P>&#9;"Not to mention the tidy profit, eh ranger?" I retorted coldly.</P><P>&#9;"Aye. You have something against profit soapfoot?" he said, barely holding back a laugh.</P><P>&#9;"These Orc have deep pockets and they don't trust each other enough to leave their gold in banks as we do." and with that, he pulled a heavy bag from his pack, filled to the top with gold, silver and copper coins.</P><P>&#9;"This is just from this morning."  he stated proudly, as he jingled the coins about in the air mocking me.</P><P>&#9;"I told you I don't care about money, Raij."  and almost believed it myself for a second.</P><P>&#9;"I've seen you looking about the armory, Kaali.  I know how badly you want that fine steel Warhammer the smith just put up for sale.  A fine weapon it is, one of his finest, but free is not in his way.  Not even for a good natured druid orcslayer such as yourself." he teased, poking me in the ribs with his finger.</P><P>&#9;He was more than right.  I wanted that weapon very badly.  The rusty old hammer I had gotten from the centurion a few weeks back was adequate, but a bit on the heavy and battered side.  The balance and heft of the one I had seen was perfect.  A true warriors weapon.  It felt good in my hand, but the cost was well beyond my capabilities at the moment.</P><P>&#9;"So you think I could get that much?"  I asked quietly.</P><P>&#9;"...and then some" he whispered. "C'mon"</P><P>&#9;With that, we were off.  Raij quickly found the trail to Crushbone and we made our way carefully through the woods.  On our way, we happened across a lone centurion and dispatched him and his pawn squire with little effort.  Raij was right, these foolish Orcs always carried their wealth along, and I took 6 silver and a fist full of copper coins from this one alone.  Raij called it a present, and took only the cloth armor from its body.</P><P>&#9;I knew what he was doing.  This was but an incentive for what was to come.  </P><P>&#9;It was working.  I could feel that hammer in my hand as I closed my fist tightly around the loot I had gathered.</P><P>He knew he couldn't go alone, but with help he thought he could fill his pockets, fill OUR pockets, and leave quickly before being discovered by the rest of the clan.  The plan seemed solid enough.  We would hide outside and venture only far enough in to gather a few items and leave.</P><P>&#9;We stopped and hid in a thick stand of trees just beyond the main entrance to Crushbone.  A few Orcs could be seen milling in and out of the opening, unaware of our presence.  We couldn't see into the main area, but knew it was just beyond the two guards that stood out front.</P><P>&#9;It was still mid day and we knew better than to go forth without cover of darkness, so we made a few notes of surrounding cover and escape routes in the area and headed back to the city to await nightfall.  Along the way back, we encountered a group of heavily armed dwarf.  All were dressed in chain or plate  and brandishing true warriors weapons.  Friendly an quite jovial were these folk, always laughing and joking with each other.  They offered us a bit of meade and some food, and during our visit, we mentioned what we had planned for the evening.</P><P>&#9;"Quite so?"  said Eurlas, the leader of the dwarf party.  "We would do well in such an endeavor, might we join you?"</P><P>&#9;"Aye" said his second."We'll be needing a bit of gold to keep us in meade" and laughed a hearty dwarven laugh.</P><P>&#9;His men all agreed and laughed at the prospect of killing a few Orc and making a profit for the effort.</P><P>&#9;I was a bit relieved that Raij and I would have some help in the coming raid we had planned, and gratefully thanked them for their assistance.</P><P>&#9;As the sun dropped beyond the horizon, we were on the move.  The dwarves, Raij and myself moved quietly and quickly through the familiar woods and were at Crushbone in a flash.</P><P>&#9;Eurlas peered silently over the stump of a fallen tree.  Barely tall enough to see over it, it seemed almost comical to watch. He began to whisper to his men in his dwarven tongue, the language his men knew best.  He wanted no mistakes when it came to his orders, and his men knew him well enough to do exactly as he said.  These once jovial folk were hardened warriors, and now appeared quite different than when we had met earlier.  Deathly intense were each of them as Eurlas gave his direction.</P><P>&#9;"You lads stay by me" he said. "We'll be ready to go in a moment"  </P><P>&#9;He motioned with just the slightest nod of his head to his second and they vanished into the darkness in the blink of an eye.  Not a sound could be heard as they moved.  These were soldiers of the highest caliber and knew precisely what was expected of each of them.  Raij and I watched as the first of the two guards simply disappeared, taken by the first group.  </P><P>&#9;The other guard stood barely a half dozen steps from the first, and noticed nothing.  He dutifully marched his post and walked into the shadow near the cave entry.  He too was not seen again.</P><P>&#9;"Stay close lads" said Eurlas, and we moved from the cover we had found to just outside of the entrance.   As we approached, I could see the first guard laying in a darkened corner near the cave.  He had been gutted like a fish and lay in a spreading pool of his own blood.   </P><P>&#9;My stomach rolled over at the sight.  Eurlas noticed my revulsion and whispered with a sly smile "Never mind him boy, he'll be causing us no trouble" and we moved quietly into the dark entrance.</P><P>Once inside, the groups formed back up to either side of the entry.  We slid silently along the walls of the entry way until we could see around the first corner.  Three more guards sat by a small fire built to stave off the cold in the dank interior of the cave.  Eurlas held up three stubby mail covered fingers and pointed around the corner.  In the darkness I could see his men nod, and begin to creep around the corner.</P><P>&#9;The first arrow dropped the largest guard to the ground, dead before he landed.  The other two guards stood for a moment looking at their comrade in disbelief.  This was one moment too long.  I doubt they ever knew what hit their friend, as they too were dead before they could utter a sound.</P><P>&#9;"Those are yours"  whispered Eurlas, and he immediately turned his attention to the next corner.  Raij and I blinked at each other wide eyed and quickly gathered the items from the bodies and dragged them back around the corner into the darkness.  We then shoveled dirt onto the fire to better conceal ourselves and quickly caught up to the group.</P><P>&#9;The cave entrance showed no indication of what we saw next.  The Orcs masses did not live in a cave as I had been told.  The entrance opened up into what appeared to be an enclosed valley of some sort.  The moon and night sky shown brightly down and lit the area.  I could see a banner with some form of crude skull or deaths head drawn on it standing near the opening just ahead, painted in what appeared to be dry blood.</P><P>&#9;We could see no movement beyond the opening and moved towards it slowly.  As we reached the opening, I was startled when a large figure rounded the corner and came into full view of the entire group.  It was huge, easily twice the size of the centurion we had encountered earlier.  Before it could move, three of the dwarf soldiers leaped upon it, slashing it open and hurling it back into the entry way towards the rest of the group.   It growled loudly and swiped at Eurlas with its claw.  I swung my hammer high over my head and crashed it hard into the beasts face, spiting its skull open and spraying myself with its blood.  Raij raised his axe and in a single slicing strike, took its head off cleanly and quietly.</P><P>&#9;The Orcs body landed with a thud.  Raij and I stood staring in awe at the size of this Orc.  Never had we seen one this size, and I began to rethink the wisdom of the adventure we were undertaking.  </P><P>&#9;Eurlas looked at us in amazement and joked "Perhaps you two should go on and we'll just wait here, eh?"</P><P>&#9;"What is the world is this thing!" I asked excitedly.</P><P>&#9;"A legionaire"  Raij whispered.  "you never see these outside the encampment".</P><P>&#9;"Good!" I said in disbelief.</P><P>&#9;We quickly looted the body and dragged it too, back into the cover of the caves darkness.  Eurlas and his men were on the move again.  They stealthily checked around both sides of the entry and we ran quietly to the cover of some large rocks just beyond the opening.</P><P>&#9;I could smell cook fires nearby as we surveyed the area for the next victims.  Raij heard the growling voices of some Orc talking just over a nearby hill, and the group slid up the hillside to have a look.  As we slowly crested the hill, tents and fires could be seen just below, several Orc walking about eating and growling at each other.  A stream ran through the encampment and tunnels leading into various darkened areas could be seen all around.</P><P>&#9;I began to think that this was truly a bad idea.  The tunnels could hold an entire legion of Orc that could spring on us without a moments notice and we should perhaps be thinking of leaving instead of moving further in.  I now had more than enough to afford the warhammer I wanted and considerably more, as did Raij and the others.   A small group of the dwarves had taken 5 more centurion just across a nearby bridge and were now loaded with the various weapons and money their prey had been carrying.</P><P>&#9;"O.K. lads, enough for one evenings work" said Eurlas and motioned to his men to head to the opening.  We crept back down the hill and started heading towards the entrance.</P><P>&#9;I felt a cold chill, as fate reached out and touched me with an icy finger.</P><P>&#9;As I stood and turned to head down the hill, a stone gave way underneath me and sent me tumbling and crashing into the stream running just below.  I entered the water with a loud splash, as my head impacted the rocks at the bottom of the stream.</P><P>&#9;Dazed and now underwater, I struggled to regain my senses and find my way out.  As I finally reached the surface, I gasped for air I found that I had flowed along in the stream until I was now in the middle of the Orc encampment.   I dove deeply back into the water and hoped that none of the numerous Orc nearby had heard me splashing about.</P><P>&#9;I peered up from the stream and saw I was still being carried along by the current and was now well away from the Orc camp....and my company of friends.  </P><P>&#9;The sides of the stream bed were high and slick with no hand holds to be found.  I bounced against the sides and continued along in the stream until I came close to one of the many tunnels that were all about the campsite.  I reached as high out of the water as I could and just caught the corner of an opening with my hammer and pulled myself up to look into the tunnel, my head still spinning from the hard collision with the rock I had taken when I hit the water. </P><P>&#9;It was dark as pitch and I could see nothing but just the faintest bit of light coming from the far end of the tunnel.  I had no choice, I could either try to find my way back to the party on land, or let fate and the stream carry me to who knows where.  I decided to take the chance and began to pull myself into the tunnel.</P><P>&#9;I felt a hard crash to my face that sent me flying backwards back into the water.  As my vision cleared I saw an Orc centurion jump into the water, swimming rapidly towards me.  My head still spinning, I began to cast a spell, targeting the Orc.  A crash of lightning hit the Orc and I saw his body spasm at the shock, roaring involuntarily while still submerged.  I could see a cloud of blood beginning to fill the water.  Still he came closer.  I attempted to cast again when he bashed me hard in the chest, knocking the wind from my lungs and disrupting the spell.  </P><P>&#9;I shot to the surface to regain my breath and readied my hammer.  The Orc surfaced just in front of me, searching the waters for where I had gone, his back to me.  I dealt a crushing blow to the back of its hideous head, sending it deep into the water.  I turned to try and swim away fast and suddenly felt something grab my leg and pull me once again under the water.</P><P>&#9;I kicked hard and felt my boot contact the Orc.  My leg was free and I swam as hard as I could.   Once away I turned and began to cast a burst of fire, not knowing if it would work underwater.  A bright flash filled the stream and the water boiled all around sending steam into the chilly night air.</P><P>&#9;I again readied the hammer for the Orcs next attack, but none would come.  As I searched the waters for the centurion, I saw the Orc bob to the surface, floating face down in the stream, being carried away by its fast flowing waters.  I looked around and the only way still to be seen was the tunnel the Orc had come from.  I again reached and grabbed the edge of the tunnel and pulled myself up.  I listened hard for another attack, shield and hammer ready, but I was alone.</P><P>&#9;I had to find my way back to my friends and headed to the light emanating from the end of the tunnel.  As I reached it, I slowly peeked around the corner in an attempt to figure out where I was.  The tunnel exited into the main area where the Orc had been eating and I knew then where I was.  Two Orc legionnaire sat eating at the far end of the compound and were the other side of a large fire built in the middle.  If careful, I might be able to sneak around the corner and disappear before they would notice.  </P><P>&#9;I began trying to make my way to the rocks just around the corner of the campsite when I heard a roar and running from behind me.  I hard blow stuck me across the back, knocking me instantly to the ground.  I rolled over and swung my hammer blindly, striking a very large and angry Orc legionnaire hard across the knee.  It howled loudly and swung the club it carried forcefully across my skull, sending me tumbling across the compound.  Blood was now flowing from my many wounds and I could taste blood, my back ripped open by the first blow landed.  I stood and tried in vain to cast a heal on myself, but another crash from the legionnaires heavy club landed squarely in my chest, and with a loud crunch, sending me flying into the stone wall behind me.</P><P>I collapsed in a pile on the ground.  The blood from my wounds ran down into my eyes and I could barely see.  I could hear footsteps and the growling sound of heavy breathing coming closer.  As it slowly approached me, I could hear it growling its barbaric hissing version of the common tongue &quot;There is no place in our realm for woodelves like you!&quot;, and through the blood in my eyes I could see it raise the club high over its head, about to deliver its death blow.</P><P>I closed my eyes.  There was nothing I could do.  My body was badly broken and I was rapidly bleeding to death.  The pain was now replaced with a cold numb feeling in my arms and legs.  I hadn't the strength to even lift my shield and my weapon now lay useless in my hand.</P><P>I knew what was next, and readied myself best I could.  </P><P>What happened next, I could not have readied myself for.  Raij and the dwarf warriors, yelling battle cries that would wake the dead, raced into the compound and leaped onto the Orc with all they had.  The legionnaire began to swing the club, when three arrow from the dewarven bows slammed into it, knocking it backward and flat onto its back.  Raij raced over to it and with a cursing yell, buried his minotaurs ax deeply between its eyes. </P><P>I remember little other than the sounds of an intense battle.  I heard an Orc fall, and then another.  The numbing feeling in my body was growing.  </P><P>I was dying.  Then all was silent.  </P><P>I regained consciousness for a moment, and saw Raij standing over me, binding my wounds, and carrying me through the opening through which we had entered Crushbone.  I then remember looking up at the night sky, and noticing it was now becoming light.  </P><P>"Soapfoot, hold on, we're getting help" said Raij.  His tone sounded grim.  We were far off from any kind of help, and I knew I would not last much longer.</P><P>"It's ok friend Raij.  I hear the Mother of All is calling me.  Its time for me to go…" and with that, darkness fell for the final time.   </P><P>The pain from my injuries that had seconds before been blasting into my mind with the force of a thousand stinging wasps, was now gone.  </P><P>I felt no pain.  </P><P>I felt nothing at all.  The ground under my feet seemed to fall away and I felt as if floating.  I could feel no breeze against my skin.  It was neither warm nor cold.  All was silent.</P><P>I knew I was dead.</P><P>I tried hard to look around me but could see nothing, yet the darkness was not that of being inside a cave.  Complete calm surrounded me.</P><P>As I stood looking hard into this unknown darkness, I could see the dimmest of light in the far off distance.  Like the light from a candle in a distant window, I strained with all I could to see what was there, but could not.</P><P>I felt myself starting to move towards it, but was not walking.  I was being carried along by forces unseen.  The light grew brighter, and brighter still.  As it grew larger, I could see it taking shape.  A shape I did not recognize, but was yet strangely familiar.</P><P>As I floated there in this great void, I began to realized what was now before me.  Glowing as a thousand sunrises, and giving off an unearthly comforting warmth.</P><P>I now stood in judgment before the Mother of All.</P><P>The intensity emanating from this being was overwhelming, yet no malice was felt.  </P><P>Then a voice was all around, yet was felt from deep inside me.  An echoing thunderous sound but claming and soothing in its nature.</P><P>"Kaali, your greed has been your downfall, but your death has been deemed unjust.  You must return to your world until we once again call you to us.  All that you knew, all that you were, is now gone.  You must begin again".</P><P>I tried hard to speak, to ask what became of my friends, of Raij and Master Heartwood, of my home, but could  make not a sound.</P><P>With that, the visage was gone and the blackness of the void returned.</P><P>I could feel my head beginning to spin.  The void was now alive with energy.  It felt as if all the storms of a thousand years now surrounded me.  Light began to fill the void, brighter and brighter until the black void was now as if cast into the sun.  A cold blast lifted me and was now carrying me aloft.  I was tumbling over and over, faster and faster. I knew no up, no down.  It was as if I were being pulled apart by all the forces of the universe...and then, once again, silence.</P><P>My head slowed its spinning and my eyes began to focus.  I felt odd, different somehow.  My belly felt quite empty, my mouth dry as sand.  My skin could now feel icy breeze flowing across it.  I looked hard into the gray white that surrounded me.  All was strange and unfamiliar.  I took a step forward as my eyes began to focus.  I could feel something strange all about, but couldn’t identify it.   The ground crunched under my feet.  The wind now blew hard against my face, stinging me with a cold blast and tiny bits of ice carried aloft by an oncoming storm.</P><P>All around me for as far as I could see through the building storm, was white.  Mountains of ice and snow towered above me.  The trees I had come to know in my home were not to be seen, nor was the grasses or platforms of my home. I was standing at the gaping cavernous opening to an unknown, alien world.</P><P>I looked hard into the storm, trying in vain to see something, ANYTHING familiar.  I saw only a lone figure running towards my position.  Huge and muscular, he had the look of some kind of warrior. He carried a huge rough hewn blade and a wooden shield that looked worn and beaten.  Dressed in an armor made of some odd looking skins, he looked to be as tall as the trees I had now apparently left far behind.  </P><P>As he approached, I realized, he was not so large as he had appeared….or more to the point, I was now as large as he.</P><P>I looked down at myself for the first time since I had been set here by forces unknown.  My arms and legs were bare, as was my chest, with little more than a tattered piece of cloth wrapped loosely around my waist.  I too, felt a large sword in my hand, well worn and battered, but I knew this somehow, to be mine.</P><P>&quot;Hail friend&quot; I yelled, trying hard to be heard over the howling winds that surrounded me.  &quot;Where by the gods am I?&quot;</P><P>The rushing stranger stopped dead in his tracks, and looked at me as if I were crazed.</P><P>&quot;Are ya daft boy?&quot;  he yelled. &quot;You’re where ya always been, get out of the storm ya blasted fool!&quot; and rushed past me to the cover of the cave.</P><P>&quot;But where?&quot; I yelled to him, following just behind as he ducked around a corner.</P><P>There he stood, shaking the snow from his armor and blade, and stomping his feet and brushing his beard to shed the water and ice that had gathered there. </P><P>He looked hard at me, a concerned hard gaze met my eyes as he said  &quot;Have ya been clubbed in the head boy?&quot; </P><P>I met his question with a blank stare.  My mouth hanging open.  I had no idea what he was talking about.</P><P>&quot;Ya need to learn ta duck once in a while ya fool!&quot; he laughed.</P><P> What he said next, echoes in my brain still to this day.</P><P>&quot;You’re in Everfrost, same as you’ve always been!&quot;</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
