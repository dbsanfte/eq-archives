<center><font class="MenuHeader" size=+1>An Interview With Gordon!</font><br>
<font size=-1>(By Atomic></font></center>
<br><br>
<font class="BaseFont"><b>
<img src="http://con.xrgaming.net/gfx/verant/building3.jpg" width=250 align=right> As a long-time pen and paper role-player, I can identify several points about the genre, and what makes them so popular among the people who play them. First and foremost is the feeling or sense of belonging to an entire community of gamers who share the common goal of exploring and conquering the fictional world in which their avatar resides. After all, if the person sitting next to you was not taking his role as rogue or wizard of our band of adventurers seriously, that person would not have lasted long in our group. Apply this to the digital age and the emergence of massively multiplayer games, and we quickly have created a rabid, demanding public whose sole purpose it seems at times is to take their role-playing to the next level. Obviously some are more serious or sincere than others, and frequently flames arise with one group pointing fingers at the other, claiming they have ruined their gameplay experience and need to rectify their wrongdoing. It’s at this critical mass when a true champion must step in, clarify each groups point of view, and remind us all we’re still trying to have fun by playing a game. Gordon Wrinn, known and loved by the EQ public as Abashi, is such a champion.
<br><br>
Recently promoted to a member of the EQ Live team, Gordon began his service as the internet relations manager for EQ. That role commands a lot of time and patience, as he pays attention to as much of the players on various message boards as possible. “I spend a lot of time on the boards,” he explains, “ communicating with the public to see that their issues are brought before the development team, and to make sure the decisions from the development team are returned to the players.”
<br><br>
Truly the task is incredible, as nearly three hundred thousand fans attempt to get his attention. Attempting to communicate with such volume is insurmountable, but he feels compelled to give as much back to the players as they send along the boards. The trouble with trying to gather ideas and comments and sum them up in such a way as to promote the continuation of individual comments lies in the diversity of the gaming audience. “Addressing player concerns in a manner that makes them feel like they are an individual is one of the biggest problems that we have,” Gordon says. “It’s something we’d obviously like to do in every case; a ‘holy grail’ that we like to search for is to give everyone individual attention. One of the problems with having a subscriber base this large is that it is extremely diverse, with people from hundreds of countries and all walks of life. We have everyone from adolescents who play on accounts provided by their parents to grandparents who play the same game and in the same amounts of time as well. As far as the number of hours played I don’t think there’s any significant difference between the age groups. The problem we run into is that often we get one group in conflict with another. It’s in cases like this where we can’t please everyone.
<br><br>
<img src="http://con.xrgaming.net/gfx/verant/gordon.jpg" width=250 align=left>“It comes down to matters of individual perception,” he continues, “and with so many different perceptions out there it is very difficult. That is directly caused by the size of the EQ player base. Some of the games out there now, and some that are coming up who have a smaller subscriber base find it easier to please a larger percentage of them. That is our goal being so large to give the players the feeling like they are being given individual attention while at the same time being able to address the concerns of the players as a whole.”
<br><br>
With the volume and diversity discussing all things EverQuest on the multitude of message boards takes a thick skin. Although there are plenty of good ideas and suggestions out there, players for some reason still choose to vent frustrations or ‘flame’ the game’s creators, and can cause headaches for all parties involved. As the game has matured however, Gordon feels the public has been giving out more praise and suggestions than displaying their displeasure. “From a signal-to-noise ratio on the boards,” Gordon summarizes, “it’s gotten a lot better lately because of some of the changes we’ve made, and there are a lot more issues out there that we are moving forward on. Players come onto the boards to ‘gripe’ about something and it shows they’re definitely into the game. That has become one of the stronger groups of our player base, and some are more opinionated than others are. Everybody gripes about valid issues, and we find it’s more of a passion than anything else is. I hate to use the term ‘valid’ issues, because everything is valid at least in the players’ mind. It’s more a question of if their issues are something that can be addressed or included in EQ. Sometimes we need to say no, but there have been plenty of things we were able to do. The difficulty now is getting past the things that are known and moving on to the newer and better things that we have to consider.”
<br><br>
Some of the many issues brought forth by the players address concerns which have been part of the game’s design all along. “Probably the biggest issues we see right now are class balance issues,” states Gordon. “We call them ‘class-envy’ issues. Usually one class wants to do whatever another class can, or why this certain class can do something they can’t. It really depends on how it’s presented. Everyone knows that there must be strengths and weaknesses in the class-based system, and that’s just the disagreement on what those weaknesses should be. Someone doesn’t like what a necromancer can do, or someone wants to do what the necromancer can do. If you try to adjust another class to suit that, or bring down the necromancers to even them, then the necromancers would get upset either way. That would get players of other classes upset. Monks would want to do more damage than warriors, and in some cases do, but not by the margin that they’d like. At the same time, warriors are happy with the balance, and don’t want the margin increased.”
<br><br>
Gordon also related how some players are envious of other players’ ability to advance quickly though the ranks. Changing some of these fundamental principles of the game world would do more harm than help in most cases. “Some of the things we deal with are players concerns that the it takes so long to advance in the game, but at the same time there are another group of players which I think is considerably larger that is perfectly happy with how they’ve advanced in the game. If advancement were adjusted to be faster, all of a sudden we’d have a group who feels cheated by people they felt they were competing against. That’s a perfectly valid play style, and suddenly they’d have an easier time of it. A player could have taken a hundred days played to reach a certain level, and now someone could do it in thirty. It’s a case where some of the things certain groups find objectionable about the game at the same time are found admirable by other groups.”
<br><br>
Maintaining the interest and focus of players significantly depends on the fiction within the game world. Some comments from players question the story behind EverQuest, regarding its apparent absence from gameplay. Gordon says that is part of the design and mystery of adventuring in Norrath. “We provide a lot of story and create a backdrop. People say there is no story behind EQ, but if they look for it, it’s there. Go talk to various NPC’s, and even on low-level quests you’ll find a lot of back-story and history of Norrath. There are books for sale on vendors which have stories written by one NPC to another. There are entire sites out there on the web that have Norrath history sections, and I look at these and find things even I didn’t know. There’s just so much of it out there.”
<br><br>
Placing that fiction into the hands of the gamers can have some surprising results. The players get deep into their characters, and bring them to life while communicating across the boards. “I see a lot of true role-playing on the news sites and boards,” muses Gordon, “and I think it’s essential to massively multiplayer games. There’s no way a team of developers can crank out enough fiction and meaningful content to satisfy three hundred thousand people playing the game. I enjoy reading books, and sometimes it takes me only three or four hours to read a book, while at the same time it took that author six months to write that book. It is essential that these games support and supply the meaningful content. We have a lot of players out there, which are doing a really good job doing that. There was a bard back in beta that was putting on these shows, and the players enjoy that sort of thing. There’s a sense of community that needs to be created by the players. You don’t hear people complaining there is no role-playing in EQ, or that EQ isn’t a role-playing game. Role-playing is a conscious player decision to become a part of the world. To do that you have to suspend your disbelief and immerse yourself in your character and environment. If players are willing to do that, then you can role-play anything.”
<br><br>
That type of mindset is exactly what binds the EverQuest community together. Guilds are created with certain goals or ideals, and their contribution to enhancing the gameplay of so many others is as important as the development team’s constant additions and refinements. “Player run events and the player created community are tremendously important,” assures Gordon. “There will never be a game that can drive meaningful content as fast as people can consume it. I’ve seen people on the boards who have suggested that we go with dynamic content creation, and although it’s a good way to pour in a lot of content, at that point it’s meaningless. It turns into various ad-libs by NPC’s about keywords and item requirements that doesn’t mean anything to the player in the end. Games going forward will use a combination of dynamic content along with story-driven static content that reveals the story. In any case, it’s impossible to provide it at the rate that is going to be able to satisfy the amount of players out there. So players take it into their own hands and create their own.”
<br><br>
Player responses to in-game changes and their reactions to things good and bad have been a driving force in the continuation and expansion of the world of Norrath. It is this feedback which led to many of the changes in their first expansion, The Ruins of Kunark. “Some of the things we did with Kunark were directly related to how people were playing the game, and some of the things they liked or disliked,” Gordon explains. “One of the components of that was where we added more randomness to how loot is dropped. You find many of the places in Kunark where you have a chance to get a very good item off of a random drop. You don’t have to go in and camp the biggest, baddest named NPC to get just an acceptable weapon. Of course we still have our contextual randomness, such that loot makes sense. You’re not going to find a sword of ass kicking off of a low level cockatrice, but people can get those good items that help them along and then take on the biggest, baddest guy in the dungeon. You can go right to that guy in the dungeon to try and get the best weapon, but there’s not such a gap between the best and the next best weapon that people are forced to go on to the bigger stuff.”

Another hot topic among players was the state of camping some of the better monster groups, which certain players would do in order to progress in levels faster. The Verant team found it would discourage other players from attempting certain quests or dungeons, and those players would miss out on a great gameplay experience at the hands of a few campers. “We addressed some of the players who take the easiest, safest way to advancement without regard to how much ‘fun’ that is,” he notes. “They might sit there and camp a single mob and kill them every ten minutes, then get upset at how boring it was to do that, and when told to try something else reply its faster to level that way. So they make the conscious decision to be bored in order to have the faster advancement. What happens is when these groups go into the game and start doing this it kind of drags everything to a halt. We like them to move through the dungeon, going from point A to point B in order to ‘do’ the dungeon, but you get that group who stop in a certain point and start camping and it basically clogs everything up. Now you have a group coming through trying to do the dungeon, and they have to stop because of these people who only want fast advancement. So we’ve had to make some adjustments to the game to encourage people to play in the manner which is more fun as described by the players at large to be things they have found fun.”
<br><br>
All of these changes and ideas spawn from the voices of the players themselves, as they post their thoughts on the message boards. Listening to the players is critical to balancing the game to not take anything away from players, and to ensure and encourage their continued support and feedback. “Nobody comes onto the boards and says ‘Wow! I had so much fun playing last night! We sat there and camped this guy who spawned every ten minutes and we stayed for twelve hours!’ They’ve never posted that. What they post is ‘Wow! We had this awesome group and we were fighting our way through this dungeon when all of this stuff came flying at us! We fought for our lives and we almost died if it weren’t for our Enchanter who … ‘ that’s the excitement. That’s what they explain. So it’s what we try to encourage, because we want people to have fun. So we incorporated some of that into the Kunark design to encourage that. We now have one-way dungeons that you go in and can’t get back out of the same way so we don’t have people standing there pulling creatures to the zone, because it the easiest, fastest way to level and not known to be a lot of fun. I think it worked out very well with Kunark, and I expect we’ve taken it to a new level in Velious.”

<img src="http://con.xrgaming.net/gfx/verant/custserv1.jpg" width=250 align=left>Even though the players do not know the entirety of what goes on behind the scenes at Verant, it sometimes feels to the developers that the players are reading their minds. Players constantly pool their ideas and a suggestion that is already planned or implemented comes from the voices of the players. “I saw on the boards the other day a suggestion for a creature type that had already made it into Velious,” Gordon relates. “Even though it was suggested after we had put it in, it’s a good example. The players who take the time and put their suggestions on the boards are an invaluable tool to us. We’ve said it before that it doesn’t always represent the majority of opinions in some cases, but they still have good ideas. If we put those good ideas that gain a lot of player support together, then we’ll put it in. These epic quests that have been recently put in for all the classes are a result of some of those good ideas for what those weapons should do. I’m not talking about stats or value, but how they should look and what types. Though it might not turn out to be how the majority may have thought about it, we think it is something that the majority will find and think it’s cool. We look for good ideas out there, and it doesn’t matter how many people are posting behind that topic because if it’s a good idea we’ll look into putting it into the game. We can never have enough good ideas, and our players are an asset in that.”

With the new generation of RPG’s set to wash over us, many of them, including Vampire: The Masquerade and the upcoming Neverwinter Nights allow the players to control the course of an adventure, and actually perform NPC tasks or create conversations within the game world. Is it possible for EQ players to create their own quests or adventures? “We find the ability to control an NPC for dialog and interaction very intriguing,” nods Gordon. “There is a whole lot of background going on behind something like that. Unfortunately we need to start at the lowest common denominator and work our way up. What is the worst thing that could happen with the least amount of ability we could give to the players? If we allow players to control the world in that manner, and find it acceptable, what can we grant them to take them to the next level? What then is the next worst thing that could happen with that level of ability? It’s something that needs to be designed from the ground up to make letting players make their own NPC’s and use our system to setup their own quests and equip them, it’s a huge balance issue. It’s not something possible we can do with EQ. In the future it’s definitely something we can do, and is very intriguing. The more tools we can provide players to generate content to do so the better. How do we address favortism, what avenues are there to be exploited, I have faith that we’d have players who would setup bazaars, or poetry readers, or even having guilds setup a game of hide and seek. I’ve even seen two guilds get together and use a guild war and act as NPC’s. For those people I’d love to give all the power that we have. But there is that small amount of people who would abuse that. We need to make sure we can maintain the integrity of that.”

With Scars of Velious on the horizon, the entire aura around Verant’s offices is one of excitement. “We’re doing some things in Velious that haven’t been done before,” he says excitedly, “content-wise and creature-wise; all of that. We have consistently done things in EQ that haven’t been done. We let our developers really stretch their leg on this one. From the way the entire continent of Velious is setup to individual things in there, there’s just a lot of excitement around here. We pushed the engine to new levels with Kunark, and have done the same in Velious. We’ll keep trying things we haven’t tried before, because we want everything to have it’s own feel. Wait until you see the boat to Velious, it’s something different than players have seen before. We want player to walk around the zones in awe, and not thinking it’s more of the same. We want them to find the exciting things, and be happy about finding them.”
<br><br>
But that’s not to say the remainder of the EverQuest world will remain untouched. “Aside from Velious, we have more free zones planned, and plenty of quests along with that. We’re always having events and things along those lines. As long as players are having fun, we’ll keep adding to the game.”
<br><br>
<img src="http://con.xrgaming.net/gfx/verant/artist1.jpg" width=250 align=right>Even as more content is added, Gordon assures us that all has not been achieved within the world of Norrath as it exists now. “There are a number of quests on the Plane of Sky that have yet to be completed,” says Gordon, smiling. “There are a number of weapons for instance there that I know that no players have. Somebody recently listed all the weapons for each class and there are at least three missing which are in the Plane of Sky. We keep an eye on the spoiler sites out there, and sometimes find it easier to look up a particular item on them than anywhere else. We’re always putting new content into the game, rarely does a patch go by without a handful of additional quests or items. We don’t always tell players when that goes in. That NPC you haven’t hailed since you were a level three newbie and didn’t reply to you just might be talking now. When we put the Fiery Avenger quest back in it took almost two weeks for people to find where it was. If we hadn’t clued them into the fact we had put it in it probably still wouldn’t be found.”
<br><br>
So what about the players who seek these elusive items? Do they constantly badger him into revealing any secrets? “I don’t see many requests for spoilers anymore,” he shrugs. “There is a wealth of sites out there now, where they pool their knowledge and post spoilers. Plenty of sites refuse to post spoilers on their boards, but it is nice that there is a separation between the news and information sites and the spoiler sites so players aren’t accidentally exposed to the things they don’t necessarily want. It’s one thing to have that information out there, and it’s another to present it to them in a form which they may not be ready for. So I’m happy there are news sites out there refraining from spoilers, and even though we aren’t fond of spoilers the information is out there. There’s just so much information available now that if someone wants to get that knowledge they can. It’s not something that we answer, and the majority of the readers on the boards don’t seem really interested in seeing that stuff posted anyway.”

Gordon’s PC proudly displayed the popular SETI program, and it’s only right that it should. He is out there listening and understanding the players who greatly outnumber his humble efforts. It is that effort above all else which truly distinguishes him among the players. Although he has moved on to bigger and better responsibilities with Verant, the respect and admiration of the hundreds of thousand of players remain with him.
<br><br>
I would like to personally thank Brad and Gordon for their time and hospitality, and wish them all the best for the future of EverQuest. -Atomic
