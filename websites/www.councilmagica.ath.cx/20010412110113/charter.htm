  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CHARTER OF COUNCIL 
    MAGICA</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the twenty-third day of the 
    fifth month of the new millennium, a group of friends sharing like ideals 
    allied power to conquer those who would look to harm them. Council Magica 
    was born of that friendship, and what was to follow is, to this day, their 
    legacy… </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Council is based on the virtue 
    of honor, for those without have no place within the embracing arms that enfold 
    the Council. Without honor, there can be no trust…without trust, there can 
    be no Council. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is on the basis of trust that 
    the Council is governed, placing in ruling positions those trusted, respected, 
    and above all, loved. Should any of the members of the Council have a problem 
    of any kind, they should feel free to bring it to the attention of any officer 
    within the Council. The guild leader, Manthion Tastran is the father of the 
    Council. All beneath him are brothers and sisters of the Council. The Council 
    is more than an allegiance of convenience. More than a bond between friends. 
    Greater than the sum of her members. The Council is family.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As with any family, certain rules 
    and laws must be placed and enforced to ensure the smooth function and operation 
    of it's self. These laws are in place for the good of the Council and her 
    members.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. HONOR is the primary ideal driving 
    the Council. Any member found cheating, stealing or otherwise swindling any 
    other in the lands of Norrath, will be summarily dealt with by the ruling 
    body of the Council. Only one warning will be issued for any cheat or swindler 
    within the Council. After that, removal will take place.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. Any member found to be dishonoring 
    the guild will be summarily dealt with by the ruling body of the Council. 
    This includes all from tarnishing the image of the Council, to misrepresenting 
    the intentions of the Council to others. As a member of the Council, it is 
    your job to protect the image, reputation, and soul of the Council with your 
    every action.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Any and all officers of the 
    Council will have the power to allow others access to the greatness that is 
    Council Magica. All new members will go through a 30 day trial period during 
    which time it is their own responsibility to get acquainted with the Council 
    and her members. At the end of the trial, a vote will be held among the officers 
    of the Council. It requires a 51% positive vote for acceptance of the pledge 
    into full membership.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. In the constant quest to maintain 
    the image of the Council, no member will knowingly steal kills from any other 
    in Norrath. This promotes ire toward the Council and will not be tolerated. 
    This falls in the same category as cheating. One warning will be issued. Then 
    removal will be implemented.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. Begging will not be tolerated 
    within the hallowed halls of Council Magica. We are not here to help one attain 
    greatness, but rather to become great with the members' efforts. Whether it 
    be wealth or experience one is after, aid may be offered, even requested, 
    but in no way will one beg such assistance from another member of the Council. 
    Should an instance of such behavior arise, it should be immediately reported 
    to an officer so it may be dealth with. Two warnings will be given for this 
    offense. Afterwards, removal will be the punishment. If one is not willing 
    to do something for oneself, how can they expect the aid of the Council? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 6. Respect is another attribute 
    of Council members. We treat our brothers and sisters of the Council as we 
    would our own families. Constant swearing, demeaning or other hurtful remarks 
    that would offend the Council will be summarily dealth with. This could result 
    in probation to outright expulsion from the Council. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7. Any member leaving the guild 
    must be interviewed by an officer before being readmitted to the ranks of 
    the Council. Should an officer leave, their status shall not be restored upon 
    re-entry into the Council, as quitters tend to make poor leaders. Should one 
    leave twice, then readmittance will not be possible.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8. In order to remove a member 
    from the guild, there must be a vote taken among the present officers to determine 
    if the offense is worthy of expulsion.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9. There will be a council meeting 
    the last day of every month beginning at 7pm CST in Erudin. All who are able 
    are expected to attend. </font></p>
