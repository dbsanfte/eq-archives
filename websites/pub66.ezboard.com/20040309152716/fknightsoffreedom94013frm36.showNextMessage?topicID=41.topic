6/20/02:<br>
Other night Dami, Dasi, Alegura, myself and two druids that happened to be in Kael decided to head to the bank and kill some mobs for exp and fun. While we were there a group of SR members came to the bank area and asked that we hold pulls while they pulled a mob from the Tormax area just up past the bank. We obliged and watched what some of the best players on the server do best. We assisted this group in killing the Mob that was singled out of about 30 very large, very red giants. After they were finished they kindly buffed us with Aego. As they were getting ready to leave a Dwarf warrior that was pulling single mobs up past us on the ramp to kill them with his cleric friend had a bad pull and aggroed Noble Helsen. SR helped us to drop him and then headed out. <br>
<br>
Shortly after resuming pulling I accidentally aggroed one of the lvl 55 Drakkel Direwolves and I proceeded to take a nap. I layed there for what I felt was long enough for these 8 dogs to reset at their bind spots(These were leftovers from the SR pull and were late in getting back home to guarding the ice). I then stood up and ran back to the group and got ready to pull another giant. Suddenly I see a couple of these dogs running towards us in their normal pathing (which is messed up). I Feigned death as fast as I could but the mobs continued to rush the rest of the group. This was not gonna be pretty and we all knew it. The Druid immediately started casting Succor and someone else said EVAC! I jumped up immediately and ran to the group. By this time Dami had taken aggro on one or two of the mobs and ran directly to the middle of the bank area. He unselfishly gave his life to save the rest of us from a certain death. Thanks to him we were able to be succored to the EW Zone and proceed to make a speedy CR of our fallen Hero.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the selfless act Dami. I am very happy to stand by you any day in combat. I know very well you have my back bro. (sub/wit=Aerrenn)<br>

<br>
6/20/02:<br>
The Shield of Nobility is hereby awarded to Dami Valorton and to Amazine for their help in the acquisition of a Key to Charisis for Loralis. Dami's generosity, both for including Loralis in the roll for the Fang of Xalgoz and for giving it to him when he himself won it, was unexpected and unasked for, and an act far above and beyond the code. Amazine then helped Loralis camp the Chancellor of Di'Zok, refusing to roll and insisting that Loralis take the Jade Chodikai Prod since he already had the fang. Again, an inspiring act of generosity.These actions prove these individuals as more than just Knights. Congratulations on your awards! (Sub=Charcoth) <br>

Awarded on 10-18-00, at lvl 45, for saving the life of Aerren Evilslayer.<br>
<br>
I would like to hereby officially submit for consideration of and award to be given to Dami Valorton. (You might know him) hehe. The other night we were fighting deep in the dungeon of Kaesora. I have only been there a couple of times and had no real understanding of the way to the zone. I believe it was getting late so we decided to get out for the night. Dami told me that he would lead me to the zone. After putting on invis to undead we made our way past the undead. On the way out Dami was attacked by a ravener that saw through his invis and a train of spiders and undead ensued. We made it almost all the way out and I was getting stunned heavily and saw that my life was leaving me. As I looked up a short way to the last few feet of pathway to the zone I was going down when I see Dami reach over and lay hands on me undoubtedly saving my life. I was then able to make it safely to the zone along with Dami. His kind act spared me from dying. (sub / wit: Aerren Evilslayer)<br>

<br>
Awarded on 10 -17-00, for recovering Aetheldari's corpse from the third floor deep in Kaesora.<br>
<br>
Aerren, Aetheldar, Dami and Dasi were grouped in Kaesora. At the Hungered Ravener they were jumped by several undead minions of Xalgos and Warders and Spectral Guardians. A long and fierce battle raged. Dasi fell in the middle of the fight; her mana was nearly gone. After beating down the undead to only 2 left, Dami could not hold on any longer and fell also. Aerren and Aetheldar continued the battle to within pixels of death and were Victorious! They retreated to a dead end hallway and attempted to recover, and were attacked by another Warder but defeated it. They knew they could not survive there just the two of them. <br>
<br>
The group devised a plan of escape and corpse recovery for the members. Aetheldar and Aerren would Invis to the undead. Aerren would grab Dami's corps and carry it. Knowing that the Spiders near the surface would see through UI and attack, Aetheldar would run ahead and clear a path for Aerren by pulling the spiders along with him as he attempted to make it to the zone. Aerren would then have a clear path to put Dami's corpse in a safe spot on the second lvl were Dasi could drop down for a resuscitation on it. <br>
<br>
The Plan worked beautifully, however Aetheldar got stunned up top and fell into a pit putting him back on the bottom lvl. Aerren made it untouched to the safe area at the left drop from the zone. Dasi resuscitated Dami whom then recovered. Aerren, Dasi and Dami cleaned out the spiders and Dami used UI to recover Dasi's corpse from the Hungered Ravener area. The three then attempted to locate Aetheldar who was bound in the Arena zone.<br>
<br>
Things seemed hopeless as Aetheldar's corps could not be found. Dami jumped down a pit in an attempt to pull up Aeth's corpse however it could not be located. Dami died near the zone while trying to escape as a result. Several hours later Aethaldar arrived back at Kaesora and Dami was able to use a chipped bone rod to get a direction on Aeth's corpse. Mortigan, Ulvick and Rohwin also arrived to help. Dami gathered the group in a safe spot and Jumped into the pit. Dami found aeth's corpse and managed to drag it out from behind the library, while being hit by Warders and several spectral. Dami pulled Aetheldar's corpse up to the spider room where he dropped it off and ran for the zone. Dami fell to his death short of the zone. The undead and spiders left the area and Aetheldar was able to recover his belongings. (sub / wit Dasi, Aerren, Mortigan, Rohwin, Ulvick and Aetheldar)<br>

Awarded on 6-28-00, at lvl 37, for saving the life of Aerren Evilslayer. <br>
<br>
While in Mistmoore Dami and Aerren were making an escape from the jail to the zone. At the Grave Yard entrance they encountered a hoard of Ushers and other higher Mobs returning from the zone. The onslaught stunned Aerren at the gorge and was zapping his life quickly. Aerren knew his LoH was expired with one bubble of health left he though he was a goner. Dami Valorton (being beat on himself) returned to Aerren and expended his LoH undoubtedly saving the life of Aerren Evilslayer and provided him enough time to make it to the zone. Both the Knights lived to fight again. Dami did not feel he put himself in serious danger. (Sub &amp; wit: Aerren Evilslayer.)<br>
