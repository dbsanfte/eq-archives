Let me say I'm AWARE of that up front.  <br>
<br>
I am quite happy gallivanting about Norrath touting my superior talents, as are my Dark Brothers and Sisters here in the Arrows.  I THINK I'm speaking for all of us, (Athame, Osgoode, Fariarya) when I say that we revel in our ability to go virtually anywhere and do anything.  We AMAZE even ourselves at our power at doing things alone.  And in a group, we bask in the glory of playing healer, rezzer, mezzer, and group buffer.  (<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Sick of me yet? hehe)  But it has a dark side... it can go too far, and we generally hate each other for it.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong.  Arrow Necromancers are ARROWS through and through and I'm not talking about them.  And there are exceptions to the rule but in general... NECROMANCERS ARE AWFUL!  Here's my rant:<br>
<br>
I'm duoing with a wizzy aquaintance in PoN the other day, as I have done before, and he mentions that another Necromancer friend of his is on the way.  This NEC arrives and we group and he's not friendly so neither am I and we are generally pretending that the other is not there.  [NOTE: I know you other NECs know what I'm talking about.  For those of you who don't... you know how when two Pallys group up and they are like dogs who inspect and sniff each other and chat amicably about what the other one is carrying/wearing?  Well, this is the EXACT OPPOSITE, a common necro practice where you don't want to know.]  Anyway, during battle, this necromancer keeps spaming:<br>
<br>
&quot;[target] is slowed.&quot;  He says it EVERY time.<br>
<br>
We are fighting treants and ravens, not undead, so I'm not sure what's going on behind his curtain.  So finally, both as an ice breaker and curiosity, I say &quot;Say,[his name], how is it that you are slowing?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; he asks.<br>
<br>
&quot;I mean, what is it you are using that slows?&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Darkness.  What else would I use?&quot;<br>
<br>
Okay, so I should have just let it go right there.  He's a moron and is embarassing my class wherever he goes.  But I'm a Necromancer and I can't let it go.  Plus, I can't ignore the sarcasm.  I hate sarcasm.  Sarcasm, as a tool, is mine and mine alone to dispense.  (Okay, and Del's too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   )<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh!&quot; I say. &quot;haha I thought you had a clickable item or something that was really 'slowing' the mob, like a chanter does.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;I AM slowing them.  Darkness is a slow.&quot;<br>
<br>
I ponder.  It's a silly technicality.  But he really SHOULD be educated on this.  I would be doing him a favor.  But if I say something he's not going to get it.  And I'll look preachy.  And we're Necromancers so we'll stand here hating each other in silence.  What good will come of that?  Well, evidenly I'm a preachy, know-it-all Necromancer, because I can't help myself.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Well, when people say they want a &quot;slower&quot; in their group, they mean they want a chanter or a shammy.  Those classes 'slow' the mob.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; he says.  &quot;Darkness is a dot.  And it slows too.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;heheh,&quot;  I say...  <br>
<br>
Did you see that?  I'm trying that tactic where I start the sentence with &quot;heheh&quot; in an effort to lighten the mood and take away from the condecending nature of what I'm about to say.  However, I have forgotten that MY &quot;heheh&quot; does not nullify the condecending nature, but AMPLIFIES the condecendingness, underlines it, puts it in bold caps and screams &quot;YOU'RE #@!<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ing STUPID!&quot;<br>
<br>
I say, &quot;heheh, the 'slowed' message is generally done by a class that slows down the creatures attack.'<br>
<br>
&quot;That's what I'm doing.  The mob slows down.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, Darkness is generally referred to as a snare.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We don't snare.&quot; he says.  <br>
<br>
This is pointless.  &quot;lol okay,&quot; I say.<br>
<br>
That's a fake &quot;lol&quot; right there.  No caps or punctuation.  I know it's fake.  He knows it.  The wizzy knows it.  It's gotten so cold in the chat box that his shrunken skelly pet has turned into a blue block of ice and hasn't moved an inch to chase the treant we're fighting.  He can't stand it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Snare is a druid spell,&quot; he says.  &quot;Darkness SLOWS the mob down and is doing damage.&quot;<br>
<br>
At this moment, with the treant dead.  The wizzy suddenly speaks up.  &quot;Guys, I have to go.&quot;  Imagine that!  Some huge emergency somewhere at this very moment!  <br>
<br>
This necro disbands faster than you can say &quot;Cazic.&quot;  I Gate out, hoping to miss any rude gestures that show up.<br>
<br>
Later that night... I go to EQRaids and check in on the Plane of Sky raid I've signed up for.  Lo and behold if this necromancer hasn't signed up and made 3 rants embarassing himself in front of the whole sign up.  Not to mention his attempt to do an end run around me and get dibs on the very epic piece I'm needing AND HAVE POSTED ABOUT ON THE SIGN IN SHEET ALREADY.<br>
<br>
I know, I know... the fact that I MADE this rant I have made my own point that Necromancers are an isolationist, anti social, ego-centered lot of bones who can't stand to let sleeping dogs lie.  But at least I am vindicated by our totally opposite attitudes in the EQRaids forums and everyone can see that, tho I AM an ego-centered moron myself, at least I'm not as bad as the next guy!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
I leave you with the Necromancer motto... <br>
<br>
&quot;Two Necromancers on a raid is one too many.&quot;<br>

I'm speachless.. . <br>
<br>
Cept to say Sy I been there countless times <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I've finaly realized though, that saying nothing helps noone.  I say it baldly now and than i say I'm only informing you to help.  You can look it up no need take my word.  <br>
<br>
Example Muddon and I teachinga chanter to mezz. . yeah she didn't mezz didn't know the spell even. . eheh she just nuked and mind candied. . no she didn't haste <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  we gave up after we taught her to mezz <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Didn't wanna push our luck.<br>
<br>
But in the case of more than one necro or in my case shammy in a group or raid. . it can suck.  Depending on who it is.  I bow out to the higher lvl shammy usually.  I send them a tell What are you doin'? Or better yet how can I aid you in it? As my spells are mostly lower lvl and two shammys working together can be killer.  You have no idea how many times they say nothin' or say do what you want. . mana waste, time waste. . silly in general.  so i've taken to turning down groups with a shammy already present or even a raid where two are present.  there is never really a need for more than 2 shammys on a raid. . unless you don't mind bein' the back up shammy incase on goes ld or if you don't mind playin' i can melee or i am a wizzy. . . al;so somsetimes you can spot heal for CHeals. . but mostly thats not needed with all the dr00ds and clerics.  I prefer to play my class all out doin' everything at once goin' nuts eheh otherwise wheres the fun for me? Therefor more than 2 I won't do cause I get bored eheh and 60% of shammys are higher lvl, say lvl 60 and don't need any of my help at 'tall.<br>
<br>
hmmm thats all eheheh you hit a point i get frusterated over alot honestly <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.eq-arrow-of-light.com/sigs/asyth.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A0B0E0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub66.ezboard.com/bthearrowoflightcommons.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ariaya>Ariaya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Officer of Hobbies</span><br>  Posts: 552<br> <font color=#000080>(5/26/03 3:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Necros are AWFUL!</span><hr size=1> Sytox,  that's so true! unfortunately.<br>

<br>
SLOW is SLOW: the mob attackes less frequently.<br>
SNARE is SNARE:  the mob's rate of movement is decreased.<br>
DOT is DOT:  the mob is suffering from reduction of hitpoints over time<br>
MEZ is MEZ:  the mob is unable to move or attack<br>
<br>
If a necro uses Screaming Terror on a mob, and says it is 'mezzed', it is acceptable because it fits the definition.  I can't imagine any chanter would take offense to that statement because the mob is ... mezzed!  Good heck, even Root gets the phrase 'ghetto mez' because it can take a mob out of action like a true mez, as long as the mob is far enough away that it can't do harm to anyone.<br>
<br>
If a necro is using Engulfing Darkness and says a mob is SLOWED, oops, thats shows they haven't got a clue about the spell they are using, or it's effect.  Engulfing Darkness is a SNARE-type spell, and if he claimed 'The mob has been snared and Dotted&quot; he would be more accurate in his statement.  The mob certainly isn't SLOWED because it is still beating the crud out of the tanks at the same rate as it was before the necro's spell landed.  Pfft!<br>
<br>
Take it from a SLOWER, DOTTER and a MEZZER (but not a snarer).<br>
<br>

I've taken Osgoode in search of XP, cash and booty to several zones and I'm appalled by some of the replies I've gotten looking for a group.  Sure I can appreciate a good solo session like the rest of us (wait, that didn't come out right) but I like grouping with people and to be denied the chance to earn XP and socialize (such as it is) in EQ simply based on my class really steams my clams.<br>

People think all we do is fear and DoT. They ALWAYS forget our number one source of attack....the pet. Very few people have &quot;others hits&quot; on and they DO NOT actually realize that the pet is probably outdamaging a lot of them, hehe. But, not all rests on others. A lot of our soloing is brought on by other necros, the Arseholes. They have a cocky attitude, developed by soloing, and they treat others not so well. It basically falls under the same thing as Droods. Not all druids are Droods.<br>
<br>
What I do is IF I get a group, I unmem all my dots. then ask what classes are present. If a chanter is there, say &quot;Ok, getting rid of my mezz&quot;. People are like &quot;Necros can mezz?&quot; Boom, got a new fan. If your facing undead say, &quot;Shall I slow the mobs?&quot; Also use your Tap and pact line at all times in groups. Not only are you damaging the mob, but your healing the party, that gets their attention. Later you will get group tap spells (They suck yes) but they add a little AC and health. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E6E8fA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub66.ezboard.com/bthearrowoflightcommons.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sytox>Sytox</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Frog Hater (Enough with the Hopping!)</span><br>  Posts: 658<br> <font color=#000080>(5/30/03 3:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Necros are AWFUL!</span><hr size=1> Gaaa!

Way to represent, Athame!  Slowly, over the course of the past year, I'm seeing the class get more and more respect.  Maybe it's ust that the folks I'm playing with now have been around the block a bit more.  But everything you said is right on.  Every time someone is educated about what we can do, hopefully that's one more person who will respond when a Necromancer is LFG.   <p>Sytox 60 Warlock<br>
