<br>
Targeting<br>
<br>
Use /rt to target the last person who sent you a tell. <br>
Press &lt;tab&gt; to swap to you and your previous target (and back). <br>
<br>
On raids, make a social or hotkey with /tar Arthur. Especially for MT and any enchanters. <br>
<br>
Use /tt to send a tell to the person targeted. Works on corpses! /tt Hello. Need a rez? <br>
<br>
Press r then &lt;Tab&gt; to cycle through all the tells you have recieved. <br>
<br>
If you can't target a dead mob in a wall, /target a_scarab's corpse0 then /loot it. For live ones it is 2 digits (may be /tar Spiderling01 etc) <br>
<br>
When on a raid, don't run around looking for players in the mob. To find Arthurpendrag, just type /tar art then Ctrl-I. <br>
F1 to F6 is your group, F7 is nearest PC in view, F8 is nearest mob/npc in view. Hit again to get pet. <br>
<br>
Casting<br>
Put two /cast commands in every hot key. It catches 99%+ of your fizzles. Put a /pause 1 between the casts. <br>
Use a horse. It is like FT 7. While on a horse you med while casting. Make the first line of all spell hotkeys /sit on. <br>
<br>
Channeling works by loc and skill combined. If you end up in the same spot at the end of cast as the beginning, you will cast through it. So the corner is your friend! Try this. Say, above Kaesora in FOB, go to corner, cast CH, run around building back to corner, and spell will hit! This does not prevent interrupts due to bashes or stuns. <br>
<br>
Stuns can be used to position mobs. The effect can be surprising. You will push the mob the way you are looking, so if you cast on a mob behind you, you can pull it!. Hey it IS magic! <br>
<br>
Train in a magic skill by [/cast 1] [/pause 40, cast 1][/pause 40, cast 1]. Set spell 1 to a low level spell and cast on yourself while awaiting a port etc. Change the &quot;40&quot; to 10 times the spell refresh time. <br>
<br>
You can tell if atone worked on a mob by doing /assist Also watch to see if it turns away from you to default direction (usu. North) <br>
<br>
To cast fast after running, do a quick left/right before casting. This also helps cast through spells when being hit, if you are not in a corner. <br>
<br>
If you zone with HP lower than your hp from gear, you lose all your buffs. <br>
<br>
Healing a pet generates no aggro. <br>
<br>
Spells<br>
<br>
Cure disease will cure slow. Cure poison will cure Tash. <br>
<br>
Use HP buff (Courage, Valor, etc) as a heal. Use Heroic Bond (group HP buff) as a group heal. <br>
<br>
Don't use Celestial Healing on mobs that ae dispel - 'cause it gets dispelled. <br>
<br>
Spells always work on yourself. Practice evocation by chain blasting a weak nuke on yourself (via hotkey) while awaiting a transport etc. <br>
<br>
Arrow key flips through spell book pages. <br>
<br>
Keyboard<br>
<br>
Use your keyboard as much as possible. If speed counts and lag is heavy, keyboard saves you. <br>
<br>
Use /book 1, /book 3, etc to open your spell book to right page. <br>
<br>
You can map you arrow movement keys to, say, e-d-f-s so you can move with your left hand. <br>
<br>
Remap attack to ` or similar so you wont type it to an NPC by mistake. <br>
<br>
Remap spellbook to b and reply to r. <br>
<br>
/doability # or /do # will perform ability. 7 is for first melee ability. You can thus add bash, taunt, and LH to a hot key. <br>
<br>
Disable attack on assist by typing /assist off <br>
<br>
/clear will clear you default window. <br>
<br>
Shift PgUp/PgDn scrolls the main chat up a page. Shift and Up/Down cycles through messages you have typed. Shift and number turns to that page of hotkey bank. <br>
<br>
U opens doors in front of you <br>
<br>
Rezing<br>
If a corpse is in a wall or you cant see it, type /target &lt;NAME&gt; to target the corpse. Then if withing 50 ft, you can /corpse it out of the wall. If the player is in the area, type /target &lt;NAME'&gt;. Adding the apostraphe avoids the player who may be right next to you. <br>
<br>
Make a corpse button with /corpse. (Here's the good part) Now make 4 more lines saying /pause 5, /corpse. It will stick to you like glue! <br>
<br>
If someone else has the corpse targeted, assist them (/ass) <br>
/loot will let you loot your corpse if you cant seem to right click it. Also works on horse <br>
<br>
Two corpses to drag? Make a hotkey [/tar Arthur][/corpse ][/tar Lance] [/corpse] and drag them in one go. <br>
<br>
Oops I looted all my stuff (or looted an empty corpse) and forgot to rez? Just wait 5 minutes or /q out. Your corpse will be empty but will still be there. <br>
<br>
You can rez someone twice. No exp, but can bring them back. <br>
<br>
Camping out<br>
<br>
If a fight is going sour, log off or &quot;camp out&quot; Find a safe spot (where you think no mobs will pop without a pull), hit DA and camp. Fasted way is (Ctrl-S, Ctrl-X) You will go to the bottom of mobs aggro list. Get a tank to hit any mobs or they will come back and ruin you camp during last 12 sec. If an Enchanter casts Rune on you, you may even survive the 12 seconds of beating (as this absorbs the blows without you standing). <br>
<br>
If you Ctrl-Q or /quit, DA goes off and you become an NPC for 30 sec. You will fight and heal yourself and wander about. You may die in a strange spot or camp out in a strange spot. But this can be the right choice. <br>
If a Rez'er dies, rez them mid battle, but do not accept (or reject) the rez. Accept it when mobs have cleared. <br>
<br>
Your root can last longer than 30 sec to camp. Camping clears aggro. So you can root, run, camp, repeat to sneak into some dungeons (e.g. Kaesora) <br>
<br>
If you will drown and will not survive /q out. You will arrive (somewhere) with a full bar of air. <br>
<br>
Other<br>
<br>
Sell an item with 1 charge left of 10 to a vendor. Buy it back and it will have 10 charges. Does not save you money but is easier. <br>
If you need a forge in Felwithe, there is an invisible one outside the bank. Walk straight out of bank, 5 steps, hit a wall, turn left, walk 2 steps, hit wall, look up and click. <br>
<br>
Practice swimming in a pool against a wall with head up. Can go afk. You may die so do this before level 10 <br>
<br>
Sitting causes aggro. You can ping pong a mob between you and your tanks by sitting and standing. <br>
<br>
A dropped sword points North. <br>
<br>
With DA/DB you can save yourself from drowning, jump from high places, and even jump into the Hole from Paineel (Jump, then zone, then press DA while in the air after zone) <br>
<br>
With DA/DB you will not teleport. Get Bestow DA on a druid/wizzy to turn a teleport into a group TL. <br>
<br>
Holding down ALT with you mouse over an open bag or merchant window will show the names of all the goods. <br>
<br>
All commands can be abbreviated to 2 or 3 characters. (/ta is tap not target) <br>
CTRL on a stack picks up one. SHIFT on a stack picks up (or sells) all. <br>
<br>
Holding both mouse buttons makes you run. <br>
<br>
NumLock is autorun <br>
<br>
Strafe running is faster, but hard to steer. This is particularly helpful when running from mobs. CTRL + left/right + forward. Also good when overweight. <br>
<br>
Best price is at cha 105 or better. <br>
<br>
Use &quot;mouse-look&quot; steering to swim. <br>
<br>
Other camera views can help. Over head (first F9) lowers lag (good in Bazaar). Use 4th or 5th view to swim though gap into the Hole. <br>
<br>
Press F10 then - to get a nice screen shot. Press f10 when following in a safe zone to enjoy the view. <br>
<br>
You can make hotkeys of inventory slots (good for clickable items) <br>
<br>
When meleeing, there is a red box around your name. <br>
<br>
Large sewing kits make great backpacks since they hold 8 giant items. <br>
<br>
Avoid faction hits by atoning, fd'ing, zoning, or /q before the mob dies. <br>
<br>
Use instaclick items to reset your spell gems faster.<br>
<br>
Spam pre-nerf CoS after being fd'd to clear aggro (on some mobs).<br>
<br>
Use g-flux to your advantage to reach high and unreachable areas.<br>
<br>
If you think you have just enough mana left to cast a given spell, but it says you have insufficient mana, try this:<br>
<br>
Use an insta-click item (jboots are good) and try casting again. If you really were just at that point, your spell will cast.<br>
<br>
The reason for this is that insta-clicking the jboots forces the server to update the client with your mana information (even though you used none), where normally it might take a few more seconds for the client to realize you have enough mana to cast the spell.<br>
<br>
/pause &lt;time period&gt; MUST be before a command and not after a command FYI<br>
<br>
There is a way to put more commands onto the same line :~<br>
<br>
Sence Heading (witout the RSI, assuming Sence heading is #1 in the abilities macro boxes).<br>
<br>
<br>
/doability 1<br>
/pause 25,/doability 1<br>
/pause 25,/doability 1<br>
/pause 25,/doability 1<br>
/pause 25,/doability 1<br>
<br>
======== Other info =================<br>
<br>
Pauses in Social Batches<br>
<br>
You may now enter pauses in social batches with the /pause command. /pause takes an argument from 1 to 600 (600 = One minute), with the value being equal to the number of tenths of seconds (i.e. /pause 100 will yield a 10 second pause). <br>
<br>
For example, a social consisting of:<br>
<br>
/sit off<br>
/cast 1<br>
/pause 100<br>
/sit on<br>
<br>
...would cause you to stand up, cast the spell in slot 1, wait 10 seconds after you've STARTED casting the spell, and sit down.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, you can also use the /pause command on the same line as another social by separating the commands with a comma. Even though the pause command is specified first, it is executed AFTER the command on the same line.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
<br>
/sit off<br>
/pause 100,/cast 1<br>
/sit on<br>
<br>
...would have the same effect as the example above. It is important to note that the comma can only be used to separate a /pause command from another, and MUST be specified first on the line.<br>
<br>
