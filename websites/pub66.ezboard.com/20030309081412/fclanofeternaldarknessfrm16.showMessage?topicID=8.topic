<br>
When I first arrived in Germany I was in a horribly depressed state<br>
my wife had just left me<br>
she was @#%$ another man<br>
ANOTHER MAN<br>
my heart and ego could not bear it<br>
I was crushed<br>
pulverized <br>
alone<br>
I sunk into a sucking funk<br>
I stopped eating<br>
lost a lot of weight<br>
I just didn't care for food<br>
food wouldn't make that feeling in my stomach go away<br>
that twisting churning feeling <br>
spinning me into hopelessness<br>
I briefly considered escaping<br>
seriously considered cashing in my chips just saying @#%$ it<br>
but instead <br>
instead I went to Germany for a four year vacation<br>
I had to find another place to stay for awhile<br>
remain distracted for a couple years<br>
get my @#%$ together and hopefully get laid<br>
yeah that would be good<br>
I had to forget about the incidents that almost robbed me of my soul (if I have a soul) <br>
who knows <br>
who cares <br>
anyway there I was<br>
<br>
Germany<br>
<br>
Ah Germany smack dab in the middle of Europe <br>
full of all kinds of @#%$ I only once read about<br>
I remember my first adventure in a big city<br>
Frankfurt it was<br>
and it was there that I ran into an old friend <br>
Watkins<br>
a fat computer guy that I knew from someplace else<br>
when I was that other person<br>
and I was really pretty surprised to see him <br>
and he was really surprised to see me as well<br>
and the first thing he said was<br>
-@#%$ man you've lost a lot of weight<br>
and I said I know I know and I really didn't know what else to say to that<br>
so I had to explain my shitty predicament <br>
and old friend Watkins knew just what I needed<br>
a legal hooker from a hooker hotel<br>
or so he told me<br>
and I wasn't sure if that were true or not<br>
but I was ready to go and see the sights I hadn't seen yet so off I went into exciting Frankfurt to visit these legended whore hotels.<br>
<br>
So away by U-bahn we rode underground <br>
I noticed to ride the U-bahn there were no turnstiles to go through<br>
no person to check your ticket<br>
you were really just pretty much on your honor to buy a ticket<br>
so if you didn't want to buy a ticket or maybe didn't have enough money left after a dozen or so beers to buy a ticket<br>
chances were you could ride the U-bahns for free <br>
sans ticket<br>
and this to me seemed pretty cool<br>
and I must admit that I did do this quite often<br>
I never got caught but I had friends that did get caught occasionally by the secret plainclothes U-bahn police <br>
they had to pay a 60DM fine or else be taken away by the unfriendly Politzei waiting in the stations<br>
if you did not come peacefully they'd whack you on the head with these big rubber truncheons that would bounce on your head three times for every swing those deadly serious Politzei swung<br>
Yes the ricochet<br>
WHACK WHACK WHACK<br>
it seemed quite unpleasant to those being so clobbered because they would shout in pain<br>
and make faces and scream and holler and bleed a lot<br>
but anyway <br>
chances were you wouldn't get caught not paying to ride the U-bahns so we took our chances now and then<br>
<br>
The Frankfurt Hauptbanhof was where the subways took us<br>
it was the main train station and I must admit I was very impressed with how massive and cool looking this place was<br>
how would an idiot like me describe the architecture?<br>
Baroque cathedralesque 19th century huge with giant neon Marlboro signs<br>
and little nooks hiding Pizza Huts<br>
book stores<br>
McDonald's<br>
all full of EurosTurksAmericansAfricansAsians <br>
standing around at the fruit stands or the big non eletronic arrival boards  <br>
that whirred and clicked<br>
flipping cards like those old digital clocks all being reset at once<br>
while loudspeakers announced things in GermanFrenchEnglish<br>
people argued at a Kabob stand nearby or bought cigarettes at the cigarette shops <br>
you could smoke wherever you pleased and most did<br>
there were heroin junkies wherever you looked<br>
they fascinated me the way they tried to walk and sleep at the same time<br>
the way they used walls and pillars to support themselves as they attempted this sincere stumbling<br>
the way they nodded out and staggered on trying to appear sober and straight<br>
while obliviously shuffle stepping into oncoming traffic like misguided zombies  <br>
and the soccer hooligans who laughed and messed with them and occasionally gave 'em a smoke<br>
yeah I was pretty amazed by the Frankfurt Hauptbanhof<br>
pretty amazed at life's many varieties on display <br>
and I thought <br>
Wow <br>
big European city here I am here I am and @#%$ if I don't belong here<br>
why didn't my mother marry another European and stay in Europe instead of raising me in @#%$ Oklahoma<br>
the place where I never belonged<br>
oh well too late who cares<br>
because here I was now in the smoke and neon of Frankfurt <br>
and I knew I must be far from home<br>
and my ally and friend Watkins was with me and told me that all was good<br>
because I was on my way to the Red Light District to visit the fabled hooker hotels<br>
so off we went to the place where the lights were red and conveniently enough quite close to the main train station <br>
<br>
So down some escalators we went<br>
then walk walk walk we did <br>
past the vendors and passport photo booths and access tunnels to the U-bahns which went in every direction<br>
past crowds of people of every description <br>
speaking every describable language but especially German<br>
to other escalators where junkie beggars begged<br>
then up up up into the heart of Frankfurt wherein adventure lurked<br>
<br>
I felt so alive<br>
<br>
So down these nifty old flatblocks we walked until we came to a shop <br>
called Dr Mueller's Sex Shop<br>
it was full of porno and videos <br>
and we knew me must be getting near the land of the red light <br>
so we took a seedy left and turn and sure enough we were there <br>
and there were many bars with eastern European women standing at the doors trying to lure us in<br>
my friend fat Watkins was sure that a lady at one of the bar doors luring ANY AND ALL wanted ONLY HIM<br>
but I was not so sure and wanted to keep going<br>
but in we went because Watkins was sure this broken English speaking Czech lady had a special lust just for him<br>
so in we went to a DARK EMPTY bar<br>
with this really butch bartender lady unsmiling behind the counter<br>
Watkins and I sat down at this bar and ordered a couple beers <br>
they were warm <br>
Pilsner beer should never be warm<br>
and this hooker lady sat down with Watkins and asked for a drink which he bought for 40 marks which is REALLY STUPID EXPENSIVE if you didn't already know<br>
indeed that is major buckage<br>
and this overmade old lady started rubbing his thigh <br>
Watkins leered like the perv he is<br>
must have thought he was in Heaven<br>
while I sat and drank my warm beer feeling not too comfortable<br>
when an old lady<br>
older than my mom <br>
came and sat at the bar next to me and tried to make small talk<br>
I really didn't want to talk to her but I did <br>
the gruff bartender lady told me to buy gramma a drink<br>
so I asked how much for a drink for ol' gramma but this pushy broad was already pouring granny a glass of syrupy @#%$<br>
she sets it on the bar and says 40 marks <br>
I said @#%$ NO I DIDN'T SAY I WAS BUYING ANYONE A DRINK!!<br>
but this butch bartender persisted and said again 40 marks in a growl <br>
she sounded quite nasty <br>
but I remained firm in my indignance<br>
HELL NO MY MOTHER WAS YOUNGER AND BETTER LOOKING AND I HAVE NO DESIRE TO SLEEP WITH MY MOM SO WHY SHOULD I PAY 40 MARKS TO BUY THIS OLD BAG A DRINK??<br>
I was mad enough to punch the dyke <br>
so I finished my warm beer in two quick gulps and waited outside while Watkins did his thing<br>
he joined me a short while later<br>
he told me about his experience with this hooker <br>
all lies of course <br>
and I wasn't impressed with what he had to say anyway because who would want to spend money like that<br>
anyway not me<br>
those women were old and I was not yet quite that desperate and I wasn't going to @#%$ the first old whore that put her hand on my crotch<br>
I wanted to see more<br>
so we started going to all the buildings with the red lights in the windows<br>
<br>
The first one we entered was old old old<br>
it smelled like pee<br>
people must have pissed in the hallways for decades<br>
it was awful and yet we started going up these rickety old twisty stairs to see the prostitutes prostitutes wah hoo hookers<br>
let's go see what this is all about<br>
the first girl I saw was NOT SO BAD<br>
she was semi young and semi firm <br>
and I was really semi surprised she was a prostitute not ever having seen a pretty prostitute or even a prostitute at all twenty minutes before <br>
and yet there she was a somewhat attractive hooker<br>
but there were more to see and I had ample Deutchemarks in my pocket reserved for the prettiest hooker in Frankfurt<br>
so I wandered on wandered on wandered down the dimly lit halls of what must have formerly been a hotel a century or so ago<br>
past doors both closed and open<br>
the open ones having ladies displaying their wares in various states of undress<br>
in various states of decay or presentability<br>
past various signs that stated all women displayed had been inspected by the government and were suitable to sex upon<br>
past shady men in raincoats and hats although it was neither cold nor raining outside<br>
past drunken American soldiers whose slang I could easily understand and laugh with<br>
past rooms with dildos and big rubber fists on the walls<br>
past rooms with ladies watching televisions bored in their bras and corsets<br>
past groups of Turkish men arguing or laughing in their rough macho language through thick clouds of cigarette smoke or the secret sweet wisps of Turkish hashish<br>
<br>
And the stairs O' Jesus those rickety winding stairs always taking us higher to the next floor of earthy delights for a price<br>
I noticed the higher you climbed the dirtier and less attractive and more aggressive the prostitutes became<br>
one big old African lady who called herself Gorilla Woman manhandled my pal Watkins <br>
grabbed him with her thick arms<br>
pulled him to her and promised all he did or didn't want for a carton of American cigarettes<br>
<br>
I did all I could to avoid the attentions of these aggressive types <br>
I knew in my heart I would not be able to perform for these scary ones<br>
maybe I could at another place but this hotel smelled too much like pee and body odor<br>
I wanted to go <br>
so down the stairs we stumbled<br>
if I hadn't mentioned it yet let me state now I was drinking and getting all the more drunkish<br>
beer in hand adventure all the way<br>
so the stairs were somewhat of a challenge <br>
but I was having fun of sorts<br>
so on we strolled to the place next door or across the street <br>
which seemed very much like the place before<br>
a few girls were quite alright but they all seemed to have this rough edge about them<br>
I didn't want to sleep with a lady tougher than me so we kept exploring a few other spots <br>
then I met some American GI's outside who told me that where I needed to go was to the MARBLE PALACE <br>
and the MARBLE PALACE was just right there and just as they were saying this a man ran past with blood pouring from his head<br>
while behind him ran two Turks<br>
one with a broken cue stick shouting what I expect were Turkish curses<br>
and I thought WOW<br>
<br>
Then off to the MARBLE PALACE I went with Watkins<br>
the MARBLE PALACE was a newer building with fake marble floor tiles and mirrors everywhere <br>
and it only smelled slightly of armpit juice and piss <br>
and I thought well this place is better<br>
so up the non-rickety &quot;marble&quot; stairs Watkins and I marched tra-la<br>
<br>
and then<br>
<br>
I saw her<br>
<br>
The hooker of my dreams looked sweet and young and innocent and unaffected <br>
with shoulder length brown hair and pretty tan skin<br>
she was about 5'6 and petitely built and wore a white corset with a matching garterbelt and panties<br>
and she looked sweet I guess<br>
she was lying on her bed doing schoolwork of some kind of higher math I could not comprehend<br>
she took no notice of Watkins and me gaping lustily at her <br>
and I wondered why she was a hooker <br>
paying for college maybe<br>
it seemed like she didn't belong there<br>
it seemed like she needed somebody to get her out of there <br>
my mind was full of protective fantasies<br>
<br>
Would I sleep with this girl asked Watkins<br>
well maybe I thought but I wanted to see more and indeed there were some hotties in this place<br>
and on this floor I saw beautiful white girls<br>
beautiful black girls<br>
beautiful Asian girls <br>
there was an incredibly firm Asian woman who put on a great show for Watkins and me she was STARK NEKKID<br>
and I must confess I was more than a little happy as she covered her supple body with skin cream<br>
but I couldn't get the little cutie I first saw off my mind<br>
so we explored some more <br>
we went further up the stairs and as usual the quality began to drop<br>
the Watkins found another girl that caught his fancy and price range on the fourth floor<br>
so he haggled a bit at her door and settled on 60 Marks for the classic hooker phrase<br>
a suck and a @#%$<br>
and they closed the door behind them and started to get at it I guess<br>
she looked as though she might have be OK once <br>
but her lingerie was kind of dirty <br>
and she seemed kind of hard and not really as fresh as the cabbage used to be<br>
<br>
I waited out in the hall while Watkins did his thing<br>
I didn't realize how uncomfortable 10 minutes could be in a brothel hallway<br>
I smoked mostly and tried not to notice those who were walking by trying not to notice me<br>
some of the girls between tricks stood at the doors of their rooms and smiled <br>
some smiled invitingly others with just plain kindness<br>
and I was briefly reminded of other smiles almost maternal <br>
and I thought it weird these hookers would give me a maternal smile <br>
but hey I guess they might be moms too seeing as how they @#%$ for a living<br>
anyway it was weird and strange and I decided that when I was done waiting for Watkins that I would make him wait for me while I did that hotty downstairs<br>
but I was beginning to have doubts <br>
could I get it up for a hooker? <br>
my heart was newly broken was I really ready to pay for sex?<br>
Well I wasn't sure but I was quite sure that I had to piss so I pissed in the hallway kind of unobtrusive like<br>
I am sure I wasn't the first or the last to do this<br>
<br>
At last Watkins was finished <br>
BOY WAS HE ANGRY<br>
Man what a rip off he said and he gave he a detailed description of his experience<br>
first the hooker checked him for crabs<br>
dug around his pubes and REALLY SEARCHED <br>
which to me did not sound too erotic but Watkins said it was enough to get him ready for action<br>
so she put a condom on him then lay down on the bed all spread out<br>
HEY! Where's my suck!? asked Watkins and she denied having agreed to do that<br>
and so still arguing Watkins mounted his lumpy girth upon her<br>
she grasped his member and let him in but she would not take her hand away from down there so he didn't get a lot of penetration<br>
and Wakins said HEY WHAT UP WITH THAT?<br>
but she would not answer him or move her hand instead she rolled her eyes and stared past him at the ceiling<br>
and Watkins being the argumentative talky type kept on complaining and kept on going at her<br>
HE WANTED TO GET HIS SIXTY MARKS WORTH <br>
so he started twiddling her breasts<br>
still complaining<br>
MY NIPPLES ARE NOT RADIO KNOBS she told him<br>
when Watkins complained about this she told him if he didn't stop complaining she would push a button by the bed and the thugs that ran the place would come down from their upstairs pool game and beat the @#%$ out of him<br>
Watkins remembered the guy running down the street all bloody and he lost his boner<br>
he put on his clothes and left<br>
Man what a rip off I didn't even come he said<br>
<br>
Well now it was my turn so down the stairs we went to my dream prostitute <br>
I had stars and silly @#%$ dreams floating around my head <br>
little hearts attached I laugh now<br>
because I intended to love a hooker<br>
make her love me<br>
take her away from all this and make her mine<br>
I thought all this @#%$ because I am really a stupid idiot<br>
maybe less now than then but I am still pretty much a moron<br>
by the time we made it to my future and forever lover's door it was closed<br>
I read a sign on the door which said<br>
NIKKI / DOMINATRIX S&amp;M FETISH<br>
<br>
WHAT?<br>
HUH? <br>
OCCUPIED?<br>
MY SWEETHEART WAS A DOMINATRIX!??<br>
<br>
Ah silly <br>
she didn't wait for me <br>
she was busy beating some perverty dude with a whip<br>
making him wear a pecker gag<br>
prodding his colon with a rubber fist<br>
I was truthfully pretty disillusioned yet relieved<br>
I really didn't want to @#%$ a whore anyway<br>
I am pretty stupid most of the time when it comes to sex and love I have trouble untangling the two<br>
though I did have plenty of casual sex in the years that followed I am relieved to state I never fell in love with a hooker or seriously considered paying for sex again.<br>
<br>
Oh the innocence. Sigh.<br>
