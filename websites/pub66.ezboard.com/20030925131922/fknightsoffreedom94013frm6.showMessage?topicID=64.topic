Bel's Raid Rules!<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Raid Rules!<br>
<br>
This little document is brought to you by your local Enchanter’s guild 504. Those of you wishing to remain untransformed into newts are advised to read and consider carefully. It is a guideline, and so of course open to interpretation. Interpretation is fine, just understand WHAT you are interpreting, and try not to violate the spirit. I specifically left many items vague, because I lack all the answers, and felt it best to let everyone taking the trouble to read this, draw their own conclusions.<br>
<br>
Rule #1<br>
<br>
Have Fun! This is what raids are all about. Trust me when I say that some of your best times in Everquest will come on raids. Also hear me when I say so will some of your worst. Almost any raid can be fun, just have the right mental attitude. Different people have different ideas of what fun is, you need to find your own zone, be it seeing zones you’ve never seen before, getting phat loot, or helping others. Don’t let things get to you, and most importantly, don’t set goals such that failure to complete them would result in NOT having fun.<br>
<br>
Rule #2<br>
<br>
Remember everyone else has a Rule #1 too. Think about that one a bit. To the raid leaders, you are just as valuable (but no more valuable) than the next person on the raid. When something good happens for someone, be happy. Don’t complain in public channels that you should have gotten the reward, it makes many other people lose sight of Rule #1. Any real beefs, send private tells. On many of our raids, we have committed boo-boos. We learn, we move on, and we try and correct them. We have had many raid items claimed, because we oopsed, and claiming them was our way to make the victim of our error regain Rule #1. On the other hand, publicly complaining violates Rule #2, because you force the raid leaders into a stressful situation, and deprive them of their right to fun. <br>
<br>
Rule #3<br>
<br>
Be courteous to the raid leaders, to your group members, and everyone else along for the ride. It is trite but true, courtesy costs nothing, but is worth a fortune. Everyone has different ideas of what courtesy is, so I am going to list some points that will make you guaranteed re-invites if you follow.<br>
<br>
A. Be prompt! Its not fun waiting for half the people to get there (See Rule #2)<br>
B. List any restrictions you know about ahead of time. While you might not get picked if you state you can only stay for 3 hours, it will be better for everyone if you state this. See Rule #2 again.<br>
C. Never Ever go AFK without telling someone. You will not be blamed, but it greatly helps if you tell someone ahead of time. This way, the pull team can get valid information about group status, people won’t count on you to do something you’re not going to be there to do, and you won’t be left behind in moves. The ideal situation would be to /g with a reason and ETA back, /ooc AFK, and /afk, so the flag shows up. When returning, reverse the messages, and see Rule #1.<br>
D. Please, don’t kid about loot. Don’t announce rare drops that didn’t really drop. Don’t send tells for loot that you don’t need/wouldn’t use. Don’t loot to “look” at an item, you might accidentally loot a no-drop item, this would be bad. <br>
E. Try and stay off shout, or whatever channel is being used for the raid. The raid needs to effectively communicate via some channel, spamming it makes that hard. Normal raid protocol is pull team, and debuffers on shout, all others on /OOC. If you think you should be on /shout, ask your group, if they can’t decide, have the group leader ask the raid leader. Be aware, there are some places with multiple raid groups present. In those situations, /shout might belong to the other raid, pay attention to the announcements, and if not sure, ask your group. If more than one raid is present, it is especially useful to comment as rarely as possible. If you want to talk, use /g please.<br>
F. Once you know who main assist, CC (Crowd Control), slow, and any other people with direct responsibilities in the raid, please refrain from asking them for anything, including buffs, if there is another way of getting the buffs. The highest level shaman and enchanter on a raid, typically have to deal with incoming mobs, and cannot be available for buffs.<br>
G. Raids do buffing differently, as well. If it is announced that someone has responsibility for a specific buff, please don’t ask others. Most casters can understand that eight spells are not enough to have mem’d, but a game limit anyway. Asking for a buff from someone not responsible, causes them to oftentimes have to mem spells, and use mana, that can be more easily accounted from someone else. If the caster responsible for slows gets pestered for acumen, they may have a choice of forgetting a heal, their slow, or maybe cannibalize. If a mob should happen to be inc, they may not be able to do their duties, because they were helping someone that did not follow instructions. <br>
H. Don’t even THINK about complaining about the drops. See Rule #2.<br>
<br>
<br>
Rule #4<br>
<br>
Everyone was a newbie at one point in time, and throughout the time in Everquest, there will be times when new tactics are learned. Don’t be afraid of doing something wrong, it’s a game we will get over it. Do be afraid of repeating the same mistakes over and over again. Most raid rules evolved to increase the number of mobs killed, and decrease the time it takes to do so. If you have a question, ask it, but do not spam the zone. Your group will likely have someone knowledgeable in it, ask in /g first. If no one in the group has an answer, then go to a non-critical channel (often /ooc) and ask the raid. Below are some things you need to know to attend a raid effectively, if you don’t know them, don’t be ashamed, but do learn them. It will make the raid more fun for all involved.<br>
<br>
A. Everybody needs to have an assist key and use it properly. Many wipeouts are caused by improper assisting, and could have been prevented. If you are not fully confident in your assist capabilities, as how to disable attack on assist, so that after assisting, you just need to activate auto attack.<br>
i. The key needs to be targeted, for example /assist Braddox. /assist works poorly, unless you are a cleric using assist healing. <br>
ii. Don’t attack until the main assist declares a target, for example, Ironwind says “Assist me on a Kelorek’Dar, and we will surely be victorious!” One purpose of this deals with aggro management. Mezzed mobs tend to hate the enchanter, letting the main assist taunt/stun/root first helps control this. The second reason, is the main assist may not have the correct mob targeted yet, and assist early can cause problems. Finally, assisting early is contagious. Once you start, others can’t resist to try and “get the first strike”. Let the main assist do their job, so that others can key off the assist phrase, not guess when something needs to be attacked.<br>
iii. Don’t think that its critical to be the first one in. Look at your positioning. Are you going to push the mob off a ledge? Are you going to drive the mob up a wall or somewhere undesirable? While waiting for the assist call to go out, check where you are standing!<br>
iv. Never, EVER attack something on the pull team without a call to assist. The pull team has two responsibilities, first is to keep pulls coming. The second responsibility is to make a judgement call, and accept being wiped out, to preserve the raid. If you cast or use ranged weapons, or heal, aggro will be transferred to the raid body, with unfortunate results. This is true for Monks as well. If a monk is slacking (er feigned) do not cast on them without their permission. They might have an aggro situation you do not know about, send them a tell, and if all is well, then cast.<br>
B. Casters need to be aware of their aggro. Raids tend to have large amounts of lag, that affects many people. If a caster nukes, causing the mob to rush him, some lagged out tanks now cannot attack the mob, and if other casters continue to ping-pong the mob, much efficiency is lost, because the mob is being killed by mana, not melee. Ask a tank, they will tell you their number one issue on raids is getting into melee range.<br>
C. Tanks need to be aware of the situation they are in, with regards to their healers mana. A cleric that is OOM, is not going to be able to save your life, no matter how much they want to. If you get aggro, and are not main assist, consider some simple remedies. Stop attacking for 5 seconds, or even back up a little bit, so the mob targets someone else. Also, do NOT attack enraged mobs from the front. An enraged mob automatically gets an attack on you, every time you land an attack from in front. Be especially aware of this if you are using dual wielded fast weapons.<br>
<br>
<br>
Rule #5<br>
<br>
Listen for instructions, and FOLLOW them. There is usually a reason for instructions, and that is not always clear at the time. Some epic mobs need to be killed, some need to be hailed to hand in items, and others may have special circumstances around their activation. Please pay attention to all raid leader instructions. Also many mobs have to be fought in areas that are less than optimal. Steep walls can cause mobs to poof, so listen for instructions on where to fight, when to fight, and what direction to attack from. Also do not take it upon yourself to shout instructions out. Let the raid leaders do this, so there is one central authority. Above all, listen and react, or if something is wrong, reply in a non spamming manner, with what you feel the problem is, so that the raid leaders can make the call, and re-direct the raid actions. Having someone shout camp can turn a hard, but winnable battle into a disaster. This means do NOT issue command like announcements because you feel you know better. Even if you do have something right, this is only going to cause confusion and hurt, when the raid needs to be focused on the task at hand.<br>
<br>
<br>
Rule #6<br>
<br>
The raid leaders WILL be in tell hell. LDs, Rezzes, loot requests, messages, requests, all add to the burdon. Your group leader is there for you. Tell them what is important, and let them communicate what they feel significant onwards. This will allow the raid organizers to get some rest, and maybe experience Rule #1 too!<br>
<br>
<br>
Rule #7<br>
<br>
Please announce any debuffs you land on a mob. This helps other people to know what they can do to a mob, since often slow won’t stick until the mob has been Tashed and Malo’d, and Malo needs Tash to have a better chance of sticking. The raid leaders will designate the buffers and debuffers, so make sure you know if you are in charge of a certain debuff. This is especially important for dispellers. If you dispell too late you may remove some important debuffs (especially likely if the debuffs were not called). It is highly recommended that if you are not the person designated as the dispeller (if there is one) that you should not even have a dispell memmed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Rule #8<br>
<br>
Please know your computer. You are raiding with a lot of people. Make sure you turn off all unneeded options, and that you are running with /serverfilter on. Know how to do this, or ask people in your group. You will experience lag, and will need to adjust. If you need to turn down the clipping plane, or take other actions, like turning off PC names. <br>
<br>
<br>
Addendum:<br>
<br>
All of the above rules are good general rules to follow. This section is a brief (for me) discussion on the whys of the above rules. First, people who are raiding for the first time, often are starting to be at the peak of their characters power. They can dominate simple camps, and they are used to groups. This gives them a feeling that they know what is right. This is no doubt true, in what they have experienced. In a raid situation there are many things working against success. One, the mobs are a lot tougher. If the mobs were doable by a good group, there would be no need for a raid, would there? Two, more people add lag, even to systems that normally don’t lag. This lag causes problems with spells getting off in time, LDs, and melee types staying in melee range. Also, with more people on a raid, personality conflicts even enter into the mix. All of these issues stack against the success or failure of the raid. <br>
<br>
The raid leaders from Misericordia are not perfect people. We make mistakes, sometimes what seems to be a lot of them. What helps is we tend to learn from those mistakes, and so you will not experience failures we have previously experienced. What we are not, is the army. We are not professional raid leaders, nor do we ever want to become that. We most deeply want to experience Rule #1, and allow as many others on the raid to experience Rule #1 as possible. We generally won’t tell you to do unpleasant stuff that is not needed. There are times, however, when stuff we would rather not do become necessary. If you feel a raid is unpleasant, try to understand the reason for the unpleasantness. We are on the raid as well, and if you are not having fun, we are likely not having fun either. If we all work together, even CR can be accomplished in a good mood, and the raid get underway soon. <br>
<br>
We have gone on many different raids, and seen many catastrophes. The important part is to minimize the risks that lead to situations of failure. In an environment like EQ, that is not always easy, these rules are designed to make it possible for us to operate to the best of everyone’s abilities. When we tackle new settings, the learning process might be painful. One reason that seems to upset people on raids, is due to the experience loss. We will NEVER leave someone’s corpse behind, which is within our ability to recover. We will always try to get the best rezzes available, when possible. A raid requiring more than one group is a dangerous thing. Experience loss can happen, and due to raid requirements, the KS group might get the lion’s share of the experience. This is done for reasons best explained in Rule #2, because by quickly killing mobs, more can be done, including having more fun. <br>
<br>
Have fun, Enjoy, and see ya on a raid soon!<br>
