These two people are still together and love each other very much even after 14 years.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>First Born cut his hair on Friday morning. Apparently the casual notion that his fringe was too long and didn't look sufficiently wicked strolled through his head, so - without the use of anything as lame as a mirror, naturally - he got a pair of scissors and cut his own hair; he now looks like a tiny Howard Devoto. Except blond. And without the spectacles. (&quot;So, not very much like Howard Devoto at all, then. Also, we were born in 1987 and have entirely no idea who Howard Devoto is.&quot; - Everyone.)<br>
Now, Margret and I don't do that widespread thing of transferring ownership of the children depending on the situation; 'My son is a neurosurgeon,' 'Your son has just poured byriani behind the radiator,' that kind of thing. We do another thing. Margret, who is the one to spot Jonathan appears to be the first seven-year-old to be suffering from male pattern baldness, marches into the room where I'm sitting, reading the paper, and, looming over me with her arms knotted tightly across her ribs says:<br>
'Jonathan's cut loads of his hair off.'<br>
I look up at her and, after a few moments of thought, naturally reply:<br>
'Tsk.'<br>
She's unable to find herself entirely satisfied with this.<br>
'So, that's it then, is it? You're all parented out now?'<br>
'What am I supposed to do?' I ask, bewildered. 'He's cut the hair off. Do you want me to wrap it in frozen peas and race to the hospital to see if they can do an emergency weave?'<br>
'I think,' she replies, 'that you should go and speak to him.'<br>
And there it is. There is only one specific type of occasion when Margret feels I should 'go and speak to' one of the children, and that's when they have done something forehead-slappingly idiotic. The implication she is making is that Idiocy is my area. That only I can speak to the children when they've done something comprehensively crackbrained because, unlike her, I can speak The Language Of Fools. 'Maybe you can get through to him,' she's saying, 'Because you know how the asinine mind works.'<br>
I drop the newspaper with a sigh, resigned, now, to the fact that I'll never get to find out what Kevin Spacey's favourite pasta dish is, and plod into the other room. Jonathan is happily drawing a picture at the table.<br>
'Jonathan?'<br>
'Yes?'<br>
'Don't do stuff like that. Your hair looks stupid.'<br>
I see his eyes flick, for the briefest moment, up to my hair. I'm dead in the water and we both know it.<br>
'I like it,' he says.<br>
'Oh, you like it, do you?' I laugh. 'So, it doesn't matter that everyone else in the world thinks it looks stupid? You like it? That's... Um, that's really good, actually. That's good.' I ruffle (what's left of) his hair.<br>
Margret walks in behind me. Quickly, I furrow my eyebrows and point a sharp finger at Jonathan.<br>
'So? Is that clear?'<br>
'Yes,' he replies.<br>
I walk out past Margret. 'Let's not say another word about this, then.'<br>
Of course, next week he'll probably get into homemade tattoos, and his defence will begin, 'Well, Papa said...'<br>
I have my bags packed ready.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Romance Masterclass. <br>
It's Wednesday the 12th of February. It's early evening. Margret and I are sitting in the living room. Margret has asked me to do something the following day.<br>
Mil: 'I can't, I'm afraid. I'm going into town.'<br>
Margret: 'Why? What do you need to go to town for?'<br>
Mil: 'Oh, I have to get some stuff.'<br>
Margret: 'What stuff?'<br>
Mil: 'Just some stuff... things.'<br>
Margret: 'What things?'<br>
Mil: 'Various things.'<br>
Margret: 'What things?'<br>
Mil: 'What does it matter?'<br>
Margret: 'What things?'<br>
Mil: 'It's not important what specific things, is it? I have to get things or I wouldn't be cycling into town, would I? All that's relevant here is that I have to go, not the details of the individual items I need to get - there's no point wasting time giving you a big list, when the only significant point is that I need to go to town.'<br>
Margret: 'What things?'<br>
Mil: 'Oh, for Christ's sake... Pizzas. I need to buy some pizzas, OK?'<br>
Margret: 'We've got pizzas.'<br>
Mil: 'We've got a pizza.'<br>
Margret: 'So? How many do you need?'<br>
Mil: 'Several. I want to have several in the fridge.'<br>
Margret: 'Why?'<br>
Mil: 'So that we have a stock of them.'<br>
Margret: 'Why?'<br>
Mil: 'So that we don't run out, obviously.'<br>
Margret: 'What would happen if we ran out?'<br>
Mil: 'I'd have to go to town.'<br>
This flings itself out of my mouth while my higher brain is still racing along behind it frantically waving its arms and shouting, 'Wait! Wait!'<br>
Margret responds with just the tiniest movement of her eyebrows. Absolutely minuscule. Sufficient in size, however, to make me wonder if I could get a UN resolution to have her bombed.<br>
Mil: 'I have to get other things too.'<br>
Margret: 'What things?'<br>
Mil: 'What the bloody hell does it matter? Why can't I go to town if I want to, for God's sake?'<br>
Margret: 'Why are you being secretive? What are you up to?'<br>
Mil: 'I'm not up to anything.'<br>
Margret: 'Yes you are.'<br>
Mil: 'Like what?'<br>
Margret: 'I don't know.'<br>
Mil: 'Because there isn't anything.'<br>
Margret: 'Yes there is - I can tell.'<br>
Mil: 'There isn't.'<br>
Margret: 'You bloody liar.'<br>
Mil: 'You bloody mad woman.'<br>
Margret: 'Tell me.'<br>
Mil: 'Stop talking now.'<br>
Margret: 'Tell me.'<br>
Mil: 'I...'<br>
Margret: 'Tell me.'<br>
I think we've both risen to our feet by this point (it allows for better voice projection).<br>
Mil: 'OK! OK! You want to know why I need to go up town, you relentless harridan?!'<br>
Margret: ''Yes! You lying swine!'<br>
Mil: 'So I can get your Valentine's Day card! So I can get your bloody Valentine's Day card and post it to here - so it'll arrive as a nice surprise through the post!'<br>
A tiny flicker. It's the merest stutter of hesitation, though, then she's back on track before the beat is really lost.<br>
Margret: 'You don't need to get me a bloody Valentine's Day card!'<br>
(I can't imagine what makes her think she's going to get away with this move - she must be getting old.)<br>
Mil: 'Too bad! Because I'm getting you a Valentine's Day card! And I'm posting it to you! Tomorrow! When I go to town!'<br>
Margret: 'THERE'S NO BLOODY NEED!'<br>
Mil: 'WELL IT'S GOING TO BLOODY HAPPEN - GET USED TO IT!'<br>
And, indeed, I do go to town, buy her a card, and post it. Inside I write, 'Surprise!' She gets it on Valentine's Day and says, 'Thank you,' to me, through gritted teeth. (She gets me one too, by the way - it reads, &quot;I'm not interested in a nice, normal relationship... I like ours better.&quot<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Mostly she doesn't bother about it - it's an Internet thing (Margret on the Internet: &quot;It's rubbish.&quot<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  . She does read it every so often, though, and thinks it's funny. Margret, you see, unlike some people, is smart, understands English - subtexts and all - and has a sense of humour. We've only ever had two arguments about the page and they were minor. By which, naturally, I mean that they were screaming, howling rows lasting about three hours each, but they were minor by our standards (they were also about things so tiny and incidental that no one else would have even noticed them, let alone managed to fan them into a row). The last time she read the page her only comment was &quot;You're such a liar.&quot; Which she later modified to &quot;Oh. Right. I'd forgotten about that.&quot; It is true, however, that lately, after she's done something Margret-like - trying to reverse the car over me or whatever - she has taken to saying &quot;I suppose you're going to put that up on your page now, aren't you?&quot; To which my reply, naturally, is &quot;Darling - it's not my page, it's our page.&quot;<br>
