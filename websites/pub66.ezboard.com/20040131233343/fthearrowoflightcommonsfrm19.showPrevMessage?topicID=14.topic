(kinda long but I need to vent)<br>
<br>
OK, after getting thru with a really good arrow group in PoD this morning. I decided I wasn't done, nor was Athame. So I toss my LFG tag on and head to the planes. Finding a group was tough. I ventured in to PoD, PoI and eventually landed in PoN. After a couple OOC's, pleadings, offering people money to let a necro in their group, and finally selling my soul to the nearest ranger ( NOT hehe) I got one.<br>
<br>
Here's what classes we would delve in to the PoN with : Necro, Shammy, Cleric, Wizard, Warrior and Paladin. Nice little combo. I thought, greeeat, bout to yank the soul of some mobs now.<br>
<br>
We head in to what they refer to as &quot;3 bird rock&quot;. My first dilemma was when I got split from the group and ended up getting nastily ambushed by two hobgoblins. I think my pet had stopped to gaze at a treant at this point, he was no where to be found. I tried to play dead but they saw straight through my magic. Loading please wait...... The cleric offers a rez. No thank you ma'am. I will rez myself. I have extra EE's stored in my pack and have been itching to use one. Not to mention I can resurrect for a better percentage than you. Necro Powah!<br>
<br>
Finally my dead corpse appears in the graveyard. I rez myself, and Cleric does a CH on me. Wow, thank you for the precious health you have just given me. Now let me lich it all away and convert it to mana, /grin. No pet, no mana. We are merely basking in the forest planning our mission. <br>
<br>
Off we go to the area where we shall remain for who knows how long.<br>
<br>
So the pally is gonna pull. Wham, incoming blood raven. Wow, no warning or nothing Mr. Pally, did you have that in your pocket this time? Semi good fight, these things hit hard, cleric cast CH on pally twice. Next pull pally brings two. Ok Mr. Pally we only have two melle, not including my pet. But it's ok, never fear, the necro is here. Pooyah, mezz the add. What a good little gnome I am. Suddenly, What's this? A gnarled treant has been awoken by &quot;pally&quot;. Wth? The warrior is on the intial one you pulled Mr. Pally, as is my pet and all my dots, not to mention the shammy's slow. Kindly I state, &quot;Mr. pally, I can crowd control if you both stay on one target&quot;. Pooyah, mezz add again. Ack! He is awoke by the blade of the pally yet again! Ok, we are split. No choice but to lay the wrath on the add now. Wam, bam, he is seriously dot'ed and hurting. We made it, 4 CH's later from the cleric and we are good.<br>
<br>
Whats this? Lom? Pffttt, without hesitation here comes the pally again with two more wonderful things that want to kill us. Can this guy Lull? did he forget to buy the spell? I again tap a mezz on the add, again awoken. OK, forget it, un-mem that spell and get harmshield up, its obvious we may die soon at the hand of this little dwarven wanna be. How this cleric drew the mana from the skies to keep the warriors alive I do not know, but she did. Cheers! We made it! Normally you would take a small med break. NOPE! Incoming!<br>
<br>
This time it is an arachnid of some sort, and it does not like me darking it, so bam bam, it takes me to one bulb in a heart beat. Super heal to Athame! Yeah Cleric! Uh oh, whats this? Cleric says LOM! O no, get busy Ath, nuke that puppy for all its worth, and twitch that cleric. <br>
<br>
But wait, I see something I have never seen before. I reach up to my eyeballs to make sure there is no sap from the last treant obscuring my vision. (DoH! skelly form = no eyeballs) Yes! Yes! WTH? The pally is sitting down? The mob is still 3/4 life and the warrior is losing health? I manage mutter some words out along with my spells, &quot;Mr. Pally, whatcha doin?&quot; &quot;Meddin&quot; he says. Quick Ath, get that cleric some mana, twitch twitch, CH to warrior, whew, we are done. Another hair raising battle. &quot;Umm, Mr. Pally, if you need to take a med break please do, if you need mana, let me know, I'll twitch you&quot;<br>
<br>
Woops, incoming again! Another raven. Now I hear the pally muttering words. I am far from the fight but I hear &quot;take the aggro, take the aggro&quot;. Then I see this amazing thing again! the pally sits down while the warrior is in melee. At least this time the mob is at half health. O NO! Aggro on cleric, aggro on cleric! (no doubt caused by the super heal she laid on the warrior who is fighting alone) Help me help me she screams. Quickly she is drained of half her life. the warrior jumps in between the bird and the cleric, what a brave soul he was. <br>
<br>
I am becoming agitated now. &quot;Mr. Pally, get off yer rump and fight!&quot; I say. I almost FD'ed when I heard the response. It was muffled somewhat because I was in the midst of battle. But yes I deciphered it &quot;I'm meddin mofoka&quot;. &quot;In the midle of a fight?&quot; I say. &quot;Are you actually worried about these?&quot; he says. &quot;Considering you are taking complete heals like they are free KEI, yes I am concerned!&quot; (silence) Wha? where is he? O no, he went to pull again.<br>
<br>
Wait, pop in camp, pop in camp! We got a bird on us, come help Mr. Pally! Here he comes, with two mobs right behind him. Great we got three! Heals are being fired off left and right. I am merely staying alive by the life taps I am chain casting. Whats this? the Pally's health bar is rapidly deteriorating. Suddenly, he falls to the ground lifeless. &quot;Evac Evac!&quot; I hear. Then I am swept away by a shimmering portal created by the wizard. <br>
<br>
Whew, we are safe, we made it. Uh oh, wheres the shammy? Nope, she didnt make it. Nor did our famous paladin. &quot;Now have you been given a reason to be concerned about these things Mr. Pally?&quot; Silence.........................<br>
<br>
Needless to say the group deteriorated at this point. I was in tells with all of the group members at this point explaining hwo I would not stay any longer. They were all in agreeance with me.<br>
<br>
/gate<br>
/camp<br>
<br>
Let me say the other 4 people in the group were wonderful. BUT, this sad representation of a paladin was pathetic! If any of you wish to know his name, so that you may avoid him, let me know, I will be glad to inform you. Yes, he was guilded in what I thought was a &quot;upper class&quot; guild. But /shrug.<br>
<br>
Ahh, I feel a little better. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E6E8fA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub66.ezboard.com/bthearrowoflightcommons.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sytox>Sytox</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Frog Hater (Enough with the Hopping!)</span><br>  Posts: 552<br> <font color=#000080>(4/3/03 12:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: My nightmare in the PoN</span><hr size=1> LOL!<br>

<br>
  You did the best you could, which is outstanding.  I probably woulda told the pally to &quot;quit being an ass and give the cleric time to med,&quot; and if that failed I woulda left the group or suggested the leader boot him from the group (in tells of course).  Most experienced players know when things are not right and you are headed for a disaster and would have gone along with you.<br>
<br>
  Ain't hardly anything worse than a player who got PL'd and doesn't know how to play his character.  Medding in a battle for a paladin is a last-resort kinda thing; but if he were at that point he shoulda known to quit pulling so many mobs and let the cleric med.  DUH!  As far as using Pacify, it used to be a pretty worthless spell, but Verant beefed it up and it works wonders now.  Aevetare can single pull the Bodyguards from the Warlord room in KC with that spell and he is only lvl 53.  I had Mugo in there showing pallies how to do it too, which I am sure freaked some of them out (Mugo = 1200 hp and 600 AC = easy death magnet).  I wouldn't be there if I didn't feel comfortable doing it....<br>
<br>
  And as far as breaking mezzes, I have grouped with a few of these 'tards myself (why, just Sunday night in PoI for example...).  After they break them consistantly for a few mobs, I just let the mobs run wild and save my mana for when the idiots either die or give the evac call.  It ain't my problem if they are stupid.  If the group complains that you weren't mezzing the answer si straighforward: &quot;Retard was breaking them so what's the point?&quot;<br>
<br>
Nuff said.<br>
<br>
  If you want to group in PoN, we can get some great xp there.  Just need myself (for charming treants), a snarer (druid, ranger or both for keeping treants snared), and a healer (druid, cleric or shaman to save the po' fool chanter's butt when the charm wears off).  Discovered the hard way that SK (and maybe necro) snares don't work worth a darn though =/.  Dont seem to land very easily and dont last as long as the woodland-type classes.  Anyway, I was there tonight doing just this with a full group and it worked out really well, again.  Almost a full gold bub (minus some for the death) for about 2.5 hrs work.<br>
<br>
Mugo<br>
<br>
P.s. the pally -- and Yes, it was a pally -- that drove me to leave PoI was NOT the same pally poor Athame had to deal with.  Same level of IQ though and yes he did cause a wipeout because he couldn't understand the concept of 'dont touch the mezzed mobs.'<br>
<br>
/rant off.<br>
<br>
And I have met some great, fun, talented people in PoN: Just tonight 'Adore' the GL from Hale Ohana (warrior) and a celric named 'Darchild' added me to their friends list cause they want me to go hunting with them again.  Not to mention Anamas (65 Druid) and Ledyas (55 Ranger) who I met a few nights ago...  It is fertile ground I tell ya for those with skill.<br>
