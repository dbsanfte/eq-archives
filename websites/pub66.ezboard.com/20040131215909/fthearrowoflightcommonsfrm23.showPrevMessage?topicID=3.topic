<br>
Awakening Into A Strange Land:<br>
<br>
As I recall my first memories started in the extravagant (to me back then) city of Qeynos.  So many strange and wonderful people to interact with I could scarcely make sense of it.  And the Shops with Vendors selling thier wares.  How many interesting and mysterious items there were to find.  Things were so unreal to me that i barely had the courage to step past the Guards at the front gates.<br>
<br>
Luckily for me I had someone to Guide me through my early Days.  My brother Dradamier,  A young Wizard who was older in days and more familiar with the surroundings of the city than me,  took me under his wing and Taught me that there was much to do outside the confines of the Qeynos walls.  Under his tuteledge I struggled and learned how to survive in this hostile world of ours.<br>
<br>
Soon I was willing to start my adventures without having someone by my side the entire time.  I started working on my fighting skills ridding the countryside of numerous small pests that seem to plague the area.  But I felt somehow not quite fulfilled as there was nobody else there to share my war stories with.  However,  Soon afterwards I would have another Young Adventurer to share in my Wanderings.<br>
<br>
Enter Garomtel:<br>
<br>
I had Heard this name before.  Perhaps I had caught it whispered between the Bards who reside in our Fair city.  I cant quite remember but perhaps i may have seen him there as well.  Carrying Sacks full of mail to places I had not even come close to seeing myself.  As fate would have it our paths were soon to cross.<br>
<br>
I had seen the Large stone marker in the Qeynos hills many times.  Its smooth face imprinted with the words To Highkeep and a simple arrow pointing Eastward along a path.  Being the curious type, and bored with the daily grind of killing rats and Gnolls, I decided that this was the perfect time to See a new city.  <br>
<br>
As i journeyed my way East. Being careful to Stay away from the large roaming animals,  My eyes beheld someone else along the path in the distance.  He seemed to be making his way toward me at a good pace.  Not wanting to dally along an open path in a dangerous land we both passed each other.  But something about his face caught my attention and made me Stop.  Apparently he had recognized something as well, for we both turned at the same instant to face each other.<br>
<br>
We greeted each other, and as he spoke his name A slight memory flickered in my mind.<br>
<br>
&quot;Garomtel?&quot;  &quot;I have heard this name before have I not?&quot;<br>
<br>
At this point we both understood that Our paths, while perhaps not crossing beforehand,  Had only come within a breadth of each other.<br>
<br>
He told me of his search for items that he had lost while making his way through the vast expanses of the Karanas not long ago.  Eager as i was to see what Highkeep may have had in store for me,  something about this encounter struck me as much more important.  In due time i understood how right I was.<br>
<br>
Garomtel and I shared many battles together.  And as he has stated, forged many memories as well.  He became as a Brother to me in the course of things.  And in turn he introduced me to some of his extended family,  who I also came to count as my friends.  These friendships would themselves lead me into more and more interesting tales ......<br>
<br>
But those are best to be left for another time.........<br>
