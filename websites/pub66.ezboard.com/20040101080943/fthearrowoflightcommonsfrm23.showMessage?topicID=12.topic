Don't read this chapter till you've read Part 6: Our Very First Guild Meeting]<br>
<br>
<br>
LIGHTING THE ARROW<br>
<br>
Much as I’d like to say that the Highpass meeting propelled the Arrow quiver into high gear and we were formed the following week…. well that was not the case.  Actually, at this time in the story I feel compelled to mention that our history wasn’t all drunk levitation and games.  There were dark moments too.  People are only human (when applicable), and sometimes personalities clashed.  Sometimes people embarrassed themselves, or stomped away in a huff, or said and did things that they regretted.  OKay, just hold that thought…<br>
<br>
<br>
“The Unbroken Circle” was still high on the list of possible guild names.  But while adventuring in the East Commonlands one day, Montag and I spotted a guild name:  “The Unbroken Circle of Truth.”  Oh well, there went THAT name.   <br>
<br>
Montag was given the responsibility of tallying the votes as we narrowed down our guild name possibilities.  Finally… after weeks and weeks of deliberation, in a narrow vote, one name remained… “Arrow of Light.”  I for one couldn’t WAIT to get it above my head.  It didn’t take long before those who were unsure about the name to come around to loving it as well.<br>
<br>
Next, we needed a Charter.  We had all pitched some great suggestions for values our Charter would have, and Aydrian said he’d take a crack at writing it.  I fancied myself a writer and silently intended to take whatever Ayd wrote and whip it into shape.  Frankly, I didn’t think Ayd had it in him.  Boy, was I wrong.<br>
<br>
When we all read what Aydrian had written, every one of us were blown away.  Unanimous approval.  Maybe a sentence was added, but to this day, the Arrow of Light Charter is exactly as Ayd wrote it.  Perfect.  Ayd, cheers to you!  I could NOT have done it better.<br>
<br>
It was somewhere around this time that I got a letter from Montag.  This was not a good letter.  It was sudden and grim.  From time to time, Montag would disappear.  Usually only a week or two and he’d be back.  But this time, it wasn’t so.  <br>
<br>
        “I can’t come back,” he said.  “Tell everyone I’m sorry, and that I said goodbye, will you?”<br>
        “Aww, come on, Monty!” I wrote him back.  “This is no big deal.  You’ll figure out something and be back in no time.”<br>
        “Not this time, Gar,” he said.  “You and I have had a lot of good times together… It’s really meant a lot to me.  Go form the guild… make it good.”<br>
<br>
There was a finality to this that was quite real.  Montag was a true Arrow… but he would never be a member of the guild.  Nothing would ever be the same.  <br>
<br>
<br>
The guild-to-be collected more friends.  There was Phildefer the bard, Tumdiven, and Mulk (“the guud ogre Ranjer!”), and my friend Cervania to name a few.  I cannot remember exactly, but I believe Aeve, Phaith and Mugo had pledged to join us by then as well.  To form the guild, we needed ten individuals to gather together.  Now, if we could just set a time.   <br>
<br>
Weeks went by.  Weeks turned to months.  Try SIX months now past since our first meeting and the Arrow of Light was still just an idea on parchment.  I’ll be honest, sometimes I felt I was the only one who still wanted to see it happen.  I wrote several letters to our group asking if we could set the date.  At first they seemed to rally enthusiasm.  But then they went unanswered.  Merani’s schedule didn’t enable her to set a time and know she’d BE there.  She did once imply the guild could be formed without her, but Ayd wouldn’t hear of it.  I could plead all I wanted to Aydrian, he wasn’t ABOUT to do anything without Merani.  <br>
<br>
The Arrow of Light was a beached ship.  Cancel that, we were ship in dry dock, covered with scaffolding!  This boat was going nowhere.  And with six months come and gone, I could not foresee ANYTHING changing that.<br>
<br>
Finally, this Ranger had had it.  I gave up.  I had gotten vague offers to join other guilds and I was ready to take them.  So… I privately let it be known that I was ready to walk.  Not only that, I would be asking Montag (even though he was gone) and Cervania to come along.  This would remove 3 people from the 10 Founders list and the Arrows would not have the required numbers to form.  It would probably set the Arrow of Light back another 3 months.  <br>
<br>
Was this a gutsy move?  No.  It was arrogant.  <br>
<br>
Not only did I have no pending offers from another guild, it was pretty presumptuous on my part that Montag or Cervania would follow my lead.  In retrospect, it was an awful thing to do.  If I could erase it, I definitely would.  In a heartbeat.  <br>
<br>
But don’t you know… a few days later an announcement was made.  In two Sundays time we would be gathering to form the guild.  It was finally going to happen!  <br>
<br>
Was it all a bluff, you ask?  Let’s just say I would have come out a very big loser.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub66.ezboard.com/bthearrowoflightcommons.showUserPublicProfile?gid=garomtel>Garomtel</A> at: 1/26/03 9:42:04 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm23.showPrevMessage?topicID=12.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm23.showNextMessage?topicID=12.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic><img src=http://www.eq-arrow-of-light.com/aol/images/boardbuttons/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm23.emailToFriend?topicID=12.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm23.threadControl?topicID=12.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm23.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=12.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm23.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=12.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub66.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thearrowoflightcommonsfrm1">General<option value="thearrowoflightcommonsfrm4">/OOC Chat<option value="thearrowoflightcommonsfrm2">Raids and Events<option value="thearrowoflightcommonsfrm23">The Fireplace<option value="thearrowoflightcommonsfrm7">So You Want to Be an Arrow?<option value="thearrowoflightcommonsfrm17">Game Play Q & A<option value="thearrowoflightcommonsfrm13">Testing one...two...three...<option value="thearrowoflightcommonsfrm19">Rants, Whines and Whimpers</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000080>- </font><a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/bthearrowoflightcommons>The Arrow of Light Commons</a><font color=#000080> - </font><a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm23>The Fireplace</a> <font color=#000080> - </font><a href="www.eq-arrow-of-light.com">Home</a><font color=#000080> - </font><br><br> <script language="javascript">
