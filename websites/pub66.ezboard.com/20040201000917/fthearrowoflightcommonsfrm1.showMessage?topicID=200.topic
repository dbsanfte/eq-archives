You're only widening the rift between a normal member and an officer.<br>
<br>
Honestly, there is nothing that an officer in this guild *does* that a normal member shouldn't be able to do.  AoL doesn't lead raids, or go on major raids, so there's no need for an officer there.  When it comes to a person getting &quot;out of hand&quot;, how do you say having an &quot;officer&quot; is better?  Who says the officer is going to do the right thing?  That's something that the guild in itself should work toward- perfecting its members.  What happens if you call a member a name?  Not near as worse, I garuntee, as if you call an officer one.<br>
<br>
Honestly, you're just taking more powers away from members and giving them to officers, which makes it worse to be in your guild.  There's no real need to have an officer in your guild, because every power they have another person could have.  <br>
<br>
As I told Del, if you want to show someone has been around for a while, then why don't you say &quot;elder member.&quot;  The way the system is set up now, officers are more important than a common member, for no real reason at all.  Elder members might be, yes, but only because they've been around for a while.  <br>
<br>
I guess I honestly see no reason in having an officer in a guild that doesn't go on specific raids except to show some people are more important than others.  <br>

It seems to me Meowkat that you are extremely bitter about the tag &quot;officer&quot; AND you are either very un-informed, or refuse to acknowledge, what exactly an officer does. To say that we as AoL doesn't raid is a false statement, and you know that. And to take it a step further, define &quot;major raid&quot; for me. Are you leaning towards high end raids such as PoT and CT? And why would a guild need officers for raids and only for raids? Is this not the function of the Raid Leader and Group Leaders?<br>
<br>
Let me paint a picture for you with YOUR example as given. You say that raids need officers. So you have a group of people brought together for a specific goal. You have a large amount of people, be they experienced, elder, or in-experienced people. Now, to accomplish this goal you have a Raid leader, along with Group Leaders. In any common raid the attendants will speak through their group leader to the Raid Leader. Follow me? Now think of a guild as a raid. Our purpose is to play the game per say. We have a raid leader (Guild Leader) and group leaders (Officers) to help accomplish this task. Seem a little clearer?<br>
<br>
Now on &quot;Elder Members&quot;. Are you saying that by one person playing longer than another he/she should have or does have more knowledge of the game? Not to mention do they have the ability and/or play style to effectively lead a group of players? What about the person who has played for three years, but never experienced the game above level 45? Does he/she have a leg up on the player who has played for a year and has two 60+ characters? In my opinion it is &quot;player based&quot;. What YOU as a player can offer the game, not how much TIME you spend on the game. Or does play time distinguish these Elder Members? Does one have to constantly play in order to be given this title?<br>
<br>

<br>
Ok, its obvious to me that you do not know what the officers do behind the scenes. And by that I don't mean &quot;widening of the rift&quot; as you said. I am talking core responsibilities that keep the guild functioning on a day to day basis. Lets see,<br>
<br>
FORUMS - Who do you think gives you the access? Who do you think created them? who is the one to contact other guilds via their own forums and invite them to ours for inter-guild events?<br>
<br>
EMAILS - Who sends out the welcome Emails?<br>
<br>
GUILDMOTD - Who changes the guild MOTD?<br>
<br>
EXTERIOR RELATIONS - You spoke of &quot;major raids&quot; (which I still want a definition of. Is ToFs not a major raid for a group of 40's?) Without outer guild relations there are NUMEROUS guilds on Terris-Thule who could not take down heavy bosses. Hence the GCP was created. Do you know what the GCP is and what it stands for? Do you know there is an Admin in the GCP? Do you know there are &quot;Councils in the GCP? Yes, the same thing as officers and GL's.  Do you know that a representative from AoL goes to the council area twice a week to share and give information?<br>
<br>
IN GAME - Who do you think gives you the invite? SoE/Verant has created the guild atmosphere for players, and in that they created Officer and GL positions. If not for anything but the simple purpose of inviting people in to the guild. I think you totally forgot about this small detail when you say aboloish the officers.<br>
<br>
BACK TO FORUMS - Officers in AoL are constantly gathering and dealing out information on the boards. And yes, a lot of time it is in the officer only forum. We do this for a reason. We hash out the details of said topic and THEN give it to the guild for more input. Tons upon tons of ideas are discussed. Events, Raids ect. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>When it comes to a person getting &quot;out of hand&quot;, how do you say having an &quot;officer&quot; is better? Who says the officer is going to do the right thing? That's something that the guild in itself should work toward- perfecting its members. What happens if you call a member a name? Not near as worse, I garuntee, as if you call an officer one.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No one says the officer is going to do the right thing Meowkat. Never have I read on any of our posts &quot;Officers are the alll-mighty and powerful and you will obey&quot;. If anything I see the exact OPPOSITE. I see the officers asking others for input. Now please explain to me where you get the above statement &quot;Not near as worse, I garuntee, as if you call an officer one&quot; Garuntee that statement and give me an example of it please.<br>
<br>
And what powers are being taken from members by appointing officers? Every last member of AoL has the same powers as everyone else. The only &quot;power&quot; an officer really has is that of invite/disband in game, MOTD. I &quot;garuntee&quot; you that is, being an officer, I had power over the guild and its members we would ALL be Epic'ed, level 65, and utterly bored of raiding PoT and CT, not to mention saying &quot;I just got to stop having fun at this game, its too much!&quot;.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I guess I honestly see no reason in having an officer in a guild that doesn't go on specific raids except to show some people are more important than others.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Wrong again. Its exactly the opposite. Officers are not tagged to be &quot;important&quot; people. They are tagged so that they can help get the wagon rolling in the neverending task of helping every single member get what they want out of the game. I say neverending because it is, its called EVERquest.<br>
<br>
I think I have shed some light on what teh officers do, and what role they play. Now can you be more specific, as Tymoria asked, as to what your complaint is so we can address it?<br>

<br>
I'm sorry I said AoL isn't a raiding guild.  What I meant by this is that we don't do raids like Thurg, ToV, or Planes.  Not once have I seen the guild set up to go on a raid with SS or 1fer's to go and do plane flags.  Why? Because we're not necessarily built for that type of thing.  But let's continue<br>
<br>
There was no system with Elder members mentioned.  That was simply saying &quot;If you said elder members were important, then you could have them have tags.&quot;  That's all.  This point is moot because it doesn't matter.<br>
<br>
Let's talk about what officers &quot;do behind the scenes&quot; as you say, and how any member would and could do that.<br>
<br>
Forums- what I gather from this, is that you're saying only officers have the ability to work HTML and set up a page or a broadcasting system for the guild.  I could make a forum for the guild, if you really want to.  All I have to do is go to MSN.  I could even manage it.  That doesn't necessarily mean I'm an officer of the guild.<br>
<br>
E-mails- if everyone sent out a welcome e-mail to everyone, it would be much better than one person sending a welcome e-mail, at least it's more welcming =).  Why can't a normal person do this, is that illegal?  How many people do *you* know of that *aren't* officers and don't send welcoming e-mails.  Another thing that you don't need an officer for.  Besides, half the time no one knows whether or not someone is new or an alt.  If you need an officer for that then they haven't been on top of it.<br>
<br>
Guildmotd- The person who made the guild, of course.  If you need more, than give everyone the power to change it.  How come only officers are the ones who can set raids or motd up.  Doesn't everyone have something important to say?<br>
<br>
Invite- Once again, name everyone an officer and you don't have &quot;officer powers.&quot;  This is merely an issue of getting past the coding.  If you need specific rules before someone can join, set those down.  You've got it.  That way you dont have a bunch of random people joining and leaving.<br>
<br>
Exterior Relations- Anyone holds relations, you admit that when you threaten to kick those who dont follow GCP.  You dont need someone special for this, that's rediculous.  You especially don't need someone special to set up a raid.  It's that mindset that I hate.<br>
<br>
Back to Forums- Starting with the quote &quot;We hash out the details of said topic and THEN give it to the guild for more input.&quot;  Didn't the Nazi's do the same thing with their media.  And the Russians too?  Doesn't mean it's necessarily a good/safe idea.  You don't let people touch the juicy parts.<br>
<br>
Now you say that officers dont have much power, but you know that's not necessarily true.  Even Deloit admitted this.  It's an implied power.  People will more naturally believe an officer over anyone else.  The same is with your &quot;intra guild&quot; relationships.  <br>
<br>
The fact is, in most points you give, Athame, an officer is *not* necessary for that particular role.  Anyone can do that.  They just feel restricted because you have the officer tag *outside* of the game.  If everyone in the guild had it, you wouldn't have the invite problems, the guildmotd problems, and everyone would be equal.  Right?<br>
<br>
And once again, I apologize when I say AoL doesn't go on raids.  I dont mean they never do, I mean they dont raid every night, every day, and they really can't do powerful raids.  Unless you'd like to correct me by doing plane of air, if any of you are flagged for that.<br>

That's rediculous.  Not all officers know what they're doing.  My brother left the guild because he was deemed a raid leader on a specific raid and an officer of AoL told him to shut his trap and listen. Funny, he knew the guy that was leading the raid and was also following *his* direct orders.  You see my point?  Had the person not been an officer, they wouldn't have told him to &quot;be quiet and listen&quot; (when he didn't need to he was doing his job) and he wouldn't be out of the guild (well, yea he would because he reached 50... but that's different)<br>
<br>
If you honestly follow the mindset that an officer must be a raid leader than you only feed my position.  I'm not saying you do it Athame, I respect you a lot as an officer, but can you account for every officer in the guild when I say &quot;some abuse their title?&quot; I dont think so. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A0B0E0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub66.ezboard.com/bthearrowoflightcommons.showUserPublicProfile?gid=meowkatdarklingborn>Meowkat Darklingborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#000080>(6/9/03 6:19 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Thread Deletion</span><hr size=1> Sorry for the spam, by the way, but I also forgot to mention my specific reason.<br>
<br>
I feel that Ariaya over extended her powers as an officer, or maybe as a normal person. <br>
<br>
I asked in guild if anyone could help me with a transfer.  I needed to get 800 pp to Jerika, but Meowkat was in a dangerous place and didn't want to hurt anyone, so I asked if I could snag the 800pp to make the trade I was going to engage in, and Xeno said he'd have no problem with it.  I thanked him.  While he was camping, Ariaya starts in on me asking question after question about what my trade was going to be and why I needed the money. <br>
<br>
That puts me in a very bad position for the type of person I am.  I love people, but only when I want to.  And I don't feel like I have to explain myself to someone.<br>
<br>
Now, had I said to Ariaya, &quot;What I do with the money is my business and the person who is letting me snag it until I can get Meow out&quot; I would have been put up for a &quot;questioning&quot; type of circumstance of being rude to Ariaya.  Instead, I basically felt I had to persist through her questions that I dont want to answer.  No, I dont trust Ariaya and feel like I have to explain myself to her.  I don't know her, and just because she has a tag doesn't mean I should have to tell her what's going on.  In fact, I never signed anything that said that.  That's why it's a bad position.  I had three options- answer her questions for no reason what so ever and feel pushed around, not answer her questions in a rude manner, or avoiding getting people upset with one another because of what happened and avoiding getting kicked for being rude to an officer by dropping out of the guild.  <br>
<br>
Sorry, that's the type of person I am.  If I've never been hunting with you or if you don't make a point to talk to me, I don't make it a point in my &quot;in game&quot; time to actually set about and try to make friends with you either.  <br>
<br>
I say deal with it.  Deloit says Ariaya was wrong.  But how could I have said that she was without being a jerk?  Instead, I dropped out.<br>
<br>
How's that for specifics?  Probably bad.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E6E8fA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub66.ezboard.com/bthearrowoflightcommons.showUserPublicProfile?gid=twoxenos>TwoXenos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Two Xenos!

I don't think its ok to say &quot;that's just the kind of person I am&quot;; I think we should all do our best to always treat others with thoughtfulness, even if they do not return the favor.<br>
<br>
As far as the raiding comments go, I have a few thoughts:<br>
<br>
1.  I would agree with the statement that we are not a raiding guild.  This doesn't mean that we don't host raids, just not 4 nights a week.  And I don't expect my /who guild all to ever show &quot;timea&quot; after anyone's name.<br>
  <br>
2.  This also doesn't mean that we don't raid with other guilds.  If you are interested in raiding more, being a member of AoL does give you a great outlet for raiding through the GCP.  It's true that we don't form up as a guild to join these raids; we let each member decide how often and where and with whom they want to raid.  You just need to take the initiative to sign up; Sytox has a very nice GCP FAQ stickied in the members forum, and there are four (4) GCP links at the top of the boards page.<br>
<br>
3.  To take a couple of your specific examples, I for one do raid with SS on a regular basis (generally at least once a week).  This coming Saturday I'll be joining them in the Plane of Air; I've been to Hate with them a number of times, and in fact I've even raided CT (another of your examples) with SS.  I'm not alone in this; most raids have people from a variety of guilds joining together to do things that we otherwise couldn't do.<br>
<br>
I know there were alot of other issues in your posts, but I think Athame has expressed my feelings adequately on most other counts.  Good luck to you. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=445044" target="top">Xenophon</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, 57 Paladin<br>

Had I said something to her, I would have jeopardized myself, and had I brought it to an officers attention, it would put her in a more awkward and  unnecessary position.  <br>
<br>
I still think it's the best thing to have done, since no one really cares that I'm out of the guild.  That way, she keeps her name and I keep my peace as well as those who are buds of mine. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E6E8fA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub66.ezboard.com/bthearrowoflightcommons.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tymoriabrightblade>Tymoria Brightblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mostly Fearless Leader</span><br>  Posts: 817<br> <font color=#000080>(6/9/03 8:26 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/Vienna/Choir/1240/icons/anime1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Thread Deletion</span><hr size=1> Well Meowkat, I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>am</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> sorry to see ye go, but it is quite obvios to me we are not gonna see eye to eye here.
