<br>
For those of you with a short attention span or those that didn't really know or care about me, this post is about my permanent retirement from Everquest. So have fun gaming, take care, live long and prosper and all of that. /salute<br>
<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
<br>
For those of you that considered me an on-line friend, read on for an explaination and I thank you for your patience.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Three years ago I was sort of a wayward soul and had a falling out with my University, and left my career track. I ended up doing all sorts of neat things from heading a research departmental arm to working in a club to promoting and getting gigs for bands. I considered this the 'three ring circus' era of my life because I was really exploring and going all over the place with my life.<br>
<br>
Durning this time I also stumbled into Everquest and from it I had gained a whole treasure trove of adventure, friendship, and emotions. In fact, in many ways I had gained an on-line family from most of you knights. Though I had maintained certain strict rules about separating on-line life with real life, some of you managed to slip in between the cracks. In some of you, I had come to learn and know more of the person behind the character then just the personality, in that we shared bits and pieces of our soul that filtered through the text of our tells messages. There was pain, joy, sorrow, comfort, and happiness among other emotions.<br>
<br>
So I do not regret discovering Everquest, I grew as a person from it, and in the end that's an amazing thing to gain from a simple game.<br>
<br>
But time and real life moves on, as a person I came to understand myself more readily, I came to understand what I wanted in life and what was needed to be done. I also was tired of living from pay-check to pay-check. So around the end of last year's winter I had set myself into motion to get back into the study of Law and in the end get a solid career practising Law. A career ...... Heheh I can't help but still feel a bit scared of the word.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, the summer was my 'make or break it' point in terms of mending my ties with my University, and it's looking really really good! So I'm back in the saddle again, unfortunately to make it really work there's little to no time for MMORPGs or Everquest. I had originally planned to keep on playing while studying, but retrospect that's just silly if I'm serious about my studies. With that I bid you all a fare thee well, and my thanks for the experience. However there are a &quot;few&quot; (relatively) personal good-byes I would like to make.<br>
<br>
In no special order:<br>
<br>
To the Knights of Freedom in general, you had consumed and gave me more or less two and a half years of adventure and gave me a place to call home in Norrath, for that I thank you. May the KoF lineage live on till they shut down Brell.<br>
<br>
To Alaene, if your reading this, though you no longer play... I must still thank you for your companion-ship, friendship and attention. In the bad times, you've endured my rants, petty thoughts, and character flaws as I grew, and yet you would still always speak to me the next day. For the good times, I will always remember Alaene, which is amazing for a 'toon considering we will never meet in real life. For me, Zimm/Senaan's time with Alaene was like a wonderful little EQ fairy tale with a happy ending, and I shall keep it at that.<br>
<br>
To Blanko and Sildaru. Sanky Blanko, I will send you that email, my apologies for the errr.. four month delay, but I will send it. Aside from that, if your reading this, take care of those babies of yours, and try to keep your sanity. Sildaru, I hope in the months since we last spoke, your ventures have been sound and to your liking; as they say, if first you do not succeed try and try again, you will eventually get what you want.<br>
<br>
To Leare. Dude! When your schooling starts, keep your nose to the books this time; if you feel like your will power is slipping get Wulf to buy you a pair of those race-horse blinders to keep you focus or get him to cuff you solid to get your attention on track, whichever he finds easier hehe. Take care good buddy.<br>
<br>
To Sonladily and Trabwen. Never lose that innocent enthusiasm that I admire in both of you. I mean it when I say I wish there were more folks like you two in this world, would be a better place.<br>
<br>
To Ediarn. Well mister, I don't know when you'll see this but... Even though your a yankee, I've always admire your courage, straight edge, spirit and honesty. In being a ranger or a teacher, you'll need all of those qualities, be safe buddy and lead the way always!<br>
<br>
To Kakras. Hey man, I might have given you a few headache, but that's why they pay you the big bucks right?! Right, hahahahaha. Anyhow, thank you for your patience, I don't know if anyone has ever really thanked you for the obscene amount of time and effort you place on the line for this guild, but here's my &quot;thank you.&quot; I remember long ago you mentioning how your wife is very 'un-keen' on you playing EQ, so all the more a thank you for when you've toed the line for us in the past.<br>
<br>
To Cueiena. May you find happiness and solid ground in your own career, once they let you become a civie again. Until that time, keep your head down and be safe, I mean it. /hug<br>
<br>
To Jezeb. /smile You were the one that introduced me to the knights, for that you have my thanks. For all those wonderful long chats we've had in the past, you get a hug. /hug Now, get healthy you, that's an order from an old pal. May the Fates smile on you and your baby, you deserve some happiness.<br>
<br>
To Dami. Though we never really got to know one another, thanks for not giving in on me when you did. You know what I'm talking about. Thanks bud.<br>
<br>
To Mortigan, Qralt, Abbs, and Alalas. You four are really old vets in the KoF, you've always been there for me when I've needed your support, without complaint or bother, true knights. My respects to both of you.<br>
<br>
To Paflin, your humor has helped the KoF through a lot. May you help lead the future knights with humor and honour.<br>
<br>
To Marita. I've always enjoyed our debates on ethics and philosophy. Perhaps one day when I've more time available, I will take that sound advice on travelling. As well, may own your studies be fruitful and solid.<br>
<br>
To Alliddaarr. When we spoke last, you were still settling in on civie life, I hope it has all agreed with you. I had enjoyed our little chats.<br>
<br>
To Nebnes/Senben. I hope you will find your way home soon and safely to your lady and child. Be safe in Korea if your still there, I've have always looked fondly on our past adventures and trials.<br>
<br>
To Rajinier. We've know each other for a long long time, past the KoF and so. I still remember that couragous monk of yours, volunteering to go where few others would dare in those days. /salute No matter what hair brain whine you've been on, you've always had my respect.<br>
<br>
To Lorinest/Darcadez. Yes, the same applies to you as well. Our past in EQ ran from the golden age of newbie-ism to where we are now. I've never really completed that suit of fine steel armour I intented to make for Darcadez, he got better by the time I was able to crafted him his armour, for that you have my apologies. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Take care buddy.<br>
<br>
To Thornnar. If your still reading these pages, strength and honour good sir, strength and honour.<br>
<br>
To those in my old night crews. Thank you for making those long nights fun... we did good!<br>
<br>
There's still more of you older knights I would say good bye to, but that would make this post enormously longer then it already is, my apologies if I missed you and thank you for the experience. <br>
<br>
/salute<br>
<br>
PS: Leare, or Sonladily. My EQ account will terminate on Sept. 6/03 I believe. Now the thing is, among varies alts, Senaan and Zimm, I think there's more or less about ~300 000 pp worth of equipment, depending on the state of the EQ market these days. There's very little liquid or cash assets, but there's a lot of droppable hard assets. When I get the time, I'll make an EQ will for the account in the officer's section and we'll get that all sorted through. If neither of you have the time to deal with it, no worries I'll figure something out, I just hate to see all that higher level gear go poof.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Zimmierus<br>

You write well, you have a clear sense of logic and you are a very honorable chap.  Nevertheless, I think you'll make a good lawyer.  I know a little about the Canadian system, and it's a good one - I hope you prosper within it, and even make it grow a little.<br>

We've been through a lot with this guild. I've said before that you were the primary force behind what the Knights of Freedom have become, and it's still very true. At the moment I can only be thankful that you've left us for a while before so we know that we can continue on without you. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
With your drive, your competence, and your focus, I'm sure that success will come to you like water flowing downhill. Just try not to bowl over too many people on the way.<br>
<br>
Good luck to you, and good luck to us without you, we'll need more of it.<br>

I can't thank you enough for your tireless contributions to the guild and your friendship. You really helped turn the KoF around when our existence looked grim due to a lack of leadership and some growing pains. Yours and Charcoth's direction helped revolutionize our guild into a formidable raiding force whose personal wants/needs were second to what was best for the guild. Many balked at this selfless ideal, but we did the right thing once the smoke cleared. There's no denying that fact and I thank you both for bulldozing the way. Our current status and guild membership attests to that.<br>
<br>
I am saddened by your permanent departure Senaan although I won't miss that twisted necro of yours much. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  EQ2 should be around for quite some time so look us up if you're in the neighborhood.

I'm glad for you finding your calling in real life. I certainly hope that if I'm ever in Canada and need a good lawyer, I'll be able to track you down. This is just a game, and your studies are so much more important.<br>
<br>
Thank you for all the energy and effort you've put into building the Knights of Freedom as a guild. There was a time there where I don't think we could have done it without you. You'll certainly be missed!<br>

You will be missed, not just for what your brought to the game but for who you are. I didn't get to spend much time with you in game but somehow, Necro = Lawyer = Necro makes sense. Best of luck to you on your journeys and life. The scarry part is that now I'm becoming one of the old members (not fair!) and I still feel that I don't know anything (nothing new there). <br>

Hasn't your Canadian Mountee School of Law at least introduced you to the ancient Greek concept of Arete?<br>
<br>
No?  Well let me esplain it to you.   Arete means excellence in ALL facets of life.  <br>
<br>
For example, were you to go to law school and succeed while balancing your time with a little EQ every now and then, you would;<br>
(1) not go insane, demented by the overanalysis of laws and the loopholes around them as the left side of your brain slowly and methodically choked out of existence all that was creative, spontaneous and interesting in the right lobe. A lobe which, continually shrinking into the tiniest, darkest corners of your immense yet finite cranial vault, could no longer find the light of stimulus that it once had in EQ to survive and flourish.<br>
<br>
(2) achieve a balanced state of existence tantamount to a conscious form of Nirvana.  Legal statutes Yin to AA abilities Yang, the very pinnacle of existence felt by a select few such as Eureka at precisely the moment when the bathwater hit the floor.  A state of Arete.<br>
<br>
You seem pretty set on this and I don't want to keep writing this post (I'm kinda jonesing for some EQ), so let me just close by saying, I'll miss you, whether the cross-eyed warrior or the shady necro.<br>
<br>
I learned a lot from you and teaching me anything is no small feat.  Playing with you and the night crew kept me way up past my bedtime on more than one occasion and I don't regret being a worthless bleary-eyed wretch at work the next day one tiny bit.<br>
<br>
Good fortune to you.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=339185">Alalas<br>

Reading all of this put me into a trance remembering the days back in south karana when I was insanely jealous of your huge orange garbage can helmet. From day one you always seemed to be someone who knew where he was in the world. In game and out. Someone with the uncanny ability to understand things. That really sets you apart from others in my mind. To me there are people, there are friends, there are really close friends, and there is Senaan. <br>
<br>
I have always valued you as one of my closest friends that I could count on to have an unbiased ear for whatever was on my mind at the time. Your thoughtful input at such times was more help than you know. More than I care to tell you, too =p<br>
<br>
I hope that ye olde University does you well and gets you on your feet and pointing in the direction you want to be going. You certainly have the drive for what you want, I know thats true. If your old job is open put in a good word for me, eh? I have no convictions about living paycheck to paycheck =D<br>
<br>
and lastly - hit me up at peanut@djpmix.com even if its just one blank email so that I can spam you with tearful &quot;I LOVED YOU&quot; and &quot;YOU HAVE MY BABY&quot; emails. <br>
<br>
I wish the best for the best<br>

I hope RL treats you well and that you recieve everything you attempt to gain.<br>
<br>
The largest part of my days playing EQ was as a Knight of Freedom.  I was/am very honored to have called you a guildmate.  I am even happier to have considered you a friend.<br>
<br>
Take care of yourself.<br>
