When: Sunday 6/22, 12pm PST, 3pm EST, 8pm GMT<br>
Where:  Meet in at South Gate in East Freeport<br>
Who:  anyone levels 35-50<br>
Why:  Training, Travel and XP<br>
<br>
Ok Ladies and Gents, I present this raid for our mid-level members.  I have several objectives:<br>
<br>
First, it is a good idea to experience some of the lands of Norrath other than the usual XP zones.  People should know how to get from point A to point B on foot, so that if they need to get somewhere they know how to do it all by themselves.  That is why I chose Freeport as the starting location.  We will go from East Freeport south thru North RO, Oasis, South Ro and into Innothuls Swamp, then into Guk.<br>
<br>
Second, Guk was one of my favorite dungeons of the old world.  It used to be &quot;The&quot; place to be, and there are quite a few drops there, although they don't hold a candle to anything that you can buy in the bazaar anymore.  The place still is a good place to farm fine steel weapons for platinum pieces (as are Sol A, Sol B and Mistmoore -- but those I will leave for antoher Raid).  Best of all, the mobs are pretty numerous and on a good timer (27 minutes?) so respawn usually isnt a problem.  That all equals out to good xp.<br>
<br>
Finally, training.  Some of our mid-level players have not had a chance to group with the higher level characters.  Added to that, some have advanced in levels VERY quicky (results of PLing or whatever, the situation is what it is) so may not understand tactics, roles, abilities, etc.  Nothing more frustrating for a chanter to try to do crowd control when nobody has an &lt;&lt; /assist &quot;Main Tank&quot; &gt;&gt; button programmed.  This event is designed to be a place where we can work on some of those things in preparation for the post-50 levels.<br>
<br>
I'll drop Mugo into the area to KEI the group (for those that it will stick on) or do C2 before we start, and Phaith will be near to drops some buffs on the group, but it will be STUMBLES (lvl 39 druid) that I will be bringing to the event.  That means limited heals and the necessity to take on mobs in the manner that a normal group of that level could tackle.  If we bite off more than we can chew, we will probably be doing evacs or corpse runs... just FYI.  We will certainly need at least 1 main tank, 1 enchanter/ess, Stumbles can heal but will not have a huge mana pool for it, and anyone else who fits the profile is welcome to join.<br>
<br>
Lets have fun with this!<br>

<br>
Not indicating this was directed towards any particular toons (thought obviously directed at an arrow or arrows). But I must say this. NO toons that I know of have been PL'ed in any shape form or fashion. And if some people level faster than others, or faster than some think they should, I say welcome to the new EQ (PoP, LoY, more and better xp zones).<br>
<br>
Maybe the new PL is gear? Toss some good gear on a toon and you can easily solo to 45 in no time. Especially if you have taken several toons to near that level and know exactly where to go and what level to go there.<br>
<br>
By the way, Legionnary has completed three quests that were not easy on top of his leveling to 47. And I might add that today he went in to GD killing giants with 4 other arrows today. Ya know what? He got a yellow at 47 in very little time. Maybe this isnt a case of PL'ing but a case of experience being shoved in our faces now.<br>
<br>
Just my two cents, I hate PL'ed toons and dont encourage it. And I think one person who loved it left the guild already. I jsut wanted to state my thoughts on it.<br>

<br>
  Being PL'd or gaining levels real fast or what EVER the hell happened or how it happened I DON'T CARE ANYMORE.  I am too damn tired to try to fight this and argue this with the world again and have people turn on me once more.  He is quite right when he said that gaining levels is VASTLY easier than it used to be.  Gear is uber, xp has changed, you dont have to go on CRs for your gear if you are level 10 or less, the bazaar is stock full of stuff to twink even the poorest newb.  Thus, my statment &quot;The situation is what it is&quot; -- that is todays EQ.  As far as putting in lots of time to get levels...  I will just bite my tongue on that one.<br>
<br>
I could go into quite a diatribe on this and peoples reactions to my post, but I am not going to.  This post is the announcement for a raid, not an attack on peoples playing styles.  This is not an attempt to politicize anything.  If you want to post stuff like that, take it to members forums.  If you want to comment on the raid, post here please.<br>
<br>
The raid has some objectives that I have stated and want to accomplish -- to get a little practice in for some, a little learning experience for others.  Hopefully fun for all.  We are not going to walk out of there with anything uber, just xp and hopefully some fun.  Thats all.  Dont expect more.<br>
<br>
If you can come, great.  If you can't, (/shrug) there will be more later.<br>
<br>

<br>
My intent wasn't to tick you off, if I did, I apologize. As to taking my posts to the member area, I still do NOT have access there. That isn't my fault. <br>
<br>
I'm still trying to learn as best I can wherever I can. I also apologize that my post was off topic. It's just I don't really &quot;know&quot; hardly any of the arrows, nor they I, and thought I'd give some information on what I've done including a couple of really stupid things. But I did make a poor choice on when and where I decided to share it. Few of the arrows have played with me, so as far as time spent playing, I guess only I know how much time that is, even if I was still level 15 for this whole time. What I was trying to convey is that I haven't just played a couple of hours here or there and I have tried to work for my experience (in this &quot;new eq&quot;) rather than let others do it for me, not that anyone has said anything to me to the contrary directly, just didn't want folks wondering. I never intended to say it wasn't harder before all the changes or that levels didn't take a whole lot longer. I was just trying to say they haven't come for me easy or handed up on a silver platter, though to those that remember how it used to be, maybe it is that way now. I have no history with eq to say. <br>
<br>
&quot;Turning on you&quot; was the very last thing I tried to convey, however, I will say, that bringing up the pl issue in your original post was probably off topic and I see is a pet peeve of yours that I will try my best not to irritate again if at all possible. It doesn't really matter how, some of us are just plain inexperienced whether it be level 10 or 65, and I have no delusions about being one of them and remaining one of them for quite some time regardless of the level of my toon ;-)<br>
<br>
Lastly I would have pm'd this to you, not that I mind one whit publicly apologizing to anyone I feel has one coming, but it is also &quot;off topic&quot; and your inbox is disabled, or was. All I can do is as I have, apologize and hope you understand I wasn't trying to get on you, but share what I've done and seen so a few may have more insight into that, but you're right it was the wrong place for that.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E6E8fA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub66.ezboard.com/bthearrowoflightcommons.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ariaya>Ariaya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>PhP Officer</span><br>  Posts: 756<br> <font color=#000080>(6/22/03 10:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=9>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Lower Guk Raid - SUn 6/22</span><hr size=1> I would like to encourage any and all Arrows who can to come to this raid.  <br>
<br>
Lower Guk is a great place from the little that I've seen, and Mugo knows it very well so we've got a good guide.<br>
<br>
It is easy to level quickly in this game and it's easy to level to 50+ without ever learning the basics of raiding.  I've seen some level 55+ folks that scare me on raids.  <br>
<br>
So come out ... learn a thing or two and have fun!<br>
<br>
See you in Freeport!<br>

<br>
Stumbles (Mugo) did a wonderful job of coordinating and keeping us on task.  I had such a fun time!!  <br>
<br>
Hadn't been into LGuk but once before in my EQ life, so it was an experience for me, to say the least....just glad I didn't get lost.<br>
<br>
So thanks to you Stumbles!!!  A fun time was had by all.<br>

Stumbles did a great job leading us in and directing us on what to do and where to go and kept control of the group and kept us safe.<br>
Would like to see more of this type of events. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E6E8fA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub66.ezboard.com/bthearrowoflightcommons.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mdntavengr>MdntAvengr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arrow of Light</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#000080>(6/24/03 6:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Lower Guk Raid - SUn 6/22</span><hr size=1> Yes, Stumbles kept it very organized and informative as to what was coming up next, different mobs and what they drop. Lot of knowledge and insight. Did a nice job rotating around newer people into various roles too. Made sure I didn't get left behind with my vid card &quot;handicap&quot; too. Was most appreciative. Thanks for having me along. <br>
