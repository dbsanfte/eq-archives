<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">The story of Tymoria Brightblade is a simple one really.</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
<br>
She started out a somewhat timid ranger lass from Surefall Glade, minding her guild master carefully, killing gnolls where she found them and hunting all but wolves and bears. <br>
She very much disliked Black Burrow and rarely endeavored to hunt inside the filthy dark place, but chose instead to hunt the Gnoll Watchers outside of the caves. Keeping the gnolls inside blind to the happenings of the world in this way was quite satisfying for her. <br>
<br>
<br>
Slowly acquiring money doing this she managed to buy her first set of Banded armor and was very proud of herself, but as a ranger of the 10th circle she still had only her practice blade. She dreamed of doing greater harm to her foes and of finding a mentor other than Hager Sureshot. For although he was wise, he was not much for simply sharing the events of the day and wasnt much for companionship. <br>
<br>
<br>
So it was one day that she came upon some grief in the Western plains of Karana and was running bare as the day she was born from the Qeynos Hills to Western Karana to retrieve her gear when a kind ranger woman stopped her to see if she needed aide. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh,&quot; said she, <br>
&quot; I simply need to go get my gear from the guard tower and continue hunting friend, something I believe I can manage without TOO too much difficulty so long as I dont run into the rather aggressive cats of the plains on the way.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
She then prepared to do just that when the kind ranger woman began to cast a spell upon her, Spirit of the Wolf! Her feet would FLY the distance! <br>
Then the kind ranger said, <br>
&quot; I will escort you to your gear, if it isnt too far then it is surely along my way anyway, I wouldnt want you to come to grief, and it is really no trouble,&quot; <br>
<br>
and so, the two ranger women, one young lass and one more seasoned woman headed off to collect Tymoria's gear. <br>
<br>
<br>
Ahh, but once her gear was back where it belonged, the ranger woman wanted to take a look at Tymoria's sword! Quite mortified that so great a ranger as this would see her poor excuse for a blade, Tymoria extended the blade for Merani to see. Upon seeing such a pitiful blade in the girl's hands, instead of scornfully ridiculing the blade, she handed her a much larger and difficult to handle blade, a two hander in fact! Upon examining it Tymoria realized that this was a Sarnak Ceremonial Sword! <br>
<br>
<br>
A great sword for so lowly a ranger she thought, and thanked her benefactor thoroughly and well. She also mentioned how dissatisfied she was without a family and mentor to turn to and how she wished she could find a guild to call home, to wich the Lady replied, <br>
&quot; You wish to be part of a guild?&quot; <br>
An eager nod, <br>
&quot; Well then! I am one member of a very new and exciting guild called the Arrow of Light! We believe in helping one another and all confused or stricken individuals of Norath! Would you be interested in calling our guild your home?&quot;<br>
<br>
Overwhelmed, Tymoria gushed her approval and agreed to wait for her new mentor to contact her with the guildleader for her formal invitation into the Arrow of Light. <br>
<br>
<br>
The story of her journey to meet this Guild Master is certainly a long and harrowing one, to be told later when you have the chance to prepare for it better. <br>
<br>
<br>
So now, with a Guild, and with a new and beloved mentor, Merani, Tymoria went forth into Norath with renewed vigor to smite the evil creeping across the land. There were many things she learned then, including fletching, but that, my friends, is yet another story for another day . . . . ..<br>

The Journey Home<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>We resume our story to tell the tale <br>
of Tymoria's journey to meet <br>
Aydrian Silverain,<br>
Guild Leader of The Arrow Of Light</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
After many weeks of waiting and hoping she was seen as good enough to join such a wonderus sounding guild as The Arrow Of Light, Tymoria finnaly grew too large in her skills for the small world of her home in Qeynos. She tentatively asked a friend wizzard of twenty some odd seasons named Deloit to aid her in crossing the Karanas, for although she was adept at avoiding the dangers of West Karana, she knew that North Karana would surly be too much for her. Deloit said that she would have much luck meeting new people and fighting for good in a land called The Oasis of Marr, there was a terrible orc problem there that needed quelling and to this day despite the efforts of many, they still thrive in that highway of evil. <br>
<br>
<br>
Agreeing to try out this new prooving ground, Tymoria began the journey there with Deloit. First and foremost Deloit cast a spell of invisibility on her, she would be far too tempting a morsel for the evil plagueing thier route. <br>
<br>
<br>
The journey through the Karanas went fairly without event, they crossed many strange and unknown creatures to Tymoria, Griffawns and several varieties of gigatic and fearsom spiders that she simply did not want to contemplate doing battle with.<br>
<br>
<br>
along her way, she was contacted by Merani! (Merani had slowly gained a god-like respect from Tymoria by now, being such an experienced and worldly ranger) Tymoria and Merani were able to hold a short conversation along her way through the Karanas and decided to meet at the edge of the Forest of Kithicor, where Merani would take over escorting Tymoria and bring her not to the Oasis, but to Aydrian Silverain in the Lavastorm Mountains; several fearsom sounding locations to Tymoria's mind, but for now she had Deloit to protect her and later would have Merani, so no need to too worried yet.<br>
As Deloit and Tymoria approached the edge of Kithicor they saw Merani standing there waiting for them and while they waited for daytime to come, (wich was impossible for Tymoria, she could not understand HOW one could tell time in such a smog) they aquanted themselves with each other and there was a flurry of mutualy benificial spell casting between Merani and Deloit. Tymoria was able to add her Feet Like Cat spell to the mix, but with two such mighty companions felt it was much like a mere drop of water in a great lake! When Tymoria inquired as to why they had to wait for &quot;daybreak&quot; Merani and Deloit gave a shiver and replied that she did not want to know, simply do not ever travel there from dusk to dawn, for peril of your life. <br>
<br>
<br>
Well this was quite enough information to give our young ranger a fluttering tummy for the rest of that harrowing journey to the other side of this fearsom forest. She could not stop looking over her shoulder and was frantic not to lose Merani in the murk. <br>
<br>
<br>
Well eventualy they found rest as they broke into the Western Commonlands. This place still held dangers, but in the light of day for real at least. So, staying invisible, she and Merani traveled from the West Commonlands to the East, and there they met thier next challenge. . . . Nektulos Forest, playground of the Darkelves.<br>
<br>
<br>
In this dark and frightening land, Merani made double sure that not only Tymoria, but she too, were both invisible for the journey. For although Merani enjoys nothing more than to kill Dark elves, Tymoria was not yet old enough for the task and going into such a battle unpartnered may as well have been suicide plain and simple. I will not speak of the creatures they came oacross, they are too frightfull to make an accruate account of without inducing you to nightmares forevermore. But there were several occasions where the young ranger girl thought they had met thier end to be sure. <br>
<br>
<br>
Finaly they passed out of the forest and into a craggy pass leading into the Lavastorm Mountains. At last! There was a figure waiting for them in the pass in striking blue armor and, amazingly enough, a half elven countenance! Merani stepped up to him and exchanged words and an embrace. She then turned about slightly and said to him, &quot; Aydrian, this is Tymoria, a young ranger I met some time ago in West Karana, she niether looked for nor expected help or reward when we met, but gladly accepted both, and today has made the harrowing journey from Qeynos to meet you here tonight. She never doubted or hesitated on any leg of this long run, I believe her to be propor material for our young guild. What say you?&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
There were much gestures and jests made by Aydrian that at the time, Tymoria simply could not take in, she was in awe of seeing this warrior, who to her spelled certain death if she were to cross him, and yet seemed so jovial and kind hearted. She had never met the like on Norath. <br>
<br>
<br>
So it was with much gentle teasing of thier shy young recruit that Aydrian Silverain formaly invited Tymoria into the fold of the Arrow of Light! At first there was simple too much going on all of a sudden to comprehend! There were so many voices in her head it seemed far too crowded to hold them all!<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>This story picks up after <br>
Tymoria's meeting with <br>
Aydrian Silverain and Merani.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> </div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--> <br>
<br>
The couple escorted Tymoria out of Nektulos Forest back to the Commonlands and on to the city of Freeport. Upon reaching the bank in Freeport she was introduced to a great pillar of a barbarian named oddly enough. . . Bangoo! With a great chuckle and a charming highlands accent he greeted Tymoria warmly and with open arms; and Great Karana what large arms they were! After asking politely to take the liberty of inspecting her gear, he pronounced that she was not using a bow fit for a ranger, and handed her a new one. She had never dreamed of such a bow! Much less thought she would ever own one it's like! It was called a Shaped Darkwood Compound Bow; this bow had such a range to it that Tymoria could barely see the evil she shot at! <br>
<br>
<br>
Well from there the great man took her out to the dessert of Ro for some training such as she had always wanted! He explained tactics and strategy and such to her, things that always had been a mystery to her, he explained at last. It was the most fun she had ever had. He would venture out into the great desert and find some gruesome insect or another for her to kill, after deciding if it was enough of a challenge for her, he let her have at it with a vengence . . .ahhh a grand time was had in Ro that day! <br>
Throughout the battles, during periods of rest and recovery, she would listen to, and occasionally contribute to, the conversations of her new guild. It happened that Merani wondered weather Tymoria had begun her fletching yet. So wondering, she asked her. Tymoria replied that no she hadn't, the arrows sold at the merchants stall in Surefall Glade had always been sufficient when she could afford them. Well obviously Merani was shocked at the least! <br>
&quot; Any ranger worth her salt fletches Tymoria, it is by far THE most useful skill you can learn as a ranger! Why the bow you now carry may only be had by way of making it!&quot; <br>
Oh! Well put that way, and by her beloved mentor no less, what choice did she have? Besides this, she thought that to be able to make such a weapon would make her the happiest ranger alive! So she found her way to the fletching merchant in the Eastern Commonlands, after finally figuring out how to stuff her ears deaf to the raucous calls of people buying and selling their wares, why there were well over a hundred of them! She decided it would probably be a good idea to just grab twenty bundles of the cheapest version of each component and head to the Freeport bank to dust off her fletching kit and get started. <br>
<br>
<br>
So began the long trials and platinum burning tribulations of Tymoria's new trade. She spent most of her time either clearing the wretched orcs from the Orc Highway in Oasis or in that same merchants hut feverishly making arrow upon arrow upon arrow. Eventually; many, many seasons later; after a particularly nasty day in the Lake of Ill Omen, (her new hunting ground) She gave up on fighting entirely and committed herself to fletching. She had already achieved Master status, but she craved the title of Grandmaster like none other. <br>
<br>
<br>
Then there came a time that her guildmates began to despair that Tymoria would do anything but fletch and sell bows and arrows. All her hunting partners had already surpassed her in experience and it seemed she would never leave the merchant's life behind her and live the life of a ranger born. Finally one hot sunny day in the Eastern Commonlands, her fellow Arrow the dark elven mage Jojen passed by and began to converse with her. He had hunted with her merely once or twice, but they had had tremendous fun during those hunts and he missed her. He tried to figure out why she chose to shun adventure for fletching, clearly baffled by the whole situation. <br>
<br>
<br>
So it was that Tymoria confided in him her longing to attain the title of Grandmaster Fletcher. Nothing thrilled her more than to see a finished bow almost appear in her hands as if by magic and know that her hands were the ones that had crafted it. She had been given so much by the Arrows that she wanted to have a skill she could contribute to her small guild with. For at her experience of a mere twenty some odd seasons, she could not truly pay back the favors for quite some time to come. She simply was not capable of killing worthy enough foes to attain riches enough, nor could she afford to simply buy them trinkets or pay the favors in cash. He was surprised to say the least. He reminded her that nobody expected her to pay them back when bestowing these items upon her. She replied that yes, this is true, but she felt honor bound to do so none the less. <br>
<br>
<br>
At that point their conversation drifted to her craft and the cost of gaining skill in this trade. Tymoria, thinking that Jojen had at last been satisfied with her answers, answered everything Jojen asked as well as she knew how. He finally asked casually how much coin she thought it would take before she could attain the title of Grandmaster. She thought for a bit, and slowly replied that it would probably cost close to one thousand pieces of platinum, give or take a couple hundred pieces. Hearing this, Jojen stood and asked her to wait for a few minutes while he checked his bank. He thought he might have something that would aid her in her endeavor. Finally he returns saying that she would not be able to use the item he had planned on giving her, but that he had another thing that would probably help even more! Eagerly she asked him what that could be. No sooner had the words left her mouth then Jojen took her hand and closed it around a pouch that crackled like paper. She pulled it open curiously and gasped in shock at what she found there. A bank note redeemable for one thousand pieces of platinum! <br>
&quot;Great Karana!&quot; She thought, &quot;this is far too much!&quot; <br>
She then said as much to the grinning Dark elf, he simply said,<br>
&quot; All I ask is that you use this to achieve grandmaster status and then go out to experience life! I would love to go hunting with you again, but the game I hunt now is far to dangerous for you until you become more experienced. promise me this, and the money is yours gladly!&quot;<br>

She stood in shock while he calmly walked on to his original destination and arranged for the first teleportation to North Karana she could find. She had to get to Surefall Glade so she could put this money to its best use possible; she always got wonderful treatment from the merchants there. <br>

Tymoria's first great deed.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> </div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
<br>
One Day, after having been away from Qeynos for far more time than she wished to contemplate; Tymoria decided it was finally time to visit home again. She caught a teleport from a kind wizard to North Karana and ran the rest of the way to the Qeynos Hills. <br>
<br>
Upon reaching the hills, she spied Tovax Vmar and his skeletal pet walking by, evils surrounding them like a shroud. Vmar had cost her much in her younger years, and continued to do the same to other fledgling rangers after she left. Tymoria decided he had had enough fun at others expense. She easily dispatched him and his pet, no epic battle to go into here for certain! She felt greatly satisfied to have given him back some of his own, but with honest bladework. <br>
<br>
She then walked to Surefall Glade to visit with Hager Sureshot, her Guildmaster and former mentor. He was, as he always seemed to be, at the archery range practicing. While relaxing in the glade, she came upon a friend she had met in her earliest years! After much back slapping and exchanging of news, Tymoria sat down to fletch up some arrows for her supplies while he began to practice his spell casting. <br>
<br>
Tymoria saw the spell he cast and was unfamiliar with it. Eventually, curiosity got the better of her and she inquired which spell it was he was casting. He replied that it was the spell Dance of the Fireflies of course! She was surprised he wasted such time on such a disadvantageous spell. It was far more mana efficient and practical to simply carry a Greater Lightstone was it not? Surprise written plainly on his face, he informed her that he was not casting it for use of the fireflies, but to practice his conjuration skills. He being of thirty seasons, he now had a useful conjuration spell and had no actual skill in conjuration. Far easier, he said to practice with the lesser spell than the greater. Tymoria blushed in embarrassment for not thinking of something like that. She had never even purchased the spell due to its uselessness! Imbued with an urgency to raise her conjuration skills before she became thirty, she rushed to purchase Dance of the Fireflies and headed for Qeynos to take care of some banking. <br>
<br>
Some time later, Tymoria stood in a shadowed niche to the side of the Qeynos gates and practiced her spell as quietly as possible. Lately, as her gear had improved, young adventurers had taken to begging from her, she had little enough money for herself, and did not want to have to tell the poor dears no so often. During her practice she noticed a strange man was shouting something she could not quite hear, except that he desired aid in righting a great wrong, but would go to fix it himself if none from Qeynos would help him. Her curiosity and home city pride pricked, she emerged from her niche to find him and see what was happening. A man in a full suit of sparkling, silver plate armor stood at the gates. He implored people there to come and help him in his quest. Tymoria approached the man and asked him who he was and what help he required. He replied that his name was Vegalys Keldrane and he had been put in charge of investigating the plague of the Karanas. He said he had been informed of a farmer there by the name of Jansen who mysteriously had flourishing crops amid the foul mist and diseased lands. Vegalys was going to find out how this was possible and wished aide in the journey in case of trouble. Tymoria told him that certainly she would help! She was a worshiper of Karana and would see the plains cleansed, if this man had a cure they needed to find out what it was! <br>
<br>
Finally Vegalys could wait no longer and took Tymoria and two others with him through the Karanas to the farmer they sought, the journey was fraught with rabid animals of all shapes and sizes. Several times along the way it was needful to mercifully end an animal?s life out of pure pity for the addled creatures. With the aid of Tymoria's tracking abilities and Vegalys' knowledge of the Karanas they finally found farmer Jansen and his property. As reported, his crops flourished! They had passed countless other fields that had rotted and died, yet this one crop stood firm against the plague! Vegalys began questioning farmer Jansen with the three volunteers' aid and it was slowly becoming apparent that something was up. Vegalys left to search the property for anything suspicious while leaving the three to continue the questioning. <br>
<br>
During his absence the farmer became more and more nervous, stammering and evading questions, looking around nervously. Vegalys returned with nothing unusual to report. . .yet. . .there was something odd about this farmer. . . . The four questioners bombarded the man with questions and consulted one another until it was decided that of all things. . it was his hat that was the most unusual. He was asked to remove it, and when he did not, Vegalys made him take it off. All four questioners stepped back, uttering exclamations of shock! The farmer had the brand of the Bloodsabres on his forehead! <br>
<br>
Now clearly marked as a collaborator he began to crumble and tell them all he knew. The bloodsabres had promised him that if he buried their artifact in his soil his crops would flourish if he but aided them in their evil doings. Finding the offer too tempting to resist, he agreed, but later became nervous of his new friends. He sent his family across the Serpent Spine Mountains to keep them safe and knew nothing of what may have happened to them since. Vegalys turned to his fellow questioners and asked what they thought should be done with this man. After some deliberation it was decided that the farmer should be remanded to the Temple in Qeynos to aid in discovering how his artifact had held back the plague. <br>
<br>
Once all was done, Vegalys turned to his helpers and rewarded them for their aide, to one young druid, he gave enough money to buy his next circle of spells, one more got coin, upon turning to Tymoria though, he had no coin to give, but a token. He handed Tymoria a Token of Bravery for her aide in this endeavor, saying only that she should give it to Jaylia the Faithful for a gift worthy of her aid that day. Halfway home to Qeynos Tymoria was struck all of a sudden by a summoning!<br>
<br>
When she opened her eyes again she found herself in front of Jaylia the Faithful and stood a moment in stunned wonder at her mode of transport. She then walked up to Jaylia and after a bit of conversation handed her the token saying that Vegalys had told her to hand it over to Jaylia. At that moment Tymoria was given the greatest honor of her life as Jaylia stepped forward and shouted for all of Qeynos to hear, &quot;Hear ye, Hear ye! Recognize now that you hold a hero of great worth and valor among you! Tymoria has been proven in the eyes of the gods! As within the mortal realm, this name shall be known within the eternal halls of the Realm of Heroes!&quot;<br>
<br>
Jaylia then handed a soft, silken bundle to Tymoria with a kind smile. Unfolding the bundle, Tymoria gasped at discovering it was a veil of incalculable worth! &quot;It is the Silken Veil of Lyrae young one&quot; stated Jaylia warmly. Tymoria donned the veil proudly, displaying it for Vegalys and her companions with excitement. &quot;Not till the day I die will I remove this precious gift!&quot; she exclaimed with bright tears of joy in her eyes. <br>
<br>
And to this day, she still wears it with pride, caring not weather she could earn or purchase one of greater usefulness, but content in knowing the personal accomplishment it represented. For some time later, the artifact she had helped to find did in fact help to banish the cursed plague from the plains forever. In the end, she may not regard this day as her greatest deed, but it will always be remembered as her first. <br>
