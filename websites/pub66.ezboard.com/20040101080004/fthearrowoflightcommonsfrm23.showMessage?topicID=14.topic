(Pt. 8)</span><hr size=1> [This is the conclusion to the first Volume of Garomtel's History of the Arrow of Light. Don't read this chapter till you've read Part 7: Lighting the Arrow]<br>
<br>
<br>
WE ARE BORN!!<br>
<br>
Almost simultaneous with Montag’s departure, another brave Paladin reappeared.  This was Famaldar.  I had heard much of Famaldar’s good works through Merani and Wychlea, but it was not until this time in history that we had met.  He and I had become quite fond of the Lake of Ill Omen area – with destruction of the Sarnak being a favorite goal. <br>
<br>
The morning on THE date arrived.  The day that our guild was to be formed!  Famaldar and myself had overslept and found ourselves in the distant elven outpost of Firiona Vie.  Word reached us that our meeting place was to be, of all places, Lesser Faydark.  <br>
<br>
Perhaps Jaron, or Aydrian could shed some light on why this dangerous place was chosen.  I haven’t a clue!  At any rate, Famaldar and I booked passage on the sailing ship, The Maiden Voyage, out of Firiona Vie and were on our way to the meeting.  Very soon, we would be Founders 9 and 10 of our guild, and the circle would be complete. <br>
<br>
As our ship entered the vast Timorous Deep, a storm tossed the vessel.  Thick fog shrouded the sea around us.  We trusted that the ship’s captain knew these seas without the guidance and certainty of his eyes.  We trusted that the gale force winds were themselves a familiar part of this perilous voyage.  If only my OWN instincts had been so certain… <br>
<br>
At my guidance, Famaldar and I hopped off the ship and onto a shuttle.  The Maiden Voyage disappeared into the thick fog.  Within minutes we would spot the friendly shores of the Butcherblock Mountains.  Our friends would not be waiting long.  Only… we did NOT spot the shores of Butcher.  <br>
<br>
Instead, our shuttle came to dock at an eerily abandoned Elven outpost.  Uh oh.  This was wrong.  Totally wrong.  I had directed us to the wrong shuttle!  I had made this error before and knew it would be quite a while before the sailing ship would return.  <br>
<br>
Famaldar and I were late… and were going to be even LATER.  I apologized profusely to Fam.  He just laughed it off while I felt awful.  I believe it was Jaron who sent word to us of another option… that we MIGHT be able to make our meeting on time after all.<br>
<br>
There existed a place...  a place of legend at the bottom of the ocean.  Indeed, by tales told, it was a chamber of ancient magic at the bottom of the world itself.  Within this chamber, one had the power to transport themselves to any city in Norrath.  Famaldar and I discussed it briefly.  The ocean was vast.  There were sharks.  There were blood thirsty Raptors, creatures who, if you could see THEM, they could see YOU and you were lunch!  We would be FOOLS to try and swim to this mythical place.<br>
<br>
What can I say… we were fools.<br>
<br>
I camouflaged us, cast Enduring Breath, and into the sea we went.  Swimming south as fast as we were able.  We quickly realized that Famaldar was trailing, unable to keep up. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “What’s the matter?” I asked him.  “Didn’t you ever learn to swim?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Something’s wrong.  I’m moving too slow,” he said, then realizing why he was so tired.  “It’s my armor!”<br>
<br>
And so it was.  Fam’s heavy mail made him sink like a stone.  He needed to rest before continuing, but resting while treading water was no rest!  The poor guy could barely move.  I surfaced and looked for land.  The storm had cleared but only water stretched as far as my one eye could see.  We could not go forward.  But we’d come too far to go back.  <br>
<br>
Jaron sent word to us.  “Be careful of the dragon.”<br>
<br>
Oh what a fine mess!<br>
<br>
After resting at the bottom of the sea for a bit, I brought out a Restoration spell I had never used.  Magically, it returned Famaldar’s stamina.  It seemed I had to cast it every other minute, but at least we were moving again.  With ENDLESS breaststroke, we seriously wondered if this place really existed.  We were the only people for miles and miles.  My tracking senses picked up strange creatures all around us.  Raptors, Golra, brigands.  I hoped we were not running straight into these beasts.<br>
<br>
Famaldar and I surfaced from time to time, scanning the horizon.  Fam spotted something.  “What’s that there?” he pointed.<br>
<br>
Strange pylons jutted out of the ocean to the distant east.  This was surely our destination.  Swimming down to the ocean floor, we found an opening beneath the pylons and dove in without hesitation.<br>
<br>
Much to our surprise, we tumbled out of the water, falling and landing hard on the floor of a great room.  There was no need to hold our breath, we were amazingly dry in this place.  The room was lined with firepots, each was the symbol of one of the many cities of Norrath.  THIS WAS IT!<br>
<br>
Famaldar and I congratulated ourselves on the successful journey.  We wished there was time to savor this adventure, but our guild could not be formed without the two of us.  We had to move quickly.  And now… which firepot was the one to Felthwith?<br>
<br>
Jaron had described it as a brown pot with eight sides.  He THOUGHT it was brown.  Another similar eight-sided pot was in the room as well.  What if it was THAT one?  We had already been cautioned… one of the two did not go to Felthwithe, but to Ogguk, the home of the Ogres.  <br>
<br>
Famaldar and I ran from one eight-sided pot to the other, hovering over them.  This was courage that had to be summoned.  Both would transport us to the other side of the world; one into the peaceful forest of Greater Faydark, while the other would deliver us to a bloody death at the hands of the Ogres!  Finally, we entrusted our lives to Jaron’s instincts and both touched the brown pot.  POOF!<br>
<br>
It was the first teleportation we had ever done without a caster.<br>
<br>
Famaldar and I quickly found ourselves alive and well near the Felthwithe guards.  It had worked!  We cheered each other on our success and quickly ran to join the others in Lesser Fay.  Mission accomplished.  The ten friends now stood together and waited for our christening.  <br>
<br>
It was not long before we were greeted by the sudden appearance of an Immortal.  His name was Oscarin, and he can still be seen traveling about Norrath this very day.  We kneeled before Oscarin with great respect and he surveyed our group.  Aydrian admired Oscarin’s weapon but seemed to think it lacking.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Is that your normal weapon?” he asked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes,” said Oscarin.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “No sparklies?”  Aydrian continued. “I was told there would be sparklies.”<br>
<br>
Perhaps I was alone in having no idea what was going on here.  What “sparklies,” let’s get this process started!  <br>
<br>
Oscarin put away his sword.  “You mean this?”  He reached into his backpack and brought out a brilliant silver blade.  A sparkling blue energy rippled from the hilt to the tip of the blade and back. <br>
<br>
Everyone’s jaw dropped.  A collective ‘ooh’ washed out of us.  What an incredible weapon!  As we all stood hypnotized by the beauty of this blade, Oscarin quickly got to business.  I’m sure he said some very profound words… I only wish I could remember them.  I was so enthralled with the events that had transpired, and the anxiety of what was to happen, I clearly blanked them out.  <br>
<br>
Aydrian kneeled before Oscarin and was dubbed leader of… “Arrow of Light.”   Cheers were muted.  We were speechless with the visible mark of our guild above him!  Aydrian stood proudly and, one by one, invited each of us, christening us all as members of the newest guild in all of Norrath.  <br>
<br>
A deafening cheer went up!  The dark forest of Lesser Fay resonated with our shouts of elation.  “THE ARROW OF LIGHT IS BORN!”  <br>
<br>
To have planned our guild’s creation SO long ago, and now see its mark a reality.  It was almost surreal.  Oscarin passed around delicious brew.  Unable to contain the moment, we danced the Bangoo, a dance that had long been the tradition of our friends.  <br>
<br>
For the record, the ten Founders present at creation were:  Aydrian the Warrior… Mugo the Enchanter… Wychlea the Wizard… Famaldar the Paladin… Versukas the Monk… Tumdiven the Shadowknight… Cervania the Wizard… Mulk the Good Ogre Ranger… Phildefer the Bard… and myself, Garomtel the Ranger.  [pictures still posted on the MSN board]<br>
<br>
Much like my journey with Famaldar through the vast Timorous Deep, our journey to form the Arrows was long, and filled with great effort, excitement and friendship.   And like that ocean journey, it had come to a close.<br>
<br>
But of course… this was not the END of our story at all, but its very beginning.  As one of the oldest guilds in our universe, The Arrow of Light was to have many new friends and adventures to come!  <br>
<br>
Speaking of that, there was this Ranger named Tymoria…<br>
