Wanted to tell you all a story. Not about me or <br>
one of you, but rather one i wrote during all those lonely hours of <br>
kyting. Which don't seem to work too well since i keep getting jumped <br>
on by unwanted add-ons. But a friend of mine says it gets better and <br>
better as you go up in levels, so i hope to level soon. Sigh. Anyway, <br>
here's my tale:<br>
               A crying rose, a bloody sword.<br>
Twas in the glade i met the boy, and he was not even twenty springs <br>
old that already the great tragedy had happened. He had fallen  in <br>
love. And like all men who saw her, he fell in love with the great <br>
mother tunare herself. But he was sworn to protect the lands, and <br>
priesthood was for him no way to express love. So he thought, how to <br>
impress a godess. As impossible as it was, as sure as the moon is <br>
kept apart from the sun, the two lived in different world. The lad <br>
was called a fool, his parents cried much over him, and all left him <br>
in his misery. But after two season`s worth of thinking, he started <br>
working on something that would express his  feelings to her, show <br>
her in a language she could understand and appreciate how much he <br>
cared for her. He set out for the frozen region of halas, where he <br>
fought and explored until, deep in the permafrost caverns, lair of <br>
the great dragon vox, he found a snow rose, rarest and most precious <br>
of tunare's flowers. He dealed with the giant servants of vox, and <br>
with the great dragon-lady herself so he could bring but seeds of <br>
them back home. Vox was hesitating between frying the imbecile and <br>
eating him in one gulp, so her aching stomach could stop growling at <br>
her. But then another part of her was aching, and that was her heart. <br>
She looked at this young, frail thing, so fragile and innoffensive. <br>
It had not killed her servants, and she saw in his eyes a love that <br>
matched the one in her burning heart. She asked but for one thing in <br>
return, that the first moon after his love was answered, if it was, <br>
he'd come back to serve her a month, to tend a replacement for the <br>
flower he killed to obtain seeds. He agreed, as it would show how <br>
much he followed lady tunare's wishes. Vox planned to eat him then, <br>
seeing it fitting punishment to make him win it all then lose it all, <br>
as the pain of his loss would equal her own loss when her fight with <br>
nagafen erupted centuries ago! He made a garden of the roses, and <br>
bloody red ones, and painted in roses a scene of tunare giving birth <br>
to his totem spirit: the hawk, a loner by nature, who unites to one <br>
female and stays united for life. It soars so high, no birds can near <br>
its altitude.<br>
Tunare wasn't impressed, even before his great work. She beamed him a <br>
smile, but gently reminded her she was a godess, sworn to eternity <br>
and loneliness, save for a godly lover, and that his role in nature <br>
as he was created by her was to unite and father children of his race.<br>
She blew him a last gift, out of pity. A plant grew on him, a magical <br>
suit of armor made of nature`s materials itself, and she instructed <br>
him to find the temple of solusek ro, so that he might give him the <br>
list of ingredients to create the new sacred armor his love created <br>
in her mind. It took him twelve days to locate the temple, as secrets <br>
were kept well in those days, but thanks to me and a few bard <br>
friends, we soon found the bottom of the dirt on its location. <br>
Amazing what a few glasses of ale and a quick lip can get out of <br>
people! So he soon was at the gates, asking to speak for the herald <br>
of great lord Ro. He was amazed to see lord Ro himself greet him, and <br>
tank him for creating yet a new secret for magic to expand upon. And <br>
he surprised further our young adventurer when he touched and blessed <br>
his bloddy sword, telling him that his sword would now be called <br>
Bloody rose. This unique sword was soon renowned for carving a bloody <br>
and wide path through the ranks of the ennemies of the rotectors of <br>
the glade. All withdrew in fear, for it appeared he found a boon to <br>
his sorrow only in bloodlust. Tunare appeared once again to him, but <br>
as soon as she appeared he tried to escape her sight, the sight of <br>
her being too much pain for his mortal heart to bear. He couldn't <br>
escape her of course, but still he ran faster and faster until he <br>
unwittingly ran past the ground's limit, he flew, then fell, and <br>
tunare, not thinking, jumped after him! She transformed into a <br>
bloodhawk, and he turned into one too, and soon they were flying <br>
together through the skies together. In what he thought, though <br>
fleetingly, as his mind was disappearing, was that this is what he <br>
always wished for, to sail through the skies with her, as a couple of <br>
bloodhawks, mated for life. Tunare heard his thoughts, and finally <br>
was her heart warmed, but as she glanced at him, she saw all the <br>
blood that stained his memories. She cried then, as she saw that all <br>
that blood was written in scars on his heart. She saw all the hurting <br>
she caused to this one man, and she wondered how many she wounded, <br>
and how much hurt she as much as this man. Yet none had reached her <br>
heart, none had created even an emotion as strong as worry, not even <br>
a god or a godling. How did this mortal reach her forbidden heart? <br>
For whoever won tunare would spell doom for all others. She was <br>
creator, she was mother to all living, to all that ever was alive! <br>
Even the undead, all were alive and under the mother's reign once! <br>
How could she reject me? thought our young hero! Life itself was <br>
rejecting him! He realized he was loving life itself, and how wrong <br>
it had been to destroy any of its components, how much of a lie his <br>
love was if it seemed to force him to destroy that which he loved, <br>
even if its corrupt nature caused him to revulse at its sight. But <br>
that all changed after he thought about it. And then he saw her as <br>
she was, caring about all, loving none, and he cried for her empty <br>
heart. His tears touched tunare, as he was flying higher, and touched <br>
by her tears, her empty heart filled. She coated his armor with her <br>
love, and he turned back into a human. He started falling and soon he <br>
was going down faster than the eye could see! But tunare again <br>
intervened, and this time she gave him the ultimate gift a great <br>
godess like her could give a man. A drop of veeshan`s blood! Though <br>
it was lost to history, brell's trickery made veeshan so angry that <br>
all gods had to unite to fight her and win. She attacked them, and <br>
they nearly lost their right to exist in that horrible battle. <br>
Luckily, veeshan too had been hurt grieviously! She evaded the wrath <br>
of the fledgling gods, and she made sure that they too remembered her <br>
claws and her wrath! She had left them her blood, and whatever god <br>
drank some in his foolishness (time itsef lost name of him) lost his <br>
immortality. But the keeper of secrets, one who's name stays hidden <br>
even now, showed the other gods that whatever was mortal which drank <br>
her sacred blood GAINED immortality, and then would be enslaved to a <br>
god in the name of her sacred wrath. For whoever claimed a wound, a <br>
blood drop from her, would be bounded and forced to be a slave. Thus <br>
none was safe from veeeshan's revenge (the previously mentioned god <br>
was said, in lores forgotten save by Marr himself, was forced to <br>
serve the first human king. It was him who led to their downfall.), <br>
so it was said. She made him drink the blood, and he swore servitude <br>
to her and only her. Until time itself forgot it existed, and so was <br>
born the vows tradition asks of fiancés to make! I saw my young <br>
friend but ounce after that, and he told me that story, so it <br>
wouldn't be forgotten. I am old, and yet he's still young as the day <br>
i met the young lad. His name was for the record, ....<br>
<br>
And that was all i could transfer from the scroll of this old bard, <br>
second in the lineage of my line, found in the bottom of the cavern <br>
of permafrost, as it seems my ancestor accompanied this fellow to <br>
permafrost cavern, to fullfill his debt to Lady Vox. I doubt she ate <br>
him, and i hear from powerful spirits he still serves tunare up to <br>
this day in her retreat, serving and loving her both, as she returns <br>
his love and now shares that love to all that exists. His tears <br>
became those that fall on me as i tell the tale in his sanctuary, the <br>
karanas. He did become the rainkeeper, if only for a short time. But <br>
that is another tale, told by Reclian Hopefinder, greatest <br>
storyteller among my ancestor, which brought you to this tale, and <br>
this tale's end. Farewell until next time!<br>
Phildefer of Qeynos,<br>
                    Hopefinder and lightbringer alike.<br>
Safe travels all, and may our paths cross once more, so i can share <br>
yet more tales with ye all! I shall dream of light and darkness, my <br>
power and my rest from it, my belief and my faith, for both be needed <br>
to a just heart. All be well, and all be with ye. I live yet for <br>
another adventure to draw me in! And its tale will please you, so his <br>
my hope, and that it tells of great a victory over darkness! To all <br>
that follow light, fare thee well. To others, may you live peaceful <br>
lives, and may you learn the truth of our world, that dawn is hope, <br>
and hope is what we must strive to keep alive, as goodness and all <br>
that is good spawn from it!<br>
