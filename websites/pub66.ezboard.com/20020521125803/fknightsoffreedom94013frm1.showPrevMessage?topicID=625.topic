I am curious as to your opinions on which I should go for.  The Steelsilk does have more pieces of armor, so I guess that would be a factor, but i'm trying to decide if i wish to seriously push the other sets or to stay with steelsilk.<br>

<br>
I believe you already have the Silksteel availible to you through Aleric. As for it's utility, it's a great level 30ish armour set, pass-able at the level 40th region.<br>
<br>
The next step up for you now would be Valorium. However since the guild is at the Thurgadin quest armour stage, you can completely by-pass the Plane of Fear step. As for which is better between Righteous and Rune Protector. Since they both have similar stats, that's moot. The factor you should look at then is accessibility. In all honesty, the chances of aquiring a Rune Protector set is better than your chances with Righteous.<br>
<br>
Here are the bottle-necks.<br>
<br>
Righteous.<br>
1. A Plane of Hate, 2nd floor drop off of Inny Knights.<br>
2. The Plane of Fear is a reserved zone. That leads to raiding with guilds that are 2nd floor able or willing. Being accepted on these raids. Competing against other paladins on the raid, and working with the guild's raiding rules.<br>
3. If your waiting to raid with the KoF in Hate, you'll be waiting for a while still before we will be holding 2nd floor-able raids in Hate.<br>
4. Righteous armour are rare drops.<br>
<br>
All that adds up, to an extremely long time frame in aquiring the armour set. In fact by the time you might aquire a full set, you will be at a level that Righteous armour will no longer be viable and you'll be trying to shed it as soon as possible. Plus four months down the road, the guild as a whole, may be ready to compete in higher end Luclin zones and/or the Halls of Testing in the Temple of Veeshan.<br>
<br>
Runed Protector<br>
1. Drops in only four Kael areas.<br>
2. Requires gems, once you get the main components.<br>
3. The frequence our raid leaders are willing to push raids in Kael, and how jaded our members become of Kael.<br>
4. Your current priority level in comparison to other KoF plate-user.<br>
<br>
On the good side, Plate is the most common drops from Kael, when you look at the rate Leather or Chain drops at. Also, I'm now totally out of the Thurgadin plate requirement list, Cib and Mort are getting there. Flaten is almost done as well, Loralis and Alegure do not really need much in terms of Armour from Kael. So all of the people above will be there in Kael to help the rest of the guild get their armour needs fullfilled. So in the end, your chances of getting an armour set are greatest here, push and attend as many raids in Kael as you can. <br>
<br>
To give you a standard, I finished my armour set in two months give or take; this is by factoring my priority in the guild, our Kael raid frequency and the time it took enact the Champion program. I also lost a lot of time fighting off Champion's critics initally and trying to regain guild spirit for our Kael raids; heck if we all were really dedicated, we could have one or two KoF plate users in full sets every two weeks, maybe more depending how the rate goes. That's why I've been always sounding like a broken record for Kael, if we all are willing to hold back our more material nature and focus on one area at a time, we can turn out full armour sets pretty quickly.<br>
<br>
Now you will also have an additional option as well concerning armour sets, and that's with Umbral armour pieces. As the guild average level are jumping leaps and bounds, Umbral armour farms are quickly becoming a reality. <p>Senaan Truesilver<br>Seneschal of the Knights<br>Loving husband of Joslin<br><a target=new href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=97689>Lowbie_Gear</a><br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=444444><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub66.ezboard.com/bknightsoffreedom94013.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=oenar>Oenar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Deepwater Knight<br>Squire Raid Officer</span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=#FFFCCC>(4/29/02 10:50:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fknightsoffreedom94013frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=629.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Descions on Armor Sets</span><hr size=1> Well, the differences between the armor sets is while The Planar types and Thurgadin Armor have only 8 Pieces, all of them visible items, Steelsilk possesses about 13 pieces, 5 of which are no look (mask, cloak, choker, etc)<br>

<br>
I suppose I can mix and match if you will and possess an even better set of armor.  (Yes i'm focused on fashion a little too, so I like to have a set of armor that looks the same =))<br>
<br>
Valorium is Fear though as I understand, i'd have as much of a chance getting the Righteous armor as Valorium? Or am I wrong?<br>

<br>
SilkSteel is considered a cultural armour, that class of armour fits between Old world quest armour and common Planar class. The best knight you can ask about Silksteel is Jurgen, though you'll have to do it in-game as he doesn't frequent the message board.<br>
<br>
Valorium drops off of fetid fiends. A monster found in large numbers in the Plane of Fear, I know as I've been MA on a recent Plane of Fear raid for a friend's guild. ( Not that I wanted to. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It just turned out that way, when the offical level 60 MA (Paladin) didn't show up and the SA (Shadow Knight) kept going LD and later didn't return. )<br>
<br>
Anyhow, ask Cibelle or Darcadez on what they thinks on Valorium, Cibelle has a good number of Valorium armour pieces and is now opting for Rune Protector. <p>Senaan Truesilver<br>Seneschal of the Knights<br>Loving husband of Joslin<br><a target=new href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=97689>Lowbie_Gear</a><br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=555555><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub66.ezboard.com/ullaurielfairblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llauriel Fairblade</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.koopa.org/eq/misc/dmicon_small.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Wrath of Tunare</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#FFFCCC>(4/29/02 11:22:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fknightsoffreedom94013frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=629.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.koopa.org/eq/mine/llaurielshead.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Descions on Armor Sets</span><hr size=1> I would always go for AC.  Ac Ac Ac.  It will be your best bet for now.  After ac focus on HPs.  Valorium is fairly easy to get and a few pieces of deepwater are fairly common.  DW arms, hands, helm and boots are fairly easy to get or buy and offer great AC.<br>
<br>
I would look at steelsilk to fill the non BIG 8 slots.  I think you would find better things to fill the big 8.<br>
<br>
As for the difference between Righteous and Runed Protector they are both a pain.  Righteous, if you win the roll, is basically free except for the time you put in on the raid.  It is fairly rare, though, but seems no rarer than Plate drops in Kael.  Runed protector is not bad, but you need faction and gems.  I had much better luck trying to get righteous than Runed protector.  However, if you can get in on the plate cylce in kael I heard quite a bit can drop.  Not sure how it works, but heard it is nice.<br>
<br>
My recomendation is to work on Kael and go to fear for valorium.  I also recomend going to Hate if for no other reason you might get a darkmetal holywater sprinkler (nice 1hb), and there is an epic BP you need from Hate if you ever want to do epic.  Both fairly common drops from first floor.  Also, should you happen to go to 2nd floor and should anything drop (armor or darkmetal falchion) you would probably have a pretty good chance on it as there are normally few paladins on hate raids.  You can just sign up for as many raids as you can (what I did at first and got burned out) or find a few guilds/friends that go often and try to sign up with them as much as you can.  Evoluxa hosts lotsa planar raids and they almost always spend at least some time on the second floor.  Whenever I go to Hate I try to spend as much time on second floor as I can.  I am sure Puma goes and tries to clear the second floor, though I never been on any of his raids.  Any rate.  Go visit the planes.  Have some fun.  Get lucky.<br>
<br>
Oh, and also think about spending time in ME and Umbral.  some nice drops around there including belts, masks, idols, medallions, etc along with all the moktor armor.<br>
<br>

As anyone of these classes you would most likely want to get your AC, HP, and STA as high as you can.  <br>
<br>
My suggestion from what you have listed above is to work on Thurg Quest armor mainly and use the Cultural armor to fill in the slots that Planer/Quest armor does not fill.  You may also want to look into other armor to fill the &quot;other&quot; slots.  <br>
<br>
I suggest Thurg Quest over Hate due to the fact that with how frequently our guild raids Kael it will be much easier to get Quest armor than Hate.  I say this because even though I have only been on 2 Hate raids from what I have read, 2nd floor Hate drops are VERY rare.  Drops in Kael will be much more frequent.  Another note is it seems that most people on the Hate raids are more interested in the 1st floor drops because that is where the &quot;origional&quot; Planer armor for many classes drops (ie Warrior, Cleric, and Casters).  Also the 2nd floor drops for Rangers, Druids, Paladins, and the likes are the class equivilant to the Plane of Growth armor of the other classes.  This is done due to the fact that if you kill in the PoG you will soon become KoS to the &quot;good&quot; elves.<br>
<br>
Just my 2cp, but I would strongly suggest you look at the profiles of Mort, Cib, and Ll's.  All 3 of which I know play the roll of MA from time to time.<br>
