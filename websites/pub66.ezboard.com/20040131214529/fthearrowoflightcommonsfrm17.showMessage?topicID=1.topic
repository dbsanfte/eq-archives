I was wondering if we could have an area where we can post questions about EQ. An area where we can draw upon each others expertise.  Many of us have knowledge about skills or abilities that we have learned and that knowledge might helpful to others.  Let me give an example of my two questions that I think others might have the answers to.<br>
1. I have failed to realize that ALL of my weapon skills should have been advanced while I was leveling.  Thinking that as a ranger I should only use 1H slashing skills, I failed to use my 2H skills.  Now I realize that 2H is important, it is taking me along time to advance it.  My question is ...It seems that the only time my 2H advances is when I use it against dark blue or higher mobs.  And that has cost me dearly in my selection of which MOB's to attack.  Is that true?  Can you only advance weapon skills against your lvl MOB or higher?<br>
2. I would like to know everyone's feelings about the AA points.  Some folks have told me to wait until lvl 60 before selecting a % for AA points. Other have told me to select anywhere from 10% to 90% as soon as you reach lvl 51.  I am really lost as to what is the best action for AA points.  I would like to hear what the &quot;Arrows&quot; think.<br>
<br>
These are just two questions I have.  Maybe others might have some also.<br>
<br>
Thanks for taking the time to respond. And Tymoria if I placed this request in the wrong spot.  Sorry.<br>
<br>
I have not learned how to make those cool signatures yet (maybe some step by step help for us old guys would helpful), so I have to sign off the old fashion way....heheh...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I don't know if this is in the right place either, but I'll take a crack at an answer to your questions... at least the second one cause I really don't know about the first. <br>
<br>
I, too, have gotten different advice from different people about the AA points.  Most people have always said don't bother with it till you're 60.  But that advice was also before PoP expansion.  Now there's a new level cap, new higher level AA options and the bar has been raised significantly (WAY over us!).  Because of that, there are certain AA skills I'd really like to have on my way to the big SIX-Oh.  Like run-speed 3.  Probably not a concern for you, but as Necro who must bum sows all his life or do an AC camp (a lifetime unto itself) Run3 is VERY important.  <br>
<br>
As a class who frequently solos, here is my personal regret.  For a couple months I did nothing but kill in Highkeep.  The experience was INSANE!  But finally, I leveled to 57 and the gravy train was over.  Looking back, I seriously wish I had had Luclin back at 55, cause I would have spent a couple extra weeks and soaked in at least 3 AA points.  I would have had 6 by now, and be working on those cool Class Specific powers.  <br>
<br>
So, I say if you find a place with incredible experience, milk it for some AA points.  When you get to your upper 50's you'll be that much ahead of the game.  Also, I've been moving the % of exp to AA up and down, depending on what I've wanted to accomplish.  I think I'll always have at least 10% going to AA tho.<br>

It is possible to advance your skills however against any mob that cons light Blue or higher, However when fighting a Mob that is light blu you have less of a chance at skilling up than fighting against a Mob that is Blue or Even con to you.<br>
<br>
Im not exactly sure if you have and even greater chance at skilling up while fighting a Yellow or Red con though.  <br>
<br>
The best way to go about getting low weapon skills up is to  use your Free Training points that you get every lvl (if you have been saving them).  This does start to get expensive however as the trainer charges you after skill lvl 15 on every Training point.  <br>
Or you could do what i do and wait until you get a Kick Arse group, where the mobs are going down so fast and furiously that i will not matter if you switch to the weapon that you need to skill up (in your case the 2hs).  Best to ask your group if this is OK with them first, but most people will not mind in the least.  This is exactly what Karpe and Jokey were doing last night while we were fighting Hill Giants.  Skilling up thier 2hb.<br>
<br>
I also know that their seems to be some skills (not weapon skills) that can be advanced against Green type Mobs Such as pickpocket for Rogues and i think Instill doubt for Monks?  Correct me if im wrong Karpe.  Not sure why this is but it happens.<br>
<br>
Hope that helps.<br>

It DOES appear that the skills only go up when the mobs are dark blue or higher, which limits when I can work on the skills.  The best time I have been able to do it has been on large raids, where there are 50 people fighting the mobs and my feeble efforts wont be really missed (or noticed!).<br>
<br>
I have also worked on them when I was hunting for xp with Sytox.  Granted, I asked him first if it was alright, and even then I found myself switching back to my main weapon when things got rough.  It is not something you can just focus on entirely in that situation.<br>
<br>
As far as AA, I pretty much have only started the AA thing now that most of my toons have hit 54 -- the leveling is really slow at this point and it is nice to at least see some progess.  With Aevetare I have gone 100% AA now that he is slightly into lvl 53 -- only so that I can die and get back to lvl 52 so I can go on Vox raids to try to get that last book I need.  Otherwise, I would've been 54 with Aev a long time ago too.  I think the AA points are a personal choice --  I would expect that some people won't mess with them until they are lvl 60, but others will see more benefit out of them earlier.<br>

They were very helpful. As to the first question it seems that you all were correct.  I have been trying to raise my 2hs soloing, because I thought it would not be very helpful to a group using a weaker skill.  But right after I posted I went into Echo Caverns and joined a group. I asked if they would mind if I worked on my 2hs.  Well, it was a &quot;killer group&quot;, I raised my skill from 61 to 118 in just three hours.  So you are correct &quot;work with a group, ask permission, and go for it&quot;.<br>
As for the question about AA %. I am one of those adventure's who does not have a lot of time to play.  So I do not get to level very quickly.  But that is ok.  More time to enjoy the adventure.  So putting a higher % into AA might pay off for me.  Would it build more AA points for me each level?  Not sure how many AA points you can get each level.<br>
I want to thank all of you for helping. See you in the game.<br>
