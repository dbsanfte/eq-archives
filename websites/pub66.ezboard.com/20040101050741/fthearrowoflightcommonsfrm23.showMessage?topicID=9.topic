Read &quot;The Road to Highpass&quot; before continuing.)<br>
<br>
<br>
OUR VERY FIRST GUILD MEETING<br>
<br>
Merani, Montag and I continued our journey to Highpass where our first guild meeting was to be held.  That trip is definitely one of my greatest memories.  With Froon and Choon now miles behind us, we at last reached Highpass, and retreated to the back room of a local bar.  <br>
<br>
From the window, we overlooked a clear natural spring.  The bar was isolated, with just the bartender and a couple Highpass Citizens.  One by one, we met those who were meant to be our guild brothers and sisters.  [At least one pic of this event still exists on the old message board.]<br>
<br>
In addition to Montag, Merani and myself, Aydrian was of course in attendance.  Then there was Wychlea, a red-bearded wizard who was clearly close friends with Merani as well.  Also standing out from the crowd was Jaron (Arslan, Razau) a Druid who, to me, appeared to have incredible power.  <br>
<br>
In attendance was another of their friends named Grigriman.  And another named Bripok.  I don’t recall Aevetare being present – or perhaps he was there briefly but had to leave.   I should add that after this night, I never saw Bripok or Grigriman again, and they never became members of the Arrow of Light.<br>
<br>
Merani and Aydrian called the meeting to order, standing on tables so they could be seen clearly.  <br>
<br>
Merani:  I call to order the first meeting of our guild!<br>
HP Citizen:  A guild in Highpass?  Oh, I'm afraid the city Fathers would never allow it.<br>
<br>
Heheh...<br>
<br>
One of the topics was, naturally, who would be Guild Leader.  To me, it seemed obvious.  I mean, come on, who was running the meeting?!  <br>
<br>
Merani seemed to defer the title to Aydrian.  To me, it seemed that Aydrian nodded politely, knowing full well (as I sure did) that it was Merani whom we all had in common and Merani was the obvious choice.  But she wanted Ayd to be in charge.  And Ayd wanted Merani to be in charge.  It was all quite endearing to see the two of them so humble.  Not for one second did anyone think this ambivalence was a problem.  <br>
<br>
It was, in fact, a problem that would hang over the Arrows for some time to come.  <br>
<br>
Next, it was time to find a name for our guild.  And we were NOT short on choices!  Some of the ideas were ordinary…”North Star.”  Others were over the top… “Dragon Brigade.” Always looking for a laugh, I pitched “The Order of Order”, “Order of Chaos” (sorta like jumbo/shrimp), ”Cult of Personality” and “Circle Gets the Square.”  <br>
<br>
Another name I had on my list was the “Unbroken Circle.”  This was a name that everyone immediately liked and it went high on the list of choices.  But there was another name that was said by either Ayd or Merani...<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Arrow of Light.<br>
<br>
Wow!  It was neither ho-hum nor obnoxious.  In fact, the beauty of the name was in its creative simplicity.  Being a Ranger, maybe I was partial to it, but I loved the image of a single arrow, made of a brilliant white light, piercing the darkness.  And we, as a guild, would do the same.  I LOVED it!!<br>
<br>
I believe it was Jaron, who had the forethought in this moment.  “What if someone in our guild doesn’t follow the light?”  He was right of course, but most of us liked it just the same.  Me?  I didn’t care about some Necro who might some day be in our ranks, I was a Tunare-loving Ranger!  We could not settle the name issue in our first meeting and our meeting was adjourned… <br>
<br>
But it wasn’t time to go yet.  Don’t know who started it, but someone suggested a chugging contest.  Before I knew it, Aydrian, Merani and others were consuming 20 beers with Montag acting as official timer.  Brew was flowing like you wouldn’t believe, and for the first time ever, yours truly got totally BLITZED!<br>
<br>
To add to the fun, someone cast Levitate on us all.  FLOATING!  And DRUNK!  For everyone else perhaps, this was a typical Saturday night, but for Montag and me, this was an unbelievable adventure!  We were kids… brought into a private club with the powerful adults.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’ve never had so much fun!” Montag whispered to me.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Me either!”  I said.  “When you got up this morning did you think for a second that we’d be in a bar in Highpass, drunk and floating?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Not a clue!” said Montag.<br>
<br>
It was definitely a night to remember -- my best buddy Montag and me, at our first guild meeting.  Little did either of us know… that first meeting was going to be Montag’s last... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E6E8fA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub66.ezboard.com/bthearrowoflightcommons.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aevetare>Aevetare</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Raid Officer</span><br>  Posts: 248<br> <font color=#000080>(1/24/03 3:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Arrow of Light: Our Very First Guild Meeting (Pt. 6)</span><hr size=1> Minor note: Guild was not formed in Highpass, it was formed in Lesser Faydark.  I think this meeting was either a pre-guild forming meeting to decide who was to be the guildleader and what the guildname was to be, or occured shortly after the forming.<br>
<br>
And no, Aevetare wasn't there, nor was I or Phaith.  Aev was a member of Stormcloud Legion until Arrows was formed, and I and Phaith were both part of Infinity Watch... until a band of 10 good friends went to Lfay with Oscarin the GM (I think it was Oscarin...)<br>
<br>
And you are right, some people who were good friends never became part of the guild, like Grigiman, and they have long since faded into history.<br>
<br>
Mugo<br>
(wonders if he still has the pics from the guild formation...) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A0B0E0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub66.ezboard.com/bthearrowoflightcommons.showUserPublicProfile?gid=garomtel>Garomtel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Da Puppy</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#000080>(1/24/03 4:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Arrow of Light: Our Very First Guild Meeting (Pt. 6)</span><hr size=1> Yes yes you are right.  Perhaps I should edit it to make it clear that the Arrows were not formed in this meeting, but instead it was an organizational gathering where details of what would be were discussed.  <br>
<br>
By the time we got to Lesser Fay, the landscape and Founders had changed quite a bit.  <br>
<br>
But that's Part 8!<br>
