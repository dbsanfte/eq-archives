Guild votes should be taken within 3 days of any vacancy, and should last between 1 and 3 days.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Master of the Guild (Guild Leader). One player may hold this, they may not hold any other position. <br>
<br>
Responsibilties: Responsible for helping with over-all decisions of the guild, and molding the direction of the guild. He may veto any of the officer's calls, EXCEPT the Inner Circle's final decisions. He is charged with the appointment of officers to the appointed positions. The Master of the Guild may change the /guildmotd, take official polls, make guild expulsions, and make recruiting exceptions. The Master of the Guild can make alliances, designate guild enemies, and discipline (within reason) any guild member. The guild leader can strip any officer of rank, EXCEPT members of the elite council. The guild leader has access to any section of the message board.<br>
<br>
Placement: If the Master of the Guild ever steps down (voluntarily or involuntarily), a vote is called by the Seneschal for the general membership to elect a new guild leader. A guild leader can be asked to step down or stripped of his position by the unanimous consent of the Inner Circle.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The Inner Circle (a.k.a. Elite Council): One player can only hold one position in the Inner Circle. A member of the Inner Circle may not hold any other guild officer position.<br>
<br>
There are three positions in the Inner Circle.<br>
<br>
1. Seneschal, keeper of the manor, the right hand of the guild leader and overseer of the officers.<br>
<br>
Responsibilities: The Seneschal is to set deadlines for the officers when certain task must be done. If the Guild Leader requires a proposal created, information provided, or a recommendation made, the Seneschal sees to the details and ensures that the right people are recruited for the task. Only the Seneschal, besides the Guild Leader can conduct official polls, and change the /guildmotd. The Seneschal can and should make recommendations to the Guild Leader on officer and team positions. The Seneschal along with the Sergeant at Arms is responsible for liaison work with official guild allies.<br>
<br>
Placement: The Seneschal is appointed by the Guild Leader.<br>
<br>
2. The Knights' Counselor, the healing hand of guild's emotions.<br>
<br>
Responsibilites: She is the cheerleader of the guild, she is responsible for the guild's morale. If needed she can press the the Sergeant of the Sword for something fun if she feels the guild is becoming boring. She is the person any guild member can contact when they need a listening ear or some advice.<br>
<br>
Placement: The Knights' Counselor is appointed by the guild leader.<br>
<br>
3. The Knights' Marshal of the March, the strategic war leader of the guild.<br>
<br>
Responsibilities: She is the war general of the Knights. She determines where we should focus our attention with time, money and power when it comes to guild needs for raids and equipment. The Marshal does not determine what speicific zones we raid, she only determines our strengths and weaknesses and works out what needs improvement. For example, if our melees lack armor, then she and the Sergeant of the Shield can together designate that we will raid Kael Drakkel more, or if we need a cleric with her epic then the Sergeant of the Shield will work on raids to get a rez stick for one of our clerics. The Marshal's forte is STRATEGIC thinking, not tactical planning.<br>
<br>
Placement: The Marshal of the March is voted in by the membership of the guild.<br>
<br>
The Inner Circle's general responsibilites: The Inner Circle is responsible for approving and applying new guild policies as proposed by any member of the guild. Together with the Guild Leader, they determine how guild members will be disciplined for policy violations. An Inner Circle member can be stripped of their position only by the consent of the other two Inner Circle members plus the Guild Leader, or by voluntarily stepping down.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The Sergeants at Arms. (Raid Leaders)<br>
There are three officers, the Sergeant of the Sword, the Sergeant of the Shield, and the Junior Raid Sergeant. Only one player may hold any of these positions at a time.<br>
<br>

She can with the Marshal of the March commit guild resources to helping allied guilds on their raids. With the Knights' Counselor, this Sergeant can determine zones in which events will be held. With the Seneschal, responsible for relations with the guild's official allies.<br>
<br>
Sergeant of the Shield. Responsible for working out the details of raids designed to acquire gear improvements for the Knight Champions, Pull Team, or general membership. Following the Marshal's guidelines, this Sergeant can determine which specific zones we will raid.<br>
<br>
Junior Raid Sergeant. Responsible for scheduling raids and events for Knights and Junior Knights (those lower than level 45).<br>
<br>
General responsiblities of all Sergeants: These include calling for outside assistance if needed, the planning and conduct of offical guild raids, handling details like corpse recoveries during wipeouts, handing out and ensuring a guild stock of raid spell components, and developing participation lists for review by the Council of Merit and officership. They are responsible for keeping the the guild active and moving in the direction the Guild Leader wishes. They do not have the power to distribute loot obtained by guild efforts as they wish, that is the job of the Council of Merit. These three officers should remember that they are servants of the guild, and not its masters.<br>
<br>

The Warden as part of the Council of Merit determines awards to members for upholding the Knights' Principles and for specific acheivements. The Warden is also responsible for the efficiency of loans made to members. The Warden is the guild's accountant and resident quartermaster.

<br>
Placement: Appointed by the guild leader.<br>
<br>
