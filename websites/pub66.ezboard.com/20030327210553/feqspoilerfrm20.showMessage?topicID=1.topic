------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 <br>
Well folks, it seems they finally fixed the quest. You can now gain entry to Halls of Honor without needing to kill Aerin`Dar.<br>
The quest is quite involved and requires some difficult to obtain rare drops off rare spawns in tricky places.<br>
<br>
The quest starts off by talking to Grenic Drere in Plane of Valor. He can be found along the wall left of the zone in, just before the river and the cave entrance with Razorfiends.<br>
<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Grenic Drere'<br>
Grenic Drere says 'Mortals, this far into the planes? Something that I never thought that I would see. Regardless that does not help my situation any does it?'<br>
<br>
You say, 'what situation?'<br>
<br>
Grenic Drere says 'Not that it is your business, but this is where I call home. I have lost track of the years that I have spent here. This valley is my home, for I was exiled from [Mithaniel's Temple]. It is not a story that I am proud of and do not wish to share with you. So be one with you.'<br>
<br>
You say, 'where is Mithaniel's Temple?'<br>
<br>
Grenic Drere says 'Only a mortal would be as thick headed to know not when to take their leave. He and his legions call his temple The Halls of Honor. Paladins that have served him well on Norrath have the opportunity to ascend into his ranks. They are in training to make sure that they are always prepared to defend what they believe is the right and honorable thing to do. Mithaniel is an extremely proud being, and will accept any challenge that you may have to offer him. If you are willing to challenge him, I may have some [information] you will find useful.'<br>
'<br>
You say, 'what information?'<br>
<br>
Grenic Drere says 'There are other methods to enter the Halls of Honor than those that are readily apparent, and as a former soldier of Marr I can offer you access into the Halls; however as with all such arrangements there must be something [paid] for something earned.'<br>
<br>
You say, 'paid?'<br>
<br>
Grenic Drere says 'I was not the only member of my squad that was sent into exile, my brothers in arms, were the impetus for our exile. I was but a mere pawn. They now reside in the Plane of Justice as bodiless shades. Their punishment was too lax for their actions; I want their eternal souls to be mine. Find a smith who will teach you to create a box of souls, weaken the shades, then capture their souls and return all three to me.'<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
He tells you to seek a powerful enough smith who can craft the box of souls. This smith is called Bork Darkanvil and he can be found in one of the houses in Plane of Knowledge at the loc -388, 493.<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Borik Darkanvil'<br>
<br>
Borik Darkanvil says 'Greetings, Borik Darkanvil, at your service. I was once a planar traveler like you. Those days are behind me, now I am content to earn my keep as a blacksmith, and to experiment with some of the [special recipes] that I have picked up in these outer planes.'<br>
<br>
You say, 'do you know of the box of souls?'<br>
<br>
Borik Darkanvil says 'Borik Darkanvil's eyes grow narrow. 'So looking to capture some souls are you? It's none of my business I suppose so don't answer. I'm pretty sure that I don't want to know. I paid heavily for the formula for the Box of Souls, but its not a price I would pass on to anyone else. There isn't much to it, but it does take the hands of a skilled smith and the magic of Tanaan's forges to event attempt it. First you will need a block of [Perilium].'<br>
<br>
You say, 'what is a block of Perilium?'<br>
<br>
Borik Darkanvil says 'Perilium was once used to make clockwork machines, there are now stronger metals so it has become harder and harder to find Perilium, much less a block that is large enough to be of any use. Then you will need to find the brain of a crystal spider, this is where the actual soul will be held. Of course the box will need a supernatural power source, the souls are held into place by the horror of their own dreams, the heart of an agony mephit will give the device that power. Forge these with a smithing hammer and a vial of sacred water and you will have your box. Of course if you have not the skill, I can [forge them for you].'<br>
<br>
You say, 'forge them for me?'<br>
<br>
Borik Darkanvil says 'If you return all three items to me I will do the work for you for, a mere three thousand platinum, don't worry about the hammer, and some water that should work well. I will not guarantee my success, but I can guarantee if you do not have the skill, you will fail'.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
He asks for four things:<br>
<br>
Agony Mephit Heart -- This item can be found off &quot;An Agony Mephit&quot;. Agony Mephit is an uncommon spawn that spawns in the underwater caves in Plane of Nightmare. It can spawn in any place where a regular mephit spawns. To get to the underwater tunnels in Plane of Nightmare, upon zoning in head towards the hobgoblins. Drop down by the shore line, underneath the water you will find a tunnel. Follow the tunnel for a few metres and you will surface in a cave. At first it is filled with all kinds of Hobgoblins. You will need to follow the cave until the intresection where you will turn right and you will see mephits. Set up camp wherever you like and good luck. The heart does not drop every time, however you can find Ethernal and Spectral Parchments, as well as an nice int caster earring that drops every time.<br>
<br>
Crystalline Spider Brain -- This drops off a named spider in Plane of Valor called &quot;a Lucid Archanee&quot;. He always spawns in the same place in the desert. If you follow the left wall when you exit the castle upon entering the desert and go all the way to the wall before Aerin`Dar. Before coming to the wall on your right you should see a glass lake and sort of a little alcove with a single static spider. In the area there is another static spider and a roamer spider. His PH is a regular respawn time and he only spawns in that spot. The brain does not drop every time, however the named spider has a higher chance of dropping Ethernal Parchments than non-named mobs.<br>
The brain can also be found on a named crawler called &quot;a Luminii Crawler&quot;. The crawler can spawn in several places in the desert and a regular &quot;a Crystalline Crawler&quot; is the placeholder. He is fairly common but drops the brain rarely.<br>
<br>
Solid Block of Perilium -- This item drops very very rarely off any mob in Plane of Innovation. Little is known about this drop except that it is very very rare. It has been reported dropping off zone in mobs, and off Xenamech and some tougher mobs deeper in the zone. I have not heard reports of it dropping in the Factory, but it may as well drop there just very rarely. Good luck with this item.<br>
<br>
Also collect 3000 platinum pieces from your bank.<br>
<br>
Return these 3 items to Borik Darkanvil along with 3000 platinum and he will create a Box of Souls for you. THERE IS A CHANCE HE MAY FAIL WHEN COMBINING. If he is successful you now have &quot;Box of Souls&quot; a tiny sized item with 10 weight. THIS IS NOT A CONTAINER.<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
 Borik Darkanvil deftly pulls out his smithing hammer and bangs away at the Perilium, making a solid casing. His hands move quickly as he produces the ingredients into a sinister looking box. 'Here you go, I don't know what you are going to do with this and I don't care, just be careful.'<br>
You gain party experience!! <br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
If you have a very high smithing skill, you may also attempt smithing this item yourself. Additional components that you require along with the items listed above is a smithing hammer and a vial of Sacred Water.<br>
Sacred Water can be found off Valorian Guards in Plane of Valor. The 2 guards in the building to the left of the zone in have dropped &quot;Sacred Water&quot;, uncommonly. They are rather difficult to kill and you may need a FD puller or an enchanter to split them.<br>
Combine the 5 items in the forge and it will create a Box of Souls. Nobody has reported attempting to smith this item themselves, so I have no information on the trivial level, but according to Borik, it is a very difficult item to smith.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now that you have Box of Souls it is time to capture the souls.<br>
<br>
Head to Plane of Justice. You need to kill &quot;tormented wraith&quot; to spawn exiled soldiers of Marr. Tormented wraiths can be found near the blue portal room that takes you to the trials. From the trial portal room if you head out and go up the stairs, through the door and exit through the right door, turn right again. Tormented wraiths can be found in the first room to the right. There is 3 of them to the right and 2 gnomes to the left. Fighting the wraiths will not agro any other mob nearby.<br>
When you kill a wraith, there is a small chance it will trigger an exiled soldier of Marr to spawn. Each of the 3 wraiths triggers a different &quot;an exiled [prefix] of Marr&quot; mob to spawn. If one of these exiled Marr soldiers spawns, you hand in your box and get back a &quot;Soul Sphere&quot;. It is magic, lore, no drop. You also get your Box of Souls back. If you already have the Soul Sphere from that particular soldier, you will only recieve your box back. The soldiers spawn as an unattackable mob on the ground and despawn in roughly 3 minutes. <br>
<br>
The 3 different Soul Spheres ID as:<br>
<br>
Item Lore: You sense the soul resisting.<br>
Item Lore: You sense an angry presence.<br>
Item Lore: The soul seems calm within.<br>
<br>
When you have collected all 3 Soul Spheres, go seek Grenic Drere in Plane of Valor once again.<br>
When you turn in all 3 Soul Spheres to Grenic, he says this.<br>
<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Grenic Drere says 'Hmm, this is minor vindication, but vindication nonetheless. I will never again fight with my old compatriots, but now I know the punishment of those responsible for my exile is fitting for their crime. We did have an agreement, and while stripped of my rank I still have my honor. This ring is what all Soldiers of Marr wear to enter the Halls of Honor, it serves no use for me any longer, it is yours now.'<br>
You gain experience!! <br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
You will recieve &quot;Ring of Marr&quot;.<br>
<br>
Congratulations, you may now zone into Halls of Honor by clicking on a stone in Plane of Tranquility. The stone is to the right of Plane of Valor one.<br>
Upon zoning in for the first time, the key will be added to your keyring which you can check with the /key command.<br>
The phrase will say:<br>
&quot;With Marr's Symbol you may enter the Halls of Honor.&quot;<br>
<br>
I would like to thank everyone who has worked hard on figuring out this quest. Unfortunate it was not complete and working until recently, and special thanks to those people who have lost their Box of Souls from trying things for the sake of progress.<br>
<br>
Also thanks to Arghificious for being the first to figure out the soul part of the quest and helping me out. <br>
