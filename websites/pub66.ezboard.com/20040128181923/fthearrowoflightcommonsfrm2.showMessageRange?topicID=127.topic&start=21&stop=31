It was a superb raid and an incredible experience!  I thank you all for letting me see that far into, what was for me, a mystery zone.  <br>
<br>
That grand finale battle... WOW... twas the stuff EQ is made of.  I was jumping from feeding mana to the oom, mezzing adds that wouldn't let Mugo cast, then medding at the foot of eight mobs to gather just a LITTLE more mana.  This was what impressed me most about the battle, that everyone (and I do mean EVERYONE) was on their toes filling their roles perfectly.  I will not soon forget that image of us juggling 4 mobs, only to see another NINE pour out of that building.<br>
<br>
I can't tell you how proud I am to see us and our friends battling in a place like the Hole.  It ain't Tower of Veeshan, but it's always been one of those semi-uber zones that one group of just us Arrows would have difficulty diving into.  <br>

I was so tweaked about it happening right in the middle of our raid!<br>
<br>
  And one final comment about that final battle -- we ROCK!   I have to admit, I cursed under my breath when after the second wave had come out (I think Coddington was already dead by this time) and another wave came rolling out when I was down to 30% mana.  I did an aoe mez and to my horror watched as my entire text box filled up with &quot;&lt;insert mob name here&gt; has been fascinated.&quot;  Not just two or three lines of text -- the WHOLE box filled up.  I gasped, cursed, and swore.  I moved up a little closer and to my astonishment saw the actual nunmber of mobs and just started going through them one at a time to lock on a longer-lasting mez on each one, knowing full well that I woulnd't be able to finish re-mezzing them all before they would start waking up (there had to be at least 9 mobs there).  When I walked closer I could see them stacked one on top of the others, and I was thinking to myself 'oh you are gonna die soon, this is really bad.'<br>
  I honestly thought that.  It was the fight that Asyth went down in; valiantly trying to get those mobs slowed for our 3 -- count them 3! (Xeno, Montag and Tjohn -- Shindara had already left by this battle) tanks to deal with.  And lets not forget the pets -- they really helped.<br>
<br>
  But there were a couple caster mobs there for me to tap mana from.  There was Sytox and Farrienka who could do screaming terror.  A glimmer of hope remianed.  I don't know how the healers -- Asyth, Crelen, Morromind, and Aladarra managed it.  It was truly amazing, we really are an impressive bunch.  Big kudo's to everyone for pulling in together, keeping your heads and wits about you even as the odds looked grim.<br>
<br>
  We came though in fine form, be very proud of what we accomplished!<br>

At least i have never seen or heard of it happening.  I think what caused the massive amounts of MoBs that we had to fight were Wanderers and nasty pathing.  there are about 5-8 wandering mobs in that church that constantly run in patterns that are not set.  Tzitzi the Crazed is one of them.  I think what happened is a feew of them just happened to wander too close to our fight and then pathed his way to pick up friends.  <br>

I can't remember ever having more fun playing: everyone did a great job, especially the crowd control crew and our healers, keeping things under control while our limited tankage methodically plowed through the mobs (and no, I'm not forgetting our nukers--somehow the second half of a mob's health always seemed to go by MUCH easier than the first half, wonder why that was? =) ).<br>
<br>
I'm not sure exactly what happened to get so many mobs that last fight--I agree with what people have said so far.  I think the ultimate cause of the problem was that those dang golems just did not want to leave the chapel.  I was trying to pull them by running in and smacking them, which could have led to any number of problems:  (a) I had to get close to the paths of the wanderers, which might have caused them to aggro me, whereas they wouldn't have aggro'd if I'd been able to pull by casting from a distance, (b) I'm not sure if those golems just waited in there before coming out--there may have been a pathing issue where they ran around picking up friends to join us, and (c) I'm pretty sure I called assist on at least a couple golems who were still in the chapel, and that may have led to the pets getting drawn in there, which may have caused more adds and I think probably was why Codder ended up getting summoned in there (sorry Codd).<br>
<br>
Just a few thoughts--I think to really understand the issue, we'll have to head back there and test them out again.  =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A0B0E0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub66.ezboard.com/bthearrowoflightcommons.showUserPublicProfile?gid=asyth>Asyth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guild Gopher Goddess</span><br>  Posts: 356<br> <font color=#000080>(3/5/03 8:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=127.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Post Raid Wrapup</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:comic sans ms;font-size:x-small;">Hmmmm Okay heres what I recall from last battle.<br>
<br>
Tuff time getting mobs to leaves their home.<br>
<br>
Wee they come out about 3 or 4 at once.<br>
<br>
2nd wave --- adds. . mobs were inside or just outside the mouth to the catherdral.<br>
<br>
3rd wave --- no more waves after this one as the mobs were all closer to the walls.<br>
<br>
What I think happened to cause 2nd and 3rd wave was us fighting near the mouth to the cathedral.  Now as it was tuff to pull them out of cathedral I wonder once they were out with dmg on them was it still tuff to get them to move where we wanted them?  If not I'd say from now on we get them to the  back wall area  than call assist. ( So as to avoid unruly pets who won't backoff ) See if that fixes it.  The wanderers I saw weren't as many as the adds coming from inside the Cathedral. Hmmm I know the named was a wanderer saw him wander over and maybe two golems and/or a hervester.<br>
