Poster's note: This was originally posted by a member of Sojourners who had known/met Mr. Rogers IRL and had the greatest respect for him. I felt it was worthy of a post here, as it really is extremely funny. Please take this post in the spirit it was intended, to elicit some smiles over a very sad event, and good feelings. I'm sure Mr. Rogers would not mind and actively encourage something that would cause people to laugh one last time....<br>
<br>
However, if you are easily offended, please do not read further.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fred Rogers, Presbyterian minister and creator/host of the popular children's show &quot;Mister Rogers' Neighborhood&quot; died yesterday. <br>
<br>
He was defeated by Sojourners in a difficult raid that lasted some nine hours. <br>
<br>
After several months of gathering key pieces to enter the Neighborhood zone, including many long camps of the Cookie Monster and Bob the Builder (BtB) shards, Sojo gathered its forces and launched a mighty assault upon Fred Rogers and his minions. <br>
<br>
Xurts had been building up his MRN faction for some time by helping Mr. McFeely with the &quot;Speedy Delivery Messenger Service&quot; quest over and over again, so he was sent in to set up CoH for the rest of the raid force. He found the house seemingly empty and set up inside the closet full of sweaters and sneakers. This is considered a safe spot as long as Fred Rogers does not spawn and then roam too close. <br>
<br>
Once we had about 70% of the raid CoH-ed and in position, we heard the faint strains of &quot;Won't You Be My Neighbor?&quot; followed by an unmistakable sound of a door opening and closing. We realized we only had seconds before Fred Rogers would be in aggro range. <br>
<br>
The raid had been buffed before starting CoH, so we decided to rush Fred Rogers even before he got the closet door open, while Xurts continued to bring in the rest of the raiders. Daemonwynd, our MT quickly fell upon his target, as Fred Rogers' voice filled the zone with &quot;Why hello, neighbor. It's a beautiful day to be torn asunder and left as rotting carrion. Can you say that? Carrion? Sure. I knew you could.&quot; <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, Daemonwynd went down very quickly, as Fred Rogers is nearly magic immune and it took a long time to get a Slow to land on him. Of course, even with a Slow we would probably have lost Daemonwynd quickly. He's an excellent warrior, but I've seen him get killed by the spiked gates in Thurgadin. He's the Kenny of Sojourners. <br>
<br>
While Daemonwynd was getting his Frequent Rezzing card punched, Baywolf was sent in to tank until the call of &quot;Melees IN!&quot; was given. By this time nearly all of the raiders had arrived, and the sword-slingers descended upon their foe with ferocity. <br>
<br>
During this epic battle we had to rez raiders on the fly, as the fight was dragging on and on. For a man of 74, Fred Rogers has a frightening number of hit points. He also has a devasting AoE proc called &quot;Aura of Contentment&quot;, which is a combination HP/Mana drain, stun, and feeblemind effect. This proc was nearly the end of us, as it caused several of the casters and healers to wander to the kitchen area to watch Picture Picture show a film about how crayons are made. <br>
<br>
We tried to push our target into a corner, but the raid suffered a setback when Fred Rogers had been fought down to 15% and began to flee. Though a call was made to &quot;nuke hard&quot;, he was able to reach the Magic Trolley and flee into a subzone--Neighborhood of Make Believe. We hadn't counted on this. <br>
<br>
The tanks were all quickly rezzed (Daemonwynd for the eighth time) and what buffs that could be quickly cast were dispensed. With only sketchy information about the subzone, we entered NoMB. <br>
<br>
Almost immediately we were forced to fight high-level bodyguards outside a castle. These &quot;royals&quot; included Queen Sara Saturday (quickly burned down by the wizzies) and Prince Tuesday (successfully CC-ed until the tanks could dispatch him). As the second royal fell, it spawned King Friday XIII, who immediately aggroed with a booming, &quot;I must admit that you have some sort of digestive system, and I shall shortly be adorning the walls of my castle with it. Yes.&quot; <br>
<br>
This was a long fight, made more frustrating by the fact that Fred Rogers had already moved farther into the zone, as well as the add of a MOB called Henrietta Pussycat (&quot;Meow meow ruined meow own lands meow...&quot;). Thanks to a very tight cycle of healing from the clerics, the raid avoided what could have been a very ugly wipeout and CR. <br>
<br>
As quickly as we could we pursued Fred Rogers, who had by now regenerated quite a lot of his health, and cornered him by a clock tower. We made short work of an owl with a powerful fire-based DD, as well as Daniel Striped Tiger (Beastlord class?). Having stripped him of his protectors, we turned once more on our primary target. <br>
<br>
We went all out on the wounded Fred Rogers, bearing down hard with melee discs, critical blasts from the wizzies, and endless debuffing and DoTs. After much blood, sweat and tears...he finally fell. <br>
<br>
Loot included: <br>
MYSTIC VIBRANIUM SWEATER OF INVULNERABILITY (grats, Brann) <br>
GAUNTLETS OF THE PAINTED FINGERS (grats, Awenu) <br>
SPIKED BELT OF CORRECTION (grats, Elme) <br>
BOXERS OF THE SHRUNKEN MEMBER (eeeww, Caandy) <br>
<br>
Fred Rogers is a seven day spawn and considered, at this time, to be FCFS. <br>
<br>
This marks a very important moment in Sojourners history, as we are the first guild to enter the MRN and NoMB zones, as well as the first guild to take down the big man himself. Well done, Sojo! <br>
