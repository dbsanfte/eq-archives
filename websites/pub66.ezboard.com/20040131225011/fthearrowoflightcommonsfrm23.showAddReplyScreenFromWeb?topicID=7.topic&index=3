So you want to know who Tymoria is hmmm?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>This story is about <br>
Tymoria's first great deed.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> </div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
<br>
One Day, after having been away from Qeynos for far more time than she wished to contemplate; Tymoria decided it was finally time to visit home again. She caught a teleport from a kind wizard to North Karana and ran the rest of the way to the Qeynos Hills. <br>
<br>
Upon reaching the hills, she spied Tovax Vmar and his skeletal pet walking by, evils surrounding them like a shroud. Vmar had cost her much in her younger years, and continued to do the same to other fledgling rangers after she left. Tymoria decided he had had enough fun at others expense. She easily dispatched him and his pet, no epic battle to go into here for certain! She felt greatly satisfied to have given him back some of his own, but with honest bladework. <br>
<br>
She then walked to Surefall Glade to visit with Hager Sureshot, her Guildmaster and former mentor. He was, as he always seemed to be, at the archery range practicing. While relaxing in the glade, she came upon a friend she had met in her earliest years! After much back slapping and exchanging of news, Tymoria sat down to fletch up some arrows for her supplies while he began to practice his spell casting. <br>
<br>
Tymoria saw the spell he cast and was unfamiliar with it. Eventually, curiosity got the better of her and she inquired which spell it was he was casting. He replied that it was the spell Dance of the Fireflies of course! She was surprised he wasted such time on such a disadvantageous spell. It was far more mana efficient and practical to simply carry a Greater Lightstone was it not? Surprise written plainly on his face, he informed her that he was not casting it for use of the fireflies, but to practice his conjuration skills. He being of thirty seasons, he now had a useful conjuration spell and had no actual skill in conjuration. Far easier, he said to practice with the lesser spell than the greater. Tymoria blushed in embarrassment for not thinking of something like that. She had never even purchased the spell due to its uselessness! Imbued with an urgency to raise her conjuration skills before she became thirty, she rushed to purchase Dance of the Fireflies and headed for Qeynos to take care of some banking. <br>
<br>
Some time later, Tymoria stood in a shadowed niche to the side of the Qeynos gates and practiced her spell as quietly as possible. Lately, as her gear had improved, young adventurers had taken to begging from her, she had little enough money for herself, and did not want to have to tell the poor dears no so often. During her practice she noticed a strange man was shouting something she could not quite hear, except that he desired aid in righting a great wrong, but would go to fix it himself if none from Qeynos would help him. Her curiosity and home city pride pricked, she emerged from her niche to find him and see what was happening. A man in a full suit of sparkling, silver plate armor stood at the gates. He implored people there to come and help him in his quest. Tymoria approached the man and asked him who he was and what help he required. He replied that his name was Vegalys Keldrane and he had been put in charge of investigating the plague of the Karanas. He said he had been informed of a farmer there by the name of Jansen who mysteriously had flourishing crops amid the foul mist and diseased lands. Vegalys was going to find out how this was possible and wished aide in the journey in case of trouble. Tymoria told him that certainly she would help! She was a worshiper of Karana and would see the plains cleansed, if this man had a cure they needed to find out what it was! <br>
<br>
Finally Vegalys could wait no longer and took Tymoria and two others with him through the Karanas to the farmer they sought, the journey was fraught with rabid animals of all shapes and sizes. Several times along the way it was needful to mercifully end an animal?s life out of pure pity for the addled creatures. With the aid of Tymoria's tracking abilities and Vegalys' knowledge of the Karanas they finally found farmer Jansen and his property. As reported, his crops flourished! They had passed countless other fields that had rotted and died, yet this one crop stood firm against the plague! Vegalys began questioning farmer Jansen with the three volunteers' aid and it was slowly becoming apparent that something was up. Vegalys left to search the property for anything suspicious while leaving the three to continue the questioning. <br>
<br>
During his absence the farmer became more and more nervous, stammering and evading questions, looking around nervously. Vegalys returned with nothing unusual to report. . .yet. . .there was something odd about this farmer. . . . The four questioners bombarded the man with questions and consulted one another until it was decided that of all things. . it was his hat that was the most unusual. He was asked to remove it, and when he did not, Vegalys made him take it off. All four questioners stepped back, uttering exclamations of shock! The farmer had the brand of the Bloodsabres on his forehead! <br>
<br>
Now clearly marked as a collaborator he began to crumble and tell them all he knew. The bloodsabres had promised him that if he buried their artifact in his soil his crops would flourish if he but aided them in their evil doings. Finding the offer too tempting to resist, he agreed, but later became nervous of his new friends. He sent his family across the Serpent Spine Mountains to keep them safe and knew nothing of what may have happened to them since. Vegalys turned to his fellow questioners and asked what they thought should be done with this man. After some deliberation it was decided that the farmer should be remanded to the Temple in Qeynos to aid in discovering how his artifact had held back the plague. <br>
<br>
Once all was done, Vegalys turned to his helpers and rewarded them for their aide, to one young druid, he gave enough money to buy his next circle of spells, one more got coin, upon turning to Tymoria though, he had no coin to give, but a token. He handed Tymoria a Token of Bravery for her aide in this endeavor, saying only that she should give it to Jaylia the Faithful for a gift worthy of her aid that day. Halfway home to Qeynos Tymoria was struck all of a sudden by a summoning!<br>
<br>
When she opened her eyes again she found herself in front of Jaylia the Faithful and stood a moment in stunned wonder at her mode of transport. She then walked up to Jaylia and after a bit of conversation handed her the token saying that Vegalys had told her to hand it over to Jaylia. At that moment Tymoria was given the greatest honor of her life as Jaylia stepped forward and shouted for all of Qeynos to hear, &quot;Hear ye, Hear ye! Recognize now that you hold a hero of great worth and valor among you! Tymoria has been proven in the eyes of the gods! As within the mortal realm, this name shall be known within the eternal halls of the Realm of Heroes!&quot;<br>
<br>
Jaylia then handed a soft, silken bundle to Tymoria with a kind smile. Unfolding the bundle, Tymoria gasped at discovering it was a veil of incalculable worth! &quot;It is the Silken Veil of Lyrae young one&quot; stated Jaylia warmly. Tymoria donned the veil proudly, displaying it for Vegalys and her companions with excitement. &quot;Not till the day I die will I remove this precious gift!&quot; she exclaimed with bright tears of joy in her eyes. <br>
<br>
And to this day, she still wears it with pride, caring not weather she could earn or purchase one of greater usefulness, but content in knowing the personal accomplishment it represented. For some time later, the artifact she had helped to find did in fact help to banish the cursed plague from the plains forever. In the end, she may not regard this day as her greatest deed, but it will always be remembered as her first. <br>
