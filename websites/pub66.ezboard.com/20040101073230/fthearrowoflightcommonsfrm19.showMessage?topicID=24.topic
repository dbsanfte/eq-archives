It is a great game where you can relax, play and develop a character who can do all sorts of things that you can't do in real life.  Where you can run all over the world of Norrath killing bad guys (or making a bad guy your friend..Sytox) and meeting great people from all around the world.  People who become your friends and who one day you just might meet in real life.<br>
But just like real life bad guys, really bad guys exist in EQ as well.<br>
I will share my story with you all. You have heard it before, just like I did, but I said the same thing you are thinking.  &quot;It will not happen to me, I am to careful&quot;.  <br>
On Sunday the 25th just before the 4 o'clock, I received a tell from &quot;Feigndeth&quot; (no guild attachment).  He said he was &quot;Sytox's alt and needed my help real bad, please&quot;.  &quot;Sure, old friend, what do you need, anything&quot;.<br>
You see Sytox sponsored me into the Arrows of Light when I was level 13.  I would do anything for him or anyone else in our guild.  You ask and I will do my best to help, no questions asked.<br>
He needed to borrow some pp to buy a BP for his new SK that someone was selling real cheap in the Nek Forest.  Would I loan him some pp.  &quot;Sure, I only have 4845pp in my bank, would that do?&quot;  &quot;That is fine, please bring it to the book in the Nek forest.  I will meet you there.&quot;  &quot;omw, old friend&quot;<br>
(into zone I go).. &quot;Hey old friend, here you go&quot; I hand him 4845, hit the trade button.  ....................................something starts to stink.<br>
I get a &quot;thanks&quot;, then I get a request to look at my equipment.  &quot;Can I borrow your BP, Belt and your weapon.  I really need to help this toon.  I will return it tomorrow.&quot;  Now, I am getting a little worried.  My weapon is &quot;Ranger Only&quot;.  hmmmm  &quot;Sytox, your toon is a SK it can not use my weapon.&quot;  &quot;I know&quot;, he says...  alarms are starting to go off...damn.  &quot;Hey, Feigndeth, meet me in the PoK and I will give you some armor and weapons that I have in the bank that you can use. OK?&quot;  &quot;nah, can't this computer is acting up, it crashes when I zone&quot;. ....more alarms are going off, sweaty palms I now have.  &quot;OK, give me back my pp and I will go get the armor and weapons and bring them back to you here. OK?&quot;  &quot;No, I am going to camp and Sytox will meet you in PoK&quot;.  He camps.    <br>
Damn, I have been scammed, I just know it. Damn, double damn. <br>
But I go to PoK anyway.  I wait.  I wait some more.  Oh..I am getting sick.  I contacted friends and asked if they know if Sytox had an alt named Feigndeth, but all said they not sure, but didn't think so.<br>
I wait some more, but nothing happened.<br>
Sytox someone used your name, my friend and I feel bad and sad that someone would do that.  I fell for the oldest scam around, and by posting this we can maybe stop someone else from being fooled also. <br>
I made the mistake, I acted to quickly with the hand over. It was my fault.  I petitioned and reported it, but as of this moment nothing from the GM's.  I know they can not give me back my pp, that is not the point.  I am hoping they can figure out who it was.  Probably not, he might have made the toon just to rip off people then he delete's the toon.  <br>
Anyway, you all watch out. <br>

Something I do all the time wether I'm trading with a freind or not is /log and pictures up the ying yang, of the trade window of the text, of the date/time.  Because of two reasons. <br>
1) There have been alot of bugs reported on trades latly<br>
2) Stupid lil' pieces of cow dung like Fiegndeath<br>
<br>
I'm real sorry you had to go through that.  that kind of playing behavior is a servere exploit.  But sadly, I do not think SoE cares of players being exploited by in game cheats. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.eq-arrow-of-light.com/sigs/asyth.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E6E8fA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub66.ezboard.com/bthearrowoflightcommons.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aevetare>Aevetare</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Arrows own Multiple Personality</span><br>  Posts: 330<br> <font color=#000080>(5/26/03 7:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I got stupid and got ripped off...you all learn from me.</span><hr size=1> This is really a sad story, TJ it is unfortunate that it happened to you.  Lets try to take away something from this:<br>
<br>
 NEVER give your stuff to anyone that you don't know.  If someone comes on and says  &quot;I am so-and-so's alt and I need help&quot; then you need to ask them: &quot;<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Can you log your main on and I will tranfer stuff for you?</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->&quot;  (Put the burden on them to give you stuff first to transfer).<br>
  I think any of us who have alts/mains will be willing to present you with OUR stuff to trust you to transfer it to an alt of OURS.  We would be willing to proivde the pp, items etc off one char up front, FIRST to give to another character.<br>
  I don't think any of us would just approach a guildie and claim to be an alt of someone in the guild without being willing to log the main in to verify.  And again, it is very unlikely that anyone in the guild would beg or ask you anything unreasonable -- if you got a feeling in your gut and the warning lights are going off, it IS PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE TO REFUSE TO HELP.  We understand scamming occurs, and we have to be alert about it.<br>
  Once I was in the bazaar and some guy said that he would buy Aevetare's Deepwater Greaves for 13k, but the pp was on his main and he gave me some name, and he wanted me to hand him the greaves first then he would camp and bring on his main.  I refused, I said bring on your main first.  He wouldn't because the money was on this character.  I said, no deal, see-ya!  It was my hard-earned item and if I didn't feel right about the transaction, then it was my right to refuse.   Needless to say, neither the guy or his main ever sent me a tell about the greaves after that, so I firmly believe it was a scam-interruptus.<br>
<br>
  Somewhere, someone recently posted that in one of these future patches they are going to set up a feature to allow you to trade items from one char to another on the same account.  It will quickly eliminate these sorts of scams, but until that time, everyone learn from TJ's misfortune.<br>

Another guild said they had a member the night before your incident ripped over for 12K in the same manner, but a different character name.  <br>
<br>
The GM's are notorious for doing nothing, but they CAN if you irritate them enough, check on this name and find out who owns the account and ban the account.  My suggestion to you of petitioning daily still stands.  It works, they hate that! Also send an email to eqtech@soe.sony.com.  Sometimes this gets their attention faster.  <br>
<br>
Again, I am sorry there are people like this in the game, but as in RL, some people just SUCK! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E6E8fA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub66.ezboard.com/bthearrowoflightcommons.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tjsonoftark>tj son of tark</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arrow of Light</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#000080>(5/27/03 8:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I got stupid and got ripped off...you all learn from me.</span><hr size=1> Aevetare/Mugo and Adienna<br>
<br>
You both are so correct.  It was completely my fault.  I just reacted so fast to my friend Sytox request.  I never dawned on me that it was not Sytox until I hit that trade button.  I have never had anyone ask for help like that and I wanted to help Sytox because like many of you I have been on the receiving end of Sytox's generosity.  I just wanted to help so bad that it never entered my mind that it was not Sytox.  NOT until I hit that button..(bang)..that is when I realized I jumped to quick.  My fault.  But, I believe that my mistake will have some good to the rest of the quild and we all can learn from both of your's advice.  Thank you both and believe me I will be a much more protective from this moment on.<br>
Adienna, I have done what you suggested, but no response yet.  I agree, I know they will not do much.  And I truly think this thief just makes up a toon, hits someone, transfers the loot and deletes the toon.  But one day he will screw up.  If not in EQ in RL.  Keep in mind &quot;you reap what you sow&quot;.  <br>
