<br>
What is it?<br>
The Merit Council is the KoF’s formal loot distribution mechanism.<br>
<br>
Why?<br>
For the betterment of the Guild and its members.<br>
<br>
What does “Merit” mean?<br>
Karma is a genuine force in the EQ universe. What goes around, comes around. What you put in, you’ll get out, in time. Work hard for the Guild, be selfless for the Guild, and you will reap the benefits of being a member of the Guild.<br>
<br>
Who’s on the Merit Council?<br>
The MC is made up of three permanent members and two rotating members (chosen from the general raiding body). Chairing the council is the Warden of the Keep, the Sergeant of the Shield, and a quarterly elected non-officer general member. <br>
<br>
Who are they?<br>
The Knights’ current Warden is Delvean.<br>
The Knights' current Sergeant of the Shield is Paflin.<br>
The elected member of the MC is currently Marita. <br>
<br>
Placement: <br>
The two rotating members for each meeting of the Merit Council are nominated by the appropriate raid leader.<br>
When it is time for the General Membership position to be re-allocated, nominations will be open for two days, and a vote will be conducted for another two days. At the end of the fourth day, a tally will be made and the position will be given to the nominated member with the most votes. If there is a tie then the guild leader will make an appointment from those nominees that are tied. Members will be entitled to serve subsequent terms if such is the will of the voting membership.<br>
<br>
Responsibility and Jurisdiction: The Council is responsible for allocating loot drops in support of (not instead of) the Champion program, as well as to general guild membership, during OFFICAL GUILD EVENTS only. The MC should be focused on keeping the membership fairly equipped and efficient. It's their call to determine best use, their call is final, and may only be over-ridden by the guild leader. A majority decision among MC members is enough to decide the winner of any item. Any complaints against the MC should be directed to the Counsellor, Seneschal, or Guild leader.<br>
<br>
General Standing Policy: <br>
<br>
1. Loot will be awarded firstly based on a pre-specified (“reserved”) basis. If loot drops that was not previously reserved, it will be awarded to members based on the MC’s assessment of relative merit and relative need. Factors to be considered are:<br>
<br>
A) Contribution to the guild through upholding our core values of Honor, Assistance, Friendship, and Nobility, as well as level of participation in raids and groups, leadership (not to be confused with officership), and recruitment.<br>
B) Magnitude of the upgrade and availability of other upgrades for that character.<br>
C) Prior awards given by the Merit Council.<br>
D) Presence at the raid.<br>
<br>
To make this decision the MC will refer to both the member’s Magelo profile and the member’s equipment wishlist. In order to qualify for this second-priority level of loot distribution, members MUST have put in the effort to create a Magelo profile and a wish list (see the posts in the Hall of Steel for guidance).<br>
<br>
1a. All droppable items gained through the Merit council will be returned to the Council by the winner once he or she obtains an upgrade to that item, so that it may be re-dispositioned. Members violating this policy may have their membership subject to review. Members awarded items by the MC are encouraged (though not required) to donate their “old” item (if droppable) to the Council for re-disposition, resulting in the betterment of multiple guild members from each piece of loot obtained.<br>
<br>
1b. Decisions on NO DROP items must be treated with particular care by the Council and with particular trust and leniency by the membership.<br>
<br>
1c. “Presence” is not required for loot to be awarded by the Council at a raid, but it does count.<br>
<br>
1d. Droppable or MQable epic items which are not pre-reserved and are acquired on official guild raids will be put into the Guild Vault for use by the first guildy to be able to turn them in for use in their epic. Such items deemed 'excess' may be sold at the guild leadership's descretion.<br>
<br>
2. Members of the Council are encouraged to attend as many guild events as time permits. If fewer than two members of the Council are available to distribute loot at a given event, then the responsibilities of the MC for that event are passed by default to the Inner Circle, where a majority decision wins. If there are fewer than two Inner Circle members available, then the responsibilities of the Merit Council are further passed on to the officers of the KoF for that event, where a majority decision wins. If there are fewer than two KoF officers available, then loot distribution will be made via random roll among any member who wishes to be included.<br>
<br>
3. If non-guild members are present at an official guild event and one of them wishes to be considered for an item, the Merit Council should make them aware, ahead of time, of the purpose of the raid and the means by which loot will be distributed (i.e. by Merit Council ruling).<br>
<br>
4. The policies of the Merit Council are subject to change and modification by the Inner Circle, Guild Leader and Merit Council themselves. All agreed changes will be posted and declared when applicable. <p>Fluffee Bunnee <br> 51 Warrior <br> Knights of Freedom <br> <a target=new href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=105919>Not a twink</a><br> </p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub66.ezboard.com/bknightsoffreedom94013.showUserPublicProfile?gid=charcoth>Charcoth</A> at: 10/12/03 9:49 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub66.ezboard.com/fknightsoffreedom94013frm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=681.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub66.ezboard.com/fknightsoffreedom94013frm1.showNextMessage?topicID=681.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fknightsoffreedom94013frm1.emailToFriend?topicID=681.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fknightsoffreedom94013frm1.threadControl?topicID=681.topic><img src=http://home.cfl.rr.com/trouble1/images/closed.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fknightsoffreedom94013frm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=681.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fknightsoffreedom94013frm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=681.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub66.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="knightsoffreedom94013frm4">Administrations Office<option value="knightsoffreedom94013frm8">Bubble's Garden<option value="knightsoffreedom94013frm24">Cavalier's Den<option value="knightsoffreedom94013frm1">Community Hall<option value="knightsoffreedom94013frm32">Acquisitions/Battle Roster<option value="knightsoffreedom94013frm15">Fellowship<option value="knightsoffreedom94013frm6"> BattleRoom<option value="knightsoffreedom94013frm9">Hall of Lore<option value="knightsoffreedom94013frm25">Hall of Mind<option value="knightsoffreedom94013frm10">Hall of Steel<option value="knightsoffreedom94013frm36">Hall of Decoration<option value="knightsoffreedom94013frm27">Supply Room<option value="knightsoffreedom94013frm11">Advancement<option value="knightsoffreedom94013frm17">Inner Courtyard<option value="knightsoffreedom94013frm31">The Gate House<option value="knightsoffreedom94013frm22">Squires' Barracks<option value="knightsoffreedom94013frm14">Knights' Barracks<option value="knightsoffreedom94013frm13">Command Room<option value="knightsoffreedom94013frm30">Merit Council<option value="knightsoffreedom94013frm12">Council Chambers<option value="knightsoffreedom94013frm28">Dungeon Keep<option value="knightsoffreedom94013frm34">General Archive <option value="knightsoffreedom94013frm29">Knight's Archives</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFCCC>- </font><a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/bknightsoffreedom94013>Knights of Freedom</a><font color=#FFFCCC> - </font><a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fknightsoffreedom94013frm1>Community Hall</a> <font color=#FFFCCC> - </font><a href="http://www.eqknights.com">Knights of Freedom</a><font color=#FFFCCC> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246h<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
