And no evil is greater on Norrth than that spewn forth by the countless denizens of the dead.   Always shall you find our kind engaged with endless battle upon battle with these foul spoor.<br>
<br>
That is why my fellow Paladin and Friend Xenophon and I took it upon ourselves to rid the depths of Guk from as many of them as we were able.  <br>
<br>
The Froglok city of Guk is a damp, dark and rotting hole in the earth which only its inhabitants would find comfort in.  A perfect location for the dead to thrive and worm their way to other parts of the land.  That the Frogloks themselves tolerate their presence, and do nothing to remove the creatures, almost makes them as deserving of  my blade as the ghouls present below thier feet.  Barely am I able to keep my rage in check when near these loathsome toads.<br>
<br>
Thus Xenophon and myself entered their lair with our swords drawn and purpose in our stride.   Many Frogloks who noted the stern looks on our faces made way and let us by with no more than an ugly Frooak and devious looks.  The farther we went into this pit the better we could sense the presence of the dead and decaying monstrosities, and it wasnt long before we came upon our first victim.  With quick and true strokes did we easily dispatch the first wave of ghouls that struck at us.  Many of them did we slay and yet all the more seemed to crawl forth from the darknesses below.<br>
<br>
It was then that Xeno,  who did possess a few more seasons than I,  came up with a plan.  He proposed a strike at the very heart of the beasts.  To work our way to the deepest chasms and destroy them from the inside out.  Just as would be done with a hive of insects.  <br>
<br>
Although this was indeed a bold and dangerous move,  we felt that our skills and the favor of our Gods would indeed see us through this peril.  And as we prepared for our quest we called upon our Dieties to bless us and our weapons so that we could better dispatch our foes.  And using magick that has been learned and passed down from generation to generation of Paladins, thru decades of struggle against the powers of the undead,  we made ourselves invisible to thier lifeless eyes.  Easily slipping through the dark passageways and stairwells we crept further and further below,  passing countless numbers of the foul brood.<br>
<br>
When at last it seemed we could go no further, we set a firm grip on our hilts and tried to find a place to start our attack.  Slowly making our way around a corner we came into a small room.  In the farthest corners on both sides were 2 of the larger undead knights.  We believed that we could destroy them quickly enough before they were able to raise an alarm to our presence.  <br>
<br>
With a fierce cry of hatred Xenophon charged one of the beasts who,  to this moment unaware of its fate, turned to find the source of the curse hurled at it and was met with singing steel.  With the first ghoul being cut down by Xeno I stepped in front of the the other as it made its way toward him and struck it senseless with a fast blow from my shield.  Suddenly many sickly gutteral chants seemed to fill the room.  The sound seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once, and from the corner of my eye i saw Xenophon twinge with pain as several blisters raised up on his flesh.  Flame and ice ripped at him and although he was able through sheer force of will continue his struggle i could see that he was quickly weakenng.  Searching desperately with my eyes I tried to discern the source of the Magick,  and noticed that the fall of the torchlight upon the back wall did not quite look right.  Stunning the ghould that i had been fighting I moved to the wall and realized what trickery we were dealing with.  A false wall to conceal thier numbers.  As I stepped through my hopes bagan to fall as i noticed 3 powerful wizard's before me.  All of them engrossed in concentration trying to destroy the most formidable of us first.  Xeno could not take much more of this.<br>
  <br>
Quickly shouting to him to step behind the wall,  I waded into battle hitting as hard as I could and stunning them as much as possible to break thier concentration from thier incantations.  Xeno followed suit and turned his attentions to the wizards,  fighting for all he had while the undead knights rianed blow upon blow to his back with rotting fleshy fists.  <br>
Just when Xeno seemed that he was about to fall from the wounds being inflicted on him, he lifted his sword, and put one hand upon his chest.  Ignoring his pain he closed his eyes and quickly muttered a prayer to his God.  Within seconds many of his wounds disappeared and he continued the fight with a renewed vigor.  Noticing that he had been protected by some divine power the ghouls seemed to fear him and turned their brutal attacks on me.  <br>
<br>
As I had sustained many wounds and was growing weaker by the second, Xeno was doing all he could to deflect  their agressions from me.  Two of the ghouls fell before his might, but still there were too many for him to occupy.  Then, just as I started to feel this life slipping away from me I repeated what I had witnessed Xeno do not moments before.  I called upon Karana to protect me and to make me an instrument of his will.  Long would I serve him on this earth until he had deemed my service complete.<br>
<br>
In his divine wisdom he must have felt that my time had not come.  For just as has happened many times before I felt his healing touch course through me,  renewing my strength and energy.  <br>
<br>
The batttle had still not yet ended, but the servants of evil quickly seemed to draw back, for they knew that victory was impossible for them while Xeno and I both had such divine intervention on our side.  However by thier very nature, and because of their absolute hatred for anything pure and good,  they continued to fight on.  And only after much bloodshed from both sides did we finally abolish the last of their number.<br>
<br>
Weary from our long fight and needing to recover from our injuries, we sat down among the mutilated bodies of our foes.  Although our kind find nothing more displeasing than the smell and feel of the rotting viscous substance vomited from these unholy vessels,  we had no other choice but to bear this.  <br>
<br>
Silently nodding my head to Xeonphon it was understood betwwen the both of us that no thanks or congratulations was necessary either for or from one another.  To this very day we have fought bravely beside each other and this was, to us, just one more well met battle in our continuing war.  <br>
Slowly rising to his feet Xenophon only seemed more determined to exterminate the rest of the undead from this pit.  The glint of flame in his eyes spurred me on as well.  Extending his arm and grasping mine, he helped me to my feet.  With a firm shake and and clasp of the shoulder he then turned and we made our way through the Dungeon once more, defying all those who stood in our way.  And Knowing that we were going to, once again,  see the light of day as long as we fought beside each other.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm23.showPrevMessage?topicID=11.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm23.showNextMessage?topicID=11.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic><img src=http://www.eq-arrow-of-light.com/aol/images/boardbuttons/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm23.emailToFriend?topicID=11.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm23.threadControl?topicID=11.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm23.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=11.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm23.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=11.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub66.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thearrowoflightcommonsfrm1">General<option value="thearrowoflightcommonsfrm4">/OOC Chat<option value="thearrowoflightcommonsfrm2">Raids and Events<option value="thearrowoflightcommonsfrm23">The Fireplace<option value="thearrowoflightcommonsfrm7">So You Want to Be an Arrow?<option value="thearrowoflightcommonsfrm17">Game Play Q & A<option value="thearrowoflightcommonsfrm13">Testing one...two...three...<option value="thearrowoflightcommonsfrm19">Rants, Whines and Whimpers</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000080>- </font><a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/bthearrowoflightcommons>The Arrow of Light Commons</a><font color=#000080> - </font><a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm23>The Fireplace</a> <font color=#000080> - </font><a href="www.eq-arrow-of-light.com">Home</a><font color=#000080> - </font><br><br> <script language="javascript">
