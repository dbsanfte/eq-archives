Well here it is folks, the long thought about Kedge Keep Raid.  PLEASE READ THE FINE DETAIL and know that we need to stay focused on our mission at least until we get situated in the camp locations.<br>
<br>
WHAT: Kedge Keep Raid<br>
WHERE:  Meet outside Unrest tunnel in Dagnors Caldron<br>
WHEN: Sunday, January 26, 11am PST/2pm EST<br>
WHO:  I need people to be 44+ for this.  I want to have at a minimum 2 full groups, 3 would be ideal (might be a little overkill for most areas of the zone but if we run into Estrella - lvl 51 or Phinny lvl 53 we will need the extra firepower).  I need a cleric and an evacer in each group and someone who can cast EB, at least 2 tanks in each group, it will be good to have on the raid the following people too:  at least one shaman, at least one enchanter, at least one mage, a bard or two would be nice....  I want to have at least one lvl 55+ tank for the MA.<br>
WHY:  We will be trying for some of Coddington's epic pieces, xp, drops, fun, learning, comraderie.  Leave the booze at home but bring ample supplies of fish scales.  Undertow, Phinny and the Corrupted Seahorse are our targets.  We will tour various areas of the zone if neither are up, tracking down other mobs that drop good stuff.<br>
<br>
Notes:  This will be my first major, orgainized raid into Kedge, so plan on it going slow and we are going to learn stuff along the way.  Plan also on 6 hours (if you have to leave early that is fine too).<br>
<br>
Other important info:  Kedge is an all underwater zone, there are NO air pockets, so enduring breath items are a must.  We will need to to have stacks and stacks of fish scales, Water Stones, potions, or other Enduring Breath items such as Fishbone Earrings and Rebreathers.  A Bard or two with Aerie Water would be extra helpful.<br>
<br>
More important info:  There is a huge treatise on Kedge posted on Allakazhims, here are the essentials to live by:<br>
1- Do not use AOE damage spells EVER.<br>
<br>
2- Do NOT kill the SHimmering Sailfins.<br>
<br>
3- Pathing is weird which means if they get too far from the puller they may bring friends; the puller should plan on getting up close and friendly with all mobs on the pulls.<br>
<br>
4- Pets need to be kept by your side at all times, even when fighting mobs (due to weird pathing).<br>
<br>
5- Charming (see pets)<br>
<br>
6- Spells:  All the inhabitants are immune to FEAR and COLD spells, probably for good reason (see pathing).  Do not use Flash of Light, Sunbeam, intimidation etc on them or we will get a bad train.  Fire is said to be the attack-type of choice for spells.<br>
<br>
7- If you have to go AFK for ANYTHING, be sure to get your EB buff refreshed.<br>
<br>
8- Because of the narrow corridors, everyone but the MA will be getting shrunk.  It might take some time to do this, so the beginning will be pretty slow.  Also, while moving through the corridors, expect one group to lag back while the first one or two moves ahead clearing rooms.  This is just a technicality due to the physical layout of the zone.<br>
<br>
Organization: We will assemble outside Unrest and get into two groups (or three).  I want to use the POP Raid system on this to even out xp across the groups.  Each group will have ONE designate looter, the group Leader.  I will also designate ONE person, the LOOT HANDLER, to handle rolls for all special drops.<br>
<br>
Special Drops:  When something drops off a mob, check to see if it is NO DROP.  IF it is NO DROP, tell the LOOT HANDLER WHAT it is, and link it for them.  THE LOOT HANDLER will then call for everyone who can use the item to send him/her a tell.  READ THIS AND UNDERSTAND IT:  The LOOT HANDLER will assign a number to those who have sent him/her a tell, than do a /rand 'x' to determine who wins.  For example, a Purple Widget drops from the mob, and it is No Drop.  Group Leader immediately tells the LOOT HANDLER the &quot;A Purple Widget has dropped&quot; and links it for him/her.  The LOOT HANDLER examines the item and asks for all the people who are on the raid to send him/her a tell if they are interested in having it.  So, lets say BooBoo, Yogi and Rick can all use the Purple Widget and have sent the Loot Handler a tell stating that they want it. The LOOT HANDLER states/shouts outloud the numbers assigned to each person; 'Booboo-1, Yogi-2, Rick-3', then rolls a /rand 1 3 to determine who gets the item.  Once the roll has been done, the Loot Handler tells that person to pick it up.<br>
  If an item drops that IS tradeable, the group looter will pick it up and give it to the Loot Handler, who will then proceed with the rolling as outlined above.  If you win an item, I am not restricting you from rolling again -- you roll on every item you can use.  All gemstones will be going to the host guild and will be used to reimburse clerics for any gemstones they may use.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Once a roll is completed the decision is FINAL.  If someone was gone AFK, wasn't paying attention, was busy chatting with grandma (who is watching the superbowl) on the phone while playing and missed the annoucements, the roll will not be re-done; you just have missed your chance and will have to wait for the next useful Widget to drop.<br>
<br>
Further note: Loot is done NBG (need before greed), if an item drops that nobody can use, it will be an open roll and awarded to whoever wins so they can sell, give to an alt, put in their guild bank, whatever.  If an item drops that you can't use with the character in attendance but you can use on an alt, sorry -- only those characters in attendance are allowed to roll.<br>
<br>
Why am I doing it this way?  Because it is more efficient and the loot can be divied out as we go.  If you do not like the idea of not being able to personally roll on items (The Loot Handler will be doing ALL of the rolling) then perhaps you should reconsider going on this raid.<br>
<br>
RESERVED ITEMS:  The drops for Coddington's epic only.  All other items are up for grabs.<br>
<br>
DRUID ITEM:  Undertow spawns near where the druid epic item drops, so when we get to that area we may stay a little while just to get the drop(s) for any druids.  If we have enough groups, we may just leave one group there to hunt.  Since MORRO from 1F has requested we stop there, if one drops first one goes to him.<br>
<br>
CHANNEL:  The raid channel will be &quot;KedgeRaid.&quot;<br>

Uh, the other mob I need is Phinny.  Hey, don't blame me, I didn't write the Mage Epic...<br>
<br>
I'll supply the Waterstones and hopefully I can Tinker up to Rebreathers/Aqualungs for the tanks before showtime.  For those who'd need to properly get &quot;in the mood&quot; for this zone, here's a link to the primo zone essay on KK:<br>

I haven't looked it up but part of the duid epic is in Kedge too I believe. If you have any druids, they might check if there's an item they can pick up there. I don't know if you get an item at Kedge or turn one in. Sorry to be a little vague here.<br>
<br>
Hehe, I enjoyed my last trip to kedge, although it's pain to keep looking at my timer to refresh the EB spells. Being A Druid(Morromid) I could use the opportunity to get whatever it is I'm talking about. LOL, Guess I'd better look it up.<br>

Are you taking guests on this raid? Hmmm? I'll bring some fish scales....<br>

I have Done that Kill once before when someone from the GCP needed a guide through Kedge to Its spawn point.<br>

It works Just like other Corrupted spawns.  1st a Tainted version of the Mob spawns and once killed, the Corrupted Version immediately pops in its place.  Just like the Giants in Rathe Mountains.  Im not sure exactly what the Name of the Drop is.  The Druid who we went to get it for never really said.<br>
<br>
Also wanted to mention the One of the pieces (and possibly toughest piece to get) For my Paladin Spell Epic can be found on the Ground Somewhere near Phinny's Lair.  Not sure of its exact Loc, or who often it repops,  But i will try to find out precisely.<br>
<br>
Btw .. The Sunday this is scheduled for is indeed Super-bowl Sunday.  So Unless the raid is started early enough.  You possibly may get some low attendance due to that reason.<br>
I will also have to Mark myself Tentative Unfortunately as I do already have Plans for that Day ..  Just not sure what time exactly.<br>
<br>

The necro might be better due to the high leel of the mobs that we have to deal with, and if chanters are low the screaming terror is nice to have.<br>
<br>
Montag - The item you are referring to is a 'finger bone' that is found on a rock down inside Phinny's Lair.  It is not needed for the pally epic, but it IS needed for the lvl 49 spell Divine Might.  Grab me sometime when Stumbles is on and we can go pick up most of those items in about an hour, with the exception of this one.  When I went to get this bone, I left all my gear in the bank except one sword, grabbed 6 potions of underwater breathing and a few of invisibility and set off alone down into Kedge.  Luckily Phinny wasn't up, but some of the Swirlspine Guardians in his lair see thru invis so I was pretty nervous about doing it.  Also, the mobs surrounding Estrella see invis too, it was harrowing to get in and out... but I did it.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
As far as this being a GCP event, I wanted to get a feel for how many people will be able to go from Arrows, but I am pretty certain that it will be ok for our allies to come with us (One Fellowship and Heart of the Dunedain, even Cleon and Roewane from True Valor...).  I just don't want a zone full of 40 people all running around chaotically and not paying attention -- that will be a sure-fire way to make this a bad event.<br>
<br>
I placed it up on EQraids and tried make it a GCP event but all I could do was make it 'Locked'.  I was not able to invite 'Allied Guilds' (such as the GCP).  Anyone know how I can do this?<br>
  Once I figure out how to do that, please sign up FAST to save your spots; I am going to limit it to about 18 people, maybe allowing a few more depending on the average level of the raid force.<br>

When you created the event it should have had a checkbox that said &quot;include allies&quot; or something like that ... that needed to be checked ... you should be able to edit it.  That'll add  the GCP folks, but HotD can't be added until they're official allies and added to the ally list by Tym.<br>

9- Everyone with a STA less than 100 will need Shammy buffs to bring them up to 100+.  Swimming is strenuous work and your bar will be empty after the first 5 minutes, and it will stay that way for the next 5 hours 55 minutes.<br>

<br>
I would enjoy this raid and as you said to visit you here due to the Everquestraids issue..... BOO!<br>
<br>
Diadriel is out for the Raincaller piece if we can do it, but mostly for the learning aspect. Whereever you need her, I have lots of scales, but will get more. My exp in The Grey should help with that. However, I will offer my bard, tho she is low, if that is who is needed just to sit and sing the songs for a group.<br>
<br>
I will keep a watch here and on the raids site should you be able to get us allowed in. Thanks for all this hard work!<br>
<br>
Hoping to hunt with you soon!<br>
