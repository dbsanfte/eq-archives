this was my first time being a group leader in a raid, and it was made far easier for me I think because you payed such carefull attention ot everything that was happening.

<br>
I had a blast!!  Was a very well organized and well run raid!<br>
<br>
One thing I did notice .. to Bombudil's comment ... we didn't really get much xp in the raid ... and we didn't use the raid channel out of habit &lt;grin&gt; Everything was in the normal chat channel or in /groupsay.  Old habits die hard.<br>
<br>
It probably won't be an issues if we didn't use the PoP raiding feature?  <br>
<br>
Although I must admit it makes grouping MUCH easier!<br>
<br>
Thanks again!!<br>

  I think overall it was a good raid, up until the last room where I was afraid we were over-extending ourselves a bit due to lack of enchanters.... and was right.<br>
<br>
  Thanks to all our guild allies and friends who showed up, we have more than enough to do the whole zone (and had we been accompanied by a couple enchters Phiny's lair would have been a snap too).  It took a little time to get organized outside Unrest, but I had all the groups pre-decided beforehand so it was probably about as minimal as you can get.  A few people who said they were coming didn't, and a few who didn't did....  we managed just fine with about 20 total people.<br>
<br>
  Our first stop was the Golden Mermaid lari on the second floor in the south alcove, we killed 3 seahorses there but the mermaid was not up so we did not get any drops for our rangers and their Raincaller Bow quest -- better luck next time.  Two groups led the charge down to wipe out the mermaid room above Cauldronbubble's lair, while the other 2 groups went down to dispatch that shark; but alas, he was out for doughnuts too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   so we headed to the safe room.<br>
<br>
  This is where we hit our first snag; a couple people got lost (and it is easy to do in Kedge with it's 3-D tunnels where you can go up or down, left or right, back or forward...) and the mermaids spawned on them and poor Tym went down.  We quickly put an end to the mermaids plans to ambush us, got Tyms corpse ande did a quick rez in the safe room.<br>
<br>
  From there we moved to Estrella's lair, she was up but I decided to bypas her and go for Undertow's lair to start with, so we got rid of 3 pesky mermaids and headed to the Temple of Prexus in search of Undertow.  We got there in fairly short order, had some stilletto fang pirahna soup and Xenophon set out to pull us the various mobs within the area.  Undertow himself was also at the doughnut shop so we were not able to get him, but we DID get lucky enough to have a Corrupt Seahorse spawn and grats to Scary on winning the lotto on the druid epic piece drop!  We will do this area again soon, it is easy to get to and the camp is decent xp.<br>
<br>
  As we sat there outside Undertow's Lair it became obvious to me that we had a good strong group, so I decided that it was time to take out Estrella.  We made all the preparations nad headed back down to her lair.  We WOMPED the first 3 mermaids in no time flat, excellent work I must say.  When we started scouting for Estrella we found.. she was GONE!  Perhaps another group came in and took her out while we were after the corrupted, but that's how it goes.  Another day Estrella, another day.  Xeno pulled the ramianing few mermaids around Estrella's dias and Montag got his book to drop from Nyreil (sp?) the Beguiled.<br>
<br>
  We then made a rush for the far side of Estrella's room only to be beset upon by about 5 mermaids!  The fight was intense, and I thought for sure we were in trouble, but we came out of it in good shape.  The Priestess dropped an item but unfortunately it was for a human caster of Karana -- very specific and nobody could use it, so we had to let it rot. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
  We then moved towards CauldronBoils lair -- and he was right at eye level!  So Xeno hurridly pulled him to our ambush and we made sharkskin handbags and shoes out of him.  He dropped a Sharkbone Warhammer which was lottoed off -- I forget who won it.  We then moved to the Seahorse Patriarch room and after clearing it of it's three inhabitants we prepared for our adventures in Phinny's lair.<br>
<br>
  After buffing up we headed into the entrance of Phinny's Lair where we attempted to pull the Guardian Swirlspines singly -- but they all came charging at us.  It was a close battle - I personally KNOW that I would  have gone down if one of the pallies in the group had not used Lay On Hands on me (thank you!).  We were able to survive the onslaught, but we lost a couple people here.  I quickly rezzed them and we prepared for soem more.  Montag won the roll to go into Phinny's lair and grab the fingerbone from th efloor -- part of teh pally Divine Might quest.  He went down and got it, but we had to fight 2 more Swirlspines in the meantime.<br>
<br>
  As we waited for the fingerbone to respawn, the room filled itself with more Swirlspines, a full spawn.  We decided it would be best to attempt to use invis so teh pallys could go down and pick up the fingerbone without the seahorses getting upset... but even the best laid plans have flaws.  One of them saw through the invis and all hell broke loose.  The seahorses aggroed someone up on teh ledge and all 4 came barreling in on us again; this time we weren't so lucky.  About half the party went down, the other half evaced out to safety (Glad it wasn't a total party wipe-out!).  After a little reorganizing Corri invised me and I got an EB and I swam quickly to the area of carnage.  Byrdsong and Deloit were still there - having wisely camped out to safety.  We formed a group and I commenced the rezzing.  The only 2 corpses we couldn't get were Xeno and Montag's who were down in tehpit with the seahorses, so Sytox gated to the zone and summoned corpses (Very Very Much appreciated Sytox! -- I didnt want to have to send Mugo into that place to do a CR).  Everyone else evaced to the zone and we finished the rezzing.<br>
<br>
I can't say thanks enough to all those who came, and apologize to those who died.  We didn't reach our goal of getting the epic pices for Coddington, but we did get something for Scary and (perhaps just as important) a little training into the nuances of Kedge.  I expect to be doing this again in a week or two, mainly to get druid epic drops and Undertow for one raid (plan a 3 hour raid for this) and then do a seperate raid for Phinny where we can have a few more clerics and enchanters along to do Crowd Control on those nasty Seahorses.<br>
<br>
Grats to all those who won items, hearty thanks to those who joined us.<br>

<br>
Thanks for the Great raid! You did a marvelous job leading the group of us through one of the most confusing zones in the game. Very well done indeed.<br>
<br>
Sorry to hear about the disaster after I left, and my sincerest apologies to the raid for having to cut out after only 4 hours. It seems that when I left things got ugly &lt;ahem&gt;. Next time we go down I will double-check my calendar and make sure that I do not double-book myself!<br>
<br>
As a possible suggestion for Phinny's lair: I was one of two bards in the raid party that could have been utilized for crowd control on the seahorses. I frequently mez up to three targets simultaneously when fighting in KC (my new favorite zone), so Byrd and I could have been used to control them then. I did not want to confuse the issue by brining it up to you at the time (I know how much spam raid leaders have to deal with during an event), but I would suggest it now. The big trick, of course, is pretargeting or figuring out who will mez which targets during the fighting.<br>
<br>
Again, great raid and thanks for all your effort in putting it together!<br>

Just a quick &quot;Thank You&quot; for organizing this sucessful raid, Phaith/Aev/Mugo.  While I didn't get what I came down there for other peeps did which made the raid worthwhile.  If it's possible, could we try other rooms and see about some of the cool drops I've read about next time?<br>
