<br>
I'm writeing this to give you a idea of Champions Eternals Hopes, dreams, and  Goals.  I'm going to be leading CE into the future, and I would like you to know I will always do my best to make it a good home.  I do carry the title of leader but would like you to know that in reality Im just another one of your friends, I am not into power Nor do I want to be the most powerfull Cleric in Norrath.  I do however want to have a home where I can spend my gametime with my family and friends.<br>
<br>
Originally Champions Eternal was created by me and a handfull of my friends  who were in a guild called Champions of Divinity.  We loved our home and for a long time it was a great guild then 50 plus power and greed destroyed it and it was left powerless and without even one group of 50 plus, all of our strongest poeple merged with another guild northern cross,to form souther cross alliance (I dont even think it exists anymore) and a handfull of us 35 to 45 were left to rebuild it.<br>
 <br>
At that time I was Known as Zeldor Ironfangz a lvl 45 warrior, I hadnt been to active in the guild but decided I didnt want to see it fail. So... I started a new Char named Chosen, I figured a cleric could rebuild and draw in way more people than a warrior would.  I was a officer already and the leader never set any restrictions on invites, So I invited!! And I invited Lots! All my reallife friends Nomarian, halfsight, Kenlor, Battlescar and many other great people like Mobad, savatis, and the others you probably all know so well.<br>
<br>
We had great times we hunted together everynight and did anything we could for each other, we were tight inseperable. Then one day we had a dispute in a guild raid I led to try to get all our guild members jboots (we moved onto island and stayed takeing shifts) Anyways the leader of the guild made a bad loot call screwed someone out of there ring and awarded it to his cousin (we were only like 4 rings into this camp), there were many people mad and a few actually left the guild on the spot.  We talked about this on the guild board and the leader said to bad if you dont like it leave Im the boss!<br>
<br>
Well we didnt like that and seeing as how I'd invited 80% of our poeple I gathered them all up and formed a guild called Champions Eternal, a place where 50 plus greed would never come between friends again,a place where all had a say and the right to speak there mind.  I was great in the field as a group leader but seeing as how I was a poor typer and cumputer dummy I felt I wasnt the right person to lead CE, well I was wrong I may not spell or type the best but I'm honest and have morals, I get hot headed from time to time but I will defend the people in my family till the end of time regardless of lvl or class.  Its my fault that this same fate has fallen upon CE as did CoD, this time however I will make sure it doesnt happen again.<br>
<br>
People in eq come and go they get bored with the game, join a rl friend in a diferent guild, leave for a ubber guild to try to get power and fame (BTW in time you'll all get nice things, no need to betray your family to do so), I cannot stop this but I can stop anouther enormus power shift.  Champions Eternal will stand on its own two feet, I will work overtime to rebuild CE in a timely manner expect new faces and lots of them.  Kuasha and Roustar will stand by my side as senior officers and I will be appointing more officers as soon as I figure out whats what after the merger. EVERY Player in Norrath is welcome in CE there are no Invite limits at this time (in the future this may change, I like to grow in sperts invite a bunch get to know eachother rid ourselves of the trash then invite more) My Officers and myself will be mass inviteing players of all lvls everyone gets a chance to be a Champion! We will weed out and remove any trash picked up along the way. This is what I did in CE sometimes inviteing 10 to 20 noobs a day (hehe I remember savatis pulling his hair out over it) But it worked Powa, Mezo and Many other of our greatest champs came from those mass invites.<br>
<br>
I have banked items on 4 char each new invite will get a gift from CE a welcome gift from there new family and friends, I want CE to be a guild For Players of all lvls we will need all our 1st to 10th lvl guys to have plenty of chanps to hunt with and the same for 20 to 30 and 30 to 40 and 40 to 50 and 50 to 60. WE MUST have little Champions and nurcher them and raise them as our own, or when we lose a few people here and there and look back to see whos comeing up the ladder well have noone there just like The old CE was at the end. Just like real life folks our children are our future!!!!<br>
<br>
People will lvl some fast some slow before you know it well have plenty of 50 pluses to go around, also I want to run events for these champs be it Games and tunoment in the arena for PP and prize or rapen newbee zones with our 50pluses backen them.  Give our youth something to look up to to strive for and as mezo and powa did DING DING DING they strived to catcht up and be 50 plus, as soon as CE has the power I will start leading Guild Keal/PoG/Hate/fear raids this wont be tomarrow guys and ToV well hehe thats a long ways off.  I know where to hunt to get our dropped spells and sum easy to get items good till 50th for our people, I have faith CE can be rebuild what I doubt is once yer all 50 plus can you do your part to hold it together and back it as it has you? <br>
<br>
I hope and pray that you will all do your parts as Champions to help in our effort to rebuild and stay as one, invite your friends the  people you hunt with, and all will be fine. There are brighter days ahead friends Ive been playing EQ since tunare was a new server trust me we'll be fine. Im not going to write a book on Champions Eternal behavior, Be Honorable or be gone!!!! Its that simple.  I'm here for you if you need me Kuasha will be setting me up a Guild E-Mail address so anyone can email me with there conserns, we will not ruin each others game time engrossed in tells.  We will use this board or emails unless its a emergency my gametime will be very buisy now trying to invite and help equip our new people. Thank you for listening and welcome to the New Champions Eternal!!!! Chosen<br>
