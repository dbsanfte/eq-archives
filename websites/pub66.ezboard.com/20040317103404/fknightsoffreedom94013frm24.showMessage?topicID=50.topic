Light green moss along the cavern walls abounded with every step.  A speckled yellow along induced a weaving pattern along the cavern floor.  Signs of an attentive poison abounded for those unknowing travelers to be enticed.  <br>
<br>
No fire was kept for even the low burning ember would attract that which we stalked through this night.  The Shamans coaxed our muscled to keep the warmth and the Rangers gave us the strength to endure through tormenting stillness.  <br>
<br>
Our numbers reached near ten fold that which ever ventured here and easily outnumbered those who have come before and failed.  Slowly through the enduring hours we progressed through the damp cavern.  Large stalactites held tight to the ceiling as through testing our faith to continue on. Through the night I believe we all felt the sobering feeling that this was no meager encounter.  <br>
<br>
Our six Clerics blessed our souls and the three enchanters we had brought out thoughts to focus from the ultimate task at hand.  It was then, as we all knew, time to carry on.  Humorously, several of us hinted at the darkest and delicate of us, the Shadow knight and hinted at him to wake the brutish warrior.  As expected he stretched slowly, got up, and kicked the warrior in the ribs releasing the respective growl from the oversized Ogre.  A few of the smaller hybrids backed away as he rubbed the enacted spot from the kick, the rest held their grins lightly.  <br>
<br>
We packed what we could carry, but more weight us down through the hard passages. We Rangers through out the night fletched their mithril arrows; the Mages memorized the precise spells that would be required.  Clerics carried more and less then everyone, for throughout the night they carried our prayers, our hopes, and our dreams of seeing the light again.  <br>
<br>
As the last Rogue packed his satchel, a cry came from just ahead.  The horror, which we carried in nightmares the previous nights, was exactly that.  Visibly he had no embodied form, its head was encrusted with feelers and its eyes glowed red.  It came apparent then that the enemy was not hiding, not even dwindles in numbers from the previous nights battle, but more regrouping in their devilish lair and spying from across the chasm with their seemingly now apparent infrared vision.  <br>
<br>
The horrors came at us in waves it seemed.  Back to back for several hours.  Each falling horror replaced by another.  The warrior bade us fall back, but with every call the Wizards blew aside the nearest three horrors giving a little more ground for the next target to be reached.  There was no way then to hide our approach, anything near heard us coming as the brutish Ogre cried out as he had suffered a deep gouge by the serrated claws in the flank by one of the large and elder horrors.  <br>
<br>
The Rangers held a line well behind the foreword assault that held the oncoming horde at bay.  The calls of my fellow Rangers and that of our kindred Druids were heard well as the ground continually shifted as a vividly enchanted roots from hardened moss came alive, always holding the next assailant at bay so the most melee could to their work.  Streams of arrows glistened above heads and through what seemed as a perfect line assault not even scratching our force, but killing or easily weakening several of those trapped in the constant uproar of roots.  <br>
<br>
The busiest of us all though were the seemingly married team of the Barbarian Warrior which joined us from the Western regions of the divide and the youthful High-elf Cleric which we though would get broke in half by what he boasted, his dragon.  The team was not as high of level as most, but the pair of lovers held fast to one another and seemed to predict each other as if they were literally were a single entity.  <br>
<br>
The back row of horror vanished in a devastating sheet of arrows from the line of Rangers.  All grew quiet as the Clerics finished healing the raid.  Blood still flowed from wounds and some that seemingly would have been fatal were help tight by bandages and potions of healing.  The floor littered with the corpses of horrors of all types.  We rested for a moment and moved ahead ever so slowly as we entered the final lair.  <br>
<br>
Like the snakes hole we had finally found the place where the beast could turn to strike.  We saw what had haunted our dreams.  The Over fiend was there before us.  Larger and deadlier than the hordes before put together, there he stood.  Enchanted by his own lust, held in place to linger over his minions and treasures, there he was.  <br>
<br>
The open wounds we had were dry and crusted by the end of the chants.  The Warrior Ogre came to stand in front of me as if threatening a challenge.  I eyed him curiously as if to test his desires.  I knew it would have been a quick fight for even as I am druidic this particular warrior was renowned for his resistances to every position of magic.  His low garbled voice I could barely make out but in the deep tones of his voice held remorse.  All he said we &quot;Save some for me&quot;. <br>
<br>
I held my respective place in the back, but pondered his situation.  He had accepted his place and fate.  He knew he would likely die here and as much as it disgusted me, he had accepted it.  My respect for this once blobulous and unrefined man had grown over again.  I have live with him as my friend for many a year, and he with me since before I could remember.  <br>
<br>
His envy was of my freedom and mine of his ability to lead.  In our youth I worked with him to hone his skills and even work the obvious lust for sweets to a fiery battle machine.  In our time away from one another he had improved a hundred fold what I could never teach him.  But now, the one lesson he has tried to teach me for so long, I still cannot accept, his lesson was that of acceptance of defeat.  <br>
<br>
The thoughts rumbling in my mind were severed by the hum of numerous chants, which rang out as if rehearsed by a hundred years.  The Over fiend was there, before our eye.  He held a brilliantly luminous sword, one that showed red with anger.  Its shoulders as wide as a dozen bows stretched keel to keel. Then I realized.  The blade he held would be the same which would claim my friend, no, that blade would claim my family.  <br>
<br>
My blood grew colder with every breath.  The air being expelling from my lungs came in short gasps as the anger swelled towards that blade.  Every enchantment put upon me for the next fight seemed minor compared to the lust and reprieve that I felt I would get by driving my arrows into the very thing that held that sword.  <br>
<br>
All around me came cries of war then.  My brother leading all others to the defeat, which he felt, would be met.  He charged hard and fast to take the agro fast.  I saw the strain in his legs as he parried the first attack.  The sheer size and strength of the thing would have buried me where I stood, but not he.  <br>
<br>
His prowess had grown over mine so much then.  My archer brothers stayed beside me for my call.  I knew of the beast’s magic and slowing.  Casting would not help here, but our aim, my aim, would be at the eyes of the beast.  <br>
<br>
To Tunare I beckoned all my emotions and fired the first volley.  The truest of shots followed in that moment. Perfection of that multitude would have felled even Cazic Thule himself, or so we believed.  Every shot followed directly by another and each entered that enormous head through the same pupil.  <br>
<br>
The beast reared back in blind madness summoning the vast silence for all those around.  I saw then the sorrow, which befell my brother then, for his protective shield was taken.  The prayers were stopped.  The sensation we once felt of the hastening of our arms and focus of our minds was gone. Confusion went through me as I tried to summon even the slightest of spells, but nothing.  <br>
<br>
I fired as fast I could seeing the Over fiend weakening, but not enough.  I watched through tears as my brother was driven hard in that moment.  To my disbelief, the most powerful of us, Our Champion was down.  I called one last time for my spells and it somehow went off.  I was freed.  <br>
<br>
The next moments were a blur.  I dispelled all around me trying as best I could to get a hit in as I went.  The Clerics regained their ambitions for casting and the Wizards; I had never seen a more violent concussion as they lay their most devastating spells on command.  My crew of archers then engaged to do what they could, but I had to continue to lay what hope could be granted.  Everyone seemed to react well with the Clerics in control again, but my heart still needed my brother at my side.  <br>
<br>
The Barbarian Warrior fought bravely along with his wife, but even the duo were felled irrespirable fast.  Our only hope lay with who was not with us.  The last Cleric began his chant.  Looking at the Over fiend my eyes burned with anger as I charged beyond all rational thought.  The Clerics spell had gone off as needed, but the over fiend was already onto of him.  I barreled hard into the beast.  With all my rage and passion I cast as I went and received my reward, the over fiend turned.  <br>
<br>
I didn't realize it at first, but there were only the three of us left.  The Over fiend bled from all over.  It fought with the strength of forgotten and banished Gods, and already my arms felt numb.  The fight was almost done, but I knew I would fall before it was over. I struck hard and fast as I always did, but never before had I felt this type of strength.  I saw my brother stand firm, across from me, his huge arms swelled with blood, something I can only describe as that brought by madness.  <br>
<br>
I swung in again and again, but I could not keep the thing at bay.  The Over fiend swung hard, burying my swords to my sides.  In awe I could not move, and then I new what was next.  I had no more I could give, no more strength I could conjure.  I looked to my brother at that moment and new.  &quot;Save some for me&quot;.  <br>
<br>
I awoke in the snow off of the docks of Ice clad Ocean.  I needed to finish what had already started.  I called for my Cleric, but knew he was probably dead as well.  I began to run as fast as I could, knowing it would be in vein, but I could not stay.  Suddenly a light surrounded me and my prayer had been answered.  <br>
<br>
My eyes focused soon after I arrived in the horrid cavern.  The carnage of battle lay scattered around the large room.  I saw the couple, lying atop one another, her arms around his chest and praying with tears flowing from her cheeks.  My battalion of archers were dead, scattered about around the Over fiends corpse, there bows still in their backs and swords in their hands.  My brother was standing atop the beast with the biggest grin one could ever distinguish from the man.  We, our raid had succeeded.  <br>
<br>
Everyone joined us shortly after with the cheers of success throughout the cavern.  One or two horrors came to the cries of victory and were eagerly dispatched by the renewed fighters.  Loot was handed out to those that could use it, except for one piece. <br>
<br>
 Our dark-skinned traveler needed nothing and wanted no meager trinkets, nor the Cavaliers that engaged with us.  My brother spoke out then.  The trophy, which could never be swung by me for it's weight and size could not allow me to function as light footedly as I always had, he granted.  The sword, which caused my veins to boil with anger, was mine.  <br>
<br>
As I took the ancient sword for the dead grip of the Over fiend, the body began to melt away.  The stench rose about the cavern in an overwhelming stench.  The oldest evil anyone knew had finally been killed and with it came all the evil the controlled.  <br>
<br>
Some of us still bloody and some still wounded bade the raid leaders to be rid of this place.  The chants came almost before they finished asking, as all were anxious to be rid of this place.  The sky opened up and our sight melted away again.  Focusing our eyes came easier as we were in an open field of snow.  The patch we stood in was lush green somehow.  <br>
<br>
The sky had turned a lavish blue and streaked white with clouds.  A gently breeze blew with a slight warmth as a light rain began to fall.  The droplets slowly softened the dried blood from our bodies and possibly our souls a little.  I raised my arms high in praise to Tunare; she had humbled me I knew.<br>
<br>
I thought my self to be lost forever in the catacombs.  I stripped my bloodied gear and allowed nature to clear its foolish stench from within.  I noticed only then that the sword, my trophy, was birthed in a blue aura.  The droplets sang out a tune as it struck the ancient steel.  The melody echoed like a symphony through the swift breeze, a tune that turned our glances to one another.  <br>
<br>
We stared at one another for many moments as the sword's glow brightened past the point which it burnt our eyes, but still we watched one another.  The sword finally succumbed to it's own calming melody as it vanished from our sites.  As the melody dissipated for the final time, it rang our what seemed to be a distant voice.  &quot;Save some for me&quot;<br>

<br>
Well foremost, though I'm not one to talk as my on-line writing habits can be atrocious at times; paragraphs are a must when working with a work over 5 lines long. Otherwise it becomes very difficult to read, and especially hard on the eyes when your staring at a computer screen. Also from a punctuation sense, paragraphs do separate ideas, as they will regulate the flow of your words and ideas to the reader. Thus it is important to see to your paragraphs for the reader's sake.<br>
<br>
Any other feed back points can wait till you edit the paragraphs into your work. <p>Zimmierus<br>
