I promised! so here is my hopefully complete (but most likely cliff notes-like) recounting of my adventures over the weekend in the town of New Stonewatch.<br>
<br>
Well, for out of character reference-type information, heres how things got started lol.<br>
I arived at the soon-to-be New Stonewatch at roughly 12:30 in the afternoon. It was freezing cold, it was raining. . . . basicly what I was expecting.  So I grabbed my heaviest bag, my sleeping bag, and put on my coat (wool, not so bright) and headed for the modual building to ask where the cabin listing were.  Peperminnt had requested that she and ehr husband be in the same cabin as I was, #5.  So they told me to go to cabin #2 to find the listing and have fun.  So I had no clue where it was, but I figured I knew the general area, I thought I knew exactly what building it was inf act.  Gee. . . guess my directional senses from EQ pass over to RL, 'cause the cabin was actualy int he other direction.  So I turn myself around to where the man I asked for directions is pointing, and see that it is at the top of the talles hill in sight.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>*jaw drops*</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
ugh<br>
<br>
ok, so by now being wet, with tired arms, I head for the first set of stirs, about 15 steps per flight, 2 flights.  I get to the top of those, go up hill a bit, and go up another set of 2 flights . . . .I barely made it over the last step lol, my legs were just NUMB.<br>
<br>
I get to the cabin, and the genius that posted the list posted it high up, so I had to look up at it. . .  in the rain. . .  just under the lip of the roof with the runoff from the roof hitting me in the face, I look up, and get a face full of rain for my troubles lol.  So I take off the glasses and try to squint up at the list, eventualy, I decide I'm nowhere on it.  Peper and her hubby are there (from here refered to as Whysp and Azriel) in the cabin they wanted to be in with me, but I am nowhere on the entire list lol.<br>
<br>
So by now completely SOAKED, I go back to the modual building and ask the keeper there whats up, his basic gist is that they must have lost my registration, they can probably fix it t sign in at 6pm, but he cant do anything right now, and worst case scenario I would just be NPCing for this weekend instead of playing. EEP!<br>
<br>
<br>
So I decide to help set up while I wait for all this to happen and get some wildcard points while I do so.  well, the coat is a sodden mess. . . .  may as well go without it!  So now I am lugging around large heavy things in the freezing cold rain. . .  in my thin-as-anything-made-by-wal-mart, short sleeved shirt.<br>
<br>
needless to say, I got VERY wet, and VERY cold <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
eventualy a gent forced his jacket on me saying that I couldnt be feeling warmer indoors unless I had hypothermia, just put on the jacket!<br>
<br>
So I helped out till Wysp and Azriel arived, got dressed, got my area int eh cabin (yeah, the one I'm not supposed to be in) set up, and went to go watch them find my registration during check in lol<br>
<br>
Obviosly, things got sorted out and we got started happy happy.  Game began at about 10pm EST.<br>
<br>
Game's begining found Whysp and I heading for the Inn.<br>
.. . . . .. .... . . . ... . . . . .. . .. . . .. . . . . .. . . . ..  .. . .. <br>
<br>
It had been hours since thier last meal, so Whysp and Andra Cassidy (Tym) trudged thier muddy, hungry and sodden selves to the local Inn for some food and drinks to warm thier frozen innards and take in the news of the day.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
While munching on some hot chicken and partaking of the inn's fine dark ale, they had occasion to talk with some new folk in the town who had also come to the inn to escape the rain.  Andra saw this a sa prime oportunity to promote her charms, no, not <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>those</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> charms!  Andra Cassidy is not only a ranger, but a maker of charms!  She had only recently tken up the trade in earnest and truely needed to build a solid customer base, so in this spirit she let them in on her wares and that they should come over to her if ever they felt a need for the luck of the gods <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
After some time, a pale man entered the inn. . .  he had a washed out look about him that could only mean ghost, or at least undead. . . . after wandering aimlessly for a bit, he suddenly whirled and cast a spell of fear upon the entire inn!<br>
Well needless to say, Whysp and andra were no exception, in truth, Andra was the first out the door!<br>
<br>
Once the fearfull spell (pun intended <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) wore off, Andra and Whysp found themselves on the bridge crossing the stream that seperated the inn from the rest of the town.  They shake off the feelings of dread and decide Whysp should go to the Naked Rose to see if she could work tonight and earn some coin giving masages or dancing for customers.  Unfortunately, the Rose was not yet open, which both thought to be odd.  So with a shiver, they decided to travel to the Fae Circle to search for signs of spring.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately here is where a combination of Whysp's close to town nature and Anra's inexperiance nearly led to problems as they got lost int he dark trying to get there! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Eventualy they found a roud, upon that road they encountered Azriel of the tracker's guild and a compatriot of his, they kindly offered to guide the pair back to the tourney field safely and held weapons to the ready in case of problems.<br>
<br>
Having had a rather long day, they tried the Rose one more time and finding it closed still, the pair went off to bed to get ready for the next (hopefully drier) day. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>* I may have missed things in here, so if you remember anything peper, go ahead and add!*</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>*morning on Satyrday dawns cold and chill, but somewhat drier*</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Andra dragged herself from her tall bunk to ready for the day, she had heard of a comotion occuring in the cabin during the night, but had slept completely through it and so though not much of it.  Thinking it was a fine time to start her craft properly, she announced to those within her cabin that all those dweling there would recieve free god charms from her that morn in order to promote her wares.  This announcement kept her quite busy for the morning making a charm of Danubu, one of Voe, two of Camlyn, and a ward against evil thoughts.<br>
<br>
She and Whysp then headed out to begin the day (ok, it was after breakfast, but it was COLD!) by heading for the inn to find some food and drink, but alas, it was closed. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>*sigh*</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  So off they went to see if perhaps the Rose was yet open, but again, no luck.  So Anra dropped of two charms for a lady working in the tea realm and ledt with Whysp.<br>
<br>
And so, repeating the night before, the pair headed off to the fae circle to look for signs of spring and perhaps find some fae folk to play with.  They were stopped on the road onward by a woodswoman bearing dire warnings for them however.  First and foremost was that there was a Hunt of Peryn readying at Peryn's Retreat, any who entered and were not followers of the god would be forced to fight to the death!  She was there to prevent the innocent from being caught in the procedings, but not only this, but they would do well to hide thier elven ears, as Peryn hunters found elves and half elves to be impure, and so thinking, would rip thier ears off and trake them as trophies!<br>
<br>
Quikly covering her ears with a kerchif while Whysp pulled her hair over her own, they thanked the woman and told her where they headed, upon hearing they would go to the fae circle she warned them that it had been contaminated somehow, and there were consequently some renegade fae with nasty intentions about, but if we saw any fae, to keep them from entering the circle and becoming nasty as well.<br>
<br>
Well, with this dire news to bear with them, the pair set off to complete thier trek to the circle, along the way they strained to hear the whispers of the trees, but thier words were too jumbled and quiet to make heads or tails of!<br>
<br>
<br>
Upon finaly reaching the circle, they notice an odd light surounding it, but see no fae and hear not a peep from the trees to indicate anything of spring excepting a slacking in the rain.  Discouraged, the pair headed back to the tourney field by another rout than that they had took to get there, wanting to avoid the hunters of Peryn at any cost.  They had just completed negotiating a route along a nasty mire of mud and water, when they saw a being they took to be an orc heading right for them with a nasty glint in his eyes!<br>
<br>
Yelping in panic, the pair ran in a rather undignified manner along the edges of the mire back the way they had come, but suddenly the thing called out. . . and thier feet sdheared to the ground!  They would be easy pickings for one such as this!  Just then, Andra noticed a man behind the orc walking slowly towards them and called out to him desperately, &quot;Please! Whoever you are! Help would be very much appreciated!&quot;<br>
she watched him advance slowly through the mire as the orc came still closer, leering the entire way.  &quot;Oh PLEASE! Faster!&quot;<br>
<br>
Finaly the orc was face to face with her, Whysp stayed close as the orc leered at the pair, &quot;thats sure a pretty staff ye got there girlie,&quot; he said, with a greedy light in his eye.<br>
&quot;thanks,&quot; Andra said nervusly, wishing she could back away  . . . . .<br>
<br>
&quot;Leave the young women along!&quot; Called the young man she had called to for help.  He advanced upon the orc menacingly and brandished his weapon.<br>
<br>
Now this is where it just turns sureal guys, so try to follow.  The orc confesses after some bravado, that he is actualy a grimalkin, a less seen fae creature, but none the less, not an orc and not evil.<br>
He had wantd to talk to the ladies, but they had run from him like all the other stupic non-fae folk he had met did, so he had stopped them!<br>
<br>
The roots uncurled from thie pair's feet as they listened to the grimalkin in bemusement.  He certainly had a story!<br>
<br>
Every Year on this night, a Festival was held by the fae to bring spring to the realm.  Lately however, less and less people had come to the festival, and the fae (the one's he called the &quot;stupid ones&quot;) had started to think of it as &quot;just a party&quot; as well and did not come as often either.  So he and his fellow grimalkins had decided to take dire measures to ensure a crowd of appropriate size would show to the fesival to bring spring.  He seemed posative that if this did not take place, spring would not come and they would be trapped in winter forever and ever!<br>
<br>
So finishing his explanation, sprinkled liberaly with bravado and double talk, he then stated that in order to release us, he required that we each give to him an item of great worth to us to ensure we would come to the festival that night to reclaim it from him.<br>
Thinking this a noble cause, if excecuted a bit scandelusly, Andra gve to him one of her four most precios stones.  They were not valuable to her ken, but they were beutiful (labradorite to those who know of it) if one turned it in the light, lights reflected within it's smokey depths as lightning flashes in a storm.<br>
Whysp gave him the charm of Voe Andra had just made her that morning, it was quite precios to her as she desired more than anything to learn how to worship the god.<br>
Thier would-be rescuer gave a hunk of solid mithril!  With naturaly a warning not to lose it or dire things could result.<br>
<br>
They then continued to chat with the grimalkin, discovering that his name was CJ.  He arogently said that Andra and Whysp would be his &quot;dates&quot; at the festival and other such things the ladys simply shook thier heads at in amusement.  Not much later, more travelers came upon them and were similarly &quot;shaken down&quot; for tokens of insurance.   Any who tried to get away without giving a token was humiliated in a typicly fae manner, one was frozen still at the edge of a mire and threatened with a trip spell, the other was snared, tripped, and made to spin in circles, one was frowning too much and was made to dance for a full minute! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   One poor man however, caught CJ's fancy in a truely undesireble manner.  He insisted that if he gave his word he would not break it, so, finaly, CJ said that yes, he would accept the man's word.  &quot;By the power of the fae, I take all of your nouns and leave you with nothing but verbs and adjectives!&quot;<br>
truely, a fae to the bones. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>*sighs*</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
That poor man could utter not one noun for the entire remainder of the day before the fesitval!<br>
finaly, CJ tired of us, and got rid of us with a spell to cause us to sing uncontrolably for a full minute. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>*sigh*</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
From here we went to the privy to freshen up and from there headed for they tourney field to bask in the sun that had begun to peek from the clouds.  On thier way to the tourney field, they passed some town's folk and were given comments on the change in weather, &quot;Yes, Voe is blessing us this day!&quot; said Whysp rapturusly.  And at that moment, they were surounded in a sudden beam of sunlight as the sun won it's way free of a cloud bank.<br>
&quot;You are the one who seeks a priest of Voe to teach you his ways aren't you?&quot; they asked, &quot;because it seems you are truely one in his favor to be given such a sign!&quot;<br>
&quot;Whysp blushed and said that she doubted she had caused it, but that yes, she very much needed a priest of Voe to be teaching her Voe's ways.  So saying, they continued up to the tourney field to find a priest and/or enjoy the blessing of Voe (the wonderful warm sunlight<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
On the tourney field they buy some food for sale and bask in the sun, Andra had been given a charm order and worked contentedly on some logs working on it while Whysp looked about intently for a priest of Voe.<br>

Well, this is where I (Pepermmint) fill in some gaps and, finger cramps permitting <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  elaborate on the story.  Just to keep everyone up to speed, My character in New Stonewatch is Whysp, a clumsy at best belly dancer from the land of Cal' Debblin (Just think of hopeless but cute dancer with a Quickie mart accent and you got it!) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  As Tym/Andra suggested...Friday was a wet and rainy eve....<br>
....................................................................................<br>
<br>
Drenched and unsuccessfully hoping for the rain to be stopping, Andra and Whysp retired on Faeday eve with hopes of a drier morn.  Unbeknownst to Andra, sleeping peacefully above Whysp, something DID enter the cabin that eve.  White and ghastly, it phased through our thin curtain and peered at Whysp, shapened claws glinting in the glow of its own irredescent self, cocking his/her/its head at me.  Needless to say, Whysp pulled up the covers, after slamming back as far as possible, trying to avoid impending heart failure all the while murmuring &quot;I don't belive in ghosts...&quot;  Luckily, this spirit wanted another and not Whysp and the later was left to sleep in uncertain security.<br>
<br>
Thus the eve passed and Satyrday morn arrived, still soggy.  While Andra was busy crafting charms in her bunk, Whysp decided to see if she could find a priest of Voe (god of light, all-seeing power, etc) to teach her in the ways, to follow the path of light.  She came upon the Sanctuary meeting and listened to the many horrors pressing upon the town..one of which being a plague that seems to lower magical resistance, WITHOUT leaving a single other symptom, thus leaving the infected unaware of their disease until too late.  At the end of the meeting, Whysp announced her search for a worshipper of Voe, hopping to see one raise their hand at the meeting.  One could have heard crickets chirping in the ensuing silence.... O.K..... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   So the head of sanctuary assured Whysp that there was a group of such people at the edge of town and he would inform Xavier, the high priest, of Whysp's interest.<br>
<br>
As the day progress and Grimlakins took some valuables from the unaware (see Andra's account of this), the sun began to peek through the edge of darkness, shining hope upon the denizens of town.  It was as the darkness lost its grip on New Stonewatch that Whysp finally made the aquaintance of one Xavier of the Tower of Rateos Order of Voe (whew, try saying that a few times fast!) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   While walking along the trails of New Stonewatch, Xavier impressed upon Whysp the large responsibility for she was hoping to aquire.  After numerous tales of valor by worshippers of Voe, Xavier asked if Whysp was ready for the sorts of commitment and sacrifices that her new path would require of her.  Turning her head to the sky, Whysp closed her eyes and felt for the sun, hidden behind a cloud.  As she solidified her positive response in her mind, the sun broke from behind his veil of clouds and shone down onto Whysp's upturned face.  With a smile of pure delight, she opened her eyes and turned to Xavier. &quot;Yes.  I am being prepared for this journey&quot;  <br>
<br>
So it was that Satyrday eve began its approach and Whysp found herself under the tutelage of one of the most influential members of one of the most influential orders of Voe in existence.  As a token of how greatly Xavier believed Whysp's decision and attitude to exemplify that of his order, he handed her his own symbol of the God, an item passed to him by his father.  Awed, in reverance, Whysp placed the symbol around her neck and praised Voe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Satyrday eve found the two women, Andra and Whysp, preparing for the Fae festival, fervently hoping for the magic of the eve to bring forth a bountiful and WARM spring.  After much playing with various fae, two satyrs (form whom we get the name satyrday!), a fire fire named Flicker (ouch , he burns!), Bo the Brownie &quot;Kiera, what's scrumping?&quot;, Breezy, and various others.  <br>
<br>
The townsfolk did manage to purify the fae circle, it seems that spring should come this year again!  whew! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   After this, Whysp and Andra again headed to the Naked Rose, a gyspy establishment offering fine services of massage.  Two customers into the eve, Andra was whisked away by some fae for a party that she will have to describe as Whysp remained at the Rose, watching and trying not to giggle as her fellow co-worker (a very LOUD co-worker) had the honor of massaging a sweaty, creepy, frankeinstein's helper type undertaker guy... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START  >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=" >D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ugg!  <br>
<br>
After Andra returned, unharmed but far from unaffected from her &quot;party&quot;, the two women headed once more for the Inn and some chicken.  Thus another eve ended.<br>
<br>
Voesday morn brought further sun, a few pinkened faces and the usual Tourney field gathering.  While the townsfolk awaited a massive ambush, as happens every moon, Azriel (peper's husband) was lead into the woods, far from the anxious ears of the townsfolk, and tortured, then eaten by a band of orcs!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Before we knew it..another moon had ended....<br>
..................................................................................<br>
Now I have the pleasure of buying all new clothing for Whysp since worshippers of Voe wear all white!  Just call me the night target!  yikes! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  So now I have three weeks to buy more fabric and sew like a crazed fiend!  (and two more days to hope this sunburn fades some more so that my doctor doesn't give me that &quot;you should know better&quot; look!)  Hopefully some pictures will soon be available to post so that everyone can see what we're talking about!<br>
<br>
Andra/Tymoria, feel free to keep filling in some more blanks as the memories come back!   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A0B0E0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub66.ezboard.com/bthearrowoflightcommons.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pepermmint>Pepermmint</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#000080>(4/15/03 1:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=91.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Tymoria's Semi Real Life Adventure (Peper's additions)</span><hr size=1> Another addition....<br>
<br>
Voesday morn, the cabin is deathly silent as townsfolk sleep the sleep of passed out drunks.  Of course, this is when Whysp, warm and cozy in her bunk, realizes that she HAS to pee. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   She figures she would easy out of bed, quietly grab her towel and other toiletries, sneak on some shoes and cautiously cross the cabin to the back door, which she would silently shut and then bolt like a crazed pony to the Potty!<br>
<br>
However, as Whysp was formulating this involved plan of stealth, another member of our cabin decided, &quot;hmm its 8am on voesday, everyone in here is sleeping so peacefully, I think I need to make as much noise as Elvenly possible!&quot;  Thus followed a slamming of booted feet across the cabin.  SLAM the door cracks open and the bright eye of Voe burns into the cabin.  She doesn't shut the door, oh no the torture is not yet finished.  Instead, she had aparently decided that there wasn't yet ENOUGH light beaming into the interior and proceeds to spend 10 minutes slamming around the window outside, trying to figure out how in the name of Avagon to open the blasted thing.  At full volume, she asks numerous folk how to open it and finally manages to SLAM that open too.  STOMP STOMP STOMP she reenters the cabin.  <br>
<br>
Oh, it doesn't stop there.  She then pulls out this monster of a trunk and latches and unlatches it a few thousand times until finally, satisfied that we are all ready to kill her, throws open the cover till it SMASHES against the cabin wall.  As the pissed off moans from those who had minutes before been peacefully snoring away begin to fill the cabin, she takes it as a further sign to make MORE noise and beings rustling, talking at full volume and clomping around.<br>
<br>
In short, the planned stealth of Whysp's morning dash to the privy turned into a death glare at Mrs. Inconsiderate.<br>

<br>
now! to continue where I left off. . . . <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ahh, I believe we were up to the end of the Fae Festival if I recal correctly, well!<br>
Andra bade Whysp go on ahead to go earn some cash while she stayed behind to see if the festival party would revive at all.  Her thinking was that she couldnt hang on Whysp's cloak tails forever, so now was as good a time as any to seperate, surounded by Fae who while unpredictable and boistrous, were certainly not disliking her!<br>
<br>
And so, as Andra stood at the fire warming her toes, the party goers slowly trickled away untill all that remained were CJ, Anra, a single Satyr, and a rather inconsequencial man whome Andra very vaguely remembers and never can keep the name of in her head.  After much convincing, the three convince Andra to partake of a sip from the Satyr's wine skin, assuring her they would aid her in returning home when all was over since she would be tipsy on top of not knowing her way.  Let us say right here, that this one innocent sip, taken of peer presure and a desire to fit in with the fae, was Andra's first baby step onto the road to Undathos' deepest hell.<br>
<br>
Andra sipped cautiosly of the skin, and was nearly floored by it's kick!  All unknowing of the nature of what she had sipped, she giggled and continued to hang about the fire, staggering in place often.  For the satyr's wine is a spirit that packs a punch akin to oh. . . . about 200 proof hard liquor!  The Satyr then played a song that made Andra feel nigh unto invincible and quite good, so after a very long time of frolicing about the fire drunkenly, she was lead home by the only other non-fae person left at the fire.  But again, Andra's road turned south!<br>
<br>
She and her companion were met by the satyr's other friend satyr, and this one was the truely randy one /wince.  After his advances were rebuffed once again by the drunken Andra, he said loudly, &quot;Hey!  Your not being very nice to me!  By the Power of the Fae, I cause you to become my bestest friend!&quot;<br>
<br>
andra grasped him about his furry waist, &quot;Buddy! ! !&quot;<br>
The satyr proceded to cause her to gyrate her hips in some sort of dance that she blushes to think about and after great length tired of his game and released her to bewildering reality once more.  Reeling from shock, she allowed her companion to lead her to the Rose to find Whysp, but alas! Whysp was working!  Ahh well she thought, I shall simply wait here for her to finish up!<br>
<br>
While waiting for Whysp, Andra was startled to see Chilly the ice fae skip up to the Rose and loudly demand that his &quot;wife&quot; come out so they could go to the party!  Well, like most wives, she took some time to ready herself, and Chilly took great exception to this and complained loudly of his slow wife, well, Andra, may the 13 gods preserve her, took her drink loosened tongue and ran with it, &quot; Hey!  It is a wife's right to take her time to get ready for her husband!&quot;<br>
Chilly turned a playful yet painfully icy glare upon the hapless Andra, &quot;Time is it?  You think you know of time?  Well!  You just come with me and I will teach you of time!  To Time Out you go!&quot;   and with that he dragged her off with his wife to the party, which apparently was being help at the home of a leprachaun. . . . who didnt know he was having a party as he was not at home. . . . . <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Well no sooner did they arive than Chilly plunked her in a chair and placed a spell of entrapment upon it for Andra's Time out.  Eventualyy some food and beer arrived and another party goer took pity on Andra, convincing Chilly to release her to eat.  Gratefully Andra headed for the food, foregoing the beer in favor of her already spinning head.  Hardly had she taken a bit when in stormed the leprachaun who's house they were partying in!<br>
<br>
&quot; WHATS GOING ON HERE ! ! !?! !?!?! !?! ?! !&quot; he bellowed.<br>
Now, let us remember this is a fae party, there are at least 4 fae present that could be easily noted, so what was thier response?<br>

<br>
well, as soon as they yelled out thier surprize, off they went into a rousing rendition of &quot;For he's a jolly good fellow&quot; whilest the frantic leprachaun searched all his hidey holes for his gold.<br>
&quot;WHERE'S MY GOLD?!!!!&quot; he bellowed!  all present froze.<br>
<br>
dear gods, somebody had taken his gold . . . . . . .<br>
<br>
at this point it took Andra's befuddled mind a moment too many to register that everyone was fleeing for thier lives (including the fae who could squish her at any moment) and that her running at this point would be a smashing idea, so, staggering, she sprinted for the exit and blasted through the gate out of the fae realm and back into town.  She was the last frantic form in a line of fleeing party goers racing franticly for the inn to safety.  Halfway there, the angered fae let rip a tremendus earthquake to slow his quary and andra hit the ground hard mid stride, scrambling, all the runners got back up and ran still further!  One poor fellow fell by the bridge, but urged the concerned onlookers to &quot;just RUN ! ! ! he's right behind you! ! !&quot; So asking no more questions, they all ran with nary a look behind them.<br>
<br>
As they reached the inn, they stopped running, thinking they were safe at last, but they werent inside yet!  Andra franticly called to them to hurry up! he was still coming!  Startled, they rushed through the final door and andra squeezed through as it was closing, with the angry fae meerly three feet behind her!<br>
<br>
<br>
Quikly, she sat down in the back of the common room and told those at the table breathlessly, &quot; I was here all night!&quot;<br>
<br>
Jericho, fae friend, opened the door for the enraged leprechaun and Andra's blood ran cold, she saw them talking, and pale, Jericho backed away from the fae and let him deliver his dread promise.<br>
&quot;I know every one of ye who were in my cave!  If my gold ain't back in my cave by tonight, you will ALL pay it to me in pain until such time as it IS returned!&quot;<br>
<br>
and with that, he stormed out of the inn in search of those who had not gotten to the inn.<br>
<br>
Shaking, Andra ordered a dark ale. <p><table width="500" height="150" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

(but close!)<br>
Eventualy, Andra allowed some travelers to convince her to acompany they to the tea Realm and the Rose, where she could rejoin Whysp again.  As they arrived, Whysp rushed over to Andra, &quot;There you are being!&quot; she cried, &quot;We were being told that you were being flattened by a leprachaun!&quot;<br>
Andra filled her in on all the gory (or nearly so) details as Azriel laughed silently over Andra's plight.  In retrospect, Andra supposed it had been quite amusing. . . . . <br>
<br>
from here I believe Whysp completed the story quite well enough, for now, my hands cramp and I shudder to remember those few dread hours in which Andra Cassidy almost became Lucky Charms. . . . . . <p><table width="500" height="150" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
