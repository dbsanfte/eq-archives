As told by Garomtel<br>
<br>
How it all began eh?  Wow, that’s quite a long story.  I’m happy to put it all down.  But I’ll admit something to you… there’s one particular motivation I have for writing this.  <br>
<br>
Sytox has been running around signing his messages with the tag, “An Arrow of Light Founder.”  Well, it probably isn’t a big surprise to most of you that this is A TOTAL COMPLETE LIE!  Sytox had NOTHING to do with the origin of our guild.  He wasn’t even born yet!  And so, to clear the record, I’m going to tell the tale, at least from how it happened to my recollection.  It’s my truth… someone else will have another.  For me, it all began in…<br>
<br>
THE CITY OF QEYNOS<br>
<br>
As now I’ve seen the world completely, I am relieved to know I couldn’t have chosen a better place to grow up than Surefall Glade.  The peacefulness of the forest, the cascading waterfalls… the place is a living temple to the Goddess Tunare herself.  Like all Rangers in training, my youth involved study and prayer and a yearning for adventure.<br>
<br>
Frequent trips to Qeynos were an adventure unto themselves.  This was an exciting time in Norrath!  The continent of Kunark had just been discovered.  But Qeynos was a city cut off from the rest of the world.  Not at all like today, there was no planar travel, no spire to the moon, and the Druids did not yet have the knowledge to make the Glade a port destination.  With the exception of the boat to Erudin, which I found to be humdrum, there was no way for a young boy to see the rest of the world.  No way, but through… the expansive and dangerous plains of the Western Karanas.  A wild frontier filled with giants, and thugs and a werewolf that could tear you to shreds before you even saw it coming!  Some day I vowed to escape and see the world… and I knew that West Karana was my obstacle. <br>
<br>
[Guild Names Discussed in Nov. 2000:  Silver Mist, Dragon Soul, Crystal Spirit...]<br>
<br>
<br>
THE RANGER NAMED MERANI<br>
<br>
It was through my neighbors and other Rangers that I came to know a half elf Ranger by the name of Merani.  For those of you who didn’t know, Merani is a name forever etched in Arrow history.  She was the mother to this guild and, in general, the magnet that brought us all together in the early days.  Oh, but I’m skipping ahead… <br>
<br>
I knew this lady very well, but we’d never even met!  She and I corresponded quite a bit and she’d become something of a mentor to me.  She’d been born and raised in Qeynos herself, but had moved on to bigger adventures, hunting and looting in exotic locations I could only DREAM of.  She now resided in the bustling city of  Freeport.  <br>
<br>
Good God that was far away!<br>
<br>
I had been doing a little work for the bards in the city and they asked me to take this pack to Highpass for them.  I wrote to Merani about it.  “Where is Highpass?  Is that beyond the Karanas?”  She didn’t even answer the question.<br>
<br>
“Don’t do it Gar!”<br>
<br>
If you’re a young Ranger stuck in Qeynos, the only game in town is a place called Blackburrow.  Hunting gnolls remains the single greatest pastime in that area to this day.  For the moment, I was content to hunt there.  As it was, so much of the place was unknown to me.   The world was a big place… I could start with Blackburrow I suppose.<br>
<br>
One day… while making my way to Blackburrow, I came upon several young adventurers hovering over something on the ground.  I stopped to see that it was a dead body.  Not just ANY dead body… it was a lizard man.  <br>
        “I’ve never seen that before,” I said.  From the looks of things, I don’t think I was the only one.<br>
“Holly Windstalker killed him,” someone replied.  <br>
<br>
Even though the thing was dead, it was my first encounter with an Iksar, a creature born far, far beyond this continent.  Merani didn’t want me to go to the world… but it looked like it was on its way to me. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub66.ezboard.com/bthearrowoflightcommons.showUserPublicProfile?gid=garomtel>Garomtel</A> at: 1/17/03 2:10:26 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm23.showPrevMessage?topicID=5.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <br><br><a self href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic><img src=http://www.eq-arrow-of-light.com/aol/images/boardbuttons/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm23.emailToFriend?topicID=5.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm23.threadControl?topicID=5.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm23.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=5.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm23.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=5.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub66.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thearrowoflightcommonsfrm1">General<option value="thearrowoflightcommonsfrm4">/OOC Chat<option value="thearrowoflightcommonsfrm2">Raids and Events<option value="thearrowoflightcommonsfrm23">The Fireplace<option value="thearrowoflightcommonsfrm7">So You Want to Be an Arrow?<option value="thearrowoflightcommonsfrm17">Game Play Q & A<option value="thearrowoflightcommonsfrm13">Testing one...two...three...<option value="thearrowoflightcommonsfrm19">Rants, Whines and Whimpers</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000080>- </font><a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/bthearrowoflightcommons>The Arrow of Light Commons</a><font color=#000080> - </font><a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm23>The Fireplace</a> <font color=#000080> - </font><a href="www.eq-arrow-of-light.com">Home</a><font color=#000080> - </font><br><br>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3m<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
