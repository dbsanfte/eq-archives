He can't quite place his finger on it but he feels it ... an addition to the common room mayhap?<br>
<br>
*squints his eyes to adjust them to the darkness of the room <br>
<br>
*peers into the corner to see Lithographs and parchments hanging on the wall next to the help wanted cork board<br>
<br>
*giggle when he see's Lord Shamer in his most regal post for the paint (quite hard for a Barbarian I must add to get a painting too much sitting in one place they say)<br>
<br>
*recognizes a few other friends and fellow Knights who have taken the time to get there picture painted <br>
<br>
along with this wall is a few parchments one of which he recognizes as his own writing. Ah Lord Shamer ( with no doubt the help of Sir Senaan and Milord Xymor ) has added a history board and has his parchment hanging. <br>
<br>
Well I guess it is time to add another chapter to my tales <br>
<br>
Volume II  Days of the Dragon a lost time for Senben Strongfaith Cleric of Tunare<br>
<br>
  On the season of my 5th heal after much personal debating and a little pressure from that insistent bard Devarian I decided to go out into Norrath and help stake my claim and leave my mark not knowing just how much I would miss the comradery and structure of The Knights.  I packed my gear and said my good-bye's and walked out of the gate to Knights Keep for what seemed to be my last time turned and did a final salute to the guidon and headed for Kelethin where the friends I had met with Devarien were gathering to build my new guild house.<br>
That is the day the The Platinum Dragons of Norrath were born, with a bard in charge you are correct in assuming the leadership style was a total shock to the system, there was much more drinking a a little more seedy characters roaming around in this guild hall than in Knights Keep but it had its own excitement it was much like being blindfolded and made to walk a plank you knew there was danger ahead but when was a mystery. now imagine if you will standing in the middle of that plank and forgetting you were wearing the blindfold and beginning to dance ah the fun I had exploring the lands of Kunark home of the Iksar the forts of the  Hill Giants and the underhanded tactics of the evil Teir'Dal at the Dark Elf outpost in the lands of Overthere. I spent many seasons learning of these places and spreading the word of Tunare to the uneducated goblins and conniving Sarnak sometimes having to literally beat it into their heads with my mace but giving the the teaching of Tunare none the less *chuckle*.<br>
throughout all of that time I felt something was missing I had a family in the Dragons but it still wasn't the family I was destined to belong to a certain stone Keep kept calling for my return unknown to me. After dancing for what seemed to be a life time I happened across an old friend from my younger days by the name of Valvarent who informed me that Lord Dami had left our fair lands and he had replaced him as the guild leader in the Knights Keep ... at first I was quite taken aback but I thought that he was a good choice in replacement of Lord Dami and he began talking to me of may my return to where my heart had been calling for so long this is when my first foot found the edges of the plank and I realized that if I didn't do something I was gonna fall into the unknown. I talked to Devarien and we agreed threat the foundation for the Dragons was laid but we both belonged other places. I gathered my bags in a hurry and rushed back to Knights Keep to find the guidon still flying in its proper place and rushed in to see Lord Valvarent awaiting my return as if he knew it all along ... with a smile and a quick greeting he led me to my new quarters a more spacious room than what I had remembered me having before. with what must have been the funniest face Lord Valvarent had ever seen he handed me a Charm of some sort on a necklace and said .. &quot;Welcome home Senben and welcome to the leadership of Knights of Freedom&quot; with that he excused himself to preform other duties that a guild leader must and left me to unpack and ponder how to handle this new found reasonability. <br>
<br>
Thus ends the Senben Strongfaith Chronicles Vol. II (Days of the Dragon)<br>
<br>
*calls the errand boy <br>
<br>
*hands him the rolled parchment and a few gold pieces<br>
<br>
Make sure this gets to the correct people ok Lad.<br>
<br>
Straps back on his Armor, picks up his travel pouch, and heads for the front Gate. With a Salute to the Guidon and a smile he heads for places unknown to have adventures yet unwritten about.<br>
