We all know this. We all have to put up with it. We have all heard or been involved in people trying to get flags when not a part of raid. What is the solution, if any? <br>
<br>
No clue. Lets face it, it's a game. Unless you are part of a hardcore guild, you will probably never see the elemental planes unless VI changes things. Yeah, all of you are holding your breath for that to happen right? <br>
<br>
Another reason for this post, to vent. OMG you think. Oh well, some time has passed and ya know, why does one guild hate another guild? Why do players hate other players? Some players have done naughty things to others, so have guilds, but where do we draw the line? When does it stop?<br>
<br>
Recently a guild killed Behemoth. Sure, you know who you are, but I'm not gonna name names cause it's not important really. NE offered to help, lets face it, we wanted to help to kill the mob plus get flagged. No deep dark secret there. Our offer was rejected. We waited. Mob dead, we left. Well, ok, maybe a few attempted to hail the gnome, but humans will be humans.<br>
<br>
Within hours rants and flames appeared on the ol' karana flame boards. No biggie really. Ever played that game where you line a bunch of people up and start at one end with a sentence or two and see what it ends up being at the end? Yeah.. people view everything, read everything from their own perspective and it's influenced by their own beliefs. <br>
<br>
Anyhows, back to my rant. Yesterday. 2 guilds going for same mob. Suddenly I start getting tells asking if player x, y, and z can come help. I'm really not a mean person, heck, in real life I'm a nurse, ya know, one of those angels of mercy! But I wasn't really running this raid, I was just kinda going along and making sure my guys knew what was going on and what to do. I had a bizillion tells and couldn't even keep up with trying to get my own guild members tells. If I missed yours, I wasn't ignoring you. Well, not intentionally <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Mob dead. Suddenly every Tom, Dick, Harriet from every guild across Karana appeared in zone. Total chaos. Darn zone was lagged out the Behemoth's rather dead metal posterior and the poor gnome was being bombarded with hails. <br>
<br>
Never have I seen such an onslaught of people for a flag. People training other people, dead people, people hailing, tells that lagged me to almost a complete stop. Yeah, there for a bit I was rather.. pissed. I admit it, I cheered when I heard a train killed the gnome.<br>
<br>
Honestly, and I can only speak for myself, it's nice to have the flag to get into tactics, but it didn't mean much. Ya know that feeling when your guild alone killed that big mob and you were like, &quot;wow!&quot; I didn't feel that. In a way it's a let down. Sure, a lot of my guild is there, but a lot isn't. I want to kill it again with just my peeps. <br>
<br>
The game isn't about who is first to me. It isn't about who has what gear, who is better or this or that. I want to know that my guild killed said mob alone. I want that lil bit of &quot;hell yes!&quot; feeling. <br>
<br>
At first I was a lil pissed about the flag thing. Now, I'm not. It will be interesting to see if any of these other guilds will let my guild members who missed the flag hail their mob. If they don't, that's ok by me. I can't wait for the opportunity to kill this big mess of tin cans alone, just my guild. That's all I want. Just the satisfaction of being left alone, letting us do our own thing. Heck, I'm willing to bet a few of you other guilds might feel the same, maybe not though. <br>
<br>
A lot has been posted, whispered, and flamed about Night Eternal. We aren't so bad really. <br>
<br>
Anyhows, grats to all those that got flags. The system sucks. Once a majority of the guild is flagged, it's a shame that others can't get the flag or at least get into the zone on a raid situation. Total stupidity really. Time sinks, gotta love em. <br>
<br>
If this turns into a flame fest of one guild against another, I will delete or lock this thread, but honestly, it would be nice to maybe hear other rants, erm I mean opinions on this. <br>

The only good (and worthwhile) exp for 61+ players can be found in PoP zones.  The 4 zones that are open to everyone are crowded.  The 2 easiest to open up -- Valor and Storms -- are even more crowded, and have few actual camp spots worth hunting.<br>
<br>
This system is good and bad.  For some guilds, usually the higher end guilds, this system allows the chance to have a zone virtually all to their own, for both exp and raid kills.  However, for the other 80% of players on a server, this system means they will never see half the zones.  How many casual players will do the High Priest cycle in Crypt of Decay?  How many will see Temple of Marr?  How many will explore Solusek's Tower?  How many of these casual players will ever see the Elemental planes?<br>
<br>
I can understand what happened yesterday in PoI.  The frustration of being limited to 4 (or 6) zones because you dont have the time to put into the game (or just dont play as hard as some others) must be reaching the limits.  Sure, all expansions have those zones that some may never see.  For Kunark it was Veeshan's Peak.  For Velious, it was Sleeper's Tomb.  For Luclin, it was Vex Thal.  But for PoP, its not just 1 or 2 zones.  Its HoH-B, Sol Ro Tower, 4 Elemental Planes, Plane of Time.  Thats 7 zones and lots of gear and mobs that most players will never see!<br>
<br>
Imagine the frustration of knowing this.  Now, imagine what its like to know that if you race over to PoI and flag this NPC, you'll get access to Plane of Tactics, a new hunting ground, a new zone  just to see!  Even if thats as far as these players will get, its something new and exciting!!  Of course, utter pandemonium ensued at the factory in PoI, but thats human nature --- you can't blame em for that.<br>
<br>
Was it a mistake for the raid leader to invite everyone and their dog to hail the flag NPC?  Yes, I think it was.  It cheapens the kill, and as everyone saw, resulted in complete chaos.  This reminds me of something on the Drinal server:  The &quot;Flag Rebellion&quot; ,  a loose alliance of a number of guilds that get together and zerg boss mobs for flagging purposes.  I'm talking about hundreds of players getting flags just for the purpose of getting around SOE's implemented system.  And while the resident &quot;uber&quot; guild, Cats In Hats, doesn't mind so much (they even send their own players that have missed out on flags) it seems to be getting mixed results on the server population.  Some thing its a good thing, because it allows so many to see new zones.  However, those that have killed the boss mobs on their own feel this &quot;rebellion&quot; cheapens their own respective kills and gives players something for free, whereas they themselves worked hard for it.<br>
<br>
I dont want to be accused of libel with respect to the Empire Alliance here on Karana, but in my mind, this is what Empire does.  I dont see how Loot can be handled in any efficient way with 100+ members present at a boss kill that drops 3 items.  So, in my mind, Empire alliance members arent in it for the loot; rather they're in to see things dead and move on to the next thing.  Progression at the expense of upgrades.  I could be wrong, and if this offends any Empire alliance members, then please accept my apologies in advance.<br>
<br>
Anyway, you're right the PoP flag system sucks.  Really sucks.  If SOE doesnt fix it, or try to make it better for the players, then the players are going to go around it whenever possible.  This will most likely result in more incidents like yesterday's stampedes in PoI, but what can you do?  Players being left out of zones isnt a new thing, but 1-2 zones per expansion was a tolerable limit.  7+ zones in an expansion is ridiculous. <p><align=center><font face="Tahoma"><a

Rumours are of a system whereby if the majority of a raid is flagged for a zone, then individuals may join in that zone, even if not flagged. I dont think this will flag those people to be able to go without a raid but it sounds like a workable system to allow the 'odd few' unflagged to join instead of logging off.<br>
<br>
For more permanent access to all the planes for anyone...well, maybe in the future of eq (hehe)....there might be a one time server event (think sleeper), that does this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

Doing the quest to enter PoTa makes the zone available to you and you may tag along to kill VZ and TZ, however you do not gain the partial flags from these fights to move on toward Elemental planes unless you get the real flagg to PoTa from Behemot....<br>
<br>
As Dano said i really hope the system that allow a small percentage of a raid to &quot;tag along&quot; if the majority is flagged goes live... tho there are some serious abuse possebilities with that wich i recon Verant have to solve before they let it go live...<br>
<br>
(Oh and for a little response to the statement about Empire and loot.... that would perhaps be true if Empire killed 1 boss mob now and then, but with Empire raiding pretty much everyday and dropping maybe 3, 4 or 5 mobs in one night each dropping top end game loot I feel pretty sure that upgrades will be possible for me in the future there, even tho i just joined the alliance, tho i must admit your correct.... It is probably more the drive to see the high end of the game, to reach Elmental planes and to fight the top mobs more than loot that is the goal for many.... myself included <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub66.ezboard.com/bnighteternal.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thurlin>Thurlin</A> at: 2/20/03 10:23:08 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub66.ezboard.com/fnighteternalfrm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=24.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub66.ezboard.com/fnighteternalfrm12.showNextMessage?topicID=24.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fnighteternalfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fnighteternalfrm12.emailToFriend?topicID=24.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fnighteternalfrm12.threadControl?topicID=24.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fnighteternalfrm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=24.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fnighteternalfrm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=24.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub66.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="nighteternalfrm12">Public Discussion<option value="nighteternalfrm9">Trading Board<option value="nighteternalfrm10">Membership<option value="nighteternalfrm8">Access<option value="nighteternalfrm7">Member Discussion<option value="nighteternalfrm29">Raid Followups<option value="nighteternalfrm13">Applicant Review<option value="nighteternalfrm14">Library<option value="nighteternalfrm18">Tactics<option value="nighteternalfrm19">Keys and Flags<option value="nighteternalfrm20">Test<option value="nighteternalfrm21">Attendance<option value="nighteternalfrm22">UI's etc.<option value="nighteternalfrm27">Tradeskill Heaven<option value="nighteternalfrm28">Eep!
