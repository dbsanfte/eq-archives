Of course, none of them dropped any acrylia, which makes me think I need to go into the mines to actually get some (sigh).  However, I was a bit intrigued by the Grimlings, so I went to talk to the Vah Shir about their neighbors.  Apparently, the two races are on bad terms with each other, and the Vah Shir wanted me to go help them eliminate the threat to their encampment.  Of course, being totally burn out from slaughtering Grimlings looking for ore, this sounded like a fair trade -- I could slaughter grimlings for the Vah Shir! (anything that makes the mindless slaughter more interesting...)<br>
  So I clear the first two camps, and the &quot;boss mobs&quot; at each of the camp drop some fairly interesting stuff.  Good for mid-level characters, and unfortunately no drop.  The third camp, well this one musta took me at least 45 minutes to clear, and I ran through 4 or 5 pets.  The boss mob dropped a nice SK sword, not fast or really high damage, but it has Flowing Thought 1 on it -- an really nice plus for those SKs who need mana regen in their downtime.  Of course the sword is no drop, but I looted it nonetheless to show others that I did not make this up!<br>
<br>
  I was thinking that maybe we could get a few groups together and go clear these Grimling camps for the Vah Shir.  THere are seven or eight quests to clear the camps and I got through 3 of them, so this could be fun for while.  Captain Necin asked for three solid groups to take out the camps, but we could probably clear them all with just 2 groups as long as we get a couple more high-levels to attend.  My take on this, I would say level 35+ would be good.  Mobs are mostly dark blue to Stumbles who is level 40. but they might get tougher as you get to the final camps.<br>
<br>
  There is a trick with these camps though -- about half the mobs will show up when you first get there, but you can only attack about half of them -- the others you can't target until you clear the first set of targetable ones.  Once you clear the first and second sets, usually a third set will spawn as soon as the last one dies.  The third set contains the boss-mob.<br>
<br>
  Anyhow, if anyone is up for this, maybe we can plan for next weekend (Sun 10/19) for this, and make it an AGN night.  Loot would be done based on 1) who can/would use an item (most are no drop), and 2) hmm, see rule #1 -- Need Before Greed.  There really wasn't that much cash loot to speak of, but we could split that too at the end, or just donate it to the guild bank.<br>
<br>
Anyone up for it?<br>

You see I have this Owlbear bone club in the bank. It's a pretty nice weapon with several plus 5 stats, some HP's, and it's 18/30 when used against grimlings. I have kept this no drop for longer than I can remember and if I don't take advantage of this opportunity I would have to face the fact that I have been wrong my whole life when saying &quot;If I hang on to this junk long enough there will come a time when I am glad I did.&quot; I have several character's banks filled with said junk so you can see how important proving this credo is to me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
When: Sun 10/19, 3pm PST, 6pm EST<br>
Who:  Anyone 35+, Arrow Group Night<br>
What:  Grimling Quest Event (non-LDoN)<br>
<br>
Where:  Meet in Nexus, POK, or near a druid ring, I'll have Stumbles pick you up and deposit you in the Grimling Forest if there are no other porters.  There is a bank that you can use in Grimling too.<br>
<br>
Duration:  I think maybe 3 hours, but this is just a guess.<br>
<br>
Why: To give Bushmill a chance to prove himself right and that his never used weapons that have damage bonuses against Grimlings weren't a waste of time to keep in the bank.  Oh, and we can pick up some mid-level gear that you normally don't see in the bazaar.  And to group with some Arrows.<br>
<br>
We will group up based on level to try to make it so that we can maximize the xp for people that can get it and still provide a relatively safe group for hunting.  Based on how these quests work, each group may have  adifferent objective at each camp -- some will be the first wave and take out a certain type of mob, another group will be the second wave or be assigned to take out a different type of mob.  We'll have to feel it as we go since I haven't ever done or seen the Grimling Quests done.<br>

Many many thanks -- that is the kind of turnout we need to see more often.  Two full groups.<br>
<br>
  Just to recap the events, we got everyone over to Grimling Forest and took the nexessary time required to buff everyone up.  We had two groups -- one high level group and one mid-level group.  The first 2 camps were already clear so we started on the 3rd camp.  We followed Captain Necin right over to it, went over the strategy to start the event and... Captain Necin got tired of us and walked away.  So Xenophon quickly ran and got him to come back to us (run kitty, run fast, go go go!) and war was soon upon the Grimlings.  We cleared teh camp with relatively little problem, the hardest part was trying to save enough mobs for both groups to get xp from.  Anyhow, the boss mob didnt drop anything worthwhile and we headed back to the Vah Shir compound.<br>
<br>
  Our next stop was camp 5, we made a valiant attempt at saving the traitor Gelg, but ... we uhm, let her get dotted and then finished her off ourselves.  Got a good laugh outta that one.  Anyhow, we restarted this quest, this time with the right concept of how to save Gelg.  We again finished off the camp in relatively short order, and the boss mob droped a REALLY nice staff for INT-based casters with Flowing Thought I on it, and INT +10.  Coddington won the roll (Grats Codd!) and proudly equiped it for us.  We headed back to the Vah Shir camp and asked for the next quest.<br>
<br>
  This time, the General indicated that we still needed to do camp 4.  What!?  Ok, so we have Captain Necin show us to camp 4, and we clober the grimling like so many seals on the beach.. wait, bad analogy but you get the picture -- it was bloody for the grimlings and not for us; we clobbered them good, but they didn't give us a boss mob <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  So back to the Vah Shir camp again.<br>
<br>
  This time, the General himself led us to the far north camp.  From here, we had two groups and we started clearing the tents.  As we wrested control of each tent away form the Grimlings, we had to leave one person inside each tent so more mobs wouldnt spawn.  The groups slowly worked their way through the camp, losing one person to each tent.  Soon we had all the tents occupied and one group out doing the killing.  After 3 waves of mobs spawning in the camp, the final boss mob spawned.  Shortly thereafter, he was lying stone cold dead like the rest of his minions.  Darilynn won an AC 30 set of leggings (Grats Dar!) and Razau walked off with the uber Medallion of the Vah Shir Hero, +5 to all stats with some heft hit point and mana plusses to.  Grats Razau!<br>
<br>
With the fall of the Grimlings, the Vah Shir recaptured the forest and are grateful for the help the Arrows of Light provided.  They couldna done it without us (/em wink).<br>
<br>
Again, thank you all fo rcoming, we had a great time.<br>
