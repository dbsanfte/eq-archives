The embers were still hot and pushing the coals around a bit started the flames to arise from the pit. He looked around in his food pack and found some of the bear meet he had gathered the day before.  He would need the meat for the trip he was planning to Kael Drakkal. True the great giant city was on Velious, which was a trek from the Desert of Ro. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thornnar looked up into the sky, and watched as the darkness faded to the clear blue sky he had grown to love. Taking in a deep cleaning breath he could smell the salty sea air from the ocean of tears.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The sun was peeking over the rocky formations on the east side of the valley. Thornnar would walk to the Oasis of Marr this morning and attempt to find some poor druid to take him the rest of the way. In five days time he was to meet up with some of his trusted guild mates for a raid deep into Keal. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thornnar began to gather his things and pack up his bedroll, when he heard a very disturbing noise coming from the east of him. It was as if someone was yelling for help, only there were no words only horrible sounds in the form of screams. The sound grew stronger and Thornnar could see an iksar approaching his camp.  There was a large sand giant chasing him. As thornnar looked on he could see that the young lizard was doing everything possible to get away from the large sun worshiper. In folklore it has always been said that sand giants will not try to hard to chase you down. There is always someone slower that will make as good a meal as you. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The clopping of the large feet got louder, as the lizard was running right at Thornnar. Thinking there was really no way he could get away from the giant with all his things still not packed, Thornnar drew his sword and shield. Knowing in his mind he was more then capable to defeat the giant if need be there was always the off chance they may be other giants not far away to come and help his brethren in battle. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You see giants travel alone but in times of need they will come and assist their fellow countrymen. Though knowing that if the iksar runs past him, the giant will give up chasing the scaly meal and attempt to kill him instead. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Always the tactition, Thornnar started toward the giant to close the distance in the hopes that this would catch the giant by surprise. The lizard was with in speaking distance now and thornnar began with “nice day to be out for a walk”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yeah, your help I can use, or move aside I am trying to make it to the swamp” He snarled gasping for breath. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Now as a paladin Thornnar could not allow in good faith this long tailed runner to parish at the hand of sand giant, so starting with a spell, which is always a great attention getter, thornnar jumped into the mix. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thornnar chanted the words “Dar Teise, Fanger Wartel, Sooo Kar” and raising his hands the giant was stopped dead in his tracks. For a brief moment Thornnar wondered if this was the right thing to do but sizing up the nasty in his mind he though he would prevail in this test of strength. The moment passing in a flash he was now toe to toe with the giant. Brushing of the large hand of the giant as it came down to squash thornnar like a grape. Thronnar began to carve him self a victory. He was much quicker than the large giant and was able to dance around him like a willowhisp. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Making precision sword strikes, and bashing the giant with his shield thornnar drew the battle out like an artist with a quill. Step in strike fast, step back and dodge the attack of the angry giant who was now yelling with his deep voice with every attempt to hit thornnar. The giant sensing defeat was upon him began to withdraw from the contest, but thornnar being a seasoned fighter gave chase and hacking wildly with exuberance, defeated the tall foe.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The giant gave a mighty yalp as he fell hard to the sandy dunes of the desert floor. And as always Thornnar looked to the other party present there on the arid hill. Seeing that he needed some care Thornnar started to chant and raising his hands:<br>
“Marr give me strength, oh god of my blessed soul,<br>
  Heal thee, this scaly one, and offer health with a soft glow”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A blue light surrounded the iksar and a wave of tranquility rushed over him as the light consumed him. Then closing his eyes thornnar mended his own wounds. The next order of business was of course the loot on the giant.<br>
   “34 platinum, not a bad take for the part of the desert” thornnar stated nodding head his head agreeably. Thornnar looked at the scaly figure before him, “what say you, young traveler?”<br>
   “Thank you kind one, I am Feigntail Shadowscail, son of Brother Khurnen Shadowscail”. Feigntail took a few steps toward thornnar. “ Well met” he stated happily.<br>
    “Aye well met, I am Baron Thornnar Silverwood the pure hearted of The Knights of Freedom” He stated with bravado in his voice. “ Why are you in these lands?” <br>
     “I am making my way to the Oasis of Marr, I have heard the stories of the orc highway and the crocodiles there” feigntail replied.<br>
      “Ah, well be ever vigilant, sand giants do travel these lands” Thornnar stated as he began to pack his belongings  “hungry?”<br>
      “I am, I have not been able to forage any food in the desert” feigntail said as he rubbed his stomach with a slight grimace on his face.<br>
       “Ah, Then sit at my camp and rest your soul scaly one, I can offer you only a small wooden stool, and some bear meat” Thronnar bit into the now brazed meat.<br>
        “You are most kind Human” he stated, “ I have not had the fortune of meeting many helpful souls on my journey to your land Thornnar”<br>
        “Well fear not, you may rest here till I am ready to travel, unless you wish to stay with me, I would be happy to accompany you to Marr”<br>
         “ Most happy that would make me Baron Thornnar”<br>
And with that the two sat and talked while they ate, and thornnar cooked the meat for the coming trip.<br>
