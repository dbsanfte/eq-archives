<br>
The whispers of Autumn<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As I opened the black oaken doors of the Ebon Tower, a burst of wind flung a smattering of leaves into my face. I almost laughed at the cold shock of it all. Which was a double surprise, for I have not been able to laugh in a long time. Yes, a walk in the woods would do me good today. No more stale laboratory air, no more dusty tomes, no more bones or skulls and all that nonsense today. Today I would enjoy the fresh air, the songs of the sparrows and the whispers of Autumn, of course if my old necromantic instructors and masters saw me today they would think I was daft and enspelled by foul Koada'dal magic. Though it was true that these are stranger times, I am who I am. With a small shrug, I just left it at that and walked down the browning grassy hills. <br>
<br>
As I walked along I took some amusement watching the small little wind devils made up of swirling leaves dance past my path and play among the balding trees, giving off a strange but lighter feel to the day even though the sun was finishing the third quarter of his own daily course. Still it was getting on in the season and the air was certainly more brisk then weeks before, with due prudence from age I pulled my grey cloak a little more tighter around me and pushed back a rogue lock of my white hair back into my hood. <br>
<br>
Even though I currently walk on the sides of the angels, my heritage betrayed me as one of the Teir`Dal or “Dark Elves” in common tongue. It would not do well for my mood today for some fool of a ranger or some wayward over-zealous paladin to try to take my head and force my hand, not that I couldn’t take care of myself but why temp Fate un-necessarily when your just going out for a simple walk. Thinking of which, a small but amusingly ironic thought played passed my lips and formed a grin. You see my current associates were in fact an order of goodly knights, in which a large number of them were in fact paladins. Thus by association and alliance, I too am technically considered by these paladins, a brother knight. For a necromancer like myself, the irony was delicious. Yes, the autumn air was doing well for my mood and I walked on chuckling to myself.<br>
<br>
As the walk worn on, I unconsciously found myself at the doorstep of the local woods. Now normally a smart little Teir`Dal like myself would avoid the woods in these region unless we had very pressing business inside of them, as the woods in these parts often had an uncomfortable number of savage little Fier’dal run rampant and amok inside them. This particular range of trees was no exception, in fact I did know for a fact that this particular range of woods housed a good number of the little savages, but however I am known to the local Hierophants or the primitive heads of the wood elven tribes, so they more or less leave me alone. Strangely enough I even consider one of those Hierophants a close friend, which I guess my feet have subconsciously brought me here to visit. Strange times indeed.<br>
<br>
Stepping over an over-sized tree root, I had to admit to myself, these local Fier’dal did a decent job of keeping their forest clean and pretty. Unlike some of the human controlled woods I’ve passed through which have been heavily logged, these woods were thick, strong, and strangely beautiful. There was certainly a dark and deeply fantastic feeling in these woods, in which lead to a mysterious atmosphere and in that I found fondly enough very attractive. Maybe it was the way the dying day’s light filtered through the leaves or maybe I was truly going daft among all this goodliness.<br>
<br>
Anyhow I could now make out the faint beginnings of an obnoxious ripping sound, and I knew I was close to my destination. As I silently passed over the crest of a rise of earth, I was treated to an impressive sight of a very small and peaceful waterfall that feed into an eroded gully and off into a wandering stream. Equally impressive and much louder was the snoring form a sleeping troll on a rock base beside the small waterfall. From his feet to over his large belly, the troll was armoured in deep black plated scale mail. The armour even radiated a dark aura of glowing blackness, if your imagination allowed that possibility. A great iron pitted ax, the size of a fully grown man, lay beside the troll as it slept. This all would have lead to a very imposing image if it wasn’t for the dual horned and very much pink helm that topped the troll’s head, thus instead of greatly imposing, the image gained was very much quite queer. But then again it very much fitted Fluffee, and I grinned once more.<br>
<br>
Whispering a small spell of decay, I eroded a bit of the stone base the troll was sleeping on, gravity and Fluffee’s bulk did the rest. With a great plunk, the troll felt the cold and waking embrace of the streams’ water. A mighty roar filled the gully as the troll stood up.<br>
<br>
“PIXIES! PIXIES! PIXIES! Show joos selves! And feel mah mig’ty ax up joos’ arses!” “And side-wazzz tooos!” Snared Fluffee as he located his ax and swung it over his head in a great arc lopping off two near by saplings.<br>
<br>
“Alaene won’t like that.” I chuckled.<br>
<br>
Freezing and looking at his work, Fluffee’s face became like that of a child whose hand was caught in the proverbial cookie jar before dinner. “Ooooopies…..” Waddling over to the executed plants, Fluffee took them up gingerly and re-stuck them into the ground, lightly padding down the earth around the roots. Fluffee then saw me and beamed me a very fang filled maw of a smile. “Hiyaaazz Zimm! Joos no see that okies?”<br>
<br>
“I saw that silly troll!” said a voice on the other side of the stream.<br>
<br>
“Ooooooopies….” Fluffee squeaked.<br>
<br>
Alaene sighed as she moved over to us, with a slight flick of her wrist, saplings glowed for a second green and regrew new roots in the spot Fluffee replanted the stalks.<br>
<br>
“As for you mister” Alaene looked at Fluffee, “What have I told you about swing that ax around wildly?”<br>
<br>
“Me sorrizes” Fluffee said apologetically, and beamed yet another frightening smile.<br>
<br>
“And you, should not have gotten him started. Always my poor plants with you two.” Alaene glared at me. I guess Alaene still hasn’t forgiven me for that rose bush incident a few months ago. Heheh, during the summer, I was feeling a bit more blue in-between my spell research and the knight order’s quests. To cheer me up, Alaene had planted a number of rose bushes around the base of my tower. I being of a little more practical nature, decide to “enhance” the rose bushes and their thorns with my own magic so that they could add to the defense of my tower. Alaene did not at all approve of my “enhancements” on her rose bushes.<br>
<br>
“Anyhow both of you come back to the cabin for some tea, I was about to have some before you two created that ruckus.” Alaene gave me a rude gesture and patted Fluffee on the arm as he waddled after her like a puppy.<br>
<br>
Inhaling deeply, Fluffee managed to get his armoured bulk into the log wood cabin. Without further ceremony, Fluffee pulled off his “drinking cup” from a near-by wooden hook on the wall, plopped into a corner on the floor and held it out like a small child. “Beeeer pleaze!”<br>
<br>
“You know better then that mister. Here’s some apple cider.” Alaene's left eyebrow arched as she un corked an earthen vase and pour the entire content into Fluffee’s drinking cup which was a littler more larger then the size of a human’s head. Taking two long swings of the cider, Fluffee drained the contents of his cup and let out a large burp. “Me sleepy now, blankey pleaze.” Alaene rolled her eyes as she went into the next room and came back with a large blue comforter. Throwing the blanket over his armoured belly and all, Fluffee rolled over into the corner and pretended to fall asleep. Fluffee could be like such a teddy bear sometimes, though one that could rip off your arms.<br>
<br>
I chuckled as I poured Alaene and I each a cup of tea. Siting back on the wicker chairs, and sipping the herbal waters, I then noticed for the first time that most of Alaene’s furniture and belongings were covered or boxed up.<br>
<br>
“Move to a bigger cabin for the trollie, I see.” I chuckled, “I think it would be easier to get him to go on a diet hehe.”<br>
<br>
Alaene smiled, ”Actually, I’m thinking about traveling again.”<br>
<br>
“For how long?” I asked.<br>
<br>
“For a very long time. I will be leaving the order as well.” Alaene said.<br>
<br>
I was beginning to get worried. “Look if it’s about the rose bush, I’m truly sorry, I really am. I just didn’t know they would re-act so violently to my magic.”<br>
<br>
Alaene laughed, “No no, haha it’s not that. It’s just that… there’s a certain whisper in the wind that calls to me, surpassing mere roads and borders. I think Tunare is calling me to her side… To serve her more then I am even now. And I think that will mean I will need to effectively retire from my life here in these woods.”<br>
<br>
“But sheeez’s taking mees with h’er! Joos promised mees Alaene!” The mass of troll barked and the resumed snoring.<br>
<br>
Alaene chuckled, “Someone has to take care of you.”<br>
<br>
I bit back a frown. “So that means everything? The Order, the Circle of Druids, … your friends?”<br>
<br>
Alaene gave off an angelic smile,” I’ll always remember my friends. ‘Sides, what happened to the necromancer that always said he could only trust his undead creations and only needed them for company?”<br>
<br>
“Bah.” I scoffed. “Well… I will miss you and perhaps that trollie too. But I guess a change of pace is good for everyone’s soul. I’m not one for stagnation myself either.” I gave off my best smile, but somehow it felt weak. I felt weak, it was a feeling I didn’t like, but I knew reality too far well and it often went along with or without your wishes.<br>
<br>
Making the most of the time I had left with my friends, we then talked. We talked of past adventures, joys, and comrades-in-arms. Still I could feel the sand slip through my fingers no matter how tight I closed my fist. And as the night wore on, I gave her and the troll one last hug. As I walked towards the door of the cabin, I felt a large hand on my shoulder.<br>
<br>
“Don’t worry, me will keep her safe.”<br>
<br>
I didn’t or couldn’t turn around. But I did managed to get out, “Keep that ax swing low and keep her from losing that temper of her’s when she’s on the road.”<br>
<br>
As I left the cabin, I felt a lot younger, but it wasn’t in a good way. A part of me was somehow missing. It was strange though, even though I wasn’t the one leaving, it sort of felt like I was the one leaving. Looking down the night path winding out of the forest, it was a path I’ve traveled down a hundred times before, yet everything looked strangely alien and foreign. Perhaps even frightening in a way. I chastised myself for that very thought, no self-respecting necromancer gave into fear, for we were fear given mortal form. And feeling loss over a druid and a lowly troll, the very idea… but even then that didn’t help the sadness that I came to understand I now felt. A necromancer with soul… <br>
<br>
The wind then blew an echoing snicker down through the leaves on the ground in a mocking manner.<br>
<br>
Strange times indeed.<br>
