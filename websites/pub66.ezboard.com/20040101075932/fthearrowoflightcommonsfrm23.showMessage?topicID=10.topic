<br>
Unfortunately the human mind is not as sharp as that of a High Elf, so much of the finer details about the history of the guild have been forgotten.  What Aevetare does remember he has shared with me to be the chronicler of the events to share with you.  I will omit the vast amounts of knowledge and experiences that he has related to me but do not pertain to the guild.<br>
<br>
At what point can one definitively state that a new day has commenced?  Is it the instant when the light of the sun on the horizon pierces the morning sky?  What about the warm glow just before that moment, is this not part of the new day as well?<br>
<br>
So it was with Arrow of Light, in the Time of Legend, in the time of Aydrian, Merani, Bangoo, Phildefer and others.  Few remain who remember those times, the time before the first ray of Arrow of Light split the morning sky, when the guild was formed in the woods of Lesser Faydark.  Aevetare was there, in the Time of Legend, before the dawn of our guild.  The story begins in a parallel universe known as the Karana universe….<br>
<br>
Situated on the Western shores of Antonica lies the city of Qeynos, the heart of human activity in those parts.  It was here in the time before the Planes of Power were discovered, before the routes to the moon Luclin opened, before the first boats sailed far to the lands of Velious and Kunark, that a young Paladin named Aevetare first ventured forth to make his mark on the world.<br>
<br>
Aevetare’s early years were spent alone, hunting rats outside of Qeynos and exploring the sewers beneath the city.  When he gained enough confidence and skill he ventured forth to discover the caves of the Sabertooth gnolls nearby in Blackburrow.  It was here during his 9th season that Aev met a young half-elven warrior named Aydrian.  The two fought gnolls together, and it was Aydrian who advised the young paladin that he needed to train in his spell skills for them to increase.  Following Aydrian’s advice, Aev trained in his skills and went back to hunting solo or in groups, losing contact with Aydrian for several seasons.<br>
<br>
The next time that Aev remembers meeting Aydrian, the two had grown in season to their mid teens.  By this time, Aevetare had already joined and was an officer in a silent guild whose name he now does not remember.  However, there the two fighters stood along with a few other fellows in the vast expanses of West Karana.  They were there to help a young ranger, whose name is also forgotten, to track down the Ghoul Messenger.  Although Aevetare isn’t certain, he thinks that one of those people in that hunting party was a young druid whom he had never met before but who went by the name of Jaron, although Aev’s memory may not be quite accurate.<br>
<br>
It was during this hunt that they got to discussing the ‘universe split’ and a new universe being opened up for those stout and brave enough to decide to go there.  At some point a decision was made and several people expressed that they would be moving to the new universe, including Aevetare and Aydrian (and Jaron, if he was truly the druid on the hunting party).  So within the next few days, Aevetare, Aydrian, and the others awoke to find themselves in a whole new world in a universe known as ‘Terris-Thule’ that exactly resembled the old Karana universe.  Because they had a shared past, Aev and Aydrian became good friends From that point on.  Aevetare, having been the only member of his guild to cross the bounds of time and space, abandoned that guild to allow himself to find a new one in this new world... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E6E8fA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub66.ezboard.com/bthearrowoflightcommons.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sytox>Sytox</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Misunderstood PR Officer</span><br>  Posts: 440<br> <font color=#000080>(1/27/03 2:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub66.ezboard.com/fthearrowoflightcommonsfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Time of Legend, part I</span><hr size=1> I very much enjoyed hearing of this time when the universe was young! <p>Sytox 58 Defiler<br>
