I think disbanding her &quot;secondary&quot;, not her primary was not out of line. I asked her the night this was going on if she was leaving, and she replied yes. She stated she was moving to another server. I didn't want to see her leave, after all, I grouped with her alot of the time and was glad to have a &quot;friend&quot; cleric to call upon. Its too bad she's gone and I will miss her, but I won't miss having to hear every time I turn around... &quot;oh I'm leaving the guild....   no its nothing you did.... oh, ok, after you spent an hour of your time begging me to stay I guess I will..&quot;. Sorry things turned out the way they did, but oh well.Thats my two cents.<br>

Torick in real life  you dont even have a clue about what moral s  are or respect, honor,courage,comitment,  all of the things you lack.Most of all i thank you for calling out to destroy this guild with leanna s blessing i guess that how you say thanks to your friends <br>
<br>
Now i have left CON because of this I feel leanna went about this in a very deceptive way.she has lied about her own wants an needs to me an others. I have not i have tried to spare her feelings but she had not the same respect for me so i leave it a that . So leanna you tell the truth you left because terecris was mad at torick an he logged .Fact You went on a fit an wanted someone to begg you to stay the way i have allways done except this time i didnt, ludic tried . you wouldnt respond.<br>
<br>
<br>
So Leanna where are you to have your say why not post instead of just telling people in chat where you get emotional an telling untruths. Yes i told you a lesson in chat i wanted you to think about who you where deserting with out telling anyone but me .Then you twist it around to make it look like you wanted to stay.Why did you do this i dont know but congrats on disbanding the guild now you realy have hurt your friends . <br>

To those who are insulting Leanna, you are all very childish and foolish indeed; very few of you have ANY idea about the stuff she's gone through IRL. I don't mean to flame my old guild members, but seriously.. grow up.<br>
<br>
Second, Sterm you complete and total jerk. CoN collapsed not because of Leanna or Torick leaving, but because of members like you who turn their back on members as soon as you don't need them anymore. I am sorry that this is going to make me look like &quot;A jerk&quot; but honestly, I don't care - I hardly think this is anything in comparision to the crap you guys have been throwing at Leanna/Torick over last few days. Leanna left the guild. She did it quietly (Though it was very rude the way it was done..). Torick tried to do the same, he simply explained his views and wanted to go on his way after he acquired some things. Well, you wouldn't let him do this and it became a big spectacle. I'm glad that this happened, because it finally showed what some people are truly made of.<br>
<br>
Quote : &quot;Then you twist it around to make it look like you wanted to stay.Why did you do this i dont know but congrats on disbanding the guild now you realy have hurt your friends . &quot;<br>
<br>
Just curious, who is the one that left the guild and who was the one that was /guildremoved? As I recall, you kicked her out and then bailed yourself. Granted she may have been asking for it in a way, but to claim that she destroyed the guild makes you look like a complete and total fool. YOU are the one who left the sinking ship. YOU are the one who flamed her and Torick after they stepped out. YOU are the one who kicked her out in the first place!<br>
<br>
And as far as CoN being destroyed by her... it has been dying over the last few months, many of us have seen it. Something like this has been escalating over time and sadly, it had to end this way. I do NOT hold any hard feelings against most CoN or former CoN members. I still feel that most of you are the greatest people in game, and I will miss you terribly. Please do not take post as an end to our friendship, I will always be loyal to my roots.<br>
<br>
EDIT : Just want to make it clear that I did not write this for fun. I truly believe Leanna/Torick to be in the right here.

 I think this sounds like Torick has a little problem with me in real life, and he has brought it into the game .Like the things he said in guildchat. That is unaccepetable to me an yes i was angry.  I dont think the aftermath of Leanna, an what happened, had any thing to do with what  Torick said. He said it because he wanted to say it to Tommy ,not to Sterm .<br>
<br>
Apcon, please understand that i in no way wanted to hurt the guild, or bring real life into it .I made a chioce, wrong or right, it was done .You have made some of those choices your self for everyone in the guild .I might have even thought you were the leader of chosen, if i hadn't known better.Some people where not to happy about this.<br>
Just as people were not happy when Peppe was guilded in by me .I gave him a chance when nobody eles would .I did this out of compassion for someone who wanted to try, an prove him self not to be as bad as everyone said. <br>
<br>
Torick  you have hurt me as a real life friend.  I think you need to remember i know you, an that the game is seperate from real life.<br>
These are computer animated characters ,that can come back from the dead.They can be guilded in a sec an deguilded in a sec. . Only thing real is what people bring to the game ,thats real life emotions that get in the way of what the porpose of the game is, haveing fun.<br>
<br>
I dont want anyone to take this as flaming i just want people to know the story .<br>
Iam sorry that that real life got brought into this, with all the emotion involed it got out of hand from the start, without both sides being heard.I feel i had to defend my self from the start.I dont feel this was, or is fair.<br>
