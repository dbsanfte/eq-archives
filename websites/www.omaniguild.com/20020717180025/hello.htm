<b>0)</b> Please, send me an e-mail to </font><a href="mailto:tetas@omaniguild.com?subject=Screenshot and Equipment"><font color="#FFFFFF">tetas@omaniguild.com</font></a><font color="#FFFFFF">
with a screenshot of your character and a list of the equipment you use.

I have started the website hosting, e-mail setup, etc.  I need some information from
all of you right away, so I can complete this.  I would like you to send me an e-mail
to tetas@omaniguild.com with the following information.

<b>1)</b> Do you want a &quot;stand-alone&quot; mailbox with your EQ name (such as tetas@omaniguild.com)?

<b>2)</b> If so, do you want to:

	a) check your mail on our Omani mail-server?
	or
	b) do you want any e-mail sent to your guild address to be directed automatically
                     to any of your &quot;already-owned&quot; e-mail addresses?

If you want a) above, I will set up an e-mail account with your EQ name
BUT you need to choose the password that you want to use to be able to access that e-mail. 
Send it to me, pls.

If you want b) above, I will set up an e-mail account with your EQ name
BUT you need to send me the e-mail addy you want me to forward the e-mails to.

<b>3)</b> I will setup an account called Guild@omaniguild.com.  Any e-mail sent to that e-mail address
will be distributed automatically to every member of our guild.  When any of you want to reach all
of the guild member, simply send an e-mail to that addy and everyone will receive a copy automatically.
This will be a very easy way to reach everyone :)

<b>4)</b> Other ideas: IRC Chat channel; FTP site for exchange of files, screenshots, etc.; our own newsgroup server?

That's all for now.
Thankies :)
