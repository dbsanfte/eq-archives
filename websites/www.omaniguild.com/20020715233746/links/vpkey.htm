<p><b><br>
<i>1. TRAKANON'S TOOTH </i>--- <i>Dropped by Trakanon who usually averages about 
3 drops per death</i> <br>
<br>
<i>2. MEDALLION OF KYLONG</i> --- <i>Give all 3 portions to Professor Akabao in 
the windmill in the Lake of Ill Omen, loc approx. neg 2600, neg 2900.</i><br>
<br>
(Top portion) In Chardok there is a mob called Niblek, give him a black sapphire 
and a ruby and he gives you the top portion<br>
<br>
(Middle portion) Dropped from Verix Kylox in Karnor's Castle. He's located in 
the basement area. Follow the moat to the right hand side and go into the 
underwater tunnel. He spawns around that area. This is a good xp camp.<br>
<br>
(Bottom portion) Found in the Library of Kaesora. It's just lying on the floor, 
in the corner, of the 2nd floor inside. Getting there can be tricky as you need 
both Invis (at first for spiders) and Invis Undead (for the latter part with 
nearly all undead save one rare chomper). You drop down to the shaft midpoint at 
the entry. Go left and then right through the door. Pass through an invis wall 
and you're good to go from there.<br>
<br>
<i>3. MEDALLION OF JARSATH</i> --- <i>Give all 3 portions to Xiblin Fizzlefutt 
in the Timorous Deep (His loc is -5800,2950)</i><br>
<br>
(Top portion) It's just lying around in the Swamp of No Hope at loc 52, 2935, -6 
(note: near the water) This is the easiest part to get so grab it some time on 
your way to OS.<br>
<br>
(Middle portion) Dropped by an Iksar monk in Firiona Vie named &quot;an ancient 
Jarsath&quot; (wanders near the Drolvarg camp - check tracking around the loc 
270,-1900) (note: whenever you're in the zone, ask a cleric/SK/necro to sense 
undead, the only other undead mob in the zone is Velkis' pet, so if she's not up 
and the PC senses undead, you have an AJ up) This mob seems to be an 8 hour 
spawn, is up after a server reset, and has no known PH.<br>
<br>
(Bottom portion) Dropped by the Bloodgill Marauder who guards the entrance to 
Veskar at the bottom of the Lake of Ill Omen (His loc is -380,-50,-190) This mob 
also seems to be an 8 hour spawn, is up after a reset, at has no known PH.<br>
<br>
<i>4. MEDALLION OF OBULUS</i> --- <i>Give all 3 portions to Slixin Klex in the 
Burning Woods located at -681, -1120, -560</i><br>
<br>
(Top portion) Quest mob Sselot Dnaas who spawns in an island in Warsilks Woods 
at loc 3900, 300 (Give him a burnished wooden staff from Chardok, have an 
enchanter charm and do the trade)<br>
<br>
(Middle portion) Dropped by a rotting skeleton at loc 2100, -5100 in the 
Dreadlands <br>
<br>
(Bottom portion) Dropped by the Pained Soul in Trakanon just outside the Old 
Sebilis Portal The Pained Soul (and its placeholders) spawn at Loc: -1857, 
-4373. This mob is a serious bottleneck and is usually too dangerous to camp for 
non solo capable classes.<br>
<br>
To get there: <br>
<br>
Facing out of the Seb tunnel, take a right and go through door. Take a left and 
move up a bit. Then turn to your right and the pained soul/spec keeper/spec 
champion should be in front of you.<br>
<br>
<u><i><font size="4">Take all 3 &quot;completed&quot; medallions and the tooth and return 
them to Emperor Ganak in Trakanon's Teeth to get the Key to Veeshan's Peak. <br>
&nbsp;</font></i></u></b></p>
<hr color="#004080" width="80%">
<p align="center"><b><font size="5">Extended Version - The Key of Veeshan</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b>The main quest is given by Emperor Ganak (-2740, +2845) in 
Trakanon's Teeth (this is the same guy that gives the Sebilis key quest), but it 
involves several subquests. These are the quests for the medallions of Jarsath, 
Obulus, and Kylong. Each of the 3 medallions consists of 3 pieces each (9 
medallion pieces + the tooth = 10 piece total quest for the key). Once you have 
all 3 medallions you simply hand them in along with one of Trakanon's fangs to 
get your Key of Veeshan (Note: You can not use the tooth dropped off the named 
trakaraptor in TT, it must be from the actual poison dragon Trakanon in Sebilis).<br>
<br>
Hint: If you get the medallion pieces mixed up in your inventory, just get 
someone to cast identify on you while they're on your cursor and it will give 
you the name of the segment your holding.<br>
<br>
<font size="5">Medallion of Jarsath</font><br>
<br>
This quest is given by Xiblin Fizzlebik (-5777, +2943) in Timorous Deep, like 
each of the medallions, there are 3 pieces you<br>
must return to him for the Medallion of Jasarth. By the way, this is the &quot;easy&quot; 
medallion. :)<br>
<br>
The first portion is located in Firiona Vie and is dropped off the ancient 
Jarsath. The ancient is a level 40 Iksar skeleton <br>
monk (4000 HP) that spawns very close to the mouth of the drolvarg temple at 
+647, -2097 and roams down the hill to the <br>
nearby drolvarg camp then across the road a bit and back. I suggest killing all 
non-drolvarg NPCs in this area (which there <br>
are very few) to get him to spawn, and from what I could deduct the placeholder 
is a leech that wanders in this area (Note: <br>
this does not mean he necessarily does have a PH, it may just be a long spawn 
but this is what it appeared to be like). Also <br>
he is the only undead mob in the whole zone (at the time this was written, 
assuming they don't add any), so sense the dead <br>
works great if you have it. Approximate time it took me: 2 hours.<br>
<br>
The next piece is on the blood gill marauder at the bottom of Lake of Ill Omen 
at -376, -52. He is a static non-roaming lake <br>
goblin with 2 lesser guards, level 35-39, and the marauder himself is level 40 
(3000 HP). He hits around the 90s, guards hit <br>
in the 70s. His spawn point is a few feet inside the &quot;entrance&quot; to the 
underwater temple here (so bring your fishbone, local <br>
enduring breath caster, or potions), even though it ends in a dead end (Note: 
this is the future site of the zone-in for the <br>
pending underwater dungeon). The picture shows his exact spot, unagro'd and 
undisturbed (click to enlarge). Approximate time <br>
it took me: 5 hours, but I left and came back once or twice and likely missed 
his spawn, I have returned twice since and he <br>
was already up both times.<br>
<br>
The last piece is incredibly easy, it's just a bag sitting on the ground in the 
Swamp of No Hope at +52, +2935, there are no <br>
dangerous NPCs in the area. The exact respawn time of the bag is unknown to me, 
but reasonable. Approximate time: However <br>
long it takes you to run to the Swamp.<br>
<br>
<font size="5">Medallion of Obulus</font><br>
<br>
Slixin Klex (-681, -1127) in Burning Woods holds the quest for this one.<br>
<br>
This is one of the more agonizing pieces, requiring you to kill the pained soul 
in Trakanon's Teeth. The pained soul has a <br>
single spawn, static, Iksar spectre placeholder at -1835, -4368, which is pretty 
close to the ramp that leads down to the <br>
Sebilis bubble. He is about level 44 and hits for over 100 and his placeholder 
spawns every 8.5 minutes exactly. Approximate <br>
time: It took me 6 hours, and from what I have heard it typically ranges from 
4-10 hours for him to show up.<br>
<br>
The next portion is from Dreadlands, dropped off a rotting skeleton. The rotting 
skeleton has a single, static, non-roaming <br>
placeholder that spawns at +2246, -5113 which is up on the ledge above one of 
the spider intensive areas here. As you are <br>
exiting the Frontier Mountains zone, hug the wall left and stay up farily high 
on it to find him. The spot has a quick (7 <br>
minute exactly) respawn, but he is somewhat uncommon, and is level 43 (5000 HP). 
Approximate time it took me: 2 hours.<br>
<br>
The final medallion piece for this quest has its own subquest from Ssolet Dnaas 
(+4010, +396) in Warslilks Woods. Contrary to<br>
the guide on AllaKhazam's site (which is what I tried to do the quest with, but 
lacks a ton of critical information), you <br>
can't kill him for the piece or hand him the burnished wooden staff from 
Chardok, handing him the staff is your only option. <br>
The staff is a random drop on any mob in Chardok (45-60 zone), and drops quite 
frequently (6 dropping in one night of hunting<br>
is not uncommon). The only problem is he is on some type of Iksar faction (not 
Legion of Cabilis because I am warmly to them)<br>
which most non-Iksars are KOS to. Unless you somehow have good enough faction 
with him to receive the quest, you have to <br>
bring along an enchanter or bard to charm him, he is level 50 and very buggy (ie 
he won't even leave his spawn point if <br>
agro'd). Once he is charmed simply hand him the staff to get your medallion 
piece. Approximate time: Minimal hours of Chardok <br>
hunting + however long it takes you to find an enchanter and take them to 
Warslilks Woods.<br>
<br>
<font size="5">Medallion of Kylong</font><br>
<br>
This is the last and in my opinion hardest medallion. The quest is offered by 
Professor Akabo (-2540, -2994) in Lake of Ill <br>
Omen. NOTE: The professor cons dubious to most people, but will still give you 
the medallion as long as he offers you the quest.<br>
<br>
There is a subquest in Chardok given by the NPC ratman Niblek for the first 
piece. He requires you to bring him a Black <br>
Sapphire and a Ruby (I buy rubies in Highpass) for his medallion segment. I 
provided a map to the right (click to enlarge <br>
and note: the gold section is where you would be entering the tunnel from), but 
it isn't very good. However, the directions <br>
to his area are simple, and he doesn't roam. As you run up the ramp to the exit 
a bit and turn around, look to the left of <br>
the castle and you'll see a ledge that leads to a tunnel. You need levitate to 
get up here, and either a group to clear the <br>
way or invis (Note: invis works great here on all the mobs in this tunnel except 
chodikai &quot;dog&quot; models which there can<br>
be none or several in the path, up to you if you want to risk it, I did). Follow 
the tunnel down until the first fork which<br>
is Y-shaped and take a right, at the second fork which is T-shaped take a left, 
and a right again at the 3rd and last fork <br>
which is also T-shaped and just hug the wall right. Once you start seeing ratmen 
slaves (around the 3rd fork) you are pretty <br>
much safe from harmful NPCs except the slaves themselves which are like level 
negative 10. (aka if you actually die to these <br>
slaves solo or not you have no business in Veeshan's Peak :P) Niblek is 
indifferent to everyone as far as I know, simply hand<br>
him the 2 gems for your piece and you are set. Approximate time it took me: 
15-20 minutes, I got seen by a dog once and had<br>
to gate, rest, and try again (but thats not counting getting gems, I already had 
a black sapphire when I decided to do the <br>
quest).<br>
<br>
There is a piece sitting on the ground on the 2nd floor of the library here, 
click the map on the right to enlarge. Kaesora<br>
is a low (30ish) level zone and you will need both regular invis and invis vs. 
undead to get down here if you really don't <br>
want to be seen, but the majority of the MOBs in the way are undead (the spiders 
are live). The &quot;respawn&quot; on this piece is 2 hours, <br>
10 minutes. Approximate time: 5 minutes if the medallion segment is up to 2 
hours 10 minutes if you just missed it.<br>
<br>
This is the hardest section of all save the tooth from Trakanon in my personal 
opinion. It is located in Karnor's Castle on <br>
Verix Kyloxs remains. He is a level 51 shaman Iksar skeleton, and a fairly rare 
spawn. The following directions were given<br>
to me by a guildmate taken off a messageboard I was not told of nor the server 
of the author (but his name is included), <br>
however if you do know where it came from e-mail me at the link below so I can 
properly credit him.<br>
<br>
<br>
The VP quest guy spawns in the sewers. Enter sewer from moat, when you rise out 
of<br>
the water take a right and then the next right (if you take either of the lefts 
you come<br>
across additional water spots, looking forward to exploring these some day). 
You'll be in a<br>
room with a staircase on your right-ish and two adjacent rooms on your left. 
First left<br>
room has 3 skeleton pops, next room has 4ish skeletons and the VP fellow / ph. 
He's a<br>
shaman, he summons.<br>
Maeghant Tuskbone<br>
<br>
<br>
The placeholder is the &quot;decayed kylong&quot;, who spawns every 20-30 minutes. This 
particular area of Karnor's is a great place to<br>
farm since you can pull turnkeys and skeletal caretakers here. Approximate time 
it took me: 5-6 hours, it varies.. but the <br>
hard part is getting a group competent enough to hold the area for a while.<br>
