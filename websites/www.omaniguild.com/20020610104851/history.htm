<p><font face="Arial">Around the start of the summer
2000, the founders of Omani were all in separate guilds.&nbsp; Bloodshard,
Eludyan, Nabber were in Brothers of Fire, Azursa and Quellick were in Amber
Order, Fhyre was in Harbingers of Innoruuk and Hideo was in Forsaken Conclave.&nbsp;
That's just a few names that come from the original group of people. </font>
<p><font face="Arial">They grouped quite frequently and did 
things their own guilds could not do themselves.&nbsp; At the time Hideo was not 
very happy in his current guild.&nbsp; On July 27th 2000 he sent Azursa this 
email... &nbsp; </font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial"><i>"Dunno about you, but just a shot in the dark here.&nbsp;
Seems that its</i>
<br><i>always you, quellick, nabber, bloodshard, Eludyan and myself grouped.</i>
<br><i>We sometimes have some others involved but the core group appears
to be</i>
<br><i>the previous mentioned people.&nbsp; Ever thought of making our
own little</i>
<br><i>guild heh?&nbsp; Just and idea but I know how it is to start new
guilds, can</i>
<br><i>be rough having helped start one</i>."</font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial">Azursa then asked the others what
they thought about that idea.&nbsp; Most were reluctant they didn't want
to leave their current guilds.&nbsp; Time went on and Hideo and Azursa
pushed the idea more frequently.&nbsp; Hideo's main idea was to create a small
guild of friends.&nbsp; They weren't going to strive to compete with others,
strive to be the first to kill this and that, simply to get along with
people and have fun. </font>
<p><font face="Arial">Eventually they all decided that
another direction was best choice.&nbsp; They were going to create a guild
and determine their own direction instead of ride the coat tails of another.&nbsp;
The aforementioned people including a few others gathered and began the
arduous task of deciding a name. </font>
<p><font face="Arial">Unfortunately all the names we
chose were rejected.&nbsp; Some of which included, Illuminati, The Illuminati,
The Foundation, Foundation, The Circle...&nbsp; Finally after about a week
of name rejection Azursa brought up Omani.&nbsp; The name was excepted
and Omani was born. </font>

<p><b><font size=2 face="Arial">What is Omani ? </font>
</b>
<font size="2" face="Arial">
<p><font face="Arial">In ancient Mediterranean era
there existed a group called the Omani.&nbsp; They were a secret society
that carried out the dirty work of the governments.&nbsp; They were a small,
discreet group of very experienced and dangerous professionals. </font>
<p><font face="Arial">To this day, Omani is a well
known and respected guild.&nbsp; We treat others with the respect they
deserve.&nbsp; Welcome into our ranks many friends and skilled players.&nbsp;
Omani is relatively small guild compared to some but we can do things most
others cannot.&nbsp; We try to accomplish goals sometimes beyond our limits.&nbsp;
Omani doesn't always fail either, sometimes we have accomplished what no
others have done before. </font><font size="4" face="Arial">
