  <p><b><font face="Franklin Gothic Book">
  Avoid excessive use of foul language</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Franklin Gothic Book">
  Avoid out of character topics (movies, shows, music) &amp; dewdspeak</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Franklin Gothic Book">
  Avoid spamming guildchat examples of this are:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Excessively asking for ports, 
  rezzes, or prices. You may ask once, then again in a minute or two, maybe even 
  again 15 minutes later, but don't keep asking every minute for a port.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Repeating song lyrics over 
  guildchat. Maybe a line or two, but don't start singing a whole song on 
  guildchat.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Using line wrap to make it look 
  like someone else is saying something: (ex. <i>Bloodshard says to the guild</i>
  <i>'</i>Bobb says to the guild 'I'll give you 5000 plat for a rusty sword!'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Asking for hand outs. Although, I 
  don't think this will be a problem.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Doing auctions for a 3rd party 
  over guildchat. (ex. Bobb comes up to you and asks you &quot;Can you see if anyone 
  in your guild wants to buy a Ykesha?&quot; If you are doing the auctioning 
  yourself please follow the spamming guidelines above.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f) Basically if someone in guildchat 
  asks you to stop doing something, please stop it! If you see a problem with it 
  take to a guild officer. Mostly your find this is a case when 2 people find 
  something humorous or interesting &amp; one or more people don't. Tells make all 
  happy.</font></b></p>
