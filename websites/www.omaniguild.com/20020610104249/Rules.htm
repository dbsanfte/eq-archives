some of the most difficult areas in Norrath and establish our name as a skilled, 
guild for others to look up to with a sense of trust and respect.</font></P></DIV>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Rules for Entrance</font></a></P></DIV>
<DIV class=answer id=twoAnswer>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF">The minimum level required to join is now <b>56</b>.&nbsp; The level requirement may 
change in time as Omani grows larger.</font></P>
<UL style="color: #003366">
  <LI><font color="#FFFFFF">You will have to group with guild members for at least 2 weeks 
  (and no more than 4 weeks) on a 
  regular basis. </font> 
  <LI><font color="#FFFFFF">Must be liked by all in the guild &amp; have no questions of character or 
  judgment that could hurt the image of the guild in the eyes of others.&nbsp; 
  Of course you are free to prove otherwise. </font> 
  <LI><font color="#FFFFFF">Must not be a multi-person played character. </font> 
  <LI><font color="#FFFFFF">You must have  the Sebilis and HS keys (faction 
  concern is the only acceptable reason for not having an HS key) and an 
  Enduring Breath item.</font><LI><font color="#FFFFFF">You must have an "informal" interview with Azursa, 
  Bumana or Chadric first (in game), 
  to be considered as an applicant. </font> </LI></UL>
<P>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF">Sponsorship:</font></P>
<UL style="color: #003366">
  <LI><font color="#FFFFFF">All new recruits must have a sponsor. Please be sure you know and are 
  willing to vouch for a person you are sponsoring. We are trusting your 
  judgment on this person and that you know them well. Don't  sponsor a 
  random person just because they ask.</font></LI>
  <LI><font color="#FFFFFF">To be able to sponsor someone, you have to have been a member of Omani for 
  at least one month (30 days).&nbsp; A person can only sponsor one recruit at a 
  time.</LI>
  <LI>The recruit must be willing to print out viable maps of the zones we 
  frequent, unless they are familiar with all known zones.<br>
&nbsp;</font></LI></UL>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF">Voting / Polls:</font></P>
<ul style="color: #003366">
  <LI><font color="#FFFFFF">The first date as a recruit will be determined by when their sponsor posts 
  that they are sponsoring them on our recruiting board <i>after</i> the recruit 
  has had their interview wih Azursa, Chadric or Bumana. After a minimum of 2 
  weeks time a poll will be posted to vote on the recruit. </font> 
  <LI><font color="#FFFFFF">The recruit needs at least <b>30</b> &quot;YES&quot; votes to 
  join and no (zero, none, zip, zilch) "NO" votes.</font></LI> 
  <LI><font color="#FFFFFF">A recruit will have 7 days to attain these &quot;yes&quot; votes from 30 members of 
  the guild after he/she is polled. When and if a person receives 30 votes, they 
  will be invited asap.</LI> 
  <LI>If a prospective recruit, obtains more than 45% of the total votes in 
  Abstentions, this person will be kept as a recruit pending a poll 1-2 weeks 
  later. What this means is A) the Sponsor did not take his/her job to heart, 
  and did not allow the recruit enough grouping time with the voting guild as a 
  whole or B) The recruit did not make enough of an effort with his/her 
  recruitment, and needs to be held back.</LI> 
  <LI>If after the second recruit period this person has still not made the 
  required effort to be grouped/group with, he/she will be effectively 
  back-burned until such a time as they can dedicate themselves to a guild such 
  as ours.</LI> 
  <LI>IMPORTANT: After 7 days, if the person does not receive 30 &quot;yes&quot; votes, 
  he/she will be turned down.</LI> 
  <LI>A legitimate NO, will also turn the recruit down.</LI> 
  <LI>Voting guidelines:<br>
  <b>Yes</b> votes: you want them to join the guild. you feel they will be a 
  good addition to the guild and are Omani material.<br>
  <b>No</b> votes: you have reason to not want this person to join the guild, be 
  it a history with this person or you know that his/her conduct is unfitting 
  for our family. <br>
  <b>Abstains</b>: you are indifferent toward this persons joining. you have 
  never met or grouped with this person.<br>

<OL style="color: #003366; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt">
  <LI><font color="#FFFFFF">Excessively asking for ports, rezzes, or prices. You may ask once, then 
  again in a minute or two, maybe even again 15 minutes later, but don't keep 
  asking every minute for a port. </font> 
  <LI><font color="#FFFFFF">Repeating song lyrics over guildchat. Maybe a line or two, but don't start 
  singing a whole song on guildchat. </font> 
  <LI><font color="#FFFFFF">Using line wrap to make it look like someone else is saying something
  </font> 
  <LI><font color="#FFFFFF">Asking for hand outs. Although, I don't think this will be a problem.
  </font> 
  <LI><font color="#FFFFFF">Doing auctions for a 3rd party over guildchat. (ex. Bobb comes up to you 
  and asks you "Can you see if anyone in your guild wants to buy a Ykesha?").&nbsp; If 
  you are doing the auctioning yourself please follow the spamming guidelines 
  above. </font> 
  <LI><font color="#FFFFFF">Basically if someone in guildchat asks you to stop doing something, please 
  stop it! If you see a problem with it take to a guild officer. Mostly your 
  find this is a case when 2 people find something humorous or interesting &amp; 
  one or more people don't. Tells make all happy. </font> </LI></OL></DIV>

<DIV class=answer id=fourAnswer>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF">When your conduct promotes an image unbecoming of the guild. Such as,</font></P>
<UL style="color: #003366">
  <LI><font color="#FFFFFF">Kill-stealing excessively, "ninja-looting", creating a hostile environment 
  for another guild member, purposely lying. </font> 
  <LI><font color="#FFFFFF">When such a situation occurs you may be removed immediately from the 
  guild. You are henceforth on Probationary Status. If you feel you have been 
  wronged you may take this up with another guild officer or the guild leader. 
  Only the guild leader may re-establish someone who has been removed and placed 
  on Probationary Status. You may have your guild status returned if it was 
  wrongly removed. Almost no one is permanently removed. You may be asked to 
  perform an act of penance to have your guild status returned and/or be asked 
  to not be in the guild for a period of time (a week, a month, perhaps even 
  years). If you do not perform this act then you may remain in Probationary 
  Status and out of the guild. If you perform the penance decided upon by the 
  officers &amp; leader, you may have your status reestablished. </font> 
  <LI><font color="#FFFFFF">If deemed a player may be placed into Exiled Status. This player will 
  never be allowed into the guild again. This would be an extreme case. </font>

<DIV class=answer id=fiveAnswer>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF">The bringing in of secondary characters , referred to as twinks for the rest 
of this document is allowed. This is to assist in the continual access to 
guildchat as well as help in developing fellowship amongst the guild.</font></P>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF">Bringing your twinks into the guild is not mandatory but is allowed. If the 
twink is below the level requirements of the guild (level 56 at this time) they 
must remain roleplay or anon.</font></P>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF">Twinks are not allowed to request for equipment, ports, or rezzes over guild 
chat. They may ask specific members via tell to assist but this should be 
avoided. This is to avoid begging. Once they reach the level requirements of the 
guild this stipulation is lifted.</font></P>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF">Twinks should readily identify who's twink they are if asked. If one is 
uncomfortable with this then do not bring the twink into the guild.</font></P>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF">Any member of the guild who leaves or is removed from the guild must 
immediately remove all twinks as well. No exceptions!</font></P>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF">Twinks in the guild must adhere to all rules &amp; policies of the guild. 
Even if they are anonymous.</font></P></DIV>

  <li><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>TIER 2</b> - Only one or two specific items will be merited, other loot will be 
  <i>need before greed</i>, random among who needs -- these are mobs that have at 
least a few (2-3) highly desired items.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>TIER 1</b> - <i>Need Before Greed</i> / random among who needs -- mobs that are on a 
level to kill that it takes little preparation and most/all of the loot is 
not in high demand.</font></li>

<P><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Spells:</b><br>
Spells will be totally separate from all Tiers. 
Certain specific spells will also be merited based on seniority/raid 
participation/level.</font></P>

<b>Merit:</b><br>What is merit based on? A combination of seniority/raid participation/level.

Raid leaders have the right to change the loot rules PRIOR to asking people 
to join the raid as long as they inform people of them.</font></P>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Friends:</b><br>If a friend comes long, they will be eligible to roll on all items, except 
loot/spells that are merited. The guildie inviting someone is responsible 
for informing their friend of our loot rules.</font></P>
