<br>
Quest 4#- Journeyman Cloak:<br>
<br>
Jaima is in the Shaman's Guild in Shar Vhal.<br>
<br>
Hand Jaima your Apprentice Cloak.<br>
<br>
She will hand you a 4 slot bag and ask you to fill it with Sonic Wolf Paws. <br>
<br>
These paws are the stackable, droppable kind that drop from all kinds of Sonic Wolves in Hollowshade Moor. Please do not confuse these with the No Drop Sonic Pup Paws which also drop from Sonic Wolves.<br>
<br>
Combine 4 paws in the bag to create a Bag of Sonic Wolf Paws. <br>
<br>
Hand Jaima the Bag of Sonic Wolf Paws. In return you will be given a note and your Ceremonial Strainer. <br>
<br>
This concludes the part to get your strainer, but it does not conclude the quest for the Sonic Wolf Bane weapons.<br>
<br>
To continue on, hand the note given to you by Jaima to Amat Luziq. Amat is located in the library right outside of the Palace in Shar Vhal.<br>
<br>
Amat will give you a spear shaft and ask you to speak with Qua.<br>
<br>
Qua supplies the books which describe how to make the different parts of the Sonic Wolf Bane weapons, but you can save yourself the plat and just read about them here.<br>
<br>
Qua also sells the weapon kit which you will need to combine each of the parts in with the spear shaft to create your Sonic Wolf Bane spear.<br>
<br>
reactive sealant soak (brewing - triv 135):<br>
<br>
blackened salt crystals, sonic wolf brain, crystalized ygri root, digested night palm, water flask - brewed in a ceremonial strainer (Vah Shir shaman item)<br>
<br>
Now it is time to make your Sonic Wolf Bane Weapon, that require the cooperation of every class of Vah Shir.<br>
(This point is very tricky, because it is very difficult to get in contact with others that “might” be doing this progressive quest!!!)<br>
<br>
sonic wolf bane weapon - combine in the weapon assembly kit (sold by Arms Historian Qua):<br>
<br>
reactive sealant soak, sonic wolf bane poison, toughened sinew lashings, ceramic dagger sleeve*, porous dagger blade*<br>
<br>
(*exception: Beastlords, which needs porous claws &amp; ceramic claw sleeve set instead)<br>
<br>
Once you create your sonic wolf bane spear (damage 4, delay 21, +3 vs sonic wolves) you need to bring the weapon to Jaima, along with your Apprentice Cloak.<br>
<br>
Jaima will give you back the spear, along with a new cloak, which is your Cloack of the Dar Khura Journeyman. <br>

Quest 5#- Garrison Cloak:<br>
<br>
Bring your Journeyman's Cloak to Ahom Guzhin, who is found just inside the tunnel from Hollowshade Moor to Grimling Forest off to the left in the cupola partly hidden behind a rock.<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Ahom Guzhin'<br>
<br>
Ahom Guzhin says 'Please do not think poorly of me, but I must see your Journeyman's cloak if you wish to converse. Be quick about it. This place is not completely safe. '<br>
<br>
Hand him your Journeyman's Cloak...<br>
<br>
Ahom Guzhin says 'Ah, there it is... I haven't seen one of those in a while. I remember when I first became a journeyman myself. That was many seasons and twice as many trails ago. Time becomes most deft in the period just after you figure that you've got a grasp on it. '<br>
<br>
Ahom Guzhin says 'Well, let us get back to pebbles and tax, shall we? You displayed a great deal of bravery in coming out here and looking for me. I fear my age is beginning to show. I can't evade danger as I did in my youth. With that in mind, I would like you to take this journal back to town for me. Historian Sharar will tend to my notes for me. She is a trusted friend and a valuable scholar. Please give it to her with my thanks. '<br>
<br>
He will hand you a journal to take to Historian Sharar, who is in the Palace Courtyard in Shar Vahl in the library area that is off to the right as you enter the Palace Courtyard from the Merchants area.<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Historian Sharar'<br>
<br>
Historian Sharar says 'It is a pleasure to meet you, friend. Please let me know if you have trouble finding the book that you seek. If you request something that we do not have available, I can make a note to keep an eye out for it. We are getting in a great variety of interesting new material these days. Speaking of which, I need someone to take a tome to Elder Animist Dumul. He has been frantically researching something or another. I'm sure that you could pry a little and learn more about it if you were to take this book to him. Is that something that you would be interested in doing? '<br>
<br>
Hand him the journal that you got from Ahom Guzhin.<br>
<br>
Historian Sharar says 'I see that you've found the codger. He really should settle down and come in from the weather. I often find myself worrying about him these days. Adventure takes its toll on everyone. I'd like to see him settle down before the moor takes a final toll from him. '<br>
<br>
Historian Sharar says 'Well, I can't say that it isn't a pleasure to have his journal. He's documented the moor with such splendid detail. I cannot wait to see what he's written in these last few seasons. It is all so very helpful. Just take a look at these earplugs. They are a product of his last set of notes. He came up with the idea, while hunting owlbear in the moor. They are supposed to keep the sound they make from harming you. You can keep them, if you take this note to General Avilah for me. '<br>
<br>
Historian Sharer hands you an Earring of the Owlbear, and a note to take to General Avilah.<br>
<br>
The Earring of the Owlbear is a NO DROP earring with no stats, and a right click effect of Immunity to Owlbear Screech.<br>
<br>
Take the note to General Avilah who is in the North section of Shar Vahl, towards Hollowshade, in a room on the 3rd floor of a building (use the outside stairs).<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, General Avilah'<br>
<br>
General Avilah says 'Thank you for delivering this. While I have you here, perhaps you can help. We are in dire need of assistance in the moor. All of the reports from our Taruun are indicating the same thing. The area has to be swept clear of the factions that currently inhabit it. The land itself seems defendable, we need someone to gather some soldiers and clear the area. '<br>
<br>
General Avilah says 'If you accomplish this mission for us, I will be able to reward you for your actions in this leadership role. You will need only to return this box to me to collect your reward and promotion. It will need to contain a grimling chieftain staff, an owlbear guardian talon, a sonic wolf guardian fang, and your Journeyman's Cloak. Good luck to you, should you elect to accept this challenge. '<br>
<br>
You gain experience!!<br>
<br>
General Avilah gives you a long wooden box (lore, no drop, wt 0.3, 4-slot giant capacity container) in which to collect the needed items. Each of the needed items drops rarely from grimlings (grimling chieftan staff, lore, magic, no drop, wt 2.0, medium, none/none), owlbears (owlbear guardian talon, magic, lore, no drop, wt 0.2, tiny, none/none), and sonic wolves (sonic wolf guardian fang, lore, magic, no drop, wt 0.1, tiny, none/none) in Hollowshade Moor.<br>
<br>
Once you have all three items, place them in the box along with your Journeyman's cloak, and hit combine. Take the combined box of war trophies (magic, lore, no drop, wt 3.0, medium, none/none) back to General Avilah.<br>
<br>
General Avilah says 'You have proven to be a great leader and excellent soldier. Please accept this cloak as a symbol of your accomplishment. We would be proud to have you as a member of our ranks. You can choose to stay within the ranks of your sect or you can work with us was a member of the Shar Vahl Garrison. If you wish to continue your work as a member of the garrison, please take this form, sign it in triplicate and give it to Captain Darznel. Either way, please stand still, while I offer you our formal salutation. '<br>
<br>
General Avilah shouts 'Ahem... Citizens of Shar Vahl, Attention! It is my duty and honor as commander of the Shar Vahl Garrison to thank Tnar for their fine work. Give 'em your complete respect and salute 'em when you see them in passing. We enjoy our freedom, because of brave citizens like Tnar. Thank you for your time... Carry on! '<br>
<br>
General Avilah will hand you a form to take to Captain Darznel, along with your new Garrison Cloak. <br>

Quest 6#- Officer's Cloak:<br>
<br>
Now it's time to trek back to Grimling Forest and hand the form to Captain Darznel...<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Captain Darznel'<br>
<br>
Captain Darznel says 'Well met, friend. May I be of assistance? '<br>
<br>
Hand him the form you got from General Avilah...<br>
<br>
Captain Darznel says 'Let's see, yes... yes... It looks like you signed everything in the correct spot. That can only mean that you're not only brave, but you have some wits as well. If you have all of your teeth and can stand on one leg until the count of five, I think we can make use of you. '<br>
<br>
Captain Darznel says 'Take this Polished Acrylia Sphere and give it to Scout Husman. He's been leading raiding parties against the grunt camps. Adventurers are great, but we need a real soldier to assist him this time. Perhaps we will get better results with your help. '<br>
<br>
Captain Darznel says 'After you complete that raid, please go with Scouts Danarin and Derrin. Once you secure those camps, bring me any grimling intelligence reports or documents that you may have found. Place the documents and your Garrison cloak in this bag and bring them back to me. Complete this task and you may even get a promotion. '<br>
<br>
Captain Darznel will hand you a 4 slot box, and a Polished Acrylia Sphere. You will need to complete the raids given by each scout, and loot the Captured Grimling Documents that each officer drops. They will appear as Captured Grimling Documents I, II, and III. Be sure to also loot the body part dropped by the officer and hand it back to the scout, so you will have the medals that you will need for the next part.<br>
<br>
Once you have completed the three raids (bring friends - it can be tough to keep the scout alive), place the three Captured Grimling Documents in the box, along with your Garrison Cloak, and hit combine. Hand the combined box back to Captain Darznel.<br>
<br>
Captain Darznel says 'This documentation is a great start. Judging by the amount <br>
of material here, we'll be able to formulate a new battle within the week. It shouldn't take our linguists too long to decipher this scribble. '<br>
<br>
Captain Darznel says 'I cannot help but think that your presence and leadership are what made those missions such wonderful successes. I have been authorized to give you a field promotion for your valor and bravery in combat. You're ability to lead was the keystone in the success of those engagements. Welcome to the rank of Garrison Officer, Tnar! '<br>
<br>
Captain Darznel says 'We can celebrate your promotion when we make it back to the rear. Right now, I need you to lead another set of missions into the grunt occupied territory. Speak to Captain Necin and show him the Soldier's chest that you've filled with the medals that you earned from the first set of raids. He will direct you through the next several mission. Once you have completed the missions, combine the Medallion of the Hero of Shar Vahl and your Officer's cloak in this Satchel. Take the Locked Satchel to Sergeant Cursah. He will assist you from that point forward. '<br>
<br>
Captain Darznel will hand you a 2 slot container, and your new Garrison Officer cloak!<br>

Gonna have to look into it further and see if it is feasible...  Thanks for the info!    <br>
<br>
As a side note, in reading this, since the revamp of Grimling Forest, the raid parts of this quest for that zone may have changed (as did the initial BL epic fight)....  Gonna try to check into this further and hopefully get Flurrey this cloak in time.  We all know that Shammies can use all the mana they can get! <p>Venerable Tobbi<br>
