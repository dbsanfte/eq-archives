<br>
     I just wanted to enlighten everyone with an easy quest that is done in Gunthak that involves various fingerbones dropped in Gunthak.  <br>
<br>
     This quest is triggered by turning in named fingerbones to a Dark Elf NPC in the back of the tunnels.  There are 3 different types of fingerbones used in this quest.  First is the Cracked Fingerbones which are dropped by any humanoid type NPC on the beach area.  Second are the Broken Fingerbones which are dropped at the dock town just before the Dulak zone off of any humanoid NPC there.  Third are the Pristine Fingerbones which drop off of any humanoid NPC near the castle in Gunthak.  <br>
<br>
     When you collect 4 fingerbones of the same type and turn them into the dark elf, it triggers 5 waves of 5 NPC's for a total of 25 mobs.  In the last wave a named NPC will spawn that drops a nice item.  Also the level of the mobs and the difficulty of the battle is based on the type of fingerbones turned in.<br>
<br>
1. Easiest are the Cracked Fingerbones<br>
2. Medium are the Broken Fingerbones<br>
3. Hardest is the Pristine Fingerbones<br>
<br>
     We had a little experience in this last night (3-13-03) which our first run was with Pristine Fingerbones and needless to say it was a disaster.  Then we did it again with Cracked Fingerbones and was successful but then again, we were a little over prepared.  Later that night we tried our luck again with Broken Fingerbones and was successful again.  We seen some rather nice items drop on both the successful battles.  the Cracked reward us with a 25 dmg 40 dly 2HS sword with some nice stats and the Broken rewarded us with a nice caster face mask with stats and R/click effect of arch shielding with a 0.5 second cast time.<br>
<br>
     I don't think the loot is the same every time.  I think it is random even upon turning in the same type of fingerbones.  In other words I don't think the sword will drop when the Broken Fingerbones are turned in or if the quest is done again using the Cracked Fingerbones.<br>
<br>
     We also decided (we being Rheyah, Segester and me) that the loot from the end mob should go to the person(s) that spent the time to collect the fingerbones.  Unless the person decides they don't want the loot and wants to roll or if it was previously decided to be randomed before hand.  <br>
<br>
     I think this would be a great motivator for ppl in the guild of all mid to upper lvl's since the loot seems to be rather nice for all lvl's.  Members in the lower lvl's can solo or group for fingerbones on the beach.  Little higher lvl's can kill in the docks and little higher lvl's can kill at the castle.  They can even make bigger groups or set up their own raids to gather the desired fingerbones for a shot at their own reward.  It is nice to have stuff given to you in time of need but there is more pride stowed upon things that are earned.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
     If this post confuses anyone I apologize.  Just find me in game and ask me and I will hopefully be able to answer your questions.  <br>
<br>
Later for now and see you all in game<br>

<br>
  OK let me try to explain the way to get to these places.. Im probally not the best at it. but here goes...  All places here are in the Guthak zone<br>
<br>
 The Beach ~ Cracked Finger Bones: this is the first place you come to when you leave the first isle (has the lighthouse) Lvl of mobs on the Beach lvl 35 to 45 or so.<br>
<br>
  The Tunnel ~ this is the tunnel that leads you to all other places.. it is located at the far end of the beach closer to the right hand side.  Mushrooms, Lizzard things, Plants, Troll Guards all spawn in tunnels.  *guess* lvl 40 to 50 ish mobs in tunnel ~most green and LB at 55.. some DB.  Invis works to get through them.<br>
<br>
  Town 1 ~ No bones drop here, but mobs grreen LB and some DB.  The town is the first LEFT when following the tunnel back.  Troll Guards, Priates of all types and Luggards spawn here.<br>
<br>
  Town 2 ~Broken Finger Bones: This town is the second Left in the tunnel.  Contains Guards, commoners, pirates, Luggards some green, some LB and some DB at 55.  If you come into the town and run straight back to zone wall (invised of course) you should come pretty close to an opening that leads to the Dulak zone.. there are 2 troll guards posted at the opening.  Pull to this spot if your after the Broken.<br>
<br>
  The Castle ~ Pristine Finger Bones: If you are at the Dulak zone  (mentioned above) put your back to the zone line and follow the zone wall to the Right .. stay on the wall and you will come to another opening.. this one Much bigger than the opening to Dulak zone.  A few trollies stand around the base of this.. follow it all the way up to reach the Castle.  THere are Trollies, Lizzard things and Mushrooms in the open area  (courtyard?) leading to the castle .. most green few LB to me.  When you reach the back end of the courtyard you will see the Castle...pull from the steps of the Castle to obtain your Pristine Finger Bones.. some LB some DB mobs on stairs.  They run fast when low on life.. so have root up.<br>
<br>
  The DarkElf NPC~ one who spawns waves: When in the tunnels go past town 1 and town 2.. do not take any turns.. after you pass town 2 you will come to a big bend in the tunnel.. bends to the left.. at the end of the bend you will see a fork in the tunnel... the Left fork will take you to the NPC.. he is standing by a torch and the tunnel dead ends in a cult'de sac (sp) ~ waves spawn in the dead end~  If youo take the Right fork in the tunnel you will go to the Nadox zone.<br>
<br>
  ** THIS IS FROM MEMORY~~PLEASE USE CAUTION**<br>
<br>
  Ok now for the waves...you turn in 4 finger bones of the same type to the NPC.  He spawns waves.<br>
<br>
  Cracked Finger Bones ~ lowest turn in.. spawns 5 mobs all at the same time .. they rush you.. All were LB at 55. There are 5 waves of mobs. time between waves **approx** 4 minutes.  Use a timer, all stand when close to time.<br>
<br>
  Broken Finger Bones~ mediun turn in.. spawns 5 to 7 mobs all at the same time upon turn in.. they rush you.. were LB/DB mix at 55.  There is 5 waves of 5 to 7 mobs.. timer is *approx** 4 mins .. time seemed to get shorter wave by wave. first was 4 mins 30 sec.. next was approx 4 mins.. ect.<br>
<br>
  Pristine Finger Bones~ hardest turn in...spawned 5 to 8 (maybe more) mobs ALL DB at 55.. they rushed me.. i died 45 secs later... next victim pls.. our group got wiped... Segester and Abonimible lasted the longest.. we got one killed .. maybe two .. the mobs continued to wipe out another group of ppl that were watching just as fast as they creamed us.  **note** we did not have a chanter/bard or we might have more info on this set <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )  This was the very first wave we attempted. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
  As we found out last night.. the Named Mob (only one will spawn pet turn in) can spawn in any of the 5 waves of mobs.. he spawns with the others.  We got a different drop when he spawned in the first wave then what we got when he spawned in the last wave.. so this *might* be what makes the drops different per Bones.  **is just a guess**<br>
<br>
  ** I WOULD NOT ATTEMP ANY OF THE WAVES WITH OUT AT LEAST ONE GROUP **  if your party dies in any of the waves the NPC despawns and so does the Mobs.. you lose the time spent collecting your bones, your Named Mob drop and of course exp.  Enchanters are a very welcome help in these fights as is a healer of course... Also best to have at least 2 melee types and if your group has mostly pet classes.. i would suggest having a back up healer for the pets and a healer for the group.  All the mobs can be mezzed/rooted/stunned.. there are caster mobs as well as melee mobs that spawn.  All mobs in waves are undead.<br>
<br>
  I have had TONS of fun doing these wave fights and the rewards for the turn ins are fairly decient in my own opinion.  Plus the Named Mob Drop is NOT no drop <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
  Hope I have managed to fry your brain with all the info <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   otherwise i probally left out soemthing :<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   As I stated befre though.. the DIRECTIONS I gave are from memory.

 <br>
 1) The lowest lvl waves seem doable with tank / anyone else if in mid 50s. Group of well balanced 40s could probably do this wave with no real difficulty. Just remember, all mobs are undead ans assist MT.<br>
2) Mid lvl waves are very doable with 4 or more mid 50s - tank / healer/ and just about anyone one else works ... ench is nice as are shaman / druid / necro. Full group makes this fun !! Good loot for alts from these fights.<br>
3) Hi end waves took us 2 full groups of mid 50s. Definitely want to good tanks or lots of pets classes with each group having a cleric. We also had an ench / bard type in each group which made it work better. One group got wiped out, so would say min is 2 grps, but depends on lvls of chars hehe. Best loot from this wave.<br>
<br>
 Now with all that said - who is up for more finger wave fights ?<br>
 It takes about 30 mins to do wave fights - 5 to 6 waves every 4 - 5 mins apart. Then NPC despawns and won't respawn for about 50 mins. <br>
 I have broken fingers for turn in, I know others have more to for turn in ..... Please post to here when would be good date / time and lets get this set up - nice loot for alts ...<br>
 I am available Friday / Sat / Sunday anytime - but would like advance notice of time if possible......<br>
