I wanted to put these here because I think that there are some good ideas in these sets of rules. It's also interesting to see how our ideas about love have changed with time (OK, so we don't exactly have the idea of courtly love around anymore, but still). Some of this is certainly outdated and probably not very useful, but some of it is still good advice; I'm sure you'll recognize which points are useful even today. Both lists apparently come from the same source, The Art of Courtly Love by Andreas Capellanus.<br>

The Twelve Chief Rules in Love<br>
From Courtly Love by Andreas Capellanus<br>
<br>
Thou shalt avoid avarice like the deadly pestilence and shalt embrace its opposite. <br>
<br>
Thou shalt keep thyself chaste for the sake of her whom thou lovest. <br>
<br>
Thou shalt not knowingly strive to break up a correct love affair that someone else is engaged in. <br>
<br>
Thou shalt not chose for thy love anyone whom a natural sense of shame forbids thee to marry. <br>
<br>
Be mindful completely to avoid falsehood. <br>
<br>
Thou shalt not have many who know of thy love affair. <br>
<br>
Being obedient in all things to the commands of ladies, thou shalt ever strive to ally thyself to the service of Love. <br>
<br>
In giving and receiving love's solaces let modesty be ever present. <br>
<br>
Thou shalt speak no evil. <br>
<br>
Thou shalt not be a revealer of love affairs. <br>
<br>
Thou shalt be in all things polite and courteous. <br>
<br>
In practising the solaces of love thou shalt not exceed the desires of thy lover. <br>
<br>
The Art of Courtly Love<br>
From Courtly Love by Andreas Capellanus<br>
<br>
Marriage is no real excuse for not loving. <br>
<br>
He who is jealous cannot love. <br>
<br>
No one can be bound by a double love. <br>
<br>
It is well known that love is always increasing or decreasing. <br>
<br>
That which a lover takes against the will of his beloved has no relish. <br>
<br>
Boys do not love until they reach the age of maturity. <br>
<br>
When one lover dies, a widowhood of two years is required of the survivor. <br>
<br>
No one should be deprived of love without the very best of reasons. <br>
<br>
No one can love unless he is propelled by the persuasion of love. <br>
<br>
Love is always a stranger in the home of avarice. <br>
<br>
It is not proper to love any woman whom one would be ashamed to seek to marry. <br>
<br>
A true lover does not desire to embrace in love anyone except his beloved. <br>
<br>
When made public love rarely endures. <br>
<br>
The easy attainment of love makes it of little value: difficulty of attainment makes it prized. <br>
<br>
Every lover regularly turns pale in the presence of his beloved. <br>
<br>
When a lover suddenly catches sight of his beloved his heart palpitates. <br>
<br>
A new love puts an old one to flight. <br>
<br>
Good character alone makes any man worthy of love. <br>
<br>
If love diminishes, it quickly fails and rarely revives. <br>
<br>
A man in love is always apprehensive. <br>
<br>
Real jealousy always increases the feeling of love. <br>
<br>
Jealousy increases when one suspects his beloved. <br>
<br>
He whom the thought of love vexes eats and sleeps very little. <br>
<br>
Every act of a lover ends in the thought of his beloved. <br>
<br>
A true lover considers nothing good except what he thinks will please his beloved. <br>
<br>
Love can deny nothing to love. <br>
<br>
A lover can never have enough of the solaces of his beloved. <br>
<br>
A slight presumption causes a lover to suspect his beloved. <br>
<br>
A man who is vexed by too much passion usually does not love. <br>
<br>
A true lover is constantly and without intermission possessed by the thought of his beloved. <br>
<br>
Nothing forbids one woman being loved by two men or one man by two women. <br>
