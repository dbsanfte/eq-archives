You can't have it both ways. This is the wrong place fo a discussion like this and I shouldn't have responded since all it does is cause me aggravation. It just bothers me that the Republican party constantly throws up any red herring it can find to keep from discussing real issues. Like that their &quot;tax cut&quot;, which is really an advance on the taxes you pay next year, is nothing more than a raid on the social security fund. However they spend enough money on commercials to dupe enough people into supporting them.<br>
 As far as the whole Clinton blowjob thing, it is none of your business what a person does in the bedroom unless they invite you in it. I think it is a crime against the constitution what the Ken Starr witch hunt did, and if Mr Clinton lied under oath, where are the charges? He has never been convicted of ANYTHING, however in the land where others want to be considered innocent till proven guilty, you would think the same rights would extend to the preisdent. If you want to point fingers and play a &quot;he did this&quot; game I can dig up as much shit on any of the last 3 Republican presidens to make Clinton look like a choir boy. Point is, when choosing a president I look to what they do in the boardroom and don't really care what they do in the bedroom. <p>Capodecima of La Mafia<BR>Gobsmaka Toofsmasha</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub57.ezboard.com/usteelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Steelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#939393>(8/30/01 2:33:25 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gobs (and anyone interested in Bushisms)</span><hr size=1> So what you're saying is forget Clinton's other actions and only care about how he did as president? Hmm let's see...you brought up the tax refund. Well boo hoo. I'm sorry Bush didn't have the luxury Clinton did by riding the republican wave of a thriving economy. Bush now has to try his best to get the economy back on it's feet and atleast he took that chance with the refund. I look back on the 8 years Clinton was President and i don't remember anything significant that the puppet did unless you count the lieing under oath ordeal. Why was there no charges for it? Hmm let's see. Well because maybe the fact that if they charge him with it, it will be an impeachment trial. That means the only thing he will lose is Presidency and he'll never spend a day in jail. So in reality it would only HURT the U.S. and the bastard was close to the end of his term anyways. And really why would they need to press charges. They had it on tape and showed it on TV. He already lost whatever dignity he ever had. <br>

Anyways, Bush might not take the humanitarian award this year, or hell ever, but i'd rather have him then Gore and apparently so did the majority of Americans.  <p><BIG><FONT COLOR=00FFFF>Steel <BR>

There is a HUGE difference what someone does today and what they did 20 years ago. If george bush got a Dui or did any coke while he was in office you better belive i would want him out of there. <br>
<br>
And why would you get aggrevated? I thought we were just having a discussion of opinions? You say this isnt the place, isnt that what message boards are for? to express opinions? Your point about the tax refund, now that is in the present and he does have alot of detractors for that move, i will give you that point, but its not like he made the decision and wrote the checks himself. <br>
