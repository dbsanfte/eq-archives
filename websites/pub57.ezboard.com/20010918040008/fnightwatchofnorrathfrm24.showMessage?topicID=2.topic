Quest originates with Tomekeeper Dahl, on the second floor within the Erudite Library. <br>
<br>
'Hail Tomekeeper Dahl'<br>
  Tomekeeper Danl says 'Good day, citizen. Please remember to keep<br>
  your voice down in our library. Feel free to browse the extensive<br>
  collection of books we have on display. Learning is all about you<br>
  and our library is the greatest collection of educational literature in<br>
  the world, as you can no doubt see. However, there are a few books<br>
  we do not own and we are prepared to pay well to acquire [rare finds]. <br>
'What rare finds?'<br>
  Tomekeeper Danl says 'Yes, any rare books, tomes, essays, or other<br>
  literature you find may be of interested to me. Although the finds<br>
  I am interested in are quite high profile and would most likely only<br>
  be found in the possession of very powerful or influential beings.<br>
  Give me what you have found and I will pay you what it is worth to us. <br>
<br>
The book he requires is called the book of Immortals, a book found in Skyfire. It drops from any of the following -<br>
'Soul Devourer' , 'lava walker' , 'Black Scar', 'a wandering wurm', 'a Shadow Drake', 'Guardian of Felia', or any other<br>
of the named mobs there. <br>
<br>
The following is the text from the book of Immortals:<br>
<br>
 The immortals who can be spoken of are not the Eternal Immortals.Their <br>
Spoken names are not the eternal names. In the namelessness they are<br>
the beginning of heaven and earth.Named they are one of the ten <br>
thousand things. Though different in title they spring from one source<br>
and appear as darkness Darkness within darkness. The gate to their mystery.<br>
The immortals do not go forth. All comes to them. They are like the ocean, the king of ten<br>
thousand streams. By staying beneath they are a receptacle for all things. They do nothing. Yet are masters of the<br>
universe. Trorsmang! Be our course of action. Anbeal! Become the Vessel to hold our virtue. Drina! Be our<br>
stability, where we can take root. Cordan! Fill our vessels and calm our ambitions. Norrath! Take our husks and<br>
breathe life into them. We beseech you! Guide us in your humility. <br>
<br>
Giving Tomekeeper Dahl the Book of Immortals, prompts the following:<br>
<br>
Tomekeeper Danl gasps at the sight of the rare book and says, 'This is a great find indeed! I can only imagine who<br>
you had to.. persuade to give you the book. Our library would be very interested in acquiring this and I am prepared<br>
to give you this platinum and a referral that marks you as a friend of the library. If only [Lheao] could see this.' <br>
   'Who is Lheao?' <br>
Tomekeeper Danl says 'Lheao was my predecessor here at the Library of Erudin. He has since retired, just a few years<br>
ago. I'm sure he would be most impressed with your find and offer insightful conversation on the subject. Although<br>
I'm not sure one of your profession would be interested in such a scholarly endeavor, no offense. If you are<br>
interested, find him and tell him you found the book 'Immortals.' I'm not sure where he has retired to, but I hear it<br>
is near an ocean somewhere. <br>
   He gives you a piece of paper, Danl's reference, which identifies as<br>
  'Paper with the Erudin Library Seal' <br>
Lheao is found in the Timerous Deep in the hidden oasis. The loc is approximately neg 11500, neg 2000, where<br>
you will run into a huge rock wall that is a huge ring of solid rock. There is an underwater tunnel, which goes under<br>
this wall, at approx neg 11357 neg 3657.<br>
Once through that tunnel, you surface and see another huge rock. This second huge rock has another tunnel, so<br>
you have to stay underwater, and find the tunnel that goes under it. This finally leads you to the hidden oasis, where<br>
you see the hut with the ramp and Lhaeo.<br>
   'Hail Lheao&quot;<br>
Lheao jumps at your voice and begins laughing at his skittishness<br>
He says, 'Ahh, hello there. Not many people know of this place,<br>
so visitors are quite rare. Hehehe. It's a very beautiful place indeed,<br>
so, ummm, please don't go telling everyone you know about it.<br>
Heheh. Thanks, friend.<br>
   'I have found the book Immortals' <br>
Lheao looks up at you, eyes wide in astonishment, and says, 'My<br>
god, you found 'Immortals'?! Where did you find it? Never mind,<br>
that is unimportant. I have in my possession a book that explains<br>
more about these individuals. Its value is unimaginable as well as<br>
the impact it is capable of. As you can see, I grow old. I need an<br>
individual to watch over this book and make sure it is protected.<br>
Would you be willing to [take this responsibility]?' <br>
  'I will take this responsibility'<br>
Lheao says 'I'm sorry, Kage , but I could only give this book to a true master, such as a member of the Whistling<br>
Fists Order. And unless you can give me proof that you are one, in addition to Danl's reference, which is very<br>
unlikely, there is no way I'll let you take charge of [the Celestial Fists]<br>
   'What Celestial Fists?'<br>
Lheao says 'The Celestial Fists is the title of a book written by an unknown author. His writing is sub par but the<br>
legend is interesting from a biographical standpoint alone. Its rarity commands top dollar in the scholarly<br>
community but the secrets revealed in the book are what truly makes it dangerous. I've thought many times to<br>
destroy it but just couldn't. I hope I'm able to find someone to watch over it soon. <br>
<br>
Once the Robe of the Whistling Fists and note (Dahl's reference) are handed in, the following is said.<br>
<br>
Lheao says 'Astonishing! To think that you are a master of an order thought to be lost to our world. Forgive my<br>
earlier doubts. I believe you are indeed worthy to be given the responsibility of watching over this book. Take great<br>
care that it does not fall into the wrong hands as it would be truly disastrous<br>
The book called Celestial Fists Book is illegible.<br>
       ~~The Kaiaren's~~<br>
The next step is someone called Kaiaren, who is located at Loc -1609, -2679, just as you come into the upper Sebilis<br>
Ruins in Trakanons Teeth. <br>
   'Hail Kaiaren'<br>
Kaiaren says, &quot; AHHH get it away from me go away .. leave me alone&quot;. <br>
   'What Celestial Fists' <br>
Kaiaren says 'Eh? What's that? Bah! That was destroyed long ago.<br>
Don't waste my time with fairy taAAAAAGGHHH GET IT<br>
AWAY!!!! HELP!!! They're all over MEHEHEHEHEEEEE<br>
 Handing Kaiaren the book Celestial Fists prompts:Kaiaren's eyes open wide and he attacks you!<br>
Upon death he says 'Not bad.. Now lets see if you can find my trueform if you do we discuss this further.'<br>
Note: You do not need to kill Kaiaren, as giving him the book and feigning him off works fine. <br>
Either way, you will recieve the Celestial Fists book back into your inventory.<br>
 The next step is to find Kaiaren's true form, which spawns when the book is given to the mad Kaiaren. He is also<br>
called Kaiaren, and is located near the lake in Trakanons Teeth. He spawns at approx 300, 2400 in a building next<br>
to the lake. He is level 60+ and indifferent. <br>
 When you hand him the book, he says the following:<br>
Kaiaren says 'Now, then. Where did you find this, monk? This is not just some light reading to be borrowed from<br>
the town library. Who gave this to you? <br>
   'I got it from lheao' <br>
Kaiaren says 'Hmmm, never heard of him. Well, it doesn't matter,<br>
the book is here now. Curse that idiot for writing it in the first<br>
place. Not even sure why I let him stick around. If you ever see<br>
that clown monk Aradiel kick him in the shins for me! At any<br>
rate, I suppose you'd like to find the Fists and [have a nice chat<br>
with them], eh? Their master owes me much. I would reward you<br>
well if you were to bring me proof of the master's defeat' <br>
   'I would like to have a nice chat with them' <br>
Kaiaren says 'Yes, I suppose you would. All you children looking for fame and glory will eventually learn the<br>
poison of ambition. But how will you find them? They are able to meld with their elements seamlessly and they<br>
certainly have no interest in fooling with the likes of you. No, you will need to get their attention. Fortunately, I<br>
know [how you can do this].<br>
   'how can I do this?' <br>
Kaiaren says, 'My guess is that the weakest of the Fists will be the easiest to draw out. he is egotistical and arrogant.<br>
How he came to master the Discipline of Fire, I do not know. He will most likely be in another form, one of his<br>
element. When you find the one you believe to be the Fist, you must challenge him. If you use his true name,<br>
Eejag, in your formal challenge, he will respond. A flame can burn intensely but it cannot last for long. Know this<br>
when you battle him.<br>
He hands you back the book, but it has now changed to the<br>
'Book of Celestial Fists' as shown.<br>
*Important Note: Now the Book has been returned to you, and as shown, it is NOT the same. The properties<br>
of this book have now been changed. Please DO NOT hand this book over again until the final stage, as he will<br>
expect the demon fang as well.<br>
      ~~The Celestial Fists~~<br>
           ~~Eejag~~<br>
In Lavastorm, there is an wandering Imp, larger than the others, called 'a fire Sprite'. The sprite looks to be pretty<br>
common and seems to travel from the druid ring to the southeast and back again. He is also a very low lvl imp. If<br>
Eejag is already spawned he won't shout to the zone when you say the challenge to the sprite. To initiate the<br>
sequence, hail the Fire Sprite with: <br>
   'I Challenge Eejag' <br>
The fire sprite disappears and the zone gets a message...<br>
Eejag shouts What imbecile dares challenges a Celestial Fist?! Do you<br>
even know who you are challenging? HA! You are nothing but an insect!<br>
I will enjoy crushing you, I have not charred the flesh of an idiot in <br>
decades! If you truly wish to fight me, the battle shall be held in my<br>
own element.Come, challenger, come down to the pits of flowing fire. <br>
 Now go to the fire pit by the Solesek's and under the middle smoke plume, half way down an Iksar will be<br>
swimming. He is lvl 55, max hits for 157, but seems to swing very slow. Eejag will NOT be pulled. He refuses to move<br>
from his spawn spot, which is about half way down the lava, right in the middle. When you get summoned, you<br>
appear on the bottom of the lake directly beneath him, where he can hit you, but you cant hit him. He can<br>
summon you regardless of if you are in the lava or not. Visibility is VERY bad.<br>
 Tactics: Min 2 Groups, and buff everyone with Dead Man Floating, Enduring Breath and Regen. One person goes<br>
down and gets the target then comes back up. Everyone charges in, including the Clerics, so they could do group<br>
heals, as the lava does not interrupt spells. Everyone then assists the person with target and find him via the /yell<br>
command.<br>
 Other tactics involve all floating above him, and sending the tanks and caster pets in, and popping back up to the<br>
surface to the Clerics for heals. <br>
 Once killed, he drops nothing but the Charred Scale, which Identifies <br>
as the Remains of the Fists of Fire.<br>
 Note: Eejag can be summoned again immediatly after death by challenging the Fire Sprite again, there is no<br>
'respawn time'.<br>
 You then hand the Charred Scale to the True Form in Trakanon's Teeth. The scale is returned to you, and you get<br>
the following: <br>
 Kaiaren says 'Ahhh, impressive indeed! Now that you have broken the chain of the Fists, the others may come<br>
toppling down if you persevere. The Fist of Air is now the weakest, then Earth, and finally Water before the master<br>
of them all, Vorash. You must defeat them in order, proving the demise of the last to draw out the one you are<br>
after. The task before you now is to take this scale and show it to the Fist of Air wherever he may be. Good luck,<br>
Zadkiel . <br>
       ~~Gwan~~<br>
 A presence, is found in the Plane of Sky, and is the Place Holder for the Fist of Air. The presence seems to have a<br>
respawn time of approx 2 hours. He has the model of a shadowed man, but carries no items, so is invisible apart from<br>
his name.<br>
 Note: The Charred Scale does not have to be cycled through Kaiaren's true form before being given to 'a presence',<br>
so this part can be skipped, but it is advisable to follow the story as intended.<br>
 If you travel to sky, rather than paying for the keys, kill the fairies, and have everyone loot a miniature sword. If you<br>
then kill the thunder spirit princess, she will spawn Sirran the lunatic. When everyone hands in the mini swords, you<br>
get a key of swords back. As with many guides on Sky, do not speak, (use /ooc instead) as if anyone says the key<br>
word [hassle] he will despawn. It is advisable not to buff people up until you are in sky, as zoning up removes all<br>
buffs. Now find the 'soapdish ashtray key platform thing' {Hotrod's term, not mine}, and drop the key on to<br>
use it, and it takes you to Dojorn isle, where the presence and Gwan are.<br>
 Hand the Presence the scale for the following:<br>
a presence says 'Hahaha! That dolt Eejag fell to the likes of you?<br>
I'm not surprised. So, I guess this means you're here to challenge<br>
me. Normally, I wouldn't waste my time, but since you've<br>
defeated my younger brother, I suppose I'm obligated. I'm ready<br>
when you are, tell me when you're [prepared]. <br>
 At this point the presence despawns and immediately respawns in<br>
the same location as a Human monk dressed in shiverback named<br>
Gwan. Telling him 'I am prepared' causes him to attack. <br>
 He doesn't respond to hails, and is lvl 57. He procs Fist of Air,<br>
which a lvl 57 resisted every proc with a MR of 120. He has approx<br>
14khp, (parsed by Sister Loani of Druzzil Ro) hits for 165, and the<br>
Fist of Air proc can knock you backwards, (possibly off the island)<br>
and like other mobs of this level, enrages.<br>
 Upon death, Gwan's corpse lets out one last, frustrated breath and <br>
gasps, 'Trunt! Prepare yourself!'<br>
 Tactics:The 'a presence' is on Dojorn's island, which also contains the bladestorms, but they have been confirmed<br>
that they will not attack and help, or KS Gwan.<br>
 You cannot trade with the presence (i.e. give him the scale from Eejag,) while it is in the windmill. It is best to give<br>
the scale to a presence, causing Gwan to spawn, then pull Gwan into the windmill and kill him. Pulling him is<br>
recommended to be done while in Melee range, i.e. WALKING backwards with him. Running off nearly always<br>
causes him to path incorrectly, and disappear to another island. It is highly recommended to pull him into<br>
the Windmill.<br>
 It is possible for 6 people to kill Gwan (although it is recommend to have more, the original group was high<br>
50's-60th lvl). Gwan is 100% MR, and only the lure line spells seem to hit him. He also required melee range for<br>
even Lure line to stick. <br>
 He drops nothing but the Breath of Gwan, which id's as Item<br>
Lore: Remains of the Fist of Air. <br>
 *Important Note: Do not hand the The Breath of Gwan to the true form of Kaiaren, as it will be eaten. The Breath<br>
is required for the next step, Trunt.<br>
     ~~Trunt~~ <br>
 Within the mines of Nurga, which is located in the Frontier Mountains, there is 'a sleeping Ogre', near a number of<br>
spiders not too far into the dungeon. A good marker is a unique graphic to this dungeon, which is a smoking hole<br>
in the wall, where you can see lava. When he is spawned he is looking right at that crevice in the wall. The Sleeping<br>
Ogres respawn time is approx 3 hours.<br>
 He is KOS, and he says nothing except some kind of sleeping message <br>
when you hail him while charmed. <br>
 Handing in the Breath of Gwan can be done in a few different ways.<br>
Either have invisibility cast upon you, then sneak behind him and hand<br>
in the Breath, or feign at his feet, wait for him to sit back down,and <br>
then sneak and stand to give in the Breath. <br>
 Either way gets this response:<br>
a sleeping ogre says 'Your path of wanton destruction ends here, Southern . Gwan and Eejag were impatient and<br>
hot-headed. You will not defeat me, for I have the patience and perseverance of stone, unlike the children you have<br>
beaten before me. Are you sure you want to challenge me, Southern? <br>
 When answering the Sleeping Ogre, Trunt, who is KOS, spawns.He is around 59th level Ogre, who double hits for<br>
around 176, and has approx 19k hp (again parsed by Sister Loani of Druzzil Ro), and is also immune to magic. He<br>
also attacks faster than the others. <br>
 Trunt has no faction, and says no message when he dies. He drops nothing <br>
but the Head.Trunts Head identifies as Remains of the fist of earth.<br>
      ~~Deep~~ <br>
 The next of the Celestial Fists is Deep. She is approx a level 58 Dark Elf, and lives under Lake Rathe, and is surrounded<br>
by Bloodgill Goblins. Her location is under the 3 Bird platform (the one with the flame on it)<br>
 When Trunts head is handed to her, she says the following.<br>
Deep slowly opens her eyes and looks up at you. She stares at you a long <br>
while and then closes her eyes and lowers her head again,saying, 'Very <br>
well, Arakos, if you wish death so greatly, we will behappy to oblige. <br>
My master projects part of himself in the wilder lands known as the <br>
Overthere. He has granted you an audience.Find him and show him the head <br>
of our earth brother. At that point, we will discuss how we will end your life. <br>
 No Experience is received and Deep despawns immediately. You get<br>
the Head of Trunt handed back.<br>
 *Note: Trunts Head does not have to be cycled through Deep, and this part can be skipped, but as mentioned above,<br>
it is advisable to follow the story as intended.<br>
     ~~Astral Projections~~<br>
 Moving on, we have the Astral Projections. There is one in the Overthere, and one in the Lake of Ill Omen, with the<br>
Overthere Astral Projection being the first of the two. He is approx 52nd level, and if fought was hitting for 175<br>
damage, and says nothing on death. His approximate location is 772, 860, neg 494, and is in the bottom of the<br>
scorpion chasm. He does not need to be fought.<br>
 Handing the Projection Trunts head, results in the following:<br>
Astral Projection looks up and down and says, 'Hmmm, I was hoping for <br>
something more impressive. This is just a small token of the last person <br>
who tried to interfere with my plans. He failed as you shall. But tell me <br>
truly, are you the one who has so rudely removed my students?'<br>
   'yes' <br>
 Astral Projection says 'I assume you have read about us and spoken with the old man, Kaiaren. Since that time, I have grown in power<br>
and influence to a point unseen by any mortal. Unfortunately, I will have <br>
to demonstrate a small amount of my skill when I destroy you. This is <br>
bad. I must decide whether you are worthy to see the techniques I wield, <br>
even though you will die shortly thereafter. Tell me, Ashana , who are you? <br>
   'I am the one' <br>
 Astral Projection chuckles and says, 'That's quite a boast, Ashana.<br>
All beings strive for nothingness at the most basic level of sentience. <br>
However, almost none ever achieve this. Not even I have discarded my ego yet and you stand here<br>
and tell me you have? Perhaps you will be a worthy opponent. I shall be waiting in the great lake near here. Take<br>
that token as proof of things to come for you. If you still wish to throw your life away so needlessly, return it to my<br>
image there. I await your decision.' <br>
 He will give you an Eye of Kaiaren, and then the Astral Projection despawns.<br>
 He is a 3 hour spawn. <br>
 It is not sure where in the text the Eye of Kaiaren is given, and it is only the final text (telling him that 'I am the<br>
one') that despawns the Projection. So it is possible to give in Trunts head, receive the eye and leave the AP without<br>
despawning him. <br>
*Note: As with the previous warnings, for the sake of someone else waiting 3 hours for the respawn, I would<br>
despawn the projection. There were (prior to a recent patch) chances that Deep would spawn in the LoIO alone,<br>
without Vorash, so anything to minimize that chance is helpful.<br>
   ~~The Final Fight~~<br>
 The second of the Astral Projections is in the Lake of Ill Omen, and is on a platform on the lake itself. The Platform<br>
is too high to climb onto, but SoW and Levitation can get you up there. He is identical in appearance to the other<br>
Projection.<br>
*Note: Another way to minimize the chances of Vorash and Deep not spawning together, is to have your groups<br>
on the edges of the platform, and hand the 'eye' in at the maximum distance allowed for trading. You can never be<br>
too careful.<br>
 When you give the Eye of Kaiaren to the Astral Projection, he despawns <br>
immediatly, and Deep and Vorash both spawn, who are KOS.<br>
 Deep procs Fist of Water, and hits for 170ish. Vorash procs Fist of <br>
Mastery, which is a DD and a stun, and hits for around the same as Deep.<br>
 Both Deep and Vorash have no items.<br>
 Once killed, Vorash says 'Foolish mortal! You think you have defeated <br>
me? Now, witness the true power of Rallos Zek! <br>
 Xenevorash will then spawn on the platform, regardless of where Vorash dies.<br>
 Xenovorash Procs Fist of Sentience which is a 500DD and a stun, and <br>
hits for 250 ish. Once he is killed, his death message is: <br>
 Xenevorash's corpse shouts 'Grraaaagghhhh!! NOT.. POSSIBLE! <br>
He drops a Demon's Fang.<br>
 Tactics: The final battle was originally done with 4 groups, which where all 52 to 58th level, one group was on<br>
Deep, all with high CR, and 3 groups where all on Vorash, with high MR. Due to the large amount of people<br>
involved, the fight was not bad, with no casualties. <br>
 Some groups pull Deep and Vorash to the 'beach', and this is normally done by a Bard or Druid with a faster than<br>
SoW song/spell, or the fight can be done on the platform. However, fighting on the beach does allow a brief time (I<br>
believe after 5 mins or so, he heads to the beach and slaughters all he sees) to rebuff for the Xenevorash fight.<br>
 Xenevorash always runs on low health, so if fighting on the platform, he will run into the water. <br>
 The Astral Projection respawns 3 hours after Xenevorash has been killed.<br>
   ~~The Celestial Fists~~ <br>
 Please remember that the book needed to be handed to the True Form first, for you to receive the<br>
quest information in the first place, (as in he prompts you to look for Eejag.) Once this (now<br>
different) book has been returned to you, it is now ready to be handed to Kaiaren along with the<br>
Fang. <br>
 Note: If you have followed the quest in order, you will end up with the book and the fang, and find that the 'True'<br>
Kairen is no longer about. If you have done it the 'proper' way, you can hand the book and fang to the 'mad'<br>
version and still get the Fists. Most people however, now that the quest has been completed, will fight the four fists<br>
to get the fang, THEN hand over the Robe to Lheao. This way, the first time you see the True Kaiaren, you can<br>
hand the 'Book of Celestial Fists' to him along with the fang to obtain the Fists.<br>
 Handing either form of Kaiaren (Mad or True) the Book and the Fang, results in the Celestial Fists being handed<br>
over, with the following text.<br>
 Kaiaren bows his head and breathes a long sigh as if relived of a great weight. He then looks up at you and says, 'I<br>
honestly did not believe you could have defeated Vorash. Even though he sought nothing but war and bloodshed, it<br>
is a life nonetheless and we must mourn him. I will sew these fangs into magical fist wraps and they shall be yours.<br>
Remember Xenevorash. A purpose can be found for every situation and individual. To achieve perfection is to<br>
perceive this truth.' <br>
<br>
 The Effect Celestial Tranquility is a right clickable 40%<br>
Song haste, +12 AC and +40 Att. Its duration is 9 seconds.<br>
 They also change the Damage/Delay of both of<br>
your fists to 9/16, not including any Haste you may already have.<br>
                 Haste Item -------    Haste Total-------             Damage Delay of Fists<br>
 None -------                               0 -------                   9 dmg 16 dly<br>
  Right Click Effect of Celestial Fists-------   40%-------       9 dmg 13 dly <br>
 With right click + FBSS-------                  61%-------           9 dmg 11 dly <br>
  With right click + CoF-------                      76%-------           9 dmg 10 dly <br>
 Max Item + Max Enchanter Haste-------             85%-------          9 dmg 9 dly <br>
<br>
<br>
Because of the Songs 9 second duration, it is recommended to customize a hotkey with the Flying<br>
Kick skill, so that you will know when to refresh it.<br>
<br>
The Particle effect does not show if weapons are wielded, but a 2HB weapon will show the effect in the off hand.<br>
