<br>
Jacko (Gabriel) is my brother in RL and I think I should give you guys a little bit info on his background (it's gonna be long):<br>
<br>
Jacko had ALWAYS been the smartest guy in the family. He was a Ph.D. graduate in Applied Physics in Stanford. He co-founded a fiber optics company in Silicon Valley with his professor and schoolmate back in 1998.  While he was at his peak of his career, he was diagnosed with a grade 4 glioblastoma multiforme (the most badass kind of brain cancer) in Nov 2000. Jacko refused to accept the sentence passed by the doctors. He actively sought out and researched on clinical trials and made sure he was getting the best possible treatment available.  He has had 3 brain surgeries since then.  He had tried gazillion types of chemotherapy and suffered the side effects of them.  For the past year or so, the WHOLE left side of his body was immobilized and yet he never complained.  As a matter of fact, I have never ever heard him complained even once since he got the disease. Even with his left side disabled, he STILL wanted to play EQ, he said he had SO MANY friends there and he cherished each one of you.  He's such a control freak that he always wanted to control stuff, kill UBER mobs, explore new zones etc (even in a disabled manner).  I believe he shared his personal and intimate stuff to you guys even more than he did to his own family. I envy you guys so much in that sense.<br>
<br>
After 2 years of illness as a brain cancer patient, God finally set him free and called his soul back to heaven.  He peacefully passed away on Aug 29, 2002 at the age of 31.  He knew that death was coming, but he refused to go down without a fight.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I want to thank all of you (his friends) for taking care of him for the past 2 years while he's suffering. He's privileged have friends such as you guys (especially Sylvaron, Silvia, Baraniel etc) that offered such genuine friendship to him.  I am eternally grateful for all the care and support that he has gotten from you guys. He treasured his friends so much and I am sure each one of you meant so much to him.  <br>
<br>
Sorry for all his AFKs in the game! I know he liked to go AFK for 2 hrs or more, but sometimes he just had sudden headaches and he couldn't help it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
It never ceases to amaze me that Jacko has so many true friends even in EQ. He's so loved anywhere he went. I am damn proud of you as a brother.  I miss you so dearly.  I love you so much my brother.  <br>
<br>
I will see you again soon. Rest in peace. :*(<br>
<br>
Love,<br>
Aurrak (Kevin)<br>
<br>
P.S.  I will be putting a copy of EQ inside his casket, so don't be surprised to see him online one day. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub57.ezboard.com/uvashanbramblenutts.showPublicProfile?language=EN>VashanBramblenutts</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Capo de Capo</span><br>  Posts: 906<br> <font color=#333333>(8/31/02 1:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub57.ezboard.com/feqmafiafrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=508.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Jacko</span><hr size=1> Dont know what to say <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Cant find words, He was a great person, great player and will be forever miss. I wish I had more time to talk to him and exp with him.<br>

<br>
I'm really bad at saying things like this... <br>
Its almost as if I don't even have a right to say anything...<br>
<br>
Words, at least to me, are far less potent than what I feel most often.  But on this medium we all share, words are all I have.<br>
<br>
I owe it to at least express the utmost, whole-hearted, and genuine respect for anyone who would appreciate life, and friendship as much as Jacko did.  The time that he lived, and shared with everyone who plays this &quot;game&quot;, is more a gift than I can even fathom. Close consort or even in general happenstance, giving us his time when it was so limited, is amazingly noble.  And if anything else, for that I salute your bravery.<br>
<br>
Like most, I didn't know him IRL... but it hardly matters as compasion, influence, and sincerity are not passed through physical means, but rather actions of the heart.<br>
<br>
My deepest condolences are all I can give, and the assurance that although I've never met him personally, I'm sure he'll be rewarded for the choices hes made, and the life hes lived.<br>
<br>
Enjoy your peace Jacko, you've earned it ten-fold.<br>
<br>

I am so sorry that Jacko passed away. He will be truely missed by so many of us. I will never forget him. <br>
I always enjoyed grouping with him during the HoS days. He showed and taught me a lot about the arena in Kael. He was very patient, yet precise when he was explaining to me what to do. And I had lots of questions too. <br>
God be with you Sensei Jacko. You will not be forgotten.<br>
