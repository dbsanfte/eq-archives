Compiled from diffrent forums and log files by : Golan Trevize -- Cazic Thule Shaman of Justice<br>
PART I - TEST OF PATIENCE <br>
 1. Go to Gornit's island in OOT, approx. loc 800, -5400, kill Capt Surestout (green con at level 54, one ebolt <br>
kills him). A lesser spirit will spawn where he's killed, hail the spirit. Capt Surestout died. <br>
 Your faction standing with PiratesOfGunthak got worse. Your faction standing with FirionaVie got better <br>
 Capt Surestout says 'You have run me through! Beware the Pirates of Gunthak.. They will avenge me.. Unngh!! <br>
 a lesser spirit begins to cast a spell. a lesser spirit's body pulses with energy. <br>
 a lesser spirit regards you indifferently -- You could probably win this fight. <br>
 You say, 'hail a lesser spirit' <br>
 a lesser spirit says 'Did you take this person's life, shaman? <br>
 You say, 'yes' <br>
 a lesser spirit says 'Why have you taken this person's life, Waring ? Did he threaten your life? Did you <br>
dislike him? Or was his death a profit to you in some way? <br>
 You say, 'he threatened my life' <br>
 a lesser spirit says 'I see. It brings me sadness to see another die, but his heart was black and a great <br>
nothingness. His body will become  the grass now. Thank you for what you have done, shaman. <br>
 You say, 'who are you?' <br>
 a lesser spirit says 'What, or who, I am isn't as important as what, or who, WE are. Do you wish to know <br>
more, shaman? <br>
 You say, 'i wish to know more' <br>
 a lesser spirit says 'That is good, Waring . Take this gem. It is a part of us like the clouds to the sky <br>
and is a wonderful gift from the grandfather. Take this gem to where the humans gather to spoil the land <br>
and water. Some call it a port. There you will find one of us, a shaman like yourself. Give him the gem and <br>
perhaps he will tell you more of the spirits. <br>
  2. Head to North Freeport. Go in the sewers in the northwestern part of town, a little ways in on the <br>
inside of a colapsed wall is Bondl Felligan. Give the gem to him. <br>
 You say, 'hail Bondl Felligan' <br>
 Bondl Felligan burps loudly in your face and says, 'Bah! Leave me be, fool! You have nothin' I want and I <br>
certainly have nothin'you want.' Give the tiny gem to Bondl <br>
 Bondl Felligan says 'WOW, thanks! This must be worth a fortune! I could drink for a month after sellin' this <br>
to one of them fool merchants. I'm going to see how much I can get for it right now! <br>
 Your faction standing with TrueSpirit got better <br>
 You gain party experience!! <br>
 *NOTE: After giving him the gem once, simply going up to him and saying &quot;you can buy booze&quot; at anytime will <br>
cause the spirit to spawn in the room. No need to travel back to OOT. <br>
 Next wait for him to move, follow him back out of the sewers onto the land outside, there he will stop and <br>
speak to you. <br>
 Bondl Felligan says 'What!? You don't approve of me buyin' some drinks with this gem? Who the heck are you <br>
to offer me a gift and order me what to do with it? Is this some kinda conditional kindness? Well? Are you <br>
gonna let me buy some booze with this or not? <br>
 You say, 'you can buy booze' <br>
 Bondl Felligan suddenly becomes completely sober and says, 'Very well, shaman, please come with me.' <br>
 After this you can follow him to the Jade Uncerground Inn or just go there yourself. Head up to the third <br>
floor, middle room and go inside. There you'll find a greater spirit waiting. <br>
 You say, 'hail a greater spirit' <br>
 a greater spirit says 'Greetings, shaman. Tell me, do you follow [Justice], [War], [Fear], or [Hate]? <br>
 You say, 'i follow justice' <br>
 a greater spirit says 'Ah, a follower of the Tribunal from the North you are, then. You would be best served <br>
by speaking to my brother in the next room. Farewell, Waring . <br>
 Go to the room next door at the end of the hall. <br>
 You say, 'hail a greater spirit' <br>
 a greater spirit says 'It is good to see you, Waring . We're glad you trusted in our brother and did what <br>
was asked regardless of Bondl's intentions. This fills us with joy, as the [true spirits] work in ways <br>
most people would not understand and [trust] is the first lesson of the [Heyokah]. <br>
 You say, 'what true spirits?' <br>
 a greater spirit says 'As a shaman, spirits are known to you. They aid you if you pay them homage and respect <br>
the world around you. They also will bend to your will if you are powerful enough. We are a part of the entire <br>
universe and we exist because people believe and feel us. However [very few] know us in this form. To mortals <br>
we are but ideas, [wisps ofconsciousness] in an expanse of emptiness and as difficult to grasp as breath in <br>
Everfrost. <br>
 You say, 'what very few?' <br>
 a greater spirit says 'There are only a handful of mortals we've judged worthy to be friends and, reluctantly, <br>
masters. We call them the [Heyokah]. Bondl is one of them and he helps to test those we believe might be able <br>
to grasp our existence. There aremany troubles that threaten us and our home. We seek those with the wisdom, <br>
patience, and might to help us ensure the health of the cosmos. Whether you seek balance or personal power, <br>
this is important to you. <br>
 You say, 'what wisps of consciousness?' <br>
 a greater spirit says 'It is difficult for mortals to grasp what we are for we are not material that can be <br>
held or consumed. We are the spirit that drives beings to do what beings do. The wolf lives to run and hunt. <br>
When you ask for his aid, his spirit enters your body and you 'become' wolf. The ox is the personification of <br>
endurance and when he enters your body, you do not become an ox, you become all that is ox. I myself am the<br>
spirit of understanding. <br>
 You say, 'what trust do you speak of?' <br>
 a greater spirit says 'Trust is the glue of the universe. When one trusts others to do their part, it <br>
allows them to focus on what they must do themselves. The trust that others have in us also gives us the <br>
confidence to do our parts effectively, thus maintaining harmony. When one becomes dissatisfied with his <br>
part and pursues his own desires, this is called greed. And greed destroys the glue of the universe. This <br>
is why we wished the bandits under the grass. <br>
 You say, 'what heyokah?' <br>
 a greater spirit says 'The Heyokah are our mortal counterparts. Some are our friends who seek to help us <br>
in whatever goals we deem important. Some seek nothing more than to enslave and command us to do their <br>
bidding. We accept this and often make deals with those we realize are powerful enough to accomplish what <br>
needs to be done. To judge such individuals, we have prepared a test. We ask that before we enter into these <br>
contracts, the shaman walk the [path of the Heyokah]. We see you may be worthy. Will you walk the path? You <br>
will be rewarded for your efforts, albeit grudgingly. <br>
 Recieve the opaque gem from the greater spirit <br>
 *Note: DO NOT say the following line until you receive the gem by saying the above line. The next line will <br>
cause him to immediately despawn but will start the next quest for you. <br>
 You say, 'I will walk the path of the Heyokah' <br>
 a greater spirit says 'That is good, Waring . You will need to walk three paths before you can reach that of <br>
the Heyokah. The paths of patience, wisdom, and might. First, you must learn patience. Take this gem and go on <br>
a pilgrimage to an island in the great water the wasichu call Erud's Crossing. The Kerrans there are our allies <br>
and can show you to our next contact, Ooglyn. Give Ooglyn the gem and do what she asks. As you walk the path, <br>
remember what you've learned about trust. <br>
 3. Head to Erud's Crossing. Find Ooglyn, a female ogre shaman, on the island. Approx. loc -900, 1600. She <br>
should be up, if not her spawn time is 2 hours. Give her the gem. <br>
 *NOTE: As of now this quest is bugged. Before handing in the gem go to loc 0,0 in Erud's Crossing, if you see <br>
a naked human female floating above the water with no name then you NEED a gm to come and despawn her. <br>
Otherwise the quest npcs will not spawn and you'll have wasted that effort. <br>
 You say, 'hail Ooglyn' <br>
 Ooglyn says 'Ooooh, it you, Waring. Me's been waitin for you cuz our frenz say you comin an need da test.So's <br>
I gib you da test. Hmm, now where me put it? Ooglyn been waiting for sign for so long dat me forget where me <br>
put test. Keep your eyes out for sign while me look for test. Oh, hey, Waring , they gib you gem? I need dat <br>
gem, please, heheh. Give the opaque gem to Ooglyn  <br>
 Ooglyn says 'Ahhh, tank you, now me can...OH LOOK!! DA SIGN!!!! Oh, sorry you missed it. The sign show you <br>
where to wait for da test. Follow me...I like you so I take you there. We goin for a swim, Waring ! <br>
 Your faction standing with TrueSpirit got better. You gain party experience!! <br>
 Ooglyn begins to cast a spell.  Ooglyn feels much faster. Ooglyn begins to cast a spell.  Ooglyn is surrounded <br>
by a brief lupine aura. Ooglyn begins to cast a spell.  Ooglyn's body pulses with energy. <br>
 Then she starts to run away, follow her until she disappears into the water. Then go in the water (make sure <br>
you have some sort of underwater breathing on) and head to loc -1600, 2400. She'll be waiting there for you in <br>
the water. Wait down there with her. <br>
 Ooglyn says 'Ok shaman, let us be off. <br>
 Ooglyn says 'Ok, here Is place for you to for waiting. Hab fun shaman! <br>
 She then wanders away. DONT follow her, be patient ! NPC`s will start spawning one after the other. <br>
 You say, 'hail Srafen the Soaked' <br>
 Srafen the Soaked says 'Why hello there! Ahh, it's good to see a new face down [here]. So you've come to <br>
[wait] with [us] eh? That is splendid! It's been getting very boring lately. <br>
 You say, 'Where is here?' <br>
 Srafen the Soaked says 'Oh! Well this is where [we wait]. It's not much for looks but if you're lucky, a <br>
pretty fish will swim by. Oh, and once Dillon said he saw one of those fish women, a mermaid, he called it! <br>
Although, I'm not so sure of his state of mind, hehehe. He's been waiting here much longer than I. <br>
 You say, 'Who is us?' <br>
 Srafen the Soaked says 'Well, there's me, Srafen. I've been down here for, can't quite remember, a number of <br>
years, I guess. If my wife saw the condition my clothes are in, she'd whack me, I'm sure, heheh. Although I'd <br>
bet she's long since dead, probably. Then there's Dillon. He says he's been here since those people up top in <br>
Erud blew that big hole in the ground. Not sure what happened but I guess it was a long time ago. Hmmmm, who <br>
[else]? <br>
 You say, 'What do you wait for?' <br>
 Srafen the Soaked says 'We've been waiting quite some time, really. I have been here the least amount of time, <br>
but that doesn't help keep the boredom away, heheh. What are we waiting for, you ask? HehehHAahahah! What are <br>
we waiting for??Heheheh, what a silly question! It's quite obvious if you take the time to think about it.Heh. <br>
Ummm.. I'm really not sure. <br>
 You say, 'Who else?' <br>
 Srafen the Soaked says 'Ahh, yes, there's also a really old guy I've only seen a couple times, name's Froham. <br>
Whew, he is really old, and not much of a talker. Mostly mumbles from time to time. Dillon says he's been here <br>
since Erud first took his people across the sea. Not sure who this Erud feller is but Froham isn't in the best <br>
of shape, so it must have been a LONG time ago. Froham did mention there's one other guy but we've never seen <br>
him. He apparently had something to do with the CombineEmpire, no idea what that is though. <br>
 These 2 NPC`s Spawn at the same time and are speaking to each other as well <br>
 Dillon the Drowned says 'Well met again, Srafen. How goes it? <br>
 You say, 'hail Dillon the Drowned' <br>
 Dillon the Drowned says 'Hey Srafen, who is this weirdo talking to me? Or is it another one of those funny <br>
illusions Froham keeps talking about? <br>
 Srafen the Soaked looks around frantically a moment then laughs and says, 'Ohhh, them! Hehehe! This is a <br>
friend of mine come to wait with us. Isn't that exciting, Dillon? And it's not just an illusion, I don't think! <br>
Say, are you [an illusion], shaman? <br>
 You say, 'I am not an illusion.' <br>
 Srafen the Soaked says 'Awww, well that's too bad. Although illusions and real people don't seem to be much <br>
different at times, so, please stay and keep Dillon and me company. We could use it, right Dillon? <br>
 Srafen the Soaked says 'Hey Dillon, why don't you tell us again about what happened up top? You know, where <br>
they blew that big hole into the ground. <br>
 Dillon the Drowned says 'Again? Oh I don't know Srafen, I don't want to [bore] our company, even if it is an <br>
illusion. <br>
 You say, 'You won't bore me' <br>
 Dillon the Drowned says 'Well ok, I was sent here a long time ago to wait. When I got here, I couldn't believe <br>
all the violence going on. Why would the spirits send me here to wait when all this fighting and commotion was <br>
going on, I wondered. There were great battles on the ocean in splendid ships made of pine and shining with <br>
[magical enhancements]. While I was waiting below, blasted, bloody body parts were floating down to the bottom <br>
of the ocean all around me. <br>
 You say, 'What magical enhancements?' <br>
 Dillon the Drowned says 'Yes, their ships were very strange, constructed in very unusual designs and all <br>
seemed to shine with a multicolored glow. I heard there was even a ship that could stay completely underwater <br>
for long periods of time. It had huge steel spikes protruding from the top of its hull used to 'swim' under <br>
enemy ships and puncture their hulls. I always thought that someday all this magic would cause something <br>
[disastrous] and eventually, it did. <br>
 You say, 'What was disastrous?' <br>
 Dillon the Drowned says 'Well, one time, I was here waiting as usual. The fighting was particularly heavy up <br>
top, lots of banging and rumbling around. And suddenly there was a tremendous screech! I had to cover my ears, <br>
it was so loud, even down here. It felt like the water itself was being torn asunder; I could imagine what was <br>
happening above. After a few seconds of the screeching came a terrible tremor and rumbling. Great cracks opened <br>
up around me and water rushed to fill them, almost dragging me down into the gods know what. It calmed down a <br>
little while after that and there hasn't been any real fighting eversince. I suspect they're all dead now. For <br>
weeks afterwards, the water had a kind of dead taste to it. I became ill during that time. <br>
 At this point Froham the Forgotten comes in… <br>
 (…) Missing logs <br>
 You say, 'who is abe' <br>
 Froham the Forgotten says 'Yeah, Abe's an old guy. Well, he's kinda beyond bein' old if ye know what I mean. <br>
Not all together either. His mind floats all over like the sea around us. But he's got enough sense to wait <br>
here like he's done fer, well,fer dang near ever. If ye see him, and he ain't much fer talkin straight, ask him <br>
about [a broken arrow]. Not sure what it means to him but it seems to bring him around. <br>
 *Note : The skeleton swiming in the water named Froham the Forgotten, will wander off talking about a mermaid <br>
and a treasure DONT follow him its a test. Dont be greedy is the test Few minutes later another NPC will spawn. <br>
 You say, 'hail Abe the Abandoned' <br>
 Abe the Abandoned turns his head slowly toward you but his eyes never come into focus. You can't tell if he's <br>
looking at you,behind you, or right in front of his own face. Then ,suddenly, he shouts at the top of his lungs<br>
'HOOOOKAAAHEEEEYYYY!I AM [ABE]!' <br>
 You say, 'who are you abe?' <br>
 Abe the Abandoned says 'Nothing is hidden. All is discernible if you only know where to look and you have the <br>
right [eyes].Don't be angry with me if you can't get your eyes right to see what you're looking for. I'd lend <br>
you mine but I don't wear the same size. <br>
 You say, 'what eyes?' <br>
 Abe the Abandoned begins to draw a picture in the mud with his finger although it doesn't seem to make any <br>
sense at all. He points to his picture and nods approvingly at you, saying, 'You see? The curtains fell and it <br>
was naught but a dream upon a landscape that we thought we knew. The dream of the [Combine] fulfilled when we <br>
finally trimmed our fingernails and looked into the mud. And now we are abandoned, in a world that none can <br>
see, no one has the eyes.' <br>
 You say, 'what is the combine?' <br>
 Abe the Abandoned shakes his head in amusement and says, 'Heheheh, yeah, you'd think so, wouldn't you? But I <br>
guess not' <br>
 You say, 'what broken arrow' <br>
 Abe the Abandoned 's eyes suddenly come into focus, looking deep into your own and says, 'There was a time <br>
when we cared for the world and trod with the spirits along the paths of the cosmos.We built many great things <br>
and worked to preserve whatwas. I came here to wait for an answer when we began to die off.We could not figure <br>
why this was and I was chosen to come here and commune with our friends. We carved an arrow, and everyone who <br>
was left shaved a sliver of wood from it. We let it drop to hallowed ground and our highest shamanstepped on <br>
it, breaking it. I've been waiting here for so long. So, so long, to give it to the spirits, and thank them.' <br>
 Sit down there for a few more minutes, then Abe will talk. <br>
 Abe the Abandoned says 'Shaman? My time will soon be at hand and I fear I will never see our friends again. <br>
But the arrow must be given, our holy broken arrow. Shaman, will you bear our obligation and [give them the <br>
arrow]? You will know who to give it to when it is time. <br>
 You say, 'i will give them the arrow' <br>
 Abe the Abandoned removes a quiver slung across his shoulder and solemnly hands it to you without a word. <br>
 Recieve a Broken Arrow from Abe <br>
 Wait again.Couple minutes later... <br>
 Abe the Abandoned suddenly gasps and says, 'I have found it! I know the answer! Come with me and I will tell <br>
you. Eyes are everywhere and this knowledeg is not for everyone. Finally my centuries of waiting are over <br>
hahahaha! Follow me Shaman! <br>
 Stay glued to that spot, don't follow him. The Greater Spirit is on the way with a shiny gem for you. <br>
 a greater spirit begins to cast a spell. <br>
 a greater spirit's body pulses with energy. <br>
 You say, 'hail a greater spirit' <br>
 a greater spirit says 'You have walked the path of patience and you now know what to expect. We are watchers. <br>
Our eyes are everywhere and we must be patient and quiet else we may miss what could be harmful. Can you sit <br>
still quietly and wait for just the right moment, then open your eyes with a fury and act with all the energy <br>
you have cultivated? Timing is everything, and without patience you cannot be sensitive to timing. You have <br>
shown your patience here and we believe you are ready to walk the [next path]. <br>
 You say, 'what is the next path?' <br>
 a greater spirit says 'You know trust and patience. But before we can allow you to act in our name, we must <br>
know that when you do decide to act, you will make the right choices. We must ask that you now walk the path <br>
of wisdom. You must walk to the great plains and search out one of us. He is a wanderer, and it is his nature <br>
to drift with the winds and weather doing what he can to ensure understanding and longevity to all that <br>
respect their home. He will not be easy to find, though, and you must remember what you have learned down here <br>
to succeed in finding him. When you do, give him this gem and follow his instructions. <br>
 PART II - TEST OF WISDOM <br>
 4. Head to West Karana. Look for a wandering spirit (looks like a wisp). Not sure where it roams, just keep <br>
calling out you're looking for it or bring a tracker. When you find it, give it the sparkling gem. <br>
 You say, 'hail a wandering spirit' <br>
 a wandering spirit stops and flashes brightly for a moment. It seems to be regarding you with interest. <br>
 Hand the gem u recieved in Erud`s Crossing to the wandering spirit <br>
 a wandering spirit says 'Oh, it is you, shaman! Good! You must hurry before it's too late. Go now to the <br>
Mountains they call Rathe and find them! They need your help quickly! They will know you when they see you <br>
and instruct you on how you can help, but you must hurry! <br>
 Your faction standing with TrueSpirit got betterYou gain experience!! <br>
 5. Head to Rathe Mountains. You'll find Tabien the Goodly at loc ( 6300, 1550 ) near the Unkempt Preservers <br>
area next to a stone engraved with a closed eye symbol on it. Approx level 35. <br>
 You say, 'hail Tabien the Goodly' <br>
 Tabien the Goodly says 'Oh thank Marr you are here, Waring . I was beginning to think I would be abandoned in <br>
my time of need. I have a [task] for you to complete in the name of my patron Mithaniel Marr. <br>
 You say, 'what task?' <br>
 Tabien the Goodly display his shield that must once have been shining and regal but is now scoured in cuts, <br>
dents, and chipped paint. He says, 'This shield is known as Marr's Promise. It is a sacred relic that was <br>
actually used by one of Mithaniel's angels on the Plane of Valor. Its value to our church is immeasurable and <br>
I have been charged with the protection of it. However, a patriarch of the false god, Bertoxxulous, is after <br>
my shield and me. He must be stopped! Please, destroy him and bring me proof of his death. <br>
 Kill the fool and get his shield <br>

 The other one is Glaron the Wicked, his loc is ( 2900, -1900 ) Approx level 35. <br>
 You say, 'hail Glaron the Wicked' <br>
 Glaron the Wicked says 'Are you the one they sent to help our cause? I should have known they would send a <br>
green witch doctor to serve Bertoxxulous and myself. Very well, you will have to suffice. I have a [task] you <br>
must fulfill if you wish to know the blessing of my god and impress your masters. <br>
 You say, 'what task?' <br>
 Glaron the Wicked brandishes a long, wicked-looking bone dagger and there is a horrid, diseased stench as <br>
soon as he unsheathes it. He draws another blade, shorter and wider than the first, of blackened bone with a <br>
larger than normal hilt,obviously for defense. He says, 'This festering blade is called Woe, and this scorched <br>
one is called Envy. They were created on the Plane of Decay by Bertoxxulous' own hands. He has judged me <br>
worthy of the protection of such holy relics.However,there is one in these very mountains who seeks to destroy <br>
these relics. End this idiot follower of Marr's life and bring me proof.'<br>

 a wandering spirit says 'You are close to passing the test, keep up the good work. <br>
 a wandering spirit says 'Waring nods somberly and takes the items. After a moment, he says, 'It is <br>
unfortunate that it came to this, but nothing else was to be done. Both paragons had lost sight of their <br>
virtures to protect the items given to them. The mere protection of these material belongings was not as <br>
important to Mithaniel Marr or Bertoxulous as it was that they act with righteousness in their minds and <br>
purpose in their hearts. You saw this and acted accordingly. For that, we will reward you with the three <br>
treasures made into one to ward off the falsehood of possession, the [Shield of Falsehood]. You have walked <br>
the path and now, as your final test, we must set you along one [last path]. <br>
 Your faction standing with TrueSpirit got better.You gain experience!! <br>
 You say, 'what shield of falsehood?' <br>
 a wandering spirit says 'Yes, I have taken Marr's Promise along with Woe and Envy and fashioned them together <br>
to create the Shield of Falsehood. Wield this in defense of possession and the weakness that comes with <br>
hoarding treasure instead of using it to accomplish your goals. May it serve you well, Barbarian. <br>

be patient and await the right moment. And now, you have learned the wisdom to act in our best interest.<br>
However, one last path awaits, to determine if you have the ability to act out what must be done. There are <br>
many troubles about the world we try to rub out but none is more serious than the curse on what the wasichu <br>
call the Emerald Jungle. Go there and find one of our spirits. Show them the gem you have been given and <br>

 PART III --- TEST OF MIGHT<br>
 7. Head to loc ( 1250, 300 ) in Emerald Jungle. There you'll find the Sentinel Spirit inside a hut like <br>
building. <br>
 You say, 'hail a Spirit Sentinel' <br>
 Give him the sparkling gem you received from the wandering spirit. <br>
 Spirit Sentinel says 'Ahh, you live, shaman! I am glad the beasts of this jungle haven't torn your body <br>
asunder. Tell me, do you still walk the path? Are you willing to [continue what you have started]? <br>
 Your faction standing with TrueSpirit got better <br>
 You say, 'I will continue what i have started' <br>
 Spirit Sentinel says 'This brings happiness to our hearts and we are grateful. <br>
 However, we must ask you to walk one more path before you can become a true Heyokah.With trust, one can focus <br>
on what is important. With patience, one can perceive what is harmful. With wisdom, one can know what must be <br>
done. These, you have learned, yet without the might to carry out what must be done, all is for naught. Are <br>
you [prepared to walk the path ofmight]? <br>
 You say, 'I am prepared to walk the path of might'<br>
 Spirit Sentinel says 'Good, good, Do you know this place, Waring , this forest? The wasichu call it the <br>
Emerald Jungle, but we know it only as the terrible place. Where there is no spirituality, we are weak. The <br>
lost city in the middle of this jungle is a great void of belief not only absent of spirituality, but actually <br>
draining it from others. We are here to neutralize that void. The void is like the sky, and nothing escapes <br>
its gaze. If it senses us,it will drain us away and sometimes it turns our minds,making us [like the wasichu], <br>
crazy for things with no meaning. <br>
 You say, 'what like the wasichu?' <br>
 Spirit Sentinel says 'Yes, there are some of us who have turned their backs on our world and struggle for <br>
possesions and power over others. These lost ones are our brothers and we cry for them. Our hearts are in pain <br>
like bleeding wounds when we think of them. The path of might will lead you to one of our lost brothers. We <br>
are afraid there is nothing we can do for him now,so you must eliminate him when you [find him]. <br>
 You say, 'how do i find him?' <br>
 Spirit Sentinel says 'He left us long ago and walked the land for ages. He soon met a man, one of the pointy-<br>
ears that live underground. This man was like a void just liike the one over that terrible place now. Our <br>
Brother-Friend was attracted to this man's desire and ambition. He no doubt thought that he could get what he <br>
wanted in service of this [dark point ear] who denied his own creator. <br>
 You say, 'what dark point ear?' <br>
 Spirit Sentinel says 'After our brother began traveling with this point-ear, they became shrouded in a <br>
darkness we could not peer through. The point-ear was a powerful being and we soon lost their trail. We have <br>
no idea where he could be now.Although, after all these centuries, he has no doubt been gathering and <br>
cultivating his wealth and power. He must be an incredibly influential being at this point. Find this point-<br>
ear and draw our brother out, then destroy him and bring us proof. We await your return in somber mourning. <br>
 8. Go in Mistmoore Castle… There is a Dire wolf in MM ( spawn time is 4 hours OR a triggered Spawn : Kill the <br>
Advisor in the castle`s Library area and it will spawn the wolf NOTE : He despawns after 35 min or so ) it is <br>
by the ramp leading up to the castle but you don't go up ramp instead head all the way back at base of ramp <br>
you will see 4 wolfs and a dire wolf in the middle ( You can pull him solo at level 57+ ) . In order to get a <br>
responce from the wolf you have to be Warmly in con. He is truespirit faction. the you walk up to him and hail <br>

 You say, 'hail a Spirit Sentinel' <br>
 Give the spirit the pelt you recieved from the Black Dire in MistMoore <br>
 Spirit Sentinel begins to weep softly as he sees the pelt, battered and bloody. After a few moments, he says, <br>
'We can only hope his passing was quick and painless. The Dire was powerful and yet you overcame him. Always <br>
remember that when you became [Heyokah], it was the passing of a noble, yet misguided being that allowed you <br>
to do so. You should hold a special place in your heart for him and what he was in life. To help you remember <br>
him, we will fashion this pelt into a pair of boots and<br>
give them to you. With every step you take, you must think on the Dire, else his death be in vain forever.' <br>

now call to you as Heyokah Eliha . From now on, you are a direct link between the spirits and man. Whether your goals are to<br>

forest? To eyes not trained to see beyond physical appearances, it seems like any other forest. But you know, as do we, of the<br>
mantle over the city threatening all of us. We must [rub it out]. <br>
<br>
You say, 'how do we rub it out' <br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'There are many such mantles scarring the universe and each is very different from the last. Removing them<br>
requires that we learn how they were created and go about reversing the damage done. We cannot enter under the mantle for<br>
long which is why we search out Heyokah such as yourself. We need you to enter the city and find out what you can about the<br>
[city's demise]. We hope you will do this for the cause of balance but if you desire none but your own power, we shall grant<br>
that as well <br>
<br>
You say, 'what about the city's demise?' <br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'It was known as Torsis. During its history it amassed great wealth and power yet it eventually crumbled.<br>
No one understands what happened. The men of the world ask themselves how a nation as successful as Torsis could ever fall.<br>
Some blame plague, internal unrest, the constant encroachment of the forest, and marauding bands of monsters but we alone<br>
know what happened. Just as Tabien and Glaron lost sight of their spiritual paths, so did Torsis. Without the awe and<br>
inspiration of that which was greater than themselves, they eventually withered away. The mantle was born long before the last<br>

I heard last night that there was some kind of commotion at the castle. Guards were shouting, spells went off throughout the<br>
halls and many died. Some say there was an assassination, some say a band of froglocks attacked under the command of a<br>
dragon, some even say there was divine intervention. I have no idea why any god would strike against Lord Rak'Ashiir. He is<br>
the paragon for the cause of Cazic-thule. I hope whatever it was sticks to attacking the castle and not my shop though. <br>
<br>

Hear all Torsis! Our beloved Lord Rak'Ashiir will be appointing another High Priest into the Cazic-Thule clergy in two days. A<br>
festival will be held in honor of the event and the High Scale will be present to judge various contests of skill in arms. Booths<br>
will be set up selling various wares and food to all. Cazic guide us all. <br>

The list should all be in order except for the swatches of silk. I won't need such a large order in this quarter. Her Divinity Drian<br>
made it known to me that they would not need as many new robes this coming season as &quot;none were quite ready to don them.&quot;<br>
My colleagues have all been confirming that the church is buying less and less these days. It seems Rak`Ashiir has decided the<br>
royal donation to be cut. However I'm sure we'll find new customers soon and our orders will be back to normal shortly. <br>

Hear all Torsis! It is with great regret that we inform you of our Queen, Neh'Ashiir's disappearance.  Our best scouts have<br>
begun searching the surrounding countries for her trail. The lord Rak'Ashiir also authorized the hire of mercenaries to venture<br>
into Froglock Territories to search for traces of the Queen. All interested parties should report to the royal Quartermaster's<br>
office. Fear not citizens, our Queen will be found. Wisdom guide us. <br>

<br>
Well it appears our Lord Rak'Ashiir in his &quot;wisdom&quot; has cut our church's donation yet again. He claims it is to bolster the ranks<br>
of our garrison as many were wiped out during the Froglock incursions. However, I see more and more soldiers everyday,<br>
more that I ever have. And they are all equipped in the best armors the city's smiths can craft. This along with the recent<br>
replacement of our Bishop Screks with that coin grubber biliaz leads me to suspect our King is planning on all but destroying<br>
the church entirely. I don't understand it, perhaps his missing Queen has driven him mad. <br>

Missed mass again today. This is the third time this week now. It is a worthy sacrifice however as I was able to attend the<br>
Master's National Coin exchange class. Perhaps the clergy will change the time of their masses, then I'll be able to attend<br>
regulary. Although with the appointment of the new Arch Priest it appears mass may be discontinued altogether. I honestly<br>
hope so. I could attend many more classes as well as spend more time rubbing elbows with merchants at the bazaars. I think I'll<br>
have to miss tomorrow's mass as well. I heard the Laughing Leech Guild is taking members again. <br>

Spirit Sentinel says 'Ahhh good, let us hope what you have found will point us in the right direction. Hmmm...this is interesting. It<br>
appears the disappearance of the first queen may have caused Rak'Ashiir's faith to decline. From there, the first King Rak laid<br>
down the groundwork for the city's eventual demise. We need to learn what happened to the queen. Perhaps bringing this<br>
knowledge to the King's now cursed form will lift the mantle. We've learned that the last lord of Torsis, Ghiosk, was a bit of a<br>
historian. Find him and see what you can learn about the queen. Take what you find to my brother here In the jungle beneath<br>

<br>
He drops : <br>
_____________________________________________ <br>
<br>
Book 1 -- Historic Article, it identifies as &quot;A Book From Ghiosk's Collection&quot; <br>
<br>
Neh Ashiir's disappearance will always be cloaked in mystery. We of Torsis have a saying that goes &quot;Neh`s chances&quot;. We all<br>
know this is used to define an innumerable variable but not many know of its relation to the event in the early years of our fair<br>
city. For as many people as there were in Torsis there were that many theories regarding Ne Ashiir's disappearance. Others<br>
say there were political tensions between the queen and her lord, so much so that she had to leave to escape death. And for<br>
good measure a few pointed to the stars and said that people from beyond the sky took her. One thing all agreed upon<br>
however is that the relationship between the royal couple was decaying. Political scrutinizers noted small personal habits<br>
between the two implied a separation of intimacy during their public appearances. Many even tie the highly publicized Crusade<br>
of Kim into the disappearance of Neh as Kim left the city only a few weeks before. It is recorded in many texts that the visage<br>
of Rak`Ashiir reflected his dispair over his wife's vanishing although it is a well know fact that it was mostly an act played by the<br>
King to keep up his illusion of nobility. Perhaps one day we will find the truth but at this point it would mean little to the public. <br>
<br>
Book 2 -- Head Housekeeper's Log, identifies as &quot;A book From Ghiosk's Collection&quot; <br>
<br>
1. New wash basis must be aquired. Servant Hujin will see the Quartermaster and place the order tomorrow. <br>
2. The chandelier in the main hall was finaly repaired tonight. Payment must be sent to the to the contract holder tomorrow. <br>
3. Advisor Snith ordered that I personal find and acquire 3 dozen finely made vials. What they are for he would not explain and<br>
was very firm that I do this as quickly as possible. Best to make haste to fulfill the order, rumors abound of the Advisor's<br>
mastery of the arcane. <br>
4. We've been low on candles for the last week. There is no explanation for the shortage of wax says our civilian contract<br>
holder. Perhaps I should send a Palace Reaver escort with the next pick up crew. The craftsman may have the intelligence to<br>
figure the symbolism. <br>
5. It is imperative that we return the High Scale's Icon to the church as discretely as possible. If Rak Ashiir returns from his<br>
journey early and discovers it was found in the royal bedroom it may prove disastrous. I cannot decide whether to place it<br>
ourselves with help of our Black Guard, or to approach one of our contacts in the church. The less people that know of this<br>
better. It might be prudent to ..remove.. the servant who found it within the sheets. <br>
<br>
Book 3 -- Crusades of the High Scales, identifies as &quot;A Book from Ghiosk's Collection&quot; <br>
<br>
Throughout the history of the High Scale it was common for the knights to practice complete celibacy. It wasn't until the<br>
controversial Kim was given the hallowed title that contact between sexes became tolerated. While Kim wasn't the mightiest of<br>
the High Scales he was able to achieve many great victories in the name of our Lord of Fear. One being the battle know as the<br>
Bone Rending when Kim lost his fabled whip. Thriaxis' Tail, and was still able to defeat scores of his enemies using his hands<br>
only. Before this battle many believed Kim could not fulfill his duties as a leader and patriot for the people. However Kim's<br>
might and his lecture on the use of females in religious crusade and duty convinced the puclic that celibacy had its place in<br>
divinity but non-celibacy also had a place and value within the church. A shrine depicting Kim among many women was<br>
constructed in remembrance of his controversial reign although his corpse was never brought back for burial as it was lost far<br>
across the ocean among distant brothers in faith <br>

<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Hmmm, it appears the queen's disappearance wasn't as random as we thought. It also looks as if this High<br>
Scale were having some sort of affair with Neh. We have little but speculation at this point, so making it known to Nak'Ashiir<br>
would do nothing. Perhaps finding the resting place of the High Scale will show us more of what really happened. We suspect<br>
the icon mentioned in this log could now be located in the city's old temple. Find the icon and bring it to Kirn, wherever he is.<br>

12. The return to City of Mist <br>
<br>
NOTE : To save a trip to CoM I suggest looting the icon while collecting the report pages… <br>
<br>
à Go loot the Icon of High Scale on the floor <br>
<br>
From the zone in, walk across the bridge and open the gate. Turn right at the statue, run straight forward through 2 arches. You<br>
are in a temple part of the city ( on your left you should see a door and some waterfalls on the side of temple ) That is the base<br>
camp. Pull all the mobs from behind that door you see at the base of the temple. Inside is another door directly in front of you,<br>
do not open this door, it leads to the top levels of temple. Look to your right, there should be 3 skeletons and some phantoms (<br>
or there should have been :P ) Walk down the stairs. There are two doors beside the stairs, one opening to the left and one<br>
opening to the right. Choose the left door. Inside is a small room with no monsters inside, and a small bag on the floor in the left<br>
corner. Loot and run Click on the bag, congratulations, you now have the High Scale Icon. <br>
  <br>
<br>
There were no rogue-locked doors between the zone and the High Scale icon. And I suggest doing a suicide run… get in get<br>
out ( but use a map before ! ) <br>
  <br>
<br>
13. THE FINAL STEPS <br>
<br>
High Scale Kirn is to be found in the Hole. at the revenant castle at the top end of the tower. He is pretty obvious once you get<br>
to the top of the tower as he stands in the middle of the room in front of you. Kirn spawns in the dead city crypt, in a tower<br>
way down. <br>
<br>
NOTE : Get a ball of golem clay from the clay golem in Cazic Thule, and use the charge of earth elemental illusion. Then<br>
everything in the hole will be amiable-warmly unless you've spent a LOT of time there. <br>
<br>
à Give the icon to High Scale Kirn he said : <br>
<br>
High Scale Kirn looks down at the icon in his hands for a long moment before speaking. 'Why did you bring me this? Are you<br>
here to accuse me of the queen's death?' High Scale Kirn chuckles venomously and continues, 'I am High Scale and beyond<br>
your petty laws. However, I wish the truth to be known. On my hand is a ring. If you can take it from me, show it to the queen<br>
and she will remember. However, I will not give up the ring easily. <br>

Cazic-Thule. His wife and the High Scale then abandoned him in disgust, but even that was an aftereffect of what caused the<br>
king to turn his back on his faith. The child is the key! If we put the child to rest, Nak may repent of what he has done and the<br>
mantle may be lifted. The most difficult task is now at hand. Find the child, then take proof of her passing to Nak. I can feel the<br>

daughter and vanished to only he knew where. When I regained control of my body and thoughts, I felt nothing but [betrayal]<br>
and I immediately set out to abandon Cazic-Thule.' <br>

<br>
Lord Rak`Ashiir stands dumbfounded for many moments before finally speaking again, 'Kirn was right. Before he left my side<br>
and that of Torsis he told me I would have the blood of my own people upon my hands. How could I be so foolish? Even my<br>
idiot wife could see the truth. How could I begin to fathom the depth of a god's mind and the reasons for his actions? Kirn's<br>
prophecy has come to light. You have shown me the truth and now I have no more use for this. Take it away from me, please,<br>
and do with it what you will. My father was as much a fool as I have been. <br>

Emerald Jungle Last chapter <br>
<br>
à Give the scale to the EJ spirit... <br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'What is this? The scale of Rak'Ashiir's father? Then Rak has repented his mistake? But why is the mantle<br>
still in place? If Rak has repented, then the mantle should have dissolved since he was the one who initiated its construction. But<br>
is its initiation the key? How could we have been so blind? Kirn said Rak'Ashiir had the blood of his people on his hands but<br>
that is false. Rak merely pointed to a path that would lead them to destruction. It was the people who chose to follow <br>
<br>
You say, 'What is lost' <br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'The mantle was the product of thousands of faithless individuals. Not the single shroud we believed existed.<br>
Torsis is now truly cursed for all eternity as a great stain upon the universe. Today is a sad day, indeed. However, some good<br>
can still come of this. Your sacrifice and spiritual devotion in this matter have become legendary. You have waited for us at the<br>
bottom of the ocean. You have rubbed out a mighty rogue spirit. You have endured the black hole of Torsis and entered the a<br>
bode of Fear itself to save a child from eternal suffering. It is only fitting that we reward you with our greatest treasure, the<br>
[Spear of Fate]. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What of the Spear of Fate' <br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'The spear was constructed millennia ago by Thalger, the first human Heyokah. One of the most destructive<br>
wasichu of Norrath, Miragul, as he is known, had been traveling the world searching out all known magic. Wherever he went,<br>
he discovered and experimented with all forms of dangerous magic. Most of the world cannot even fathom what the Arch<br>
Necromancer was capable of. He had haphazardly discovered a way to directly create a mantle of negative spiritual energy<br>
similar to what curses Torsis. He himself had willed into existence one of these [black holes]. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What of thease Black Holes' <br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Miragul often retreated to the frigid northlands to experiment in solitude. It was here that he created a black<br>
hole. Unfortunately for the small tribes of men who made the northlands their home, this new black hole threatened not only<br>
their livelihood but their entire existence. The mantle was so powerful it not only drained the spiritual energy of everything within<br>
its gaze, it also drained the life force as well. The tribes were threatened with complete annihilation. But one [powerful shaman]<br>
stepped forward and struck against Miragul's mantle. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What powerful shaman?' <br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Thalger had been the first to pass our tests and the timing was lucky indeed. We supplied him with materials<br>
needed to construct a weapon that could pierce the very fabric of the [cosmos]. First, was the sharpened shoulder blade of an<br>
ancient lion matriarch. Then Thalger found a young sapling for the shaft and shaped it over the course of 45 days using nothing<br>
but his fingernails. He then split the top of the flexible shaft, lodged the blade into place and bound them together with the<br>
tanned entrails of an ox. Finally, he adorned the spear with the magical feathers of a an aviak elder. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What of the cosmos?' <br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Miragul's casting was strong but it was a force brought into existence. This force was positive in nature, the<br>
opposite of nothingness. Even though it worked like a void, it was still created by an imposition of will. We figured that if we<br>
could rupture the planar boundary and create enough anti-existence or non-matter, the mantle might destroy itself. Thalger<br>
volunteered immediately to pierce the mantle as no spirits could even get close to it. In one act of devotion and singular<br>
purpose, Thalger rode the wind far above the land and with one colossal arch ripped a [breach] across the planes. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What of the breach?' <br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'The tear in the fabric of existence created enough negative material to cancel out Miragul's abomination.<br>
Thalger's strike was so perfect that he cut just enough planar material to destroy the mantle and nothing else. Unfortunately,<br>
Thalger himself was lost in the process. All that was left was the spear that fell from the heavens to the ground where we<br>
recovered it. We have kept it since then and now we wish you to have it. When you strike with it, you must have the same<br>
singularity of purpose as did Thalger when he defeated Miragul's mantle. <br>
<br>
Thank you, Heyokah Golan. <br>
