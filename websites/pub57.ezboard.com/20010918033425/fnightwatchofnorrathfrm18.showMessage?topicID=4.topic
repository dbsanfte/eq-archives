As I remember, the last time I updated this thing was when I was lvl 23 and bumbling around in Highkeep fighting pickclaws.<br>
<br>
Since then, I discovered a wonderful place to hunt - Everfrost.  There's a temple that holds 4 &quot;Icy Orcs&quot; that are around lvl 25-27, plus an NPC necromancer orc (yeah, a necro orc, go fig) named Redwind.  Anyway, it's pretty easy to get a group there if you have some patience.  But the best part is the exp.  I went from halfway to 24 to lvl 25 in three days fighting them.  If I was smart, I'd have stayed there and hunted them until I was lvl 30.  But, I'm impatient.  I wandered all over the place when I hit lvl 25, I tried Highkeep, Unrest, even Ill Omen way down in Kunark.  So here it is, I've got a bub and a half of exp into lvl 25 and it's 2 weeks later.<br>
<br>
I HATE those drachnids in Firiona.  One of them jumped me while I was heading from Ill Omen to the dock, I had to zone back to Ill Omen.  I made it with 23 hp left and a DOT on me.  I still can't believe I survived that.  The really annoying part was that Ill Omen, now that I've found out how to reduce the lag (minimize the clip plane) gives me next to no exp.  There went about 4 days of my valuable time.<br>
<br>
Sometimes I think I like playing Ieros (my lvl 10 warrior alt) better.  Until I have to sit around waiting for my HP to slowly regen, that is.  But at least he can go toe to toe with things that don't con green.<br>
<br>
And finally a short update to the &quot;killed&quot; list.<br>
<br>
An icy orc (both magic user and warrior variations)<br>
Redwind<br>
<br>
Until next time...<br>

Chamois is also 25 seasons young now, shammies are great.<br>
<br>
I think from my experience Osrik it would be ideal for both of you to team up, I went from lvl 15 to lvl 50 in the almost continuous company of a shaman, The warrior/shaman combo is great for most fights and always welcome in groups.<br>
I always found it easy to attract other members to group whenever required).<br>
<br>
Good luck both of you but dont forget Chamois and Gam and Loves alts are also 25 ish and would be great if we all got together)<br>

<br>
Lvl 25 nearly made me give up on Everquest. I spent all my time running back and forth between Everfrost and Highkeep, rarely getting groups in either place. And in Highkeep, the exp was dismal. It was frustrating and I basically spent all my time &quot;e-fedding&quot;. (E-feds are pro-wrestling related entertainment. If your a fan you probably know all about them and if your not you wouldn't care).<br>
<br>
Well, I finally got out of my slump. I went to South Karana and hunted the Tesch Mas Gnolls. The exp was mediocre at best, and it took me a week, but at least I could always get a group. Literally people would fight over me. After constand rejection in Everfrost/Highkeep it sure was sweet =) and of course the yelp-burp noises the gnolls make rule. Had to turn down a treant group as I don't want bad faction with the druids. I also, while hunting there, got nailed by a cyclops. I was hightailing it for the zone when I realize my groups attacking the thing. So I turned around and nuked the living hell out of it. And not only did my group destroy the thing, but I struck the killing blow. No cyclops toes though, but oh well.<br>
<br>
Lvl 26 - I went to Lagnark (aka Kunark). Well, on my way, I had a run in with Kizdean Gix. I saw him conning green, I'm like, OK, I know he's an undercon, but I can take him. I nuke him, it hits for full 141 dmg. He then nukes me for 171 dmg. I start to go at it with him, but he's dual hitting me for 26. Then I run in a confused circle for a little while while he knocks me down to two blocks. It took me another block of life to get Spirit of Cheetah up, but I got it and escaped to the zone. When I return to West Commons (when I'm lvl 30) Gix is going to be DEAD.<br>
<br>
Anyway, once I got to Lagnark I bumbled around trying to get a group and solo in Lagoverthere. Chamois, you must have been lucky, because I never once got grouped while I was in that zone. I studied various EQ websites for soloing strats. Finally I decided to test it out by soloing in the lower level part of Lagoverthere. I tried it on &quot;a kunark rhino&quot;. No one told me the stupid thing could outrun SOW... well, it was green, so I was able to stand nose to nose with it and bludgeon it to death with my mace.<br>
<br>
So then I went to Lagtier Mountains. The first thing I noticed is &quot;Wow, those mountain giants look exactly like my uncle!&quot;. Second was &quot;Oh $***, everything cons red!&quot;. But then I got to the giant fort and started getting grouped. Exp went up like crazy, I whupped lvl 26. I haven't gotten a forest loop yet though.<br>
<br>
The one day I didn't get a group in Frontier, I went back to the Lake of Lag Omen. I fought on the top ledge of the Sarnak fort. I didn't get inside the thing myself, but our puller was dragging sarnaks out of the fort itself. We took down a high lvl &quot;sarnak revenant&quot;, and although the exp wasn't as good there, it was a fun group.<br>
<br>
Alchemy can wait till I'm lvl 30, although someone beat me to SOW potions, dang blast it. But the best part is - I'm officially addicted with Everquest again.<br>
<br>
And, duh dududaaah! The Killed List!<br>
<br>
a kunark rhino<br>
A sarnak dragoon<br>
A sarnak legionarre<br>
A sarnak revenant (and its pet)<br>
a burynai digmaster<br>
a goblin whipcracker (I think it was a whipcracker anyway)<br>
A ravenous brute (again, I think it was ravenous, might have been something else)<br>
a mountain giant hillock<br>
a mountain giant tump<br>

<br>
I have a whopping 1 MOB to add to the killed list<br>
<br>
Mountain giant craig.<br>
<br>
I was in a good group and we took the thing out good. He resisted all my spells, but not my mace to his kneecap =).<br>
<br>
But enough about that. There was an officer meeting yesterday (Saturday 5/19/01). I had to get from Frontier Mtns to Freeport, right? Now if you've read my old posts, you know how much I hate drachnids. And anyway, if I go through Firiona Vie, I have to take two boats. Much, MUCH easier to just take the boat from Overthere, right? <br>
<br>
WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG<br>
<br>
Did I mention it was wrong? OK. I get on the Bloated Belly, no problems. Then, just as it's about to leave, &quot;Dragoon V'Lask slashes YOU for 137 dmg&quot;. I said to myself &quot;crud&quot; and got as far away from the dock as I could before the guy killed me.<br>
<br>
I tried to get to the Overthere Zone by wall-walking. I ran face first into &quot;a goblin warrior&quot; and was lucky to gate out alive. I guess it ran very slow or something, but as I appeared at my bind spot, it said &quot;Goblin Warrior hits YOU for 60 dmg&quot;. Somehow he stuck his fist through my gate and nailed me I guess. Not fun.<br>
<br>
This time, a dark elf caster type decided to escort me. He started to take me to the Overthere zone when a mountain giant tump aggroed on me. He nuked it and it turned on him. I'm not sure what he did with it, but something or other. Then he got me to the FM/OT zone.<br>
<br>
Gamthorr was right there in Overthere, and he offered to rez me. That went fine. I got inviz vs undead from him and followed his instructions out to the boat. Everything is going fine until...<br>
<br>
&quot;Dragoon V'Lask slashes YOU for 137 dmg&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, the same Dragoon V'Lask who mauled me earlier. Things go from bad to worse. This time, my corpse is right by the dock, there's no way I could try to get it. Gam, being the nice guy he is, says &quot;hold on, I'll rez you again.&quot; So I consent him to drag the corpse. But, apparently, the corpse was glitched. Gam could stand right on top of it and the game would say &quot;The corpse is too far away to summon&quot;.<br>
<br>
I gave up on EQ and went out. I didn't get back on until later that evening. This time, the corpse had vanished. I talked to a GM, he didn't understand what was going on at first, but when I explained, he dropped the corpse on the Overthere side of the FM/OT zone and rezzed me, I think completely instead of 50%. I went linkdead zoning after the rez, of course, that's just the way stuff happens. Anyway, I log back on, loot the corpse and I gate back to my bind spot, FM side of the FM/Ill Omen zone. I cross Ill Omen, that's easy, things don't really aggro on me much there, except for the rare skelly. Even then I can outrun them to the zone or get someone to back me up and smash it to bits. <br>
<br>
Now I'm in Firiona Vie. It's morning, so there shouldn't be many drachnids up, right? And there aren't. OK, lets walk down the wall. That always works. Now, I'm in front of the ruins that lead to some zone or other, I climb a hillock and... 3 drachnids in the way. I start to go around them, but now there's a drachnid out in the forest straight ahead of me. So I turn back... there's a drachnid behind me. I make my way carefully around it and keep heading back... oh great, more drachnids. On both sides of me now, and they're coming in from the side too. I back higher and higher up the zone wall, looking for a break. The drachnids stop advancing on me, but there's more and more spawning. One of them gets the &quot;walk straight glitch and passes so close to me that I can see its eyes. That was enough for me - I gated back to FM. I didn't want to be pulled down by drachnids after all the crap I already went through.<br>
<br>
Back in FM I beg for a port. But I only have 2 plat on me, and my money is on the far side of Firiona Vie in the bank. So I turn to the guild. One person offers to port me (sorry, can't remember the name), but I have to go to the Dreadlands for it. I found the zone for the Dreadlands by falling off the side of a mountain for 163 damage into the tunnel that leads to them. No MOBs in the tunnel though, everything's just fine. I get to Dreadlands. It was snowing - that always helps me feel better. I wait for the port and get to watch some highbies take down a Drolvarg. Then the port comes, I make it to the officers meeting and so ends my bad hair day. Oh well, at least Aniar didn't make fun of me for having the polar bear head as a hat again, :-D<br>
<br>
I'm not sure how much exp I lost during the whole ordeal, but I'd estimate the damages at somewhere just under one orange bub. Big pain, but if not for Gamthorr and a kind GM, it could have been much, MUCH worse.<br>
<br>
Next time your EQ character has a terrible, miserable, worthless day, just remember... it could be worse. You could be me.<br>
<br>
As a side note, Gamthorr thinks that Dragoon V'Lask was glitched.  He was swimming in place just past the edge of the dock.  I don't know if that's what happened, I never saw the guy, but it would make sense.  At lvl 14 I believe I took the boat to and from Overthere in complete safety.<br>

<br>
Well, I did walk around in Runnyeye a little bit.  I met some green conning gobbies.  Actually, they were &quot;could pose a problem, but you could probably defeat it&quot; cons... so why were they hitting me for 60+ damage?  I couldn't find groupage there and gave up on it.<br>
<br>
So then I went to Highkeep.  It's been a few levels since I was in there, and there's a bunch of new spawns.  Also I now get some good faction hits as well as the Pickclaw Goblins Down faction.  Also there's a few new spawning locations... like one where the &quot;safe area&quot; in the lookout room used to be.  I went there, got aggroed and caused a train.  Fortunately no one got hurt and the people were understanding.  Anyway, a bit later I got to group in the raider room - that was awesome exp.  After that, though, I had to fight in the warrior room.  Since the raiders are so strong there's frequently not even a group hunting them, and the one time there wass one, the group leader said I was too low lvl.  Grr...<br>
<br>
A few nights ago, I got in a really good warrior room group.  We had 3 warriors and 2 caster types (I think seer and cabilist) attack us and we took them down with no real trouble.  Instead of my usual 1 1/2 hours of playin, I stayed on until I hit lvl 29, I think around 5.  It was really awesome.<br>
<br>
Last night I went to Splitpaw with a bunch guildmates (all of whom conned red to me).  The raid itself unfortunately didn't go well, as we had a couple of deaths by means of going linkdead.  I did pretty well though, I got a splitpaw hide belt (small save vs poison buff and some other buff, I think CHA) and the griffene downfeather for my totemic armor quest.  That really does rule, because since I already have ghoul carrion I now have everything I need (except the dufrenite and that can be bought) for one of the totemic armor pieces!  I think its the boots, not sure though.  So I'll do that later.<br>
<br>
As a side note, I was in WK and saw Tremor of the Isenguard guild fighting two cyclopses named Choon and Froon who conned yellow to me.  I'd guess they were both lvl 30 and Tremor was in his late 30's.  He probably didn't need my help, but I stayed and made sure that he won.  He can't have been too much higher than me, it took two greater healings to send him to nearly full health.  And I've wanted to see those Cyclopses eat it ever since one of them chased me across the zone when I was a semi-newbie.<br>
<br>
I finally found that Queen Klicnik that I'd been hoping to kill for several months.  If you've been reading my posts since I started you might remember me hating that bug.  Well, I got her.  Considering she was less than half my lvl that probably wasn't anything special, but still, I'm happy.<br>
<br>
I also made a few potions.  My skill isn't high enough to make SOW potions yet, but it'll get there.<br>
<br>
And our friend the killed list.<br>
<br>
