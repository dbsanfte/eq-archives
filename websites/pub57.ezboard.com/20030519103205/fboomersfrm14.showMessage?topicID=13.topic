About 2 weeks ago, I was looking around the Web for the BIGGEST sky rocket that I could get shipped to me via common freight carrier. I located a fireworks importer in Wisconsin who had this mondo sky rocket--biggest thing I had ever seen--called a SkyDragon. These things are 48 inches tall and are mounted on a 1/2-inch wooden dowel. Pure aerospace engineering. I plopped down a bunch of money and had him send me two cases of these things. They arrived at the freight dock a few days ago and I had to drive the van over to pick them up. Two boxes each 2 feet by 2 feet by 4 feet in size containing 80 rockets each. The 'Class 4 Explosives' sticker on the side of each box was a real bonus. I am gonna have to save them for the scrapbook.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
That night, me and the kiddos had a gen-u-ine rocket launch ceremony. I placed one of these beauties in a liter-size glass bottle and the bottle fell over.<br>
<br>
Hmmmm- this thing was waaay too big. I looked around the shop for a pipe to set it in, but realized that the only dirt I could drive the pipe into was in plain sight of my neighbor's house. I knew he was a cool guy, but I didn't want him to call the cops. You see- 'projectile-type' fireworks are totally illegal in this county. I was surprised that the Buncombe County Sheriff Department wasn't waiting for me at the loading dock when I picked these things up. Anyhow, I finally rigged a launch pad by prying up one of the driveway drain grates with a crowbar and sitting the stick into the deep pit. Looked sorta like an ICBM silo with its hardened lid slid aside.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I asked which of my three kids wanted to light the fuse, but all took a few steps back and politely declined. Chickensh*ts. Kids just aren't made the same nowadays. They fulfill their danger quotient by shooting bad guys in video games. About as far from real danger as you can get, if you ask me.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I told the little weenies to stand back as I bent to light the device with a Bic lighter.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The lady at the fireworks importer promised me that these things would NOT make any noise. I told her that they HAD to be relatively quiet so I could shoot them off in my neighborhood without causing 'undue alarm'. She said I wouldn't have any problem. I emphasized the particular legal problems I would have if there were any type of loud report at apogee. I emphasized the fact that I lived right next to a National Park and that any type of firework that was discharged or assumed to be discharged on that property would get me sent before a FEDERAL judge right before I got sent to the COUNTY judge. She again assured me I would have no problem.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
That lying @#$&amp;*.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
That rocket engine had a burn time about as long as any I had EVER seen, and the ascent echoed off the surrounding trees. Diamond shock pattern extended from the back end. It kept going and going and going. When it hit apogee at about 1000 feet, the rocket disintegrated into a huge shower of silent red sparks. Pretty cool, I thought......until the shower of sparks burned out and suddenly transformed into a cloud of extremely bright and loud explosions. The kids scrambled into the back door 'Three Stooges' style (ie: where all three try to get through the same closed door at once) and left me standing in the smoking haze waiting for the cops to arrive. The dogs that live along our street were all barking their heads off at the apparition they had just witnessed in the night sky....<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
That ended the fireworks test for the night.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The next day, my oldest son Doug and I decided we were gonna 'neuter' one of the rockets so it wouldn't make any noise. I took him into the closet where I store the gardening tools and he saw these two huge cases of fireworks standing there. The kid went nuts. He wanted to open BOTH boxes so he could see what all 159 rockets looked like lined up next to each other. This kid has promise. I told<br>
<br>
him: &quot;Since mom only thinks I have a few of these things lying around, maybe that wasn't such a good idea.&quot; He mulled that over for a few seconds, then gave me a real big smile in agreement.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
We pulled one of the rockets out of the box and re-locked the closet door. He and I both sat down on the driveway and proceeded to take it apart. It was a standard issue big-arse Chinese sky rocket. I bet they used these to kill people 500 years ago. As I sat there taking layer after layer of paper off, his brain was filling with the details of construction. Tissue, cardboard, plastic, fuses...etc. Realizing that he was mentally storing the design for some future project sorta made me shudder. All I was thinking was the fact that this thing was probably put together by a political prisoner in a hellhole somewhere who is probably gonna get 'executed' so they can sell his internal organs on the transplant market. Probably not too far from the facts, but I managed to do a bit of explaining to him from the standpoint of aerospace engineering regarding how the thing worked. Doug is probably the only 4th grader in the U.S. who can now describe the principle of thrust using a control volume model.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The rocket was pretty simple. It had a very large booster engine topped with a warhead that contained the red sparkly things that exploded.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Removing the warhead was as simple as giving a quick twist, and I assumed the neutered rocket would fly higher without the payload. I was correct. Doug and I did a daylight 'stealth' test and were able to add about 50% to the altitude attained the previous night. We decided to modify four more rockets and put them aside in the closet for easy access. When this was done, Doug had a jar full of stuff that came out of the warheads including: 12 fuses about 3-inches long each, some paper, 4 plastic nosecones and a big handfull of these little black balls about the size of 12-gauge buckshot that turned out to be the 'red sparkly popper things'. It appeared that the outer layer was a simple gunpowder coating designed to quickly burn off as red shower of sparks. I surmised that the inner core had some kind of magnesium thermite that gave off an intense white light and a loud bang. Pretty cool if you ask me. Lots of energy packed into one teeny little ball.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I didn't want to see the popper thingies go to waste, so I told Doug we were gonna put them in a hole in the ground and set them off. He gave me another big smile.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
It's amazing how kids think alike...even when separated by 30 years.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
As I was digging a shallow hole with my hand, Doug asked if it would be alright to put an army man next to these things so that &quot;When they go off, it would look like he was getting shot with a maching gun&quot;. Dang....exactly what I was thinking. I agreed and he ran off to his room to dig something out of the mess. He returned in about 3 seconds, out of breath and holding a cheap plastic imitation of Robert E. Lee on horseback and a Civil War cannon. I pointed out that they didn't have a true machine guns in the Civil War, but we would overlook this for the purpose of the demonstration. He handed me the action figure and I placed it and the cannon next to a rather large pile of black beads from which a few of the fuses extended. I figured that three inches of fuse would take 2 seconds to burn, so I had at least that amount of time to stand up and take a few steps back. I neglected to recount the night before.....when the warhead ignited IMMEDIATELY upon reaching apogee.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Tricky Chinese. They had installed extremely fast-burning fuse in these things and that fact totally escaped me.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I squatted next to Robert Lee and gave a short eulogy. Doug laughed. I took the trusty Bic lighter and placed it next to the fuse. One flick got the lighter going and THIS IMAGE IS ONE I WILL REMEMBER FOR A LONG TIME. My hand holding a lighter next to a pile of explosives.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
There is usually a short but noticeable mental pause that occurs immediately before something bad or really stupid happens. It is where that little voice in your head says: &quot;You dumb&amp;ss.&quot;<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The fuse burn time was in the 1/1000ths of a second range. The pile of little popper thingy's immediately ignited into a tremendously brilliant ball of fire. All I could think was ...&quot;...th....th.....thermite...&quot; Unfortunately, when they are viewed at ground level, these little popper thingies become REALLY BIG POPPER THINGIES and have a tendency to jump up to 15-feet in every direction from their point of ignition. I instantaneously became engulfed in a ball of fire that sounded a lot like being in a half-done bag of Orville Reddenbacher's popcorn.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
It was all over about as fast as I could snap my fingers. After the smoke cleared, Doug started laughing his butt off. That meant I was still in one piece. Doug does not laugh at dismembered limbs. He said I jumped about 10-feet, an action that I do not remember. I checked my clothes for burn marks, and found none. He checked my back to make sure it was not on fire. No combustion there. The driveway was peppered with black holes where the concrete had been scarred from these things.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
A close one. Another REAL close one. My mind ran the tapes again to re-hash what it had seen. All I remembered was being inside something akin to a 30-foot diameter........flaming dandelion. Whew.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
We examined Ol' Robert E. at ground-zero. Instead of a machine-gun peppering, he got nuked. He and the horse he rode in on.......and his cannon too. One side was untouched, but the other side was arc-welded. Real warfare. Doug examined it real quiet-like and then started laughing again.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I assume he will remember the finer points of the lesson as he grows older. When I now speak of 'almost being burned beyond recognition' he will have a slightly better understanding of what I mean. I hope that this vivid image tempers the knowledge he now has regarding rocket construction. O well. After all, if your dad isn't gonna teach you how to get your ass blown off, who will?<br>

See, Fireworks were illegal to BUY in New Mexico but not illegal to HAVE..so we would hop on over to the Indian Reservation where my brothers would go to the &quot;Secret Room in the Back&quot;.  The pass word was &quot;I wanna go to the secret room in the back&quot;. I'm sure that stumped the Wiley Santa Fe County Sheriffs, not like they had ANY jurisdiction in the reservation to speak of.<br>
<br>
Anyway, this room was cleverly disguised by a &quot;curtain&quot; than when artfully manipulated, revealed a &quot;door&quot; that led you to a treasure trove of Roman Candles, M-80s, Lady Fingers and Cherry bombs.  My brothers viewed this place like Nirvana..saving up all their Lawn mowing and baby sitting money for the delightful destruction of neighbors mailboxes, fenceposts and Barbie dolls my sister and I failed to hide in a strong box under the floorboards of the house.  There were always specials..&quot;buy one dozen Bottle rockets get the second dozen FREE&quot;.  My brothers bought hundreds of explosivies, enough to start a revolution in a small country, loaded them up in the trunk, UNDER the seat to foil the cops, and brought them home.<br>
<br>
Our dogs usually went into hiding around June 22, when the Festivities started.  At first it was casual &quot;lets try one to see if they're any good&quot;.  Generally this was a cherry bomb on the street in the middle of the cul de Sac.  By the end of the first week, our streets and sidewalks were littered with Black pock marks, and bits of GI Joes who had won the medal of honor by Going against the entire VC ARMY and wiping out 1200 of them only to be foiled by that damn land mine.  My sister and I watched in amazement as they blew up things, one by one.  Stretch armstrong proved to be a nuclear weapon when a lady finger stuck into him spewed tons of toxic goo all over the sidewalk, the grass (it never grew right again) and my brothers hand (One of Many emergency room visits).  They were a tribe, my brothers and their friends, each with their own personal arsenal of weapons from which to destroy and conquer.<br>
<br>
As the 4th approached, the dares and tricks got more dangerous.  One year, they each took turns holding lady fingers after lighting them, timing each other to see who chickened out first by &quot;dropping&quot; it. Wusses lasted a split second, my oldest brother was reigning champion going with 4.5 seconds. (He still has scars on his arm).  Another year they played &quot;Bottle Rocket Chicken&quot; in which the object of the game was to shoot missiles at each other, each time moving closer until the rocket was in your face.  The &quot;chicken&quot; was the one who ran screaming, a bottle rocket in hot pursuit, holding his ass.  They took the contents of 7 m-80s, poured it into a plastic bottle, added a few fuses and lit the damn thing.  That was another hospital visit, to have shards of plastic removed.  They cut fuses short, set off bottle rockets by hand instead of in a bottle, chased us girls with lady fingers and generally terrorized the neighborhood for 2 weeks.<br>
<br>
Ahhh memories.  My mother finally Axed the whole thing when my brother put a cherry bomb down some public toilets.  He was arrested and forced to clean public bathrooms to pay for the damage.  We all sang silent thanks to my mom, yet I will always equate the smell of singed plastic and gunpowder, the high pitched whistling and KAPOW to the 4th of July.  I've also got a restraining order against ALL my brothers for my sons on the 4th.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub57.ezboard.com/umorff123.showPublicProfile?language=EN>morff123</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>One MEAN Kitty!
