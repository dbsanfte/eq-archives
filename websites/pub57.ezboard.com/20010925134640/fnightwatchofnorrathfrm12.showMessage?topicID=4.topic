<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Druid Epic Quest Walkthrough</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The Start<br>
<br>
- Find Telin Darkforest. He is located in BW near Skyfire zone. Head a few seconds to the right when you enter BW from Skyfire and you get him into track. Ask &quot;what action?&quot; and you will get a Worn Note. If not, then your faction is too low. Faction can be built up fast by doing the muffin-quest in Freeport. For me, a Halfling, I couldn’t get the note until I conned warmly to him.<br>
<br>
- Now go to Faelin Bloodbriar in Greater Faydark. She roams the northern area of Greater Faydark near the zone to Crushbone. Her spawnpoint is 1500, 500. Give her the Worn Note you got from Telin and you receive Faelin’s Ring. She is a rare spawn and can have orcs as placeholders. After receiving the ring, she despawns.<br>
<br>
- Next, find Giz X'Tin in Kithicor Forest. He roams the area near the path from West Commons to Highpass Hold. Give him Faelin’s Ring and you will get a Dark Metal Coin. After you hand him the ring, a lvl 50 Darkelf Reaver spawns and attacks but you can run away with SoW. <br>
NOTE: Don't help another druid or ranger with the Corruptor in East Karanas if you still have to do this part. Killing the Corrupter gives you bad Faction with Giz so that he won't give you back the coin for Telin.<br>
<br>
- Go back to Telin Darkforest and give him the Dark Metal Coin. He will give it back to you as Worn Dark Metal Coin. He tells you to find Athele.<br>
<br>
- Athele in East Karanas can be found near the river just north of the Barbarian Fisher village. Give her the Coin and receive a worn amulet. Give this amulet<br>
to Sionae (spawns -2300, -930), then to Nuien (spawns -3650, -300) and finally to Teloa (spawns -3800, -2860). The last step is the trigger for the Dark Elf Corruptor and two Darkelf Reavers (I think all about lvl 48 to 50) to spawn on top of the hill east of the river (loc -1500, -1000). <br>
NOTE: Don't start this part until you are ready to kill the DE Corruptor because all the druids except Athele are triggered spawns. So don't start giving around the amulet and stop at the last stage. You need luck to meet the full druid gathering after another druid or ranger did that part successfully.<br>
<br>
- Find the Corruptor and kill him fast on the hill north of the river. He will depop after 10 seconds if not attacked. The 2 Reavers will head to the 4 Druids and kill them. You don’t need to kill the Reavers. Just kill the Corruptor and loot the Fleshbound Tome. Give Athele the Fleshbound Tome and get an Earth-Stained Note. Bring this to &quot;she who walks the land in service blabla...&quot;<br>
<br>
- Find Ella Foodcrafter in Misty Thicket. She roams the zone from RV to the wall.<br>
Give her the Earth-Stained Note and she will tell you that she needs a mixture. She will give you her Shiny Tin Bowl. It is a Container so you need a free slot in your inventory. She also mentions some kind of ancient bowl that she needs.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Hardened Mixture<br>
<br>
- You must forage 4 items that you have to combine in the Shiny Tin Bowl.<br>
<br>
- Chilled Tundra Root from Everfrost Peaks.<br>
<br>
- Sweetened Mudroot from Misty Thicket.<br>
<br>
- Speckled Molded Mushroom from Innothule Swamp.<br>
<br>
- Ripened Heartfruit from Greater Faydark.<br>
<br>
- This can take several hours. Combine those 4 items in the bowl and you get a Hardened Mixture.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Runed Bowl<br>
<br>
- Go to the Chess Board Island in Timorous Deep and ask Alrik Farsight &quot;how do you make an Ancient Bowl?&quot; He gives you a Crushed Pot and sends you to Felwithe to talk to Farios Elianos. <br>
NOTE: The level 52 Druid Spell, Egress, will take you to the Chess Board Island. <br>
<br>
- Talk to Farios Elianos he can be found in the Library in Felwithe South. If he doesn’t respond to you when you hail him, then your faction with Keepers of the Art is too low. You can build up faction fast with the batwing-quest in Felwithe South. If Farios talks to you, give him the Crushed Pot and you receive a Grocery List. He will give you the Receipt for the bowl if you do a job for him.<br>
<br>
- Bring this Grocery List to Merchant Nora in Felwithe North and she gives you in return a Bag of Provisions. Bring it to Farios and he gives you the Receipt for the ancient bowl.<br>
<br>
- Head back to Alrik Farsight in Timorous Deep. He will give you an Ancient Pattern when you give him the Receipt.<br>
<br>
- The pattern says that you have to combine it with a piece of Enchanted Clay and Platinum Speckled Powder in a pottery wheel. No skill in pottery required.<br>
<br>
- Platinum Speckled Powder can be obtained through the following sub-quest: <br>
<br>
Forage a Rose of Firiona in Firiona Vie and give it to Merdan Fleetwood in Surefall Glades. The Old Wooden Painting that you receive has to be brought to the Human Skeleton that roams the western part of Frontier Mountains. Head back with the Silver Chained Locket you got from the Human Skeleton to Surefall Glades and give it to Niera Farbreeze. She hands you the Platinum Speckled Powder.<br>
<br>
<br>
- Enchanted Clay can be obtained through Kinlo Strongarm in Kaladim's Everhot Forge. If you ask him &quot;what mud?&quot; and &quot;do it for me.&quot; he will tell you that he would like to have a colored axe for his service. This is a Jade Reaver that can be found in the City of Mist. Hand him the axe and you get the Enchanted Clay. <br>
<br>
- Now combine the Ancient Pattern, Enchanted Clay and Platinum Speckled Powder in any pottery wheel to make the Rune Crested Bowl. No skill is required.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Stones<br>
<br>
- Go Back to Misty Thicket and hand Ella Foodcrafter the Hardened Mixture and the Rune Crested Bowl. She will make for you a Softly Glowing Stone from it.<br>
<br>
- Ella tells you to find one such as yourself. For the Druids this means to seek out Foloal Stormforest in Firiona Vie.<br>
<br>
- Ask her &quot;are you one such as myself? &quot;, &quot;what answers?&quot; and &quot;what about Venril Sathir?&quot; She tells you to bring her the stone you already have from Ella and the gem that can be found on Venril Sathir (the respawn, see below).<br>
<br>
- Kill Venril Sathir in Karnor's Castle.<br>
<br>
- Upon Killing Venril Sathir, the “Remains of Venril Sathir” will spawn. <br>
<br>
- Cast the level 1 Druid spell, ‘Dance of the Fireflies’, and hand the resulting<br>
lightsource (a globe), to the remains. This will then cause a Ghost of Venril Sathir to spawn. <br>
NOTE: Neither the skeleton or ghost will agro.<br>
<br>
- After handing in the lightsource, the ghost will ask you for a resurrection scroll.<br>
In this case, it refers to the level 49 Cleric Spell, Resurrection. Which can be bought at your local Cleric guild.<br>
<br>
- Turning in this scroll will cause a SECOND version of Venril Sathir to spawn. This version is much less difficult that the first one. He DOES NOT Lifetap… he will only Harm Touch. Once he dies, loot the Pulsating Green Stone.<br>
<br>
- Give the Pulsating Green Stone and the Softly Glowing Stone to Foloal Stromforest and get a Warmly Glowing Stone. Foloal tells you to take the stone and walk your path.<br>
<br>
- The Druid's path leads back to Ella in Misty Thicket. Give her the stone and you will get the Elaborate Scimitar (10/30 9wis 10mana 5sv poison and disease, looks like the Runed Falchion). She asks you to collect the Cleansed Spirits of Antonica, Faydwer and Kunark and hand them along with the scimitar to Xanuusus.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Cleansed Spirits<br>
<br>
<br>
The Cleansed Spirit of Antonica<br>
<br>
- The withered treant in North Karana tells you to find the corruption in the land. He means the: <br>
<br>
- Corrupted Mammoth (mid-20’s). Pops in Everfrost near Permafrost zone. PH is the Mammoth Calf.<br>
Drops: A Chunk of Tundra<br>
<br>
The Corrupted Aquagoblin Shaman (mid lvl 30). In Lake Rathe (PH are the side spawns on top of the underwater-tower. Use wolf form to be non-agro to the other goblins. They heal each other so kite him away. Also, it can take several tainted to get the corrupted. <br>
Drops: Clean Lake water<br>
<br>
The Corrupted Hill Giant (mid lvl 30). In Rathe Mountains at the HG area south of the hill with the Guard Tower.<br>
Drops: Ancient Rock<br>
<br>
- Give the 3 items looted from them to the treant to receive the treant heart. Go to Yeka Ias in South Karanas and give him the heart. You find him east of the bridge at the water. He will give you the Cleansed Spirit of Antonica.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Cleansed Spirit of Faydwer<br>
<br>
- You will meet a pained unicorn in lesser Faydark. Collect for him the items looted from the: <br>
<br>
- Corrupted Seahorse in Kedge Keep (lvl 52, 1 or 2 groups needed). As far as I can remember you have to pass the area where Estrella is and the named Seahorse Undertow.<br>
Drops: Kedge Cave Crystals<br>
<br>
The Corrupted Cyclops (lvl 52). 3-4 people, best tactic is fearkiting because he is lvl 52. PH are the Seafury Cyclops in Ocean of Tears. <br>
Drops: Ocean of Tears Sea Vines<br>
<br>
The Corrupted Brownie (lvl 52). Brownie Scouts are PH. Each can pop the tainted so it is possible that 2 or even 3 tainted roam the area. Brownies are Druids by nature so, be careful with the Corrupted; bring a few friends along. Found in Lesser Faydark.<br>
Drops: Green Heartwood Branch<br>
<br>
<br>
- The Unicorn will give you a gleaming horn for the 3 items. This has to be handed to the gnome Silox Azrix in Ak'anon to get the Cleansed Spirit of Faydwer. He is near the mines on the left side of the green river. There is another greenie gnome near him but you can do this part with Superior Camouflage on you if you are KOS or otherwise disliked there because you need no faction for Silox.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Cleansed Spirit of Kunark<br>
<br>
- Ulump Pujluk, a named Froglok in Swamp of no Hope (north of the Froglok Village) tells you to give his own essence along with the 3 corrupted things to the gnome that hurts the land. Ulump, is a lvl 55 warrior that doubles for 250 and has 32k HP. He can't be slowed or tash’d. You should have 2 groups with 4-6 melee and 2-4 nukers (all as high lvl as possible) to kill him. Lure spells hit for full damage.<br>
Drops: Froglok Essence <br>
<br>
The other 3 corrupted mobs of Kunark are the:<br>
<br>
- Corrupted Gorilla (mid 40) in Emerald Jungle. Root/DoT him and stay far away. He has SoW speed and pops in the northern part of the Plateau (near zone to Field of Bone). Tottering Gorillas are PH of the tainted and only non-undead tainted will pop the corrupted. <br>
Drops: Green Tree Bark<br>
<br>
- The Corrupted Barracuda (high 40,loc -900, -900) in Lake of ill Omen. Only the blue tainted will pop the corrupted. Pull it on the land and kite him because root breaks fast. Would be much easier if you have a friend that helps you kill the corrupted.<br>
Drops: Pure Lakewater<br>
<br>
- Faydedar that lives in the sea in Timorous Deep. As of the last patch, this is now a triggered spawn! To do so, simply hand in the Froglok Essence that you looted from Ulump to Dolgin Codslayer. He will immediately return the item to you, despawn, and Faydedar will come rushing from the water. Kill Faydedar and loot his drop.<br>
Drops: Pod of Seawater<br>
<br>
- Hand the 4 items to the Gnome, Nekexin Virulence in Overthere to get the Cleansed Spirit of Kunark. He can be found near the evil outpost at the water.<br>
<br>
<br>
The End<br>
<br>
- Hand the 3 Cleansed Spirits and the scimitar to Xanuusus the treant in North Karana to receive the Nature Walker's Scimitar.<br>
