<br>
The Start<br>
<br>
The quest starts in the second floor of the Vasty Deep Inn in Erudin.  There you will find Stofo Olan.  Hail him:<br>
<br>
You: 'hail Stofo Olan'<br>
<br>
Stofo Olan: 'Good day, I have discovered something truly wonderful! If I only had the materials required so I can copy my notes and send them to my teacher.'<br>
<br>
You: 'what materials?'<br>
<br>
Stofo Olan: 'The materials I need are a mechanical pen, ink of the dark, and white paper. Bring me those and I will give you a copy of this information.'<br>
<br>
You: 'who is your teacher?'<br>
<br>
Stofo Olan: 'My teacher is Jeb Lumsed. He was last seen in the regions of the newly discovered lands. If you wish to find him that is where you must seek him out.'<br>
<br>
You heard him, you need to get him the three items he asked for which are a Mechanicel Pen, Ink of the Dark, and the White Paper.  These are all mini sub-quests.<br>
<br>
Ink of the Dark<br>
<br>
Now find Reania Jukle in the Qeynos Aqueducts.<br>
<br>
You: 'what is the ink of the dark?'<br>
<br>
Reania Jukle: 'Ink of the Dark, you say? That isn't an everyday item, you know. In fact i can't remember the last time someone requested it. I have given up keeping any here with me. You are going to need to find your own supply now. Sorry.'<br>
<br>
You: 'where can I find the ink of the dark?<br>
<br>
Reania Jukle says: 'The ink is the blood of a dark scribe. Tempt him and give him this vial. He should cooperate.'<br>
<br>
You recieve an Empty Ink Vial from her.  Now go to Lower Guk and find the Ghoul Scribe.  Charm it and give it the Empty Ink Vial.  It will give you the Ink of the Dark.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Mechanical Pen<br>
<br>
Now go fine Rilgor Plegnog in the Mine of Malfunction in Ak'Anon.  <br>
<br>
You: 'What do you know about a mechanical pen?'<br>
<br>
Rilgor Plegnog says: 'Why do you want one of those contraptions. You will spend more time repairing it then you will writing with it. But if you insist on getting one, you are going to have to do a small favor.'<br>
<br>
Rilgor Plegnog tugs at your robe and grins evilly. Mighty nice outfit you have there. Sure beats these drab robes us three are wearing. Hmm...my favorite color is purple, in fact a shiny metallic purple would do nicely. How bad did you want that pen?'<br>
<br>
Yep!  You got it!  Rilgor wants the shiny metallic robes.  These robes are dropped off of the Ghoul Archmagus.  He spawns in the Magi Room.  To get there from the Dead Side Zone 1, go down the small hallway at the zone, turn right and go down another hill.  Run through the small corridor until you come to water.  Jump into the water and swim to the right.  You will come up at the bedroom.  Take the passage all the way to the left.  Follow this until you come to a big room with bats in it.  Take the passage to the left of you.  Next, follow the wall to the right, past the Greater Ice Bone Skeletons.  Until you come to a group of steps with a bridge.  Jump off the bridge to the left.  Go straight down a hallway and you will come to a jail.  Keep going straight down that hallway until you can turn to the right.  Turn to the right and follow that hallway to the magi room.  For a map go to www.graffe.com. The magus is a 30 minutes spawn and has a placeholder which is usually a Kor Ghoul Wizard or a Dar Ghoul Knight.  He spawns 1 every 5 times.  So expect him to spawn once every 2 and a half hours.  The rare drop is a Shiny Metallic Robe which drops 1 every 6 times.  If you get up early in the morning and get into a group there I bet by the end of the day you will have one.  Note that the Shiny Metallic Robe is not no drop and can be purchased for approximately 7,000 platinum.<br>
<br>
The White Paper<br>
<br>
Now you must get the white paper.  You need to find Chrislin Baker at 1050, -1990 in West Karanas.  Give her a paper and quill.  These can be found at any enchanter guild.  <br>
<br>
Chrislin Baker gives you a hug. 'Thank you so much. I did some cleaning after you left and found this behind a barrel. It may have been left behind by the person who took my materials. You can have it'. <br>
<br>
She hands you a Bandit Sash.  Receiving the sash will spawn Thracken Griften, a level 55 very aggressive Bandit at around loc 800,-11570. You need to kill him to get the white paper.  He is totally magic immune so you will need lots of tanks and clerics.  Pets are also useful.  <br>
<br>
Go back to Erudin and give Stofo the three items.  <br>
<br>
'Yes, that is what I wanted.'<br>
'Here, take these notes.' <br>
'My teacher will be very interested if he knows what I have found'. <br>
<br>
He will give you a Copy of Notes.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Jeb Lemused<br>
<br>
Now you must find Jeb Lemused, who is in the form of a sarnak imitator in the Burning Woods.  He is not always around.  To make him spawn, kill nearby sarnaks.  Hail him when he spawns.<br>
<br>
You: 'Are you Jeb Lumsed?'<br>
<br>
A sarnak imitator: 'Yes I am. Use your most enlightened magic to seek the truth of what is around you. When that is done, you will know what you seek’<br>
<br>
You give the Copy of Notes to Jeb Lumsed.<br>
<br>
A sarnak imitator: 'I see that you have what I was waiting for. Stofo does do excellent work. It seems that you are to start on a long journey. Take this seal and it will guide you on your next step. Seek out the masters of enchantment. In time we will craft the Serpent for you. When you have collected the four parts of the staff, you must combine them in a bundle for me. If you need a sack, just let me know.'<br>
<br>
You receive a coin called 'jeb's seal'<br>
<br>
You: 'I need a sack'<br>
<br>
A sarnak imitator: 'Take this sack and combine the items I requested in it. Then return it to me.<br>
<br>
You receive an enchanter's bag.<br>
<br>
You: 'What serpent?'<br>
<br>
A sarnak imitator: 'The first truly powerful enchanter, Krilan Pedin, crafted the Serpent years ago. He trained his students to carry on the trade in a five-step process. Each student then became a master and chose one of their own students to pass the legacy on to. Four others and I, myself, are current practitioners of the crafting.<br>
<br>
You: 'Who are the four other masters?'<br>
<br>
A sarnak imitator: 'The masters are enchanters who have reached the plateau of understanding. Their names are Modani Qu'Loni, Mizzle Gepple, Nadia Starfeast, and Polzin Mrid. All are master crafters in their own right.<br>
<br>
You: 'Who is modani?'<br>
<br>
A sarnak imitator: 'Modani is a master of illusions. You should seek him out first. Keep a careful eye out for him - he is never in his true form. The last time I spoke to him, he seemed very excited about his voyage to the elven outpost. You may or may not find more clues about his location there.<br>
<br>
You: 'Who is mizzle?'<br>
<br>
A sarnak imitator: 'Mizzle is a gnome who has mastered the use of enlightened magic. Go to him once you have spoken to Modani. Mizzle is not one to travel, so you should not have to look far from his home to find him.<br>
<br>
You: 'Who is Nadia?'<br>
<br>
A sarnak imitator: 'The mistress of charm, Nadia is very beautiful. She, too, traveled with her relatives to the new land. I just recently received a letter from her. She says more and more pilgrims and explorers are arriving every day, and that the outpost is well defended now.<br>
<br>
You: 'Who is Polzin?'<br>
<br>
A sarnak imitator: 'Master of the Phantasms - he is the last one you will seek out. Hmm...Polzin is native to Erudin, however, after the incident near Paineel, no one has heard from him. I hope that he is well.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Modani Qu'Loni<br>
<br>
The Master of Illusions is Modani who can be found in The Overthere at +540 -940.  He is in the form of a Scorpion and is surrounded by other Scorpions.  You can either kill these others or have someone lure them away.  Once you get to Modani, hail him.<br>
<br>
You: 'hail Modani Qu`Loni'<br>
<br>
Modani Qu`Loni: 'The hidden self inside a myriad of magic is one that walks quite softly. Yes, that is what you must seek.'<br>
<br>
You give Modani Qu'Loni Jeb's Seal.<br>
<br>
Modani Qu`Loni: 'Ah yes, Jeb's seal. The time to craft a Serpent must have come. I will need components collected to craft the first of the pieces. I will also provide you with a sack in which you must combine the items. Are you ready to collect them?'<br>
<br>
You will get Jeb's Seal back.<br>
<br>
You: 'I am ready to collect them.'<br>
<br>
Modani Qu`Loni: 'Scattered throughout the world are various items. To prove your worth, go collect these and return them to me. The Xolion Rod, Innoruuk's Word, Chalice of Kings, and snow blossoms.'<br>
<br>
You: 'I need a sack.'<br>
<br>
Modani Qu'Loni: 'Take this sack and combine the items I requested in it. Then return it to me. '<br>
<br>
You receive an Enchanter's Bag<br>
<br>
You: 'What is the Chalice of Kings?'<br>
<br>
Modani Qu'Loni: 'The Chalice of Kings is the chalice of elven kings. Recently thought to be lost to the ages, it was recently discovered. I need its magical powers to create a magical liquid.'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The Chalice of Kings<br>
<br>
To get the Chalice you first have to kill Prince Selrach Di'Zok.  He is a 61 warrior in Chardok.  Once you have killed him, loot his head.  Then, find Joren Nobleheart in the Felwithe Magician Guild.  Hail him and give him the head.<br>
<br>
'Vengeance has been fufilled! However, the King still has a heavy heart. Not until Firiona has been return can this sadness be lifted. But in appreciation of your efforts, I am honored to present to you the King's Chalice'. <br>
<br>
You receive a Chalice of Kings.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The Xolion Rod<br>
<br>
Now for the Xolion Rod.  The Xolion Rod is found off of Vessel Drozlin near the Shaman Guild in Cabilis East  The easiest way to get there is to follow the sewer tunnels to the second opening.  Then follow this and you should find him.  For more info go to eqmaps.com.  He hits for 315 damage (max).  He can be killed with 1-3 55+ groups.  Loot from his corpse the Xolion Rod.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Snow Blossums<br>
<br>
To get the snow blossums, go to Bozlum Blossom (Loc 540, 1150) in Oggok.  <br>
<br>
Ask her 'What is wrong Bozlum?'<br>
'Boz like to grow perty flowers in her garden. But garden no more.'<br>
<br>
'What happened to your flower garden?' <br>
<br>
'Boz not know what happen. Only see der biggins footprints in it. Me perty sure my puppy not smash garden. He has tiny feets. Right, puppy?'<br>
Bozlum Blossom pet wags his tail.<br>
<br>
Next, go to Brokk Boxtripper who is in a hut very close to her cave.  Next to him on the ground will be a pair of Large Muddy Sandals.  Take the Sandals to Bozlum for a Scribbled Parchment which she asks that you give to Brokk.  When you give the Parchment to Brokk he will give you a Gift to Bozlum which you should take to her.<br>
<br>
'Oh, dat silly Brokk. He sent me too many of these perty flowers. Me not know where put them all. Here, you take some cause you help Bozlum. Me like you. Flowers make you smell perty, too'. <br>
<br>
She will then give you Snow Blossums.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Innoruuk's Word<br>
<br>
The final item you need for Modani is Innoruuk's Word.  These are dropped from Verina Tomb in Neriak Third Gate in the Cleric Guild.  She is a very easy level 60 with a spawn time of 48 hours.  She can be taken down by just 1 55+ group.  Have someone that is a Dark Elf or can use Dark Elf Illusion, pull her to the Third Gate zone line.  Then, have the enchanter slow and tash her.  Have the tanks bash and hit her.  If she tries to cast Complete Heal just keep her stunned.  There is also a guard at the zone line which you can either mesmerize or kill.  She will not hurt any faction.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
1st Part of the Staff<br>
<br>
Put the Chalice of Kings, Xolion Rod, Innoruuk's Word, and Snow Blossums into the bag that Modani gave you and hit combine.  You will get Sack for Modani.  Give the Sack to Modani in Overthere and you will receive the 1st Part of the Staff.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Mizzle Gepple<br>
<br>
Find Mizzle Gepple in Ak'Anon.  He will be in the form of a Clockwork VIIX.  Hail him.<br>
<br>
You: Are you mizzle?<br>
Clockwork VIIX: 'Oh hello! I'm Mizzle, that I am. I bet you want to be given true clarity, don't you?'<br>
<br>
You: 'What are the required components? I am ready to collect them.'<br>
Clockwork VIIX: 'Then bring me a spoon, the one key, the lost scroll, and the book Charm and Sacrifice. I will then reward you with what you seek.'<br>
<br>
Ask him for a sack and he will give you an Enchanter's Bag.  Next you will have to collect the four items.  Most of these items are just found on the ground and have long spawn times so this part might be a little tedious.  Atleast you won't have to kill anything that hard.  <br>
<br>
The Components<br>
<br>
The Spoon is dropped from Cazel in Oasis of Marr.  He is a rare spawn and has a 300 pop regeneration.  Even though he is only 51, the regeneration makes him seem much higher and you need a couple of high level groups to kill him.  He will drop the Spoon.  The One Key is found in the Overthere on a ledge at approximately -190, -380.  You will need levitate to get there.  The spawn time is 24 hours.  The Lost Scroll is found in the bottom of Dalnir.  It is inbetween a bed and the wall at -18, 54.  The spawn time is 24 hours.  Finally, the Book of Charm and Sacrifice is found in the Plane of Air on a table to the right of the Efreeti spawn.  Again the spawn time is 24 hours.  Combine all these items in the Enchanter's Bag to get a Sack for Mizzle.  Give the Sack to Mizzle in Ak'Anon and you will get the 2nd Piece of the Staff.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Nadia Starfeast<br>
<br>
Now find Nadia Starfeast in Firiona Vie at -3870, 2525, -75.  Hail her and ask for a Sack.  She will give you an Enchanter's Bag.  She asks you to fill it with an enchanted diamond, sapphire, ruby, and emerald.  To do this you must first get the dull versions of these gems by talking to her:<br>
<br>
'What gems?'<br>
'I have prepared some gems that you will need to trap the essence. You will need to force a diamond, sapphire, ruby and emerald onto special creatures to obtain their essence.<br>
<br>
'I need a sack'<br>
<br>
She gives you an Enchanter's Bag.<br>
<br>
What diamond?'<br>
'Here is the diamond that I have prepared for you. Its only purpose is to trap the essence of a particular book worm. If you should fail in your first attempt. Do not worry, I will provide you with another.<br>
<br>
You receive a Dull Diamond<br>
<br>
'What sapphire?'<br>
'Here is the sapphire that I have prepared for you. Take it and give it to the one referred to as the Golden Faerie.<br>
<br>
You receive a Dull Sapphire<br>
<br>
'What ruby?'<br>
'Blood red is the ruby that I have given you. The city that you must travel to has no sun, but still a day and night. And at night, the mist could suffocate one. Tis the fate of poor Jaxion.'<br>
<br>
You receive a Dull Ruby<br>
<br>
'What emerald?'<br>
Nadia Starfeast jumps. 'Eeekk... a scorpian. I thought they rid this area of these critters. Those things give me the creepers. Take this emerald and be on your way.<br>
<br>
You receive a Dull Emerald.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The Gems<br>
<br>
To get the Enchanted Diamond you must get to the Spectral Librarian in Kaesora at location 85, -415.  Once you enter Kaesora, cast levitate and invis, and go straight forwards and drop down the hole.  Don't go all the way down - just keep heading straight ahead onto the ledge in front of you. Enter the room with the three spiders and turn right and go through that door. Directly behind that door there is a secret wall which you go through then just before you hit the corner, cast invis vs. undead. Enter the building you see when you go round the corner.  The Tortured Librarian is the placeholder so if it is there just simply kill it and wait for the spectral to spawn.  Once you see the Spectral Librarian, mesmerize it and hand it the Dull Diamond.  It will give you back the Enchanter Diamond and then turn into an enraged spectral librarian.  Right now you have two choices.  The first one is to gate out.  The second one is to kill him.  If you choose to do this, three freed souls will spawned once he is dead.  These have hardly any hit points but can do quite a bit of damage with their area effect spells.<br>
<br>
To get the Enchanted Sapphire you must get to Felia Goldenwing in Skyfire.  She spawns rarely close to the Burning Woods zone.  The people who hunt here do see her daily so if you get in a group and wait she is bound to come around sometime.  Once she is sighted, quickly charm her.  She is KoS to all other mobs in Skyfire.  Give her the Dull Sapphire and she will give you the Enchanter Sapphire.<br>
<br>
To get the Enchanted Emerald you must get to Impaler Tzilug in Overthere at -90, 810.  Once you see him, charm him and give him the Dull Emerald.  You will get the Enchanted Emerald.  <br>
<br>
To get the Enchanted Ruby you must get to Wraith of Jaxion in City of Mist. It will spawn next to Neh'Ashiir's building near the Reaver.  Charm him and then give it the Dull Ruby.  You will get the Enchanter Ruby. <br>
<br>
Combine the Enchanted gems in the Enchanter's Bag.  You will get a Sack for Nadia.  Give the Sack to Nadia.<br>
<br>
'Excellent, you have done what is required. Here take this part, and seek the fourth master, to complete your quest'. <br>
<br>
You will receive the 3rd Part of the Staff.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Polzin Mrid<br>
<br>
Now you must find Polzin Mrid in The Hole in a garden.  His is at location 210, -50.  <br>
<br>
'Hail Polzin Mrid!'<br>
'Yes, young one?<br>
<br>
Give Polzin Mrid Jeb's Seal.<br>
<br>
'Jeb has spoken with you already, excellent. Tell me are you ready for the test of the phantasm?<br>
<br>
You receive Jeb's Seal back.<br>
<br>
'I am ready for the test of the phantasm'<br>
<br>
'It will be simple, go collect these items and return them to me. Head of a serpent, essence of a ghost, essence of a vampire, and sands of the mystics. Do so and you will receive the last of the pieces. Be sure to combine them in a sack first. Just ask and I will provide you with one.<br>

'What is the head of a serpent?'<br>
'Serpent is probably not an accurate term form what you must return to me. It is actually the remnants of a spirit. The spirit is one which was eradicated long long ago by the Iksar. I believe they were called the Shissar. You may need to travel to the Iksar city to learn more about these creatures.<br>
<br>
'What is the essence of a ghost?'<br>
'You don't have to look far to find roaming spirits. One in particular though has more meaning then the other sorry souls trapped here. You see, Kindle was a dear friend of mine. I came in search of him when he stopped writing. Wel....look at me now. I fear that I have succumbed to the same fate as poor Kindle.<br>
<br>
'What is the essence of a vampire?'<br>
'The essence of a vampire is just that. Only the most powerful of these creatures will possess what you need.<br>
<br>
'What sands of the mystics?'<br>
'They are sands that were imbued with the magical might of the mystics. Mystics use a ritual involving their own blood to create a powerful bond with the sand. One will need to search the shores.<br>
<br>
The Components<br>
<br>
The Essence of Ghost is found off of The Ghost of Kindle in The Hole.  She can be found in the Undead Tower.  There are a few other spawns in here such as reavers.  They are all non aggressive except for the reavers unless you attack them which you will have to do.  You must kill The Ghost of Kindle and the two reavers.  On her corpse will be Essence of Ghost.<br>
<br>
The Head of a Serpent is found off of a Wraith of a Shissar in Plane of Fear.  The Wraith is about a 3 day spawn.  It quad hits for 300 and spawns deep inside the Amygdalon temple.  The Shissar herself is actually extremely easy to kill.  The hard part is getting to her.  You basically have to clear the whole Plane, and then pull her from the temple.  This could take many hours, or it could take a few, it depends on the skill of your guild.<br>
<br>
Sands of the Mystics is found off of The Tangrin at 3500, 2800 in Field of Bone.  This is a 54 monkey with high magic resist and a harmful stun.  The only thing that really sticks are Wizard Lure spells.  He hits for about 230.<br>
<br>
The Essence of Vampire is found off of forsaken revenants in Plane of Hate.  These are level 49-51 creatures that are rare.  As well as the Essence of Vampire, they drop Apothic and Insidious armor so they are uncommon.  What's even worse is that Essence of Vampire is a rare drop so it will take a long time to do this.<br>
<br>
Combine the four items in the sack given to you by Polzin.  You will get a Sack for Polzin.  Give him this sack.<br>
<br>
You will get the 4th Part of the Staff<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The End<br>
<br>
Return back to Jeb Lemused in Burning Woods.  Ask him I need a sack and he will give you an Enchanter's Bag.  Combine the four staves in the bag and you will get an item called Bundle of Staves.  Give the Bundle of Staves to Jeb.<br>
<br>
'The path you trod was long and hard. Now you are worthy to bear the Serpent. Use it well'. <br>
<br>
You will receive the Staff of the Serpent.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Note:  If you ever need an Enchanter's Bag to combine quest items, all you need to do is ask any quest NPC, &quot;I need a sack.&quot;  This will cause them to give you an Enchanter's Bag.<br>
