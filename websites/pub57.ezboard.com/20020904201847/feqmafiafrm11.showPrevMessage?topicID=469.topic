When you send someone a tell, while they are in the process of killing Aary, what time they are expecting to be out of NToV because your wanting to go in, what sort of answer did you expect? <br>We'll be out in 86 minutes, be sure to have a sizeable force ready?<br><br>No. You were told that normally people wouldn't go in right after someone killed Aary. Normally, they won't. Often, they will. This was never made an agreement.<br>As far as I know, 4 out of the 5 guilds actively killing in NToV, only FS have never gone in right after (i.e. within 24 hours) of another guild killing Aary. Yes, that 4 includes Diligence.<br><br>Now, seeing as at the time of Toramin telling you that, at least 2/4 guild that have killed Aary had already shown they would kill well within 24 hours of another guild killing Aary, why would you assume this was any kind of agreement?<br>If it were to be an agreement, surely all guild currently killing in NToV, and those approaching readiness for NToV, would have to be made part of any agreement involving it.<br>If Toramin had said &quot;Nightwatchers will not kill in NToV within the 24 hour period after another guild kills Aary, we would appreciate it if you did the same&quot;, you may well have a case.<br>As it stands, I fail to see where the statement became an agreement.<br><br>Next point.<br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> we never as a guild have moved in 8 hours after Roy has been killed, the mobs that we have killed in Ntov besides Roy had been left up, for a while, more then 24 hours<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>This is, quite simply, a lie.<br><br>The Thursday before you killed Aary, Usque Sidera had killed him.<br>Shortly after they left ToV, you went in a killed Lord Krez.<br>From what I am told, and I am aware of the validity of heresay, or lack thereof, Galladrielle was told &quot;You left it up, so we kill it&quot; or words to those effects.<br>Now, if you don't want people to kill in NToV shortly after you kill Aary, a good start would be not to do it yourself.<br><br>Your update of that kill included this screenshot. Since this is your site, I assume you won't mind me using your bandwidth.<br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.goodguysguild.com/images/Dragon=Ranadin.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>Now maybe I'm wrong, but you seem to be ridiculing any agreement that might have been made. If I am wrong about this screen shot, then would you please enlighten me to what it does refer to.<br><br>In closing, I do not understand why a statement would be seen as an agreement.<br>I do not understand why you think 2/5 guilds killing in NToV would make an agreement, as it barely lessens the chance of someone going in after you.<br>Someone killing in NToV within 24 hours after someone else kills Aary is nothing new. TDE, Diligence(yes *gasp* without asking permission), Usque Sidera and yourselves had all done so before Nightwatchers. No one has ever made an issue out of it before.<br><br>I won't pretend that the situation is ideal, but if everyone else is playing the game one way, you sit either them down and grind out of rules, or you shut up and play the game. <p><font size=2><font color=blue><a href=http://nightwatchers.dpn.ch/eq_view_profile.html?num=1190>Chubbylumpkins Anklesbane</a></font></font><p><font color=yellow>Warnome</font></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ccc0a6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub57.ezboard.com/ukatmaypokeyou.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Katmay Pokeyou</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#778899>(8/11/02 3:39:53 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A couple of questions.</span><hr size=1> Okay.<br><br>Ntov is FCFS/FFA/Whatever. There is no &quot;24 hour after aary&quot; rule.<br><br>When Forged Souls and ourselves (Diligence) were the only guilds doing ntov runs, we more or less alternated, and shared. There was never even a specific time then when you could move in, but if someone killed aary, they pretty much went and killed the rest in as long as it took, and the next guild would get the next spawn.<br><br>Then more guilds came in wanting to test themselves on ntov mobs etc. Some guilds were talking 3 days to kill aary (I kid you not) and then expecting even more time to kill the rest of the mobs. It just doesnt work with things like that, so everyone came to the conclusion that Ntov would become FCFS just like the rest of the server.<br><br>Dont throw other guilds names around in this, we did nothing. This is between you and GG, and you're inability to show them the same courtesy and respect they showed you.<br><br>I dont know who told you this supposed 24 hour rule, or if you pulled it out of your ass. You told Good Guys that apparently, and they abided by it. They respected YOUR aary. Then when the time came when you had the choice of returning the favor or not, you chose not to.<br><br>So the way I see it, you fed them a BS line about there being a 24 hour period, knowing that there is no such thing. You lied to and manipulated a guild that is newer than yours to ntov.<br><br>Would Diligence have moved in the next day if we decided there was nothing better for us to be doing, and if no one else was in ntov? Yes. Theres no fault in moving into a zone that no one else is in on a FCFS server, the fault lies in the fact that you lied and made up some 24 hour rule in an attempt to lay claim to the zone after you had left, and Good Guys believed it.<br><br>to everyone: Yes, aary is tougher than most mobs in there. But he is just another dragon. All this talk of him being special and granting a guild some rule over ntov is ridiculous and needs to stop if we expect conflicts like this to stop. Think of it as telk and gozz. Killing Telk gives you no claim over Goz if you leave wtov. If no one is in ntov, help yourselves. Dont decieve others with nonsense rules, though. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub57.ezboard.com/ukatmaypokeyou.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Katmay Pokeyou</A> at: 8/11/02 3:41:44 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A8A8A8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub57.ezboard.com/uvashanbramblenutts.showPublicProfile?language=EN>VashanBramblenutts</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Capo de Capo</span><br>  Posts: 886<br> <font color=#778899>(8/11/02 3:58:58 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A couple of questions.</span><hr size=1> Look at the day I posted that SS, it was the day when TDE started talking that everyone else broke thier agreements. It was the incident that Dili and TDE over Creator. I was poking fun at TDE that they say everyone else breaks thier agreements and its everyone else fault and they are Perfect. So ask me what I meant on a Post, before you try to figure it out. AND theres a hidden way to find out what i meant. So try to figure it out.<br><br>Its funny that now the tells i sent to US, everyone knows what we said. Yeah US was not happy we killed that dragon and i did told Her that it has been up 24hrs since Aary was up.<br>She did tell me that if she knew that she had 24hrs to kill all the mobs, then she would have killed dif dragons and not left him up. But all that communication is between me and her.<br><br>And Thank you Katmay, you hit the nail on the coffin. My whole point in all this is that you guys told us something that u didnt later followed thru. So whats done is done, And like the Website says We will move on, but always watching our for Roaches.<br><br>WHATS DONE IS DONE, No more about this and the next person that brings this to our boards will be BANED. <p><p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://www.goodguysguild.com/images/Signiture.jpg" width="500" height="200"></p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub57.ezboard.com/uvashanbramblenutts.showPublicProfile?language=EN>VashanBramblenutts</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0> at: 8/11/02 4:00:37 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub57.ezboard.com/feqmafiafrm11.showPrevMessage?topicID=474.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub57.ezboard.com/feqmafiafrm11.showNextMessage?topicID=474.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub57.ezboard.com/feqmafiafrm11.emailToFriend?topicID=474.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub57.ezboard.com/feqmafiafrm11.threadControl?topicID=474.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub57.ezboard.com/feqmafiafrm11.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=474.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub57.ezboard.com/feqmafiafrm11.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=474.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub57.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="eqmafiafrm11">General Forum<option value="eqmafiafrm15">Training Grounds<option value="eqmafiafrm21">Epics</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#778899>- </font><a href=http://pub57.ezboard.com/beqmafia>Good Guys Guild</a><font color=#778899> - </font><a href=http://pub57.ezboard.com/feqmafiafrm11>General Forum</a> <font color=#778899> - </font><a href="http://www.goodguysguild.com">GoodGuysGuild Home Page</a><font color=#778899> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
