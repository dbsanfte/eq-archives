 <br>
The Crafted Armor Quests are given out by two centaurs in South Karanas in the Centaur Village at approximately 200, -2400.  The names are Ulan and Shakrn Meadowgreen<br>
<br>
The Bracers<br>
<br>
You say: &quot;What crafted bracers?&quot;<br>
<br>
Ulan Meadowgreen says 'The fine sheen you see on our crafted armor is produced by a mixture of river berries and juice squeezed from the optic nerves of an evil eye. We are always in need of more optic nerves for our armor. Bring me a handful of optic nerves and a [sapphire], and I will give you a crafted bracer for your trouble.<br>
<br>
Ulan asks for a bunch of optic nerves and a sapphire to make the crafted bracer.  The optic nerves are a common drop off of Evil Eyes in both East Karanas and the Beholder Maze.  The Evil Eyes are around level 20 and are fairly easy to kill.  They are a common spawn.  The sapphire can be bought at any jewelry shop for approximately 105 platinum depending on your charisma.<br>
<br>
Crafted Bracers:<br>
    AC 10<br>
    +2 Dex &amp; Int<br>
    Race All<br>
<br>
<br>
The Breastplate<br>
<br>
You say: &quot;What crafted breastplate?&quot;<br>
<br>
Ulan Meadowgreen says 'Deep within the depths of Castle Mistmoore lives a particularly deadly clan of werewolves. These are the servants of [Mayong], and he has enchanted the most ferocious of them that their talons might cut through steel. I wish to study these talons, and see if I can transfer the enchantments from them to the crafted armor I make. If you bring me werewolf talons and 3 [rubies], I will give you a breastplate, the likes of which you have never before seen.<br>
<br>
For the Breastplate, you need one werewolf talon and three regular rubies.  The werewolf talon can be found off of werewolves in all the Karanas, West Commons, and most commonly Mistmoore.  The werewolves are rare spawns so peple usually go for the Gypsies in Mistmoore, who also drop these.  The Gypsies are fairly low level and spawn every 25-30 minutes in the ballroom.  They have around 800 hit points.  The rubies can be bought at any jewelry shop for the price of 105-150 platinum depending on your charisma.<br>
<br>
Crafted Breastplate:<br>
    AC 22<br>
    +5 Sta<br>
    +25 HP<br>
    Race All<br>
<br>
The Boots<br>
<br>
You say: &quot;What boots?&quot;<br>
<br>
Shakrn Meadowgreen says 'One of my brethren spoke to me of the mystic properties of the frost totems carried by the goblin high shamans in Permafrost Keep. I have been unable to fetch one for myself, as my centaur body will not fit through the tunnels of those sniveling wretches. Prove your might by providing me a frost totem and two [sapphire] stones. Do this and I will reward you with a pair of crafted boots.<br>
<br>
For the Boots you will need one Frost Totem and two Sapphires.  The Frost Totem drops off of a goblin patriarch.  This a level 30ish creature that will take a group of 30s to kill.  It is a common spawn and drop.  The sapphires can be bought at any jewelry shop for approximately 105 platinum depending on your charisma.<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
Crated Boots:<br>
    AC 12<br>
    +5 Agil<br>
    Race All<br>
<br>
The Gauntlets<br>
<br>
You say: &quot;What gauntlets?&quot;<br>
<br>
Shakrn Meadowgreen says 'Crafted gauntlets - the mark of a distinguished warrior. I have a personal grudge to settle with those twice-cursed aviaks. They have been raiding our merchant convoys for the last few weeks, causing mischief to no end. Bring me an aviak charm from an avocet. I am sure I will not need to tell you how to get it. An aviak charm and two [star rubies], and I will reward you with crafted gauntlets.<br>
<br>
For the Gauntlets you will need one Avocet Charm and two Star Rubies.  The Avocet Charms are a common drop off of Avocets in Southern Karana.  These are a common spawn in the Aviak Village located just straight from the Lake Rathe zone.  They are around level 30.  If you are not that high enough to kill them, try getting into a group.  Also, people usually shout if there is an Aviak Charm on an Avocet and no one in their group wants it.  The two Star Rubies can be bought at an jewelry store for around 80 platinum depending on your charisma.<br>
<br>
Crafted Gaunlets:<br>
    AC 12<br>
    +5 Str<br>
    Race All<br>
<br>
The Greaves<br>
<br>
You say: &quot;What greaves?&quot;<br>
<br>
Ulan Meadowgreen says 'Years ago, a necromancer most foul terrorized the people of the Karanas. This wretch stole a [circlet] father was smithing for my sister. It was very easy to recognize - shining silver like the light of dawn breaking. I have heard rumors that this necromancer has settled in the depths of Najena. Return this circlet to me and gift me with two [star rubies], and I will reward you with crafted greaves.<br>
<br>
For the Greaves you will need a Dark Circlet off of Trazdon and two star rubies.  Trazdon is a level 25 mob in Najena.  He spawns and stays around the Bonecrusher room, deep into the dungeon.  He drops the Circlet about 25% of the time.  The two Star Rubies can be bought at an jewelry store for around 80 platinum depending on your charisma.<br>
<br>
Crafted Greaves:<br>
    AC 14<br>
    +2 SV Fire &amp; Cold<br>
    Race All<br>
<br>
The Helm<br>
<br>
You say: &quot;What helm?''<br>
<br>
Shakrn Meadowgreen says 'One of my brethren spoke to me of the mystic properties of the fire totems carried by the goblin high shamans in Solusek's Eye. My mighty centaur body will not fit down those twisty goblin passages, so I have not been able to acquire one on my own. As proof of your powers, I ask you to bring me a fire totem and one [ruby] stone. Do so and I will reward you with a crafted helmet.<br>
<br>
For the Helm, you will need one Fire Totem and a Ruby.  The Fire Totem is most commonly dropped off of an Inferno Goblin Shaman in Sol A.  He is around level 28 and spawns in the Bar Area of Sol A.  If he is not up, you will have to kill other mobs to get him to spawn.  The chance of him dropping the Fire Totem is very high but he does not drop it every time.  The Ruby can be bought at any jewelry shop for about 140 platinum depending on your charisma.<br>
<br>
Crafted Helm: <br>
    AC 14<br>
    +5 Cha &amp; Wis<br>
    Race All<br>
<br>
The Pauldruns<br>
<br>
You say: &quot;What Pauldrun?&quot;<br>
<br>
Ulan Meadowgreen says 'In the caverns of Clan Runnyeye live several evil eyes of prodigious magical power. Split among them are the three lost pieces of the legendary [Rune of Dwarves]. When assembled, this rune is said to impart a mystic skill to the smith who holds it. Bring me these three pieces and a [fire emerald], and I will smith for you a pauldron worthy of the mightiest of warriors.<br>
<br>
For the Pauldruns, you will need the Top, Middle, and Bottom Runes of Dwarves and a Fire Emerald.  They are called Rune of Dwarves when you loot them and you must indentify them to find out if they are Top, Middle, and Bottom.  They drop off of Evil Eyes in Runnyeye, the Gorge, and East Karanas.  They drop most commonly from the Evil Eyes in Runnyeye but if you are not a high level, you might want to try them someone else because they are wizards, and they hit very hard.  It would only take a couple of hours to get them in Runnyeye where as it would take much more time to get them elsewhere unless you are lucky. The Fire Emerald can be bought off of jewelers for around 80-100 platinum depending on your charisma.  <br>
<br>
Crafted Pauldrun:<br>
    AC 12<br>
    +2 SV Magic<br>
    Race All<br>
<br>
The Vambraces<br>
<br>
You say: &quot;What vambraces?&quot;<br>
<br>
Shakrn Meadowgreen says 'Come, warrior, and speak to me of your strength. Bring me the eye of a griffon that I might eat it raw in the fashion of my ancestors. Do this for me - then gift me with two [fire emeralds], and for you I will make a crafted vambrace.<br>
<br>
For the Vambraces, you will need a Griffon Eye and two Fire Emeralds.  The Eye of a Griffon is an uncommon drop off of Griffons in both East and North Karanas.  It takes about 4-6 kills to get an Eye.  They are around level 37 but hit as if they were several levels higher.  Make sure not to confuse Griffon Eye with Eye of a Griffon.  These are two separate things.  The Fire Emerald can be bought off of jewelers for around 80-100 platinum depending on your charisma.  <br>
<br>
Crafted Vambraces:<br>
    AC 12 <br>
    +2 SV Disease &amp; Poison<br>

The bracer quest is the easiest to do because the nerves drop far more often then any other item, and the fact that they are not lore makes it even better as you can do multiples at a time. Surprisingly this quest gives very good exp even at higher levels. the one downside is that the gems you need to turn in for the bracers, (unless looted from random mobs) will never be lower than 105pp each. tried buying the gems(saphirres) normal cha and ally faction, they were 125pp each, switched to cha gear (drop to 105pp) then got a make them love me buff which put me at ally faction, and 223cha and they were still 105pp, so yes it does get expensive, but it is also well worth it if you are considering making a new warrior or have a warrior that needs a little bit better armor.<br>
