How often do you see it in America these days? It isn't so easy anymore. I personally was raised in a single parent home and my Mom did a super job by herself. She also worked her ass like a dog to make ends meat to put clothes on our backs and food on the table. Yet she couldn't be around full-time. With the way society is today I am betting over 50% of all the homes in the US with children are being raised by a single parent. So that means society will play a HUGE role in the morals of children. That is why Clinton fucked up hardcore. The President is a position that should warrant good social behavior. If you believe otherwise, I pity you.<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S. Trust me i am a big supporter of Parents doing the raising and leave TV and Video games out of it. But having the most powerful man in the world lie under oathe and also say oral sex isn't sex will be used by every child that is old enough to know what he said. People like him should never be giving teenagers more ammunition for corruption. Fucking draft dodger! <p><BIG><FONT COLOR=00FFFF>Steel <BR>

You can't have it both ways. This is the wrong place fo a discussion like this and I shouldn't have responded since all it does is cause me aggravation. It just bothers me that the Republican party constantly throws up any red herring it can find to keep from discussing real issues. Like that their &quot;tax cut&quot;, which is really an advance on the taxes you pay next year, is nothing more than a raid on the social security fund. However they spend enough money on commercials to dupe enough people into supporting them.<br>
 As far as the whole Clinton blowjob thing, it is none of your business what a person does in the bedroom unless they invite you in it. I think it is a crime against the constitution what the Ken Starr witch hunt did, and if Mr Clinton lied under oath, where are the charges? He has never been convicted of ANYTHING, however in the land where others want to be considered innocent till proven guilty, you would think the same rights would extend to the preisdent. If you want to point fingers and play a &quot;he did this&quot; game I can dig up as much shit on any of the last 3 Republican presidens to make Clinton look like a choir boy. Point is, when choosing a president I look to what they do in the boardroom and don't really care what they do in the bedroom. <p>Capodecima of La Mafia<BR>Gobsmaka Toofsmasha</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub57.ezboard.com/usteelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Steelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#939393>(8/30/01 2:33:25 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gobs (and anyone interested in Bushisms)</span><hr size=1> So what you're saying is forget Clinton's other actions and only care about how he did as president? Hmm let's see...you brought up the tax refund. Well boo hoo. I'm sorry Bush didn't have the luxury Clinton did by riding the republican wave of a thriving economy. Bush now has to try his best to get the economy back on it's feet and atleast he took that chance with the refund. I look back on the 8 years Clinton was President and i don't remember anything significant that the puppet did unless you count the lieing under oath ordeal. Why was there no charges for it? Hmm let's see. Well because maybe the fact that if they charge him with it, it will be an impeachment trial. That means the only thing he will lose is Presidency and he'll never spend a day in jail. So in reality it would only HURT the U.S. and the bastard was close to the end of his term anyways. And really why would they need to press charges. They had it on tape and showed it on TV. He already lost whatever dignity he ever had. <br>
<br>
<br>
Anyways, Bush might not take the humanitarian award this year, or hell ever, but i'd rather have him then Gore and apparently so did the majority of Americans.  <p><BIG><FONT COLOR=00FFFF>Steel <BR>
