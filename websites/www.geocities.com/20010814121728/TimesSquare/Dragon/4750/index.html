<h1>---Site Update---</h1>
<ul>Update List:
<li>January 14th, 2000 Complete site redesign.</li>
</ul>
<p>The EQRPA site has been undergoing a major transformation. You may still visit our <a href="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Dragon/4750/old/index.htm">old site</a> or go straight to our <a href="http://www.geocities.com/eqrpa">new site</a> (Please note, this is our new site location at www.geocities.com/eqrpa instead of www.geocities.com/chronicler_kithra - we're doing this so we're more convenient to get to). We left both pages up so you could compare and <a href="mailto:kithra@frazmtn.com">send us comments your comments</a>.</p>
<p>Improvements to our site include:</p>
<ul>
<li>New layout, allowing those unfamiliar with us to browse start to finish while letting repeat visitors jump to virtually any point in our site.</li>
<li>New Background Submission form - allowing players to submit their race/class/diety, any titles or nicknames they have, specify gender and whether is they wish the character to be a member of the EQRPA.</li>
<li>Use of Style Sheets. Assuming you are using a fairly current browser, the style sheets vastly improve the appearance of the site. More style modifications will be added on as time permits</li>
</ul>
<p>Future improvements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The constant updating of character backgrounds, adding new servers as submissions come in.</li>
<li>Adding message boards to the site</li>
<li>Details on our "GM" program - for the bold who wish to help coordinate all our members and their stories</li>
<li>A general roleplaying page, what it is and how to get started (for those that have never tried it before)</li>
<li>And, of course, graphics to spice up the pages appearance</li>
</ul>
