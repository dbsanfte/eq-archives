<p><font size=5><strong>Bill Hicks will be Missed for Courageous Comic Voice</strong></font><strong><br>
The Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel, March 4, 1994<br>
<br>
Stand-up comics are on conspicuous display this weekend. Unfortunately for the 
current state of the art, the best of them, Bill Hicks, is no longer around. He died of 
cancer in February. He was 32. <br>
<br>
Mr. Hicks was not the average one-liner type of comedian. He told what the critic 
John Lahr of The New Yorker described as &quot;jokes to kill,&quot; most of them scathing 
observations on American icons and institutions (George Bush and the Persian Gulf 
war were among his choicer targets). That may explain why he was less popular in his 
own country than in Britain, winning the top award at the 1990 Edinburgh Comedy 
Festival and doing his last major television special in Britain. <br>
<br>
It's Just a Ride, a documentary tribute to Mr. Hicks that can be seen Sunday on 
Comedy Central, was made by British producers. The comedian's life and special 
style are recalled through performance clips and interviews with people ranging from 
his parents and friends in Houston to colleagues like Richard Belzer, Richard Jeni, 
Brett Butler, Jay Leno and David Letterman. His mother, displaying a quarter-inch 
of space between thumb and forefinger, says, &quot;He was just that far from being a 
preacher.&quot; That's as good an insight as any into the man. <br>
<br>
As Eric Bogosian observes, Mr. Hicks was something of a witch doctor getting rid of 
public poisons. A brilliant performer, he was contemptuous of performing. &quot;Bear with 
me a while,&quot; he says, greeting one audience, &quot;while I plaster on a fake smile and do 
this stuff one more time.&quot; <br>
<br>
He smoked and devilishly pointed out that &quot;nonsmokers die every day -- sleep 
tight.&quot; He despised advertising and marketing people, urging them to kill themselves 
because they are &quot;Satan's little helpers, filling the world with violent garbage.&quot; As 
for pornography and talk about its lack of artistic content and its possibility of 
causing sexual thoughts, Mr. Hicks insists that &quot;it sounds to me like every 
commercial on television.&quot; <br>
<br>
Endorsed by Mr. Leno, Mr. Hicks did get a good deal of exposure on Mr. 
Letterman's Late Night Show on NBC. &quot;Over the years,&quot; Mr. Letterman recalls, 
&quot;he never disappointed.&quot; It's all the more sad, then, that a Hicks appearance last 
year on Mr. Letterman's new show on CBS was cut just before broadcast. CBS 
censors were not amused, evidently. &quot;Our relationship with Bill Hicks came to a 
rather peculiar ending,&quot; says Mr. Letterman, expressing &quot;a personal sense of 
regret.&quot; Almost to the very end, Mr. Hicks never stopped making it difficult for 
everybody. <br>
