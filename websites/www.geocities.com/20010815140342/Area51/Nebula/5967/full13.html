<font color="WHITE" size=5><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">With wide eyes and open mouths the ladies listened to the traveler tell of her magical scythe's origin. We'll go
 there someday they said, and they did. Later that season, with their now honed skills they planned to set out across Antonica in
  search of the ultimate weapon. Bringing their good friend Brigid, Vaelaelia and Atos stocked up for the long journey. As the
  three ladies stood at the entrance of Neriak discussing the route, a passer by offered more valuable information about their
 destination. Confident, they left the safety of Nektulo's Forrest on their round about path through many lands. For you see, as
 hated dark elves, though beautiful women, they are not safe near most cities and must avoid populated areas. So they headed
  south to travel through the lands of ogres and trolls. With the help of a young ogre they quickly were back on the road after
   losing their way. Only a mountain range and a large lake stood in their way. None of them having been this far from home
  before, they moved with caution. As they left the mountains a large lake loomed before them like an ocean. As time passed
 standing on the dock they lost hope of a ferry coming and dove into the vast lake. Swimming near shore they had to stop and
  rest or risk drowning from fatigue. After continuing the wet journey around the next bend, an orc yelled something vulgar at
  them from a camp on the shore. As hostile spells flew through the air, the dark elf maidens dove deeper into the darkness to
  safety. Surfacing for air and taking another break, they noticed a dock up the shore. A knoll stood guard, waiting for weary
 travelers. With the battle cry of 'Darkmoon' the ladies rushed the unsuspecting knoll and quickly spilt his unworthy blood. As a
 second knoll received the same fate for coming to help his comrade, the ladies now noticed the surrounding area. Tucked away
  by the lake, a rune of many stones, with many weak knolls living there. Exploring the area they found a deserted camp that
 overlooked the rune. Having sat by the fire and planned the attack, they cleansed the rune of the dirty dog like knolls. With the
    still wet blood on their hands, moving through the next pass beheld their destination. The plains stretched to the horizon.
Elephants and other unseen before creatures roomed while three ladies vainly searched for a magical scythe. No one in the area
 had heard of the Lord that possessed the weapon. Thirsty again for blood lust, the group felled another elephant calf before the
adventurers visited the local dungeon. Disappointed that weak knolls filled the halls and ran from a fight, they decided to call it a
   day. Killing a few more dog men by the lake, they jumped in the water for the swim back. Passing the orc camp this time
 proved more dangerous. Remembering the snide comments Vaelaelia had made about them, the five of them decided to jump
 in the water and give chase this time. Narrowly escaping back to the mountains, the women ran in full stride now eager to get
    home. Brigid gave her thanks for an exciting day as she wandered off into the desert with her lover. Vaelaelia and Atos
   continued home to Neriak for a couple too many drinks before turning in. Though the prize was not obtained, the greater
                        treasures of friendship and trust will last longer then any weapon.
