My apologies for the lengthy delays between posts, but I've been taking time lately to explore all that Velious has to offer in the way of quests. Hopefully I'll have a few new pages to add from my adventures soon, but for now here are a few of the things I've been working on of late. Special note: I have decided, after many months, to change over to Giant faction. I was Dragon/Dwarf for a long time, but the armors available from the Kael Drakkal quests are so far superior to any others dropped or quested in the game to-date, and I could not resist. My apologies in advance to those of you working&nbsp; on faction in the other zones, as it probably will prohibit me from being able to cover things of interest for this entire audience. But who knows... maybe seeing the interesting things Kael has to offer will convince your switch as well. *grins* Good adventuring, and a special thanks to lovely emails from Magi Aeleric and Alefia, for reminding me why I do this. ;)<br></span></font></i><i><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"><br></span></font></i><b><i><u><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">The Icy Mugs and Corudoth:</span></font></b></i></u><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> </span></font></b></i><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">This is actually a rare possible Thurgadin-connection quest, probably one of the last I'll be able to comment on effectively. In participating in a Kael quest, I was at one point requested to take an item to Corudoth, the large turtle believed to be Lozidal's alternate spawn, in Iceclad Ocean.&nbsp; In speaking with the reptile, he mentions a band of explorers he once was part of, the 'Icy Mugs'. Now, having once been on dwarven faction, I recalled the souvenir mugs from Thurgadin bars: give each bartender from 5 gold to 1 plat and you'll receive one of these. Collect the whole set! At any rate, nobody to my knowledge had yet found a purpose for them. As one of them is called or identified as (can't remember) 'an icy mug', I think the possibilities for an as-yet unknown quest connection are quite exciting. In fact, all of the mugs identify as something a bit different (such as 'a cracked mug half full'). Verrry interesting indeed! I cannot recall if the mugs themselves are no-drop; if so, I cannot now complete this with my main character, as I'm KOS in Thurgadin. Corudoth is located just under some floes off one of the islands in Iceclad and doesn't appear to be KOS to anyone. If your Kael faction is not good enough to do the unrelated quest, I believe you can trigger Corudoth's story by hailing him and saying 'Helssen says you owe him'.

The Coldains originally settled in Thurgadin in the Great Divide, presuming the Frostones had been destroyed. The Frostones won the war, but had no idea as to the success of the escape party, and presumed they had all died. Until now, I had not been able to find evidence of any of the two dwarven factions in proximity. But one day after having no success talking to the Frostone dwarves, I killed... a couple, thus dropping my faction with them. Later travelling in the Eastern Wastes, I came across two huts very near one another. One with the standard Coldain dwarven inhabitants who conned amiable to me, and one with a captain and five of his guard, who conned dubious. Lo and behold, these were the two living next door to one another! As I am dubious, I cannot speak to the captain nor any of his men, and to-date nobody has been able to find how to raise faction with them in order to get their quests. Perhaps a class with an alliance-type spell will see this and become intrigued enough to check it out and start helping solve the mystery? The two huts are located near the Ry'gorr-Giant fort in the Northwestern area of the zone at location neg150, pos2400? Follow the left wall as you leave the Great Divide; you cannot miss them! </span></font><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"><br><br></span></font></b></i><b><i><u><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Kael Drakkal Quest Fever Begins:</span></font></b></i></u><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> </span></font></b></i><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Now that players have had time enough to build the faction in this zone needed to trigger and complete the quests, I can honestly say the number of possibilities here is STAGGERING! I have gotten to warmly with both Frost (Kromrif) and Storm (Kromzek) giants, thus enabling me to experiment. I'm apprehensive to Tormax, so there will be even more available when I up that faction, but for now see a page of </span></font><a href="Kael_Texts.html"><font color="#990000" face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">interesting texts from Kael</span></font></a><font color="#990000" face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">(some of them firsts that I have been able to discover) and some theories as to their purpose. Or yet more questions! Let's work together, all you evil dwarf killers, and figure some of these out! Incidentally, a Rallos Zek character is not KOS (will be dubious) in most of Kael, if you can get one over to explore. However, dubious faction is not good enough to trigger the majority of the quests. Still, very interesting city!</span></font><i><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:14"><br><br></span></font></i><b><i><u><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">The Karnoric Ruins in Timorous Deep:</span></font></b></i></u><i><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> </span></font></i><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Nothing like having a warrior friend who gets lost a lot, to help make these listings possible. While trying to find the Hidden Inn the other day, our fearless leader stumbled across an uncharted mass of ruins, sunken beneath the waves in the Timorous Deep. They were at approximate location pos0, neg700, and I believe he had arrived in the zone as you would come from Oasis shuttle. He described the underwater ruins as having (as do many ruins in Kunark) a 'Karnor' flavor to them, so I am guessing it's a grouping of buildings which resembles the castle in the Dreadlands. More on this as I can find things out! <br><br></span></font><b><i><u><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Less Rudeness in the World:</span></font></b></i></u><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> Unless you were living in a cave at the time (which is quite possible, in Norrath ;), you'll recall the recent unexpected appearance of the Rude Individuals in several areas across the land. They were apparently led by a Qeynos individual, who has since disappeared, as have his underlings who so frequently slaughtered newbies with wild abandon. An NPC in that city now makes reference to him and his uncivilized acts, and urges the populace to find his current whereabouts. Intriguing storyline indeed! You can find some reference to this vanishing act </span></font><a href="http://pub7.ezboard.com/fmysteriesofnorrathfrm3.showMessage?topicID=8.topic"><font color="#990000" face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">here</span></font></a><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">.<br><br><br><br><br></span></font><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="-1"><span style="font-size:12"><br>Page updated: 04/10/01</span></font></b></i><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:14"><br></span></font><span style="font-size:14"><br></span><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:14"><br></span></font><u><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"><br></span></font></u></td>
