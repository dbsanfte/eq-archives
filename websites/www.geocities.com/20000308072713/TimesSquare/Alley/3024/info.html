<p>10/22/98 - OSI has announced that "The New Age" of Ultima Online will be released toward the end of the month.  Indeed preparations are underway for the servers to accommodate the rush of adventurers wishing to explore the new lands.  Screenshots will be posted in the screenshot page, as soon as LadyMage gets a chance to do some exploring:)</p><br>
<p>06/28/98 - There are rumors that a new version of Ultima Online, UO Gold, is currently underway.  According to postings in
popular message boards the new version will include new lands and cities.  Perhaps the fabled Samlethe will be among these.  Unfortunately, no release date information is available at this time. The UO Vault has an article that pretty much summarizes all that is known about UO Gold.  I have linked it here.<A HREF="http://www.uovault.com/uogold.html"><IMG SRC="pics/link.gif" border="0"></a>Click button to read it.</p><br>
<p>05/19/98 - The new reputation system is now operational in the Test Center.  The system will serve to encourage PvP while at the same time discourage the rampant pkilling that has plagued UO all these months.  Those who have experienced it seem to have very positive things to say about it.  Make sure you read all the reputation info at the Origin site.  "http://www.owo.com".</p><br>
<p>01/20/98 - Well UO is well underway and many new servers have been added by OSI.  Patches are published very regularly and the main complaint I hear is Laaaaag....but UO is still an awesome game.</p><br>
<p>09/22/97 - After over two months of testing the beta is scheduled to end tomorrow and the game should be in stores next week.  The Charter Edition is shipping at this moment.  I have found no information on internet access charges.  As soon as I do I will post.</p><br>
<p>07/08/97 - According to Origin, Phase 2 of beta starts tomorrow, July 9, 1997.  Visit the "What's New" section of the Origin site for more information.  This is hard news, no rumor.  The Origin site may be reached through the link on my main page or "http://www.owo.com".  See you all soon in Britannia:)
<p>06/29/97 - UO beta Phase One ended last Sunday.  Origin anticipates Phase 2 to begin approximately two weeks from now.  Rumors abound that Phase 2 will last for approximately 6 to 8 weeks.  Lets hope that they are right.</p><br>
<p>06/12/97 - Origin announced the beta today at their web site (accessible through the Main Page of my site).  Go there to read all about it.  Don't forget to go to the "Help and Guidance" section and read the "gameguide".  Hope to see you all soon in Britannia.</p><br>
<p>05/08/97 - I was informed by Brother Shike that a new Garriott/Long interview was posted at ogr.com.  <A HREF="http://www.ogr.com/specials/ultima_online_interview.shtml"><IMG SRC="pics/link.gif" border="0"></a>Click button to read it.  A little slow loading, but worth the wait.</p><br>

<p>04/03/97 - A new Ultima Online page was launched by Origin tonight.  The link on the Main Page has been updated to the new URL, "www.owo.com".  Update your bookmarks.
<p>03/26/97 - According to the guild registration page at owo.com, new cities added = Serpent's Hold, Samlethe: Forest, Samlethe: Wind.</p><br>
<p>03/16/97 - Last night Woofer announced his new UO Voting Forum web site.  I have viewed it and he is to be commended for the excellence and timeliness of his work.  The presentation of statistical information on UO hot issues is wonderful.  Go register your password and vote.  Make your opinion count and see how others feel on issues.  The results are instantaneous. <A HREF="http://www.canvaslink.com/uo/"><IMG SRC="pics/link.gif" border="0"></a>Click button to the Voting Forum. Woofer's URL is "http://www.canvaslink.com/uo/".  Update your bookmarks.</p><br>
