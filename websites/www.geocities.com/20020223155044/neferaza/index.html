<i>Joining the knights</i><br>
I have many friends in the guild 'the knights of the white rose' and they stand for the same ideals as the new combine does, roleplaying and honour. Lately I have been having a lot of trouble finding people of my level to hunt with and I do not have much time to spend on the guild. I always ended up hunting with the knights anyways, therefore I have applied for a membership there. This means that I will give leadership of the new combine to someone else. I have not yet decided who this will be, but in any case I thank you all for having you in our guild. If anyone decides to leave, I can recommend the squires of the white rose, the lower level version of the knights (knights is level 31+). Or you can decide to stay and defend the ideals the new combine empire has always stood for, and follow the new leader. Thank you all for supporting the new combine, and I wish you all well.

<hr><b><a name="about">About the guild</a></b><p>
We are the New Combine Empire, risen from the crumbles of the old human realm that once spanned wide over Norrath.
<hr><a name="members">Members</a>
Our members are comprised of members of the light races, in contrast to the old Combine Empire we see the need to include other light races in our realm.
<ul>

There are laws to be followed in the new realm, and these are set by our princess Neferti as following.
<ol>
<li>We shall follow our princess always in wars against the dark ones and if need be, defend ourselves from all the enemies the realm makes.
<li>We support roleplaying whenever we can and wherever we can.
<li>We shall always be fair in combat, no corpse camping, deliberate training or other such misbehaviour is allowed.
<li>We try to support the loot and scoot rule if we can.
</ol>

<b>Guild stance on rules of engagement:</b>
<br>Teaming: Although most of our members are of the human team, the guild is a 'light' guild. Some might call this crossteaming... so what. This is a game and everyone plays the way they want, we play GvE and others play Team vs Team. Everyone will have their fun, but being in this guild will mean you play a 'lightie'. If you want to play otherwise just make another character and join one of the team-only guilds.

<p>Dishonorable acts: If someone did corpsecamp, xp-kill or bindrush you, petition if appropriate. Also take a screenshot if possible. This screenshot will be sent to the guildleader of the guild that person is in, do not take any action against that guild until the guildleader responded, if he did not care about it you are free to do whatever you wish with the screenshot (but do not post it anywhere before the guildleader responded!). Try not to do onto others what you wish not be done to thyself, so try not to xp kill someone who did the same to you, use petition in that case.

<p>Invulnerable healers by race: if someone attacks your party feel free to heal your friends if you wish, however do not use invulnerable healing offensively. So for example if you are hunting halflings yourself, try not to have shorts in your hunting group, or do not heal the non shorts if you are a short in that raiding party. On the other hand if you are for example hunting somewhere and you are ambushed by halflings, it is okay to let yourself be healed by halflings in your party.

<p> Invulnerable healers by level: Try not to do this, if others want to have fun pk'ing and do not have too much of an advantage (delevelling or *extreme* twinking is 'too much of an advantage') do not use OOR healing, let them have their fun. Of course there are exceptions in this if for example your group is attacked while hunting somewhere and you are only one level higher or lower you can help your teammembers. If you were in range they would have had to deal with one more opponent so you do not have too much of an advantage by using it anyways. This is somewhat of a grey area so this is not really an official stance.
