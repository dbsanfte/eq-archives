posted some new SS that Ayaki sent me. Very cool naggy pics, check them
out.&nbsp; Thanks, crack dealer :) Also please take a look at the message boards
and post under Kittana's new section for &quot;Guild Strength&quot;. I think
she'd like to hear everyone's input on this topic. Good journeys -- Pheelya

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Sunday January 5th, 2002: </b>It
was with heavy heart that I retired Pheelya from LoS yesterday. I have enjoyed
spending the last 30 or so levels with you all, but I have real life friends in
Inevitable Storm and The Shadow Order and a big part of the reason I play is to
spend time with them, so I accepted an invitation to IS. I have left my
alternate chars Aksyra and Valeska in the guild and will continue to do the
website and lower level raids with LoS. Also Valeska is an officer and is pretty
much permanently in Kunark, so if anyone needs an invite or such there, let me
know :)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">It has been a while since the guild
site has been updated so if anyone has any interesting screenshots, char
histories, etc to submit, send an email to to the Webmistress and I'll post
them. Also be sure to keep your chars updated at <a href="http://www.guildmagic.com">www.guildmagic.com</a>
and to check the calendar often for raid and event info. Thanks, and good
journeys -- Pheelya Grimsnippet</font></p>

raid on CT went great last night. We got three good drops and only one death
total. Gratz to Kweynn, Evilundead and Samzox who won the rolls. We still have a
lot to learn about raiding together but all in all it was a success. Thanks to
everyone who came, and especially to Leizark who is an officer with <a href="http://kickme.to/darkflamewarlords" target="_blank">Darkflame
Warlords</a> and is working with me to form an alliance between the two guilds.

working here on the site. With the help of Geocities technicians ( it was a
problem on their side though don't know what exactly) they are starting to get
more into working order. Its still a little buggy but I am reforming them so
that with a few tricks we can use them fine until they are all fixed again.
Please bear with me and there will be instructions on each form page as to how
to get the cursor in the boxes so that you can fill them out. Please read the
instructions before trying to send me a form. I get garbled and incomplete info
if you don't. Thanks for your support and patience. =)&nbsp;</font></p>

anymore either. I am working on it all the time and trying to find a bug in their
