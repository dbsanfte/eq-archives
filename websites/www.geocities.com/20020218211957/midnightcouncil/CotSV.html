Unwritten Norrathian Lore speaks of a Fier'Dal prophet. This Prophet, who is told to be mute, is to be the chosen one to bring peace and harmony to all the lands of Norrath.
<BR><BR>
The Lore also tells of an evil presence. This evil presence is said to be the bane of the Prophet, and will inevitably overrule the lands of Norrath and fill them with evil, should the Prophet fail in her destiny. It is also told to be led by a female Teir'Dal. Her identity is uknown. She is only known as The Queen.

Midnight Council is in search of the identity of The Prophet. Being Fier'Dal, we anticipate her and her guardians to reside somewhere on the continent of Faydwer. Keep your eyes and ears open.
<BR><BR>
Shortly, in a week's time, Belmonte will visit a wedding, where Leafenryn is best man. There, in passing, he will let Leafenryn know that it was he that slaughtered his family.

Good news, Brothers and Sisters of Midnight Council. A Fier'Dal spy has been captured and imprisoned in Neriak.
<BR><BR>
Leafenryn, member of the hated <i>Circle of the Silent Vigil</i>, was found in Neriak spying and eavesdropping. Guesses are, he was attempting to obtain the identity of The Queen and relay that information back to his guild and The Prophet.
<BR><BR>
Luckily, our net of informants in Neriak were swift enough to catch him in the act and banish him into an in-escapable cell.
<BR><BR>
The captive shall be held in this cell until a proper sentence can be devised and carried out.
