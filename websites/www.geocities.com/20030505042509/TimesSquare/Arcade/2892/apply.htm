<FONT FACE="comic sans ms" SIZE=+3><CENTER><B>A Warm Welcome<BR>
To All M&amp;M Applicants</B></CENTER></FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="arial"><H4>First of all, thank you for your interest in the M &amp; M Guild. <BR> We trust you have taken a few moment to peruse our web site and that has brought you to this page to submit an application for membership.<BR>
<BR>
Our guild is much like a &quot;family&quot;.  We take care to select prospects who might blend well with our existing members.   Our membership size is small (usually at about 50 active members) so that we can all get to know each other and not get lost in a crowd!<BR>
<BR>
Membership into the M&Ms most often is done in three steps:  <BR>
<A NAME="top"><OL>
<LI>  Submit an application to all of our <A HREF="#list">Recruitment Officers</A> (see below);
<LI>  Visit our gossip channel (generally Channel 9) and become acquainted with our members; <I>This is often done as Step 1</I>
<LI>  Be voted in by our members which is often followed by a &quot;raucus&quot; party!  
</OL>

<BR>
Bear in mind, our guild does not have a lot of rules, but we do have a few ethics which we enforce.  We do not condone PVP nor do we tolerate players who continually pester others for things such as enchantments, perms, or other gifts or come onto our channel begging.  

</FONT></H4>

<BR>
<FONT FACE="comic sans ms"><H3>Step One</H3></FONT></H3>
<FONT FACE="arial"><H4>
Submit an email letter to all of our <A HREF="#list">Recruitment Officers</A>.  In this letter, it would greatly assist us in evaluating your application if you would provide us with your answers to the following questions:</FONT></H4>

<FONT FACE="comic sans ms"><H5>
<OL>
<LI>  Why are you interested in joining the M&amp;M Guild? 
<LI>  How did you hear about us?
<LI>  Please include your email and/or ICQ address
<LI>  How do you feel you can contribute to the Guild?  (i.e.  poetry, friendship,  stories, jokes, ideas, etc)
<LI>  What times of the day are you generally online?
<LI>  What time zone are you in?
<LI>  A little of your Realm Character Information
<LI>  Any bio information you would like to share? We would love to hear your story!
<LI>  Please list any other guilds that you have joined in the past.  
<BR><BR>
Now it's your turn!  Do you have any questions to pose to us about the M&amp;Ms?  Feel free to bombard us with your who's, what's, and wherefore's. <BR>
</FONT></OL></H5>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="comic sans ms"><H3>Step Two</H3></FONT>

<FONT FACE="arial"><H5>
In our Guild, everyone has a say.  Thus, we would like to give all of our members an opportunity to get to know you a bit before making any decision about your membership. 
<BR><BR>
We would request that you join us on gossip channel (usually 9 but is well marked) as often as you can in the near future and introduce yourself as someone who has applied. Our channel is always open to the public and you need not be an applying member to join us.  We can almost always guarantee an "interesting" conversation usually filled with puns -- I mean fun!</FONT></H5>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="comic sans ms"><H3>Step Three</H3></FONT>

<FONT FACE="arial"><H5>
As mentioned previously, we like to keep our membership numbers small so we have a chance to get to really know each other.  So, if there is an opening in our membership, a minimum of three (3) guild members who are not on probation are needed to sponsor you.  If our roster is full, then ten (10) current members are need to sponsor you.   
<BR><BR>
During the summer months, we allow up to 60 days for the 10 sponsors to step forth.  For the rest of the year, this process has a 30-day limit.  And should you not gain acceptance to our Guild within the time limit, you are always welcome to reapply.
<BR><BR>
If you are married to a guild member who has finished probation or if you are a RW sibling (or spouse), you can be automatically admitted as a guild member.
<BR><BR>
If you are accepted into the guild, we will contact you by email (or ICQ if no email address provided) announcing your acceptance.  We try to also announce your membership at our next Sunday meeting. 
<BR><BR>
The first three months are probationary to give each other  a chance to look things over and see if this is a happy union!  If at any time you wish to take a break, just email us and we will list you as inactive.  And if you should decide you wish to leave our ranks, your wish will be honored with no questions asked.  
<BR><BR>
Looking forward to hearing from you.  And again, thank you for your interest in the M&amp;M Guild. </H5><BR><BR>
