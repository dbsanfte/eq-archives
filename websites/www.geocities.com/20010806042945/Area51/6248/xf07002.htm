   <TD ROWSPAN=1 COLSPAN=98 HEIGHT=1750 WIDTH=490  VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"  COLOR=#ffffff>I agree with those of you that say you deserve an answer regarding certain aspects of this game...so I decided to tell you all what
*I know.<BR><BR>A little background:<BR>I have been playing this game since beta 2, and adventured with the great Ozymundius (the founder of the guide program) before he left under questionable circumstances. I then became a guide, and was a member of
the quest, and development team. Recently I quit the program<BR>for obvious reasons (I got tired of the politics and lack of concern for customers from Verant and Guide Staff). In any case, I know a lot of the GM's and some of the original programmers.
<BR>Many of these questions you ask have been around for sometime, and recently (before I left) I decided to disolve many of these rumors, for myself. Knowing that Verant commonly feeds propaganda to it's GM's and the guides, I decided to go the back
door route, and I asked some of the original programmers, the guys that sat in on the many Verant conference calls with Smedley and Mcquaid and Butler. The overall stance by Verant on these things all boils down to one word: Mystery. One of their number one goals (according to many of the programmers) was to preserve the mystery of the game, and it still is.  And I agree with them on this one, STRONGLY, but I do not agree with how they go about handling it. This is why you all get so many different answers. Most just do not know for sure, and many of the things you think are concrete, are actually rumors...started by the Verant Development Team to preserve the Mystery of the game. I will not go into which truths are rumors and what not, but I will dispell some of the rumors that have been discussed here for some time, from what I* know from my "friends". :)<BR>Please keep in mind this is what I have found out after pulling a lot of strings and doing a lot of investigation, it may or may not be wholly true, but I don't think my friends would lie to me...you can make your own judgements. :)<BR><BR>1) The Fiery Avenger<BR>Does not exist to players. One tech told me it was not available to players, it was created by Brad for Brad. No one has ever wielded it, not even in Beta. If they DID, it was a scaled down version, but I seriously doubt it. To justify his possession of the weapon some believe he made up the story about it being a quest. People say it is the most powerful weapon in the game, but it isn't, because it isn't in the game, and I doubt it ever will be. Hell, not until about 3 months ago, there weren't even any Dragons. I was there when the first Vox fell on Veeshan as a guest, to watch the show. Even though Aradune said he did not assist in any way, he actually did, and there were screenshots posted to prove it. It was somewhat of a contoversy. When the screenshots went public and it got back to Verant, Smedley was not very happy about it, and Brad admitted he did step in against Vox, and apologized profusely, stating that he got so caught up in the combat, he stepped in without thinking...you know, I can understand that, I can give the guy a break, he is one of the main creators of this game,  he can have a few "goodies".<BR>In any case, many believe that we as players will never wield the FA...I agree with them.<BR><BR>(UPDATE - Since the publication of this editorial, Brad Mcquaid has stated publicly that they are going to implement the Fiery Avenger Quest and make it easier, since no one has gotten one in 7 months.  We shall see.)<BR><BR>2) Green Splinted Platemail<BR>Does not exist. One person told me that it is on the Fear Plane and is Bard only armor. I don't know if I agree or not, but I will tell you this...when on the Veeshan watching Vox go down, I inspected Aradune, and it was not Green Splinted Plate he was wearing, but "Green Iron Platemail". You can make your own assumptions on this one.<BR><BR>3) 25% XP bonus for full
parties.<BR>Yes...but it is NOT a bonus per say. 25% more XP is ADDED with a full party so that all members could get more an equal share. It would be the same if it was a party of 5...the 25% is added to give the 6th person more of an equal share. Also,
keep in mind, there is a 25% XP BONUS for all XP obtained in Dungeon Zones (Cazic Thule, Guk, Najena...etc). Not many people know that one.<BR><BR>4) Spawn Rates<BR>A very touchy subject here. Here is what I found out...recently the spawn rate for
Very Rare Item Mobs (Rubicite...Ghoulbane...etc) was increased to 45 minutes, for Rare item dropping monsters, 17 minutes. But it will never be completely accurate because as more people enter a zone, more monsters are killed, and the computer
compensates by upping the spawn rate for the increased demand of people in the zone. Even though there are spawn rates, it is all RANDOMLY generated by the server computer...I will say it again..RANDOMLY. ;) For example I have been told the odds for the
Templar to drop the Ruby Greaves is 1:8. Unless the computer happens to roll a one on the spawn generation, then there will be no ruby dropped by that creature. All named and special very rare item dropping mobs have a certain numeric number range, if
that range is not generated within the set spawn rate, something else will spawn in it's place. :) You can sit on the spawn spot, and it won't make a difference in the world, unless the computer hits the specific numeric range for that creature. :)
Chance, thats the name of the game. ;)<BR><BR>I hope this helps and clears a couple of things up for you guys...::smile::</FONT></TD>
