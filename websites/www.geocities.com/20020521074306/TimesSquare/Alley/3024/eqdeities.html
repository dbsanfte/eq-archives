<p>During the character creation process, one is asked to select a deity who will protect and guide the character.  Although one may select to be an Agnostic and not follow any deity, the effects of a chosen deity on the character's life may serve to the character's benefit or detriment in subtle ways. The developer tells us that the choice of deity is a very important one.  Choosing a deity with affinity to your character and class will make a difference as your life in Norrath progresses.  For example, the affinity of The Prince of Hate to a Dwarf Paladin would not be as complimentary as to a Dark Elf Necromancer. This is due to the nature of the deity coupled with the race and class of the character.  Consequently, that same Dwarf Paladin, would be much better off serving The Duke of Below or Erolissi Marr.  This guide provides information on the nature of each deity and how it may work with various races and classes. Unfortunately, not much has been documented regarding character/deity interaction. I will share with you just one observation.  My character is a High Elf Wizard who chose Solusek Ro "The Burning Prince" as her deity.  Although I may be totally wrong, I find that my wizard is an ace with Fire type spells, even when these are newly learned.  Could there be a connection?  Could Solusek Ro smile and make my spells not fizzle as much when I use his element?  I suspect that there may be:)<br>
<br>
<center>BERTOXXULLOUS The Plaguebringer</center><br>
<br>
<p>This deity may be useful to those with characters belonging to the evil races or classes.  He likes death and disease.  Such combinations would include Dark Elf Necromancers or Troll ShadowKnights for example.<br>

<br>
<center>BRELL SERILIS The Duke of Below</center><br>
<br>
Dwarves, Gnomes and all races that live underground may find his favor an asset.  Perhaps those characters that would like to develop metalworking abilities may find him to be a boost.<br>
<br>
<center>BRISTLEBANE Fizzlethorpe The King of Thieves</center><br>
<br>
As his name suggests, all Rogues would make a good congregation at this deity's temples.<br>
<br>
<center>CAZIC-THULE The Faceless</center><br>
<br>
Relishing death, violence and destruction, this deity would probably attract the evil races and classes.<br>
<br>
<center>EROLISSI MARR The Queen of Love</center><br>
<br>
She loves Norrath and wishes to preserve its virtues.  She smites anything that threatens the Peace and Well Being of the good citizens of Norrath.  She is said to bless the path of Paladins.<br>
<br>
<center>INNORUUK The Prince of Hate</center><br>
<br>
Hate is his creative force. Hate provides power and perseverence.
Innoruuk is the Patron Deity of the Dark Elves.<br>
<br>
<center>KARANA The Rainkeeper</center><br>
<br>
This benevolent storm deity seems to be tied to the forces of nature. He would be evoked by Druids, and Shaman.
<br>
<center>MITHANIEL MARR The Lightbringer</center><br>
<br>
His affinity to the virtues of truth, honor, valor and charity would attract Paladins and Warriors to his temples.<br>
<br>
<center>PREXXUS The Ocean Lord</center><br>
<br>
He rules the depths of the ocean.  He probably would have an affinity to those who travel the seas, or who like to swim?  Perhaps we will know more once those rumored underwater cities are uncovered.<pr>
<br>
<center>QUELLIOS The Traquil</center><br>
<br>
This deity sponsors inner peace and knowledge of self.  His nature suggests followers in the Shaman and Druid ranks.  His temple, however, is in Erudin.  Perhaps he may favor Erudites also.<br>
<br>
<center>RALLOS ZEK The Warlord</center><br>
<br>
I would be willing to bet that his congregation includes many a warrior:)<br>
<br>
<center>RODCET NIFE The Prime Healer</center><br>
<br>
His name suggests to me Clerics, Bards and all the healing classes of the benvolent races.<br>
<br>
<center>SOLUSEK RO The Burning Prince</center><br>
<br>
His followers believe in the raw power of Fire and fearlessness toward enemies.  His nature suggests a strong affinity with Wizards:)
<br>
<center>THE TRIBUNAL The Six Hammers</center><br>
<br>
Justice and Retribution is his dogma.  His followers must abide by his values.  This suggests Warriors and Paladins as close followers.<br>
<br>
<center>TUNARE The Mother of All</center><br>
<br>
As the mother, she wants the children of Norrath to thrive in her blessing.  She is benevolent and bountiful.  Her followers would include Druids, Rangers and particularly Wood and High Elves.<br>
<br>
<center>Veeshan The Wurm Queen</center><br>
<br>
She is said to be a Dragon and as such, the Dragons follow her.  She is known to have humanoid followers too.  Although she regards them with disdain, she is said to reward loyalty with great riches. This is all I know about her.<br>
