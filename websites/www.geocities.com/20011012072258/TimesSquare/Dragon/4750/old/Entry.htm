</B></FONT><P>We hope you enjoy your visit. EQRPA is dedicated to providing a fun stable roleplaying environment for all players of Everquest. We are currently in the development stages as an organization, and thus are looking for many people to...</P>

<UL>
<LI>Become members - Any organization needs members. If you: want to roleplay, will follow the Rules and Regulation, commit to at least a couple of hours a week playtime, and will participate in feedback/surveys and sponsored events - then we want you! Should you be uncertain but interested, give us a few hours a week and see how you like it... if its not for you then you may leave the association. </LI>
<LI>Become Chroniclers - Chroniclers is the EQRPA version of GMs and Guides. As a Chronicler, you will need to make a much larger time commitment than the average member. Not only will you maintain in-game personalities to sponsor events and hand out dynamic quests, but you will participate in the co-ordination of events outside of the game. Details for becoming a Chronicler will be posted soon. </LI>
<LI>Beautify our web page - Do you have a talent which could help our web page out? Perhaps you have a knack for web page design, or maybe you're a graphics design artist - any and all submissions are welcome. We can always use skilled people.</LI></UL>

Now that it is up an running, we look forward to members and non-members alike submitting their roleplaying backgrounds for posting.  Happy gaming to all!&nbsp;</P>
