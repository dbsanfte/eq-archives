<H4>For some of us, having alittle news ahead of time can be beneficial.  In this section, we will be posting special notes from Stephen and current "What's New" as concerns any patches.
<BR><BR>
 Also, if it would be of any assistance, I can make all patches and special files available through links from this page.  Just drop me a note below and let me know if this would be of interest to anyone.

<FONT COLOR="brown"><I>January 10, 1998, What's New:</I></FONT></H4>
<H5>We have isolated and fixed a major cause of server instability.  It was caused by a magical item that was invalid at the time of use.  We are not exactly sure how the magical item got that way, but we coded around it so that the crash would not persist.  Sorry for the nasty crashes.  We will continue to track and fix any further instabilities.</H5>

<FONT COLOR="brown"><I>January 9, 1998, Message from Stephen:</I></FONT></H4>
<H5>INFORMATION:  Now that we have the new RAM installed, we are tracking some other server stability issues.  To that end, we will be running the server in a special debug mode that may modify the performance of the game a bit.  This mode will provide us with the information necessary to track and solve the server stability problems.  Thanks for your patience as we fix this problem.</H5>

<H5>Sorry for all the downtime today.  There were a few network failures on the NET that caused quite a few problems.  We have also been tracking a nasty server crash and I think we got it this evening.</H5>

<H5>We have finally installed our gigabyte of RAM today and have increased the total number of connections to 3000 and increased the total number of dungeons that may spawn. </H5>

<H5>WHAT A LET DOWN:  We received the new GIGABYTE of RAM on 01/02/98.  I drove to San Jose (a 3 hour tour) to install the new memory into the server.  Once I arrived at the server, I gingerly removed the dual processor motherboard from the chassis and eagerly removed the new memory from it's protective anti-static bags.  Once I began the process of installing this new memory, I was horrified ... the new memory is the incorrect size of chip to fit into our system!  So, here I sit on the floor of our colocation site at Exodus typing this message in disgust.  Needless to say, the new memory did not make it into the machine yet.  We will have to give our supplier a hard time for providing us the wrong type of RAM.</H5>

<BR>
<H4><FONT COLOR="brown"><I>January 2, 1998, From Stephen: </I></FONT></H4>
<H5>PLEASE READ:  We have received our GIGABYTE of RAM today (1/2/98) and will be installing it tomorrow (1/3/98).  Please expect a few hours of downtime around 9:00 am PST to 2:00 pm PST on 1/3/98 as this process is carried out.  This should obliterate the majority of the server-based lag that has been annoying you for the last few weeks.  Also, after this downtime, the dungeon spawns will be opened up again so say goodbye to the line jumpers.</H5>

<BR>
<H4><FONT COLOR="brown"><I>January 2, 1998 at 3:30pm PST, "What's New":</I></FONT></H4>
<H5>We have made a few updates to the server and client today.  The list is<BR> as follows:
<BR><BR>
<OL>
<LI>  Our final implementations of the enchant item and permanency spells have been completed.  This final implementation takes into account your intelligence, meditation skill and sorcery skill when determining success of these spells.  The base formula for success is 10 percent times your skill in sorcery.  This percentage is modified by your spell damage modifier and the number of enchantments on the target item.  For example, if Bob has grand master sorcery (level 5) and has a spell damage modified of +100 and is trying to cast Enchant Item on a weapon he will have a 90 percent chance of success at the first enchantment.  (The maximum success chance is capped at 90 percent).  For each permanent enchantment on the item, Bob's chance would decrease by 30 points.  The percentage chance of destroying an item when casting these spells has been dropped to 1 in 5 instead of 1 in 2 on a failure.  This change was necessary due to the increasing number of enchanted items being created in the game.
<BR><BR>
<LI>  The percentage increase in cost to repair an enchanted item went from 15 percent per enchantment to 10 percent per enchantment.
<BR><BR>
<LI>  The Spell Blast spell was modified to be intelligence based.  In other words, if a low intelligence player tried to Spell Blast a high intelligence player, he will be less likely to succeed.
<BR><BR>
<LI>  The Death Wish spell was modified to take the caster's Necromancy skill into consideration.  The chance of success is equal to 10 percent times the modified skill of the caster.  This should put a damper on low-intelligence warriors using this spell as successfully as high-intelligence mages.
<BR><BR>
<LI>  We have upped the spawn rates in both the Killing Fields and the Forest of Death.  Groups should be more concentrated in those areas as well.
<BR><BR>
<LI>  You can no longer pick the pocket of a dead player.
<BR><BR>
<LI>  We have implemented a governer to the number of items that can be crafted by a player.  This is how it works:  Each player has been given an invisible attribute called stamina.  (You can see how much stamina you have by typing "/stamina").  This attribute is like your health attribute insomuch as you "spend" it to make items.  Each time you craft an item, your stamina will be decreased.  The amount of decrease depends on the difficulty of the item being made.  The higher the difficulty, the most stamina it costs.  Also, be aware that making items above your skill level will use much more stamina than items within your 
ability.  Your stamina automatically regenerates at the rate of one point per two-minutes of real time.  This means that your stamina will regenerate even when you are not playing the game.  When your stamina runs out, you will no longer be able to craft items of any kind until you regain enough stamina points to afford the item you wish to make.  This has been implemented to combat the constant level gaining that some players have done by making tons of items for hours on end.<BR><BR>
PLEASE BE AWARE THAT ALL EXISTING CHARACTERS STAMINA STARTS AT ZERO AND WILL INCREASE OVER TIME<BR><BR>
<LI>  We have fixed a few more problems with the client software that caused some Hideous Fatal Errors.
<BR><BR>
<LI>  We have added some more monster types for you to find.  And we will be implementing some more high-level dungeons next week.
<BR><BR>
<LI>  Our conversion to DirectX has been delayed until we can perform some more configuration testing on it to make sure that the transition will be as painless as possible.</H5></OL>

<BR><BR>
<H4><FONT COLOR="brown"><I>January 1, 1998, letter from Stephen:</I></FONT></H4>
<H5>All:  <BR>
<BR>
In an effort to remove the use of mouse-driving macros that quite a few players have used in the past, we are making the following changes to the game that may require you to update your system.  We will be incorporating a new technology provided by Microsoft called DirectInput.  This technology will allow The Realm to directly read the position and button information from your mouse and basically ignore any mouse clicks generated from any foreign program.  This wil obliterate any programs like "Auto Player" that scan the screen for things to click on and then click the mouse for you.<BR>
<BR>
Now, the bad news, ;)  This modification will require everyone to acquire a copy of DirectX.  You can do so by visiting Microsoft's web site at www.microsoft.com/msdownload/directx5/directx5.htm.  This page provides all the instructions necessary to install DirectX.  If you already have a version of DirectX on your
machine, you do not have to do anything to take advantage of this upgrade.<BR>
<BR>
The client change to take advantage of DirectInput will happen on Friday, January 2nd 1998.</H5>
<H4><FONT COLOR="brown">NOTE:  If anyone needs an "English" version of DirectX, please drop me a note (<A HREF="mailto:QuinTessAnce<slewis@lightspeed.net>?Subject=DirectX">QuinTessAnce</A>) and I'll add this to my file links from this page.</H4></FONT>
