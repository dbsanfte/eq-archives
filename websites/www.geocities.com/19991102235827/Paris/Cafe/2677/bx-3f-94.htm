<p><font size=5><strong>Hicks: Loss of an Uncompromising Artist</strong></font><strong><br>
</strong><em><strong>The Los Angeles Times, March 4, 1994</strong></em><strong><br>
<br>
When Calendar runs a piece acknowledging the passing of a significant artist or 
entertainer -- like comedian Bill Hicks, who died of pancreatic cancer Saturday at 
age 32 -- it's typically authored by a writer with particular expertise, not a member of 
that person's management team. <br>
<br>
Along with my partner, Colleen McGarr, I managed Hicks for the better part of a 
year, but before going into management a half decade ago, I spent several years 
covering comedy for The Times and other publications. So I may be in a singular 
position to reflect on Hicks. <br>
<br>
I had long felt Hicks was one of the two or three best comedians to take a stage in 
the last decade, an uncompromising artist of enormous intelligence, insight and 
command of language -- a provocateur with a razor-sharp point of view, shot through 
with irony, and one whose performances were consistently inspired and inspiring. <br>
<br>
I became a bona fide fanatic years ago, seizing every opportunity to see any Hicks 
show I could. For those who were less fanatical, a Hicks show could be trying, and on 
any given night some percentage of the audience would walk out, outraged by what 
they heard. For many years -- he started doing stand-up at 15 -- that was because 
portions of his act involved formulating explicit treatises that heartily embraced the 
sexual and the scatological. <br>
<br>
Within the last year or so, as he further honed his vision, that element played a 
smaller and smaller role. This is hardly to suggest that he became a cuddly, 
user-friendly, dime-a-dozen comic trafficking in glib observations about airline travel 
and fast-food joints. Virtually any type of hypocrisy became target for a Hicksian 
smart bomb. While now only traces of his material were X-rated, his modus operandi 
was every bit as challenging to the audience as he tackled such topics as 
anti-abortion activists, Fundamental Christianity and the Waco siege. <br>
<br>
Now, on any given night, the most common audience response was to beget a slew of 
new Hicks fanatics, from college students to their grandparents. Professional 
reviewers expressed considerable enthusiasm. Gerald Nachman, theater critic for 
the San Francisco Chronicle, wrote in a July review that &quot;he's as original, caustic and 
challenging as were Lenny Bruce, Mort Sahl and Richard Pryor in their day.&quot; Critic 
John Lahr was only four sentences into a nine-page profile of Hicks in the Nov. 1 
issue of The New Yorker before calling him &quot;an exhilarating comic thinker in a 
renegade class all his own.&quot; <br>
<br>
But these and plenty of similar superlatives didn't even hint at the breadth of Hicks' 
talent, which finally had found myriad outlets in recent months. He had created &quot;The 
Counts of the Netherworld,&quot; a show for England's Channel 4 that he would write and 
star in, and that surely would have been viewed as a pioneering piece of television 
programming. A fistful of publishing houses were courting him. He had been asked to 
start contributing columns to The Nation. He had written a few screenplays, was in 
the midst of a provocative new script and already had the ideas together for the next 
one. He was a gifted guitarist-songwriter, and while he had released two conventional 
comedy CDs, he had recently recorded two more, but these featured the innovation 
of a musical score that he composed and played. <br>
<br>
And while it shook him deeply last October to have his 12th Letterman appearance 
entirely censored, it almost seemed to redouble his interest in exploring alternative 
ways to present his primary art: There were discussions with John Magnuson, who 
directed the Lenny Bruce concert film -- and who, upon seeing his first Hicks show in 
July had become a fanatic -- about doing a similar movie with Hicks. <br>
<br>
As these things were coming together, his dream became to buy a house where he 
could hole up and write the book, screenplay and columns, compose and play music, 
work on his records and get a dog named Lester. As dreams go, it was a relatively 
simple one, and Colleen and I desperately wanted to make it come true, especially 
when it appeared he was making a medically unprecedented triumph over the cancer. <br>
<br>
People liked to be around Hicks, to do things for him. I was drawn to him just as 
much personally as professionally. For as extraordinary and inspirational as Bill 
Hicks was as an artist, he was equally so as a human being: uncommonly bright, 
intuitive, perceptive, emotionally direct, charming, amazingly well-read, insightful and 
capable of tremendous warmth and love once he trusted you. If he liked and trusted 
you, and you had an endearing quirk or two, so much the better. <br>
<br>
It turned out that over the months we worked together, he had noticed -- I hadn't -- 
that when he delivered some weird or wild news, I had a tendency to respond by 
saying, &quot;Oh my God,&quot; in something resembling a Valley Girl inflection. Once he 
pointed out this tendency, I naturally became quite self-conscious and tried to resist 
saying the phrase, while he subtly tried to bait me into saying it. One of the last times 
we spoke, he called rather discouraged about something career-related. And when he 
told me, I was shocked, and I did say it. He instantly perked up, gleefully noting, &quot;I 
got an 'Oh my God' out of you!&quot; It made him so happy. <br>
<br>
I'd give anything for him to still be able to bait me that way. There were so many 
things he didn't have the opportunity to do. He didn't even have a chance to get the 
dog. <br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure Lester would have thought Bill Hicks was amazing and would have 
loved him intensely. I know we all did. <br>
