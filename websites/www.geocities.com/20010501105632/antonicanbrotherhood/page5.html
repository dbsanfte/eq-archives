Paulos the warrior, a man of great power and skill, bravely fought like a true fighter, mastering his weapons in a battle til the end. Tikibuku the ranger, led the group with his excellent tracking and mapping knowledge. He acted as guide and a great tank and served his role most well. Dellara the druid and Zersh the rogue joined to take on a nearby room. With a druids buffs and the skills of a rogue, they prevailed as a powerful team, destroying all in their path. Later as the night progressed and the icy winds blew, they were all joined by Quinath the ranger, Derithon the wizard, Hammon the paladin and Sabalon the warrior who all displayed great skill and courage in expulsing the evil creatures of Permafrost.</span></font></td>

He kindly agreed to give up his time to experience ressurect his guildmates in Splitpaw. While those who died made their way back from their binding points, Derithon self-ported to Vellious to pick up Kabrom and port him back to Splitpaw. Paulos was first back on scene, and soon after receiving an invis off guildmate Skyware, he set off to locate his corpse. He came across his corpse but as he was dragging it back, his invisibility wore off. He found he was surrounded by gnolls with no armour or weapon. With this he had to camp and log on with his druid Taloc. He arrived at Splitpaw and cast camoflauge on Sabalon, who then dragged out Paulos's corpse. In turn as more members arrived, each corpse was dragged out and ressurected by Kabrom at the zone. Until the end, every part of the guild raid was fully organised, well planned and thought out. Apart from the deaths, the guild achieved their mission objective, and all those who turned up deserved top credit for a most fun and successful raid ever held..<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Paulosio Shadowhawkio-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chief Reporter</span></font></td>

Group one consisted of Derithon, Sabalon, Budweis, Venau, Caning and Skyware, with Derithon as Leader and Evacer, and Budweis as main group leader. Group two was headed by Paulos, along with Quinath, Dhakkon, Elventrackr, Temijin and Aracely, Temijin was main healer and evacer and also kept health checks on group one by assisting Budweis. Everyone was briefed and all the raid details were finalised. Upon the word go, the all powerful army marched across the wide plains of Karana until they reached the tunnel that would take them into Splitpaw. Paulos and Quinath headed operations and used guild talk to communicate the two groups. After a final group status check......they moved in. Everyone made their way to the doors which led to the bridge room. All were prepared for their first battle, but wait.....? group one had lost their leader. Of all the tricks and traps in Splipaw, Derithon had managed to find the worst one. He was trapped between an outcropping rock and the ceiling. No amount of movement could free him, and no-one possessed the power to help him. After a quick discussion, Derithon decided to port out to the nearest spire and then make the run back to Splitpaw, this time avoiding the trap!!!!</span></font></td>

Upon reaching a clearing, they took a breather and rested by the waters edge. It wasn't long before they were disturbed by two high level snakes which hit with a lethal poison, of which took five casts to cure. After the short battle, everyone cooled off and took a little swim. Paulos was much excited at the thought of seeing the female high elfs and wood elfs in wet clothes...bah ! what a loser haha. From here they proceeded to the deepest part of the lair and shortly arrived in the executioners room. After destroying all enemies, they sat and discussed their next move. They decided to make their way back and hunt out the gnoll Ischva (a named gnoll which dropped an expensive robe.) On route there, they encountered a dangerous and fierce battle, unfortunately losing one member. Here they rested, mourning the loss of Budweis. Paulos was given the task of dragging her corpse to the zone. When they arrived at the Ischva gnoll room, they found it to be camped. It was getting late, and after a successful raid they decided to fight their way back to the zone, unknowingly aware of the grave danger that lay ahead.</span></font></td>
