To answer that, let me relate the story of our family, and how we came to be.<BR><BR><BR></FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#CC0000"
 FACE="Times New Roman,Times,Times NewRoman">Originally, our home was a verdant forest that rivaled the majesty of even the Faydarks. In the center of our forest laid Fyrelake…named for the blazing reflection it gave with each setting of the sun. Like our cousins in Kelethin, we lived high up in the trees…our only enemies the occasional rabid wolf or bear. Even our neighbors in Neriak let us be…and it was good.<BR><BR>Time rolled on, and we were a happy people…until the gods grew bored. 
Eventually, Solusek Ro turned his gaze our way. He was not happy that Tunare's people had such an expanse to live in…and Tunare was kept busy defending both the Faydarks and our home. Solusek's seat of power was underground, very near to Fyrelake. Sadly, Tunare was forced to keep her attention on the Faydarks as the Burning Prince corrupted our beloved woods. First, the ground split…and the molten lava flowed. Trees burned, Fyrelake dried up…but we held on to hope. We repaired what we 
could…and it almost seemed like we were keeping up.<BR><BR>That's when Solusek released his minions….<BR><BR>Fire imps and goblins, elementals and dervishes…we were no match for them. Skilled in forest lore and hunting, we were no warriors, compared to these summoned beasts. Elves were slaughtered in great numbers.<BR><BR>The tribal elders then made the most difficult decision of their lives.<BR><BR>The trybe was split up, and scattered throughout Norrath. The elders' own children were taught 
the lore and history, so that they might pass it down and their heritage never be forgotten. With this lore came instructions…when the time was safe, they were to gather the lost family, and retake their ancestral home. But for now…preservation was in flight.<BR><BR>Generations passed…and the elves mingled with the various peoples that they found sanctuary with. Some took relief from their cousins in Faydark, others with the solid dwarves of the Butcherblock Mountains…some with the dark 
cousins in Neriak, still others with the barbarians of Halas. It's been said that some even found solace with the Trolls and Ogres of the swamps…<BR><BR>Free from immediate harm, these elves did what anyone would…the settled down, fell in love, raised families…as often as not with people outside of the tribe.<BR><BR>Still more generations passed…bringing us to today…where I lead the found family members in our quest to find the rest of our kin. How do we know that that human cleric, or that 
dwarven paladin has Fyrelake blood in them? That I can't answer…we just do. But they are just as important to us as any other FLEA. That's how "non elves" come to be FLEA's.<BR><BR><BR>…and soon…the Lavastorm Mountains will be renamed….<BR>&nbsp;<P ALIGN=LEFT>Saybr Mul'Nuar - 52 and counting... <BR><I><FONT COLOR="Green"><marquee direction=right>Have you hugged a tree today?</I></FONT></Marquee></FONT>&nbsp;<P ALIGN=LEFT><BR><IMG ID="Picture56" HEIGHT=193 WIDTH=400
