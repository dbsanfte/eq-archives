<center><i><h1> Felwithe Quest's </center></i></h1><p>
<center><i><h2>Bandit Sisters</center></i></h2><p>
This starts in Felwithe with the High Elf Paladin
Guildmaster.  He will ask you  if you are "ready to serve the Clerics of Tunare"  Say "I am ready to serve the Clerics of Tunare" and he will ask if you are new to this or experienced (something to that degree).  If you say you are inexperienced,  he tells you about a fallen member of his order in Kelethin.   (If you say you are experienced, he gives you the jojongua's pelt quest).   You then need to talk to the drunk named Tandan Nybright in Kelethin and listen to his tale.  His sad story centers around his four daughters in Lesser Faydark who have joined the dervish cutthrouat and are giving his
family a bad name.  Being a good father and paladin, he asks you to murder each of his daughters, retrieve their pearl necklaces and return them to him all at once.  Beware.  These bandits are pretty tough and will not willingly part with their jewelry (approximately level 10 to 13).  You will get experience, faction and an item when you return all four necklaces.<p>
<center><i><h2> Bat Wings </center></i></h2><p>
The Magician's guildmaster, Niola Impholder, is researching a spell and needs some bat wings, 4 actually.  Get them
for her and you will recieve faction, experience and a spell scroll.<p>
<center><i><h2> Black Wolf Skin </center></i></h2><p>
The Wizard guildmaster Tarker Blazetoss needs a black wolf skin for a spell.  Return one to him and gain faction, experience and a minor item, sometimes a spell.  Faction will change
as follows:  increase for Keepers of the Art, King Thearisthex,
Faydarks Champions, and decrease for The Dead.<p>
<center><i><h2> Enchanted Longbow </center></i></h2><p>
Talk to Kinool Goldsinger in the Enchanter Guild  and ask him
"Where can I get an Enchanted Trueshot Bow?"  Go throught the
dialog with him and you find that you need Faerie Dust (created by the fairy princess), Treant Heart, [ Treant Wood is dropped by
Treants, but a ranger shouldn't attack a Treant.  Instead, you can get this by giving lanterns to Jyle Wyndshot in the hogcallers inn in Freeport (which you did for the trueshot bow quest) and about every fourth lantern or so he gives you a heart instead of treant wood] your TS Bow, and 3000gp.  The bow is called the Rain Caller. <img src="http://everquest.gamestats.com/equipment/graphics7/raincaller.GIF"><p>
<center><i><h2> The Falchion </center></i></h2><p>
This quest is given after you complete the Orc Runner Quest.  The Paladin Lord, Lord Jyleel, in the basement of the Paladin's guild wants you to [prove yourself a faithful paladin of the court].  He asks you to present him  3 things to prove this, and
you shall wield "The falchion", a paladin only  weapon.  Bring him the heart of Dvinn, find the supreme caster of the orcs, and also find the supply crate at the supply drop point from the orcs to the Tier'dal.   Killing D'Vinn in Crushbone gets you his heart and killing the orc prophet in Crushbone gets you a blue orc head.   The crate is dropped by Brarm in the Ocean of Tears.  He is about level 22 and spawns once per game day at 5am with 2 dark elf dragoons(approximately level 18 to 22) on the rocks with the Sirens just as you enter the Ocean of Tears from Faydwer.  Bring the items back to Lord Jyleel and he will give you a Falchion of Koada'Vie. <img src="http://everquest.gamestats.com/equipment/graphics6/falchionofKoada.JPG"><p>
<center><i><h2> Illegible scroll </center></i></h2><p>
Lord Jyleel will ask you to bring him an illegible
scroll,  which can be found, among other places, on the Crushbone
Orc Oracles.  <p>
<center><i><h2> Jojongua's Pelt </center></i></h2><p>
The Felwithe Paladin guildmaster will ask you if you
are "ready to serve the Clerics of Tunare" if you hail him. Say "I am ready to serve the Clerics of Tunare" and he will ask if you are new to this or experienced (something to that degree).  If you say you are inexperienced, you get the Tandan Nybright quest.  However, if you say you have been with them for awhile (or whatever  [xxxx] line equates to that) he will give you a quest to go to Innothule Swamp and slay Jojoojojgogogoguna, the long-named huge Kobold lord in the aptly named Jojongua's Tower. Take his pelt to the guildmaster.<p>
<center><i><h2> Orc Runner </center></i></h2><p>
 Talk to the Paladin Lord, General Jyleel, in the
basement of the Paladin guild in Felwithe.  Occasionally an Orc
Runner can be seen running from the entrance to Greater Faydark
along the path towards the crossroads.  He is relatively tough (be at least level 8 if you want to solo him), but usually will yield a sealed letter and a pouch upon his death.  Take the letter to the Paladin Lord.  Give it to him to receive a faction bonus and the quest for the falchion.<p>
