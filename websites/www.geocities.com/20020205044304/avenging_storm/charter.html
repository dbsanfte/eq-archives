SIZE="4" COLOR="#CCCCFF">Code of Conduct</FONT></A></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once you become a member
of Avenging Storm, your actions reflect on all other members of the guild.
Please remember to act accordingly and with respect for other players as a good
reputation will encourage players with positive attitudes to seek
membership.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><FONT
COLOR="blue">Be respectful.</FONT></B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is understood that
disputes will arise between people. You must, however, remember to handle
yourself in a manner befitting a member of Avenging Storm. Try to resolve the
disagreement so that both parties are satisfied. If you are unsure of what you
should do in a particular situation, feel free to contact an officer for
guidance.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If a situation arises
which directly involves another guild (not merely a member of another guild),
<I>contact a guild officer immediately</I>. One of the duties of an officer is
to help resolve intra-guild disputes.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you have a dispute
with another guild member, please try to resolve it in tells. <I>Do not air
grievances against another guild member in guild chat, regardless of whether or
not that person is online at the time. </I>If you are unable to resolve the
dispute, contact a guild officer for help.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><FONT
COLOR="blue">Be helpful.</FONT></B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This does not mean you
must donate fine plate armor to newbies outside of Qeynos. What this does mean
is that, if you encounter someone in need of assistance and you can provide
this assistance without serious risk or inconvenience to yourself or another
guild member, you should do your best to help him or her.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><FONT

<P><FONT COLOR="#CCCCFF"
FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Spells:</FONT><FONT
FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Members are <I>strongly
</I>encouraged to provide whatever magical assistance they can to other guild
members for free. The exceptions to this rule are teleports (you may choose to
charge a reduced rate or teleport for free) or spells which require costly
components (in which case you may charge a guild member the cost of said
component).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#CCCCFF" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Trade
skills:</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Whenever
possible, items should be produced for guild members at cost. This does not
mean you must absorb the cost of failures, but please use discretion when
determining how much to charge a guild member for a particular item.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#CCCCFF"
FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Buying/selling:</FONT><FONT
FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Selling items that you do not
need to guild members that could find a use for them is strongly encouraged.
Always charge fair prices to guild members, and you are encouraged to offer a
&quot;guild discount&quot; whenever possible. The better equipped a member is,
the better chance he or she has of growing in experience so that he or she may
then help newer members when the opportunity presents itself.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><FONT

      <P><FONT COLOR="#CCCCFF" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Guild 
        dues:</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Guild 
        dues are completly donations and optional donations can be given to any 
        guild officer (who will keep track of the money given to him or her each 
        month). Giving donations are very important as it allows us to aid members 
        and put better guild events. There are plans in progress to expand the 
        scope of what dues may be used for.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#CCCCFF" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Guild 
        meetings:</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Are 
        basically when the guild feels one is needs as one per month is attemped. 
        The place for the most part will vary but mostly just be in guild chat. 
        In meeting everyone is encouraged to partake. We love to hear from everyone.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><FONT

<P><FONT COLOR="#CCCCFF"
FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Anonymity:</FONT><FONT
FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We ask that guild members do not
enter anonymous status as we are proud of all of our members and hope, in turn,
that all members are proud to be a member of the guild. You may choose to use
roleplay status, esp. if you do not wish to be contacted for class-specific
services (ex. teleportation, resurrection, corpse location, etc.).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#CCCCFF" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Guild
inquiries:</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> If you are
asked by another character about Avenging Storm, please share with them the
positive experiences you have had with us. Make them aware of the new member
guidelines and encourage them to visit the guild web site for more information.
<I>Never talk about Avenging Storm with a character from another guild with the
intent of convincing them to change guilds unless that person has expressed an
interest in changing.</I></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><A NAME="members"><FONT
SIZE="4" COLOR="#CCCCFF">New Members</FONT></A> </FONT> </P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Avenging Storm is
interested in growing and providing a sense of family and friendship to new
members who would seek to uphold our ideals and fulfill our purpose. We do,
however, have several guidelines for new members which are strictly
enforced:</FONT></P>
<OL>
<LI><FONT COLOR="red" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Level
14 or Above</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><BR>
          Applicants must have attained level 14 or above to be considered for 
          admission. This is to ensure that guild members are experienced enough 
          in gameplay to be productive and capable of participating fully. Alternate 
          characters up to 3 are allowed to be any level from 1 to 60. Having 
          5 to 8 characters in the guild all your character must be at least level 
          14 so you can have 8 in the guild but all at least 14. </FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><FONT
COLOR="red">Good Alignment</FONT></B><BR>
Avenging Storm is a good guild and, as such, members are required to be of good
alignment. This does not mean we will not accept members from an evil race
(Dark Elf, Iksar, Ogre, or Troll) or of an evil class (Necromancer, Rogue, or
Shadowknight), but applicants of these races and/or classes will be examined
more closely than applicants of a race or class which is conventionally not
evil. Avenging Storm does not, under any circumstances, admit player killers.
This philosophy goes against the ideals and purposes of our guild.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><FONT
COLOR="#FFFF99">Active Characters</FONT></B><BR>
          Any character seeking admission must be the primary or secondary character 
          of any player. We do not allow more than four characters per player 
          as we prefer our members to be as active as possible. Secondary characters 
          seeking admission are exempt <I>only from </I>the level requirement, 
          which there is one for alternates. All other requirements must be fulfilled.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#FFFF99"
FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Officer
Interviews</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><BR>
Applicants will first be referred to a Guild Officer who will conduct a
preliminary interview to insure that he or she is suitable to be admitted to
the guild. Please be prepared to discuss your reasons for wanting to join and
what you are able to bring to the guild as a member. Upon completion of this
interview they will fill out an application on our web site.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><FONT
COLOR="#FFFF99">Guild Application</FONT></B><BR>
          Characters seeking admission to Avenging Storm <I>must</I> fill out 
          a <A HREF="application.html">guild application</A> for review by guild 
          leader, Kindoz Truart. A copy-and-pasteable version of the application 
          is available <A HREF="application2.html">here</A> for those whose computers 
          are not configured to make use of html forms. Please note that the contents 
          of your application (with the exception of your sponsors and the reason 
          you wish to join) will be posted as your member profile if you are admitted 
          to the guild. Real life friends of current guild members and alternate 
          characters need only to fill out an application and include an indication 
          of such.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><FONT
COLOR="#FFFF99">Guild Leader Interview</FONT></B><BR>
If all of the above criteria are met satisfactorily, the applicant will then be
interviewed by Guild Leader Kindoz. If Kindoz is away for an announced,
extended period of time and will not be available to conduct the guild leader
interview, another officer may serve in his place.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><FONT
COLOR="#FFFF99">Exceptions</FONT></B><BR>
          All people wishing to be members of Avenging Storm must complete the 
          above process, with the exception of those people invited &quot;on-the-spot&quot; 
          by Guild Leader Kindoz.</FONT></LI>
</OL>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once a new member has
been admitted to the guild, he or she will enter a 2-week trial-period, during
which time he or she will be closely observed to ensure that he or she is
fulfilling the role of an Avenging Storm member. You will be notified of when
this trial-period has ended.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><A NAME="events"><FONT
SIZE="4" COLOR="#CCCCFF">Guild Events</FONT></A></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because we strive 
        to promote camaraderie among members, guild events are an important part 
        of Avenging Storm. Attempts will be made to insure that at least two guild 
        events will be held each month and that as many people are able to participate 
        as possible. Teleportation and binds will be provided whenever possible 
        and will be free of cost. Events will be announced via guild chat and 
        the main guild page so please check often! Suggestions for events are 
        always welcome and should be submitted to Kindoz or any guild officer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The following actions
warrant immediate dismissal from Avenging Storm (please note that you will be
given the chance to defend yourself in any of the following instances):</FONT> 
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><FONT
COLOR="#FFFF99">Kill stealing</FONT></B><BR>
This is the intentional attack of another party/character's MOB with the intent
of taking the experience or loot and/or trying to take a camp that is already
occupied. This does <I>not</I> include defending yourself when you are attacked
by a MOB someone else is camping. Please use your own discretion in an instance
such as this.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><FONT
COLOR="#FFFF99">Ninja looting</FONT></B><BR>
This is excessive looting while in a party or looting a no-drop item before it
has been rolled upon. Please ask about your group's loot rules as soon as you
join and strive to uphold them as well as you can.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF99"
