  at 7:00 central at the shady swash buckler in east commons, (rathe server) put 
  on you best Intel boosting gear, crank up your funk-iest language and create 
  a hot key and talk up a storm! Invite you friends, charm an orc, drink some 
  brew, but whatever you do just come! you should speak if you have language skills 
  to excellent otherwise just listen, Lizard man might be especially helpful in 
  light of the new expansion pack. So bring that too if possible. Should last 
  at least an hour maybe longer. <br>

  <b>Wow. It's 2000. I need your help (again, I know I keep asking). I need barbarian's 
  guides, dark elf guides, guides guides and then some more guides. Owners of 
  EQ sites: If you'll let me borrow your guides to post on the site it would be 
  much appreciated! Check out the song in the <a href="story.htm">Story Gallery</a>. 
  Off to Norrath I go! </b></p>

  I'm back...It's been quite a while since I've updated...been getting MY Evercrack 
  fix. Now I'm hoping the login/chat server comes back up so I can play some more. 
  There are some new pics in the <a href="pic.htm">Picture Gallery</a> to view 
  and a new site in the <a href="links.htm">Links</a> page. Enjoy and come chat 
  in the Forum!</b></p>

  Breanse Silverwynde has been kind enough to send me a druid's guide. Find it 
  in the <a href="guide.htm">Guides/Faq/Hints</a> section. Now off I go to the 
  land of Norrath! :)</b></p>
<p><b>12/14/99<br>
  I'm back from taking finals. Now I can go on EQ and binge :) I have a question 
  from one of the members of the <a href="http://www.delphi.com/elefino" target="_blank">Evercracks 
  Anonymous Forum</a>. For the Voodoo2 1000 video accelerators there is a Beta 
  3.00.03 (i think) driver set that uses DirectX 7.0. If anyone is using this 
  now, please let us know about the performance. Also, I still need guides and 
  faqs! New pictures have been posted in the <a href="pic.htm">Picture Gallery</a> 
  so please come see them. </b></p>
<p><b> 12/5/99</b><br>
  <b>Atermis has submitted an interesting story, find it in the <a href="story.htm">Story 
  Gallery</a>. Also, I have created a forum/message board called <a href="http://www.delphi.com/elefino" target="_blank">Evercrack 
  Anonymous</a>. It's bare of messages right now, so come on in and post some. 
  I still need guild news and more guides/faqs/hints and more stories and pics. 
  Help me please! Hope you enjoy what I've done so far.</b></p>
<p><b>11/27/99<br>
  I've added a few new pieces to the <a href="guide.htm">Guides/Faq/Hints</a> 
  Section and I'm still looking forward to you submitting your stories and guides 
  and pictures. Check out the <a href="download.htm">Downloads</a> page for </b><b>some 
  cool goodies.</b></p>
<p><b>11/24/99<br>
  I've added a poem and a song to the <a href="story.htm">Story Gallery</a> and 
  I'm trying to expand upon the <a href="guide.htm">Guides/Faq/Section</a> but 
  I need your help. Please send some guides of your own that I can post.</b></p>
<p><b>11/23/99<br>
  I'm so excited! The site is being hit! Thank you all for coming to visit and 
  for signing the guestbook. Remember to submit the pics and stories and links 
  and etc. Adiago, I've added your link to my links page - thanks for visiting 
  and submitting your site info. I've also got the Everquest manual on the <a href="guide.htm">Guides/Faq/Hints</a> 
  page and two other interesting links in the <a href="links.htm">Links</a> page. 
  I found a server monitor that gets the peak numbers data from the EQ servers 
  to help out all those addicts out there (whether you admit it or not) :) Have 
  fun!</b></p>

  <b>I am no longer using Java buttons. I was having trouble getting the browsers 
  to recognize that the &quot;Links&quot; button was there. So I stick to regular 
  HTML links. I've already had people sign my guestbook! Hooray! Also, a new section 
  for <a href="guide.htm">Guides/Faqs/Hints</a> is here...doesn't have anything 
  in it yet though. I'll post back soon with new stuff in that section.</b></p>
<p><b>11/19/99<br>
  I have uploaded the first pieces of the site! I hope you enjoy it. Please send 
  emails to <a href="mailto:thybidding@hotmail.com">Bard Corali</a> so your guild 
  news, pics, and stories can be posted. Also sign the <a href="ecguest.htm">guestbook</a>!</b></p>
