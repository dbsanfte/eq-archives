<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: -24.15pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><strong><em><u>Barbed armour</u></em></strong>
is a line of magical armour, which can be found at Befallen. Barbed armour is stronger
than chain mail and it also gives magical bonuses. For example barbed arms are AC7 and
give the wearer a +2 bonus to his dexterity</p>

<p><b><i><u>Chittin shell armour</u></i></b> comes in two flavours. <br>
The chittin shell shield is useable by all shield wielders. It is armour class 15 and
grants +10 vs. poison. It is non magical however (can't use it to bash magic beasts). <br>
Only large races can wear the chittin shell tunic. It is armour class 17 and grants +10
vs. poison.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><b><i><u>Blood stained armour</u></i></b> is a form of
magical chain mail found at Unrest. This is great armour for level 20-35 rangers, shamans
and rogues.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><b><i><u>Bone armour</u></i></b> can be found on the ogre
shamans in. This armour is can be worn by all classes and all races. Each piece has some
sort of magical bonus. For example the turtle shell helmet gives +3 strength. Bone armour
has the same armour class as chain mail and can be worn even by mage types. The weakness
of this armour is that it is quite heavy</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><b><i><u>Damask armour</u></i></b> is armour designed for
pure spell casters. It is very light and features a better armour class than cloth. It can
be found in several zones including Befallen and Najena</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><b><i><u>Green plate mail</u></i></b> is extremely powerful
high level plate mail armour. It is unfortunately only wearable by human sized characters.
Several classes that cannot normally wear plate mail however including rogues, rangers,
shamans and even monks can wear it. It also features magical bonuses. To give an example
of what statistics to expect green plate mail gloves have an armour class of 14 and a
weight of only 5. These gloves give a +7 bonus to strength and +5 to dexterity.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><b><i><u>Lupine armour</u></i></b> is special armour
derived from lycanthropes. It comes in several versions. Some lupine armour can be
directly found on lycanthropes such as the lupine armbands. Others must be gained by
questing for Kart Ice bear. Lupine armour is excellent armour for all classes but
especially for monks and pure casters. All races and all classes can wear it and it is
extremely light. It is the same armour class rating as leather but its magical bonuses
usually more than make up for that. Lupine armour all gives magical bonuses. For example
the armbands grant +3 strength and +3 dexterity.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><b><i><u>Shiny silk armour</u></i></b> is great armour for
mage types. Not only is this armour lightweight and stronger than leather but it also has
magical properties. For example the gloves are +2 intelligence.</p>
