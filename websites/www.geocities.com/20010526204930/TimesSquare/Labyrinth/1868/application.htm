<p align="center"><strong><big><big><big>The Knights of Phoenix Recruitment Process</big></big></big></strong></p>

<p align="left"><big><big>The purpose of this process is to introduce prospective members
to the guild and to get an idea whether they will fit comfortably within the Knights of
Phoenix (KoP).<br>
<br>
The process:<br>
<br>
1. The recruit must have a sponsor of at least Knight rank within KoP. This sponsor must
not be sponsoring anyone else at the time. The sponsor will post the recruits name, class,
and level on the New Memberships forum.<br>
<br>
2. A poll will then be put on the new membership forum giving members a chance to vote on
accepting the recruit. This is put on the site early in the process so that everyone will
get a chance to vote as they meet the person and formulate an opinion. Any comments about
the individual will be put under the original introductory thread.<br>
<br>
3. The recruit then will then go to the web site and review the recruitment process and
requirements. The recruit can then contact their sponsor or any KoP officer if they have
questions.<br>
<br>
4. The recruit will then get to know other members of KoP by hunting with them and thus
fulfill all of the requirements.<br>
<br>
5. When the recruit feels she has satisfied all of the requirements then she will request
an interview with a recruitment officer. The recruitment officer will verify that all
requirements have been meet and talk with the recruit asking her a few simple questions.
The recruit is then encouraged to ask any remaining questions she has about KoP.<br>
<br>
6. After the interview the recruitment officer will then add a post to the recruitment
thread for the recruit stating her recommendation.<br>
<br>
7. After no less than 2 days and no more than a week the recruitment officer will remove
all posts and polls relating to the recruit and post the Yay or Nay result.<br>
<br>
8. The recruitment officer will then send email to Deb and they will be added to the rolls
of KoP as an initiate. The recruit can then ask in game to be invited into the guild by
any officer of KoP.<br>
<br>
<br>
Note: If at any time extenuating circumstances, such as undue negative feedback is given,
then it will be up to the recruitment officer whether the process should be halted or
extended.<br>
<br>
<br>
Requirements:<br>
<br>
1. The recruit must obtain 3 endorsements from KoP members. These endorsements will be in
the form of favorable postings in the new memberships forum in the recruit's thread.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">2. <a href="requirements.htm">The recruit must have gone to the
website and read the requirements of being a KoP member.</a><br>
</font><br>
3. The recruit must participate in at least 3 hunts/events with other members of KoP (one
of these to be a multi-group hunt or activity where many KoP have gathered..such as arena
events). In addition, these hunts/events must have totaled at least 6 hours of association
with the recruit.<br>
<br>
4. The recruit must be at least level 20.<br>
<br>
5. A positive response from the Poll. Any large negative response must be explained.<br>
<br>
This process was set by the the Council of Wisdom (guild officer meeting).</big></big>
