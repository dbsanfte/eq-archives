Hi ho. 
<P>
So the story is... basically I got tired of or uh, just couldn't afford to buy, jewel cases for all the CDs I burn.  I like them thar slim cases, for which I've usually made a 2-panel one-sided insert.  Anywho, my housemate told me about <a href="http://www.papercdcase.com">this paper cd case site,</a> and I checked it out, and basically it's a template to make a rather confusing paper pocket for a CD.  It's very fiddly and involves near-origami level folding.  I tried it out and figured I'd go for something simpler instead.

<P>

<P>
Here's a 72 dpi jpg of it, which is also a link to a 300 dpi version if you want that.  Right click and choose Save As if you want the 72 dpi version, or choose Save Target As for the 300 dpi one.
<P>
Or, I also saved it as a <a href="papercasetemplate.zip">zipped photoshop document,</a> which is only like 322k.  It's in grayscale mode, and has 2 layers.  The background is the lines, the other layer is the guides (the dots, C's and S's).  So once you're done designing the thing, just hide the background when printing, unless you want line borders for some reason.  
<P>
The cutting and scoring guidelines might be hard to figure out at first... basically a dot has a corresponding dot across or down the page, and the S's (for scores) and C's (for cuts) are placed on the appropriate sides of the dots.  Don't cut more than you need to, so you don't cut away the guides in the process.  And score before you cut!  Golden rule.
<P>
Fold it over, and the flaps on the top half cover the grayed area of the bottom half, so don't bother designing anything in those areas.  Use paper glue ideally, tape if you don't care how it looks, etc., which you might not, since that's the backside.  You should actually let your design bleed into the gray areas a bit, since it's rare that the folding of such things is perfect etc.  So let's say the backside of the envelope is blue, with say white or whatever color text in the middle of it, etc.  Instead of leaving the grayed areas blank, you might want to make them blue too, at least the areas close to the edge of it, in case the flaps don't make it as far over them as they ideally should.

<P>
So your new CD envelope's opening is at the top.  There should be a half inch of paper left over sticking out of the top... the guides have you cutting that away, but you could preserve some of it and use it as a flap that tucks into the envelope I guess.  But... fiddly.  If you're going to open and close such a thing many times, hey, it's paper... it'll be a mess.  That was a problem I had with the paper cd case site's template, there was a lot of folding/unfolding stuff just to open the damn thing.
<P>
So, my instructions here are perhaps abbreviated, but it's a pretty obvious design, so maybe just print it out as is first, and fiddle with it, scoring/folding and then cutting as seems right to you... I think it should be pretty intuitive.  It mirrors the design of many such little cd envelopes.
<P>
Another option by the way, is to glue the flaps INSIDE the pocket, in which case those grayed areas would indeed be visible.  My problem with that is that when you put a CD into such an envelope, sooner or later the disc is going to absently slide in between the interior flap and the inside of the back cover... anyone who's handled a lot of vinyl records knows what I'm talking about.  Soon enough the thing is coming apart, and it may even mess up your disc a little (probably not though, I think...).
<P>
If you do this, you'll want to make the bottom half of the CD as wide as the top half... you'll see in the middle of the design there's this 1/8-inch cut away on either side of the bottom half.  I gave it that space because otherwise the flaps, folded over on top of the grayed areas, can be too snug and the thing will buckle.  Mind you, you should still fold the flaps over straight, and not push them to fill that 1/8-inch gap... if you do that the thing will flop open like a pita pocket.
<P>
Mmm... pita pocket.  Falafel....
<P>
(cough)
<P>
Anyway.  Yep.  That's about it!
<P>
Oh, a note here... hopefully one knows that 'scoring' means creasing the line on which you're going to make a fold, before you fold it, so that it comes out better than just bending it about with your fingers.  You can use a ruler to crease it or whatever, but my favorite tool is a pounce wheel.  These things rule and you can usually find 'em at any art store for like $5.

I guess that's a perforation as opposed to a score per se, but, whatever.  It's a big help.
