Before I relate information about Britannia's cities, there are a few things the Britannian traveler should be aware of, particularly those who are recent arrivals to Lord British's domain.  Cities tend to be safe within municipal boundaries.  However, once outside city limits, the unwary traveler may fall prey to the scourge of Britannia, the Pkillers (Player Killers).  Worse than monsters, these individuals travel in groups preying on the unwary to kill and rob them of their hard earned goodies.  If you are newly arrived (with newbe stats) and see players in combat mode or assuming combat mode, run like hell.  Chances are they are Pkillers.  These individuals prey on good citizens particularly around moongates.  If you travel, try to do so in groups.  If you must travel alone, then be wary.  As you start to build capital, make sure to deposit your money in one of the NPC run banks often.  To my knowledge, there are banks in every city except Wind and Bucaneers' Den.  Do not take large amounts of gold with you in your travels.  If you fall prey to Pkillers and you have deposited your capital, your nest egg will be safely awaiting your return once you have been properly resurrected.  This last part is very important.<br>
<br>
For those not familiar with Britannia, a word about moongates will be helpful here.  Britannia is a vast place.  Travel by foot will not always do.  The moongates are public teleportation devices that are very helpful along the way.  Moongates operate in conjunction with the Britannian lunar phases.  Depending on the lunar phase operant on a moongate at a given time, the traveler who walks into a it is teleported to a particular location.  There are many moongates located throughout the continent, including Britain, Skara Brae, Jhelom, Magincia, Moonglow, Minoc/Vesper, Yew and Trinsic as well as various shrines.  Once teleported, if the location is not to your liking, just step in the moongate again until you reach your desired destination.  My advise is to learn the terrain around moongates immediately upon arrival, since it will be essential to your travels. As soon as you can afford it, buy yourself a sextant and write down the coordinates of places you would like to revisit.  Never sail a ship without one.  Additionally, use the macro for radar by pressing Alt-R.  The radar opens a small map denoting the vicinity of your character's location and gives you a better idea of where you are and where you are going.  It is indespensable for locating moongates.<br>
<br>
Now enjoy your stay in Britannia.<br>
<br>
<center>LadyMage</center><br>
<br>
BRITAIN<br>
<br>
This city is the capital of Britannia.  It houses Lord British's castle  which can be visited only by invitation.  Sorry,  I have not yet been invited and don't know of any other plebean that has. (Update: I was able to visit Lord British's castle using a teleport spell.  If you do this, make sure you have enough reagents to teleport out of the castle.  See the Screenshots section for pics of the castle. Britain is also the location of  Lord Blackthorne's Castle, also visitable via Teleport Spell.<br>
<br>
Lord British's castle is a city in itself.  It has shops of all kinds.  I must visit it again.  Unfortunately, the night I teleported there, there were no NPC's except in the foundry.  I looked at his menu and found he carried very good armor at very, very, reasonable prices. I must return to the tailor and mage shops when NPC's are available and check prices.<br>
<br>
Britannia boasts two tailor shops, a theater,  two mage shops, alchemist shop, armories, blacksmith, carpenter, animal trainer, vet, two provisioners, inn, two taverns a conservatory, healer, bakery, fishmonger, jeweler, bank, furrier, fletcher, shipwright and a large central square.  About the only thing I havent found is a tinker, though there is a merchants' guild.  Britain is reachable on foot, by moongate and by sea. Excellent weapons training facilities are available in the fortress directly south of LBs Castle moat or northwest of the west-end tavern<br>
<br>
Travelers should be wary of Pkillers lurking by the moongate and in the woods.  There are farms in the outskirts, and forests in surrounding areas.  Mining is available in the mountains north of the city.  Britain is also thief infested so be careful.<br>  
<br>
Compassion is the virtue associated with Britain and the shrine may be found northeast of the city, close to Cove.  The mantra for the shrine is MU.<br>
<br>
JHELOM<BR>
<BR>
This is an island city reachable by moongate.  It caters to warriors with a wide variety of armories, weapons shops and smiths.  It has a tailor, baker, carpenter, tinker, shipwright and other amenities.  The teleporter 
located in the center of town takes you to another area with a nice mage shop, tailor, jeweler and other shops not avaaven-made market for the serious player miner.  Jhelom has two weapons training facilities located northwest and southeast of the town proper respectively.  Additionally, the arena in the center of town is an excellent pvp facility.<br>
<br>
Valor  is the virtue associated with Jhelom and the shrine may be found on an island sort of south east of the city, towards Serpent Hold.  The mantra for the shrine is RA.<br>
<br>
MINOC/VESPER<br>
<br>
These two cities share a moongate.  To the east of the moongate is the road to Vesper, the Venice of Britannia.  It is a city composed of islands.  It boasts most of the necessary mercantile establishments, including a respectable mage shop with a bank across the street.  It also has fair weapons training facilities.<br>
<br>
To the west of the moongate lies the road to Minoc, a prominent mining town.  Minoc lacks tailors and mage shops, alchemists and fletchers. It does seem to have all the other amenities including a stable, an excellent tannery, a very large forge, an excellent armory, two provisioners and a carpenter. Armor/weapons can be bought at a bargain.  Ore is easily accessible in the adjacent mines.  However, the mines are a favorite Pkiller hangout so be wary.<br>
<br>
Sacrifice  is the virtue associated with Minoc and the shrine may be found in the wilderness east of the city.  The mantra for the shrine is CAH.<br>
<br>

SKARA BRAE (Skara for short)<br>
<br>
Skara is one of my favorite towns.  It is an island also accessible by moongate.  It has pretty much all the amenities but no tinker.  Although the mage shop is small, the mage merchants tend to have good spell scrolls to sell.  There are usually two mages on duty 24 hours a day.  The alchemist shop, which is just a few blocks northeast of the mage shop, has the same staffing level.  It has a carpenter, provisioner, tailor, fletcher, shipwright, animal tamer, healer, very good armorer and a respectable smith.  The woods surrounding the town yield good lumber.  Although there is no ore to mine, the merchants tend to welcome players who can supply this commodity.  Look to the west end of town for the Archer's Guild and one of the few archeilable in the town proper.  Needless to say all this warrior manufacturing activity requires large quantities of ore.  Since it is not minable locally, it is a hery training facilities in Britannia<br>
<br>
Spirituality  is the virtue associated with Skara Brae and the shrine may be found in continental Britannia in the wilderness northwest of Trinsic.  The mantra for the shrine is OM.<br>
<br>

MOONGLOW<br>
<br>
Another island town reachable by moongate, Moonglow can be a hunter's paradise.  It has a wonderful mage guild and all the shops frequented by the followers of magika.  Although it does not have a blacksmith, it does have a nice armorer with a small forge, a small weapons shop and the fabled lyceum, tailor, carpenter, provisioner, shipwright, farmers market, etc.  It also has a central park with teleporters to various locations within the island, including the Lyceum and two excellent mage shops located north and south of the island respectively.  Be wary of Pkillers though.  It seems to be another one of their favorite hangouts.<br>
<br>
Honesty  is the virtue associated with Moonglow and the shrine may be found on the Isle of Ice north of the city.  The mantra for the shrine is AHM.<br>
<br>
OCLLO<br>
<br>
Ocllo is located in an island just south of Magincia.  It is not accessible by moongate.  To get there I hitched a ride with a friend on a ship.  Once there I cast a mark spell on a recall rune so I could teleport there at will later on.  I was able to teleport out because I carried a marked rune to Jhelom, where there is a moongate.  If you go there, make sure you have a way of leaving later or you will be stranded.<br>
<br>
Ocllo is a nice town nestled among green rolling hills.  It has a decent tailor shop, and excellent mage guild with  three mages, three alchemists and three herbalists on duty 24 hours.  Needless to say, Occlo's mage shop is the finest in Britannia.  Because of its large staff, all reagents tend to be available at all times. It has a nice smithy,  armorer, provisioner, shipwright, tannery and bakery.  Ocllo also boasts a bard's guild.  The spells available in the mage shop are pretty much the run of the mill type found elsewhere.  There are plenty of trees for the lumberjack types and plenty of fish for those outdoorsey types.  You certainly can spend some time there and build up skills in a nice, safe, friendly environment.<br>
<br>
It seems that many have found Occlo to be a wonderful place to settle down.  The player generated wool industry thrives there.  As a result, the surrounding countryside has become quite crowded in my server.  This I do not mind, since the neighbors are generally good citizens with a genuine sense of community and civility.  However, the mage shop has become so overrun with customers from other parts of Britannia that it is starting to be difficult to find reagents there in unlimited quantities.  As the community has grown, demand for city services has increased and a bank was recently opened in Occlo.  This was a much awaited and welcome event by the locals, (myself included).  The bank suggests that Lord British has recognized Ocllo's coming of age:)<br>
<br>
TRINSIC<br>
<br>
Trinsic is a beautiful city located east of its moongate.  I believe it has all available shops except for a carpenter.  It also boasts a moderate quality weapons training center.  The mage shop is decent.  The mages there tend to have decent spells though it is an expensive town.  The architecture is beautiful and I would venture to guess that it is larger than Britain if you exclude the British and Blackthorne castles.  For those with mage skills, it is preferable to mark a rune on the first visit in order to be able to teleport back avoiding the moongate.  (Of course, make sure you have a marked rune to teleport out to another location when you want to leave.)<br>
<br>
The moongate is located quite a distance from the town and is infested with nasty monsters.  Pkillers also frequent the area.  Word of Caution:  Watch out for thieves inside the city.  They are very skilled.  Buy a backpack to put inside your primary backpack and place all your goodies in the second backpack.  Thieves cannot look inside the second backpack or steal it.  Don't go to Trinsic until you have done this.  Once this little business is taken care of.  Go sightseeing.  Its a great tourist spot.<br>
<br>
Honor  is the virtue associated with Trinsic and the shrine may be found south of the city on the southern tip of continental Britannia.  The mantra for the shrine is SUMM.<br>
<br>
MAGINCIA<BR>
<BR>
I have visited Magincia only once.  It is reachable by moongate and the sea.  The architecture is beautiful and seems to have most of the amenities necessary for the serious Britannian resident.<br>
<br>
Although not apparent by the lifestyle of its residents in this age, humility  is the virtue associated with Magincia and the shrine may be found quite far from the city, in the Isle of the Avatar.  The mantra for the shrine is LUM.<br>
<br>
YEW<BR>
<BR>
Yew is also reachable by moongate and is a lumberjack/fletcher's heaven.  The town proper, however, is quite small and it is so remote that I have not really had a chance to explore it.  It does have a bakery, a small tannery and a carpenter shop where I have found buildings discounted from time to time and a fletcher with a small archery training area.  Ampath Abbey, of prior Ultima fame, is in Yew and has a bank area within its walls.  I could not find a mage shop there.  The moongate is directly east of Ampath Abbey.  The walk is long and watch out for Orcs and Ettins along the way to the moongate.<br>
<br>
Justice is the virtue associated with Yew and the shrine may be found northeast of the city.  The mantra for the shrine is BEH.<br>
<br>
SERPENTS HOLD<BR>
<BR>
This is an island fortress only reachable by ship, and of course, by casting recall or gate:)  The town has a tailor shop, very small and rudimentary mage shop, fletcher, large smith, large armorer, tinker/carpenter combo shop, stable, animal tamer and healer.  The central square has training dummies that are usually not crowded.  Because of 24/7 availability, I rate this facility the best in Britannia.  Additionally there is an adjacent archer training center with equal availability for the afficionados of that profession.  Its a dummy/archery practice heaven for those who can get to it.<br>
<br>
NUJELM<br>
<br>
Another island city, Nujelm is not reachable by moongate.  It is located directly west of Moonglow.  It has most amenities but no mage shop, repeat NO MAGE SHOP.  There is not even an herbalist to be found there.  Consequently, mages traveling there would be wise to ensure that they have enough reagents to teleport out of there.  Although the tailor shop and bank are located in the city proper, the armorer, fletcher, tanner, smith and carpenter are accessible only by traversing the city's western gate through the poor side of town, and following the path to the Nujelm "mall" sort of speak:)<br>
<br>
BUCCANEER'S DEN<br>
<br>
Historically, Buc's Den has been a haven for pirates and the unsavory types of Britannia.  It is unguarded and located on a large island southeast of Britain.  Tropical flora grace the public byways but outside of town be careful of reapers and other nasty vegetation.  I have visited it on occasion and it has a provisioner, carpenter/architect and a decent smith.  Since there are no guards, it is frequented by the notoriety challenged and those with persona non grata status in the towns where decent folk live.  Terrorism runs rampant and tourists travel there at their own risk.  If the adventuring spirit  becons to go there anyway, make sure you have a nice nestegg at the bank and leave behind anything of value to you.  While you are there, make sure you bring your swimming attire and take advantage of the thermal baths.  They are the pride of the Den and extremely relaxing to those tired aching adventuring bones.  The bathhouse is open 24/7 and is supported by public funds:)  There is no moongate, so it is only accessible by boat or the casting of recall and gate spells. (Mages are advised to have a rune ready and recall and gate icons on screen at all times.)<br>
<br>
Its rustic appearance is somewhat appealing but the traveler's advisory is that if you must go there, do so in groups and make sure you have a way to get back to civilization when and IF you are ready and able  to depart.<br>
<br>
WIND<BR>
<BR>
Wind is a legendary city with an entrance teleporter hidden within a maze in the mountain range just north of the city of Britain. The dungeon/maze is very difficult to negotiate and arriving at the teleporter marks only the end of Phase I of the process.  Admittance into the city requires Expert level magery credentials (or 72.3 magery points). The city elders are very strict about this rule due to the large number of individuals, uninitiated in the arcane arts, that were previously able to access the city through marked runes and gates provided by friends.  The abuse was so excessive that the elders were forced to create a special magical field barring entrance to the city except through the original teleporter.  Thus today, it is impossible to "Recall" or "Gate" in and out of the city.  Access is limited to qualified candidates at the teleporter only. The teleporter deposits successful "Wind Visa" applicants in a dungeonic tunnel infested with giant scorpions and liches.  The tunnel must be traversed before access to the city entrance is attained.  (What this all means is that once you reach Expert mage level, going to Wind ain't easy and you still will have to fight a bunch of munsters before you can get in).<br>
<br>
Wind is a fair sized city, perhaps comparable in size to Magincia.  Located inside a dungeonic area, its buildings are made of marble and its structural beauty contrasts significantly with its natural surroundings.  Daemons, drakes and dragons crowd the streets.  However, these creatures do not attack unless attacked first so sightseeing is very safe and enjoyable.  Demographically, Wind is very magickal and in addition to the prerequesite alchemist/mage shops, the city boasts a tailor, provisioner, libraries, healer, and quite an impressive zoo reachable by teleporter. Although it certainly should, Wind has no bank.<br>
<br>
Mages especially should ensure that Wind is included in their Britannian itinerary.<br>
<BR>
SAMLETHE<BR>
<BR>
I have heard of this legendary city.  I know of no one who has reached it so far.  It may be a myth.  If anybody has found or visited it, please e-mail me and tell me about it.<br>
<br>
CLOSING COMMENTS:<BR>
<BR>
So now you know about Britannia's cities and a little about what each has to offer.  Once you decide to purchase real estate, a look at Sinjin's House size comparison and approximate price listing pic is suggested.<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Alley/3024/pics/uohouse.jpg">Click here to view it.</a> Please bear in mind that because of a very real land shortage, housing permits are not available in Wind.  Individuals wishing to settle down in Britannia are urged to explore other areas thoroughly prior to implementing construction plans.  It is highly recommended, since deeds are succeptible to theft, that these be deposited in the bank while location shopping takes place.  Once certain of space availability accessibility and zoning compliance, get the deed and immediately place the house.  Don't stop and socialize or give people directions while carrying the deed.  Have Fun!<br>
