<b>Hail Adventurer!</b> I am Xanthe Ravenwolf, and it is my great pleasure to welcome you to the <b><i>Trader’s Workshop!</b></i>
<br><br>

Here, you will find guides to all of the Trade Skills detailing routes to Mastery, as I have taken them, and some alternatives. There are also listings of useful implements that can be made in one trade skill that can also be used in another, as many of the skills are interrelated such as Tailoring and Smithing, or Pottery and Baking.<p><br>

One thing you will not find here, however, is a comprehensive list of everything under the sun that can be made with a skill. There are many, many fine websites out there already who do a wonderful job keeping us informed of recipes and the like, and it would be wrong to reproduce them here and take credit for work that is not my own.<p><br>

Instead, I direct you to the links page where I have listed some of the best sites I have come across, in particular <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com">EQTradersCorner</a>. This is by far the best site that I have visited, thanks to the tireless work of Niami Denmother, and there is also a thriving message board where traders can get together to discuss ideas and share information.<p><br>

I have done my best to make sure that these pages are free of errors, but nobody’s perfect and if you see anything that doesn’t look right, feel free to drop me a line and tell me about it at<p><center><a href="mailto:shadowknight57@yahoo.com">shadowknight57@yahoo.com</a><p><img src="spinat.gif"></center><p>and I shall put it right straight away. Also any ideas for new additions, or just good old fashioned feedback is much appreciated:)<p><br>

Before you wade into the fray, I strongly suggest you read the <a href="tips.html">Tips</a> page, there are some things in there that will save you a lot of time and arthritis.<p><br>

I intend to keep the page low on graphics, as it's loading up nice and fast most of the time, and I know how much I hate to wait for websites to load, so you probably don't like it either:) <p><br>

This is a work in progress, as I constantly endeavour to increase my skills. Any new material will be added as it becomes available. Without further ado, on to the guides!<p><br>
