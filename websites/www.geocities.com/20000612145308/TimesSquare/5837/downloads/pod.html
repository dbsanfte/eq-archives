<p>You will either need the print out the table below and/or save it to your hard drive.  Keep in mind the color-coding of the zeroes <i>is</i> important.  The key which is embedded in the Macintosh version of the correct codes, is also used in the IBM image.  You'll have to print them both out or save them both to the hard drive if you want to understand what each does.</p>

<p>Now, the first thing you have to know about before you go and start hacking your characters is how to do it <I>intelligently</I>.  If you start ripping them apart and screw them up, you can't get them back together again unless you knew what they looked like beforehand.  So a wise idea is to make backup copies and then edit those (or the originals, as long as they're saved somewhere else too).</p>
<p>You'll notice that the files are displayed with a lot of zeros in them.  To get this effect you need a Hex editor (I used Norton Utilities' Norton Disk Editor).  Open the file and you'll notice that a bunch of the zeros are color coded, and the codes are in the lower right corner of the screen.  The colors represent the things about your character which you can change; for exampe, their ability scores or their hit points.  To change a value, click on the appropriate byte and then type in a new value.  Let's say that I had a character with ability scores that were all 17s.  Say I wanted to make those scores 23s.  I look under the key and find that ability scores use the orange color.  I go up to the correct place on the table; in this case the numbers would look like this:</p>
<div align="center" class="sm">
11 11 11 11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11 11 11 11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11 11 11 11<br>
</div>
<p>You would change the numbers to this:</p>
<div align="center" class="sm">
17 17 17 17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17 17 17 17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17 17 17 17<br>
</div>
<p>in order to get the desired effect.  Now if you saved your character and then opened him in Pools, all his attributes would be 23s.</p>
<p>Now, let's say you want to change the name from &quot;Bob&quot; to &quot;Sir Bob of Kent&quot; (make sure you count spaces as characters!).  So find the line which contains the name attribute and change it from:</p>
<div align="center" class="sm">
42 6F 62 00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;00 00 00 00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;00 00 00 00<br>
</div>
<p>to:</p>
<div align="center" class="sm">
53 69 72 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;42 6F 62 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6F 66 20 4B<br>
</div>
<p>Now the name is changed.  Here are some important rules:</p>
<ol type=1>
<li>The changes you make <b>must</b> fit inside the highlighted area.</li>
<li>Your character's ability scores <b>cannot</b> be more than 25 or less than 1.</li>
<li>Your character's level can't be more than 40 or less than 1.</li>
<li>Your character's hit points must not exceed 255.  Also, notice that there are 2 different areas which contain hit point information.  The first is the number of hit points your character has currently; the second is his maximum.  Make sure the two agree in number when you're finished.</li>
<li>If you increase your character's level, you must also increase experience points proportionally.  Look in your instruction manual to find out how many experience points you need for a certain level.</li>
<li>Your character's level must not exceed 40.  In addition, the "Level" attribute is tricky.  You'll notice only one byte denoted for level; however if you have dual-class characters, there is more that 1 level attribute.  You must know what level these characters are on; for instance, the are a total of four hex bytes that correspond to levels; the first 2 are right next to each other.  The second two bytes vary in locations; usually these bytes reside within the next several lines.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Note:</b> Some options (like character's sex) are available for the Macintosh only; I couldn't find them in the IBM code of the file.  An easy remedy is to create a charater to taste then modify the hell out of them.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Q:</b> How do I enter values bigger than 255 (like, say I want my character's experience to be 1,000,000+)?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> Aha! Good question. The simple answer is that the system continues
logically; i.e., when you get to FF, then you start again at 100, etc.
But there's also a significant byte-ordering issue. Let's talk about
these one at a time.</p>
<h3>1. Conversion</h3>
<p><b>a. Hex to decimal</b></p>
<p>This is easy. You take the column number and multiply by a factor
and take the sum. Well, given a number:</p>
  
<p>wxyz</p>
<p>The formula is: decimal = 4096*w + 256*x + 16*y + z
And of course if you have a letter in the column, you have to
convert it to 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15 first. Example:</p>
<p>14A3 = 4096*1 + 256*4 + 16*10 + 3 = 5283</p>
<p>This covers numbers 0 to 65535 (0 to FFFF). For larger numbers,
the system expands logically but with larger factors. I don't
have a calculator with me, but the pattern is obvious:</p>
   
<p>Rightmost column: Factor is 2^0 = 1  (two to zeroth power)<BR>
Next column: 2^4 = 16<BR>
Then: 2^8 = 256, 2^12 = 4096, 2^16 = 65536, 2^20 ... etc.</p>
<p><b>b. Decimal to hex</b></p>
<p>This is a little bit harder... essentially you need to do the
reverse of what we have just done. Let's take 5283 and convert
back to hex. We take the largest factor that doesn't exceed
5283. The 65536 factor is too large, so we know we will start
with 4096 (and thus we'll have a four-digit hex number at the
end). We divide 4096 into 5283 and discard the remainder. The
answer is 1. This is the first digit of the hex digit. Now we
curiously multiply 1 by the factor again to get 4096, then we
subtract this from 5283 to get 1187. Now we divide 1187 by
the next factor, which is 256. Throwing out the remainder, we
get 4. This is the next hex number. Now we do the curious
re-mulitplication again, but notice that 256*4 = 1024. We
subtract THIS from 1187 to get 163. Moving on to the next
factor, 163/16 = 10 (remainder discarded). Ten is A in hex, so
we write A for the next hex digit. Now we multiply A by the
factor again, i.e. 10, so 10*16 = 160, and we subtract this
from 163 to get 3. Now 3 divided by 1 is 3, so we write 3
for the last digit and we're done. This is a bit long, but
with practice you can do it quickly. Or you can cheat and find
a calculator that converts for you.</p>
<p>Word of caution: once you've picked the correct starting
factor, don't skip any in the middle. For example: 514-&gt;hex:
514/256 = 2 (remainder discarded). When we subtract 256*2=512,
we get 2 left. The next factor is supposed to be 16. So 2/16 =
ZERO when the remainder is discarded, so we have to write zero
for the next digit. THEN the next factor is 1, so we can write
2. So the correct answer is the 3-digit hex number 202.</p>
<h3>2. Byte Ordering</h3>
<p>You probably know that a byte can hold a number from 0 to 255, or
00 to FF hex. For larger numbers we have to use multiple bytes.
But when we have a 4-digit hex number like FFD2, do we store the
FF first or the D2 first? Historically, no one thought of this at
first, so hardware designers ended up doing both. Intel chips put
the D2 first whereas Motorola chips put the FF first. There are
good reasons for choosing one over the other so neither convention
is better than the other. But because there are two different
standards out there, this creates a compatibility problem.</p>
<p>So... when you are working on editing the binary files, before you
start working with numbers larger than 255, you need to first
determine which byte-ordering convention is being used. I'm
sure that when we are working with
the Mac files, we have the &quot;FF first&quot; convention. No surprise, since
Macs have Motorola chips. If you're now working with IBM files, it's
likely that you could have a &quot;D2 first&quot; situation.</p>
<p>Three-byte numbers are NOT common. If 65535 (FFFF) is not big
enough for a number, four bytes are typically used. The bytes are
either all &quot;forward&quot; or all &quot;backward,&quot; never mixed-up. For a
number like EA2150A2, it would be coded like this:</p>
<p>Intel:  A2 50 21 EA;  Motorola:  EA 21 50 A2</p>
<p>By the way, the &quot;Intel&quot; ordering is OFFICIALLY called &quot;little
endian,&quot; whereas the Motorola ordering is OFFICIALLY called &quot;big
endian.&quot; Little endian has the littlest part of the number first
whereas big endian has the biggest part of the number first.</p>
<p>That should just about do it....if you have any problems, e-mail me!</p>
