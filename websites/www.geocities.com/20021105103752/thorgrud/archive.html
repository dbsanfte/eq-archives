          <p>Uploaded new development version of EQini. This one supports the most of the new
          SOL options in the eqclient.ini file, there are still a few that I haven't gotten
          around to implementing yet. (Anyone know what "ShowNamesLevel" is?) I also may
          have fixed a potential issue for WinXP users involving EQini not being able to find
          EQ's directory.</p>

          <p>Updated website today. Site now uses Cascading Style Sheets, which makes it much
          easier to keep tidy. It was also a lot of fun. (Alright I was bored. Really bored...)
          All joking aside, I also uploaded new versions of EQOpt and EQini. Mostly just small
          tweaks. EQini now supports the SOL movable windows, sort-of. The SOL windows won't
          be sized properly because the height and width aren't stored in the eqclient.ini and
          I haven't purchased SOL yet because my hardware is woefully inadequate. (Upgrade time.)
          If anyone out there can <a href="mailto:hexdump@geocities.com">e-mail me</a>
          the pixel widths and heights I'd appreciate it.</p>

          <p>Uploaded a new program, EQPath. This is a minor utility which allows you to modify
          the App Path registry entry for EverQuest. It's only useful if you didn't install EQ
          using the install program, or you moved the EQ folder after installing.</p>

          <p>Uploaded new alpha version of EQOpt. This is a minor update which enhances
          menus with support for the enclosed EQServerNames.ini file. The Open menuitem is
          now working if EQOpt cannot locate any .opt files. It looks for your EQ folder
          in the registry and if it can't find it there, it tries the current directory.
          If it fails to locate any opt files the Open command is enabled instead.</p>
          <p>If you don't like the new look, just delete the EQServerNames.ini file and it will
          revert to the old look.</p>
          <p>On a persistant note, I'm still looking for several command buttons' hexadecimal
          values. In particular the ones for the Rogue and Monk classes. If anyone out
          there would like to assist me with these I'd appreciate an e-mail.</p>

          <p>Uploaded new alpha version of EQOpt. This is a minor update which adds
          an optional feature to the program. If you add the enclosed EQServerNames.ini
          file to the same directory as the new executable, EQOpt will display the
          server name in the title bar next to the characters name.</p>

          <p>Finally note for the day, I've switched to Delphi 6 (Personal Edition).
          It's free for non-profit use, so I thought I'd give it a try. Executables are
          a little larger but still reduce well with UPX. There are several small improvements
          due to this switch. For example the program now minimize with the same animation as
          all other windows programs.</p>
          <p>Well that is all for today, enjoy everyone.</p>

          a new feature: The Background on which the text color samples are displayed
          can now be changed to compare how text colors might look on variously colored
          chat windows. Both "Normal" and "Fullscreen" EQ modes are supported.</p>
          <p>Note: In EQ's "Fullscreen" mode the text colors Black and White are reversed.
          This "feature" is also supported. So don't be surprised if it doesn't look quite

          Updated website.
          <p>Uploaded new stable version. Cleaned up Misc. Page and moved resolution
          buttons from toolbar to Window Colors/Positions page since this is the only
          page where they are used.</p>
          <p>Note: There is a small bug in the Delphi 3 (and I believe
          Delphi 4) Forms unit which results in a very small memory leak. As I only have
          the Standard versions of these compilers which do not come with the source
          code for the default components, I can not fix this at this time. I believe
          this bug has been corrected in later versions of the Delphi compiler.
          The bug results in a 4KB memory leak each time the program in run.</p>

          <p>I uploaded another Beta version for testing. This version
          lacks only a keymap editor. The Misc. page is a little
          cluttered at the moment as well. I need to tidy this up
          a little more.</p>
          <p>I have also added some things to simplify selecting colors,
          double-clicking on a window or text sample will popup a windows
          color selector. Handy if you don't like sliders.</p>
          <p>Provided the Verant doesn't change or add anything in the
          upcoming patch, I'd say this program is almost complete.</p>

          EQini (Interim Build) is now available. It features
          almost all options in the eqclient.ini file. Currently
          it lacks a keymap editor and Velious window color
          editor (I'm still debugging them), and has no support
          for TrackFilterType, VideoMode and the ones added in
          the last patch, ShowSpellEffects, ServerFilter,
          VideoModeBitsPerPixel, UseD3DTextureCompression.<br>
          <br>
          Why <em><strong>Interim Build</strong></em>? Simple, the interface
          was originally designed to do one thing, edit text
          colors. The program has grown to do much more than that
          and the interface is starting to become a little
          cramped. More simply put, I'm running out of room. I'd
          like to keep the program useable at a resolution of
          640x480. (This version requires slightly more space
          than that.) I'm currently redesigning the interface to
          allow for the rapidly expanding array of options in the
          eqclient.ini file. This release is just a carryover
          until I can get the new interface completed.<br>
