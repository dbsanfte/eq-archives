		<p align="left"> <font size="3" face="Nosferatu" color="#FF0000">The fall 
		  of the Great Iksar Empire was a devastating blow for the mighty <br>
		  lizardmen of Kunark. Defeated by those they enslaved, the Iksar was 
		  a race like no other. Brutal and deadly, the Iksar rose from the ashes 
		  of war to conquer all, not resting, nor showing mercy in there tyranny. 
		  They were once the greatest of all beings. Men feared them, gods respected 
		  them, all would fall to there knees and beg for there forgiveness. But, 
		  that one faithful battle, the Ring of Scale, along with there petty 
		  allies rampaged through Cabilis like a flood of flesh and steel. Destroying 
		  the great walled city and freeing thousands of slaves from the bloody 
		  grasp of the Iksar Empire. These events triggered a resistance...a new 
		  beginning. A cryptic rebirth of the Iksar. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Nosferatu" color="#FF0000"> First, 
		  a mere reflex of revenge by a lone soul, only known as Rikuun Kor'baak. 
		  But soon, it would become so much more. He dreamed of bringing back 
		  to the Iksar Empire back to its former glory. Believing that if he, 
		  along with his minions, enslaved the world, not just Kunark...but Norrath. 
		  Through enslaving Norrath the lesser gods would pay heed to him, knowing 
		  he now controls there creations. Through this control the dragonkind 
		  would fall to there knees before the Iksar, knowing not only that every 
		  race is against them, but every god is too. He begun to get far to deep 
		  into his thoughts, beginning to transform into something unworldly. 
		  Some believe he was posessesed, some believe he is insane. But only 
		  he knows the truth. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Nosferatu" color="#FF0000"> He now 
		  travels Kunark, searching for new souls to fall within the ranks of 
		  his world, a descension of apocalyptic portions has begun...and all 
		  you can do is watch...and bleed. Scream, and pray as the beautiful irony 
		  begins. </font></p>
