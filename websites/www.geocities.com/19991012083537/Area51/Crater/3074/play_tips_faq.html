</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P>There is a merchant in Ak'Anon who will sell (food + Misc.) to Necromancers.  It is a clockwork Magi in the Magician section of the Library. As you face the Necromancer Guild's Hidden wall, the Magi behind the door just too the left of the False Wall.</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P>It seems that if someone casts invisible on you,
your pet will suicide(thinking you are not there).  I don't think this is widely known,  but it will really cripple necromancers in PvP.  I am playing a level 8 DE necro on Veeshan, and your tips have been really helpful.  I amnot PvP yet, but I am considering it for later levels.<br>
Also, I am pretty sure the pet, as you were command will make it stay in one place without guarding.  This might be useful in guild conflicts combined with sight graft and voice graft(as a scout)<br>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P>Keep a tight control on your pets near guarded areas, as the guards will kill you and your pet.  Also at about level 4 you can fight spiderlings hand to hand and gain offense and defense, when you tire of it life spike them or pull out your dagger.</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>A:</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#808080"><P>Unless this was changed since beta, you can buy these from a mechanic in town (one is behind the library another is in the first room you hit when entering Steamfront Mountains.)</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#ff0000"><P>Q:</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#808080"><P>Can Damage over time spells be stacked? Will three casts of the same spell do triple damage over time?  Does poison bolt effect Dex. and Agil?</P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="red"><P>Questions asked by Temujin.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>A:</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#808080"><P>Some spells can be stacked such as poison and clinging darkness.  Only one spell of the same kind can be used for damage over time. (IE. Two poison bolts will only do the damage over time of one.)  At this time Dex and Agil, are not effected by poison.</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#ff0000"><P>Q:</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#808080"><P>What is the best trade skill for Necromancer's?</P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="red"><P>Questions asked by RanaRex.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>A:</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#808080"><P>Necromancer's (like all pure spell casters) Really don't need to use trade skills, as they don't gain much from them.<br>
If you want to make money then using the tailoring skill works the best all you pay for (after the initial investment in a sewing kit) is 5 silver for the pattern, and you recieve 1gp 5 SP + for the patchwork armor (you will need to kill a pelt giving animal wolfs,cats,bears ect).<br>
The most useful (even tho its not really useful) is fishing because you can catch your own food. You can make money this way if you have the time (and nothin better to do) but i find killing things you gain more money and exep.<br></P>
