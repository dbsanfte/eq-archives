</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P>Most races hate Dark Elf's; Necromancers are also hated by those races.  This makes a Dark Elf Necromancer Extremely hated by all other non-evil races.  Your only allies are the Savage Trolls, and the Beastly Ogres.  On the positive side you will not be cast aside by your own race (as all other necromancers are).  </P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>Positive's:</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#008000"><P>Ultravision: </FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#800000"> </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080">This is the biggest bonus for dark elf's, in EQ 80% of the time it will be dark (nighttime, dungeons ex..) and being able to see perfectly at night is a huge plus.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#008000"><P>Hide: </FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#800000"> </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080">This ability is great for any class that is a dark elf, It allows you to become invisible as long as you don't move or cast a spell.  Great for mediating your mana back, the only problem with this skill for necromancers is that your pet will kill itself because it thinks your not there.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#800000"><P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>Negative's:</P>

This will limit some travel until level 8 when you get "Gather Shadow" spell and you can become invisible.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#008000"><P>City:</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#800000">  </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080">Your town is massive, and hard to navigate at first.  Your town is 3 zones wide and you have to go through all three to get your guild.  The town becomes easier to navigate after you play for awhile.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#008000"><P>Newbie Zone:</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#800000"> </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080">The newbie zone is more dangerous then any of the other races because you have Young Kodak's, Shadow Wolfs, and Full Skeletons mixed in with the Newbie stuff.  Also you must zone back into the city to sell your wares unlike most other newbie zones.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ffff00"><P>**</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808000">Good thing about the zone is you can level all the way to 8 without leaving the zone</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ffff00">**</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#800000"><P ALIGN="CENTER">Character Creation:</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P>Like all Necromancers' intelligence is the most important attribute.  The game will tell you that dexterity is also important but I don't believe it is as important as Agility.  My reasoning for this is because Agility goes into your AC/ and your ability to not get hit in combat.  Dexterity is used to calculate you ability to hit your target, but with your pets doing the entire melee side of fighting this is worthless.  I would much rather not get hit by the giant then be able to hit him with my dagger.</P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P>As you can see by the chart above Intelligence is already high, but not quite high enough.  I would recommend putting in </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ffff00">23</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> of your bonus points into intelligence making it </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ffff00">130</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> this will give you plenty of mana (which is your life).  The remaining </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ffff00">7 </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080">bonus points can be disrupted on personal bases I put </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ffff00">4</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> into Strength and the other </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ffff00">3</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> into agility.  </P>
<P>Select your Name, Race, and Deity.  These are all on a personnel bases.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#800000"><P ALIGN="CENTER">It Begins:</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#800000"><P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P>You materialize in the city of Neriak; the city itself is massive.   You begin with the Usual Newbie Equipment 5 Food, 5 Water, Guild Note, Pk Note, two spells </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008080">Life Tap</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> and </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008080">Minor Shielding</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> and your trusty Dagger.  When you enter first thing you do is sit down and scribe your two spells into your spell book (click on the spell and drag to a open spot in your book), you do this first so you don't lose your spells if you die.  Next double right click on your guild note and it will have directions to your guild and who to give your note to.  </P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ffff00"><P>Here is a small guide to the city.</P>
</FONT><P><A HREF="directions.html"><FONT SIZE=6>City Guide</FONT></A></P>
<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ffff00"><P>Maps of the City:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P>Your guild is located in "The 3rd Gate"; it's a massive red complex I have a screenshot of it in my screen shot section.</P>
<P>Once you find your master and give him your note you will gain a little experience and a guild robe.  Your robe is not that great but will have to do.  Right click on your Guild master again and he will offer you some training, train 5 points in piercing and head toward the main gate for some action.  </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>From your guild house you will have to go through 3rd gate, through the commons and through foreign corner to get to the front gate.  </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#800000"><P ALIGN="CENTER">Getting to Level 4:</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Your Newbie killin fields is alittle ways from the gate but is easy to find none the less.  From the gate you turn left and follow the mountain ridge you will soon run into a large open area.  This is your hunting spot until you hit level 4.  In here you will find:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ff0000"><P>At Level 1-2 kill:</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Moss Snakes:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> Kill as many of these as you can they yield 1-2 snake skins which sell for 8 copper a piece, this may not sound like alot but there stackable and after you kill 6 or 7 you will have a gold piece worth.  Also there are snake fangs put there only worth 1 copper.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Decaying Skeletons:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> This is your Piggy bank for awhile, they give Silver pieces, bone chips, and sometimes-rusty weapons.  </P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808000"><P>**Note even though the bone chips sell for over 1 sp. a piece never sell these because they are used to summon your skeleton pets. **</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ff0000"><P>Level 2(w/pet)-4</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Black Wolf</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080">: The easiest wolfs to kill these dogs will give you chucks of meat every now and again you can save these for food after level 4.  (Bears and cats also yield these).  Also you may receive a pelt of some kind Usually its a ruined pet (8 copper), which are usually worthless unless your a tailor (you can't any of the tailored armor).  Sometimes you will receive a Low quality pelt (1gp), medium Quality (1.5gp) high quality (2+gp) or black wolf skins (8 silver).</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Fire Beetles:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> You will kill these all the way to level 4, You can start killing these at level 2 with your summoned pet if more then one jump on you may want to run for the guards.  At level 3 you can take on 2 or more.  They yield good experience, beetle legs, but most importantly fire beetle eyes.  They eyes are worth 2 silver 5 copper and are a weak light source (as a dark elf you don't need them for light just money) </P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ff0000"><P>Level 3-4:</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Spiderlings:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080">  These are usually out of reach of a level 2.  They can do up to 10 hp of damage but usually it's around 4.  They come in different /con levels so make sure you can handle them.  The worst part of fighting these until your ready is that there extremely social, Meaning if another spiderlings is even close to the battle he will join in against you.  Usually you will find spider legs (8cp), spiderlings eyes (8cp), and spider silk (1sp+)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>By the time you hit level 2 you should have enough money saved up from the snakeskin's and the decaying skeletons to buy a few spells.  When you hit two head back to your guild house, don't bother training anymore in your piercing skill as it raises plenty on its own, save them up.   When you enter in your guild house you will see a few venders take a look at the spells they offer (and dream).  Soon you will find a vender that sells spells that are Level 1 (usually 2 venders sell them 1/2 on each).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Buy spells in this order to be most effective:</P>
<P>(Spells cost approx. </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ffff00">1gp 5silver</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080">)</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Cavorting bones:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> Your first loyal pet of the undead.  This pet is very weak (only slightly stronger then a decaying skeleton) but it will help you smash fire beetles better and it give you ahead start to the guards when 3 spiderlings jump on your pet.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Siphon Strength:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> This spell will drain your target's strength (i.e. weaken) and give the strength to you (i.e. strengthen) this will allow you to do alittle extra damage and your target alittle less.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Locate Corpse:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> Lets face it you will be dyeing alot, this spell is quick to memorize and you target yourself and cast it will point you in the direction of your corpse and you just run in that direction until you hit it.  Cuts down on the down time looking for your body.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Disease Cloud:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> This spell isn't the most damaging but is very effective at raising your conjuring levels so you burn less bone chips.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Invisibility to undead:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> Not really a must have until level 7 or so but one you will want to get anyway.  Allows you to pass any undead without being noticed.  (A must have for fighting in befallen dungeon to avoid trains)</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808000"><P>**The rest of the spells in this circle you don't really need but could be useful in the right situations**</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#800000"><P ALIGN="CENTER">Tips Along the Way:</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#008000"><P>Storage</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000">:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080">  You will find that its a big pain zoning back and forth to town and back trying to sell your wares to make money.  There is a few ways to ease this.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808000"><P>The 1st way (and my fav.):</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> Go to the top floor and talk to only guy up there hey will give you a quest to collect fire beetle eyes and give you a chest with 10 slots in it.  These slots can only hold fire beetle eyes but since that's what you are mainly killing anyway that's good.  You buy and sell the fire beetle eyes and don't return the chest.  (if you want to complete the quest you can by just filling the slots and hit the combine button, don't really get anything worth anything though but it does raise your faction).</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808000"><P>The 2nd way:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> Is to buy a backpack early.  You may put anything into the 8 slots but at level 2ish you may not want to pay the 6-7gp for a backpack.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#008000"><P>The Pets:</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#808080"> </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080">Your first pet is weak, your pet will die more then you will.  Some thing's to do /not do with your newfound friend at this level.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808000"><P>1.  Share the damage.</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080">  You are usually stronger then your pet, so step in there and take half that damage so your pet and you can beat on it.  If you lose more then half those hp's back out and life tap the creature and get you're Hp's back.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808000"><P>2.  No weapons</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080">: You will notice that you can give your pet any weapon you like.  This looks good and your pet does more damage BUT DON"T DO IT.  It is a complete waste to give your pet any weapon until level 4 and then only give them weapon that cost under 1 GP.   When your pet dies you lose your weapon and you're out the money.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808000"><P>3.  Sacrifice:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080">  You're in the middle of fighting a spiderlings, Its just about dead when 2 of his friends show up and starts in on you and your pet.  What do you do?  Simple Start running to the guards, leave your pet behind to keep them busy while you get a head start.  Your pet WILL die but you should live.  Being out one bone chip is much better then dying.</P>
