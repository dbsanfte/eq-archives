<p>Go to Loremaster Borannin in Thurgadin and say &quot;I seek to perform duties
for the crown.&quot; or something like that. The Grand Historian next to him
will tell you what to say to him if you hail him. Borannin will ask you to bring
back to him four frost giant toes. Frost giant toes seem to drop randomly of all
frost giants. Giving him the toes results in faction changes (+Coldain, +DainFrostreaverIV,
-Kromzek, -Kromrif) and a Burlap Coldain Prayer Shawl.&nbsp;</p>

<br>
Loremaster Borannin says 'Every year the Dain replaces the trophies in his
trophy room. There is a reward given for the best new trophy obtained. I intend
to win this year and I will upgrade your prayer shawl for assisting me. Fill
this box with ten Kromrif heads and bring me the combined contents along with
the burlap shawl. I will submit the best one for the Dains consideration.<br>
<br>
He then gives you a Preservationists Box. Fill the box with 10 Kromrif Heads and
hit combine to make a box of Preserved Kromrif Heads. Then give Borannin
Preserved Kromrif Heads box along with Burlap Coldain Prayer Shawl.<br>
<br>
Loremaster Borannin says 'Ahh, some fine specimens indeed, Devastation. I will
have the best of these mounted at once, wish me luck in the contest! Before I
forget, here is the Cloth Prayer Shawl of our people. Before long I will have
yet another [chore] for you to complete. Be sure to keep checking.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">After you finish the third quest, Ask <b>Loremaster
Borannin</b> 'what is brewing?'<br>
<br>
Loremaster Borannin says 'Ahh yes, good to see you again Maeve . I wish it were
under better circumstances that we meet today. For
some time now we have sent teams of our finest rogues to gather intelligence for
the Dain. Tanik Greskil is one of our best. He was recently sent into the heart
of Kael Drakkel on a very important mission and has not returned. He is now long
overdue, and fearing the worst, our wise council has asked me to dispatch a
rescue party to determine what has become of him and return him to safety. I
have decided to give you this opportunity to build upon the trust you have
earned from the council. Will you accept this mission?<br>
<br>
You say, 'i will accept this mission'<br>
<br>
Loremaster Borannin says 'The council will be pleased to hear of your
acceptance, Maeve . Scour the regions surrounding the city of the
Giants. Discover what happened to Tanik and, if possible, return him to
Thurgadin. If you are successful, remember to hand me your woven shawl. We seem
to be running low on them, but I must say Mordin has never had so much help in
the kitchen. Anyway, I will eagerly await word of your findings. Good luck, and
may Brell protect you.<br>
<br>
If you wander around the Eastern Wastes near NEG 6644 POS 4337 you will
hopefully eventually see a message &quot;the snow crumbles away revealing an
injured coldain&quot; or something like that. This reveals Tanik Greskil.<br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Tanik Greskil'<br>
<br>
Tanik Greskil says 'Outlander! Thank Brell you've found me! I am the last
surviving member of my unit. Our mission was somehow compromised, the bloody
Kromrif knew just where to find us... I can't imagine how they knew. I was
barely able to escape with my life and wandered into a trap here. I am badly
hurt and need your help.<br>
<br>
You say, 'i will help'<br>
<br>
Tanik Greskil says 'Quickly, give me a vial of Veluim Vapors so I can return
home, I am in desperate need of some attention from our clerics.<br>
<br>
You say, 'what is velium vapors'<br>
<br>
Tanik Greskil says 'Drat! Are you telling me you don't have one with you? Run
back to Thurgadin at once and speak with Frundle, she can make you one. I will
do what I can to stay alive. I may need to move about a bit to keep from being
discovered. Hurry now outlander, you're my only hope.<br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Frundle Frenkler'<br>
<br>
You say, 'what velium vapors'<br>
<br>
Frundle Frenkler says 'Ahh, you come seeking my family recipe? After all you've
done for our people it's the least I can do. First you must fashion a velium
vial, then combine the vial with two small pieces of velium in this jar. That's
all there is to it. Please keep the recipe a secret.<br>
<br>
You say, 'what velium vial?'<br>
<br>
Frundle Frenkler says 'I'm no potter mind you, but if I remember correctly it's
a small brick of velium, three crystalline silks, and two glass shards. Then
you'll have to finish up by firing it in a kiln with a high quality firing
sheet.<br>
<br>
Small piece of velium and small block of velium can be looted on Ry’Gorr
Minors in Crystal Caverns<br>
<br>
Crystalline Silk can be found on spiders in the same zone. So basically, Up to
here, it’s rather easy.<br>
<br>
1) Combine a small (7 lb) brick of velium, three unstacked crystalline silks and
two glass shards in a pottery wheel. You will receive an Unfired Velium Vial.<br>
2) Combine the Unfired Velium Vial and a HQ firing sheet in the kiln and receive
a Veluim Vial (yes they misspelled it).<br>
3) Combine the Veluim Vial and two unstacked small pieces of Velium in the
Velium purifier. The Velium Purifier disappears and you are left with a Vial of
Velium Vapors. The vial has one charge of gate to Thurgadin. I don't know if it
can be used for that.<br>
<br>
The vial is trivial at skill 130.<br>
<br>
Do not camp the spot where Tanik Greskil is… because i did it, and got A
message: You have been ambushed by frost giants! And two Komriff Death Squad
will spawn, and try to kill you.<br>
<br>
When you get Tanik Greskil to spawn again… just hand him the vial<br>
<br>
Tanik Greskil says 'Thank you,Rassal . I shall be eternally grateful to you.
Should you ever require my assistance I pledge to you my aid. Please deliver
this to Borannin, it is imperative that he deliver this to the Dain at once.
Farewell for now outlander...<br>
<br>
You gain experience!!<br>
<br>
Then head back to Thurgadin and hand Boradinn the note and your old shawl, for
the new shawl.<br>
<br>
Loremaster Borannin says 'Words cannot express our gratitude for your deeds
outlander, you have saved a hero of our people from certain death. Please accept
this, the Fur-lined shawl, as a token of our sincere appreciation. You are
indeed among the most highly regarded Humans to set foot in Thurgadin. The next
time we meet be sure to ask me how to further advance your reputation with the
coldain.</p>

one of my Lorekeepers looking for you. It appears that the information Tanik
acquired is most perilous indeed. The Dain has called an emergency session of
the council and I must attend. We don't have the luxury of waiting for an
appropriate task to arise, you must advance as soon as possible. Unfortunately,
I have neither the time, nor the components to fashion the next few shawls for
you. Ask <b>Rexx Frostweaver</b> about the prayer shawl and follow his direction
carefully.<br>

You say, 'Hail Rexx Frostweaver'<br>

know the value of a platinum piece and I'll not get cheated by yer foreign coin.<br>

You say, 'I am here for the next prayer shawl.'<br>

Rexx Frostweaver says 'Gather five strands of crystalline silk thread and
combine them in a sewing kit to make a crystalline silk fiber. Take this
container and combine a glowing shardwurm bile with three of the fibers to form
a piece of glowing crystalline silk. Five pieces of glowing crystalline silk
sewn to your fur-lined shawl will yield a beautiful silk shawl. Become a master
in the art of tailoring before risking all you've worked for and be sure to let
me inspect your work when it's complete.&nbsp; (In a nutshell you will need 75
strands of crystalline silk thread! and 5 glowing shardwurm biles.)<br>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.5pt">You need 1 Woven
Giants Beard, 2 Siren Hairs, 2 Manticore Manes, and 2 Drakkel Dire Wolf
Whiskers.<br>
<br>
First go to <b>Betti Frostreaver </b>and say 'What embroidered prayer shawl' and
she will hand you a pattern that is used for the 6th step.<br>
<br>
Next go to GD near the Wizard Spires near Eastern Wastes zone and kill the Wolfs
that pat around there. Most of the time you'll find someone killing them for
faction with the Codian. It's a semi-common drop but is No Drop. While your
killing those Wolfs /Auc your buying a Woven Giants Beard. It is Lore so most of
the time someone will let you loot one off a giant or will give you one if they
sell it to you the common price is about 50 plat for one. I got both whiskers in
about 20 mins and the beard during that 20 mins. Also you can sometimes find a
beard on a merchant they sell for about 130 plat.<br>
<br>
Next zone over to Eastern Wastes this is where a Tracker is helpful. You need to
hunt down 2 Manticores and hope they drop there Manes. The Manticore Mane is
dropable so you can purchase one if your lucky. Or find a merchant selling one,
I had to hunt for mine. Manticores roam the entire zone but are most common near
the Great Divide zone area but are still semi-uncommon to find normally only 2-3
are up in the whole zone. Out of the 6 I killed I got 4 manes. Took about an
hour to kill 4. BTW these are blue to a level 49. And, was a hard Fight for my
Ranger that is really twinked up. Easy if your planning on kiting it since most
of the people that are doing this quest are casters.<br>
<br>
Lastly, killing Sirens. Head or Gate to Cobalt Scar. There is 2 main areas these
are at that I know of behind the Skyshrine ramp down at the waters edge you can
see 3 from above + 2 in the water a little bit deeper. And near the Sirens
Grotto Cave underwater there is 4 guarding the cave. These are NOT Fun. Bring a
group with you if you can. But always remember your friends will turn on you
FAST. These things are Enchanters and will Charm your friends and turn them on
you as well as nuke you hard. So it makes pulling hard for them.<br>
<br>
Now that you've collected everything you need place the beard, 2 manes, 2
whiskers and 2 hairs into the kit. This will make a Thread. Now place your
thread, the 5th Shawl and the pattern your got earlier and combine. This will
make your 6th Shawl. If you fail you will get your 5th shawl back.<o:p>

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.5pt">Start out by showing your 6th shawl
to <b>Betti Frostweaver</b> in the <b>Thurgadin</b> Exchange.<br>
<br>
Betti Frostweaver says 'Spectacular artistry! I doubt I could have done better
myself. You'll have to forgive me, I know time is short and I tend to carry on.
This is the pattern for the making of a rune sacred to our people. It will be
our final test of your craftsmanship and will put many of your skills to the
test, but I trust you'll find the finished product to be more than worth the
effort. Show <b>Gilthan</b> the silk shawl, he will set you on the path. May
Brell always be with you outlander.<br>
<br>
Now show your shawl to Gilthan Brittleblade.<br>
<br>
Gilthan Brittleblade says 'So, you've been chosen to attempt the rune, eh? Been
ages since anyone's even made an attempt. The rune represents the very essence
of our people, our culture, and our religion. Take a sea shell runed with
enduring breath and a small brick of velium and grind them together in a mortar
and pestle. Add water to the powder and model the rune. Fire the rune with water
and the best of firing sheets. Show the product to Trademaster Kroven.<br>
<br>
Head off to Siren's Grotto and kill Sirens for hours until you get a Runed Sea
Shell with 1 charge of Enduring Breath. Sorry didn't take a screen shot but it's
not LORE or NO DROP.<br>
<br>
Combine the Sea Shell and a small brick of velium in a Mortar and Pestle which
you can buy from a rogue vendor. I have no idea what skill check this is but it
was trivial to me. I'm assuming it was pottery.<br>
<br>
Result: Enchanted velium powder: LORE Trivial at Pottery 188<br>
<br>
Combine the powder and water in a pottery wheel.<br>
<br>
Result: Unfired Rune: LORE Trivial at Pottery 188<br>
<br>
Combine the rune a high quality firing sheet and water in a kiln.<br>
<br>
Result: Blank rune: MAGIC LORE NO DROP<br>
Trivial at Pottery 188<br>
<br>
Now show the rune to Trademaster Kroven also in the Thurgadin Exchange.<br>
<br>
Trademaster Kroven says 'Fine piece of work there, Adorean, especially fer an
outlander. Now yer gunna need to make a burin to etch the rune with. Once that's
done ye need to kneel in the chapel and recite this prayer with total sincerity
in yer heart. If yer plea be heard by our Father Brell he'll bless ya with the
knowledge necessary to carry on. With that knowledge you'll take the blank rune,
the burin and a fletching kit to etch the rune. Show Grimthor the etched rune
and he'll guide you from there.<br>
<br>
He gives you a: Prayer to Brell: LORE NO DROP<br>
<br>
You say, 'what burin'<br>
<br>
Trademaster Kroven says 'You'll need a fletching kit and a fair bit of skill for
this one, Adorean . Round up a tooth from a swordfish and attatch it to an
Ulthork tusk wrapped in a Molkor hide.<br>
<br>
Head to Siren's Grotto and get a swordfish tooth from the swordfish and a molkor
hide from the molkors. You can also get ulthork tusks there but they're much
easier to get in eastern wastes where you can kill the low level ulthorks for
their tusks. The swordfish tooth is NO DROP which is the only item actually
forcing you to go into SG.<br>
<br>
Combine the tusk, swordfish tooth, and hide in a fletching kit.<br>
<br>
Result: Burin: LORE NO DROP Trivial at Fletching 194<br>
<br>
Go to the room where the quest started with the Grand Historian and wander
around spamming the following prayer until you see a message saying you've been
inspired.<br>
<br>
You say, 'Oh Brell, Thank you for protecting me and seeing me through my trials.
Forgive me for the things I think and say and do that displease you. Please
reveal to me your will and bless me with the patience and obedience to do that
which you desire. Amen.'<br>
<br>
You have been inspired. The sacred pattern of the Coldain rune materializes on
the ground before you.<br>
<br>
On the floor in front of the Historian was a Etched Rune pattern: LORE ITEM NO
DROP<br>
<br>
Combine the pattern, burin, and rune in a fletching kit.<br>
<br>
Result: Etched Rune: MAGIC LORE NO DROP<br>
Trivial at Fletching 194<br>
<br>
Go show your Etched Rune to Grimthor by the brew barrel in Thurgadin.<br>
<br>
Grimthor Brewbeard says 'That looks about right. You're moving along well
outlander. Next you'll be needin to brew up a sacred ink to fill the grooves in
your rune. Take Iceclad Cutlass fish oil, liquid velium, and some Royal Kromrif
blood, brew them in the barrel here then take the product and the rune and
combine them in a fletching kit. Show Talem Tucker the resulting item if yer
successful.<br>
<br>
You say, 'what cutlass fish oil'<br>
<br>
Grimthor Brewbeard says 'Grab a pole and fish the waters in Iceclad until you
catch yourself three Iceclad Cutlass fish. Place them in this oil extractor and
you'll have whatcha need.<br>
<br>
You say, 'what liquid velium'<br>
<br>
Grimthor Brewbeard says 'Collect a small piece of velium and a bottle of rubbing
alcohol and brew them together in a barrel. It aint easy, but it should prove to
be a minor task for the likes of you.<br>
<br>
He gives you: Fish oil extractor 4 slot container LORE NO DROP<br>
<br>
Fish in Iceclad until you get 3 Cutlass fish and combine them in the extractor.<br>
<br>
Result: Cutlassfish Oil: LORE Trivial at Brewing 168<br>
<br>
You need to go to the Mortician in Cabilis and buy rubbing alcohol. Luckily I
have an iksar who picked it up for me.<br>
<br>
Combine the rubbing alcohol and a small piece of velium in a brew barrel.<br>
<br>
Result: Liquid Velium: LORE Trivial at Brewing 168<br>
<br>
Combine the Liquid Velium, Fish Oil and a Royal Kromrif Blood (LORE) from Kael
in a brew barrel. I don't know which mob drops the blood as guild members who'd
been hunting there already had some.<br>
<br>
Result: Sacred Velium Ink: LORE NO DROP<br>
Trivial at Brewing 168<br>
<br>
Combine the ink and rune in a fletching kit.<br>
<br>
Result: Velium etched Rune: MAGIC LORE NO DROP Trivial at Fletching 194<br>
<br>
Go to the jewelry store in Thurgadin by the Exchange. Show your rune to Talem
Tucter.<br>
<br>
Talem Tucter says 'I've heard of your mission, Adorean . I must admit that I had
my doubts you'd make it this far. The rune's creation is nearly impossible for
even the most skilled of Coldain craftsmen. You should be exceedingly proud.
Many have attempted this feat and nearly all have lacked the skill, faith,
patience and persistence that is prerequisite for what destiny holds in store
for you. You are now ready to use this pattern to construct the sacred rune's
casing and complete the runed shawl.<br>
<br>
You say, 'what casing'<br>
<br>
Talem Tucter says 'Combine two platinum bars, a small piece of velium and the
casing pattern in a Jeweler's kit. Take the completed casing and the rune and
combine them in the same kit. When this is done all that's left is to tailor the
rune to the shawl with the pattern. Take the finished product to Borannin, I'm
sure he's eager to speak with you.<br>
<br>
Combine the pattern he gives you, a small piece of velium and two platinum bars
in a jewelry kit.<br>
<br>
Result: The casing. Trivial at Jewel Craft 182<br>
<br>
Combine the Casing and your Rune in a jewelry kit.<br>
<br>
Result: Encased Velium etched Rune: MAGIC LORE NO DROP Trivial at Jewel Craft
182<br>
<br>
Take the final Rune, the pattern you originally received from Betti at the start
and your 6th shawl and combine in a tailoring kit.<br>
<br>
Result: Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl AC7 STA 7 CHA 7 WIS 7 INT 7 SV
FIRE/COLD/POISON 7 Effect: Flowing Thought 1 Trivial at Tailoring 212<br>
<br>
You can then go show Loremaster Borannin your 7th shawl.<br>
<br>
Loremaster Borannin says 'Incredible! Never before has an outlander been skilled
and determined enough to craft our sacred rune. You are now worthy of the Dains
most perilous tasks. One is being prepared for you as we speak, please check
back with me soon and I will outline the details for you. Until then, Adorean ,
allow me to commend you on a job well done!</span></p>
