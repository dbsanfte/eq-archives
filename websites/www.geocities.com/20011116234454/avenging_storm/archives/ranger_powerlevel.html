      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </FONT>How to Power-Level 
        as a Ranger</P>
      <P>Yes, it can be done. And surprisingly well for that matter. When I first 
        started power-leveling my real life friends who had created new characters 
        in EverQuest, I was told that rangers make awful power-levelers, that 
        we don't have a good enough heal spell or good enough buffs or any number 
        of other facts that, while true, turn out to be less of a hindrance than 
        I had originally feared.</P>
      <P>Simply put, I consider myself to be the equal of any paladin of equal 
        level when it comes to power-leveling and certainly superior to a cleric 
        of the same level. What rangers lack in the areas of healing and buffs, 
        they more than make up with in other skills.</P>
      <P>There are five areas of power-leveling I consider most important:</P>
      <OL>
        <LI>Taunting</LI>
        <LI>Healing</LI>
        <LI>Buffing</LI>
        <LI>Pulling</LI>
        <LI>Killing</LI>
      </OL>
      <P>Each of which will be covered in as great a depth as necessary to help 
        rangers of 22nd season or better make best use of their time spent power-leveling.</P>
      <HR width="75%" size=1 color="#FFFF99" align="CENTER">
      <P><FONT size="4" color="#CCCCFF">1. TAUNTING</FONT></P>
      <P>Yes, I consider taunting more important than healing (at least, for rangers). 
        Rangers have the benefit of being one of the best taunters in the game 
        (or the handicap, depending on how you look at it). The reason taunting 
        is more important than healing is that, if the person being power-leveled 
        is never hit, he or she will not need healing. This isn't to say you shouldn't 
        keep your heal spell ready, but if you play your cards right, you shouldn't 
        need to exhaust your mana trying to keep up with the MOBs damage.</P>
      <P>Note that there's more than one way to taunt, and the taunt skill isn't 
        always the most effective. MOBs <I>hate</I> the ranger spells ensnaring 
        roots and flame lick. If your taunt repeatedly fails, start casting these 
        two (even if they're already ensnared or flame licked, it will get the 
        MOBs attention and hopefully pull them off the power-leveled).</P>
      <P><FONT size="4" color="#CCCCFF">2. HEALING</FONT></P>
      <P>The person being power-leveled is going to get hit, regardless of how 
        good you are at taunting. There comes a point when the MOB being attacked 
        is going to disregard your presence in favor of the monk doing 20 - 40 
        points of damage per round no matter how vigorously you stick your tongue 
        out at it. For this reason, rangers really only become viable as power-levelers 
        after level 22, at which point they gain their 25-point heal spell. Trying 
        to power-level without this would be extremely impractical.</P>
      <P>I've found that what works best is for the person being-powerleveled 
        to create a social that warns you to HEAL as soon as he finds himself 
        below a certain point of health (which will vary depending upon that person's 
        level and class). You should in turn make a two line social that automatically 
        targets that person and casts a heal. In this way, you can continuously 
        taunt the MOB being attacked and still ensure that the power-leveled doesn't 
        lose all his stuffing while you're vigorously sticking your tongue out. 
        The two line social should look like this:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>/target Billybob<BR>
          /cast #</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>where # is the spellgem number occupied by your healing spell. You might 
        include a line that automatically states to those around you, &quot;Billybob 
        owes Phaelia his life ... again!&quot; or something similarly irritating 
        to the power-leveled (because if we didn't irritate them, everyone would 
        want to be power-leveled).</P>
      <P><FONT size="4" color="#CCCCFF">3. BUFFING</FONT></P>
      <P>Another reason a ranger shouldn't try to start power-leveling before 
        level 22 is that, at that point, you gain the skin buff, Skin Like Stone, 
        which is far superior to its earlier counterpart, Skin Like Wood. While 
        this armor and hp buff isn't quite the match for the cleric/paladin line 
        of buffs, your taunt more than makes up for the difference. Another useful 
        buff that's ranger-only is the Feet Like Cat buff, a +15 agi buff that 
        any melee character will appreciate. (If you're power-leveling a caster 
        of any sort, Tunare give you patience. Med times drive me nuts, personally.)</P>
      <P>There's not a whole lot to say about buffing the power-leveled other 
        than that you might think to make more socials that automatically buff 
        the power-leveled when he or she alerts you that the buffs you casted 
        earlier are beginning to wear thin. One thing to remember, however, is 
        to <I>keep your damage shield off</I>. Do <I>not</I> cast a damage shield 
        on yourself. The MOB will be hitting <I>you </I>after all, and any damage 
        inflicted by your damage shield counts toward your own damage total, not 
        that of the power-leveled. If you're high enough to be able to cast a 
        damage shield on the person being power-leveled, that's wonderful but 
        not really a necessity.</P>
      <P><FONT size="4" color="#CCCCFF">4. PULLING</FONT></P>
      <P>With long range fire spells and unsurpassed skill in archery, rangers 
        make some of the best pullers in the game. Add to this the ability to 
        harmony a group of enemies to prevent the power-leveled from being swarmed, 
        and you've got the perfect combination for pulling. Rangers can stand 
        at a distance from a large group of MOBs, harmony the group of them (provided 
        you are fighting outdoors, which you <I>should </I> be since you're a 
        ranger), then pull one or two of them with spells or arrows. Flame Lick 
        works best for this as it serves as both an armor debuff and, while it 
        does minor damage over time, it doesn't compare to the 49 points of damage 
        you might &quot;accidentally&quot; cause with an arrow making a critical 
        hit. I don't recommend using Ensnaring Roots unless the MOB is unnaturally 
        fast or you really don't relish the prospect of being attacked from behind 
        as you run back to the person being power-leveled.</P>
      <P><FONT size="4" color="#CCCCFF">5. KILLING</FONT></P>
      <P>Always remember that the power-leveled doesn't have to totally obliterate 
        the MOB being attacked. He or she has only to do more than half the damage 
        in order to gain experience. Watch the MOBs life meter, and lay into it 
        as soon as its below half (wait a little longer if your Flame Lick spell 
        has been doing damage over time the entire battle). Eventually the person 
        being power-leveled will do enough damage per round that you can afford 
        to start &quot;jumping in&quot; earlier than halfway through.</P>
      <HR width="75%" size=1 color="#FFFF99" align="CENTER">
      <P>Finally, one of the best things that makes rangers such great power-levelers 
        (and such a great class, in my opinion) is their ability to track down 
        the MOBs that would be the most use for power-leveling. And with the new 
        con-color tracking, its even easier to pick the right MOB for the job. 
        I personally recommend the rabid wolf and bear pelts in Qeynos hills to 
        start with as they provide exp for killing and then exp later for turning 
        in the pelts. And at lower levels, the power-leveled won't need to worry 
        about rabies since you can easily refill his or her life meter with one 
        or two casts of your heal spell.</P>
      <P>After rabids, move to bandits in West Karana. Again you get the benefit 
        of gaining exp for the kill and later exp for turning in the bandit sashes 
        they loot to Chesguard Sydwen at the paladin guild in Qeynos City. Plus, 
        the money earned from the bronze weapons can be used to purchase the power-leveled 
        new equipment.</P>
      <P>Now you know what to do and how to do it! So make a ranger, get him or 
        her to level 22, and start power-leveling!</P>
