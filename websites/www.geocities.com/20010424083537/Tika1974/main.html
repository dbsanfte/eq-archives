Hello and welcome to my humble gallery. In an attempt to learn computer image editing I decided to use Everquest portraits as a project. It is a very rewarding hobby for both myself and the many fine adventurers who's image I capture on screen! I have recently made an attempt to revamp my website and I hope you like the changes. For now use the menu bar on the left to navigate the site.</B>

<H3>Webspace Alterations!</H3>
<P>Due to a quick loss of space I've had to take out many of the larger versions of portraits found online! I'll begin to keep a 'cache' of large portraits, though the rest will be archived offline. If you ever need a large version of one you see here contact me and I will email it to you :) Thank you!

<P>Manthion Tastran is the first portrait to go into my Adventurer's of Norrath Gallery! In this gallery I hope to display the many adventurers outside of Keepers of Oak and the Spirit of Tunare.

<H3>Website Revamped! </H3>
<P>I have tried to freshen up the look of the webpage so it is easier to read. I am still learning HTML so am trying to stick with a simpler layout that is easy to update. The menu on the left should help you access the Latest Portrait, Portrait Galleries, or give you a link to my EZboard forum at the Spirit of Tunare's website! Enjoy!
