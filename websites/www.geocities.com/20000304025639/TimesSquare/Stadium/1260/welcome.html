<h2><center>Welcome to my Strategy Guide</center></h2> 
<P><I>Everthing is unofficial</I> and most of it is ideas that I have thought up or have taken from other games and the sort. Much like how a jump, is a jump, Life is red, Mana is blue, and a sword swing, is well, a sword swing... . Well you get the idea. So come one, come all and enjoy the page...
<P>If you like the page just spend some time and email me I always read my email and I usually reply weither its a change in my site or spamm mail...;)
<p>Most of the links do NOT work only a few, like the acrobatics and the strategy of warriors... o btw, one last thing (Yes, I do have to brag...) for all those out there that think they can't do a web page, this is my second one, and I still haven't used any program. ;) I just had to say that...)
