  <h1>First Lesson<br>
  </h1>
  <h1 align="left"><font size="3"><b>Glee sauntered in the tavern looking around. 
    A well bandaged Troll slumped over at a table caught her eye. <br>
    "Sarge? Dat u?' she asked the mummy. Kaktel looked up at the ogress. " Yea, 
    he sighed, " its me alright. Hab a seat." He waved Glee over.<br>
    "Can I buy you a Kalish, bro?" <br>
    "Ya sure, why not." He replied.<br>
    "Soz, whut habbened to yew? U look z a little don in." <br>
    "Well," he gingerly scratched an itch, "I was crusin the swamp down around 
    Guk when dees four Kobalds jump me. So I mix it up a while when der buddy, 
    a Hunter, joins in. Well dat was a little too much so I hightail it bac to 
    Town wit thes dogs trailen me. I was pretty well blooded, and going kinda 
    slow. By da timez I fall at Bashers Smurgs feet dey had taken a few nips outta 
    me." He blinked a few times, and slowly grinned, "did I mention the two froglock 
    fishermen who decided to join in on the fun? Heheh, I was almost shaken ol 
    Cazics hand by the time da bashers stopped der fun!" <br>
    The two friends laughed over the near death experience. Glee ordered another 
    round to help ease the healing Trolls pain. " Gee, where's Kitha when ya need 
    her?" complained Kaktel. I habbent seen a healer anywhere in the swamp fer 
    days.""<br>
    "She's up in Neriak," replied Glee, " been hunt'n wit our bro in Lavastorm."<br>
    "Gaahhhh! He'll need her more 'n me then!" Kaktel shuddered. <br>
    After a silent round was drunk, Glee picked up the conversation. <br>
    "So howz the nubes com'n along?"<br>
    "Not bad, not bad. As a matter of fact, I was doing a little hunt'n close 
    to Two Tent da odder day…" he settled back in his chair. <br>
    "And Deere were a lot of young ins out. Dey were so young dey didn't eben 
    have fungus 'tween der toes yet. He shook his head, "Dis one Trolly was bashen 
    eberbody in site. You know how dey are at dat age, full of enzergy and no 
    smarts. Well, da oterz were a yellin and hollern about it but going ebery 
    which way. Sos I gib a tell to one youngn, 'Hey, why don't u and some of the 
    oders Group and hunt dis guy togather?' I asks. Well I seez im start talken 
    with oterz, so I tink, dis is gonna be fun, I getz out the fishin pole and 
    just watches awhile." He takes a big swig of Kalish, squinting a little. "So 
    dis little puke jumps his bro, and al of sudden two oter Tollies show up and 
    toaste his butt! HEHEH I ober hear da trio makin plans to stay by his body 
    and wait fer him to show up again. No, I tell dem silently, fade out and away, 
    wait, he'll come back. Den one of u show yerself….. Dey tot that great plan! 
    Shure enuf, Puke comz back to loot his bod and then spies dis Trolly, runs 
    ober and starts to bash him. Suddenly he's lit up by a majiker and da race 
    is on!"<br>
    Feeling little pain now and full into the story Kaktel guffaws and slams his 
    fist on the table, bottles go every which way. <br>
    "Ya it was a riot! Dis little herd of trollies running afer him all ober the 
    newby area! Ha! He finly apoligzed and pleaded wit dem to stop. Dey was full 
    of the blood call and were going to waste him again when I told um to all 
    group now and go hunt Kobalds! With four of dem togater dey could git sum 
    fine expeareance and shinys. Last I saw, dey were happly desum, desmate er.. 
    killen the Kobalds ober on Kobald island." He hiccuped. "Good stuff dis K'lish."<br>
    Glee nodded sagely, " Ya, dey lerned a val'bul lesson dat day." "Umhun," Kaktel 
    agreed, "da first lesson. To gater we bash gud, apart we squabble." </b></font></h1>
