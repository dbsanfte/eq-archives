Greetings Mystical Knights!<br>
Welcome to all new members!  Recently Shenrak, Redex, Kene, and Staabba have joined our ranks.  I'd like to say that they have been friendly and online a lot.  Hope to keep seeing you all.<br>
<br>
I've also created a message board for us at http://www.ezboard.com<br>
Just jump to forum bmysticalknights.<br>
<br>
I expect that everyone should check the message boards at least a couple times a week.  This would be a good place to post when you level, what you need, where you want to hunt, etc.<br>
<br>
Other than that, keep up the good work. I look forward to seeing you all in game.<br>
<br>
Your leader,<br>
GM Sien Softwalker<br>

Greetings to all!<br>
Though our recent effort to raid the goblin camps in Runnyeye and Gorge experienced small turnout, it was an excellent weekend for Mystical Knight attendance.  Several of us were on and more than one group hunt was enjoyed.<br><br>

Many thanks for some excellent screen shots, which I will be posting by this weekend.  Dragons and Ice giants, wow! Please send in any screenshots from your hunts, but also pls zip them or convert them to jpg if you can.<br><br>

Special thanks for General Luzer for a great time at the icy orc temple.  Also, Sir Wedar, a friend of the guild, provided support in both Runnyeye and at the icy orcs.  Lord Thulgar and Lady Taliis payed a visit as well during the weekend.<br><br>

Keep adventuring,<br>
Your brother in arms,<br>
Sien Softwalker<br>

Hails all, and welcome to the Mystical Knights homepage,<br>
The Mystical Knights is an Everquest guild on the Xegony server. Though we have had a recent leadership change, we are still a guild focused on brotherhood and goodwill.  Members of the guild should be there to help both guild and nonguild players alike.  This is part of living out our code of honor.<br><br>

In spite of the shrinking of our ranks, many great individuals are still with us.  I'd like to thanks Edaien for taking on Officer responsibilities recently.  It has been a big help.  Our members have also been making steady progress upwards, and I've tried to update the members page to reflect this.  If it is not accurate, please contact me and I'll get it fixed.<br><br>

The pictures section has been updated with some new game images, with a couple from the last meeting.  Our account has room for several more if sent in jpg format, so send them in if you have good ones.<br><br>

I'd like to hook up with some of our fellow guilds on Xegony for shared events/contests/hunts.  If you are a member of one of these guilds, or one of our guild members on good terms with another, please contact me about setting something up.<br><br>

I look forward to seeing you in the game.  Keep having fun.<br><br>

To all guild members, past and present, I wish the best.<br>
Your leader,<br>
GM Sien Softwalker<br>

I, Sien Softwalker, have humbly accepted leadership of the Mystical Knights.  Much honor and respect is due the previous leaders (GM) Thulgar, (Duchess) Taliis, and (General) Mahonri.  They lead the guild through both good times and bad.
Though perhaps leaving the guild, they have vowed to support the guild and its members; and for this I owe them much thanks. <br>

As my second order of business, I'd like to thank each of you that were able to attend the Change of Command meeting on July 1st.  The emotions were strong but I believe all were glad they came. Three cheers for our departed leaders and our current guild members!<br>
Finally, I'd like to encourage any and all of you to email me with any ideas or suggestions for and about the guild.  I'd like these of course to be of a positive focus.  I'm considering the complaint slate wiped clean as of today.<br>

To all guild members, past and present, I wish the best.<br>
Your leader,<br>
GM Sien Softwalker<br>

Today is a sad day for the Mystical Knights, but a great day for them as well. I give cheer to GM Sien, the new leader of the Mystical Knights and founder of all that is great. I wish him the best in his endevours and bless him and the guild with good things to come. This is my last post for the Mystical Knights, as Thulgar has resigned from his post to make way for a new age and new era for the Knights. Tonight Duchess Taliis and General Mahonri as well left the guild, but in light of this, we have all still left a piece of ourselves, *characters* still in the guild, and thus are not totally removed from that which was our home for the longest of times.<br>
Although we are gone as our main characters from the guild, we are on others, and will always wish them love, and safetest of journiies. *bows his thanks, his honor, and his love and wishes those still present a happy journey*.
