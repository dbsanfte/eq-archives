</strong><em><strong>The Hollywood Reporter, June 17, 1994</strong></em><strong><br>
<br>
Those familiar with the talents of the late Bill Hicks -- and particularly those who 
aren't -- will do well to tune in to Comedy Central's It's Just a Ride. This one-hour 
documentary that takes a look back at Hicks' unique brand of social comedy and 
commentary will give you an appreciation of his impressive talents. <br>
<br>
The project, well conceived and designed by filmmaker Rupert Edwards, is told sans 
narrator or host through interviews with friends, family and associates and a wealth 
of footage gathered from more than a decade of performances. <br>
<br>
It's an interesting production, one that's quite sincere and telling in its approach and 
also quite understanding of Hicks' comedy. It's less a look at his life than a salute to 
his career, and along the way it provides a glimpse at what really made him tick. <br>
<br>
Hicks, who died in February at the age of 33, was one of those comedians with an 
incredibly loyal following who never found widespread fame -- perhaps because of his 
humor's biting edge. Those who knew him loved his approach and his wit, and after 
watching this eye-opening special you'll probably wish you had discovered him in 
time. It's not just anyone who could bring Jay Leno and Dave Letterman back 
together, but both deliver testimonials here -- along with a handful of other 
colleagues including Eric Bogosian, Brett Butler, Richard Belzer and Jeni -- that 
seek to explain Hicks' humor and perspective, and the importance of his work. 
Combined with interviews of close friends and family members (including his 
parents), it is able to look behind the laughs in an effort to understand the 
motivations and philosophies that drove him on. <br>
<br>
This show is solidly constructed, and does well to capture the spirit, style and humor 
of Hicks. It should have dated the clips and footage to provide chronological 
perspective, and the footage is of varying picture and sound qualities, but they fit 
together well. As an introductory course on Hicks -- and as a tribute to his wit and 
humor -- this certainly is a worthy effort. <br>
