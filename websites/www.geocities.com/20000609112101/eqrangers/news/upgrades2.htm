        <p align="left"><strong>An appology of sorts.....</strong></p>
        <p align="left">Hello everyone! I recieved tons of e-mail
        regarding the post I made on how I viewed the upcoming
        upgrades for Paladins and Shadow Knights. I did read
        every single one, but I will not be responding to any of
        them (usually with every e-mail I recieve, I do reply).
        For the most part, it would be very time consuming and
        also I do not take any remarks or comments personally.
        Everyone has the right to their own opinion and views on
        the matter and I respect that. I will however try to
        relay most of the sentiments that were sent through those
        e-mails. Ok now having said that, let me start off by
        saying that many of the e-mails were very well written
        and thought out. After reading all the e-mail that I had
        recieved, it made me take a step back to look again at
        the entire situation. </p>
        <p align="left">Most e-mails were sent in by players who
        currently play Paladins, Rangers, or both Rangers and
        Paladins. Oddly enough, I didn't get much response from
        Shadow Knight's. I can only assume that there was not as
        strong of a response from them as there was from Paladins
        and Rangers because these 2 classes are played by more
        players than any other of the hybrids. </p>
        <p align="left">The areas of my article that stirred up
        the most comotion were the subjects of Armor and 1H
        Slashing weapons. </p>
        <p align="left">Most everyone (if not all) agreed that
        Paladins and Shadow Knights do need an upgrade in their
        class specific armor. Also most agreed (if not all) that
        Ranger Ivy Etched Armor should not be &quot;nerfed&quot;.
        The general consensus was that the Paladin and SK armor
        should be above that of a Ranger, but less than that of a
        Warrior. In my article I did agree with that. I did also
        say that it should only be increased by 1 or 2 points.
        That figure was based on the comparision I made between
        Banded and Plate armor. I did not research the actual
        armor class differences between Ranger, Paladin, SK, or
        Warrior armor. For all I know, maybe 2 to 3 points, maybe
        even 4 points could be a fair amount. I appolgize if I
        did not relay my feelings properly. My point I tried to
        make was this....Just make the sure that the upgrades
        they get are FAIR. As I mentioned, it seems most agree
        that putting Paladins and SK's armor in between that of
        Rangers and Warriors is fair.</p>
        <p align="left">I also made a comment saying something
        along the lines of Rangers having to had work as hard as
        Paladins and Shadow Knights to get their class specific
        armor. After researching a bit and from what I read in
        the many e-mails that were sent, it seems that the
        Paladin Armor of Ro armor is quite a bit harder to get
        than the rest of the class specific armor. I do
        appologize for not having all the facts before I made
        this comment. Hopefully that will be fixed for you
        Paladins in the next upcoming patch as was stated.</p>
        <p align="left">Ok, here is the point that REALLY stirred
        up the most controversy. Many people argued the case that
        Paladins and Shadow Knights need more, better 1H Slashing
        weapons. I said that why would they need better 1H
        Slashing weapons if they already already have some of the
        best 2H Slashing weapons in the game. Ok, on this part, I
        guess I was mistaken and to sort of quote an old cliche
        &quot;I didn't look before I leaped&quot;. Most of the
        Paladin and SK only weapons are not as good as some of
        the other non-class specific 2H Slashers. So again, you
        guys were right, I was wrong. Sorry :) .</p>
        <p align="left">So now onto WHY Paladins and Shadow
        Knights want and need better 1H Slashing weapons...</p>
        <p align="left">It was brought to my attention that
        Paladins and SK's want to utilize their secondary attack,
        Bash. In the e-mails I recieved, the case was made many
        times that Rangers and Warriors have the ability to Kick
        as a secondary attack which when combined with using duel
        wield or a 2H slasher, means that they can deal out alot
        of damage. Bash for Paladins and SK's as a secondary
        attack means they have to forfeit using a 2H Slashing
        weapon. Since there aren't alot of powerful 1H Slashing
        out there for Paladins and SK's, the general sentiment
        was that this leaves them quite under powered when
        compared to a duel wielding or 2H slash using Ranger or
        Warrior who can also utilize Kick as a secondary attack. </p>
        <p align="left">My original line of thinking was
        &quot;Why would they want to go with 1H Slashing anyway?
        They can dish out alot of damage with a 2H
        slasher.&quot;. Well even though they CAN dish out alot
        of damage, as I mentioned above, they forfeit using their
        secondary atack when they do use 2H slash and still seem
        to come up a bit short as far as being able to dish out
        damage compared to Rangers and Warriors. Based upon all
        that I have read, I have become enlightened as to the
        reasoning and need for Paladins and SK's to get better 1H
        Slashing weapons. Now, I really have to agree that they
        merit and deserve the opportunity to at LEAST be as
        effective as a Ranger in combat. </p>
        <p align="left">So to all my Paladin and Shadow Knight
        friends out there, I am sorry for having been so blind to
        prejudge your needs. I now realize that you DO deserve to
        be at least as effective in combat as us Rangers. I
        sincerely hope you guys get the equipment you deserve.</p>
