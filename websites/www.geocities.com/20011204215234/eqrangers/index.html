        <p>Hail everyone! Well I hope you all had a good weekend.
        First of all, I was sent an e-mail stating that there is
        a new Ranger only belt in the Plane of Sky. It is called <strong>Belt
        of Pine</strong> 6ac 5str 5wis 6disease effect: haste. I
        still need to verify it, but I just thought it would be
        nice to mention it. I have read on some EQ sites that
        there are some nice class specific belts being dropped in
        PoS, so there is a good likely hood that it does exist.
        Also, for the benefit of those of you who may have missed
        it, I will list below the official post by Verant from
        this last patch regarding the fletching upgrade. Thanks
        as always! May Tunare and Karana guide you on your
        travels.</p>
        <p>- Kinien</p>

        All arrows created with the new Silver-Tipped Arrowhead
        (formerly the Bladed Arrowhead) are now magical in
        nature, and may be used versus magical creatures. All
        existing items in your possession will automatically
        morph into the new magical items. Additionally, each
        successful attempt to create magical arrows will yield 10
        arrows instead of the previous 5. As such, the vendor
        buy-back value has been decreased accordingly.</p>
        <p><strong><u>News 1-21</u></strong></p>
        <p>Hi everybody! Well, I have been repeating some e-mails
        as of late saying that I have some broken links on the
        site. I went through and I think I have fixed them. If by
        chance I have missed them, please e-mail me and include <strong>which</strong>
        links are broken and on <strong>what </strong>page
        please. That will help me to fix the problem as soon as
        possible. Thanks in advance. Well as I am sure all of you
        know, the new mega patch was yesterday. In this patch was
        included the new tips for us Rangers to make magic
        arrows. I haven't had the chance to play the game since
        before the patch went up, so I don't have any personal
        feed back on this matter just yet. I would appreciate
        feed back from all you out there. In all likelyhood, I
        will write an article about it. That is something, in
        case you may not have noticed as of late, that I am going
        to try to do more. Many times I recieve e-mails that
        bring up some concerns and make valid points about some
        things in the Ranger world. I feel that its about time
        for the rest of us Rangers to hear what others have to
        say. I am going to also look into the possibility of
        adding a forum to this site. Well that's all I have for
        now. Thanks and may Tunare and Karana guide you on your
        journeys and adventures.</p>

        <p>Hail all! Well, based upon the number of hits I
        recieved this weekend, I know alot of people read the
        article that I wrote concerning the upcoming upgrades for
        Paladins and Shadow Knights. After reading all the
        e-mails I recieved I have changed my views on certain
        things a bit. There is that old cliche &quot;Look before
        you leap&quot;, well it seems that I didn't look :) . I
        have written a follow up to that original post. Click <a
        href="news/upgrades2.htm"><u>here</u></a> to view it.
        That's all I have for now. May Tunare and Karana protect
        you all.</p>

        <p>Greetings. I visited <a
        href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/">EQCasters</a> and
        found out that Baelish confirmed with the EverQuest
        Developent Team that Magic Arrows will be added to this
        Wednesday's patch. Click <a href="news/arrows.htm"><u>here</u></a>
        for details. Also there was a very interesting article
        regarding Paladin and Shadow Knight upgrades upcoming in
        the next patch as well. You're probably wondering
        &quot;Ok, what's that got to do with us Rangers?&quot;.
        Well click <a href="news/upgrades.htm"><u>here</u></a>
        for the post by Abashi and my own thoughts on the
        article. As always, thanks for visiting! May Tunare and
        Karana watch over you all!</p>

        <p>Hail fellow Rangers! Well its seems, that at least for
        the time being, I am not going to change the look of the
        site. I have how ever changed the font that I use, which
        I think makes it a bit easier to read. I am still in the
        process of changing a few other minor things, but nothing
        extreme. Well as always, if you have anything new or
        exciting regarding the Ranger class, feel free to send it
        my way and I will post it for others to see. Until next
        time, may Tunare and Karana protect you on your journeys.</p>

        <p><strong><u>News 1-11</u></strong></p>
        <p>Hello all! First of all I would like to appologize for
        lack of updates recently. With the holidays being a busy
        time for all, I hope you can understand. Also I had some
        minor computer issues that took me a few days to figure
        out, but all is well now. Also, I have started to play a
        Ranger on another server now, so when I sign my name to
        any post it will now be as Kinien, not Kanyon any longer.
        Still the same person maintaining this site, just using a
        different name :) . I also came across a new Ranger Only
        weapon called <strong>Briarzephyr</strong>: Damage 9,
        Delay 19, Magic, lore, no drop. Ranger Only. Dropped by
        Innoruk. I will add that to the equipment page soon. Also
        if any of you happen to have a pic of it, please send it
        to me so that I can post that as well. I will be changing
        the look of the site and doing some other maintenence to
        this site through out the week. As always, I try to
        improve the site to benefit all of us. If you would like
        a sneak peak of what the new site will look like, you can
        view it at <a
        href="http://www.geocities.com/eqrangers/test.htm">EverQuest
        Rangers Test Page</a>. I personally think its nicer
        looking, but I guess I will let all of you be the judge
        of that. There was also a fairly recent post regarding
        Fletching on the Test Server :</p>
        <p>FLETCHING UPGRADE<br>
        The test server has been upgraded with new code for the
        fletching trade to allow the making of magic arrows.
        Abashi had this to say: <br>
        <br>
        Fletchers are now able to make magic arrows on the test
        server. Bladed Arrowheads have been changed to Silver
        Tipped Arrowheads, and all arrows resulting from using
        them are now magical in nature. <br>
        <br>
        Any existing arrows on the Test Server as well bladed
        arrowheads have &quot;morphed&quot; into the new item. <br>
        <br>
        This change should make the live servers at the next
        patch. <br>
        <br>
        That's all I have for now. As always, thanks for
        visiting! May Tunare and Karana protect all of you on
        your adventures.</p>
