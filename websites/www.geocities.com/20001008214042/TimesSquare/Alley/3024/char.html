<CENTER>Mage Characters 101</center><br>
<br>
<p>Unlike warriors and other classes where one starts out strong and able to make a decent showing against some basic nasties, a mage enters the world of UO as defenseless as a newborn babe.  Although through hard work and continuous practice that helpless newbie mage will become a powerful force to contend with, the character development process is slow and tedious.<br>
<br>
"But, how do I get from point A to Point B?  Its so hard."  Well the answer is yes it is hard but very doable.  Beta provided the opportunity to explore various professions and to get a sense of what the economy is like.  Because I am so magnanimous, I will share how several acquaintances and I became GrandMaster Mages in UO:)<br>
<br>
First of all, you have to really, really want to be a mage. You have to be willing to forego all the glory and financial security that warriors receive early on.  You are a mage.  You are a scholar, You are intelligent, and you recognize that you will be a late bloomer and be required to live a Spartan existence for a month or so.  As a mage, you have chosen long term goals over immediate gratification and acknowledge that your glory, although assured, will come later on. As the brilliant mage you are, you already know all this. So, I'm just reinforcing what you already know:)<br>
<br>
A mage must have a well sorted variety of reagents in healthy quantities at all times.  Your bag of reagents is your plate armor and your magic sword.  Unfortunately, reagents are not free.  As a matter of fact, they will eat up a considerable portion of your income.   Another large portion of your income will go toward filling up that spellbook with powerful spells.  Alas, spells cost gps too.  How will you finance these two major objectives?  You will finance them with a second job.  That is the secret of all those Grandmasters you see walking around.  They make money in various ethical and/or unethical ways to support the art of Magicka.  That, my friend, is what you also will do.<br>
<br>
Your Character<br>
<br>
All that having been said, lets begin with your character.  You have three stats to deal with while creating your character.  One question you may ask is how much to allocate to each, Strength, Dexterity, and Intelligence.  A warrior will want lots of strength and dexterity to fight his dragons with, but a mage needs intelligence most of all.  Strength comes second in the scheme of things, and dexterity last.<br>
<br>
When you are dealing with this section of the character creation screen give yourself as many strength points as you can and the balance to the intelligence stat.  ( I recommend approximately 35 Strength and 20 Intelligence.)  Forget about dexterity since it is not difficult to raise through the practice of most skills.  Chances are your dexterity will raise itself to a good level within a short period of time with little deliberate effort from you. Initially, you need intelligence to cast spells and enough strength to carry your reagents, your secondary trade tools and the merchandise you will buy and sell to make money.  Since Strength is the most difficult stat to raise and is essential to physical and economic survival in Britannia, I have favored that stat over intelligence for starting a character.  As you read on, you will learn ways to raise the intelligence stat to acceptable mage levels and how to continue improving it so that it compliments your future GrandMaster status:)<br>
<br>
The next issue is profession/skills.  It is mandatory that you choose magery as your primary skill.  I recommend the second skill to be meditation due to the beneficial effect it has on the intelligence stat and mana when used regularly.  The third profession slot is reserved for your actual money making skill.  Although scribes can make a bundle in UO, right now you would starve as a scribe. Scribes make money by selling high level spells.  Reagents, scrolls and spells cost money, and money is the one commodity that you don't have at the beginning of the game. Consequently, your magery and inscription skills are for your future goals.  Your third profession/skill is what will make or break you in UO.<br>  
<br>
Give yourself 50 pts for magery, 49 pts to your "third" "moneymaking" profession and the balance (1 point) to meditation.  View the meditation point as a seed point to get you started, since its very difficult to find a trainer in meditation.  I don't recommend that you put inscription as a starting skill because you can train for it later on in the game when you have the cash to spare for the trainer.  At the beginning, when you are too broke to use it, it would be useless to waste valuable starting points on it.  For now, you are a mage. You will start the game with apprentice level skill, a spellbook, 3 First Circle scrolls, minimal reagents, 100 gps, and the tools for your secondary and terciary professions.  Which profession will your moneymaker be?<br>
<br>
<center>LadyMage's Third Profession Recommendations:</center><br>
<br>
1.  Blacksmith<br>
<br>
Start in Minoc, buy yourself a pick or a shovel and start mining.  (This is where that strength stat comes in handy) take your ore to the forge and turn it into ingots, start making armor and selling it to the smith or to players.  Ok, so you don't have mining skill.  That mining skill will develop all by itself each time you raise that pick or shovel.<br>  
<br>
You have an income producing profession.  If there is too much competition at the Minoc forge, move yourself to Skara or Jhelom and sell your ore, ingots and/or armor there.  These cities are just a moongate away.  Once you have 500 gps buy reagents and practice spells as outlined below.<br>
Don't neglect carpentry as outlined below.  Develop that skill and you will be able to make house add-ons such as forges and anvils.<br>
<br>
2.  Carpenter<br>
<br>
Start in Yew or Moonglow, buy yourself an axe and start chopping trees.  Lumberjacking will raise your str stat tremendously.  You don't need to train for it since its easy to raise.  Just buy the axe and chop away.  Once your lumberjacking is in the 40s, you will see that sometimes you can get more than 10 logs from the same tree.  Chop always till you get the message "not enough wood for you to harvest" from the tree.  Once you get that message move on to another tree.  I have found trees that yield 100 logs at a time.  When your logs get you overloaded with weight, use the carpenter tool to turn them into boards.  They will weigh less.  Make furniture and head to the carpenter to sell your wares.  I recommend that you make a couple of small chests, sell them at the carpenter or provisioner and buy nails ( 3gps each).  Carry 3 or 4 nails as a carpenter tool and keep a supply at the bank.  After you have your carpenter tool supply (nails at the bank), start making bookshelves until your carpentry hits 50 or you can make wooden shields.  These shields will be your initial moneymaker because you can sell them at any armorer from 25 to 31 gps each.  Once you have 500 gps buy reagents and practice spells as outlined below.  If Moonglow gets too crowded, try changing your scenery a bit and move to Yew, Skara or Britain.  (Note:  Try to stay within or close to the guarded or Justice zones.)  There are a lot of pks out there and you are a wimp in battle at this point.  Better be safe than sorry).<br>
<br>
3. Tinker<br>
<br>
Start in Jhelom buy yourself an axe and start chopping trees.  Make tinkering equipment and sell to the tinker.  Once you have 500 gps buy reagents and practice spells as outlined below.  If Jhelom gets too crowded, try changing your scenery a bit and move to Britain.<br>
 <br>

Note!  Your best bet is to start as a carpenter and buy yourself a tinker tool and get training in tinkering as soon as you can.  With the tinkering tool you can make wood carpentry tools for free.  Keep your tinker tool in the bank and make carpentry tools 4 or 5 at a time as needed.  Besides, a high Tinker skill later on will enable you to make house add-ons like stone ovens and flour mills.<br>
<br>
4.  Tailor<br>
<br>
Start in Jhelom or Moonglow.  Buy a tub, some dyes, a couple of sewing kits and an axe.  Go to the training dummies in Jhelom and practice swords to the max of 25.  Do the same with wrestling.  Go to the forest around Yew and start killing goats and collect their hides to tailor things.  Shear any sheep that you see by double clicking on your axe then on the sheep.  Collect the wool and deposit the wool in the bank.  Once you have enough items to sell, go sell footwear to the cobblers in provisioner shops and armor to either the provisioner or the town blacksmith.  Since Yew lacks either of these establishments, you may have to take the moongate to Jhelom or Skara Brae.  The forest around Moonglow is also good for these activities.  Once you have collected about 30 piles of wool.  Got to a tailor shop and use the wool on the spinning wheel to make yarn.  Take the yarn and use it on the loom to make bolts of cloth.  Make items like fancy shirts and half aprons and sell to the tailor.  (As you familiarize yourself further with the trade, you will be able to determine which items to make based on market conditions.)  Sell to the tailor and when the tailor can't buy anymore head to the provisioner and sell skullcaps to him.  Once you have 500 gps buy reagents and practice spells as outlined below.  If Jhelom and Moonglow get too crowded, try changing your scenery a bit and move to Skara or Britain.<br>
<br>
A note to tailors:  Remember the axe I asked you to buy?  Well, do a little lumberjacking on the side to get your strength up and invest in some carpenter tools.  Develop your carpentry skills.  The combination of Carpenter/Tailor allows you to make house add-ons such as dressforms, training dummies, pickpocket dips, spinning wheels, and looms.  These sell very well:)<br>
<br>

There are many more professions including fishing.  Don't underrate fishing.  At GM level you can fish out SOS bottles that you can sell for 4K each or go get the treasure yourself.  The rewards for fishing at the GM level are great indeed.:) <br>
<br>
Starting in Britannia<br>
<br>
The moment you begin your character head to the provisioner.  Buy 
two backpacks and two bags.  (Make sure you save enough of your money to buy an axe if you will be a carpenter or tinker.)  If you must prioritize these purchases, get two backpacks and no bags.  Better yet, check out the bank for other player discarded backpacks.  Sometimes they just discard them on the ground by the bank and you may save yourself some cach by gathering them up.  Make sure you deposit everything in the bank while looking for discarded backpacks to gather, since banks are nototorios thief hangouts.  Put the second backpack in your first backpack, the third backpack in your second and transfer everything, and I mean everything, into the third backpack.  Put all your reagents in one of the bags and put the bag in the third backpack.  The second bag will also go in your third backpack and it will be used to store the tools of your moneymaking profession.  Put your gold in your bank box.  Never carry any gold with you unless you will be using it for a specific purpose.  Your gold belongs in the bank where it can't be stolen. Once you are done, the only thing you should be able to see when you open your backpack is your second backpack and your spellbook. When you open the second backpack, all you should be able to see is your third. IMPORTANT:  Your spellbook belongs either equipped in your hands or in the first layer of your backpack.  NEVER place your spellbook deeper than in the initial first backpack.  It is only in that initial backpack or equipped that the spellbook is safe from thieves and guaranteed to go with you if you die.  Besides, you can't cast spells if it is anywhere else.  Failure to follow this rule may result in the loss of your hard earned spellbook so DO HEED THIS ADVICE.<br>
<br>
Britannia is thief infested.  Thieves cannot steal your PROPERLY POSITIONED spellbook or your backpacks, and unless they are Adept or Master Rogues, chances are they won't be able to look inside that third backpack.  If you see a message stating that someone has stolen from you, don't hesitate to yell "Guards".  Your second 500 gps should be deposited in a bank.  In the mainland there are banks in practically every city except Cove and Wind.  Deposit as much as you can whenever you can.  If you get Pkilled, you will not be destitute.  Try to have a minimum of 1000 gps in the bank at all times.<br>
<br>
Final piece of advice.  Once you have gone up beyond apprentice level, DO NOT EVER RESURRECT IMMEDIATELY if you are killed.  The penalty in stats is just not worth it.  Play as a ghost and go to a healer for resurrection.  You have your nestegg at the bank, use it and replenish it. Bear in mind that when a mage dies, the spellbook goes with him/her.  The thieves and/or pkillers can't get your spellbook.  Since your book is secure within your ghostly existance, nothing in your backpack is worth the stat penalty. Play as a ghost.<br> 
<br> 
Casting<br>
<br>
As you may already be aware, casting offensive spells in town will immediately bring on the guards.  These will pulverize you into nothingness very quickly.  Consequently refrain from using offensive spells in town.  Go out of town to cast them.<br>
<br>
There are a few rules about casting that all practitioners should know.  Your magery skill, for example, should be in the 30s to cast in third circle with minimal failures, you must have enough intelligence to generate the mana necessary to cast the chosen spell and you should have successfully cast at least one spell in the circle below it.  In the case of Teleport, for example, you should try to successfully cast a first circle spell such as Reactive Armor and a second circle such as Strength, before attempting to cast Teleport as your FIRST attempt to cast in the Third Circle.  Once successfully cast, you now can practice Third Circle casting till your magery and intelligence are high enough to attempt the Fourth Circle, and so on.  Practicing casting will improve your magery skill and intelligence. I have listed below a collection of favorite practice spells.  These were very instrumental in getting me GrandMaster Mage status.  Because of their practice value, make sure these spells are in your shopping list.<br>
<br>
First Circle<br>
<br>
Reactive Armor,
Magic Arrow, (excellent for building up magic resistance)
Night Sight<br>
<br>
Second Circle<br>
<br>
Agility,
Protection,
Strength<br>
<br>
Third Circle<br>
<br>
Teleport<br>
<br>
Fourth Circle<br>
<br>
Wall of Stone,
Fire Field, (excellent for building magic resistance but make sure you have the reagents or potions to heal yourself)
Recall, (make sure you leave town before casting the first two)<br>
<br>
Fifth Circle<br>
<br>
Summon Creature, excellent for practicing your wrestling.<br>
<br>
Sixth Circle<br>
<br>
Mark,
Paralyze Field (leave town for this one also), Invisibility<br>
<br>
Seventh Circle<br>
<br>
Gate,
Energy Field, 
Polymorph<br>
<br>
Eighth Circle<br>
<br>
All summoning spells, (Avoid casting Summon Daemon.  It will affect reputation negatively once the new reputation system is in place.<br>
<br>
When you summon, make sure that you never order the creature to attack or kill in town or you will die very quickly.  You may rename them and have them follow or guard.<br>
<br>
Intelligence<br>
<br>
Intelligence goes hand in hand with magery because the level of intelligence determines the amount of mana available to cast.  For example, You must have a minimum of 40 intelligence to generate enough mana to cast Gate Travel.  Your magery may be 99% but if your intelligence is 35, you will not be able to cast Gate naturally.  You may improve your intelligence temporarily by buying yourself a wizard hat from a mage shop.  (Provisioner/Tailor Wizard Hat stock is not magical)and/or casting "Cunning" on yourself.  The Wizard Hat will give your 5 extra intelligence points as long as you wear it but there will be a corresponding penalty to strength and dexterity.<br>
<br>
Spellcasting automatically boosts intelligence.  However, there are other ways to help that stat along.  Animal Lore is an excellent intelligence improvement method.  Start using animal lore on every stray cat and dog you see. It will be difficult at first but after a while, you will feel a surge of new found understanding and perception penetrate you:).  The same is true of Intelligence Evaluation.  Go to a place where people congregate and start using intelligence evaluation on everyone you see.  (Suggestion for intelligence evaluation:  Go to a bank, put your backpack in your box so all you have is your spellbook, then leisurely evaluate away.  You don't want to have to worry about thieves while you are studying:)  Item Identification, use it on every object you see.  You will be surprised at the improvement to your intellect.  Finally, get yourself some training and start inscribing.  Inscription also boosts intelligence quite nicely.  Although all the Lores and Spirit Speak are said to boost intelligence, I find that those I have mentioned previously have proven to be the most effective for me.  Also, don't neglect meditation.  It comes in very handy in mana restoration while inscribing.<br>
<br>
Strength<br>
<br>
While you moonlight and your reagent bag gets heavier, you will notice that you tend to be overloaded with weight.  I told you the strength stat was important.  You will be flabbergasted to see that when you gain intelligence, sometimes your strength suffers point losses, and you can carry less and less.  The solution is practicing on the strength.  I recommend you buy yourself a mace or staff and head to Jhelom or Britain.  Start practicing on the dummies there.  (Make sure you lock down the tactics skill.  Mages don't need it so you dont want it to go up.  After you max in maces and swords point the arrow next to those skills down.  You want them to atrophy.  You won't be using them.  You are just using them now to get your strength up as much as possible.  Once you max out on maces and swords, start wrestling.  Wrestle to your max 25 on the dummies and KEEP this skill.  This is the one that you need as a mage.  Once you are at 25 start wrestling the animals that you summon with the 5th level summon creature spell.  Just make sure that you only wrestle those creatures that you can handle.  For example, wrestling a polar bear as a newbie would not be a good idea.  Wrestling is crucial to a mage for three important reasons, it gets your strength up, allows you to cast while in combat, AND reduces the chances of your being interrupted while casting.  As Strength goes up, you will be able to carry more so don't neglect this part of your training.  Needless to say, being able to take a hit or two before you are forced to enter the Britannian Astral Plane can make a big difference in your quality of life in Britannia. Since you are planning to be a GrandMaster mage, don't wear armor.  Armor interferes with the effectiveness of your magery so its not recommended if you want to be a pure mage.<br>
<br>
Because of the OSI imposed skill caps,(700 max), there will come a time when your terciary profession may interfere with your progress in magery.  It is at this point, if its not inscription, that you will have to consider and decide whether you will need a mule character.  A mule is a secondary character that makes money to support your primary character.  Mules are widely used and accepted in Britannia.  By the time you are facing this dilemma, you will know what to do and how to do it, so I won't dwell on it here other than mention it as a playstyle option in the future.<br>
<br>
Traveling<br>
<br>
If you have read the travel section on this site you will note that I discuss the issue of pkillers ad nauseum.  Moongate travel is dangerous.  Consequently a mage should not travel the moongates once he/she has attained a level where recall or gate can be cast comfortably.  My advice is to buy a third bag and some recall runes.  Go to each city in Britannia and cast a mark on a rune there.  Keep the marked runes in the third bag in a consistent formation.  Keep a paper diagram of your runes by your computer desk.  You will now no longer have to risk life and limb to those lazy pkillers.  The vermin will no longer have access to your goodies. You can now travel first class with your recall runes.  As of this writing, runes may be marked in your backpack and you need not place them on the ground to cast on them.<br>
<br>
Here is another tip:  As soon as you are financially able to, make duplicates of all your marked runes, put them in a bag in the same formation that you keep them in and deposit the bag in the bank.  Buy another bag and put 5 of each reagent in it and also deposit it in the bank.  Buy duplicate money-making profession tools, put them in a bag and, you guessed it, deposit it in the bank.  Actually, it wouldn't be a bad idea to buy a second backpack, put all these duplicate supply bags in it, and deposit the whole thing in the bank:)  After visiting your local healer for ressurrection, all you would do is show up at the bank, grab  your backpack and you're ready to go.  No need to even deplete your savings.  After making all these preparations, if you ressurrect immediately after getting killed, you are beyond hope:(<br>
<br>
Final Note<br>
<br>
As I wander through Britannia, new players always ask me where they can get higher level spells.  They always tell me that the mage shops don't have anything beyond third or fourth level.  Higher level spells may be found in dungeons for free, or purchased from high level mages for a fee.  I have found that one of the best places to buy high level spells is Britain.  When you enter the city, head toward the mage shop to the north, the one just north of the healer.  Outside the shop, there are usually a few player scribes selling scrolls.  Ask one of them to inscribe a specific spell for you.  For a fee, you will get your summon daemon scroll.  Once you have it, open your spellbook and drop the scroll over it.  Voila! the intricate spell mysteriously appears in your spellbook. Another way is to check the various player placed vendors throughout Britannia.  Some sell only scrolls and potions.  Shop around for the best prices.<br>
<br>
Here is where the value of the inscription skill comes in.  Once you have a few decent 5th, 6th and 7th level spells, buy some blank scrolls and go stand in front of a mage shop.  You'll be surprised at how much money there is to be made in inscribing.  You'll make friends with the regulars there and every so often someone will need an invisibility or gate travel spell and have the cash to pay for it.  In the meantime, you will be improving your intelligence skill and getting paid for it:) Once you buy your house, invest in a vendor to sell scrolls.  If your location and inventory are right, you can make a bundle.  Vendor contracts are available from any inkeeper.  To place it, doubleclick on it while standing near a house that you own, preferably in a corner of the house.  The vendor will immediately appear and be ready to work for you.  Check the UO Strategy and Statistics (link on main page) site for more information on real estate, vendors, etc.<br>
<br>
I cant stress enough the importance of making duplicate keys of your home, when you buy real estate.  Make sure you buy tinkering skill or have a trusted friend to make the dups for you.  Keep these in the bank to protect you against key theft.  Always keep your keys a minimum of five layers deep in your backpack and if you carry a rune marked for home, make sure it is nowhere near the key and it is labelled something other than "home sweet home".  Preferably, never mark  your home rune very near your building and if your home is located in a remote, difficult to access area, by all means keep a dup rune in the bank.<br>
<br>
General Notes
<br>
Sometimes merchants will not buy your goods.  They will say they can't afford that right now.  The only thing to do is either go to another shop or town, or wait until the merchant recycles. Recycling should be about 60 minutes. Once recycling has taken place, grab the merchant and sell real quick before others get to him.  Remember its a dog eat dog world in Britannia:(<br>
<br>
OK, so now you know how to create your character and have an idea about how to get started.  You have read my travel tips and have an idea of what to expect in the wilderness and what each city has to offer.  You are ready to begin your residency in Britannia.  I have one more tip for you.  Log-in to the Test Center (TC) and start your dream character there.  Play on TC for a day or two.  Try those professions.  Find out if magery is really for you.  You may find out that you like wielding that viking sword a lot better.  Playing the TC will give you a feel for what the real shard you select will be like.  Try one of the Advancement Gates.  Find out what its like to be a Master Mage, Master Smith, Master Archer, Master Armsman, etc., instantly.   Perhaps smithing is a lot more fun than sewing.  Being a Master for a day will give you a feel for the advantages and limitations of the major professions.  I strongly urge you to try the TC for a few days.  Once you have decided, go start your character at a regular shard and begin  your life in Britannia.<br>
<br>
Follow the link to the Gate Traveler site in the main page and check the bulletin board to determine the location of the Advancement Gates on the TC at any given time.  This location varies as the TC is reset every couple of months.<br>
<br>
Don't neglect to review the Origin Site at "http://www.uo.com" for news and updates to the game.  As it is I've had to update this page several times due to changes in the game rendering some information obsolete.  The information in this section should be used as a general guideline only and should not be taken as "cast in stone" because the game is not.  The game is constantly evolving and the Art of Magicka will most likely evolve with it.
I hope you found this section helpful and feel free to e-mail me if I can be of further help.</p><br>
