<p><img src="pietin.jpg" align="left"><a name="intro">Brewing</a> can be an immense amount of fun. Ok, the icon is a Pie Tin, but hey, I'm out of pictures... I started because my primary trade skill used to be Smithing, and I thought that some day I might need to make some tempers for the Cultural Armours. As it turns out, I lost my great interest in Smithing after it became apparent that the high end smithed armours are insanely expensive to make, take incredibly high skill to achieve, and I can’t wear any of them. But Brewing had become fun to do, so I kept at it. It also gave me a use for all the foraged Fruit and Veg that I had stored up in the bank.</p><br>

Due to recent improvements, it is now possible to brew drinks that give stats (much like stat food made by Baking). These are a nice touch, and are used simply by having them as your first available drink item in your bags. They are not used as part of the skill up route that I have devised, but I like them a lot, and as they are Useful Things That You Can Make (tm), they shall have their own section. Visit them here! <a href="statdrinks.html"><font size=+2 color="ff0000">Enhancing Grog!</font></a><p><br>

<p><img src="pietin.jpg" align="left"><a name="where">I </a>have found that the best place by far to brew (at least for me and other accepted races) is the Plane of Knowledge (ok it's good for a lot of things), although the two brew barrels are often taken. If this becomes a problem, you could stock up on ingredients and then book to another zone with a barrel.<p>

For those of you who have never seen a barrel, here it is <a href="brewbarrel.jpg">Pic of Brew Barrel</a>. It’s the big barrel on it’s side on top of a box. These can be found in many zones, usually in or near a pub.
If the Plane of Knowledge is not an option for you, then most towns do have a decent stock of brewing ingredients. <p>

<p><img src="pietin.jpg" align="left"><a name="startbrew">Quite</a> a few new brews have been introduced over the last six months or so, and so I thought it was about time to overhaul the mastery route. It's been quite difficult to sort it all into one table (as opposed to the three tables I had before), due to having to take into account the avilability of ingredients that different people might have. For instance, LOTS of brews require you to have access to a LOT of foraged items like vegetables, berries and such. This is fine for us outdoors types, but for other it's just a pain in the arse. Another example could be that a particular town may not have all the regular Barley Hops Malt etc. SO, I have taken a leaf out of the guide I did on poisons, and made a banded table of recipes.<p>

<br>
Depending on what materials you have available, I have provided in some cases a choice of brews to make to fill a certain skill level range. Where there is a choice for a certain skill range, these brews have been "blocked" together on the table by a colour band. For instance, at around the 100 or so trivial level, you can make either Vegetable Oil, Paeala Bark Tannin, White Wine, or Red Wine to get to roughly the same skill level, so these are in the same "block". That is why the tables are stripey. Pick whichever recipe from that block you have ingredients available for at the time.<p>

<img src="barrelopen.jpg"><p><br>

As always, NEVER stack items in the combining container, and NEVER use Summoned or Foraged water, it just won’t work.<p>

Where there is a container mentioned, just throw one of them into the Brew Barrel along with the rest of the ingredients and hit combine. Ie. For Bog Juice put 1 water, 1 Snake Scales and 1 Bottle into the Brew Barrel and combine.<p>

If you are successful you will receive a beverage, and in some cases some empty bottles. If you are unsuccessful your container will be returned to you, and the rest of the items will disappear.<p><br>

<b>Vendors</b><p>

The brewing vendors in the Plane of Knowledge are situated in the main part of the zone with all the shops (ie, not where port stones are). It's the big shop at one end, near the port stone area. There are vendors stood all around the outside of it, and there is a small yard inside the buiding with a Brew barrel (there's another barrel inside one of the shops itself). The two main brewing vendors there are Sirekoth Eshe and the dwarf next to him who's name escapes me at the moment. You can also find water and bottles available on another vendor by the brew barrel.<p><br>


<b>*</b> These use foraged items. Easier to get now the Bazaar is working, but if you're not a forager, you might want to skip these.<p><br>

<b>Fetid Essence:</b> This was added a short while ago as part of a pottery recipe. Happily it trivials at 122, and you can now buy Fishing Grubs in bulk in the Plane of Knowledge from a gnome vendor situated outside a shop, called Caden something (dammit, I knew that name earlier - will update when I find him again). Thanks to the many people who wrote in suggesting thig. If yu have access to the Plane of Knowledge this is my favoured route to 122, cos it's cheap and easy.<p><br>

<b>**Paeala Bark Tannin.</b> This can be bought from one of the vendors I mentioned previously or from Lander Furthers, the brewing vendor in Shadowhaven. It costs roughly 2pp per bark, so it's a bit expensive, but the tannin can be sold back for a reasonable amount, plus Tailors use it so you can sell it to them. Also, the recipe is quick and easy, minimal arseing about, limited stress to the wrist. If you can afford it, do it.<p><br>


<b>****Skull Ale.</b> If you fancy doing this, get thee hence to South Karana and kill an Undead Cyclops. Nick it's skull and brew with it. The skull is NOT used up during the process.<p><br>

<b>*****Brut Champagne.</b> This is to get you the last couple of points after Mino's. A relatively simple recipe, aside from needing to brew Soda water (1 Soda, 1 water triv 58. Buy the Soda from Ryver Mudhands in Shadowhaven, if you're not a shorty, then either do the necklace quest, or bribe someone to buy it for you), and the Champagne Magnum. This is made by jewellers, and is trivial at 196 skill. 1 Enchanted Gold Bar, 1 Bottle and 1 Opal in a jewellers kit makes 1 Magnum. This Magnum is NOT returned whether you fail or succeed. When making them, remember to put in the frickin' bottle, or you end up with a necklace instead (/bonk self).<br>There are three types of Champagne you can make, Sec, Demi-Sec and Brut, using 1, 2 or 3 grapes respectively. Sec and Demisec trivial at 250, and Brut at over 250, so I have chosen Brut to hopefully get the skillups easier. It should be noted however that Demisec Champagne is used in the Protection of the Cabbage Earring quest, so if you make that instead you can sell it on to questors.<p><br><br>
