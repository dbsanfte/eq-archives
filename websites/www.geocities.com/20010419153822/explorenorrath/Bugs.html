He is also working with Verant to get these fixed.</span></font></i><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"><br><br></span></font><u><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Auto-follow Bug (Confirmed):</span></font></u><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">  This bug is fairly harmless unless you didn't want to continue following an ex-party member: If you are grouped with someone, such as having your main on one account auto-following your twink on a second account around, and then you disband so that your main doesn't steal your twink's experience, you will NOT stop following around the formerly-grouped person until you specifically press an arrow key or some other key which breaks the auto-follow. So if you wanted to stay in one spot with that main character, for instance, be sure you turn or sit or some other method to discontinue the auto-follow.<br><br></span></font><u><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Quest-Completion Bug (Confirmed):</span></font></u><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">  This is one of the 'good' bugs if you are trying to raise faction, so expect it to be fixed fairly soon: If you are questing in, say, Skyshrine, and you get to a certain faction (such as apprehensive or indifferent) to where you cannot receive some of the lower-faction quests any longer, it's possible to continue getting those quests by either using Guise of the Deceiver (drops you one faction level) or werewolf form (drops you two faction levels). Then you'd continue doing the lower, easier quests in those forms, and when you were no longer able to get the quests in either form, and removed that form, you would actually be one to two levels higher in faction than should have been theoretically possible from the lower-faction quests. So if you started apprehensive, and did the quests until indifferent, then used guise to get to apprehensive again, the quests would take you one level higher than indifferent, in faction (I believe that would be 'amiably', but you get the idea). This is mainly important to remember if you are TRYING to get a quest and cannot because you are in guise or werewolf form; simply remove the form and you should be able to get the quest. But it also obviously works the other way around, which would be considered a bug and quite possibly also an exploit. Be warned.<br><br></span></font><u><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Necros as Clerics (Confirmed):</span></font></u><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> Ah, nothing like the lovers of undead putting the battlers of undead out of business. The 'Eye of Zomm' spell that some classes get generates an npc mob for the caster; the mob has low hit points, but is still tapable by the necromancer's lifetap line of spells (which gives them hitpoints by draining the life of monsters). What this means is, if a party does not have a cleric, the necromancer could in theory tap a chain-cast eye of zomm pet, and use that to heal himself from having pacted (heal-others spell) members of the party. This could go on infinitely, as the eye of zomm is a fairly low-mana spell. Clerics be warned, competition could soon be encroaching upon your territory!<br><br></span></font><u><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Language Mastery (Confirmed):</span></font></u><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> Want to raise your proficiency in all those bizaare languages in a hurry? EQ has a built-in feature which makes this possible, with a partner. Basically, you can train someone in a language by one point higher than you know it, yourself. What this means is, suppose you know all languages at zero skill, and visit your guild to put one training point into each of them. Then you start spamming your friend Bobzky with each language, until he has gotten two skill increases. He now knows all languages to (2) proficiency. Now he can macro-spam you with the languages, until YOU get two skill increases. That takes you from (1) to (3) proficiency. Please note: For this to work, you must zone after each second skill increase (per player). As you can see, given just a little time, you can both master any language on the planet, using this method. Proficiency table is listed </span></font><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/Skills/Skill_Table.html"><font color="#990000" face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">here</span></font></a><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">.<br><br><br><br><br></span></font><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="-1"><span style="font-size:12">Page updated: 02/23/0</span></font></b></i><font face="Verdana" size="-1"><span style="font-size:12">1</span></font></td>
