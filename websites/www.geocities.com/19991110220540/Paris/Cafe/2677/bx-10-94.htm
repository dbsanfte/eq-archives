<p><font size=6><strong>Hicks Pics Still Kick</strong></font><strong><br>
</strong><em><strong>The Independent, October 23, 1994</strong></em><strong><br>
<br>
It is nearly eight months since the death of Bill Hicks. The brave, iconoclastic 
American comedian would have been 33 in a few weeks' time. It might seem 
depressing to dwell on this, but it needs dwelling on. Death has cast an abnormally 
long shadow over the lively arts this year. Hicks, with River Phoenix and Kurt 
Cobain, forms a trio of prematurely departed icons who prove that whatever else you 
think of the grim reaper, he certainly has taste. Their passing has left a spiritual hole 
in the middle of each of their respective fields that is too big to walk around. <br>
<br>
For both Cobain and Phoenix, the end was - purposely or otherwise - 
self-administered. Hicks was different. His act celebrated hedonism; he spoke out in 
favour of recreational drug use and was a fanatical defender of the right to smoke. 
Early on in his career, his profligate lifestyle seemed to court the excess-fuelled, 
rock-star premature death which eventually befell his fellow Texan 'outlaw comic' 
Sam Kinison; yet he eventually died of natural causes in the ugly form of pancreatic 
cancer, having long since given up not only drink and drugs but cigarettes too. <br>
<br>
&quot;The comic is a flame - like Shiva the destroyer,&quot; Hicks told The New Yorker critic 
John Lahr in an idealistic moment in 1992. &quot;He keeps cutting everything back to the 
moment.&quot; Comics are so much of the moment that it is difficult enough to capture 
what is good about them on TV when they are alive, and harder still for them to have 
an after-life. Even when they do - as, say, Lenny Bruce has - anyone who didn't see 
them perform will find it hard to remember what was funny about them. <br>
<br>
The way forward might, as so often, lie in commercial exploitation. It's Just a Ride, 
the tribute film which makes up the first part of Totally Bill Hicks, a new Channel 4 
video, offers fascinating insights into Hicks' life and work. There are revealing 
interviews with his parents, God-fearing Southerners who &quot;couldn't understand why 
Bill used the f-word so much&quot;; and with the geeky friends with whom he used to 
sneak off to perform at a rough-and-tumble Houston comedy club at the tender age 
of 15. <br>
<br>
The affection and envy mingling in the eyes of his fellow comedians speak volumes 
about Hicks' talents. Comedians are competitive, not given to abasing themselves at 
the feet of their peers. Eddie Izzard and Sean Hughes represent Hicks' British 
fan-club (it could just have easily have been Rob Newman and Steve Coogan), but 
American Brett Butler is more revealing. Hicks' treacle-voiced fellow Southerner, 
star of C4's Grace Under Fire, observes that &quot;For all the talk about Bill being like 
Hendrix or Dylan or Jim Morrison, it was Jesus he wanted to be.&quot; <br>
<br>
The Messianic tendencies are apparent as he emerges from tongues of fire on to the 
Dominion Theatre stage on the last night of his 1992 Revelations tour. But it's the 
ordinariness of his appearance which is striking once he's taken his cowboy hat off - 
slicked-back hair, button eyes and chubby face like a potato in a stocking - and which 
throws the brilliance of his performance into even sharper relief. <br>
<br>
Bill Hicks' command of the stage and of his material was so complete that it 
sometimes seems like he's using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, even when he isn't. 
His intensity - especially when personifying his own libido as the demonic Goat-boy 
(motto: &quot;Let me wear you like a feed bag&quot;) - is almost frightening. Like the preacher 
he often fancied himself to be, Hicks could be self-righteous and he could hector, but 
he could also be devastating. &quot;Ever noticed,&quot; he asks, &quot;how creationists look really 
unevolved?&quot; The industrial-strength sarcasm which went down so well in Britain 
landed him in trouble in the US, especially when applied to such targets as 
fundamentalist Christianity. Last October, when he turned his scorn on 
anti-abortionists in a routine being recorded for the David Letterman Show (&quot;These 
pro-lifers... You ever look at their faces?... screws up face and assumes bitter, 
pinched voice 'I'm pro-life'... Boy, they look it, don't they?&quot;), Hicks became too hot 
for even the supposedly cutting-edge Letterman to handle. <br>
<br>
The cancelled slot had been recorded in the same theatre where Elvis's pelvis was 
deemed unsuitable for the Ed Sullivan Show, and the ensuing censorship furore 
spurred Hicks on through the rigours of chemotherapy to a final epic bout of 
creativity (&quot;It was like Bill to the tenth power,&quot; said friend and producer Kevin 
Booth. &quot;He couldn't be involved in any kind of mundane situation for even a 
second&quot;). <br>
<br>
The fruits of this - two complete albums of new material and videos of his last live 
performances - should emerge early in the new year: further timely reminders that a 
comedian can do something more than just remember old television programmes or 
analyse the difference between cats and dogs. And if American fundamentalists don't 
like it - &quot;Well,&quot; as Bill Hicks used to coo with deadly relish, &quot;forgive me.&quot; <br>
