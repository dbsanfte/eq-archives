      <p>Avenging Storm Raid Point System </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Awarding of points </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Points will be awarded as follows (raids will be announced appx. a week 
        ahead of time) </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>3 points - for being at the raid from start to finish </p>
      <p>2 points - for arriving late or leaving early </p>
      <p>1 point - for contacting Timoane or Kindoz prior to the raid to let us 
        know you cannot attend </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>If you do not attend and do not let Kindoz or the Raid Officer know why 
        ahead of time no points will be rewarded. Lvl limits will be announced 
        along with each raid, if you do not fall within the limits you may attend 
        raid at your own discretion (within reason). if you fall below the lvl 
        limit and let us know that you will not be attending based on that fact 
        you will still be awarded the one point for making contact. Points earned 
        in lower lvl raids will be able to be carried into higher lvl raids as 
        you progress in level. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Points will only be awarded to one account per raid. It is up to you 
        to decide which of your characters will get the point(s) for each raid. 
        Each of your characters will have his/her own point pool. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>There will be no trading or selling of points between characters. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Spending of Points: </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>First off, the entire system is still based on Need Before Greed (NBG). 
        If you cannot use something, you will not be able to roll on it unless 
        no one wishes to spend any points on the item. </p>
      <p>Points will be spent to 'buy' a chance to roll on an item. At the end 
        of the raid, each item to be awarded will be announced in turn by Kindoz 
        or another officer in his absence. Up to 10 points can be spent on a single 
        roll. In this manner the individual, rather than Guild Officers, is deciding 
        how much value that item has to him. Each person who intends to roll on 
        the item will be announced, then each person will send a /tell to the 
        officer in charge letting him/her know how many points they intend to 
        use. If you win the item you lose all the points you risked, if you lose 
        you only lose one (1) point. This will work as demonstrated in the following 
        example: </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>After a Kael raid in which a pair of Coldain Skin gloves drops, Seack 
        and Timoane both decide to roll on them. They announce in public that 
        they intend to roll on the item, then Kindoz asks each of them in private 
        how many points they wish to spend on the roll. Timoane has a pair of 
        Gloves of the Damned already, and Coldain skin gloves really aren't THAT 
        much of an improvement for me so he decide to only spend 4 points. Seack 
        (being the soloing addict that he is) is still wearing a pair of newbie 
        cloth gloves and really needs the Coldain skin gloves so he decides to 
        spend 12 points on the roll. After Kindoz gets the info he announces what 
        the rolls will be in a fashion like this: Kindoz says: '1 to 4 Timoane, 
        5 to 16 Seack' (1 to 4 being a 4 point spread and 5 to 16 being a 12 point 
        spread). he then /randoms 1 to 16 and gets a 7. As 7 falls in between 
        5 and 16 Seack wins the gloves and loses his 12 points. As Timoane did 
        not win, he only loses 1 of the 4 points he risked and good heartedly 
        congratulates Seack, being the courteous gnome that he is, and asks him 
        what he's going to do with his uber cloth gloves now. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Kindoz will be the keeper of the points and will normally be the one 
        handing out loot and doing the /randoms. Officers running jr. lvl raids 
        should report their point earnings to me or Kindoz in game or by email 
        along with any points spent on the raid. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Exceptions </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>As with any rule there are exceptions here. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>-Epic pieces will be awarded based on your lvl and progress towards Epic 
        so far as decided ultimately by Kindoz. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>-In a case where noone wishes to spend any points to roll on an item, 
        the item will become a 'free for all roll' with each person interested 
        getting one freebie point towards the roll. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>-if only one person is interested in the item, and they are able to use 
        it, it will be given to them at the cost of one point. You may go in the 
        hole (not that Hole,.. or THAT hole!) for a number of points determined 
        at the time by Kindoz. Exception to this is if the item is no drop, class 
        exclusive and you have no one to compete against you for it. </p>
