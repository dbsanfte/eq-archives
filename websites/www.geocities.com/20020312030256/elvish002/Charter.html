	<td><b><font size="+2"><span style="font-size:24">Elvish Impersonators</span></font></b><span style="font-size:14"><br></span><b><span style="font-size:14">Guild Charter</span></b><span style="font-size:14"><br><br><br></span><b><u><span style="font-size:14">Historical Background</span></b></u><span style="font-size:14"><br><br> The Elvish Impersonator movement arose from the desire of a small band of Norrathians to imitate the life of the legendary Bard herbalist Elvish Parsley.&nbsp; Elvish Parsley walked Norrath many generations ago, spreading good cheer and happiness wherever he went, while working discreetly to dispel evil from the land.&nbsp; Following in his footsteps, we seek to continue the work he began so long ago, attempting to leave the world a better place than we found it.<br><br> While the vast majority of Norrath’s most respected historians agree that Elvish died long ago, we Elvish Impersonators believe that Elvish, having reached the highest levels of perfection as a Bard, instead merely retired to one of his most treasured resting places, far to the west of Odus on an island known in Elvish’s writings as “Vegas”.&nbsp; We Elvish Impersonators believe that upon reaching an Elvish-like perfection ourselves, we, too may retire to Vegas, a land where stars fall gently to the ground and who’s denizens do nothing but play games day and night.<br><br><br></span><b><u><span style="font-size:14">The Ways of Elvish</span></b></u><span style="font-size:14"><br><br> Having immersed ourselves in the study of Elvish’s writings, we have identified a series of key principles central to Elvish’s philosophy.&nbsp; All Elvish Impersonators strive to adhere to these principles, while all new acolytes will be called upon to assume the same pursuit.&nbsp; <br> Among the Philosophies of Elvish are:<br><br>· “Return to Sender” As Elvish did before use, we seek to use our energies to return all evil creatures, including orcs, goblins, and the various forms of undead, back to the blackest pits of the underworld from whence they came.&nbsp; Guild outings often focus on our practicing this aspect of Elvish’s personality.<br>· “Are You Lonesome Tonight?” An Elvish Impersonator always keeps an eye out for other adventurers who need help, and offers to help wherever possible and practical.<br>· “Don’t Be Cruel” All Elvish Impersonators conduct ourselves with respect for not only our fellow guild members, but also the general population of Norrath.&nbsp; Even in cases where we cannot help, we will at least pass with a kind word.<br>· “Suspicious Minds” While standing for good and the welfare of others, an Elvish Impersonator is always on guard against those who might take advantage of his/her generosity.<br>· “(You Ain’t Nothin’ But a) Hound Dog” While we focus our battle on the evil and destructive creatures of Norrath, we believe that our struggle will sometimes lead us to cleanse the land by dueling with antagonistic, hateful, or overly rude adventurers (i.e. those who choose to embody the opposite of Elvish’s ideals).<br>·&nbsp; “Viva Las Vegas” As a group, Elvish Impersonators strive to travel far and wide, to see all the wonders of Norrath and its inhabitants.&nbsp; One might see us in a wide variety of places as we travel around spreading the philosophies of Elvish. <br>· “That's Alright Mama” Even though the Elvish Impersonator yearns for exploration and adventure, he/she always remembers to honor and respect his/her mother and father.<br><br><br> <br></span><b><u><span style="font-size:14">Commitment</span></b></u><span style="font-size:14"><br> <br>While the writings of Elvish are vast and often difficult to fathom, they add up to one word – happiness!&nbsp; Anyone who would choose to become an Elvish Impersonator makes an implicit commitment to happiness, both for himself/herself and for those he/she encounters on Norrath, particularly fellow Impersonators.&nbsp; This means conducting oneself with a sense of fun, kindness, and respect for others.<br><br></span><b><u><span style="font-size:14">Membership Requirements</span></b></u><span style="font-size:14"><br> <br>Elvish accepted all who would listen to his words, and so do we.&nbsp; Prospective members need not meet any particular requirements of skill, experience, race, class, etc.&nbsp; Rather, they must simply display an ability and willingness to live according to Elvish’s teachings.&nbsp; The best way to prove one’s willingness is to find an E.I. and interact with him/her for a while.&nbsp; <br>Generally, a short period of sojourning together will allow the “Suspicious Mind” of a seasoned E.I. to determine whether a prospective acolyte is truly committed to the ways of Elvish.&nbsp; Likewise, the prospect can see for him/herself the true nature of the path.&nbsp; If the path is not right for someone, he or she will quickly feel “All Shook Up” as a result of exposure to the ways of Elvish.<br>Occasionally, of course, a “Devil In Disguise” will slip into the ranks.&nbsp; If a member repeatedly creates “A Mess of Blues” by violating Elvish’s most basic teachings about kindness, respect, and fun, he/she will be brought to the “Jailhouse Rock” and expelled from the group.<br>While these membership requirements are, in and of themselves, quite easy, we do observe one very important initiation ritual - all applicants to the E.I. Guild will ultimately prove their understanding by reciting at least one of Elvish’s writings in the presence of one or more guild members.</span></td>
