In 30 minutes, you can have a character ready to explore this zone and see all the fascinating detail and work Verant has put into The City of Mist.<br><br></span></font><b><u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">A Brief History of The City of Mist:</span></font></b></u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">  For those fortunate enough to have seen it, there is no denying this is one of the most beautiful, exotic zones in the game. Not only the city itself, but also the 'second' city located far above the first and not frequently explored by players. Some history of the royalty, and their subjects who used to inhabit the city, can be gleaned from pages dropped by mobs within the zone; most are in Lizardman tongue and you'll need that skill to be able to read these documents.<br></span></font><b><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"><br></span></font></b><b><u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">How Can I Explore The City of Mist?:</span></font></b></u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">  The easy part! All you need do is create a newbie rogue, and your sneak/hide skills will see you through. I explored with a level five, though it can be done with as low as level one, provided you chose a race/class combination that gets both sneak and hide at that level. I chose level 5 because my sneak/hide skills would be more polished and therefore more reliable. You can easily get those few levels in about 20 to 30 minutes by merely having one of the druids near a given newbie area (or your own personal druid friend) buff you with sow, thorns, and hit points, and then off you go to slaughter and level up fast. It is important during this time that you hotkey the 'sneak' and 'hide' abilities and use them often, so that your skill increases as fast as possible to prepare you for your explorations.<br><br></span></font><b><u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">How To Sneak/Hide to Avoid Detection: </span></font></b></u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> You will be amazed at these two early skills that rogues get. To use them to their fullest advantage (and you should pratice this to get familiar with it before you enter an area where you will need them), please see the guide on</span></font><font color="#990000" face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> </span></font><a href="New_Rogue.html"><font color="#990000" face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">'Creating a New Rogue'</span></font></a><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">.<br></span></font><b><u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"><br>Getting to The City of Mist</span></font></b></u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">: Now it's time to visit Emerald Jungle, location of the City of Mist. By druid or wizard transport (must evacuate from a Kunark dungeon to use this), travel approximately easterly to the entrance near location pos300, neg2000. <br><br>Once you zone in, be sure to get bound in the City of Mist if you can. You won't care about dying at this level, but it makes it easier to continue the adventure if you don't have to make another long trip to keep exploring. <br><br>Now you are in the City of Mist, and I'll leave it to you to explore the sites and use any maps available, to make the the most of this adventure. For an interesting challenge, turn your clipping plane to high as you wander through the city, look up and note the beautiful 'second city' in the sky overhead; an interesting challenge will be to figure out how to get to it without a 200+ lockpick skill. (If you do figure out how... tell ME!)&nbsp; Some mobs in this zone may see through your sneak/hide, but in general, nothing will attack you as long as you keep the skills in use.<br><br>See some </span></font><a href="City_Mist_SS.html"><font color="#990000" face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">screenshots</span></font></a><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> I took while there, to further pique your interest!<br><br><br><br></span></font><b><i><font face="Arial" size="-1"><span style="font-size:12">Page Updated: 01/24/01</span></font></b></i></td>
