About. . .</b><br>
A hatelisting for those who really hate detention approved by <a href="http://thehatelistings.org" target="_blank">thehatelistings.org</a>. It'ss just a short history really. I got the idea while I was watching TV one afternoon and while browsing my attention was caught in this popular comedy TV show about a kid been detention by his teacher in school. It really sucks doesn't it? Well, there aren't really any detentions here but as far as I know detentions are somewhat like giving you that extra 2 hours sitting in one room with the rest of the guys who has giving detention while the rest of entire school is free outside without the horrfying detention!<br><br>

I think detention is not the way to give kid's a discipline. I mean, detention is just a detention inside a four-corned-wall. For those who are already "immune" with detention, I guess this is not the kind of solution to give those kid's the so-called discipline we always teach them. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it don't. But above all, detention really sucks. Hate it? or love it?<br><br>

What is a hate listing?<br></b>
A "hate"listing is the exact opposite of a fanlisting- it's a site/listing for all of those who hate a particular person, place or thing. The purpose of this site is to be a hub of all of the hatelistings out there.<br><br>
