<img src="http://everquest.gamestats.com/c_bard.gif">Bards are almost always welcome in
                    a group.  However, be warned that
                    they do not make a great solo
                    class.  While they are not as good at
                    any particular thing as any of the
                    specialized classes, they do a little
                    of everything.  They also can cast
                    forever since they don't use up
          mana when they sing.  Such ablilties as heal,
          find corpse, accelerated travel and group
          invisibility make a bard invaluable group
          members.  While the bard only does one thing
          at a time, he does it real well.  If you are a
          social person who likes meeting new people,
          the bard may be for you.  If you like to go off on
          your own a lot or are shy about travelling with
          strangers, you may want to think twice about
          playing a bard.  I once saw a pretty well
          reasoned argument on a message board that
          the most powerful group you could put together
          would be 6 bards.  One suggestion.  It costs
          you nothing but a little time to locate a corpse
          for someone.  Yet that can get you a friend who
          may someday save your life.  Don't be stingy
          with your locate song. <p>
