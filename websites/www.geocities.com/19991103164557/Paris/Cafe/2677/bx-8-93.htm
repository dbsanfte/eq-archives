<p><font size=5><strong>Is Bill Hicks the Voice Of 1990s Comedy?</strong></font><strong><br>
<br>
</strong><em><strong>The San Francisco Chronicle, August 8, 1993</strong></em><strong><br>
<br>
It's rare to be astonished by a performer, but astonishing is the only word for Bill 
Hicks' recent show at Cobb's Comedy Club. Hicks may be the freshest -- surely most 
daring -- voice in stand-up in years: dangerous, incisive, vulgar, original and very 
funny. <br>
<br>
Midway through his act, I realized just how banal and predictable comedy has grown, 
with too few exceptions, and how long since a distinctive personality arrived, a new 
voice with a compelling message. Rick Reynolds made a definite splash, with ripples, 
but Reynolds soothes whereas Hicks seethes. <br>
<br>
You have to go back to Mort Sahl, Lenny Bruce, George Carlin and Richard Pryor to 
recall such an individual, piercing, idiosyncratic mind. He doesn't just make noise, or 
trouble, but says something that hasn't been said before, venturing into new areas 
and taking on riskier issues than Dan Quayle and Madonna, both beneath Hicks' 
contempt. <br>
<br>
He saves his bile for worthier topics -- Jay Leno, CNN and childbirth are matters he 
takes special pleasure in mocking in the most coruscating, often crude, terms. 
However rough he gets, I felt my head opened up by Hicks. He's not everyone's cup 
of chicory, and may put off as many people as he entices, but if you like your comic 
witch's brew strong, black and laced with acid, Bill Hicks is the wit of choice. <br>
<br>
Comedy lately has been quiescent, a nice way of saying dead. The comedy-club 
renaissance is long over and many rooms are hurting, having lost their sense of 
excitement, daring and mission, if they ever had one. Even when comedy clubs were 
hot they lacked a social conscience. The influx of female, ethnic and gay comics 
created a few semi-radical blips, yet even the most ingenious or outrageous gay 
comics, such as Mark Davis and Marga Gomez, seem tame alongside Hicks. 
Everyone does. <br>
<br>
Hicks is called an 'outlaw' comic, a sloppy label to slap on him. He leaves the work of 
such comic gangsters as Bob Goldthwait, the late Sam Kinison and Andrew Dice 
Clay in the dust. His jokes don't just shock, which anyone can do by stringing 
together the right words; they take you in a new direction, challenge or rile you. <br>
<br>
By 1990, comedy clubs began running on automatic pilot. The party was over. Club 
owners (and audiences) got lazy, threw open the doors and booked any stand-up who 
was upright. Many clubs made money just by keeping open. Crowds came out of 
habit, to see whoever was on the bill, so there was no need to search for anybody 
better or unique. Once cable made comedy as available, and as exciting, as weather 
reports, the comedy club turned into the old mellow neighborhood tavern where you 
pop in for a quick one to wind down. Hicks winds you up. <br>
<br>
At Hicks' show, the audience was made up mostly people in their 20s and 30s who 
had wandered in after dinner to check out the action, dressed in sweat shirts, shorts 
and baseball caps. They sipped Anchor Steam and, after 15 minutes of standard 
shtick from a warm-up act, were stunned by what they heard from Hicks. <br>
<br>
Bill Hicks isn't a nonentity -- he's done David Letterman's show 11 times and was 
Rolling Stone's comic to watch in '93 -- but the crowd seemed largely made up of 
strangers to his lacerating wit. The laughs sounded uneasy, tentative, almost like 
gasps, many wondering if they'd heard what they thought they heard; a few people 
left. It felt like the early subversive '60s, the era of Sahl, Bruce, Tom Lehrer, and 
Nichols and May, when comedians were called 'social satirists' as opposed to 
'stand-up comics' -- vitriolic wits, not just jesters. <br>
<br>
Now, in a creative as well as economic recession, club owners are trying to reinvent 
the form, just to survive (the Holy City Zoo closes August 30), so that comedy clubs 
don't go the way of cabarets. Clubs die when owners stop being adventurous, book 
indiscriminately, cease scouting new talent in New York and don't develop 
performers or shape acts. <br>
<br>
Comedy impresario Ann Fox of the Punch Line recently attempted to link cabaret 
and comedy at the Jessup Cafe in Larkspur. The first half featured singers Ruth 
Hastings, Craig Jessup and Barry Lloyd in an hour of well-chosen, fondly performed, 
sophisticated show tunes. The second half showcased wit Dexter Madison doing his 
thinking man's Foster Brooks. It was an interesting, enterprising concept that didn't 
quite work -- the two forms failed to dovetail and Madison's droll character is 
funniest in brief doses. All in all, however, it was a decent effort to put comedy in a 
new context. <br>
<br>
Improv owner Mark Anderson -- who owns eight rooms around the country -- also is 
scratching around for a format that will combine improvisational and sketch comedy. 
He believes sketch comedy is the wave of the future, even if it's also the wave of the 
past -- a throwback to early TV, revues and vaudeville. Anderson is trying out groups 
in his rooms like a man tinkering in his basement to find a formula that can revitalize 
nightclub comedy. <br>
<br>
Sketch comedy had its last hurrah in the '60s and '70s, with such groups as Second 
City, Beyond the Fringe, the Committee, the Premise and Cambridge Circus 
(featuring a gawky guy named John Cleese) that satirized the scene. Second City 
became a brand name, with road companies that, like protozoa dividing and 
recombining, re- emerged in Canada as SCTV and, in New York, as the National 
Lampoon Lemmings, which spawned 'Saturday Night Live.' <br>
<br>
'Saturday Night Live' gave sketch comedy a huge boost, but 'SNL' long ago lost its 
sting, relying largely on goofy characters, impersonations and TV takeoffs. The 
original 'SNL' wasn't that socially relevant but the sketches were sharper and the 
comics intrinsically funnier and unique. 'SNL' inspired such offspring as Los Angeles' 
Groundlings or, here, the National Theater of the Deranged, Faultline and Pulp 
Playhouse. <br>
<br>
After Bruce, Sahl, et al., folk singers took up the social agenda, then rock, rap and 
now maybe it's comedy's turn again to define the landscape in smart, aware 
monologues and sketches that lambaste rather than lull like humorous elevator 
Muzak. Humzak? At Hicks' show, there were startled looks on faces that had grown 
up with Robin Williams, Steve Martin, Leno and Jerry Seinfeld. The crowd was less 
shocked at the jokes than at the idea of a comic with a strong point of view and a 
tough slant on America, the radical notion that a comic could be both funny and 
angry. <br>
<br>
On the way out, I remembered Sahl's famous tag line: 'Is there anyone here I haven't 
offended?' It felt good to be offended again. <br>
