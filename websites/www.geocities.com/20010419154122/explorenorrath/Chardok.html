In no time at all, you can have a character ready to explore this zone (or even use your current one, if you go the faction route described below) and see all the fascinating detail and work Verant has put into this dungeon and its inhabitants.<br><br></span></font><b><u><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">A Brief History of Chardok:</span></font></b></u><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">  Chardok, with its royalty and unique assortment of npcs, does not appear to have much official history associated with it. I have searched both under sarnaks and their opposing-faction goblins, to no avail. Anyone having or creating a history for this interesting zone is encouraged to share it here. Please </span></font><a href="mailto:site_exno@hotmail.com"><font color="#990000" face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">email</span></font></a><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> me to contribute.<br></span></font><b><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"><br></span></font></b><b><u><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">How Can I Explore Chardok?:</span></font></b></u><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">  There are actually two ways you can explore this zone without dying for it: <br><br>The first, and one I'd most recommend if you are into the exploration aspect of the game, is to slaughter members of the Mountain Death Clan. These are goblins located in various parts of Kunark (click </span></font><a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?faction=116"><font color="#990000" face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">here</span></font></a><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> for list of locations and specific mobs) and can easily be killed for faction by even lower-level players; their faction opposes that of the sarnak collective -- Brood of Di'Zok -- located within Chardok. I am not certain the specifics, since it varies by difficulty of mob, but it is possible to be indifferent or even higher, within the walls of Chardok, by killing several of these goblins.&nbsp; From what I understand, if you have never (or rarely) hunted the sarnaks in Kunark, it does not take many of these goblins to get you high enough to freely explore Chardok.<br><br>The second method to be able to explore this zone is to create a newbie rogue, and your sneak/hide skills will see you through. I explored with a level five, which you can easily get to in about 20 to 30 minutes of play by merely having one of the druids near a given newbie area (or your own personal druid friend) buff you with sow, thorns, and hit points, and then off you go to slaughter and level up fast. It is important during this time that you hotkey the 'sneak' and 'hide' abilities and use them often, so that your skill increases as fast as possible to prepare you for your explorations. A word of warning when using this method: Some mobs within Chardok (noteably the mangler-type dinosaur dogs) see through even sneak-hide. I managed to get fairly far in, but run into one mangler, and you will be exiting the zone promptly. I suggest using a map (</span></font><a href="http://www.eqmaps.com/zone.php3?tag=chardok"><font color="#990000" face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">EQMaps</span></font></a><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> has several good ones) to avoid the mangler-intensive areas, if you wish to explore. <br><br></span></font><b><u><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">How To Sneak/Hide to Avoid Detection: </span></font></b></u><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> You will be amazed at these two early skills that rogues get. To use them to their fullest advantage (and you should pratice this to get familiar with it before you enter an area where you will need them), please see the guide on</span></font><font color="#990000" face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> </span></font><a href="New_Rogue.html"><font color="#990000" face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">'Creating a New Rogue'</span></font></a><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">.<br></span></font><b><u><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"><br>Getting to Chardok</span></font></b></u><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">: The easiest way to get to Chardok is to enter Burning Woods from the Dreadlands zone. Once you enter, head straight until you hit a dirt path at the base of a hill, and follow it to the left. When the path ends at the giant fort, continue on as if the path were still there (roughly straight, to the other side of the giant fort) then head directly right of your position. You will hit a zone wall shortly; follow it to the right, sticking close to the wall. When the wall turns and you are able to go North, do so ... this will lead you to the sarnak fort. Once you enter in, you will be facing an entrance directly ahead of you, and two more entrances to your right. Take the first entrance to your right, to get to the Chardok zone-in.<br><br>Now you are in the Chardok, and I'll leave it to you to explore the sites and use any maps available, to make the the most of this adventure. If you went the faction route, you should be able to explore to your heart's content, without worrying about attack. If you are using the sneak-hide method, do be cautious of mobs that might see through it and cut short your trip.<br><br>Unfortunately, the screenshots of various structures and mobs within this zone turned out too dark to be of any use in passing on.<br><br><br><br></span></font><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="-1"><span style="font-size:12">Page Updated: 02/07/01</span></font></b></i></td>
