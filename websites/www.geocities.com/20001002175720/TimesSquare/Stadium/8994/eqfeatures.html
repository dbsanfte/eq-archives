<p>An RPG designed from the ground up to be a massively online game. The world of EverQuest was created to support over 1,000 players simultaneously per server.</p>

<p>Choose from 12 races and 14 classes, including dwarves, ogres, trolls, rangers, wizards, and rogues.</p>

<p>Over 40 unique skills and innate abilities.</p>

<p>Thousands of items to earn and collect, both magical and mundane, including artifacts of great power.</p>

<p>Five enormous continents to explore, as well as other dimensions and planes.</p>

<p>Adventuring alone is supported, and forming parties to complete quests encouraged. Each class and race has strengths and weaknesses, and the stronger groups will be those who balance their parties and work as a team.</p>

<p>Hundreds of spells to learn, with five separate magic-using classes. Also, weapons can be enchanted to cast spells themselves.</p>

<p>Player killing (Pkilling) is controlled such that those who wish to engage in it may do so, however those who do not are completely immune.</p>

<p>Real 3D environment, with multiple camera views. Switch from exploring in first person to any number of top down views to facilitate tactical combat.</p>

<p>Beautiful SVGA (640x480) 16 bit color scenery, with adventure zones including indoor dungeons, arctic tundra, vast deserts, and even completely underwater environments.</p> 

<p>Truly polygonal characters, both players and NPC’s – no sprites here.</p>

<p>Optimized for the latest graphic accelerator technology with Direct 3D support.</p>
