<center><h2><i><u> Rogue Message </center></h2></i></u><p>
An NPC in the rogue's guild in Neriak needs you to
take message to the dark elf lady on the shores of freeport (swim
south from the docks around the corner - better like sharks if you go on this one). The message is regarding receiving the take of the loot from local rogues.  Delivering message gets you experience returning with loot gets you experience, coins and a minor item. After delivering the message, you will be asked to kill the daughter of the Innkeeper (also at the docks).  Not sure what you get for killing her. <p>
<center><h2><i><u> Sentry Xyrinn </center></h2></i></u><p>
Somewhere in the Ocean of Tears there is an undead island (rough loc of -604.96, -7343.81). The island is populated by a few greater skeletons, a couple gargoyles, and four specters. There
you will find stranded a female paladin named Sentry Xyrin. She
mentions that she was part of a [boat disaster] and that she is from the temple of Marr in Freeport.  She will ask you to get her a [Potion of Marr] from Serna Tasknon is the Temple of Marr in Freeport. With the potion she will be able to regain her strength and take on the undead. (You can also initiate this quest by first speaking to someone in the Temple of Marr, getting the potion, and from that point on learning of Sentry Xyrinn's location and going to look for her, which is actually the way most people would discover the quest). You have to get the bottle from the Temple of Marr and then bring the bottle to all the 8 guards in alphabetical order.  The guards and the order are as
follows:  ANDLIN  (Walks around outside wall); BORIS (Downstairs
stationary); GALLIUS  (Outside by front door); JANEAL (Downstairs
stationary); MEIGHAN (Outside by front door); THEO  (Patrols
inside on upper levels); WARREN (Patrols inside on lower levels);
XYRINN (final sentry in OoT). It seems that if your faction is not high enough you can't get the bottle.  When you give it to the last person (not including Xyrinn) he will tell you that she went to the Sisterhood of Erolisi. The sisters will tell you she is either dead or stranded on a nearby island. Then go to the island where she is stranded and give the bottle to her.  She will give it back to you to take back to the temple, after which you will be done.  I have been told that if you kill all of the spectres and other undead that he was going to kill and then give
him the potion, he will stand there for a while and then drop the
Deepwater Harpoon . I cannot confirm this.<img src="http://everquest.gamestats.com/equipment/graphics5/deepwaterharpoon.GIF"> <p>
<center><h2><i><u> Shark Hunting </center></h2></i></u><p>
A knight in the hall of truth needs shark skins to make shields.  He gives you a container to fill with two sharkskins and
combine.  You can kill the sharks or buy the skins, but you probably won't get your money back if you buy them.  Return for increased faction with the Knights of Truth, experience and a decent item (sometimes a potion of disease warding) or even the actual Sharkskin Shield <img src="http://everquest.gamestats.com/equipment/graphics5/sharkskinshield.GIF"><p>
