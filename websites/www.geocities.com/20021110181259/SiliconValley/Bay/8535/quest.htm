<CENTER>The Quest Begins...</CENTER>

<CENTER>Descending into the endless stairway, darkness surrounded my soul
like the wings of a demon, feeding on my fears of what my destiny may hold.
The ring of light, given to me by a powerful Magi of an ancient Elven Race
burned my finger, warning me of the fiendish horde of vile creatures, waiting
in eager anticipation for the taste of my blood. The warm yellow light
emanating from the ring was not enough to penetrate the murky depths, as
I make my way down the spiraling stairs. I can taste the death of hero's
fallen long ago, rising from the pits like a fowl cloud of despair, choking
my thoughts with gruesome images of battles fought in vane. My mind wanders
as I continue onward....when a savage cry of pain stings my ears. My heart
beats harder as the adrenaline surges through my body, urging me to move
quickly. My feet racing swiftly down the broken stairs, finally reaching
a doorway to the lowest level of the Catacombs. I find the door smashed
open, an eerie luminance bathing my armor like fresh blood from an open
wound. Beads of cold sweat forms on my brow as I look upon the source of
the glow. A Mystic Torch set in the wall by the Keepers of the Dark Order,
burning with the powers of the blackest magic, sending it’s corrupt light
throughout the murky room. Realizing the dangers I may soon encounter,
I reach into my pouch and remove a blue vile, shimmering faintly in my
hand. A powerful potion given only to those with true hearts, and on a
noble quest. Brewed by a witch said to be 2,000 years old, living by the
edge of The Sea of Trees, where few brave to venture. Whispering the forgotten
words, known only by those who have the skill and knowledge to read the
Books of Wonder. I place the vile to my lips and drink the thick potion.
Touching the Rune of FireBall, burned into my arm, the Spell is invoked
with a force that surges through me. Feeling the power surround my being
with a cloud of blue mist, I can hear the cries of my fallen Sisters echoing
from deep within me. Suddenly, sounds of battle reach my ears, screeches
of dying hell spawn, and the yell’s of warriors, shouting encouragement
to another comrade while thunderous booms echo in the background. I remove
my Bow which is strapped to my back and notch an arrow. Enchanted with
the force of a DarkStorm, the Bow charges my arrow with the fury of a ThunderCall.
Racing down the narrow passageways, following the sounds of clashing steel,
and the death cries of the damned. I finally reach the Great Hall, full
of ancient treasures, armor, and weapons. Towards the back of the Hall,
the battle is raging. Two great Warriors, one clad in leather and crimson
chain mail, the other in heavy steel with a shoulder and arm shield. Both
standing back to back, their massive swords slicing through anything that
dares come within reach. On the ground, at their feet, lies a Mage. Protected
by the Warriors, his golden armor ripped from his body, an ornate staff
still clutched in his hand. The fighting is fierce. Masses of Horned Goat
creatures surround the three. Arms, bodies, and heads litter the floor,
soaked in the stench of their own pools of blood. The creatures, driven
to protect the ancient treasures, cut off any possible hope of escape for
the fighters. One of the Warriors took a blow to the head, knocking off
his Helm, and exposing his fragile flesh to the poisonous claws of his
attackers. Bleeding from a fresh gouge above his right eye, he struggles
to keep the beasts back, frantically hacking at the determined creatures.
Tasting the eminent victory at hand, the monsters converge on their weakening
prey, and attack in a concentrated effort to bring down their next meal.
The warrior, preparing to make his stand, is hit hard by the onslaught,
driving him down to one knee. The fate of the three seemed certain. I unleashed
my first arrow. It flew with the speed and accuracy of a Falcon, biting
deep into the chest of the Horned Goat man closest to the downed Warrior,
and releases the charge stored within it. The Goat man’s scream is terrifying
and long, as the charge burns it’s dark heart to ashes. The creatures start
pulling back in confusion, not understanding the reason for their brothers
demise. I unload more charged arrows into the group of Demons, still foundering
as to their fate. The screams repeat over and over again, resounding off
the walls of the Great Hall, cries of desperation and agony echoing deep
into the bowels of the catacombs. As the last of screams fade into the
darkness, a booming howl, deep and powerful reverberates in answer through
the halls, shaking the dust of ages from the ceiling. Another entrance
to the left of me starts to glow, faintly at first, then growing in intensity
as I feel the pounding of massive hoof’s against the cold stone floor,
rushing towards me. A Majestic Horned Goat Beast emerges from the entrance,
glowing orange and red with the power of the Dark Order corrupting it’s
massive frame. His nostrils flare as he locates the scent of mortal blood,
seeking the reason for the desperate call that awoke him from his slumber.
My breath was stolen away as his steaming eyes met mine, draining my courage
and confidence away...I was suddenly paralyzed with fear, my bow dropping
from my hand. In the back of my mind, I could hear the Warriors shouting
frantically, "Look away!... Don’t look in to it’s eyes!" But I was frozen,
powerless as a child. The Warrior with the bloodied eye, grabbed his helm
and heaved it with all the strength remaining within him. I was thrown
back by the impact, the helmet hitting me squarely on my chest plate. The
spell of the beast was undone. The realization of what was happening staggered
me, then I saw the intense form of the monster approaching. Calling upon
the power within me, chanting the foreign words of a forgotten time, I
started to form the ball of fire between my hands. Concentrating on my
work, growing the powerful orb to an immense level as the creature closed
in. I waited until the demon was ten paces from me before releasing the
flaming ball. It hit him with the force of a charging Rhino, engulfing
his frame in a mystical fire that burns down to the bone. As I prepare
a second sphere of flame, the monster rushed to me as if to crush me into
his arms. I blaze the second ball of fire into his face, blinding him.
The creature howled in pain, clawing at the air in frustration. Picking
up my bow, I swung around his side to get a clear shot in, letting loose
my charged arrows. My last arrow is aimed and released, hitting it’s mark
violently through the ear, and discharging directly into his brain. A thunderous
blast was the last thing the beast heard. With a spasm that ran through
every nerve, the brute fell to the floor convulsing, displaying a remarkable
death by slowly melting into the stone, leaving only a glowing mass of
putridness. A sigh of relief escapes me as I look upon the Warriors. Seeing
the magnificent treasures spread about us, I can’t help but wonder if the
fighters be friend or foe. My apprehension is relieved as I am greeted
with a cheerful "Hail mighty Rogue!...Please, join us". I Make my way through
the piles of gore, and reach a small clearing made by the Warriors. Looking
down on the fallen Mage, I can feel the life still within him, but it is
very faint. The wounded Warrior grabs a pack from the floor and removes
a small red vile filled with a healing mixture. He takes a sip of it for
himself, then pours the remaining potion into the Mage’s mouth. We watch
in anticipation for signs of recovery, but I can see the wounds are too
deep for him to recover. Touching the Rune of Life on my arm, I invoke
the power once again. The blue mist forms about me, then collects into
a stream that spirals towards the Mage, flowing into his nose and mouth.
His chest starts to glow with the light of the Heavens, and bursts out
into a steady beam onto the ceiling. The light pulls his body up off the
ground, slowly turning the Mage around, bathing him in the light. He opened
his eyes, startled, and gazes upon the amazed faces of his companions,
then turns to the newcomer that is surrounded in blue mist. His smile is
a welcomed sight as he nods in understanding. Turning to the Warriors,
he laughs and says, "You see my friends... I told you, Chance would be
with us this day!" And so it was...on that day, I earned my name... ~Chance~
The Quest...Part II The next hour was spent collecting the rancid remains
of our attackers. Piling them in a corner of the Great Hall, far enough
away that the stench would not overpower our newly formed Band of adventurers.
The Mage cast an enormous wall of fire over the death heap, burning clean
and true, leaving nothing but the memories of a valiant battle, and a story
worth telling. The four of us then set up camp next to the mounds of treasure,
and explored the wondrous weapons and armor arranged next to the piles
of gold, gems and artifacts. Standing in formation as if to guard the precious
riches, various types of armor, mounted on stands, enchanted us like hungry
children drooling over sweet cakes. Most of the armor was rugged and strong,
forged deep in the Mountains, and able to withstand brutal beatings. The
mighty Dwarven Blacksmiths tempered their steel with special elements which
enhanced the strength and weight of the metals. Transforming the plate
in such a way that a full suit could be worn all day with very little fatigue,
yet...withstand the mightiest blows. The two Warriors didn’t waste any
time stripping off their battered and bloody protection, wrestling like
brothers over the best wear to see who would get first choice. Eventually,
getting bored of their private duel, which I was sure would last a good
length of time, I left the group in search of any items that might interest
me. As I made my way through the maze of artifacts, a subtle sensation
came over me, drawing me towards the back wall, away from the safety of
camp and the light of our fire. I wandered around long tables and broken
chairs, remnants of an ancient order...for whatever purpose, chose this
place to set up their gathering. As if by fate, my path seemed to be set
before me. The sensation grew inside my heart, urging me to a familiar
place, but a place I had never been before. Memories that were not my own
slowly surfaced from the depths of my mind as I closed in on my unknown
destination. A cold chill starts to crawl the length of my spine, seeing
the faint reflections of another soul in my minds eye. The feeling grows
as I make my way to the back wall, walking along the rotting tapestries
that still hang in defiance from the passage of time. I stop beside a pile
of debris and linen, arranged neatly out of sight as if to keep something
hidden. The memories become very strong, feeling the experiences and emotions
swarm through my soul, I watch in horror as the images race across my inner
sight. Rage and betrayal become part of me. My scream is stolen away as
I feel the cold bite of steal carving it’s fate across my tender throat.
The sensation of helplessness is overwhelming. I fall to the ground, my
life essence slowly draining from my body. A sinister laugh and a face
leering over me in triumph is all that is left of my encounter. I know
now why I was drawn to this spot. Uncovering the pile of decaying cloth,
I find the source of my visions. A Sister of my Guild, her decomposed corpse
still clad in full body armor of black obsidian, lay on the floor before
me. The remnants of skin about her throat, and the expression on her decayed
face, still showing the visage of her last moments on this world. To her
side lay a winged helm...the mark of Elven craftsmanship. I then notice
the reason for the removal of her helm, her left ear was gone. A scream
builds inside me as the pain and rage of my fallen sister, demanding revenge
and justice, surfaces from my soul. Not able to fight the pain any longer,
I release my fury in a terrifying cry, my hands bleeding from the nails
biting into my palms. Holding onto the remains of my sister, I swear on
oath of vengeance that will hold true till the day I die. I am startled
by a gentle hand touching my shoulder. Cursing myself for letting my guard
down, I discover the Mage kneeling beside me. The Warriors, still trying
to locate me, make a shambles of the area as they race through the Hall
in response to my outcry. Ready to do battle, the two stare in confusion,
surprised to see the Mage already at my side. I struggle to my feet, exposing
to the warriors the reason for my lament. As they look upon my sister,
the only words I can utter to my new companions are, "Please...Leave me!"
The Warriors, still in a dilemma as to where the battle was, and who’s
body is on the floor, are reluctantly led away by the Mage. Stepping back,
I touch the Rune of Fire on my arm and softly whisper the words of command.
The blue Mist forms about me, collecting itself into a stream, then flowing
down and surrounding my fallen sister. A fire erupts from the corpse, burning
bright and strong, casting light and shadows throughout the Great Hall.
I watch the flames dance in front of me, burning the image of my sisters
killer into my heart. A large scar on the side of his cynical smile, and
deep black eyes, revealing the true nature of his twisted soul. I will
not rest until I find this face, and the Demon it belongs to, then ~Chance~
will have her day! A change in the fire catches my attention. A strange
glow emanating from the pitch black armor, changing the fire into another
form. The fire turned darker with a golden hue, not really made of light,
but of the essence of power. Staring in amazement at the transformation
taking place before me, never before have I experienced anything like this.
I was Spellbound by the growing force which radiated from the suit of armor.
I could feel an arcane power flowing from it, reaching into every nerve
and touching all of my senses as if it were exploring my soul. I could
sense the Great hall around me, feel the depths of cold stone beneath my
feet, here the voices of my comrades far away from me, and taste the musty
dampness in the air. Then, the fire went out, the glow was gone, nothing
remained on the ground except for the full armor plate and a winged helm.
Even the ashes were gone. Kneeling down beside the Obsidian Plate, I situate
my hands just above it, feeling nothing but the chill in the air. I decide
to feel the armor with my finger. To my astonishment, it is cool to the
touch. Looking closely at the dark Plate, I could see majestic artwork
of a Golden Phoenix on the chest plate, and fine trim outlining the edges.
It seemed to be made of some foreign material, black as the deepest pitch,
and light as the air. The arm and leg plates were layered like the scales
of a snake, enabling easy movement for fighting. I had heard of this type
of Elven Plate from stories told to me as a child. Never before did I believe
the stories to be true, yet the proof lay before me. It was said that armor
made by the ancient Race of Elven alchemists, was endowed with mystical
powers. Enabling the wearer to be one with the elements, and resist any
form of attack. Eagerly, I shed my heavy chest plate and leggings, baring
myself to the keepers of the ages. I slip on the waist plate, laden with
intricate artwork that enhanced the curves of my hips. Next, I worked my
way into the full body plate, finally fitting my arms and head through
the awkward armor. Then I slide my arms and legs into the sleek protection
of the snake like skins. I stood up and wondered how anyone could fight
properly with such a bulky load to carry. The plate was unfamiliar to wear,
being new I thought, it would just take getting used to. I picked the helm
up off the ground and held it in my hands, gazing at it. Remembering the
fate of it’s previous owner, I again renewed my oath of vengeance, and
slipped on the winged helm. Without warning or provocation, my inner power
was invoked, forming the mist about me. Something beyond my control was
happening, I knew not what to do. The blue force collected around me, growing
in intensity totally out of my control. Then like the fire, changed in
form, turning to a golden hue. The powerful force took shape around me,
transforming itself about my body into the form of a great bird with wings
of fire. To my amazement, the armor came alive. It shifted into place,
forming itself to the contours of my body like a second skin. Then it linked
with the arm and legging plates to become a whole shell of protection.
I could feel the power collecting once again, entering my soul and infusing
the ancient sorcery with my own powers, becoming a permanent part of me.
Everything about me became stronger, the energy of my spells, the power
of my bow, and my senses once again were heightened to a level I never
thought possible. The force then subsided, leaving me standing alone in
the darkness, reflecting on what had just happened. I walked slowly in
a circle, flexing my arms, and looking down at the plate. I could hardly
tell it was there. The black plate had become a part of me, enabling me
to move freely about as if I were naked. The armor flexed as I did. Looking
at my arm, the Runes of Power now appeared on my plate, infused into the
armor by the arcane power. The armor had indeed become a second skin. I
started back to the campsite to show my new friends my discovery. My footsteps
were silent, giving away nothing to my approach. I could see the campfire,
the two Warriors sitting on the far side clad in there newly acquired Dwarven
Plate. They were facing me, yet did not take notice to my approach. The
Mage sat at the fire with his back to me. The three were looking down at
some parchment, discussing something of great interest. I walked straight
up to them and stood behind the Mage, looking at my friends, waiting for
them to notice. They were still looking at what appeared to be a map of
the Catacombs, forming a strategy to find the hidden entrance to the Caves
of Darkness. I placed my hand gently on the shoulder of the Mage. He let
out a scream and jumped out of his skin, the two Warriors falling over
backwards in response to his reaction. I did not expect this type of greeting
from such a mighty and fearsome group as this. They turned to me, and in
perfect unison, dropped their jaws. I let out a laugh, this being just
the medicine I needed after what I had recently been through. The Mage,
still in shock asked, "How is it that you could approach us unseen?" I
laughed again and said, "How is it I could approach, and you not see me?"
The three surrounded me like children, poking at my plate with wonder in
there eyes. One Warrior took out his newly acquired sword. It blazed with
a bright red fire as he removed it from it’s sheath., then he struck me
a powerful blow. Not knowing the reason for the attack, I grabbed my bow
and notched an arrow. But he did not advance. He smiled at me and said,
"By the Gods!...Do you know what you have found?" The others and myself
looked puzzled, and shrugged. "This is the Plate of the Golden Phoenix,
I thought this only to be legend or myth." "There is a story to this armor,
told to me by my father." The Mage sat down at the fire warming his hands
and staring into the burning embers. "I too have heard this story, but
it does not end happily." "Now that you have made this discovery, it seems
this Tale must be told." And this my friends, is yet another story....
~Chance~ Part III...The Plate of the Golden Phoenix We gathered around
the warmth of the fire and dug out what was left of our dwindling supplies
from the packs we carried to share a meal. Between the four of us, we were
able to scrape together a meager feast which consisted of dried meat, stale
bread, moldy cheese, and the best Elvenberry wine that gold could buy.
The only thing that we seemed to have plenty of, was the wine. We sat around
the burning embers, sharing our meal and getting to know one another. I
couldn’t help but laugh at the antics of the Warriors as they showed off
their tremendous skills in bodily function control. This seemed to be a
favorite past time for the two Warriors, a private ongoing duel that has
not stopped since they met. Then we settled back, relaxing against the
piles of coins and jewels, enjoying the moment and waiting in anticipation
for the Mage to start the Tale of the Golden Phoenix Armor. The Mage, seemingly
in no hurry to start the story, took his time relishing the effects of
the potent wine while his eyes reflected the light of the fire. Then, to
my surprise, a tear formed in his right eye, and ran down the side of his
cheek. I stared at the Mage, looking into the depths of his soul with my
inner eye, only to see the darkness of sorrow welling from within him.
He was deep in thought, contemplating what must be told, but finding it
difficult to put into words what his heart was feeling. His stare became
intense as he concentrated on the dancing flames. The whites of the Mage’s
eyes started absorbing the light of the fire, filling his orb’s with a
burning radiance that startled the warriors and intrigued me, for my abilities
in magic were somewhat different than the Mage’s. His eye’s began to glow
a brilliant orange, then his pupil’s dilated wide open, releasing a strange
gleam of sparkling light that joined with the luminance of the fire. Smoke
emanating from the flames took on a life of it’s own, collecting itself
around us and swirling above our heads like the forming of a new born Galaxy.
The smoke concentrated, circling closer to it’s center, spiraling faster
as it massed over the fire. A crystalline sphere appeared just above the
light of the fire, easily a full arm span in length, capturing the smoke
within it and hovered there as if the heat from the fire held it aloft.
The Warriors and myself were awe struck as we looked into the sphere. Inside
the depths of the crystal, swirled the white smoke, moving around like
a whirlpool in a river, as though it represented the span of time itself.
The crystalline orb began to glow with the light generated by the fire,
and the smoke within it thinned out revealing a scene of a great forest
that stretched out as far as the eye could see. As I watched in wonderment
at the flowing scenery before me, I felt the hands of time lifting my soul
from my body, carrying me into the mystical expanses of the orb. The four
of us became united within the celestial globe, drawn in by the power of
the Mage. I then realized that the Mage never intended on just telling
the story, but instead, take us into the Tale itself, and letting us experience
it for ourselves. High above the tree tops we soared, flying along with
the eagles as they searched for prey among the flora. Gliding on the currents
of the west wind, I could feel the freedom only the great birds of the
sky have experienced. For the first time in many lonely moon’s, my heart
was as light as the wings that carried me. I could also feel the Warriors
silently joined together with me, sharing this type of magical encounter
for the first time in their lives, and taking in all of the newness this
glorious experience had to offer. The voice of the Mage spoke inside of
me as if my inner voice was now his own. "This is the Sea of Tree’s." "Deep
in the Heart of this great forest dwells the Ancient Order of the Elven
Race." "I have brought you back to the time of The Forging." "Where the
Elder Elven Alchemist’s met a century ago to create a new type of Armor."
"It was the hope of the Elven Master’s to use this Mystical Plate as a
tool to bring down The Fowl One we now know as..."Diablo"." The trees passed
beneath us for what seemed to be hours. Hills rolling on forever, giving
the tree’s the appearance of waves flowing across a calm ocean. It is no
wonder that this grand forest received the name, "The Sea of Tree’s." In
the distance, I could make out what looked to be an enormous towering oak,
rising high above the forest, spreading it’s branches deep into the clouds.
I had never been to this realm before, only hearing stories of the Elven
home. What my eye’s beheld now, could never have been put into the mortal
words of man. As we approached the magnificent growth, I could sense the
enormity of the tree by the way it radiated a power of majesty and health,
unmatched anywhere on this world. The magnitude of it’s strength and vitality
overpowered my new found senses. The width of the trunk alone covered a
stretch of ground that a small village would take up, it’s length spanning
far beyond a person’s view if standing at the base. Branches reaching high
into the clouds were large enough to use as roadways, easily enabling the
occupants to travel from one end of the great tree to the other. A single
leaf of this mighty oak could defend a small dwelling from the most thunderous
of storms. My eye’s could not count the number of these colossal leaves
that gave protection to this glorious village in the clouds. We ascended
into the tree, flying past the massive branches and leaves. For the Mage
had a purpose for bringing us here, and that purpose led us to the very
top of the tree. Breaking through the clouds was an unexpected event, I
was not aware that any living tree grew beyond the boundaries of the heavens.
It was only a single branch that thrust it’s way through the clouds, but
even this small twig from the tree was large enough for a spacious room
to be carved into it. There were four windows cut into the sides, facing
the four corners of the realm, and offering the grandest views my eyes
have ever witnessed. I suddenly found myself standing in the room, my companions
at my side. We were bathed in a shimmering luminance, giving us the appearance
of ghosts, wandering the land of the living. .....and there is more.</CENTER>
