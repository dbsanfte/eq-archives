              <p>No real news to report so I've decided to give a shot at
              ranking Loganwolf's</p>
              <p>Eye of Zomm Train in Old Seb the other day.</p>
              <p>My assumptions are pointed out at the various points. I believe
              that there</font> <font SIZE="2">were approximately 30 people on
              the raid (altho this number may have been</font> <font SIZE="2">higher).
              I have also assumed some things along the way. Please feel free</font>
              <font SIZE="2">to correct any mistakes or other inaccuracies. I
              believe that the train was</font> <font SIZE="2">approximately 15
              mobs. Unfortunately, I was trapped with three of them in</font> <font SIZE="2">the
              little niche (having followed directions to cram into the niche).</p>
              <p>The following is my rating:</p>
              <p>Group does not know you are the puller. +15 pts</p>
              <p>Group does not know you are pulling. +10 pts</p>
              <p>Number of mobs? +10 pts per mob above four (this assumes a
              total of 15 mobs)</p>
              <p>+110</p>
              <p>Did any of the mobs summon? +10 pts</p>
              <p>WTH? from witnesses. +5 pts each (assuming 6)</p>
              <p>+30</p>
              <p>***? from witnesses. +10 pts each (assuming 6)</p>
              <p>+60</p>
              <p>OMG! from witnesses. +5 pts each (assuming 6)</p>
              <p>+30</p>
              <p>OMFG! from witnesses. +10 pts each (assuming 6)</p>
              <p>+60</p>
              <p>(note, this spreads the comments around. I know for certain
              that there were</font> <font SIZE="2">a lot of comments, but this
              is just an average)</p>
              <p>Did you force any Clerics to DA? +10 pts each (assuming two)</p>
              <p>+20</p>
              <p>This is where we start racking up the points. It was not so
              much the size</font> <font SIZE="2">of the train, but the
              unexpected nature and the results.</p>
              <p>Confirmed deaths. +20 pts per death (everybody died)</p>
              <p>+600</p>
              <p>I think there were three of this kind of class there:</p>
              <p>Were any deaths from classes that have Feign Death (MNK, SHD,
              NEC)? +20 pts</font> <font SIZE="2">each</p>
              <p>+60</p>
              <p>This next one is probably higher, but I'm trying to be kinda of</font>
              <font SIZE="2">conservative:</p>
              <p>Number of tells from victims rendered incoherent by rage. +25
              pts each</p>
              <p>+75</p>
              <p>At least two quit for the night after this:</p>
              <p>Did any victims/groupmembers quit EQ for the night? +30 pts
              each</font>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><font SIZE="2">+60</p>
              <p>Total group wipeout. +50 pts per group</font>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><font SIZE="2">+250 (assuming 5 groups)</p>
              <p>And, the big one:</p>

              <p>Total: 2085</p>

              <p>Statue of Rallos Zek Spanked:</p>
              <p>You heard that right. We finally managed to take down this
              punk. The fight</font> <font SIZE="2">was Incredibly Long, but
              Aetherium took down the Statue of Rallos Zek on our</font> <font SIZE="2">first
              try. The most amazing victory was over the lag, altho it
              contributed</font> <font SIZE="2">to quite a few deaths. Your
              ranging reporter himself was taken down in an</font> <font SIZE="2">enrage
              that ganked about 10 other Aetherium all in one fell swoop. It was</font>
              <font SIZE="2">truly a massive counterattack by a mob that was
              about to be owned. Congrats</font> <font SIZE="2">to the Shamans
              who slowed him (Jelili and Volumnia), the Clerics who kept</font> <font SIZE="2">Harbo
              (Talthar's Rune (tm)) alive for the majority of the fight (Too
              many to</font> <font SIZE="2">name, including some fine guests),
              and to everyone who managed to die of</font> <font SIZE="2">enrage
              due to terrible, terrible lag (yeah, right, wtg Marechal).</p>
              <p>Statue dropped the BP (Grats Talthar!), Iron Scroll (Fanainy!
              WTG!), and</font> <font SIZE="2">Reaver. (WTG whoever got it, I
              had to port out and log). All of these</font> <font SIZE="2">items
              are very sweet and phat lewt.</p>
              <p>Prior to Statue, of course, we had to kill Derakator the
              Vindicator. Chew</font> <font SIZE="2">on this you oversized
              elderberry wine guzzling silly person! I love killing</font> <font SIZE="2">Vindi.
              Mostly because he has killed me so many times. Vindi dropped BP</font>

              Japeth). The Vindi</font> <font SIZE="2">pre-kill (i.e., my new

              period.</font> <font SIZE="2">Kudos to all of you who kept their

              <p>This weekend was an interesting one. For one thing, most of the
              guild was</font> <font SIZE="2">in the Plane of Air. Thanks to our
              friends over at the Alliance, Malcress</font> <font SIZE="2">and
              his crew (read: lots of plat) were able to secure a spot on the
              Seventh</font> <font SIZE="2">Island. It was time to farm for Mage
              crowns. Lots of DT's later, Aetherium</font> <font SIZE="2">was
              able to secure three crowns and within minutes, we had our FIRST
              MAGE</font> <font SIZE="2">EPIC!!! Congrats to Malcress.</p>
              <p>(I didn't tell him that it looked just like this little

              is almost dead. Statue of Rallos Zek</font> <font SIZE="2">is at about 50 percent.
              So, we continue to make progress. And, with a new</font> <font SIZE="2">high

              but we have managed to</font> <font SIZE="2">find some real

              The only reason that this reporter failed to take serious notice

              there was no ninja-looting,</font> <font SIZE="2">suspensions or

              So after a bumpy hour or two or constant Velketor trains and much
              death, the guild assembled and pressed onward to Velketor's lair.&nbsp;
              Through the labyrinth we travelled, up, down, around, and found
              Lord Bob.&nbsp; So we killed him, and he gave Kazy a new ring and
              Sinan new boots.

            <div>
              Onwards, we found Velketor.&nbsp; So we pulled him and died.&nbsp;
              And died again, but got him to 20%.&nbsp; Then we died.&nbsp; And
              again (now at 98% or so).&nbsp; And yet again (50%)!&nbsp; And
              then miraculously, we killed him.&nbsp; Our first big Velious mob,
              dead, but dead he was!&nbsp; Two tries worth, half his HP on each
              attempt.&nbsp; Good work Healers, tanks, wizards, and everyone who
              was there on a job well done.

              &nbsp; So, we gather in Burning Woods, all set to kill Ixiblat.&nbsp;
              We go to spawn Ixiblat when... a gorilla kills her! Doh!

            </div>
            <div>
              &nbsp; Ok, so anyway, we zone into chardok.&nbsp; We find Queen
              uncamped, but King is, so we move in anyway.&nbsp; Kill the
              biggest train in history (think 3/4s of the palace at ONE TIME,
              from god knows where) with no deaths!&nbsp; Of course, we had
              several deaths on 2-pulls, but none on the 27-pull, go figure.
            </div>
            <div>

            </div>
            <div>
              &nbsp; So, we assemble for Queen.&nbsp; But first, a new blue BP
              for Traxan drops called...something!&nbsp; So he looks good now,
              Grats Traxan.&nbsp; We engage with a relatively new strat from the
              playbook ... mass offensive discs 3 seconds into the fight.&nbsp;
              Ten seconds later, we loot her corpse.&nbsp; No one died.&nbsp; It
              was really rather pathetic!&nbsp; Thanks to the group of LC who
              stuck behind to help out (and make her die that much faster).&nbsp;
              The help's appreciated =)

            <div>
              &nbsp; So now, we decide to go kill Ixiblat.&nbsp; We pop him.&nbsp;
              Oops! Now there's 2 up!!&nbsp; So, we pull 2, in an attempt to
              kill both at once.&nbsp; We were doing ok, until some clerics
              died.&nbsp; Got one to 5% and the other to 95%, then died.&nbsp;
              DOH!&nbsp; We rezzed, and pulled 3 Ixiblats (Ssapriina, Traxan,
              and Clerigy (guest), congrats) and ganked them all in a 12 minute
              span.&nbsp; Poor elemental used to be so big...

              <p>&nbsp; We first convene in Timorous Deep, where we decide that

              then spends the rest of his night doing various things, and

              &nbsp; Then we move into Vennril Sathir's home, Karnors Castle,
              and sure enough, Vennril is up <em>again</em>.&nbsp; So, of
              course, with only one enchanter, we nail him.&nbsp; And nail him
              hard we did!&nbsp; Grats to Temira on Cobalt Leggings, and Riscaan

              &nbsp; Now the fun part.&nbsp; We decide to return to our old
              stomping grounds, Tormax' lair (minus Tormax).&nbsp; We killed
              Dlammaz, all the sentinels, Yetarr+2, Kyenka+3 (Four mob pull.&nbsp;
              Screw splitting the impossible split, now we just kill them.&nbsp;
              Did I mention we did FOUR MOBS with only the tasher dead? Mwa ha
              ha!).&nbsp; Grats Romey on Dragon Pauldrons.

            <div>
              &nbsp; Then we play with Tormax' guards, both way easier than we
              remembered them.&nbsp; Dropped nothing, moving right along, we
              pull the Orb of Infinite Void, congratulations to Loganwolf on
              that wicked shield.&nbsp; Then, because everything else is dead,
              we pull Frozen Jesus.&nbsp; Man, he hits hard (flurries for 600s)
              but... who cares?&nbsp; With 10 hit points, it doesnt matter HOW
              hard you hit!&nbsp; Tormax' lair was owned.&nbsp; Congratulations
              to Aadorna on a cloth robe, and a few other various pieces of

            <p>&nbsp; With a stunning, record smashing 37 aetherium in the same
            zone (by the second pull, anyway), we marched through Velketor's
            labyrinth to Lord Bob.&nbsp; He dropped a new&nbsp;(no-graphic) hat
            for Vage, and a new axe for Romey.

            &nbsp; Vowing revenge, we pulled him for real.&nbsp; Got him to
            about 42% health.&nbsp; NP, we rez, we buff, and we pull again,
            starting at about 97% HP.&nbsp; Get him to somewhere in the vicinity
            of 42% health again.&nbsp; Going to try once more, but our weary
            ears heard something different.&nbsp; Vennril's up!&nbsp; So we rush
            to Karnors, buff 2 people, haste everyone, and kill him.&nbsp; Hard
            to believe that he beat us before (of course it helps that 30 of 37
            guildmates all came to Karnor, can you say SPLAT!).&nbsp; Grats to

            forces forth.&nbsp; We pull phinny's guards, kill phinny, help out
            some random bard (grats!) with his backbone, and leave.&nbsp;

          the duel while Vage was afk (hehe, just kidding, but it is kinda an on-going fantasy....beat Vage in a duel, yeah right, WAKE UP!). In
