<h1>Welcome to <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Action=Journal&Jid=3768&Id=20190">Neferti's</a> everquest raid page.</h1>

Hello and welcome to my everquest raid info page, I am the Enchantress Neferti and hail from the fair city of Qeynos on the content Antonica in the world of Norrath. I hail from the world of Tallon Zek, a place inhabited by several races at war with eachother struggling to survive.

<center><img src="http://www.geocities.com/neferaza/nefsig2.jpg"></center>

Let me get right to the point with this guide and tell you what to do and what not to do on raids in the everquest multiverse. I hereby thank all the posters of the information on the various zones they posted on message boards like the <a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">safehouse</a>, <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove">druids grove</a> and <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/">casters realm</a>. The raid rules were mostly inspired by tips from many friends and I compiled the list of those.

One important rule in raids is be prepared that is why it is important to have maps, the best maps I found came from <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com">EQAtlas</a> but they dont have all the zones mapped so I did some searching. I have put the best ones I found on this page I dont think there are many better maps then these.

<h2>Planning your raid</h2>
<i>By Neferti - Tallon Zek</i>
<p>
This section should be straightforward.
<ul>
<li>Make requirements for the raid, for example in resist gear 100 unbuffed MR/CR for a Vox raid. Also make level requirements between 47 and 52 for a Vox raid for example, with some exceptions due to being short on those classes.
<li>Maybe people should pay beforehand for the expenses made, like coffins (necro), peridots (enc and cleric) and pearls (summon) or maybe the loot in the raid is divided so that money loot goes to the people who make the expenses.
<li>Make sure everyone is on time and you are not missing key classes (enough clerics and enchanters, enough melees). Do not take too much people with you if you have enough of one class just say no. Strive for class balance, zergling rushes dont work in general.
<li>Make sure loot rules are clear beforehand, do some research on what can drop and who can use it, but even more who -will- use it. In some guild only raids you can let officers decide on loot and let the people who are granted give their old equipment down to the ranks. This makes the guild as a whole stronger but might not seem fair, it is the way most uber guilds distribute loot (give their main tank all the best AC and HP drops so the entire raid force gets better). Most people especially on multi guild and pickup raids like rolling for items though.
<li>If rolling on stuff, let people give you a tell if they are interested. Then the raid leader says the names with a number in front of it, and rolls once. For example the raid leader says 1 - Neferti 2 - Galad 3 - Thunders then he rolls a 1 that means Neferti wins (woohoo). Cuts down on late and missed rolls and a lot of frustration, also cuts out on people who dont need the item.
<li>Do not under any circumstance change your loot rules mid raid unless there is something really really wrong and the entire raid agrees with the change (/shout send a tell to me if you do not agree with blah blah). Make sure your loot rules are clear and you can justify them beforehand (if need be). If you do change your policy mid raid people will get unhappy and leave your raid even if they dont care about the loot they might care about 'unfairness'.
<li>Research the zone and the mob you are killing very well, you want to know every weakness and ability, every corner of the zone so people can ask you questions.
<li>Be patient when making groups and getting people ports this is a nasty part of being raid leader.
<li>I can not stress this enough - tell people to be on time! The raid should have been announced on a guild messageboard, the guild motd and in guildspeak so they have plenty of chances to be reminded when it is.
<li>Have a -good- CR plan, if you have a CR it will be the time when people are getting irritated and if people are leaving the CR becomes harder. You dont want to have any xp res timers expire. Have rogues ready, CoH mages, corpse summoners with enough coffins, people with extra weapons in the bank, extra hate stones whatever. As long as you have a good plan.
<li>Make sure you dont get too much spam in the raid from others, its best to use guildchat for all communications. If multiple guilds join in you might have to use public channels, politely ask other people to stay out of those. Sometimes more raids go on in the same zone, in that case make sure every raid uses one of the three public channels (shout, ooc and auction) and turns off the two others. Of course on a PvP server like Tallon, a battle might have to be fought for control of the zone (refer to <a href="http://www.geocities.com/neferaza/pvp101.html">PvP 101</a> and <a href="http://www.geocities.com/neferaza/pvp102.html">PvP 102</a>).
</ul>

<h2>Raid Tactics</h2>
<i>By Neferti - Tallon Zek</i>
<p>
If everyone reads this and uses it as a guide it will prevent a lot of frustration on raids. If you cooperate well even small guilds can do difficult things succesfully. We are certainly not an uber guild, but I have stood in awe at all we and our allies accomplished so far by just working together well.
<br>
<ul>

<li> Raids are announced on the events board and on the guild motd. People want to do other things too once in a while so they might not be available always if you dont announce the raid beforehand. Dont be mad at them for not coming, yet appreciate it if they do come.

<li> Buy your components beforehand and take your resist gear from the bank beforehand.

<li> Make sure you are on time, if you are too late you are wasting the time of all the others. Stragglers will be picked up with CoH.

<li> Have your settings the right way (particle effects off, 3d sky off, data rate and serverside filtering to prevent LD and so on. In some cases like the main tanks and clerics however silverside filtering should be off so clerics healing wont be too late because of lag.

<li> Put all or most of your 'battle spam' options off if possible, like others hits, your misses, peoples spellcasting and so on. You need to see the orders you have to follow, seeing what everyone hits for is useless if you fail the fight because you couldnt read your orders (like 'Back off' if a mob gets pushed off a cliff) as those got lost in all the spam.

<li> Prepare all your hotkeys beforehand (for most people this should be an /assist main_assist_name key, some have to make extra ones for example I have had '/assist venril sathir' and '/assist maestro of rancor' buttons to rune the current aggroed tanks). You can best accomplish this though clicking on the mob (f8) then assisting it to see who is highest on the aggro list, then rune or heal that person.

<li> Dont mess around when gathering for a raid (pking eachother) come to a druid/wizard ring as soon as you can and gather in a remote place (depending on the raid but NOT gfay, Karnors or FV or so) and be patient.

<li> When you arrive in a port in group, the leader of that group gathers all the classes and names of the people in his or her group so new groups can be made fast.

<li> The group leader is responsible for buffing not the raid leader, also makes sure the group buffs itself with 4 or 5 crap buffs, each group gathers in a different spot so it can be easily seen where each group is - responsibility of the group leader.

<li> Do not ask questions to the raid leader, ask them to your group or in /say, the group leaders should be well informed. Dont hesitate to ask questions either if you think they are important (but dont do it in tells to the raid leader) or if it is your first raid.

<li> Listen to every word your raid leader shouts (or sometimes OOC) (leader uses shout, noone else except the slowers etc do so) and do as you are told as quick as you can (especially when moving). Do not bug the raid leader with tells. Try not to go AFK in nasty places, only in the designated rest spots.

<li> Groups consist of 5 people, sixth spot will be used to do group buffs or invite the haste/clar buffer (MR, heroic bond, (group) clarity(2), haste, resist).

<li> Dont ask for unnecessary buffs like wis/int/mana.

<li> Dont go playing around during buffing, just be patient.

<li> Death pact on the main enchanter, main tank and main cleric.

<li> Mention weaknesses of the mob -> melee range casting, slowability, immunities to fire/cold, complete healing, so people can prepare and mem the right spells.

<li> ALWAYS use assist, if the main tank calls for a switch DO SO as fast as you can. Someone should root the former target. Sometimes it is good to have several extra tanks designated beforehand to holding off unmezzable adds with root/slow/heal tank. Not attacking can save more people then attacking the wrong mob.

<li> Only the main tank should ever be aggroed, every secondary healer (one that is not chain casting group heals) should if their group is okay target the main tank and (chain)heal (try not to get aggro on one healer - thats why multiple healers work best) him or her.

<li> Only the main tank (main assist or MA) ever breaks a mez, noone else does, if a mob does not need to be dispelled it is preferable to prepare it first (see next point) before breaking mez. The main assist will announce very clearly what the main target is, and everyone should use assist on the main tank (make a button that says /assist name_of_MA) to target the mob. The main assist could check if he taunted the mob off the enchanters or other debuffers by /assisting the mob and seeing if he targets himself.

<li> Root and stun mobs that are not mezzed, try to slow them if possible and put a tank in front of it... but do NO damage to it. Do not use grasping roots but the non damaging wizard, enchanter, shaman, cheric, paladin or necromancer versions of the spell, like 'root', 'enstill' and so on. Do not use sound of force but stun, do not hit the mob but only taunt.

<li> Do not use dots EVER (in dungeons). Often mobs can not be mezzed easily and people need to switch targets mid fight, when you use a dot this means the enchanter dies which often means the raid fails.

<li> Only mages (and necros) should have pets (except on dragon runs where even enc pets are nice) let your pet attack when the mob is at 75% health through /assist the main tank. Be aware of buggy pathing (in hate at the safe spot for example) and place your pet accordingly. If a mob has an AE fire breath mages make *fire* pets and no others no matter how crappy your fire pet is, he is immune to the breath and that is what matters.

<li> Do not push mobs on to walls, into water or off ledges, pull back if you see that is going to happen. Mind pets here too. Fighting things in water is not a good thing, neither is pushing Vox on a wall so the melees cant hit her. Mobs that poof and port when pushed in a wall, then summon people from the other end of the dungeon and kill them one by one is even worse. If you see a mob nearing a wall, water, a chasm then everyone should stand between the mob and that obstacle so the mob gets knocked away from it. If that is not possible everyone should disengage and pull back, if the mob summons this is a little harder but still works because it only summons each 12 seconds.

<li> Only wizards (and mages) will nuke and only if the mob is at low health or enraged. If you can heal, you save your mana for heals and do not nuke.

<li> Use your special abilities like lay on hands to save clerics or enchanters in pressing situations or maybe the main tank. You have that ability for a reason, now is the time to use it. By saving the cleric or chanter or main tank you might save the entire raid. Make good intelligent use of your disciplines, you have them for a reason.

<li> Do not sit when people have an incoming pull, the mob will aggro on you. Stand up as soon as people say inc %t. Sometimes a melee group can pull a mob onto them by sitting, so the caster groups can stand in the back.

<li> Do not wander away from the group, stick together or you may aggro additional mobs. Raids are not a time for exploring zones, do that on your own.

<li> Do not ask for pulls of specific mobs or loot. Do not expect loot, you might get something nice but probably not. Be glad someone got something, people will remember that you helped them out, and will return that favor in kind.

<li> When you get aggroed invis drops or whatever, die away from the raid force, you can be dragged or summoned and ressed, a new break in because of total wipe out is not fun.

<li> Have a second set of armor and weapons in the bank (melees) for possible CR. Also have enough port stones/coffins for a possible CR.

<li> Have a solid CR plan before the raid starts. Maybe camp out a mage for CoH, or a cleric and rogue for CR to a safe spot.

<li> Make sure that the looting rules are clear beforehand, noone rolls prematurely on something until the raid leader has made a decision.

<li> And of course everyone makes a mistake once in a while, just admit those and learn from them, dont get mad at eachother.

<li> Always thank everyone for coming, people spend a lot of time on the raid, and might not have gotten anything in return (no xp, no loot etc) so they might really appreciate a "thank you"  

<li> Good communication is critical in a raid, let your group know what you are doing. Let people know if there are adds etc. And do what must be done (like rooting a mob beating on an enc so they can move away). Some uber guilds use 'roger wilco' (some speech over internet program) to improve comms but that isnt really needed. And I stress again, put all your battle spam off so you dnot miss orders.
</ul>

<h3>Advanced raid tactics</h3>
<i>By Neferti - Tallon Zek</i>
<ul>
<li> Damage on raids on single target ubermobs in eq comes from the tanks, the main groups should consist of 3 (or 4) tanks, one cleric and one other healer. Clerics will use group heals to counter the AE weapon from the mob, other healer (preferably also a cleric) will heal from melee damage and assist healing on the main tank or people that /y yell. Paladins will use their level 55 group heal as often as they can. Most of the time at least 2 clerics or 1 cleric and a paladin in each group are necessary for group heals only to counter the AE damage.

<li> Some fights require two or 3 clerics to stagger casts of Complete Heal 5 or 3 seconds apart from eachother on the main tank, with additional people healing in the meanwhile. All healers have an assist key ready and can select the MA quickly by clicking on the mob then /assisting off it, this will select the person who is highest on the aggro list. Make sure your complete heal spells and other healing spells are mapped to the guild or shout/ooc, this will prevent two clerics from healing at the same time. Mana management is very important in difficult fights.

<li> In some very hard fights the only way to kill the mob is if it is continually on a warrior with the level 55 discipline defensive activated. Defensive only lasts 3 minutes so multiple 55+ warriors are needed who will take turns tanking. In these fights aggro is often proximity based (if it is not and the mob is rootable you can make it proximity based by using fetter) map your defensive key to the guild or shout channel as well as a key for when it wears off. If one warriors defensive wears off, he or she backs away from the mob. The next warrior in line will move closer and taunt, all heals will then be mapped to this next tank. If you still have to heal the first tank because he is still aggroed while defensive wore off, you will use twice the mana which means you run out of mana halfway through the fight. If that happens you can also overaggro clerics because they have to heal twice as much. Not healing the warrior and then resurrecting him or her with a cleric epic weapon might be a better idea in some of those cases (you have to use manaless items like Donals armour of mourning and shissar to rebuff them).

<li> It is a good tactic to interrupt very high level mobs casting by having all tanks (except rogues) on one side and bash or such, so they push the mob to the same direction. This often interrupts cheals from dragons and such. In addition you might want to mana sieve as well as cast torment of argli on the mob to prevent it from regaining the mana you drain too much. This will prevent gates and cheals if done right.

<li> Mobs should be hit a few times by recant magic, then tashanian, malo/mala, occlusion of sound (55 bard) then malosini, then slow and other debuffs. The bard who sings Occlusion uses a percussion instrument like drums of the beast, a mistmoore drum or his epic, otherwise the song will not work. All mobs should also be snared, sundered and maybe rooted (just before breaking mez). Shout %t has been pillaged, tashed, malosied, slowed, snared if it sticks (make a hot key for this).

<li> If a mob flurries or rampages (like the boss mobs in the new hate) do not forget to cripple it, these skills are based on the AGI of the mob and cripple decreases that by 65.

<li>Some fights are done with 'waves', for example in a Trakanon raid you send in one person to trigger the first AE, then the tank groups will run in. Just after an AE send in the rest of the groups, for example casters to finish off the mob. This way you avoid having the entire raid force subject to the AE weapon of the mob.

<li>Make sure you know how the aggro rules work. In Velious for example mobs will kill people below a certain amount of health (roughly below 2 bubs) regardless of who is highest on the hate list. What this means is for example if you are fighting a dragon their AE will wear you down, if people (for example casters) have low health from this the dragon will switch and melee them to death instead of the MA. It might be hard to regain the correct aggro then.
</ul>

<p>
If you do all this well and work together smoothly you can kill mobs with less and less people, which is also more fun to the raid leader because you spend more time on the actual fight and less on the gathering and buffing (and not as much people will go linkdead). The most fun I had is with raids with 4 groups or less like <a href="http://www.geocities.com/neferaza/lotsacolors.jpg">this</a>.

<h2>Raid Rules</h2> <i>By Vanayr, Darxil, Zaelin and Ignoble - Tallon Zek</i><p>

Note: This section might sound a bit harsh but it might come in handy with pickup raids and multi-guild raids. Probably it isnt needed in guild only raids, but it can still be an interesting read. I left it mostly unedited from the original. Fyi it was written by players from team dark.<p>

<b>1 - STFU</b>
<p>
No one cares what you have to say. I don't want to hear you /shout "all your loot are belong to me", because I will call lights to kill you, and I’ll pay them to do it.
<p>
No one cares what you have to say at this point. you need to keep your yap shut.
<p>
This includes, but is not limited to your uber bullshit speak about how you will "own" this raid, your auction of some bullshit item that no one at this level would dare equip, much less be seen still carrying, or your damn inability to stop using the /shout channel to talk smack to some idiot who wants to babble as much as you do.
<p>
<b>2 - Speak when you are spoken to</b>
<p>
We have been calling raid information for 20 minuets, groups are all formed, buffs are starting to be issued, and you now have no group.
<p>
If you would have shut up to begin with, you would have seen your group assignment. If you had kept your trap shut and read, you would know what chat room to log to. If you would have crammed a sock in the hole you spew garbage out of, you would know what you are supposed to do.
<p>
How many times does the raid leader have to ask you not to use /shout? When are you going to STFU and listen? 
<p>
Never?
<p>
Bad dog, we don’t like that. No CoF for you.
<p>
You do as you are told on a raid. That is why you are there. You are not leading the raid, you are there to do what you are told by the raid leaders. If you are told to send a tell to RaidLeader01, you send him a tell with the information he has asked for. You do this promptly, and you don't spam him with useless blabber. We don't care about any information right now except what we have asked for, and emergencies that pop up.
<p>
Some people have to be told the same things over and over again at every raid and continue to do the same stupid things every time after being told not too.
<p>
Too stupid to listen? STFU. Go away now. You are not needed here.
<p>
<b>3 - Your opinion on loot rules and random roles</b>
<p>
We don't care what it is. We don't care weather or not you like it. We don't care how much you whine.
<p>
Leave now, go away. You are not needed here.
<p>
You are a (insert class here) and an item dropped you can use? Great. I don't want to hear it. Remember the rule about STFU? It's still in force. Remember where I asked what class and level you are to form the groups? Guess what this means?
<p>
I already know you are here. I know who can use what item. Stop spamming me with tells. I don’t care what you have to say about what you can use.
<p>
No, you won't random. I will do that for you, and I'll let you know who won. Don't like it? Leave, you are not needed anymore. Don't know your way back out of the zone? Not my problem, you should not have been yapping your mouth like an ass.
<p>
<b>4 - Ninja POS</b>
<p>
Ok great ninja looter, guess what? GM's can tell us who looted that mith mask. All your group members get a message when you loot an item. Everyone around you has already done a /guildstatus to see what guild you are in if you don't have a tag up.
<p>
Import of this? We know who you are. We know who leads your guild. We will INSURE you are miserable and have to recreate a new character if you ninja loot an item.
<p>
<b>5 - The things you do</b>
<p>
Everything you do represents not only you, but your guild. If you are a total fuckin moron, we will think the same of your guild. If you can't listen, we will think the same about your guild. If you ninja items, we will let your guild know, then think the rest of them are a POS.
<p>
And if you are a buffer and you don't know what the hell you are doing, let the raid leader know and he will assign someone to let you know what to do.
<p>
Is this your first raid?
<p>
Then you don't know what the hell you are doing, so ask.
Don't just stand there and look retarded when someone is saying "BUFF ME YOU STUPID FUK!" because their buffs are wearing off since it took you 45 minutes to ask everyone else in your party what you are supposed to do and you still dont get it.
<p>
If you don't know what you are doing, be honest enough to admit it and someone else will do your job. This is the way we end up with Cleric buffs at the top fighting a mob that AE dispells
<p>
Know what? You will NOT be disrespected if you admit you are confused by the whole sceen. Those that have been on a number of runs remember that their first one was a blur. Have the balls to admit that you are having a tough time, and you will be both looked after and taken care of.
<p>
Don't like it? STFU. Go away. You are not needed here.
<p>
<b>6 - PAY ATTENTION</b>
<p>
Don't sit there AFK for 45 damn minutes and then bitch that you are clueless. Go away now, you are useless.
<p>
Don't log your damn 4th account on, and be clueless about what is happening. This is all your fault if you die and get me dead as well.
<p>
Logging in a buffer account? Great, thanks. The faster we buff, the faster we get cool shit. Loggin in your uber twink for that trade in GFay real fast? Get outa the damn zone please, you are gonna get me dead. You obviously have no clue. Therefore don't make me rely on you now, while you try to regain brains you never had to perform your function in the first place.
<p>
Loggin in a twink Enchanter for the raid? You need to leave. Right now, just go away. I count on you to mez and tash, not cast a damn haste spell that any Shami can backfill in the zone.
<p>
Loggin in that twink Cleric? LET ME KNOW you are a dual play char and you are not coming. I rely on healers to keep us alive, not you to be siting there doing nothing, and me left to try to figure out why I am dead now after endless /ooc of HEAL ME I AM ABOUT TO DROP HERE!
<p>
(Notice I did not say /shout? Remember what this is for? You don't? Leave, you are useless.)
<p>
<b>7 - My time and your time</b>
<p>
My time is valuable, do you have respect for that? No? Leave, you are useless. Have the decency to respect the time and effort that is required to plan and execute a large scale rade.
<p>
Don't start in /ooc 10 minutes into getting the raid organized you are bored. It takes some god damn time to get everyone in the proper group with the proper buffs. 
<p>
If you don't have a fucking half hour to spend sitting around waiting for everything to get organized get your ass back to OT and continue soloing.
<p>
Another thing for you. Raids are designed to do things as a group, not to cater to your own version of how life should be in EQ. Guess what? If you complain that there isn't any decent loot or good exp in what we are doing, your ass won't be invited back for the next event which may involve getting the loot you need.
<p>
Have a bad attitude? See that cool screenshot of the A_Uber_Weapon_01 you want? Print a copy and tack it to your forehead cause that is as close you are gonna get to seein it in.
<p>
<b>8 - Your opinions after the raid</b>
<p>
This is when your raid leaders turn back into regular human beings. This is when you send them a tell and let them know any comments you have. This is when you get a response to your concerns. This is when we have common courtesy and hear you out.
<p>
Do it during the raid? STFU. Leave. You are not needed here.
<p>
<b>-Recap-</b>
<ul>
<li>Keep your mouth shut
<li>Do as you are told
<li>Don't use /shout, your raid leaders use this
<li>Listen closely
<li>Don't use /shout, your raid leaders use this
<li>Don't train and get us all killed
<li>Pay attention to /shout, your raid leaders use this
<li>Don't be a peice of shit ninja looter
<li>Don't whine in OOC that you don't understand the loot rules
<li>Don't use /shout, your raid leaders use this
<li>Don't be an idiot and use SolB, PoF, PoH or PoG as your auction spot.
<li>Don't go AFK for any extended period of time. If you are AFK, let someone know.
<li>Have patience and respect for people who are working hard for you
</ul>

<h2>Howling Stones or Chararsis</h2>
<i>By Neferti - Tallon Zek</i><p>
This map (author unknown) shows almost all spawns, generally this dungeon is fun, not much gating summoners. The goo, golems, ghosts and the feasters run and should be snared, others are all skellies and dont run. The basement mobs are not shown on the map but it crawls of mobs there, it is the area where you fall in if you step on a trap.
<br><br>

Refer to this <a href="http://www.geocities.com/neferaza/Howlmap.gif">Map</a> for spawn points.
<p>
The red squares with a cross through it are pitfalls, DONT step on those carpets ;)        East wing is hardest and you have to go through the south wing to get there because the east stairs are trapped, Drusella Sathir (necklace of superiority) the wife of VS dwells there (she can be killed with a single group if everything goes well - is quite hard tho so best bring 2 groups) and west or north wing I think is easiest. South wing is very good for items (haste belt drops there, bloodpoint and other things like hand of the reaper and you can camp a spot near the beginning in a tunnel to get both spawns).
<p>

I think this dungeon is one of the best high level ones for xping. It can be hard but its real fun and most mobs dont run and gate like in Chardok. It is however not an easy dungeon, there is no zone out you can run to easily, also the zone in is not safe, you might take 2 harm touches and a severe beating even before you have control of your char. You must also be aware that people die QUICK due to multiple HT so always let a big tank pull and hope he or she gets singles. Scout a bit with a rogue and if you see 4+ mobs with HT send in a paladin or the cleric with DA and let the enchanter mez. A level 57+ puller brings mostly singles and can make this dungeon almost cake. Mobs pathing is strange also, so make sure you dont train yourself and watch out your pet wont run when charming. If you dont have a rogue you can only do the north wing, kill a few entrance mobs until you get a tallow-marked candle (from a bottomless feaster I think) this opens the north wing, most other keys drop off the bosses in the wings. However these are rare spawns. All the keys are norent so you have to duel someone and leave them on your corpse at the zonein so you dont need to camp them again next time. Rumors abound of a fabled master key quest but noone found it. Its best to just always bring a rogue, very nice for damage and scouting also.
<p>
Rogues are excellent with CR which could be very painful otherwise, most things dont see hide - and the odd ooze that does, can be sneaked past. If the corpses are past the paintings, let the rogue pull them to the bottom of the painting, then fall in the carpet trap for that level, take the porter to zonein and then walk in and drag them further. CR in the east wing can be very slow because you have to move through the south wing (not sure if you can drag over the east stairs).
<p>
My group recommendation for xping would be 57+ warr, 54+ (c2) enchanter, 200 lockpicking rogue, 49+ cleric, druid (snare, evac) or wiz, shaman (or extra slowing enc) or anyone else (last spot doesnt that matter too much). Note that HS recently got an upgrade which added an AE to the golems and a lifetap proc to the ghosts, this makes the dungeon considerably harder.

<p>

<a href="http://www.geocities.com/neferaza/chardoktrain.jpg">Chardok</a>, Sarnaks and fire (taken when we got trained in the royals area by an enemy guild and survived an unslaught of about 16 of these half dragons).<br><br>

Check the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/gotech_/chardoktop.jpg">maps of Chardok regular area</a> and <a href="http://www.geocities.com/neferaza/chardok3.jpg"> back caves</a> and the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/gotech_/chardokroyal.gif">Royals area</a>
<p>

This is the basic sequence to do a royals raid. The following is a brief description of the waypoints (refer to the above maps).
<br><br>

1 - Alcove before the first bridge<br>
2 - Alcove just after the first bridge<br>
3 - Bottom of the passage before the second bridge<br>
4A- Staging point for Korocust<br>
4B- Staging point for pulling the outer guards<br>
5 - Staging point for pulling the courtyard guards<br>
6 - Staging point for the invis run to 7<br>
7 - "Safe Passage" you can camp and/or hang out here safely<br>
8 - King/Queen guard pull spot<br>

<br><br>

The key to making a chardok raid a success is to KEEP MOVING. If you choose to do Korocust, move from 3->4A, otherwise go directly to 4B. Korocust is essentially a 30 minute delay or so since you will have to fight bridge respawn. In my opinion, Koro is usually not worth it. If you have a high enough level/small enough force, you can use AE tactics effectively in chardok to speed things up. I would recommend 30 at an absolute max (24 better) for AE tactics. If you can't use AE, you will need to mez big pulls in order to keep pace.
<br><br>

Pulling the king and queen guards can be quite challenging, especially since you have such a small window to fight in. There really isn't any good way to do it, there are just different bad ways. You can charge in and mez all the guards. Or you can pull the guards and then pull or charge the mob. You can even pull the mobs and leave the guards up. Whichever works best for you, however, they all have their own pitfalls and problems. We usually pull the king guards, charge the king, then pull the queen to the king's room solo (not THE way, just A way).
<br><br>
Korocust - Level 59-60 or so, blinds, can be debuffed and nuked. Real easy. Can enrage near the end of the fight, so save your nukes.
<br>
(common) worn crescent axe
(rare) jade inlaid crescent axe
(rare) incarnadine greaves
<br><br>

Prince - Level 58-59, blinds, gfluxes, casts some other spells, can be debuffed and nuked. Pretty easy.
<br>
(always) head of a prince
(common) paladium axe
(rare) jagged longsword of mourning
(rare) incarnadine boots
<br><br>

Sarnak Royal Herbalist-Level 45-48 - This guy has a PHer called the royal herbalist apprentice. He spawns maybe 1/3 to 1/5 or so, and he drops the herb maybe 1/3 or so. He is real easy, but he casts a druid damage shield. So be aware if he is up all of the sarnaks in his area will have a nasty damage shield. 
<br>
(uncommon) herb
<br><br>

Overking Bathezid - Level 65, very resistant to magic and nukes. After Malo/tashan you can land debuffs on him and stun him. Lures land well, other spells can land but not reliably. He complete heals, gfluxes, gates, and has an unresistable fire aoe thats pretty minor. If you fight him in his room make sure that you don't get gfluxed through the hole as this will aggro the herbalist area (so either clear it or don't fight under the hole). If you pull him, make sure he doesn't gate.
<br>

(always) note
(common) argent defender
(rare) incarnadine breastplate
(rare) vibrating gauntlets of infuse
<br><br>

Queen Velazul Di'zok - Level 62 or so. She doesn't have many hit points (around 18k or so) and has very low resistances. She has the same AE that Rak'ashiir does, which is a fire based bard song that does around 800 a tick or so. Her Fire aoe is either a bard song or a proc, so runing people might prevent this. Most people use fire pets or a runed warrior using 55 disc while the others go full offensive. She can gate, so if you pull her make sure to nuke her dead before she finishes. It's very difficult to pull her guards, but pretty easy to pull her solo to the king room. Pulling with lull song might be easier then splitting with monks. Besides mage fire pets, charmed guards are also immune to her fire AE so you might leave some up.
<br>

(common) shard of darkness
(uncommon) an ancient sword blade
(rare) insignia protector 
(rare) incarnadine helm
<br><p>

Golden rules for chardok:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Have a SOLID CR plan... this means camping necros/clerics/staves out, making sure a rogue gets out or can get back easy
<li>Don't push mobs through walls, don't push mobs through pits, don't let mobs gate, make sure you don't have any runners.
<li>When you go from the library into the herbalist room NO PETS! You can recast pets for the actual king fight. However, having pets in the herbalist room - they can get aggro from the kings aoe if you are pulling the king guards up the ramp. Additionally, they can path and fall in the pit (guess what happens next).
<li>You should debuff AND snare every single mob you fight. Some of the mobs get that funky level 61 spell INDOOR SOW. So, if you don't either dispel this or snare them when they get to 5% life they shoot out of wherever like a gnome out of a potato gun.
</ul>
<p>

<br>
Anyways chardok is a very fun zone too but the spawns come fast (its a nice idea to clear to the royals using AE tactics - the mobs do it too tho so watch out) and you get easily swarmed, there is also wandering runners that can summon which can get REAL nasty! Never ever ever let something gate there!! Note that this dungeon got an upgrade, there are less wandering gaters that summon you to the back of the dungeon and several loot upgrades. If you are non kos you might get some fun surprises too.
<br><p>

<h2>Dragon Necropolis</h2>
<i>By Neferti - Tallon Zek</i><p>
<h3>Getting there</h3>
Make sure you have a good group first. Rapture is required for the harder chetari areas so get a 59 or 60 enchanter. At least have a cleric, enchanter and rogue in your group, a high level warrior or SK to taunt helps and a rogue to do the damage is almost required to keep up with respawns deeper in, disarm traps and do CR. Bards can disarm traps well too, assist with mezzing and pull with lull. Wizards or druids are nice for nuking gaters down and evaccing to the zone in and getting you across SG.
<p>
Getting to this zone will take a while, to get through SG either use in zone evacs, fight your way through or use invis after killing the seahorses (they see invis) and swim up the waterfall (takes some practise). Do not stop if anyone dies on the way through WW, make sure everyone is invis. An AE on you from a wandering dragon will drop everyones invis so make sure you travel in small groups and track KOS dragons that can see invis. The zone in is two way and safe on the DN side, so make a small CR group inside DN if anyone died on the way there and zone out to get the corpse.
<p>
<h3>Traps</h3>
Traps are one thing that makes this zone interesting, the only way to do CR here is with a rogue or a necro. Traps move and some places have multiple traps next to eachother. Traps can be dispell, damage (your eardrums explode), 10 level 50ish beetles (use either AE mez or AE stuns and point blank AE nukes - wizards or mages come in handy there). Stepping on bones can trigger a dragon construct, these see invis and are very nasty when CRing, good xp though and they drop scrolls which can be turned in at Kael for rewards. Make sure to fight these at their spawn point because if you pull them and they are low health they speed off with about 5 times sow speed to their bind point to regen. Anyways make sure your rogues and bards scan for traps continually, some things like the beetle and Dragon construct ambushes are undetectible (just dont step on the bones).
<p>
<h3>Upper Floor MOBs</h3>
Besides the traps and dragon constructs the first floor is filled with phase spiders. These can drop nice monk armor. If they hit you they proc a short distance teleport, so hope you wont land on a trap. Get these spiders slowed as soon as you can to lessen the procs. If you fight them inside the houses and close the door they wont teleport you far. Phase spiders, Dragon constructs and beetle traps are nice xp for a good level 50ish group. Make sure you dont have werewolf form on, or use AE spells near Jaled Dar's shade as he will death touch you. He is a quest mob for the key to Sleepers Tomb, get the key to his door by killing either Zlandikar and Vaniki or Neb. Then give him one of the first brood talismans to get your key.
<p>
<h3>Chetari Area</h3>
Go down the chetari tunnel (marked with a 1 on the map) there are several traps along the way, so make sure your rogue scans for traps and everyone stands behind him or her. At the intersection turn left. Now you will encounter an area with multiple traps next to eachother, be very careful there. At the next intersection turn left, you will see a big cave with many Chetari. Most mobs can not be snared or rooted in this zone so make sure you have enough killing power to stop them from running into others. Make sure you watch for wanderers, this dungeon has many of them and stopping to res people or such in the wrong place will get you dead quick. When you are settled with either one or 2 or even 4 groups, pull from the cave. Bards can be good pullers with lull song. Dispell all the rats, they have Sow and haste buffs and such which should be removed quickly. Follow with slow (I always tashanian first, but make sure you have good taunters) or they will eat you quick. Chelaki are not too hard to mez, Chetari however often require Rapture (even Glamour of Kintaz is too low and you might get resists). Make sure you interrupt the casting of the dustshapers near the end of the fight or they gate. Use either knockback spells or such or rapture, regular stuns do not affect 56+ creatures. Sometimes Vaniki will spawn in this area, you might need multiple groups to defeat him but he drops one of the best warrior taunt weapons, the willsapper which has a slow proc.
<p>
<h3>Paebela Hunting</h3>
In the Paebela area the same applies as with the chetari, make sure you dispell sow and haste buffs right away. Some of the mice (warriors) are not mezzable even with Rapture, make sure you dispel their sow before slowing them. Amorphous masses split in smaller versions when killed, which can be mezzed. But make sure you kill them quick as they could grow. Sometimes they drop a stick with 1 charge of the 39 res, give this to your monks, SK's or necros to ease CR in some raids. There is a ledge just out of the water which might be a camp spot, but be aware that the spawn rate and amount of wanderers is insanely high. The area is relatively small compared to Chetari.
<p>
There are some good maps available by Doccus of Bristlebane, found <a href="http://www.eqmaps.com/m2/necropolis3_set.zip">here.</a> The <a href="http://www.geocities.com/neferaza/Necropolis.jpg">first</a> and <a href="http://www.geocities.com/neferaza/necropolis2.jpg">second</a> level are shown on these maps.

<h2>Temple of Veeshan</h2>
<i>By Neferti - Tallon Zek</i><p>
This is an interesting zone, all the mobs here are like dragons, can not be mezzed or charmed and have an AE. Just the normal spawns here are tougher then Vox and Nagafen. Do not go here below level 55 and if hunting in HoT make sure everyone has the right faction, dont allow any kos people there if you are dragon aligned, even if you use CoH it might give problems. Use a high level monk to get single pulls, multiple AE's stacked will get you dead quick and mobs can cheal eachother.
<p>
Pulling might be difficult because of extremely bad pathing and mobs warping a lot. On every pull dispell the mobs first, some have very high damage shields on which can kill your monks quick. Follow with tashanian, malo, maybe occlusion of sound, slow and snare. If you have multiples they might dispell eachothers slow. Make sure to sieve the white wurms so they cant cheal themselves (and other dragons). You might also in addition to pushing the mob (even rogues) use torment of Argli on them to prevent gating after you sieve them. When pushing the mob make sure you dont throw it off a ledge. In the future using wizards with their anti gate spell for this will work.
<p>
If you are on Giant faction it is not easy to get in the zone, someone has to train Sontalek away from the entrance and an invis mage walks in near the entrance, then summons everyone across WW. The zone in is safe but you have to fight 8 mobs who do not drop any armor to get to the good areas, west or north. <a href="http://www.geocities.com/neferaza/tovmap.jpg">This map</a> by Sparr is useful for navigating the non HoT parts if your guild is on Giant faction.
<p>
If you are dragon aligned just run through WW invis to avoid aggro mobs like the ice burrowers, and zone in, just walk to the hub go in the door on the east wing (halls of testing or HoT) and start your pulls. Make sure to avoid Dozekar of course. If hunting in halls of testing <a href="http://www.geocities.com/neferaza/Ravhin-ToVHoT.jpg">this map</a> by Ravhin might come in handy.
<p>
Only really high level very well equipped guilds can do the north wing and most of the nameds, have many Ragebringer rogues for damage and clerics for cheal staggering on defensive tanks and outhealing the AE's or you will die there quickly. Even if you do it right flurries can quickly end your rythm. Do not go anywhere near north wing if you arent ready, these mobs are KOS to everyone.

<h2>The old planes</h2>

Some excellent guides to the planes of <a href="http://www.drawmjil.fakta.se/oc/guides/ipren2.htm">Hate</a> and <a href="http://www.geocities.com/lordhong/sky.htm">Sky</a> can be found through following the links.<p>

<h2>Trakanon</h2>
One of the more exciting dragon raids in Kunark, unlike all the others (except VP) this one is deep in a dungeon with nasty mobs around him. A good strategy is needed to kill <a href="http://www.geocities.com/neferaza/trak3.jpg">this foul beast</a> with jaws that could swallow you whole.
<ul>
<li> Dispell him at the start of the fight, he is buffed by Topalumj and much more dangerous then he is without those buffs.
<li> Get 175 PR, might use a few buffs and potions. Too much PR is a waste. Levels are more important for resisting the AE then your resists.
<li> Have shamans use their Velious quest leggings with abolish poison chain this on people.
<li> Clerics use group heals and paladins use their level 55 group heal, at least 1 paladin and one cleric or 2 clerics in each group would make the fight almost trivial.
<li> Multiple people heal the main tank, staggered cheals are not needed in a quick and easy fight as this.
<li> All healers that are not doing group heals, abolish poison and heal whoever yells or on the main tank.
<li> As soon as trak is aggroed on the main tank, use all offensive disciplines you have. If you are a healer dont worry about mana just chain your heals. The fight should be less then 30 sec. Use malo and occlusion of sound and normal fire/cold nukes will land. A quick fight means his lifetap (not the same as VS by the way) wont hit much and he wont be able to AE as much.
<li> Do not aggro him where he can not get to, he will move on the bridge or the juggernaut caverns just before the bridge, and not return for 26 minutes.
<li> Maybe group a CoH mage in the tank groups and CoH them back into the fight when they get trak touched. This could in theory bring other aggro mobs, probably wont matter or happen.
<li> A good strategy is to attack in waves, melee wave will go first and the casters go last, make sure you wait moving until he has just breathed.
<li> Have patience, pulling his lair well is not easy.
</ul>
Pulling can sometimes be done by sending a necro with harmshield, bard with level 60 invul song, cleric or paladin in, they will get trak touched to the shrooms. Trak will run by dont mind him.  Run into his lair and clear it as quick as you can. Either CoH your puller back when done or wait, Trak will buff himself a bit and come for you in his now empty lair. One way to pull is have a necro run in with harmshield, get trak touched, feign death, stand up and Trak will port there, clear his lair in the meanwhile. This way can however be very unreliable. Pulling the normal (safe) way is done as follows<p>
<h3>Loose guide to Juggers/Reets</h3>
<i>Branar - Seventh Hammer</i><p>

Basically, there are two ways to do Juggers/Reets. One is with a low 50s raid, where you have multiple people capable of slowing and rooting, but only 1 enchanter capable of kintaz. Juggers have <i>very</i> low resist rates to <i>everything</i>, so you should have no problem using root and slow to crowd control. His lair is easily pulled by one or two monks using feign. Just wait until he reaches the back and pull the juggers and the protector. No need to clear Tolapumj or his 2 guards. What you will have problems with is tanks taunting - I suggest getting yourself a shadowknight who knows what he's doing. These'll be out of your warrior's range for tauntable mobs. SKs with spells can taunt really well. Pallies can't, because their stuns break root without actually stunning the juggers. If possible get 2+ SKs so you can multitank them to keep the agro on tanks at all times. Heals on tanks shouldn't be a problem if your shamans and enchanters are keeping them ALL (yes, even the ones people aren't tanking) slowed.<p>

If you're doing it with a single group of 58+ chars, you probably don't need this guide or you shouldn't be trying it.<p>
<ul>
<li>Don't use CoH to clear your agro. It's *very* unreliable on juggers/reets, and just about never works on Trakanon himself in my experience.
<li>You will need at least one 54+ enchanter. Glamour of Kintaz is a nice near-foolproof way to mez a jugger.
<li>That said about the enchanter, your main way to crowd control should be root + turgurs, and, if you're having problems keeping them off your casters, split tanking. Glamour of Kintaz will leave your enchanter OOM most of the time, and unable to buff or to dazzle the reets (most of which can be mezzed with plain old dazzle).
<li>The pulling is very straightforward, unless you want to try something crazy like getting Tolapmuj with Trakanon still up  There's only one path to take once you're in the jugger area with mobs in it.
<li>Be careful in the courtyard area (just under the bridge past the first 2 jugger spawns). The pathing there sucks and if you let the two outside juggers respawn, it can be hell to keep them from agroing (and +2 juggers onto what you already have can easily kill a low 50s raid).
<li>Remember that juggers and reet casters DO NOT see invis (except for possibly the roamer jugger, not sure...). Neither do 99% of all myconids. An invis'd cleric can easily do CR himself.
</ul>
If you truly don't know the way to get to the jugger area or don't know how to go through it once you're there, have a rogue with sneak/hide or a caster with imp invis explore the myconid area until you find it, and then have an invis'd monk go through the area until he understands how to pull it.
<p><br>
<h2>Venril Sathir, Scalekeeper and other lifetap proccing mobs</h2>
<i>By Neferti - Tallon Zek</i><p>
For <a href="http://www.geocities.com/neferaza/VSdown6.jpg">these mobs</a> it is very important to keep aggro at one person the entire time. Get a small group of people who can do damage fast, a few lure capable wizards and a few rogues are always nice you need a high level (55+) warrior with good AC and fast proccing weapons to taunt. First off dont give anyone but the main tanks any HP buffs, certainly not the casters (because of low AC) this only makes VS tap more. If casters get aggroed there is no time to outtaunt anyways in the time it takes VS to kill them so its best they only get tapped once instead of twice or 3 times. Preferably everyone is runed with the same rune, though you might want to use rune 5 on all tanks pre fight and none on the casters and use rune 3 during the fight on the main tank.<p>

Send your main tank in first, and let him taunt a bit... two enchanters (preferably of the same level) stagger casts of rune on him, a little more then 2 seconds apart (half the casting time). Rune 3 suffices, but if you are wealthy you could use rune 5 for a little extra safety net (you might use certain other enchanter spells as an extra safety net too).<p>

Make sure the main tank is the closest player to Venril at all times, as aggro is partly proximity based, all others stand behind him and as far as possible while still able to hit him. Enchanters check continually with an /assist on Venril Sathir who is the current highest on the aggro list (which should be the MA). If someone else but the main tank is on the list... then shout this and rune as soon as you can, the main enchanters will switch to this target if needed and it is a warrior with defensive. If this is another like a wizard just let them die, or kill them quick if your on a PvP server - they did something wrong by overaggroing so dont let VS drain all their hitpoints too. Wizards will wait till VS is quite hurt until nuking (some say 70 health some say 50). Do not chain nuke in the beginning, wait at least a second or two before recasting, if you get aggroed you just undid all your damage. Hopefully it will be a quick fight, if it takes too long and he lifetaps a few times just port to DL and try again.
<p><br>
