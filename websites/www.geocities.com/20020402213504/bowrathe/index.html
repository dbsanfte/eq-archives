<b><u>3/31/02</u></b>&nbsp; Happy Easter! Couple new people recruited this week.

Taldrid &amp; Ravienn), Correct (53 Shaman sponser Rimcy), and Balbus(38 Warrior

&nbsp;3 people broke into level 46 this week. Congratz to Desseray the Enchanter,
Atheyna the Paladin, and Xazionsor the Shaman!<br>
&nbsp;Only one raid this weekend with it being a holiday. On Friday we went into
Kael and had about 20 people show up. Taldrid picked up a <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=30221">Kromzek Surveyor Scope</a>. Good job to everyone that came along!<br>
&nbsp;Other than that keep up the great work!
<p><b><u>3/24/02</u></b>&nbsp; Recruiting is now by application ONLY. RL family and
friends are still welcome. We want everyone to
focus on leveling there main and get into the planes. This is where the killer
loot is at so we want to do this ASAP. Still, we picked up Sildayen(51 Necro)
and Halanmer(11 Warr). Make em welcome!<br>
&nbsp;In Epic News, Artanus got a piece towards his(Tears of Erollisi) in OT.
Xazionsor got his Dire Wolf pelt in MM. Congratz to you 2 and the groupage ;^)<br>
&nbsp;Necria the Paladin has broken into 46 and joined the planes roster. Good
job!!!<br>
&nbsp;Naggy got us again. A lil closer this time, but we got good practice in. Good
job everyone who made it. CoM was a fun lil trip. No major items. Minor CR to
end it. Again, good job!<br>
&nbsp;Please, please, PLEASE, scan the guild roster, and if you know something
is wrong with it(someone listed that left, a tagged toon not listed, or level is
wrong) PLEASE send an <A HREF="mailto:bowrathe@yahoo.com">e-mail</A>. I've
gotten 1 response to this so far. Also, we need everyone to sign up on the
message boards. Go there and at least post under your class to let us know you
are alive.<br>
&nbsp;Not much else to report this week. Keep checking the message boards and the
calendar for news, info, and events. See ya in game.</p>
<p>
<b><u>3/17/02</u></b>&nbsp; Great week for the guild. Every night(early morning
for you stateside) there seemed to be a pickup group in LGuk. Recruiting was
outstanding this week and brought in at least 14 new people that I saw (Seguin, Borrick, Devastatian, Shahara, Dadalek, Spartacis, Hiede,
Gorron, Batousai, Ktulu, Braveslayer, Bliff, Necria, and Alcandre) 7 of which are planeable.
Welcome them to the family when you seen them. Also, everyone is flying through levels it seems,
and its hard to keep the <A HREF="http://pub57.ezboard.com/fbloodofwarfrm34.showMessage?topicID=12.topic" onMouseOut="window.status=' ';return true" onMouseOver="window.status='Guild Roster';return true">roster</A> up to date. Check it and if your char info is incorrect
or missing, and drop me an <A HREF="mailto:bowrathe@yahoo.com">e-mail</A>.&nbsp;On
that note Shaar the Necromancer has broken into 46 and joins the planes roster.
Also our fearless leader Rimcy has gotten his alt cleric Rimedy to 46.<br>
&nbsp;In epic news, Moochas picked up
the hilt for his Soulfire. Gratz bro!<br>
&nbsp;One thing we are looking for is for someone to make us a cool graphic for
the top of this page and our message board. Can be the same or 2 different ones.
I make this quick with paint so I know a lot better can be done ;^)<br>
&nbsp;Couple of raids this weekend. Castle Mistmoore was for 25+, Lady Vox was
40-52 and was a request from a friend of a guildee and we had some
people go, but no report on either when I'm posting this.<br>
&nbsp;Nagafen (40-52) went down to 10% and then we had to do a major CR.&nbsp;Gratz
to Moochas on his Razing Sword of Skarlon(25dmg 40dly effect serpent sight<font FACE="MS Serif" SIZE="1">)</font>
and Azmodania on a <A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=4505">Polished Mithril Mask</A><br>
&nbsp;Weekend schedule so far : Friday 7pmEST Nagafen Rnd 2. Sat 7pmEST City of
Mist. Go to the message boards and sign up.&nbsp; And thats it for the week. See
ya all in-game ;^)</p>
<p>
<b><u>3/10/02</u></b>&nbsp; News for the week. Added a links section to the
page. Recruiting has been changed to 46+ except for RL family and friends. No
scheduled raids this weekend, but had a couple on-the-spot Kael raids. Taldrid
finally got his toon planeable. Took ya long enough!&nbsp; Recruiting going
well. Names I've recieved that were added this week were Banisher (Erick&nbsp;
52 Enchanter), Deing (Cathy aka Ding&nbsp; 52 Enchanter), Foodal (51 Warrior),
and Careen (Brad&nbsp; 17 Paladin). Make our new friends feel welcome.<br>
&nbsp;There have been lots of reports of scamming happening with trades lately.
BE CAREFUL WHO YOU TRADE WITH. Best rule is not to trust anyone. Don't give them
an item unless they are giving you the money at the same time. If they have to
&quot;log on an alt to give you the money&quot; don't give it to them till they
give you the money. Worst I heard in our guild was someone losin a Fungi
Tunic(20k). So BE CAREFUL.<br>
&nbsp;At least one raid happening this weekend, possibly 2. One mid-lvl and one
upper lvl. Check the message boards for more info.</p>
