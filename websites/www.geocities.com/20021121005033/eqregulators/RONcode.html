<FONT FACE="Boca Raton ICG" SIZE=7 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="CENTER">Code Of Conduct</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"> </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Boca Raton ICG" SIZE=5 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="CENTER">Membership:</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" COLOR="#ffff00"><P>Eligiblilty: The Regulators of Norrath always seek those who wish to follow the principles set forth in our mission statement. We wish to invite all that seek such affiliation to visit the new membres area on the forum within this site.. Once done the officers of the Guild will review the application and contact the applicant for interviews and discussion of any additional questions that the officers have. Also the officers may request that the applicant hunt with a group containing one or more of the guild members to review their performance in a group setting. The officers will at that time vote on the acceptability of the applicant, upon approval the applicant will be placed on a 30 day probationary membership in the guild. At the end of that time the new member will have his conduct reviewed and upon approval will be granted full membership status.</P>
<P>Requirements: Each member in good standing is expected to follow fully the ideals set forth in the mission statement as displayed on the homepage of this website. Each member is expected to answer all guild calls such as are deemed necessary by the officers of the guild. Each member is expected to post their character information on the thread listed every two weeks. Each member agrees to accept the authority of all officers and obey any request made by any officer. Each member understands that the officer corp of The Regulators of Norrath has been carefully selected and as such has full power to impart discipline and to choose and remove members as the officers see fit for the good of the guild as a whole.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Boca Raton ICG" SIZE=5 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="CENTER">Character Additions:</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" COLOR="#ffff00"><P>Each member may add additional characters to the guild after their main character has attained the level of 20. Such addition is at the discretion of the officer corp. The application process is a simple request to the officer of both his current class and the class of his new character. Then the request will be discussed by the officers and a decision rendered. The restrictions made on such additions will be 3 characters additional to an officer, and 2 characters additional to any member. Any additional requests will be discussed by the officer corp in each situation.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Boca Raton ICG" SIZE=5 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="CENTER">Camping Issues:</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" COLOR="#ffff00"><P>Each member is required to follow the play nice rules issued by the producers of Everquest. Such rules were implemented in the guild long before they became public domain in the land. Therefore, in camping situations, each member must attempt to resolve any request over camping rights with equality and fairness to all groups involved. Only in issues involving a rare spawn may a dispute over camping issues be exempt from the rule of equal sharing of a spawn. Even in these situations, all members are required to state their rights to the camp with the utmost decorum. And always with the feelings of the other group in the forefront of their mind. If a member is involved in a group outside the guild, and issue is taken over the spawn and the spawn is common, where no agreement can be reached in negotiation, then the member is encouraged to leave the group and seek a group elsewhere.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Boca Raton ICG" SIZE=5 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="CENTER">Item Requests:</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" COLOR="#ffff00"><P>Any member may formally request help in hunting an item by posting such request on the website. The officers will then review the request and make a time for the hunt if approved. There are a few simple rules that we follow in establishing these hunts. The petitioner must be present at the hunt. We will only hunt an item which is dropped by a mob no more than 5 levels above the level of the requester. Any other loot from the hunt belongs to the group or groups of the hunt and only the item requested will be presented to the requesting member, this is left to the descretion of the hunt corrdinator whomever that may be. To be eligable for a hunt a member must commit to and join other hunts for other members. Once an item is attained then no other may be requested by that member until 3 other hunts have been accomplished. Once a hunt has been started, the hunt will continue until the item is attained before moving to the next hunt. We will try to schedule these so that the maximum number of members may be available for the hunt. The hunt date and time will be posted on the Events thread of the web page for all members. The above rules apply to only items hunted for an individual by formal request to the guild, they do not pertain to gifts by the guild, guild member, officer or any other items which are attained by being a member of the guild.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Boca Raton ICG" SIZE=5 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="CENTER">Discipline:</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" COLOR="#ffff00"><P>Fraud: Any member whos is accused and confirmed of defrauding another person through trade or item selling will be subject to immediate dismissal from the guild. If such happens then at no time may this person again enter the guild with the present character nor any other character. This is considered a violation to the utmost and will be punished as such. </P>
<P> </P>
<P>Kill Stealing: At no time may a member of The Regulators of Norrath engage in killstealing of a mob from another person. If a mob has aggroed upon another and a member intentionally takes such a mob then the member will be immediately placed on probation. The member must restore the item to the rightful person, if it is a no drop then he must assist in a camp to retrieve another item for the person. Two such intentional abuses will be cause for dismissal from the guild. Loot stealing by a member of the guild will be approached in the same way. Two such intentional abuses will be cause for dismissal from the guild. </P>
<P> </P>
<P>Probation: Any member placed on probation for offenses will remain so for 30 days. At that time the officers will convene and discuss the member and at that time either meet with the member for consultation or remove the member from the guild. Repeated offenses for the same infraction of our code will be cause for dismissal from the guild without additional probationary periods. We accept that all who are members of our guild are mature and understand the sensibilities of society and those who cannot abide by common decency have no place among our members. </P>
<P> </P>
<P>Missing In Action: Any member who does not post the requested character information for four weeks will be placed on MIA status in the members board. Should the member not post the requested information for an additional 4 weeks they shall be placed on Inactive status. That member is then subject to removal from the guild by a vote of the officers. </P>
<P> </P>
<P>Removal: Any member may request to be removed from the guild for personal reasons and once the problem is resolved whether internal or external will be reinstated by request of such from the officers. Any member who has been removed for MIA may be reinstated after requesting such from an officer and officer corp approval. Any member who has been removed from the guild for any discipline infraction other than those listed above at no time may be reinstated to the guild, with that character nor any later character.</P>
