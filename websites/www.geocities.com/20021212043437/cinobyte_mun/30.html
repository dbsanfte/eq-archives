<center><u>Entry 21</u>
<p>I have ended my banking venture suddenly. Many customers insisted they would "Cry and whine to the GMs about Mumferd farming Hill Giants". Whatever the hell that means. First of all...I do not "farm". I "slay". There is quite a difference, as I showed one person who's head I crushed within a rather thick Dictionary.
<p>And second of all...who are these GMs they speak of? Some evil force I imagine. Perhapes demons torn from their worlds and forced to save the pathetic people from hurting themselves on their own "Good intentions".
I shall dub these insane yet fascinating beings ~Gawd Monkies~, ...until i find a way to exploit or destroy them. 
<p><u>Entry 22</u>
<p>A bunch of fellows I know decided out of the blue to pay a visit and beat down some lass up in Everfrost. I figured that with nothing better to do, and Mr. Ralph trying to entertain us with his kazoo and "Rub your belly and pat your head at the same time" trick, I could do much worse then freeze my little bald head off again.<br>
Mistake number one: Deciding to get a port to Surefall Glade. Within seconds it was obvious that my year of constant Treant slaying did not go unnoticed by the Druid guild. Intense negotiations were required to win my release before my execution. But to hell with all that, I just burned down the forest and made a break for it in all the chaos.
<br>
Mistake number two: Assuming that the HUGE corridors of Permafrost were so that the Ice Goblins had a bit of breathing room. Here I am, invited to help destroy some evil chick by the name of Lady Vox, and not a single person decided to mention exactly what RACE this Lady Vox might be from. The resulting battle was not pretty. Do to a lack of information I was only armed with a rose and a box of chocolates ("Mumferd the Pimp" as Mr. Ralph would comment).
<br>As usual Mumferd prevails! As my team was devoured in groups, Mr. Ralph and I slipped out the back unnoticed. 
<p>Vox really isn't my type anyway.
<p><u>Entry 23</u>
<p>It must be pretty rough to be a gnoll in Black Burrow. Their home smack-dab right between the Everfrost mountains and the Queynos hills. Whenever a Barbarian wants a bit of sun or a Human wants to start a snowball fight....someone is going to die! I've made quite a few enemies there myself. 
On each visit I take a few moments and leap into the underground lake then fight my way back up to the surface. Occasionally I do this a few times a day. Nothing funnier than a Gnoll screaming "Oh @#$%...not again". 
<p>I once went to a therapist with my obsession about blowing things up. His family is still searching for him to this very day.
<p><u>Entry 24</u><p>
I still don't appear to be one of the more favorite gnomes in the city of Qeynos. Again that Treant killing year might be to blame, but I don't think that helping Flippy the Gnoll take over the city impressed many residents either.
<br>Bleh. Politics. 
<br>Put a Gnoll in charge of a government and everyone hates you....cept the Gnoll. Course, someone should have informed Flippy that you can't just sit in a throne and expect everyone to actually accept you as ruler. But I think he sort of got the idea as he was tied down to one of those shuttle boats, which was sent out towards Eurudin as someone lit it on fire.
<p>Note to self: Burning hair is an unpleasant smell. Tinker together a gas mask before visiting Splitpaw.
<p><u>Entry 25</u><p>
Mr. Ralph and I have set up camp somwhere in the Desert of Ro. The big problem with deserts is everything looks a lot like everything else, which means we will have more luck locating a useful Druid then we will a land mark. So in other words...no chance whatsoever. My biggest complaint concerning the tree hugging, moss licking, wolf [CENSORED] druids is... Lack of creativity. They run around in circles and pick on large numbers of orcs at a time, casting nasty, nausiating, spells that will eventually kill you just before you die of old age.
<p>I watched a druid performing this "ritual" earlier. The poor orcs were confused and bewildered, trying to decide if they should continue to chase this annoying pest, or simply allow his spells to do them in a minute earlier then they were originally fated to kick the bucket.
The orcs were also quite pleased when I arrived on the scene and presented them with a little device I like to call a "sniper rifle".
<br> I also honestly don't think Druid brains should be that color...but it's a not worth a rant.
<p><u>Entry 26</u><p>
Ever hear of something called an Ancient Cyclops? Yeah. Me neither. I don't like to get involved in current events that consist of those one eyed, walking, giant, jolly lawn gnomes. Someone always ends up having to go searching for some bodily organ he just happens to be unable to live without. 
<br>I think everyone should be born with more than just one or two expendable organs. More organs = Bigger mess.
<br> Seems though that a few in the world have heard of this Old Man Cyclops and congregate every few days to see that this Senior Citizen stop dipping into their 401K plans. Someone said something about a ring as well...but that's not news to me. When anyone in the Mumferd Family dies, I go for the jewlery first too.
<br>It was quite the sight for a bunch of youngins gang beating on this poor Veteran of Norrath who just happened to be in the wrong desert at the wrong time. Bards darting beneath the monster's legs playing a "Groin Crush" song. Druids circling the fight trying to bore the beast to death. Shaman's off to the side doing "Only Gawd Knows" with their animal companions. Bout that time I decided that if anything in Norrath is gonna die a terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad death...it would be Mumferd laughing over the corpse.
<br>Finding a nice rock with a good view of the battlefield, I raised my arms and began to cast "Death from Above" spells as quickly as I could. (Downing a Beer or two while waiting for my concentration to return has proven quite effective in the past as well).  The One-Eyed Monkey Boy collapsed in a heap as I finished him off with a purple golf ball I stole from a Mini-Golf course in Freeport. The other combatants were furious of course...accusing me of "KSing". (Another of those incomplete words that every one assumes is the Common Language but really is nothing more than a funny word that a Troll would get a kick out of every time he heard it. I of course only laughed the first time)
I slowly made my way to my fallen prey and casualy relieved him of everything he had including the "ring" which to me was about the size of a small swimming pool.(Oooh. Can you say..."Hot-Tub"?)<p>Mr. Ralph looks so miserable carrying it. I'll have to put a bag over his head or something. 
<p><u>Entry 27</u><p>
I have returned to my city of birth. Ak'Anon! It's obvious that people remember me. Because they are all hiding. This is a pretty common occurance since the incident last year when I started the holiday Bonfire using firewater and druids (They were hugging the trees). <br>Like most of my kin, I have a nasty habit of putting together bits of useless junk to create larger junk (Anyone who has created a catapult knows what I'm talking about). Today I decided I would work on something called an "Aqualung". This is a device that is used for long nights of intense drinking. It keeps the drunk from drowning in any type of liquid going down...or up for that matter. The parts for this device are scattered around a bit, so I figured I might as well do a bit of sightseeing while I search out the needed vendors and pull them from their hiding spots <p>They can smell Doom. I know they can.
<p>First stop was the Ak'Anon zoo, where my fellow gnomes keep an ABSOLUTELY AMAZING FANTASTIC zoo consisting of mearly 3 animals. In fact it was so amazing, that the 3 animals sat around doing nothing. I figured these animals might just be a tad bit more exciting if I released them into the wild that is the Gnomish marketplace.
<br> First up...Mr. Bear. Casting a levitation spell, I began to lift the Ursine into the air. Up and up. Moving it slowly towards the edge of its enclosure. But then Mr. Ralph shouted "pull" and instincts took over. Although I was upset at Mr. Ralph for a while..I must say that my casting time on that fireball was the quickest I've ever seen. The bear however...will never get another chance to compare. <br>
Next was the tiger. I wanted at least one bit of footage for the next "Fox: When Animals Attack" broadcast so I gagged Mr. Ralph just in case. For this one, I simply moved into the enclosure and pushed the tiger off the edge. I'm sure the tiger was kicking itself for not thinking of this before, and shuffled off like a good 10 foot kitty with a thirst for blood.
<p>The last one might be a bit difficult. The Minotaur. Glancing at the sign by his enclousure it seemed this particular Minotaur went by the name of Binky. We sat around in his enclosure for a while. Had a bit of tea and talked about life on the outside and hanging with Meldreth and his homies.
As I released him, Binky mumbled something about "Taking a stalking probe and shoving it up Gimblestan's arse and see how he likes it"...but I honestly wasn't paying too close attention. 

<p><u>Entry 28 A.</u><p>
Do you ever get the feeling that complete strangers have been reading your personal diary?
<p>Maybe somewhere around <IMG SRC=http://visit.geocities.com/counter.gif ALT="Counter"> in fact? Dear Gawd...I'm going to need a bigger lock.
<p><u>Entry 28 B.</u><p>

The land of Kunark is one of two continents that simply went missing for some time. There are many theories that address exactly how one can loose two giant land masses (each within a 20 minute swimming distance) that should be as clear as a female troll dancing on your head... but I just blame the elves. Anything with pointy ears that doesn't come with a tricorder should not be trusted. (By the way. Wood Elf is a misleading term. Much like druids they are lousy for starting fires. Hopefully we can soon start breeding Kindling Elves.)
<br>Given time and the current rate at which we do discover new continents, we will likely find such a large number of them that the entire world will be one large landmass in six years...and the oceans we thought were there were really all just in our imaginations from the get go. 
<br>Sort of makes the thought of all the time you have wasted waiting for the damn boats to pick you up a bit depressing huh? <br>
Regardless of this, Mr. Ralph and I spent quite a few hours at the Dwarf dock awaiting a ride across Timorous deep. Sadly neither of us are really all that patient, which was an unfortunate, shall we say...situation, for those in the vicinity. 
<p>Note: Humanoid Sacrifices apparently do not will the boats to move any faster. Deportation would likely be the best option for next time.<p>
The ship we sailed on, was so beautiful, so luxurious... that we had to spend half the trip on shuttles to get to the boat simply because a ship like that wouldn't be caught dead (Assuming that ships were actually alive and I wasn't high from that Halfling Cheesecake I snitched earlier) near anything of Dwarven make. Which really isn't fair cause Dwarven Ale is really the best substitute for Assasin Poison when the relatives just won't leave.
<br> Within 5 minutes of boarding the boat, Mr. Ralph and I had found the bar (Not our best time I agree, but the last boat we were on had flimsier walls). It was a truly horrifying experience. No bar tender, no poker table, no silly drunk guy to toss overboard, and I had the distinct impression that the beer bottles along the wall were actually painted on. I was so angry that now Mr. Ralph has a bit of a nervous twitch whenever someone mentions a "fork".
<br>Despite the lack of alcohol, one major problem on these boats, is its a bit difficult to make a complaint when the only crew on the boat are the passengers themselves. Now I might be simply jumping the gun here, but unless gnomes have created some sort of advanced auto pilot system, a ship without someone at the helm is one of those "Holy @#$% We are all gonna Die!!" situations.
<br>Luckily the ship never crashed on sharp rocks, killing everyone onboard.<br>The Iksar pirates that boarded us beat the rocks to that honor.
<br>Normally I'm all for this blood, violence, and women ravaging thing. But this time, half the passengers that were killed owed me money, and most of the women on board were Ogres.
<p> I have now seen things that denizens of the Plane of Fear would claw their own eyes out in hopes that the intense pain might make them forget.
<p> The battle was like one from those stories of Sea Adventure where the heroes always eventually use a knife to descend a sail and eventually get their shirt off at some point or another...except in this version We just blew up the ship (Wasn't just me this time. Group effort). I did eventually end up shirtless...but I was just wearing some very flamable material.
<br>The aftermath was a sea of Lizard bodies and wooden planks. To get back to shore I created a makeshift raft with the materials present at the time.
<p>TGIF: Thank Goodness Iksar Float...
<p><u>Entry 29</u>
<p><i>Day 1</i>: We came ashore just off the coast of Kunark, somewhere amongst a string of scattered islands (You know. The kind that all shipwreck survivors traditionally find themselves on? So why break with tradition?). Best part is, we landed just as the Natives were dragging Leonardo Dicaprio, kicking and screaming, back towards the ocean.
<p>With some Hula girls for atmosphere, this could be my kinda place.
<p>To begin with however, it was imperative that we find ourselves a home away from home. As luck would have it, the beach was covered in small little houses without any owners. There were a lot of Ogres loitering about, but I figure some force beyond my understanding nicknamed "So-Knee?" decided that this would be a great place to randomly put Ogres. But hey. Someone put them there for a reason...and as long as that reason is "Shark Bait", then I didn't let anyone down. Mumferd aims to please (which is better than missing completely and letting my target swim out of range).
<p><i>Day 2</i>: Mr. Ralph and I are adapting quite well to our island paradise. We have burned everything available here, so if the Island could possibly adapt to us just a little bit as well, we all might be better off. We have a few neighbors to deal with as well. 
Just down the beach from us, are a couple that seem to get along pretty well together. One is an ex Mail-carrying Bard from an off-shoot branch called "Fed-Ex" (Course I don't think I've ever met a Mail-Carrying Bard who actually carried his own mail. Frankly it was I who ended up doing their work for them most of the time). His partner is a beachball named Wilson.
<br>When the food runs out, I'm betting on the Beachball.
<br>The other neighbor, Mr. Ralph and I don't try to talk about much. Just some fat hairy guy who runs around the island naked. Its a dying fad if you ask me...
<p><i>Day 3</i>: Blew something up...it died.
<p><i>Day 4</i>: Came across an interesting fellow today. A shipwrecked Goblin I have nicknamed "Friday", simply because today is Tuesday (It makes sense if you are in the right circles. Dont bother me). Despite being painfully useful for more TGIF jokes...Friday has given me a broader outlook on the whole Racial Diversity Conflict: Not only are Goblins ugly but they smell real bad too.
<br>Leading him back to the campsite, we had to stop more than a few times as Friday ran off to beat his head against a nearby rock. Seems fairly clear now that this boy has been drinking just a wee bit too much Seawater.
