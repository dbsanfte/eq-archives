            <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>
            <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was born in the
            tree tops of Kelethin among the wood elves of the area.&nbsp; My
            father&nbsp;was born and raised in Freeport, being a Cleric he was
            brought up in the Temple of Mithaniel Marr in the northern part of
            the city.&nbsp; My mother was a very quite woman not belonging to
            any&nbsp;class within the tree tops she made cloths and some leather
            armor for the young ones there.&nbsp; She often sold these hand
            crafted items to the merchants all over the city.&nbsp; My parents
            met while my father was stationed within Felwith, he rushed to
            Kelethin one day when the Orcs of Crushbone mounted an offense
            against the wood elves of Kelethin.&nbsp; He saved my mother from
            certain death with the last of his healing manna.&nbsp; He was soon
            killed afterward, only to be resurrected by a young cleric shortly
            after he fell.&nbsp; I was born shortly after there 6 month wedding
            anniversary, with both the characteristics of Human, and Elf.&nbsp;
            I was accepted only because of who my father was, but that was
            enough for me.&nbsp; I was young and unsure of what I wanted to do,
            I was just happy with playing in the tree tops with my friends,
            never thinking of leaving the area.&nbsp; On my tenth birthday my
            father announced to my mother and I that he was being called back to
            Freeport across the dangerous Ocean of Tears.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We began our journey
            to Freeport, it was a long dangerous trip, luckily we had an
            uneventful trip and arrived in Freeport 2 days after the trip began.&nbsp;
            I learned quickly that Freeport was no place for a child to play.&nbsp;
            West, and East Freeport was off limits to me, as that was where the
            Militia was housed.&nbsp; I wasn't allowed to leave North Freeport,
            or go many places within the area.&nbsp; I mostly stayed home but
            mother would make me sow, and help with the things she made.&nbsp; I
            would also have to accompany her to the market where the Coalition
            of Trade Folks met to sell their things.&nbsp; I was teased a lot, I
            was not as welcome there as I was in Kelethin, I was beat up by a
            lot of the kids, and the adults shunned me for being a &quot;half
            breed&quot;.&nbsp; It was hard to get along, I knew I didn't want to
            make garments my entire life (a woman's job) so I set out to become
            a cleric like my father.&nbsp; I was certain I would make it because
            of who my father was, just&nbsp;because of who my father was.&nbsp;
            No matter how hard I tried I could not keep up with my studies, I
            could not learn as fast as the other students and after several
            months of trying to keep up I was asked to leave the temple.&nbsp;
            My grades had fallen so far behind I could not keep my enrollment.&nbsp;
            I wasn't failing, but I wasn't what the other kids where either,
            they learned so fast, and there mediation skill was something I
            could only dream about.&nbsp; I was frustrated but determined to
            find my spot in this city.&nbsp; I walked over to the Hall of Truth
            still in the area my father allowed me to travel, and enrolled.&nbsp;
            The teachings where centered around fighting rather than the art of
            casting.&nbsp; I was sure this was where I belonged, I knew I would
            do well here.&nbsp; After a few weeks I began to fall behind like
            before.&nbsp; I spoke with my parents about it and they assured me I
            could do it.&nbsp; When we began our meditation skills within the
            Hall I was well beyond the other students who where just learning.&nbsp;
            Unfortunately they closed the gap quickly, and with there combined
            skills of fighting and casting I was unable to keep up, and once
            again asked to drop out.&nbsp; I bowed my head and began to look for
            another area to excel in.&nbsp; I stayed at home for the next year
            practicing what I learned between the paladin guild and the cleric
            guild, I combined both sets of skills to become stronger.&nbsp; I
            was still not as advanced as the other in each of the classes but I
            though if I learned from all classes I could defeat any foe I came
            across.&nbsp; I of course kept this to myself, passing from one
            class to the other until I was eventually asked to leave&nbsp; as
            each began the more advanced studies.&nbsp; My parents unaware, of
            my intentions or my studies continued to push me to become something
            worth while in the city.&nbsp; I learned blacksmithing skills until
            my techniques in it where advanced enough to do most anything that
            was asked of me.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A month after I
            flunked out of the Enchanters school I heard of a competition that
            was being sponsored by&nbsp; the Warriors of West Freeport.&nbsp; I
            began my work immediately, training day in and day out, until I was
            able to duel wield with the best of the students.&nbsp; I though to
            myself this was my chance to show my parents and everyone that had
            looked down upon me I was someone.&nbsp; The day of the competition
            was at hand, I was one of the first to fight.&nbsp; My melee skills
            not as strong as my competitor I used the skills I learned from my
            monk teaches before they removed my toboggan and saw I was less than
            human.&nbsp; Not able to hit as hard as most I relied on my agility
            and won the first match.&nbsp; My parent where proud and for once I
            felt like I was something special.&nbsp; I fought the same way for
            the next few matches each match getting harder and harder until I
            was down to the semi finals.&nbsp; By this time the day had lost
            most of its sun light and the stadium was packed.&nbsp; I was called
            on to fight against a young boy whom I had never met.&nbsp; My
            parents said they had also moved from Kelethin.&nbsp; I looked at
            him as he took off his cloak, I looked into his unsteady eyes, and
            was suprised when he removed his head piece to see pointed ears.&nbsp;
            He was half elf too, with much the same characteristics as I.&nbsp;
            I stepped into the arena as they announced our names.&nbsp; The
            crowed didn't seem to pleased with either of us being in this arena
            and having made it this far, we where not human, even worse we where
            half breeds and didn't really belong to any race.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was the first to be
            introduced &quot;Jondin&quot; the introduction rang in my ears as
            silence followed within the crowd.&nbsp; Why did they not cheer for
            me? Did I not work as hard as the humans that where there, even the
            wood elf maiden that was there was treated with respect and
            kindness.&nbsp; &quot;Necklare&quot; the burly warrior yelled as he
            introduced my opponent.&nbsp; The fight began and I soon found
            myself eating dirt as his strength was greater than mine.&nbsp; I
            could not rely simply on my agility, a gift I was granted by the
            gods from being half human, and half elf.&nbsp; This Warrior had
            much of the same skill I had, he was faster, stronger, and I soon
            found myself bleeding into the ground.&nbsp; The fight was over in a
            matter of minutes, I could not hold him off, I could not get within
            his defenses.&nbsp; It wasn't really a fight with him, he slipped
            end of his sword across my temple and I passed out.&nbsp; I found
            out later that night he did not attend the warriors school there in
            Freeport but his brother had trained him.&nbsp; I was also happy to
            hear he was the one who won the grand prize.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night I sat in
            the darkness crying, I failed myself, and my family again.&nbsp; I
            did not belong in this place, I wanted to go home, but I knew I
            nothing would change there because my father would still be in
            Freeport, he was the only reason I was accepted in Kelethin.&nbsp; I
            ran out of the house, my destination was east Freeport, I was going
            to sneak abort the boat and head back to Kelethin.&nbsp; Wanted in
            Kelethin or not, it was my home, and that was where I would spend my
            days.&nbsp; On the way to the docks I meet a group of boys talking.&nbsp;
            One of the finalists of the tournament was there, boasting of his
            deeds.&nbsp; I though to myself that should have been me there in
            the center of them, what stories I could tell.&nbsp; As I walked
            passed them in a hurry to get out of the Western part of the city he
            stopped me.&nbsp; I did not want to stop but knew if I didn't I
            would be though a coward.&nbsp; I stood up straight and turned to
            face him.&nbsp; He stepped out in front of his friends, and began to
            mock me and my family.&nbsp; The other kids just stood behind him
            and laughed.&nbsp; I tried to ignore it, and turn away, but he
            grabbed me and threw me to the ground, continuing with his mockery.&nbsp;
            He had no weapon and I knew my skills in hand to hand combat where
            far superior to his after being taught by my monk trained for so
            many weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;I attacked him, he was a slow warrior, strong
            and steady in his attacks but slow non the less.&nbsp; I continued
            to connect blow after blow, until his face begin to bleed, I knew he
            was nothing without his weapons.&nbsp; The more I hit him the more
            angry I got, I began to scream, almost to the point of chanting with
            each blow I dealt.&nbsp; One of the boys threw him a knife and he
            came at me slicing my right arm with the blade.&nbsp; I fell to the
            ground stunned as he kicked me in the ribs.&nbsp; I fought for the
            strength to stand up straight.&nbsp; I tried to sneak off, but they
            saw me again.&nbsp; The young warrior began to charge me, I tilted
            my head back and let loose a bellow, the young warrior stopped in
            his tracks and began to shake, as every bone in his body was struck
            by a force.&nbsp; The boy fell to the ground, barley alive blood
            flowing from his ears only.&nbsp; I was shocked, I stood there and
            stared, unsure of what I had just done.&nbsp; The other boys
            scattered into the shadows as there friend laid there bleeding.&nbsp;
            I ran toward the docks hopping for a short wait on the boat.&nbsp;
            After entering the Eastern part of the city I saw the half elf
            warrior that had beaten me earlier in the day staggering in the
            streets, I began to run to him, but a large man atop a giant horse
            came charging by, and in one movement swooped the young boy atop his
            ride and kept going.&nbsp; If I would have blinked I wouldn't have
            seen it at all.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I continued my
            journey back to Kelethin.&nbsp; It was a long trip, but once out of
            Freeport I was content to what ever happened next.&nbsp; When I
            arrived in Kelethin,&nbsp;news had already arrived of my defeat
            within the city across the ocean.&nbsp; It was very difficult moving
            around the city, the Warriors and ranges knew of my defeat, and the
            scholars of each class knew of my failures.&nbsp;&nbsp;One evening
            while speaking to a beautiful druid atop the Kelethin lifts the Bard
            guild master heard of my tail of what happened to the young warrior
            in the streets of Freeport.&nbsp; She took me in, explained to me
            what had happened, and how I used my voice as a tool.&nbsp; She
            trained me how to use my voice along with all the other skills I
            already learned.&nbsp; The spells I learned of minor healing in
            Freeport, she showed me how to heal while humming a soft Hymn.&nbsp;
            She showed me how to defend myself and those around me while
            chanting a battle tune.&nbsp; I continued my training within the
            Kelethin Bard guild.&nbsp; I have since then told many stories to
            people around Norrath of my travels, and of what happened that night
            in Freeport.&nbsp; I have spread stories of the corrupt Freeport
            Militia, and of the dragons that plague this great land.&nbsp; I
            have yet to learn, or see all there is, but I will continue
            traveling these lands, helping those that I can, and joining forces
            with those in need.&nbsp; I have yet to find my place in this land,
            but I know what class I belong too.&nbsp; I am a Bard, a voice that
            can be&nbsp;both seductive,&nbsp;or bitter&nbsp;to those around me.&nbsp;
            I can make you love me with one tone, and hate me with another.&nbsp;
            Many say a tongue can be a two edged sword?&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree, but
            knowing when to use it as a sword to strike with, and a honeycomb to
            seduce with, is a talent only a Bard can know.</font>
