<p><b>Creation : <br>
  When creating a druid you will start with 30 ability points . Wisdom is the 
  most important .i recommend pouring 10 of those ability points into this category.<br>
  The rest distribute as you see fit ;)</b></p>
<p><b> Getting started :<br>
  When you enter the game you will be close to your guild , Soldiers Of Tunare 
  . Enter the guild and give your note to Heartwood Master -He will , in return 
  , give you a guild tunic and some experience points. When you 'Hail' him , he 
  will give you a small task to complete . Finding your way to the elevator/Lift 
  is the most difficult part of beginning ,if you are not already familiar with 
  Kelethin. I have found , though , that searching for it is the best way to learn 
  your way around the tree city. </b></p>
<p><b>Spells :<br>
  After you have hunted for a while and you have sold the loot you collected it 
  is time to buy a couple new spells. I recommend as your first spells ...burst 
  of flame or Burst of fire . Second being Snare , which at lvl 26 is still my 
  favorite spell and stays in a spell slot.As a young druid the spell grasping 
  roots may come in handy , but after leaving the newbie grounds it becomes useless.</b></p>
<p><b> Burst of Flame / Burst of Fire :<br>
  DD spell for 5 damage (if i remember correctly) </b></p>
<p><b>Snare : <br>
  Slows the creature down and is used for kiting.</b></p>
<p><b> I have found a wonderful site just for druids on EQ. It contains a lot 
  of imformation and may be more of a help than what i have given here..The url 
  is : <a href="http://www.eqdruids.com">Http://www.eqdruids.com</a></b></p>
