   <TD ROWSPAN=1 COLSPAN=96 HEIGHT=1970 WIDTH=480  VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"  COLOR=#ffffff>I Have Had It<BR><BR>Well, they have finally gone and done it. I have run the race and finished the journey. I have been promised the
reward of raw power for my constant persecution and just as I had it in my grip they come and take it from me. As you can see I am a little upset at the recent changes made by the all powerful Verant staff. Instead of focusing on various bugs that have
been in the game since day one, they choose to continue to increase the power of the NPC's and weaken the players. I feel that they have finally gone overboard and as 3500 of our fellow players showed them by quitting, Verant hopefully will see it too.
This has gotten out of control, the game started in beta as a "players" game. We, the players, were the most important thing. They needed our money, they needed us to support them, so they made a game that we could have some<BR>success and enjoy. Then we
started to really succeed and it was like we had insulted them. Verant has taken on the role of an adversary. When the players enjoy some success they make it harder. The logic I guess is to challenge us so we don't get bored and leave the game. What it
has done in reality is given high level players no reasonable challenges (ones that they have any chance of survival) so they quit anyway. <BR><BR>Why did they put the Plane of Fear, Nafagen and Lady Vox in the game? To stand and look pretty? I am
beginning to think so because as soon as a reasonable size group, from what I have read about 40 players, took down Lady Vox she was raised in level and power. So much so that last night, 65 level 45+ players gathered to try and slay the dragon. The
group was wiped out in less than 75 seconds from the time the dragon appeared. Is this reasonable? The zone was so lagged with 65 players that it was nearly impossible to play. That rules out more players as the answer. The solution is to have Verant
better tune this NPC so that we have the opportunity to win. Of all the casters in the group,<BR>many level 50, no one was able to get a spell to stick on Vox, a 100% resist rate, this is ludicrous. Challenges are just that , a challenge they are not
suicide. The Plane of Fear NPC's are so aggressive that 30 level 46+ members are wiped as soon as they arrive. We need challenges not invitations to death. <BR><BR>As I mentioned earlier, I was looking forward to the reward I was promised since I started
my necromancer, a tremendous pet at levels 39, 44 and 49 and as soon as I get them they weaken them. They weaken them because a level 44 pet could kill a level 50 melee class. I have news for them, a level 44 NPC could take down a level 50 warrior solo
anywhere in the game. the problem isn't the pet being too strong, it is the melee classes being too weak. The answer is to fix the problem<BR>with the melee classes, it is not to weaken the player. We have dealt with the hardships, give us the rewards. I
am really unhappy with the pet changes.<BR><BR>I also am seeing a pattern of deception from Verant and lack of interest in the players feelings and concerns. About a month ago they said that they were going to eliminate the Abu Kar Box. "The Box" as know
to players, is an item that loads on NPC's all over Norrath that are level 34 and greater. It has ten slots and renders all items inside it weightless and it is a lore item so you can only have one. The box is an extremely useful item, especially to
casters that have low strength. It doesn't alter player stats it just allows them to carry more in inventory. Since it doesn't effect stats it has no real effect on game play yet Verant wanted it gone. Why is a mystery but I feel like the new adversarial
nature of our relationship with Verant makes them want to remove truly useful<BR>items. *Editors note - since publishing this I have spoken to Verant and they say that "the box" allows us to carry more loot from dungeons and such thus causing to much
money to enter the game, they feel like this will cause the economy to get out of whack* The players went ballistic, thousands of petitions, feedbacks and posts on various message boards. Verant at the time was listening to players and announced a few
days later that the item would remain. I took this as a positive sign, they heard our voice and listened to us. Now comes the deception. After telling us that we could keep it, the last patch removed it. No announcement because they knew where that would
lead to, thousands more petitions etc. In essence they lied, they told us we could keep an item and then they took it. I am sick of all the lies, they promised to fix bugs<BR>in the game, lies, they are too busy keeping the game "challenging". They come
out with this big announcement that they were testing DoT changes on the test server but that wouldn't necessarily mean they would go live, lie, they knew it was coming live they just didn't want to hear our "whining" anymore. <BR><BR>What happened to
this game being fun? What is wrong with players killing Lady Vox or slaying Nafagen? What is wrong with two full, well balanced groups being able to adventure in the Plane of Fear for a few hours if they are careful? The answer to these questions is
NOTHING! I have a little news for Verant, if they continue down this road this game is going to die as quickly as it rose. I also extend this warning, I have been through two of their games and have a lot of time and money invested in them, I won't be
purchasing Sovereign. <BR>I have seen how they treat players and I will be damned if they get another penny from me. They probably don't give two hoots in hell how any of us feel since they have already raked in a million or so a month in fees for the
last six months. All they care about is that they have our money to use to make another game that will start off player focused and then become frustrating. I wish them luck but I know that many of you that are just as frustrated as me will still be
lined up to give them more money on their next venture because you got to play.<BR><BR>Live in Death,<BR><BR>~Lotar~  </FONT></TD>
