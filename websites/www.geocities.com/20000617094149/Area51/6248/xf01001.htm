   <TD ROWSPAN=1 COLSPAN=114 HEIGHT=590 WIDTH=570  VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"  COLOR=#ffffff>~Disclaimer~<BR>I realize that in every disagreement there are two sides - two sides to every coin, as they always say.   That
person could have had a bad day, or maybe someone else could have taken something a bit too seriously, therefore only those that have offended atleast two or more people are illegible to have the DIS-honor of having their names posted here.  In other
words, I must have more than one complaint reagarding a person before I even remotely consider  adding them to the "Hit List". <BR><BR>Also, if you see your character name on this list - do not contact me, do not e-mail me to remove it, and do not get
angry at me.  I did not put you here, two or more people that YOU offended - did!  So again, do not e-mail me with complaints or vulgar statements if you see yourself here, save your breath and e-mail or talk to those that you offended.  When ALL the
parties that submitted your name, notify me and ask me to remove your name, then and ONLY then will it be removed.  If I open my mailbox to see a complaint by you because you saw your name here - not only will you STAY on this list, but then you will be
added to MY "list"...which is FAR from a good thing. ;)<BR><BR>Overall this is a Neutral site - I take no sides, but rather stand over the line with a foot on either side.  This website was created for YOU, the players, and this section was created not
only for the same reason, but to also notify/warn other players like yourself who the sharks and vultures are in EverQuest, as well as where they are and what they did/do so you can avoid them....you can thank me later. Hehe...<BR><BR>(To submit someone
for the Norrath's Most Wanted List, send an e-mail by clicking the "e-mail" link below.  Include approximate date, full character name - including last name if possible, play server, and a brief summary of the occurance/disagreement/situation which
caused you to submit this person for "The Hit List".  No need to worry - your name will be kept anonymous and confidential!)<BR>Not only is "Most Wanted" created to bring offensive players "into the light" it also applies to Guides and GMs as
well.<BR></FONT></TD>

and seduce male players into getting them powerful magic items by promising to send naked/erotic pictures of themselves via e-mail. It is unknown if they still do this, due to the fact that they are currently heavily twinked.  They were observed at 20th
level approx. 2 months ago with full rubicite armor as well as an oracle robe and a staff of writhing.  (*I was very skeptical of these complaints until I was sent various screenshots and logs*)<BR><BR>Sabrin aka Sklokor - Bertox
Server<BR>-----------<BR>This player harasses and prods lower level characters - trying to get them into duels, usually with many witnesses.  He has been known to even use OOC and Shout to try to accomplish this goal when open chat and tells seem to
fail, often using sexual and vulgar remarks.  He has also been known to follow his victims around and steal their kills.  (*I have also received screenshots of his activity*)  <BR><BR>Slaiden - Vallon Zek<BR>-------<BR>A DE Necromancer of 12-15th level.
On this Race War Server, he sits for several hours at a time in the W. Commons zone, slaughtering newbies with his pet for no other gain but to just kill.  When challenged by a player of the same level or higher, he has been known to run back into the
Nek Zone to saftey.  He is on this list for "OverKill".without purpose, since he does not loot the corpses of those his pet kills.</FONT></TD>
