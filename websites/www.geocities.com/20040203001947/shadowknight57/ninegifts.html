Completed this quest about 30 minutes ago, and here is the spoiler, in all it's badly coded up glory (too tired for anything flash). As far as I am aware, I am the first player server-wide to complete the quest! Rar!<br><br>

Here is the post I made on EqTraders:<br><br><br>



Ok here is the complete rundown of pretty much every little step involved in the quest., and notes on my findings. Might look a big nasty, but it's 6am, and I need a break:) Plus all this baking is making me damned hungry....<br><br>

My expenditures to completion equal roughly 16k, although while verifying the Champagne recipie I did go overbaord and try 2 stacks of Brut for a friend's wedding, so that's another 1200pp or so hehe<br><br>

Verifying the Ceremonial Solstice Robe was a pain because of the gemmed chain, failed 13 times at modified skill of 210.<br><br>

The pie drove me nuts all day because I knew how to make the paste, I just couldnt find the sap. Saw it on vendors all the day before, but had to spend 6 hours looking for it today.<br><br>

Total skill ups:<br><br>

1 for pottery, Smithing and Baking, so I need to update my sig again.<br><br>


And now the recipies!<br><br><br>
