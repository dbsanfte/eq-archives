<p><img src="berrypie.jpg" align="left"> I started Baking as one of my later skills because I forage a lot. For those of us that forage every time the button pops up, you will know the problem of carting around bags of fruit, vegetables and <b>ROOTS</b>. <b>ROOTS</b> are very boring. Very boring indeed. So boring in fact that I couldn’t stand the sight of them any more, and I had seen a website with information on Baking, so I went about trying to find something to use them for.</p><br>

As it turns out, you can’t bake with roots, (although you can brew with them), but there are many many uses for fruit and veg. There are masses of really interesting recipes out there, and I was soon hooked, cooking up all manner of appetising treats for myself and guildmates. It just makes you feel a whole lot better when you look into your lunch pack and see delicious Rabbit Stew, Berry Pie, Beer Braised Mammoth, and Lizard on a Stick, rather than boring old roots again.<p><br>

<p><img src="spiticon.jpg" align="left"> Baking is good for us wanderers because although you can do your baking in town at one of the static ovens <a href="oven.jpg">Pic of Oven</a>, you can also buy your own Spit for just over a gold piece, which will act like your very own portable oven. It’s a container, so you will need to make a space in your inventory for it, and it has 6 slots.</p><br>

Practically all baking can be done in the Spit, although some recipes will require that you also have a Mixing Bowl. This is also a container, with 4 slots. I keep mine in the bank, because I don’t use it very often. Mixing Bowls can either be bought from a Baking vendor, or you can get a Potter to make one for you. They cost just under 2pp from a vendor, and a Potter probably wouldn’t charge you much more than that to make one for you.<p><br>

I did my baking the quick way, buying practically everything from vendors. In this way I got my skill up to 135, after which I had to break out the Fruit. It took a couple of days, as skill doesn’t go up incredibly quickly, and I got fed up of fish. You probably will do too.<p><br>

<p><img src="cake.jpg" align="left"> After you get your skill up to 135 (or before if you want to have some fun) you can try some of the more interesting recipes that require extra utensils like pots, pie tins, skewers and the like. To avoid confusion here I will detail the mastery route first, and then I will explain how to use the fancy extras.</p><br>

<b>Just a quick note</b> about foraged food. There are many recipes that use the Fruit, Berries, Vegetables and Rabbit that you can forage. They are not, however, essential to skill up with. I suggest that you save your foraged goodies for when you know you will succeed with them, or if you are going to try your hand at Brewing. There are a lot of Brewing recipes that need foraged goods, and there are not many ways to get around the skill levels that need them. Save ‘em up!<p><br><br>

As always, NEVER stack items in the combining container, and NEVER use Summoned or Foraged water.<p>Put the ingredients into either the Spit or Oven and hit Combine. If you are successful you will have a tasty treat. If you are unsuccessful all of the items will disappear.<p><br>

See? Easy. Many fish, many batwings. And now a few notes.<p><br>

<b>*</b>For Sandwiches, most animal meats will work, but Lion Meat won’t, curiously.<p><br>

<b>*</b>Batwings can be bought from various Spell Component Vendors all over the place.<p><br>

<b>*</b>Fish can be bought at practically every dock on Norrath, or you can fish for them. Only Fresh Fish work for recipes that require fish.<p><br>

<b>*</b>Jugs of Sauces and Frosting are sold by Baking Vendors. The two that I use most are the man at the first Inn in East Commons, approaching from the West Freeport side of the zone. He’s in one of the little huts adjoining the main building of the Inn.<p>The other one is the woman in Halas in the building near the Kilt Shop. She is upstairs and sells lots of Baking goodies and many recipe books. Don’t bother buying the books, the recipes can be found on lots of websites. <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com">EQTraders</a> has a great Baking page and all of the recipes you could ever need are there.<p><br>

<b>*</b>Also, as of Feb 16 the type of egg you use to make a Clump of Dough will affect how many Clumps you receive upon a successful combine. Snake Eggs make 1 Clump, Basilisk and Cockatrice make 5, and Griffon and Aviak make 7. Woohoo!<p><br>

<b><u><font size=+1>Fancy Extras</font></u></b><p><br>

<p><img src="berrypie.jpg" align="left"> Now, I shall detail the use of fancy extras. In the table above there is the Berry Pie. This succulent delight is easy to make, but it requires two things more than the regular recipes.</p><br>

The first is the Mixing Bowl. What’s that you say? It doesn’t say you need a Mixing Bowl? True, but you do need a Clump of Dough. To make this you need to combine 1 Cup of Flour, 1 Milk, and 1 Egg of some kind in the Mixing Bowl. You can then use the resulting Clump to make something else in the Spit.<p><br>

<p><img src="pietin.jpg" align="left"> The second extra bit is the Pie Tin. You can get this from a Potter, or a Smith. You put the Pie Tin into the Spit, along with the Berries and the Clump of Dough and press combine. You will then, if you are lucky, receive a pie and you will also get you Pie Tin back. Even if you fail to make the pie you will always get your Pie Tin back. You will only lose the Pie Tin if you put the wrong items into the Spit and press combine.</p><br>

Be warned! When making things that require you to make the first part in the Mixing Bowl, and then bake the rest in the Spit, MAKE SURE that you remember to move over to the spit for the second part. I’ve lost count of the number of pie tins I’ve lost because I’ve tried to make a pie in the Mixing Bowl.<p><br>

Now that you know how to use a Pie Tin, you also know how to use Cookie Cutters, Muffin Tins, Skewers and the rest of it. They all go into the Spit along with the rest of the ingredients, and you get them back again afterwards.<p><br>
