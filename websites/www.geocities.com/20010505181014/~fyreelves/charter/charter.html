lost homelands.&nbsp; Tribe always comes first. Note - The FLEA's are a neutral-to-neutral good guild.&nbsp; We strive for balance, and aren't evil, but aren't really good either.&nbsp; While always conducting ourselves with honor, we will base our actions on how they benefit the tribe as a whole.</LI><LI>
 There are no class or race restrictions upon acceptance. Be it a lost cousin, brother, or just an adoptee, all are welcome. Character level has no bearing on admission. All characters are required, however, to come up with a story as to why they benefit the tribe (if non elves), or what their blood tie is to the fleas (if elves, including inkies.)</LI><LI>
 Secondary characters of members are usually granted automatic admission if requested. However, be prepared to come up with a story or a plausible explanation of why you are joining the family; i.e., adopted, transformed into a hideous ogre from your original elf form, etc.</LI><LI>
 A new adoptee is to be sponsored by existing full family members, with permission by an officer. You will be informed as to when you are a full family member, and are able to do this. Please don't invite people or try to sponsor them until after you're officially a full member. Multiple sponsorship recommendations will fall upon the shoulders of the senior member. Officers who wish to sponsor must consult one of the other officers before proceeding.</LI><LI>
 Adoptee sponsors are responsible for the initial introduction and education of the newcomer to our ways and beliefs, as well as our playing style and interaction with the community around us.</LI><LI> After a period of acceptable membership, the adoptee will be considered a full family member, and can then sponsor others to the family. </LI><LI> Don't kill treants or druids. (Quirky GM rule.&nbsp; Live with it…he doesn't make many of these.)</FONT></LI></UL><P ALIGN=LEFT>&nbsp;<P ALIGN=LEFT>

 Strive to help family members when they need it. Whether it is corpse recovery, teleport, or item/cash loans if appropriate.&nbsp; On the other hand, if you are in need, consider your request before making it.&nbsp; It's generally too much to ask someone to leave the plane of fear to port you to Lavastorm.</LI><LI> Conduct yourself appropriately. What you do and say directly affects the image of Fyrelake as a whole. Be honorable and be proud.&nbsp; </LI><LI>
 Give selflessly of yourself when the opportunity arises and when appropriate to do so. Buffs, teleports, heals, resurrections, etc are appreciated by anyone, more so when un-asked for. If busy hunting or otherwise occupied, politely explain why when you can and don't rise to any bait or insults tossed at you because you wouldn't leave Cazic throne room to port someone from Butcherblock to Lavastorm. This kind of thing does happen, don't let it get to you. Clerics should rarely if ever charge for a rez, but do accept donations when offered. The same rule should apply for teleports. If and when people persist in being a jerk, feel free to let them know how you feel in a non-harassing manner. 
</LI><LI> If and when disagreements between members arise, settle them privately or using an officer to mediate if necessary. Using public guild chat (or shout, /ooc, etc) to air disputes is frowned upon. If a disagreement's resolution would be good for the guild as a whole to hear, an officer will take care of it.</LI><LI>
 Be honest and fair when buying, selling, and trading. By all means attempt to get the best deal possible, but shady tactics are not acceptable. For example, selling a summoned no-rent Sword of Runes for 20 platinum.</FONT></LI><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman,Times,Times NewRoman"><LI></FONT></LI></UL><P ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" FACE="Times New Roman,Times,Times NewRoman">Hunting and Looting Practices</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#990000"

If you disagree, don't join, hunt elsewhere or in another group.</LI><LI>When hunting with exclusively (or with a majority of) guild mates, consider the need of family first over looting for 'trade value'.
</LI><LI>"Need Before Greed"… even when hunting with strangers, an act of kindness giving the loot to those who NEED it to actually USE it is a gesture most will not soon forget. What goes around comes around.</LI><LI>
 The elders generally frown upon invoking the PnP rules. It implies we are not good enough to handle our own disputes within the game, and will foster hard feelings in future encounters. Certain situations are bound to arise, and specific people we have run in to over time are also bound to cause problems in this regard. Use it sparingly in these situations, if absolutely required. Do not invoke PnP to force your way into a spawn you would like to hunt. If what you want is occupied, come back another time. Likewise, if the mob you are hunting is class-specific and you have no one of that class with you, and one comes along wanting it that is of that class, yield the camp to them or offer to share up front before any conflict arises. Again, gestures such as these are long remembered.
</LI><LI>
 Elders who possess excess equipment and who wish to pass it along to younger brethren may do so at their discretion. We will always try to be as fair as possible when considering need, but we do not want membership in the family to become a 'loot fest'. It is our hope and wish to see all of our members advance and prosper, but part of that is getting out and seeing the world, learning new places and new strategies, and above all having fun. It is part of growing up in Norrath. Excess loot should be dispensed to people who would actually use it, not sell it.
</LI><LI> Kill stealing and 'ninja looting' is not only frowned upon, but if substantiated, can be basis for immediate dismissal.</LI><LI> If you have items for trade/sale, give family member first shot at buying/trading for it.</FONT></LI></UL><P ALIGN=LEFT>&nbsp;<P ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" FACE="Times New Roman,Times,Times NewRoman">Officer and Elder Member Conduct</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#990000" FACE="Times New Roman,Times,Times NewRoman"><UL TYPE="DISC"><LI> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#990000"
