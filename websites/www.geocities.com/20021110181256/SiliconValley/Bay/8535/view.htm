<CENTER>The Shadow</CENTER>

<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER>The shadow is often the dump of unwanted and feared aspects of
life. Evil, chaos, and cruelty are mistakenly</CENTER>

<CENTER>associated with what is only the inherent darkness that each of
us carries. Great opportunity and energy lay in the</CENTER>

<CENTER>shadow. As it is developed we gain powers that most people do not
have. In increasing our awareness of the</CENTER>

<CENTER>shadow, we help balance our lives. The mystic upholds dark qualities
put down by those who have not accepted themselves totally. They fear and
condemn the spiritual aspirant for properties they have denied themselves
to let surface. These are misoneistic and underdeveloped accusations and
are the reasons for the slaughter of the native Americans, the medieval</CENTER>

<CENTER>European witches, and the feudal Japanese ninja. When a man condemns
someone he often does so subconsciously in order to hide his own faults.
Be careful who you make your enemy, for you will often see yourself looking
back at you.</CENTER>
