Yes, Friends! We now have an updates page, which means that you no longer have to wade through every page, trying to figure out what has changed since you last visited. And not only do we point out which stuff is new, we even provide a link directly to the specific page!
Oh, these modern conveniences........:)<br><hr>

<br>
22/04/01: Well, you asked for it, and now you've got it! The Alchemy guide is fully coded up and live! Aren't I good to you?:)<br><br><hr>

<br>
20/04/01: Howdy folks! For all you people out there who are asking for Alchemy, fear not! I do indeed plan to add it to the site just as soon as possible. I have never been a Shaman myself before, but the idea of Alchemy has always interested me. I will scour (um...dictionary anyone?) the available Alchemy sites in order to come up with a feasible route for you, and hopefully have the whole thing coded up within 2 or 3 weeks.<p>

Also in the future I hope to add Poison Making for you Rogues, and possibly even Tinkering, although the woefully small amount of info available on that skill may hold that one back a bit. I would dearly like to try out all three of these skills myself, but I am unfortunately away from the game right now and will be for at least another month *sniff*. But I can still live vicariously through this site for a while, so look forward to more updates within the next few weeks! (hopefully)<br><br><hr>

<br>
20/04/01: All the links back to the Main Page should now be working. Thanks for pointing that one out...*doh*. Also, a slight clarification on what constitutes a sandwich meat, added Scalers to the Smithing skill up table, and also added a note about the possible 5% chance of failure on any combine to the tips page.<br><br><hr>

<br>
20/04/01: Well folks, it's taken one heck of a lot of work to code this up by hand (I could have used an editor, but I'm picky, and also I don't actually own one...). Still, I feel that all the hard work has paid off, and the first draft is looking remarkably good.<p>
Thanks to all of you who sent me emails with feedback, and little bugs to iron out here and there, I'm on them as we speak. I shall add each of them to the updates page as I go. Thanks again for all your interest, and if you spot anything else that needs doing let me know!<br><br><hr>

<br>
20/04/01: Addition of Updates page! Hurrah!

19/04/01: Launch of Trader's Workshop - Guides to Mastery via the Everlore News Page, bless 'em:)
