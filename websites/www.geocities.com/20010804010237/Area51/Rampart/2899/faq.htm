<P><B>How Old is Capaal?</B>
<UL>About 3 years old. It originated a long time ago in about late 96 er
so.</UL>
<B>Where do yall get yer beats?</B>
<UL>Sometimes we get 'em from the non-vocal parts of songs while they're
playing the instrumental. Either this or we buy the instrumentals. This
is until I spice up ma DJ skills.</UL>
<B>What happened to the old Capaal?</B>
<UL>The first Capaal started a few years back. We had like 50+ members
but if floped because it was just a Text battling crew. I tried bringing
it back this last summer but since I had a lack of equipment to make audio,
we just waited. Now, with more technology and possibilites than ever, Capaal's
ready for the world yo! Watch for Capaal commin up soon. Were working right
now on tryin ta get on radios, and family fun day at the park yo.</UL>
<B>How do U record your audio?</B>
<UL>At first we usually just ran a beat trough the comuter, instrumized
it, ran it back to the tape deck, played it at a low volume while we use
our mike, than miz em together. But lately we usually get an instrumental
from the store, or instrumentalise some Puerto Rican rap, than stick it
in out $300 machine with the double MICs and were done.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>Update 2/22/98: Rico got a new Kareoke component that muffles the voices
in the track, but it's all good.</UL>
<B>How do ya'll find yer members?</B>
<UL>We usually run adds up in Tha Landz, er recruit boys from our school
er so.</UL>
<B>How do ya'll move around places?</B>
<UL>We use Rico's Capaal Mobile to pick up members, go eat out, chill out,
take breaks, stock up on freestyle-chips, and so on.</UL>

</OL>
<B>Why do you always mention numbers like 3, 15, and 45?</B>
<UL>First of all, one day Taino was commin up with some ideas for a phat
logo, so he drew a circle with a line going trough it like this:
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><IMG SRC="imageDCA.JPG" HEIGHT=101 WIDTH=98></CENTER>

<CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER>
As some of you might see, it's a "C" and a rather round "3" connected.
But what else does it look like? A CLOCK! It's 3:15 if you flatten out
Capaal into time-wise. 3 for the 3 styles of Rap and Hip Hop, and 15 for
the fraction of the power each horseman makes. That leaves 45 minutes left.
Now that makes it 3/4. And thats the other 3 leading members. I be the
1/4. See? Well, maybe not. But it sounds tight!</UL>
<B>What are the 3 types of rap?</B>
<UL>These are the 3 types of rap:
<UL>
<LI>
Thugstah / Gangsta: 2pac, Master P, West Side Connection, Snoop Doggy Dogg</LI>

<LI>
Cultural Hip-Hop: Black Eyes Peas, Boot Camp Click, LL Cool J, Cannabis,
DMX</LI>

<LI>
Botty S--- : Quad City DJs, 69 Boyz</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
<B>Why do ya'll choose your numbers for your jerseys?</B>
<UL>Each member is getting a number on their jersey and its for a rason:
<UL>
<LI>
Taino: #0 Why? Well first of all, if your number is "0", than you can't
steal nuttin from him. And when he stands next to me, he makes me 10 times
stronger (see? 15 -- 0 = 150). but ONLY when he's standing with us. That
means that he makes us stronger when he's wit us. I also say that it stands
for "never stops". Get it? (Where does a "0" start? End? Mmmmm...)</LI>

<LI>
Glacius: #20 or #33 Why? I don't know! All I know is that #20 is his soccer
jersey no. Theres probably a story behing it.</LI>

<LI>
Nemo: #69? Why? Well, I think it's #69. When I was up at Will's, I saw
some blue print of his gear wit 69 on it.</LI>

<LI>
Redd: #15 Why? Thats the fraction I am with the leaders. Plus the 15 lashes
of life I've lives trough.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
<B>How did Deck 13 get his name?</B>
<UL>Deck wasn't very good with commin up with a name, so he just cut his
first name down (Dereck) and took his last initial (B) and seperated the
stem (1 3).
