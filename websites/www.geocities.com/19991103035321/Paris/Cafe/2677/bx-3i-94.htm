<p><font size=5><strong>Bill Hicks will be Missed for Courageous Comic Voice</strong></font><strong><br>
</strong><em><strong>The Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel, March 4, 1994</strong></em><strong><br>
<br>
On a brisk Saturday night in December, Bill Hicks was talking hopefully about the 
future, even though he knew privately that he was dying. <br>
<br>
He was hanging out at the Comedy Corner in West Palm Beach, where Colleen 
McGarr, one of his managers, is the booking coordinator. With his legs propped on 
the rail in front of him Hicks laughed generously at a performance by Carrot Top, a 
comedian he was usually wont to malign. <br>
<br>
Hicks, stand-up comedy's rebel with a cause, was energetic and expansive that night 
as he outlined his plans. He wanted to issue a four-CD box set of his recordings, and 
he was excited about a just-completed deal to host The Counts of the Netherworld, a 
talk show for British television. <br>
<br>
Outwardly, this inspired comic masked the fact that he wouldn't live to realize either 
project. On Jan. 6, an ailing Hicks played his final show in New York. Two weeks ago 
the shocking news came that he was seriously ill. Saturday, Hicks died of pancreatic 
cancer in Little Rock, Ark., at 32. <br>
<br>
I first saw Hicks in August when he tried out new material during a 10-minute set at 
the Comedy Corner. Less than two months earlier he had learned he had cancer, but 
there was no lament in his voice. <br>
<br>
Hicks rose mightily from the sea of comic mediocrity that night. He roared at our 
cultural, religious and political hypocrisies in impassioned and ironic tones. <br>
<br>
Like a writer or painter, Hicks worked thematically, and put a high price on artistic 
integrity and individual freedom. He had the spirit of a '60s radical, and drew upon 
the unholy trilogy - sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll - for some of his funniest material. <br>
<br>
He decried our diminishing intellectual standards. He was merciless on &quot;celebrities&quot; 
like Marky Mark and Vanilla Ice. And he loathed Jay Leno for advertising junk food 
on television. <br>
<br>
&quot;Once you start hawking products, you give up all artistic integrity. End of story,&quot; 
Hicks declared. <br>
<br>
In October, Hicks did a one-hour Comedy Corner show that laid waste to religious 
fundamentalists. It was the same material that got him censored by CBS from the 
David Letterman show on Oct. 1. <br>
<br>
&quot;You know what bugs me about (abortion opponents)? If you're so pro-life - don't 
lock arms and block medical clinics. If you're pro-life, lock arms and block 
cemeteries ... <br>
<br>
&quot;I've been traveling a lot lately. I was over in Australia during Easter. It was 
interesting to note they celebrate Easter the same way we do - commemorating the 
death and resurrection of Jesus by telling our children that a giant bunny rabbit ... left 
chocolate eggs in the night. <br>
<br>
&quot;Gee, I wonder why we're messed up as a race. You know, I've read the Bible. Can't 
find the words 'bunny' or 'chocolate' in the whole book.&quot; <br>
<br>
Hicks appeared on Letterman's show 11 times on NBC, and always struggled with 
producers who wanted to make his material network friendly. It was OK'd for the 
October show on CBS, but given the hook after it was taped before an approving 
studio audience. <br>
<br>
Hicks was told he would be invited back, but he never was. What Hicks wanted most 
was for Letterman, a celebrity he respected, to explain what happened, but 
Letterman never called. <br>
<br>
On Sunday, Hicks will be among five comics up for the American Comedy Awards 
best male stand-up for 1993. The winner was selected by a popular vote on a Comedy 
Central call-in number. Carrot Top will probably win. Hicks should win, but that's 
really immaterial now. <br>
<br>
More importantly, an artist who had the power to enlighten and entertain has been 
cut off in mid-sentence. <br>
<br>
&quot;I feel like a big unknown X in this country,&quot; Hicks said a few hours before the fated 
Letterman show. &quot;I haven't done anything I want to do. I want to change the world 
and you do that by changing our perceptions.&quot; <br>
<br>
Hicks produced four CDs, Relentless and Dangerous, and the unreleased Arizona 
Bay and Rant in E Minor. He did two HBO specials, One Night Stand and 
Revelations. <br>
<br>
Hicks was a courageous and necessary voice. He will be missed. <br>
