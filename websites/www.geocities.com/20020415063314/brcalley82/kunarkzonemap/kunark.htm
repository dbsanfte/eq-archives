<font size="+3">Teshia's Kunark Zone Map</font><br><font size="+2">[last updated: May 1/00]</font><br><br>


<strong>The zone map is, for the most part, now finished.  All directional data and zones are represented accurately, correctly, and in the most readible fashion.  The only thing that may change over time is loc points.  Some of the loc points were given to me by people as they were passing through them, relaying them to me via tells and guildchat.  I will verify these over time and update them if I find them to be different but for the present you can assume this map to now be complete and distributable.  The PDF version is the smallest and easiest to print out, but it's a little hazy.  Not hazy enough to make the loc points completely unreadable but you might want to check them against a higher quality JPG version before you go trusting them.</strong><br><br>

<li>EQ Atlas, EQ'Lizer, and Allakhazam's are publishing great new information on Kunark.  They've got maps for a lot of the zones, most of which can be found on EQ Atlas.</li>
<li>Don't go to Kunark to go prancing through the tulips and check things out.  You can die in Firiona Vie VERY VERY easily if you're not mid to high level.</li>
<li>With some zones that you zone into, the way you zoned in might not always be the way you can zone back out.  Chardok is like this - sort of a tunnel I guess, where you zone in on one end and come out another.  Because you want to be damn careful not to zone in there by mistake, when you get to the entrance of Chardok, there's four archways - the entrance is through the second archway from the right and down the first tunnel on your right as you go through so don't go down there unless you plan on dying inside.  Chardok is deadly enough that two parties of level 51 characters in full plane gear could have a very rough time if they're not good players.</li>
<li>Old Sebilis and The Howling Stones require some kind of key to get into or need a rogue with a very good lockpicking skill to get into.  Who knows, maybe they're rogue only, hehe.  Also, Veeshan's Peak is a zone that require some kind of quest to be completed.  It's thought that the quest to get into Veeshan's Peak is going to be unbelievably difficult and that it will be the hardest zone Verant has ever created for EQ.  Information on the quests associated with Veeshan's Peak are already available on Alakhazam's.</li>
