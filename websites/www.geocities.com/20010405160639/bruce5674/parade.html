<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3"><em><strong><u>Physical/Mental
Characteristics:</u></strong></em><strong> Your average Dwarf is
a comparativly short being,<img src="furtog.gif" align="right"
hspace="0" width="207" height="227"></strong></font><font
color="#000000" size="3"><strong>averaging about 4 ft. tall.
While shorter than you humans, we are much stronger and somewhat
faster and more dextrous. Dwarves tend not to be well-liked by
other races, who say that we are stubborn and hard-headed. It's
just that we see no reason to ignore hundreds of years of
time-tested wisdom in some brash act. This doesn't mean that
we're lazy or listless by any means. Our strength and strong
consitutions suit us to the life of the Warrior, Cleric, Paladin,
or Rogue. While Dwarven Rogues do not suffer the persecution
normal to the profession in our city, they are also expected
never to prey on other dwarves. Dwarves of all types have a
healthy fear of true, non-clerical magic. The arcane is beyond
our knowledge and we have no desire to blow ourselves up trying
to learn about it! Our skill lies in the more physical realm.
Dwarven metalsmiths, jewelers, and stonemasons are considered to
be the finest in their professions. It is said that a
Dwarf-forged blade will keep it's edge for the lifetime of the
owner, and his children! Dwarves also fear the sea. We prefer the
world to be as unchanging as the rock that surrounds our home,
and the sea is a perfect symbol of rampant, destructive change.
In perhaps what is an unusual paradox, the Dwarves built Port
Faydwer, to the west of Kaladim, where the Butcherblocks meet the
sea.</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3"><em><strong><u>Relations
to other Races:</u></strong></em><strong> Dwarves are allies of
the Wood Elves and High Elves, as well as our cousins, the
Gnomes. Our sworn enemies are the Runny Eye Goblins, the
Crushbone Orcs, and the Ogres of Oggok, two of which have been
rampaging about the Butcherblocks recently. We are neutral
towards Humans and Barbarians, but despise Dark Elves and Trolls
almost as much as we do Ogres. We sometimes find Halflings
annoying, as they tend to pilfer our fine metalworks.</strong></font></p>

This shows the names and compositions of the various factions in
Kaladim. The &quot;improving faction&quot; note shows the
relative difficulty of improving you faction with the given
group. This takes into account faction giving enemies in the
area, as well as at what fac levels certain quests are given. </strong></font></p>
