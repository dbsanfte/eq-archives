<BR>
<B>Being Disrespectful:</B> Roleplaying evil is not an excuse to be disrespectful or harmful to other. We are all here to have fun, not cause misery to other players.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Harming others:</B> You shall not cause harm to others players. This includes those of good nature as well as evil. The only time in which you may cause direct harm to another player is in duel. Training mobs or guards onto other players is never an acceptable act, and will be dealt with strictly.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Begging:</B> Begging is for weaker races such as halflings. It is an irritation to players and thus not an acceptable practice for guild members. If you cannot survive on your own, you are not worthy to walk to path of evil.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Swindling others:</B> Swindling other players is not evil role-play, it is a practice used by the person behind the character to gain easy items or money at the expense of other real people playing the game. Most swindlers are kids who make a female paladin in hopes of convincing other players that they are good players in need. Well, we don't need this type of player.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Swearing in open channels:</B> Bad or abusive language is not allowed in open channels.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Harassing others:</B> There is no justification for doing it.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Kill Stealing:</B> We all know what it is, and we all hate it when it happens to us. Let us revel in the fact that we don't do it.
<BR>

<BR>
<B>Twinking:</B> Do so quietly. Bragging about your gear to others, is for the shallow and insecure. Bragging takes the joy and anticipation of material achievement away from other guild members that do not have the means to acquire high level items.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Be a Alternate:</B> Your guild character does not have to be your primary character. You may also have multiple characters in the guild, so long as they all subscribe to the Midnight Council's ethos.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Group with lights:</B> You are allowed to group with "good" characters. Just please do it in a RP fashion. Consider it as using others to further your growth and power. 
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Kill good NPCs:</B> You are allowed to kill any good NPC. However, if another character is in need of said good NPC for a quest or other purpose, allow them to do their thing before you slaughter that worthless goodie-goodie! <B>/grin</B>
