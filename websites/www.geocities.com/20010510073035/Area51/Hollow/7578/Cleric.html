<br>
This is the most popular class in Everquest.  Not for people trying to play them, but for people trying to group with them.  If you play a Cleric you will have lots of friends, since a Cleric is an absolute must
                    for a well balanced party.  AD&D
                    has ruined the reputation of
          Clerics.  They are such wimps in that game that
          nobody wants to play them.  This isn't true in
          Everquest.  Sure, Clerics are most important
          for their healing and curing abilities, but Clerics
          are pretty decent fighters when given the
          chance, and you don't want to go after undead
          without one around.  Clerics are able to wear
          full plate armor, giving them a level of
          protection unmatched by other spell casters. 
          Coupled with your heal spells, you should be
          able to keep from dying a lot.  One thing you
          should know is that Clerics are constantly in
          need of money, because they have to buy both
          spells and heavy armor.  This is a class for the
          person who likes to socialize and wants to be
          welcomed wherever he goes. <p>
