<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3"><strong>The
Butcherblock Mountains are a good place for a young Dwarf to
hunt. With everything from Decaying Skeletons and Goblin Whelps
up to the feared Undead King, <img src="boat.gif" align="right"
hspace="0" width="276" height="198"></strong></font><font
color="#000000" size="3"><strong>you can find plenty of treasure
and other items. Walking out from the entrance to Kaladim, you
will see two paths, one heading to the left, and one heading to
the right. The left hand path takes you towards the crossroads,
where the roads to the Greater Faydark (left at crossroads) and
Dagnor's Cauldron (right at crossroads) meet. The other path in
front of Kaladim leads to Port Faydwer, where a traveler can
catch a boat to Antonica. Beware though, as aqua goblins often
try to crash the gates. There's rumors of an aqua goblin warrior
by the name of Glubbsink in this area.<img src="gobcamp.gif"

color="#000000" size="3"><strong> He's reputed to carry a rare
weapon. In the plains surrounding this area, you can find various
goblins, large insects, and sometimes weaker skeletons. Just the
perfect place for a new warrior to sharpen his or her skills!
There's also reputed to be a hidden, undead-infested pass in this
area that will lead a person to the crossroads area. The area
near the cossroads is very interesting. There's many more
powerful monsters here, ranging from large snakes up to basilisks
and the occasional ogre. The large spiders are my particular
favorite. A popular person can sell one spider silk for a gold or
more, and the <img src="goblin.gif" align="right" hspace="0"
width="182" height="209"></strong></font><font color="#000000"
size="3"><strong>spiders will often have 2 silks on them. A tidy
profit from one kill. As you head towards the Greater Faydark
from the crossroads, you will pass several excellent areas to
hunt, all off to the left side of the road. You will pass a camp
of the Butcherblock Bandits first. Be careful of these
miscreants. They have no probelm with waylaying travelers for
their gold. There are several goblin camps in this area too, with
everything from whelps to goblin wizards (VERY DANGEROUS)
appearing. There's also the famed Chessboard. This is one of the
most popular hunting areas on Faydwer. It's excellent expirience
for mid-level warriors, but the only loot of consequence is the
Blackened Iron Crown reputed to be carried by a rare Undead King.
Besides the king, you will find Undead Rooks, Knight, Bishops,
and Pawns. Most carry bone chips, but some are armed with
low-quality weapons. Beware the necromantic abilities of the
Undead Knights and Bishops! Occasionally while wandering in this
area, you may come upon two ogres: Corflunk and Zarchoomi. They
have been rampaging through this area for a while now, and Byzar
Bloodforge is offering a bounty on both their heads. Corflunk is
reputed to be a fairly powerful warrior, while Zarchoomi has been
observed casting shamanic spells. Beware!</strong></font></p>
