Momentarily<br>
Time: Somewhere between the 24th & 25th of December (Timezone)<br>
Currently Listening: Simon by Lifehouse<br>
Thinking: Change layout of my other sites, my Dad, exams<br>
Wishing: CD's of my favorite artists!<br>
Where: Cybercafe<br>
Mood: Pretty much inspired... most of the time!<br>
Likes: My pink room... just loaded of my stuff!<br>
Last person talked to: My little brother! ^^<br><br>

To All My Friends!<br><br>

Hope I got in your mailboxes in the nick of time! That's because this Christmas, I want to surprise you all and to let you know that I remember you! *glomps* Didn't you ever notice how much I miss you? *laughs then glomps at you* Here's the mind boggling thought why I asked some of you for your e-mail addresses and for some whom I promised for my Christmas gift! *glomps* See?? Just like I pormised.<br><br>

But wait! I'm not leaving you all empty handed.. of course no! *glomps* Since I feel inspired and a bit creative, I figured to sent you two my poems, which I made for the last month and a week ago, namely: <a href="poetry1.html" onClick="MyWindow=window.open('poetry1.html','MyWindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=auto,resizable=no,width=350,height=450'); return false;"> GLIMPSES</a> (poem made for you) and <a href="poetry2.html" onClick="MyWindow=window.open('poetry2.html','MyWindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=auto,resizable=no,width=350,height=450'); return false;">MY MAIDEN</a> (poem I made for Francesca) in a homepage form like now!!! ^^ And a sort like <a href="gift.html" onClick="MyWindow=window.open('gift.html','MyWindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=auto,resizable=no,width=350,height=450'); return false;">Christmas Card</a> I made from scratch and hints of using different bruihes. *laughs* Hope these would somehow make your day! And to Francesca (who??).<br><br>

You know, I want to let you all hear the song, <i>Caught In The Sun</i> by Course of Nature. It's a real cute-alternative-love song, which I fell in love listening during my vacant-inspired  time. But since I can't find an MP3 during my surf, I figured to send you the entire <a href="lyrics.html" onClick="MyWindow=window.open('lyrics.html','MyWindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=auto,resizable=no,width=350,height=450'); return false;"> lyrics</a> instead. The message itself is somewhat similar to what I want to say... *laughs* And for those who are fans of our Kitchie Nadal's OPM <a href="lyrics1.html" onClick="MyWindow=window.open('lyrics1.html','MyWindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=auto,resizable=no,width=350,height=450'); return false;">Wag Na Wag Mo Sasabihin</a>. *dreams* Cheers!<br><br>

Er.. What else... *Tries to rummage on her stuff and pop-out with a piece paper on her hand* Below are some of my made (text) quotes I want (again) to send to you... *laughs*<br><br>

<i>There are times I'm fallen down on my knees, times I'd rather be lonely and stay still for the rest of my life! But funny if I told you, I'm happy that part of my life I met a friend called YOU!<br><br>

Funny, I can't think of anything to say, not because I ran out of words or maybe I'm busy with something else... it's just that I prefer to sit back and think of the days having you as my friend.</i><br><br>

And what do you know? *Sees another paper lying on the floor, brushes the extra dust off and tries to read!* Someone dropped-by and asked me some questions. *Thinks for answers* Read 'em! *Hands the paper to you*<br><br>

Q: Just who is Francesca?<br>
A: Need to know? Why ask? <i>*Wherein she actually just shuns away trying to hide what she really wanted to say about Francesca*</i><br><br>

Q: Why are you inspired most the time?<br>
A: I just am. <i>*Pauses a few seconds*</i> It's what I feel. <i>*The whole crowd awes with her.. then blushes!*</i><br><br>

Q: You're not giving us the details aren't you? *Feeling a little annoyed*<br>
A: Guess I'm not... for now. <i>*Makes a grin... but actually appreciates the thought of asking her the funny-thoughtful-triggering-reminiscing questions about Francesca (who else?!)... who knows what's really on her mind! We never know...*</i><br><br>

That's all about it suppose... Hope you like my Christmas gift! Just don't forget to <a href="http://mydaughter.signmyguestbook.com" target="_blank">Sign My Guestbook</a> before you go! A Merry Christmas and a Prosperous New Year! Take Care!<br><br>

About<br>
It's simply an online Chirstmas-comic gift (Version FRANCESCA) from a girl we all know who just feels creative and inspired (definitely!!) in sending gifts to her family and friends. Done by your one and only webmistress! *laughs* Seriously, it's about that geeky girl who likes to lay back once in a while, play with bunch of colors on screen, write some of her thoughts for weeks (or months!) And... here as you can see now, her gift she made using her bare hands (and crumpling head) for you!<br><br>

From the Songs I Love<br>
"Locked inside the only place where you feel sheltered where you feel safe You lost yourself in your search to find something else to hide behind..." -Simon (Lifehouse)<br><Br> 

"Everything I know and anywhere I go It gets hard but it won't take away my love
And when the last one falls, when it's all said and done It gets hard but it won't take away my love" - Here Without You (3 Doors Down)<br><Br>

"She spends her days up in the North Park,<Br>
Watching the people as they pass.<Br>
And all she wants is just a little piece of this dream<Br>
Is that too much to ask?<Br>
With a safe home,<Br>
And a warm bed,<Br>
On a quiet little street.<Br>
All she wants is just that something to hold on to.<Br>
Thats all she needs. Yeah"<Br>
