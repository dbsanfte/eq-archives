   <TD ROWSPAN=1 COLSPAN=110 HEIGHT=230 WIDTH=550  VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Abadi MT Condensed Light"  COLOR=#ffffff>In light of the recent disappointment with the Halloween GM Events (I answered that I was "not pleased" with the outcome) it
was time I addressed this subject.<BR><BR>This problem came up early in Beta...and I have done massive amounts of investigating on what causes the crazy lag, huge data transfer rate and PL.  I already knew a lot more than the average Joe but I have
collected a lot of information, and learned quite a few things.  I talked to Sony people, Verant Staff (as well as the guy who was in charge of Internet Protocol for Verant) Southwestern Bell Wireless Technicians, and some of the technicians who run
local ISPs who happen to be drinking buddies of mine.<BR><BR>1)All servers are in a separate building in Verant offices. Each server has SEVERAL Hard Drives that are all daisy chained together to make up the world, with different zones on different HD's
(hence the LOADING, PLEASE WAIT, while zoning because you are being transferred to another HD). Ever notice that when not many people are on you zone faster? Well, when doing a quest in a specific zone - what caused all the problems when 100-200 people
where there was explained like this:  Take your computer and network it with 10 others, now lets say the users of the other 10 computers are working off your HD - see where this is leading? Multiply it times 200 and there you have it. 200 people in one
zone that are all playing off that ONE hard drive, causes the massive PL, lag and High Data Transfer Rate which in turn causes ISPs to over-flow and kick you off. Throw in the 200 players each with separate speeds and connections, so if you have a
player on a fast ISDN, of course he will tranfer and receive information MUCH faster than someone with a 56k.  If you ever played Quake 2 you will remember this one. What happens when a player logs into a session with a horribly high ping? It slows
everyone else down. Well mutilply that by 200 and there ya go. ;)<BR><BR>2) EQ Chat Server is on the East Coast. Yep, my mouth dropped when I found this out. This is a big reason for such high lag, ANYWHERE in the game. That is why sometimes your tells
and messages don't show up right after you hit "enter". It has to go from your house, to San Diego, to the East Coast, then back to San Diego, then to your house. So throw the fact that the chat servers are on the other side of the continent from the
play servers - hence high lag.<BR><BR>3) High Data Tranfer Rates and Link Death. Those of you that have ever gone LD when there is a lot of spell casting taking place in a heavily populated area (like the FP Docks) knows about this one. No matter what
people say, Link Death is 99.9% the ISP's fault. I used to go LD all the time. I called my modem technical support, got the flash for my modem and updated it. Still didn't help. I then sat there and thought about the possibilities causing this problem
and I came to one conclusion. ISP Band-width. At the time I was on MSN (HORRIBLE bandwidth). I called them and asked about the problems and of course it wasn't THEIR servers. So I pulled a few strings with some Internet tech friends that work for a local
ISP. I got MSN's band-width. My friends laughed for days when they got the stats. They said it was the lowest thing they had ever seen, and MSN's firewall is only 10k. I shopped around and talked to some Earthlink people and told them about my problem.
Hehe, they laughed too, and gave me a free month to give it a try (AWESOME tech and customer service, I love these guys), and guess what..now I only go LD about once every 6-8 hours, and if I over-flow I recover at 60%. They also gave me a un-published,
and technically abandoned local dial up number. <BR><BR>So for those that don't know and think all this is a bastardized form of Chinese, it's like this:<BR><BR>Each ISP has a Band-width, the lower the band-width, the less amount of information the
server can transfer and handle. The higher, the more the server can handle and the more data that can be sent. So when a bunch of things take place at the same time in EQ (large scale combat, quests, mutiple heavy spell casting) ISP's with low
band-widths are unable to handle all of the data and over-flow, booting you off, and sometimes even locking up your system. So with this in mind, those players with ISPs with low bandwidths are technically unable to do quests because of all the
infomation being transferred, and they go LD and get booted. I go LD at about 7000k, which is pretty good considering I used to go LD and crash at 2000k :( All in all, Link Death = ISP, and EQ' Server HD's are unable at this time to handle 150 people in
one zone smoothly, and from what I have learned, a technical solution to this is a long way away.<BR><BR>So what can we do?<BR><BR>Easy...change the quests. How? Here is what I have come up with after many cups of coffee and cigarettes as well as some of
my personal experiences while on the GM Quest Team for my Server (those were the days):<BR><BR>1) Move them. Spread them out. Make the players go to Erudin to talk to one guy, or pick something up, then make them go to Felwithe to kill the guy or
whatever it takes. First come, first serve. This will weed out your powerlevel/Quest Item Campers (Who make me gag), because only those that really want to RP will go through the trouble of doing this, while all the other twink hungry kids/unemployed
50's go back to their holes. <BR><BR>2)Make the quests more versatile. Make the "evil" guys go to random zones, waxing the hell out of people, then leaving. Don't hang around and talk trash and brag through shout. Say one thing then take off. Hit and
Run. Catch these big 45+ trash talkers and power levelers sitting outside Lower Guk and Sol B medding, staring at their book with no mana and beat the crap out of them, then zone into the dungeon or just take off. I would laugh for days if some Greater
Kobolds followed these guys through into Lavastorm after they were forced to zone. Think about it, players can zone in, attack stuff, then zone out to saftey, why can't monsters? Make one 45th level Greater Kobold with it's typical loot, make it non
aggro or even friendly (like a charm spell does), and go invis and sit and wait in Sol B and watch. When the Kobolds push everyone out, wait about 3 minutes so everyone can zone and start medding, then zone in and stomp them into the ground! Then they
would either die right there, or zone back into Sol B and get stomped by the other Kobolds still sitting at the zone. If you start to get whooped, then zone back in and take off down into the depths of Sol B, and heal up, or if you are friendly, find a
priest down there and he will heal you. Then go back and do it again! <BR>Hey lets make things better...take 3 good tactical wise guides, make 3 named Greater Kobolds with a GOOD loot and do the same thing, let everyone zone out, then you zone into
Lavastorm, roll some heads, then continue onto rampaging through the whole zone, just tearing it up! Then by the time word gets out and the 50's start showing up, it will be too late, because you all will be back in the bar drinking Vodka with the Fire
Giants and I promise you, people will walk lightly around there for a LONG time, then do it again a month later, and just keep doing it till all of the actors are dead. The good thing about this is that you can do it in any dungeon, or any zone with any
creature at ANY random time.  These "events" should be unscheduled or done "on the fly" - No leakage, no lagged zones, no upset players.  Currently the major problem is that the players are over-confident because they can always "zone out" to saftey.
<BR>There is no longer that adrenaline rush and fear factor that made EQ so enjoyable 2 months after it's release. Who said quests have to be large scale invasions, and giant RP matters? Wanna kite SG's at the S. Ro zone, then zone out when in trouble?
Sure! NP! Take 2 guides, make some named SG's with good loot, then zone into S. Ro and finish the battle! Then go back into Oasis and crush everything in there! FEAR needs to be brought back and instilled in these people, EQ has become a monotamous
affair and it shouldn't be. People say "Well thats no fair! We can't win! We have to be given a chance to win!" Let them whine. Not everything goes the way it should for the good guys....yes, the bad guys do win sometimes, that is just a fact of life,
but unfortunately the players of this game have been spoiled into thinking the opposite - it's time to end it. So what if you are level 20 hunting in Oasis and you get killed by a SG? That is the risk you take! Welcome to EQ! "Welcome to our world!" Now
you will have some incentive to play and get some levels to come back and get some "pay-back". Quests like this are very easy and quick to prepare for, therefore cutting down on leakage to the players.<BR><BR>2) Retributive Strikes by High level NPCs and
Monsters.<BR>For those that played MUDS you will know about this one...<BR>Wanna kill Vox and gank her staff? Hey fine! You better use it while you can bro because when she comes back she is going to be rather agitated! Give players about 2-3 weeks, let
them get used to the item, show it off to all their friends, and strut around like peacocks - then have a GM who was there (they are always there when things like this occur) when she went down and has a good memory, posses Lady Vox and go get her stuff
back. Have her appear right in front of them and give them the option "Tell me who has my staff or die!"<BR>Magic items in EQ are all logged and tracked in the game, but hey lets RP some...then after the scared to death level 50 warrior coughs up his
guts, kill him anyway, then use a specific guide tool and go to the person who has the staff and say "You have what is mine, where are all your friends now? Hand it over or die!?" Then when the mage hands over the staff, kill him anyway, hell Vox is
Evil! If he doesn't hand it over, then kill him, and keep hounding him in tells, and scare the dickens out of him...stand over his corpse..summon him to you and do it again. I promise you he will cough it up. I would only do this a few times, since the
players SHOULD be able to have these items for accomplishing the death of Vox (and other monsters/NPCs). Also you must be fast before word spreads or that person with the staff (just one example) will log out before you get there.  The good thing about
this is that all those people that helped take down Vox will be scared out of their gord, and it will make all the Magic Item Farmers think twice about things. Would you spend 3000 PP for an item when the original owner could come and take it back? I
didn't think so...What would you do if you were sitting medding in W. Karana at T2 and Vox showed up and wanted her staff back?  Want to kill Cazic Thule and take his robe? Well guess what bud you just upset a lot of Cazic followers, and who is to say
they won't show up at your door step one day wanting the robe back to gain favor with Thule? <BR>One time in a MUD I played heavily on, I helped kill a Red Dragon and I got a sword from it's horde, 3 weeks later of walking around with my chest puffed out
and thinking I was a "Pimp Daddy" all of a sudden one night I just appeared in the depths of a fiery dungeon staring up at a certain ANGRY Red Dragon. ;) <BR>Vox, Nafagen, Cazic-Thule and the like are some of the most powerful monsters/entities in this
game!  Why limit their powers to just one zone?  These creatures should be feared not only in their respective zones, but in all the lands of Norrath.<BR><BR>3) GMs killing their own NPCS<BR>This is apalling.  Anyone with any kind of AD&D, RPG background
knows this is a grave mistake.  As a GM/DM or game organizer you NEVER take the spotlight away from the players.  Making the bad (or good guys for evil events) invulnerable to player attack and having 150+ players stand around and watch a shouting match
with the actors fighting the other actors and save the day is truly pathetic in my point of view.  I was there when 3 Dark Elves "invaded" High Keep.  Not being able to move, not to mention being very bored with watching Carson Mcabe have an ego battle
with the dark elves, I was truly disappointed, and seriouisly considered my earlier raves about the creativity of Verant from past editorials.  Another thing that is a no-no.  I learned later that this event varied from server to server. ::sighs:: This
is another serious mistake, for this soul reason is why some servers are labelled "good" and "bad".  All Events should be the same on all servers, same loot, same actors, same storyline.  If there isn't enough capable people to run it, then you find
people who are, which touches on the need for a team of GMs that solely run large scale events, who travel from server to server.  This team would be your best Role Players and creative Guides from each server, who are nominated not only by their Seniors
but their fellow guides as well.  The importance of the player MUST be maintained and seen-to.  I want to play, if I wanted to watch a movie I wouldn't be playing, but sitting in a theatre with my large buttered popcorn and Dr. Pepper, spending my money
elsewhere.<BR><BR>4)Difficulty of NPCs<BR>UNREAL!  There is NO reason for this "over-buffing".  No reason at all.  When you do this you limit your participants.  Recently unless you were 45+ you don't stand a chance in these large scale events.  I saw a
Tier'dal Elite kill a full party of 35's and only lose barely 1/4th of it's hit points, most of the players died from a 50 point damage shield...there is no reason for this.  I heard that 3 Dark Elves invaded High Pass on another server, in the process
killing dozens of 25-39th level players.  I am sorry, it's just a fact of checks and balances that with 8-10 30+ level casters nuking you as well as 9-10 high level tanks beating you down, you are going to lose, well recently this has not been the case.
The Events MUST be balanced considerably more.  There were also Dark Elf players participating in these events.  Would Innoruuk kill his own followers with a zone wide 1600 point nuke spell?  Well he did.  This makes no sense to me other than it is too
hard to code, technically.<BR><BR>5) GM's selecting players for loot.<BR>I do not agree with this at all but unfortunately due to all the twink hungry kids/E-bay Stockbrokers/unemployed 50's there is really no other way to do it.  I have seen these
people go and loot everything, not participating in the actual event, while all the other participants are off fighting or role playing.  I wish I had the power to call down lightning from the heavens to strike these folks dead where they stood (/kill
would do just fine as well).  I detest "ninja looters" and it is these kind of people that ruin these events for all the REAL players, who participate for the joy of fantasy and role play.  This reminds me of when I was in school: "Okay everyone, line up
for cookies and juice!  NO! Little johnny you have already been through, we must learn to share!"  with the GM being the teacher and the players being the children, but unfortunately when the great majority of players act like children, they will be
treated as such.  It was these children that caused many of the quest NPC's to be invulnerable.  The GM's really had no choice, since many players only care about "Wut lootz does it 'ave DooD!?".  They had to make themselves invulnerable just to do the
event, since many of these power gamers would have attempted to kill them before they could even role play out the story line.  This annoys the piss out of me.  What a shame.<BR><BR>6) Guides leaking quest information<BR>Fire them.  End of problem.  But
before you do you better make sure you have concrete evidence, that is HONESTLY acquired.  No GM "snooping" in tells and private conversations.  Verant is NOT the United States Government, and doing this will get them sued if they are not careful since
looking in on private conversations through any private communication over telephone lines either it be voice, fax, or typed communication without authorization is a Violation of the Privacy Act of 1954, and no matter what it may say in the disclaimer we
all "agree" to when signing on, it is not above federal law.  If they used "snooping" to fire someone for any reason, and this is found out - with a good lawyer and a lot of time, that person could very well get a lot of money in return.<BR><BR>7) Event
Storylines - Scripted Storylines<BR>I am all for storylines, but they MUST have room for individuality, playability and creativity.  The current storylines leave no room for any of this, much less interaction with others, and other options (Why should
you have to kill something all the time?).  There is NO flexibilty.  Go here, say that, do this, go here, do this, kill that, say this, go here...  This is NO fun.  Someone reading this is probably going: "How can you say this?  Have you seen the scripts
for these quests?"  The answer to this is Yes, I have, in fact I have even contributed and written a couple.  Now with some of the new quests, no I have not, but all quests created more than 3 months ago, I have read them, and even participated in many
of them as an NPC.<BR><BR>As I said the possibilities are endless for those with any hint of creativity and an open mind...if events/quests like these were implemented I would actually consider coming back to the Guide Program.<BR><BR></FONT></TD>
