It had almost been the perfect crime.
<P>
He had successfully snuck his way into the vault of the tax collector, and 
actually found riches far beyond what he had expected. He had been spotted 
leaving, but he had anticipated that, and he had enough of a head start that
his getaway seemed certain. Until his horse managed to stumble on a fallen
tree, that is. The horse's leg was clearly broken; he would not be making the
journey. The rogue had been thrown clear of the horse, but had twisted an ankle
upon crashing to the ground. So here he sat on a log, planning his next move,
waiting for the imminent sound of his pursuers. And sure enough, he heard the
sound of a horse approaching
<P>
But it wasn't the guard. It was an elven woman, riding alone. She stopped to ask
the Vah Shir what was wrong, and to his great fortune it turned out she was a 
healer. She quickly tended to his ankle, but assured him he would need a good
night's rest to let it heal further. She volunteered to take him along, as the
trip was a rather boring one when riding solo, and off they went in search of
shelter for the night.
<P>
As dark closed in, they came upon a large, majestic hall. They dismounted and
approached the estate, only to find it locked and seemingly unoccupied. 
As the cleric sighed in disappointment, the catman chuckled mischievously, and
huddled over the locked door. Click, snap, growl, clang. "Need any help over 
there?", suggested the woman. "Grr!, poke, twist, jab, punch, pound, kick, smash,
cry, twist, and... click." The door popped open, after only 35 minutes of work.
"Piece of cake!", crowed the rogue...

So the two entered the estate, looking for the occupants. But they found 
the hall empty.
It seemed a perfectly lovely, though rather quirky, place to spend a night.
They wandered the various rooms of the guild hall, puzzling over its mysteries.
The pantry door with the word "Spin" mysteriously carved into it. The bedroom 
with the golden star on the door, bearing the name "ZsaZsa". The jester's cap 
with "Nman" neatly sewn into the fabric. The ranger corpses scattering the 
hallways that noone had bothered to clean up. All in all, the place was baffling,
but oddly comforting, and they settled in for the night. The cleric wisely
keeping her distance from the rogue, of course.
<P>
The rogue slept deeply, recovering from his fall, until he woke to the sound of 
clattering. Rumbling. Shouting. Lots of it. He woke the cleric, and they crept 
downstairs to peer out the gates. And as they did, their hearts jumped into 
their throats. An army was assembled. A large one, at that. A warlord rode in
the front, wielding a weapon of epic proportion, and wearing a shield crafted
from turtle shell. Whoever lived in this hall clearly had some enemies, and they
apparently planned on invading, unaware that the occupants were not at home. 
At a shout from the warlord, the beasts and soldiers of the army started to 
advance. The cleric fled upstairs looking for a hiding place, and the rogue
quietly slipped into the shadows as only a rogue can, hoping to remain unnoticed,
and dreaming of things he wished he had done in the eventuality he was noticed.
As the battle cry sounded and the army charged, he peered from his hiding place,
and what he saw and heard would be passed down through the ages in the lore of 
the bards. 
<P>
What he saw was a single warlord ride out of the stables. He stopped in front 
of the gates of the hall, raised his weapons high, and bellowed in a fierce roar,
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>"GET OFF MY LAWN!"</B></FONT>
<P>
The advancing troops where shocked by this act of lunacy, and halted momentarily.
But that moment was all it took; as they stopped, shouts rang out from all 
around the manor. Soldiers of all sorts appeared from all directions to defend
the house, and the battle began. As the rogue watched, his jaw dropped. He 
recognized various adventures that he knew only by reputation. He saw the 
paladin Wrendrak executing a FLURRY of attacks, missing every one. He saw the 
shaman Talcea repeatedly slowing the most fearsome of the enemy attackers. At one
point the enchanter Astaphas appeared to be doomed, when a massive explosion of
flames exploded from a nearby hill, obliterating the enemy just as a healing
wind blew over Astaphas from that same direction. The rogue peered to the hill,
and saw Nandian and Saela, saluting their comrades in arms. The mage Aveno was
pinned down, surrounded by enemies, but as they were about to attack, they 
suddenly seized up, and stood dumbfounded. The legendary Gadd shook his head,
and muttered, "Gimp beasts. If they can't even learn to /assist, how are they
going to even try to defeat us?" A fierce shissar didn't last long, assaulted
by Larzuk from the front, and surgically dissected by Heliox from the back.
Everywhere he looked, names and faces he had only dreamed of someday meeting, 
and possibly pickpocketing.
<P>
Unfortunately, in his excitment, he had grown sloppy. He didn't notice the 
creature until he felt its hot breath on the back of his neck. In a panic, he
ran. Through the front hall, through an arch, over a table, into a door. He 
dashed into the kitchen, only to realize he had cornered himself. In a frenzy,
he clambered for the pantry, hoping perhaps he could hide inside until help
found him. With the beast nipping at his heels, he opened the door to the pantry.
He found himself face to face with the largest ogre he had ever seen. Ogres are
large by nature, but this ogre was massive beyond anything he had ever imagined.
This ogre was so big he was on both sides of the family. The opening door 
startled the ogre, so much so that he dropped his donut. As he saw the creature 
leaping towards the pantry, his eyes widened, first in shock, then in rage. 
"You're in my house now!" he shouted, as he charged the wolf and quickly 
dispatched it. Before the rogue could catch his breath, the ogre Spin grabbed
his hand and led him back to the battle, pausing only to pick up the remains
of the half-eaten donut from the floor. "Three second rule...", he winked at the
rogue.
<P>
As they reached the front of the castle, the battle was winding down. The 
carnage was incredible to see. Only the enemy warlord stood, and he was 
battling fiercely with the barbarian leader, who could only be the legendary
puller of trains, Faril. As they ran towards the pair, the battle was even,
until the enemy warlord managed to land a lucky series of attacks. Faril was 
knocked backwards to the ground, and the invader lifted his sword to deliver
the killing blow.
<P>
The rogue had no time to think. He dashed forward, and as the invader's sword
descended, the rogue neatly slid his dagger between the ribs of the enemy
leader. Fatally backstabbed, the warrior crumpled to the ground, defeated. At 
the same time, he saw a healing glow surround Faril, as his cleric friend from
the night before stepped out from behind a nearby bush.
<P>
The air was still. The sounds of battle were replaced by quiet and calm. Faril
propped himself up on one elbow, and growled, "Nice save, kid. What's your name?"
The rogue replied, "Shayo. And the heals come courtesy of my friend, Ailini."
Faril raised an eyebrow at Shayo. "You wouldn't have been on my lawn, were ye?"
As Shayo stuttered for an answer, Faril winked. "I can let it slide this time.
You did good work today, and I'm going to need your help keeping things in order
around here. I'm getting too old for this shit, and someone sure needs to keep
an eye on this band of clowns. Somebody show this furball a room..."
<P>
The adventurers, in various states of disarray, slowly moved towards the hall,
ready to rest after the long battle. The quiet was broken by one young, 
unrecognized soldier. "Since we're all here anyway, you guys want to help me 
get my epic?"
<P>
The soldier was dead before he hit the ground. "Momo...", growled Winnette.
<P>
And so the battle ended. Many retired from the life of adventure after that day.
Other friends long missing slowly returned to the hall. New friends were made,
and over time the guild hall once again rang with the sounds of kinship, 
laughter, and adventure that it once had.
<P>
Arcane Asylum lived again.
