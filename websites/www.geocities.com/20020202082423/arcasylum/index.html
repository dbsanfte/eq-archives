<b>January 31, 2002</b> - <i>Zsa</i> - Another picture below for us to study to learn good form. Hey wait! That's us! This and other pictures can now be found in a photo album <A HREF="http://briefcase.yahoo.com/arcasylum">here</A>. Special thanks to Sano for these submissions.

<b>January 29, 2002</b> - <i>Gadd</i> - People are leveling and we finished a couple more epics this weekend.  Congrats to Muvanu and Caleshia.  Guess that makes 15 epics so far.
<br><br>
<b>January 21, 2002</b> - <i>Gadd</i> - Epic fever continues, Lyena gets the snake, grats.  I am not completely sure, I think that makes something like 13 epics so far this month.  I know it shattered our previous record of 8 in one month.
<br><br>
<b>January 16, 2002</b> - <i>Gadd</i> - Terrific job in ToV last night.  An amazing two bp's dropped off one mob.  Great job all on quick killing, we were pulling very deep.  Thanks Sano once again for your first class pulling.
<br><br>
<b>January 13, 2002</b> - <i>Zsa</i> - Congrats to Punks on becoming our newest leaf blower! I also updated several of the pictures in the photo album with snapshots I got at one time or another.

<b>January 12, 2002</b> - <i>Zsa</i> - Congrats to Barrius on pulling down his shaman epic! Also, thanks all for a successful Kedge. We got Omanyte 2 epic pieces, Punks his last piece, and Folok and I got our last piece for our Divine Might spell quest.
<br><br>
<b>January 7, 2002</b> - <i>Zsa</i> - The epic parade rolls on. Congrats to Winnette on getting our newest click stick, and thanks to all that contributed!

<br><br>
<b>January 6, 2002</b> - <i>Gadd</i> - Congrats to the rogues: Heliox, Katami, Snowood, and Plumps.  I think we hit a new record for the guild, 6 epics in one week.
<br><br>
<b>January 5, 2002</b> - <i>Gadd</i> - We killed Wuoshi this morning.  Almost so smooth and quick with only one death that you would almost have to forget that the attempt right before ended in Wuoshi cleaning her toes after she was done with us.
<center><a border=0 href="pictures/woushi0105.jpg"><img src="pictures/woushi0105sm.jpg" border=0></a></center>
<br><br>
<b>January 3, 2002</b> - <i>Zsa</i> - Congrats to Tssure on his stylish new bubble fists! Also, a belated congrats to Dymond on her snake stick. Since it would be a horrible faux pas to have forgotten to post this, I've concluded that I must have posted it, and some shady character removed it. We have a suspect - if anyone sees 
<A HREF="http://www.pattyanddave.com/dave/aa/pic/sano.jpg">this suspicious looking character</A>, report her immediately! Suspect is considered highly dangerous, and may be wearing a disguise.
<br><br>
<b>January 1, 2002</b> - <i>Zsa</i> - Happy New Year everyone! Congrats to Amidee and Humm on getting their epics. First Bard epic for AA!
<br><br>
<b>December 26, 2001</b> - <i>Zsa</i> - Hope everyone is having good holidays! Congrats to Winnette on a series of productive Kael raids. Don't forget to mail in armor updates for all of you getting phat lewt from these raids.
<br><br>
<b>December 20, 2001</b> - <i>Zsa</i> - The AA photo album has moved, and is now accessible from our home page. Keep the pictures coming!
<br><br>
<b>December 19, 2001</b> - <i>Zsa</i> - More armor updates. Thanks for the e-mail folks. Not gonna update this every time, just want you to know I'm trying to keep on top of this now.
<br><br>
<b>December 18, 2001</b> - <i>Zsa</i> - I believe the armor tracker is now up to date with any e-mail sent to <A HREF="mailto:arcaneequipment@yahoo.com">arcaneequipment@yahoo.com</A>. E-mail any updates, and we'll get to them ASAP.
<br><br>
<b>December 17, 2001</b> - Sorry for the delay. Congrats to Kagami for completing the monk epic, and Tcovenant for completing the druid epic. AA = many epics.
<br><br>
<b>Much time passes...</b>
<br><br>
<b>November 14, 2001</b>  - Treiz now has his water sprinkler, congrats.
<br><br>
<b>November 11, 2001</b>  - ToV went extremely well last night.  Nine pieces dropped total.  Well done all,
at times we were handling 2 at once.  Kastizi is proud of her new helm.  I am excited about the rare nature
of the female iksar custom helm, perhaps for different reasons that Kastizi.  Take a look, and see if you are 
glad there aren't a bunch of these running around too. (Click for a larger view, if you dare.)

<br><br>
<b>November 7, 2001</b>  - We finished up Spin's pig poker, congrats.
<br><br>
<b>November 5, 2001</b>  - AA did their first Halls of Testing raid in ToV.  I am proud to say that
you guys did very well, I hope to get back in there soon. 
<br><br>
<b>October 29, 2001</b>  - Got a little behind, congrats to both Casidy and to Kronill on their epics.  Almost got
Spin's, but was foiled by a bad gate and a despawn.
<br><br>
<b>October 26, 2001</b>  - Congrats to Kitaro on the bubble fists of fury.
<br><br>
<b>October 19, 2001</b>  - <i>Gadd</i> - Congrats to Teaira and Cvas for their epics.  Keep up the 
good work.
<br><br>
<b>October 12, 2001</b>  - <i>Gadd</i> - Congrats Doctah on your epic, well done.
<br><br>
