<b>November 14, 2001</b>  - Treiz now has his water sprinkler, congrats.
<br><br>
<b>November 11, 2001</b>  - ToV went extremely well last night.  Nine pieces dropped total.  Well done all,
at times we were handling 2 at once.  Kastizi is proud of her new helm.  I am excited about the rare nature
of the female iksar custom helm, perhaps for different reasons that Kastizi.  Take a look, and see if you are 
glad there aren't a bunch of these running around too. (Click for a larger view, if you dare.)

<b>September 11, 2001 Breaking News</b> - <i>Aenene</i> - In our times of crisis, I would like to send out my deepest prayers to all who are in the East coast and who have loved ones who may be affected by this cowardly attack on the US. I hope that everyone comes out ok from this. My you all have loved ones that remain safe. I will create a message board thread about it with links to news sites and such so that if you feel the need to vent or talk about it, you will be able to talk and let us know if you are ok. This doesnt pertain to EQ, but i feel that this is much more important news than anything tht can happen in EQ because these are real lives. <br><br>
<b>September 10</b>  - <i>Gadd</i> - At this time, we will no longer be activily inviting people into the guild.  There are
still a handful of people that are being considered and we will finish the decision on these people.  There are also
many that haven't made it out to the roster, please do so.  This helps us see the break down of the guild and see
if we need an specific class.
<br><br>
<b>September 8, 2001</b> - <i>Aenene</i> - AA had a fantastic day in Fear. Took down all three mini bosses: Terror, Dread and Fright and took down the Broken/Enraged Golem for the Wizzy epic. Congrats Nandian who is almost done with the first AA wizzy epic! Congrats to everyone who won big and even you you didnt win anything, AA accomplished a huge step as we contiune to be able to kill harder and harder stuff as a guild.
<br><br>
<b>September 6, 2001</b> - <i>Aenene</i> - Dont forget to update the armor tracker if you have gotten any new drops from the Planes and Velious. Keep this updated to about yourself as much as you can so that we as a guild can help you more.
<br><br>
<b>September 5, 2001</b> - <i>Aenene</i> - In all of his selflessness, Gadd did not mention that he himself obtained his epic after the chardok raid. Congrats Gadd! Now you can creep out all the girls when your snake looks at them=P Kael went well with only a few set backs and there were a few nice drops too. 
<br><br>
<b>September 4, 2001</b> - <i>Aenene</i> - AA did a Fantastic 2 days of raiding! After helping kill Sir Lucan in WFP, AA assembled in great mass and swiftness in KC for VS Remains. These both went very smoothly and were a great accomplishment. Others also went to help Thundor in WC. After KC a few groups assembled to try to get Jade Reavers from CoM but the Reavers were being stingy that night. Another raid to KC proved the power that AA has and that AA has the ability to wipe the floor with the big mobs for epic pieces. Be proud AA! As we grow in size, we are also growing in knowledge and power.
<br><br>
<b>September 3, 2001 </b> - <i>Gadd</i> - 
<A HREF="http://www.pattyanddave.com/dave/aa"><i>Overheard at the Marketplace</i></a> is hot off the press.  
Hopefully this will become a regular edition and give us something to read when we are not able to get on. 
Thank you Zsazsa.
