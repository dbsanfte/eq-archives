Haste Calculations</H1>

<h2>Why</h2>
There have been so many conflicting reports over haste numbers...even from folks who claim to use the same approach...that I decided to do my own.  I have no intention of ramming these numbers down anyone's throat; the main purpose is my personal satisfaction.  If you find them useful, that's great.

<H2>
Methodology</H2>
Haste effects were measured by timing 100 swings of a weapon. Swings were
counted by watching the flash of the Melee button: a stopwatch was started
on a flash and stopped 100 flashes later.  This test was performed
on the weapon once without the haste item and once with the item. 
The results were compared to determine the percentage speed increase due
to the haste effect.  Most tests were repeated several times and the
numbers averaged.

<P>The nominal delay (that listed on the property page for the weapon)
was not considered in the calculation.  System- and operator-induced
timing variances can cause the weapon to behave differently than this nominal
value.  In fact, if you look at the timing of unhasted weapons in
the raw data below, you will see that my system seems to impose roughly
one tenth of a second additional delay on each swing of a weapon.

<P>A relatively slow weapon was used.  This minimizes small differences
in pressing the stopwatch button; fractions of a second are much lower
percentage variations on slow weapons than on fast weapons.  My standard
for testing is now the Jarsath Battle Sword (Delay = 45) as opposed to
the previous Rusty Two-hander.  I simply got tired of devoting a bank
slot to a rusty weapon! :-)

<P>The haste effect is expressed in two ways below.  These approaches
are complementary expressions, not conflicting ones.

<P><B>Delay Reduction</B> - This approach expresses the haste effect as
a percentage decrease in delay of the weapon.  For example, a haste
effect that took a Jarsath Battle Sword from Delay = 45 to Delay = 36 would
be called a 20% haste effect.  Since weapons are rated by their Delay,
this approach has the benefit of working in the terms everyone is familiar
without conversion to swings per minute:  put on a 20% haste item and
the Amygdalen Tendril goes from 25 to 20 delay.

<P><B>Swing Increase</B> - This approach expresses the haste effect as
a percentage increase in the number of swings of a weapon per unit of time. 
For example, a haste effect that allowed you to swing a Jarsath Battle
sword 15 times per minute instead of the normal 13 1/3, would be a 12.5%
haste effect.  This approach has the benefit of making it easy to
consider damage output: put on a 20% haste item and you'll do 20% more
damage per minute.

<P>Note that the Swing Increase expressions is <I>not</I> tested by measuring
how many swings can be accomplished in a given unit of time.  Since
there is no way to measure fractions of swings, that type of measurement
would have extremely large error values.  Swing Increase is calculated
from the same data as Delay Reduction.

<P>The only thing to keep in mind is to make sure you define which approach
you are using when quoting haste rates.  I believe many of the arguments
over the haste effect of certain items stems from confusion over these
two approaches.
<H2>
Formulas</H2>
Delay Reduction is calculated from the following formula:
<UL>Haste Effect<SUB>dr</SUB> = 100 * (NormalTime - HastedTime) / NormalTime</UL>
Swing Increase is calculated from the following formula:
<UL>Haste Effect<SUB>si</SUB> = 100 * (NormalTime / HastedTime - 1)</UL>
Since a second is 10 haste units, the weapon delay for a hasted weapon
can be determined from the 100 swing time by:
<UL>Hasted Delay = HastedTime / 10</UL>

<H2>
Raw Data</H2>
I have included some of the data for faster weapons just for curiosity
value.

Conclusions</H2>
Calculations on haste items that are not weapons are done from the numbers
for the Jarsath Battle Sword.  All values are rounded to the nearest
0.5%.

<FONT SIZE=-1>* Since there is no way to test the Mithril Two-Handed Sword
in an unhasted mode, the numbers listed are theoretical calculations. The
first number represents the haste effect compared to the nominal unhasted
delay of 40. The second number represents the haste effect compared to
the nominal delay modified by a one-tenth of a second system delay per
swing.</FONT>
