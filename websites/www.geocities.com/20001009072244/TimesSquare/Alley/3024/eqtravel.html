<FONT SIZE=4><P>The map appearing below was taken from the official EverQuest site. Prior to release of the game, there were two land masses named Velious and Kunark which are not now part of the map. The game developer has indicated that more continents will be added as the game progresses. Consequently, it is possible that these continents may become part of Norrath at a later date. For now, I will give a brief description of the land and its inhabitants.</P><br>
<P>Odus is home to the Erudites. These are highly evolved humans, best known for their high intellect. Erudites are very well suited for the study and mastery of the arcane arts. The Erudites live in the city of Erudin. This city has a port, with free ship transportation to and from the city of Queynos.</P>
<P>To the east of Odus is the continent of Antonica. Clearly this is the largest land mass of Norrath. Antonica is inhabited by Humans, Dark Elves, Barbarians, Halflings, Trolls and Ogres.</P>
<P>Halas, the city of the Barbarians,is located in the northern lands of EverFrost. Neriak, an underground city, is surrounded by the Nektulos Forest and inhabited by the Dark Elves. Queynos, a human city is located in the western shores of central Antonica and offers ferry service to Erudin. To the east of Antonica lies Freeport, another human port city with ferry service to the continent of Faydwer. Rivervale is sandwiched between Halas and Neriak, and is the city Haflings call home. To the south of Queynos lies Oggok, the city of Ogres and on the southeastern corner of the continent lies Grobb, the Troll city. Some half elves make Queynos and Freeport their home. </P>
<P>To the east of Antonica, near the edge of the known world, lies the continent of Faydwer. This is the homeland of Dwarves, Gnomes, Woodland Elves, and High Elves. The Wood Elves live in the forest of Greater Faydark in a wondrous city named Kelethin, which was built nestled high in the crown of the forest's oldest and tallest trees. Their cousins the High Elves call Felwithe their home. It is a marble city also deep in Greater Faydark. Many half elves have chosen the elven cities of Faydwer as their home. To the south of the continent live the Dwarves in their beloved Kaladim, an underground city located in the ButcherBlock Mountains, not far from the Faydwer docks. The Gnomes have kept themselves to the southeast of the continent in the Steamfront Mountains. Their city Ak'Anon is also an underground metropolis where robotic wonders in mechanical engineering may be found.</P>
<P>As I am able to explore Norrath, I will be updating this page with more information about its flora, fauna, bestiary, civilization centers, cultures, and the interactions of its inhabitants.</P>
