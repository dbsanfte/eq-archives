<center><u>Entry 11</u> 
<p>It's a Frozen wasteland here, and me without my mittens. I'd likely lay waste to one of them heavily furred elephant thingies wandering around, but several of my fingers have fallen off and leave it to Mr. Ralph to forget the @#$%&@! glue. What was this place named again? Everfrost? Well thats idiotic. I knew that fact that moment I came to a place that never stops snowing. 
<br> Its like naming the Karana's after the God of Rain. Obvious and Pointless. 
<br> What brings myself and the bunny out this way? A few things. I call the concept itself "Frustration". <p>Firstly I just got word that my dearest Pufflovewumpkins who I have thrown myself at numerous times has agreed to marry me. Mumferd? Married? I can hear my Death march now.
<br> Secondly, I decided to take a break from showing Gnolls the burning light at the end of the tunnel (ussually its my fireballs going off anyway). Sadly a lot of my spells werent even sticking. So Id like to make a theory. Many creatures on the face of Norrath are covered in Teflon. Thankyou. <br>
Mr. Ralph is trying to expose my brain to air with a large rock, so Ill assume that was a bad joke.
<br>The only decent opinion I have concerning Everfrost...<p> the Women wear Kilts.<p>
<u>Entry 12</u>
<p>Got Bored with Freezing my little Gnomish Arse off. So I decided to catch a change in climate and take the Boat to Velious. -Remind me to Kill Mr. Ralph for not checking the weather report-. Oh well. Personally Everfrost was a lot warmer, but I suppose all is not lost. They do have bars scattered about, and what better way to keep yourself warm than kill every brain cell that could possibly register cold. Besides...The Kodiaks tend to have pelts that can keep you warm once you pull them off their freshly burning corpses. 
<p>Bought a YoYo today from a merchant. I figure being able to bonk Mr. Ralph from a distance could be a added plus.<p>
<u>Entry 13</u><p>
Found myself plastered once again at one of the bars in the Dwarf town behind the waterfall. Both the bar and the town have a name but damned if I can remember them. Having to jump THROUGH the waterfall before making your way into a FROZEN city tends to numb your mind a bit. Mr Ralph can certainly agree. His head snapped off somewhere over the first bridge. No worries though. Im sure he can be rezzed. Damned if Im going to pay 100 plat for a simple spell though. Maybe I can have him reincarnated as a bumblebee for a copper.
<p><u>Entry 14</u><p>
Imagine that. I've just found myself a new guild. Honestly the last few guilds I've been a member of were not that promising. Guild officers for some reason take it personally when their garments have been set aflame. 
<P> They call it Syrian Drauka, arse kissers of the Elder Dragon...or something like that. Frankly Im in it for the drink and women as usual. Most of the women within the guild have their redeming features. Nimulla is Blonde. Llueve is a Dark Elf (Need I say more?). And Benny has that wonderful female high pitched voice. <br> They seem to like my YoYo. Im going to have to start sleeping with my eyes open from now on.
<p>The dwarves in this Frozen city have proven quite hospitable. In fact they seem to favor drinking as much as I do. Apparently its the only thing that keeps their numbers high. Something to do with "the women looking just that much more perty". I wouldnt know though. Ever since the love of my life, Puffalump left me for a Eurudite, I have sworn off women. Never again. No sir. No ones going to break Mumferd's heart again.
<p><u>Entry 15</u>
<p>I have found my one true love. She's cute. She's sexy. And shes available (Always a plus but never a deterant)! She is a young lass within my current guild, "Arse kissers of the Elder Dragon". We all remember that. Cept Mr. Ralph who hasnt quite been himself since wandering into the ShardWurm cave down the creek.
<p>I never knew Rabbits could run that fast. Hell...I never knew the wurms could run faster.
<p>Now I wont mention the name of this fair madain. Its something I'm going to keep to myself. Oh lovely Nimulla? Will you be mine?
<b> @#$%!!! Where's the eraser on this thing?</b>
<p><u>Entry 16</u><p>
I've heard rumors that there is a hidden valley somewhere in these freezing mountains. A hidden valley where the snow has never fell. A hidden valley with plenty of new creatures to fashion into accesories for my ever growing wardrobe. I've been wearing this Snow Bunny Underwear for a few days now and Im begining to wonder by all the squishy noises if I skinned it right. Even Mr. Ralph has gotten bored with conventional uses for animal parts. He's been trying to get one of the Dwarven dentists to surgically attach a pair of walrus tusks to his smile. I must say though, at that point he would make a great ranged weapon. 
<br>Unfortunatly the first leg of our journey takes us right through the center of the Frost Giant City. It breaks my heart knowing that I would never procure enough mana in my entire lifetime that would be sufficiant enough to execute the entire town. What I wouldnt give for a "Ground Zero" spell about now.
<br>Its been slow going. I suppose all the Giant scalps hanging from my belt could be the main reason why I'm so unpopular here. 
<br>Mr. Ralph thought it might be fun to leap onto a table and make faces at a particularly ugly but massive giant. And of course I thought it might be fun to cancel his Invisibilty at that exact moment. 
<p>I would like to write more, but I need to find a bucket to carry my rabbit.
<p><u>Entry 17</u><p>
We have arrived at the "The Wakening Land".  A large Resort type area...minus the margarita glasses with the little umbrellas that I enjoy sticking up Mr. Ralph's nose. Changing into a colorful "Haw Why In?" shirt I knicked from a Vendor a few months back, my companion and I set out to discover where they might be giving Salsa lessons. 
<p>Our first major discovery...a pack of vicious Raptors. A species long since extinct from our world until Steven Speilberg recieved his Royalties check. Written in blood on the ground beneath these vicious Dinos... the words: "Ian Malcom was here".
<br>Later we ascended a tall tower built over a lake. Our hopes to find something amazing at the top were shattered when we found only a small tree. To make matters worse there wasnt much up here as far as any type of "Men's room" either. 
<br>Empty Bladders + 1 Wet Tree later, and Mr. Ralph and I were instantly transported to a completely new plane of existance. Here trees grew. Grass grew. Vines grew. Every kind of plant grew.
<br>I wish someone would tell me where I am.
<br> A nearby stallion seemed to invite an attempt to capture and tame it. Unfortunatly no one has ever bothered to mention to me that horses have Magic resistances that would rival Lord Nagafin. Mr Ralph sacrificed himself to ensure my escape. He keeps accusing me of mearly tripping him as we fled, but with the trampling he recieved I'm surprised he remembers anything at all. 
<p><u>Entry 18</u><p>
Recieved news that people are going to the moon. Not that its really news to me at all. I once sent an entire city of cat people to the moon. Blamed it on the Erudites too. Suckers.
<br>Might be worth checking out. Not right away, but soon. Some sort of dark and mystical vision I keep having tells me I will need "a 500+ memory system in order to do something a simple as smile" whatever that means. Mr. Ralph keeps looking at me like I'm a complete idiot. I'll show him who's the idiot when he turns around to find a naughty word shaved into his back. 
<br>So where from here? Well...I hear there is a job renovating an old castle within Lesser Faydark. Mr. Ralph keeps telling me he's been looking forward to something where he can use his decorative talents that I never knew he had. The last time he "decorated" something, he sparked the biggest mass suicide ever seen in the Gnomish city of Ak'anon. 
<p>Hopefully this Mayong Mistmoore fellow has a decent Life Insurance policy.
<p><u>Entry 19</u><p>
The biggest mistake anyone can ever make? Trying to take a bite out of my neck. 
Obviously someone failed to spread that information around this damn Castle Mistmoore. The bodies are piling up and I'm running out of carpets to stash them under. Mayong himself seems like a nice fellow. Although he has an annoying habit of saying "I dont drink.....wine" and then rolls around on the floor laughing til tears appear. 
<br>Renovation started in the back towards the servant quarters. Raided the Maid's room while she and the Butler were out messing around in the Boss' coffin room again. Looted through her personal things. Was shocked to find a set of undergarments with tiny little hearts all over it. Removed a few other items that might be used for BlackMail purposes should money ever be tight. 
<p>Mayong didnt seem to approve of the pink wallpaper, so we burned down the place and handed him our bill. 
<p><u>Entry 20</u><p>
I think it occured to me somewhere between the angry Merchant stares and the actual process of dumping their bodies into the river, that I am flat broke. 
You would think I would have much more will power over how I spend my cash, but unfortunatly I have this uncontrollable erge to purchase expensive stuffed animals. 
<br>Do not listen to a word Mr. Ralph says. I do not cuddle up with them at night. I mearly need them for Target Practice. Yeah...thats it.
So as anyone knows, when a powerful entity like myself requires money there is only one place to go. Back to Rathe Mountains to shake down the Hill Giants for their life savings.<br>
Unfortunatly it appears that many others have the same idea. Constantly. Round the clock. "Stab something sharp into them til they die" kinda annoying.
<br>So I came up with an alternative. I opened a bank.
<br>The problem with Giants is they keep every bit of change they loot off the people they periodically rip into quarters. Of course they have little problem
carrying around over 300 copper coins like the rest of us who have to ....crawl back to a city just to deposit it.</body> So with a bank open in their vicinity I hope the hill giants and the locals will come to me to convert their loose change.
<br>And once they get close enough, I root them, kill them, and take all they got and port to closest actual "functioning" bank.
<p>I've even got Mr. Ralph running around offering Free Checking. I'm just evil that way.
