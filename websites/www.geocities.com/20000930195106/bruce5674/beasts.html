<p><font color="#000000" size="3"><strong>The Butcherblock
Mountains is full of a variety of wildlife, ranging from insects
all the way to magic-using undead! This section details some of
the enemies and creatures you can encounter, as well as loot,
special powers, etc.</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3"><strong>These guys are the
sworn enemies of the Miner's Guild 628. They are weak foes, but
don't confuse them with the named bandits at the bandit camps,
some of whom can reach up to level 14! These are often found
running on the road between the Greater Faydark and the
Crossroads. Loot consists of a few silver and rusty daggers, as
well as Dwarf or Gnome meat (yuck). When you off one of these
guys, your faction with Miner's Guild 628 and Stormguard goes up,
but it drops with Butcherblock Bandits. Also, be advised that
these guys can sometimes backstab and will aid eachother.</strong></font></p>

color="#000000" size="3"><em><strong>Lowland Basilisk</strong></em></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3"><strong>These are moderate
level foes. They can cast an almost uninterruptable spell called
Stone Breath, which paralyzes the victim for about 10 seconds.
They can hit for up to 20 and are fairly fast runners. Loot is
sometimes a Basilisk Tongue (sells for a couple gold with good
fac), or a chunk of meat. These guys are found on the rolling
terrain between the Crossroads and the Greater Faydark. No
faction adjustment for killing.</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3"><strong>These are inoffensive
dragonspawn that roam the same area as the Basilisks. They have a
weak form of fire breath, and usually drop coins when killed. No
faction adjustment is associated with them. I once had one drop
one of the cheaper gems, but I believe it's a very rare drop.</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3"><strong>A much larger cousin of
the small bats found outside Kaladim and in the Greater Faydark,
these creatures are also much harder to kill. They hit harder
too. Sometimes they'll drop up to 4 bat wings or pieces of bat
fur. These roam the same area as the drakes and basilisks.
They're good exp for the level though. No faction adjustment.</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><strong>Another good expirience monster,
the giant scarab doesn't carry much loot, but that which it does
is good money. It carries the cracked carapace, egg sac, and
pristine carapace (extremely rare drop) No faction adjustment</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><strong>There's several subtypes of
these roaming around. The weakest are the whelps, which are level
1. They sometimes drop containers, which are great loot for the
level. The next step up is the regular gobling. these sometimes
drop containers, rusty weapons, and cloth armor, as well as
goblin war beads. They you have the warriors, who almost always
drop beads. The most powerfull form of regular goblin is the
Wizard. These guys hit hard with spells up to 8th level ability.
They often drop cloth armor. Killing these guys raises your
standing with Stormguard, Stormreapers, and Guardians of the
Vale. It also drops faction with Clan Runny Eye.</strong></font></p>

<p><img src="goblin.gif" align="right" hspace="0" width="182"

<p><font color="#000000"><strong>Bigger, meaner, bluer, and
nastier than the regular goblins, these beasts often appear near
the port. They can outswim almost anything. Their mages are just
as powerful as a regular goblin mage, but the average aqua is
much stronger than the average goblin. Their loot is similar to
that of a regular goblin, with one exception. There is a rare
spawn named aqua called Glubbsink. It is rumored that he has the
Riptide Spear, a piercing weapon capable of casting Enduring
Breath.</strong></font></p>

Elders and Krag Chicks:</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><strong>These are members of the local Aviak
tribe. The Elders can reach level 12, but the chicks are around
level 4 or 5. The Elders carry money up to several gold, as well
as the odd rusty weapon. The Chicks I've seen are all weaponless,
but hit hard for their level. From the adults you get Aviak
Talons, and from the chicks you get Chick Talons. Killing these
raises faction with Stormguard and lowers it with Krag.</strong></p>

Snakes:</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><strong>The name says it all: it's large, and
it's a snake. All you get off these guys is large snake skins,
fangs, and the occasional egg.</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong><img src="lrgspdr.gif" align="right"
hspace="0" width="284" height="155"></strong><em><strong>Large
spiders:</strong></em></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><strong>My personal favorite monster,
these guys can be gold mines. They carry up to 2 spider silks,
worth up to 2 gold each, AND sometimes spider venom glands, wich
can be worth up to 4 gold. Even at the 18th circle, I still kill
them if one wanders by. Be careful though, because the have weak
poison, plus they aid each other.</strong></font></p>

color="#000000"><em><strong>Skeletons:</strong></em></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><strong>There's several varieties of
these malnourished fellows in the Butcherblocks. There's your
level 1, inoffensive decaying skeleton, the KOS-all, aggressive
regular Skeleton (fixed spawn point), the timid dwarf skeleton,
and the weak decaying dwarf skeleton. The regular skels sometimes
carry gold and cloth armor, but the other types seem to be
limited to bone chips and rusty weapons. No faction adjustment on
any type.</strong></font></p>

color="#000000"><em><strong>Large Skunks:</strong></em></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><strong>The smell says it all. PO one of
these guys and you'll get hit by Skunk Spray, which lowers your
charisma by about 30 points. The glands themselves are often
useful and can be sold for a couple of gold each, if you don't
mind your pack smelling like a skunk for a while.</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><img src="undead.gif" align="right" hspace="0"
width="146" height="257"><em><strong>Chessboard Undead:</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><strong>The undisputed king monsters of the
Butcherblocks, these powerful undead that spawn at the Chessboard
range from about level 8 (pawns) to level 14 (the king). All
types but the pawn and rook have some form of magic power.
Knights act as Shadowknights, but Bishops and the possibly the
King cast as Necromancers. The only loot of any consequence
(besides rusty weapons) is the rare Black Iron Crown, a very
valuable piece of armor. No faction hits are associated with
these, but EVERYONE is KOS, plus they feel no remorse about
ganging up on one person. They will also attack any level, as
I've had level 8 pawns attack my level 19 warrior.</strong></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p align="left"><strong>There's a plethora of other creatures
wandering the Butcherblocks. Don't believe for a minute that this
list is anywhere near complete. I will be adding new creatures as
time permits. There's rumors of ogres and orcs also being in this
area, as well as a few other types of creatures. If you have a
screenshot or creature you wish to have included on this page,
please send me an e-mail with the picture attached in a .BMP
format.</strong></p>
