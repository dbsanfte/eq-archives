Introduction:

   Baking is isn’t the most profitable trade skill, but it one of the best role-playing trade
   skills. It enhances your character, giving him more personality. It is a great way to get
   to know people when out on a hunt they ask if you have any extra food and you pass
   over some" Smoked Wood Elf " or some " Beer Braised Mammoth" <p>
Once you have the recipe, and the ingredients, and
                               are at the cooking utensils you left click on utensil and
                               put the ingredients in the window that appears. Then
                               you press the "Combine" button at the bottom. If you
                               succeed then an item of food will be placed in you
                               inventory, if you fail then your ingredients will be lost.

                               As a young baker expect to fail a lot, but you skill will
                               increase over time. We recommend that the first thing
                               you attempt to make be " Edible Goo " or "Fish Fillets"
                               (it is one of the easiest recipes to make). These should
                               raise you skill to 10 – 20. The next thing you attempt
                               should be recipes out of either " Mixxys Delicacies 1" or
                               "Rohand’s Sea Treats", these should be sufficient to
                               get you pretty high in baking skill when you can see
                               what other cook books you can find, and start
                               experimenting. <p>
