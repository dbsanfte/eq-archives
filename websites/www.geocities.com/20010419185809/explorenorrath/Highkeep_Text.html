What else does he need? <br>[Mon Jan 01 19:35:17 2001] You say, 'What highpass hussy?'<br>[Mon Jan 01 19:35:17 2001] Carson McCabe says 'Looking for a good time, are we?

What brings you to High Hold? You do not appear to be the gambling type. Then again, you are speaking with me. That is quite a gamble in itself. I just love high rollers.
