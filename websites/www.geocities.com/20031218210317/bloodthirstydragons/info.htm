<P>Guild layout <BR>

<BR>
Woodlin VonDragon is "current" Guildleader. <BR>
<BR>
</center>
<BR>  
<BR>
Second in command officer - will act as guild leader when guild leader is unavailable. <BR>
<BR>
Advisor - Will deal with conflicts should any arise with the guildleader. will assist guildleader, second in command and officers as needed. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Officers: officers must be voted in by the existing officers. It will take all officers to agree before making a new officer. Officers will be required to have an email addresses so they can be reached if they are not online. email addresses can be confidential by the guildleader if the officer wishes not to make thier address public. <BR>
<BR>
Bad Form - If a guildmate seems to get out-of-hand in guild chat, they will be asked by an officer to "chill" if the person continues and ignores the officer, they will be removed form guild by an officer. They will be re-invited once they are calm and the issuse resolved. We will not have a public "pissing" match going on in guild chat. opinions ar one thing "pissing" matches another. Use of bad language will be acceptable in a controlled and mature manner. (you get trained to death by some jerk - you might use some choice words) If it is very offensive a officer will be talking to that person. Sexual comments - lets be mature here too. Sexual Harrassment will not be tolerated. <BR>
If you are offended by "light" sexual chat then we ask those people not to join. All members will be asked prior to joining if adult level chat is offensive to them. If it offends them they will not get the invite. 
The disease of Begging will not be tolerated. (this includes begging to be power leveled)  If you would like help getting something ask. Everyone works hard to get items, so please dont expect them to just give it away. We encourage giving and sharing, but we dont like whinners. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
RAIDS:  Officer in charge of a given raid will be in charge of posting loot rules prior to raid.
