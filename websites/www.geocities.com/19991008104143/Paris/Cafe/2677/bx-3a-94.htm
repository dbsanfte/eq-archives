<p><font size=6><strong>Prince of Darkness </strong></font><strong><br>
</strong><em><strong>The Independent, March 5, 1994</strong></em><strong><br>
<br>
Bill Hicks was one of the most provocative and independent comedians in the United 
States, but it was on the British stand-up circuit that he found his natural and most 
enthusiastic audience. <br>
<br>
Hicks made his mark in Britain in 1991 at the Edinburgh Festival where he won the 
Critics Award. He followed this up in 1992 with two sell-out tours culminating in a 
show at the Dominion Theatre in London which was broadcast by Channel 4 and 
titled Revelations. <br>
<br>
On stage Hicks was a pacing demagogue, unexpectedly shifting gear from gentle 
conversation to lurid, contorted characters such as the libidinous goat boy, from 
intimate confession to a compelling onslaught on his chosen target. Never a 
joke-teller, he generated humour with his distinctively frank take on life. &quot;You know 
what we should have done,&quot; he said. &quot;Instead of bombing the Iraqis, we should have 
embarrassed them. We should have assassinated Bush.&quot; <br>
<br>
Hicks began his comedy career at the age of 13, sneaking out to perform at 
all-comers' nights at the Comedy Workshop in Houston. In 1991 his controversial 
tour de force brought him to attention at the Just for Laughs Montreal International 
Comedy Festival. <br>
<br>
He was always outspoken but never fell into the trap of being politically correct. He 
lambasted the hypocrisies of the Gulf war, of American gun law and of the pro-life 
movement but was never afraid to expose the biological details of his own sexual 
fantasies. <br>
<br>
His reputation in the United States was confirmed last October when, after 11 
previous appearances, his act was cut after recording from The David Letterman 
Show as it purportedly touched &quot;too many hot spots&quot;. Although shaken by being 
dropped from Letterman's show, Hicks at the same time gained a new conviction in 
what he had to say. Apparently it was his jibes at pro-lifers that caused him to be 
removed from the programme: &quot;You know what bugs me about them? If you're so 
pro-life, do me a favour - don't lock arms, and block medical clinics. If you're so 
pro-life, lock arms and block cemeteries... I want to see pro-lifers at funerals opening 
caskets and shouting, 'Get out!' &quot; <br>
<br>
Hicks had endured the rigours of the relentless one-night comedy circuit with some 
support from drink, drugs and cigarettes. (He reckoned that he had performed 
around 270 nights a year for the last five years.) He became famous for his 
pro-smoking humour and even after he &quot;went clean&quot; was fervent in his advocacy of 
careful use of cannabis and magic mushrooms. <br>
<br>
Hicks trademark was his all-black wardrobe which, combined with his style of 
humour, led to him often being affectionately referred to as &quot;The Prince of 
Darkness&quot;. However, in the last year of his life, he decided to move into more 
autumnal colours. At the same time the range and vision of his comedy was 
expanding - he was increasingly concentrating on writing, screenplays and 
journalism; he recently wrote a column for Scallywag and had been offered a column 
on the American periodical the Nation. <br>
<br>
At the time of his death he was about to start a pilot for a Channel 4 series, The 
Counts of the Netherworld, which he had devised to feature himself and another US 
comedian, Fallon Woodland. The two men were to appear in retreat from the modern 
world, philosophising and fooling in an 18th-century salon. The series was to be the 
fulfilment of his ambition, an attack on what he saw as a world media conspiracy to 
produce uncontroversial television, programmes whose only function was to soften up 
the viewers in preparation for the commercials. <br>
<br>
Despite his dark, intense performance, offstage Hick's intelligence and gentleness 
earned him loyalty and respect from friends and fans alike. He often referred to 
himself as a failed rock guitarist but he recently recorded two new comedy albums 
with a musical score which he composed and played. <br>
<br>
At a meeting last November, Bill was burning with new ideas. &quot;Why do you have to 
be so angry?&quot; he was asked. &quot;This isn't anger, this is me, this is passion.&quot; His death 
from pancreatic cancer, at the age of 32, has robbed comedy of a uniquely passionate 
talent. <br>
