   <TD ROWSPAN=1 COLSPAN=96 HEIGHT=2120 WIDTH=480  VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"  COLOR=#ffffff>I may be very critical, and may talk negatively about many aspects of this game.  I may target specific problems, and even specific
people.  I may bash other  aspects like the Guide Program...I may say a lot of negative things, but I will be the first to tell you that I love this game.  If I didn't enjoy EverQuest as much as I do, I would not have dedicated a whole website to it's
players, and it's problems.  If I didn't think EverQuest was worth a damn, I wouldn't be typing this right now.   Yes, I am a critic, but this website was not created solely to degrade EverQuest in any way, it is actually the complete opposite.  I
believe in talking about problems, discussing them, bringing them out into the open,  and then resolving them.  Not only is EQ Crossfire dedicated to this purpose, but it is also dedicated to preserving this wonderful game.  I would rather  have a
website dedicated completely to the praises of Verant and EverQuest, but since Verant  and EverQuest is made up and created by human beings, this will never happen.  With that in mind...<BR>My personal opinion of Verant is generally good.  I have dealt
with them more so, and even more closely than others.  Granted I may not agree with some of the things they do, or with some of the decisions they make, but this does NOT mean in anyway that they are bad people.  Just my opinions...and you know what they
say about opinions...everyone has one. :)  What many people fail to realize is that they are human, just like you and I, and they do make mistakes, just like you and I.  I have noticed in EQ  and in real life that what people do not understand they are
quick to criticize.  This is especially true for Verant and it's staff.  Brad and company have literally pulled off a new-age act of God with their creation of this game, and unfortunately people expect them to continue with the miracles.  Some things
happen that cannot be avoided, down servers, emergency patches, failed hard drives are just a few examples.  I am sure they don't  purposely pull 5 servers down on a friday night.  I am so tired of people bashing the hell out of Verant when something, as
minor  as it may be, goes wrong, but on the other hand they are silent when everything is going right.   Overall Verant is made up of good folks working hard to make a good game.<BR><BR>Some of the GOOD things:<BR><BR>1) Graphics<BR>STUNNING!  I was and
still am utterly speechless when playing this game.  So many people take the minor things - like sunsets for example - for granted.  This is why Everfrost and Halas are my two favorite zones.  Here it is summer time, and I am playing in Everfrost and I
find myself ripping the blanket off my bed, because I am cold.  I find myself drinking a lot of coffee while in Everfrost and Halas.  This is just one example!  This is an area where Verant can not and never will go wrong.<BR><BR>2) Quests<BR>EverQUEST.  I have 13 years of AD&D experience.  13 years of creating quests for AD&D campaigns and Role Playing Game Conventions.  I know what I am talking about here.  Many of these quests are utterly brilliant.  I didn't really appreciate this aspect until I was
much higher in level, and after I did, I went back and did all the quests that I missed when I was "younger".  I have even created characters just so I could do the class specific quests.  These quests add so much flavor to this game.  This is really a
credit to Verant, that they can have such creative people in their ranks.  It's a shame not many people appreciate this.  This game would not exist without creativity.<BR><BR>3) Technology<BR>I never  appreciated this till I got professionally involved
in the game.  Now I know where my 10 dollars a month goes, and let me tell you, I don't mind at all.  I have to laugh when people go link dead and they blame it on the Verant game servers.  Once again, what people do not understand they criticize.
Granted there are some problems, but if you have ever had a flat tire on your car, then you understand how things just go bad sometimes.<BR><BR>4)Player skills and proficiencies<BR>Great idea!  Once again folks, this is an RPG.  Did you just wake up one
day, and realize that you could make a suit of banded armor?  Trade skills and abilities  are learned, and it may take a lot of time and even money  but in the end it pays off.  I don't know any doctors that graduated from high school and walked into the
operating room.  Trade skills are great, and they help to stress player evolution and role play.  You can technically survive in the game by being a merchant.  I know that many of the skills have become obsolete now, for example blacksmiths can't even
break even anymore by making banded mail because of all the bronze platemail circulating around as well as all the fine steel weapons.  I bought my first banded tunic for 35 pp, and my first Fine Steel 2 handed sword for 15 PP.  This is to be expected in
any economy, as the world grows.  On the other hand, under-cutting had a big hand in destroying the economy as fast as it did.  More on this later...overall, my hat goes off to Brad and gang for their creativity here.<BR><BR>5) Game
Mechanics<BR>Generally good.  Many of the regular game functions, like spellbooks, hotkeys, and the chat windows...etc, are great and very convenient for the players.  Of course there are some problems, but I will address those later.<BR><BR>6)
Factions<BR>Wonderful idea!  Wanna be evil, then you'll reap what you sow and vice versa for good characters.<BR><BR>7) Guilds<BR>Wow...they have a great set up, and it will only continue to get better.<BR><BR>8) PvP<BR>The good ideas keep
rolling...:::applause:: The only problem is that they should not have nerfed the damage (pets and spells) in PvP.  We should feel what the NPCs and Monsters feel when they get hit by the same lightning bolt.<BR><BR>There are many other minor ingenious
things that I am sure I have not thought of as I am writting this.<BR></FONT></TD>
