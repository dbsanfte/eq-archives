          set forth in our mission statement. We wish to invite all that seek 
          such affiliation to visit the new membres area on the forum within this 
          site.. Once done the officers of the Guild will review the application 
          and contact the applicant for interviews and discussion of any additional 
          questions that the officers have. Also the officers may request that 
          the applicant hunt with a group containing one or more of the guild 
          members to review their performance in a group setting. The officers 
          will at that time vote on the acceptability of the applicant, upon approval 
          the applicant will be placed on a 30 day probationary membership in 
          the guild. At the end of that time the new member will have his conduct 
          reviewed and upon approval will be granted full membership status. </span><br>

          Each member in good standing is expected to follow fully the ideals 
          set forth in the mission statement as displayed on the homepage of this 
          website. Each member is expected to answer all guild calls such as are 
          deemed necessary by the officers of the guild. Each member is expected 
          to post their character information on the thread listed every two weeks. 
          Each member agrees to accept the authority of all officers and obey 
          any request made by any officer. Each member understands that the officer 
          corp of The Regulators of Norrath has been carefully selected and as 
          such has full power to impart discipline and to choose and remove members 
          as the officers see fit for the good of the guild as a whole. </span><br>

          <span class="members-info">Each member may add additional characters 
          to the guild after their main character has attained the level of 20. 
          Such addition is at the discretion of the officer corp. The application 
          process is a simple request to the officer of both his current class 
          and the class of his new character. Then the request will be discussed 
          by the officers and a decision rendered. The restrictions made on such 
          additions will be 3 characters additional to an officer, and 2 characters 
          additional to any member. Any additional requests will be discussed 
          by the officer corp in each situation. </span></span><br>

          <span class="subheader_main_blue">Camping Issues</span></b> <br>
          <span class="members-info">Each member is required to follow the play 
          nice rules issued by the producers of Everquest. Such rules were implemented 
          in the guild long before they became public domain in the land. Therefore, 
          in camping situations, each member must attempt to resolve any request 
          over camping rights with equality and fairness to all groups involved. 
          Only in issues involving a rare spawn may a dispute over camping issues 
          be exempt from the rule of equal sharing of a spawn. Even in these situations, 
          all members are required to state their rights to the camp with the 
          utmost decorum. And always with the feelings of the other group in the 
          forefront of their mind. If a member is involved in a group outside 
          the guild, and issue is taken over the spawn and the spawn is common, 
          where no agreement can be reached in negotiation, then the member is 
          encouraged to leave the group and seek a group elsewhere. </span><br>
          <br>
          <span class="subheader_main_blue"><br>
          <b>Item Requests:</b></span> <br>
          <span class="members-info">Any member may formally request help in hunting 
          an item by posting such request on the website. The officers will then 
          review the request and make a time for the hunt if approved. There are 
          a few simple rules that we follow in establishing these hunts. The petitioner 
          must be present at the hunt. We will only hunt an item which is dropped 
          by a mob no more than 5 levels above the level of the requester. Any 
          other loot from the hunt belongs to the group or groups of the hunt 
          and only the item requested will be presented to the requesting member, 
          this is left to the descretion of the hunt corrdinator whomever that 
          may be. To be eligable for a hunt a member must commit to and join other 
          hunts for other members. Once an item is attained then no other may 
          be requested by that member until 3 other hunts have been accomplished. 
          Once a hunt has been started, the hunt will continue until the item 
          is attained before moving to the next hunt. We will try to schedule 
          these so that the maximum number of members may be available for the 
          hunt. The hunt date and time will be posted on the Events thread of 
          the web page for all members. The above rules apply to only items hunted 
          for an individual by formal request to the guild, they do not pertain 
          to gifts by the guild, guild member, officer or any other items which 
          are attained by being a member of the guild. </span><br>

          <br>
          <b class="subheader_main_blue">Discipline:</b> <br>
          <span class="copy_white">Fraud: <span class="members-info">Any member 
          whos is accused and confirmed of defrauding another person through trade 
          or item selling will be subject to immediate dismissal from the guild. 
          If such happens then at no time may this person again enter the guild 
          with the present character nor any other character. This is considered 
          a violation to the utmost and will be punished as such. </span><br>
          <br>
          Kill Stealing:<span class="members-info"> At no time may a member of 
          The Regulators of Norrath engage in killstealing of a mob from another 
          person. If a mob has aggroed upon another and a member intentionally 
          takes such a mob then the member will be immediately placed on probation. 
          The member must restore the item to the rightful person, if it is a 
          no drop then he must assist in a camp to retrieve another item for the 
          person. Two such intentional abuses will be cause for dismissal from 
          the guild. Loot stealing by a member of the guild will be approached 
          in the same way. Two such intentional abuses will be cause for dismissal 
          from the guild. </span><br>
          <br>
          Probation:<span class="members-info"> Any member placed on probation 
          for offenses will remain so for 30 days. At that time the officers will 
          convene and discuss the member and at that time either meet with the 
          member for consultation or remove the member from the guild. Repeated 
          offenses for the same infraction of our code will be cause for dismissal 
          from the guild without additional probationary periods. We accept that 
          all who are members of our guild are mature and understand the sensibilities 
          of society and those who cannot abide by common decency have no place 
          among our members. </span><br>
          <br>
          Missing In Action:<span class="members-info"> Any member who does not 
          post the requested character information for four weeks will be placed 
          on MIA status in the members board. Should the member not post the requested 
          information for an additional 4 weeks they shall be placed on Inactive 
          status. That member is then subject to removal from the guild by a vote 
          of the officers. </span><br>
          <br>
          Removal: <span class="members-info">Any member may request to be removed 
          from the guild for personal reasons and once the problem is resolved 
          whether internal or external will be reinstated by request of such from 
          the officers. Any member who has been removed for MIA may be reinstated 
          after requesting such from an officer and officer corp approval. Any 
          member who has been removed from the guild for any discipline infraction 
          other than those listed above at no time may be reinstated to the guild, 
          with that character nor any later character.</span></span></p>
