<!-- Begin News section here -->
<b>July 16, 2001</b> - We have a ton of new faces in the guild.  If you haven't done so yet, please get out
to the roster and add yourself.
<br><br>
<b>July 15, 2001</b> - Redline got his bubble fists, congrats.
<br><br>
<b>July 4, 2001</b> - Talcea got her epic pig poker, congrats.
<br><br>
<b>July 1, 2001</b> - Yina got her cleric stick, congrats.
<br><br>
<b>May 29, 2001</b> - Please welcome Dalmon, Lurna (bard- think I forgot to mention the 
initiate stage :P), and Vivica as full members.  New initiates are Doctah (cleric), 
Aktu (wizard - bother him after he is a full member for rides), 
Larzuk (warrior), Universal (monk), Llaily (cleric), Lugan (necro) and Tilelor (witchdoctor).
<br><br>
<b>May 17, 2001</b> - New stepchildren - Welcome our initiates - Dalmon (Warrior) and Vivica (Rogue)
<br><br>
<b>May 16, 2001</b> - We have added something to our charter and rules of conduct.  It was always kindof understood, but just wanted to spell it out specifically.  You are responsible for everything that your character does whether you are the current driver or not.  People only see your character's name and everything that you do is a reflection on our guild.  Basically, you let some friend that is also a jerk (hey, jerks have friends too) use your account and they do something that reflects on AA, it is your fault for letting that friend use your character.
<br><br>
<b>May 16, 2001</b> - No longer step-children - Please welcome our new full members: Ninjha, Ryltar, Adaldan, Toldar, Iyena, Talee, and Nasferatu.
<br><br>
<b>May 4, 2001</b> - New recruit - Adaldan, 51 warrior, please welcome our new initiate.
<br><br>
<b>May 3, 2001</b> - Kvasir has been demoted to the Arcane Council and is our newest officer.  Guess we needed some Dr00d influence.  Please welcome Iyena and Talee to our family as our newest initiates.
<br><br>
<b>May 1, 2001</b> - Hold on to your butts, 2 news items in one day.  I just added the join page too.  Hopefully I will change this to a form when I get more time, but for now this will have to do.
<br><br>
<b>May 1, 2001</b> - Finally got around to doing a link page.  If you want to add a link, send it to <a href="mailto:ArcaneAsylum@aol.com">ArcaneAsylum@aol.com</a>.  Please write a brief description, we don't want to think them up.
