<B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="stone"></A>I've read the rules and regulations, are they written in stone?</P>
</B></I></FONT><P>If by this you mean must you follow them as presented, then yes and no. Membership Rule #12 states that the spirit of the rule is what must be followed. However, if you instead mean will these rules ever change? Most likely yes. Since the EQRPA is made up of volunteers, each bringing their own unique perspectives to the group, there may be times when the majority will ask for a rule to be changed. If this change would benefit the goals of the EQRPA, they will be implemented.</P>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="whyjoin"></A>All these rules and regulations seem restrictive, why should I join?</P>
</B></I></FONT><P>If they are too restrictive to your play style, don't join. All the rules and regulations are designs to create a strong, well balanced game world for all players. For example, veteran players that start out new characters have no advantage over new players creating new characters.</P>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="server"></A>What server or servers will you be based on?</P>
</B></I></FONT><P>That decision is still be made at this time. While there are some that desire a PvP server to be used (thus allowing other players to become dangerous monsters), the majority seems to be favoring a normal server. Additionally, a new server may be coming online soon which will provide an ideal opportunity for us for getting established.</P>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="whatisamember"></A>When I join, am I joining as a player or a character?</P>
</B></I></FONT><P>You join the EQRPA as a character. You do not have to join with all your characters, but for each one that joins a background must be submitted. Characters you play that don't belong to the EQRPA are not expected to follow the Rules and Regulations. Of course, you need only one subscription to the EQRPA mailing list no matter how many member characters you have.</P>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="onotherrpgsite"></A>The character I want to have is already active on another roleplaying message board, can I still join?</P>
</B></I></FONT><P>If the other site has rules which conflict with our rules and regulations, no. Otherwise, yes. The EQRPA will actively be seeking partnerships with guilds and web sites that work on the same servers as us, expanding and linking together the scattered communities of Everquest Roleplayers. These partnerships will aid us both by combining our resources into one vast network. The EQRPA by no means wishes to micromanage a world - by having partners that manage other parts of a campaign world we can aid one another in providing a richer, more detailed, and truly dynamic world.</P>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="whysubmit"></A>Why must backgrounds be submitted?</P>
</B></I></FONT><P>There are a few reasons why a background must be submitted. Your background will be posted on this web site for others to read, allowing you do be recognized by others in the world that should. Often, details will be added to these backgrounds to note what special reputations you have developed - branded criminal, knighted, law enforcement status, and the like that may be handed out as non-treasure rewards. Your backgrounds will also be used by the staff of volunteers who coordinate world events, sponsor special events, and spend their time planning out campaigns the way a game master would in pencil-and-paper roleplaying games.</P>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="secrets"></A>I have my background, but some of it is secret - what do I do?</P>
</B></I></FONT><P>Just submit two backgrounds - one for posting for all members, and one for private use by Chroniclers.  Since we're already overburdened with campaigns, web site design, surveys, and playing Everquest we can't filter backgrounds and post them (since this may require rewriting it to makes sense).  Thus, by having you turn in two versions, we can quickly read over both then place the public one our web site for all to enjoy.</P>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="whyguilded"></A>Why must I belong to an EQRPA guild?</P>
</B></I></FONT><P>Guild membership is required so members can recognize one another in the case of duels. Two of the base guilds are not actually guilds per se, but a broad classification of non-guild EQRPA members (the "Forces of Light" and "Forces of Darkness" guilds which merely mark a player as being a good or evil player in traditional fantasy genres). A third guild, the "Chroniclers of Norrath", are a group of volunteers who help run the game and are not a guild per se either. All other guilds listed are in-game guilds created by members to flesh out an otherwise bland and stereotypical setting.</P>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="twinking"></A>What is twinking and power leveling, and why can't I do those?</P>
</B></I></FONT><P>Twinking is receiving treasures your character did not personally earn - this includes having real life friends or your other characters hand you items or money, or standing around high level characters and asking to loot their kills. Typically, twinking is done to "max out" your numbers (such as getting as much bonus to your intelligence as possible) or give your character far above normal capabilities (such as giving a full suit of plate armor to a level one character so they will be virtually immune to damage).</P>
<P>Power leveling is gaining aid from significantly higher level characters and using their aid to defeat many or mighty creatures. Typically, power leveling is done to rapidly gain experience and thus levels.</P>
<P>These activities fall under the realm of "Power Gaming". While power gaming is a perfectly legitimate hobby, it has very little to do with good roleplaying. Roleplaying is primarily about the telling of a good tale with others- experience and treasure is a reward for a good tale spun. Power gaming isn't about the story though, its primary objective is experience and treasure... the same way games like Quake reward players with deadlier guns and better armor (which are needed to defeat deadlier foes).</P>
<P>NOTE: Players who accept gifts for their in game actions are not twinking, just as a player being aided after yelling for help is not power leveling. If the player is receiving a character-to-character reward only because it is their real life friend (i.e., the friend wouldn't hand it to any other player) then it is considered twinking. If the player is attacking creatures they can't defeat, then running them over to a group of high level characters they know will help, then they are considered to be power leveling. The most important aspect when judging a situation is the intent - if the intent is to circumnavigate normal play or is done base on out-of-character relationships, then it most likely isn't permitted.</P>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="acceptduel"></A>I've read the Rules of Engagement - must I really accept any duel issued to me by fellow members?</P>
</B></I></FONT><P>Since members are required to issue duels bases on roleplaying alone (their motives, your apparent injuries, and your apparent power based on external appearance), you must accept. While this means more often than not players will be attacking lesser or equal level characters, there will be times your opponent may be significantly lower than you. Since no level restrictions are placed on duels, minimum elapsed times are used to prevent high level characters from continually slaughtering low level characters. Also, provisions are made to allow you to evade your attacker and get to a safe location. Think of other players like hill giants (or other deadly foes). Hill giants, like these players, will squash you unless you evade (zone away) from them.</P>
<P>If it's any easier, think of the roleplaying story behind the battle. <I>A young wood elf bard of meager skills is running a letter through the Commonlands when a notorious Dark Elf general spots him... the general's ability with a sword is legendary and the bard cannot hope to defeat him! Quickly the bard flees through the Kithicor Woods and down dangerous mountain passed - dodging foul undead and vile orcs, barely reaching Highkeep with the general and his troops only minutes behind! Ah, but now the bard must complete his journey to the half elf city of Qeynos. He has but two days left to deliver the letter bearing the Royal Seal of Felwithe... it is obviously urgent, but the general and his troops are now camped outside Highkeep. How will the bard ever get through? </I>Basically, in-game a level 47 Dark Elf Warrior (granted the status of General by the Chroniclers) spots a young wood elf running through the Commonlands and issues a duel - which the bard must accept. Being only level 8, the bard zones and the warrior pursues. 10 minutes later the bard reached Highkeep where the guards would kill the warrior should he enter a duel and attack again. Since the warrior was able to keep up with the bard in each zone, his pursuit was successful and he may reissue a duel... so the dark elf waits in Highpass Hold at the entrance to Highkeep... too bad the poor bard took the Chronicler's quest to deliver a letter. But then, how was he to know he was going to be drawn into such an important world event.</P>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="looting"></A>Why are such liberal looting rights granted, especially since there is no twinking and no dueling level limits?</P>
</B></I></FONT><P>Looting is still permitted as a reward for a character winning a battle (since Player-versus-Player earns no experience). Since twinking is not allowed, the treasure gained off an individual will be closely tied to their level of experience. The right to loot ANY one treasure is to avoid the commonly used loopholes of "naked hunting" and "bagging". Finally, characters are expected to stay in-character when deciding what treasure to loot. For example, a troll's background says he "likes bright shiny things that glimmer like the moon" might opt to loot a normal silver earring off a victim instead of that golden sapphire earring or Cracked Dark-wood Shield. Optionally, a barbarian warrior who "fights not for treasure, but to prove herself in battle against worthy adversaries" might opt not to loot at all! In fact, honorable or wealthy foes (those much higher level than you) might often not care about your "worthless junk" and choose not to loot either (and such behavior, which brings enjoyment to all, is of course strongly encouraged).</P>
<P>You might be wondering what the point is to fight a battle and not loot nor gain experience. Again, the emphasis of EQRPA is roleplaying... you may not have gotten treasure, but you have something for talk at the local tavern.</P>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="recognizeguild"></A>It says I must be able to recognize all guilds - why? And what if I can't possibly memorize them all?</P>
</B></I></FONT><P>You need to be able to recognize the EQRPA guilds so you can tell what characters are members. The most important area that this comes into play is for accepting duels. If we didn't have guilds in place for easy recognition, then you would have to be able to recognize members on an individual basis - a far more difficult proposition!</P>
<P>As to memorizing, you don't need to. An easy remedy is to print out a sheet listing all the EQRPA guilds and tape it to the side of your desk or monitor, shove it in a drawer, or keep it somewhere handy. Then, when issued a duel, check the guild status of the challenger and compare it to your list. If they don't belong to a guild or belong to an unlisted guild, you don't have to accept the duel.</P>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="respect"></A>What do you mean we must respect the rights of others to play their own way?</P>
</B></I></FONT><P>Common courtesy. We roleplay and expect others to let us play that way. Other players don't want to - they like endless hours of camping creatures, twinking, and power leveling. Heck, even some of us members like that (but not all the time, which is why we have member and non-member characters). It is not our place to go cramming our viewpoints down their throats, insulting the players for their play style, or do things like hinder their activities with malicious kill stealing or spamming their chat channels. Please do note, your member characters must still follow the rules and regulations even if grouped with non-members. For example, if you are in a mixed membership group and a member comes up and duels you, you must accept - even if the non-member players are saying "come on, we need you here... stop doing that silly duel and help us". When in mixed groups, explain out-of-character your responsibilities and ask them to respect them, and do your best to work around conflicts that arise. For example, if your group uses an In-Character channel constantly to talk out-of-character, don't ignore them. Merely follow rule 5 of channel etiquette.</P>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="donated"></A>Why must I hand over items I wish to destroy to the Chroniclers of Norrath?</P>
</B></I></FONT><P>Since we Chroniclers are players like yourself, we can't just summon up items into existence. Thus, we will be using these destroyed items and items surrendered during sponsored events to help fund our treasure chest. These items will be recycled and handed out as rewards or used to purchase rewards for sponsored events. For example, if your church requires a 10% tithe, that money goes to the Chroniclers' campaign treasury. It might eventually be recycled to buy a screaming mace, which is handed out as a quest reward (or might pay for the food and drink at the Freeport Midsummer Festival or buy a Shiny Brass Shield for a quest on the other side of the world).</P>
<P>However we are reasonable. If you MUST destroy an item to make room for a better treasure, and no one else there can hold extra items to give to a Chronicler, or if reasonable pick up cannot be arranged, then you may destroy it. Of course, no drop items can't be transferred and are of no use.</P>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="exploit"></A>So can I gather some friends and one by one duel a character until we strip the player of all his gear?</P>
</B></I></FONT><P>No. Remember the bit about the spirit of the rules? This type of activity goes against them - you are bending and twisting the technical definitions of the rules to circumvent their purpose. In this case, you're trying to get past the one loot item rule and the minimum duel time rule. Should a player suspect such exploitation, as with rule exploits already existing in the game (like training creatures), they can petition a Chronicler or email us directly. Those found exploiting the rules with malicious intent will be expelled from the EQRPA. Use common sense, and if you're still uncertain ask before acting - either to a Chronicler or through the mailing list (for general consensus).</P></BODY>
