The time for bickering has come to an end!<BR>It is time to unite Norath and bring her to her former glory.<BR>
We seek the comanionship of friends, and those proven themselves for our cause.  This is not the task of the faint of heart! We oppose those who would bring despair to Norath.  Any sincere individual may join our cause.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Our cause is not a light one, and thus joining our ranks requires 
knowledge, and service to those already fighting the cause.  A canadate 
must know at two members of the guild and one of the guild officers, and have been in victorious 
combat with them.  It is only then, that a request to join our ranks will 
be considered.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Our cause brings the candle of knowledge to Norath, and its inhabitants therein.  Helping 
those lesser than us, and sharing the flame so that it shall not die is 
our number on priority.  Many will die, and many will suffer, but we will 
not go in empty handed.  Sharing resources, and banding together to raid 
our items will be a frequent occurance to better further our chances of 
success for our cause.  Let not the weak of heart enter our ranks, but let 
the strong, merciful people bring back the light, and hope to all those who 
continue to find their way to Norath.<BR>

During our great battles raged on Norrath, there are certain things that we must all keep in mind:<BR>

There are two types of Raids - Ones that grant us items and ones that are for experience - both result in improving our guild and making it a greater fighting force!<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
Knowing this, we must keep in mind that:<BR>
<BR>
<table cellpadding=0 border=0>
<tr><td valign=top>1)</td><td>
In <B>Raids for Items</B> (quest,epic, equipment), experience gained is not important nor is it the goal.  Groups fighting together may all band together on single mobs in order to effectively clean out the dungeon or area!</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top>2)</td><td>
In <B>Raids for Experience</B>, all groups that are present must not camp in the same locations! We must divide our forces to provide a better coverage. Lower level players will band at the zone border - either grouping for experience or buffing and healing those who can fight!</td></tr>
