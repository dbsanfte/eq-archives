<p><font size=6><strong>A Dangerous Comic on the Cutting Edge</strong></font><strong><br>
<br>
</strong><em><strong>Just for Laughs, Spring 1992 </strong></em><strong><br>
<br>
Just when some people were expressing doubts about whether the comedy club boom 
of the '80s could be sustained, Bill Hicks has emerged to show us the future.<br>
<br>
Hicks is the kind of performer who was really needed to bring renewed attention and 
appreciation to stand-up. We took a look at him last year and were impressed but 
since then he has gotten better and better. Like a Duracell battery, he keeps going 
and going, seeming at this point unstoppable.<br>
<br>
Here is a guy that pours it on by exposing uncomfortable truths and offering 
penetrating insights while not forgetting his main job is to make audiences laugh. 
He's willing to stay out on the road 270 days a year showing audiences how much 
better the medium works in a live performance situation.<br>
<br>
All kidding aside, he may be about to become the new comedy messiah. Hicks 
demonstrates that stand-up is a unique artform in its own right. Most impressively, 
he succeeds while going completely against the grain of conventional wisdom.<br>
<br>
Take, for instance, one of his milder topics, Silence of the Lambs:<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm probably one of the only people in the world who thought that it was the comedy 
hit of the '90s. I howled. Didn't y'all think that was funny? That guy cuttin' up women 
and wearin' 'em as skin? Wearin' 'em as coats?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;When I read in the papers the ads, stuff like: 'It's so scary you'll hold your seat 
until your knuckles are white. You won't be able to sleep at night after seeing this 
film,' I said, 'that's the way I feel after I see Chevy Chase movies, you know? I pace 
the floor; I can't sleep. I'm frightened. Every one of his movies sucks. How does he 
do it? Maybe they should skin Chevy Chase and put his skin on a funny person.&quot;<br>
<br>
It takes huevos to go against doctrinaire thinking and it takes tremendous talent to 
convince the public to pay for the privilege. Hicks shows how it's done.<br>
<br>
Getting serious while not forgetting to be funny, Hicks is able to expose himself as a 
former drug user who nonetheless believes there are positive aspects to taking 
drugs.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why did I quit? Because when you've been on a UFO, it's pretty hard to top that.&quot;<br>
<br>
Off stage, he notes: &quot;You can't deny the effects ot the 60's, much of which was very 
positive, without giving credit to hallucinogenic drugs.&quot; On stage, he says: 
&quot;Musicians today who don't do drugs--boy, they suck. Suckers of Satan's cock each 
and every one of them.&quot;<br>
<br>
Simply put, he doesn't hold back, like when he indicates he collects pornography: <br>
<br>
&quot;One of my big fears in life is that I'm going to die and my parents are going to have 
to clear out my apartment and find that porno wing I've been adding on for years. 
There'll be more than one funeral that day.&quot;<br>
<br>
What makes the subject especially interesting is that he continues with a convincing 
argument that the Supreme Court's definition of pornography as products containing 
no artistic merit and causing sexual thought applies to most TV commercials.<br>
<br>
Then he brings religion into the discussion.<br>
<br>
&quot;People who are against things that cause sexual thoughts are also Christians who 
believe we should be fruitful and multiply. How do you do that and not think about 
it?&quot;<br>
<br>
Seldom content to offer only a single comment on any given matter, Hicks adds: <br>
<br>
&quot;A lot of Christians wear crosses around their necks. Do you think when Jesus 
comes back he ever wants to see a fucking cross? It's kind of like going up to Jackie 
Onassis with a rifle pendant on.&quot;<br>
<br>
During a phone interview with Hicks from Stamford, Connecticut, where he was 
playing the Treehouse Cafe, the Jackie Onassis reference prompts a discussion 
about Lenny Bruce. One of Bruce's most controversial bits concerned his feelings on 
exactly why Jackie abandoned the limo on that ill-fated day in Dallas. Surprisingly, 
Hicks is not very familiar with the man who could easily be considered the patron 
saint of what he is currently doing on stage.<br>
<br>
&quot;I never really listened to him all that much. But his myth as a comedian who spoke 
extemporaneously about things he believed in is why he's a hero to comics.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The guy who really opened doors for me was Richard Pryor. He showed me the 
body movement to back up the material and the honesty of his feelings. It showed me 
what could be done.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now 30, Hicks started performing when he was only 13 years old.<br>
<br>
&quot;When I started out, I thought Johnny Carson was the only comedian in the world. 
The one night I saw a guy on his show named Richard Lewis and realized this could 
be a career.<br>
<br>
When he was old enough, Hicks began sharpening his skills at the Comedy 
Workshop in Houston. He joined contemporaries like Sam Kinison, Ron Shock and 
Jimmy Pineapple in a creative atmosphere that is now looked back upon as a 
fountainhead of the modern Amercan comedy renaissance.<br>
<br>
&quot;We just played off each other with the objective of cracking each other up. We 
shared a philosophy that we could make some kind of difference but you've got to 
speak the truth to do that,&quot; Hicks recalls.<br>
<br>
Ironically, it may have been audiences' innocence at the time which allowed for such 
daring creativity. Fans came to the shows without preconceived notions of what to 
expect. Today's fans may be more judgmental as they have seen what types of acts 
make it big and compare their techniques to what up-and-comers are doing in the 
clubs.<br>
<br>
&quot;People used to come up after the show and say, 'how do you do that?' Now they 
come up after the show and ask 'how do you get an agent?'&quot;<br>
<br>
Fortunately, Hicks has established his style and now refuses to compromise. 
Although he has given up both drugs and alcohol, he actually questions the concept of 
clean living by offering a devastating routine in his act comparing Yul Brynner (who 
died of lung cancer) with Jim Fixx (who died while jogging). The bit makes you want 
to light up and party down.<br>
<br>
He even has the nerve to show disdain for a major show biz personality like Arsenio 
Hall (&quot;the son of Merv Griffin and Little Richard&quot;) who is obviously in a position to 
do his career a great deal of good.<br>
<br>
&quot;Everyone is doing that show. It's the most amazing thing I've ever seen. Jesus is 
gonna do that show when he comes back. 'Tonight on Arsenio: Paula Abdul, Della 
Reese and Jesus of Nazareth. Let's get busy! Jesus, tell me the truth now, Mary 
Magdalene, didja do her? Arf, arf, arf, arf.'&quot;<br>
<br>
Hicks is a regular on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman.&quot; He is also an alumus of 
what to date has been TV's best attempt at capturing the essence of live stand-up, 
HBO's &quot;One Night Stand&quot; series.<br>
<br>
Additionally, Hicks has a new tape and CD out from Invasion Records called 
&quot;Relentless&quot;. It comes with the moniker: &quot;This album contains everything your 
parents hate, the government fears and the church preaches against.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Relentless&quot; covers the above mentioned topics and more as well as a song by 
Hicks entitled, &quot;Chicks Dig Jerks.&quot; Still, one wishes that Invasion would have 
released Hicks' act verbatin instead of breaking it down into segments.<br>
<br>
Listening to a performance straight through allows one to experience the building 
intensity of Hicks' impact as he adds outrage upon outrage to his act. Breaking it 
down into segments reduces this effect. It's not like making bits shorter is going to 
result in more radio play -- not while there's an F.C.C. around to protect the public's 
sensitivities.<br>
<br>
For now, Hicks is a performer who is too hot for radio and mainstream TV. In that, he 
is a credit to the institution known as the stand-up comedy nightclub.<br>
