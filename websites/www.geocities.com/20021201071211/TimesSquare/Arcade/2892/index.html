<CENTER><FONT FACE="arial" SIZE=+3><B>What Is The M&M Guild?</B></CENTER>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800000"><H3>Philosophy:</H3></FONT>
<H4>We created a guild that was more like a club (a group of people organized for a common purpose) or a fellowship (the companionship of individuals in a congenial atmosphere and on equal terms) rather than a hierarchy.  You could say we were more like a family only led by a team rather than by a leader.

<!--<BR><BR>
The team currently consists of Macro, QuinTessAnce, Twilight, DrWho, Camile, Jhereg, Aile, and OldGoat.  However, every member of our group has an equal voice in what we do and how we do it.  </H4>-->

<FONT COLOR="#800000"><H3>Purpose:</H3></FONT>
<H4>We wanted this guild to be based on FUN -- not on service or accomplishments.  We wanted creative people who could put their heads together and come up with inventive ways to have fun in the Realm (and other games) besides combat, leveling, bartering, and such which at times can just become stale!  Perhaps story telling, comedy, games of some sort that can be hosted by our guild for all in the Realm to enjoy.  And for five good years we did just that!</H4>

<FONT COLOR="#800000"><H3>History:</H3></FONT>
<H4>The Muse & Merriment Guild  <!--was conceived by LadyCamile and Emmerald (whose personal life has taken her away from the Realm right now) and-->officially began on March 26, 1996 through the on-line game called "The Realm".  However, a number of situations arose and it is my sad duty to report that due to irreconcilable differences, the Muse & Merriment Guild officially broke up effective July 5, 2001.  

<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800000"><H3>Disclaimer:</H3></FONT>
<H4>This page remains in place to be certain that any and all visitors are aware that the one and only Muse & Merriment Guild no longer exists.  Let it be known that any organization using this name is not now nor was it ever related to the original Muse & Merriment Guild.  All prior M&Ms in good standing have joined other guilds through the game EverQuest or are presently guild-less. </H4>  

<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800000"><H3>Broken Links:</H3></FONT>
<H4>Please note that the links off this page no longer work.  This page will remain in place for as long as it is necessary to protect the previous good name of the original Muse & Merriment Guild and of its members in good standing.  </H4>

<!--We are now the oldest guild still active in The Realm.
<BR><BR>
There is yet another "record" that our Guild holds -- namely, that the M&Ms are the only guild associated with The Realm to have produced the most Implementors, Games Masters, Moderators, and Guides.   When a player accepts any of these positions, they are required to officially "retire" from any and all Guilds.   This is done in order to avoid showing favoritism.  However, many of our "retirees" still remain on our mailing lists even though they may no longer be active in the game.
<BR><BR>
We are very proud of this record.  And would like to "honor" these members with a special listing in alphabetical order:
