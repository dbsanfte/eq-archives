<body><P>Greetings brave traveller.  You are undoubtedly here to hear of my brave exploits in the world of Norrath.  
Well, I really don't have much to tell.  I am a simple Wood Elf Ranger in the service of Tunare.  
You can find me on the Karana server, but I wander the world to do good deeds wherever I go so you must track me down wherever I may be.  I am always interested in grouping up with other brave adventurers to perform heroic feats.  After any good battle, I always like to enjoy a few meads and some song and dance.<P>
Okay, back to my real life persona.  Yes, I play a Wood Elf Ranger, named Larian (are you noticing a trend here?), 
on the Karana server.  I'm usually somewhere in Eastern Antonica, but as I level up, my travels will take me further.  Just do a <B>/who larian all</B>, and you should find me.  I finally got a True Shot Longbow, and it totally kicks butt!  I'm looking forward to making it a Rain Caller bow.  
I am especially proud of the fact that i am a Master Fletcher now. If you happen to find me though, I'll be 
more than happy to help you out in any way that I can. Just provide the materials and I'll make it for you.<P>
I've added a few links that should really help you out.  These sites basically have everything you'll ever 
need to play this game successfully and waste as little time as possible just running around aimlessly (like I 
did until I reached 5th level!).
<P>

Just click on the picture and then you can see exactly how twinked I am!<P>
In my little dream world, I would love to get Swiftwind and Earthcaller as my weapons of choice.  As for armour and jewlery, I'm still looking for the perfect mix.  I'm trying to make sure that I get a good balance between things that raise my armor class, resists, and attributes in a perfect mix (I would love to have a whole set of Thorny Vine Armor or Tolan's Darkwood, but I'll do with what I have for now).  So far I've done quite well.  My character may be a little "Twinked" at the moment, but I figure "What the hey!"  I don't get to play as much as some, and I usually end up solo on top of it.  Every little bit helps.
<P>

to try to collect.  They are also some of the most visited sites on the web!  Impressive!<P>
