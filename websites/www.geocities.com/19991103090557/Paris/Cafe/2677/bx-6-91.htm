<p align=left><font size=6><em><strong>Montreal Interview</strong></em></font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2><em>Bill was interviewed by Clive Anderson for British TV during the 1991 'Just For Laughs' Festival in 
Montreal, Canada. On TV, the interview was shown intercut with film of Bill's performance - 
consequently the interview seems a little disjointed. Here it is anyway: </em></font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>Last year you were a big hit at this festival, weren't you? </b></font></p>
<p><font size=4><em>I think so, yeah, it went really well. </em></font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>Now you're back, doing a long show, sold out as far as I can tell. Has this been a 
good year between last year's festival and this year's.. have you shot to stardom? </b></font></p>
<p><font size=4><em>Yeah, it's been a great year, it's been phenomenal. But it's also been, to 
me.. I mean, a continuation, I've not changed or anything, I'm doing the 
same stuff. It's like an oddity, people all of a sudden are like 'Hey, that's 
really kewl!' Y'know? Yeah, well where were you ten years ago, y'know? 
But, it's cool. It's all happening at the right time, and it is.. it's a big coup 
to come back and do the one man show. 'Cause my stuff I think requires a 
longer time than fifteen minutes. </em></font></p>
<p><font size=3>Yeah. Well, we'll illustrate that by showing a 30-second snatch of it. </font></p>
<p><font size=4><em>Great! [laughs] You'll do everything but the punchline! [English voice] 
'You see, in a longer set, there's a punchline. It's a laugh. But right now, 
that's him smoking and looking unhealthy.' [smokes, coughs] 'Good 
evening folks..' [cough] </em></font></p>
<p><font size=3><strong>Is there any similarity between your attitudes and stuff, and the writings of someone 
like PJ O'Rourke? Do you respect him... you're curling your lip a bit there... </strong></font></p>
<p><font size=4><em>Nah, he's funny... I'm not into political.. I'm not into political commentary 
at all. So in that regard, no. 'Cause I don't believe in giving these people 
any credence whatsoever, 'cause it's all undeserved. Are we not people, 
individuals, and who is our leader? There is no leader, shut up, let's 
move on to another... realm. And that's where I come from. And it seems 
rather anarchistic or.. revolutionary, rebellious, like you're saying, this 
attitide, 'errr.. is he a leftist, er..' No! I'm me! So remove all your little 
preconcieved notions, please.. And that's why I can seem rather demonic.. 
'He has no shame!' </em></font></p>
<p><font size=3><strong>Youth culture is supposed to be sex, drugs and rock &amp; roll. Your act is very much 
sort of.. oral sex, drugs and violence. Are those the topics that interest you, or.. do 
they just get the immediate responses? </strong></font></p>
<p><font size=4><em>Um, no, they interest me very much so, but I think they also tie into larger 
issues such as freedom of choice, and freedom in general. </em></font></p>
<p><font size=3><strong>Yeah. </strong></font></p>
<p><font size=4><em>Yeah, pretty pompous, I know. You're goin' 'Bill, I did SEE your show..' 
Well hey, what's wrong with sex, drugs and rock &amp; roll, Clive? C'mon! 
Y'know, people go [whiny voice] 'He's cruel, and vicious, and he talks 
about.. violence, and nyah nyah nyah...' Shut up. These same people 
read Stephen King novels, alright, and they come to see me and they're 
shocked. You know what I mean? It's a performance. It's a show. It's 
theater. Whaddaya do, do you go and see, yknow.. The Grapes of Wrath 
and complain 'cause the actors didn't wear shoes? They're Okies, they 
don't have shoes! 'We.. we were really offended..' It's part of the play! 
'Well..' People are idiots. [looks to camera] Cut that. I don't mean that. 
I'M an idiot. </em></font></p>
<p><font size=3><strong>The difficulty with stand-up comedy of course is that people think that.. It's just you 
standing there talking, there's no apparent art form, there's no.. </strong></font></p>
<p><font size=4><em>Right. </em></font></p>
<p><font size=3><strong>..it's not a play, it's not a piece of music, it's not a song, it's just you, standing there, 
saying what you feel, so.. That's why people have a very immediate reaction to it. </strong></font></p>
<p><font size=4><em>Right... and it is amazing, the visceral emotions that people get from 
standup, and particularly shows where people are.. sayin' something, 
they get ANGRY, and you're goin'... and what bugs me too though is they 
get angry before they hear the punchline. They don't know which way it's 
gonna twist... <br>
