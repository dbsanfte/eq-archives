<blockquote><B>Thank you for your interest in Friends Upholding Norrath!  We are a unique, small guild with seasoned, as well as newer players.  Take a moment to read our charter.  Unlike some other guilds, we really mean what we pledge, and try to treat each other, as well as other players, with the respect due 
them.  <P>

The acronym for our guild is FUN, meaning that if you are looking
for a serious guild that is into major raids and acquiring items which
require great planning and numerous players, you probably will not be happy with
us. However, if you are looking for a family, and people who will care
about you personally, then take a few moments to answer the following
questions.  <P>
Your answers will give us an idea if we are a right "fit" for your style
of playing.
