        <p>To quote a line from Aeky.&nbsp; &quot;My experience bar doesn't
        reflect the experience that my mind gained from this raid&quot;.&nbsp;
        It reminded me of what it must have been to be a pioneer in the early
        days to venture up to Sky.&nbsp; Indeed, I gained more respect for those
        who walked these paths before me.</p>

        Just wanted to let everyone know that since the beginning of time it has
        been a nightmare to keep our own members database up to snuff, just by
        the sheer volume of players we have in our guild.&nbsp; When Blood
        Inferno first kicked off we had a self updated member list, but that too
        was often neglected.
        <p>However, Veranon, from Silent Redemption, is beta testing a new interactive
        site that allows members (of any guild) to keep their own stats
        updated.&nbsp; It looks like something we could get an easy link to
        after it moves from the beta stage.&nbsp; However, I encourage all our
        members to <a href="http://sr.amiga.tm/brell/">go their and input their
        data now</a>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It does have some have some password protection, so you will want to
        be sure you have the password to the Blood Inferno section.&nbsp; You
        can find that password posted in our guild only section <a href="http://pub9.ezboard.com/bbloodinferno58183">on
        our message board</a>.</p>
        <p>Like all databases it requires the data you input to be accurate to
        help with any searches.&nbsp; If you are unsure of how to enter specific
        data please post on our message board for help.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Also wanted to note a few recent event.&nbsp; Congrats to those druid
        and rangers who were able to get another piece of their epic weapon this
        weekend in Eastern Karana.&nbsp; Thanks to Milco for putting this
        together to defeat the Dark Elf Corruptor and Reavers.&nbsp; It was
        quite fun for everyone, and resulted in helping quite a few folks in the
        guild.</p>
        <p>I also want to thank Katonka for spending 13 grueling hours with me
        this weekend camping Chief Rokgus in Drolga for my <a href="http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/item.html?item=4023">Idol
        of the Thorned</a>.</p>
        <p>Crelone has us slated for a Plane of Sky raid coming up in mid

        the intrinsic enjoyment you receive by being in this guild.</font></p>

        <p>Make sure you check the calendars, as we have a few raids in the very
        near future like Danni's Vox raid on the 21st, and an upcoming Plane of
        Hate raid.</p>

        Just in...&nbsp; An impromptu raid on Lady Vox was led last night by
        Danni.&nbsp; I was sent in this picture of the raid by Harrker.&nbsp;
        Picture was obviously taken by a caster, hiding behind a block of ice
        while the tanks are at the feet of the Ice Dragon trimming her
        toenails.&nbsp; Not sure how successful the raid was, but knowing our
        Danni, she don't fail.&nbsp; Hopefully someone on the raid can drop by
        our message board and fill us in with the details of the raid, and those
        great drops.&nbsp; Thanks for the picture guys!

        Continuing to work on the Event Calendars.&nbsp; I suggest guild members
        start taking a look at them, and making plans.&nbsp; Post your plans
        here <a href="http://pub9.ezboard.com/fbloodinferno58183frm15">on this
        thread</a> of our message board for right now, and I will add them to
        the calendar.
        <p>Note the Scars of Velious Poll to the right, as well as a few other
        enhancements.&nbsp; You can read up on the Scars of Velious launch here.</p>
        <p>Also wanted to note that one of my upcoming projects will be to write
        the <i>History of Blood Inferno</i> for prosperity reasons as well as
        good reading.&nbsp; The guild has a long history with tales of fantastic
        adventures, strong&nbsp; friendships, love and marriage, and the growth
        of our reputable family name into the world of Norrath.&nbsp; Please
        feel free to <a href="mailto:qualtarshylok@hotmail.com">drop me a line</a>
        if you would like to contribute to this storyline.&nbsp; Contributions
        can be in text, .jpg pictures, or any form you desire.&nbsp; The format
        of our history will be in multimedia presentation with pictures and
        sound, as well as text, so stay tuned!</p>

        Projects -
        <p>I have began work on a monthly calendar for the website.&nbsp; I
        currently have an example up on the calendar page.&nbsp; You can check
        out this months calendar <a href="NovCal.htm">here</a>.&nbsp; Right now
        it is blank minus a few entries from our message board.&nbsp; I am
        trying to figure out a way to integrate CGI scripting into our host
        server.&nbsp; Until that time, I will just manually add events
        there.&nbsp; It still looks better than a text based events list.&nbsp;
        I would prefer to get it so people with granted access (like Okansu) can
        add events as they are determined, which would make things a lot easier
        on me.</p>
        <p>I completely revamped the <a href="comments1.htm">comments page</a>,
        it was kind of bland.</p>
        <p>Fire Giant Raid -&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I also wanted to note the Fire Giant raid that our guild did this
        weekend.&nbsp; It went very well, and another Fire Giant raid is planned
        for the 19th.&nbsp; Here is a picture of a Blood Inferno member on King
        Tranix's Throne and the prep for the raid in the Stone Spider
        room.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Sign up for the next Fire Giant Raid is <a href="http://pub9.ezboard.com/fbloodinferno58183frm15.showMessage?topicID=2.topic">here
        on our Message Board</a>.&nbsp; Again if you have not been on one of
        these raids, or would like some info please check out the <a href="firegiants.htm">Fire
        Giant</a> article on our web page.</p>
        <p>Lastly, I took a moment to update the policies page for Blood
        Inferno.&nbsp; The policies are taken directly from the post by Melea on
        our message board.&nbsp; Please take a minute to refresh yourselves with
        <a href="Policies.htm">the guild policies here</a>.</p>
