            now the<br>
            proud possessor of the click stick. During the camp, Urzak was able 
            to<br>
            defeat Vage in a duel when Volumnia crept up to his computer and accepted<br>
            the duel while Vage was afk (hehe, just kidding, but it is kinda an<br>
            on-going fantasy....beat Vage in a duel, yeah right, WAKE UP!). In 
            real<br>
            news, Reaganne did manage to own Harbogast, but we believe that he 
            was clad<br>

            a weekend! Four epics in ONE DAY! We are some bad mammer jammers.<br>
            </font></b><br>
            It really all began as Fear Raid. With Marechal and Madea as the n00b 
            pullers, the raid went well. Break-in was no problem, despite the 
            fact that we were ready and rocking to go. The mobs just weren't there. 
            ADD had been there before us. But, there were plenty of mobs to kill. 
            Moving around to the North camp and then a little further, Mare, Lomas, 
            Madea started pulling. What fun, kiting several mobs around, snare 
            and arrow pulling. Things were rocking along quite steadily until 
            Terror decided to make an early appearance. Ooops. After CR, things 
            got back into shape and the mighty Terror was taken down handily. 
            Some epic pieces started.<br>
            <br>
            Sky was the next target. We were going for Ranger epic piece for Marechal 
            and others. Experimentation was the catch word of the day. First island, 
            no problem. Cute little fairies dropped like rocks and passed on their 
            keys. Moved to the third island. Strangely quiet for the first few 
            minutes, then all hell broke loose. Too many adds and it was time 
            to CR again. This time, the necro of the ages, our wonderful, talented 
            and beautiful AADORNA came through like a princess of the dead. Summoning 
            corpses until she was blue in the face, a strike team was assembled 
            and ported back up the island of the Azaracks. They were no match 
            for us (finally). But now, the question of what to do without all 
            the keys? After a few false starts, Vage started dealing death to 
            various party members who were then summoned to the fourth island. 
            After getting it all together again, we were ready. Meanwhile, Daegs 
            took a little sight seeing trip --- off the frigging island? Last 
            we heard from him was F***. Oh man, what is going on? Turns out he 
            had been &quot;bugged.&quot; Hmm, sounds like a num lock run while 
            going linkdead. Anyway, he was able to convince a kindly GM to port 
            him back up to the island and was back in on the fun.<br>
            <br>
            So, the groups clear a little space. Whack the boss and its time for 
            the pulling. Vage heads up to the next island, using the tried and 
            true tactics and pulls the first mob, a flying horse. Oooops. Vage 
            misses the island and keeps going. Hmmm, time to head to EC to start 
            selling. <br>
            <br>
            Meanwhile, Marechal is beside himself. Sigh, a trip to Sky, the swirling 
            sphere seems so close, but yet so far. Daegs is suggesting: General, 
            General, General. But, Kazy steps up to the plate. Damn, I love our 
            lizzzzards! Gets the info, has the key, and heads up. Perfect pulls. 
            The first one is a little challenging. Since we had explained, over 
            and over again, that the mobs would spawn after the first one is killed, 
            it was not too troublesome to hear the &quot;wtf&quot; over and over 
            again. Anyway, first one down. No drop. Sigh. Second one, no drop. 
            Third one, no drop. Ok Mare, what is the deal?<br>
            <br>
            Well, turns out that his info was a little off. Wrong mob, oops. /sheepish 
            grin. But, once we figured it out, Kazy grabbed the right one and 
            TWO spheres dropped. Grats to Mare and Temeras. Time to head home. 
            Lomas ported Mare around on his various errands and lo and behold! 
            SWIFTWIND is mine.....muwhahahahaha.<br>
            <br>
            But, it did not end there. In no particular order, VS was dispatched 
            by Aetherium (yawn), (dropping Tolan's Greaves --- Grats Mare)(Quote: 
            Veggie sez: now he is starting to look like less than a n00b). Dropped 
            the piece for BLISTA, who is now wielding this neato ball stick that 
            pulses with unearthly light (turn those particle effects on!). Next, 
            a quick trip up to Sky, some other dead mobs and KAZY has the bubble 
            makers! Epic number THREE. Finally, Steeloak is ushered into the City 
            of Mist, and standard tactics are used to take down the Lord. EPIC 
            NUMBER FOUR! Long pointed stick!<br>
            <br>
            Amazing. But, it was not over there, either. There were simply tooo 
            many black reavers up to pass over, so the pulling started. One Jade 
            Reaver Dropped -- Congrats Madea! <br>
            <br>
            The best part was to come, however. Last black reaver spawned into 
            two more and the last mob was, you guessed it, Lord Rake you over 
            the coals with his bad-ass AE. Wait, don't aggro hi.......<br>
            <br>
            Too late. Aggro. Corpses start a-popping, but even without the fire 
            pet, we ganked this spirit. Dropped another rune blade.<br>
            <br>
            Since we were all together, and it was raiding night, it was time 
            to head to Velketor's Labryinth to take out Lord Dreasrelk;sejaseal;ekraj 
            (Affectionately known as Lord Bob -- our little spank monkey). Taken 
            down like a cheap prom date, he was again afflicted with the dreaded 
            Lamo Loot stick, dropping some boots (grats Kazy) and some other stuff 
            (grats whoever).<br>
            <br>
            We called it a day (or at least this ranger did), and headed for home 
            ports. But what a day: A FOUR EPIC DAY! Grats to all, and thanks to 
            all for the support and aid.<br>

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shorty 
            Gets Epic: In a massive spray of particles (not that I ever see them, 
            since spell effects are off), the General Viagra and his cronies were 
            ganked by Aetherium. This completes Daegs Epic Ragebringer. CONGRATS 
            DAEGS!!!!! Thanks again to Harbo for his and Reaganne's great showing 
            of alternative armor. Harbo was outfitted for the evening in a lovely 
            ensemble of Bronze and banded. Very nicely done and tasteful. (Sadly, 
            his AC was still higher than the rangers.....go figure). Reaganne 
            was dressed in a perky collection of leathers. Very stylish, and what 
            the discriminating rogues in Fironia Vie will be wearing this season. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Also, a very special thanks to Harbo for being the Rule for Talthar 
            again. Great job bud!<br>
            <br>
            I think we have had assorted dings, but if you don't tell me, I can't 
            update. So, send me a tell. </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After much waiting 
            by the restless folks of Aetherium VS finally showed his ugly face. 
            There was much rejoicing and much preparation for the harrowing fight 
            ahead. With a record of 31 guildmates in attendance Aetherium charged 
            into the fray. Things were looking good. The rune tank was still up. 
            Such an oddity must soon be rectified. The call was given for nukes 
            and the world became a mass of color as the casters focused their 
            magical energy on destroying this beast. VS gave a horrendous cry 
            as his life was stolen from him. When the dust had cleared all were 
            amazed that there were no bodies on the ground. After some questioning 
            it was revealed that no one, yes I said no one, had died. Unfortunately 
            VS only produced a pair of Donal&#146;s legs (congrats Urzak) and 
            a Staff that cast elemental armor (No idea who this went to). There 
            was no wizard epic piece and only one pair of legs dropped. :(</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As you all know, 
            General Viagra is part of the rogue epic quest. Therefore, Aetherium 
            assembles to take this punk down when we need to get another Ragebringer. 
            We've done him before, but he is ... well ... challenging. This evening 
            was no exception. From across the world, the ranger sacrifice was 
            summoned and all was ready. Initial pulls were made. Dr00d went down, 
            and General Viagra chased Vage back to camp. </font></p>
          <p> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, then, the 
            manure hit the air circulation device. First, Talthar went down like 
            the good Rune for the offtank that he is. Winor or Harbo stepped up, 
            it is hard to remember. Another casualty. Heals pouring in, chaos 
            erupting, spells going off, battle spam, cats and dogs sleeping together.....it 
            was a nightmare. Aggro gained by the ranger sacrifice, jolt wouldn't 
            stick, so pulled off. Down to half a bubble and healing to get just 
            a few more hitpoints. Jump back in and take the General down to the 
            thin red line, then LOADING PLEASE WAIT. </font></p>
          <p> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What happened 
            next is classic. It was CASTER TANK TIME! Yes, all of the casters, 
            OOM from previous attemps, jumped in and whacked the General Down. 
            Victory for Aetherium! Carnage all over the place, and most of the 
            blood was ours. This goes into the &quot;messy but victory&quot; column, 
            and we live to fight another day.</font></p>
          <p> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We have prepared 
            some screen shots and are sending them to the manufacturer of Viagra. 
            They have contacted us on testimonials regarding the fact that Viagra 
            Does Not Go Down Easily. No, I won't be splitting the royalties....

            taken down again. Grats to Temeras and another unnamed, (No body told 
            me :(, so I have no idea). Dark Elf Corrupters taken out (again congrats 
            Temeras). JOLT PURCHASED!!!! (again, congrats Temeras, guild breathes 
            sigh of relief). I know that we had some recent levels, but if I don't 
            get tells or email, I just have to guess, so congrats to those nameless, 
            faceless masses who are taking off nights seriously. Recent ring quests 
            have also been completed, and Reaganne now has sixth, Harbo is at
