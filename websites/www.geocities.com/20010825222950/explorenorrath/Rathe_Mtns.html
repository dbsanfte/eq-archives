He is located in a hut at pos4100, pos900, near the Lake Rathe zone.<br><br>The drawback, of course, is that nobody seems to know (beyond one quest for Shadow Knights) how to get him to talk about what he can do for you.&nbsp; Possibly a broken or unimplemented series of quests, but interesting nonetheless.<br><br>One word of note: He offers two services, gemcutting and jewelry repair. For the gemcutting aspect, all that triggers him as far as rare stones thusfar is the shadow knight's hyacinth stone (I tried all normal and planar gems, and none worked). There is, however, a tinkered gemcutter that members of the gnome race are able to make, and its use is yet unknown.

My next course of action will most likely be scouring the boards for mentions of 'broken' jewelry, and seeing if either asking him about the items, or giving them to him, results in any progress on this. Good luck in your endeavours to puzzle this NPC's existance out!</span></font><b><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:14"><br><br></span></font></b><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:14">[Fri Feb 16 20:09:59 2001] You say, 'hail Darfumpel Zirubbel'<br>[Fri Feb 16 20:09:59 2001] Darfumpel Zirubbel says 'Hail, Anazia .&nbsp; I am Darfumpel, master jeweler and proprietor of this shop.&nbsp; How might I assist you today?&nbsp; Perhaps you need a stone [cut] or some jewelry [repaired]? <br>[Fri Feb 16 20:10:03 2001] You say, 'What cut?'<br>[Fri Feb 16 20:10:03 2001] Darfumpel Zirubbel says 'Yes, I use a new gemcutting technique I designed myself.&nbsp; It will bring out the beauty of any gem.&nbsp; However, as arrogant as this may sound, I do not cut just any ordinary stone.&nbsp; They must be rare or of extraordinary quality.&nbsp; Have you an exceptional stone that requires faceting?&nbsp; If so, what type of gem is it? <br>[Fri Feb 16 20:10:12 2001] You say, 'It is a hyacinth'<br>[Fri Feb 16 20:10:12 2001] Darfumpel Zirubbel says 'A hyacinth, eh?&nbsp; That is quite a rare stone.&nbsp; Quite fragile and easily shattered, too.&nbsp; With my new technique, I can assure you I will not destroy the gem, however, it will cost you.&nbsp; 1000 platinum coins is my fee.&nbsp; Provide me with the coin and the gem and I will cut it for you. <br>[Fri Feb 16 20:10:17 2001] You say, 'It is a wraithstone'<br>[Fri Feb 16 20:10:28 2001] You say, 'It is a fiery gem of underfoot'<br>[Fri Feb 16 20:10:43 2001] You say, 'What jewelry repair?'<br>[Fri Feb 16 20:10:43 2001] Darfumpel Zirubbel says 'Although more mundane a task, I do have a shop to keep up and so I repair jewelry for a nominal fee. <br>[Fri Feb 16 20:10:52 2001] You say, 'What kind of jewelry?'<br>[Fri Feb 16 20:10:56 2001] You say, 'What nominal fee?'<br>[Fri Feb 16 20:11:02 2001] You say, 'How much do you charge?'<br>[Fri Feb 16 20:11:09 2001] You say, 'How much to repair jewelry?'<br>[Fri Feb 16 20:11:09 2001] Darfumpel Zirubbel says 'Although more mundane a task, I do have a shop to keep up and so I repair jewelry for a nominal fee. <br>[Fri Feb 16 20:11:16 2001] You say, 'What do you repair?'<br>[Fri Feb 16 20:11:16 2001] Darfumpel Zirubbel says 'Although more mundane a task, I do have a shop to keep up and so I repair jewelry for a nominal fee. <br>[Fri Feb 16 20:11:38 2001] You say, 'I have some jewelry I need repaired'<br>[Fri Feb 16 20:11:44 2001] You say, 'I need some jewelry repaired'<br>[Fri Feb 16 20:11:47 2001] You say, 'What repaired?'<br>[Fri Feb 16 20:12:04 2001] You say, 'What do you repair?'<br>[Fri Feb 16 20:12:32 2001] You say, 'Can you repair a choker?'<br>[Fri Feb 16 20:12:32 2001] Darfumpel Zirubbel says 'Although more mundane a task, I do have a shop to keep up and so I repair jewelry for a nominal fee. <br>[Fri Feb 16 20:12:42 2001] You say, 'Can you repair a locket?'<br>[Fri Feb 16 20:12:42 2001] Darfumpel Zirubbel says 'Although more mundane a task, I do have a shop to keep up and so I repair jewelry for a nominal fee. <br>[Fri Feb 16 20:12:46 2001] You say, 'I have a broken locket'<br>[Fri Feb 16 20:12:51 2001] You say, 'hail Darfumpel Zirubbel'<br>[Fri Feb 16 20:12:51 2001] Darfumpel Zirubbel says 'Hail, Anazia .&nbsp; I am Darfumpel, master jeweler and proprietor of this shop.&nbsp; How might I assist you today?&nbsp; Perhaps you need a stone [cut] or some jewelry [repaired]? <br>[Fri Feb 16 20:12:56 2001] You say, 'I need a stone cut'<br>[Fri Feb 16 20:12:56 2001] Darfumpel Zirubbel says 'Yes, I use a new gemcutting technique I designed myself.&nbsp; It will bring out the beauty of any gem.&nbsp; However, as arrogant as this may sound, I do not cut just any ordinary stone.&nbsp; They must be rare or of extraordinary quality.&nbsp; Have you an exceptional stone that requires faceting?&nbsp; If so, what type of gem is it? <br>[Fri Feb 16 20:13:01 2001] You say, 'A tiny ruby'<br>[[Fri Feb 16 20:13:30 2001] You say, 'I have an augmentor's gem'<br>[Fri Feb 16 20:13:42 2001] You say, 'I have a bent metallic crystal'<br>[Fri Feb 16 20:13:58 2001] You say, 'I have a black sky diamond'</span></font><b><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:14"><br></span></font></b><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:14">[Fri Feb 16 20:14:02 2001] You say, 'I have a black sapphire'<br>[Fri Feb 16 20:14:08 2001] You say, 'I have crushed black marble'<br></span></font><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"><br><br><br><br></span></font><b><i><font face="Arial" size="-1"><span style="font-size:12"><br>Page updated: 02/23/01</span></font></b></i><i><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:14"><br></span></font></i><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:14"><br></span></font><span style="font-size:14"><br></span><i><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:14"><br></span></font></i></td>
