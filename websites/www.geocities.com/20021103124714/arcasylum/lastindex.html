<b>April 4, 2002</b> - <i>Zsa</i> - Sev must be getting pretty sick of us by now. Down he goes again. Doomshade is another story; that freak is pushing his luck. And a belated congrats to Parri on her epic. She got it a while ago, and I never did get it posted here. I should be taken out behind the woodshed and beaten senseless.

<b>April 1, 2002</b> - <i>Zsa</i> - To keep things lively over the weekend, Aelstyn and Yienie also got their epics. Congrats! The good news is there was no contention whatsoever for Ragefire. Ha ha! April Fools! Oh, I kill myself... I'm such a cutup...
<br><br>
<b>March 29, 2002</b> - <i>Zsa</i> - The warrior epics keep on coming. Sev dies again, Larzuk looks cool with his new light sabres. Also, maximum respect for Graviton, who completed AA's first mage epic last night.
<br><br>
<b>March 25, 2002</b> - <i>Zsa</i> - Congrats to Yana and Hikammer on their epics this weekend. Keep up the good work, all...
<br><br>
<b>March 20, 2002</b> - <i>Zsa</i> - More keeling. Congrats to Hikammer on picking up AA's second green scale. Special thanks to Darkmoons for their help. And congrats to all for finding a new mob to pick on - AA > Servitor of Luclin.

<b>March 14, 2002</b> - <i>Zsa</i> - Found the discussion thread on Magelo profiles interesting, so added a permanent <A HREF="http://www.pattyanddave.com/dave/aa/magelo">Magelo gallery</A> link to the front page. Feel free to send your Magelo profiles to <A HREF="mailto:arcaneequipment@yahoo.com">arcaneequipment@yahoo.com</A>, but please do not use this as a replacement for keeping us updated specifically for the armor tracker.
<br><br>
<b>March 12, 2002</b> - <i>Zsa</i> - Thanks to all who attended and participated in the guild meeting last night. The transcript can be found in our private message board. Enjoy!
<br><br>
<b>March 11, 2002</b> - <i>Gadd</i> - If you haven't noticed, Faril is running around like a giddy school girl (plaid skirt and all) at the fair with his new set of glow sticks.  Congrats on your epic Faril.
<br><br>
<b>March 5, 2002</b> - <i>Zsa</i> - Severilous finally fell to Arcane Asylum! He went down this morning and dropped one green scale. More details to follow. Congrats Faril!! Congrats to Kitaro on his Treasure Hunter's Satchel, Lathes (our new level 60!) for the Orb of Tishan, and whoever got the 4 spells that dropped. Thanks to our friends outside the guild who helped make this possible.

<b>February 27, 2002</b> - <i>Zsa</i> - Just published a new issue of <A HREF="http://www.pattyanddave.com/dave/aa/">Overheard in the Market</A>. For those of you who think that is a good thing, sorry for the long delay. Keep those pictures coming for the photo album as well...
<br><br>
<b>February 25, 2002</b> - <i>Zsa</i> - A few more pictures have started to trickle in for our <A HREF="http://www.pattyanddave.com/dave/aa/photoalbum">photo album</A>, and I'm
posting them as soon as I can. Those who haven't submitted pics yet are always
encouraged to do so. Also, anyone out there who can mail me a decent ToV
screenshot, please do so <A HREF="mailto:dave@pattyanddave.com">here</A>.
<br><br>
<b>February 21, 2002</b> - <i>Gadd</i> - Last night we passed 160 drops from ToV in the month of February.  We have around 200 pieces of SS armor in the guild now.  Keep up the good work.
<br><br>
<b>February 17, 2002</b> - <i>Zsa</i> - Congrats to Davorious on his leaf blower, and thanks to all that helped. And a belated congrats to Denov, who pointed out that his leaf blower never hit the front page. I'm such a bastard.

<br><br>
<b>February 15, 2002</b> - <i>Zsa</i> - Great job everyone on Kelorek'Dar last night. People assembled quickly and gave him a serious beatdown. Congrats to Ikin on the Bioluminescent Orb, Vectinn on the Typhoon, Nayl and Barrius on the Sea Dragon Meat, Gabrielle on the Scale, and anyone else I forgot. Nayl is already the proud owner of his new Othmir Prexus Totem. Congrats!

<br><br>
<b>February 12, 2002</b> - <i>Zsa</i> - Added the Va'Dyn pics to our <A HREF="http://briefcase.yahoo.com/arcasylum">briefcase of pictures</A> so they don't get lost over time. Also fixed the logo problem on Netscape, in case that has bothered anyone other than me.
<br><br>
<b>February 12, 2002</b> - <i>Gadd</i> - Despite the slow posting of the news, has been a very 
busy week for us.  We are right at 100 drops in ToV for this last week.  Even with this great 
marathon, we had time to kill ragefire for Iyena also geting the bonus 2 cloak 
of flames (Grats Faril and Hik) and a red scale.  We also ran over to Akheva to drop Va'Dyn.  Wow is all 
I have to say about Humm's new sword.  I also love Talcea's new group focus spell, very nice.
We also found some time to drop VS, grats Rain on your golden legs.

<br><br>
<b>January 31, 2002</b> - <i>Zsa</i> - Another picture below for us to study to learn good form. Hey wait! That's us! This and other pictures can now be found in a photo album <A HREF="http://briefcase.yahoo.com/arcasylum">here</A>. Special thanks to Sano for these submissions.

<br><br>
<b>January 29, 2002</b> - <i>Gadd</i> - People are leveling and we finished a couple more epics this weekend.  Congrats to Muvanu and Caleshia.  Guess that makes 15 epics so far.
<br><br>
<b>January 21, 2002</b> - <i>Gadd</i> - Epic fever continues, Lyena gets the snake, grats.  I am not completely sure, I think that makes something like 13 epics so far this month.  I know it shattered our previous record of 8 in one month.
<br><br>
<b>January 16, 2002</b> - <i>Gadd</i> - Terrific job in ToV last night.  An amazing two bp's dropped off one mob.  Great job all on quick killing, we were pulling very deep.  Thanks Sano once again for your first class pulling.
<br><br>
<b>January 13, 2002</b> - <i>Zsa</i> - Congrats to Punks on becoming our newest leaf blower! I also updated several of the pictures in the photo album with snapshots I got at one time or another.
<A HREF="http://www.pattyanddave.com/dave/aa/pic/faydedar.jpg" BORDER=0><IMG SRC="http://www.pattyanddave.com/dave/aa/pic/SmFaydedar.jpg" BORDER=0></A>
<IMG SRC="http://www.pattyanddave.com/dave/aa/pic/CaleshiaCabinet.jpg">
<BR><BR>
<b>January 12, 2002</b> - <i>Zsa</i> - Congrats to Barrius on pulling down his shaman epic! Also, thanks all for a successful Kedge. We got Omanyte 2 epic pieces, Punks his last piece, and Folok and I got our last piece for our Divine Might spell quest.
<br><br>
<b>January 7, 2002</b> - <i>Zsa</i> - The epic parade rolls on. Congrats to Winnette on getting our newest click stick, and thanks to all that contributed!
<center><A border=0 href="http://www.pattyanddave.com/dave/aa/pic/Ragefire.jpg"><img src="http://www.pattyanddave.com/dave/aa/pic/SmRagefire.jpg" border=0></A></center>
<br><br>
<b>January 6, 2002</b> - <i>Gadd</i> - Congrats to the rogues: Heliox, Katami, Snowood, and Plumps.  I think we hit a new record for the guild, 6 epics in one week.
<br><br>
<b>January 5, 2002</b> - <i>Gadd</i> - We killed Wuoshi this morning.  Almost so smooth and quick with only one death that you would almost have to forget that the attempt right before ended in Wuoshi cleaning her toes after she was done with us.
<center><a border=0 href="pictures/woushi0105.jpg"><img src="pictures/woushi0105sm.jpg" border=0></a></center>
<br><br>
<b>January 3, 2002</b> - <i>Zsa</i> - Congrats to Tssure on his stylish new bubble fists! Also, a belated congrats to Dymond on her snake stick. Since it would be a horrible faux pas to have forgotten to post this, I've concluded that I must have posted it, and some shady character removed it. We have a suspect - if anyone sees 
<A HREF="http://www.pattyanddave.com/dave/aa/pic/sano.jpg">this suspicious looking character</A>, report her immediately! Suspect is considered highly dangerous, and may be wearing a disguise.
<br><br>
<b>January 1, 2002</b> - <i>Zsa</i> - Happy New Year everyone! Congrats to Amidee and Humm on getting their epics. First Bard epic for AA!
