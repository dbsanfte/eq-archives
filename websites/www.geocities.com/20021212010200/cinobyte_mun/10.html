<u>Entry 1</u>
<p><img src="ralph_mumferd.jpg" align=left>
While racing across the desert of Ro, something caught my foot and a moment later I had taken in a mouthful of sand. Jumping up ready to start a fight (and likely win I might add) I turned to discover what it was I had tripped on. A book. A book? I removed it, brushed it off, and began to leaf through it. Empty. Nothing. Not even a recipee for a Goat Meat Sandwich. As I was about to throw the thing back from wence it came, My rabbit companion by the name of Mr. Ralph explained to me that I could possibly use it as a journal. Well...what you have just read is the start.
<br>I spent the remaining hours of the day blasting Crocodiles into molten piles of scales. When I look back, I realize that it was truley the Crocs' own faults for being out in sight when I was feeling particularly malicious. When we were not hunting, Mr. Ralph and I sat on the nearby dock playing cards, only having to stop once or twice to toss corpses of the Local Desert crazy folk into the water after they had so rudely stopped to ask us what we were playing. 
<br>One of these days Im going to win my money back.<hr><br clear=left>
<p><u>Entry 2</u><p>
Using some money I found off a few corpses laying here and there (I SWEAR THEY WHERE ALREADY DEAD WHEN I FOUND THEM!!!) I bought myself a transport to the lovely Rathe Mountains. Very...quaint. Well I did my best to get over my boredom, and Mr. Ralph in the meantime found himself a perty jack rabbit to swoom over.<br>
In Mr. Ralph's absence I was forced to improvise to find a new sidekick. Roaming around I found an interesting lizard type fellow by the name of SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS (Im not sure but I might have misspelled it). We were friends right from the start.
<br>We shared a Goat Meat Sandwich together... although he actually just ripped the meat out from between the bread and ate it all himself.
We romped up and down the mountains together....although that was mainly because the Giant Skeleton we met up with didnt seem to appreciate either of us.
And later I rooted his dumb arse and Fireballed him til his corpse was hot enough to keep me warm throughout the entire chilly mountain night. 
<p>Never let it be said that Mumferd doesnt care about his friends.<hr>
<p><u>Entry 3</u><p>
Wolk up in the darndest of places today. When I opened my eyes I was completely surrounded by four walls, one of which Mr. Ralph was currently relieving himself upon. No one should ever have to wake up to that. 
<br>Upon further investigation it became clear as to what had transpired the evening previous. 
<br>Mr. Ralph and I had just made the aquaintance of some filthy looking fellows who all went by the name Derv...or something like that. The night started out well. I broke out the Iron Toe Tonic and quickly succumbed. Mr. Ralph had managed to locate a discarded bottle of some Tunare's finest and soon had entered a catatonic state and was swearing he was seeing someplace called "Disneyland". Heh. Crazy bunny.
<br> Soon the Derv's took liberty to our persons (They looted us...dont get sick on me now, reader) and pushed us into the river. Luckily they only took one of my backpacks (For some reason I have the ability to carry 7 more).
<br>The next morning we awoke within the Qeynos aqueduct system. The smell was familiar and I could swear I recognized some debris from a party I had thrown in the city above a year ago. <p>Im glad to see that there is a sewer system that actually works.<hr>
<p><u>Entry 4</u><p>
We explored our new environment with the utmost care and understanding. That and we chased around a few beggars for the coppers they had managed to obtain down here by ways that only Gawd would know. Turning a corner we met face to face with some kind of green gelatine like cube. Luckily it was wearing its VTMNT (Verant Trademark Monster Name Tag) and we quickly identified it as "Cubert" (I made sure to duck so not to be hit in the face with some kind of ATARI lawsuit that tends to fly out of the woodwork at the damndest things).
<br>Unfortunatly for Cubert, Mr. Ralph and I had been quite hungry since our Hangovers from the night before subsided. And since there is ALWAYS room for Jello, we jumped the inhuman beast and proceded to devour.
<p>You would think that something without a mouth would not be able to scream, but there are always surprises out there.
<p>As we finished, I noticed a torn dress that Cubert must have collected at some point. I shruged and pocketed it, hoping it might be worth a few coin. 
<br>We found our way to the surface and I immediately ran to a merchant only to discover that there really wasnt much of a market for torn pieces of dress. Feeling annoyed, I handed the torn dress to a nearby guard who immeadiatly begin to sob and cry.
<p>Obviously he knew just how worthless it was as well.<hr>
<p><u>Entry 5</u>
<p>
I have joined something called a "Guild"? I'm not sure but I believe it is some kind of 24 hour keg party. "Order of the Tilted Stein" certainly has somewhat of a ring to it wouldnt you say? Or is that just permanant ear damage from my constant use of powerful explosives? <br>
Could be worse. The Goblins on the recieving end of those explosives are still searching for their scattered unmentionables. 
I shall see what this...Guild has to offer me. Tonight they plan to induct Mr. Ralph into the guild as well. I insisted that I become a member first, so that I could more easily prepare Mr. Ralph for his ceremony.
<br>That and I wouldnt DREAM of missing the barbaric Hazing we plan to invoke upon his little rabbit bum. <br>
(Stop thinking what I know yer thinking cause its not right)<br>
Sickos!<hr>
<p><u>Entry 6</u><p>
There is a heavenly body within this new guild. Her name? Puffaluvwumpkins!! Well... maybe thats MY name for her. And maybe she retches whenever I come near BUT I feel that our relationship is off to a good start. For one thing she hasnt left the continent. 
<br>Unfortunately I did, when a gate spell misfired and I found myself flung across the ocean. Ah. That Sea Air does wonders for my lungs (If I could find them). Mr. Ralph accompanied me as usual. I've taken the liberty of crafting a kind of leash so I can constantly keep tabs on him. Ever since the Kaladim incident some years back I've never quite trusted him on his own. Needless to say I'm sure there will be fewer Angry Mobs from now on. <br>
We came to a fantastic 10 point landing (3 points for Mr. Ralph who lost a limb on re-entry) in a field of bone. I forget the name but it will come to me soon enough. Unless I do some drinking tonight. That reminds me...I wonder where Mr. Ralph hid that Elven wine? Bah. I'll interrogate him once we find a place to hold up for the night. There is a large and ominous tower off in the distance. I wonder if they have any vacancies?
<p>If not there are plenty of ways to remedy that problem. Hopefully Mr. Ralph remembered to pack the poison caplets disguised as hotel mints.<hr>
<p><u>Entry 7</u><p>
They call this place Karn's Tower. There is an inscription on the door in some ancient language that I just so happen know how to read. It says...
<p>"Lodging. Plenty of Vacancy. Come on in and trash the place"
<p>Perhapes my translation is a bit exagerated... but I wouldnt want to be the poor soul who disagrees with me. 
<br>I slipped inside first while Mr. Ralph followed in with the Luggage. And if he makes another joke about my purple bags I'm going to see to it that he never checks out of this hotel. 
<br>My first impression of this place? Dead. Dead Quiet. Dead bussiness. Dead people. Did I mention dead? I can't seem to find a living soul in this entire establishment. Nothing but a skeleton crew. The lobby is nice though. 
<br>I approached the only think resembling a front desk and rang the bell. Well there was no bell... so I killed a few random skeletons until someone noticed me. If there is one thing I hate its bad service. In fact I got the feeling that I was expected just to stake a claim on one of the rooms in the tower rather than pay for it. Which works for me considering I wasnt about to pay anyway. Perhapes my reputation preceeds me. 
<br>Climbing several flights of stairs I finally found a large bunk area being shared by several of those creepy lizard skeletons that think they own the place. A few well aimed fireballs and a jar of bone eating beetles later and the room was mine. All mine. MINE MINE MINE!!
<p>Found myself leaving the tower 5 minutes later when I discovered they didnt have a pool or offer a Continental Breakfast.<hr>
<p><u>Entry 8</u><p>I have returned home to the mainland. There was much rejoicing. Well...Mr. Ralph and I rejoiced. Well...we drank til we were convinced we lived in Delaware and our names were Susan and Bob. Happy?
<br>Today was my first date with Puffluvwumpkins. I know for a fact she was impressed. The way she clutched her utensils during dinner with that "Im going to stab you right in the eye" look was absolutely touching. <p>She seemed to have a good number of stories about people not being able to take subtle hints. <p> After dinner we strolled out to the nearby festering crag of Dwarf poo called Dagnor's Cauldron. Avoiding the dank and certainly questionable water at all costs, we made our way across the beach with a healthy game of IIMKI (If It Moves Kill It). Needless to say, we orphaned a good number of aqua goblin children. <hr>
<p><u>Entry 9</u><p>
Joined a group of my fellow guild mates on a jolly romp through the fields of South Karana. A druid in the ranks even gave us the honor of turning us into wolves for a day. Bit of a pity that a pack of woof woofs had recently been raiding the nearby sheep flock. So most of the evening was spent avoiding peasants with torches and pitch forks. 
<br>Well besides all that nonsense, it was a fairly uneventful night. Unless you count the incident concerning a large one eyed monster emerging from the trees and stepping on a fellow guildy (Who is currently recovering nicely considering we only found half his organs). This interesting Creature, going by the name of Broon isnt what I call the most polite of conversationalists. It seems his idea of a "How do you do?" consists of beating apart individuals with a large club. A couple of guild members lost due to these unpleasant introductions and it became a unanimous vote that this Broon fellow might just have to find himself scattered across the hills in a manner that even a necromancer would hide under his bed to avoid witnessing. 
<br>The battle was long, harsh, and simply too violent to go into great detail. Basically there was a lot of stick bashing, sword swinging, spell casting, and now Mr. Ralph and I are the only remaining members of The Order of the Tilted Stein. <p>Mr. Ralph was later removed from his Vice President position when he was caught investing the guild's assets on Adult Magazines. Dirty Bunny. Didn't Share. <hr>
<p>
<u>Entry 10</u><p>
Beautiful sunrise this morning...and again an hour later. (One of these days I'll have to figure out whats up with these rather quick 24 hour periods. My personal hypothesis at the current moment? Mother Nature has been slipping Speed into her waffles).<br>
Mr. Ralph found a charming method of waking me up. Lets just say I've never awoke under water before. <br>Breakfast was put on hold until Mr. Ralph was able to untie himself from that Elephant's Censored region.<br>
Came across an Ogre tending a corn field. Went by the name of "Tiny" (Yes I know. Tad bit of false advertising there). Had Mr. Ralph distract Tiny for a few moments while I walked around searching for something sharp. Just then...a little Mumferd with itty bitty angel wings popped on my shoulder, whispering the secrets of "peace and love and harmony" into my ear. <p>It was a good enough victim as any to test my sharp stick on.
