<h1>Nagafen Raid Overview</h1>

<hr>
<h3>Some Intro</h3>
Expect the raid to take about an hour from the time it starts.  However,
a Nagafen raid is usually preceded by a Fire Giant raid.  You should read
the <a href="fgoverview.html">overview</a> on that to get some idea of how 
you'll get to the Nagafen portion.  Once the Fire Giants are cleared, there
is nothing left to do before Nagafen.  The respawn rate on Fire Giants is 
sufficiently low that they won't be a factor if things take a bit, unlike the Ice Giants
on a Vox raid.  Also, the Fire Giant raid will leave you right at the 
staging area for a Nagafen raid.
<p>
The Nagafen raid essentially consists of a buffing circle, then a 
camp out to the chat room.  When the command is given, everyone logs back in
and the Charge! command is given.

<hr>
<h3>Who Should Go</h3>
I believe 49+ folks.  Lower levels can make a contribution, sometimes a
significant one.  However, they have lower resistances and a harder time
hitting with weapons or sticking spells on the 55th level beastie.

<hr>
<h3>Configuring Yourself</h3>
Resistances are of primary importance in tackling Nagafen.  They are more
important than your AC.  If you are tempted to keep that great AC item
instead of the great Fire Resist item, consider that Nagafen will only 
be clawing/biting you every once in a while; he will be hitting you with his
AE fire attack continually.
<p>
Three types of spell effects will be  hitting you: a fire attack, 
a fear, and a cancel magic.  This means that 
you need both Fire Resistance and Magic Resistance.  The former is the most
important, but don't build it to the exclusion of MR (a FR of 200 won't
help that much if you spend the entire battle running from the fear).  Try
to get both above 100 after buffing, with Fire Resistance significantly 
above 100.
<p>
There are a lot of items for raising resistances; you can browse one of the
various databases, such as EQStratics, for them.  For example, right now
for Nagafen I use: 

<ul>
  <li>Head - Froglok Crown, +20 Fire</li>
  <li>Neck - White Gold Necklace, +7 Fire/Magic</li>
  <li>Face - Gold/Diamond Mask, +10 Fire +3 Magic</li>
  <li>Ears - Earrings of Fire Reflection, +5 Fire each</li>
  <li>Shoulders - Bloodstained Mantle, +10 MR</li>
  <li>Wrists - Platinum/Emerald Bracelets, +10 Fire each</li>
  <li>Fingers - Gold/Emerald Rings, +6 Fire each</li>
  <li>Range Slot - Runed Bone Fork, +10 Fire/Magic</li>
</ul>

Turn off Run if you are a tank.  This will prevent you from going too far
when feared; you can then Run back.  Casters have Run on;
you may have a chance of running out of the room if Nagafen summons you.
<p>
Casters should bind back beyond the last turn before the door to Nagafen.
Mages and Necros should duel to leave a corpse with pet reagents.
<p>
Minimize spam and lag by turning down the settings on your machine:
<ul>
  <li>Particle Density: LOW</li>
  <li>Level of Detail: OFF</li>
  <li>My Misses: OFF</li>
  <li>Others Hits: OFF</li>
  <li>Others Misses: OFF</li>
  <li>Attacker Missing Me: OFF</li>
  <li>PC Spells: OFF</li>
  <li>NPC Spells: OFF for tanks (casters may want to know when to run)</li>
  <li>Bard Songs: OFF</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>The Groups</h3>
Raids of more than 7 groups start to introduce too much lag into the process.  
Groups are organized into tank groups, nuker groups, pet groups, and 
buffer groups.  Obviously the composition will vary depending upon what you
have, the following is just illustrative.
<p>
<b>Tank1 - Tank3</b><br>
1 Tank<br>
2 Tank<br>
3 Tank<br>
4 Cleric<br>
5 Bard<br>
6 Druid or Shaman
<p>
<b>Nuke1 - Nuke2</b><br>
1 Wizard<br>
2 Wizard<br>
3 Wizard<br>
4 Wizard<br>
5 Wizard<br>
6 Druid or Shaman
<p>
<b>Pet1</b><br>
1 Mage<br>
2 Mage<br>
3 Mage<br>
4 Necro<br>
5 Necro<br>
6 Druid or Shaman
<p>
<b>Buff1</b><br>
1 Druid<br>
2 Druid<br>
3 Shaman<br>
4 Shaman<br>
5 Enchanter<br>
6 Enchanter
<p>
If you don't have a Bard for a tank group, put a second cleric in instead
of the druid/shaman.  Again, these are sample group compositions; you're
actual compositions will depend on who you have.

<hr>
<h3>Buffing Circle</h3>
The purpose of this is to provide the desired buffs to the participants
in the desired order.  You want the least-important buffs stripped by
Nagafen first.
<p>
Everyone must remove <i>all</i> buffs before entering the circle--even if 
you already have a buff you know you are going to receive.  This prevents
buffs from running out prematurely, buffs not taking because you had too 
many active, etc.
<p>
Note about the following lists:  the spell listed is the minimum spell
to be cast in a series.  If you have buffers of the appropriate level, and
enough bards to keep them full of mana, then you can increase the 
level of buffs used:
<ul>
  <li>Resolution -> Heroism -> Fortitude</li>
  <li>Symbol of Naltron -> Symbol of Marzin</li>
  <li>Shield of Words -> Bulwark of Faith</li>
  <li>Swift Like The Wind -> Aanya's Quickening -> Wondrous Rapidity</li>
  <li>Clarity -> Clarity II</li>
  <li>Talisman of Altuna -> Talisman of Kragg</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

Tanks get buffed with:
<ol>
  <li>Levitate if bard in group, Agility if not</li>
  <li>Dead Man Floating if bard in group, Stamina if not</li>
  <li>Dexterity</li>
  <li>Rune IV</li>
  <li>Berserk</li>
  <li>Shield of Words</li>
  <li>Swift Like The Wind</li>
  <li>Chloroplast</li>
  <li>Talisman of Altuna</li>
  <li>Skin Like Nature</li>
  <li>Symbol of Naltron</li>
  <li>Fire Resistance</li>
  <li>Group Magic Resistance</li>
  <li>Potion of Cold</li>
  <li>Lava Shield</li>
</ol>

If a bard is in the group, tanks should remove Buff #1 and #2 to make room
for the bard songs.
<p>
Healers/buffers get buffed with:
<ol>
  <li>Levitate if bard in group, Agility if not</li>
  <li>Dead Man Floating if bard in group, Shield of Words if not</li>
  <li>Stamina</li>
  <li>Rune IV</li>
  <li>Berserk</li>
  <li>Insight</li>
  <li>Clarity</li>
  <li>Chloroplast</li>
  <li>Talisman of Altuna</li>
  <li>Skin Like Nature</li>
  <li>Symbol of Naltron</li>
  <li>Fire Resistance</li>
  <li>Group Magic Resistance</li>
  <li>Potion of Cold</li>
  <li>Lava Shield</li>
</ol>

If a bard is in the group, clerics should remove Buff #1 and #2 to make room
for the bard songs.
<p>
Casters get buffed with:
<ol>
  <li>Agility</li>
  <li>Shield of Words</li>
  <li>Stamina</li>
  <li>Rune IV</li>
  <li>Berserk</li>
  <li>Brilliance</li>
  <li>Clarity</li>
  <li>Chloroplast</li>
  <li>Arch Shielding</li>
  <li>Skin Like Nature</li>
  <li>Symbol of Naltron</li>
  <li>Fire Resistance</li>
  <li>Group Magic Resistance</li>
  <li>Potion of Cold</li>
  <li>Lava Shield</li>
</ol>

Once you have completed the buff circle, immediately camp out to the 
Brell-Nagafen chat room.  Once everyone is buffed and has medded back their
mana, the order will be given to log back in.  Log in immediately and drink your
potion (if you have one).  Pet classes summon pets and have one of the druids
cast Resist Magic on it. Med up...the charge will be very shortly.

<hr>
<h3>The Charge</h3>
Tank1 and Tank2 and the pets charge upon the command.  Get all the way across
the bridge, if possible, so that you fight him in the room.  After 10 seconds
(to minimize traffic jam and lag problems), Tank3 charges.  When Nagafen gets to about 50%-60%
health, the raid leader will give the command to the nuker group to open up.
<p>
<B>Tanks</B> - Dish out as much damage as possible.  Don't fight defensively.  Text
can lag significantly.  So, if you find yourself getting hit by Nagafen a 
couple times in a row, or if you get to 50% health, back out immediately
for a heal.  If your cleric is dead or has called OOM, run back to the 
buff group for a heal.  Make a hot key that says <i>"/shout XXXX coming back
for heal"</i> and hit it so they know you're coming and not just feared.  
<p>
<B>Bards</B> - Don't fight.  Take out your instruments and keep the group's Fire
and Magic resistances up.  This is the biggest contribution you can make.
<p>
<B>Clerics</B> - Heal.  Heal some more.
<p>
<B>Wizards</B> - Hang back at the turn until it's time for the nuke groups.  Don't
call attention to yourself by casting.  When the time comes, run in and 
chain cast Ice Comet.  You must be in melee range to cast!
<p>
<B>Mages</B> - Stay out of range of the AE spell.  Send in your Fire pet.  Resummon
as needed.
<p>
<B>Necromancers</B> - Stay out of range of the AE spell.  Send in your pet.
Resummon as needed.
<p>
<B>Enchanters</B> - Stay out of range of the AE spell.  /assist off Nagafen and Rune IV
the tanks.
<p>
<B>Druids/Shamen in Tank Group</B> - You are healers.  Stay out of range of the AE 
spell if you can.  Heal your folks, including the cleric.
<p>
<B>Druids/Shamen in Buff Group</B> - Hang back at the first turn and heal any 
tanks who come running back for heals.  Heal clerics
who need it.  If the fight is going very well, when the time for nuking
comes, shaman run up and cast your ice-based spells.  You must be in melee
range to cast on Nagafen.
