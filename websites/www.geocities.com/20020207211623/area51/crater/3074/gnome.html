<P>Hail follower of Innoruuk, it is with the help of our father that your frail mind shall harness the pure power of hate. Many have fallen in there weak attempts at controlling this power, and as such our father has instructed me to guide you in your quest to rid the world of Love and Mercy.</P>
<P>Death and Decay are now your greatest allie and it is with these allies, that destruction will come to those that attempt to stop you from completing your quest.</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P>Like all Necromancers, Intelligence is your most important aspect of your character. The game also tells you that Dexterity is Important but I don't see why when your pets will be doing most of the fighting aspect.</P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P> </P>
<P>It starts:</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P>It is my Belief that the gnome is one the hardest of the races to play. Only Erudite being more difficult. </P>
<P>Reason Why:</P>
<P>No one will buy or sell to you, with the exception of your guild who do not carry food or water. Few people playing this race means that there are few people that will buy equipment for you. As a dark elf it is great to be a Necromancer so you can buy and sell at your leisure, since NPC's like you. Being a human Necromancer there are plenty of souls playing your race that will buy for you.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>In the beginning you equipped with 2 spells, minor shielding and Life Tap, Guild Note, PvP note, a dagger, 5 food and 5 water. Store that PvP Note for later. Scribe and memorize your spell and read your guild note.</P>
<P>Your Guild is located in the basement in Ak'kon from your starting location you must circle the large pool of water headin on the rightside soon you will reach a steep decent and when you hit the botton there will be maze of passages, this is the basement. your guild is located in here, the basement is not very big and there are plenty of rock snakes to stab to get experance along the way.  Hand your guild note to your master and he will reward you with a robe and some Experience. Now you're suggested weapon of choice will be 2 handed blunt (for your staff). But for now use your 5 training points on Piercing to be used with your starting dagger.</P>
<P> </P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>Into the Fray:</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P>Now equip your robe and dagger, cast minor shielding and head out to Steamfront Mountains. Note: alot of people say that the basement is easiest to start out in, but I like to start making money and collecting bone chips as early as possible. </P>
<P>The newbie grounds can sometimes be hard to find to a new player as it is not right outside the gate. Once you walk out the gate, turn 45 degrees to the left and you will see a valley follow the road that is in the valley. The road will soon end and you have entered the newbie grounds. Start killin off all the rats in the area and keep an eye out for decaying gnome skeletons, as they will be your bread and butter for a long time.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>Combat:</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P>Even the rats may be giving you trouble so here are some keys to battle:</P>
<P>1. ALWAYS have your minor shielding on. You need all the AC and HP you can.</P>
<P>2. Cast Life Tap right after your target swings at you. This will lead to fewer interruptions and will keep you healed while doing damage to your target.</P>
<P>3. Don't be afraid to run back to the guards if you cannot finish off the battle. Gnomes can run faster then almost anything you may encounter. (Jump if you need alittle extra speed).</P>
<P>4. Dying is part of learning you don't lose anything until you hit level 4 so when you die just run back to your body and pick up your loot and continue fighting.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>Level I:</P>
<P>Recommended Spells to Buy ASAP (In order):</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ff0000"><P>Cavorting Bones</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff">: First Pet</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ff0000"><P>Siphon Strength</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff">: Steals Strength adds to yours.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ff0000"><P>Disease Cloud</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff">: Disease Target</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P>In no time you will reach level 1, it is time to head back to Ak'kon to sell your rat parts and buy your first pet spell. Cavorting Bones is the name of the spell another one to pick up is Disease Cloud. These two spells will greatly enhance your abilities.</P>
<P>After you buy your new spells inscribe and memorize them and head back to newbie land. To summon your pet you will need some bone chips. (Cavorting bones requires only one bone chip, other's require more.)</P>
<P>You can find these on the gnome skeletons you find on the newbie grounds. Summon your pet and start taking on Decaying Gnome Skeletons and Kabold Runts, Don't forget to kill the rats you still gain experience and you need the rat parts to sell for money. Your pet is very weak (it is level one spell) so you will have to team up to kill off targets, or you will lose your pets very often. Some gnome skeletons carry rusty or worn weapons now you can give these to your pet to use but it is a better idea to wait until you get your stronger pet. </P>
<P>Soon you will come across a gnome skeleton with a staff kill it, and then equip your first staff (Worn Great Staff) from level one to level 3 put all your Bonus points into 2 handed blunt.</P>
<P>Continue this way until you reach level 4.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>Level 4: </P>
<P>Recommend Spells to Buy ASAP (in order):</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ff0000"><P>Leering Corpse</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff">: Much stronger pet then your 1st one.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ff0000"><P>Poison Bolt</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff">: Opening spell: damage over the coarse of battle</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ff0000"><P>Clinging Darkness</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff">: Slows targets and does damage over time.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ff0000"><P>Life Spike</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff">: More powerful version of Life Tap.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ff0000"><P>Fear</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff">: Makes NPC's run away.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P>This is when you begin to come into your own. You are now able to use your next level pet, Leering Corpse and have access too much more useful spells. Make sure you spend One bonus point to learn Meditation, this will go up very fast as it is used between battles. (The meditation tap is in you spell book use it to regain mana faster).</P>
<P>Now head back to the newbie grounds and go summon your new pet give him a weapon of choice (2 handed sword and Morning star's work best). And say "/pet guard me" and your pet will run around killin anything that comes near you rats, spiderlings, kabolb runts and gnome skeletons. Use your magic if you like but your pet should be able to destroy most everything there with ease. When he get low on health say "/pet back off" and then say "/pet follow me" and you wait until he is healed then have him guard again. Your will level extremely fast this way and all you have to do is loot the corpse's. </P>
<P>After this the world is your oyster every 3 levels you get a newer stronger pet and more interesting and devastating spells.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>General Advice:</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P>1. Get to know your spells and their usefulness don't have spells that are useless memorized, they just take up space that could be used for better spells.</P>
<P>2. Know your pets Limitation's a Level 4 pet cannot kill off more then 3 or 4 spiderlings at a time.</P>
<P>3. Don't enter a town with a pet with you. Tell your pet to "/pet guard here" then go into the guard zone.</P>
<P>4. Keep an eye on your pet's life nothing sucks worse then having your pet die carrying a 2 handed sword because you lose your weapon when it dies.</P>
<P>5. Know when and how to help you're pet. You have the spells to take a creature down to a shell of its former self. Casting the right spells can make a kabolb into a kabolb runt in no time.</P>
