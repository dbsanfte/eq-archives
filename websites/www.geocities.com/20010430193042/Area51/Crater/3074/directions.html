 </P>
<P>Upon entering the superb city carved out of living rock by my illustrious ancestors you first see the magnificent mural of skulls emitting a strange green light. I doubt that mere humans or the other races can truly appreciate the brilliance of our work. Stand in awe and recognize a race far superior to any that Norrath has ever known. The city is very complex to the simpleminded. There are many secret passages and several paths to the same destination. It was designed to befuddle the smaller brains and inferior vision of our enemies. That is, until we realized how little we have to fear from the lower species. Moss snakes, humans...all are vermin to us. </P>
<P>The gateway to Neriak leads to the Foreign Quarter. Humans can go into the Foreign Quarter of Neriak but not into the Commons or 3rd gate. </P>
<P>Turn left or right at the wall of green skulls to enter the Foreign Quarter. On this level travellers will find food at Diana’s Bread N’ Butcher or clothes at the Silk Underground. Stronger sustenance is found at the taverns here. An ugly human wench sells backpacks and other cheap baubles in the clearing beside The Smuggler’s Inn tavern alongside a short runt of a merchant with a selection of footwear. The tunnel past the Silk Underground leads to Neriak Commons. </P>
<B><P>Commons</B><BR>
 </P>
<P>Upon entering you will be in a cavernous room with a waterfall on the right. Swimming in Neriak can have some surprises. Look for the underwater windows into the Blind Fish Tavern. Go right and down the ramp into the doorway at the bottom. The next room has two symbols of a face with tongue hanging out flanking a sun symbol. # The significance of these symbols is far beyond the comprehension of other races or even the young dark elves so I will refrain from attempting to explain. Simply understand that they are evidence of a race that lives on a much higher spiritual plane than any other and feel blessed to be allowed to walk on these ancient stones. 
<P> </P>
<P>Going through the wooden gate under the sun, straight through, up and down the ramp, under the star then through the wooden gate under the sun symbol brings you to a room with a tongue symbol under a sun symbol. A wooden gate to the left as you face the symbols leads to Adamant Armor. Turning left takes you past BF (Blue Flame). This shop contains the finest weapons and armor worn by our legendary Shadow Knights. I need not tell you what a superior fighting class they are. Neriak Down Under is on the left. The bank, a food store and a jewellery store are in this complex. Turning right at Adamant Armor leads you to Forge House past another entrance to Neriak Down Under, the Dashing Form clothing then to the warrior’s guild. On your right will be the House of Q’ABTM, the Toadstool Tavern and the Bleek Fletcher. There are many other shops on this level. Several have sewing kits and patterns as well as leather armor to fit the delicate frames of our elegant people. The entrance to 3rd Gate is opposite another of our astonishing statues. This one is of a man and is set in a fountain. Two suns flank the entrance. Go through the open doorway with wooden doors on each side to enter 3rd Gate. </P>
<B><P>3rd Gate</B><BR>
You pass right through another tongue symbol to enter a cavern with a crystal building decorated with 5 tongue symbols. This is the Cleric’s Guild. Go right, not entering the building, following the ledge above a moat. When you are at the back of the crystal building, go in the doorway facing the back of the building. You'll be in a breathtaking room with a waterfall surrounding a sacred red eye symbol in the middle. Go in the opening to the right. Pass through the curving hallway ending in a ramp. At the bottom of the ramp will be a room with a sun in the middle with a wooden gate. There are tongues on each side and open fires. Go through the wooden gate. The next room has sun, tongue and hand symbols over doorways. Go under the sun symbol. The next room has stairs to what the ignorant have described as a rabbit eared symbol. It is the library. Go around the stairs to the right and through a doorway with an eye symbol over it. When you come out of the doorway you will have a tongue symbol on left, a bridge and swimming figure on right. Facing the tongue will be a doorway with stones that look like teeth in an open mouth and ghouls. Be not afraid if you are a new Shadow Knight or Necromancer for a great reward lies within. The ghouls recognize a kindred soul and will not harm you Go through into a tunnel. When you emerge you'll see a red pagoda like building. Go down the ramp and straight in. In the center on the main floor are the necromancer and Shadow Knight trainers. The spell merchants are on the same floor at the back of the building. </P>
<P>If you do not go past the library but go under the hand symbol you will come to the Rogue’s Guild in a building with a griffin statue out front.</FONT><<P> </P>
