FIRST: Is NO Idiots. We don't want money grubbers, those who are just in the guild to get something from people, or are argumentative just for the sake of being the opposite of everyone. Please watch out for topics that make people cranky or edgy. Discussions are great, just don't be rude about it.
<BR><P>
SECOND: We are NOT into KS'ing, ninja looting, begging, or training onto people. General bad EQ behavior is not acceptable. 
<BR><P>
THIRD: As we are a growing guild and don't quite have the numbers yet, it would be appreciated that if you get invited into a Planes or Dragon raid, that you do your best to get the other high levels into the raid with you (or as many of us as possible). Alliance's with Guilds has helped with this, but any raid invites are always appreciated.
<BR><P>
FOURTH: As we are trying to be a friendly guild, please be courteous to others in the guild. Don't continually beg for stuff, money or items. If someone asks for help and you are bored out of your skull, please go to their aid. Keep in mind though, that if people ARE busy, not to bug them for gates, rez's, sows, and whatnot. When we get free, we can come and get you, rez you or whatever.
<BR><P>
FIFTH: Is that as we gain those experienced in tailoring, smithing, pottery, whatever, that if you ask for something, that you don't expect it for free. There are costs to making the higher end stuff. For those making it, please don't charge through the roof. 
<BR><P>
SIXTH: Any new inductees into the Guild will undergo a trial period. After that it will be up to a general consensus of the Guild, as well as the invited if they are to stay. 

<BR><P>
SEVENTH: Is that the general Raid rule is that those who need it are in the loto's first. If noone needs it, then all are in on the loto. Once you have an item, you are excluded from the following loto's until everyone has something. Then it starts again.
