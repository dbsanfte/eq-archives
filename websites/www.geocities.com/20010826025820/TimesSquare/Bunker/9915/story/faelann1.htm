  <p align="left"><b>Hi!<br>
    Last night started out a difficult one in Norrath. I had a disaster with Faelanna. 
    She got stuck in a bug INSIDE a rock and Had to wait for 20 minutes for a 
    Guide to save her and through a very Frusterating misunderstanding, DIED for 
    the 5th time that night!!! :(<br>
    I left the game furious and took a break. I am glad I returned because i had 
    the second weirdest night in EQ I have ever had.<br>
    I created a level 1 necro to locate a corpse in lavastorm and when I went 
    to purchase the locate corpse spell who shoulud be standing there next to 
    the merchant but non other then Clitoriss herself! <br>
    Being dumbstruck and disbelieving I naturally called everyone in the zone 
    to come and reenforce that I wasnt hallucinating. I also sent a few tells 
    to friends and the guide I had just had dealins with :)<br>
    All in all we determined that she was an NPC but she was Attack-proof (I attacked 
    her), you could use emotes with her (much to the embarrassment of everyone 
    heheeh) and when you hailed her, her full name was returned to you. ( Hail 
    Clitoriss)The Guides assured us she was NOT a GM and that they had never heard 
    of anything like this before:) <br>
    My theory is Verant was hacked and she was installed:) But We shall see:) 
    The guides were very apologetic-unnecessarily- and very Nice about the whole 
    thing hehe. It was hilarious and suitably got me emotionally over my night's 
    loss of 3 bubbles of XP.<br>
    I am hoping to hear the real story about how and why this occured. If I find 
    anything I will let you know. <br>
    I have included a few screenshots and will eventually post them on the website 
    as my second weirdest night in EQ.<br>
    <br>
    Thanks:) -Faelanna of Prexus <br>
