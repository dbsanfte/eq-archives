Collect the whole set! At any rate, nobody to my knowledge has yet found a purpose for them. As one of them is called or identified as (can't remember) 'an icy mug', I think the possibilities for an as-yet unknown quest connection are quite exciting. In fact, all of the mugs identify as something a bit different (such as 'a cracked mug half full'). Very interesting indeed!&nbsp; <br><br>Corudoth can be found under a chunk of ice at approximately -6000,+6000 in Iceclad. If you tell him that he &quot;owes Helssen&quot; he will deny owing Helssen anything. Handing him the tablet from Noble Helssen in Kael (the quest I mentioned), however, will change his tune: <br><br></span></font><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:14">Corudoth curses and goes into a fit of frustration before finally giving in. The ancient sea turtle finally says, 'Fine. I dont know what Helssen wants with that but I know where you can find it. Years and years back I traveled with what was called the Icy Mugs. We were a mercenary company out for fun and profit, and there was plenty of that. During our adventures we ran across a great many foes. <br><br>You say, 'what great foes' <br><br>Corudoth says 'Yes. One of note was the vile and evil sorcerer Rosh. A better example of depravtity and anti-morality I cannot think of. He researched magics destined to end all life on this cold chunk of rock and snow. We made it our mission to destroy him. In the end we defeated him, but alas our friend and comrade was slain. Poor Abrams was left cursed forever to wander that spire of ultimate loathing, the Tower of Frozen Shadow. <br><br>You say, 'who is abrams' <br><br>Corudoth says 'Abrams was a brave warrior and a good friend. His great maul could always be counted on to strike true as he used his body to shield others from greivous wounds. He sacrificed himself to save us from the eternal suffering he now endures up in that dark tower. The book you now seek, is in his possesion. You must first destroy his tormented form to free him from his madness. Tell him you seek the Arcanum and then give him the lock of hair I just gave you. You also will need the key? <br><br>You say, 'what key' <br><br>Corudoth says 'We ambushed Rosh on an expedition into the cursed Tower. When we faced him, Abrams ran forward and grabbed the Arcanum. He held it to his chest as lightning and flame rained down upon him. With Rosh busy trying to save his book it gave Petcas and I enough time to strike Rosh down. We went to Abrams and found our friend left a smoking pile of Coldain ruin. He underwent a strange transformation in which the Arcanum was lost. We decided Petcas should keep the key. <br><br>You say, 'who is Petcas?' <br><br>Corudoth says 'Petcas has retired from the life of an adventurer as I have. I would not tell you where he is as he is a good friend, but what I owe Helssen is stronger than comraderie or even friendship so I must comply; it is the word of Veeshan. Petcas now owns a small bar in the Coldain city of Thurgadin. To get the key you must fight your way into the city and kill Petcas. I wish you a most horrendous death Dark Elf. Now leave me to my sleep. <br></span></font><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"><br>Petcas can be found in a building just to the right of the Thurgadin zone when facing out from Icewell Keep. Abrams ghost can be found on the sixth floor of the Tower of Frozen Shadow. <br><br>Unfortuantely, the NPC in Kael who initiated the quest that Corudoth was part of (Noble Helssen) has been temporarily removed from the game, and at last try, I have been unable to trigger Corudoth into repeating his text, without first having given him the quest item required from Noble Helssen. And since this item is (to my knowledge) not a loot item, but also requires something be given to receive it, we may never know anything further on this until Noble Helssen is returned to his home in Kael and the quest can be initiated again.<br><br><br><br><br></span></font><b><i><font face="Arial" size="-1"><span style="font-size:12">Page updated: 06/05/01</span></font></b></i><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"><br></span></font><i><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:14"><br></span></font></i><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:14"><br><br></span></font></td>
