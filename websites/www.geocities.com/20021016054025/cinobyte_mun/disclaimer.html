<p>Although many of you may be fooled, Everquest is not my creation. <A HREF="http://www.everquest.com">EVERQUEST</a> is a product of Sony and Verant. And a very good product indeed (Insert More Ass-Kissing here). The diaries of Mumferd are only loosely based on characters and adventures within the game. 
<p> -I did do all the art though. Cause I'm cool like that.-
<p> I would also like to point out that spell casting while drunk is not as easy as Mumferd makes it sound. I do not recommend it. 
<p> <blink>You have been warned.</blink>
