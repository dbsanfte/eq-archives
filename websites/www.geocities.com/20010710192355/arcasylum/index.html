<b>July 4, 2001</b> - Talcea got her epic pig poker, congrats.
<br><br>
<b>July 1, 2001</b> - Yina got her cleric stick, congrats.
<br><br>
<b>May 29, 2001</b> - Please welcome Dalmon, Lurna (bard- think I forgot to mention the 
initiate stage :P), and Vivica as full members.  New initiates are Doctah (cleric), 
Aktu (wizard - bother him after he is a full member for rides), 
Larzuk (warrior), Universal (monk), Llaily (cleric), Lugan (necro) and Tilelor (witchdoctor).
<br><br>
<b>May 17, 2001</b> - New stepchildren - Welcome our initiates - Dalmon (Warrior) and Vivica (Rogue)
<br><br>
<b>May 16, 2001</b> - We have added something to our charter and rules of conduct.  It was always kindof understood, but just wanted to spell it out specifically.  You are responsible for everything that your character does whether you are the current driver or not.  People only see your character's name and everything that you do is a reflection on our guild.  Basically, you let some friend that is also a jerk (hey, jerks have friends too) use your account and they do something that reflects on AA, it is your fault for letting that friend use your character.
<br><br>
<b>May 16, 2001</b> - No longer step-children - Please welcome our new full members: Ninjha, Ryltar, Adaldan, Toldar, Iyena, Talee, and Nasferatu.
<br><br>
<b>May 4, 2001</b> - New recruit - Adaldan, 51 warrior, please welcome our new initiate.
<br><br>
<b>May 3, 2001</b> - Kvasir has been demoted to the Arcane Council and is our newest officer.  Guess we needed some Dr00d influence.  Please welcome Iyena and Talee to our family as our newest initiates.
<br><br>
<b>May 1, 2001</b> - Hold on to your butts, 2 news items in one day.  I just added the join page too.  Hopefully I will change this to a form when I get more time, but for now this will have to do.
<br><br>
<b>May 1, 2001</b> - Finally got around to doing a link page.  If you want to add a link, send it to <a href="mailto:ArcaneAsylum@aol.com">ArcaneAsylum@aol.com</a>.  Please write a brief description, we don't want to think them up.
<br><br>
<b>April 30, 2001</b> - This has been a good month for growth.  Please welcome Kruel as a full member.  
Flubbie, Ryltar, Nasferatu, and Toldar are our current initiates.  Apresia and Chaszm are now officers and Apresia has 
been given the ever passing title of event planner.  Over the next month look for regular raids.
<br><br>
<b>Mar 30, 2001</b> - New roster at guildmagic.com has been added.  This is a self serve guild roster.  
So get your lazy arse out there and add your characters.
Someone will have to actually accept your character into our guild roster, don't be suprised if you don't show up 
immediately.  If you have done it for awhile and you still haven't shown
up, give Faril a nasty tell.
<br><br>
<b>Mar 23, 2001</b> - There are some new faces in the guild, make sure to make them feel welcome.  
Read the forums for more info on who and what.
