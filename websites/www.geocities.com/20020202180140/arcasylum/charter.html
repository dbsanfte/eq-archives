		<font size=4>Once a band of Mercenaries called "Dark underground" , they wandered all of 
		Norrath fighting evil and spreading their ideals of loyalty, friendship, 
		and truth. The mercenaries were accused of insanity for holding onto such 
		ideals in such dark and evil times. This ever vigilant group grasped the 
		accusations of insanity and became "Arcane Asylum" 
		<br><br>
		Arcane Asylum now continues its battle against evil. Their numbers grow 
		larger daily as others seemingly develop the same "insane" ideals 
		<br><br>
		Beware Norrath , The Asylum has been unleashed upon the lands and shall not 
		be ignored.

		<b>Loot rules</b>
		<br><br>
		There are alot of beliefs about looting policies and the guild will not 
		dictate how loot is divided amongst groups but will stand on a general 
		looting policy. A group is free to adopt an alternative looting method. 
		<br><br>
		Lotto's in camps are to be handled at the discretion of those grouped. The 
		group leader is responsible to identify the loot method used. The group 
		leader is also responsible to inform any person joining the group of the used 
		loot method. 
		<br><br>
		The most logical loot policy for the guild is "need before greed". Present 
		usable classes should be first to lotto for any items . The guild also hopes 
		that any non-useable items will be considered for fellow guild members for 
		purchase or as a gift.
		<br><br>
		It is also the responsibility of any group member to ask about the loot policy
		that is being followed in any group they are part of.  Find out the looting before you 
		get to something that is of importance. If you have a problem with looting, the 
		character with that problem should pursue the resolution of that problem through 
		the proper channels.  Depending on the problem, they should
		contact an officer of the guild, an officer of the loot-whoring member's guild, and possibly a GM. 
		<br><br><br>
		<b>Conduct</b><br><br>
		The guild is for the purpose of providing a enjoyable enhancement to 
		Everquest. Each member will act in a respectful manner to all other members. 
		Members are not required to be the best of friends but are required to 
		respect , aid and look out for each other. Grudges will not be tolerated and 
		any disputes will be solved , nothing will be left unfinished. Hopefully any 
		disputes can be settled between the affected parties quietly and between 
		themselves as adults. Any dispute that cannot be resolved in this manner will 
		be taken to the Arcane Council. It is the involved parties responsibility to 
		involve the council . 
		<br><br>
		No member will abuse another member in any way. General overuse of profanity 
		in guildchat and groupchat or direct tells , unwanted suggestive comments , 
		begging , etc. is considered abuse . As soon as a member tells another member 
		to "please stop" , any continuation is considered abuse. 
		<br><br>
		You are responsible for everything that your character does regardless of whether 
		or not you are the actual person playing that character at the time.  Your character
		is a member of our guild and that is all that people see.
		<br><br>
		Any abuse will be reported immediately to a member of the Council and said 
		Council member is to deal with the matter in a timely manner. Any action 
		taken by the Council is to also be reported to the other council members and 
		to the Arcane Lord.
