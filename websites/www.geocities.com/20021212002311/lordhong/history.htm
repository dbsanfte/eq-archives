  Eternity</font></h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Knights of Eternity is a guild of friendship, sharing, 
  fun, and family. These principles are our guides. Let us follow them to honor 
  and glory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are friends. We work together, play together, laugh together, 
  fight together, and occasionally, we die together. Each one of us cares how 
  the other feels, considers those feelings at all times, and supports the well 
  being of each other, as well as of ourselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We share. We give to each other of our food, our equipment, 
  our knowledge, our skills, our resources, and our time. We expect nothing in 
  return, but we receive the support of our friends when our own time of need 
  arises. Not one of us feels they are owed anything. We all give freely of ourselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have fun. None of us prevents any other from having fun. 
  None of us have fun at another's expense. We enjoy each other's company, but 
  do not restrict the fun of anyone. If one of us must leave to another place, 
  and that causes another to find another source of fun, it is not held against 
  anyone. There is no place here for grudges, they are not fun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are a family. Each is the brother and the sister of the 
  other. We do not hurt our family. We heal when we can. We defend when there 
  is need, even at the loss of our own lives. There is no greater glory then to 
  share honor with our family. There is no greater service then giving our life 
  for our family. There is no greater joy then knowing our family is there for 
  us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are the Knights of Eternity. The infinite horizon is 
  our realm. The infinite stars are our destiny. With these principles of friendship, 
  sharing, fun, and family, we shall<br>
  certainly prevail.</p>

<h2><font color="#003366">A Member's Perspective:</font></h2>
<p>&quot;By serving each other, we become free for all eternity.&quot;</p>
<p>Norrath: a vast world, containing many lands, people and conflict. A world 
  in trouble and enslaved to itself. Selfishness is destroying our world. Selfishness 
  of the individual, selfishness of the races, has put the world of Norrath in 
  peril.</p>
<p>The Knights of Eternity represent folks from all lands, races and classes. 
  It is our desire to insure the survival of Norrath. By rising above ourselves 
  and overlooking each others differences, there is hope for our lands. By serving 
  each other, we become free for all eternity.</p>
<p>Here you will find Dark Elves helping Wood Elves, Paladins fighting with Necromancers 
  and Clerics healing Shadow Knights. Join us in our quest, our Ever Quest, to 
  free you and the world of Norrath for all eternity.</p>
