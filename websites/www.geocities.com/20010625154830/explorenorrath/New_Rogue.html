If you have interest in genuinely playing this class, please see </span></font><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselibraryreadonly.showMessage?topicID=3.topic"><font color="#990000" face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">The Safehouse</span></font></a><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> or </span></font><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com"><font color="#990000" face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Allakhazam</span></font></a><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> for tips on how to build the most effective rogue for long-term play. I don't have to point out that, even if you never plan to level your rogue, sneak/hide is invaluable for using to help pull your party's corpses out of most areas (and save yourselves the cost of coffins), as well as to scope out unfamiliar areas before you begin hunting there with your main, to get comfortable with the zone first. A word of warning: With the advent of Kunark and now Velious, many zones don't allow the luxury of exploring with a lowbie rogue anymore, since quite a number of the newer mobs thumb their nose at the sneak/hide ability.<br><br></span></font><i><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">For both the sneak and hide abilities, I recommend you keep them hotkeyed so that you may practice and increase your skill while travelling or making a couple of initial levels to aid in your exploration.</span></font></i><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"><br><br></span></font><b><u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Sneak:</span></font></b></u><b><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> </span></font></b><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> As I understand it, sneak by itself is only useful when moving fairly out of line-of-sight on mobs. It gives you a greater probability of moving past them. Rogues get this ability at different levels, depending on your choice of race. For exploration purposes when chosing your race, see hints listed by various zones of exploration on the </span></font><a href="index.html"><font color="#990000" face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">main page</span></font></a><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">. In general, you'll want the race that gets sneak at the lowest level, so you spend less time levelling to get the ability, and more time exploring (with the caveat that sometimes religion availability for the race will come into play, as with </span></font><a href="The_Hole.html"><font color="#990000" face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">The Hole</span></font></a><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">, and also, for adventuring, you will always want not only sneak but the ability to combine it with the 'hide' skill). As a rogue, you will know your attempt to sneak was successful when you get the text: 'You are as quiet as a cat stalking its prey'. Otherwise, you'll get a message that says: 'You are as quiet as a herd of running elephants'. This means your sneak was not successful, and you will need to try it again when the skill button refreshes.<br><br></span></font><b><u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Hide:</span></font></b></u><b><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> </span></font></b><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Many elven races get this as a race attribute at level one, but all rogues get it at one point or another. Hide is a form of invisibility, but </span></font><i><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">used on its own, it does not allow you to move and remain invisible</span></font></i><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">. As a rogue, you'll know your hide is successful if you get the text: 'You have successfully hidden yourself from view'. If you do not get this mesage, you'll get one that says: 'You failed to hide yourself.' This means your hide was not successful, and you will need to retry it. NOTE: Your skill button for hide will not refresh on its own if your first attempt was not a success. You will need to toggle it (message: 'You are no longer hidden' or 'You stop hiding.') before it will refresh on its own for you to reinitiate. Be sure to do this or you'll be waiting a long time to re-attempt a hide.<br></span></font><b><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"><br></span></font></b><b><u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Using Sneak/Hide Together:</span></font></b></u><b><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> </span></font></b><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">This is really where the biggest advantage to making your newbie explorer a rogue will come into play. When used together, sneak/hide not only lets you move invisibly among most mobs, but unlike normal invisibility, once you initiate a successful sneak/hide, it is not random duration. There are very few reasons once you are in sneak/hide that you will lose it. Now granted, I have never levelled a rogue very high, so there may be instances in which you will lose your hidden status for some other reason. However, I have explored the Hole, Guk, Sol B, Karnor and City of Mist as a newbie without this ever happening to me (save for some mobs in Karnor that see through sneak/hide, as well as Efreeti Djorn in Sol B). Instances I know that will pop sneak/hide:<br></span></font><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:14"> &nbsp;&nbsp; - The mob sees through it; this happens more in Kunark/Velious than in Norrath<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Someone casts levitation on you. This will pop your sneak/hide<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - You zone, camp, go linkdead. You can't enter the game with sneak/hide in place<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - You accidentally hit your attack hotkey. This pops hide just like it pops invisibility.</span></font><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"><br><br>Some have told me that you must get a successful hide first, and THEN sneak, for them to work properly, but I have done it both ways and it does not appear to matter. Feel free to post or </span></font><a href="http://julynn_bb@hotmail.com"><font color="#990000" face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">email</span></font></a><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> if this is not the case, and help me clear up the facts. At any rate, while standing still once you are in the zone you want to explore, initiate one of the skills until you get a success with it. Then, without moving, initiate the other until it's a success (you will not lose the first status while attempting the second skill). <br><br>When your second skill is a success as well, congratulations! You may now move like a phantom through the zone. Unfortunately, this would have to be approximately a 700-pound phantom... until level 60, you will not move at full speed when using sneak/hide. This means your lowbie will seem quite slow. This can be counteracted by having spirit of wolf cast upon you (having it cast on you after you are hidden does not appear to disrupt sneak/hide anymore); if you'll be exploring a dungeon where sow cannot be cast inside, you might want to get one before heading in. Additionally, if you are exploring with a partner, you will want to ask someone for a 'see invisibility' buff, since sneak/hide will make you unable to see other party members.<br><br></span></font><u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">A couple of other comments on things you will encounter:</span></font></u><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"><br></span></font><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">- Swimming: This works just fine with sneak/hide. Bear in mind you must already be in sneak/hide mode before you enter the water. Also, since you will be a low-level, and VERY slow in sneak mode anyway, enduring breath and sow are highly recommended, to prevent you from drowning yourself.<br>- Levitation: As stated above, this buff will pop your sneak/hide.<br>- Invisibility: If someone tries to cast this on you while hidden, they'll get a 'bounce' message. However, I am not certain whether the attempt pops your hide or not, so I would recommend against it unless you are using it to travel to your destination and want to get there quicker than sneak allows.<br>- Falling: Minor falls do not appear to break sneak/hide thus far in my experiments. However, bear in mind you are a low level and have very few hit points, so a hit point buff to keep you alive during potential stumbles or unseen dungeon pits is recommended.<br>- Binding: When possible, get a bind near the dungeon you're exploring. Seeing new things is quite additictive, and though you may die (you won't care at level 3 or so, that's the beauty of it), you can easily get right back in there and try a different route, if you are bound close enough. Nonstop fun!</span></font><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:14"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><br></span></font><b><i><font face="Arial" size="-1"><span style="font-size:12">Page Updated: 01/24/01<br></span></font></b></i></td>
