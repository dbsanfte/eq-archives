<div align="center"><h3>The Lone Hunter-Gatherer</h3><p>by Dragonbane</p></div>
	<p>He trudged slowly up the slope of the mountain, returning from his journey to Hillsfar.  Thoron carried little in his backpack, as he had traded most of his goods earlier.  It had been a good year, of that there was no doubt.</p>
	<p>As he reached one of the many peaks, he glanced toward the horizon.  The sun was setting on the other side of the Great Mountain in another picturesque sunset, which was <i>The People's</i> daily fare.</p>
	<p>As he climbed, his thoughts drifted towards his home, his fire and his family.  Good memories, they were.  He could see himself home later the next day, a warm welcome made all the better by the copper axe that he had acquired in exchange for some of his arrows earlier the day before.  Hillsfar was a good two day trek from his home of Sulasspryn, on the other side of the mountains.  However, not even the distance deterred the arrow-makers of Sulasspryn from trading with their neighbors.</p>
	<p>This year had been quite profitable, he mused, his hand running along the haft of his axe and lovingly caressing the head.  Oh, how he longed to use it again.  He had thrown it before the price of twenty arrows had been agreed upon, and how it flew!  He had thrown the lightweight axe a good twenty paces into a small sapling, the sharp copper blade splitting it easily in two from his powerful throw.</p>
	<p>He jerked back into reality when he noticed a pair of squirrels scurrying around the base of a nearby tree, part of a circle of oaks living precariously this high up on the slope.  He had left the treeline a short time ago, and had not seen any immense amount of growth for a while now.  He drew the axe out of it's sheathing and with a quick flick of his wrist and a powerful movement of his arm let the gleaming weapon fly.</p>
	<p>The axe flew true, striking the squirrel in the midsection and pinning him to the base of the oak tree.  The animal's companion squeaked once, then fled rapidly up another tree, disappearing into the branches.</p>
	<p>Thoron grunted, amused.  A hot meal tonight, he thought.  He quickly retrieved his axe and, gathering up the squirrel, continued down the trail, which at this point had begun its descent down the other side of the mountain.</p>
	<p>Soon, it began to grow dark.  Thoron looked around for a good place to set up his camp.  Farther down the mountainside, he noticed a depression that was formed by two walls of rock on either side.  &quot;Fine place for a fire,&quot; he thought.  Upon reaching his destination, he surveyed his new, albeit temporary, home.  The grassy path upon which he was treading ran straight through the shelter provided by two walls of solid bedrock.  One wall had a rocky out cropping with a hard, rocky floor, perfect for a fire.  The other wall turned out to be a small protrusion from the ground, making a fine stone wall on one side to keep the passerby safe from the fifteen foot drop on the other.</p>
	<p>&quot;Firewood, water,&quot; thought he, as he left his campsite and began his descent into the forest, which was some small distance away.  He returned with the firewood, took out his flint and struck it against his steel, creating a veritable blaze in a short while.  The squirrel soon found itself spitted on a thin stick that Thoron had found for that very purpose.</p>
	<p>After dinner, when it had grown sufficiently dark, Thoron laid down, removing his tunic, rolling it and placing it under his head as a pillow.  His thought lingered on his family and the many things this winter would bring as he drifted off to sleep just outside of the alcove, not noticing the chill on the wind nor the first soft white tears strike the ground as consciousness slipped away.

<div align="center"><h3>The Trouble with Tunneling</h3><p>Ian Sylvanis (a.k.a.  Steve C. - conquers@hotmail.com)</p></div>
<p>(an account of his first real adventure)</p>
<P>He walked through the forest, oblivious of the cold wind passing through the
trees.  This winter seemed especially harsh.  Food was not as plentiful as it
had been during the summer.  Apprentice for only a few scant months, Ian had
been sent out to gather firewood for his Master.  &quot;Too wet, too wet.  None of
this wood will do.&quot;  Muttering to himself as he went along.
</p><p>Finally, finding some good, dry wood for his Master, Ian continued back home
undaunted.  Snow began to fall as he strolled along the path that he often used
to get wood.  In a few scant minutes, the light snow turned into a howling
blizzard.  
</p><p>Ian quickly lost his way through the woods.  Never being in a true blizzard
before, Ian had no idea what he should do.  Dropping the wood, he began to run
through the forest.  Branches snapped as he ran blindly through the wind and
snow.  
</p><p>After running for what seemed to be days, Ian finally spotted a light in the
distance.  Running and yelling, he proceeded toward the light undaunted...only
to realize his mistake at the last minute.  The light, a magical fire, had been
set at this spot to warn people traveling this way through the woods of a
crevasse tens of feet wide and deeper than any ever encountered.
</p><p>A strange sense assailed Ian as he tumbled through the darkness of the crevasse
along with hundreds of pounds of snow.  He felt as if he was flying.  Flying the
wrong way.  Down.  The last thing Ian remembered before passing out was the
Feather Fall spell that he cast.
</p><p>Hours...days...years.  How long had he been lying in the snow?  Amazed that he
survived the fall alive, Ian stood up.  Everything was encased in a cloak of
darkness.  Quickly casting a light spell, Ian looked around...and was nearly
blinded by the light coming from the walls.  Dulling the light spell to only a
twinkle, Ian peered at the walls.  They appeared to be made of a crystal
substance.  Diamonds!  Tens of thousands of diamonds were encased in the walls! 
Looking about, he spotted a passage leading to his left.
</p><p>&quot;Where am I?&quot;  His question went unanswered.  Figuring his best bet was to
continue on, he turned to his left and began to walk.  Two hours passed before
he reached a spot where the tunnel began to expand.  Diamonds still encrusted
both walls, but seemed to be getting larger.  And larger diamonds must mean he'd
been traveling farther and farther down.  
</p><p>Ian continued to walk for another hour when the tunnel opened into a well-lit
room.  And in the middle of this room was a thing that terrified all races.  A
being of such unimaginable terror that all who had a good head about their
shoulders ran from.  A creature that could shake mountains to their very core. 
A being that had the power to destroy whole towns.  But all as an accident.  The
creature standing in the middle of the room was none other than a GNOME!!!  And
standing next to it was a contraption that looked like it belonged somewhere
between a dentist's office, a construction site, and the bottom of a cliff.  The
machine had three large screws on it's front, bins under the bits with tubes
attached to the bins, a pair of metal tracks, and a cabin in which, for all Ian
could guess, the gnome sat as the machine moved.  
</p><p>&quot;Welcometothewonderfultunnel thatIhavemadeforalltheracesintheaboveworldtouseasaquick meansofgettingfromoneendofthemountaintotheother,&quot;the
gnome spouted off.  &quot;My name is,&quot; the gnome started to say before Ian stopped
him.  He had experience in dealing with gnomes.  &quot;What do humans call you?&quot;  he
asked.  &quot;People call me Miner,&quot; the gnome politely said.  Seeing how Ian looked
at him when he started talking the gnome figured out that this strange half-elf
had no idea what he had been saying.  
</p><p>&quot;What are you doing down here?&quot;  Ian stared at the machine sitting behind the
gnome.  &quot;Why, don't you know?&quot;  The gnome shot Ian a questioning look.  &quot;No I'm
afraid I don't,&quot; he replied.  &quot;Let me explain,&quot; Miner said.  &quot;I'm on a life
quest to find the perfect way to mine a tunnel.  I figured that for the maiden
voyage of my machine, I should try to dig a tunnel from one side of a mountain
to the other.  My machine used to run on coal, and seeing how coal is found
underground, I figured that there would be enough coal under the mountain.  Much
to my surprise, all I found were these sparkly things.  They work well enough as
fuel.&quot;
</p><p>Ian stood dumbstruck.   &quot;Using diamonds as fuel,&quot; Ian thought to himself. 
Before Ian could ask how to get out of this place, the gnome named Miner jumped
in his machine and started it up.  The whole cavern shook as the machine gained
power.  Miner turned the machine around and headed for the opposite wall.  There
was a small crack in it.  Just before Miner smashed into the wall, the screws on
the front of the tank-like machine started to turn.  Miner hit the wall, but
instead of stopping, he began to bore into the rock.  Diamonds from the wall
fell into the bins below the screws and passed through the tubes to end up in
the furnace.  The machine soon disappeared in the hole it had made.  
</p><p>Ian waited for an hour until he could no longer hear the machine.  Staying in
one place wouldn't help Ian's predicament, so he decided to follow the path the
gnome had taken.  It gradually sloped upwards and in the opposite direction in
which Ian had originally came from.   After two more hours of walking, Ian
sensed a change in the air.  It felt as though it were fresh.  A cold wind
caressed his skin.  It was fresh air.  And cold!  Ian pulled his robes about
himself.  
</p><p>After another hour of walking, Ian spotted a shaft of light ahead of him.  Even
though he was exhausted, he pressed on with new resolve.  &quot;To be back in the
fresh air would be a dream,&quot; Ian though to himself.  One minute later he stepped
through a hole in the earth and was met by a gust of wind, a searing cold, and a
smiling gnome named Miner.  Next to the gnome was his machine.  &quot;It worked!&quot; 
Miner had a smile that nearly split his face in two.  &quot;What took you,&quot; Miner
asked.  &quot;I wasn't sure it was safe.  Where are we?&quot;  Ian looked about him but
couldn't find a marker to tell him where he was.  &quot;Well, on the other side of
the mountain,&quot; Miner exclaimed.  &quot;But how?  The mountains are a good days trek
from my town.&quot;  Ian really didn't know how long he had been gone for, but it
couldn't have been that long.  
</p><p>The gnome explained to Ian how long they had been gone over some rations that
Miner had on him.  It had been two days!  &quot;Time is hard to tell underground. 
Two hours may be two days.&quot;  Ian did feel really tired.  &quot;I will show you the
way home after I am done checking this wonderful machine for weaknesses.&quot;  Miner
slapped one of the contraption's tracks as he said this.  A screech erupted from
it.  Slowly it began to fall apart before the gnome's eyes.  &quot;My work,&quot; Miner
howled as the machine began to pop rivets.  
</p><p>It took five minutes.  It had taken Miner thirty years to build.  It was nothing
more than a wreck now.  Ian sifted through the wreckage.  All he found that was
still recognizable were the screws.  &quot;It did it's job Miner.  That's all that
really matters.  You have plans to build another one any way.  Right?&quot;  Miner
had a funny look on his face.  &quot;Plans?&quot;  Ian stuck his forehead.  &quot;It figures.&quot; 
The gnome had a piece of paper in his hand and was furiously writing down notes. 
Ian couldn't make heads or tails of it.
</p><p>Three hours later they were on the road back to his town.  The gnome didn't say
very much on the way.  He was absorbed in thought for most of the way.  After
his laborious not taking, the gnome had brightened.  He began talking of a new
and wondrous tunneling machine.  It was about that time that Ian stopped
listening.  It sure would be nice to get back home.  A warm bed waited for him
there.  But how would he explain all of this to his Master...</p>

<p>&quot;What miserable weather&quot; thought the young man as he huffed and puffed his way through the three foot snow.  He shifted his pack containing all his belongings, and continued to trudge throught the thick snow.</p><p>
As his foot sank through the snow, a loud snap, and splash broke his dour thoughts.</p><p>
&quot;Golly, gee wiz!&quot; yelled the young man as he relized that he had just broken through some ice and into some water.  &quot;Why me?  What did I ever do?&quot;  Well actually quite a bit of things, but this was just such a bad time for this to happen.</p><p>
&quot;I guess that I ought to go and find some shelter before my foot freezes off&quot; the young man muttered to himself.  His eyes searched the frozen rocks and scrub, but he didn't see a thing.  He quickly realizes that he will most certainly die if he doesn't find shelter quickly.  After another ten minutes of frantic searching, nada.</p><p>
&quot;OK, well there have been some good times and some bad times, but here I am, to die a human pop cicle!&quot;  screamed out the frustated yound man.  Blindly, he stumbles about, weeping in self-pity  and then BAM!  He falls onto the cold, dry stone floor.  &quot;Where am I?&quot; wonders the young man.  When his eyes adjusted, he sees the pile of fire wood stacked up against the wall.  He looks at the rest of his surroundings. An approxomatly 12 foot across cave with a thin sliver of an opeaning to his far left.  Deciding that he would deal with whoever gathered the fire wood, the young man pulls off his soaked boot and socks and begins to build a fire.</p><p>
&quot;Ahhh...Toasy warm&quot; the young man smiled, as he basks in the heat of the fire.  He slowly drifts off into the comforting folds of sleep and the image of that village girl that he has had a crush on for the past couple of years.</p><p>
The young man is quickly awakened by the removal of all the air out of his lungs by a very had boot.  His blury sleep filled eyes, attempt to focus on the creature, but...</p>

<div align="center"><h3>A Magi's Shadow</h3><p>by Marc Dotson (dragon-blade@geocities.com)</p></div>
<p>The cool night air wisped around the slumbering city of Palanthas, the most
famous city on Ansalon.  Palanthas was home  to thousands of people and hundreds
of guilds.  The people took great pride in their city, never though of the
imperfection that the city was most known for, the cursed Tower of High Sorcery.
</p><p>There had once been five towers, but now only two existed, the one in
Palanthas, and the one in the magical forest of Wayreth.
</p><p>It was on the black spire that rose from the center of the city, that Jenin
Creed's gaze was averted to now...
</p><p>Jenin was one of the few magic users in the city.  The presence of the Tower
seemed to drive the people into hating those studying the magic arts, and so few
followed this dangerous path, at least in the open .
</p><p>Jenin was not originally from Palanthas.  He was born in the plains of dust,
his father a barbarian and his mother a white robed mage.  It was believed that
Jenin's mother was an Irda, a magical race of ogres born with magic in their
blood.  The woman mage had a choice to take the barbarian as a husband, but the
Valin happened between them, and the marriage would not be stopped.  If Jenin's
mother was an Irda, this would explain the extraordinary powers which he
possessed, but Jenin also had a bit of his father...
</p><p>Jenin was a war magi.
</p><p>Few war magi have ever walked on Krynn.  Magius was a war magi, as was Rathar
Shinare, head of the red robes, and now there was Jenin Creed.  The difference
between a magi and a war magi is their spells.  All war magi spells are fully
war oriented.
</p><p>Jenin studied the arts in the open, and so some people had come to distrust him
while others admired him...
</p><p>Jenin stared precariously at the Dark Tower.  He had once been in it, he dared
to walk the dreaded Shoikan Grove, to speak with the master of the tower,
Dalamar the Dark.
</p><p>Jenin's thoughts were on the dark elf now.  Dalamar had been the apprentice of
Raistin Majere, the most powerful mage ever to have walked on Ansalon.  Jenin
had apprenticed under him, for a time, but only a short time at that.  Life in
the tower was not at all comfortable, with those evil specters roving wherever
they pleased.  Jenin had decided to leave and apprentice under Jenna, the
daughter of Justarius, late head of the red robes.  Jenin had soon grown past
Jenna's expectations, and he was now more powerful then she.
</p><p>Jenin started as he realized he had been drifting off.  Pulling his robe closer
around him, he turned from the patio and walked back into the mansion.
</p><p>&quot;Would you like me turn down your bed, my lord?&quot; a servant asked him politely.
</p><p>&quot;No, that's all right.  I think I'll take a short walk before I go to sleep.&quot;
Jenin replied, yawning.
</p><p>&quot;As you wish.  Call for me when you return, my lord.&quot;
</p><p>&quot;Yes, yes.  Good night.&quot;  Jenin replied, rapping his red robes around him with
his belt with all of his pouches on it, containing his spell components.  After
accomplishing this, he left the room, descended the marble staircase, and made
his way quietly outside.
</p><p>Jenin walked briskly down the street, heading to his destination where he could
sit and think.  Coming around a corner, he headed straight for a white marble
building with large green lawns stretched out before it, the Temple of Paladine.
</p><p>Dedicated to the highest god of good, the Temple had been created many, many
years ago under the jurisdiction of the cleric Elistan, Revered Son of Paladine. 
Revered Daughter Crysania now lead the church, and she led it wisely.  She had
been struck blind when she allowed Raistlin to enter the Abyss to challenge the
Queen of Darkness, and the clerics could not heal her.   The blindness had led
her to see.
</p><p>Walking briskly up the pathway to the Temple, Jenin stopped at his favorite
bench, taking a seat on the cool marble.  Suddenly a thud that shook the very
ground rang out.  Jumping to his feet, Jenin turned to the road.  There stood a
silver dragon...
</p><p>&quot;Jenin!&quot; the dragon cried out in it's thunder like voice.
</p><p>&quot;Flame?&quot; Jenin said questioningly.  &quot;Flame! What brings you to this side of the
world?&quot;
</p><p>&quot;Enough of formalities, we must be off.&quot; the dragon stated quickly.
</p><p>&quot;Off?  Where?  I'm still studying my arts, you know...&quot;
</p><p>&quot;I said that was enough!  Get on my back.  Rathar Shinare wishes to speak with
you.&quot;
</p><div align="center" class="sm">* * *</div>
<p>The ride to the High Clerist Tower was quick on Flame's back.  The mountains
swished by in a blur of color, illuminated only by Solinari's light.
</p><p>&quot;Why is he at the High Clerist Tower?&quot; Jenin demanded of Flame.
</p><p>&quot;You'll soon find out.&quot; the silver dragon replied coolly.  &quot;Ah, there it is.&quot; 
The dragon swooped down, landing gracefully in the cross shaped courtyard of the
Tower.  A knight walked out to greet them, helping Jenin down from Flame's back.
</p><p>&quot;Welcome to the High Clerist Tower.   You must be Jenin Creed.&quot; the knight
looked at Jenin, nodding slightly, his moustaches bobbing.  &quot;The...mage...wishes
to speak with you.&quot;
</p><p>&quot;Well, take me to him!&quot; Jenin demanded, getting tired quickly.  The knight
gestured for Jenin to follow, and they headed off towards a large steel door,
the symbols of the knights decorated on it.
</p><p>&quot;I'll wait here for you,&quot; Flame said, stretching and yawning irritably.  Jenin
nodded to the friendly dragon, and set off again after the knight.
</p><p>The two entered the Tower, and began to ascend immediately.  After about the
second hundredth step, Jenin halted, gasping for breath.  The long night had
finally gotten to him.
</p><p>Just then a figure in red robes with graying hair appeared next to him.
</p><p>&quot;Jenin, I'm surprised you didn't use your teleport spell to get to the top of
the tower!&quot;
</p><p>&quot;Rathar?&quot; Jenin said quizzically. &quot;Master.  I didn't notice it was you.   This
night has gotten to me in more ways then one.&quot; Jenin arched his back, stretching
his well toned muscles.  &quot;You called me here?&quot;
</p><p>&quot;Yes, on a most urgent matter.&quot; the head of the read robes said gravely. 
&quot;Here, let me help you to the top of the tower.  And you knight?  Well of course
you wouldn't want assistance from a mage.&quot;  With that, Rathar help Jenin by the
arm, whispered a word in the spidery tongue of magic, and the ground swirled
away beneath their feet.  It once again became firm as they stood in the top of
the Tower of the High Clerist.
</p><p>&quot;Jenin,&quot; Rathar said, &quot;this is Sir Gavlin, Lord Knight of the Rose.&quot;  The
middle aged man nodded to Jenin.
</p><p>&quot;Nice to meet you.&quot; Jenin said, plopping down in a high backed chair sitting
around the table in the center of the circle shaped room.
</p><p>&quot;I take it Lord Shinare has not spoken to you of the grave tidings we have
received?&quot;
</p><p>&quot;No, he has not.  So if you would, I'd like to hear them now, before I drift
off into sleep.&quot; Jenin stated irritably.
</p><p>&quot;Of course, sir mage,&quot; Gavlin said, turning his back to him and staring out the
glass window to the mountains to the sides.  &quot;This matter would not concern you,
if your heritage was not involved.&quot;
</p><p>&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Jenin said, standing, now fully awake and alert.
</p><p>&quot;Your mother.&quot; Rathar stated flatly, pulling his staff, a duplicate of the
Staff of Magius, closer to him.  &quot;Your mother is being held in Dargaard Keep. 
Under the supervision of Lord Soth.&quot;
</p><p>&quot;The death  knight?&quot; Jenin cried.  &quot;But he hasn't meddled in Ansalon's plans
for years now.&quot;
</p><p>&quot;He plans to take the Tower of the High Clerist.&quot; Gavlin said bluntly, &quot;With
your mothers help.&quot;
</p><p>&quot;She would never do such a thing!&quot; Jenin yelled, running over to the Knight of
the Rose, &quot;She is dead anyway.  Chaos killed all of the Irda months ago.&quot;
</p><p>&quot;She lives,&quot; Rathar whispered.  &quot;I do not know, but by some magical force, she
lives.&quot; he turned his eyes to Jenin, &quot;The reason I have come here is because,&quot;
he faltered, cleared his throat and started once more, &quot;I am here because she is
my grandmother.&quot;
</p><p>&quot;What?&quot; Jenin questioned.  &quot;That's crazy, you know it is!&quot;
</p><p>&quot;Irda live long lives.&quot; Rathar stated.  &quot;It is under all situations, possible.&quot; 
Jenin looked about, his brow furrowed.  Finally he came to a conclusion.
</p><p>&quot;I still don't believe you, not a word, but I'll go with you anyway.&quot; he looked
to Rathar.  &quot;What next?&quot;
</p><div align="center" class="sm">* * *</div>
<p>The High Clerist Tower dwindled in the distance as Jenin, Rathar, and Lord
Gavlin rode atop silver dragons.  Rathar and Jenin rode on top of Flame, a close
friend of Rathar, they fought in the War of the Lance together, and Lord Gavlin
flew atop a gold dragon by the name of Fireblast.  Sir Gavlin had gone into
battle on this very mount several times.  Gavlin's dragonlance was posted on the
dragon, as to take out the undead dragon of Lord Soth.
</p><p>Only once had this happened before, a Knight fighting along side mages, but for
the sake of Ansalon, this had to be done.
</p><p>Flame and Fireblast soared gracefully, heading east for Dargaard Keep, and Lord
Soth.
</p><p>The parties plan was to attack Dargaard quickly, stealing away the Irda woman,
and thus extinguishing Lord Soth's lust for the control of the Tower.  Lord
Soth's motive on this battle was to have the Irda woman as his own, as Highlord
Kitiara had been his.
</p><p>The two dragons swooped down, their wings moving silently through the air. 
Coming out of the bank of clouds, their lay before them the crumbling ruins of
Dargaard Keep.
</p><p>When Jenin had taken the Test, as all mages must do so, he had visited Dargaard
Keep and had fought the famed Lord Soth.  Powerful as he might been in the
illusion created by the wizard conclave, Lord Soth would be much more powerful
in person, and Jenin knew this.  Hopefully they would not even have to fight
Lord Soth, but would make it out alive and unscathed.
</p><p>The two dragons came closer to the ruins-now for the dragon.  A firedragon,
brother to the undead skeletal dragons, flew from the ruins, using the air
currents to it's advantage as it floated up.
</p><p>The undead dragon was powerful, but would be no match for the two good dragons,
and Gavlin's dragonlance.
</p><p>The dragon swept at them, Flame fleeing to one side, letting Fireblast do her
work.  The firedragon began casting a spell of darkness, but from a word of
Fireblast, the magic fell apart in the evil dragon's hands.  Confused, the
firedragon was not prepared for the attack from behind.    Flame's talons ripped
at the firedragon's flesh, ripping scales, tendons, and muscles.  The dragon
writhed in agony, trying to escape as Flame pushed it to it's doom on the tip of
Sir Gavlin's dragonlance.
</p><p>The firedragon became impaled on the tip of the Lance, and was soon pushed off
as Flameburst cast a disintegration spell.  So much for Soth's dragon.
</p><p>The two dragons landed, grit flying through the cool night air, in front of the
ruins of Dargaard Keep.  Dismounting, Lord Gavlin removed his weapons from the
saddle of Fireblast.  Among his many weapons was a magical long sword, equal to
the one of the Brightblade family, two crossbows, a long sword, and an
assortment of other war weapons.
</p><p>Jenin slid down Flame's silvery hide, his weapons being his spell components,
and a short sword, able to be used by war mages.
</p><p>Rathar Shinare slid off, his weapons being his components and his staff, The
Staff of Shinare, duplicate of The Staff of Magius.
</p><p>Together, the three jogged to the crumbling gateway, leading into the cursed
ruins.  
</p><p>&quot;Shirak,&quot; Rathar whispered, and the globe atop his staff, grasped by the silver
dragon claw, burst into light.  The eerie soft light illuminated the ruined
corridor, giving a ghastly glow to the torch less sconces placed along the
walls.
</p><p>&quot;Now, we find my mother.&quot;  Jenin stated softly, reaching into a pouch.  Mixing
sulfur and bat dung together, the magic words on his lips, he set down the
hallway, the two others following closely behind.
</p><p>They soon came to a crossroads in the corridor.  Jenin looked this way and
that, not knowing where to go.
</p><p>&quot;Trust your instincts, mage.&quot; Lord Gavlin said, looking around instinctively,
his magical blade raised high, giving off it's own light.  &quot;She is your mother,
after all.&quot;
</p><p>Jenin closed his eyes, trying to feel his mothers presence in the dark ruins...
</p><p>&quot;This way.&quot; he said coolly, turning to the right.  His heavy footfalls were
alone, the others had dispersed.  Turning, he stared around hurriedly, the light
was gone...
</p><p>&quot;Rathar!&quot; he screamed in sudden despair.  I mocking voice laughed behind him,
it's laughter echoing quickly in the dark hallway.
</p><p>&quot;Your friends won't find you now...&quot; the voice replied in a piercing whisper. 
&quot;Now you will serve my god, Chemosh, in the realms of the dead!&quot;
</p><p>Jenin turned, the words to the spell upon his lips once more.  The swift
clatter of iron shod feet was coming closer.  Jenin raised his voice in the
spidery language of magic, lifting the spell components before him.  The clatter
came closer-the hallway burst into light, a ball of flame extending from Jenin's
hand.
</p><p>The skeletal warrior burst into flame, falling to the ground.  He lifted his
skull of a head, it's evil grin emphasized by the flame surrounding it.  The
warrior fell to the ground, his head rolling off, the room plunged once more
into darkness.
</p><p>Jenin breathed a sigh of relief.  Needing light once more, he spoke a word of
magic, and a small globe of light appeared next to him, providing illumination.
</p><p>Jenin cried out once more, &quot;Rathar!&quot;
</p><p>You will meet with us soon enough.  Descend the corridor, we'll deal with
Soth's minions.
</p><p>Jenin waited until Rathar's voice subsided.  He then followed his instructions,
and continued swiftly down the corridor, taking a piece of foxfire from a pouch,
and holding it tightly.
</p><p>He soon came to a door, on it were engraved the symbol of the rose, blackened
by the fires of the cataclysm, hundreds of years ago.  Lord Soth, Knight of the
Black Rose, this was his symbol.
</p><p>Pushing the door slightly, it swung open.  The sound of swords clanging, and
the chanting of spells rang out from the bottom of the corridor.  Jenin ran to
the door at the end of the corridor, wherein, chaos reigned supreme.
</p><p>On one side of the room, the injured Lord Gavlin was battling against three
skeletal warriors at once.  Next to him stood Rathar Shinare, his staff grasped
tightly in his hand.  Balls of flame, lightning, and an assortment of other
fantastic spells sprang forth rhythmically as he battle a throng of banshees. 
But the thing that caught Jenin's eye was a throne at the end of the hall, on
which sat Lord Soth, Knight of the Black Rose.  His orange flickering eyes
watched the battle closely, almost studying the offenders moves-maybe even
laughing at them...
</p><p>Jenin cried out to Rathar, who gave him no recognition but continued destroying
the banshees.  Jenin started as two skeletal warriors sprang out at him, their
black blades flashing.
</p><p>Jenin raised his hands, spoke a word in magic, and ten flaming arrows pierced
one of the skeletal warriors armor, turning him to dust.
</p><p>The other lunged at Jenin, who jumped to one side knocking the warrior to the
floor.  Drawing his blade, which began to glow with a dull light, he decapitated
the warrior, his head rolling across the dark marble floor.
</p><p>Turning once more, Jenin saw Gavlin chop down two warriors at once, getting his
ancestral armor scarred in the process.  Gavlin turned to him, yelling.
</p><p>&quot;Your mother!&quot; he cried.  &quot;There!&quot; he pointed across the room, at Lord Soth. 
Jenin finally noticed the white robed woman chained in front of Soth.
</p><p>The woman had bluish skin, as do all Irda, and long black hair which fell down
to her waist.  The robes were torn at her legs, wounds bleeding freely.  Jenin
felt a strange sensation as he looked at her.   Perhaps this was his mother...
</p><p>Lord Soth's eyes were upon him.
</p><p>Jenin stared into those mocking flame eyes.  Soth stood, took his gaze off of
Jenin and turned to his mother, pointing his finger...
</p><p>&quot;Die.&quot; he whispered.  This was all the death needed to say.  Jenin's mother
withered and died, her life blood spilling across the floor.
</p><p>&quot;No!&quot; Jenin screamed, charging at the death knight.  Soth picked up Jenin, and
through him at the glass window.  Jenin felt the glass give way, and the shards
stabbing into his skin painfully, ripping his robes.  He then felt himself
falling, falling.  He saw the ground rushing up at him, and the wind was blown
out of his body as he hit the hard ground.  The first thought that came to mind
was, &quot;Well at least I'm not impaled on one of the spires.&quot;
</p><p>After a long rest, Jenin stood, painfully, his wounds pouring all over his
robes, turning them crimson.  He looked up, two stories, to where Lord Soth
stood, glaring at him...he raised his hand...pointing at Jenin.  
</p><p>Jenin stood, calling upon the magic, calling upon the power of the red moon
Lunitari, calling upon power within himself that he did not know even existed. 
Lord Soth had killed his mother, and his friends within the Keep by now. 
Revenge would be his...
</p><p>Raising his hand to the sky, lightning flashed from his fingertips, striking
the clouds above, and they answered...
</p><p>Magical lighting flashed around him, struck the keep, struck Soth.  Raising his
hands, lightning sizzled in a swirl of motion around him.  The keep fell, Soth
himself destroyed, Jenin stood in the smoldering remains of the keep.
</p><p>Revenge was his.
</p><p>Looking down at his innumerable wounds, he watched as his blood red robes
turned dark, too dark...his robes changed to black...
</p><p>&quot;No!&quot; Jenin yelled, falling to his knees, sobbing.  Raising his head, he was no
longer in the keep, but in the Tower of the High Clerist.  Rathar and Lord
Gavlin stood before him...
</p><div align="center" class="sm">* * *</div>
<p>The explanation had been complex, Rathar himself explained it.  The whole thing
had been an illusion, to convince Jenin of his dark side, his shadow, and what
would happen if he gave into hatred.
</p><p>Ever since they had left the Tower, it had been fake.
</p><p>&quot;But what about my mother?&quot; Jenin asked.  Rathar explained saying his mother
was most likely dead, and it would be almost impossible for Jenin's mother to be
his grandmother.
</p><p>In conclusion, Rathar asked Jenin to come to the Tower of High Sorcery in
Wayreth, to help him further the cause of neutrality.  Jenin agreed whole
heartily, saying that he would do anything to help find, and destroy the shadow
that existed within himself.  The shadow that all Magi possess...</p>

<div align="center"><h3>The Knight's Charge</h3><p>by Marc Dotson (dragon-blade@geocities.com)</p></div>
<p>The march had been long and hard, the sun beat down on the young knight
as if it were a dragon, blowing flames upon its enemy; but still he and
the others grudged onward, through the barren wasteland burning beneath
the noon-high sun.
</p><p>&quot;Trianus!  Stream up ahead, get to it!&quot; a voice yelled from the head of
the caravan: the colonel.  Grasping the reigns on his horse more
tightly, Trianus brushed his spurs into the stallion's sides and shot
off like a flash, moving to the right of the dirt road and the caravan.
The horse's gallop brought clouds of dust up, choking the knight.  He
put on his helm, baring the heat and hoping that it would clear his
throat of the constant dust flying throughout the air - but to no
avail.  Breathing became a task in it self, but still he trudged onward.
</p><p>He soon came to the head of the caravan, and looked back: fifty knights
in full armor, and twenty squires, horsemen, and wagons carrying up the
supplies.  It had been two days since the beginning of the trek, and the
Blue Mountains with North Keep, their destination, should soon be seen
on the blue horizon later in the day.
</p><p>Passing the colonel, his great two handed sword flashing in the hot sun
as it lay, strapped to the knight's back.  Trianus came to the stream
ahead, and jumped from his horse, landing knee deep in the cool water.
It splashed up over his silver armor, relieving him greatly of the heat
that was baring down on him.  He quickly began to fill the water sack
that he was carrying, jumped back on the horse, and delivered the water
to the colonel.
</p><p>One more day and they would be at North Keep.
</p><p>From there to the front line, and the war...
</p><p>Memories of his first battle flashed back into his mind as he sat,
waiting for the colonel to finish quenching his thirst.  The blood had
covered his entire form, as he chopped away rhythmically at the enemies
flowing ranks...severing their limbs and brining more drenching blood
down on him.
</p><p>&quot;I'm done, knight.&quot; the colonel said, tossing back the sack.  &quot;Ride
with me.&quot;
</p><p>With the colonel?
</p><p>&quot;Yes, I said ride with me.  Stop looking so amazed and pick up the
pace.&quot; the colonel said, irritated.  He stroked his long moustaches
falling from his upper lip - the sign of a true Solamnic Knight.
Trianus moved his hand to his own moustache, small, but thick.  It would
grow out soon enough.  Maneuvering his horse kindly, he matched the
colonel's pace as they crossed the stream.
</p><p>&quot;I've seen you in battle, Trianus.&quot; the colonel said, his gray eyes
sparkling in the sun, &quot;and I would have to say that I'm impressed.  Once
we get to the Keep, I'm placing you in charge of a platoon of
Calvary...you'll do well.  I knew your father, he was also a great
knight of his day...&quot; the colonel suddenly stopped, his reigns fell from
his hands as he stared out into the distant horizon, his eyes glazed
over...
</p><p>&quot;Dragons.&quot; he said in a barely audible whisper.  &quot;Twelve of them...and
riders.  There coming this way.&quot;  he stopped, counting the numbers that
Trianus could not see for the blare of the sun.  All that he could see
was storm clouds gathering on the distant horizon...
</p><p>Storm clouds.
</p><p>Dragons.
</p><p>&quot;What in the name of the Abyss,&quot; the colonel began, but stopped, his
throat choked up.  &quot;The Keep has fallen.&quot;
</p><p>Suddenly, an entire regiment, maybe two, of the dragon armies appeared
not two hundred yards away.
</p><p>The trap was sprung.
</p><p>Sapphire dragons, their cries rising to the sun came swooping from the
sky.  The caravan was outnumbered ten, maybe fifteen to one.  Trianus'
heart was caught in his throat as he realized what the consequences
were.  His silver helm flashed in the sun as he placed in over his head,
the red feather of his Calvary burning bright in the glimmering heat.
 &quot;Charge!&quot;  trumpets blared, the knight's cried and galloped forward.
No dragons had been assigned to the caravan.  They weren't supposed to
have been in battle this early; the Keep was supposed to still be there,
they were to receive their mounts there, but the Keep had fallen.
</p><p>And death loomed near.
</p><p>Trianus cut down the first draconian, his sword splicing the demon's
right wing off.  He chopped, right left, thrust perry.  Four more dragon
men fell, but the numbers were overwhelming.  He was quickly thrown from
his mount, and lay sprawled on the wasteland, draconians swarming over
him.  He razed his hand axe, and swung upward, taking the jaw off of a
draconian.  Blood splashed over him as the draconian melted into a pool
of acid.
</p><p>Trianus stood, battle rage burning in his eyes.
</p><p>Another draconian fell, his head cleaved in two.  Trianus looked up
from the bloody scene to see the colonel, his back exposed, fall prey to
a spear...hope was lost.  The knowledge of his own demise swept over
him, and Trianus flung himself at the enemy, not caring whether he
followed correct procedures or not.  Seven fell from his tremendous
blows, his silver armor glistened crimson.
</p><p>A blade flashed in the sunlight, came crashing down on his exposed
neck, his helm now flung from his body.  Blood spilled down his back -
his own blood.  He suddenly got very cold, and it anerved him, here
being in the bright summer light that he should be <i>freezing</i>!
Falling to his knees, the cries of his comrades came, calling his
name...and darkness enveloped him.</p>
