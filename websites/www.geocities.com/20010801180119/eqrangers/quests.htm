        <p><font color="#000000"><strong>Rain Caller</strong> -
        After completing the Trueshot Longbow quest in Kelethin,
        Maesyn Trueshot tells you of how the Koada`Vie used to
        enchant the Feir`Dal bows and he advises you to visit the
        enchanters guild in Felwithe. Find Kinool Goldsinger in
        the enchanter's guild in Felwithe and ask him &quot;Where
        can I get an enchanted Trueshot Longbow?&quot;. As you
        continue through the conversation, you will discover that
        you will need to obtain several items before he can
        enchant a bow for you. (1) Fairie Dust (This is the
        longest, hardest, most involved part of the quest). You
        need to talk to Princess Jolena of the fairies about
        this. Asking her about it reveals that one of her wings
        was stolen by a bald person who smelled of rust and
        refuse. She asks you to bring back her wing and she will
        give you the Fairie Dust. In Ak'Anon by the necro guild
        there is a Gnome named Sanfyrd Featherhead. If you ask
        him where Princess Jolena's ing is, he will tell you you
        can't have it because he read that it will make his hair
        grow back. He also mentions that he has no [friends].
        Patronize him by saying &quot;I am your friend&quot; at
        which point he says that &quot;You are just saying that
        to get my feather, if you are really my friend you would
        help me get some hair tonic&quot; (or something similar
        to that). Talk with him furtherand he will give you a 10
        slot crate to fill with hair tonics. You then have to
        travel to West Freeport and visit Ping Fuzzlecutter, the
        Gnome outside the gates by the tent. Ping sells the
        tonics you need, just purchase the ten and combine them
        in the crate. Take the new box back to Sanfyrd and he
        will ask you for one more favor before turning over the
        wing. He will give you his tattered toupee and ask that
        you get it fixed by the same man who sold you the hair
        tonics. So you must venture back to West Freeport again
        and visit Ping. You need to ask him &quot;Can you repair
        a toupee?&quot;. Ping will then go into the history of
        his wig, &quot;The Main Attraction&quot; and tell you
        that he can still fix it because it is still under
        warranty. In order to fix it, you need to get him 2
        clumps of hair from a hulking gorilla (found in
        Cazic-Thule) and a lock of a golden tresses from a
        &quot;certain mermaid&quot;. This mermaid is &quot;a
        golden haired mermaid&quot; that is found in Kedge
        Keep.You will need lots of help for this part of the
        quest, at least 2 groups of players that are level 40+.
        After you retrieve the lock of mermaid hair, take that
        along with the 2 clumps of gorilla hair and the tattered
        to toupee and give them to Ping. You will then recieve
        &quot;The Main Attraction&quot; (4AC +10CHA). Return to
        Ak'Anon and give the wig to Sanfyrd and you will recieve
        the glimmering fairie wing. Take the wing back to
        Princess Jolena and she will reward you with the dust.
        (2) A Treant Heart. You can get a treant heart from Jyle
        Windshot in West Freeport in the Hogcaller's Inn. After
        giving him a few small lanterns, he will give you a
        treant heart instead of treant wood. (3) Your Trueshot
        Longbow. (4) 3000gp. Upon returning all 4 items to
        Kinool, he will reward you with the Rain Caller. The Rain
        Caller is 20 Dam, 45 Del, 200 Rng, 3.0wt., +6STR, +6DEX,
        5 Charges of Firestrike, Magic, Lore, Ranger ONLY.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000000"><strong>Orc Hatchets : </strong>Dill
        Fireshine, in Faydark's Champions, which is the Ranger
        guild, wants you to help with elimating the Crushbone
        Orcs. He will first request you kill Orc Hatchetmen and
        return 2 Orc Hatchets to him. Upon returning them to him
        he will reward you with minor coin, experience, faction
        and a tarnished 1HS weapon, sometimes even 2 or 3 1HS
        tarnished weapons. This is a very good quest for newbies
        as it gives them money, experience and an upgrade to
        their newbie or rusty weapon. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><strong>Orc Runner : </strong>After
        completing the Orc Hatchet, Dill Fireshine will then give
        you the Orc Runner quest. It seems the Crushbone Orcs are
        in cahoots with the Teir`Dal Dark Elves. Dill will also
        want you to return the Orc Runner pouch along with a note
        that is sometimes found on the runner. The Orc Runner
        varies in level, usually level 8 to 10. He is usually
        spoted between the Greater Faydark zone and the
        crossroads with the small cabin with 2 guards. The best
        place to wait for him is at the 2 small cabins with
        merchants near the Greater Faydark zone, if you wait for
        him near the guards at the cross roads he may get to
        close and be killed by the guards and then you will have
        to wait a while for the next spawn. When you turn in the
        Orc Runner pouch (and note if you have it) you will
        recieve some gold, good experience (if you are in the
        level 8 to 10 range), faction and an item worth from
        several gold to even some platinum.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><strong>Trueshot Longbow : </strong>This
        quest results in the Trueshot Longbow and is quite
        involved and time consuming. You will also need to be
        amiable with Faydark's Champions to begin the quest.
        Since Faydark's Champions worship Tunare, the Human and
        Half Elf Rangers who worship Karana will con. indifferent
        and will need to raise their faction, this can be done by
        killing Crushbone Orcs. Start the quest by talking to
        guild master Maesyn Trueshot will tell you of the
        Trueshot Longbow and will give you a 4 slot pouch in
        which to collect the materials for the bow. You will need
        (1) Spiderling silk, which can be collected from widow
        hatchlings. (2) A Micro Servo, which is No Drop and are
        rare drops and can be collected off of rogue clockworks
        in Steamfont. (3) Some dwarven wire, which is a side
        quest in Kaladim. You will need to have decent faction in
        Kaladim to do this part. You need to find Trantor Everhot
        for the dwarven wire. He tells you he will give you a
        spool but he wants 2 Tumpy Tonics in exchange. You must
        then find Tumpy Irontoe who will make the drinks for you
        free of charge but you need to bring him 1 Kiola Nut and
        1 water flask for each Tumpy Tonic you want. You must
        then venture to the Sister of Erolisi Island in the Ocean
        of Tears for the Kiola Nut, which is sold on the island
        by the female wood elf merchant. After you venture back
        to Kaladim return the ingredients to Tumpy , take the 2
        Tumpy Tonics back to Trantor and give them to him
        (remember not to stack the drinks on top of each other),
        he will then reward you will a spool of dwarven wire
        which is No Drop. (4) Lastly you need Treant Wood. You
        need to travel to Freeport to find Jyle Windshot. He is
        located in West Freeport in an inn upstairs, in the room
        that Lady Shae stands in front of. He will ask what you
        are looking for. Tell him &quot;I am looking for Treant
        Wood.&quot; He will then tell you that he lost his
        lantern in a card game (or something like that) and that
        he will gladly give you the Treant Wood you need in
        exchange for a small lantern. After you give him a small
        lantern he will give you the Treant Wood you are looking
        for. Now take all 4 of the parts you have collected on
        your long journey and combine them in the 4 slot pouch
        that was given to you by Maesyn Trueshot. You will create
        a new pouch that you need to return to him. Once you have
        returned the pouch to him, he will reward you will a
        Treantwood Bowstaff. If you ask him, he will tell you how
        to make the famed Trueshot Longbow. You will need your
        Treanwood Bowstaff, a Plane, a Micro Servo and some
        dwarven wire. You need a very high master skill in
        Fletching (at least in the low to mid 100's) to assemble
        the bow. Since you need some of the same parts that you
        used on your quest to get the materials, you should
        collect a few extras so that you don't have to make those
        long trips again. Once you have the appropriate
        materials, put them in your fletching kit and click
        combine. If your skill is high enough (cross your
        fingers) you will have assembled the famous Trueshot
        Longbow, Ranger ONLY , Lore Item, 20 Dam. 45 Del. 100
        Rng. 3.0wt.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><strong>Pixie Dust : </strong>The
        female Ranger guild leader in Faydark's Champions, the
        Ranger guild, wants you to kill the troublesome pixies
        who threaten the safety of the forest. She will give you
        a 6 slot pouch and wants you to collect pixie dust and
        proof of their death. Fill the pouch and combine it.
        Return it to her for minor coin, experience, faction and
        usually a piece of small patchwork or ocasionally
        raw-hide. </font></p>

        is carrying she will reward you with her sword. The EBS,
        which is 7 Dam 24 Del and has the proc of Esnaring Roots,
        is found on the Minotaur Patriarch in Lower Guk. Many
        people believe that it is better to keep this sword than
        to obtain Morin's Sword, so many opt to kill the ghoul
        messanger, who is tough to anyone not in the 30's and is
        usually found running around near the undead ruins in
        West Karana and the North Karana zone area. Kill the
        ghoul messanger and collect the map of Kithicor that he
        drops, which is No Drop. Return the map to Morin and she

        [assist in the extermination of gnoll brewers]. If you
        say the bracketed works, he go on further to tell you to
        go to Black Burrow and to kill the gnoll brewers and
        bring back any Black Burrow casks. He then continues to
        tell you &quot;Upon your third cask I shall reward you
        with the [Cloak of the Jaggedpine]. The casks are found
        on &quot;a gnoll master brewer&quot; and on &quot;a gnoll
        brewer&quot; which are rare spawns at the end of the
        bottom bridge by the barrels in Black Burrow. For
        completing this quest you will be rewarded with the Cloak
        of the Jaggedpine, a Ranger and Druid only cloak, Magic

        </strong>Ranger guild leader Larsk Juton wants you to
        kill a gnoll by the name of Gnasher Furgutt who is part
        of the Black Burrow stout brewing that is going on.
        Gnasher is approximately level 10 and occasionally spawns
        in Qeynos Hills usually somewhere near Black Burrow or
        the valley on the lake side of the zone. When you kill
        Gnasher he occasionally carries the note that was given
        to him by the bartender in Fish's Ale in South Qeynos.
        Give Gnasher's head to Larsk which will result in some
        minor coin , experience, faction and the Black Burrow
        Brewers quest. When you give the note next it will also
        result in more experience and faction. Larsk will then
        advise you to take the note to Captian Tillian in the
        arena in South Qeynos. When you hand over the note you
        will get MORE experience, faction and a Medal of Merit.
        He will then summon an executioner who will carry out the
        death sentence to the unwise bartender in Fish's Ale. The
        Medal of Merit ia a Lore Item that grants +5 CHA.</font></p>

        Castekin in the Ranger guild house has a problem. She

        has not seen or heard from him. After some investigating
        you learn that he was last seen in the Qeynos Aquaducts.
        When you make you way to the Qeynos Aquaducts you will
        learn that he is now a skeleton. Kill him and return to
        Surefall Glade to tell Miranda of the traged for some
        experience. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><strong>Poacher Heads : </strong>Talk
        to Gillarian Naelev, the first guild leader you see when
        you enter the Ranger guild house. It turns out that
        poachers are hunting the bears of Surefall Glade and he
        wants you to eliminate them. When you return the poacher
        head to him he will give you some gold, experience, and
        occasionally a minor item. He will then will speak of a
        master poacher. This leads to the Talym Shoontar's head
        quest.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><strong>Talym Shoontar's Head : </strong>After
        completing the poacher head quest in Surefall Glade,

        will be given the task of killing the master poacher
        Talym Shoontar. This quest may be started by also talking

        occasionally appears in Qeynos Hills, he usually travels
        the road from the West Karana zone to the stone marker
        and then turns to head towards North Qeynos. He is
        approximately level 15 but is very difficult, comparable
        to Dorn B`Dynn of North Ro. Be careful where you choose
        to fight him because if you are near the guards they will
        attack you. For completing this quest you get money,
        experience, faction and an item.</font></p>
