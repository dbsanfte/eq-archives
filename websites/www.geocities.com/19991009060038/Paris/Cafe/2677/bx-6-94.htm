<p><font size=6><strong>It's Just a Ride</strong></font><strong><br>
</strong><em><strong>The Dallas Morning News, June 19, 1994</strong></em><strong><br>
<br>
&quot;I delight in telling my brothers things they don't know, particularly when they're 
true... NONSMOKERS DIE EVERY DAY... SLEEP TIGHT.&quot; <br>
<br>
When Bill Hicks was a teen-ager, his mother got a call from his school. It seems that 
one of Bill's teachers had the bright idea of turning over the first five minutes of class 
to her precocious student. She hoped that if he got it out of his system, he would be 
less disruptive. Instead, Bill took over. <br>
<br>
&quot;That's your problem,&quot; Mary Hicks told the teacher. &quot;You shouldn't have let him 
get up there.&quot; <br>
<br>
During his short, bright life as the best unknown comedian in the country - if not the 
best comic anywhere - Bill Hicks was a problem to all sorts of &quot;right-thinking&quot; 
people. He made it his mission to point out hypocrisy in the views of religious 
fundamentalists, warmongers, rednecks, flag-wavers, prudes, the anti-drug 
contingent and corporate America. <br>
<br>
&quot;He was just a very engaged person who felt compelled to make comedic chestnuts 
out of all these complex issues, and he was clearly gifted at it,&quot; comedian Richard 
Belzer says in Comedy Central's tribute to Mr. Hicks, It's Just a Ride, which debuts 
Sunday night at 10. <br>
<br>
But even though he shared views with such identifiably left-leaning comics as Bobcat 
Goldthwait, Mr. Hicks never got labeled a liberal. He was much farther out there. <br>
<br>
&quot;He didn't want to affiliate with any particular place on the political map,&quot; David 
Johndrow says in a telephone interview. The Austin photographer met Mr. Hicks in 
his hometown of Houston during the summer between 11th and 12th grades. &quot;He 
used to say he was a gentle anarchist. 'Let's find out what's true.' That overrode 
everything else.&quot; <br>
<br>
When Mr. Hicks died in February of pancreatic cancer at age 32, he had already 
been performing for 19 years, averaging more than 200 dates a year on the road. He 
had made two HBO specials, put out two albums and appeared on both of David 
Letterman's late-night shows a total of 12 times - the last of which never aired. <br>
<br>
Mr. Letterman and his CBS Late Show producers decided that bits about pro-lifers, 
the Easter bunny and cross-wearing Christians were too offensive, so they excised 
the routine from the show. It was the biggest censorship brouhaha at the Ed Sullivan 
Theater since Elvis' hips were deemed too racy in 1956. <br>
<br>
&quot;You'd watch him as a comedian, and you'd kinda feel bad,&quot; comic Richard Jeni says 
during the Comedy Central tribute. &quot;You'd kinda go, I really should be doing more of 
this kind of thing. I should be telling the truth more.' &quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;By the way, if anybody here is in marketing or advertising, kill yourself. There's no 
rationalization for what you do, and you are Satan's little helpers... This is not a joke. 
You are Satan's spawn, filling the world with bile and garbage. Kill yourself. It's the 
only way to save your soul.&quot; <br>
<br>
Mr. Hicks made connections that exposed society's hypocrisy, especially among its 
self-appointed moral guardians. He found it ironic that presidents who believed the 
Bible was literally true, including the fire and brimstone of Revelations, had their 
itchy fingers on the nuclear button; that the people who most opposed sexual 
thoughts also wanted us to be fruitful and multiply; that religious fanatics didn't like 
what he said but weren't willing to forgive him. <br>
<br>
In one bit, Mr. Hicks would talk about the government's definition of pornography: <br>
<br>
&quot;no artistic merit, causes sexual thoughts. Well, that sounds like every commercial 
on television to me. You know, when I see those two twins on that Doublemint 
commercial - I'm almost embarrassed to tell y'all this - I'm not thinking of gum... 
Hey, honey, where's the Wrigleys? I feel like chewing on something.' &quot; <br>
<br>
In another routine, he would relate the story of a Waffle House waitress who asked 
him why he was reading. &quot;I guess I read for a lot of reasons,&quot; he said, &quot;and the main 
one is so I don't end up being a waffle waitress... It's not like I walked into a Klan 
rally in a Boy George outfit. It's a book!&quot; <br>
<br>
Onstage, Mr. Hicks was fearless. He didn't care what people thought of him, which 
gave him the freedom to say anything. Usually dressed in black and smoking up a 
storm, he never stopped pacing. <br>
<br>
&quot;He wasn't like a guy who comes up and stands at a mike and lays out one-liners, but 
rather that there's this sort of tornado moving around the stage and cycling around 
and throwing all this energy at you,&quot; says Eric Bogosian, the abrasive New York 
performance artist and actor (Talk Radio), in the Comedy Central special. <br>
<br>
Comic Allan Havey says: &quot;He wasn't concerned with what the audience thought, who 
would boo him. He wasn't concerned with how it would affect his business. He just 
said what he wanted to say.&quot; <br>
<br>
Before expressing regret at the way their relationship ended, Mr. Letterman says 
during the special that he too was taken by Mr. Hicks' attitude. &quot;What I liked about 
Bill was, here is a guy that nobody knew, myself included, who had a swagger to his 
demeanor, both physical and emotional. And I just liked that. For no good reason, for 
no justifiable reason, I'm cocky. Nobody knows me. Too bad.' You could almost see 
him turning his shoulder to the audience.&quot; <br>
<br>
Mr. Hicks' mother likens her son to a preacher, and stand-up comic/actress Brett 
Butler (Grace Under Fire) says he was inspired by his love-hate relationship with the 
South. <br>
<br>
Sometimes called a &quot;rock 'n' roll comedian&quot; because his audiences tended to be 
young, Mr. Hicks didn't want to be Jimi Hendrix or Bob Dylan or Jim Morrison or 
even Lenny Bruce, to whom he has often been compared, Ms. Butler says. <br>
<br>
&quot;It was Jesus that Bill wanted to be. He wanted to save us all... He wanted to be 
Christ at his angriest.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm a heavy smoker. I go through two lighters a day.&quot; <br>
<br>
At age 13, Mr. Hicks was entertaining the other kids at summer camp. By 15, he was 
sneaking out of his house to perform at the Houston Comedy Workshop's open-mike 
nights. And before he graduated from high school, he was the star at the club, 
outdrawing veteran comics. <br>
<br>
In his spare time, young Bill liked to take in porno movies and drugs, especially 
hallucinogens that grew naturally in the countryside outside town. He liked to say he 
believed God put those substances in the ground to speed up human evolution. He 
also drank heavily, off- and on-stage, though he gave up alcohol altogether in the 
mid-'80s. <br>
<br>
At about the same time, Jay Leno recommended him to the Letterman show, where 
he became a semi-regular. One of the so-called &quot;outlaw comics,&quot; a group that 
included Sam Kinison, he became a star of sorts in the United Kingdom. Thousands 
would pack his gigs around the U.K., and in 1990, he received the critics award at the 
Edinburgh Fringe Festival in Scotland. <br>
<br>
When he found out last year that he was sick, Mr. Hicks simply worked harder. Two 
more comedy albums, which he planned to set to music, are in the can. <br>
<br>
Mr. Hicks' father, Jim, remembers telling his son about the use of a particular 
four-letter word onstage: &quot;I said, Bill, I don't see Bob Hope using it, or any other 
well-known comedian.' He didn't like Bob Hope or any other comedian I would 
mention... I think his message came from his feelings and his observations about 
what was happening in this country. I think he was passionately determined to try and 
make some changes through this medium.&quot; Hicks would often end his shows with a 
sentimental plea. <br>
<br>
He wanted us to redirect the money being spent on bombs to feed and clothe the 
poor. And there would still be enough left, he would say, to explore inner, as well as 
outer, space. <br>
<br>
&quot;He was the darkest guy I knew, and he was the brightest - that's what was so 
brilliant about him,&quot; Mr. Johndrow says. &quot;He would dig out all these demons and 
then have these very positive messages. He said he was a misanthropic humanist.&quot; <br>
