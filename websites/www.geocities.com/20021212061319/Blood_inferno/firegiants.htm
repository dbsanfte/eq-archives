        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Fire Giant run is considered one of
        the &quot;big accomplishments&quot; of any group of adventurers in their
        high levels. They can be done with a group of 6 extremely good players,
        but to be safe, you will usually want to bring along 2 groups. Many
        guilds choose to use 18-24 people as well. There are many different ways
        of doing Fire Giants. The method here is the method that my guild uses,
        and it has worked very well for us.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Fire Giants are especially fun to do
        because they require no camping. It is truly like an adventure to do
        Fire Giants. You start at the beginning and work your way deep into the
        lair of the Fire Giants, killing the three powerful Fire Giants, King
        Tranix, Warlord Skarlon, and Magi Rokyl. At the end of the adventure,
        you are treated to a glimpse of Nagafen's lair, and if the dragon is
        alive, you can even say hi to Lord Nagafen himself.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The entire run can take from two to four
        hours, depending on your luck, patience, and teamwork. Our average time
        for a group of 12 is about 3 hours from start to finish. If done right,
        no one needs to die on the run, although the puller is always at risk,
        and a failed feign by your puller can oftentimes lead to his death. The
        initial fight at the starting of the run can also claim a few lives if
        it is not done properly - it is the only part of the run where you must
        fight more than one giant at a time.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">All of the named monsters are 100%
        spawns, so you are guaranteed to get three good items from this run
        every time you do it, assuming you finish it. The run is necessary to do
        if you plan on tackling Lord Nagafen, although usually the number of
        groups required to do Nagafen will have no trouble killing the giants on
        the way.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The respawn for the Fire Giants is about
        6 hours. Because this respawn time is so long, you will rarely find
        yourself in the situation where you are camping Fire Giants, waiting for
        them to respawn. The only time this really happens is when you get to
        the Fire Giants early after knowing when the previous group killed them.
        Killing Fire Giants on respawn is kind of boring, and I don't recommend
        it. It's a lot more fun to do it properly, with a fully spawned Fire
        Giant castle.</font></p>

        <font color="#990000"> </font>
        - <a href="#Fire Giant">top</a></font></h3>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There are two types of regular Fire
        Giants that you will find. Fire Giant Warriors are the common ones, and
        once in a while, one of these giants will spawn instead as a Fire Giant
        Wizard. You will also usually encounter a wandering Lava Duct Crawler or
        two while setting up the run. Fire Giants range from the rare level 46
        one to level 51. On average, they are level 50. They have a ton of hit
        points, hit hard (Most hit for about 135), and cannot be stunned or
        mesmerized. They also have the ability to summon their target to their
        feet if their target isn't in melee range. This leads to the amusing
        &quot;You will not evade me, Jekhar!&quot; lines that are broadcast
        throughout the zone. In order to cast spells on them, casters need to be
        in melee range or the spell will always be resisted.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Fire Giant wizards are wizard monsters,
        have less hit points, but can cast Force Strike (about 550 damage).
        Whenever confronted with multiple giants, kill the wizards first.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Fire Giants typically drop high level
        research components (including level 49 ones), throwing boulders, and
        fine steel weapons.</font></p>
        <h3><u><font face="Arial" size="3"><a name="Chain Pulling"><font color="#990000">Chain
        Pulling</font></a></font></u><font face="Arial" size="1"><a name="Chain Pulling">
        -</a> <a href="#Fire Giant">top</a></font></h3>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The easiest and safest way to single pull
        Fire Giants is to use chain pulling. If your puller hasn't had any
        practice with this method of pulling, it's suggested that you practice
        it in Lower Guk at the King and Lord camps. For those that don't know
        how to do this, here's a brief description:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There are at least two people involved in
        the pulling. The first, or primary puller, is a monk or shadow knight.
        The second, or chain puller, can be any tank class, although a monk or shadow knight
        is safest in case of an error. Any class with a good range attack can
        serve this role as well. He should be in the same group as the puller,
        should have his hit points buffed as well, and everyone should be set to
        assist the chain puller.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When all groups are ready for a pull, the
        primary puller goes out to the monsters, and aggros a group of them. He
        runs back towards the group, and when he's outside the aggro range of
        all of the monsters that are being pulled, he feigns death. At this
        point, the monsters that were pulled will hang around the feigned
        puller's body for awhile, and then start to go home. Hopefully, one of
        the group will linger around for longer than the others. When there is
        just one left, and the others have had enough time to get a good distance
        away from the lingerer, the chain puller comes up and smacks the last
        one, and runs it back to the group. If done properly, the others will be
        outside of aggro range and will not assist the single lingerer.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The primary puller stays on the ground
        till the fight has started, and then he can either lie there, or check
        to see if his aggro is clear. Only if he is certain that nothing is
        still aggro to him should he return to the group and help them out.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There are several variations to this,
        including multiple chaining and special casing wanderers and static's.
        These intricacies are not necessary, although it is suggested that your
        puller learn them in time. For Fire Giants, you don't need to use any
        special tricks. Just make sure the puller knows when he has a wanderer
        on him, and not to return to the group unless he's sure that wanderer is
        no longer aggro.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The first part of the Fire Giant run is,
        probably, the hardest part. If people are going to die on the run,
        chances are this is where it will occur. There may be a better way to do
        this, but we haven't found it out. Basically, you are going to have to
        deal with at least two Fire Giants at once, and possibly a third
        depending on how fast you are.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Have your puller go into the first room
        at <strong>C1</strong> and feign there. He should stay feigned and wait
        for the patroller, <strong>G3</strong>, to come and go. Once he thinks <strong>G3</strong>
        is far enough out of aggro range, all the groups should be buffed up and
        run into the room <strong>C1</strong> and attack the giants. How to best
        deal with fighting two or three at once is up to the group. Usually
        Togor's Insects and a secondary tank taunting the second giant will do
        the trick. After the first two giants (<strong>G1 </strong>and <strong>G2</strong>),
        the patroller <strong>G3</strong> should about be ready to come back.
        Your party should be ready for him and kill him. After these three
        giants are dead, the area is secure and your party is pretty much good
        to go. No other giants come near here, so your group can rest up and get
        full. Patience is an important virtue when doing Fire Giants, and with a
        6 hour spawn time, there is no need to rush things, especially on your
        first few runs.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">After you resurrect everyone that died
        and get everyone to full, you can start pulling the Fire Giants.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Note: Currently on Cazic-Thule, and
        perhaps other servers, the wanderers in the Fire Giant area are bugged,
        and instead of walking around, they teleport from place to place. If
        allowed to run, they can call reinforcements from anywhere along their
        path, even if the reinforcements are way out of aggro range. The first
        wanderer can pull Tranix if this teleport bug exists. Beware.</em></font></p>
        <p><strong><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#990000"><a name="Tranix">Tranix</a>
        Section</font> -</font><font face="Arial" size="1"> <a href="#Fire Giant">top</a></font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For this entire section, your party
        should be fighting at <strong>C1</strong>. No one should leave the room
        except the pullers.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The first pull will be painful for the
        puller. The puller should move forward up to the entrance to the castle.
        Just past the doors at <strong>N2</strong> are two Fire Giants. The
        puller should aggro these guys and run back towards the group, feigning
        at <strong>F1</strong>. On this first pull, you will aggro King Tranix,
        who is close enough to the other giants to come charging at you. King
        Tranix is a shadow knight, and has a nasty Harm Touch which the puller
        will definitely notice. In any of the next 5 pulls you might get King
        Tranix. Treat Tranix as any other Fire Giant, and he should fall pretty
        easily when alone. The chain puller should be waiting around the corner
        for the signal from the primary puller. When the primary puller tells
        him, he should round the corner and aggro the (hopefully) single fire
        giant standing above the puller's body.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Depending on which Fire Giants you kill
        in this round, you should get either one or two FGs on the next pull. If
        you get Tranix early, it will make the rest of this a little easier.
        I'll assume you don't get Tranix on these, and instead kill <strong>G4</strong>
        and <strong>G5</strong>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If Tranix is alive, and you get unlucky,
        you will now have to pull the throne room, which include Tranix, <strong>G6,
        G7, </strong>and possible <strong>G8.</strong> The puller should pull
        these in the same way, although the run will now be longer, and the door
        at N2 might make things hurt a little more. If you have a spare necro, shadow knight,
        or monk handy, they should be able to stay at the door and keep it open
        for the puller, saving him a few hit points.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">After running all four of these guys back
        to <strong>F1</strong> and killing them one by one, you should be clear
        to do Skarlon. By this point, all the giants from <strong>G1-G8</strong>
        and <strong>Tranix</strong> should all be dead. Tranix drops the
        Polished Mithril Torque (common) and the Crown of King Tranix (rare).
        The Torque is generally considered an item for hybrids (rangers,
        paladins, and shadow knights), while the crown is mainly used by
        enchanters and bards, as well as monks.</font></p>

        Section</font> </font><font face="Arial" size="1">- <a href="#Fire Giant">top</a></font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now, depending on how much trust you have
        in your party's abilities to follow directions, you can either have
        everyone move forward to <strong>C2</strong>, or have everyone stay at <strong>C1</strong>
        for the next two pulls. If your group chooses to stay at <strong>C1, </strong>the
        puller will have a painful pull, but since it's only two giants, it
        shouldn't be too much of a problem. If you choose to move up to <strong>C2</strong>,
        make sure that everyone knows that they should stay along the <strong>left</strong>
        (That is the <strong>east</strong>) wall in the throne room, and <strong>not</strong>
        to fight near the west wall, where they can end up aggroing FGs through
        the wall.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If staying at <strong>C1</strong>, pull <strong>Skarlon</strong>
        and <strong>G9</strong> the same was that you pulled Tranix, and then
        have everyone move up to <strong>C2</strong>. If you decide to fight at <strong>C2</strong>,
        then have everyone stay up against the wall, have the primary puller
        feign at <strong>F2</strong>, such that the chain puller can see the
        giants through the doorway. When the puller gives the signal, the chain
        puller should get the single FG and bring it back to the party at <strong>C2</strong>.
        After killing <strong>G9 </strong>and<strong> Skarlon</strong>, you are
        now clear to wander around the throne room, take screenshots, etc.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Skarlon drops the Mithril Vambraces
        (rare), the Mithril Greaves (common), and the Razing Sword of Skarlon
        (very rare). The Greaves are mainly for Rogues and Rangers, the
        Vambraces are good for Warriors, Paladins, Shadow knights, Rangers, and
        Rogues. The Razing Sword is great for Paladins and Shadow knights, and
        good for Warriors as well.</font></p>
        <p><strong><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#990000"><a name="Bridge">Bridge</a>
        Section</font> -&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial" size="1"> <a href="#Fire Giant">top</a></font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The next few pulls are probably the
        easiest set. Your group should be set up at <strong>C2</strong>, and
        your puller needs to pull <strong>G10, G11, </strong>and the wanderer, <strong>G12</strong>
        from across the drawbridge, and feign at <strong>F3</strong>. Standard
        chain pulling works fine here, and the chain puller has a very short run
        back to the group. The only thing to watch out for here is the
        drawbridge closing. If it does close, it can be opened by the chain
        puller on the near side, or a lever on the far side located at <strong>N3</strong>.
        After killing these three guys, have your puller get all the hp buffs
        possible and prepare for the hardest set of pulls. If you have multiple
        monks/shadow knights, now is the best time to make use of them and set
        up a chain.</font></p>
        <p><strong><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#990000"><a name="Dragon">Dragon</a>
        Head Room</font> </font><font face="Arial" size="1">- <a href="#Fire Giant">top</a></font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">These pulls are especially hard because
        you will have a total of four giants attacking you, and need to pull
        them a pretty good distance. Plus, due to the location of the
        drawbridge, your chain puller will have slight difficulty as well. The
        way we handle this is to have a 3rd party member, usually a warrior or
        other tank, assigned to drawbridge duty. They will stand before the
        drawbridge, off to the side and out of line of sight. Whenever the
        drawbridge closes, they will re-open it. This is a must, because if your
        chain puller can't feign, and the drawbridge is up when he is chaining,
        he will almost certainly die.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The primary puller should aggro the four
        giants in what is called the dragon head room (<strong>G13 - G16</strong>).
        He should then run back towards the bridge and feign at <strong>F4</strong>.
        If he can't make it that far, feigning anywhere on the bridge is fine as
        well. Some pullers prefer to have Dead Man Floating for this part,
        because of the danger of falling into the lava. I'm not too scared of
        the lava, and prefer not to have DMF on me, mostly so that I can jump to
        make the pull just that much faster.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The secondary puller should be waiting by
        the drawbridge and out of line of sight. When the monk says it's clear
        to pull, he'll run across the drawbridge, tag the single fire giant, and
        run back to the party. The person on drawbridge duty will follow behind
        the chain puller as well and the group will work on killing the giant.
        The primary puller can stand up, make sure he's clear, and open the
        drawbridge himself with the lever.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The second pull will be slightly easier,
        since there will only be three giants left. And the third pull should be
        quite easy. Rather than pull the fourth guy all the way, I have my party
        move up to the next point and fight him there.</font></p>
        <p><strong><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#990000"><a name="Rokyl">Rokyl</a>
        Section</font> </font><font face="Arial" size="1">- <a href="#Fire Giant">top</a></font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The final part of the Fire Giant run is
        the coolest, where the party gets to see some awesome architecture, and
        maybe Nagafen himself. At this point, you should only have one giant in <strong>G13-G16</strong>
        left. The entire party should move up to <strong>C3</strong>. when doing
        this, have one person in the party assigned to open the drawbridge. Make
        sure everyone else knows not to touch it. If your party isn't the
        brightest lot, have a necro cast Dead Man Floating on all of them. I
        can't tell you how many times I've seen people die because someone else
        closed the drawbridge at the wrong time. If someone does fall in the
        lava, don't panic. There's an easy way out at <strong>N1</strong>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Once everyone in the group has gotten to <strong>C3</strong>,
        you are ready for the final set of pulls. First pull the last remaining
        giant in the dragon head room. After he's been eliminated, get your
        puller buffed up with magic resist, and have him get ready for the final
        1-3 pulls. By this time everyone is usually tired, so a lot of times
        it's best to just get Rokyl on the first pull. Especially if Nagafen is
        in, where pulling Rokyl when he's the last one alive is quite a pain.
        Rokyl is a wanderer, so pulling him alone shouldn't be too hard if you
        know how to isolate wanderers.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If the puller aggros either <strong>G17 </strong>of
        <strong>G18</strong>, Rokyl may or may not aggro to you depending on
        where along his path he is. It's best to get him to aggro to you for
        reasons I'll explain later. If Nagafen is in, he'll aggro as well. Enjoy
        the claws for 225, and run as quickly as possible to <strong>F5</strong>.
        Feign there. Nagafen won't follow you this far, but the other 3 will. If
        you think you can get Rokyl easily alone, get him now. Once you kill
        Rokyl, you can consider the FG run over. Or, you might want to finish
        the job and get <strong>G17 </strong>and <strong>G18</strong> as well.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you kill <strong>G17 </strong>and <strong>G18
        </strong>before killing Rokyl, you have one of two situations to deal
        with. If Nagafen isn't alive, your party can pretend Rokyl is Nagafen,
        and charge him in Naggy's lair and kill him off. This is probably the
        most fun. If Nagafen is alive, then buff your puller and pray. Have him
        run into the lair and aggro either Nagafen or Rokyl. They will both
        obviously aggro. Now your puller has to make a somewhat long run back to
        <strong>F5</strong>, where your chain puller can pick off Rokyl and
        finish him off.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Magi Rokyl is a wizard, and drops the
        Polished Mithril Mask (common), and Rokyl's Channeling Crystal (rare).
        The mask is great for int casters, and good for priest classes as well
        (for the AC). The channeling crystal is pretty good for int casters.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">And now you should be finished with the
        Fire Giants, and you can pack up and head out. Evac the tanks out,
        unless they feel confident running through the bats and bugs to get to
        lavastorm. If everyone still wants to do something, head to the Efreeti
        Lord or kill the stone spider. There's no real point to waiting around
        for a respawn, since it is 6+ hours.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Notes</strong></font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>N1 - </strong>If you fall into
            the lava here, most likely due to a drawbridge problem, don't panic.
            Swim around to N1, where you can get back onto dry land.</font>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>N2 - </strong>There's a door
            here that you need to open. If you are pulling Tranix's room, the
            door will probably close before you get back. This means you'll take
            a couple more seconds of damage waiting for it to open.</font>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>N3 - </strong>There is a
            switch here that will open the drawbridge from this side.</font>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>N4 - </strong>There is a door
            here which is considered the final door to Nagafen's Lair. If you
            don't open this door, nothing on the inside (Two guards, Rokyl, and
            Nagafen) should aggro to you. If you are planning on charging the
            lair, have your group line up before the door, but don't open the
            door till you are ready to charge.</font>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>N5</strong> - If you fall into
            the lava here, usually during the initial break, you can swim up the
            lava river to the northwest. You should arrive at land near the
            stone spider room. If you keep swimming up this way, you'll get to
            near the noble room. If someone dies in the lava here, you'll need
            to drag their corpse to the stone spider area.</font></li>
