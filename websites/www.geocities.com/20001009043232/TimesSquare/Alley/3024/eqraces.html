<!--LINE1-->
<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="trans/transline2.gif"></P></CENTER><br>

<p><center>BARBARIAN</center><br>
Barbarians hail from the city of Halas, in the continent of Antonica.  Their size is large and have the special ability of "slaming".  However, this advantage is balanced by their inability to see in the dark.  Classes open to the Barbarian are Rogue, Shaman, and Warrior.  They are best suited for the Warrior class.<br>
<br>
<center>DARK ELF</center><br>
Dark Elves call the city of Neriak, in the continent of Antonica their home.  Their size is small and are blessed with the ability to hide and UltraVision.  Their evil nature, however, disadvantages them to a degree.  Classes open to Dark Elves are Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer, Rogue, ShadowKnight, Warrior and Wizard.  Because of their evil ways, they do not make very good clerics and the Paladin profession is totally closed to them.  However, they do make good Enchanters, Necromancers, Wizards and Magicians.<br>
<br>
<center>DWARF</center><br>

Under the rule of King Underfoot, the dwarves hail from the city of Kaladim in the continent of Faydwer.  Their size is small, have Infravision and a very well developed Sense Heading skill.

<br>
<center>ERUDITE</center><br>

However, like their Barbarian cousins, they have no night vision.  Classes available to Erudites are Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer, Paladin, and Wizard.  Erudites make the ULTIMATE Necromancers in all of Norrath.<br>
<br>

These are: Bard, Cleric, Druid, Enchanter, Magician, Monk, Necromancer, Paladin, Rogue, ShadowKnight, Warrior and Wizard.  The Human race is the only one in Norrath that can be Monks.<br>
<br>
<center>OGRE</center><br>
Ogres are ugly.  Their size is large and they hail from the city of Oggok in the continent of Antonica.  They have UltraVision and the ability to bash but they are EVIIIL, and their nature disadvantages them.  They can only be ShadowKnights, Shamans and Warriors.  Since they are mentally challenged, their best profession is Warrior.<br>
<br>
<center>TROLL</center><br>
Trolls are much Uglier than Ogres.  They hail from the city of Grobb in the continent of Antonica.  Their size is small and they also have the advantage of InfraVision and starting with regeneration and slaming ability.  However, their evil nature works against them.
