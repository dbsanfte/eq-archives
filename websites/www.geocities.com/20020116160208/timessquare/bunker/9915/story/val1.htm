  <h1>Valoris Sicarius</h1>
  <p align="left"><b>The night was cold and dark. Too cold and too dark for the 
    bard's liking. The journey had been a long and hard one. Even the speedy notes 
    of his Accelerando had not made the journey a short one. "The first order 
    of business", he thought, "is to find an inn." "I need a place to rest my 
    cold and weary bones". He found a likely looking prospect and ducked in to 
    escape the cold. Making his way straight to the fire, he began to look about 
    the common room, as was his custom. Nothing appeared any different than at 
    any of the other inns he frequented. Merchants, serving girls, and patrons 
    all mingled causing much commotion and noise. The bard was just about to approach 
    the innkeeper when he noticed a small void in the far corner of the common 
    room. The light thrown off from the various torches that were placed about 
    the room seemed to shrink away from this corner. Even the proximity of the 
    fire could not break through the shadows that seemed to have a will of their 
    own. Inexplicably, the bard felt himself drawn to the darkness. "This is no 
    time to lose my courage", he thought. He snagged a flagon of ale from a passing 
    bar maid and drained it in short order. He stood and made his way to the foreboding 
    corner. As he neared his destination, he noticed that there was a figure sitting 
    clothed in the shadows. He glanced nervously around the room to see if anyone 
    else saw the dark patron. No one else seemed to notice the figure, or if they 
    did, they paid him no heed. They simply carried on with their lives as if 
    the light were not swallowed by this shadowy man. </b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>"Good evening", the dark one said. "You seem to be weary 
    friend. Pull a chair to the table and rest yourself." The bard was beginning 
    to believe that he wanted nothing to do with this one, but he was loathe to 
    do anything that might give his would-be host a reason to take offense. A 
    sense of danger clothed the man just as the shadows in which he seemed so 
    comfortable. Whether from a feeling of curiosity about what the stranger wanted 
    or from his fear of the man, the bard did as his host suggested. When he had 
    seated himself, the bard spoke the question that he had been asking himself 
    since he first laid eyes on the man. "Who are you," he said. The man watched 
    the bard for a long time. When he finally spoke, his voice was low. "I don't 
    know why I am about to tell you my story, bard. I have consumed a great deal 
    of wine this evening. Perhaps that is it. It could also be that the anniversary 
    of my family's slaughter is weighing especially heavy on me this season. Alas, 
    I truly do not know. Regardless of the reason, rest assured that all you are 
    about to hear is true. When I am finished, you may do with the information 
    what you will. Make it into a tale to be told at other inns across Norrath, 
    or forget it for all I care. This is the story of my journey into things dark 
    and terrible. It is the story of the slaughter of my family. It contains the 
    vision that haunts my nights and causes every sleep to be filled with countless 
    nightmares. It is the reason I hunt the quarry I do with such reckless abandon. 
    Hear me now. My name is Valoris Sicarius. I am a Shadow Knight of Innoruuk 
    and this is my tale" </b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>"It begins on a cold night in Halas. All nights in Halas 
    are cold, but this one was bitter even by the standards of the Barbarians 
    that call Halas home. My father was a blacksmith and a very good one. We lived 
    in Halas because of honor. My father believed greatly in the power of honor. 
    Many times when I was a child I would sit and listen to my father tell me 
    the stories of how, in his younger days, he was a warrior. His absolute favorite 
    story was the one that precluded our move to Halas.</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b> He fought with a band of warriors that came from all different 
    lands and backgrounds. I would sit and watch as his eyes would take on an 
    inner light and he would tell of how their mighty band of warriors would scour 
    the countryside, cleansing the land of Norrath of all evil. Orcs, Dervish 
    bands, Gnolls, no evil was safe from their onslaught. Then he would begin 
    to tell THE story. 'Son,' he would say, 'you have to surround yourself with 
    good strong friends. They will watch your back for you when things get rough.' 
    He told of one particular battle in the depths of the dungeon known as Blackburrow. 
    His band of warriors had fought down to the depths of the foul place, and 
    was locked in mortal combat with many Gnolls. My father's band had been doing 
    well, but their numbers began to wane. One by one the mighty heroes fell to 
    the wicked Gnoll blades. Wave upon wave the Elite Gnoll Guards came. At this 
    point my father would develop a haunted look, as he would tell of the death 
    of many of his friends. The Gnolls, sensing the tide of battle turning in 
    their favor, pressed on all the harder. My father's warriors, who had been 
    over 50 in number when they entered, had fallen to 5. That number shrank to 
    432 Realizing that they were doomed, my father and his remaining companion 
    made their way to a large crevasse in the rock wall. My father was going to 
    use the crevasse to guard his back while he and his companion made the Gnolls 
    victory a costly one. As the battle grew feverish, my fathers remaining friend 
    fell to a Gnoll blade. As my father watched him fall, he lost his concentration 
    just long enough to let a dirty Gnoll rake his ribs with cold steel. 'I thought 
    I was a dead man, son,' he would say and then the light would flare in his 
    eyes. 'Son, I have never heard a war cry as loud or as frightening as Ashmal 
    let out that day.' Ashmal was the leader of a band of Barbarian warriors who 
    had decided that they had had enough of the Gnolls raiding parties coming 
    through the Everfrost peaks and invading their homeland. The Barbarians broke 
    through the Gnoll resistance and slayed the Gnoll commander. He was the one 
    that had slashed my father's ribs. When the battle had ended Ashmal took my 
    father back to Halas and looked after him until he had recovered. My father's 
    first act upon his recovery was to return to his own homeland, gather his 
    wife and his newly born son and move to Halas. He remained there, using his 
    blacksmithing skills for the Barbarians. He could have made much more money 
    if he had moved to a more cosmopolitan area, but he refused to forget that 
    he owed his continued existence to Ashmal."</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b> Here the dark one paused. It seemed to the bard that his 
    shadowy friend was lost in thought. Barely a moment passed though until the 
    story resumed. The stranger had an inner fire now. It was if the fire in the 
    hearth had jumped into the man's eyes. The bard knew that whatever force drove 
    this man, consumed him in its strength. </b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>"You will have to forgive me if my story is a little disjointed 
    but, as I said before, it causes me great pain. My family was always close. 
    My father loved my mother and I dearly and mother thought the sun rose and 
    set in my father. My childhood was truly wonderful until the Wyrm Bitch came." 
    At the mention of this name, the stranger took on an incredible menace. "As 
    I said in the opening of my tale, the night was bitterly cold. We were gathered 
    around the fire, listening to the 1000th retelling of my father's war stories 
    (we could never get enough of them). I distinctly remember the screams first. 
    Father told us to stay inside while he checked things out, but in my youth 
    I had to see what was going on. I snuck around to the window and peered outside. 
    There were people everywhere. Runningscreaming I had never seen the people 
    of Halas so terrified in all my life. Then I saw her for the first time in 
    my life. Vox, the Wyrm Bitch. I refuse to call her 'Lady' as she has never 
    been, nor will ever be worthy of that title. She had decided to come to Halas 
    and put these people in their place. Not too much earlier the Barbarians had 
    unceremoniously ousted a group of humans who were in Halas to 'spread the 
    teachings of Veeshan.' The Wyrm Bitch had taken offense at this it seemed 
    and had come to wreck the village. She was on a direct course for our hut. 
    My father rushed back into the house and grabbed my mother and me and we joined 
    the throng of people as we rushed toward any safety we could find. My father 
    decided that she would not take his family from him without a fight and so 
    he turned to face her. My mother sensing his absence from her side, turned 
    and ran back to him pleading for him not to do this foolish, albeit noble 
    thing. I had no idea that they were gone. When I realized it, I turned just 
    in time to see the Wyrm Bitch slaughter my parents. I screamed in horror and 
    turned to run away. After all, she had just slain my father, who was to me, 
    the greatest warrior of all time. What chance did a 6 year old by stand? None. 
    In my haste to get away, I tripped and fell. I landed on the broken remains 
    of a sword. Evidently my father wasn't the first to have tasted the wrath 
    of the Wyrm Bitch. The broken sword slashed my face and took my eye. That 
    is why you see me wear the patch that I do. Everything in my life that has 
    gone wrong, I contribute to the Wyrm Bitch."</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b> The bard sat in awe. "That is terrible," he said. The shadow 
    knight stared into his wine. When he resumed speaking his voice carried an 
    almost fatalistic quality. "Many years have past since that horrible night 
    in Halas. I have since devoted my life to the extermination of Vox, the Wyrm 
    Bitch. If it is the last thing I do in this world, I intend to slay her and 
    piss on her cold lifeless corpse. Why, you might ask, have I not chosen one 
    of the 'Good' professions to further my ultimate goals? Well, that is another 
    tale. On which would require too much time in the telling. Let us suffice 
    it to say that it has occurred to me that this is the easiest way. Not noble, 
    you say? To take the quick path and forsake my father's belief in Honor? Guilty 
    as charged. When the Wyrm Bitch has been annihilated, then I might try to 
    discover the path to Honor. Until then, however, I will remain the way I am 
    because I believe it brings me closer to the demise of Vox. As to why I am 
    a follower of Innoruuk, it seems that all he requires is an offering of hate. 
    I have hate unfailing for the Wyrm Bitch. I will continue to hate her, her 
    minions and all associated with her forever."</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b> "Surely you can not hope to defeat a foe of Vox's might 
    by yourself," the bard said skeptically. "Are you offering your aid?" the 
    dark one asked. "No, of course not. Not that it isn't a worthy causeI it's 
    just" sputtered the bard. "I understand," chuckled the knight. "I didn't 
    mean to stop your heart." The bard idly wondered if that were within the shadow 
    knight's powers. "I have allied myself with a guild of heroes that journey 
    across Norrath. They call themselves the Alliance of Respect. They will, when 
    the time comes, aid me in my quest. I can't help but hear my father's words 
    'Son,' he would say, 'you have to surround yourself with good strong friends. 
    They will watch your back for you when things get rough.' It was one of his 
    favorite sayings." The shadow knight drained the last of the wine. "Well bard, 
    I appreciate the ear you have given to my tale. Mayhap we will meet again 
    at a later date. If we still both live." "Pray that is the case," replied 
    the bard. "If we do," said the knight, " then I may tell you a bit more of 
    my tale."</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b> The bard rose to go. He started toward the bar to order 
    a drink. Halfway there, the thought of a question that he wished to ask the 
    shadow knight. Turning, the bard's gaze met nothing. The knight was gone. 
    Even the shadows from which the knight had spoken had dissipated. The bard 
    could not suppress a shiver. "Farewell Dark Knight," the bard whispered. "May 
    you find the vengeance you desire, and the redemption that I believe you truly 
    seek." </b></p>
