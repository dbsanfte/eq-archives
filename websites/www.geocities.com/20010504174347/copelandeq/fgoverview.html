<h1>Fire Giant Raid Overview</h1>

The purpose of this guide is to give the participant
of the raid some idea of what will happen. It is not intended to describe
where the giants spawn  and how to get at them. Hopefully, you won't
have to worry about that until you're part of the pull team. If you care,
however, you can find one of those at 
<A HREF="http://monks.volitionx.com/firegiants.htm">Relentless|Monks</A>.

The base maps are lifted from 
<A HREF="http://www.nx.sakura.ne.jp/~chizuya/indexe.html">Quester
of Norrath</A> because they do such nice ones...annotations then were added.
If they complain, I'll take them off.

<h3>Some Intro</h3>
Expect the raid to take about 3 hours.
It can go more quickly. It can got a lot longer...a <I>lot</I> longer
(if you know what I mean...).

<P>Most raids I've seen had 18-24 participants.
I've done it with 12; I've read of very experienced single groups doing
it. 30 starts to be a little silly and raises the issue of lag problems.

<P>If all goes well, you can reasonably expect
not to die...unlike, say, on the Planes. *grin*

<hr>
<h3>Getting There</h3>
Raids usually start by gathering at the druid ring in Lavastorm.

<P>From Lavastorm, the groups proceed through
SolB to the <I>Stone Spider Room</I> ("<I>Stoney</I>") for the final staging.
The progress through SolB is usually incremental to make sure everyone
keeps up and to provide enough firepower to clear rooms that aren't camped.
You will move through a small part of the Greater Kobold Section and a
good portion of the Bat/Bug Section to reach your destination.

<P><B>Make sure you know how to get to <I>Bat1</I>,
<I>Nox</I>, <I>Room Before Stoney</I>, and <I>Stoney</I> without getting
too lost</B>.

<P>The green path on the next image shows
the route. The dotted portion at the end shows the route of the charge
up the ramp used after buffing.

<P>If you're delayed a bit, and encounter
more resistance from the denizens of SolB than you can handle, it's usually
best to give an /ooc to see if you can train the group waiting for you...rather
than to keep returning to the zone and holding up the raid.

<P>Stop once you get to <I>Stoney</I>; <B>do
not run up the ramp to take a peek.</B> You will actually be in the
aggro radius of the first giants before you even see them.
<CENTER><IMG SRC="maps/thrusol.jpg" ></CENTER>

<P>The final prep for the raid will be done
in <I>Stoney</I>. This includes buffing, final group adjustments, selecting
primary and secondary assists, last minute warnings, etc. At some point,
you will be ready to start the attack by charging the first room.

<hr>
<h3>General Notes</h3>

These points apply throughout the raid. Further
points specific to a given fight will be found in sections below.
<UL>
  <LI>
  A primary and secondary assist will be designated
  by the raid leader. Make a hotkey to assist those folks. Do not engage
  any fire giant unless you use this hotkey.</LI>

  <LI>
  Communicate through your group leader.
  Report status to him and he will report it to the raid leader. Let
  your group leader report deaths and link deaths. <I>Really</I> try
  to minimize tells to the raid leader; he's getting 20 a minute without
  your help.</LI>

  <LI>
  Fight only in the designated spots. Do not
  rush forward to meet the incoming giants; let the puller bring them to
  you. Chain pulling will be used in certain places and, if you run forward,
  you can foul it up royally.</LI>

  <LI>
  Do not wander away from your group. You can
  accidentally aggro fire giants you don't even see. Even going backwards
  you can pull up wandering bugs on the party.</LI>

  <LI>
  Keep your pets under control! Do not summon
  pets unless the raid leader has said it is Ok to do so. Do not let your
  pet wander, chase a MOB, or rush forward to engage a MOB. Have Invisibility
  always memorized in order to kill a pet that wanders beyond the range of
  /pet get lost.</LI>

  <LI>
  Don't try to Mez or Stun a fire giant. It
  won't work. You can charm them.</LI>

  <LI>
  Turn off as much battle spam as you can. This
  includes your misses, others misses, others hits, spells, etc. Not only
  does this lower video lag, but it enables you to see shouted instructions.</LI>

  <LI>
  Do not decide on your own to evac or camp
  out from a Fire Giant Raid. The raid leader is the only one who makes that
  call. In other words, fight until you win, you die, or the raid leader
  tells you to evac.</LI>

  <LI>
  Do not use DoTs on the giants; you can cause
  the corpses to poof.</LI>

  <LI>
  If told to "Back up," then back up!! You may
  be forcing the giant up or into a wall, or into lava, or into dangerous
  aggro territory.</LI>
</UL>

<hr>
<h3>#1 - First Room</h3>
If all goes well, this will be the biggest
fight. You will charge up the ramp into the first room. <B>Do not stop
on the bridge!</B> If you do, folks will die. Someone will fall in. Or,
a fire giant will fall in and summon folks into the lava. Get all the way
into the room and then fight in the middle of the room by the large urns.

<P>You will meet 2-3 fire giants in this room.
Make sure you use /assist so that you are fighting the same thing that
the main assist is fighting. Generally pets should not be used in this
first room because of the difficulty of keeping them where they need to
be.

<P>If you're a tank, you may be designated
as an Enchanter's Assistant. This requires you to target and attack
the giants <U>not</U> being attacked by the main assist. Your job
is to hit, kick, bash, slam, taunt, nuke it until the enchanter gets it
under control, and to repeat the process as necessary when the Charm breaks.
You'll know that the enchanter has it because either: a) they will tell
you, or b) you will no longer be doing any damage, or c) you will see the
"My leader is..." type of message. At that point, you switch back
to helping the main assist...keeping an eye out for your enchanter saying
things like "Get it off me!" to indicate the Charm has broken.

<P>As a tank, there is a possibility you may
get designated for Taunt Duty. It is imperative in this fight (and the
other multiple-giant fights) to keep the clerics alive. If you get assigned
this duty, and one of the giants starts to beat upon your caster buddies,
get over there and taunt it off him/her. You may take a beating, but your
cleric will be working to keep you alive and the enchanter will be trying
very hard to take a giant or two out of the fight. In all likelihood,
however, this will be the job of the Enchanter and Enchanter's Assistant.
<BR>

<hr>
<h3>#2 - Alongside the Lava</h3>
When instructed, move up to the second fight
point. As you come out of the hallway from the first room, make sure you
move up to your right (north). <B>Stay tight to that north wall during
the upcoming pulls.</B> If you creep forward, you can aggro the giants
being brought out by the primary puller for chaining, ruining everyone's
day. Obviously, don't fall into the lava. Not so obviously, don't force
a giant backwards into the lava unless you like being summoned in after
him. At some point here you will get to fight the first of the named spawns,
King Tranix. He's an SK, but the puller will already have taken his Harm
Touch.
<hr>
<h3>
#3 - Skarlon</h3>
Eventually you will be told to move up to
the throne room. Move to the point marked #4--though the next battle will
be at the point marked #3. Do not go over and take a peek down the hallway
toward #3; you don't want the giants in the room deciding to see who is
in their foyer.

<P>This is usually another "Charge!" fight
as you engage the second named spawn, Warlord Skarlon. You will rush in
to Skarlon's room, kill him, then kill his buddy. Don't attack the wrong
giant; use /assist.

<hr>
<h3>#4 - Clearing toward Rokyl</h3>
Moving back to #4, you will have a series
of giants pulled in to you for killing. Use /assist. Fight in the
center of the room.
<hr>

<h3>Moving Across the Drawbridge</h3>
You will be told to move up to the middle
platform. To do this, you have to cross the @#$%!&^ drawbridge that
is seemingly demon possessed. This drawbridge is bugged and sometimes goes
up and down of its own accord. If you're on it when this happens, you fall
into the lava. Note on the map the point to get out of the lava!

<P><B>Do not try to make things better by
working the drawbridge lever on the middle platform!</B>
Let me say that a different way: <B>Leave the drawbridge lever alone!</B>
Let the raid leader handle that aspect of things. Just run quickly across
when you can and get up to the middle platform. Do not go beyond it.

<hr>
<h3>#5 - Rokyl</h3>
When told to do so, move up to the point marked
#5 from the middle platform and fight the giant(s) that will be there.
<B>Stay tight into the corner during the coming battles.</B> As pulls are
brought to you, do not rush forward to meet them or let your pets rush
forward. Depending upon how the puller wants to do things, you may be asked
to return down to the middle platform between pulls. Hopefully, this will
be a series of small fights. It might get nasty if things go wrong, but
that just makes it more interesting. At some point in these fights you
will meet the third and last of the named spawns, Magi Rokyl.

<hr>
<h3>Split Remaining Loot and Leave</h3>
You're done!

<P>If Nagy is not up, you can run down and
see his chamber.

<P>Shout a warning if you plan to run out
to the SolB zone, because the bugs and bats will have spawned behind you,
and there's a good chance you will create a train.
