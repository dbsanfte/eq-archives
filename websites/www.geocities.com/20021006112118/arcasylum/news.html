	    Very sorry for the delay in posting. Turns out it actually takes
            time to get xp. Since I last got my act together, AA has been 
            killing stuff like crazy, including our first of many Vindi
            kills. The vindictive bastage hid in the wall upon death, so no
            good pictures of his dead body, but here's a few other pics to
            tide you over...

	    Congrats to everyone on a job well done in ToV this past weekend!
            Lots of good loot, lots of meeting new people, lots of learning.
            <P>
            Also, as you probably noticed, the new roster isn't available yet.
            I'm a slacking bastage. Consequently, the date by which you must 
            be registered to receive loot will not be enforced. Once the new
            roster is available, a new date will be established.

	    As an important change in guild policy, as of August 7th we will no
            longer be granting loot to any guild member who has not properly
            registered and designated their guilded characters on the guild 
            roster. You can find more details

	    The password for the private boards and calendars has changed. As
            has always been guild policy, contact an officer in-game to find 
            the new password. We're also working on a new, secure way to 
            distribute password changes. Hopefully that will be in place by 
            the next password change.

	    I don't want to alarm anyone, but I believe I've fixed the calendar.
            You should now be able to log in using the username 'member' and 
            the same password you use to access our private boards. As always,
            if you need this password, you must contact an officer in-game. As
            I've done with other web page features, the calendar will feature
            a rudimentary menu at the top when viewed in its own window, and 
            no such menu when viewed from within our web page. As has always
            been the case, only officers can add or edit events on the calendar,
            but they can do so based on events in the Scheduled Raids forum 
            when details of those raids become sufficiently concrete.

	    I've tinkered with various things lately, notably:
            <UL>
               <LI>I separated active from ex-members in the Magelo profiles
                   and photo album.
                   If you ended up in the wrong list, don't panic; it just 
                   means you and I haven't spoken recently enough.
               <LI>I changed the colors on the forums to match the web page.
               <LI>I fiddled with the menu at the top of the forums. If you are
                   viewing the forums from within the web page, that menu should
                   not be needed, and is now not displayed to save space. If you
                   view the forums in their own window, that menu should still
                   appear.

	    I migrated most of the web page from my personal site back to
            GeoCities. This has several effects, some good, some bad.
            <UL>
            <LI>The irritating ad window is back
            <LI>The irritating ad window sometimes gets JavaScript errors.
            <LI>I don't need to worry about overflowing my web site quotas.
            <LI>With any luck we'll fix the problems with forum and roster logons.

            It was a relatively big change, so <A HREF="mailto:dave@pattyanddave.com">let me know</A> if you see problems.
            I'll also be curious if this helps with the forum login problem.

	    The roster link should now be working. Active members should go to
	    GuildMagic and add themself to the guild. There is a mysterious 
	    second guild named Arcane Asylum with 0 members. Don't join that one.
	    Also, when you join you won't immediately show up on the roster.
	    You need to be approved by the leaders. So don't panic.
            <P>
	    I also fixed the link to the calendar from the front page, though
	    it has no events on it and I seem to be the only one who remembers
	    the password. He he... knowledge is power. As soon as I'm able, I'll
	    get the password set to something you might be able to use and we
	    can start using it again.

            I'm aware some folks are having a problem where they lose their
            ezBoard login if they go to pour guild page from the web page. No
            clue at all what could be causing it, but I'll try to play around
            and make it go away sometime soon.
            <P>
            Another heads up - sometime soon I'll either be removing people who
            aren't currently in AA from the Magelo and Photo Album pages, or at
            least splitting them out separate from current members.
