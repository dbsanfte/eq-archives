      <P align="LEFT"> Kindoz. Many wonder about his childhood; few know. He knows 
        nothing more of his father than that he was an elven bard of the name 
        Albanaral Nightlark. He fears what he might do if he were to learn more. 
        His first actual memory was of being lost in the Western Plains of Karana. 
        He was only three years old at the time and was attacked and badly beaten. 
        Before his life slipped away, he felt the healing touch of a woman paladin 
        who Laid Hands upon him. The woman decimated his attacker and brought 
        him with her to the Temple of Thunder in Qeynos.
      <P align="LEFT">The paladin took Kindoz under her wing, teaching him privately. 
        This special attention garnered the resentment and cajolerie of his peers 
        who mocked him for being trained by a woman. When the time for final trials 
        came, however, Kindoz bested all his opponents. By this time, young Kindoz 
        had become quite self reliant, thinking himself impervious to the slings 
        of jealousy. Then one day the female paladin didn't come home.
      <P align="LEFT">Distraught at the absence of his mentor and friend, Kindoz 
        left Qeynos to adventure through Norrath. Over those first few years, 
        he made several friends and came to form the Avenging Storm, a guild dedicated 
        to preserving and promoting the good of Norrath. He met and fell in love 
        with Shara, a half elf paladin. Their love was not in the stars, however, 
        and Karana turned his face away from Shara, resulting in her death and 
        two episodes of rebirth. Lost to the world, Kindoz looked for a shoulder 
        to cry on but found much more in Taliana. Kindoz found room in his heart 
        to love the half elf ranger, and they were married shortly after. The 
        two adopted Carthiny Hopebringer and had two children of their own, Meggan 
        and Catrina.
