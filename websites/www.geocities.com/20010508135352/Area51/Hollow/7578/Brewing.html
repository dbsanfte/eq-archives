                          When Sara goes to move barley<p>
                           He meets a girl named Darley<p>
                              To the cask in the vault<p>
                              He adds hops and malt<p>
                        And he drinks till her face isn’t gnarly<p>

                             With hops malt and yeast<p>
                          An ogre made mead for a feast<p>
                             When his cask they did fill<p>
                               Not a drop did he spill<p>
                         So they cheered for the ugly beast<p>

                         My good friend where is my cask? <p>
                           Is the water too much to ask? <p>
                              Deliver barley and hops<p>
                             With the rest of my crops<p>
                         Or your death will be my next task!<p>

                        Ogre's lust for a wench named Sulock<p>
                        For a date bring a cask and a froglok<p>
                            Malt and yeast to the barber<p>
                             Get them near her harbor<p>
                       And you'll hear an uproar if they dock</center><p>
In order to brew anything you must first acquire the proper ingredients, and then find a
   still (Also known as a brew barrel). It looks like this:
   When you find your local still, if you left
   click on it a window will appear. Add
   your ingredients to the window and hit
   the “ Combine “ button at the bottom m
   to make you drink.If you succeed then
   you will see the message “You have
   combined the ingredients to create
   something new!”If you fail you will lose
   your ingredients (unless they are
   reusable). And with a little luck you
   should be getting tipsy in no time.</u><font color=blue>

   For your very first brew, we recommend
   that you make short beer. A relatively
   simple beer it should be sufficient to
   raise your skill to about 30. The recipe
   for this drink can be found in The
   Brewers Recipe Book: under “Short Beer”
                                                                             
   We hope that this document on the art of becoming and avid Ever Quest brew meister
   will be enough for you to get a firm foot old in the brewing industry.Once you have
   mastered the basic's it is important to be creative when brewing. <p>
