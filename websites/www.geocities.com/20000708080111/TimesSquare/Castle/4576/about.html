<font size=5><u>ELVES</u></font>

<font size=4>
We do not deing to acknowledge the slanderous propaganda spread by the stunted hamuns who call themselves dwarves.  The little miners have always had a rather, shall we say, biased outlook on history and the true workings of reality.  They call themselves the finest creatures to grace the worlds-with bodies like that, we suppose one owuld have to have an active fantasy life.<br><br>For those graced with true vision, Elves comprise the finest race in all the worlds.  We are that which other races aspire to be: Our longevity, our beauty, and our craftsmanship are all the stuff of legends.  Certainly, each of these attributes can be recreated in some fashion be the lesser races, but theirs is an artifice of face and form and creation-never as fine as those that come naturally to us.<br><br>Our lives are long and filled with happiness, for we recognize the impermanence of all things, excepting ourselves.  Indeed, we do not suffer death as do the mortals.  Only through violence, accident, or disease do we die at all.  Although we vanish from the ken of mortal knowledge after hundreds of years of existence in this plane, you may rest assured that we continue on elsewhere.  Even those who perish on the battlefield truly never die, but instead become part of the earth's cycle of growth and rebirth.  Our spirits linger on, for we are intimately tied to the world and its core.  Indeed, we are the integral part of that core.<br><br>We would turn now to other matters, for to continue on in this vein would, no doubt, lead you to believe that we are boasting of elven prowess.  We do not boast.  Anyone who has even seen the slightest fraction of elven ability knows the truth.<br><br>
Yes, we are a proud race, but do we not have just cause?  Are we not Elves-creatures of the most wondrous might?  Simply understand that we are what we are and that nothing you can do will change us-then may we become friends.  But beware: We are a complex race, and the wrokings of our lives will ever be a mystery to you, our dreams foreign from yours.  You will never truly understand us, no matter how you try.
