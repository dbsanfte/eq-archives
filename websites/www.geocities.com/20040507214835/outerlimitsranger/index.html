                are one of the most fun classes to play in EverQuest. Or so I've 
                been told; I started my first character as a Ranger, and I've 
                never felt bored enough with being a Ranger to play any other

                this guide in a roughly chronological order, starting with the 
                things you need to know right off the bat, and introducing topics 
                as they become relevant. This guide is intended to teach you a 
                little bit about everything, especially for those people who are 
                new to the world of Norrath. If you're an experienced Ranger, 
                most of these things will be pretty obvious. If you've played 
                another class, most of these things will be pretty obvious. But 
                if you're entirely new to the game, hopefully this will help.

                are a hybrid class, a mix of the Warrior and Druid classes. Make

                second. Most of your spellcasting will be done before and after 
                combat, with only a few spells being cast during the fighting.

                <font color="#CC6600" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>You 
                can choose from three races if you want to be a Ranger: Humans, 
                Half-Elves, and Wood Elves. Before I begin, I want to stress that 
                any of these three races can make an excellent Ranger. Pick whichever 
                race you want to play, especially if you have a role-playing concept 
                in mind for your character. Don't pick your race based on which 
                you think will give you a statistical advantage. Pick the one 
                you'll have fun with. <br>
                <font color="#66FF00" size="4"><em>Statistics </em></font><br>
                Which race you pick will determine your starting statistics, but 
                you get 20 extra points to distribute as you see fit. So we better 
                talk about stats first. The primary stats for Rangers are Strength, 
                Agility, and Dexterity. Don't believe whatever the character generation 
                screen tells you, listen to me. Strength determines your carrying 
                capacity. Since the armor you wear is counted against your carrying 
                capacity, you'll need high Strength if you plan on wearing armor 
                and still being able to carry some loot back to town after your 
                exploits abroad. Strength also has a very small affect on your 
                damage output. As counter-intuitive as this may seem, it's true. 
                Don't expect your damage output to skyrocket if you load up on 
                equipment that enhances your Strength. Agility affects your armor 
                class, or AC. The effect is small. Very small. But it's there. 
                Barely. Agility is nice, but it's not all that important. I only 
                included it because everyone else in the world will tell you how 
                important it is. Dexterity affects two important effects for Rangers: 
                how much damage you can do with your bow (You get a bow!), and 
                how often your weapons will &quot;proc.&quot; Some weapons have 
                spells imbued in them that have a small chance of going off, or 
                &quot;proc'ing&quot;, every time you hit with them. High Dexterity 
                makes this more likely to happen. Proc is generally known as shorthand 
                for &quot;process&quot;, but some people think it's an abbreviation 
                for something else. No one really knows or cares, just say proc 
                and everyone will know what you mean. The other stats can be important, 
                but not as important as these three. Stamina has an affect on 
                your number of hitpoints. The affect is small, almost negligible 
                at high levels. Wisdom determines the amount of mana that you 
                will have. Sounds pretty important, why didn't I list it as a 
                primary stat? A few reasons. First, we don't cast very often in 
                combat. We mostly cast between fights, to heal and prepare for 
                the next fight. How much mana you have isn't all that important 
                when your routine is meditate, cast, repeat. Save enough mana 
                to cast a few times in combat, and you'll be fine. Secondly, since 
                we're hybrids, we see less return for our extra Wis, as compared 
                to our Druid brethren. Intelligence will affect how quickly you 
                can learn a trade skill, which probably means Fletching if you're 
                a Ranger. Not important enough to spend any of your precious points 
                on. Charisma affects how much vendors will pay you for things 
                you sell them, and how much they charge you for their items. Also 
                not important enough to spend points on. <br>
                <font color="#66FF00" size="4"><em>Human </em></font><br>
                A Human Ranger has base statistics of Strength: 80, Stamina: 85, 
                Agility: 85, Dexterity: 75, Wisdom: 80, Intelligence: 75, and 
                Charisma: 75. As you can see, Humans are pretty well balanced. 
                You might want to bump the Str up to 90 and then put the other 
                points in Agi or Dex, or you could go all out on Str and get it 
                to 100. Humans have the bothersome disadvantage of not having 
                enhanced vision, which means you're not going to be able to see 
                in the dark like Half-Elves and Wood Elves can. Take heart though, 
                we do get the spell Eyes of the Cat at level 30, which grants 
                Infravision. Humans also have the advantage over the other races 
                in that they level more quickly (or should I say less slowly). 
                The other races pay an experience penalty for their advantages. 
                Humans Rangers are definitely the most rare of the three choices 
                available, but there's no good reason why. <br>
                <font color="#66FF00" size="4"><em>Half-Elf </em></font><br>
                A Half-Elf Ranger has base Strength: 75, Stamina: 80, Agility: 
                100, Dexterity: 85, Wisdom: 65, Intelligence: 75, and Charisma: 
                75. The most striking thing about Half-Elf Rangers is their low 
                Wis score. Now, I know I told you that Wis wasn't a primary stat 
                for Rangers. And I was telling the truth. But there's something 
                I didn't tell you: your spells have a greater chance of fizzling 
                if your Wis is low. Especially if it's below 75, which is the 
                benchmark. Fizzles mean wasted mana, so you don't want that to 
                happen too often. So for a Half-Elf Ranger, I would recommend 
                getting the Wis up to 75, and the Str up to 85. <br>
                <font color="#66FF00" size="4"><em>Wood-Elf</em></font> <br>
                A Wood-Elf Ranger has base Strength: 70, Stamina: 75, Agility: 
                105, Dexterity: 80, Wisdom: 80, Intelligence: 75, Charisma: 75. 
                You guessed it, beef up on Str. A little extra Sta might be tempting, 
                but get your Str to at least 85. Wood Elves are the most popular 
                race choice for Rangers. Again, there's no good reason why, considering 
                that all the skills that Wood Elves get as racial abilities, Rangers 
                get sooner or later. So you're paying that experience penalty 
                just becase you're impatient. Wood Elves do have a slight advantage 
                though, in that they can wear both small and medium sized armor. 
                Humans and Half-Elves must wear medium. <br>
                Don't forget to pick a name while you're at it. <br>
                <font color="#66FF00" size="4"><em>Deity Selection</em> </font><br>
                Depending on your race, you can worship Tunare, the Mother or 
                All, or Karana, the Rainkeeper. From a gameplay standpoint, it 
                doesn't make much difference. Pick whichever one you would rather 
                roleplay. Just keep in mind that no matter which one you choose, 
                evil NPC's aren't going to like you very much, so be careful. 
                Also, players in EQ generally don't like it when it rains. It 
                limits visibility. So if you roleplay, be prepared to take some 
                flak from your fellow players if you really, really like it when 
                it rains. It's all in good fun though. <br>
                <font color="#66FF00" size="4"><em>Starting City</em></font> <br>
                Now you get to pick your home town. Humans start in Surefall Glade, 
                just outside Qeynos. Wood Elves start in Kelhetin, in the forest 
                of Greater Faydark. Half-Elves can start in either town. For the 
                inexperienced player, I would recommnd starting in the Surefall 
                Glade / Qeynos area, if you can. Kelethin is EQ's bustling metropolis. 
                Greater Faydark is always crammed with people, and your text window 
                will never stop scrolling as people try to buy and sell things 
                and generally have idiotic conversations. In contrast, you can 
                at least get a little peace and quiet in Qeynos Hills, while still 
                having other players in the zone who can answer any question you 
                might have if you need help. Also, I don't know if things are 
                any better in Qeynos Hills, but the guards in Greater Faydark 
                are morons. It takes them far too long to figure out that they 
                should probably do something about that orc pawn who's beating 
                you to death. On top of all that, Kelethin is a tree city. It's 
                a bunch of platforms built onto tree trunks. You ride big lifts 
                to get up to the city. There are all sorts of ramps and bridges 
                between platforms. So the city's layout is confusing, and you 
                always have to be very, very careful not to fall. Falling hurts. 
                Pretty much every newbie who starts in Kelethin falls to their 
                death at least once. I know I did. The Qeynos area is much more 
                straightforward. <font color="#000066"><a href="#TOP">[TOP]</a></font><br>

                Okay, so you're finally ready to get started. Open up your inventory, 
                equip your newbie sword, find your guild leader, turn in your 
                guild note, and get your starting tunic. You also have five training 
                points to spend in your guild. You should probably spend them 
                on 1 Hand Slashing, so you'll have a leg-up in early battles. 
                You get five points to spend every level. You should save these 
                points so that when you get a new skill, you can dump those saved 
                up training points into it, so that it doesn't start out pitifully 
                low. You'll also have some food and water. These will automatically 
                be eaten. You also have a Tome of Discord. If you wanted to become 
                pvp, you would give this to the Priest of Discord (PoD). You don't 
                want to do that. Destroy that book immediately. You'll also need 
                to set up some hotkeys. You have six banks of hotkeys in the lower 
                righthand corner. Setting up these hotkeys is extremely important. 
                I could probably write a whole seperate guide on hotkeys. But 
                for now, just do your best with it. Hotkeys are easy to learn, 
                tough to master.<br>
                There is one thing that you must do as soon as possible. Go to 
                the options menu and reconfigure your keyboard. I don't care what 
                else you change, but you must change the auto-attack key. By default, 
                it is set to &quot;a&quot;. The problem with this is when you 
                try to talk to an NPC, but you accidently forget to hit the &quot;Enter&quot; 
                key first. So instead of saying &quot;What pixie tricksters?&quot;, 
                or whatever you're trying to say, you get as far as typing Wha. 
                When you hit that &quot;a&quot; key, you've turned on auto-attack. 
                And the NPC is going to fight back, and you're going to lose. 
                I learned this lesson when the Kelethin town drunkard beat me 
                into submission, when I was just trying to talk to him. More embarrassingly, 
                this was right after someone had led me to him so I could talk 
                to him. I burned with newbie shame as the person watched the drunkard 
                pummel me. Don't let this happen to you. Remap auto-attack to 
                something you would never type by accident, like &quot;=&quot;. 
                Once you get good with the hotkeys, you'll probably just want 
                to hotkey the &quot;Melee Attack&quot; button, which will do the 
                same thing as hitting the auto-attack button. But for now, just 
                remapping it to &quot;=&quot; should do fine. <br>
                <font color="#66FF00" size="4"><em>Levels 1-5: Hard Lessons Made 
                Easy</em> </font> <br>
                This is where you earn your degree in rat slaying. Kill rats. 
                Kill decaying skeletons. Kill gnoll pups. Kill orc pawns. Kill 
                wasp drones. Just be sure that you /con everything. This is done 
                by targeting the creature you want to kill and hitting &quot;c.&quot; 
                You will get a message showing the monster's relative power. You 
                can probably kill anything that cons even or blue. Killing green 
                creature gives you little to no experience, don't bother. Killing 
                yellow and red mobs is difficult, be sure you know where the guards 
                are if you attempt this. Killing things is easy, just target it, 
                and then walk up and hit the auto-attack button. (You remembered 
                to change the auto-attack button, right?!) Combat ensues, and 
                hopefully you kill the creature. Then loot the body by right-clicking 
                on the corpse. Be careful of hunting monsters that will help each 
                other out. Some monsters will attack you if they see you attacking 
                their friends. Some monsters don't care. Some will just plain 
                attack you. Know which ones are which. After a fight, go back 
                to the guard area and sit down to recover your hitpoints. Then 
                go do it again. <br>
                If you die, and you probably will, you will respawn at your bind 
                point. Bind Affinity is a spell that pure casters get, which binds 
                a person to wherever they are standing. If you go traveling, be 
                sure to get a bind in the nearest cities. We non-pure-casters 
                can only be bound in cities. If you die while you are levels 1-4, 
                you will have a brand new newbie sword and more food and water 
                just waiting for you in your inventory. You body remains where 
                you died, go find it and recover any armor or coins you might 
                have had. If you die at level 5 or later, you respawn with nothing. 
                Recovering your corpse is essential. Also, if you die while you 
                are levels 1-5, your body will only stick around for haf an hour. 
                Then it goes poof, and you lose everything that was on it. This 
                is a Bad Thing (tm). Don't let this happen. Don't wander too far 
                from your bind point until you are level 6. After that, your body 
                will last 24 hours if you are in-game, or one week if you log 
                out in frustration. <br>
                A note on corpse recovery: there is a very important command in 
                EQ called /corpse. Typing /corpse in the chat window will cause 
                your corpse to come to you, if you are with 50 feet of your corpse. 
                /corpse is something you want to hotkey, so you don't have to 
                keep typing it. Quite often, it's a bad idea to try to loot your 
                corpse where you died. You probably died there for a reason. So 
                instead, use the /corpse command repeatedly while running to &quot;drag&quot; 
                your corpse somewhere safe, and then loot it there. <br>
                Acquiring armor is important. This requires money. Allow me to 
                share with you the most important money-making scheme for newbies: 
                bone chips. When you kill skeletons, they drop bone chips. Collect 
                bone chips. Lots of them. Do not sell them to vendors. Other players 
                will pay anywhere from 1 to 5 platinum pieces for every 20 bonechips. 
                Necromancers need bonechips to summon their pets. Everyone else 
                needs bone chips, usually to do quests raise their faction standing 
                with certain NPC's. No one wants to run around killing skeletons 
                all day, so they just buy the bone chips from newbies like you. 
                If you're a roleplayer, you probably won't want to sell bone chips 
                to Necromancers. I don't blame you. In fact, I encourage you. 
                Lots of non-Necros will be around to buy the bone chips though, 
                so don't miss out on this exciting business opportunity. Don't 
                try to haggle though. If there's someone offering 2 plat for twenty 
                bonechips, don't try to extort them to pay 4. Just take the 2 
                plat and smile. <br>
                Now that you've got a little money, I would recommend that you 
                find the nearest NPC who sells leather armor and buy some. Just 
                make sure to inspect it to make sure that it's the right size 
                for you before you buy it. Don't buy any armor better than leather 
                before level 6. It's too likely to decay if you lose your corpse. 
                Save your money to buy a new sword, too. Try to find another player 
                selling a Minotaur Axe, or a Fine Steel Longsword, or a Dwarven 
                Axe. These are all great weapons for your early days, and will 
                serve you well. Mino Axes go for 4pp, FS Long Swords for about 
                8pp, and Dwarven Axes for maybe 10pp. Yeah, it sounds like a lot, 
                but it'll be well worth it. You may even get lucky and find someone 
                who will take pity on you, with your patchwork armor and newbie 
                sword, and just give you one of those fine weapons. Thank these 
                people profusely, but don't expect this to happen. <br>
                This leads us to an important aspect of newbiehood. You're going 
                to see a lot of people running around with very cool looking armor 
                and weapons. You're going to be curious. Feel free to ask someone 
                about those cool claws or neat staff they've got, but be polite. 
                Be polite, and for the love of god, be grammatically correct. 
                If you come off like a moron, the person will just ignore you. 
                If you are polite and unobtrusive, the person will probably be 
                nice and talk to you and give you advice. Listen carefully to 
                any advice they have to give you, they've got all that cool stuff 
                for a reason. You may also be very tempted to ask if the person 
                has any weapons or armor they don't need, and if they would give 
                them to you. Do not do this. EverQuest is already overrun with 
                beggars. Beggars are horrible people. No one likes them. Do not 
                become a beggar. If you read this entire guide and only remember 
                one thing, don't be a beggar. <br>
                On a related note, you may find yourself fighting alongside someone 
                who is the same level as you, but has MUCH better equipment. That 
                person is called a &quot;twink&quot;. Twinks are characters played 
                by a a player who already has another, high level character. They 
                use that character to collect good equipment, and give it to their 
                twink to help them level faster. You may resent twinks, but whatever 
                you do, don't fall into despair and resort to becoming a beggar 
                so that you can become like them. If you are grouped with a twink, 
                just stand behind them and let them take all the hits. They're 
                better equipped to do so, obviously. So just use it to your own 
                advantage. Be aware, however, that equipment isn't everything, 
                especially at low levels. Just because they've got full platemail 
                and an Uber-Sword of Smiting, doesn't mean that they can't get 
                taken down in short order by four or five orcs. <br>
                There are a few other things you should be doing during these 
                levels. One of them is building your skills, like Sense Heading 
                and Taunt. Sense Heading tells you what direction you are facing. 
                At low skill levels, this skill almost never works. Just keep 
                hitting the Sense Heading button though, and eventually it will 
                get better. It's a pain to build up this skill, but it's really 
                quite important that you know which way you're going later. <br>
                Taunt is a skill that mystifies many newbies, so allow me to explain. 
                When you taunt a monster, it makes the monster want to attack 
                you more. This skill is crucial at higher levels, when you will 
                be fighting in groups. It is a Bad Thing if the monster is beating 
                the crap out of the group's Wizard or Cleric. You're a fighter, 
                it's your job to get hit. So it will be your job to Taunt the 
                monster off of the non-fighters, so that it will attack you while 
                the casters do their casting. You shouldn't really be fighting 
                in groups before level 6 or so, you'll do just fine on your own. 
                But when you start grouping later, you'll need to have your Taunt 
                skill up to snuff. So even when you're not grouped, just keep 
                hitting Taunt so that your skill will go up. <br>
                Tracking is also another skill you'll want to practice, and practice 
                a lot. Using Tracking, you can locate and kill specific monsters. 
                Once you pick a specific monster to track down, you will be given 
                constant information on which level the monster is, relative to 
                you. As your skill improves, your tracking radius increases. If 
                you are not moving while tracking, the monsters that spawned most 
                recently will be at the top of the list. The problem with tracking 
                is that at high levels, it gives you too much information. I can 
                walk into the Oasis of Marr and hit Track, and I end up looking 
                at a long list of snakes while a sand giant sneaks up behind me. 
                Additionally, if you are grouped, your group members will always 
                be at the top of the list. But if you try to track your group 
                members, you will end up going in the completely wrong direction. 
                This is a bug. Verant has said that they are looking into ways 
                to enhance Tracking for Rangers, we'll see what develops. <br>
                Archery is a good skill to have a lower levels. Buy a rough hickory 
                bow from another player who knows how to fletch, or you can try 
                to make one yourself. Fletching is a good skill to learn, so that 
                you can make your own arrows. Player-made bows and arrows are 
                superior to the ones you can buy off of vendors. If you want to 
                get really good at fletching, there are a number of fletching 
                guides to be found. Read one, and grow wise. Once you've got your 
                bow, put it to good use. It's a great way to soften up your enemy, 
                by shooting an arrow at them while they're a distace away. Then 
                they come running right at you, and you kill them the old fashioned 
                way. <br>
                At level 3 you get the Forage skill. Go back to the guild hall 
                and train in it. Make a hotkey for it, and then hit it every time 
                it pops up. Foraging lets you pull food and water out of thin 
                air. At lower levels you probably won't be good enough to keep 
                up with your food and water needs with the forage skill alone. 
                That's fine, just buy it from vendors when you have to. But keep 
                practicing, and once you get good, you'll never have to waste 
                money on food and water again. In fact, I usually have more of 
                it then I know what to do with, and just offer it to the people 
                I group with. But that won't happen until much later. <br>
                At level 5 you get Kick. Go back to the guild hall and train in 
                it. (See a pattern here?) Kick lets you get in an extra attack. 
                You have to make a hotkey for it though, and hit it manually every 
                time it pops up during combat. Kick is good. Get it as soon as 
                you hit 5. <br>
                That's about everything you need to know to survive as a newbie. 
                But what about life beyond? <br>
                <em><font color="#66FF00" size="4">Levels 6-12: Expanding Horizons 
                </font></em><br>
                Once you hit 6, you start to get some freedom. Namely, freedom 
                from the fear of losing your body if you die. You'll probably 
                want to start grouping more regularly once you get to this point, 
                but you certaintly don't have to. Get out and about, explore a 
                little. Make friends. <br>
                Also, try to buy some banded armor. Players who are skilled in 
                Blacksmithing can make banded armor, which is better than leather 
                or chainmail. Banded pieces usually sells for about 1pp per point 
                of AC, if I remember correctly. <br>
                At level 8 you get Dodge. Just train one point in dodge. Dodge 
                works automatically in combat. Every time a monster tries to hit 
                you, there is a chance you will dodge. The skill will go up quickly 
                on its own, after you train in it. Besides, you want to save your 
                guild training points, because... <br>
                At level 9, you get to start casting spells. Go to your guild 
                hall and buy your spells. Scribe them into your spellbook by selecting 
                the spell scroll and clicking on an open spell space in the book. 
                Then memorize them by clicking on the spell in the spellbook and 
                clicking on one of the 8 spell slots in the upper lefthand of 
                your screen. Put some traing points into the 6 spell skills: Alteration, 
                Abjuration, Evocation, Divination, Conjuration, and Channeling. 
                Be sure that every skill gets at least one point. Channeling is 
                the skill that determines whether or not you can recover from 
                an interrupted spell casting, and the other five skills are used 
                by the different spells. Now you have spells, but the problem 
                is that all these spell casting skills are way behind. The only 
                way to raise these skills is to cast the corresponding spells, 
                though Channeling can be raised by casting any of the spells. 
                Just keep casting these spells. As a rule, you should never have 
                full mana (the blue bar in the upper right hand). Keep practicing, 
                you're going to need those skills. Some of the more important 
                spells you get at level 9: <br>
                Flame Lick does a small amount of Damage over Time (DoT), and 
                it lowers the target's AC by a bit. It's good, but it's not awesome. 
                Use it at the beginning of a fight. Minor Heal restores 10 hitpoints. 
                You'll be casting this one a lot in-between fights. It's great 
                for reducing downtime. <br>
                Skin Like Wood adds a small amount to your maximum hitpoints and 
                AC. You should always have this on, and if you're grouped, cast 
                it on the other people in the group. <br>
                Snare. There are just too many good things to say about Snare. 
                When you cast Snare on a target, it reduces the target's running 
                speed by about half. The implications are astounding. Is that 
                monster a little too strong for you to kill? Snare it and then 
                run backwards shooting arrows at it, then finish it off with melee 
                when it's weakened. Is a monster badly wounded and trying to run 
                away? Snare it, and they're immobilized while you finish the job. 
                Are you getting beaten up and you need to run to the guards? Snare 
                the monster before you try to run. It won't be able to keep up, 
                you'll get away scott-free. Or you can just put some distance 
                between you and the mob, heal yourself, and try again. Snare is 
                also a powerful taunt, so if the monster is beating up someone 
                else in your group pretty badly, cast Snare on them right before 
                you taunt them. It's almost guaranteed to get their attention. 
                Snare lasts a good long while, too. Snare is awesome. Snare is 
                your friend. <br>
                Remember, now and for the course of your career as a Ranger, every 
                spell you've got, a Druid has had longer. The Druid probably has 
                an even better version of the spell. If you're grouped with a 
                Druid, always talk to them to determine which spells each of you 
                is casting, so that you don't waste mana. <br>
                Be aware that you can hotkey those 8 spell slots. Do so. It's 
                much better then manually clicking on the spell slots with the 
                mouse. Your spellbook must be open to hotkey spells, to save you 
                some confusion. <br>
                At level 10 you get Sneak. Sneak is only rarely useful, but it 
                doesn't hurt. When you activate it, your movement speed if reduced. 
                If you sneak successfully, you can get much closer to monsters 
                before they notice you. It's not a bad idea to keep this skill 
                maxed, but you won't use it very often. <br>
                At level 12 you get Meditate. To meditate, you open up your spellbook 
                and hit the meditate button, and you recover your mana much more 
                quickly. The downside is they you don't really know what's going 
                on around you, so find a safe place to meditate. If you still 
                haven't worked those casting spells up to snuff like I told you 
                to, get it done now.<a href="#TOP"> [TOP]</a><br>
                <em><font color="#66FF00" size="4">Levels 13-20: Coming Into Your 
                Own.</font></em> <br>
                By now, you should be grouping pretty regularly, and probably 
                have a group of friends you fight with often. This is good, this 
                is what EQ is really all about. <br>
                You're going to need to look into getting some magical weapons 
                about this time. Certain monsters, such as ghouls and willowisps, 
                are magical, and can't be hit with normal weapons. The Barbed 
                Leather Whip, Polished Granite Tomahawk, Dargoon Dirk, and Silvery 
                War Axe are all worth looking into at this level range. If you 
                can get some friends to help you, you can try to do the Short 
                Sword of Morin quest as well. You'll also need to get some magic 
                boots in order to kick magical monster successfully; Kobold-hide 
                Boots get my seal of approval. <br>
                You may also be thinking about buying some jewelry from other 
                players. This includes things like necklaces, rings, and bracelets 
                to boost your various stats. Let me tell you though, don't succumb 
                to this temptation. Stats are, for the most part, broken. Well, 
                they're not really broken, it's just that their effect is almost 
                non-existent. Try to find things to wear that boost your AC as 
                much as possible, this is much more important than being able 
                to brag about how high your stats are. The only possible exception 
                would be Dex, which you might want to boost if you're using a 
                weapon that procs. Even then though, don't sacrifice too much 
                of your AC. AC is your most important stat. <br>
                You get some new spells at 15. Most of them are pretty useful, 
                especially: <br>
                Burst of Fire, a Direct Damage (DD) spell, good for 15 points 
                of damage. Camouflage is a lifesaver. It's an invisibility spell, 
                but beware that it only works outdoors, and it doesn't work against 
                the undead. Camouflage can make corpse recovery much easier, and 
                it's great for passing through dangerous areas when you don't 
                want to get caught up in combat. But be careful, this spell's 
                duration is random. It can last ten minutes, it can last ten seconds. 
                You'll get a text message right before it wears off, so stay on 
                your toes. Your invisibility will break if you are attacked, cast 
                another spell, turn on auto-attack, fire your bow, or loot a body. 
                Some monsters can see through invisibility. If you are invisible 
                and you con a monster, and it is still ready to attack you, then 
                you know that it can see you. If it can't, it will con indifferent. 
                You can zone and still be invisible when you come out on the other 
                side, so you may want to do this if you don't know what's waiting 
                for you on the other side. If you go into an underground zone 
                with Camouflage on, you will still be invisible, but you won't 
                be able to recast it when it wears off. Dance of the Fireflies 
                summons a globe of fireflies, a light source. This is a good spell 
                for Human Rangers. Even if you've got Infravision though, I would 
                encourage you to use this spell, because it also has the side 
                effect of making you that much more visible. If you're pulling 
                monsters for your group, they need to be able to see you coming. 
                It's also nice because it's the first spell you get that uses 
                the Conjuration skill. Practice this skill every once in awhile, 
                you'll need to get Conjuration up to snuff when you get another 
                Conjuration spell later. <br>
                Feet Like Cat is an Agility buff. It raises the target's Agi by 
                18 points. Always have it on yourself, and cast it on your groupmates, 
                too. <br>
                Invoke Lightning is an Area of Effect (AoE) spell. All monsters 
                around the target will suffer up to 25 points of damage. The effect 
                radius is small though, and it can only be cast outdoors. Be wary, 
                it's possible to hurt yourself with this spell. <br>
                Thistlecoat is a self-only buff that adds to your AC, and it also 
                makes monsters take one point of damage every time they hit you. 
                Not a whole lot, but it can add up. This is anther spell that 
                you should always have on. <br>
                You also get the Grasping Roots spell at this level. Grasping 
                Roots is not as good as Snare. It will not last as long, and is 
                not as reliable. Do not use Grasping Roots in Snare's place. <br>
                At level 17 you get Dual Wield, probably a skill you've been wanting 
                for some time now. This lets you use another weapon in your offhand, 
                instead of a shield. Obviously, both weapons need to be one-handed. 
                You won't swing the weapon in your off-hand very often until this 
                skill gets up, but be patient. <br>
                Speaking of weapons, this is a good time to bring up one-handers 
                vs. two-handers. At lower levels, you may be tempted to use a 
                two-handed weapon instead of a shield and a one-hander. You may 
                even be tempted to continue doing so after you get Dual Wield. 
                That's fine if you want to, but let me warn you: There are no 
                good two-handed weapons for Rangers at high levels. There are 
                lots of great one-handers, but all of the really good two-handers 
                can't be equipped by Rangers. So use a two-hander if you want 
                to at lower levels, but be sure to have some one-handed weapons 
                that you can use to keep your 1H Slashing and Dual Wield skills 
                maxed out. You're going to need them later. Any Ranger with a 
                two-hander is gonna get funny looks, no matter what level they 
                are. <br>
                At level 18 you get the Parry skill. It works just like Dodge, 
                just put one point into it and it will automatically go off and 
                improve in skill during combat. <br>
                At level 20 you get Double Attack. This is another highly important 
                skill. With Double Attack, there is a chance you will hit twice 
                when you swing your weapon. So, yes, with Dual Wield, there is 
                a chance you will hit the monster four times in one round. Don't 
                expect it to happen very often though, until your skills reach 
                higher levels. <br>
                You also get to pick a last name at level 20. Congratulations, 
                you've earned it. Just type /surname [insert last name here]. 
                Without the brackets, genius. Once it's approved, it'll appear 
                right over your head, right after your first name, kinda like 
                you'd expect. <br>
                <em><font color="#66FF00" size="4">Beyond level 20</font></em> 
                <br>
                Things start to slow down at this point. You've got most of your 
                skills now, though you've still got some more cool spells to look 
                forward to. <br>
                If you're still in banded armor at this point, you're no doubt 
                feeling the pain of not being able to wear plate. Not to worry 
                though, there's a line of Ranger-only quest armor, called Ivy 
                Etched. The quests originate in the Ranger guild in the Kithicor 
                forest. Kithicor is a very dangerous place at night, when all 
                sorts of very high level undead cretures walk the woods. Wait 
                until morning, when these monsters despawn, before attempting 
                to reach the guild. The guild itself is just southeast of Rivervale, 
                the easiest way to find it is to Track the guild leader Morin 
                Shadowbane. I highly recommend that you buy or quest for as much 
                of the Ivy armor as soon as you can. You need that extra AC. It's 
                also worth pointing out that you can come here to train in new 
                skills instead of running all the way to Surefall Glade or Kelethin. 
                I don't believe they sell spells here though. <br>
                <em><font color="#66FF00" size="4">Here's the cream of the crop 
                of the level 22 spells:</font></em> <br>
                Enduring Breath lets you breathe underwater. It takes one fish 
                scale to cast Enduring Breath. You can get fish scales by fishing, 
                or you can buy them from a few vendors. Probably the most convenient 
                vendor who sells these is the Erudite woman in the inns on the 
                west side of the East Commons zone. <br>
                Harmony is a great spell, but it takes a little getting used to. 
                It's an AoE lull spell, outdoors only. Let's say there's a group 
                of bandits that you want to kill, but you can't kill them all 
                at the same time. Cast Harmony on the bandit in the middle of 
                the group. This will Harmonize all the bandits around it. Then 
                you can pull one of the bandits from the group, and the other 
                bandits won't attack. Just be sure to pull the bandit far enough 
                away that you won't be within agro-range when Harmony wears off 
                on the others. Harmony can also be resisted, but you won't know 
                if it was or not until you try to pull. So be ready to deal with 
                it if you try to pull one bandit, and one or two of the others 
                resisted the spell and they come after you. This doesn't happen 
                very often though, Harmony is pretty reliable. <br>
                Ignite is another DD spell, does up to 37 damage. Pretty straightforward. 
                A note on DD spells in general for Rangers: You generally don't 
                want to chain-cast them throughout combat at higher levels. This 
                is because in the time it takes you to cast the spell, you probably 
                could have inflicted more damage just by melee'ing. This is especially 
                true if the monster is attacking you, since your casting will 
                probably get interrupted, and you'll have wasted all that time 
                to inflict 0 damage. In general, just save your mana for between-combat 
                heals. <br>
                Light Healing is your much-needed replacement for Minor Healing. 
                Now you can heal a whopping 30hp at once. If you haven't figured 
                this out yet. Rangers can't really heal very well. That's the 
                job for Clerics and Paladins. Ranger heals are pretty much just 
                for reducing downtime. <br>
                Skin like Rock is an upgrade to Skin like Wood, obviously. Always 
                have it on. <br>
                You get the Hide skill at 25. This is a sort of stationary-invisibility. 
                If you move, it breaks. You also won't know if you've hidden successfully, 
                but the easiest way to find out is con a mob that would normally 
                attack you. If that dry bone skeleton is looking at you indifferently, 
                instead of scowling, ready to attack, you know you've hidden successfully. 
                This skill isn't very useful when you could just cast Camouflage, 
                but it doesn't hurt to have. Both Sneak and Hide have low skill 
                caps for Rangers, so be cautious. I usually hit my hide hotkey 
                before I go afk for any amount of time, just on principle. <br>
                <em><font color="#66FF00" size="4">New spells again at 30. The 
                standouts: </font></em><br>
                Barbcoat is an improved self-only AC buff and damage shield. Always 
                have it on. Cancel Magic will remove your target's magical buffs. 
                This is nice to have against monsters that have their own damage 
                shields, which are hurting you every time you hit them. Also handy 
                in duels, to de-buff the other person. <br>
                Eyes of the Cat is the long-awaited self-only Infravision spell. 
                Human Rangers, rejoice. Invigor will restore your yellow stamina 
                bar. Nice to have in long fights, or if you're visiting the underwater 
                dungeon of Kedge Keep, where you will always be out of stamina 
                because you will always be swimming. Shield of Thistles is a damage 
                shield that you can cast on yourself and others, doing 6 damage 
                to the monster every time it hits the person. It only lasts a 
                minute or two, so you'll need to re-cast it before each fight. 
                <br>
                Stinging Swarm is a wonderful spell. It's a DoT that does about 
                120 damage to the target over one minute. It uses the Conjuration 
                skill, so I hope you used Dance of the Fireflies to keep your 
                skill up like I told you to. Cast this at the beginning of a fight. 
                You'll get a yellow text message if it wears off, cast it again 
                if the monster still has a good amount of hitpoints. Otherwise, 
                save your mana. <br>
                Strength of Earth is a nice Strength buff, adding 15 points. Once 
                again, always have it on, and always cast it on your friends. 
                Unfortunately, this spell doesn't last as long as you might like, 
                so you'll have to refresh it periodically. <br>
                At 35 you get both Riposte and Disarm. Riposte works like Dodge 
                and Parry, just train one point and it will automatically go up. 
                When Riposte goes off, you get a free swing at your enemy. Disarm 
                is something you have to hotkey. Disarm doesn't work very well 
                agaist monsters. It doesn't seem to have much affect on their 
                damage output. Most monsters hit just as hard with their bare 
                hands as they do with a sword. It's great in duels though. Also 
                at 35, you automatically meditate when you sit down. This means 
                you don't have to stare at the spellbook anymore. <br>
                Not much left I can tell you, other than give you a rundown of 
                the nice spells at 39: <br>
                Careless Lightning is a nice DD spell, 99 points of damage. <br>
                Healing is a nice spell, good for 90hp or so. The real advantage 
                is that it's more mana-efficient that your previous two healing 
                spells. <br>
                Levitate causes you to hover a few feet off the ground. It takes 
                one batwing to cast this spell. The same Erudite woman who sold 
                you those fish scales can sell you these, too. Levitate is great 
                for running over lava or shark-infested waters. <br>
                Skin like Steel. Always have it on you and on your friends. You 
                should know that at this point. <br>
                Spirit of Wolf is a spell you've probably wanted for a long time. 
                It lets you run faster. Much faster. Only works outdoors though. 
                <br>
                That pretty much brings you up to level 40. I've tried to cover 
                as much information as I think pertains to Rangers in particular. 
                I would highly encourage you to read the Warrior and Druid guides 
                as well, just to give you a more complete understanding. If you 
                have any suggestions for improvements that I can make to my site 
                please feel free to leave comments my guestbook is a good chioce 
                for that .</strong> </font></div>
