Warriors are the masters of armcombat in all it's many forms. They are at home on the battlefield, and are trained to take punishment as much as dole it out, so their hit poins are the highest of any class. "where ever there is conflict, there you will find warriors-individuals who thirst to fell the stell of
their weapons bite into the flesh of their enemies, to fell the rush of triumph as they overcome an enemy by mastery of arms alone. there are few that can match the raw combat effectiveness of a dedicated warrior.  Skill at arms is universal-even those races that generally disdain combat are permitted to follow the calling of the warrior. With the notable exceptions of the Hegh
Men (Erudites)and High elves, who falsely believe that true power lies in the words of the mage or the chants of the wizard. Choice of race is entirely personal. Every race has its advantages and
disadvantages. If you wish for raw power, select troll or orge. If you wish to be accepted as well, choose a barbarian. If you wish infravision, the list continues. <p>
