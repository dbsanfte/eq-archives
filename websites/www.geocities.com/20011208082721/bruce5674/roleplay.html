<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3"><strong>Dwarves
can be a fairly easy character to roleplay, depending upon your
tastes. One must remember to fit one's character to his or her
class. For example, you aren't going to see a paladin running
around murdering people, looting, and sacrificing babies. Here's
a few general personas and guidelines that I've found to be good
for an interesting roleplaying experience:</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="5"
face="Staccato222 BT">General Guidelines:</font><font
color="#000000" size="3"><strong> Dwarves tend to be stubborn
people, rooted much more in reality than most other races. They
can seem to be biased against other races or classes, magic users
in particular. They often find other races to be a bit vexing to
deal with (Elves because of their tendency to dawdle and think
too much, Humans because they make rash decisions and change
their minds too often, and Halflings because of their propensity
toward practical jokes and stealing, etc.). Dwarves who have
traveled much, however, are often far less extreme in their
biases, having seen and heard much more than their kinsmen.
Dwarves of all types are comfortable in the presence of Gnomes,
who share their affinity for the earth. They are still somewhat
afraid of the magic-users though. Dwarves (with the notable
exception of Rogues) tend to hate practical jokes or horseplay,
instead preferring an orderly society. Dwarves also tend to be
afraid of the sea or other large bodies of water, and suffer from
seasickness much more than other races. Perhaps this is because
they consider the sea to be the ultimate symbol of chaotic change</strong></font></p>

face="Staccato222 BT">Paladin</font><font color="#000000"
size="3"><strong>: You're the knight-in-shining-armor type. Never
hesitating to help other good players, you're always the first
one into combat against evil creatures and the last one out. You
are absolutely fearless in the face of danger. You are also a
healer; use your power to help the sick and injured. You will
also gladly sacrifice yourself if it means your friends will
escape. Your sense of honor and fair play is unmatched, and you
never run from a battle, no matter the odds. When dueling, you
refuse all help, determined to stand or fall on your own. You
also do not like magic-users at all, considering their arcane
powers to be unholy. You also tend to be suspicious of rangers
and druids, although their nature-based powers are more
palatable. Many other races and classes see you as intolerant,
which is quite true.</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3"><em><strong>Alternate
persona:</strong></em><strong> You are a sad and dour individual,
who's faith is wavering in the face of unending struggles against
evil. You are becoming more and more convinced that you are
fighting a losing battle. You struggle onward more out of a sense
of inertia than out of faith. Your loyalty to your friends is
still strong however, and you will fight to save them. Perhaps
you will lose your faith, or maybe your adventures will lead to a
reaffirmation.</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3"><em><strong>Alternate
persona:</strong></em><strong> You are the reluctant (but devout)
warrior, joining the ranks of the Paladins more to help others
and save souls than to do battle or vanquish evil. Some consider
you a coward, but others see you as you truly are. You're more
interested in converting followers of other religons than
fighting, and are more comfortable in the company of Clerics than
your fellow Paladins. You will try to avoid combat, instead
preferring negotiation, but when forced to fight, you do so with
terrifying (and suprising) skill and viciousness.</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3"><em><strong>Alternate
Persona:</strong></em><strong> You are a Crusader, traveling afar
to protect the weak and innocent, and to destroy the evil and
vile races that threaten all creation. You enjoy the company of
others, and are more tolerant than other Dwarves (due to long
years on the road), but where evil is concerned you are ruthless.
Since you are far from your church and often fighting evil, you
tend to collect more wealth than is usual for a Dwarven Paladin,
but you spend sparingly, giving most of your assets to the
Clerics of Underfoot whenever you are home.</strong></font></p>

<hr>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="5"
face="Staccato222 BT">Warrior</font><font color="#000000"
size="3"><strong>: Your bloodlust for the enemies of the Dwarves
is unending. You feel no remorse for killing an orc or ogre, even
children. You are, in short, a killing machine and sociopath,
completly detached from your actions and how they affect others.
Many people, especially Paladins and Clerics, see you as being as
bad as the enemies you fight. Magic-users distrust you, and the
feeling is more than mutual. Your only loyalty is to your race
and home, your only joy is butchering your enemies.</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3"><em><strong>Alternate
Persona:</strong></em><strong> You are a mercenary, a sell-sword
of the highest order. You will fight for anyone if the pay is
good and the job agreeable. You try to keep your interests and
the interests of your employer seperate, but it is difficult
sometimes. You won't work against other Dwarves unless there is a
VERY good reason, as you do have a sense of honor. You have also
learned quite a bit of blacksmithing, as you have often not had
the money to pay for repair of your weapons.</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3"><em><strong>Alternate
Persona:</strong></em><strong> You are a young, hot-blooded
member of the Stormguard, who sees being a warrior as his path to
fame and prominence. You never back down from a challenge, even
what you're grossly outmatched, due to your impossibly large ego.
You tend to get in almost as many fights with your allies as you
do with your enemies. You think you're the deadliest warrior and
most skilled swordsman the world has ever seen, and are a poor
loser when proven wrong. Plunging headlong into a fight, without
any thought or consideration of tactics, is your hallmark
manuver. </strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3"><em><strong>Alternate
Persona:</strong></em><strong> You are the grizzled veteran of
many battles. The life of an adventurer has not been easy, but it
has been rewarding, gifting you with a wealth of knowledge and
expirience. You are not quick to take offense, but will gladly
fight if the reason is good enough. You do not look for trouble
or try to prove yourself a deadly warrior. You have an air of
quiet, reliable confidence and skill about you, supported by
years of experience. In battle, you use your wits and
intelligence, considering them as much of a weapon as your blade.
You go for magic users first in any battle. You try to steer your
younger compatriots out of trouble, but believe that experience
is the best teacher, and will not force them to do anything,
unless is has dire consequences. While you still fear magic
users, you also respect them, due to a lifetime of seeing their
power.</strong></font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="5" face="Staccato222 BT">Rogue:</font><font
size="5"><strong> </strong></font><font size="3"><strong>You're
the merry Rogue. You are a seasoned traveler, and prefer to make
your living by your wits rather than by your labor. You're
charming, witty, and clever. You won't steal from those who are
poor or in more sorry shape than you, but the wealthy had better
keep a watch on their purse strings. You have no problem with
taking young, inexperienced adventurers under your wing, but many
others look upon this with trepidation. You are also much more at
ease with other races and classes. You are more fascinated by
magic than afraid of it, and so find magic users to be agreeable
company. The inverse is not true, however, as you tend to want a
&quot;closer look&quot; at spellbooks and valuable magical
components. You also do not suffer from seasickness as much as
most other dwarves, finding your fellows discomfiture to be
somewhat amusing. You're also a skilled gambler, and enjoy games
of chance, especially when you can swing the odds in your favor.</strong></font></p>

<p><em><strong>Alternate Persona: </strong></em><strong>You are
an assassin: cold, efficient, and deadly. You feel no compunction
about stabbing your target in the back with a poisoned weapon.
You are a lurker in the shadows, a predator of the night. You
hire yourself out to the highest bidder, the only thing of
importance to you being to get the job done, regardless of it's
nature. You have no remorse, conscience, or ethics to speak of.</strong></p>

<p><em><strong>Alternate Persona:</strong></em><strong> You are
an outcast from Dwarven society. You were once a member of the
Miner's Guild 628, but you couldn't resist the temptation to prey
on your fellow Dwarves. Any other members of 628 are sworn to
kill you on sight, so you tend not to go near Kaladim or the
Butcherblocks. You instead roam the world, making a meager
existence by preying on others. Anyone, regardless of who they
are, is a target.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="5" face="Staccato222 BT">Cleric:</font><font
size="3"><strong> You are a devoted follower of Brell Serilis,
Lord of Underfoot. Every action you take is devoted to furthering
His glory. You often try to convert followers of other religons,
often to their annoyance. Other churches sometimes fear you for
your fervor, and may take action against you. You are sworn to
heal the injured and the sick, regardless of their religon. The
only people who you will not aid are evil races, shadowknights,
and necromancers. You wage unending war against the followers of
Veeshan, Bertoxxulous, Cazic-Thule, and Innoruuk. You sometimes
find companionship with followers of Rodcet Nife, as your oaths
and beliefs are very similar. In battle tending to your injured
comrades is your primary concern, and you view slaughter of the
wounded or innocents to be crimes of the highest order.</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em><strong>Alternate Persona:</strong></em><strong>
You feel nothing but disgust for your fellow Clerics. You joined
the church as a path to wealth and power. You are more devoted to
enriching yourself than to helping others. While you hide your
true motives well, others are beginning to suspect that something
is amiss, and will take action against you should they find out
your true aims. You have contacts among the dark races and
classes, and will not heistate to use them to remove obstacles
from your path. You are vindictive towards those who thwart you,
and find cruel vengenace to be particularly satisfying.</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em><strong>Alternate Persona:</strong></em><strong>
You are a missionary, traveling afar to spread the good word of
Brell. You do not hate or distrust followers of other Deitys, but
instead pity them, for you know it is only through devoting
yourself to Brell that one can find true salvation. You travel
often, with other adventurers as a defensive retinue, as you
truly abhor violence. You will only willingly fight those you
regard as evil and unsavable, or who wish to harm the innocent.
You offer healing, food, and water to any who need them, and live
off the generosity of others. Most of the treasure and wealth you
collect is thithed to the Clerics of Underfoot.</strong></font></p>
