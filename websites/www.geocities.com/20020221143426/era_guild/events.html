<h4>MISTMOORE RAID</h4>
<dd>ERA held a lvls 20+ MistMoore Raid on Sat, Feb 9th 2002 and it went well after the initial problems of getting organized.<br />
<dd>In attendance at one time or another were the following members: Bananeb, Boxwood, Burmaben, Cindale, Daemonus, Fater, Giavonni, Hathnar, Hotplate, Kattey, Krokus, Malakor, Morrith, Namin, Reerdar, Reolian, Rorrie, Selnex, Slayerxx, Tallaani, Tediropha, Vortonia, Wallach, Wisesoul, and Zoruk which is by far the best turn out we've had in any raid so far.  Although there have only been three so hey what can we expect, hehe :-) (If you attended but for some reason I missed you on the list please email us at <a href="mailto:era_guild@yahoo.com">ERA_Guild@yahoo.com</a>.  Thanks)<br />
<dd>Although the loot and exp wasn't the best, many of the officers and hopefully the members of ERA learned alot from this raid.  We hope to hold another one which will be more successful in the terms of loot and/or exp in the near future. <br />
<dd>And btw, thanks to everyone who has posted suggestions and stuff on the message board for us.  It helps alot having all this input from you guys! :-)<br /><br />
