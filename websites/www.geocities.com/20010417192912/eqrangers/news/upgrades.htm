        <p align="left">The following was posted by Abashi:</p>
        <p align="left"><strong>Major SK and Paladin News </strong><br>
        <br>
        Hot of the Gameplay forum, Abashi just announced some big
        news for the Shadow Knight and Paladin classes. Here's
        the post: <br>
        <br>
        Hello all, I said I'd stop in tonight and let you know
        what was decided. As of the next patch, Paladins and SKs
        will receive additional hitpoints, and increased caps on
        bash and taunt. <br>
        The additional hitpoints will be noticeable for Paladins
        and SKs over level 25. This was done because the
        Paladins, SKs, and Rangers had the same HP base, which
        was incorrect. This change will basically put Paladin and
        SK HPs midway between rangers and warriors of the same
        race. <br>
        <br>
        The taunt skill was increased because SKs, and in
        particular, Paladins could not taunt opponents off of
        Rangers, Monks, Rogues, and Warriors due to their lower
        damage output. Though the Paladin and SK will never equal
        the warrior in their ability to taunt, this change in
        addition to some of the taunting spells should help them
        fulfill their role as a tank. <br>
        <br>
        Bash was increased because Paladins typically aren't
        switching to two handed weapons, choosing instead of
        using the bash skill. Most warriors, being ogres, trolls,
        or barbarians for the most part, do not worry about bash
        and instead opt for slam, which uses the same skill.
        Paladins are typically the only characters who use a
        shield throughout their lives. <br>
        <br>
        The problem of an AC disparity between Paladins/SKs and
        rangers still exists due to the ranger class-specific
        armor typically having an AC that is too high. We'll be
        further examining the AC disparity over the coming weeks,
        and will address it with items. <br>
        <br>
        Additionally, the need for Paladin/SK 1H weapons above
        that of the Ghoulbane has been brought to the attention
        of our Live team (the item/quest people). Quite frankly,
        if you are still wielding a GB in the high 40s, you
        aren't doing the damage you should be doing. However it's
        apparent that Paladins (and the smaller SKs) prefer to
        retain their bash.<br>
        <br>
        Also, the Armor of Ro should be more obtainable after the
        next patch. The class-specific mid-level armor in general
        is still being analyzed and will improve over the next
        few patches. <br>
        <br>
        Finally, Fear will drop more items. I was able to obtain
        several pieces for each class upon testing it last night.

        <p align="left">Ok, now that you read the article, here
        are my thoughts on some of what was posted. As far as
        Paladins and SK's getting Health Point boosts, thats
        fine. I don't have a problem with it cause they are Plate
        wearing classes. So in theory, I would think they are
        considered better &quot;tanks&quot; because of that and
        thus, in turn would merit additional HP. The taunt skill
        increase for Pal's and SK's, I think would fall under the
        same theory as I metioned above. So, again, I don't have
        a problem with that. As for their Bash skill increase,
        doesnt really pertain to us. Now the next part of the
        article I found to be interesting and a bit concerning. I
        will talk about that in a minute. As for there being more
        1H Slash weapons for Pal's and SK's, well then I think
        they should add a couple of 2H Slash Ranger Only weapons
        or better yet, add more, better 1H Slashing Ranger only
        weapons. I will also elaborate on this in abit. As for
        Paladins being able to obtain their armor a bit easier,
        not really too important to us either. </p>
        <p align="left">Ok first, the on the subject of the class
        specific armor. He said there is an Armor Class
        dispairity between Pal's/SK's and Rangers that exists due
        to our class specific armor having an AC that is too high
        and that they are going to look into that dispairity and
        will address it with items. Ok, personally I don't think
        that our AC on Ivy Etched Armor is too high. On most
        pieces it is 1 to 2pts lower on AC than the corresponding
        Pal/SK piece. To me, I think that is the way it should
        be. Let me show you what I mean. Steel Plate armor is the
        best non-magic armor that Pal's and SK's can wear. Banded
        is the best is the best non-magic armor that Rangers can
        wear. If you examine the AC's on both of them, you will
        notice that on most pieces that 1 to 2 AC difference
        exists there as well. So to me, it is logical that the
        same difference would exist on Class specific armor since
        supposedly, they would take about the same level to earn.
        I don't know, maybe I am just taking it too personal? But
        in any case, whether I am wrong or right, I just hope
        that in the end, they don't decide to &quot;nerf&quot;
        our armor. I also hope they they don't decide to increase
        the AC's on Pal/SK armor by alot either. Maybe a 1pt AC
        increase on some pieces would be fair, maybe even
        justified, but any increase over 1pt I really think would
        be unfair. After all, we Rangers had to work just as hard
        as those Paladins and Shadow Knights to earn our very
        special armor and deserve to have good armor with good,
        fairly comparable AC</p>
        <p align="left">Now as for about adding more 1H Slashing
        weapons for Paladins and Shadow Knights....I mean come
        on. They already have some of the better 2H weapons in
        the game, which to me makes sense because when you think
        of a Paladin or Shadow Knight, you tend to associate a 2H
        Slashing weapon with those classes. Giving them more
        class specific 1H Slashing weapons (which you know would
        probably have good stats) I feel takes away from the
        Ranger class. When you think of a Ranger, you tend to
        associate 1H Slashing weapons with them because of our
        ability to duel wield. As it is, I don't feel most of our
        Ranger Only weapons are really outstanding. They all pale
        in comparison with the mighty Paladin Only Ghoulbane. As,
        I suggested before, if they are going to add more 1H
        Slashing weapons for Paladins and Shadow Knights, they
        should also add more for Rangers or add Ranger Only 2H
        Slashing weapons. In a way, I kind of see it as them
        being rewarded for electing NOT to use those good 2H
        Slashing weapons that are made available to their
        classes, which I feel is unfair to us Rangers.</p>
        <p align="left">Well in any case, after reading the
        article and my thoughts, please bear in mind that they
        are just that.....MY thoughts. You may or may not agree
        with them, which is fine. Everyone is entitled to their
        own opinions. Well that was my 2 copper on the subject of
        the Paladin and Shadow Knight upgrades. Thanks for taking
        the time to read it!</p>
