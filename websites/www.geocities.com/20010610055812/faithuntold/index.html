    <p><font color="#6666FF">Well... Last night we had a Hate raid... but The 
      Stoic was up there so we decided to move to Fear. Unfortunatley Fear didn't 
      go so well. We appeared to be good, had a nice zone in most of the people 
      safe and invis on the safe ledge with no aggros. But that changed fast and 
      we got swarmed and all died on zone in. Anyway to put a long story short 
      it was a long CR where we had others come and break the zone for us. But 
      guys, fear is REALLY REALLY hard to break. I mean about a month ago Rising 
      Ascension failed on a break, granted they didn't have their whole guild 
      there but they failed none the less. Dont get discouraged by this, we have 
      had and will have in the future Successful fear raids. Every guild has failed 
      raids it's part of the game. It's not a regular occurance so I don't want 
      people to be discouraged, I know many of you lost xp (hell i had 9 corpses 
      that couldn't be rezzed). But lets try to look on the bright side of this 
      and those of you who had not been to fear now know where the ledge is and 
      know what more to expect. Those that DoT know not to DoT the Enchanters 
      mezzed mobs now :). Anyway All in all this happens dont be discouraged. 
      And on a side not Plane of Growth will not be going on tomorrow, but rather 
      a week from tomorrow (Next Saturday the 19th). I'll see you online guys.
