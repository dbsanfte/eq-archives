face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Raid of Dalnir's Crypt 10/7/00</font></h2>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Another
successful raid in Dalnir on 10/7/00 was as much fun killing MOBS
as it was meeting new friends/guild members that we may have
never grouped with before.&nbsp; Most of the characters we
brought were alts, which was even more interesting.&nbsp; The
groups were assigned by level which seemed to work out very well,
although our group killed much faster (had to put that in).&nbsp;
The combination of guild members was very diverse (not just the
usual 12 druids, and a tank), we had
clerics/tanks/enchanters/druid/necro/monk and our favorite Wizard
Ereana (who was always there in case things went bad). </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">I think
we all enjoyed ourselves during this raid, it was well suited for
our levels, and most have never been there before.&nbsp; Everyone
was extremely helpful, Sparkly gave so many clarities that his
mem'ed spell must have been smoking.&nbsp; And as Kudar said, it
was a true event because Dariele's Character died (sorry).&nbsp;
We did have a couple deaths which seems inevitable on these
events, but this is EQ, and I hope all got rez'ed. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Loot
didn't seem all that great, but we were there for the fun and it
was loads of fun.&nbsp; As usual we got started about 2 hours
late and maybe we can work on that a little more.&nbsp; Weekends
are tough trying to make the event on time when real life stuff
comes up, and I was late too.&nbsp; Thanks to all who attended
the event, it was all of us that made it so much fun.&nbsp; I
can't wait to hear when the next event will be scheduled (I heard
a rumor about Mistmoore). </font></p>

great bunch o people we have here.</font></p>
