<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Arial">Just a couple of
notes to keep in mind as an person interested in joining the CDF.
</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">If you have
        not looked over the web page in full I highly suggest
        that you do so before attempting to enlist. This is so
        nothing is a surprise to you once you are in the guild. </font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Understand
        that you well be a soldier and although you may move up
        in the ranks to ask for such a thing is not acceptable.
        You will answer to those that have been placed above you.
        You will be a Private in the army. We use ranks and
        titles because in our experiences with other guilds, the
        more organized we are the more fun people will have. If
        you know your place, you will find it more fun to role
        play. Rank that is earned is more interesting and means
        more to an individual then rank to is just given.</font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">We expect our
        members to look over the web page as much as possible. If
        you can get online to play EQ you can look at the web
        page. Members should at least review the boards to find
        out anything new that is going on.</font></p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">OK so enough of that.
If you are really interested in becoming a member of the
Coalition Defense Force here is what I need you to do. Copy the
template below and fill in your information. Then e-mail that to </font><a
href="mailto:castle2000@mindspring.com"><font size="4"
face="Arial">Commander Doner</font></a><font size="4"
face="Arial"> who will review it and forward it to a regiment
commander. You will be notified in the game and by e-mail of your
assignment.</font></p>
