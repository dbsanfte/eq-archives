<br>(Early on, there was this wierd bug when you first got into boats where it would appear to flip player models on an angle.  No idea why.  They weren't actually flipped, they just appeared that way, but it was hillarious all the same.)<br>
<li><a href="http://www.geocities.com/brcalley82/tesh1/catbox.jpg" TARGET="_blank">The Befallen Catbox</a></li>
<br>(Cat boxes are areas in zones where players can't go.  These are boxes at loc 0,0 with default textures on the walls.  You can't do anything in these rooms, but people sometimes get teleported to these rooms when the game can't figure out where to put a player.  The solution to getting out is either gating or petitioning to get a guide to move you out.  There are catboxes in pretty much every indoor dungeon in Norrath.  The cat is rumoured to belong to one of the game developers.)<br>

<br>(Sometimes in the Plane of Hate, you get teleported to another area of the zone, which is below the floor of hate you usually play on.  There's a whole basement area the size of hate itself (without Innoruuk's attic area) hiding below just without MOBs in it.  It's all a different layout too, but the coolest looking part is this nifty druid circle-like thing.  Apparently there's a teleporter down there to take you back to the main floor of hate, but nobody can find the damn thing and you have to petition to have a guide move you out if you get stuck down there, hehe.  Cool lookin' though.)<br>

<br>(No idea what was going on here.  I found this little guy in the Qeynos Aqueducts early in '99 when the game was first released.  When you clicked on him, no name, and he wouldn't respond to hails.  Very strange stuff.)<br>

<br>Before Noble Dojorn, before a room full of Efreeti's handed out quests, the airplane was a barren zone, with no MOBs in it whatsoever.  It didn't even have teleport pads back then.  This is how airplane looked before the populated it with MOBs and released it in early 2000.)<br>

<br>(This was cool.  Right around Christmas time in '99 it started to snow in Oasis and a few of the other zones.  I couldn't believe it until I zoned in to see it.  Nice prank Verant, I like.)<br>

<br>(A double-headed zone train is what happens when an ogre bouncer is killing people on one side of the zone and crocodiles are killing people on the other side of the zone.  You can't figure out which side is better to be on and you keep zoning back and forth, being pounded on every time you zone through, eventually dying in one of the zones.  This must have been good luck, 'cause I was level 37 when I died here and I didn't die again until level 43! Bloody record that is!)<br>

<font size=+1><ul><li>Back In The Day</li></font> [Submitted by Teshia in April 2000]<ul><font size=-1>
<li><a href="http://www.geocities.com/brcalley82/oldtimes/04-99-1.jpg" TARGET="_blank">Very Early Procyon and Tawl</a> [April 1999]</li>
<br>(At this point, I didn't know Procyon or Tawl.  This is a week or two into the first release of the game I think.)<br>
<li><a href="http://www.geocities.com/brcalley82/oldtimes/04-99-2.jpg" TARGET="_blank">Tiane and Redlark (circa level 5)</a> [April 1999]</li>
<br>(This is Tiane chatting with Redlark, who we became good friends with and formed the now defunct United Norrath guild.)<br>
<li><a href="http://www.geocities.com/brcalley82/oldtimes/04-99-3.jpg" TARGET="_blank">Ciny Fighting Near T2</a> [April 1999]</li>
<br>(I had no idea who Ciny was when I took this shot, was probably just amazed by the size of the spider for the first time.  Very early Ciny though.)<br>
<li><a href="http://www.geocities.com/brcalley82/oldtimes/05-99-1.jpg" TARGET="_blank">Teshia and Perixsus, Old Fishing Buddies (circa level 8)</a> [May 1999]</li>
<br>(Tiane and I used to team up with Perixsus a LOT in the early North Ro spider slaying days.  Around level 20 I think he forgot who the hell we were, hehe.)<br>
<li><a href="http://www.geocities.com/brcalley82/oldtimes/05-99-2.jpg" TARGET="_blank">Teshia and Tiane Fishing In Freeport (circa level 9)</a> [May 1999]</li>
<br>(Tiane is probably Norrath's only fishing sentimentalist.  She continues to fish often at level 50, even though the skill has no real value past level 10 or so.  Yesterday she told me she achieved a skill of 200 in Fishing.  Only took her a year to get it.  That's some mad fishing skillz!)<br>
<li><a href="http://www.geocities.com/brcalley82/oldtimes/05-99-3.jpg" TARGET="_blank">Xarissa, Tiane, and Devaras at Derv Camp 3 (circa level 15)</a> [May 1999]</li>
<br>(Xarissa is a great old friend of mine from back in the derv days.  Easily one of the nicest people I ever did meet.  This is probably the first time I met Devaras as well.)<br>
<li><a href="http://www.geocities.com/brcalley82/oldtimes/05-99-4.jpg" TARGET="_blank">Boat Line Ups Before People Could TP / Gate</a> [May 1999]</li>
<br>(Remember when the boats came every 40 minutes and then used to crash because too many people were entering the zone at once? Then they'd dumb everybody back on the dock (or drown you in the middle of the ocean somewhere) and the line ups would be even LONGER.)<br>
<li><a href="http://www.geocities.com/brcalley82/oldtimes/06-99-1.jpg" TARGET="_blank">Early Casanova Shot, Fighting In High Keep</a> [June 1999]</li>
<br>(This is a really early shot with Casanova in it, but I didn't know him or anything, just noticing about a year after the fact, hehe.)<br>
<li><a href="http://www.geocities.com/brcalley82/oldtimes/06-99-2.jpg" TARGET="_blank">Early UN Raid of Oasis With Razalas and Ungrim</a> [June 1999]</li>
<br>(This raid went so horribly that most of us died.  I think all the people you're seeing were the extent of the raid, it was pathetic, hehe.)<br>
<li><a href="http://www.geocities.com/brcalley82/oldtimes/07-99-1.jpg" TARGET="_blank">Jazzdu Spotted Outside Runnyeye</a> [July 1999]</li>
<br>(Hehe, I was going through my shots and couldn't believe it, there's Jazzdu!)<br>
<li><a href="http://www.geocities.com/brcalley82/oldtimes/07-99-2.jpg" TARGET="_blank">Ayd, Tiane, Overcast, Sangwyn, Ravhin - All At Mistmoore Zone</a> [July 1999]</li>
<br>(Here's another one.  Tiane, Fin, Ayd and I used to group in Mistmoore a LOT back then, it was great fun.  Looking back, I probably hadn't heard of Overcast, Sangwyn, or Ravhin when I was here with them.)<br>
<li><a href="http://www.geocities.com/brcalley82/oldtimes/07-99-3.jpg" TARGET="_blank">Earliest Shot I Could Find Of Ranadin</a> [July 1999]</li>
<br>(This is probably my earliest sighting of Ran, deep in Runnyeye fighting some eyes.)<br>
<li><a href="http://www.geocities.com/brcalley82/oldtimes/08-99-1.jpg" TARGET="_blank">Untasid, Krassotkin, Hurtz, Fin, Crazdem, Tesh - Checking Out Duel Wielding Pet</a> [August 1999]</li>
<br>(I think in this shot we're checking out Crazdem's new pet.  Basically we're all ooohing and aaahing over the fact that it duel wields and looks so much cooler than those loser necro skeletons, hehe.)<br>
<li><a href="http://www.geocities.com/brcalley82/oldtimes/08-99-2.jpg" TARGET="_blank">First Time Meeting Modok, He Was Being Attacked, Hehe</a> [August 1999]</li>
<br>(Used to hang out with Modok a lot in Cazic.  First time I met him, some poor sap trained the Cazic entrance and almost killed Modok, hehe.)<br>
<li><a href="http://www.geocities.com/brcalley82/oldtimes/08-99-3.jpg" TARGET="_blank">Aleio, Modok, and Tesh, Camping For Rubi Gloves - Get In Mah Belly!</a> [August 1999]</li>
<br>(Camping for rubi gloves, it's Aleio and Modok playing "Get In Mah Belly!" while waiting for respawns.)<br>
<li><a href="http://www.geocities.com/brcalley82/oldtimes/08-99-4.jpg" TARGET="_blank">Early Demirk and Old Guide Armor</a> [August 1999]</li>
<br>(In this shot, we had found Overfien on top of the temple using a little See Invis.  Not sure why the guide showed up.  Either Overfien petitioned and said we were doing something or the guides were watching him, which wouldn't have suprised me at all considering how many times they warned him to get off that roof.)<br>
<li><a href="http://www.geocities.com/brcalley82/oldtimes/08-99-5.jpg" TARGET="_blank">Camping Drelzna For JBoots With Ranadin and Ungrim</a> [August 1999]</li>
<br>(Soon after this, Xarissa and Finuala joined the party as well I think.  We also has Mein and Wizarro from the first incarnation of Dark Exile kill steal a Drelzna off us that night as I recall.  It freaked Ranadin out so much that he broke out of our party and started telling us he was going to KS us because he apparently thought it was the only way to get things done in the game and that the members of Dark Exile had somehow proved this to him.  After we convinced him that somebody the same level as us wasn't going to KS a group of 5 players, he rejoined the group.  A few months later, probably due to their horrible reputation, Dark Exile break up.  Months and months after that, Ranadin recreated Dark Exile as "The Dark Exile" with him as it's leader.  I'm not insinuating anything, it's just an interesting and true story.)<br>
<li><a href="http://www.geocities.com/brcalley82/oldtimes/09-99-1.jpg" TARGET="_blank">Aeon, Tulvaran, Tiane, Tesh - Clearing Path To Tae Room</a> [September 1999]</li>
<br>(Ah yes, the rubicite days, Aeon almost in full rubi there.  Not sure if she ever completed her set.)<br>
<li><a href="http://www.geocities.com/brcalley82/oldtimes/09-99-2.jpg" TARGET="_blank">Xzibit (aka. Zibbi's first character)</a> [September 1999]</li>
<br>(Ah yes, Zibbi showing off by giving us all group wolf form.  This is before he started his Zibbi character I think as well.  That's also Tairro hiding just behind him as well, who was probably grouped with us to camp rubi gloves.)<br>
