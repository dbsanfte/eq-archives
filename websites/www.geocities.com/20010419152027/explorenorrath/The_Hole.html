	<td><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"><br><br><br><br>This is no exploit we're talking about here... it's all about learning the value of the faction system in Norrath, and how it can benefit you. In 30 minutes, you can have a character ready to explore this zone and see all the fascinating detail and work Verant has put into The Hole.<br><br></span></font><b><u><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">A Brief History of The Hole:</span></font></b></u><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">  In Paineel there is an NPC named Talloth Vara who tells of the great battle between the Erudites and Heretics, and how great magics caused a catastrophe that formed The Hole, which became the home of the Heretics. A passageway called 'The Vault' was created by Brell Serilis to seal off the Plane of Underfoot within the Hole, but the vault was weakened and allowed monsters out to roam free in their beautiful new city. The monsters took over the city and its palace, forcing the Heretics to create a new home in Paineel. Master Yael, elemental-form leader of the Brell minions, now guards the sacred entrance to the Plane of Underfoot.<br></span></font><b><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"><br></span></font></b><b><u><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">How Can I Explore The Hole?:</span></font></b></u><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">  As you might have noticed from the history, most of the monsters in the Hole are denizens of the god Brell Serilis. While some other race/class combinations might be possible, my suggestion is to create a </span></font><b><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">dwarf rogue, worshipping Brell Serilis</span></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">.</span></font><b><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> <br><br></span></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">After you have created your rogue, your first step is to get the rogue to level 3. This is because dwarf rogues have the ability to 'sneak' upon creation, but your additional skill asset of 'hide', which will be the real value in&nbsp; your explorations, is not granted until level 3. You can easily get that level in about 15 minutes by merely having one of the many druids found in Butcherblock Mountains (or your own personal druid friend) buff you with sow, thorns, and hit points, and then off you go to slaughter and level up fast. It is important during this time that you hotkey the 'sneak' ability and use it often, so that your skill increases as fast as possible to prepare you for your explorations.<br><br>Before you get a transport to Tox to start your adventure after you reach level 3, be sure to train 'hide' at your guild in Kaladim. By now your sneak should be maxed out for your level (or nearly so), so put all of your available skill points into hide to get it as high as you can.<br><br></span></font><b><u><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">How To Sneak/Hide to Avoid Detection: </span></font></b></u><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> You will be amazed at these two early skills that rogues get. To use them to their fullest advantage (and you should practice this to get familiar with it before you enter an area where you will need them), please see the guide on </span></font><a href="New_Rogue.html"><font color="#990000" face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">'Creating a New Rogue'</span></font></a><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">.<br></span></font><b><u><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"><br>Getting to The Hole</span></font></b></u><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">: Now it's time to visit Paineel, location of the gateway to the Hole. By druid transport, travel due south to the entrance of Paineel at location (approx.) 300, neg2300. By wizard transport, find the zone wall that is located (usually to your left as you zone in) near the wizard spires. Follow the wall to the right and you'll come upon a temple area that is the city entrance.<br><br>Once you zone into Paineel, The Hole entrance will be your first left, out into a courtyard, then your first hallway to the right and down. There are rocks within a pool at the base of this hallway that mark the entrance to the Hole. You will be able to swim without dying, but have a friend or someone in the zone bind you near that pool, so that any subsequent deaths don't set you back travel-wise. <br><br>There is a trick to getting inside the water tunnel to the Hole, and it may take a little practice at first: A slight hole is located near the top of the rock pile. If you duck and move as if you're trying to fit through the small hole, then unduck, you should be inside the rock, and able to swim forward into the tunnel that zones you to the Hole. Practice this a few times to make the transition with plenty of air to spare, before heading in. (You don't need sneak/hide for this.)<br><br>Now you are in the Hole, and I'll leave it to you to explore the sites and use any </span></font><a href="http://www.eqmaps.com"><font color="#990000" face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">maps</span></font></a><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> available, to make the the most of this adventure. A word of note: Be sure you use sneak/hide as soon as you exit the water pool, and a sow is highly recommended for this, since the skills make you move slower than usual. Some mobs appear to see through your sneak/hide, but nothing will attack you as long as you keep the skills in use.<br><br>See some </span></font><a href="The_Hole_SS.html"><font color="#990000" face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">screenshots</span></font></a><font color="#663300" face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">I took while there, to further pique your interest!<br><br><br><br></span></font><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="-1"><span style="font-size:12">Page Update: 01/24/01</span></font></b></i></td>
