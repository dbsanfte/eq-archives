I'll worry about that later for now bit of an update<br>
Happy new year if I haven't told you in-game.<br>
We are now listed on the official Brell Serilis<br>
site as a guild on the server =). Thx to their webmasters<br>
Interestingly enough it seems on the test server<br>
Shadow Knights now get Summon Corpse at level 50<br>
Lots of complaints /rants to /dev/null I like the idea<br>
especially due to the lack of necro's in our guild<br>
Tried to do this really cool thing to the members area<br>
but photoshop was not liking me at all today so it'll<br>
happen at a later date and I do need lots more info from<br>
you guys to get it going.<br>

	<td>Ok guys just tossing this in here as really an attempt to make the website look a little more themed and easier to maintain. We have no cgi/perl server side access so no go on getting that kind of thing going. Anyways, Sotten has attained 42, Ruffil 41, Azzi 41, Dyrius well hrmmph he's leveling away =). Congrats to all!<br>--Azzi</td>

Azzi hit 37, Sotten 38, Ruffil 39, Dyrius 48 and Aedwyr 51.<br>
I cannot say how cool that is look at it again :)<br>
I do know the screenshots are broken right now will<br>
look into that tonight see what's up. I will be going<br>
on an exploratory epedition of Kedge Keep this weekend<br>
would like to do it on saturday during the noonish hours.<br>
Anyone that wants to go I'll start a _new_ Kedge Keep area<br>
in the forum let me know who's interested as I have never been<br>
with any character I'm sure it'll be interesting.<br>
--Azzi<br><br>
Update - Fixed Screenshots .. gonna revamp that whole area<br>
soon. I don't like the way it looks. Other areas probably<br>
need attention more but get to what I can when I find a<br>
cool way to do something have a cool idea for screenshots<br><br>
<img src = "../Images/news.jpg"><b>December 12th, 2000: Kreon's record day in Hate...</b><br>
Well, Kreon and myself went up to the Planes of Hate<br>
last night but I don't think even Innorouk could have<br>
seen this out come. Kreon won the following:<br>
Trueheart Shield, Darkmetal Holy Water Sprinkler,<br>
Theologian Claymore, Tainted Darksteel Breastplate.<br>
WOOT KREON! For the record thats all the paladin stuff<br>
that drops in PoH that isn't on Innorouk himself.<br>
--Groul<br>
<B>***UPDATE***</B><BR>
Kreon obtained the Razing sword last night(12/13) AS WELL as his<br>
first half of his Fiery Avenger book. Way to go bud!!!<br>
--Groul<br><br>
<img src = "../Images/news.jpg"><b>December 11th, 2000: Phat lewt...</b><br>
Goings on. Dyrius got his Polished Mithril Mask yesterday in<br>
the FG raid. Dyrius got his Carmine Boots on the Fear raid<br>
on Thursday night. Groul finished his SECOND full suit of<br>
Umbral Platemail armour in Fear after somehow managing to<br>
loot, count them, THREE Umbral bracers in two raids. Not<br>
very elusive any more are they Groul?! Azzi obtained his<br>
Robe of the Foci through some interesting trades<br>
(Woot us!). Thats all I know of. Hope I didn't leave<br>
anything/anyone out.<br>

<img src = "../Images/news.jpg"><b>December 4th, 2000: Alliance with House RIFT formed...</b><br>

<img src = "../Images/update.jpg"><b>October 28th, 2000: Updated Screenshots</b><br>
Self proclaimed <em>Guild Field Photographer</em> Yaziron has<br>
recently started grabbing screenshots of our travels<br>
Prior to this all of our screenshots were just put in when<br>
we thought one looked good. As of yet I do not have any<br>
functionality within these pages to archive/categorize<br>
the screenshots. Hopefully the field photographer will work <br>
with me on this one =). Right now I have updated the screenshots<br>
thumbnailed them and semi have them how they will be.<br>
More creativity will come with these screenshots I hope<br>

<img src = "../Images/update.jpg"><b>October 21st, 2000: Life Leach complete</b><br>
With many thanks to Ulein (SP?), Slyghost and Vorador we<br>
tore down the montrous zombie with little difficulty.<br>
After Groul obtained the Gold white necklace from Lguk we<br>
promptly formed a good group and destroyed this individual<br>
Also Yaziron and myself obtained EE bags (luck of the spawn =)<br>

<img src = "../Images/news.jpg"><b>September 20th, 2000: Lucan raid tonight at 7pm!!</b><BR>
Last nights raid got bumped due to the patch taking til about<br>
9pm last night. At any rate half the Council of Knights was on<br>
last night and so we decided to go camp Mistmoore in the hope of<br>
locating Xicotl. At any rate he fell not long after the stroke <br>
of midnight and Kreon was able to wrestle the glowing sword hilt<br>
of the fabled Soulfire sword from his dying body. Congratz <br>
Kreon, lets get Lucan for you now!<br>

<img src = "../Images/update.jpg"><b>September 6th, 2000: Minor Updates and Status statement.</b><BR>
I have updated the progress and portraits of a number of <BR>
members. Things have gone very well for the Knighthood in the<BR>
last while. We now have two members in the 40s and two more<BR> that are OH so close, keep up the good work all. For those<BR>
that are just getting up in the ranks keep up the good work<BR>
too. We have seen great improvement across the board. <BR>
Equipment is coming together well. I know I have got some<BR>
choice pieces in the last couple of days. Kefla got his RMBs,<BR>
Kreon now has an almost complete set of equipment. Just need<BR>
to get him a Hero Bracer, a haste belt and help him with his<BR>
Soulfire quest(Guild raid will be announced down the road on<BR>
this). Aedwyr is looking good, got his BCP and black chitin<BR>
legs. He just needs Eboots and RMBs now. Grudzak our primary<BR>
warrior is starting a cleric by the name of Lanthade. If you<BR>
can help him at all please do. We need Clerics and<BR>
Enchanters badly. Anyway thats about it.<br>
