<h2><b><u>6/18/02</u></b>&nbsp; BoW disbands.</h2> All the leaders decided that it was too much like work to try to keep this guild going, and who wants to play a game if it becomes a job?  Thank you for playing with us and we wish you the best in your future endeavors. Hopefully we will cross paths in future endeavors.<BR><BR>
<b><u>6/16/02</u></b>&nbsp; Hit up Kael and Umbral Plains this weekend. Kael was
a punk and didn't drop anything. UP is currently being the same way. Oh
well...next week ;^)<br>
&nbsp;Fenzur the Monk was added to the Planes Roster this week. Gratz!!
Also...if you look on the left side I added a Planes Roster. Check it out ;^)<br>
&nbsp;We are looking to start up recruiting soon. If you know someone who wants
to join, send them to the message boards and have them fill out an application.<br>
&nbsp;Slow news week otherwise....see ya later.
<p>
<b><u>6/09/02</u></b>&nbsp; Good raids into Kael and CoM. Kael was shortened due
to clerics having to leave. Picked up a couple things in there. CoM went down as
a joint raid with DoN. Was fairly full, but managed to get Khur his last piece
for his epic. Gratz to BoWs' newest epic-bearer!!!<br>
&nbsp;Saturday was a good day if you needed epic pieces. Along with Khur getting
his epic, Vileknox and Azmodania got another step closer to theirs.<br>
&nbsp;The planes roster welcomes its newest addition, Pulvies the Druid.
Congratz!!<br>
&nbsp;I've noticed that the atmosphere in guild chat and overall seems 1000
percent better this week. Thanks to all of you who have stayed through this time
and are helping us to continue to grow. See ya all in game.</p>
<p>
<b><u>6/02/02</u></b>&nbsp; Major changes in the guild. Too many problems were
happening so we've had to take drastic action to get the guild back to where we
wanted to go when it was founded. There is no more CLM positions. The only
officers in the guild now are the Council of Five. Everyone in the guild is on a
1 month probationary period. Meaning if you aren't following the rules laid down
in the guild policies, then you will be removed from the guild. Due to either
inactivity or people leaving, our mains roster has been trimmed by over 50
people in the last 3 days. We still have over 100 mains in the guild, but now we
are looking at making the guild a better place for everyone. We want quality not
quantity and if someone doesn't fit into that or doesn't like how things are
currently run, we ask that you send us an e-mail letting us know that you are
leaving and /guildremove. We've had WAY to many people that we knew were good
quality players leave us over stupid things that were happening and it stop HERE
AND NOW. Even one leaving is too many. WE WILL NOT HAVE IT HAPPEN ANYMORE.<br>
&nbsp;On to lighter news. We had 8 people break into the planes roster this
week. Bladehammer, Relith, Drokow, Ardal, Dondo, Vardane, Yweni, and Bgie are
the newest additons. GREAT JOB!!!<br>
&nbsp;Other than that, nothing else to report. If you have any questions or
concerns over how things are going, e-mail us at <a href="mailto:BoWRathe@yahoo.com">BoWRathe@yahoo.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b><u>5/26/02</u></b>&nbsp; We're talking about dropping Naggy again this
weekend. If you are 52 and will be able to make it to the raid, make sure ya do
a lil AAexp this week ;^) Higher levels will be there for support. Check the
boards for the time. We beat up on Umbral Planes and Kael this weekend. Gratz to
those who got loot!<br>
&nbsp;The planes roster is proud to welcome Replicant the Shaman and Yanzi the
Shadow Knight to its pages! Congratz u2!<br>
&nbsp;The guild is steadly growing and new faces keep showing up. Remember this
is a family and friends based guild. Act accordingly. Be respectful of others
and their feelings as they could be the one who saves you from a long wait for a
rez!<br>
&nbsp;Also...I'm still looking for a replacement for my lil sign up top of the
page. If you are interested in doing that, send in your work to <a href="mailto:bowrathe@yahoo.com">BoWRathe@yahoo.com</a>
