<h3><i>Long Ago...</i>

      after the pact with Rallos Zek, Cazic Thule, and Brell, Mother Tunare gave birth to the Elves on
the great continent of Tunaria (now Antonica). Tunare loved the beauty of the forests, teaming them with life of
Pixies, Fearies, Fae Drakes, and even the Brownies. She created them searching for great beauty. After the brownies 
revolted against most other forms of life the great Mother with all her love did not kill them, but she went to seek a
new race of limitless beauty and grace. That day, the first elf was born.<br><br><img src="dragonia.jpg" align="left">

       The first female born was the ancient elf named Dragonia ("Drak-go-ne-a" Elder Elvish). She was created in 
Tunare's beautiful image. Created as a piece of the Great Mother herself. Dragonia lived for over four hundred
years alone among the Fearies, brownies, and the pixies. Even Emperor Fae Drake invited her to stay among them.
Finally, one day Dragonia told the Great Mother that she wanted creature like herself, or at least one 
close. The Mother saw that Dragonia's duties to the forest were great, and she would need to give her a creature
of a strong back and arms. From Dragonia's image the Mother created the first man, Hopeis. Though a very beautiful
creature, he was not as sharp as Dragonia, due to he was but a mere copy of her, and not as sharp as the original.
He was a less perfect image of Mother Tunare than Dragonia. <img src="Hopeis.jpg" align="right"> <br><br>

        Hopeis was a good creature to Dragonia. He was more mischievous although---less perfect than Tunare. Dragonia 
and Hopeis had made love, and she bore him the first Elven children. After 800 years of peace, Hopeis and the 
male children pushed Dragonia's daughters down in society and killed Dragonia. Soon the great creation was 
forgotten, and men abused the sisters.<br><br>

<i>Now, 2487 years later Karai, a Paladin of Tunare had a dream...</i><br><br>

"Karai...Karai my child...wake." the Great Mother said. Karai's eyes shot open, looking at the Mother floating 
above her. "Yes, Loving Mother?" she said, shaking. "Let me tell you the tale of the Elves..." the Mother said.<br><br>

      Karai learned the truth...That men merely exist to serve females. She told her to gather strong sisters, and brothers 
who can see the truth and reform the Elves who can see the light. The Wood Elves, whom she loves dearly, are welcome.
The High Elves, who serve her with holy magic, may join her. The Dark Elves, whom abandoned her are, still her children
who she loves dearly, and are welcomed to if they return to her. The Humans and Barbarians, whom are welcome to
join the Mother. Lastly the Erudites, Dwarves, Gnomes, and the Halflings who convert their ways to hers.<br><br>

      Males are allowed in as slaves. Slaves are to be treated good as long as they remain good, for they to are of
the Mother.</font><br><br></h3>

<br><br>
<h3>
Sisters, Tunarians, and Heretics---Hear the words of Karai, Paladin of Tunare!<br><br>

In my travels many servants of Tunare and of <img src="hailqueen.jpg" align="left">other orders called my insane for following my Mother Tunare's orders. As Dragon Ladies we must stand up to our beliefs and goals. Our first goal is to establish a strong Sisterhood among us and put together laws and rights of all members. From the highest officer to the lowest Male slave they need to be treated fairly and with respect. As for our latest male slaves I ask you sisters even though the conflict against males and heretics is strong, to be nice and kind to our slaves. They are sons of Tunare aswell, although inferior to us sisters, they are life blessed by the Great Mother. I, and hopefully you, do not want to shed more blood than there needs to be shed. I do not believe in mercy for heretics, but mercy for the true converts, and mercy for the just. When we loot and destroy villages of heretics we do not kill the innocent but in self-defense. No child is to be killed, nor and priest or holy clergy of any gods that serve a noble god or goddess. For we too must respect Tunare's concubines. I shall rest my words for now---and tell that all that the Mother shall accept may roost under our banner. Those that oppose it shall meet the force of Tunare!<br><br><br>

<i>The Task ahead of us is never as great as the power behind us.<br><br>

Karai Tunaria, Guild Mistress of the Dragon Ladies </i><br><br><br></font>
