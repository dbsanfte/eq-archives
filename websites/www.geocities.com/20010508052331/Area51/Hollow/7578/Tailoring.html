<center><h1>Tailoring by (name here soon)</center></h1><p>
Tailoring is a excellent low level skill to learn. It is not the most profitable skill, but it does supply a low level character with more
   than enough money to keep then well equipped. And the monsters that drop tailoring components are also low level, making them it
   fairly easily for a lower level character to to hunt them. When you become an avid tailor you can make three different types of
   armor; Patchwork, Studded Leather, and Reinforced leather. And to make the different armors need to use different quality pelts:
   This table shows what quality pelt is needed to make which armor:<p>
Patchwork: Ruined pelts<img src="http://www.everlore.com/files/wolfpelt.gif"><p>
Studded: Med quality<img src="http://www.everlore.com/files/catpelt.gif"> <p>
Reinforced: High quality<img src="http://www.everlore.com/files/bearpelt.gif"><p>
All patchwork is sewn with ruined pelts, and can be created in either a small sewing kit or a large sewing kit.<p>
To make PW (patchwork) armor you need One ruined pelt and one pattern. combine them in your sewing Kit <p>
<center><h2> Studded Leather </center></h2><p>
All studded leather is sewn with medium quality pelts. And also requires studs. Studs cannot be bought from merchants, you must
   make the studs yourself or buy them off of a blacksmith. If you interested in making your own studs then go to our blacksmithing
   guide. To make studded leather items you follow the same procedure that you followed in making patchwork items, only now you
   have the extra ingredient of studs.<p>

<center><h2> Reinfoced Leater </center></h2><p>
Reinforced leather, is the most durable leather that one can create. It as well as studded is made with a components that only
   blacksmiths can create. It requires steel borings in its construction. You can either make the steel borings you self (if you are
   interested in doing it yourself then see our blacksmithing guide) or you can buy them off of already accomplished blacksmiths. You
   cannot buy steel borings off of merchants or venders. Reinforced leather also requires a large sewing to kit to be sewn in, and is
   made following the same procedure as was used to make both patchwork and studded items.<p>
