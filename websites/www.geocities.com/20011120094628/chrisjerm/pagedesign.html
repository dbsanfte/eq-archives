<H2>Welcome to ChrisJerm web page design!</H2><BR>
<PRE>			   I would like to give you a little backround about us. My
<B>Portfolio</B>  	   friend and I started ChrisJerm about two years ago. At first we 
<B>Pricing</B>		   just had a small site about EverQuest, but soon after that it 
		   turned into a big site. Many people visited our site, complemented 
		   it, and supported us. After having that site for about a year
		   and a half, we decided we wanted to become web page designers in
		   our future. We decided the best way to get into that profession 
		   would be starting early. We now had over a year of experience in 
		   making web pages and decided maybe we should start making sites for 
		   other poeple. At that point we starting we started working on this 
		   portion of the site. Our skills have advanced significantly since 
		   the beginning and we have learned advanced html and beginner's java. 
		   Most people ask me, "What the heck is chrisjerm?" Well it's quite 
		   simple actually, My name is Chris and my friend's name is Jermaine. 
		   So we put the two together and came up with ChrisJerm. Click on the 
		   links to the left to find out more about the service, and thanks 
		   for your time. We hope you make the right decision and go with us!
