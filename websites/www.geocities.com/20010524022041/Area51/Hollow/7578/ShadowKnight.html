<center><i><h1> The Shadow Knight</center></i></h1><p>
The evil twin to the Paladin class, Shadow knights derive all of their powers from the evil gods whom
they server. they are a meld of Warrior and Necromancer, and share some of their abilities and
spells. In their ways, Shadow Knights are more dangerous than anyone else for they view themselves
as being at war with all things good and pure. Shadow Knights are Chaos in physical form, bringing
with them nothing but sorrow and pain. a Shadow Knight can become one
of the most feared opponents. People seem to underestimate them, and they're wrong. When you
creat your characters, you should aslo be warned that you will have many enemies and few friends in
Norath. Yu will indeed have a very few friends if you play a Dark Elf, Troll or Orge. You'll be killing
on sight in many places and few vendors will want to sell to you. Shadow Knights are hard to play at
first but, as your caracter becomes stronger, an opponent facing you will realize that your spells
aren't so weak after all. And they'll never know when Harm Touch is coming. A shadow Knight is
a Warrior given spells to help him kill more effciently. Use them wisely and you will lose very few
battles.<p>
