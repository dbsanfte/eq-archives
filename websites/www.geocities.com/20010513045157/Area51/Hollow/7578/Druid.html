There are three things that druids
                    do better than others - travel
                    (camouflage, spirit of wolf, and solo
                    or group teleports), damage shields
                    (great for long combats), and
                    playing with animals (sense, charm,
                    buff them, terrorize).  The other
                    great thing about a druid is that,
          while they are not the master of any one thing,
          they are the best class to fill in the gaps that a
          party has.  Need a healer?  Druids are the
          second best (tied with Shaman) next to
          Clerics!  Need extra firepower?  You got it
          -perhaps only the wizard outshines her here! 
          No Shaman or Enchanter?  Druids have decent
          buffs as well.  Druids also have the tracking
          skills of a Ranger.  Given time to meditate,
          they can buff you before combat, destroy
          creatures during it, and heal you afterwards. 
          No one else can do that for just one cut of the
          experience.  Because they have such a wide
          variety of skills, Druids are one of the better
          solo classes out there.  However, many of their
          best spells don't work unless they are
          outdoors, making them difficult to play in a
          dungeon, where many of the best items can be
          found.   Druids are also weaker at each given
          area than the equivalent specialty class. This is
          a good class for a person who likes to do a little
          of everything, without being a master of any. <p>
