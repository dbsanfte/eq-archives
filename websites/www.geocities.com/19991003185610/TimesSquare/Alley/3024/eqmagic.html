<p><b>I will be updating this page as more information becomes available.  For now, I will provide information on the spellcasting classes.</p><br>
<!--LINE1-->
<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="eqpics/matchingbar.jpg"></P></CENTER><br>

<br><center>THE PURISTS</center><br><br>
<p> These are defined as those classes whose primary functions involve magery.  As such, they are poor fighters in melee combat, and may not wear armor.  Equippable weapons for pure spellcasters tend to be limited to the dagger and the staff.</p><br>

<br><center>NECROMANCER</center><br><br> This spellcaster devotes him/herself to the dark arts and prefers to concentrate on death related spells. Necromancers, have an uncanny ability to locate PC corpses.  Their aid can be invaluable when one has difficulty finding one's body.  Some of their spells require reagents prior to casting.  Dark elves and Erudites make very capable necromancers.<br>
<br><center>MAGICIAN</center><br><br>The mage concentrates his efforts on summoning magick. Spells to summon pets usually require reagents prior to casting. Unfortunately, pets dissapear when crossing server boundaries.  They are powerful spellcasters and have the ability to summon food and water out of thin air.  Summoned vittles, however, tend to dissapear when the bearer logs out of Norrath.  High Elves and Erudites make particularly good magicians.<br><br>
<center>ENCHANTER</center><br><br>The Enchanter focuses energy in embedding and empowering objects with magical forces.  They are very helpful to smiths by enchanting weapons and armor.  They are powerful spellcasters.<br>
<br><center>WIZARD</center><br><br>These are the most powerful and learned of the purists.  The wizard has great facility with both offensive and defensive spells.  In higher levels, they are able to teleport themselves throughout the lands or Norrath.  Because of their power, they are unequaled in magical combat from a distance.  Like all Purists, in melee, they are practically helpless.  High Elves, Gnomes, and Erudites make the most powerful wizards in the Norrath. <br><br>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="eqpics/matchingbar.jpg"></P></CENTER><br>

<br>
<center>THE HYBRIDS</center><br><br>

<p> I define as Hybrids, those classes that are able to cast spells and to fight effectively in melee combat.  To counterbalance this dual role, hybrid classes are not as skilled in melee as warriors and are weaker in magery than the pure spellcasters.</p><br>
<center>DRUID</center><br><br>The druid hails from the woodlands.  Because of this he feels more comfortable using nature based spells. For example, a druid may disguise himself as a tree in order to avoid unfavorable encounters. As a child of nature, the druid is rarely attacked by animals unless he attacks first.  In higher levels, the druid has spells that enable teleportation to various points in Norrath.  Druids also have some healing ability.  I would define the Druid as a spellcaster that has a general ability in each of the magickal disciplines, though not as focused as the specialists in each skill.  Wood elves and Halflings make formidable Druids.<br> 
<br>

<br><center>CLERIC</center><br><br>The cleric focuses primarily in healing and defensive spells.  They are always welcome in adventuring groups because not only can they heal effectively, but they are capable of delivering extensive melee damage as well.  Although they do not have at their disposal the variety of weapons and armor that warriors may use, they are able to use some weapons and don some armor.  Additionally, they have a vast repertoire of high level spells at their disposal.  A variation is the SHAMAN, who tends to give more emphasis to tribal lore in his healing and defensive spellcasting.  Like the Cleric, the Shaman is an effective fighter in melee combat and has an extensive variety of spells to work with.  Dwarves and High Elves make excellent Clerics, while Barbarians make formidable Shamans.  With respect to spellcasting, the reader should not be lead to believe that their magery is equal to the purist.  Although formidable, the Cleric and Shaman wait much longer for abilities that spellcasters receive early on, such as meditation.  However, I would consider Clerics and Shamans as spellcasters first and warriors second.<br><br>

<br><center>PALADIN</center><br><br>Paladins are a combination of warrior and cleric, in that order.  They are more formidable fighters than clerics and have more choices in armor and weapons. They have some healing ability and evoke the forces of good in their magery.  However, their spell repertoire is very limited and rudimentary.  <br><br><center>RANGER</center><br><br>In a nutshell, Rangers are to Druids as Paladins are to Clerics.  They are warriors first, healers second.  They are equal to the Paladins in fighting skills but their equally rudimentary spellcasting is of the Druid, or nature, variety.<br>
<br><center>SHADOWKNIGHT</center><br><br>These are a combination of Warrior and Necromancer.  Equal in skill to the Paladin and Ranger, they are formidable fighters in melee combat and have an equally wide variety of weapon and armor choices.  Like the Necromancers, they are followers of the dark arts but with as limited and rudimentary spellcasting ability as their Paladin and Ranger counterparts.<br>
<br><center>BARD</center><br><br>Lastly but not leastly we come to the Bard.  Bards are a class all their own.  They are excellent fighters with weaponry and abilities in the martial arts.  Their magick however, is in the form of a wide variety musical instruments and song.  A welcome addition to any adventuring group, the bard is able to weave his spells through his music to enhance the combat/magick skills of his group as well as diminish those of his opponents.  His music also produces a limited healing effect for his party.<br><br>

I hope this section has been useful to you.</br><br>
