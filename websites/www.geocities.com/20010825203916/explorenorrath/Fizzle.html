	<td><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Well, this character certainly is... odd.<br>Hang around near the Firiona Vie bank <br>long enough and you'll get several <br>opportunities in a row to see Mister Fizzle<br>-- a troll shaman who doesn't appear to <br>be playing with a full deck.<br><br>Not much is known about this fellow yet.<br>He generally spawns in town (sometimes <br>between two and four times, one right <br>after another), then won't be seen again <br>for a while.&nbsp; After buffing himself, he <br>streaks through town until the pilgrims <br>and explorers (or a rogue guildmaster) <br>bring him down. When hailing him (I con<br>dubious to him, and apprehensive to the<br>locals), the only text I could get out of him<br>was a chuckle-worthy 'Yeah, yeah!! Hail this, bub!!', as he continued to do battle. <br><br>An interesting interaction I watched this morning, though: The first spawn of his cycle, he popped behind Frist Firstun's hut near the base of the statue of Firiona Vie, and immediately proceded to mix it up with Fyrefly, the town's pet drixie. They appeared to be about evenly matched, as the fight lasted quite some time, but that wasn't the interesting part. Frist Firstun was complete-healing both mobs during the battle, and never agro'd on Mister Fizzle. This lends credence to one player's comment on an EQ website, that he tried to aid to the townspeople in killing the troll, and was himself executed for his troubles.&nbsp; Eventually, the town's pet dog 'Dune' joined this morning's fray and finished off the troll, but not before I had seen yet another scrap of evidential text: Mister Fizzle reaches into his pouch. 'Time to let the spells fly!'.<br><br>Certainly one to leave you scratching your head. Perhaps someone with better faction than I can get more out of him. I assume he'd talk to evil races without a second thought, if they could get close enough to him to try. I was told by another player on my server this morning that the troll occasionally also spawns out in the fields beyond the city, so maybe that is a good place to start. With his colorful name and comments, he's certainly good entertainment value, if nothing else.</span></font><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:14"><br><br><br><br><br><br></span></font><b><i><font face="Arial" size="-1"><span style="font-size:12">Page Updated: 06/08/01</span></font></b></i></td>
