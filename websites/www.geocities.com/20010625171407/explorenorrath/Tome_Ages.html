Once<br>thought only good for dropping baby blue robes and<br>making paladin books, it now appears that the Oracle's<br>original quest has had some patches and is gearing up<br>to be one of the most massive quests the world has ever<br>seen, potentially resulting in (keep your fingers crossed) <br>one of the most powerful artifact items in the game. This<br>is </span></font><i><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">the</span></font></i><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> quest that all devotees of lore and exploration have<br>been patiently holding out for.<br><br>To properly delve into this monumental mission, a quick brush-up of your <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; world history is a must, but I shall attempt to highlight<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; most of it here for your benefit.&nbsp; The Oracle of K'Arnon<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is from a race almost as old as the planet herself, called<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Elddars.&nbsp; Once a thriving and harmonious race, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these forebears of all elven races currently in existance<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; used to inhabit Elddar Forest (now the Desert of Ro) on<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the original continent of Tunaria (Antonica). Before the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; War of the Broken Crown, which split the Elddars into<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the 3 current elven factions, the center of activity for<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this race was the city of Takish-Hiz, which has long-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; since sunken beneath the timeless sands of Ro (though<br>remenants of the city can still be seen rising up from some places in the sand). But eventually war did come to the Elddars and their ruler Emperor Kel'anthinstion -- not from their nemeses the Erudites, but from forces within their own race -- resulting in the obliteration of the capital city of Caerthiel and scattering the loyalists (dark elves), rebels (high elves), and wilds (wood elves) to various corners of the globe. <br><br>As was the Tome of Ages born to and nutured by the unified Elddar tribe many centuries before the war, so did their final conflict and splintering result in its destruction. Wanting to keep the Tome's eternal knowledge from the rebels' grasp, the Scribes of Dal made haste to break its 7 volumes into pieces, and entrusted the pieces to loyal scouts to disperse throughout the land, never to be made whole again.<br><br>Now enter the Oracle of K'Arnon, charged by the rebel leadership with the duty to seek the legendary Tome. Though the world we live in now is almost completely unrecognizable from his own world when his mission was set in stone for him, he and his guardian search ever onward, gleaning what bits of knowledge and hints of information as to the whereabouts of the scattered books that they can. A great and powerful artifact reward he would grant, for those who would aid him in his quest.<br><br>A transcript is provided below, so that you may see the whole of what he has to say when an adventurer first begins the quest (it should be noted that the books he says he does not seek,&nbsp; are merely ones he will not talk to you about, until&nbsp; you have given him the ones he WILL talk to you about). Your duty is to gather pieces of books and present them to a </span></font><a href="Binders.html"><font color="#990000" face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">binder</span></font></a><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> to make into whole volumes again, then deliver the volumes to the Oracle himself.&nbsp; Intermediary rewards and additional hints are given as each new volume is presented to him; upon completion of the seventh and final volume, the intermediary rewards are presented back to the Oracle, presumably, and the victor is rewarded with the artifact promised. I say presumably, because many fans of lore theorize that not all books are yet available in the game, one prime example being a volume that is somehow tied to the as-yet unenterable Plane of Underfoot. However, it was disclosed that only recently a third or fourth volume in the series was made obtainable, and the search for knowledge has gained new drive as players seek out clues to the existance of the remaining ones.
