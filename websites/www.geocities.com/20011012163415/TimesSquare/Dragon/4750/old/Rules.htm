<OL>

</B></I></FONT><LI>The nearest member player must loot the defeated player, but is required to return all coins and the item taken promptly.</LI>
<LI>In the case of multiple attackers where who should get looting rights is not agreed upon, each attacker generates a number from 1 to 1000 and the highest number gets Looting Rights.</LI>
<LI>The defeated player is then required to give a full list of all items (excluding no drop items), containers, and coin on the character at the time of death to the looting attacker.</LI>
<LI>The looting attacker than may choose either one non-stackable item OR one stack of stackable items OR up to one hundred coins as loot, with no compensation if the defeated player cannot provide a full twenty stacked items or one hundred coins.</LI>
<LI>The attacker is expected to base his choice of looting on character motivations.</LI>
<LI>Should the looting attacker choose a container and the looser will no longer be able to carry all items, reasonable arrangements must be made to allow the looser to store the items or replace the container first.</LI>
<LI>Should other inconveniences arise, the attacker and looser are expected to make reasonable arrangements for the granting of Looting Rights.</LI>
<LI>All time delays for resolving looting rights do not count towards the one hour between duel time, only after the looting is resolved does the hour begin.</LI>
<LI>While resolving looting rights, the involved parties are not obligated to engage in required roleplaying activities but must inform others that they are resolving a previous duel.</LI></OL>

<LI>Auction is a special channel used to seek or sell specific items, inquire about the statistics of items being sought or sold, or for making bids and offers on items being sought or sold.</LI>
<LI>Should the need arise to use an in-character channel for out-of-character conversation, the statement must always begin with OOC:</LI>
