</h1>
<p><font size="3"><b>Levels 1-4= Find your guild house, Hail everyone there and 
  repeat in question form the [bracketed words] that they say. You will learn 
  that you need 4 gnoll pup skins or scalps to get your first headband, the White 
  one, which gives you +1cha +1sta. Put 2 Practice Points in Kick and the rest 
  in Mend, all the other skills will level by themselves with no problem. Put 
  Kick in your hotkeys area and then head for North Qeynos. You are now ready 
  to fight the beasties in Qeynos. <br>
  <br>
  Avoid gnoll pups, green snakes, bats, and decaying skeletons until level 2. 
  Go after black red snakes and large rats. Collect snake fangs and rat skins 
  and ears; they are the best way to earn money at the lower levels. Only sell 
  your stuff to the vendor inside to Silent Fist Clan house, he gives the best 
  prices in Qeynos. At level 2-3 start attacking most enemies, except for gnolls 
  with the last name of Darkpaw (Wait until level 5 to go after these guys). At 
  level 4 you are awarded with your first special attack, Round Kick! Same delay 
  as Kick but hits much harder, does about 10dmg (14dmg on a good day). You are 
  now ready to head out into the Qeynos Hills.<br>
  <br>
  Level 5-8= If you follow the road you will find a crossroad with a large boulder 
  that is commonly referred to as the "marker", if you continue to head towards 
  Surefall Glade you will come across a cabin that has two merchants who will 
  sell you tailoring supplies. Farther on is just road and forest until you get 
  to the entrance to Surefall Glade. It may look intimidating and it is, inside 
  are bears and poachers, that's it. If you take the right at the marker you will 
  head for Karana, (important note: Do not go in Karana until level 12 or unless 
  you have a group, you will not survive.) along the road is a Guard House with 
  a couple of Guards. <br>
  <br>
  BlackBurrow, or BB, is the home of the gnolls in the Qeynos Hills, most of the 
  time you can expect to see 30-40 people in this one zone, makes it very hard 
  to hunt there. Start with scrawny gnolls and the occasional gnoll until level 
  7; this is when you can start going after gnolls and patrolling gnolls. BB is 
  notorious for the monster, as in huge, trains that come up from the basement 
  of BB, so if some one shouts "TRAIN!!" get out of BB fast! To the North of BB 
  are the Ruins, where one can see (and fight) all manner of skeletons: Decaying, 
  plain, Dread, Putrid, and Varsoon. You see Varsoon, run for Surefall, further 
  northwest, and don't stop until you are safe with the Guards. Varsoon is a high 
  level NPC that will tear a newbie apart.<br>
  <br>
  Level 9-10= Group with other people your level and go into to lower levels of 
  BB, you'll want to group with a warrior or someone with Taunt because as a Monk 
  you hit harder, faster, and more times then most classes. Gnoll Guardsmen, elite 
  guardsmen, gnoll brewers, and the elusive gnoll shaman all wait for you in the 
  lower floors of BlackBurrow. <br>
