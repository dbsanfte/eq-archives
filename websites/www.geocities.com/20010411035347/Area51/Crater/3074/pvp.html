<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=7 COLOR="#ff0000">General:</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>My Position:</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P>    From the first time I became a Player Vs Player addict, from the start of online gaming (for me it was about the first year of Warcraft II came out).  I was never able to get the full satisfaction from a NPC monster.  The thrill of knowing that someone else behind there keyboard, is watching me tear him up was more exciting then getting attacked by 5 Gnolls at once.  This is why I play PvP+.</P>
<P>** Note Newbie slashing is a pussy's </FONT><FONT COLOR="#808080">(excuse the female body part usage) </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080">way of getting attention.  Equal or better levels are the only way to get a real thrill**</P>
<P> </P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>So how do I become a PvP+?</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P>There are two Ways to become a PvP</P>
<P> 1.  Is to start on Rallos Zek.</P>
<P>2.  Visit your local Priest of Discord and do his quest.</P>
<P>Both ways are easy to do (with 1 being easier of course).  Starting on Rallos Zek server you must keep in mind that everyone on the server is a PvP so you must always watch your back.  Doing the Priest of discord's quest works like this:</P>
<P>1. You find him, you ask him about the letter/note, he give you the note, you read it, and give it back its that simple.</P>
<P>When playing on a regular server you may have trouble-finding people to fight, or you will be in the middle of fighting a Gnoll Guardsman and you get attacked from behind (personnel experience here).</P>
<P> </P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>So I start on Rallos Zek and I keep getting newbie killed what now?</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P>One of the big problems in EQ is Newbie slashing.  Luckily there are a few things working for you here.</P>
<P>1. You know that the people killing you are not more then 4 levels higher then you, and if your a newbie there just experienced newbie.</P>
<P>2.  Revenge will happen, In EQ everything that comes around goes around.  Just keep reading and you will soon be slaughtering the saps.</P>
<P>3.  You don't lose anything until level 4 anyhow.  So let your hate Boil, as it increases your power.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>Growing Up.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P>The first four levels are done the same way as any other server.  You get your spells, your pet, and your staff and then you hit level 4.</P>
<P> </P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>I see that newbie slasher can I have my revenge now?</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P>Now is your time to strike.  You already now you guys have to be close in levels (as he was newbie killin you earlier), now you have your spells your Level 4 pet and a Strong hatred.  Read the Strats to see how to effectively slay your target.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=7 COLOR="#ff0000"><P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="strat">S</A>trat's</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P>Let it be known that as a Necromancer you WILL be at a disadvantage in terms of PvP for a long time (and against some classes forever).  Here is a list of classes and how you rank against them.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ffff00"><P>*Note these match-ups are based on reasonably equal levels and PvP skill*</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#800000"><P>Wizards</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080">:  Their lack of healing and buffing spells, is killer for them.</P>
<P>Tips against Wizards: </P>
<P>1. Always keep your pet attacking the wizard if possible give him a fast hitting weapon to disrupt those killer spells of theirs.  (Most piercing weapons are good for this, faster the better)</P>
<P>2. Melee that wizard, you may not be very effective but the more you interrupt the better.</P>
<P>2. Drain, Drain, and Drain. Without the ability to heal the more you drain there Hp's and add to yours the better, after they get off a strong burn, you will be glad your draining.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#800000"><P>Magician</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080">:  These battles tend to be long and bloody as this classes is closest to your own.  </P>
<P>1. If possible get the first good hit in, a damage over time is best as it takes their life and disrupts their spells when they take damage.</P>
<P>2.  Keep your pet on the magi, Always go for the caster first then deal with the pet.</P>
<P>3.  Attacking with your pet is a toss up because you want to disrupt their spells but yours will be disrupted also.</P>
<P>4.  In most cases these battles go to the Necromancer because of the Drain Hp Spells.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#800000"><P>Druid's, Enchanters</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080">: These are combined because there handled the same way.</P>
<P>1. Pet attacks first followed by a good damage over time spell.</P>
<P>2.  Melee these all the time, they're weakening and damage potential is high.</P>
<P>3.  Drain often (as usual)</P>
<p></p>
<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#800000"><P>For the Bards:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080">: Your pet should have a Weapon With Medium Speed and Damage. One handed blunt or one handed slashing.
<p>1.  These Musical Misfits should be targeted with your pet first and depending on the song that is going will tell you how to handle them.</p>
<p>2.   If you see that he is gaining HP's back, then he has the healing song going.  Damage over time will slow this down (IE. gain some, lose some) Then Drain spells to lower the HP's More. You may consider doing Poison and Clinging darknes (or more powerful of the type, Slowing down and damage over time x 2)</p>
<p>3.  Any other type of song should be approached like this, Try your best to stay as far away as you can.  Start the attack with a good Damage over time and a Disease (Disease will stop the natural healing).  After this its Drain City.  I wouldn't recommend trying to Melee the Folk Singer, If you really must then try hitting from the back (or your pet in the back with you in the front) with your staff.<p>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ffff00"><P>**Word of Caution the next ones are more difficult for your class**</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#800000"><P>Clerics and Shaman's</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080">: These are also together for the same reason. </P>
<P>1.  Start the attack with your pet attacking with a large weapon but fairly fast, One handed blunt or sword weapons.</P>
<P>2.  Cast Cancel magic if you have it first (remove some of those buffs).</P>
<P>3.  Cast Root or other slowing spells.  You must keep away from melee range.</P>
<P>4.  Drain baby Drain. </P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ffff00"><P>**The rest are pure Melee classes.  Extreme Caution when fighting these**</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P>The next few tips will cover </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#800000">Rangers, Rogues, Paladins, Shadow Knights and Warriors and the Monk.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P>1.  Root, Root, Root this spell is you biggest advantage should pet your first attack.  If you don't have root use your best slowing spell)</P>
<P>2.  Send in your pet with the biggest weapon you can find.  (2 handed swords work well), Your pet will most likely die in battle and the more they Damage/Distract the better.</P>
<P>3.  Damage over time and area effect spells should be casted following the root spell (or other slowing spell).</P>
<P>4.  Run Backwards FACING your target, Stop to cast only, then continue running.  Try to lose dodge in and out of trees/hills to keep him from getting into melee range.</P>
<P>5. You WILL lose if they get in Melee range so don't let them.</P>
