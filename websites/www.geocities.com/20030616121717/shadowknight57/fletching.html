I first started Fletching with my very first character Treye, a Wood Elf Ranger. Full of wonder at the new world he had discovered in the forest, he quickly found that even a flask of water cost the earth to buy, and set out eeking a meagre living to buy himself food by collecting batwings and wasp parts and selling them on.</p><br>

While trolling through the vendors one day, he came upon an exciting discovery. The Fletching vendor! They sold arrows! They sold bows! But most exciting of all, they sold a box that you could make your very own bows and arrows in! Ranger heaven! Quite soon, Treye had scrounged up enough money to buy his very own Fletching kit. It took him a whole day, but he did it. He then spent another long day saving up enough to buy a Whittling Blade.<p><br>

So, there he was, proud new tools in hand, and he bought himself a simple Hickory Stave, and some Hemp String. He’d even made some arrows beforehand, to make sure he would have a better chance at making his first bow, and something to shoot with it afterwards. He places the stave and the string into the kit, along with the whittling blade, as the book he’d bought said that bows made with a knife were better. He prays to Tunare, and presses combine. Poor Treye never did do any Fletching again after that. Two day’s savings down the drain, because he didn’t know you can’t use a knife with the lowest grade of stave (back when a wrong combination of materials destroyed everything).<p><br>

Xanthe on the other hand had a lot of fun Fletching. The good thing about it is that you can go all the way from 0 skill to 250 standing in the same place in front of the arrow vendor (ok you might have to move a few steps to the bow vendor when you hit 202). Once you are 200 or over, there are some very nice bows that can be made from the Planes of Power expansion (albeit anything other than the Nightmarewood Compound Bow requires you to be in a high end guild to get the materials).</p><br>

As with pretty much everything, once you hit 202 there is the Fast and Expensive way to get up to 250 by making bows (I spent roughly 100k on those last 48 points, all vendor bought), or there is the Cheap and Sloooooow way that requires you to farm stuff, and make Tipped Acrylia Arrows. Both of these routes will be detailed, but the choice is yours to make. If you have a whole pile of money and dont mind giving it all to the vendor, then by all means take the shorter route.<p><br>


<p><img src="Forest.gif" align="left">There are many places in Norrath with Fletching vendors, the two most convenient ones that spring to mind are Surefall Glade (dark races beware) and of course the Plane of Knowledge. Before you begin you will need to buy yourself a Fletching Kit of some kind. A Planar one will work just as well as a normal one.</p><br>

Allegedly, a higher Dexterity on a character will increase your chances of success in Fletching, so if you have any dex gear then you might want to wear it, or get a buff.<p><br>

Here is the route that I took. As always, NEVER stack items in the Fletching kit.<p><br>

There are 4 components to every arrow: the <b>Point</b>, the <b>Shaft</b>, the <b>Fletch</b> (sometimes called a Vane), and the <b>Nock</b>. Some of these have an effect on the properties of the resulting arrow, and everything you could ever wish to know about bows and arrows can be found at <a href="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/aoenla/fletchguide/">Aoenla’s Fletching Guide</a>.<p><br>
Make sure that all 4 components are in the kit before you press combine. If you are successful you will receive 5 arrows, if you are not, all the items will disappear.<p><br>

<b><u><font size=+2>Notes</font></u></b><p>

<b><font size=+1>The Choice:</font></b> When you get to 202 skill you have a choice on how you wish to progress. If you have a lot of time on yours hands, or dont have enough money to do the bow route, you will need to farm Acrylia Ore from various places on Luclin in order to make arrows until 250. In addition to the acrylia you will also need Chunks of Condensed Flame/Shadow/Ice to make the arrowheads. This also drops on Luclin, from various jelly baby aliens (like the Centis you get in Akheva Ruins). If you have plenty of money and want to save yourself a lot of time, then make bows.<p><br>

<b><font size=+1>Standard Bow Cams:</b></font> These can be bought from the bow vendor. You need 2 per combine, which I think turns out at around 80pp or so give or take a bit of faction and charisma. If you are the tinkering type, it may interest you to know that these cams can also be tinkered for about a third of this cost (see recipe in table below). Over the amount of bow combines you will be needing, this can save you a fair bit of cash. <b>CAMS DO NOT STACK!</b>
<p><br>



<b><u><font size=+1>Manufactured items you may need - possibly</font></u></b><p><br>

If you are a smith, or know one, some arrow components can be made using that skill, although it is debatable whether it is more cost effective to make or buy the items. Here is a table of items that can be made.<p><br>
