<p align="left"><font color="#000000"><strong>Kaladim can be a
confusing place to those unused to traveling underground. The
city is located in a huge complex of caves located beneath
Stormhammer Mountain. The city's entrance is very hard to miss,
as the statue of King Kazon Stormhammer looms above <img
src="bbgates.gif" align="right" hspace="0" width="302"
height="185"></strong></font><font color="#000000"><strong>passers-by.
Our entrance, called Butcherblock Gate, is a fine example of
Dwarven stonework. You'll find no better masons or blacksmiths in
all Norrath than the Dwarves! Note the many guards as well. No
enemy has ever succeded in entering the city proper, not even the
great Wyrm Mordeethan, slain by Kul the Great during the last of
the Dragon Wars.</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000"><strong>After passing
through the gate,the traveler is presented with two passages, one
leading to the left, and one leading to the right. Let's examine
the left hand passage first. Passing through the tunnel, you will
enter one of the larger caverns in the city. You will see the
path continue on between an armory shop and Pub Kal, one of
Norrath's finer drinking establishments. You can find a wide
array of beverages here, and Dindaek Darkfoam will <img
src="arena.gif" align="right" hspace="0" width="324" height="162"></strong></font><font
color="#000000"><strong>be more than happy to buy loot from you.
Traveling onward, we come to a large, white marble structure.
This is the Arena of Kaladim. Our Warriors, such as myself,
obtain our training here. Be sure to greet Hogunk! If you are one
who enjoys the song of the blade, you will find much of interest
at the adjacent building, Stormguard Hall.</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000"><strong>Stormguard Hall is
the largest of Kaladim's Guilds. It is also the oldest, as
Dwarves are<img src="warrgld.gif" align="right" hspace="0"
width="326" height="211"></strong></font><font color="#000000"><strong>
warriors, first and foremost. You can often find me here if I'm
in town, which is rare these days. Rounding the pool in front of
the Hall (it's deep, so be careful), you will see the figure of
Vacto Mounel. He is a retired Warrior with a unique talent, of
which he will tell you if yor speak to him. Takeing the hall to
the right, you will often see one of our members looking out
through the window. He may have some work for an aspiring
Warrior. Continue on down the <img src="byzar.gif" align="right"
hspace="0" width="194" height="238"></strong></font><font
color="#000000"><strong>passage until you reach the Feast Hall.
There is a merchant here who often carries piece of patchwork
armor, for the Warrior neophyte. Entering the passage at the end
of the Feast Hall, you will see that it extend away from you in
both directions. At one end, you will find Canloe Nusback, who
trains our newer recruits. At the other, you will find Byzar
Bloodforge. Don't be put off by his gruff manner, he means no
real harm. His daughter was recently left at the altar by a cad.
Perhaps he will want some help....</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000"><strong>After exiting the
Warrior guild the way you came in (there's an exit to the Arena
too), you will see Redfist Metal Shop across the courtyard. You
can purchase many fine weapons and shields here, if you have the
platinum. Continue down the path between Redfist and the Arena.
You will come to an are with the Tanned Assets Shop (fine leather
goods, leather armor), and Irontoe's Eats. Be sure to say hello
to Tumpy, the proprietor. His Tumpy Tonics are a drink unrivaled
in the land, far better than that dog-water called Blackburrow
Stout. Now head down the path that runs next to the Arena. You
will see a building off to your left, as well as a path entering
a tunnel. Follow the tunnel to reach North Kaladim, home of the
Cleric, Rogue and Paladin Guilds. Turning to the right, you will
see a path that connects to the path you used when entering this
cavern. Go back up that path to reach Butcherblock Gate. Taking
the right path this time, you will see three buildings as you
exit the tunnel. The first is another leather goods shop. Across
the bridge, you'll find Gurtha's Wear and an Potion Shop.
Continuing on down the path, you'll come to Stormhammer Hold, the
residence of King Kazon Stormhammer. Be sure to show proper
respect towards the King, as the number of guards here rivals the
number at the Gates.</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000"><strong>The first thing you
see upon entering North Kaladim are the famed Dwarven Mines. <img
src="minecap.gif" align="right" hspace="0" width="339"
height="209"></strong></font><font color="#000000"><strong>Here
we extract valuable metals and gems from the earth. The gems are
exported (primarily to Felwithe), but the valuable metals, such
as gold, platinum, and silver, are purified and sold at Trantor
Everhott's Forge. The base metals, such as iron, tin, and copper,
are made into weapons. We Dwarves have a great affinity for the
axe (which tends to make druids and treants leery of us) and the
sword. Next to the mines is the the Ratsbone Assay and Treasury
Office (RATO). This building contains the bank and those working
here are responsible for keeping track of the earth's<img
src="roggld.gif" align="right" hspace="0" width="328"
height="191"></strong></font><font color="#000000"><strong>bounty
we remove. Oft found standing next to the RATO are the heads of
the Local 628, the Rogue/Miner's Guild. Be sure to talk to Jeet
about his vermin problem. He's known for giving unique items to
those who help him in some fashion.</strong></font></p>

<p><strong>From where your standing, you can see two passages:
one lies on the path between the Mine Cap and the RATO, and the
other between the RATO and the cavern wall. We'll examine the
second tunnel first. Heading down this passage takes you to
Underfoot Cathedral and Underfoot Hall, <img src="clrgld.gif"
align="right" hspace="0" width="346" height="200"></strong><strong>the
Cleric and Paladin Guild, repectivly. As you enter the cavern, be
sure to greet Doramafi Ratsbone, who sells supplies needed by
adventurers. Underfoot Cathedral is the large building bewfore
you, and is dedicated to the worship of the Lord of the Caverns,
Brell Serilis. He is the father of the Gnomes as well as the
Dwarves. Much to our anger, the blasphemous Gnolls of Split Paw
and the Runny Eye Goblins also claim he is their creator. Why
would the Lord of the Dwarves create two of their sworn enemies?
As you gaze upon all that is holy to the Dwarves, be sure to take
time to notice the fine dwarven architecture and engravings. If
you feel <img src="palgld.gif" align="right" hspace="0"
width="341" height="285"></strong><strong>compelled to bow and
pray to our Lord, feel free to do so. Behind Underfoot Cathedral
is aset of stairs leading up to the entrance to Underfoot Hall.
This is the home of the Paladin Guild. The awesome structure
housing the guild is constructed of pure white marble. It almost
seems to gleam with a holy light. As you walk down the long hall
to the guild, be sure to consider the immense amount of work that
went into the creation of this structure. You can't be the best
miners and stoneworkers in all Norrath without having something
to show for it!</strong></p>

<p><strong>After returning to the RATO and the Mine cap, you can
go down the other passage. This leads to a small cluster of
shops, not the least of which is Trantor Everhott's Forge,
considered by all to be the home of the finest weaponsmiths on
all Norrath. We Dwarves can not claim to know the first thing
magic use, but no one can match a Dwarf when it comes to creating
a fine blade with a keen edge. Across the way from Everhott's is
the tunnel to Greybloom Farms, producer of some of the most
succulent mushrooms you could ever taste. Truffles are a
specialty. The other passage leads back to South Kaladim,
emerging near Stormhammer Keep.</strong></p>
