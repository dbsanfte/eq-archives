<p><font size=5><strong>Enigmatic, admired, reviled, misunderstood</strong></font><strong><br>
</strong><em><strong>The Montreal Gazette, March 28, 1994</strong></em><strong><br>
<br>
If you stood outside the Comedy Corner last week, you would have heard familiar 
sounds. Shock comic Bill Hicks was holding court, spewing his outraged thoughts 
about pro-lifers, anti-smokers, Christian fundamentalists, self-satisfied politicians 
and, of course, Californians. <br>
<br>
Waves of laughter and applause greeted his well-honed rant. <br>
<br>
But the gathering was a memorial. Hicks was on videotape. On Feb. 26, he died of 
pancreatic cancer just as his comedic talent was getting national and international 
recognition. <br>
<br>
Born in Georgia, but raised in Houston since the age of 7, this self-described &quot;Prince 
of Darkness&quot; was compelled to use the comedy stage as his philosophic soapbox. <br>
<br>
At 13, he would sneak out of his suburban house to hustle his way onto open-mike 
night rosters. In two brief decades, Hicks worked his way up the sweat-stained 
comedy ladder to national exposure on The Tonight Show, Late Show with David 
Letterman and an HBO cable special. Rolling Stone named him the &quot;hot stand-up&quot; 
of 1993. He was the hit of the 1990 and 1991 Just for Laughs comedy festivals in 
Montreal. <br>
<br>
Dead at 32, the enigmatic Hicks was admired, reviled and misunderstood. <br>
<br>
He performed at the Comedy Corner in his adopted hometown of West Palm Beach 
dozens of times over the past five years. During that period, he developed an avid 
following, as well as encountering others who walked out on his act in disgust. <br>
<br>
&quot;We actually would take bets to see how many people would leave,&quot; said former club 
emcee Linda Dion. &quot;He was very in your face, very aggressive. People would walk 
out because they couldn't tolerate that kind of material, or that kind of delivery. If 
your views didn't jibe with his, you're going to have a problem listening to him.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;During the Rodney King trial, I was waiting for one of those anchormen to just 
come on and say those cops were just racist pigs. They'd have the cops on saying 
that the video is all in the way you look at it. Sure. If you ran it backwards, it'd look 
like they were just helping him back into his car.&quot; <br>
<br>
Those who only saw Hicks onstage - where he dressed in black and started some 
shows by saying &quot;Welcome to the comedy of hate&quot; - assumed he was boiling over 
with anger. Not so, said Comedy Corner booking co-ordinator and Hicks' co-manager 
Colleen McGarr. <br>
<br>
&quot;I wouldn't say he was fuelled with rage as much as with passion,&quot; she explained. 
&quot;He felt strongly about things, about the truth. He was a real great thinker who had 
the heart of a poet, basically.&quot; <br>
<br>
Well, a poet who liked to joke about our collective murder fantasies. Hicks went on 
the Oct. 1 Letterman show talking about a new half-hour weekly series he would soon 
host called Let's Hunt and Kill Billy Ray Cyrus. &quot;Each week we let the hounds of 
hell loose and we chase that jarhead, no-talent all over the globe,&quot; Hicks said to the 
audible approval of the studio audience. &quot;And we'll be back with a sequel, Let's Hunt 
and Kill Michael Bolton.&quot; <br>
<br>
But only the studio audience saw what would have been Hicks' 12th appearance with 
Letterman. <br>
<br>
The segment was deemed to have &quot;too many hot spots,&quot; including jokes about 
anti-abortion activists, homosexuals and religion. When the show aired, Hicks was 
nowhere to be seen, igniting a media circus over censorship that turned the spotlight 
on the bad boy comedian. The Letterman flap prompted The New Yorker to publish a 
major, laudatory profile of Hicks that had previously been on hold. <br>
<br>
But America wasn't Hicks' most popular gig. Here, he played small clubs. In 
England, however, he was revered as a social commentator and performed in 
2,000-seat theaters. To McGarr, the difference is the Brits' attitude toward 
language. <br>
<br>
&quot;With their longstanding literary traditions, they just seem to have more of an 
openness towards people who talk in terms of irony and satire,&quot; she said. &quot;Here, 
they miss what's being said in exchange for how it's being said.&quot; <br>
<br>
In 1990, in his first appearance at the sprawling Edinburgh Festival in Scotland, 
Hicks caused a sensation and walked off with the event's Critics Award. He began to 
write a regular monthly column for the British humor magazine Scallywag, filling it 
with his fevered musings and lines from his stand-up act. (&quot;If the FBI's motivating 
factor for busting down the Koresh compound was child abuse, how come we never 
see Bradley tanks smashing into Catholic churches?&quot;) This year, he was supposed to 
launch a new offbeat London television series of his comic observations, The Counts 
of the Netherworld. <br>
<br>
When he died, the major British press sang Hicks' praises in ways the American 
media did not. The Guardian eulogized him as &quot;one of the most daring American 
stand-up comedians of his generation.&quot; Time Out said of his brand of comedy, 
&quot;Although it rarely made comfortable listening, the result was almost always very 
funny.&quot; <br>
<br>
Hicks was a misfit in America, as well as a misfit in his strict, but loving Texas 
family. As a boy, he itched to get out of Houston and get on with his mission of 
making people laugh and think. His parents, a General Motors middle manager and 
a housewife, were simply puzzled by a boy who yearned to be a comedian. <br>
<br>
&quot;They didn't understand what being a comedian meant,&quot; said Hicks' older brother, 
Steve. &quot;Picture two conservative Southern Baptist people trying to get a handle on 
his material. What he was actually doing was extremely hard for them to grasp. 
Although the support and the love was always unconditional.&quot; <br>
<br>
Typical of their effort to understand their son's world was the time in 1982 when 
Hicks' parents decided to bite the bullet and actually attend a performance. It was 
after a Thanksgiving family gathering at Steve's home in Dallas, which Bill left early 
to fulfill a club date in Austin, three hours away. His parents followed later, not telling 
Bill they would be in the audience. <br>
<br>
They planned to drive back to Dallas after the show, but, said Steve Hicks, &quot;they 
were so shocked at what it was he was doing that they got in their car and drove all 
the way back to Little Rock,&quot; their home, a nine-hour trip. &quot;And not saying a word to 
each other all the way.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I have something to tell you nonsmokers. Nonsmokers die every day. You know 
what doctors say, 'If only you smoked, we'd have the technology to help you.' It's 
people dying from nothing that are screwed.&quot; <br>
<br>
In June of last year, Hicks felt sharp abdominal pains and was persuaded to visit a 
doctor. To Dr. William T. Donovan of the Good Samaritan Cancer Institute, it 
seemed to be a gall bladder attack, until a scan detected traces of cancer. After a 
biopsy, the fatal diagnosis was definite. <br>
<br>
&quot;I told Bill this flat out - there was nobody else to tell - and it was as if somebody had 
shot him,&quot; Donovan said. &quot;Because he was a bright person and he knew what cancer 
of the pancreas meant.&quot; After just a few days in the hospital, having been handed a 
virtual death sentence, Hicks checked out and played the Comedy Corner the next 
night. &quot;Very few people, I think, would have the guts to do that,&quot; Donovan added. <br>
<br>
He placed Hicks on a weekly schedule of chemotherapy treatments, setting up a 
network of oncologists for him to see as he continued to travel the country working 
the clubs. <br>
<br>
Donovan knew what his young patient did for a living, but he never saw any signs of 
the foul-mouthed angry performer in his office. &quot;I used to kid him about whether he 
really was a comedian or not,&quot; the doctor said. Hicks did not quip his way through 
chemo, but &quot;on the other hand, he was not a heavy. He was never one with his chin 
dragging on the floor. <br>
<br>
&quot;Anger was not in his make-up at all,&quot; Donovan felt. &quot;You expect, and see quite 
often, anger toward the disease or anger toward the doctor who tells him he has a 
disease. Anger toward treatment. He exhibited none of that. He's just a very gentle 
person.&quot; <br>
<br>
Optimism began to brim from Hicks. He eschewed his black wardrobe and began to 
wear lighter colors. He knew he was going to lick the cancer, and for a brief time, his 
tumors inexplicably decreased in size. &quot;Bill's attitude was beyond belief. It was 
tremendous,&quot; McGarr said. <br>
<br>
But by December, the signs of physical deterioration were evident. &quot;He didn't have 
to say anything,&quot; noted former emcee Dion. &quot;When I saw the rapid weight loss on 
him, I knew there was something really wrong.&quot; <br>
<br>
In his final days, Hicks went to his parents' home in Little Rock, understanding that 
no miracle remission was in his cards. His brother, Steve, emphasized that it was not 
a matter of reconciling with his folks, for even in their disappointment over Hicks' 
comedy, the lines of communication always remained open. <br>
<br>
According to McGarr, in those last days of his life, Hicks' attitude remained positive. 
&quot;He was getting a lot more light- hearted, because he felt really good,&quot; she said. 
&quot;He felt a new kind of happiness. He was in a middle of writing a book, in fact, called 
New Happiness,&quot; full of his philosophy and a previously unexpressed optimism. <br>
<br>
Whether or not it ever sees publication, there is plenty of Hicks' work still to come. 
He had been taping two new CDs of his excoriating words and his own original music. 
There are concert videos likely to be released. He wrote two slyly comic screenplays 
which are receiving interest in Hollywood. <br>
<br>
&quot;I think his career is, in a sense, just begun,&quot; said comic Tom Ryan, who often 
opened for Hicks. &quot;I think the 25th anniversary Bill Hicks tribute might have to be 
done at the Miami Arena, y'know what I mean?&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
On religion: &quot;I think it's interesting how people act on their beliefs. A lot of 
Christians, for instance, wear crosses around their necks. Nice sentiment. But do you 
think when Jesus comes back, he's really going to want to look at a cross? Ow! 
Maybe that's why he hasn't shown up.&quot; <br>
<br>
On pro-lifers: &quot;You know what bugs me about them? If you're so pro-life, do me a 
favor - don't lock arms and block medical clinics. If you're so pro-life, lock arms and 
block cemeteries. I want to see pro-lifers at funerals opening caskets, saying, 'Get 
out!'&quot; <br>
<br>
On cigarette warning labels: &quot;Mine says, 'Warning: Smoking may cause fetal injury 
or premature birth.' Found my brand! Just don't get the ones that say lung cancer. 
Shop around. 'Gimme a carton of low birth weight.'&quot; <br>
<br>
On rock and drugs: &quot;Man, the Beatles were so high, they let Ringo sing a couple of 
tunes. 'We all live in a yellow submarine ... ' Tell me they weren't partying.&quot; <br>
<br>
On pornography: &quot;I don't understand what pornography is. To me, pornography is 
spending all your money and not educating the people of America and spending it 
instead on weapons. That's pornography to me. That's totally filthy.&quot; <br>
