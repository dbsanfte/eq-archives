Without going into a lot of historical detail, I recommend you plan an outing here one day and explore the interesting 'hidden chambers' on the third floor of the castle. Also on the third floor is where the royal family resides -- you can find Carson McCabe, his Erudite wife Lady McCabe, and also Carson's not-so-secret paramour, Mistress Anna. Occasionally Princess Lenya also appears upstairs, though she isn't in the main section of the floor with the others; she, too, is in the hidden chambers. Do not confuse her with the illustrious 'Princess Lenia' in the jails of the Highkeep basement. That princess is a phony.<br><br>Whatever mystery surrounds the royal family, it has not yet been fully discovered.

(Can't unlock it, sorry!) Excuse the difficulty you might have reading this map; size limitations on this site don't allow me to further enlarge it. Basically though, the yellow bar denotes where you start up the stairs from the second floor. The white bars show where hidden entrances are located behind paintings covering up false walls (the uppermost one is a door hidden within a wall which must be approached and clicked upon to open it). And the green shows the outline of the floorplan of the entire floor.
