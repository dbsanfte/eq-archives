<center><b><font size=5>INTRODUCTION</font></b></center><br><br>
<p><font size=4>In my opininion, Verant has achieved with the spellcasting classes in EverQuest, what Origin failed to in Ultima Online.  This, stated plainly, is to provide the player with the ability to create a formidable spellcaster without the need for extensive melee skills and plate armor.  In EverQuest a pure spellcaster is just as powerful and effective with magery as a pure warrior is with his weapons and armor. Although the strategy and approach of a spellcaster will differ from a tank's the end result will be the same, a dead monster to loot. This achievement, coupled with the real and effective choice to pvp or not, makes the game extremely enjoyable for me. Of course, a pure spellcaster's success in combat will be largely dependent on his/her ability to avoid melee with the oponent. Pure spellcasters are very weak in melee and should avoid it at all costs in the higher levels.<br><br>  With respect to pvp (player vs player mode), I may add that EverQuest provides an exclusively pvp server for those players who prefer to kill and loot eachother a la Ultima Online.  I have personally observed that the pvp server usually shows significanly less players online as the regular (non pvp) servers.  This says more to me about player preferences than any bulletin board discussion.  Additionally, players in every server may choose to pvp by completing a simple quest.  However, pvp players within the server cannot engage others into that playing style unless they expressly choose to do so.  Pvp player names appear in Red and their numbers are few and far between within the regular servers.  In summary, you will not be distracted from your adventuring goals by pkillers, bank thieves, kill thieves, and looters unless you expressly choose that playing style for your character.  I have noted that the end result tends to be a mature, friendly, and cooperative approach to the game by most players online.  Its a pleasure to play in such an environment.<br><br>


As LadyMage, I could not resist to pick the Wizard class for my main character in Norrath. I played a Wizard in Phase 4 Beta and loved it so much that I decided to stay with that class throughout my Norran travels.  Its not an easy class by all means.  As in most RPG's, spellcasters get off to a slow start and then blossom into formidable forces to contend with.<br><br>

The game developers consider a character to have advanced beyond newbie status once they reach level 10.  Consequently, this page will provide information on how to advance your wizard character to level 10 and beyond.  The information is drawn from my own experiences in Norrath.  (Although delivered from a High Elf Wizard perspective, I am certain that you may derive some benefit from reading through this section regardless of your chosen character class.)<br><br>
<center><b>CREATING YOUR CHARACTER</center></b> <br><br>
The Wizard's primary statistics are Intelligence and Agility.  When you are in the Character Creation screen you will be given 30 points to distribute among the various character skills.  Don't be tempted to allocate points to Strength, Charisma, etc., use these 30 points exclusively for enhancing Intelligence and Agility.  Allocating them to other skills will be a waste of resources since, allocating them to strength for example, will NOT enhance your melee ability, WILL still leave you a poor fighter AND compromise your effectiveness as a wizard because you just impaired your character's ability to generate mana to cast spells with forever.  I started a High Elf Wizard and allocated all possible points to Intelligence and the balance to Agility. (127 pts Int and 85 Agility for a High Elf)  If you choose to be an Erudite, for example, your intelligence would be much higher, making you an even more powerful wizard.<br><br>  Although tempted, I chose a High Elf because as an Erudite I would have been required to start in the continent of Odus, which is very isolated from the rest of the Norrath population. Consequently, I would have had to wait much longer to mix in with the rest of the crowd.  As a High Elf, I had the advantage of starting in Felwithe and immediately interacting with wood elves, gnomes and dwarves.  Further, getting to Freeport, in the continent of Antonica, is not an unsurmountable task from the city of Felwithe.  However, this consideration is just a matter of preference.<br><br>

Once you distribute your points and give your character a name, you will be taken to the deity screen.  Here you will select the deity that you will invoke for the protection and well being of your character.  For me it was a tough choice between Solusek Ro, the Wizard Lord of Fire, and Tunare, the mother of all elves.  Solusek won:)  Next you are given a choice of starting city.  As a High Elf my choice was limited to Felwithe.  (However, this limitation changes among the races, for example, due to their Human/Elven nature, Half Elves are given the choice among the human and elven cities.)<br><br>

The final screen informs you of the level of difficulty for your chosen race/class/deity combination and checks your chosen name for acceptability.  If the system does not like your name, your character is rejected and you are brought to the starting Character Creation screen.  There may be various reasons for the rejection of your character name.  If your character is rejected, try again with a different name, or alter the spelling a bit.  Make sure you recheck all your choices INCLUDING YOUR BONUS POINT DISTRIBUTION, to make sure that you don't create a character that lacks the maximum stat enhancement possible.  I have a friend who had to start her character over after reaching 8th level because she forgot to distribute her points.  I would have done the same in her case because the oversight would have hurt tremendously at higher levels.<br><br>

<center><b>ENTERING NORRATH</center></b> <br><br>

So, you distributed your bonus points, chose your deity, starting city and your name was finally accepted.  Your character has been created.  Its name shows on the character bar and you press the button to enter Norrath.

If you started in Felwithe, you will be in the middle of the city, in a safe, guarded area.  Click the persona button and you will see that you carry a dagger, and have 5 food and 5 drink rations.  You also have two spell scrolls, a quest directive and a book.  The book gives you the quest for pvp.  I destroyed mine immediately.  Others, deposit it in the bank so they can decide later whether or not they will turn pvp.  The first thing to do is to drag the dagger to the picture of your character on the top right hand of your screen so that it will equip automatically.  Click on the "done" button to bring yourself back to the main screen.  Click the "spell button" to open your spellbook.  Your book will look like a blank old fashioned photo album.  Drag one of the scrolls and drop it in one of the... "let's call them picture frames".  A red bar will slowly start emptying and you will get a message saying "inscribing shock of frost". Wait and do nothing until you receive the message "you have finished inscribing the spell 'shock of frost'. The spell icon will now appear on the picture frame in the spellbook. The message will appear when the red bar is empty.  Drag the second scroll to a different picture frame and wait again.  Now that your spells are inscribed, if you die you will never, ever lose them. So, this procedure is very very important.<br><br>

Now, click on the yellow shield spell and you will get a button.  Drag the button to the top horseshoe shaped space on the border of the left hand side of your screen.  (I had trouble finding this) They form the border between your view screen and the vertical menu bar on the left.  Drop the button there, and the red bar on the left will now be emptying.  Wait and do nothing until you  get the message "finished memorizing minor shielding spell".  Do the same with the Shock of frost spell and use the next horseshoe looking space.  Click the done button and click on the shield spell.  You are now casting.  You may either cast it successfully or it may fizzle.  Keep trying until you cast it.  You will get a message saying you feel armored.  You have cast your first spell.:)  Note:  When you die, (and I say WHEN because you WILL die quite a few times), you will be returned to your home city gate.  Find a quiet safe place and repeat the memorizing procedure I just described.  Although you INSCRIBE each spell to your spellbook only once, each time you die, you will have to MEMORIZE your favorite spells again.  Don't forget to memorize every time you die, because you cannot cast unless you have your spells memorized. When an orc attacks you, you just can't tell him to hold on for a second because you have to sit and memorize your spells.  That, my friend, just won't work.  YOU HAVE TO BE READY!!!<br><br>
<center><b>STARTING YOUR NEW LIFE AS A NORRATH RESIDENT</center></b> <br><br>

You are now ready to start your life in Norrath.  Take the note that you have on you to the wizard guild (or Enchanter guild if you are an Enchanter, etc.)  Once you find the person named on your note, (Tarker if you are a wizard in Felwithe), click on the npc to highlight his name in red on your targeting space,  just above the button column on the right hand of your screen.  Click the persona button grab the note and right click it on the NPC.  Give the note to him.  You will get experience and your Junior Apprentice Robe free of charge.  (Since you can't wear armor, the robe offers some protection so wear it.  If you happen to lose it, it might be worth your while to buy another.)  Right click on him again and you will be able to use your five training points.  (You get 5 training points each time you level)
Here is how I recommend you use them.  2 points to piercing skill, 1 point to channeling, 1 to abjuration and 1 to evocation.
When you get to level 2 use one point for each of the other 3 magic user skills, divination, conjuration, etc. and use one point each for swimming and fishing. At level 3, use one point for sense heading, and allocate the rest to the mage skills.  At Level 4 ONE POINT TO MEDITATION IS A MUST. The rest to may be allocated to those mage skills you are least efficient in.  Once you reach Level 5, save your training points for the higher levels.  These will come in handy at level 16, when you will need points for Research, and at level 20, when you will need some for specialization, etc.  Regular casting will raise your mage skills without having to train and fishing will improve fishing skill, etc.  At level 10, you may want to use some training points on other languages besides common tongue and elvish.  You will need to know languages for spell research later on.  You may want to assign a seed point or two to jewelry making, tailoring, fletching and/or smithing, if you feel you would like to develop those income producing skills.  By seed points I mean allocating just one point to a skill in order to get started.  For now, don't use your training points beyond level 5 or 6 because you don't really need to train since you are constantly improving your skills by casting spells, and the areas of  research, specialization and languages are more important and will require some training later on.  Leveling becomes harder as you gain experience and the corresponding training points will also be more difficult to attain.<br><br>

Now you are ready to venture forth into the wilderness but not too far!!!!  Limit yourself to the outskirts of the city until you reach level 3.  At level 3, you are allowed to travel between Felwithe and Kelethin.  (figuratively speaking:)At level one, kill only bats.  Making sure that your mana is full and your shield spell is active, target a bat, click the letter "a" to put auto attack on and cast shock of frost.  If the bat is within range of the spell it will come to you.  Keep casting until you kill it.  If your health is less than half, RUN to the guards and avoid getting killed.  Once you successfully kill a bat your experience will increase.  Loot it and when you can't carry anymore, go into the city and sell your loot.  Buy food.  Repeat.  At level two you can tackle wasp drones, rats and perhaps a decaying skeleton.  At Level 3 you can probably handle a widow spiderling.  At level 4 you probably can take on ONE and I mean ONE Orc Pawn.  At level 5, go hunt skunks at ButcherBlock.  You may even want to take a trip to Freeport and hunt fire beetles outside the city gates.  At levels 5 and 6, you should start participating in groups.  At Level 7, go to the Orc Centurion Camp on the outskirts of Kelethin, (Third Elevator Lift), and alternate between Orc Centurions and Dwarf Skeletons in ButcherBlock (in a group) until you get to Level 10.  By then, you will know where to go and what to do:)<br><br>

<center><b>INITIAL SPELL PURCHASE RECOMMENDATIONS</center></b> <br><br>

Spells are very expensive and initially you will be making just enough to buy food for yourself.  Invest in a fishing pole.  Buy some bait and fish.  This can supplement your income to buy spells initially.  While you are fishing, you may want to swim a little.  Developing your swimming skill may save your life from time to time.<br><br>

I recommend that the first spell you buy be Shere of Light.  Although you have InfraVision as a High Elf, the spell helps one see better and improves casting skills.  You may want to consider buying a level one fire spell also.<br><br>

At Level 4, buy Gate, Root, and Shock of Fire.<br><br>

Level 8 buy Fire Bolt, Lesser Shielding and Shadow Step and Shock of Ice.<br><br>

Level 12, needless to say Bind Affinity.  Other very useful spells would be Shock of Lightning, Resistant Skin, Firestorm, Halo of Light, and Frost Spiral.  By the time you reach level 16, you will know which spells to buy:)  Realise that by level 12 you will have to hunt around various cities to buy all the spells you need.<br><br>

As I play the game and level more, I will be adding more information to this page.  Until then, I hope you find this section helpful and may the elven mother,Tunare, bless you in your travels through Norrath:)Use the message board or guestbook and let me know how you are faring in our fair land.<br><br>
