Hail!

My name is Thaddeus and I am a lvl 11 DE Necro on Xegony. <br>  Well after
seeing all the broken quests for us necros, I have finally completed
one. <br>  You receive the quest from the necro on the top floor of lodge of
the dead.<br>   Anyway he gives you a letter naming several agents the are
employed by the guild.<br>   The one for this quest I used is Kizdean Gix in
west commons.<br>   I would urge anyone to be careful of traveling here until
higher level unless you know the area well. (lvl 8 at least, just my
opinion) <br>  You can find the NPC over by the 2 militia men posted by the
toll booth. <br>  Ask him if he has any messages for Neriak and he will give
you a letter addressed to one of the members in the lodge of the Dead.<br>  
Return the letter for a paltry reward (2 copper) but a nice faction
adjustment. <br>  I tried to go to highpass hold but there are about 4 orcs
all coned red tombstone to me at the entrance so be careful here.<br>   Hope
this helps any necros out.<br>
