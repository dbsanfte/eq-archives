For newer players to the PvP server, and those that really need a reality check<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Lesson 1: Honor<BR>
<BR>
Honor is not just keeping your word and your promises, it goes much deeper on PvP Servers. There are just some actions you do not do. In this session you will learn how to maintain your honor and <BR>
reputation. Your honor effects your reputation on the server, which is more important then any item or level. Once you have reached the lowest form of reputation, dubbed “Lamer”, your days on the server <BR>
are numbered.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Lesson 2: Bind Point Rushing<BR>
<BR>
We can sum this up to the title of “poor loser”, so you got ganked in an honorable fight, but you were smart enough to bind close. You turn around and nuke the guy who beat you without even looting your <BR>
corpse or leaving the zone.<BR>
<BR>
You just forfeited your right to your corpse, and took a major faction hit.<BR>
<BR>
Your faction with honorable players now sucks.<BR>
Your faction with lamers has gotten better.<BR>
<BR>
In EQPvP101, Lesson 2 you learned how to handle getting ganked, if you forgot please review. You do not attack someone naked while you are going to get your corpse. This is one of the lowest forms of <BR>
worms on the server, and you need to correct these actions before you end up as hated as hell levels or the changes to clerics.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Lesson 3: Corpse Camping<BR>
<BR>
We can sum this up to the title of “poor winner”, so you ganked someone in an honorable fight, but made the mistake of being an asshole and are going to distribute further grief onto another player of your <BR>
server. Players like you really belong on the blue servers where they are no longer a threat to society or themselves. If this is your idea of fun, you probably kicked the dog in lesson 4 of session 1 many times <BR>
just for the enjoyment of it, not to learn the reason behind it.<BR>
<BR>
You allow players to get their corpses at all times. There is no exception to this rule. For more about corpse camping and bind point rushing, review Loot and Scoot below.<BR>
<BR>
Ganking people at their corpse over and over, especially when they have every intention of looting and scooting is just wrong. To make it worse please add a few shouts of "Whose your Daddy" or "Suck it <BR>
Byaotch!" to give yourself the complete title of jack ass.<BR>
<BR>
Remember, what comes around goes around, especially on Tallon Zek. Lamers names get around to the honorable guilds fast, and your reputation will follow you around like white on rice.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Lesson 4: XP Killing and Choo Choo Train!<BR>
<BR>
We can sum this up to the title of “Major Asshole” and “Lamer Extreme”, these are the lowest form of life on the server, regardless of where they are on the food chain. An XP Killer usually is banished from <BR>
his own team and KOS to everyone else.<BR>
<BR>
If you believe that you have the right to cause another player multiple hours of hard work and dedication to their level and game, please delete your character and go to Asheron’s Call or Ultima Online.<BR>
If another player has committed this kind of crime against you or someone you know, kill him and ignore lesson 3. Even those with the highest honor will take justice into their own hands and put the hurt down <BR>
on someone who breaks this rule.<BR>
<BR>
Training to kill massive amounts of players with xp loss will never be forgotten and your faction is now scowls to most of the server. Players like these are the ones I can see hitting seals on the heads with <BR>
hammers.<BR>
<BR>
I will stay away from discussion about "is Fighting Fire with Fire when it comes to XP killing ok or not?" <BR>
<BR>
I think that this is a personal decision for each and everyone to make I personally will not XP kill anyone for any reason, even if it was done to me first, but believe me, I can understand those that retaliate. I <BR>
will reserve right to judge or not to judge anyone's actions after someone just cost them 20 hours of boring powerleveling because they were upset they were killed in a legit fight. That's the nice thing about <BR>
this server, we can all judge one another as we please, and take actions that we feel needed upon each other.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Lesson 5: Blah Blah Fucking Blah<BR>
<BR>
So you got ganked in a legit fight, and now you feel you have the right to tell the person who killed ya your entire life story.<BR>
<BR>
But I was low on mana! But I was low on health! Why did you kill me! Why did you attack me while I was sitting down and medding! But I was AFK! But I was talking! Jesus F’n Christ, I was bound 200 <BR>
zones away ASSHOLE and I gotta go to church in 15 minutes to lead a goddamn faith session! <BR>
<BR>
Now if you were XP killed, Corpse Camped, or Bind Point rushed, I can see a bit of this. But for a legitimate fight, you are way out of line.<BR>
<BR>
Doing this every kill is a great way to get to “Lamer” status in a hurry. Best review Session 1 Lesson 2 again.<BR>
<BR>
The opposite of "loser's story" is called "Smack"<BR>
<BR>
So you have 4 level 60 characters on Rallos Zek who have served 14, what did you call them? Tours of Duty? Ok 15 Tours of Duty on Rallos before coming to Tallon Zek to get out of the coin plus item <BR>
loot server. You have killed more lighties then lag? You don't say? I am lucky that you are 50 levels below me? Uh huh sure.<BR>
<BR>
Oh look, a level 5 newby is kicking your ass, how simply wonderful.<BR>
<BR>
Don't talk what you can't back, while this doesn't necessarily put you to lamer status real fast, it sure makes those of us who can fight laugh pretty hard when you fall down.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Lesson 6: Loot and Scoot<BR>
<BR>
Loot and Scoot is a deal. The deal is I let you have your corpse, you leave the zone. Don't want to leave the zone, ok you don't get your corpse.<BR>
<BR>
I will only go over this briefly because Session 1 Lesson 2 you learned how to keep your mouth shut and get your corpse.<BR>
<BR>
The argument always heard is “How long do I stay out of the zone?”<BR>
<BR>
My answer usually is “how bad did you get your ass kicked?”<BR>
<BR>
Normally I stay out of a zone for at least an hour, to the victors belong the spoils. <BR>
<BR>
Try to get out of the habit of going after the same camp over and over, because it will piss off those who already handed you your head on the three previous attempts.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Lesson 6.1: How to handle those who do not loot and scoot<BR>
<BR>
Step by Step Instructions on how to handle players who daunt loot and scoot. I will try to keep them very simple so everyone can understand.<BR>
<BR>
Pre-Req : Player must of already refused loot and scoot at least one time.<BR>
<BR>
1. He shows up to get his corpse, you let him loot. Remember Session 1, you always let people get their corpses.<BR>
<BR>
2d. (For DoTters) As soon as he stands up, you hit him with your largest DoT (Hopefully Fatal) and tell him he has about a minute to live so he best leave the zone while he still breathes.<BR>
<BR>
2w (For Warriors) He is free game to be attacked again, but for shits and giggles, only use your kick attack until a point he starts to fight back, or zones<BR>
<BR>
2p (For Pet Classes) Sick your pet on him, and enjoy the show! Countless hours of watching Beefcake chase down an inkie while he tries to shout to the zone things about your mother really takes the edge <BR>
off your bad day at work. <BR>
<BR>
2e (For Enchanters) Keep him mezzed for 45 minutes to an hour, explaining to him how he really needs to read Myndpyre's post on TZT, then give him another chance to leave.<BR>
<BR>
3. Fuggit, he has had enough time, just kill him and go to step 1 again. Rinse, Repeat. <BR>
<BR>
Remember how I said that you wouldn't get anything productive done, and fall behind on all of your goals? Well, this is one of those reasons why, but hey, at least you may enjoy this.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Lesson 7: Random PK’ing and Hunting Sessions<BR>
<BR>
Despite popular belief, those that do nothing but run around and kill peeps are NOT assholes. I know that this is hard to swallow, when you are sitting face down in the muck after someone kicked you ass <BR>
after you finished off a mob, and were low life and low health, and were drinking a beer, and were talking to your old lady, and your cat stepped on the keyboard, and, and, and, and STFU!<BR>
<BR>
You got beat! Waiting until you are low on mana and life is a tactic Waiting until you are not ready is a skill What you think this is, Galahad and the F'n Holy Grail? I gotta walk up to you with my glove and <BR>
smack you across the face? Wait for you to accept? Pistols at 10 paces you son of a warthog!<BR>
<BR>
Where the hell do you think you are? This is a PvP server, and I can hunt all day long and into the next day if I want because I came here to kill people Not my fault you came here because the population <BR>
was low The reason our population is low is because players like me hunt players like you as if they were weeds, pulling them one from one from the server to keep our garden fresh and not stinking of the <BR>
bluebie shit.<BR>
<BR>
This is blue server bullshit mentality creeping up on our beloved Zek. If you want duels, go back to a blue server I did ask you "Did you come here to duel people" in lesson 1?<BR>
<BR>
No I most certainly did not!<BR>
<BR>
I asked you "Did you come here to kill people" in lesson 1. Please review you @(*%_@#%*_@#%<BR>
<BR>
Ok, I can settle down now, breathe Mynd breathe, ok.<BR>
<BR>
Back to Topic, here we go, kill the blubies later.<BR>
<BR>
I have found this amazing phenomenon, which is so incredible I thought I would share it with everyone.<BR>
<BR>
Those that practice PvP actually are better at it then those who haven't practiced.<BR>
<BR>
NO WAY! Mynd, ya kiddin me man! You mean just because I stayed in High Keep until I was 44, then went to Karnors until I was 60 is the reason I cant beat most 52s? I thought level and equipment was <BR>
everything!<BR>
<BR>
Those that live the life of a player killer, and practice player killing, more often then not, are those that are walking away from the fight with the guys wallet in his hand, not the one sitting on his bind point <BR>
wondering if he should just go back to Friendly Marr<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Lesson 8: The Many Faces of Tallon Zek<BR>
<BR>
OK it's time to tell it how it is, and its time for every to open up their flame responses calling me everything but Erudite.<BR>
<BR>
What is Tallon Zek?<BR>
<BR>
Well, I am here to tell you, regardless of your beliefs in what our server is, here is the cold hard truth in black and white<BR>
<BR>
A) This is a PvP Server<BR>
<BR>
B) This is a 1 Team vs 3 Team PvP Server<BR>
<BR>
C) This is a 2 Team vs 2 Team PvP Server<BR>
<BR>
D) This is a 3 Team vs 1 Team PvP Server<BR>
<BR>
E) This is a 4 Team vs the World PvP Server<BR>
<BR>
F) This is a world vs you PvP Server<BR>
<BR>
G) This Server is whatever the player behind the screen so deems it to be at the time he is playing server<BR>
<BR>
This is not multiple choice, this is all of the above.<BR>
<BR>
You have the right to play your game however you want to play your game You want to play Gnomes vs the world? Hey great. You want to play Crossteamers vs the World. More power to you. You <BR>
want to play Good vs Evil, hey knock yourself out.<BR>
<BR>
If someone doesn't play the way you want to play, or the way you invision this server to be, then do something about it. Attack those players, put the hurt down on them. Don't bother trying to explain to <BR>
them how they are "Ruining The Server", or "Not playing how the game was intended" or "Forgetting the history and past of Tallon Zek" or "You are making my heart bleed", just do something about it. <BR>
Because depending on who you talk to, YOUR viewpoint is wrong too.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Lesson 9: The Right to Read PvP 154<BR>
<BR>
Before you get into the learning of actual tactics, please make sure you know how to have the right attitude, and knowledge of the honor and reputation systems. You should have done at least a dozen <BR>
random PK sessions or hunting sessions to have a grasp of the basic ideas behind EQ-PvP.<BR>
<BR>
Those that I don't want to Read PVP 154 are those that don’t follow PvP-101, PvP 102, and message board warriors who still believe that the pen is mightier then the Harm Touch. Those that talk smack <BR>
and never accomplish anything have no need for this knowledge.<BR>
