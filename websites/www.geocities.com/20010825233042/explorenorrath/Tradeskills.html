We have new areas to explore, quests to solve, and terrific items to get. Fortunately, Velious also gave us some new features, upgrades and much-needed fixes to the tradeskill aspect of the game. In an effort to mesh this roleplaying-based end of the game with the quirky focus of my site, I proudly give you my current project: an exploration of some of the very cool things now available in tradeskills. This category explores some of the neater things to do within the topic of tradeskills and hobbies, so not all will be listed nor elaborated upon. For anyone interested in tradeskills in general, or wanting a follow-up site to this page, two places to start researching are </span></font></b></i><a href="http://www.eqtraders.com"><b><i><font color="#990000" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:14">EQ Traders</span></font></b></i></a><b><i><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:14"> or </span></font></b></i><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/Skills/Skills.htm"><b><i><font color="#990000" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:14">Allakhazam</span></font></b></i></a><b><i><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:14">.</span></font></b></i><i><font face="Arial" size="-2"><span style="font-size:10"><br><br><br></span></font></i><i><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"><br></span></font></i><b><u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Fishing and Tackle-Making:</span></font></b></u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> Did you know there are more than 20 <br>types of zone-specific fish in the game? Not to mention some non-<br>icthyoid fishable items such as seaweed. And there are even quests implemented that force you to make use of this skill (such as a totem <br>quest from Cobalt Scars that requires said seaweed, and a quest in <br>Cabilis that requires a specific catfish). A great list of what can be caught during your free time in various zones can be found on </span></font><a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/location/fishing_zone.htm"><font color="#990000" face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">EQ Traders</span></font></a><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">. But the really neat thing you might want to try your hand at is tackle creation. Using components that are easily gatherable in any low-level zone, you can make some fairly amazing varieties of specialized bait. Now, to my knowledge, this bait does not currently have any advantages over vendor-purchased bait, but the uniqueness alone is worth the effort. To get started, visit brother island in Ocean of Tears (first stop on the boat from Butcherblock) and pick up a tacklebox kit and some standard lure components. Then, even with zero tailoring skill, you can kill spiderlings and combine two webs in a sewing kit to make each silk thread needed for the lures. After that, simply visit zone vendors or whack a few low-level mobs (rats, pixies, bats, etc.) to get your primary lure attachments. A fun list to check out the various types of bait that can be made, and recipes for each, can be found on </span></font><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/Skills/Fishing_Tackle_Recipes.html"><font color="#990000" face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Allakhazam</span></font></a><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">. Take a day off from stressful powerlevelling to make bait and go fishing, and see how enjoyable this universal skill can be!<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font><b><u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Baking:</span></font></b></u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> Looking for something a little more useful? Then the new<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; features of the baking tradeskill might make it the one for you. When<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the game first came out, baking was solely a role-player's skill; you<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; could make many types of foods, and they DID have the benefit of <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; often weighing less than vendor-purchased food items (a nice advantage for those of the monk class), but beyond that it was merely something for those with a bit of time on their hands. However, recently baking was upgraded to include several recipes for foods that, when eaten, give temporary stat or resist bonuses to the player. Granted, most of these foods are made from either racial meats or meats that are more difficult to procure (Velious wurms, wyverns, dragons), but for those looking for a unique and useful skill for all those formerly 'useless' looted meats, this definitely fills the bill. How about plus-3 to your strength and stamina stats? Try some pickled giant! Prefer boosting your resistance to poison and disease? Then munch a few Cobalt cupcakes! And now that players are able to right-click food and drink items to specifically consume them when they're ready, these stats are controllable by the player. Don't take a bite out of that hard-to-get dragon steak until you are READY for a plus-4 boost to all your stats. As you can see by the list given on EQ Traders </span></font><a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_baking.htm"><font color="#990000" face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Baking Recipes</span></font></a><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">, there are many combinations available, depending on what stats or resistances a player is looking for at any given time. A tip for anyone considering starting baking: the easiest and fastest way to do it is to set yourself up in East Commons at the merchant near the West Commons zone who sells batwings. Then buy stacks of wings from her, and stacks of frosting (from a vendor near the auction tunnel) to make Batwing Crunchies until skill level of 42. After that, Fish Rolls made from stacks of batwings and stacks of fish (buyable at the barbarian village in West Commons) will quickly get you to over 100 and in prime position to make these specialized munchies we're talking about. So start saving those meats you loot, and check out some interesting and handy cuisine-making!<br><br></span></font><b><u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Tinkering:</span></font></b></u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> Like alchemy and poison-making, tinkering in EQ is limi-<br>ted to select players who chose a specific race or class; gnomes are <br>the only players in the game with this particular racial ability. Tinker-<br>ing is the production of useful mechanically-oriented items, and all gnomes start out with a skill of 50 in the trade. This means that upon creation, they're able to produce such things as collapsible fishing poles, compasses, and fireworks at a skill level of 'trivial'. To gain increases in the skill, however, players must advance in experience to level 16. At the 16th season, the real fun begins! Wanting to check into tinkering more, I made a gnome warrior and levelled her up high enough to begin tinkering in earnest, because there were two things that caught my eye:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font><u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Undiscovered Recipes:</span></font></u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> The game is quite possibly full of them. It all<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; started out with Gimblestan, the father of thinkering. His diaries on<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the subject are the basis for the skill, and provide amusinging stories<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that relate various recipes. However, it appears that several volumes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are missing from the collection, and many players theorize that there<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are recipes yet to be discovered. In fact, two of the currently known <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tinkered recipes (powered gloves and, I believe, the catapult) are not<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; listed in any of these books and were instead discovered by enter-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prising players. Given the tremendous quantity of tinkering components<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; available, including a variety for which the current purpose is not<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; known (small and large power sources, force and frost modules, and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; numbered gizmos and sprockets, to name a few), I feel there are yet<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more such inventions to be discovered by players with the motivation<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and patience to try a hand at mechanical genius; for instance, because<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; many of the known items replace intell-caster spells (invisibility, glimpse,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; underwater breathing), I feel there is a flying/levition device awaiting<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discovery, and I'm currently experimenting with component combinations<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to that end.

Well if you have begun your interest in <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tinkering, and made a gnome warrior or cleric to experiment with, then<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; level 20 is all you need to proc some of the most cool armor in-game,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tinkered Watchman's armor. The silvery, gem-inlaid pieces of this set<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of gear are not easy to make (most have a trivial level of well over 200),<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but consider the effects on them, if you have some time on your hands:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font><u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Helm:</span></font></u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> See invisible<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font><u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Breastplate:</span></font></u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> Invisibility<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font><u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Greaves:</span></font></u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> Sow (tests show it's faster than jboots, even at level 20)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font><u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Vambraces:</span></font></u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> Stackable 40% haste buff<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font><u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Gauntlets:</span></font></u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> +30 strength buff<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font><u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Bracer:</span></font></u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> Summons 'wrench' (no-rent weapon)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font><u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Boots:</span></font></u><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> +30 dexterity buff.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, those crafty gnomes made two concessions for those who would<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attempt this armor: the pieces must be equipped to proc them, and the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; buffs are self-only.&nbsp; So if you are not at least a level 20 gnome warrior or<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cleric, you will never be one of the chosen few using this fabulous<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; armor. However, twinking to 20 is a small price to pay for the enjoyment,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so consider giving it a try! I've already crafted the greaves, bracer and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vambraces for my snazzy young gnome; screenshots, stats and related <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; text are found </span></font><a href="Watchman.html"><font color="#990000" face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">here</span></font></a><font face="Arial" size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">. A final note: Don't really have the time to reroll and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; twink, but want to get in on the tinkering action? Level to 16, cap skill, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and make the stuff. On my server and many others, it currently sells for<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20-25,000pp per piece of armor.
