<P>Although mIRC is not required, many guild meetings are held in it, so it would be beneficial if you also download it.</P>

<P><Center><Font Size=+2>While Playing EQ rules</Font></Center></P>

<P>Although there is no rule on which way you set your pk switch, all members are still expected to uphold a certain ideal of virtue and common sense in the way you control their vengeance...  <P>
<P><I>Explanation of the rule above:  don't go around looting, stealing, and pking. There is times when there is exceptions to these, but on most occasions, each person should be treated with what they deserve</I></P>

<P> Encourage all members to Roleplay with their character in EQ </P>

<P> Treat all members with respect, same thing applies to people you meet in the game</P>

<P>Guild colors and or clothing will be based upon on what the guild votes, depends on what guild options EQ has. (i.e. all of us have the symbol of a griffon on our chests, etc )</P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="pbsnake3.gif" HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=480></P></CENTER>

<P><Center><Font Size=+2>Alliances</Font></Center></P>
<P>All allies should be treated as if they were a member of KP themself, therefore the same rules apply... As for making an alliance, the guild leaders will do most of the talking and all the members can vote on whether or not we want a particular guild as an ally. Any problems with a current allies, whether it is a member of their guild doing something disagreeble or whatever, make sure that guild is aware of it ( both guilds ) so any problems can be resolved. </P>
<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="pbsnake3.gif" HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=480></P></CENTER>

<P>There is no set punishment for breaking guild rules, granted many rules may have exceptions, just remember think before you act. Each case is handled by itself and all members' input will be used as a deciding factor in the event a wrong doing of some sorts occurs.</P>
