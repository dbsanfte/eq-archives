    they be armor, weapons, jewelry, or other equipment, is an important part of building your
    character. With over twenty different body locations, configuring your character can
    involve a bit of customization. In each inventory slot an icon appears representing any
    one of hundreds of items that can be bought, found, or quested for, and changing many of
    the slots also alters the appearance of your character in the world itself. The following
    is a list of the various inventory locations, the types of items one might equip oneself
    with, as well as a shot of the inventory screen. Keep in mind that only mundane
    (non-magical) items are described, but rumors and legends abound, often describing rare
    and potent objects, even unique artifacts of great power. </small></td>
