</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P ALIGN="CENTER">Its Time to Leave Your Home of Neriak and Spread your Hate to the Light Dwellers.</P>
<P> </P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#800000"><P ALIGN="CENTER">Level 8:</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P>Making Level 8 May seem like a big step, But your increase is not that big as when you hit 4 or when you hit 12. Don't get me wrong a level 11 Necromancer will die against a Level 12 rather quickly. The Spells your receive In this Level are not Really Destructive or crippling (exp. Ward Undead but that's undead only). I Like to call this the Utility Level because most of your spells are just that. </P>
<P>Here are some Examples In order of Importance.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Bone Walk:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> A Big Upgrade in pets, Just as big as your first pet to your second. </P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Gather Shadows:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> Your Personal Cloaking device, This spell will allow you to travel through east commons with no trouble from the meddling guards. This is a must have when you decide your ready to befallen to avoid the trains.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Ward Undead:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> Also a must have for Befallen. This spell averages 38-40 Hp of damage to Undead Creatures. This spell alone will make you a strong force against the Undead.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Mend Bones:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> This spell is a heal spell for your pet. Just as useful as healing is to a cleric. This will heal your "Tank":) </P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Lesser Shielding:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> An Upgrade to your shielding line of spells. This spell is down near the bottom because if your doing stuff right your not the one taking the damage.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Dark Empathy:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> Allows you to heal anyone, Takes your hp's to heal though. A good spell to have anyway. Because you can heal a party member and drain back your Hp's from your target.</P>
<P> </P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Vampiric Embrace</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> and </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000">Impart Strength</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> are basically useless. For Vampiric Embrace to work you can't use a weapon: P. A Spell you want to get when you get the Money is </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000">Shadow Step</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> this works well for an escape spell.</P>
<P> </P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#800000"><P ALIGN="CENTER">Time to leave the Forest.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P> </P>
<P>At level 8 your going to have to leave the forest to get good experience. I recommend going to East Commons and attack the many Creatures. All Creatures in Commons have Varying Power levels so make sure you /con and take on the "evens" if Soloing with your pet. </P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808000"><P>**Orc </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080">Centurion</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808000">s, Orc Oracles, Dark Weed Snakes, Some Young Kodak's, Lions, Lioness, Pumas. Are Some Examples. **</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ff0000"><P>Level 8-10:</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Lions/Lioness's/Puma's:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> Puma's are found on the sands on the far end of east commons. They give good experience. You really don't make much money on them. Humans hunt them for there pelts to make patchwork armor, We are restricted to cloth. Lioness's are usually /con the same as pumas. Lions are the most difficult of the cats in East Commons. </P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Dark Weed Snakes</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080">: These snake Pack a good punch but you should be ok with your pet tanking. They give great experience, and carry Giant Snake Fangs (weapons).</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Orc Oracles:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> Magic Using Orcs cast shaman spells, kill these first, as they tend to heal the Centurion's. They also cast Drowsy, which slows your attack rate.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Orc Centurion:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> One on one these are easy to kill and you can make some good money. They usually attack in packs though and can be deadly. They usually are at the Orc Camps that are scattered about but you can find them walking alone.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ff0000"><P>Level 10-12:</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Young Kodak's:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> You should be able to take down some of the weaker Young Kodak's. I recommend hunting these in-groups though as they are tough and very social (love to gang up on you). </P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Asps:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> The Strongest of the snakes in East Commons.  Attack With Caution as there poison is strong.  They give Great Experience and Giant Snake Fangs (weapons).  One must consider the risks: P</P>
<P>Around Level 10 or so you may Consider Heading to Befallen in West Commonlands. To get they're just cross east commons. (On the other side of east commons away from Neriak)  Then Follow the Desert Line until you zone into West Commonlands. Continue to Huge the Lest side of the zone until you see a Cave in the Mountain and a green glow coming out of it. This is befallen.</P>
<P>Befallen Tips:</P>
<P>Alot of money and experience can be gained in here but also a quick death. </P>
<P>Keep Invisible to undead on all the time and watch for trains. </P>
<P>Consider grouping until your comfortable by yourself (w/pet). </P>
<P>Ward Undead is your Friend Does Alot of damage too undead. </P>
<P>Try and stick by the Zone out of Befallen if you get into trouble you can leave.</P>
<P> </P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#800000"><P ALIGN="CENTER">I'm Leveling slowly is that Normal?</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P ALIGN="CENTER"> </P>
<P>For the most part yes. Your sharing Experience with your pet so make sure your attacking at least "Even Fight" to you. You may even Consider taking on some cats by yourself (without your pet) until you get your next level. </P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#800000"><P ALIGN="CENTER">General Tips For Level's 8-12.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#800000"><P ALIGN="CENTER"> </P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Money:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> As Always, Save your money. Your spells only get more expensive and you won't start making more then enough until 20 or so. </P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Pet Weapons:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> You can give your pet any weapon you feel like. Your pet is much stronger and will not die unless faced with overwhelming odds (2 Kodak's will shred your pet). Try not to zone too much or you lose your pet and his weapon.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Sacrificial Pets:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> This still works of course, usually this happens in befallen. Its been known to happen in commons when faced with multi enemy's</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>PvP: </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080">This is a good level to start thinking about attacking those Light Dwellers. I wouldn't recommend it if your not on the PvP server, because its bugged on the other servers. (Non-PvP can't Heal PvP and vice versa.)</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Skeletons: </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080">It seems that EQ put in the game that if you kill too many of these that your faction goes down with your guild. I never see a message for the faction hit. If this is true you may want to skip befallen.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808000"><P>**Kill Plenty of Orcs, Because it raises your faction with the Residents of the Commonlands. **</P></FONT></BODY>
