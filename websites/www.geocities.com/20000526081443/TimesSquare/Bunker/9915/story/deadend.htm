<p><b>I hesitantly entered befallen for the first time,not sure of what to expect. 
  Before me was a fairly large chamber with four doors. The scene was rather errie 
  being that i was the only one in that area at the time. Curiosity won out over 
  my fear and i headed for the first door, weapons drawn. In the rooms beyond 
  i was greeted by a host of undead creatures. After slaying a few skellies,i 
  stumbled into a dark elf. I quietly moved in behind him, the poor fello never 
  had a chance.I left the key for someone who might need it. Shortly there after, 
  a party showed up and starting looking for another member. I will not mention 
  their names,so there is no more hard feelings between them and i.</b></p>
<p><b> I aproached, introduced myself,and offerd my services. They immediately 
  asked what my skills were. As soon as the word ROGUE left my lips, i was thrown 
  out of the party and thrown a few insults. I asked them what their problem was 
  and they gave me the bla bla bla about how they dont trust me and that ill steal 
  all their loot. Insults were traded and they went on their way with another 
  fella they picked up. After a while i gathered up the courage to go deeper into 
  befallen. I picked the locked door and descended into darkness.... </b></p>
<p><b>At first, i explored the area to get a feel for it. Hearing sounds of battle 
  i carefully approached, that party i had run into was fighting for their lives. 
  Obviously outnumbered, and there were already two of them down. I immediately 
  left the area and when to the locked door at the bottom of a broken staircase. 
  I picked the lock just as i heard one of them yell "RUN". i stood in the open 
  doorway and waited. Just as i came into their sight, i laughed and closed the 
  door. In that last moment of terror,mixed in with all the screams for help, 
  i distinctly heard one of them say " we should have invited the rogue". I do 
  believe those were his final words.</b></p>
