  <h1>The Twelve Steps of Everquest Anonymous</h1>
  <p align="left"> <b>1. We admitted we were powerless over EverQuest - that our 
    lives had become unmanageable.</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b> 2. Came to believe that a Power (or game manufacturer) greater 
    than ourselves could restore us to sanity.</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b> 3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives and our 
    money over to the care of The Power as we understood Him.</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b> 4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of our 
    characters. </b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>5. Admitted to our guild leader, to ourselves and to another 
    being the exact nature of our combats.</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b> 6. Were entirely ready to have The Power remove all these 
    defects of character</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>. 7. Humbly asked Him to remove our missed attacks.</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b> 8. Made a list of all persons we had let escape, and became 
    willing to hunt them down and kill them all.</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b> 9. Made direct threats to such people wherever possible, 
    except when to do so would injure us or others in our party.</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b> 10. Continued to take character inventory and when we wanted 
    something we camped for it.</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b> 11. Sought through chat and meditation to improve our conscious 
    contact with The Power as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of 
    His will for us and the power to carry that out. </b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these 
    steps, we tried to carry this message to gamers and to practice these principles 
    in all our quests. </b></p>
