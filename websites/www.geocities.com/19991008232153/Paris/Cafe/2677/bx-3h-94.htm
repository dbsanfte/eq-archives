<p><font size=6><strong>Exposing lies with a laugh </strong></font><strong><br>
</strong><em><strong>The Guardian , March 9, 1994 </strong></em><strong><br>
<br>
Bill Hicks, one of the most daring American stand-up comedians of his generation, 
liked to ask the non-smokers in the audience to identify themselves, then puff away 
at them while inspecting his cigarette pack. &quot;What's cool is that every pack has a 
different Surgeon General's Warning, isn't that great? Mine says Warning - Smoking 
May Cause Foetal Injury Or Premature Birth. Found my brand! Just don't get the 
ones that say Lung Cancer - Shop around. Gimme a carton of Low Birth Weights!&quot; <br>
<br>
Last October, Hicks became the first perfomer since Elvis Presley to be banned from 
CBS's Ed Sullivan Theater where the David Letterman Show is in residence and 
where Hicks had made his 11th appearance. In an outraged 32-page letter Hicks 
wrote to me, he quoted Noam Chomsky: &quot; 'The responsibility of the intellectual is to 
tell the truth and expose lies'. While I do not consider myself an intellectual by any 
stretch of the imagination, his quote, coincidentally is the same way my parents 
taught me to live. So in honour of them, I'll continue doing what I'm doing, the best 
way I can. Then I'll see you all in heaven, where we can really share a great laugh 
together.&quot; <br>
<br>
The incident sparked a press furore and resurrected my New Yorker profile on him, 
giving his American career new voltage. &quot;It's almost as though I've been lifted out of 
a 10-year rut and placed in a position where the offers finally match my long-held, 
deeply cherished creative aspirations,&quot; he wrote last November. &quot;Somehow the 
possibilities (creatively) seem limitless.&quot; Even before Hicks wrote that, he knew of 
the pancreatic cancer from which he died, at 32. <br>
<br>
In his short and sensational life, Hicks found an audience for his brand of intellectual 
anarchy in Britain where he became something of a cult, winning the Critics' Award 
at the Edinburgh Festival in 1990 and touring Britain and Ireland twice in 1992 in his 
Dangerous Tour and Relentless Tour. <br>
<br>
Hicks was at home with the English, whose sense of irony made them more receptive 
than the credulous American public to whom he played as many as 265 days a year. 
A lanky, good-looking man, old beyond his years from hard living on the road, Hicks 
improvised his material with an audience. Hicks thought against society as he teased 
it: &quot;Ever notice how people who believe in creationism look really unevolved? Their 
eyes real close together. Eyebrow ridges. Big, furry hands and feet. 'I believe God 
created me in one day.' Looks like He rushed it.&quot; <br>
<br>
Hicks, who began writing comedy as an alienated 13-year-old, was oppressed by the 
soullessness of the Houston suburbs. He became so proficient and single-minded that 
his high-school English teacher allowed him a five-minute spot before the beginning 
of class. After graduating from high school, Hicks set off for Los Angeles to begin 
the long, volatile, comedy road. He leaves two memorable albums of the Relentless 
and Dangerous Tours, and a soon-to-be-released rant against California called 
Arizona Bay. The last words Hicks said to me were: &quot;I believe everyone has this 
f***in' poem in his heart&quot;. He spoke his maverick heart, and he was very, very 
funny. <br>
