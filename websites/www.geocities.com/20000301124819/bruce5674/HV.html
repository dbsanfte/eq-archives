<p><strong>This section of my guide has been put up as a courtesy
to other players who have been aided or wronged by other players.
Norrath is a world populated by warriors and mages, paladins and
rogues, and many others. Naturally, some people are going to
fight to make Norrath a better world, while others are only out
for themselves. This is a place to give voice to the names and
deeds of those who have helped or harmed you. Fame can be a
dual-edged sword though, as I well know (OOC: Holger, do you have
anything for a newbie??? PLEAAAAAASE?), so think well before you
submit someone. To have a person added to this page, send an
E-mail through </strong><a href="mailto:axelo@home.com"><strong>this
link</strong></a><strong> to me with the person's character's
name, your character's name, their deed(s), the server where the
deed took place, and anything else about the submitee. And if
they are to be a hero or villan! Note that I will put your name
and E-mail up here, and any false submissions will be removed.
Oh, and before I forget, if you send a picture, I will include it
with the post!</strong></p>

<p><strong>By Brell! I can't believe how many submissions I've
gotten since I advertised this site on Everlore and EQVault!
Trust me folks, advertising works! Thanks to you all for your
submissions, and keep 'em coming!</strong></p>

Permafrost Keep twice. He invised me several times and aided me
when our hot-headed group decided they could take the king room

helped me through the resultant train, and then even bought the
Zaharn's Coronet I had gotten at the time. Thanks for your help

selling him a Flowing Black Robe for only 17pp! Wish I had been
in his place &lt;g&gt;. Nanyan says that he believes that
Gililavyn did this because he cares about the people of Norrath,
even the newbies :) To quote him &quot;We need more big brothers

Tribunal. Weather merely giving advice about a zone or monsters,
giving a quick loan, or providing free teleports, this little guy

look for Follun Over!</strong></font></p>

Coyotes, this powerful ogre warrior saw a player in need and
helped him. Coyotes was trying to learn the fine art of smithing,
which is very expensive. While thus in training, he was unable to
buy armor or weapons for himself. While hunting Dervishes in the
Desert of Ro, Crushem joined the group which Coyotes was hunting
with. He took one look at Coyotes and simply said &quot;you need
better armor,&quot; then walked away. He came back bearing a
near-full suit of banded mail, which he gave to the amazed
barbarian Warrior, free of charge! It's philanthropy like this
that serves as a shining example to us all.</strong></font></p>

solo-pulling Spectres! He spent over 30 minutes helping young
Leedsen, all the time in danger of dying. Unfortunatly, they soon
found out that the weapon had been 'nerfed,' and had to give up.
It's good to see someone who cares enough about other people to
place themselves in danger to aid them. Even though they were
unable to get the Harpoon, it's the thought that really counts!</strong></font></p>

including chasing him from the arena and watching him die outside
from a DOT, which caused a loss of alot of experience, plus a
level. This happened 5 times. Roleplaying is a good part of EQ,
but this is both rude and obnoxious, to say the least. Some other
words come to mind, but I won't print them here.</strong></font></p>
