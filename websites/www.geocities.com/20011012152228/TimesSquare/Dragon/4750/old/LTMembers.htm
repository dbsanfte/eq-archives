<B><PRE>
  Aeryon appears to be a young half elf, but looking into his
eyes reveal an immeasurable age.  Often found outside the temple
of Erollisi Marr or by a fire in many of the Freeport taverns,
he sings or plays a haunting array of melodies.  And for those who
listen closely, eerie tales slip out - sounding like fancies of
a mythical land but ringing with the taint of truth.</PRE>

<PRE>
  Borne in the pits of gore in the depths of the troll lands swamps.
Borne under the rot green moon of <I>KunGoush</I> (Eve of bloodfeast) He was
called to the Lord Innoruuk on the night of his birth and followed
his voice through the blackness to life. He has the song of hate in
his head and seeks the power of his god to bring together the strength
of the trollish bloodline. To the time of <I>CrunChoom</I>, the time of the
great war against the light of good and to reclaim the lands and seas
for darkness and hate, where truth will spring and the strong and vile
will reign.
  He now searches for the means to bring Trollkin together in the
Great CRUNCHOOM!</PRE>

<B><PRE>
  A drawn-in face, hair black as night, skin pale as death.
Not much is known about this tall Barbaric Human, even by 
his own race. 
  Seeming to just, "appear", within the city of Halas, Snakes
has begun his training alone without friends or allies. 
  Upon entering the city of Halas, Snakes realized that there 
were many Deities within this plane of existence.  He searched 
for a tailor. Snakes had the tailor dye half of his face blue. 
A symbol that once again he has been cast into the unknown.
  There is far more within the past of this strong, proud man.
Tales that most only dream of.  Why has he suddenly appeared in 
this land? What are his motivations? Can anyone trust him? 
Seek for that which is missing...</PRE>
