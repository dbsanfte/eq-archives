<CENTER>Mage Characters 101</center><br>
<br>
<p>Unlike warriors and other classes where one starts out strong and able to make a decent showing against some basic nasties, a mage enters the world of UO as defenseless as a newborn babe.  Although through hard work and continuous practice that helpless newbie mage will become a powerful force to contend with, the character development process is slow and tedious.<br>
<br>
"But, how do I get from point A to Point B?  Its so hard."  Well the answer is yes it is hard but very doable.  Beta provided the opportunity to explore various professions and to get a sense of what the economy is like.  Because I am so magnanimous, I will share how several acquaintances and I became GrandMaster Mages in UO:)<br>
<br>
First of all, you have to really, really want to be a mage. You have to be willing to forego all the glory and financial security that warriors receive early on.  You are a mage.  You are a scholar, You are intelligent, and you recognize that you will be a late bloomer and be required to live a Spartan existence for a month or so.  As a mage, you have chosen long term goals over immediate gratification and acknowledge that your glory, although assured, will come later on. As the brilliant mage you are, you already know all this. So, I'm just reinforcing what you already know:)<br>
<br>
A mage must have a well sorted variety of reagents in healthy quantities at all times.  Your bag of reagents is your plate armor and your magic sword.  Unfortunately, reagents are not free.  As a matter of fact, they will eat up a considerable portion of your income.   Another large portion of your income will go toward filling up that spellbook with powerful spells.  Alas, spells cost gps too.  How will you finance these two major objectives?  You will finance them with a second job.  That is the secret of all those Grandmasters you see walking around.  They make money in various ethical and/or unethical ways to support the art of Magicka.  That, my friend, is what you also will do.<br>
<br>
Your Character<br>
<br>
All that having been said, lets begin with your character.  You have three stats to deal with while creating your character.  One question you may ask is how much to allocate to each, Strength, Dexterity, and Intelligence.  A warrior will want lots of strength and dexterity to fight his dragons with, but a mage needs intelligence most of all.  Strength comes second in the scheme of things, and dexterity last.<br>
<br>
When you are dealing with this section of the character creation screen give yourself as many strength points as you can and the balance to the intelligence stat.  ( I recommend approximately 35 Strength and 20 Intelligence.)  Forget about dexterity since it is not difficult to raise through the practice of most skills.  Chances are your dexterity will raise itself to a good level within a short period of time with little deliberate effort from you. Initially, you need intelligence to cast spells and enough strength to carry your reagents, your secondary trade tools and the merchandise you will buy and sell to make money.  Since Strength is the most difficult stat to raise and is essential to physical and economic survival in Britannia, I have favored that stat over intelligence for starting a character.  As you read on, you will learn ways to raise the intelligence stat to acceptable mage levels and how to continue improving it so that it compliments your future GrandMaster status:)<br>
<br>
The next issue is profession/skills.  It is mandatory that you choose magery as your primary skill.  I recommend the second skill to be inscription due to the beneficial effect it has on the intelligence stat when used regularly.  The third profession slot is reserved for your actual money making skill.  Although scribes can make a bundle in UO, right now you would starve as a scribe. Scribes make money by selling high level spells.  Reagents, scrolls and spells cost money, and money is the one commodity that you don't have at the beginning of the game. Consequently, your magery and inscription skills are for your future goals.  Your third profession/skill is what will make or break you in UO.<br>  
<br>
Give yourself 50 pts for magery.  35 to 40 pts to your "third" "moneymaking" profession and the balance to inscription or whatever secondary skill you have chosen.  If inscription is your secondary, you can train for it later on in the game when you have the cash to spare for the trainer.  For now, you are a mage. You will start the game with apprentice level skill, a spellbook, 3 First Circle scrolls, minimal reagents, 100 gps, and the tools for your secondary and terciary professions.  Which profession will your moneymaker be?<br>
<br>
<center>LadyMage's Third Profession Recommendations:</center><br>
<br>
1.  Blacksmith<br>
<br>
Start in Minoc, buy yourself a pick or a shovel and start mining.  (This is where that strength stat comes in handy) take your ore to the forge and turn it into ingots, start making armor and selling it to the smith or to players.  Ok, so you don't have mining skill.  That mining skill will develop all by itself each time you raise that pick or shovel.<br>  
<br>
You have an income producing profession.  If there is too much competition at the Minoc forge, move yourself to Skara or Jhelom and sell your ore, ingots and/or armor there.  These cities are just a moongate away.  Once you have 500 gps buy reagents and practice spells as outlined below.<br>
<br>
2.  Carpenter<br>
<br>
Start in Yew or Moonglow, buy yourself an axe and start chopping trees.  Make furniture and head to the carpenter to sell your wares.  Once you have 500 gps buy reagents and practice spells as outlined below.  If Moonglow gets too crowded, try changing your scenery a bit and move to Yew.<br>
<br>
3. Tinker<br>
<br>
Start in Jhelom buy yourself an axe and start chopping trees.  Make tinkering equipment and sell to the tinker.  Once you have 500 gps buy reagents and practice spells as outlined below.  If Jhelom gets too crowded, try changing your scenery a bit and move to Britain.<br>
 <br>
4.  Tailor<br>
<br>
Start in Jhelom or Moonglow.  Buy a tub, some dyes, a couple of sewing kits and 20 threads.  Use the thread on the loom to make 4 bolts of cloth.  Make skullcaps with two of the bolts you made and with the other two and the cloth you started the game with make half aprons.  (As you familiarize yourself further with the trade, you will be able to determine which items to make based on market conditions.)  Sell to the tailor and when the tailor can't buy anymore head to the provisioner and sell skullcaps to him.  Once you have 500 gps buy reagents and practice spells as outlined below.  If Jhelom and Moonglow get too crowded, try changing your scenery a bit and move to Skara or Britain.<br>
<br>
A note to tailors:  Never use up all your cash unless you have at least 20 threads available to make 4 bolts of cloth.  Never be without those 20 threads and you will never have financial hardships.  I never leave the tailor shop without those 20 emergency threads.  When I start a tailoring session I buy new thread and don't use my emergency stores of thread.  Trust me, you will thank me someday for this piece of advice.<br>
<br>
Starting in Britannia<br>
<br>
The moment you begin your character head to the provisioner.  Buy 
two backpacks and two bags.  Put the second backpack in your first backpack, the third backpack in your second and transfer everything, and I mean everything, into the third backpack.  Put all your reagents in one of the bags and put the bag in the third backpack.  The second bag will also go in your third backpack and it will be used to store the tools of your moneymaking profession.  Put your gold in your third backpack.  Once you are done, the only thing you should be able to see when you open your backpack is your second backpack and your spellbook. When you open the second backpack, all you should be able to see is your third. IMPORTANT:  Your spellbook belongs either equipped or in the first layer of your backpack.  NEVER place your spellbook deeper than in the initial first backpack.  It is only in that initial backpack or equipped that the spellbook is safe from thieves and guaranteed to go with you if you die.  Besides, you can't cast spells if it is anywhere else.  Failure to follow this rule may result in the loss of your hard earned spellbook so DO HEED THIS ADVICE.<br>
<br>
Britannia is thief infested.  Thieves cannot steal your PROPERLY POSITIONED spellbook or your backpacks, and unless they are Adept or Master Rogues, chances are they won't be able to look inside that third backpack.  Your second 500 gps should be deposited in a bank.  In the mainland there are banks in Britain, Ampath Abbey, Trinsic and Vesper.  Deposit as much as you can whenever you can.  If you get Pkilled, you will not be destitute.  Try to have a minimum of 1000 gps in the bank at all times.<br>
<br>
Final piece of advice.  Once you have gone up beyond apprentice level, DO NOT EVER RESURRECT IMMEDIATELY if you are killed.  The penalty in stats is just not worth it.  Play as a ghost and go to a healer for resurrection.  You have your nestegg at the bank, use it and replenish it. Bear in mind that when a mage dies, the spellbook goes with him/her.  The thieves and/or pkillers can't get your spellbook.  Since your book is secure within your ghostly existance, nothing in your backpack is worth the stat penalty. Play as a ghost.<br> 
<br> 
Casting<br>
<br>
As you may already be aware, casting offensive spells in town will immediately bring on the guards.  These will pulverize you into nothingness very quickly.  Consequently refrain from using offensive spells in town.  Go out of town to cast them.<br>
<br>
There are a few rules about casting that all practitioners should know.  In order to cast a spell, your spellbook must contain at least 4 spells in each circle below it.  For example, to cast the Third Circle Teleport spell , your spellbook must have at least 4 Second Circle and 4 First Circle spells in it.  Additionally, your magery skill should be in the 30s to cast in third circle with minimal failures, you must have enough intelligence to generate the mana necessary to cast the chosen spell and you must have successfully cast at least one spell in each circle below it.  In the case of Teleport, for example, you would have to successfully cast a first circle spell such as Reactive Armor and a second circle such as Strength, before attempting to cast Teleport as your FIRST attempt to cast in the Third Circle.  Once successfully cast, you now can practice Third Circle casting till your magery and intelligence are high enough to attempt the Fourth Circle, and so on.  Practicing casting will improve your magery skill and intelligence. I have listed below a collection of favorite practice spells.  These were very instrumental in getting me GrandMaster Mage status.  Because of their practice value, make sure these spells are in your shopping list.<br>
<br>
First Circle<br>
<br>
Reactive Armor,
Night Sight<br>
<br>
Second Circle<br>
<br>
Agility,
Protection,
Strength<br>
<br>
Third Circle<br>
<br>
Teleport<br>
<br>
Fourth Circle<br>
<br>
Wall of Stone,
Fire Field,
Recall, (make sure you leave town before casting the first two)<br>
<br>
Fifth Circle<br>
<br>
Summon Creature<br>
<br>
Sixth Circle<br>
<br>
Mark,
Paralyze Field (leave town for this one also), Invisibility<br>
<br>
Seventh Circle<br>
<br>
Gate,
Polymorph<br>
<br>
Eighth Circle<br>
<br>
All summoning spells, (Avoid casting Summon Daemon.  It will affect reputation negatively once the new reputation system is in place.<br>
<br>
When you summon, make sure that you never order the creature to attack or kill in town or you will die very quickly.  You may rename them and have them follow or guard.<br>
<br>
Intelligence<br>
<br>
Intelligence goes hand in hand with magery because the level of intelligence determines the amount of mana available to cast.  For example, You must have a minimum of 40 intelligence to generate enough mana to cast Gate Travel.  Your magery may be 99% but if your intelligence is 35, you will not be able to cast Gate naturally.  You may improve your intelligence temporarily by buying yourself a wizard hat from a mage shop.  (Provisioner/Tailor Wizard Hat stock is not magical)  The Wizard Hat will give your 5 extra intelligence points as long as you wear it but there will be a corresponding penalty to strength and dexterity.<br>
<br>
Spellcasting automatically boosts intelligence.  However, there are other ways to help that stat along.  Animal Lore is an excellent method.  Start using animal lore on every stray cat and dog you see. It will be difficult at first but after a while, you will feel a surge of new found understanding and perception penetrate you:).  The same is true of Intelligence Evaluation.  Go to a place where people congregate and start using intelligence evaluation on everyone you see.  You will be surprised at the improvement to your intellect.  Finally, get yourself some training and start inscribing.  Inscription also boosts intelligence quite nicely.  Although all the Lores and Spirit Speak are said to boost intelligence, I find that those I have mentioned previously have proven to be the most effective for me.<br>
<br>
Strength<br>
<br>
While you moonlight and your reagent bag gets heavier, you will notice that you tend to be overloaded with weight.  I told you the strength stat was important.  You will be flabbergasted to see that when you gain intelligence, sometimes your strength suffers point losses, and you can carry less and less.  The solution is practicing on the strength.  I recommend you buy yourself a mace or staff and head to Jhelom or Britain.  Start practicing on the dummies there.  Not only will your mace fighting skill go up, your strength and dexterity will go up too. As Strength goes up, you will be able to carry more so don't neglect this part of your training.  You can train up to 25 skill with the dummies.  After that you will need to buy and axe and cut wood for gaining strength.  Sell the wood to the carpenter or provisioner but you have to practice the strength so that eventually you'll be able to wear at least studded armor under your robes and be able to take a hit or two before you are forced to enter the Britannian Astral Plane.<br>
<br>
Traveling<br>
<br>
If you have read the travel section on this site you will note that I discuss the issue of pkillers ad nauseum.  Moongate travel is dangerous.  Consequently a mage should not travel the moongates once he/she has attained a level where recall or gate can be cast comfortably.  My advice is to buy a third bag and some recall runes.  Go to each city in Britannia and cast a mark on a rune there.  Keep the marked runes in the third bag in a consistent formation.  Keep a paper diagram of your runes by your computer desk.  You will now no longer have to risk life and limb to those lazy pkillers.  The vermin will no longer have access to your goodies. You can now travel first class with your recall runes.  As of this writing, runes may be marked in your backpack and you need not place them on the ground to cast on them.<br>
<br>
Here is another tip:  As soon as you are financially able to, make duplicates of all your marked runes, put them in a bag in the same formation that you keep them in and deposit the bag in the bank.  Buy another bag and put 5 of each reagent in it and also deposit it in the bank.  Buy duplicate money-making profession tools, put them in a bag and, you guessed it, deposit it in the bank.  Actually, it wouldn't be a bad idea to buy a second backpack, put all these duplicate supply bags in it, and deposit the whole thing in the bank:)  After visiting your local healer for ressurrection, all you would do is show up at the bank, grab  your backpack and you're ready to go.  No need to even deplete your savings.  After making all these preparations, if you ressurrect immediately after getting killed, you are beyond hope:(<br>
<br>
Final Note<br>
<br>
As I wander through Britannia, new players always ask me where they can get higher level spells.  They always tell me that the mage shops don't have anything beyond third or fourth level.  Higher level spells may be found in dungeons for free, or purchased from high level mages for a fee.  I have found that one of the best places to buy high level spells is Britain.  When you enter the city, head toward the mage shop to the north, the one just north of the healer.  Outside the shop, there are usually a few player scribes selling scrolls.  Ask one of them to inscribe a specific spell for you.  For a fee, you will get your summon daemon scroll.  Once you have it, open your spellbook and drop the scroll over it.  Voila! the intricate spell mysteriously appears in your spellbook. Another way is to check the various player placed vendors throughout Britannia.  Some sell only scrolls and potions.  Shop around for the best prices.<br>
<br>
Here is where the value of the inscription skill comes in.  Once you have a few decent 5th, 6th and 7th level spells, buy some blank scrolls and go stand in front of a mage shop.  You'll be surprised at how much money there is to be made in inscribing.  You'll make friends with the regulars there and every so often someone will need an invisibility or gate travel spell and have the cash to pay for it.  In the meantime, you will be improving your intelligence skill and getting paid for it:) Once you buy your house, invest in a vendor to sell scrolls.  If your location and inventory are right, you can make a bundle.  Vendor contracts are available from any inkeeper.  To place it, doubleclick on it while standing near a house that you own, preferably in a corner of the house.  The vendor will immediately appear and be ready to work for you.  Check the UO Strategy and Statistics (link on main page) site for more information on real estate, vendors, etc.<br>
<br>
I cant stress enough the importance of making duplicate keys of your home, when you buy real estate.  Make sure you buy tinkering skill or have a trusted friend to make the dups for you.  Keep these in the bank to protect you against key theft.  Always keep your keys a minimum of five layers deep in your backpack and if you carry a rune marked for home, make sure it is nowhere near the key and it is labelled something other than "home sweet home".  Preferably, never mark  your home rune very near your building and if your home is located in a remote, difficult to access area, by all means keep a dup rune in the bank.<br>
<br>
General Notes
<br>
Sometimes merchants will not buy your goods.  They will say they can't afford that right now.  The only thing to do is either go to another shop or town, or wait until the merchant recycles. Recycling should be about 60 minutes. Once recycling has taken place, grab the merchant and sell real quick before others get to him.  Remember its a dog eat dog world in Britannia:(<br>
<br>
OK, so now you know how to create your character and have an idea about how to get started.  You have read my travel tips and have an idea of what to expect in the wilderness and what each city has to offer.  You are ready to begin your residency in Britannia.  I have one more tip for you.  Log-in to the Test Center (TC) and start your dream character there.  Play on TC for a day or two.  Try those professions.  Find out if magery is really for you.  You may find out that you like wielding that viking sword a lot better.  Playing the TC will give you a feel for what the real shard you select will be like.  Try one of the Advancement Gates.  Find out what its like to be a Master Mage, Master Smith, Master Archer, Master Armsman, etc., instantly.   Perhaps smithing is a lot more fun than sewing.  Being a Master for a day will give you a feel for the advantages and limitations of the major professions.  I strongly urge you to try the TC for a few days.  Once you have decided, go start your character at a regular shard and begin  your life in Britannia.<br>
<br>
Follow the link to the Gate Traveler site in the main page and check the bulletin board to determine the location of the Advancement Gates on the TC at any given time.  This location varies as the TC is reset every couple of months.<br>
<br>
Don't neglect to review the Origin Site at "http://www.owo.com" for news and updates to the game.  As it is I've had to update this page several times due to changes in the game rendering some information obsolete.  The information in this section should be used as a general guideline only and should not be taken as "cast in stone" because the game is not.  The game is constantly evolving and the Art of Magicka will most likely evolve with it.
I hope you found this section helpful and feel free to e-mail me if I can be of further help.</p><br>
