</FONT><FONT COLOR="#808080"><P>This is a really cool real thing that happened to me last night while playing on the Rallos Zek (PvP) server.   Being Necro on this server is really fun because you get to pick off helpless humans with your pets ;) </P>
<P>Last night I finally got my Dark Elf Necro to Lvl 4, and so I went out and bought leering corpse and decided to join up with a few people to go kill some humans in Freeport. When we finally got to Freeport, my friends and I (3 in total) started pouncing on any equal Lvl or gamble Lvl humans we could find. We downed about 2 when they started shouting "DE's at the gate, let's get em!" Well at first their efforts were scattered and easily repelled, my friends and I easily dispatched the one or two people who would straggle over to our side of the desert and start messing with us. Eventually the high Lvl wizards came out of the wood works and started blasting us left and right. We all ran into the secret sewer system along the wall of Freeport, hoping that we could lose them in the tunnels. One of my friends ran away from the group and camped in some corner, so now it was just me and my Cel who was already hurting. Cel and I were separated by attacks and I stumbled into North Freeport while running away. Luckily DEs are equipped with hide which saved my butt because I immediately hit it after entering the zone. A party of 1warrior and 1 wizard, both higher than me suddenly appeared and sat downright next to my hidden body. They started yelling threats at me and eventually decided to patrol the sewers looking for me. I took off for the exit but in the process they saw me and began to zap me. Cel and I both reached the surface and took off to the Commonlands. At this point my other friend, Asscend came back from camping and we all met in the Commonlands. The humans were STILL after us, having followed us out of the sewers and into the Commonlands. Thankfully we had a few elven comrades in the Commonlands and we managed to chase the humans into Harold's Inn. There other humans joined them and other elves joined us. It became a huge siege; the elves surrounded the Inn and began killing anything that came out or tried to get in. Back in Nektoulos forests people started shouting that we were having a war with the humans in the Commonlands. Lots more elves showed up as did lots more humans. Eventually we just went at it, it was HUGE but the elves finally drove the humans out of the Commonlands (because we had the numbers, or because we're just better? hehe). Anyway I got a screenshot of the siege, which I'll try to send, it looks amazing!</P>
