<!--http://www.lpage.com/wgb/wgb.dbm?owner=ladymage-->when i started uo i already had knowledge of RPGs.....so i knew that mages start out weak and later 
become very powerful.....i was really disapointed out how weak they really were in uo and was un aware
of how to go about making them worthwhile......so your mage info REALLY helped....Thanx

<!--http://www.lpage.com/wgb/wgb.dbm?owner=ladymage-->Although I have only been playing this game for a little while I find myself infatuated with its ability to bring people closer together.  I say there should be more of this in the future...it is a cool way to pass your free time.  I would love to get into the stories of my successes and failures...but you can't have it all : )! I guess I shall have to settle for those I encounter in the Atlantic shard.

all but the thing that hit me the hardest was your Ultima 
Online pages. I am getting it hopefully for christmas, and I
am interested to know how it is, from a person who has 
played it. Plz email me if u can. Oh yea by the way,u wouldnt
happen to know anyone who has an extra pentium 133 laying 
around would you? One last thing u can be on my icq list if u 
want just hit search and type in Sir Hondo.

<b>Comments</b>: 
<!--http://www.lpage.com/wgb/wgb.dbm?owner=ladymage-->I don't even want to start about the lag on the Lake Superior server.  The reason I wanted to write this was because
I was curious about the one thing that seems to be lacking in
Ultima Online right now.  Cheats, or even really good hints
for that matter.  Ladymage I like your section on how to become a good mage and will go by those guidelines, but isn't
there really fast ways of getting money.  Cheats, editors
and the like.  Don't get me wrong I'm not a major cheater and
will only use it for the good and not to harm others, but
Ultima Online seems to be the only game that doesn't have 
something to make cash or anything else real quick.  If there
is anyone who has anything at all that will help me and others
out, please e-mail me at:  Vortaking@aol.com

    P.S.  Ladymage, I would like to talk to you a bit more on
magery and other things in Ultima Online.  I have a few tricks that might be of help.  I have quite a bit of stuff but
my magery department is lacking.  If you have the time I
would appreciate it if you could e-mail me at the above address and I'll get back to you.

Thank You Ladymage and whoever sends me anything useful!

<!--http://www.lpage.com/wgb/wgbsign.dbm?owner=ladymage-->Just had a couple questions.  First, I'm making a page, and was wondering if it was ok to er, borrow images off other pages, as long as you don't take credit.  I just don't have the time or knowledge to make my own, so I've resorted to the next best thing.  Second, is it customary to ask permission to link other personal pages to your own?  Going to put in a link to here if it's fine with you. Thanks.

<b>Comments</b>: Hi!

You seem to know a lot about UO,  I've just found out about it today and I'm very interested, but everything seems to be about Beta testers.  I don't know much about the internet or UO (although I did play Ultima IV in the Amiga days) what about someone who just wants to play? Is the game done yet; is it ready for public consumption? I called EA and it seems like they're ready to sell it.  What do you think about it and what info do you have (even if you can just direct me to the right place.)

Thanks

Blair

Likley to find some new people here. (most are new come to think about it..seems I have become an old timer ;)

I don't know what this is in Eastern Time. By the way..just out of curiosity..how did you change the horizontal line in your guestbook? I don't remember seeing an option to do that.

interested in any information concerning patches and fixsaves
for Daggerfall.  I am having so many problems with it.  I
guess I just sort of feel like throwing this really great
game into the fire, but I keep drudging through the errors 
and crashes.  I have downloaded the fixsave and patch from
bethsoft, but am hoping you may know of other patches and 
fixes. I hope to hear from you.  Respectfully, Garadan. :)
