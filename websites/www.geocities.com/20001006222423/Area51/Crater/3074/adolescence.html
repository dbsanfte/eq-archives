</FONT><FONT COLOR="#008080"><P ALIGN="CENTER">"Everyone is bigger then you, and you have these damn growing pains"</P>

</FONT><I><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808000"><P ALIGN="CENTER">"Your powers are growing nicely, continue my young one and I shall empower you ten fold."</P>
</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P>After many snakes and beetles meet their fate you reach your first turning point in your character.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#800000"><P ALIGN="CENTER">Level 4:</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P> You will receive your new rank of spells, and are allowed to use the mediation skill.  First thing head to the bank and withdraw your savings and head to your guild house (on average you will have about 2 plat so you can buy 4 spells if not buy as you go along).  Train one point in mediation and save the rest as mediation goes up very fast on its own.  Find your spell vendor (usually the same one's you used for your first circle spells) </P>
<P>Buy spells in this order to be most effective:</P>
<P>(Spells cost approx. </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ffff00">5gp</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080">)</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P> Leering Corpse:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> This pet is much better then your first pet.  It deals and takes about 5 times as much damage.  This is the main reason you can level up fast, through ranks 4-8. This (like all new spells ranks) should be your first purchase).</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Poison Bolt:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> Ahh poison, I love this spell.  You cast this spell as a good opening spell and let the poison act like another person beating on your enemy.  Does initial damage and damage over time.  You best attack (not life draining) spell until level 12.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Clinging darkness:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> Some people say that life spike should be bought before this one but I disagree.  This spell is actually a best opening spell (even better then Poison Bolt), reason why is because it does Damage over time and slows your target.  This will give you plenty of time to cast Poison Bolt on top of clinging darkness for more Damage over time. </P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Grim Aura:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> This is a nice spell that you can only cast on yourself it ups your attack rating.  It's good because at this level you will still be fighting with your dagger and you do more damage.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Life Spike:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> An Upgrade to your life tap spells this spell average is about 13 Hp's drained from your target to yourself.  If you have the room in your memorization bar keep Life Tap until level 6, it takes less mana/time to cast in a hurry.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Gate:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080">  This spell will transport you back to the city gates of Neriak (or wherever to you are bound too).  This spell is great to have and I bought it before life spike, only because I hate traveling: P</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#800000"><P ALIGN="CENTER">Can I please move out of the newbie zone?</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>At level four you can start moving around alittle more (try and stick close to the roads until level 6 or so).  You still fight most of the same things plenty of fire beetles and spiderlings.  You can move up to harder creatures in these next levels:</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808000"><P>**Shadow Wolves, Bears, Tree snakes and Skeletons can have varying power levels make sure you use the /cons and stick with the even fights or lower. **</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ff0000"><P>Level 4-5:</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Large Spiders</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080">: Most of these will /con even fight at 4 and 5 and becomes "upper hand" at 6+.  These spiders yield the same spider silk as spiderlings put you get a better price for it (1gp+).  They have a weak poison but you shouldn't have to worry about it as it wears off fast.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Shadow Wolves:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> Some of the weaker shadow wolves will /con even with you and they yield great experience, chunks of meat, and pelts.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Black Bears</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080">: Most of the black bears will /con even by level 4, but you must be careful as they do alot of damage (usually 10hp mauls).  Use the weaken spell first to take this down to 8hp's. You receive basically the same things as you do with wolves' meat/pelts.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ff0000"><P>Level 5+</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Skeletons:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080">  You can find some skeletons at level 5 that will /con even with you.  Make sure you poison, weaken these to start the fight and make the battle go much easier. You will usually receive more Silver pieces then on decaying skeletons, but other then that, the loot is the same. </P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ff0000"><P>Level 6-8</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Tree Snakes:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> You will notice at level 5 that you can find some tree snakes that /con even to you but I don't recommend fighting them at 5.  Every time I decided to attack one I ended up winning but I had less then half my life and poisoned with no pet and no mana.  I was mediating to get enough mana to Life Tap nearby moss snakes to stay alive until the poison ran its course.  You receive snakeskin (non-stackable) (2SP on average).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#800000"><P ALIGN="CENTER">What about armor should I invest in Cloth armor?</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>
<P>As A dark elf you can wear Small Clothing (and medium).  One such creature drops small cloth armor and they run amuck in East Commons and in Foreport's Newbie zones.  The are Deathfist Runts their extremely easy to kill and yield a couple of silver pieces, Sometimes a weapon and small cloth armor.  You should never have to buy cloth armor because it's easy to get.  I personally like hunting in east commons because you have your Black Bears, Pumas and large spiders you can attack here also.</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#800000"><P ALIGN="CENTER">General Tips For Level's 4-8.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#800000"><P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Money:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080">  You must work hard at gaining money at these levels because at level 8 you get your new spells and they cost 5 plat + per spell and it gets expensive so you have to try and get 20 plat by the time you hit level 8.  Kill all the giant spiders (silk worth 1gp+), Skeletons (Silver, Chips and weapons), Shadow wolf's (some pelts and skins are worth over 2GP).  Don't be afraid to kill those fire beetles there always good for 2-5 silver.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Pet Weapons:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> Don't bother giving your pet any weapon other then a Rusty Dagger or a Rusty Short sword both these only cost 2 silver, 4 silver (respectfully), All the other weapons are worth at least 1GP and up, save all those 2 handed swords for your level 8 pets.  Sell the rest.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Sacrificial Pets:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"> Like mentioned in the Last section, don't be afraid to sacrifice your pet if things get bad.  Back out of the fight and gate.  You will lose your pet but you will survive the day.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><P>Faction:</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080">  If you plane on entering into another city (like Freeport) you may want to start working hard on your faction standings.  Killing off Deathfist Orcs is a great way.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#808000"><P>**Note raising you faction is a long hard process and takes a few hundred Deathfist Kill's**</P></FONT></BODY>
