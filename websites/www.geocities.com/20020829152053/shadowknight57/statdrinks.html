<b>Stat drinks</b> are a nice new addition to the brewer's repetoire. They are non-alocoholic and so can be used instead of water for drinking purposes, and they boost stats and saves. Another noteworthy thing about them is the extended duration for which they will remain in your bag before they get used up. Regular old water is just a Drink (right click on it, it'll tell you). However, there are many different durations of drink that can now be made. Malted Milk is a Whistle Whetter, and doesnt last as long as water, and Qeynos Afternoon Tea is a Miraculous Drink which will last a very long time.<br><br>

To get the best out of your special brews, they must be the first available drink that you have in your inventory. DO NOT right click on them to force yourself to drink them. You are only wasting them. Instead, take something like normal water and force yourself to drink that instead. You will fill yourself up with that, and still be getting the benefits of your stat drink, so long as it is the first drink available.<br><br>

Because these brews are just a little bit special, it stands to reason that the ingredients might take a little more time to collect and prepare. Don't be surprised if you have to run all over the place to get the items you need. Also, for some of the more involved brews, you may need a Corking Device. This is made by Tinkerers and will probably set you back a bit as it involves the use of a Blue Diamond. The corking device is used just like any other tool in tradeskills, you put it into the brew barrel along with the rest of the ingredients, and you will get it back whether or not you succeed (good thing too). The corking device is also used in the making of the <a href="trophymain.html">Grandmaster Brewer's Corker</a>, which shall be discussed on a seperate page when I get around to it.<br><br><br>


Ok then, here is the list of new and interesting brews. Bollocks to water!<p><br><br>
