<p><strong>This section of my guide has been put up as a courtesy
to other players who have been aided or wronged by other players.
Norrath is a world populated by warriors and mages, paladins and
rogues, and many others. Naturally, some people are going to
fight to make Norrath a better world, while others are only out
for themselves. This is a place to give voice to the names and
deeds of those who have helped or harmed you. Fame can be a
dual-edged sword though, as I well know (OOC: Holger, do you have
anything for a newbie??? PLEAAAAAASE?), so think well before you
submit someone. To have a person added to this page, send an
E-mail through </strong><a href="mailto:axelo@home.com"><strong>this
link</strong></a><strong> to me with the person's character's
name, your character's name, their deed(s), the server where the
deed took place, and anything else about the submitee. And if
they are to be a hero or villan! Note that I will put your name
and E-mail up here, and any false submissions will be removed.
Oh, and before I forget, if you send a picture, I will include it
with the post!</strong></p>

<p><strong>By Brell! I can't believe how many submissions I've
gotten since I advertised this site on Everlore and EQVault!
Trust me folks, advertising works! Thanks to you all for your
submissions, and keep 'em coming!</strong></p>

Gililavyn did this because he cares about the people of Norrath,

Coyotes, this powerful ogre warrior saw a player in need and

which is very expensive. While thus in training, he was unable to
buy armor or weapons for himself. While hunting Dervishes in the
Desert of Ro, Crushem joined the group which Coyotes was hunting
with. He took one look at Coyotes and simply said &quot;you need
better armor,&quot; then walked away. He came back bearing a
near-full suit of banded mail, which he gave to the amazed
barbarian Warrior, free of charge! It's philanthropy like this
that serves as a shining example to us all.</strong></font></p>

found out that the weapon had been 'nerfed,' and had to give up.
It's good to see someone who cares enough about other people to
place themselves in danger to aid them. Even though they were
unable to get the Harpoon, it's the thought that really counts!</strong></font></p>

Janika, at great risk to herself, snuck back down into the
dungeon and looted my corpse, bringing me my armor and waepons.
Then, because she had accidently dropped my Mithril Staff, she
went back down to get it, but unfortunatly the staff had already
vanished :( Thanks alot Jan, losing my corpse has always been my
