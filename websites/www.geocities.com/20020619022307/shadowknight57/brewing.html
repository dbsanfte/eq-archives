<p><img src="pietin.jpg" align="left">Brewing can be an immense amount of fun. Ok, the icon is a Pie Tin, but hey, I'm out of pictures... I started because my primary trade skill used to be Smithing, and I thought that some day I might need to make some tempers for the Cultural Armours. As it turns out, I lost my great interest in Smithing after it became apparent that the high end smithed armours are insanely expensive to make, take incredibly high skill to achieve, and I can’t wear any of them.</p><br>

But Brewing had become fun to do, so I kept at it. It also gave me a use for all the foraged Fruit and Veg that I had stored up in the bank. After the recent improvements, it is now possible to specialise in Brewing (go over 200 skill), and there are yet more interesting and humerous brews that can be made (can we say Boot Beer?)<p><br>

<p><img src="pietin.jpg" align="left"> I do all of my brewing in Freeport, which seems to have become my adopted home of late. Qeynos is just too damned far from the druid ring…</p>

West Freeport has the Brewing Vendor, Kristin Charcoal, and she is located near the gate. To find her, stand at the gate and face away from the newbie zone, into the city. Walk forward until you hit the wall of the red guard building. Turn left and walk forward to the wall. Turn left again and walk up the ramp. <p>

If she hasn’t wandered off again, she should be right there. She sells things like Malt, Barley, Yeast, Hops and the like. I am unsure of where other similar vendors are found in Norrath, but there must be some somewhere. Other things you will need like Bottles, Grapes, Casks and Shot Glasses can be found in most bars and pubs, of which there are many in Freeport.<p>

You will also need water a lot of the time. The other thing you will need is the Brew Barrel. For those of you who have never seen one, here it is <a href="brewbarrel.jpg">Pic of Brew Barrel</a>. It’s the big barrel on it’s side on top of a box. These can be found in all 3 of Freeport’s zones, usually in or near a pub.<p>

In North Freeport it is inside the pub building near the bank (the one with the pottery wheel outside). In West Freeport there is a Brew Barrel outside the Hogcaller’s Inn (centrally placed building, seedy looking). East Freeport has at least two, one is in a pub between the gate and the docks, and the other is in I think the Imports Building.<p><br>

<p><img src="pietin.jpg" align="left">Seeing as I am a druid and I forage a lot, I took a route that involves lots of foraged Fruit, Berries and Vegetables. However, for those of you who can’t forage, or don’t have time to stock up on loads of these I have also made a table of an alternative route that just avoids foraged items wherever possible.</p><br>

Also, for those people who can’t find a vendor for the Barley, Yeast and what have you, I have tried to put together another table that skips those parts. If there are steps that you can’t get ingredients for, then skip it, or try something from the other table.<p><br>

<img src="barrelopen.jpg"><p><br>

As always, NEVER stack items in the combining container, and NEVER use Summoned or Foraged water, it just won’t work.<p>

Where there is a container mentioned, just throw one of them into the Brew Barrel along with the rest of the ingredients and hit combine. Ie. For Bog Juice put 1 water, 1 Snake Scales and 1 Bottle into the Brew Barrel and combine.<p>

If you are successful you will receive a beverage, and in some cases some empty bottles. If you are unsuccessful your container will be returned to you, and the rest of the items will disappear.<p><br>

<b>*</b>Depending on which you have at the time, fruit or berries, you can make either. It’s not really a big deal the trivials are pretty much the same.<p><br>

<b>**</b>Short Beer can be bought quite cheaply from most pubs. Don’t waste time trying to make loads of it yourself. Guess when I found out that pubs sell it?<p><br>

<b>***</b>The three racial beverages used to make the Faydwer Shaker can be bought in East Freeport in the Blue Imports Building. Mead can be bought from other pub merchants.<p><br>

As you can see, missing out the brews that use foraged goods creates a good few gaps between trivial levels. You may want to invest in a couple of stacks of Berries and Vegetables to fill in between Ale and Ol’ Tujim’s, and Ol’ Tujim’s and the Faydwer Shaker.<p><br>

As you can see, there are big gaps here below 135. You will need boatloads of Veggies if you plan on this route, so make friends with an outdoors type.<p><br>
