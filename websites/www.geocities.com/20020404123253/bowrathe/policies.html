This is a quick overview of our policies. For more indepth explanation check out <A HREF="http://pub57.ezboard.com/fbloodofwarfrm7" onMouseOut="window.status=' ';return true" onMouseOver="window.status='Blood of War Guild Policies';return true">here</A><BR><BR>

Our basic premise to the game is we are in it to have fun. The foundation of this guild is mostly a bunch of Army guys stationed together in Okinawa and a couple of friends and family who by one means or another got hooked on the crack. We decided that it would be fun to get together and form our own guild, and so Blood of War is born. We want to have fun with the game. Raiding is something we will do, but we don't want it to be the main focus. Interaction with other people in the game is what we are looking for. Have fun with it. It is a game, and that's what you are supposed to do with it.<BR><BR>

Yes, there will be raiding....more than likely lots of it. In our first 3 weeks, we've managed to hit Chardok, SS, ToFS, and the Hole. We are working towards hitting the planes and doing epic raiding, but first we need to get comfortable and understand the others playing style so there is no confusion when we get to that level. All loot will be distributed by the CLMs or by the officers in charge of the raid.<BR><BR>

Our current standard to join is 35+, but that is flexible. Go to our message board and fill out an application, and if you can, find some BoW people to play with. Ask them to put in a good word for you on the app and we'll see about getting you in. Also, we take all RL friends and family members of current BoW members. We want this to be an enjoyable experience for all and it's more fun if you know RL people and can harrass them for how they play ;^)<BR><BR>
We are a fairly laid back guild. No requirements to raid, just enjoy the friends, and make it when you can. Of course we PREFER if you make it all the time...  ;^)<BR>
If you have any questions, feel free to hit us up in game or drop us an email at <A HREF="mailto:bowrathe@yahoo.com">BoWRathe@yahoo.com</A><BR><BR>
