From his realm of pain and anger, our father guides us in his conquest of Norrath.  Nor race or god shall stand in Innouruuk's way for we shall cut them down.  We are born of hate. It is this hatred that you must use to gain power. With Innoruuk's guiding hand our children shall one day rule this land.  It is a long and glorious path to our victory. Ignore the petty races who ask for pity or mercy as you slay them. There can never be peace. We do not need love or kindness. The hate within your hearts will guide the creative force inside you to destroy all. These are the wishes of our father. Embrace your heritage and cleanse the earth for Innoruuk!

It was the Elves who drew the unwanted attention of Innoruuk,  Prince of Hate.  In a decrepit tower overlooking the dark decaying alleys of the Plane over which he ruled, Innoruuk waited, stoking the fire of his Hate until it was a raging inferno.  He cursed his fellow gods for not including him in their pact and vowed to make them regret such disrespect.  From the halls of the Elves' fair city, Takish-Hiz, the Prince of Hate snatched away the first Elven King and Queen.  In his realm of pain and anger he slowly tore them apart, physically and mentally, over the course of three hundred years.  He then gathered the quivering remnants of these beings of light and rebuilt them into his own dark sadistic image, a twisted mockery of Tunare's noble children.  In depositing the Teir'Dal, as Innoruuk's Dark Elven creations would come to be called, back into the Underfoot of Norrath, the seeds for the Prince of Hate's final revenge were sown.</font></b></font>

As I first layed eyes on my god, I could only stand in awe at his greatness.  The War of the Gods was in front of me, fight!  Seeing the human god Mithaniel Marr fall and the halfing god Fizzlethorpe turn on our father, I moved in for a tactical strike.  The Prince of Hate quickly drained  Fizzlethorpe so that his powers faded and he shrunk to normal size.  Seizing the opportunity I attacked the puny halfling god without fear.  For I knew the battle was won thanks to the almighty Innoruuk and his loyal children.</font></b></font><BR>  
<font color="WHITE" size=4><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">
The war moved into the pass and raged on as the humans waiting in the commonlands tried to retrieve their fallen comrades from the bridge.  Making a push into the commonlands the followers of Innoruuk killed the remainder of the attacking army and defended the pass for the rest of the night.  No doubt this army will continue it's march onto Freeport soon.

<BR>
<font color="WHITE" size=4><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Followers of Innoruuk include nearly the entire Dark Elven
 race who regard him as their "Father." They believe that
 Hate is a creative force, or rather "THE" creative force in
 the universe. Creativity born of destruction. Love and
 kindness are tools for those too ignorant to know what
 they want or too cowardly to do what is necessary to
 obtain it. It is only through the total disdain of your
 enemies that you can gain true power over them. Pity and
 mercy have no power when confronted with contempt and
 viciousness. It is the honest belief of the followers of
 Innoruuk that if they were to hate strong enough they
 could destroy all of Norrath.  </font></b></font>

Proper service in the Eyes of Innoruuk is expressed by three commandments. In Neriak, past the Third Gate, in the Black Library, there is a small chamber. In that most holy chamber stands a pedestal, and on that pedestal rests the Great Pact. Here is written in the Ancient Tongue the Commandments of Innoruuk by His own Hand. These are the foundations of the Church, and must be followed above all else. I set forth here, in plain and modern language, the Commandments: 
<BR>
<BR>
<font color="red" size=5><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">
THE FIRST COMMANDMENT: PURPOSE~
</font></b></font>
<BR>
<BR>
<font color="WHITE" size=4><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"> 
All Teir’Dal were created only for the fulfillment of the Will of Innoruuk. We exist only to do so. We do not follow the Will. We ARE the Will. We cannot be separated from the Father, and free-will is not a burden We carry. We are not troubled by questions of right and wrong as are mortals. We simply do the Will of Our Father, and in this We are superior. 
<BR>
<BR>
Each Teir’Dal is given a purpose in the Will even before their birth. We Children must follow Our purpose, for only in it will the Will be realized. Above all others, some purposes are great, and are called the High Purposes. They are enumerated in the Catechism of Purpose and are as follows, in descending order: </font></b></font>

<BR>
<BR>
<font color="blue" size=4><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">
The Queen and King: </font></b></font>

<BR>
<BR>
<font color="WHITE" size=4><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">
Eternal Mother and Father to Us all. They are pure, and beyond reproach. </font></b></font>
<BR>

<BR>
<font color="blue" size=4><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">
Clerics: </font></b></font>

<BR>
<BR>
<font color="WHITE" size=4><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">
They are the mouth of Innoruuk and speak His Words. They insure that Children do not stray from the Father, and that the body does not falter in the Will. They are one with the Father and above all others in understanding of the Will. They are His embodiment in this world. </font></b></font>

<BR>
<BR>
<font color="blue" size=4><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">
Necromancers: </font></b></font>
<BR>
<BR>
<font color="WHITE" size=4><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">
Their purpose is to command the dead in the service of the Will. Death is no excuse to be released from the Will. The dead must serve the Father as in life. There can be no rest until the End. They also bind the dead of the Hated Others to the Service of Innoruuk, and are to be revered. </font></b></font>

<BR>
<BR>
<font color="blue" size=4><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">
Shadowknights: </font></b></font>
<BR>
<BR>
<font color="WHITE" size=4><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">
They are the Soldiers of Innoruuk. They are the holy guardians of the Priesthood, and the swordarm of the highest servants of the Father. They are unwavering in their purpose and are blessed in the Eyes of Innoruuk. </font></b></font>

<BR>
<BR>
<font color="blue" size=4><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">
Warriors: </font></b></font>
<BR>
<BR>
<font color="WHITE" size=4><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">
They are the shield of the Queen and King. They are strong among the Children, and full of Hate. Their purpose it to cut down the enemies of the Will and before them none shall stand. 

All purposes serve the Will of Innoruuk, but these shall be set above all others as most holy. </font></b></font>


<BR>
<BR>
<font color="red" size=5><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">
THE SECOND COMMANDMENT: UNITY~ </font></b></font>

<BR>
<BR>
<font color="WHITE" size=4><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">
Teir’Dal shall not raise word, hand, or sword against Teir’Dal. All are Sisters and Brothers in the Will of the Father. Those that turn away from the will, however, shall be considered Spurned, and shall be treated as are the Hated Others. The Will shall always remain open to them, however, and if the Spurned turns back to the Will of the Father, they shall be allowed admittance to all but the highest mysteries of the Church, as befits the purity of their blood. </font></b></font>
<BR>


<BR>
<font color="red" size=5><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">
THE THIRD COMMANDMENT: PURITY~ </font></b></font>

<BR>
<BR>
<font color="WHITE" size=4><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">
The teachings of the Church shall not be kept from any who are called to the Will of the Father. Therefore, all who turn from the lying gods and turn to the True Father may be taught of the Will, regardless what race they call Mother. However, those not of purest Teir’Dal blood shall not be taught the inner mysteries, nor allowed entry into the Third Gate or the Church of the Firstborn. They shall also not partake of the Service of the Catechisms, nor be bound by the Commandments of the Pact of the Father. In short, they may be taught Our Father’s use for them, but they are not to be admitted into the Circle of His Children. 


Those that stand against the Father shall be damned. They are the Hated Others. All shall be reviled and destroyed. Hatred shall be spread among them and they shall perish from inside as well as from out. No mercy shall be shown them, and none shall be suffered to live. 

Thus are the Words of Our Father. Thus are His Commandments to Us. </font></b></font>
