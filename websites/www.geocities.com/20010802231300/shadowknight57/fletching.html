I first started Fletching with my very first character Treye, a Wood Elf Ranger. Full of wonder at the new world he had discovered in the forest, he quickly found that even a flask of water cost the earth to buy, and set out eeking a meagre living to buy himself food by collecting batwings and wasp parts and selling them on.</p><br>

While trolling through the vendors one day, he came upon an exciting discovery. The Fletching vendor! They sold arrows! They sold bows! But most exciting of all, they sold a box that you could make your very own bows and arrows in! Ranger heaven! Quite soon, Treye had scrounged up enough money to buy his very own Fletching kit. It took him a whole day, but he did it. He then spent another long day saving up enough to buy a Whittling Blade.<p><br>

So, there he was, proud new tools in hand, and he bought himself a simple Hickory Stave, and some Hemp String. He’d even made some arrows beforehand, to make sure he would have a better chance at making his first bow, and something to shoot with it afterwards. He places the stave and the string into the kit, along with the whittling blade, as the book he’d bought said that bows made with a knife were better. He prays to Tunare, and presses combine.<p><br>

Poor Treye never did do any Fletching again after that. Two day’s savings down the drain, because he didn’t know you can’t use a knife with the lowest grade of stave. Please, please, don’t make the same mistake he did, check out the bow’s table at <a href="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~ewj/fletchguide/index.htm">Aoenla’s Fletching Guide</a> before you make your first bow.<p><br>


<p><img src="Forest.gif" align="left">
Xanthe on the other hand had a lot of fun Fletching. It was my last trade skill to master, and I originally only started it to be complete. The good thing about Fletching is you can go all the way from 0 skill to over 200 standing in the same place in front of the arrow vendor. And when you get to around 200 skill you can make some very nice bows indeed.</p><br>

I stopped at skill 193, so as not to specialise in Fletching, and then I attempted to make the mother of all player made bows, the Shaped Compound Darkwood Silk. I almost didn’t dare to try it, as according to a lot of Specialised Fletchers Darkwood never goes trivial, but I had spent the whole day skilling up and getting a sore mouse wrist so I figured what the hell.<p><br>
Fortunately for me, I succeeded, and was rewarded with a beautiful bow (which I sadly can’t use, because I am a druid). It fetched a fine price of 750pp in East Commons, to a generous gnome, so I was happy all in all.<p><br>

I did my Fletching in South Qeynos. The vendor is near the clock tower, he’s standing next to a brown wooden building across the pond. Fletching kits can be bought at any place that sells BOW components. Arrow vendors don’t have them. I got mine in Surefall Glade. For those out in the field, the centaurs in South Karana also sell kits and bow components at the centaur village south and east of the stone bridge.<p><br>


<p><img src="Forest.gif" align="left"> The route that I took was purely making arrows, as it’s a lot quicker and cheaper than bows, and you will lose less money if you have a failure. Also, everything stacks. You may get a bit bored, but just keep reminding yourself of all the wonderful bows you can make when you get to high level:)</p><br>

Apparently, a higher Dexterity on a character will increase your chances of success in Fletching, so if you have any dex gear then you might want to wear it, or get a buff.<p><br>

Here is the route that I took. As always, NEVER stack items in the Fletching kit.<p><br>

There are 4 components to every arrow: the Point, the Shaft, the Fletch, and the Nock. Some of these have an effect on the properties of the resulting arrow, and everything you could ever wish to know about bows and arrows can be found once again at <a href="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~ewj/fletchguide/index.htm">Aoenla’s Fletching Guide</a>.<p><br>
Make sure that all 4 components are in the kit before you press combine. If you are successful you will receive 5 arrows, if you are not, all the items will disappear.<p><br>

So there you have it. Quick and easy. If you go all the way to the top you will spend a few hundred pp in all, if you sell all of your successes back to the vendor. The higher end arrows cost a fair bit per attempt, but thankfully they don’t seem to fail very often at all.<p><br>

<b><u><font size=+1>Manufactured items you may need - possibly</font></u></b><p><br>

If you are a smith, or know one, some arrow components can be made using that skill, although it is debatable whether it is more cost effective to make or buy the items. Here is a table of items that can be made.<p><br>
