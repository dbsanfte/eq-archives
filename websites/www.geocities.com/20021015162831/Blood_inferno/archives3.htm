        Guys, Make sure you check out our links page.&nbsp; I think it has some
        interesting links on there.&nbsp; Soon, I'll take the time to make it a
        bit more flashy, but for now it is very useable.&nbsp; I want to point
        out one of the links there, it is to the EQ Forge.&nbsp; This is a
        really interesting site, but more importantly, I would like our members
        to use it to create there own personal profiles about themselves.&nbsp;
        It will allow you to update your profile at any time you chose.&nbsp;
        What I will do is link your name on the members page to your profile, so
        that anyone who visits our web page can get info about you there.&nbsp;
        Please check it out by <a href="http://www.eqforge.com/">following this
        link</a>, or the visit our <a href="links.htm">Links page</a>.
        <p>Ok, I updated the members page, made many additions and removed a few
        people as well.&nbsp; I also updated Melea's name, I am sure she don't
        mind.&nbsp; Guild strength is around 104.&nbsp; Approaching 10,000 hits
        on our guild page, and nearly 17,000 on our message board with over 100
        registered users.&nbsp; Lot of activity going on in Blood Inferno.</p>
        <p>BTW,&nbsp; Melea and Balaam announced their engagement last
        night!&nbsp; Congratulations to them both.&nbsp; I am looking forward to
        a get naked and dance and drink night, somewhere very public!&nbsp; I'll
        bring the Ale, you ladies bring yourselves!&nbsp; <img border="0" src="images/tongue.gif" width="15" height="15"></p>

        Hey again!
        <p>I have spent some time trying to develop a good system for planar
        loot.&nbsp; There are many people who have varying ways of determining
        what is fair ranging from guild only gets to loot on one extreme, to
        everyone on the raid can loot, on the other extreme with varying degrees
        in between.&nbsp; Please refer to the link in the sidebar under Guides,
        or <a href="eq_planar_probs.htm">follow this link</a> for the article.</p>
        <p>What I have compiled is some probability tables for Planar loot only
        (Armor).&nbsp; This generally applies to the Plane of Hate and the Plane
        of Fear.&nbsp; It does NOT apply to loot that is randomized from normal
        mobs in the normal zones.</p>
        <p>In these tables I describe what I believe to be a major flaw in the
        current loot system and proposes an implementation of a new loot
        system.&nbsp; I would like our guild to take a look at the guide and
        make responses to the idea on our message board.</p>
        <p>I am also going to open it up to the public and ask for
        feedback.&nbsp; I hope it stimulates some intriguing discussion.</p>

        Greetings!
        <p>A lot of fun and blood pumping excitement was to be had when our
        guild held a guild tournament last week.&nbsp; The tournament was broken
        down by teams until only one team was left.&nbsp; Then the final members
        of that team dueled to determine an ultimate winner.&nbsp; This time it
        was Njorls!&nbsp; Congratulations Nj!&nbsp; Nj has a nice profile that
        can be <a href="http://www.eqforge.com/shaman/profiles/profile.cfm?ID=149">found
        at this site</a>.</p>
        <p>On Sunday we had a very good turnout for our Plane of Hate
        raid.&nbsp; The raid was one of the best that I have been
        on.&nbsp;&nbsp; The raid went very smooth and at a nice pace.&nbsp; A
        lot of people got some very nice loot.&nbsp; We cleared the entire
        zone.&nbsp; Although I got no pictures of our battle with the Maestro of
        Rancor we successfully defeated him.&nbsp; Here is a few shots of the
        party sitting on his pipe organ.</p>
        <p><a href="images/MaestroOrgan1.jpg"><img border="2" src="images/MaestroOrgan1_small.jpg" alt="MaestroOrgan1.jpg (75087 bytes)" width="100" height="75"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p>After we killed the Maestro of Rancor, we cleared the second floor
        for our attempt at the God, Innoruk.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we were unable
        to kill him, but the raid was still a lot of fun.&nbsp; Here are a few
        pictures of our battle with Innoruk.</p>
        <p><a href="images/Innoruk1.jpg"><img border="2" src="images/Innoruk1_small.jpg" alt="Innoruk1.jpg (60028 bytes)" width="100" height="75"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p>Unfortunately, I was able to capture the aftermath of the violence
        from Innoruk on camera, but I was able to capture a similar slaying on
        an attempt at Phinigel Atrophos from Kedge Keep.&nbsp; This is what
        happens on a bad pull on this boss mob!&nbsp; OUCH!</p>

        attending need to sign up <a href="http://pub9.ezboard.com/fbloodinferno58183raidseventssignup.showMessage?topicID=26.topic">at
        this link</a>.&nbsp; All guild members are highly encouraged to attend
        if you meet the appropriate level requirements.&nbsp; For those members
        who are just shy of the level requirements, keep at it, because we are
        high on the list for the next Lady Vox raid.</p>
        <p>I have updated the members list once again for all of you who have
        sent me E-mail.&nbsp; I hope I got it right, and if I made a mistake
        please drop me a line or post your information on our message
        board.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>
        <p>I would also like to take a moment to personally thank a few of our
        members who have worked very hard at planning and organizing events for
        our members who&nbsp; are what I consider to be the backbone of our
        guild.&nbsp; Special thanks to Necklare and Drathmar who I am always
        seeing making posts on our message board about fun guild related
        activities.&nbsp; Good Job guys.</p>

        Greetings guys and gals.&nbsp; Today I have some pictures and a few
        comments on some great raids that our guild has been recently
        sponsoring.
        <p>Dinbas Soulreviver led our guild on a Plane of Fear raid last
        weekend.&nbsp; The raid was typical of Planar raids.&nbsp; Many people
        lost their lives on the initial break-in of the zone, but after things
        got rolling, the dividends started to pay off.&nbsp; Good job Dinbas and
        those other guild members who assisted with the raid.</p>
        <p>Here are a few photos from the raid.</p>
        <p><a href="images/Fearportal.jpg"><img border="2" src="images/Fearportal_small.jpg" alt="Fearportal.jpg (56192 bytes)" width="100" height="75"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <a href="images/Fearportal2.jpg"><img border="2" src="images/Fearportal2_small.jpg" alt="Fearportal2.jpg (45558 bytes)" width="100" height="75"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <a href="images/Amyknight.jpg"><img border="2" src="images/Amyknight_small.jpg" alt="Amyknight.jpg (86097 bytes)" width="100" height="75"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Revenge was the word as the guild took down Lady Vox, the ice dragon
        of Permafrost, on Thursday.&nbsp; Many may remember the failed attempt
        on Lady Vox some months ago.&nbsp; Thursdays raid was not to be the
        same.&nbsp; Only a few casualties happened during the pulls of ice
        giants, and two casualties went down during the actual assault.&nbsp;
        Some very nice items were dropped including two Ruined Bolster Belts,
        two 100% weight reducing bags, two bard horns, and some words.&nbsp;
        Congratulations to those who were lucky enough to get a good roll on
        dragon loot!</p>
        <p>In these photos you can see we have Lady Vox pinned in her lair
        against the wall.&nbsp; Our groups were very tank heavy as you can tell
        by the swarm of people at her feet.</p>
        <p><a href="images/Vox1.jpg"><img border="2" src="images/Vox1_small.jpg" alt="Vox1.jpg (56333 bytes)" width="100" height="75"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p>I also spent some time again recently in the Plane of Hate, and
        wanted to put up a few more pictures for you guys aspiring to see this
        zone.&nbsp; These pictures include a few shots of the town.&nbsp; The
        zone is really just a glorified Estate of Unrest.&nbsp; Instead of one
        building, it has many buildings and a lot of undead.&nbsp; Check these
        out:</p>
        <p><a href="images/Hate1.jpg"><img border="2" src="images/Hate1_small.jpg" alt="Hate1.jpg (58059 bytes)" width="100" height="75"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <a href="images/Hate4.jpg"><img border="2" src="images/Hate4_small.jpg" alt="Hate4.jpg (66802 bytes)" width="100" height="75"></a></p>
        <p>On another note, many of our mid-level members have also been
        conducting exciting raids to help keep the interest of all our
        members.&nbsp; Recently, a raid was conducted on Dalnir's crypt by
        Drathmar.&nbsp; Rumor has that is was a lot of fun, and a great
        success.&nbsp; As soon as I get some pictures from their raid, you will
        see them here on this site.</p>
        <p><font color="#FFCC66">Poll results</font>:&nbsp; With nearly 40
        people voting in our most recent poll, conclusions can be made that most
        people who voted in our poll (16/40) play for the adventure.&nbsp; Quite
        a few others (10/40) are experience oriented when playing.&nbsp; Not
        surprisingly, only 3/40 players picked being achievers.&nbsp; I would
        say that is pretty accurate because our guild is not a guild that slays
        dragons or gods on a daily basis, although reading the above events
        might make you think otherwise.&nbsp; We seem to be a very versatile
        guild, probably because of the diversity of our members.&nbsp; Thanks to
        everyone who voted, please check out the new poll in the left margin and
        cast your vote.</p>
        <p>On a final note, Melea is planning a guild meeting within the next
        two weeks and would like everyone's input as to what would be a suitable
        date.&nbsp; Please visit <a href="http://pub9.ezboard.com/fbloodinferno58183discussion.showMessage?topicID=137.topic">this

        <p>A few members have left the guild that have Biographies published
        here on our site.&nbsp; I intend to keep these Bios up because I think
        they all make great reading.&nbsp; I would like to see some more

        people!&nbsp; If you haven't <a href="biographies.htm">read the
        biographies</a>, take time tomorrow at lunch and do so, you'll be
        pleasantly surprised.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, a little stats update.&nbsp; We are approaching 10,000
        hits on <a href="http://pub9.ezboard.com/bbloodinferno58183">our message
        board</a>.&nbsp; We have had as many as 500+ in a single day.&nbsp; This
        tells me that it is being used by a lot of people (and you guys have
        nothing to do at work).&nbsp; I would appreciate it if our members would
        take the time to register before posting on the EZboard.&nbsp;&nbsp; As
        a registered user, you'll be able to use a single user name and password
        to participate in thousands of EZboard communities.&nbsp; This also
        helps us determine who is actively viewing the boards, and we can direct
        those members who are not viewing it to the site.&nbsp; You can <a href="http://www.ezboard.com/createglobal.html">register

        <p>The officers of the guild recently held a meeting to discuss some
        important guild issues.&nbsp; You can read the detailed minutes of the

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Boreal Ace was voted in as a guild
        Officer.&nbsp; Congratulations!!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Assistant officers have been designated for
        both higher and lower level players to assist with guild planning
        events.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Guild members playing their alternate
        characters should remember to place their main characters name in carats
        at the beginning of any text they say in guild chat.&nbsp; This should
        help people identify with the person rather than the character and not
        feel alienated by new names.&nbsp; i.e.&nbsp;
        &quot;&lt;Necklare&gt;&nbsp; Hi everyone!&quot;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *There were some changes to the recruitment
        policy.&nbsp; They have been posted on the <a href="recruitment.htm">recruitment
        policy page</a> as well.</p>
        <p>The first ever guild fishing tournament was held in Fironia Vie on
        Monday night at 7:30pm EST as scheduled.&nbsp; It turned out to be a
        short fun-filled event.&nbsp; Players were given an allotted amount of
        time to catch the heaviest total catch, and to catch the heaviest single
        fish (without getting too drunk).&nbsp;&nbsp; Each winner was awarded a
        nice prize.&nbsp; The winners were as follows:</p>

        What an exciting weekend!&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <p>Many great guild activities this weekend.&nbsp; Among them a raid on
        the plane of fear, in which, I was able to snap a picture of the God of
        Fear - <a href="images/Cazic.jpg">Cazic Thule</a> himself.&nbsp; Pay a
        visit to our <a href="gallery.htm">Picture Gallery</a> to see a lot of
        new photos.</p>
        <p>A great raid was planned impromptu on Karnor's Castle led by Balaam
        Darkbowman on Sunday.&nbsp; Over 18 guild members stormed the castle and
        were rewarded with great loot, experience and camaraderie.&nbsp; It was
        very exciting to see so many Blood Inferno members in one place at the
        same time.&nbsp; As that was going on, other members courageously
        ventured into Old Sebilis and other areas of Norrath.&nbsp; Seems like a lot
        was happening this weekend and a lot of great fun!</p>
        <p>Here is a <a href="images/BIKarnors.jpg">photo</a> of the area we
        were fighting in Karnor's Castle.&nbsp;</p>

        It has been awhile since I have had the time to do an update, but I

        board</a>, please take the time to read over them if you were not at the

        <p>As posted in the minutes, Ulrich will be leaving the guild as he

        poll and picked &quot;Friends&quot; as your choice (16/23).&nbsp; I
        probably shouldn't have made that a choice since I was hoping the
        information might give insight as to how we should mold our functions

        page</a> to keep updated on them.&nbsp; If you have an event planned I
        would appreciate it if you would send me an E-mail so I can post it on

        <p>I have also taken the opportunity to use the updated information on
        the members to update the <a href="Members.htm">Members page</a>.&nbsp;
        Thanks Okansu and others for your work in that area.</p>
        <p>Lastly, I have added a new biography to the <a href="biographies.htm">Biographies
        section</a>.&nbsp; Please keep those coming as they make from some very
        interesting reading.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Congratulations to the newly appointed Officers!&nbsp; Now get to

        Hey everyone [/wave], please be sure to read Melea's post on the <a href="http://pub9.ezboard.com/fbloodinferno58183discussion.showMessage?topicID=66.topic">Message
        board</a> about the new guild officer assignments.&nbsp;
        <p>I also need some help (preferably from the Recruiting Officers) on
        updating the members lists.&nbsp; I am trying to decipher who the Alt's
        and Primary characters are so that we can have an accurate
        accountability of the guild.</p>
        <p>Guild members should also be sure to email me if your info is not
        posted, is not accurate or needs updating.</p>
        <p>Lastly, I have added a new poll to the page.&nbsp; The other was a
        bit outdated.</p>
