        <p><font color="#000000">So you want to be a ranger aye?
        Although rangers, along with other hybrids, have an
        experience penalty associated with the class, many people
        are still willing to become rangers. Why do you ask? Well
        simply put, rangers are one of the most well rounded and
        balanced classes in the game. We can do a little bit of
        everything. Rangers are 3/4 warrior and 1/4 druid. We
        recieve most of the same skills as a warrior but a few
        levels later than them. We also receive some of the magic
        powers of our druid brethern, the first of which begins
        at the 9th season. Although we will never be as powerful
        as a warrior in battle or a spell caster to the
        equivelent of a druid, we do take the best of both and
        make a pretty good class all our own.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000">Well now that you have
        established that you want to play the ranger class, you
        are probably wondering what race to choose. There are
        three races that may choose the ranger class. They are
        Human, Half Elf and Wood Elf. All of these races come
        with certain benefits and disadvantages but in my
        opinion, any of the races can make excellent rangers.
        Below each race will be briefly examined.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#000000"><img
        src="gif/bar.gif" width="399" height="10"></font></p>
        <p><a name="human"><strong><u>The Human Ranger</u></strong></a></p>
        <p><font color="#000000">Humans are one of the most
        diverse races in all off Norrath. They may choose to be
        any class except Shaman. So with so many choices for a
        Human to choose as his occupation, what can you expect if
        you choose the life of a Ranger? Human Rangers begin
        their life in the jagged pine village know as Surefall
        Glade. Well one of the most noticeable differences
        between a Human and his elf counterparts is the lack of
        infravision. Nightime play as a human will prove to be
        more challenging because you will not be able to see well
        at night, but then again some people relish that sort of
        challenge. Also, rangers recieve the spell Eyes of the
        Cat, which grants infravision, at the 30th season. So at
        that level and beyond, night time play will not be a
        factor. As I mentioned, Humans can play almost any class
        and because of that, their statistics are not really
        overlly impressive. Although Rangers have a bit higher
        strength, stamina, agility and wisdom over other Humans,
        they still are weaker than their elven counterparts when
        it comes to the Ranger class. So then you may be asking
        yourself, why would I want to be Human? Humans are the
        mark by which all other races are judged, so therefore
        they do not incure any experience penalty for race like
        Half Elves and Wood Elves do. Humans have the highest
        starting strength which will enable them to carry more
        without being encumbered and which also affects the
        Attack/Damage score. Also at the 15th season they get the
        spell Feel Like Cat, which is an agility boosting spell.
        At the 30th season they receive the spell Strength of
        Earth, which is a strength boosting spell. So when you
        look at the Human Ranger overall, these things put
        together can make a Human just as good as an Elven
        ranger.</font></p>
        <p><a name="half"><strong><u>The Half Elf Ranger</u></strong></a></p>
        <p><font color="#000000">Half Elves are half Human and
        half Wood Elf. They share some of the best traits of both
        races. Because of their mixed heritage, Half Elves may
        begin in the jagged pine village of Surefall Glade or in
        the tree city of Kelethin. Half Elves, like Wood Elves,
        have infravision which will make night time play alot
        easier than for Humans. Because Half Elves are half Human
        and Half Wood Elf, they incure a slight experience
        penalty (although less than Wood Elves) for race.
        Overall, Half Elves have good statistics which makes them
        good candidates for being a Ranger. The most noticable
        difference is their very low wisdom score, which is the
        lowest of the three races. As you may already know,
        wisdom is the mana source for rangers. But since Rangers
        are more Warrior than Druid, this should not be a factor
        when you choose your race. Half Elves are 2nd best in
        strength, stamina and agility of the three races but they
        are the best when it comes to dexterity. Dexterity
        affects the ability to hit more accurately, which will
        definately come in handy. Dexterity also effects how
        often weapons with special procs will go off, so a Half
        Elves higher dexterity should not be overlooked. When you
        look at the Half Elf Ranger overall, they can make fine
        Rangers.</font></p>
        <p><a name="wood"><strong><u>The Wood Elf Ranger</u></strong></a></p>
        <p><font color="#000000">When you hear the name
        &quot;Wood Elf&quot;, most people picture and associate
        them with the forest, the woodlands, nature... People
        also naturely think of Druids and Rangers. Wood Elves
        begin in their tree city of Kelethin. Wood Elves have
        infravision which is a welcome bonus for night time play.
        They also have the ability to forage and hide which they
        receive at their 1st season. Because Humans are the mark
        to which all other races are compared, Wood Elves recieve
        an experience penalty. Wood Elves have, argueably, the
        best statistics for Rangers. They have the highest
        agility and wisdom scores of their counterparts. Having
        high agility increases your chances to avoid hits along
        with melee skills of dodge, parry and reposite working
        and going off. High wisdom means more mana, which is
        definately helpful for when you want to heal yourself or
        someone else after a hard fought battle. Wood Elves have
        the 2nd highest dexterity but the lowest strength and
        stamina. Rangers, at the 30th season, receive the spells
        Strength of Earth, which increases the strength score and
        Invigore, which helps to restore stamina. So this should
        help to improve your character and make him comparable to
        any of the other races. So when you take a look at the
        Wood Elf ranger overall, they too can make fine Rangers.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#000000"><img
        src="gif/bar.gif" width="399" height="10"></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000">Well hopefully the preceding has
        given you a good and impartial look at what each of the
        three races has to offer. All three races can make fine
        Rangers. With the spells that rangers recieve and with
        magic equipment that is out there, any of these races can
        be just as good as any other. THE most important thing in
        choosing your Ranger is to pick a race that you will be
        happy with. Too many times people make a character that
        they are not happy with. If you can find a race that you
        are comfortable and happy with, you will be sure to enjoy
        much success as a Ranger. </font></p>
