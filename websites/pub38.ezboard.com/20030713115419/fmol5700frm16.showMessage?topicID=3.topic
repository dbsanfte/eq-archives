This is the third Prayer Shaw Quest. You must do the first two before doing this. Ask Borannin &quot;What chore?&quot; and he will start you on the third quest. <br>
<br>
Loremaster Borannin says 'Ahh, some fine specimens indeed, Dyllwin . I will have the best of these mounted at once, wish me luck in the contest! Here is the Cloth Prayer Shawl of our people. Before I forget, the council has issued yet another [chore] for you to complete. <br>
Your faction standing with Coldain got better <br>
Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better <br>
Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse <br>
Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse <br>
You gain experience!! <br>
<br>
You say, 'What chore?' <br>
<br>
Loremaster Borannin says 'The council agrees that you have demonstrated a disdain for our enemy, the Kromrif, that rivals our own. They now ask that you demonstrate your loyalty to the Dain by humbling yourself and serving our people. Give this, my seal, to Mordrin. He will instruct you further. <br>
<br>
Borannin tells you to go to Mordrin, but that is a typo, he really means Mordin, the guy in the butcher shop. <br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Mordin Frostcleaver' <br>
<br>
Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Ah, hello there, and welcome to me shop, Halfling. Ye'll have to excuse the mess but I've been havin a bloody good time here lately. . . HAR HAR, ye get it? Anyways, thanks to you offlanders I now have a selection of some exotic meats never afore seen here on Velious. In addition to supplyin' the freshest meat in Thurgadin I also offer tasks to would-be hunters in the wastes. <br>
<br>
I gave Mordin Borannin's seal and he said the following. <br>
<br>
Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Hullo Dyllwin , I see you've signed on for a bit of food service eh? Well we can always use an extra pair a hands here dat's fer sure. First things first, warsh yer grubby mitts an cook up dinner fer good ol Leif. Shouldn be too tough fer ye, he has simple enough taste. Make him a Tundrabear sandwich an lemme know when he's been fed. Dontcha ferget ta give him this with his meal. <br>
Your faction standing with Coldain got better <br>
Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better <br>
Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse <br>
Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse <br>
You gain experience!! <br>
<br>
He gives you a napkin named &quot;Leif's Napkin&quot; is No Drop. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What is a Tundrabear Sandwich?' <br>
<br>
Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Dat's easy, ye just take a slab a dat Tundra Kodiak meat and a jug a sauce, put it in da oven, den combine the product with a loaf a bread in a mixin bowl an there ye be. <br>
<br>
Get a Tundra Kodiak meat, put it in oven with sauce and make &quot;Saucy Kodiak Meat&quot; (name?). Put your creation in a mixing bowl with one loaf of bread, which Mordin sells, and combine. If your skill is high enough you get the sandwich. Turn this in to Guard Leif with the napkin and get a &quot;Used Napkin&quot; back. It is also No Drop. <br>
<br>
Give the used napkin to Mordin and get the next part of the quest. He needs you to make some Snow Bunny Stew for Trita Coldheart (name?). You get &quot;Trita's Napkin&quot; (No Drop). <br>
<br>
You say, 'What is Snow Bunny Stew' <br>
<br>
Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Simple enuff, getcherself two hunksa Bunny meat and a jug a sauces. Stir 'em in a mixin bowl, then put spices and two flasks a water with it and cook it in a pot. Mmmm, zesty! <br>
<br>
The tough part here is finding a mixing bowl. I searched several cities including Thurgadin for a mixing bowl or even a mixing bowl sketch or mold. I finally found one in a shop in North Freeport near the bank. I don't recall the shop name though  <br>
<br>
Once you mix the ingredients in the bowl and get your &quot;Saucy Rabbit&quot;(name?) you put that, one spice, 2 flasks of water and a pot into the oven to make the stew. The pot can be made with the smithing skill, and maybe even pottery, although I hadn't worked on that at this point. <br>
<br>
I gave the stew to Trita with the Napkin and received a dirty pot in return. I gave that back to Mordin and was given the next part of the quest. <br>
<br>
Next you need to createan Ulthork Meat Pie for Brita. You receive Brita's napkin, No Drop. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What is Ulthork Meat Pie?' <br>
<br>
Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Hmm, lemme look that one up. Been awhile since I made one. Here we are, two Ulthork meats, a vinegar and a spices in a mixin bowl. Put yer meat mix, a clump a dough, an a pie tin in da oven an yer good ta go. <br>
<br>
This requires 2 Ulthork meat, and the problem here is that if you're not careful you will eat the meat. Most of the items you need to collect or make are edible. I know the kodiak meat and bunny meat do not get eaten, but everything else seems to disappear if not below your food in your inventory. I could not find any snake eggs in Thurgadin for the clump of dough, so I ported to Misty Thicket to get them. The pie tin is another stumbling block here unless you are good at smithing and pottery, or you have a friend who is. To smith the Pie Tin you first need to make a ceramic lining, so your pottery has to be trained somewhat. I had relatively good success with a 25 pottery, whereas my smithing is in the low 100's and I don't think the pie tin is trivial to me yet. Luckily the pie tin, and the pot in the previous step, are regular items that anyone can craft and give to you if you lack the proper skills. <br>
<br>
Turn the pie and the napkin in to Loremaster Brita in the back of the Library and receive a dirty pie tin which you take back to Mordin for the final step in this quest. <br>
<br>
The final task is to create a Snow Griffin Souffle. The person you are making this for is none other than the Grand Historian Thoridain himself, so it has to be made well. I have worked my baking up to 115, and I don't remember the souffle being trivial to me. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What is Snow Griffin Souffle?' <br>
<br>
Mordin Frostcleaver says 'This one's a bit tricky, ya toss four snow griffin eggs and a pack of spices in de oven. Ye must bake it just right or it's all gunna be wasted. When yer done bring it to Thoridain and if ye did it right he'll give ye his special seal. Just show Borannin that seal and yer shawl and he'll know that yer finished in the kitchen. <br>
<br>
So now you need 4 Griffin eggs. I had never seen any drop up to this point, but I haven't killed alot of Griffs either. I set out and with a little help was able to get 4 eggs to drop in about 3 hours. It would have gone faster, but I had trouble finding the Griffins. All in all I'd say we got the 4 eggs in about 12 - 15 Griffins, maybe even less. <br>
<br>
Once you've made the souffle turn it in to Grand Historian Thoridain with the napkin. Here I learned something useful. I forgot to turn in the napkin when I turned in the souffle. In my excitement in creating the souffle I had completely forgotten. I was about to petition that he had eaten my item when I realized the forgotten napkin, so I gave him the napkin and to my suprise it worked. <br>
<br>
Grand Historian Thoridain says 'My compliments, Dyllwin , what a wonderful dish! Please accept my personal Seal as a token of my appreciation. May it give you power over your adversaries. <br>
Your faction standing with Coldain got better <br>
Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better <br>
Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse <br>
Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse <br>
You gain experience!! <br>
<br>
He gives you his Seal to give to Borannin with your second Prayer Shawl. Now here is the toughest part of the quest. I looked at the Seal thinking it would be some no stat item, to my suprise I found it is an incredibly nice item, I think better than the Frozen Orb everyone is farming in the Eastern Wastes. Stats are AC 3, Wis +3, Int +3, SvCold +3, Sv Magic +3 and Mana +30. I hesitated for a moment, but finally turned it and my Prayer Shawl in to Borannin thinking I could do the quest again to that point to get the Seal. <br>
<br>
Loremaster Borannin says 'Well done Dyllwin, the council will be impressed with your effort. Here is the woven prayer shawl, wear it with pride. I know there is talk of great plans for you, be sure to come back and ask me what the council has [brewing]. <br>
Your faction standing with Coldain got better <br>
Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better <br>
Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse <br>
Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse <br>
You gain experience!! <br>
<br>
This is the best part of the quest. I looked at my inventory to check out the stats on the shawl. It is as expected, one better on each stat over the second one, just like the ring quests. What shocked me, however, is that along with the third shawl I also received back from Borannin the Seal of Thoridain. So with this third quest we get two items. The shawl, which has not quite reached the level that I would switch it out for what I have on, and the Seal which is an incredible nice item. <br>
<br>
Here are the recipes for the food/things you have to prepare for the shawl quest.<br>
<br>
Tundra Bear Sandwich<br>
1. Combine kodiak meat and sauce in spit/oven<br>
2. combine the results plus bread in a mixing bowl<br>
trivial: 80<br>
<br>
Snow Bunny Stew<br>

<br>
This is the fourth Coldain Prayer Shawl Quest. <br>
<br>
After you finish the third quest, Ask Loremaster Borannin 'what is brewing?' <br>
<br>
Loremaster Borannin says 'Ahh yes, good to see you again Maeve . I wish it were under better circumstances that we meet today. For <br>
some time now we have sent teams of our finest rogues to gather intelligence for the Dain. Tanik Greskil is one of our best. He was recently sent into the heart of Kael Drakkel on a very important mission and has not returned. He is now long overdue, and fearing the worst, our wise council has asked me to dispatch a rescue party to determine what has become of him and return him to safety. I have decided to give you this opportunity to build upon the trust you have earned from the council. Will you accept this mission? <br>
<br>
You say, 'i will accept this mission' <br>
<br>
Loremaster Borannin says 'The council will be pleased to hear of your acceptance, Maeve . Scour the regions surrounding the city of the <br>
Giants. Discover what happened to Tanik and, if possible, return him to Thurgadin. If you are successful, remember to hand me your woven shawl. We seem to be running low on them, but I must say Mordin has never had so much help in the kitchen. Anyway, I will eagerly await word of your findings. Good luck, and may Brell protect you. <br>
<br>
If you wander around the Eastern Wastes near NEG 6644 POS 4337 you will hopefully eventually see a message &quot;the snow crumbles away revealing an injured coldain&quot; or something like that. This reveals Tanik Greskil. <br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Tanik Greskil' <br>
<br>
Tanik Greskil says 'Outlander! Thank Brell you've found me! I am the last surviving member of my unit. Our mission was somehow compromised, the bloody Kromrif knew just where to find us... I can't imagine how they knew. I was barely able to escape with my life and wandered into a trap here. I am badly hurt and need your help. <br>
<br>
You say, 'i will help' <br>
<br>
Tanik Greskil says 'Quickly, give me a vial of Veluim Vapors so I can return home, I am in desperate need of some attention from our clerics. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what is velium vapors' <br>
<br>
Tanik Greskil says 'Drat! Are you telling me you don't have one with you? Run back to Thurgadin at once and speak with Frundle, she can make you one. I will do what I can to stay alive. I may need to move about a bit to keep from being discovered. Hurry now outlander, you're my only hope. <br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Frundle Frenkler' <br>
<br>
You say, 'what velium vapors' <br>
<br>
Frundle Frenkler says 'Ahh, you come seeking my family recipe? After all you've done for our people it's the least I can do. First you must fashion a velium vial, then combine the vial with two small pieces of velium in this jar. That's all there is to it. Please keep the recipe a secret. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what velium vial?' <br>
<br>
Frundle Frenkler says 'I'm no potter mind you, but if I remember correctly it's a small brick of velium, three crystalline silks, and two glass shards. Then you'll have to finish up by firing it in a kiln with a high quality firing sheet. <br>
<br>
Small piece of velium and small block of velium can be looted on Ry’Gorr Minors in Crystal Caverns <br>
<br>
Crystalline Silk can be found on spiders in the same zone. So basically, Up to here, it’s rather easy. <br>
<br>
1) Combine a small (7 lb) brick of velium, three unstacked crystalline silks and two glass shards in a pottery wheel. You will receive an Unfired Velium Vial. <br>
2) Combine the Unfired Velium Vial and a HQ firing sheet in the kiln and receive a Veluim Vial (yes they misspelled it). <br>
3) Combine the Veluim Vial and two unstacked small pieces of Velium in the Velium purifier. The Velium Purifier disappears and you are left with a Vial of Velium Vapors. The vial is a lore item and has one charge of gate to Thurgadin. <br>
<br>
The vial is trivial at skill 130. <br>
<br>
Do not camp the spot where Tanik Greskil is… because i did it, and got A message: You have been ambushed by frost giants! And two Komriff Death Squad will spawn, and try to kill you. <br>
<br>
When you get Tanik Greskil to spawn again… just hand him the vial <br>
<br>
Tanik Greskil says 'Thank you,Rassal . I shall be eternally grateful to you. Should you ever require my assistance I pledge to you my aid. Please deliver this to Borannin, it is imperative that he deliver this to the Dain at once. Farewell for now outlander... <br>
<br>
You gain experience!! <br>
<br>
Then head back to Thurgadin and hand Boradinn the note and your old shawl, for the new shawl. <br>
<br>
Loremaster Borannin says 'Words cannot express our gratitude for your deeds outlander, you have saved a hero of our people from certain death. Please accept this, the Fur-lined shawl, as a token of our sincere appreciation. You are indeed among the most highly regarded Humans to set foot in Thurgadin. The next time we meet be sure to ask me how to further advance your reputation with the coldain. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=339628">Aliane Vi'Ephemeral</a><BR>Cleric Mistress of Masters of Legend</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=1a1a1a><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/ualianeone.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aliane One</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Evil, nps!</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#A0B0E0>(9/21/02 3:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmol5700frm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Shawl #5</span><hr size=1> Silk Coldain Prayer Shawl <br>

This is the fifth Coldain Prayer Shawl Quest. <br>
<br>
After completing the Saving Tanik Quest, say 'What can I do to further advance my reputation with the coldain?' <br>
<br>
Loremaster Borannin says 'Dilani ! Thank Brell you're here. I was about to send one of my Lorekeepers looking for you. It appears that the information Tanik acquired is most perilous indeed. The Dain has called an emergency session of the council and I must attend. We don't have the luxury of waiting for an appropriate task to arise, you must advance as soon as possible. Unfortunately, I have neither the time, nor the components to fashion the next few shawls for you. Ask Rexx Frostweaver about the prayer shawl and follow his direction carefully. <br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail Rexx Frostweaver' <br>
<br>
Rexx Frostweaver says 'Hmmm, ye be one o them offlanders, don't ye? I've heard some strange tales o yer kind so don't be tryin' any funny business with me. I know the value of a platinum piece and I'll not get cheated by yer foreign coin. <br>

Rexx Frostweaver says 'Gather five strands of crystalline silk thread and combine them in a <br>

Five pieces of glowing crystalline silk sewn to your fur-lined shawl will yield a beautiful silk shawl.

<br>
<br>
<br>
This is the sixth prayer shawl quest. You need to do the first 5 before this one. <br>
<br>
You need 1 Woven Giants Beard, 2 Siren Hairs, 2 Manticore Manes, and 2 Drakel Dire Wolf Whiskers. <br>
<br>
First go to Betti Frostreaver and say 'What embroidered prayer shawl' and she will hand you a pattern that is used for the 6th step. <br>
<br>
Next go to GD near the Wizard Spires near Eastern Wastes zone and kill the Wolfs that pat around there. Most of the time you'll find someone killing them for faction with the Codian. It's a semi-common drop but is No Drop. While your killing those Wolfs /Auc your buying a Woven Giants Beard. It is Lore so most of the time someone will let you loot one off a giant or will give you one if they sell it to you the common price is about 50 plat for one. I got both whiskers in about 20 mins and the beard during that 20 mins. Also you can sometimes find a beard on a merchant they sell for about 130 plat. <br>
<br>
Next zone over to Eastern Wastes this is where a Tracker is helpfull. You need to hunt down 2 Manticores and hope they drop there Manes. The Manticore Mane is dropable so you can purchase one if your lucky. Or find a merchant selling one, I had to hunt for mine. Manticores roam the entire zone but are most common near the Great Devide zone area but are still semi-uncommon to find normally only 2-3 are up in the whole zone. Out of the 6 I killed I got 4 manes. Took about an hour to kill 4. BTW these are blue to a level 49. And, was a hard Fight for my Ranger that is really twinked up. Easy if your planning on kiting it since most of the people that are doing this quest are casters. <br>
<br>
Lastly, killing Sirens. Head or Gate to Colbolt Scar. There is 2 main areas these are at that I know of behind the Skyshrine ramp down at the waters edge you can see 3 from above + 2 in the water a little bit deeper. And near the Sirens Grotto Cave underwater there is 4 guarding the cave. These are NOT Fun. Bring a group with you if you can. But always remember your friends will turn on you FAST. These things are Enchanters and will Charm your friends and turn them on you as well as nuke you hard. So it makes pulling hard for them. <br>
<br>
Now that you've collected everything you need place the beard, 2 manes, 2 whiskers and 2 hairs into the kit. This will make a Thread. Now place your thread, the 5th Shawl and the pattern your got eariler and combine. This will make your 6th Shawl. If you fail you will get your 5th shawl back.  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=339628">Aliane Vi'Ephemeral</a><BR>Cleric Mistress of Masters of Legend</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=1a1a1a><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/ualianeone.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aliane One</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Evil, nps!</span><br>  Posts: 55<br> <font color=#A0B0E0>(9/21/02 3:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmol5700frm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=7>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Shawl #7</span><hr size=1> Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl<br>

Betti Frostweaver says, &quot;Spectacular artistry! I doubt I could have done better myself. You’ll have to forgive me, I know time is short and I tend to carry on. This is the pattern for the making of a rune sacred to our people. It will be our final test of your craftsmanship and will put many of your skills to the test, but I trust you'll find the finished product to be more than worth the effort. Show Gilthan the silk shawl, he will set you on the path. May Brell always be with you outlander.&quot; <br>

Gilthan Brittleblade says ‘So, you’ve been chosen to attempt the rune, eh? Been ages since anyone’s even made an attempt. The rune represents the very essence of our people, our culture, and our religion. Take a sea shell runed with enduring breath and a small brick of velium and grind them together in a mortar and pestle. Add water to the powder and model the rune. Fire the rune with water and the best of firing sheets. Show the product to Trademaster Kroven.&quot; <br>

[Give Trademaster Kroven: Blank Rune] <br>
Trademaster Kroven says, &quot;Fine piece of work there, Verdandi, especially fer an outlander. Now yer gunna need to make a burin to etch the rune with. Once that's done ye need to kneel in the chapel and recite this prayer with total sincerity in yer heart. If yer plea be heard by our Father Brell he’ll bless ya with the knowledge necessary to carry on. With that knowledge you'll take the blank rune, the burin and a fletching kit to etch the rune. Show Grimthor the etched rune and he’ll guide you from there.&quot; <br>
[Receive: Prayer to Brell &amp; Blank Rune] <br>
You say, &quot;What burin?&quot; <br>
Trademaster Kroven says, &quot;You’ll need a fletching kit and a fair bit of skill for this one, Verdandi. Round up a tooth from a swordfish and attach it to an Ulthork tusk wrapped in a Molkor hide.&quot; <br>
<br>
[Give Grimthor Brewbeard: Etched Rune] <br>
Grimthor Brewbeard says, &quot;That looks about right. You’re moving along well outlander. Next you’ll be needin to brew up a sacred ink to fill the grooves in your rune.

<br>
[Give Talem Tucter: Velium Etched Rune] <br>
Talem Tucter says, &quot;I’ve heard of your mission, Verdandi. I must admit that I had my doubts you’d make it this far. The rune’s creation is nearly impossible for even the most skilled of Coldain craftsmen. You should be exceedingly proud. Many have attempted this feat and nearly all have lacked the skill, faith, patience and persistence that is prerequisite for what destiny holds in store for you. You are now ready to use this pattern to construct the sacred rune’s casing and complete the runed shawl.&quot; <br>
[Receive: Casing Pattern] <br>
You say, &quot;What casing?&quot; <br>
Talem Tucter says, &quot;Combine two platinum bars, a small piece of velium and the casing pattern in a Jeweler’s kit. Take the completed casing and the rune and combine them in the same kit. When this is done all that’s left is to tailor the rune to the shawl with the pattern. Take the finished product to Borannin, I’m sure he’s eager to speak with you.&quot; <br>

Runed Sea Shell: The shell that you need only drops off of sirens in Siren's Grotto and has one charge of Enduring Breath. There is a necklace that drops in Cobalt Scar and maybe also in SG that has multiple charges of EB, but it will not work. Likewise there is a shell also called a Runed Sea Shell that drops in CS that has charges of Cloud. That also will not work. You need the item called a Runed Sea Shell that has one charge of Enduring Breath. They are not no drop, so buying them might be a good option if you cannot get a group sufficient to tackle the sirens in SG. They're not easy. Because I was given my shell, I did not have to fight the sirens so I cannot give any firsthand info on how to find and fight them. I do know that they are at the bottom of the well and cannot be pulled out of the water to the area above the well. You must go down to them to fight them, although I believe it is possible for a sufficiently high level person to single pull them away from their spawn locations. They are tough and the shell is a somewhat rare drop. If you have trouble getting one to drop or getting a group together to attempt them, try auctioning in the zone. At least they have no use outside this quest, so you have a reasonable chance of getting one from others in the zone who get one and don't need it. <br>
<br>
Small Pieces and Small Brick of Velium: See the Fourth Shawl Details for suggestions on how to get these. <br>
<br>
Etched Rune Pattern or How do I use this stupid Prayer to Brell?? First, go to the Temple of Lore and stand facing the stage. See how there are steps on either side of the stage that lead up to it? Go stand in the area to the left of the stage at the base of the steps on that side. Then recite the prayer that Trademaster Kroven gave to you. Make sure you are saying it in /say and without any misspellings. You will get the message &quot;You have been inspired!&quot; and the pattern will appear on the ground in front of the stage...NOT at your feet . There are reports that it is on a two hour timer, so it is possible that you might do everything right and still not get inspired if someone has done it within two hours of you. Try coming back later. For reference, since you can't read the prayer scroll and type it at the same time, it is:<br>
&quot;Oh Brell, Thank you for protecting me and seeing me through my trials. Forgive me for the things I think and say and do that displease you. Please reveal to me your will and bless me with the patience and obedience to do that which you desire. Amen.&quot; <br>
<br>
Swordfish Tooth: These only drop from the swordfish in Siren's Grotto. They are found in a few different places, but are often in the company of the seahorses. Seahorses are are quite a handful because of their nasty stuns, so I recommend going for the spawns up top where it is possible to single pull one swordfish. Using invis, from the West Wastes zone follow the tunnel turning right when it branches. When you reach the open area, hug the right wall and move up to the edge of the water. The little corner of land against the wall next to the water is reported to be a safe spot if you sit all the way back. There may be more critters in the water than just the one swordfish, so plan accordingly. You'll probably have to move out into the middle of the pool to get close enough to pull, so be careful to watch the wanderers that come near the water out there. Also while pulling and fighting, be careful not to get too close to the two static spawns on the far side of the pool opposite our little ledge. My group of three 54+ took out the fish but it was a tough fight. We fought on the underwater ledge at the base of the little waterfall, but tried to stay away from the far side of it to avoid agroing the static spawns just across the water. The tooth does not drop every time, but they are reasonably common. <br>
<br>
Ulthork Tusk: Ulthorks are found in East Wastes and in Siren's Grotto. The tusks are tradeable but fairly valuable because they can also be turned in to one of the Othmir in Cobalt Scar for a quest that sometimes results in a high end gem reward. This is good because it means people might hang onto them and not just destroy em immediately, but it also means that they might cost you a bit if you try to buy. Ulthorks are very common in Siren's Grotto, but are also much tougher. So, if you're in no particular hurry and want some exp, that's a great place to try. The ulthorks in East Wastes are equally common and much easier, so that's a faster source. I was given my tusk so I never had to actually hunt for it, but my understanding is that while they're not common, you shouldn't have to kill hundreds. I believe they are most common in the northeast portion of East Wastes. Just follow along the water north from the bridge. <br>
<br>
Molkor Hide: Here again I was given my hide so I don't have any first-hand experience with getting one. As far as I know, molkor are only found in Siren's Grotto where they are very common. The hides are tradeable and not good for much else, so you could probably get one from other folks if you can't round up enough troops to do them yourself. I don't know how exactly how common they are, but the friend who gave me mine gave me five all at once, so I'm guessing they're not terribly rare. <br>
<br>
Iceclad Cutlass Fish: These must be fished out of the water in the Iceclad Ocean but can be fished even if you start with 0 skill. In order to fish, you must buy a fishing pole and some bait from one of the many vendors in any given city that have them. You have to use a skill hotkey out of the banks of hotkeys that come premade, same as the ones for kick or hide or forage. Equip your fishing pole in your primary hand, stand in front of water, hit your hotkey, and if you have any bait on you, you will swing your pole. After a pause of maybe 20 seconds or so, you will get a message saying whether or not you caught anything, and if you did catch something it will appear on your cursor. In addition to fresh fish, you will also sometimes get tattered sandals, rusty daggers, or fish scales from fishing in any zone. Some zones also have other special things that you can fish up. For our purposes, in Iceclad the only special thing will be the Cutlass Fish. You may get a lot of junk and fresh fish before you get the ones you need, so just keep trying and eventually you'll get them. In Norrath as in anywhere else, fishing is a hobby best suited to the patient. So sit back, pop open a short beer, and contemplate the waves. Of course, you might first want to find somewhere relatively out of the way from wandering mobs to avoid any unpleasant interruptions. Sometimes you might lose your bait, and each time you catch something you will use up one bait, so be sure to bring along at least a few stacks, maybe even a whole bag full. <br>
<br>
Royal Kromrif Blood: Get thee to Kael, and bring along some help. The blood only drops off of either of the two Iceshards, Klaggan Iceshard or Vorken Iceshard. I have not yet had the pleasure of meeting either of them, but I am told they spawn in the &quot;Keep area&quot;. Klaggan is on the throne and Vorken is to his right. They apparently have long respawn times compared to the other giants in the area, and both sometimes have placeholders up. They do not always drop the blood but it is quite common. If the giant has any on him, it can be pickpocketed by a non-kos rogue with very high skill. Pickpocketing always runs the risk of creating agro, however, so make sure your rogue is aware of the danger and prepared to flee. I am told that if it is successfully pickpocketed the giant's loot table will eventually reset after an unknown period of time, perhaps half an hour or more. It seems that a sufficiently talented single group of level 55-60 can crawl their way to the area and kill these giants. A 60 wiz friend of mine also had a 60 shadowknight feign-pull one of them to the zone where the two of them killed it. So it seems that the giants themselves are not as much of a problem as getting to them. The blood, however, is not no drop. So, if you cannot find a way to get it off the giants yourself, you can always try to buy. I am told that the going rate is 5k though, so that won't be an option for everyone. This is the ingredient that holds up the seventh shawl for most folks. <br>

Rubbing Alcohol: The only source of rubbing alcohol in all of Norrath is the Mortician, a necromancer in Cabilis. Yes...Cabilis. I'm not entirely sure what special relationship the coldain have with the iksar, that an ingredient for their sacred rune is only available in Cabilis. *shrugs* Directions paraphrased from Scirocco on the message boards: &quot;West Cabilis, near the Temple of Death in the NW. If you approach from the south, switch to the east side of the canal as you enter the large area with the temple. On the right side as you head north is a two story shop. The Mortician is on the second floor.&quot; Easy enough, right? If you're not an iksar, go put an iksar friend to work...or make some little newbie's day with a tip for some quick fetching. <br>

Hand Loremaster Borannin your 7th Shawl.<br>
<br>
[Give Loremaster Borannin: Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl]<br>
Loremaster Borannin says, &quot;Incredible! Never before has an outlander been skilled and determined enough to craft our sacred rune. You are now worthy of the Dain’s most perilous task. You should seek an audience with the Dain immediately. Show him your Runed Prayer Shawl; he will give you the task that has been prepared for you. If the Dain is away show your Shawl to Chamberlain Krystorf and he will call for him.&quot;<br>
[Receive: Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl] <br>
<br>
If the Dain is not up...<br>
[Give Chamberlain Krystorf: Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl]<br>
Chamberlain Krystorf says, &quot;One moment the Dain has been waiting for you. I will call for him.. oh here he is now, show your shawl to him.&quot;<br>
[Give Dain Frostreaver IV: Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl] <br>
Dain Frostweaver IV says, &quot;Ah Trewayn. I was hoping to see you. We require your skilled hand. The Armory is overtaxed preparing armor for the war that we are preparing to wage on the Kromzek. We need you to help them by creating some Field Plate for a mission that is near to execution. Go see Loremaster Solstrin in the Hall of Ancestors, give him these orders. He holds the lore recorded on how to make the field plate. Return to me when you have completed a Standard Issue Kit.&quot;<br>
[Receive: Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl &amp; the orders from the Dain] <br>
<br>
<br>
[Give Loremaster Solstrin: the orders from the Dain]<br>
Loremaster Solstrin says, &quot;So, the Dain needs your assistance with the Field Plate. The Dain must trust you a great deal to impart the wisdom of our armor creation to you. Here are the tomes. The first details how to make the basic armor, the other details how to begin [working with gemstones]. If the Dain is asking you for them you should place them in an [Issue Kit]. May Brell guide your hand friend, good luck to you.&quot;<br>
[Receive: two books] <br>
<br>
You say, &quot;What about working with gemstones?&quot;<br>
Loremaster Solstrin says, &quot;Aye, gems are placed within the armor. Brell is pleased with this fusion of ore and gem. The combination produces a sturdy piece of armor. You will need some Etching Tools to work with the gems. If you ask Meg Tucter for a set, she should have some lying about.&quot;<br>
You say, &quot;What about the issue kit?&quot;<br>
Loremaster Solstrin says, &quot;The Standard Issue Kit is what we issue to soldiers at the beginning of their mission. I have this empty one here. Place a complete set of Imbued Royal Velium Armor into it before you give it to the Dain.&quot;<br>
[Receive: Issue Kit] <br>
<br>
You say, &quot;I need a set of Etching Tools&quot;<br>
Meg Tucter says, &quot;Oh, really? There are not many around that work in faceting gems. I am surprised to see your interest. You can have this old set of mine. There is no need to return them, Talem recently made me a new sturdy set. Brell bless him.&quot;<br>
[Receive: Etching Tools] <br>
<br>
[Give Dain Frostreaver IV: Coldain Standard Issue Kit]<br>
...some conversation presumably ensues...<br>
[Receive: Approved Issuing Box] <br>
<br>
Dain Frostreaver IV says, &quot;Excellent work Adorean. If I didn't know I would assume this was made by our most skilled artisans. You must hurry, General Bragmur has formed camp in Iceclad. Take the kit to the General, he had to drudge forward without any armor. His [mission] must be a success if we hope to successfully defend Thurgadin against the Giants.&quot;<br>
You say, &quot;What mission?&quot;<br>
Dain Frostreaver IV says, &quot;After General Bragmur has equipped the armor you have created for him, give him these orders. He is a skilled diplomat and will need to reach the pirate Gnomes. We must enter into a pact with them. We will supply them with the velium that they need to build their silly gadgets, and they will take their ship back to Antonica and call for reinforcements from our ancestors. We hope they will accept this pact, after all Brell has been known to align himself with Bristlebane whom the Gnomes of Iceclad follow. You may be an important [factor] in their success&quot;<br>
You say, &quot;What factor?&quot;<br>
Dain Frostreaver IV says, &quot;I fear that spies lurk in every corner. You may need to help the General reach the gnomish camp if the Kromrif has gotten word of our efforts. You should call on any allies that you have to assist in case they ambush you. Brell bless you Adorean, good luck.&quot; <br>
<br>
You say, &quot;Hail, General Bragmur&quot;<br>
General Bragmur says, &quot;Please keep yer voice down I am busy here. If you do not mind I would ask that ya kindly leave.&quot;<br>
[Give General Bragmur: Approved Issuing Box]<br>
General Bragmur begins to put the armor, &quot;Finally the Dain has gotten word of my arrival here. I await his final orders before proceeding.&quot; <br>
<br>
[Give General Bragmur: Expedition Orders]<br>
General Bragmur says, &quot;The final orders, follow me closely! I pray that the Kromrif have not learned of our plans to align with the gnomes.&quot; <br>
<br>
{General wanders off, waves of fighting with wolves and giants ensue....} <br>
<br>
Commander Vjorik shouts, &quot;The tracking wolves have found the Coldain! To the South West, Charge him!&quot;<br>
Commander Kvarid's corpse shouts, &quot;Arghhhh! Though you have felled me your plans shall not succeed! Rallos will destroy you all for invading our lands!&quot; <br>
<br>
{...when you've successfully reached the gnomes...} <br>
<br>
General Bragmur says, &quot;Lo there gnomes! Tell me is your camp located nearby?&quot;<br>
Ratop says, &quot;Yar ye scruvy bearded dwarf, just over tha hill there.&quot;<br>
Ritap says, &quot;Arrrrrrrrrrr!&quot;<br>
Captain Nalot says, &quot;Hrm? Who is scuffin' around out here?&quot;<br>
Captain Nalot says, &quot;Arrrrrr what is it ye want?&quot;<br>
General Bragmur says, &quot;Well ya see sir, we have a surplus of Velium that we would not mind sharing with you for yer tinkerin' but would ask a favor in return for it.&quot;<br>
Captain Nalot says, &quot;Velium eh? Well there matey lets hear what you have got to say!&quot;<br>
Adisson Stubblechin says, &quot;Arrr. Ahoy there, ya hull-faced, landlubbin', mast rats! Keep them beady eyes open! Remember, yer mean, nasty, pirates! Keep yer eyepatches square as a jig and yer rapiers sharp as a barnacle!&quot;<br>
General Bragmur says, &quot;I represent the Dain in this matter, we would like for you to use yer Icebreaker there to head to Antonica and bring reinforcements for the war that is preparing to ensue. We are needin' all the help we can get against the Kromrif.&quot; <br>
<br>
{Avatar of Below spawns.} <br>
<br>
Avatar of Below's voice echoes through the area. &quot;The efforts to help the Coldain and bring them together with the gnomes of Iceclad is quite impressive. There will be no doubt that they will continue to increase in power until they can overtake the Giants of Zek. Hey there, what is that on your shoulder?&quot;<br>
[Give Avatar of Below: Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl]<br>
Avatar of Below holds the shawl up close to one eye to look at the rune sewn into it. He smiles to himself and then drops it to the ground and places one hand on it. A bright blue glow starts to emanate in the snow, then there is a sudden flash! The Avatar has dissipated. All that is left behind is the Shawl lying in the snow, shimmering with a new power. Verdandi slowly bends down to pick it up, and is infused with a blessing from Brell.<br>
[Receive: Blessed Coldain Prayer Shawl]<br>
General Bragmur says, &quot;I must go tell the Dain of these events immediately!&quot;<br>
Captain Nalot scratches his head, &quot;Yar ya do that ya crazy Coldain.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
Detailed Instructions<br>
<br>
So basically, you make up this 8-piece set of Royal Velium armor via the recipes above. (Don't forget to make two bracers.) You make the velium rings and folded sheets out of ore drops in Velketor's and Crystal Caverns (see the 4th shawl writeup, it drops in the same places as the small pieces and bricks). You then have to collect the Unrefined gems from the Shimmering Geonids in Wakening Lands. Turn each Unrefined gem into a Faceted gem. Combine each faceted gem with the right piece of armor for the Imbued Royal Velium armor to combine in the quest box and turn in to the Dain. If by some feat of smithign you manage to make it this far before I have removed the bajillion warnings from the top of this page and the Quests message board, then of course it might be a good idea NOT to turn it in to the Dain yet. He'll probably find your carefully constructed armor just as tasty as all those 7th shawls he's eaten so far. <br>
<br>
Velium Hound Fur: Velium Hounds are found out in Western Wastes. Preliminary reports are that the fur is a fairly common drop, maybe 1 in 4. They probably share a spawn table with the other animals in the area so if they're rare you could try killing other stuff. <br>
<br>
Unrefined Gems: These drop from the shimmering geonids in Wakening Lands. They are No Drop. They do not seem to drop from any geonids but the shimmering ones. However, every single geonid drops a gem, diamond, emerald or sapphire, so you shouldn't have to kill the poor, innocent things for ages. Hopefully they'll put in a quest or something to get gems without killing them, for those of us who prefer not to hurt geonid faction. <br>
<br>
General Bragmur: You will find him to start the action bit at -3400, 9000 in Iceclad. Reports are that his pathing is a little odd, he will sometimes disappear and then reappear as he is walking, so don't panic. It might be reassuring to have a tracker in case you lose sight of him entirely. As you travel, you will encounter five waves of attack from the giants and their wolves, each attack progressively harder. It sounds like three groups of 55+ are required at the very barest minimum. Remember that you will also be agroed by all the green wolves and giants and obnoxious dervishes that you encounter that happen to be wandering the zone. It might be good to have a few folks as the designated greenie brigade to help keep them out of everyone else's hair while fighting the real nasties. Please give those nasty dervishes a whack for me, while you're at it. <br>
<br>
First Wave: (-3550, 7550) 4 Kromriff Tracking Wolves spawn and attack. These cannot be snared or rooted. Unsure about stuns or mezzes. The wolves are not difficult. <br>
Second Wave: (-2200, 7250) 4 Frost Giant Skirmishers spawn and attack. They hit for 178 max I believe and were again easily dispatched. <br>
Third Wave: (-1100, 5950) Commander Kvarid and 3 Frost Giant Skirmishers spawn and attack. (They spawn on the General.) They cannot be stunned, mezzed, rooted or snared. The Frost Giant Skirmishers are 55ish, and Commander Kvarid is 57. <br>
Fourth Wave: (1500, 2250) 5 Kromriff Tracking Wolves spawn and attack. <br>
Fifth Wave: (3700, 2650) Commander Vjorik and 5 Frost Giant Skirmishers spawn and attack. (They spawn on the General.) <br>
