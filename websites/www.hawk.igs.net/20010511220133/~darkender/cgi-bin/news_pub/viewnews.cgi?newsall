<p><strong><font color="#000000">*** *** *** VOTE RESULTS *** *** ***</font> </strong><small><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;Posted Friday, May 4, 2001</small></font><br><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">To: The Members of Darkender Bloodline<br><br>On April 16th 2001, a guild meeting was held in the Desert of Ro. At that meeting, a vote ballot was tabled by Lord Dumarr. The ballot presented the possibility changing our Guilds Alignment, and had the following 3 choices:<br><br>-#1 Erude Necromancers and Erude Shadow Knights will be allowed to Join Darkender Bloodline.<br><br>-#2 All Races and Classes will be allowed to Join Darkender Bloodline.<br><br>-#3 Keep the Guilds Alignment and Role Playing Status as is.<br> <br>The vote was tabled because some members have expressed the idea of changing our guilds role playing position, which currently requires that 1): You must be an Erudite, and 2): You can not have dedication to evil gods. The latter meaning, Erude Necromancers and Erude Shadow Knights are known to spread pain and choas, and are therefore not welcome in our family. <br>If you attended the meeting you would have witnessed good arguments and views from both side, those proudly opposing any change, and those that who strongly felt a change would be benificial. <br><br>The outcome of the votes was as follows:<br><br>Member Votes:<br>#1 = 9 Votes<br>#2 = 3 Votes<br>#3 = 8 Votes<br>--------<br>Total 20  <br><br>Officer Votes:<br>#1 = 6 Votes<br>#2 = 0 Votes  <br>#3 = 6 Votes    <br>--------<br>Total 12<br><br>----------------------<br>Grand Totals Votes  32<br><br>It is also important the note that of the 12 Officers that voted, 7 are Council Members. <br>The outcome of Council Votes were: <br><br>Council Votes:<br>#1 = 2 Votes<br>#2 = 0 Votes<br>#3 = 5 Votes<br>--------<br>Total 7<br><br>As Lord Dumarr explained before the vote: "The final decision" to change the guilds alignment would rest wisely at my hands as your guild leader. I have carefully studied the results and have come to this conclusion: <br><br>In the best intrest of our Guild, At this time We must remain as is, without change to membership requirements. The vote indicated a 50/50 split feeling on changing who we are, "A Unique Guild" with Members and Classes that are well respected in Norrath. By allowing Dark Classes, we do face the possibily of seeing a complete change in our Role. In other words, We could change into a major dark evil force. I do not oppose this possibility, but I do feel, it should require a clear majority vote with a 60/40 or 70/30 Win ratio. Because then, the change would be honored gladly by all family members. <br><br>At this time,<br>I'd like to thank all of you who took the time to attend such an important meeting, for expressing your views, and voting.<br><br>I also ask that everyone remain together as One Family, One Bloodline, with One Mission: To spread goodness and rid norrath of its evil tyrants.  <br> <br>To the Officers,<br>Please in your daily quest and adventures continue to enroll new members. Our strength lies in growth.         <br><br>Sincerely, <br>Cinque Darkender<br>Guild Leader<br></font></p>

<p><strong><font color="#000000">IMPORTANT NOTICE !   PLEASE READ !!!</font> </strong><small><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;Posted Thursday, February 1, 2001</small></font><br><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">As you know, On February 1st 2001, Verant will wipe the Mithaniel Marr server of all guilds. Guild Leaders were instructed to petition, so that their guilds would be "marked". I have taken the necessary steps to ensure that we are "Marked" as a very active and participating guild on the server. This process only ensures that we are not required to re-apply as a new guild and such. What this means is: We will be required to reinstate all Officers and Members!  This task will require great team work and effort to run smoothly. Therefore, All Council, Officers, and any Members who are able, Please gather in FreePort City area on February 2nd, for this exercise! I also ask that All Officers print out the Members List from our home page and Once you regain your Status, Please concentrate your time on re-inviting members. <br><br>Lets have great team work and success with this challenge!  <br><br>Good Luck! & Thank you!<br><br>Cinque Darkender<br>Guild Leader</font></p>
