<br>
Stanley McBarnette<br>
<br>
She nearly fell on me, an elderly woman<br>
unconcerned w/blending in & set out to succeed in bus-riding:<br>
getting about on her own steam,<br>
side-stepping her nurses, drivers, and other paid companions.<br>
<br>
Ifnot her cane, the Guerlain,<br>
the walking-suite & other finery gave her away:<br>
A self-imposed mass-transit experiment,<br>
seeking the boundaries of self-reliance.<br>
<br>
Anonymously exploring New York's corners,<br>
the universe was w/hcr<br>
as a movement jolted, dropped & delivered<br>
her to the seat below her fanny.<br>
<br>
Releasing vertical bars,<br>
her face turned screwy trying to conceal<br>
chills in the moment of success;<br>
her smile busted wide leaving the Upper East Side,<br>
riding crosstown & feigning familiarity.<br>
<br>
