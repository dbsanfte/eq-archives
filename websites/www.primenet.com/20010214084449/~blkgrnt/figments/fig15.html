<br>
I've put myself away from myself for awhile.<br>
I've set aside the writing, the reflecting,<br>
the self seeking the self for the sake of creating.<br>
<br>
I'm giving my mind a Caribbean vacation. Floating<br>
on a blue tide of dreams, I'm suntanning my imagination.<br>
I drift effortlessly, warm water washing my senses.<br>
<br>
It's all indulgence here. Exotic drinks.<br>
A new handbag. Duty-free perfume from the airport<br>
kiosk. It's bellboys and taxis and a private<br>
cabana on the white sand.<br>
<br>
But the tropical convergent zone is starting<br>
to heat up. Pressure is dropping; the sky is changing.<br>
Far, far off, I can see the indigo of a storm.<br>
<br>
And now I feel the wind picking up, ruffling<br>
the paper on my desk...<br>
<br>
