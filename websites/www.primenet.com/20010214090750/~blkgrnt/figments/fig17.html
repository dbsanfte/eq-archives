Tears Fall Silently <br>

<br>
	My vision of the future was always so bright, <br>
	But I did not know that I had no vision.  <br>
	I saw not the rocks on the road nor the thorns on the path.  <br>
	I have learned through my life the hard way.  <br>
	But now I do see, as I walk this desert, <br>
	A deep and wide river ahead of me.  <br>
	But a friend who cannot swim is by my side, <br>
	Shall I stay, or leave her behind?  <br>
	I look across and I faintly see, <br>
	That there is no one waiting for me.  <br>
	But I am drawn to cross this expanse, <br>
	For I see my goals and all my dreams.  <br>
	I then turn and look to eyes that are filled with love, <br>
	And so curious as they look deep into my own.  <br>
	And then I turn, and as we walk, I hold her hand, <br>
	Not knowing faintly whether to let her go.<br>
	<br>
	For across that river are all my dreams, <br>
	All the person that I've ever wanted to be.  <br>
	I see faintly so many things I've wanted to see, <br>
	And fantastic places that I've dreamed to go.  <br>
	At the water's edge she stands still, <br>
	Hoping so much that I will turn.  <br>
	For I have left her there all alone, <br>
	And I have entered now the great unknown.  <br>
	And with herself exposed to all, <br>
	Her eyes will show their tears.  <br>
	And I will hear when she lets it fall, <br>
	Even though, a tear falls silently.  <br>
	For in that tear I can hear the sadness, <br>
	Across the miles that lie between us.  <br>
	For in that tear is all our love, <br>
	And I know she will hear mine also.<br>
             <br>
