<h3>DESCENT<br></h3>
<br>
Christian P. Knoeller<br>

<br>
For centuries no on noticed the opening:<br>
this gap in the ground<br>
little more than ledge.<br>
<br>
Maybe one day you meet strangers here<br>
preparing to descend together and<br>
they ask you along.<br>
<br>
In borrowed overalls, you run a rope<br>
around your belly, through<br>
the legs and with<br>
<br>
a clever hitch your body becomes a counter-<br>
weight in this primitive clockwork<br>
of lives descending in the dark.<br>
<br>
The first pitch is vertical:  suspended,<br>
you grasp how fear and trust are<br>
tethered to your gut.<br>
<br>
The creatures here are curiosities:  blind<br>
as bats yet listening to what<br>
you do not know.<br>
<br>
In this lightless place, anything human<br>
could offer comfort, even old coals<br>
cold as death yet<br>
<br>
all you find is mud, stone, the occasional<br>
crevice where water<br>
pools.  The group<br>
<br>
gathers to watch sightless fish dart,<br>
enchanted by bright reflections<br>
of head lamps, flamelike<br>
<br>
against the contours of this inverted<br>
world.  By now, the only way back<br>
is to remember.<br>
