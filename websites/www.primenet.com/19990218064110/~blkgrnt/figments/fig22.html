<br>
				  <br>  blind <br>
				are the Songs that are sung to the stale air<br>
				by a bird that is caged from flying.<br>
				with the raping anger of hungry oppression calling,<br>
				Calling the hair sprayed Robin to sit in its cage, chained.<br>
				    <br>mislead<br>
				Are Words that are spoken.<br>
				These spoken words damply leading,<br>
				trapping the fearful meanings of their sounds.<br>
				Those deliberate intentions translated within words.<br>
				    <br>ambushed<br>
				are Mysteries of the province written within a book.<br>
				A  Dictionary of forgotten lore having been solved.<br>
				Puzzlement's killed by acknowledgement.<br>
				    <br>cheated<br>
				Are the Tears, Rained.<br>
				Rained from the sky to a plastic chalice,<br>
				eye dripped tears enticed to sit within<br>
				the prison of a cup.<br>
				    <br>deceived<br>
				Are Friends of dust holding pervaded minds,<br>
				These digitally accomplished self contained<br>
				Acquaintances<br>
				closed off to the music of life,<br>
				their harmonys given to the Critics.<br>
				    <br>all are but,<br>
				Casts set upon a winged bird<br>
				All are trapped like a painted picture<br>
				set to a frame.<br>
<br>
