<TITLE> Kiss you when I Land </TITLE>
<BR>
<U><H3>kiss you when i land (Icarus prays to Ge)</H3></U>

<H5>
<BR>
candle's wax melts only if <BR>
you let it and i say (i<BR>
pray) that if the sun should <BR>
melt my wings away that i fall<BR>
to the soft ground, near your garden and<BR>
if i could have another wish, to kiss you when i land<BR>
<BR>
if i get too near the water i<BR>
know i'll get my wings weighed down<BR>
and i'm bound to find you <BR>
in the ocean you surround; i'll touch all<BR>
the tears you cried when you were broken and<BR>
if i could have another wish, to kiss you when i land<BR>
<BR>
however if i stay between the <BR>
burning sun & drenching sea i know<BR>
(i hope) you'll look after me and i'll find<BR>
a path to my home city and <BR>
if i could have another wish, to kiss you when i land<BR>
<BR>
that's my poem...there are MANY more where that came from; if you <BR>
would like additional information or submissions please let me know.<BR>
thank you very much for your time and consideration.<BR>
