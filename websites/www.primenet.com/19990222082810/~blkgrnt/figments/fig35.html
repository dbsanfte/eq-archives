<br>
Till the darkness lets go a path and you<br>
lift both arms, one lower so the spin<br>
begins clockwise, shapes those waves<br>
<br>
where one hand can't keep up<br>
is pulled by the other—you dance<br>
the way the earth reaches up for air<br>
<br>
takes hold one arm half foam<br>
half gills, half faster and faster<br>
as if you too would drown<br>
<br>
Let go the clear head wind<br>
squeezed from this dirt and reeling—<br>
you lift till some well<br>
<br>
reaches for one knee wobbling nearer<br>
to the other and the dead<br>
lean from this dirt stirred to exhaustion.<br>
<br>
