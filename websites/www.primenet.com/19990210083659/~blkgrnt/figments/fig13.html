The Rainbow of Life<br>
<br>

	<br>
			Helios drives his chariot across the sky, <br>
			filtering droplets with sunbursts of energy, <br>
			and I view my life through the prisms of the rainbow.<br>
			<br>
			Red can be danger, evil, rage - not parts of me-<br>
		                for red was challenge, courage, and tenacity <br>
			as I coped with poverty and sexual bias.<br>
<br>
			Orange was family, a cauldron of bubbling <br>
			laughter, vibrant, secure, while I tumbled through childhood <br>
			mischievous, sensitive, aware, and surviving.<br>
<br>
			Enduring marital violence, two stepfathers,<br>
		                reaching adulthood with its self-determination, <br>
			idealistic, optimistic - I love yellow!<br>
<br>
			The duality of majesty and fragility, <br>
			 healing meditation, silent rhythms, 	<br>			
			 green trees and I have a non-physical symbiosis.<br>
<br>
			 Blue, blue, my love is blue, and it was as Ken died, <br>
			 and Dennis, the husband, was disaster - oh, my-<br>
 			 thanks Blue Moon, for sending me a kindred spirit.<br>
<br>
			 Indigo is balancing the scales, good and bad, <br>
			 pain of childbirth, joy of motherhood, first grandchild, <br>
			 strokes, success, failure, still loved and loving...alive!<br>
<br>
			  Violet, shy purple, royalty of wisdom <br>
			  and understanding, independent, alone not lonely, <br>
			  I eased into my last years graciously.<br>
