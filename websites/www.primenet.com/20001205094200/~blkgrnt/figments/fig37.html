SIMON PERCHIK<br>
<br>
<br>
Again both hands! this pen<br>
half foam, half frost<br>
half held for its heft<br>
its breaking apart :the pair<br>
<br>
useless, my left arm<br>
the way every heart empties<br>
from just one side though here<br>
<br>
is where as if by changing hands<br>
you return to read the light<br>
and under this pen<br>
its waterfall —always two hands<br>
<br>
scrapping more paper<br>
for its grass<br>
twigs and dry stones.<br>
<br>
<br>


About Mr. Perchik’s work—<p>
