Beloved,<BR>
<BR>
She wriggles of life.<BR>
Wrapped in a palm, <BR>
pale like gypsum's<BR>
flakes of ivory.<BR>
She wriggles of life,<BR>
carved in the harsh erotics and<BR>
pews whose albumens of flesh<BR>
awe back her prescence....<BR>
<BR>
Belonging,<BR>
on her first day <BR>
belonging,<BR>
her mouth was yours,<BR>
her lips, <BR>
statutes of a testatment<BR>
of a tribe gone mad.<BR>
<BR>
Beloved,<BR>
bring me your visions<BR>
your allusion on mule,<BR>
your fires' brightest Channels<BR>
(Meshach, Shadrach, Abdenago)<BR>
your psychic, high on<BR>
wooden monocles <BR>
whose talk of <BR>
animal theism, desert terror, phantasm,<BR>
are veins in the cataclysms of her palm.<BR>
This world is <BR>
enough <BR>
my love, <BR>
tell the believers<BR>
your daughter has name.<BR>
<BR>
Faithfully yours,<BR>
</H5>
<BR>
