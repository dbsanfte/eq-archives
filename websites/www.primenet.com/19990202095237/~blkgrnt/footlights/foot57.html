<i>EDITOR’S NOTE: When Mr. Kostelanetz sent me his manuscript I really didn’t know what to do with it. I know he is a proficient, well known writer with many talents, and I wanted to make sure that his manuscript got the full attention it needed. So, as a result, I decided to keep it in it’s original form.<p></i>

<i>NOTE TO PUBLISHER: These stories are meant to be, alternately, the opening sentences  in otherwise nonexistent fictions. In this manuscript, openings are in normal type, closings are in boldface. They should be similarly differentiated in print with, say, the openings in italic type and the closings in roman type, or the openings on the left-hand pages of two page spreads and the closings on the right-hand pages. (Inventive design is encouraged.) As these fictions are autonomous, not all stories need be used, and they need not be used in the order presented here, as no opening is necessarily connected to any closing.<p></i>

He felt most comfortable in bars patronized by foreigners.
The final words we heard from him, over our radio, was, "Pooh poe, eenie meanie mynie moo."
Not unlike other acquaintances who appear in my novels, she was reluctant to tell     anyone that her life served as a model for a character of mine.
      	That was his last trip; never would he leave home again.

 	Wherever a pile of money can be perceived, recognized or discovered, mice will invariably gather to nibble.
The ceiling above my head is buckling, the cracks extending in several directions. She transformed her appearance, as well as everyone's perception of her,

The direct descendant of twelve generations of rabbis, he felt the need to free

Challenge me, and you'll see whether I can, in fact, shoot three guns at once.

My stories will be no less true than the last fiction you've read, and no less false     either.

 	One prerequisite for her entering politics would be the creation of a false biography.
Who blundered first--man in creating God, or God in creating man?

military jet, from the fuselage to the bolts, was supplied by the lowest bidder.
