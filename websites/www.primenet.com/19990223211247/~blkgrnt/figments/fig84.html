<h3>Today, I decided to write a poem...</h3><br>
<br>
<br>
A poem of love, a poem of hate,<br>
A poem of someone's tragic fate.<br>
A poem of peace, a poem of war,<br>
A poem of old, forgotten lore.<br>
<br>
A poem of silver, a poem of gold,<br>
A poem of something really bold.<br>
A poem of joy, a poem of pain,<br>
A poem of heavy, relentless rain.<br>
<br>
A poem of life, a poem of death,<br>
A poem of someone's very last breath.<br>
Yes, I think I will write a poem,<br>
I'll just sit here and let my mind roam.  <br>                       
<br>
<br>
