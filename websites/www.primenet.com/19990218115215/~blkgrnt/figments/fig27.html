					i'm paying the price<br>
					for what i have done<br>
					wanted what i couldn't get<br>
					and she was just one<br>
<br>

					she flirted and whispered<br>
					sweet things in my ear<br>
					my friends said it wasn't right<br>
					but i couldn't hear<br>

<br>
					i thought i had found<br>
					what's right for me<br>
					but there was more to her<br>
					than what i could see<br>
<br>

					she said it was over<br>
					i could not except it<br>
					i wanted it to last forever<br>
					and she wanted to end it<br>
<br>

					i was horny one night<br>
					i needed to get laid<br>
					i raped her<br>
					late one day<br>
<br>

					i did what i did<br>
					what's more to say<br>
					i did what i did <br>
					it's time to pay<br>
<br>

					our love ended my own way<br>
<br>

					i sit by myself<br>
					with no one around me<br>
					there is nothing left<br>
					of the anger that was in me <br>
					
<br>
					they call me insane<br>
					but i don't care<br>
					age has taken over<br>
					i've lost my teeth and hair<br>

					no one knows<br>
					what's in my head<br>
					the things i've done<br>
					and the things i've said<br>

<br>
					i sit by myself<br>
					with no one near<br>
					it's quiet and peaceful<br>
					and there's nothing to hear<br>
<br>

					except for tear drops hitting<br>
					the cement floor i lay on<br>
					all the pain and guilt inside me<br>
					but still i live on<br>
<br>

					no one will care<br>
					when my death comes<br>
					just an insane old man<br>
					who's time has finally come<br>
<br>
