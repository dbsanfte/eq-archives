<br>
I stood still,<br>
the glow of the bone-hued moon <br>
burning a silhouette<br>
around my shivering body<br>
<br>
I exhaled white vapor <br>
into the  october night, <br>
scanned the sky<br>
for a scant few stars <br>
not swallowed by moonglare<br>
<br>
He crouched low<br>
among crisp leaves <br>
laced with frost, <br>
searching the shadow <br>
for food to feed a fire<br>
<br>
He moved through the night <br>
not stirring the stillness, <br>
barely breaking the icy silence<br>
<br>
We knelt opposite one another <br>
our hands together<br>
striking matches,<br>
sweeping fragile flames<br> 
beneath crescent edges<br>
of yellowed newspaper scraps<br>
<br>
We reached over rising orange-red flames <br>
and grasped hands<br>
brothers amid silent shadows frozen<br>
tending fire <br>
to hold cold<br>
dark at distance<br>
(even as the first flakes<br>
of snow encroached)<br>
etching the image into memory <br>
our dry hands clasped, evoked<br>
when the eyes alight with flame<br>
