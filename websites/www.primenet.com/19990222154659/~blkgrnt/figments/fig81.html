<br>
<i><h4>RICHARD FEIN<br></h4></i>
<br>
Growls, flashing fangs, thrusting claws,<br>
nicked hooves, drops of blood,<br>
escape---no, not quite,<br>
on the legs of one fawn are fatal stigmata.<br>
Now the leaves rustle, then silence<br>
each time the does stop.<br>
Stop, then hazard a nervous leap;<br>
leaves rustle again---<br>
stop, rustle, silence, leap<br>
as one by one the others choose wiser trails.<br>
Now just mother and fawn, a herd of two.<br>
Something lurches, <br>
and between the leaves a flicker of a vigilant eye.<br>
Now the leaves rustle, then silence.<br>
She sniffs the fawn's blood in the air,<br>
and the ever stronger stench of their pursuers. <br>
She licks her fawn's legs. <br>
She trots away. She returns. She trots away. She returns.<br>
She trots away.<br>
Now the leaves rustle, then silence.<br>
Fawn is alone, a herd of one.<br>
Hobbling fawn under the canopy shade.<br>
Shadows darken its striped fur.<br>
Standing dead still.<br>
Now the leaves rustle. A green curtain parts.<br>
Many white fangs turn red.<br>
Now a requiem chorus is sung in triumphant howls.<br>
There are no ends; there are only means.<br>
For in time, a gnawing hunger will always tease a full belly.<br>
And the stalking fear will again worry the ears of the hunted.<br>
Restless claws, restless hooves,<br>
restless leaves. <br>
<br>
                                     <br>
<h2>OVERVIEW</h2><br>
<br>
Viewed from on high and with a quick glance,<br>
leaf cutter society is damnably perfect.<br>
We see, we admire:<br>
the aesthetics, the smoothness of motion,<br>
the seeming harmony within the corporate,<br>
and above all, the cleanliness.<br>
But a patient, eye to eye view<br>
would discern the chaos in the particulars.<br>
Half the leaves are cut the wrong way,<br>
landing far from the main procession.<br>
The abandoned green treasure rots brown,<br>
as the ant stream winds through invisible banks.<br>
Those leaves hoisted by the society<br>
are not banners parading in linear progression,<br>
but markers of endless cul-de-sacs, wrong way turns, wasted efforts.<br>
Look closely, look long, and observe--<br>
all that matters to this earthbound world<br>
is that the Queen is fed <br>
and drops of rationed nectar touch the sterile workers' mouths.<br>
The exhausted ones are disassembled<br>
and quickly carted away.<br>
High above, we, the highly evolved observers, <br>
of course, have left such systems<br>
far, far beneath us.<br>
<br>

<h2>LITTLE ANNOYANCES</h2><br>
<br>
One roach means a hundred more hidden,<br>
an omen, like that slightest grin on my evil neighbor's face.<br>
More horrors are yet to come, but I've never felt so alert,<br>
aware that rot runs rampant behind these walls.<br>
I hear them softly crawling. If I doze I'll be overwhelmed.<br>
I use roach traps of course, dozens<br>
and poison nuggets for the scout to take back.<br>
Chemical warfare also, the spray can casts its mist across the floor.<br>
A scorched earth policy on linoleum.<br>
Cleanse my piece of the world with a new broom;<br>
if decay is swept away evil will surely starve.<br>
Now patrol, patrol. Afternoon, evening, midnight, zero hundred hours.<br>
Still awake with hammer in hand, I hear them loudly now.<br>
I flip on the light and behold that the wall is very busy with them.<br>
I pound, pound, pound, pound, and soon the wall pounds back.<br>
Crazy, I'm called crazy from behind the wall.<br>
That smirking neighbor, these are his minions.<br>
I should be pounding him. Sirens, now the doorbell rings.<br>
I won't answer. More pounding, walls, door. My door breaks.<br>
They come.<br>
<br>
With medication I have been permitted to return. Months have passed.<br>
On the kitchen wall one lone roach greets me.<br>
He must have been very patient.<br>
Sadly I must disappoint him,<br>
for when once I crusaded now I barely shrug.<br>
Zealots are crazy; I must return to the mundane.<br>
I prepare to go to my new job. First the necessary rituals:<br>
shower, shave, brush, dress, and out the front door.<br>
I hear a metallic click. My neighbor patrols his peephole.<br>
Now I'm his obsession. He's scared of me.<br>
That gives me power. I'm cured.<br>
As for my neighbor, now it's his hour<br>
to pound himself mindless<br>
at little annoyances crawling<br>
behind, on, and even through<br>
our concrete world of walls.<br>
<br>
<br>

                                      

<h2>LIVE FREE AND DIE</h2>
<br>
Never could I win the friendship of the thing.<br>
No, he wouldn't perch on my shoulder<br>
or eat seed from my hand.<br>
That damn bird cost money, plenty too.<br>
I was his master, but he wasn't my pet.<br>
Occasionally, if I held my finger out, real close<br>
maybe, maybe he would hazard a hop<br>
like a nervous bather sticking a toe into icy waters.<br>
And talking?<br>
Polly wanna cracker, ha<br>
Polly gonna bite<br>
and he hurt.<br>
He never understood me nor I, him.<br>
Perhaps something Freudian imprinted on his brain<br>
just after hatching,<br>
or maybe<br>
he just wanted to stretch his wings in a place<br>
where they wouldn't touch iron bars.<br>
<br>
Winter<br>
the cold would have killed<br>
so I wrapped a blanket around the cage,<br>
but<br>
I opened the door<br>
trying<br>
one more time<br>
for friendship.<br>
Bolting<br>
out the cage, he flew atop the bookcase<br>
then fluttered his wings against the wall.<br>
He seized the opening above the top window<br>
and perched there for just a moment,<br>
then he spread his tropic red, green feathers wide<br>
wide into the arctic air.<br>
