<h3>BARBIE GETS INTO EROTICA AND PORN</h3><br>
<br>
wants to change her <br>
name to Cherry <br>
Bubbles or Tasty <br>
Flakes wants to<br>
party to learn<br>
what turns men<br>
on and how to<br>
wiggle she's sick<br>
of her navy clothes, <br>
her nurse uniform wants <br>
a rhinestone g-string <br>
pasties that dissolve<br>
in a mouth she wants <br>
to sprawl on velvet <br>
or fur hopes<br>
someone can air brush <br>
where her legs can <br>
be pulled from her <br>
torso she wants to <br>
pose in a split <br><br>
beaver, not be<br>
a split beaver wants<br>
to be with a<br>
man who can keep <br>
wood long, be her <br>
lumberjack not<br>
a plastic pretty<br>
buy without even<br>
a flea of a penis<br>

<br><h3>
BARBIE STALKS CTOTHES</h3><br>
<br>
Instead of flesh <br>
lovers. It's expensive,<br>
yes, but less so. She <br>
drapes skin of animals.<br>
<br>
leather or suede <br>
close to her, puts on <br>
velvet, presses <br>
sequins and<br>
<br>
lace around her <br>
instead of any <br>
frozen lake eyes <br>
that could leave<br>
<br>
Her closets are <br>
stuffed, like a <br>
freezer of frozen <br>
men,just in case. <br>
<br>
Doors burst, most <br>
jackets still have <br>
their original tags <br>
on them like.<br>
<br>
stiffs in the morgue. <br>
A lot are out of <br>
fashion but are <br>
there, wait for her<br>
touch, seem to long <br>
for her, ache<br>
to cover her thigh<br>
when she looks them<br>
<br>
over pressed so <br>
close to each other. <br>
wrinkled, hard to <br>
see, she usually<br>
<br>
frowns, feels she <br>
hasn't anything <br>
to wear, heads out <br>
as if the hunt is<br>
<br>
what matters<br>

<h4>BARBIE READS OF JUDY THE PREGNANT DOLL<br></h4>
<br>
with maternity <br>
wardrobe and <br>
sensible shoes,<br>
a fashion doll<br>
with a belly<br>
that snaps off, <br>
reveals are re-<br>
movable baby<br>
that a flat<br>
tummy panel and <br>
a baby carrier <br>
come along with.<br>
Husband Charlie <br>
is sold separately. <br>
She pats her own <br>
flat mid riff.<br>
isn't sure about <br>
another slit in<br>
her skin. After<br>
all, at least<br>
one owner's jerked <br>
her head off and <br>
switched it with <br>
Ken until her <br>
mama howled. May <br>
he it's velcro, <br>
won't be as<br>
had Barbie thinks <br>
wondering if perhaps <br>
she could give <br>
birth not to a <br>
howling baby but <br>
a kitten, some <br>
thing furry she <br>
could curl up <br>
against, not need <br>
any Charlie or <br>
Ken. to stick her <br>
or suffocate, keep <br>
her trapped as when<br>
she had a rod up<br>
inside her on<br>
a pedestal her<br>
feet were in too<br>
high heels to<br>
run from<br>

<h4>BARBIE FEELS THERE IS SOMEONE ELSE INSIDE HER</h4><br>
<br>
with other schemes <br>
in her head, <br>
something buried <br>
in the dark space <br>
so long it's stopped <br>
being patient as <br>
Barbie She feels<br>
a finger giving <br>
her the finger,<br>
a yelp or howl, <br>
making a soup <br>
in her blood,<br>
tap dancing on <br>
any calmness. <br>
Those who pick <br>
her up and press <br>
her to their <br>
own lips, or <br>
crying may feel <br>
a shudder they <br>
suppose is their <br>
own. This other <br>
waits, shoves <br>
her arms up thru <br>
Barbie's throat <br>
when she sleeps <br>
like a tongue <br>
with its s.o.s.,<br>
tells stories, <br>
sings songs from <br>
the fifties even <br>
Barbie forgot <br>
she knew The <br>
night she moans <br>
for stars, weeps <br>
for lost moons <br>
she gives Barbie <br>
insomnia so she <br>
doesn't know if <br>
like a yucca, she<br>
will wait 100 <br>
years to bloom, <br>
die over night<br>
