			I cry for my people<br>
			....All my people<br>
			I don't care if you are <br>
				White<br>
				Black<br>
				Asian<br>
				OR<br>
				Indian<br>
			I cry for all my people<br>
			....Like I said before<br>
			We are HALUCINATING<br>
			It is not just the drunk man<br>
				OR<br>
			The man taking drugs<br>
			We don't have to be psychotic<br>
				OR<br>
			Under mankind's medicine<br>
			We're already under the <br>
			Influence of a DRUG named<br>
			     """LIFE"""<br>
			However "GOD" is the ONLY<br>
			     Rehabilitation<br>
			Which can cure all my people<br>
