<h3>Dark Song</h3><br>
<br>
<br>
Strange song, how you follow me!<br>
Everywhere I go is the bright blaze of your eyes,<br>
your fingers tug at my sinews and I hear the dark music.<br>
When she taught me to sing in Irish you were there,<br>
adding your forlorn coal notes.<br>
A hundred times I have heard the violin<br>
of my heart played upon, have felt the<br>
strings smoothed into music, then<br>
the pizzicato of love's dying frenzies.<br>
<br>
I no longer resist, for I<br>
am not the musician but only the instrument<br>
upon which other play their sorrowful song-<br>
upon me they play you, my pitiful tune.<br>
<br>
I once believed I would one day leave<br>
this smooth varnished body, that I too<br>
would play music upon the tendons of others,<br>
stringing and sighing over a hundred cellos.<br>
Now I know I will never ascend, even<br>
bodily, from this viola form.<br>
I am accepting of my fate, opening my throat<br>
for you, O dark music.<br>
<br>
