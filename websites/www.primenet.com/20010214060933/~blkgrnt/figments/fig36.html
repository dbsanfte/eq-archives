You cough on a pillow now, use the height<br>
and snowcovered mountainside spreading out<br>
falling off the Earth<br>
<br>
— you breathe as if your headstone<br>
had feathers, wings and on the downstroke<br>
would lift off without you the way all stone<br>
is covered with smaller stones<br>
with whispers and your lips pressed close<br>
<br>
—you hear the ground drinking water<br>
to keep your throat open, the dirt<br>
breaking into bits, into snow<br>
and stones every child learns to throw.<br>
