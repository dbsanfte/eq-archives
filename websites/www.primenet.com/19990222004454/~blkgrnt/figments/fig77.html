<b><h3>North Rim nightmare<br></h3></b>
<br>

<br>
<br>
They finally did it.<br>
Developed the Grand Canyon. <br>
Chiseled out condos along one wall. <br>
One hundred and thirty floors <br>
with high Victorian ceilings. <br>
Pointy glass elevators slide smooth <br>
along the nose of the Bright Angel. <br>
Every yuppie gets a great view! <br>
For suburban one-up-man-ship <br>
they compete with each other <br>
using extended balconies,<br>
windows, and wall ornaments:<br>
Santa Fe style shutters,<br>
imported Dutch flower boxes, <br>
rotating holiday windsocks,<br>
5.000 pink flamingos<br>
strutting up and down<br>
one side of the North Rim.<br>
Every night or two<br>
a yorkie or a siamese <br>
inadvertently leaps out a window. <br>
If the drop is under 15 floors, <br>
they end up on all fours<br>
in traction for several months. <br>
Above 15 floors<br>
they end up a chuckwalla toupé. <br>
Centipedes and scorpions<br>
come out in the spring<br>
with the snowbirds<br>
and the sun worshippers.<br>
Everyday<br>
a perfect sunset and sunrise.<br>
Let me and Rocky and Bullwinkle <br>
roll an increasing snow boulder <br>
off the nose of the Bright Angel <br>
and avalanche this nightmare.<br>
