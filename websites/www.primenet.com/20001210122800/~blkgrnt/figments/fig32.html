LOUDER PLEASE!<br>
<br>
Daniel Green<br>
<br>
<br>
Diminished hearing spares me the pain<br>
of listening to clergy fulminating on TV,<br>
to rock musicians screaming, politicians<br>
trimming lies, academics droning on and on.<br>
<br>
Some sounds I might enjoy, of course,<br>
are muffled, filtered through a drape.<br>
I must pretend I hear some speech that sounds<br>
like static from an ancient crystal radio.<br>
<br>
Small sympathy from my loving spouse<br>
who must respond to pleas of "What?"<br>
or "Say Again!" and endure the too-loud<br>
blare of radios and TV’S set at high.<br>
<br>
As with any other crutch, the hearing aid<br>
I now wear, inflicts shame, causes me<br>
to crawl meekly into a cave reserved<br>
for aging wayfarers losing parts.<br>
<br>
