Optimistic Love<br>
<br>
Aloha Brown<br>
<br>
Friends say I'm absurd,<br>
and I don't heed a word.<br>
They say I chase a foolish dream.<br>
How can they<br>
know it's May<br>
In the snow?<br>
Love is real<br>
If I feel<br>
It is so.<br>
I walk through the night,<br>
and every star is bright.<br>
No cloud can come to dim my view.<br>
Dreams may be<br>
far from me<br>
for today.<br>
But, tomorrow I'11 see you.<br>
