COVER THIS CLEAN   <br>

Cover this clean,<br>
 take the linen, the sidearm<br>
 the hazing milk chest of<br>
 grandmothers' jewels, and<br>
 lower me quickly !<br>
 waste not apprehension,<br>
 set the chore to task.<br>
<br>
 The earthy smell fell<br>
 light over our dark opposite-rains over such sweet colors as love;<br>
 the minstrel pastel,<br>
 bardavon greys,<br>
 marsupial brown.<br>
 pruned from fruition mind like kind has fed kind,<br>
 flesh fed flesh.<br>
 Confess ! the beggar hasn't heart and<br>
 too cold<br>
 is mine.<br>
