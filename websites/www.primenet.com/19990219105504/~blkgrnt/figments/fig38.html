<h3>SIX LEGS<br></h3>
<br>
<br>
Greggory Moore<br>
<br>
Six legs creeping my consciousness across the floor<br>
Quick and maliciously unaware of the future<br>
                         further than the floor<br>
                        in front and left behind<br>
and, disgusted,<br>
I step on it,<br>
smoosh and bleed.<br>
<br>
