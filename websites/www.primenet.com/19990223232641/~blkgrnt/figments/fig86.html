<h3>The New Day</h3><br>
<br>
<br>
by Ernest Slyman<br>
<br>
<br>
What good the new day without the beauty of a sunrise,<br>
The dogwoods had turned away,<br>
The mulberry bush bowed to the ground,<br>
The rose petals had told their little lies,<br>
And already the rations of hope had gone round--<br>
The wrens that usually peeped, made not a sound.<br>
Providence had come, but it had not caught on,<br>
Honesty had waged a brave, lonely battle,<br>
Something had gone wrong with the world,<br>
For the stars burned of pettiness, so pale to gaze upon,<br>
The wishes they yielded so frail, slight.<br>
An old gray battered sky hung overhead.<br>
The brightest lantern beamed in a child's eyes,<br>
One could not tell day from night,<br>
Loomed the long dull gray skies,<br>
The cornfields looked affright,<br>
For all the pretty words said<br>
Could not turn the world around,<br>
Nor lend a hand to build a sunrise.<br>
