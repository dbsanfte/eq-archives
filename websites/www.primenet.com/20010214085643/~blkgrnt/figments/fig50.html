<br>
<br>
 by   C. D. Chase<br>
<br>
  	The naked man, Octavio, combs this<br>
  	pubic beach, watches<br>
  	patient water rivulet forever seaward.<br>
  	The seagirl girt in her moistened brown <br>
   	skin shifts on sand, stretches<br>
  	lacy legs. She<br>
  	leans against dead frog-rocks<br>
  	that wait to crumble, to become sanded<br>
 	gold or queen's frankincense, One bleak-<br>
                black cloud reshifts. They<br>
 	cannot identify the shape<br>
 	it takes. The man<br>
with seven dogs<br>
unleashes his feet, running strong, like water <br>
seaward, into false tidal wombs,<br>
into dawns, into doomy<br>
grottos. This<br>
is the emptiness<br>
caught between sand-<br>
grains, the impatient death<br>
by drowning, the name for the girl's<br>
unweepings, "Tell me, <br>                      
Octavio says, "how you die, and I <br>
will tell you who you are." Collapsing <br>
his paled wings<br>
and aiming, one cold cormorant dives. <br>
The glad gulls call haven.<br>
