<body>What I need now is a glossy lens.  One that blurs the sharp edges of objects and diffuses the light. You know, like the kind they use for some of the Playboy layouts.  It takes the edge off.  My latest assignment is to photograph an egg.  I asked the instructor but I can only use one egg.  I mean, two and I can make something erotic.  A dozen and I can make a political statement.  But one.  There's the problem.  </body><p>
	<body>You'll think exactly the wrong thing, but I'11 tell you this anyway: I'd like to be a photographer for Playboy someday.  Yeah, you say, you and every other American male.  But have you looked at a Playboy lately?  Sort of like Esquire with occasional flashes of nudity.  That's the thing about Playboy though.  There's not much actual skin between the pages. For most people, that's a negative thing, that the sheer quantity of porn doesn't equal Hustler or Screw.   Number of breasts per page, I guess.  But that's what makes Playboy great.  It doesn't pander to the lowest common denominator.  </body><p>
	<body>Don't get me wrong.  I'm not an expert in adult entertainment.  I've got three issues of Playboy.  One issue--July 1994, I think--has this layout with some of the most beautiful pictures of women I have ever seen.  It's shot on a Jamaican beach, and it's very, very well done.  That may sound chauvinist-- "What about a woman's mind?" you know--but you have to admit that eroticism is a form of art.  That's my opinion, anyway.  I mean, the whole point of the arts is to make the audience experience something.  Maybe it's an idea, maybe it's an emotional response, maybe it's arousal.  But they're feeling something.  And there's a lot of ugliness in this world.  So why not accept something that's beautiful, whether it's a philosophic concept or a naked body?</body><p>
	 <body>The whole problem is that most magazines out there are ugly.  I mean brutal ugly, physical ugly, and everything else.  They're the ones that give Playboy a bad name, because that kind of ugliness is what blankets adult entertainment nowdays.  I read, well, actually look at Playboy to get away from all of the uglier aspects of life.  There are men's magazines out there that should be sold as primers for gynecologists instead of erotica.  You know the ones, they usually leave nothing up to the imagination and there seems to be some sort of two-tattoo minimum requirement for all of the models, if you can even call them that.  Even as a teenager I could see the ugliness behind all of those forced smiles, and believe me, as a rule, fourteen year olds aren't too discriminating when it comes to that.  </body><p>
	<body>But my dad had his collection of bad porn, all the Juggs and Beavers and Lusty Ladies hidden in a box behind the suitcases and blankets in the storage room.  On top of it was a box of National Geographics, which I guess was supposed to be a deterrent for anyone wondering what was in the bottom box.  I remember visiting my dad's porn box whenever I was curious or horny, but I'm convinced it wasn't nearly as often as my friends used their dad's boxes.  And then I read Portnoy's Complaint and my suspicions were confirmed.  But anyway, my dad had bad taste in porn.  I kept hoping he'd toss in a Playboy or a Penthouse not for my benefit, but so I would know he was on the right track.  It got to the point where the National Geographics were more arousing than the issue of Hot Ones dad just bought...  </body><p>
	<body>My best friend Mikey Spiezer's dad had a Playboy collection that included every issue from July 1968 to the present.  Mikey's dad--Dale, his name was--kept all the magazines in order on his bookshelf, right below, quite coincidentally, an equally impressive series of National Geographics.  But I'd come over to Mikey's and his dad Dale would talk about his Playboys right in front of us.  It was mind-blowing for a fourteen-year old, let me tell you, to be discussing the chest size of Miss March with your best friend's dad.  And Dale didn't make it uncomfortable or sleazy; instead it felt...natural.  Like there was nothing wrong with it.  And I didn't really come to this conclusion until much later in my life, but you know what?  There really isn't.  There's nothing wrong with feeling something that everyone feels in their life.  Everyone's sexually attracted to other people throughout their lives.  And fortunately we're also attracted to others emotionally and intellectually and spiritually.  It would be very boring if we were all id and nothing else.  		Sometimes I wonder about the guys who work in the adult bookstores and novelty shops. My hypothesis is this, and I've argued with a couple people about this for quite some time: if you were surrounded by mostly bad pornography for ten hours every day, wouldn't you eventually become so desensitized to the naked, often alleged erotica around you that nothing would arouse your physical interest anymore?  That's my theory.  You spend nine-to-five staring at people in various stages of undress, some beautiful, most uninteresting, a few repulsive, and after a while the novelty wears off.  Sort of like permanent residence at a nudist colony.  I mean, let's face it, there's a little bit of variation from person to person, but on the whole we're talking about pretty standardized pieces of equipment.  Pretty soon there's nothing else about the human body that holds visual interest, because you've seen ad nauseum practically everything that most people consider risque or taboo.  </body><p>
	<body>The same level of boredom sets in when you watch a really bad porno movie.  Now my level of experience with porno tapes is much more limited than my magazine experience, but I'm assuming the tapes I have seen are pretty representational of the adult film world in general.  I saw ten minutes of one at a college party where I guess this tape was playing for couples looking for suggestions of what to do after they got too drunk to carry a conversation.  Two people on the couch were doing their best to keep up with the couple on the screen.  But the problem with the video was that there was no variation, no hint of enjoyment, just two people mechanically thrusting and moaning.  It sort of reminded me of those animated lawn ornaments that just do one thing over and over, like the donkey kicking the farmer's butt.  You can mathematically calculate the number of times per minute that donkey goes back and forth, back and forth.  Well, watching that video, I started trying to count the number of thrusts.  You know you're watching a bad porno movie when your mind starts wandering to arithmetic.  The only interesting thing that happened was when the couple on the couch rolled over onto the remote, and they hit the fast-forward button.  For a minute I thought the screen couple was really breaking out of the gate, but they rolled off the remote and the movie went back to its normal, triple-X tedium.  </body><p>
	<body>The other movie I saw was something off of cable when I stayed over at a friend's house my sophomore year in high school.  Not as explicit but much more erotic than that how-to tape at the party.  I remember spending more time arguing about which movie this was than actually watching it.  The TV Guide had been thrown out and we waited until the end of the movie to find out what we were watching.  I bet money that it was part of the "Emanuelle" series and my friend insisted it was "Red Shoe Diaries."  I don't think we ever resolved that.  All I know is that an actress who looked just like Sylvia Kristel was in it.  Doesn't matter.  </body><p>
	<body>I  know that the reason so much "material" is out there is because there's a market for it all. There are the people that want the suggestiveness and the ribaldry.  Others want it all on display, the sharper and more stark, the better.  There are some who want to be teased, with words or whips or chains.  Some want fantasies so they can break free from themselves; reality kills the illusion.  Princes and warriors, savages and Romeos, rapists and angels, housewives and seducers. To each his own.  It's as simple as that.</body><p>
