<br>
<i>Robert Knight<br></i>
<br>
<br>
Some people<br>
To touch them is <br>
To invade them<br>
<br>
Some people<br>
To stand indifferent is<br>
To beckon them hither<br>
<br>
Some people<br>
To cry at their feet is <br>
To invite a restraining order<br>
<br>
Some people<br>
To unlock their door is<br>
To summon a cyclone<br>
<br>
Some people<br>
To stand out in their crowd is<br>
To splinter their skin<br>
<br>
Some people<br>
To burn down a house is<br>
To light their way.<br>
<br>
Some people<br>
To warble in rhythm is<br>
To make them believers<br>
<br>
Some people<br>
To cook them up some beefcake is<br>
To channel them a Zen master<br>
<br>
Some people<br>
To write them a poem is<br>
Fucking useless.<br>
<br>
           <br>

<h2><b>A POET IS A SOLDIER</b></h2>
<b>
<br>
</b>
A poet is a soldier<br>
and every word ammunition<br>
against what is not true<br>
what is not good<br>
He is a well-trained marksman<br>
who must aim from his heart<br>
and ignite explosions of beauty<br>
He must hit his targets directly<br>
the truth is in the crossfire<br>
the slightest misfire <br>
has dire consequences<br>
<br>
A poet is a soldier<br>
and every poem a battle<br>
the enemy field generals<br>
absurdity, fear, despair<br>
He must come up from the <br>
trenches naked to face them<br>
whether or not he defeats them<br>
is a matter of his own mind<br>
<br>
A poet is a soldier<br>
in an army of peace<br>
in a war against those who <br>
actually brandish weapons<br>
those who answer `kill'<br>
to every question<br>
those who voice their opinions<br>
by shutting the mouths of others<br>
The carnage is escalating<br>
These perpetrators have captured<br>
many of us, put us to death<br>
within our own selves<br>
But our words are more powerful <br>
than their guns<br>
And the time has come<br>
to charge<br>
              <br>
            <br>
<br>
