Mary Winters<br>
<br>
the sun is always below the yardarm <br>
somewhere<br>
they prop you up with another beer <br>
get you to jitterbug<br>
<br>
caught a glimpse in the mirror <br>
your beard's gone gray<br>
<br>
bottoms up!<br>
chin chin!<br>
down the hatch!<br>
here's looking at you, kid! <br>
skol!<br>
<br>
the smoke from a million <br>
cigars and cigarettes<br>
outside your car falls in a heap <br>
your family dies<br>
<br>
you're trapped meeting new people<br>
enchantee! <br>
pleased to mechoo!<br>
<br>
shins kicked black and blue <br>
by the Highland fling<br>
the hokey-pokey<br>
the hora<br>
the hompipe<br>
the hula-hula<br>
