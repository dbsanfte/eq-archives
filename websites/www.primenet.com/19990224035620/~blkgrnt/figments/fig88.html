<br>
Sheila B. Roark<br>
<br>
<br>
It’s not just strong, emotive words.<br>
Or a certain metered rhyme.<br>
It’s not just groups of simple words<br>
That makes it so sublime.<br>
<br>
What makes a poem so special,<br>
Is that it’s from the heart.<br>
The Poet Shares himself with you.<br>
His soul he does impart.<br>
<br>
So when you read your favorite poem<br>
Think of the poet who<br>
Gave you a very special gift.<br>
His gift of love that’s true.<br>
<br>

<b>OUR EYES<br></b>
<br>
<br>
Sheila B. Roark<br>
<br>
<br>
Liquid pools of color<br>
Are mirrors of our heart<br>
Reflecting feelings from our souls<br>
Where our emotions start.<br>
<br>
Our faces may be placid.<br>
But eyes will always show<br>
The way we really feel inside<br>
And how emotions flow.<br>
<br>
Our eyes are truly mirrors<br>
Reflecting what we feel.<br>
Shining for the world to see<br>
Emotions that are real.<br>
