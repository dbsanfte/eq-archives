I Dream Painted Turtles and Sooty Ravens<br>

muscled neck craning out of pumpkin-painted shell <br>
turtle stared lazy, blinking slow<br>
at shadows on the grass carving<br>
delicate moonlets and swift<br>
half-circles on the bright hot sands, while<br>
<br>
the wind carried loose leaves<br>
into the riverflow—<br>
breeze blew ripples upstream<br>
while the current washed<br>
the leaves downstream into the lake <br>
to be swallowed by white waves<br>
<br>
turtle raised a glassy eye<br>
to the sun and saw<br>
several ravens painted black against <br>
the clear-sky sun, churning<br>
the air with their beating wings—<br>
landing in a skeletal elm, claws <br>
tearing bark from dry branches<br>
<br>
the quick black eyes buried<br>
in the spear-like heads <br>
of the ravens flickered<br>
from above—light was swallowed whole <br>
in the rounded pits of their eyes<br>
<br>
turtle preferred the warmth of sand and sunlight <br>
to the disconcerting chill that fell<br>
with shadow, but the echoing green beneath<br>
the curling waves called above all—<br>
the weightless dreamy feeling of floating. <br>
and beauty of algae-filtered emerald light<br>
<br>
from above, sooty ravens eyed the scene levelly <br>
and turtle dropped water-ward<br>
in a single smooth motion,<br>
pulling through sun-streaming, water-broken light <br>
with smooth-clawed paws,<br>
moving toward a vague recollection<br>
of a half-remembered desire<br>
