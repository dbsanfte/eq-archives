<BR>
A self-addiction recovery group<BR>
meets twice daily in the afterworld.  Fresh escapees from life<BR>
see the cliche flash,<BR>
lacking only the lose ends tied Hollywood tight.<BR>
The vision is incomplete,<BR>
like a botched piece of pottery,<BR>
denied form,<BR>
reduced to mush,<BR>
slipping through the fingers of the creator,<BR>
who's angry over free time wasted.<BR>
In twelve steps they are taught to stop whining and deal with it.<BR>
<BR>

<P>Brief biographical information: I live in Decatur, Illinois, and I am sixteen
years old.  For the past 36 months, I have had an irregularly appearing
opinion and review column in the Decatur Herald and Review, my local
newspaper (this Thursday my most recent column, a review of the movie
"Waterworld", will be published).  I have won or placed highly in youth
writing contests on the local, state, and national levels with my short
fiction, poetry, and essays.
