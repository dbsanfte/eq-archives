<h4>THE OBSERVER<br></h4>

	<body>I grabbed her and slammed her up against the motel room closet,
the doors straining  against their hinges, and moved into her. 
We ended up on the floor and when it was over I paid her in
pesos and kicked her out.  She wanted to stay and show me the
city's crumbling night life, but I took a pass.  After washing
the smell of her off me, I went outside to sit by the pool with
my tape recorder.  The water was green, and the pool's once
white sides slimed with alga.  It lay there in a helpless state
looking up at me.  I dipped my toes in the water wishing a
strange grotesque monster would yank me in.  In the distance
there were small arms' fire and like the roll of a sick drum, a
motor shell would send people scurrying for cover like human
cockroaches under a harsh light.  The guerrillas couldn't be
more than a mile away from the city now.  In twenty-four hours
it would be over; over for the island, over for me.  I turned
the machine on and spoke into the tiny mic.  In a sick twisted
way I wanted to document these last hours; my last hours.</body><p>

	<body>I had managed to get on the last flight out of the mainland by
sweet talking my way into a ticket.  All I had brought were two
changes of clothes, a tape recorder, and my kit stuffed in my
sock.  I had come here to die.  Death was something I had
thought a lot about.  It was like a giant comet heading my way,
and no matter what I tried to do about it, and no matter how
many times I tried to get well and avoid it, I knew it was
coming to get me.  So fuck it-- why not here and now?  The palm
trees started to move in the wind and the clouds had grayed up
since I'd come outside.  It smelled like rain.  Strange, I never
knew what that meant.  I could never in all my life recall what
rain smelled like.  I remembered what it smelled like after it
rained.  A kind of damp, musty smell that always reminded me of
childhood, and all the bullshit that went with it like
appointments on a new car.  Only, in my case, I didn't get the
stripped down model.  I always got the add ons in the form of
constant crap day in and day out.  Like the time I came home to
find my mother locked in the bathroom stuffing pills down her
mouth, while my stepfather sat in the backyard laughing like it
was a joke.  I was thirteen, and I broke down the bathroom door,
wrestled the pills out of my mother's hands, scattering the
little colored capsules everywhere, and then went outside to
face this man whom I thought about killing every waking hour of
my life.  He rose to meet me and I ended up punching his fucking
head so hard, he buckled and fell to the ground.  I did six
months in the hall for it.  It was there I first learned about
getting high.</body><p>

	

	<body>The radio squawked and crashed a mixture of static and Spanish,
arching across in rapid bursts like lighting.  Outside the rain
started to come down, beating the palm tress into a gray, wet
submission.  I pulled out the works and fixed to the sounds of
the radio and rain lapsing into looseness the pain of moving air
in and out of my body and the struggle against boredom and grief
easing to the point of a dull ache wrapped in chemical gauze. 
Whenever I got high I always felt safe and warm.  It could be
thirty below fucking zero and I would have this inner glow so
intense I wanted to run naked down the streets, and one time I
stood outside a drugstore eating an ice cream cone with a sixty
below wind-chill factor.</body><p>

	<body>So fucking what?  Soon it would be all over.  All my
experiences, thoughts, wants, needs-- all gone and silent as if
they never happened.  I took a drink of rum and tracked the
amber fluid down my throat into my stomach.  Picking up the mic
to the recorder, I documented my latest thoughts on drugs and
cold weather.  Why not?  I had been documenting the sound of
things most of my life in the news business, why stop now? 
Outside the rain had let up to a light shower and the gun fire
had grown louder.  I turned on the television, but there was
nothing except static racing across the screen like gray, angry
ants.  I pulled out my wallet and emptied it on the bed-nothing
but bullshit like people's cards from the last twenty years.  I
had used them; they had used me.  We used each other because we were all
so god damn scared of losing our jobs, the roofs over our
heads-- everything.  It was all crap.  I held a scrap of paper
with a phone number written on it.  This is where it all started
and ended.  Her number, a number lost in the swirl of travel,
career, and junk.  A number I called and got no answer.  A
person who was in the arms of another someone who was there when
I never was.  I read the number into the mic and took another
hit of rum. </body><p>

	<body>I rolled over on my side facing the door.  The gunfire was
getting close now.  Life is a matter of choices and even at the
end I had mine.  Rebel radio had broadcast for weeks: any
Gringos caught in the country after the fighting stopped would
be shot.  The North was evil! Yankees no!  We were the
exploiters!  Never mind the fact someone was always exploiting
the shit out of me every time I turned around, and I exploited
other people and their miseries feeding off their tragedies out
of need for money and belonging.  I was sick of it like a huge
snake that's eaten a rat I felt bloated and sick.  How many
times had I tried to kick?  How many times had I called her and
said it would be better and things were going to change.  The
only thing that changed was the fucking landscape.  I had run
the string out all the way down to this: I could go out with a
good shot of junk, I could shoot myself, plastering my brains
all over the fucking shit stained carpet or let the guerrillas
get me.  There was a fourth option: I could pack up, run and
take my chances trying to get the hell out of here, but to what?
The continued documenting of the human condition while adding
more scabs to my arm and moving closer to jail, and more false
promises to someone I cared deeply about.  Like it or not, all
doors slammed shut and there was no way out. </body><p>
	<body>I thought I heard strange voices speaking Spanish.  There was a
knock on the door that became a pounding.  I turned the recorder
off and rolled off the bed.  The pounding continued. My options
were starting to narrow.  I backed into the tiny bathroom and
stood among the fungus infected color tiles waiting.  The last
thing I remember was the door bursting open, flashes of green. 
I yelled Fuck you, turning on the tape recorder and letting it
roll.. At last the observer had become the participant.. </body><p>
