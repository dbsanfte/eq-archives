I choked, not on schoolboyish attention-getters,<br>
but on grown-up countersurveillance:<br>
You rehashed my different responses to the same question,<br>
Noting whether I had discovered the trouble with handing over for the asking. <br>
Double-checking for ripples of dissension;<br>
If I had noticed the trouble with gasping through pin-hole nipples<br>
And trying to retrieve donated pieces.<br>
<br>
Your Adam's apple chugged, not on a sip down the wrong pipe, <br>
but extraction in gulps.<br>
Syrupy slurps and no waste:<br>
Nuclear bits of pillow-talk reserved for your arsenal;
Bones, for the dogs.<br>
And what was left—you put your wild-self on top of it<br>
to see if sexual-restraint might be my strong-suit.<br>
