The Ring<br>
<br>

<br>
Mesmerized,<br>
my gaze transfixed<br>
upon this ring<br>
so gently placed<br>
upon my finger. <br>
Brilliantly it sparkles <br>
like your eyes<br>
now locked intensely<br>
with my own.<br>
Bevels deeply chiseled, <br>
catch, hold tight<br>
and energize<br>
reflections <br>
of the sun.<br>
An ever changing<br>
dance of light<br>
this symbol<br>
of your heart's intention. <br>
Bursts of passion <br>
sometimes steady<br>
sometimes flaring. <br>
Twinkling stars of color, <br>
blue ice <br>
red heat<br>
white eternal,<br>
microcosm<br>
of the universe.<br>
Deep inside<br>
I peer intently,<br>
searching<br>
like a seer<br>
into her crystal ball,<br>
to find a momentary<br>
glimpse of future. <br>
Soulmates found,<br>
converging paths,<br>
or simply Lust's attraction?<br>
