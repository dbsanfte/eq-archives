			Come by in droves and see my angels sell, <br>
			Themselves to you, <br>
			They're all cheaper than everyone else, <br>
			That's because they're good, <br>
			You don't even have to feed them much, <br>
			They'll feed you, Slapped away their bright-eyedness, <br>
			Their chastity bruised <br>     
				Come by black and blue,<br>        
				This angel's good,<br>        
				I would buy myself if I ever could, <br>       
				Holy prostitutes,<br>       
				So righteously confused, <br>       
				Shot dead again and again after they've all been used.<br>
