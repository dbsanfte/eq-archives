Yvette Viets Flaten<br>
<br>
At times, your love is a gentle chamomile, steeping<br>
a calming infusion of the palest green liquid.<br>
Or else, it is a timid spring shower<br>
dripping meekly, apologetically, from the roof,<br>
fearing to take me unawares, full of hopeful longing<br>
that I will stir and reach and call your name.<br>
<br>
I hear the distant thunder repeat your name<br>
and I turn over, my hot night dreams steeping<br>
desire in my teapot brain; my thirst longing<br>
to be quenched by deep draughts of your liquid<br>
kisses, as harsh first drops of rain strike our roof<br>
and all my empty hours rush upon me like a shower.<br>
<br>
Escaping summer heat, I stand in a tepid shower<br>
while you mount stairs calling my name<br>
sweating in heat trapped under our gambreled roof<br>
asking if I want a glass of sun tea steeping<br>
on the back,steps. I imagine the iced liquid,<br>
made up as julep, and am filled with a genteel longing.<br>
<br>
I hear the distant geese keen their mournful longing<br>
song, as grey autumn clouds herald a shower<br>
that will fill curled leaves with shining silver liquid.<br>
On our walk, we read aloud the headstones' every name,<br>
sobering at losing each other, that fear steeping<br>
in our hearts, until life seems a treacherous rotten roof.<br>
<br>
Heavy and muffled, the snow is so thick on our roof<br>
that it brings back fits of youthful longing,<br>
of freezing days, and sleds, and snow pants steeping<br>
in whipped cream drifts, or a bright needling shower<br>
of crystals sweeping on the wind. Now I murmur your name,<br>
to wake you for your measured dose of amber liquid.<br>
<br>
They have drained your corpse of all its liquid.<br>
Coming home, I expect Death's raven atop our roof--<br>
my roof, now. I can hardly speak your name.<br>
How I longed for an extra month--an extra week--longing<br>
with all my heart, shielding from you my teary shower<br>
at watching death strengthen in you like Orange Pekoe steeping.<br>
<br>
Now I sip my tea alone, my liquid of longing,<br>
recalling that summer--the new roof, the sudden showers<br>
whispering your name, hot sorrow steeping my eyes.<br>
<br>
