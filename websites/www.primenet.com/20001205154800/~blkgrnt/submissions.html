A Note From the Publisher: Welcome to 256 Shades of Grey. Your Web choice
for fiction, poetry and essays. At this time 256 Shades of Grey has
discontinued publishing. This web site serves as a reference to the
material that was published by our 'zine. I am very happy that 256 remains
a global entity as well as a regional (Wisconsin based) 'zine. This web
site will remain up and running for those that enjoy reading cutting edge
literature. Your comments are always welcome. So all I ask for you to do
is to sit back, relax, and enjoy some wonderful reading... Happy reading.
