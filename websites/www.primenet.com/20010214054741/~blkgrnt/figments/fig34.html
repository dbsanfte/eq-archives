TO TURN INTO SOLDIERS<br>

On television, Cronkite was wondering<br>
"I thought we were winning the war."  As Lyndon ordered<br>
bombing strikes, our men in Hue were ducking<br>
for cover while firing at enemies who stood<br>
<br>
behind those ancient walls.  The chief of our friends'<br>
police shot down a bound prisoner<br>
point-blank on television news (those men<br>
would still be remembered together by many after<br>
<br>
almost 30 years).  Out on the Mekong<br>
Delta, one of our soldiers glanced at a ruin,<br>
a village yesterday— "We had to destroy<br>
it in order to save it."  As our men in choppers machine-<br>
<br>
gunned peasants running in rice paddies, one<br>
guy made an excuse— "If he's running, he must<br>
be a Viet Cong!" Meanwhile, Lyndon called<br>
for the deaths of whole cities, using bombers.<br>
<br>
As he called for the deaths of cities, using bombers,<br>
he told American kids to turn into soldiers.<br>
