Reflections  <br>
<br>
Patricia Farrington<br>

<br>
<br>
				Fading sun beyond the trees,<br>
					I sit reflecting on past months.<br>
<br>
				Disjointed sounds penetrate this, <br>
					otherwise, silent room<br>
<br>
				The world I see is in Spring,<br>
					cool newborn greens, clouds drifted in blue.<br>
<br>
				Here and there, flowers,<br>
					splashing colors, stretching into light through dark soil.<br>
<br>
				Forsythia leap skyward, and drape<br>
					earthward in molten, living sun made substance.<br>
<br>
				Love has been born of caring,<br>
					by gentle words, a soft touch, a listening heart.<br>
<br>
				Trees and flowers sun ward leap,<br>
 					while human hearts, lift to love made manifest<br>
<br>
