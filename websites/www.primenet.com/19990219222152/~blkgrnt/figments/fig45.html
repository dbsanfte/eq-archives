<h3>Passing<br></h3>
<br>
Melissa Harding<br>
<br>
<br>
Candlelight reflected in the satin's sheen-<br>
Your eyes closed in perpetual dream.<br>
Muffled whispers--we softly weep<br>
As we pass by and watch you sleep.<br>
The minister commends you to the grave,<br>
And we pray the Lord our souls to save.<br>
The bed of soil in which you lay<br>
Will give you up again someday.<br>
Rest now, my love--your work is done.<br>
Wait for the rising of the Son.<br>
