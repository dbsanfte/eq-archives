<h2>Grandpa</h2><br>

Grandma put me in nightgowns <br>
and blow-dried my hair. Grandpa bought doughnuts.<br>	
We took rides later than anyone else.<br>
<br>
He listened to the police radio for fires<br>
and we’d find them like movies.<br>
<br>
Grandma sang about birds at an animal fair<br>
and big baboons by the light of the moon.<br>
<br>
Grandpa didn’t know the words,<br>
but he’d hum them.<br>
	<br>
When grandma was dying her brain <br>
was dazed and she was calling my name<br>
mixed with others as I stood in her doorway.<br>
<br>
Grandpa sat in the basement with her pictures<br>
around him and most of him was gone.<br>
<br>
Each year made him more of himself.<br>
She was him, too. Even their faces formed<br>
into each other’s.  <br>
<br>
He kept her dresses in the closet <br>
with ties he’d never wear again.<br>
And he began to die faster than we are dying.<br>
<br>
I know grandpa is somewhere singing<br>
on the moon about baboons <br>
<br>
and grandma is humming along.<br>
