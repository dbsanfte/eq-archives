<h3>GOOD SUBURBAN SOIL</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h4><i>Thomas Michael McDade<br></i></h4>
<br>
<br>
Along route 25<br>
slow burning mulleins <br>
signal with dim<br>
yellow flame<br>
poor, compacted soil. <br>
Consider also Queen Anne's <br>
crotch-high lace<br>
by butter and eggs<br>
that wink like old neon. <br>
Chicory caps the mood: <br>
petals a blue<br>
men never find<br>
in hitchhikers' eyes <br>
they are fool enough<br>
to skid to stops for. <br>
Sunrise shovels and picks <br>
dig roadside earth: <br>
suburban transplants<br>
that never take<br>
to the straight and narrow. <br>

<h2>SABBATH CONTRAPTIONS
</h2>
<br>
Five and change<br>
for a hundred<br>
Sunday supplement tulip bulbs. <br>
To sweeten the deal<br>
six grape hyacinths.<br>
I remember<br>
a Sabbath contraption<br>
that fit any wall socket: <br>
made building or house<br>
a grand TV antenna.<br>
No more blizzards,<br>
get all channels with ease.<br>
It failed<br>
and the bulbs seem too runty <br>
to pack the thrust<br>
to spear the ground<br>
if they survive<br>
squirrels and moles,<br>
grace the earth<br>
with spindly ears<br>
like an old fashioned rabbit. <br>
But if they do<br>
likely they will<br>
receive gangs of deer<br>
as well as the fat bulbs<br>
from fancy catalogs.<br>

<h3>EASY SHRINES</h3><br>
<i>(For John Campbell)</i><br>
<br>
John and I stayed<br>
at Widow Murphy's place, summer '72.<br>
Her husband had played football<br>
for Notre Dame and one room was a shrine.<br>
We paved asphalt for a living.<br>
The foreman told Marine tales, drank Ballantine <br>
Ale his brother said he couldn't handle.<br>
Two Portuguese guys spoke no English <br>
but were artists with asphalt rakes.<br>
If they cut themselves they used old world<br>
first aid: pissed on the wound. <br>
They washed down lunch with beer<br>
justifying the quarts we chugged.<br>
We had no wheels so Maloney the owner<br>
let us take the pickup home, bed rattling <br>
with shovels, rakes, wheelbarrow, picks. <br>
Sometimes the roller was in tow.<br>
Vowing not to drive and drink we weakened. <br>
Once hit every Post Road bar from Bridgeport <br>
to Port Chester and talked a lot about a girl <br>
whose breasts rode exceptionally high and <br>
ached no doubt for calloused hands to certify <br>
true latitude and longitude.<br>
Intrigue us to the grave they will<br>
and we pray they never sagged.<br>
We almost performed classic <br>
pebbles-on-window rousing at her place<br>
but brought the foreman's brother a midnight <br>
beer instead which pissed his wife so royally <br>
we are likely part of family legend.<br>
Nearly flipped the roller driving crazy. <br>
Trailer hitch had to be welded<br>
and we lost a day to drink and shooting pool <br>
at the Wood's End Bar where we never imagined <br>
Maloney dead in a bike wreck. Who knows what <br>
became of the brothers or Portuguese rakers? <br>
John and I got schooled out of manual labor. <br>
By God, got our own transportation.<br>
We think of Mrs. Murphy and her shrine, <br>
shiny trophies, photos black and white.<br>
We understand her better now<br>
since the day the aroma of asphalt<br>
struck us like some old sacred incense.<br>
And how blessed we are that our nostalgia <br>
is the stuff that streets are paved with.<br>

<h3>THE COMBINE CONGREGATION</h3><br>
<i>(For Bill Donnelly)</i><br>
<br>
Clete Strong's green pickup<br>
had an oversized bed and a sign<br>
on a window that said CLERGY<br>
but he never guoted Scripture. <br>
The Reverend coached a project<br>
team named the Combines after<br>
a semi-pro nine he remembered.<br>
He boasted to our mothers<br>
what good kids and ballplayers we were.<br>
He was grateful for any kind of sandwich.<br>
He had a temper, threatened a couple of umps <br>
but left his Buck Knife on the bench. <br>
Flashed it for a junk dealer though.<br>
We'd filled the truck with riverbank rocks <br>
the Reverend said were pig iron that<br>
would sell for scrap to buy uniforms.<br>
The dealer laughed and we hustled<br>
our Reverend off a step ahead of the law. <br>
Shit, project kids didn't need sissy uniforms.<br>
It got worse. A lifeguard at the city pool <br>
told our shortstop the Reverend wasn't <br>
clergy which got back to him.<br>
He wiped his face with a red bandana,<br>
talked about his shotgun but calmed down <br>
enough to go out sandwich hunting.<br>
Twelve gauge is as real as his church <br>
the centerfielder said and most of us<br>
agreed but hell he was our coach.<br>
Two barrels blazed away weapon doubt: <br>
Reverend Strong settled a domestic spat: <br>
gunned the boyfriend down,<br>
claimed he saved the woman's life. <br>
He did time and the wounds healed. <br>
Really was a church, a storefront. <br>
I wasn't as good a ballplayer as<br>
the Reverend bragged to my mother for Spam. <br>
But I did go two-for-three with<br>
a game-saving catch once that summer. <br>
And if one of the gang that returned<br>
to the project after that win, cheering<br>
in the big bed of the green pickup<br>
were to dispute that performance today<br>
I wouldn't pull a gun I'd swear<br>
pig iron were gold for a chance to<br>
compare our Combine Scripture.<br>

<h3>ALABATROSSES A.K.A. GOONY BIRDS</h3>
<br>
Sailors talk<br>
to the goony bird<br>
statue on Midway<br>
and one named Fields<br>
kissed it goodbye<br>
before going AWOL.<br>
He couldn't hack<br>
Island drinking<br>
and lonliness:<br>
surrendered to San Diego<br>
Navy rehab.<br>
Another duty station<br>
guaranteed<br>
upon completion<br>
because his Midway<br>
mates whose work increased<br>
might not treat sober Fields<br>
like alcoholism was a disease.<br>
Fields shipped out<br>
on an old destroyer<br>
and sometimes standing<br>
watches he'd go on and on<br>
about goony birds<br>
being full of grace in the air<br>
but klutzes on the ground.<br>
Fields wrote a poem<br>
in therapy about them<br>
being wind swindlers<br>
flying miles without a wing flap.<br>
A kid from first division<br>
who sat on the fantail<br>
with a slingshot trying<br>
to knock off sea birds<br>
chasing garbage being dumped<br>
into the wake loved that one.<br>
He said he'd kill for a Midway tour. <br>
Fields never told on himself <br>
kissing the Midway statue<br>
until he fell off the wagon<br>
after visiting an aviary<br>
in Barcelona.<br>
