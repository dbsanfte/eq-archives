Daniel Green<br>
<br>
<br>
The man whose paunch is not disguised<br>
wears his belt to hold up his pants<br>
but also as a sling to keep his belly<br>
from slipping unimpeded to his knees.<br>
<br>
Some add an aid, suspenders, though their<br>
aesthetic worth is doubtful, serving<br>
more to emphasize the need to raise<br>
pant legs from sagging at his heels.<br>
<br>
Years ago the portly look defined<br>
a man of substance, proud display<br>
of prominence, his waddling gait<br>
a proof that he had no need to hurry<br>
<br>
Was a time when modesty persuaded<br>
men to wear double breasted blazers,<br>
even corsets, in Africa and Asia<br>
caftans and jubbahs hid it all.<br>
<br>
Nowadays, doctors, health-wise wives<br>
prescribe no-fat diets, much less food.<br>
especially for couch-potatoes, exercise,<br>
fitting into a 36 waist at eighty eight.<br>
