<h3>THE RECOVERY
<br></h3>

     Daniel stared at the television screen with unfocused eyes and 
shivered. It must be below fifteen degrees in here, he thought. He wrapped
the blanket around himself tighter and debated whether to make another pot
of coffee. Although he believed that the coffee might help warm him up
temporarily, the thought of leaving the partially heated bedroom for the
cold, drafty kitchen helped convince him to stay put. <p>
     The television blared on, but Daniel was unaware of anything but the
deepening gloom tearing away at his insides. The cold penetrated through
all parts of his body, generating chilling waves that propagated from his
feet to his head. Daniel cursed the icy winter again and again while
forcing himself to imagine the coming of spring. Once winter ends, he
thought, everything will improve.  Then I'll be able to get out and
perhaps even meet new people. In the meantime, the damp winter was static
and held little hope for Daniel.<p>
      It was now almost two weeks since Suzannah had left him. Daniel felt
abandoned, lost, even bewildered. After having lived together for five
years, he felt that he deserved more than a two-page note which lacked, in
his view, any real explanation. "I need some time to be by myself,"
Suzannah had written. Daniel knew that these were words empty of any real
content. On the other hand, he reassured himself, she didn't specifically
write that she wouldn't be back. There were times when he would read the
letter over and over, each time finding hidden meanings and hints of their
upcoming reunification. Other times, Daniel would reread the letter and
sink into despair. <p>
     In the apartment, everything reminded him of her. He would pull out
the photo albums and count the number of photographs of the two of them
together. He would take her laundry out of the hamper just to refresh his
memory of her scent. He forced himself to remember the summer nights they
had spent together watching video films and making love long into the
night. Daniel tortured himself by thinking of the last time they had slept
together; could that have been the very last time ever?  At the time, of
course, he had not known that it would be the last time. He had not even
had the slightest inkling that Suzannah would soon leave him. Had Suzannah
already known that she would leave him shortly afterward? If so, how could
she have responded to him? Was it all an act? If she hadn't yet planned to
move out, then how could she possibly sway from love to indifference in
such a short time?<p>
     
                                                

     The days went by ever so slowly. Daniel found it difficult to get out
of bed in the morning. Once he had risen, he couldn't wait to get out of
the flat. The dark, empty quiet of the apartment bothered him deeply.
However, once he arrived at work, Daniel would already be waiting
anxiously for the end of the day. At home, he would reason that she would
call him at the office. When he received no call from her at the office
all morning, he began to persuade himself that she would not make such a
personal call to him at the office. He would ache to go home and check for
calls on his answering machine. In the evening, the cycle would reverse
itself.<p>
     Work was both a burden and relief for Daniel. At times, he was able
to concentrate on his job and push his suffering away from his conscious
mind for minutes and sometimes even hours. However, little things would
always force him back to self pity and reliving his current troubles. The
radio would remind him of the weekends when they used to listen to
concerts together. The ring of the phone would cause him to jump with a
mixture of despair, hope and irritation. Even his workmates would serve as
a constant reminder that he was now alone while most of them were married.<p>
    One evening Daniel sat huddled on his bed with the television on,
wishing over and over for the telephone to ring. "In Zaire," the news
anchorman read swiftly, "another fourty-three people were reported to have
died after contracting the Ebola virus. World Health Organization
officials warn that unless effective quaratines are maintained, the spread
of the virus may be imminent".<p>
     Daniel thought to himself, "I wish I would die from this Ebola virus.
Perhaps if I were being buried she would feel something for me". Daniel
caught himself quickly and realized how warped his perception had become.
No, I don't want to die yet, he thought. It's amazing how little the
deaths of tens of Africans mean to me. In fact, if the devil himself were
to give me a choice between saving the lives of fourty-three sick,
anonymous Africans, or saving my marriage, I probably wouldn't hesitate
long.<p>
     "In our studio this evening, " continued the mellifluous voice of the
anchorman, "we have with us Professor James Stenton, director of the
Department of Viral Illnesses and Internal Medicine at Kyle General
Hospital."<p>
     "Good evening Professor Stenton".
     "Good evening Dave".
     "Professor Stenton, what are the chances that the outbreak of the
Ebola virus in Africa could lead to the penetration of the virus into our
country?"<p>
     Daniel thought, "They're no better than I am. In fact, they are
worse. I can admit at least that in my present state I find it extremely
difficult to pity anyone else, even those who are physically suffering and
in life-threating situations. At least I'm not hypocritical. Noone else
really cares what the hell happens in bloody Africa either. All they're
interested in is whether this virus has any chance of getting into our
country and directly affecting us."
<p>

                                              


     Spring finally arrived, bringing with it erratic weather. Daniel's
moods seemed to emulate the untamed seasonal weather. He had some good
days where Suzannah could be totally forgotten, but there were also those
difficult days where Daniel didn't feel as though he had any reason to
climb out of bed in the morning. Nevertheless, the days gradually became
longer and brighter, and Daniel could feel that his life was slowly
starting to come together again. <p>
     Two separate building projects that Daniel had designed had been
highly acclaimed and Daniel's boss had hinted that there were three more
tentative plans to be drawn up. Daniel thought that it was amazing that
any of the plans he had drawn up over the past three months could possibly
have been good; he only vaguely remembered  sitting with the clients and
plotting the designs. He now felt a professional pride that even during
those dark times he had still been able to go through the motions of work
and even succeed to a reasonable extent. <p>
     During this period, Daniel began to invest more time at work; since
things were going well, he began to feel very comfortable at the office
and to enjoy both his work and his steadily-improving reputation. In
contrast, the improvement in Daniel's personal life was much slower. He
still hadn't moved out of the apartment even though he conceded to himself
that after three months, there was not much chance of Suzannah returning.
Although it was logical to find a smaller, cheaper place, Daniel could not
yet break away from the apartment emotionally. Most of her belongings were
still on the premises. If he were to give up the flat, he felt that he
would relinquish any remaining hope of their getting back together.<p>
     With the coming of spring, Daniel slowly began to take interest again
in various sports and recreational activities. He played tennis with Bob
now and then at the tennis club, and was invited to Sally and Jim's place
for dinner. He began to feel a very strange sensation of freedom; there
were no parties that he was obligated to attend, and it was easy to
politely refuse any unwanted invitations. Nevertheless, he felt that these
feelings were only a small consolation for the loss of a relationship that
he would readily have renewed.<p>
     One Monday morning at the office, Daniel was pouring himself a cup of
coffee when Tim, the computer analyst, remarked, "You're really burned,
where have you been?"<p>
     Daniel replied, "I went on a two day hike with a couple of old
friends. We forgot to bring sun screen with us. Does it look that bad?"<p>
     "I think it'll peel off quickly, but you better stay out of the sun.
Speaking of the sun, I saw Suzannah at the beach on Sunday with Martin
Stuhl. Have you guys got your divorce yet?"<p>
     Daniel felt the current shoot through him like a bolt of lightning.
It was as though he had a thousand migraine headaches all at once sweeping
through his forehead, each pang at a different phase and giving him a jolt
of pain that racked his skull. <p>


                                                  


     The next few weeks were living hell for Daniel. He couldn't even
remember how he had gotten home and to bed after Tim's naive observations.
Daniel could recall very little of the two weeks that followed; he got out
of bed for only the most basic necessities. The most routine procedures
became tiresome struggles; it was difficult to chew food and swallow, to
shower, shave and even brush his teeth. <p>
     Sally helped by bringing over some home-cooked meals and literally
forcing Daniel to swallow a few mouthfuls. Jim came by almost every day
and tried his best to talk to Daniel, but it wasn't easy. After a few
days, he decided that professional help was needed and brought a
psychologist friend over to Daniel's flat. <p>
     "How's he coming along?" Jim asked the psychologist when he came out
of the bedroom after the fifth meeting.<p>
     "He'll be up on his feet soon, but it's going to take some time until
he gets back into peak form. After his wife left him he underwent a
tremendous shock, but managed to suppress most of it. Unfortunately, he
did that by building up what we call 'false hopes' that his wife would
return. Can you believe that more than three months went by since his wife
separated and it never even occurred to him consciously that she might
have left him for someone else or at least begun a new relationship".<p>
     "He never talked about her anymore. I really thought that he managed
to overcome the separation by now".<p>
     "Well, he had overcome the separation, to some extent. On the other
hand, he still harboured hopes of their getting back together again. As
long as he blotted out any thoughts of Suzannah becoming involved with
anyone else, he could still maintain a thread of hope. It's like the old
saying: what you can't see can't hurt you. However, when at work someone
mentioned that he had seen Suzannah going out with somebody else, the
bubble burst. The main aim now is to make Daniel face the reality that
Suzannah isn't going to come back to him. At least it certainly doesn't
look as though she will. As soon he he is able to bear the pain of this
reality, the process of healing will be faster."<p>
     

                                                

     As the weeks wound by Daniel slowly began to return to his daily
routines. Work was piling up up at the office, and the three weeks he had
been at home added extra pressure to the daily workload. However, he was
beginning to catch up and felt that things could only improve from here
on. The constant workload was good for him, in a way, too. It gave him a
sense of self esteem that had been sorely lacking since Suzannah had left
him. At least in the professional world he felt worthy of respect.<p>
    Daniel finally began to feel that he was starting to accept the change
in his life. It was like the death of a family member; at first there was
a period of denial, and slowly it begins to sink in. Daniel even started
to consider looking for a new apartment. He wrote down several promising
telephone numbers from the newspaper advertisement section, but couldn't
yet bring himself to call. <p>
     The tennis matches with Bob were renewed, and Daniel even went out
for dinner with Sally, Jim and a recently divorced friend of Sally's.
Unfortunately, that evening didn't work out very well. Sally's friend was
a fashion designer and Daniel was unable to feign any interest at all in
her work. On the other hand, Daniel felt that this was nevertheless an
improvement; at least he was 'rejecting' a potential relationship for the
right reasons, and not because of any attachment to Suzannah. He could
even 'prove' to himself that this was so; he found himself quite
interested in the new graphic supervisor who had smiled at him several
times from behind her coffee in the conference room at work. He made a
mental note to ask her out to lunch next week.<p>
     Summer arrived and Daniel wondered when Suzannah would finally come
to collect her things from the apartment. He was now actively looking for
a new place and didn't feel that he wanted to carry any of her possessions
to his new flat. He wanted to start fresh. He thought to himself, if she
can't face me herself, then let her send some of her friends- if she
hasn't abandoned them too. He caught himself speculating how it would be
to speak to her after all this time. She would probably be somewhat
embarassed, he thought. After all, she ran out on me without a word and
hasn't made contact in over five months. Is that normal?  Daniel imagined
how he would handle such a meeting. He could imagine her voice on the
other end of the line, 'Hello?'.<p>
     Daniel could hear himself answering in his detached, icy cool,
professional voice, 'Yes?'. Daniel practiced the inflection on the word
'yes' so as to give nothing away. The word was repeated over and over in
Daniel's mind, each time with more and more nonchalance. He didn't want to
give her the slightest satisfaction in thinking that he was or ever had
been waiting to hear from her. He would be so formal, that anyone
evesdropping would never have suspected that they had lived together for
five years. In fact, it would have been difficult to suspect that he even
knew her at all. Alternatively, Daniel considered taking a gentle,
forgiving tone, such as one is used for reprimanding a generally good
child who has done something bad. Daniel would say to himself, "Yes,
Suzannah, how have you been?". It was a difficult choice to make, but
Daniel knew that either way, such behaviour by him would show Suzannah
that he no longer needed her.<p>
     One evening Daniel was starting to organize his possessions for the
upcoming move when the telephone rang. Daniel picked up the phone and said
"Hello?".
    "Hello, Daniel, it's Suzannah".
     No planned response could compete with Daniel's heavy emotions.
"Please," he cried out, "come home Suzannah. It's not too late. I'm sorry.
We'll start again; it'll be better this time, I promise..."<p>
     Daniel ranted on and on and didn't even notice that the line was
dead.<p>
