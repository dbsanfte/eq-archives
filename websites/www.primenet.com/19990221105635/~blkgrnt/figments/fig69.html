 <h3>New Cross </h3><br>
<br>

<br>
You showed me
your new cross<br>
i didn't believe<br>
that you saw jesus on it<br>
fixed to the smooth gold<br>
in obligation and in pain<br>
<br>
He was naked<br>
there was no cloth<br>
his penis white with the cold<br>
his vagina bleeding tears<br>
<br>
Where is my faith<br>
that i cannot believe<br>
that on a cross<br>
pressed against your skin<br>
jesus could suffer<br>
and be denied?<br>
