The clouds lift<BR>
revieling the inevitable.<BR>
I realize all that was hidden<BR>
and all I tried to forget.<BR>
The truth hurts<BR>
but lies kill,<BR>
and that's all my life is<BR>
a lie.<BR>
Like a knife <BR>
burried deep in my soul<BR>
that to leave in would mean<BR>
pain for eternity,<BR>
but to remove<BR>
would mean certain death.<BR>
I realized all you're doing<BR>
is plunging the knife<BR>
deeper into my soul.<BR>
Not trying to save me,<BR>
as I was decieved to believe,<BR>
but trying to kill<BR>
and control me.<BR>
To mold and shape me,<BR>
into your eternal slave.<BR>
You dare not let me taste<BR>
the sweetness of freedom<BR>
so that I think of this damnation<BR>
as a freedom of your own devising.<BR>
I know no better,<BR>
so I follow your contorted plan.<BR>
But now my eyes have been opened<BR>
and I see you for the evil you are.<BR>
And all I can say is <BR>
no longer shall you rule me,<BR>
for if you even try to throw me <BR>
into the fiery pit yourself<BR>
with my newly found knowledge<BR>
you must surely know that<BR>
I will drag you kicking and screaming<BR>
with me into the fiery abyss<BR>
with a smile of triumph on my face<BR>
and together we shall meet our demise.<BR>
