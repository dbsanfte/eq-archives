<h3>LAKE EFFECT<br></h3>
<br>
Christian P. Knoeller<br>
<br>
<br>
We blame the worst weather on this inland sea,<br>
saltless, intractable, churning up storms<br>
or the updrafts that cause shorebirds to soar,<br>
<br>
transcendent, toward sunset.  Boats capsize<br>
and people shrug:  maybe the foolhardy,<br>
but who knows the whims of wide water?<br>
<br>
When glaciers backed off, before fireweed<br>
found a toehold on gravel, these waters<br>
were wider still, yet the stakes<br>
<br>
remain the same:  Before setting out,<br>
hold a hand under up to the wrist until<br>
cold turns pure pain.<br>
<br>
Let that hand guide the paddle.<br>
