
<h2>do you remember<br></h2>

<br>
Do you remember<br>
when you squeezed <br>
my skin until<br>
my bones creaked? <br>
It was a cool summer bloom;<br>
my hazel eyes <br>
needed to see <br>
the red spiral <br>
of yours as we rushed <br>
into a green feeling <br>
then slowed to a heart <br>
beat, my hands <br>
cupped in yours.<br>
