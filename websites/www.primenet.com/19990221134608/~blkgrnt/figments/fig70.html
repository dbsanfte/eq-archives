<h2>Puppeteer<br></h2>

<br>
The goofy little orange thing<br>
prances about. <br>
It lopes around, eliciting
smirks or giggling.<br>
<br>
A keen eye just might<br>
<br>
see the strings manipulating<br>
the thing<br>
might follow the string<br>
<br>
up to the fingers <br>
twisting and pulling on the strands<br>
hopingfor a laugh.<br>
<br>
A keen eye just might<br>
<br>
follow the strings of these hands<br>
up to the eyes<br>
of the puppeteer<br>
and see the faintest twinkle or tear.<br>
<br>
A keen eye just might,<br>
<br>
but I doubt it.<br>
Most of the people I know <br>
must wear glasses.<br>
