	<body>It was in a Spring of rainy skies when the leaf and Font were
born, on the exact same minute of the exact same day, and yet
they never met, socially or for whatever terms of business they
may, in some obtuse circumstance, have had.  They were brothers
of nature, if a God did exist to serve and be worshipped.  Font
lived on Greenbag Street, close to a company that specialized in
repairing damaged household appliances, and he grew up to be a
fine strapping youth, then a well-bred, brief-casing adult whose
job it was to rid the world of unwarranted nudity for
businessmen; and the leaf worked for itself for the next twenty
years, while no one realized how wise in years the old
tree-feather was.  </body><p>

	<body>The leaf had a hard life, watching the sun rise and set for
every day of its life, never able to contribute any more than
his brief and relatively unimportant part to the beauty of each
twenty-four hours.  Spring was its favorite time, watching new
friends join him from babies to sudden adults, and he would have
renewed opportunities of conversing with his shaking brothers,
as well as those from the neighboring tree, and across the
street next to the lamp post (those lucky enough to still have
their lives after horrifying weekends when the brown splotched
cat decided to test its reflexes and instincts on anything which
fluttered); and when the wind rattled their sticky brown home,
all spoke at once and the leaf's hearing would be filled with
the vibrations that sang an opera in activity. 
</body><p>
	<body>Spring was good for the man as well because it seemed his
fellow humans had also grown more of the green stuff which
excited shop keepers to great delight, and clothes upon clothes
were consumed upon the backs and legs of all who entered ringing
doors.</body><p>

	<body>It was near the middle of spring when Font was told that all
his stock had to go.  He was told this sweet fact by a very
enterprising young accountant, who married Font's sister right
out of high school, and which added to the intelligent amount of
sales the store received.  It was hardly a lie, since they
indeed needed to move the merchandise of one season to make rack
room for the coming demand of little-material clothing.  Bathing
suits, shorts, long pants for summer job interviews-- all had to
make their mark upon the tables of good shop owners.  The sign
was hung indicating "store wide sales" and "everything must go!"
in huge bold letters, and Font set quite a few pats on his
helper's back as the income steadily increased to unlimited
proportions.</body><p>

	<body>One day, after he had gained more than enough to settle in a
quiet town to raise a family and simple hopes for the rest of
his life, Font's helper quit with a smile and a handshake and
left the grateful owner to overwork himself greatly within the
two months that followed.  Not able to handle the rapid pace of
becoming increasingly wealthy by himself, which meant sometimes
work hours in the double digits for a single day, Font placed an
advertisement in the local newspaper, with the specific
ingredients desired for what he thought would be the ideal
clerk.  At least sixty applicants arrived within a week of the
public statement being placed.  But of these, many were the
wrong shape and color, or contained age and ethnic handicaps,
and he had to say "I'm sorry" so often that it was rehearsed as
if he meant it.  His ideal had simply not walked by his place of
business, and perhaps he would have to settle: for whatever
ex-military, short man or housewife-returned-to-college which
made him/herself available.  Business distressed him, and ulcers
threatened to capture his vital organs and give way to the blood
pressure, higher than his secret bank account, which was
laughingly waiting in line behind the next, or the next, or the
next, customer. </body><p>
	

	<body>But, as the brother to the man fought for existence, the leaf
still relished it to the fullest and now that it was summer, he
hung about by his umbilical cord and played with the friends
across the street, and they would all invent games of "what
would happen?" into their limited knowledge of the world and
wish themselves free to float and fly and discover.  But not the
leaf. Yes, he would play, and quite happily, too, but in his
heart he knew the only sad ending which came from being lost
from the tree-mother. </body><p>

	

	<body>After two weeks of searching, Font finally found a presentable
subject.  Eyes a solid color, hair in neat straight waves,
clothes always as pressed as his sense of humor, application
full of meaningless, but highly experienced occupations, and
desires bursting forth with dreams of becoming an executive of
some kind or another, always courageous, determined and honest.</body><p> 

<body>Font tried the man called Robbie out for a week, and he was
wonderful!  He remembered where everything went, how suits were
to be laid out for ad campaigns, where and how money was to be
distributed for the purpose of keeping correct books, how to
handle customers who thought themselves right when the entire,
ancient world wrong, how to say "please", "thank you" and "I'm
sorry, but that's not our policy" when applicable, and sound
sincere, and he wanted to constantly take on more responsibility
and further headaches which left Font readily available for
fishing lessons and adult book store field trips which he had
previously overlooked because of impossible time elements.  So
Robbie learned the routines and learned them very well as the
months wore on, and the little store saw less and less of its
owner.  But Font truly enjoyed having his reading lists
enlarged, and sought future ways to distribute more power to the
helper who never dated. </body><p>

	

	<body>The breeze started to cool and swimsuits, the leaf saw, were
suddenly being changed into long sleeves and turtle-neck
sweaters, as the people turned to laying plans for firewood,
never considering his home, thank goodness, to their cottages.
The leaf started to witness some changes in his friends, which
he'd often seen before.  Suddenly they were different to him,
not just in attitude, but in appearance and personality as well.
They did not want to play anymore, but were well content to just
settle down in the quiet of an evening and watch the mist rise
from a far off fire hydrant end-celebration; or they would watch
glints of tiny sparks which floated up to the air, as once they
wished to do, ignorant and never concerned or even curious of
the dead bodies which were raising up from the well-groomed
yards to meet whatever afterlives were contained for such
creatures.</body><p>

	<body>None of it bothered the leaf too much, because he had witnessed
change before, and where once he had been grateful for the
eternal life it looked as if he was given, he found himself, as
time died on, in thoughts of change.  And he wished his lifeline
was not the strongest, so that he could follow one generation,
and feel as if he belonged.</body><p>



	<body>Font gave his far from new employee a generous Christmas
present of a new automobile for his genius of working virtually
all shifts himself, now that Font had all but retired at the
golden age of 23.  Robbie was very pleased and called the other
man, actually one year older than himself, father, and closed
the office for an entire day: as long as the appreciative hug
lasted.</body><p>

	<body>The shop was closed an entire week for Christmas, as both men
could afford such a situation, and they spent the time with
their separate families, as some relatives weren't seen since
the sole proprietorship began.  But work started bright and
early the next year, and there was no confinement as to the
shop's ability to bring in new customers and older money.  In
fact, by that time, business was too good to allow such a small
place to be the only link between the two men and the rest of
the world's wealth.  So, they opened another store, and used the
little residence as a proper office.  The mania was supreme and
by the start of the next month, they found the well-gotten gains
to purchase more property.  Then another store, then another. Of
course, more people had to be employed to run such an elegant
state-wide clothing specialist, but Robbie and Font both knew
the desired look their chain needed to promote and it wasn't
long before every available apparel seller, whether they had
work or not, was drawn forth into the new stores, with the
projected income the two men could promise. </body><p>

	

	<body>The leaf was never more sad, and angry, than when he had to
witness the mass execution of those he'd grown to love.  Those
he called brother and sister had simply faded away during the
night, or perhaps within his sight on a pretty, cloudless day. 
There was nothing he could do about it, and he had to watch them
fall as they shouted no final words of encouragement; they were
all too old to care about anything, save the possibility of a
final resting place where they could forget the woes of their
short lives.  The leaf wanted to cry, and feel the wetness burn
into his blackened, harsh skin.  But the tears would never come
to him, no matter how often he wished to go to the place where
supposedly his family was rushing.</body><p>

	<body>The strength gradually drained from his body, and so too, did
the desire to live.</body><p>



	<body>The business Font had started little more than a year ago was
fast becoming one of the most amazing achievements since the
popular patent of the wheel, and every major business executive
wanted in on it.  Font was able, with pride, to grant that
important wish Robbie had made so long ago, and was able to
laugh in the faces of the influential managers who offered their
services.  Font laid the entire company before Robbie, to let
his ego run wild upon the title of President in Charge of
Production.  Both men were happy, with their well-provided for
families sitting by their sides, smiling for the magazine covers
which never ended, and Font and Robbie worked with no problems.
No problems with each other at all. Until.</body><p>

	<body>They worked through the winter with ease, and were even
debating, off and on, the challenge of raising another jewel to
their much inspired chain; but the entire fabric of the company
changed, on the very eve of spring.  </body><p>

	<body>Font was busy looking over the company accounts one day when
his eye chanced to catch something that did not decimal
correctly.  He used an expensive calculator to confirm his
suspicions and leaned back in his desk chair to try to come to
grips with a proper explanation as to who the math-idiot could
be.  Font hit his head on the corner of a cabinet behind him,
and it clicked a certain drawer open, which should never have
happened by accident!  Font withdrew the files he found inside
the dark hole and looked over the papers with horror and sorrow
in both eyes and heart.  He found that report to be a faithful
embezzlement of company funds into a private account of several
million dollars.  But that was not the ultimate surprise
waiting.  It was all in the neat handwriting of his best friend
Robbie!  Font couldn't believe it.  Anyone but Robbie! he
thought, but here it was in blue and black.  He tried to make a
tear rise in his eye but there was no room for it with the
remaining anger which grew thicker by the figure.  He scanned
the remaining notes, then decided: there was to be the monthly
deposit of the office's receipts and money the next day.  </body><p>

	<body>Font quickly pocketed the sacrilegious documents and withdrew
the three teeming bags of money from the hidden safe.  He was
determined not to let the theft go on any longer than possible. 
For, the most awful blow of all had been reading when the
trickery started.  The first date of monies stolen had been: the
day after Robbie had been originally hired!  </body><p>

	<body>Font called his wife and told her he was going to visit Shirley
on Meadows Grove and wouldn't be home until an hour past the
children's bed time; and not to wait up.  Font took the load of
mixed-colored papers in his arms, got in his talking car and
drove to Shirley's house.  He knew that Shirley lived in a
residential section of town and that in her back yard she had a
fall-out shelter which she sometimes used to store family
valuables.  He knocked on her door and asked if he might have a
favor. </body><p>

	

	<body>Meanwhile, the leaf was trying to gather the much needed
strength to join his ancestors. He had little will for anything
but sadness and so the trial was hard going.  He looked into the
deep night stars and wondered if he was a lost soul who'd done
something he was not supposed to in a previous life, and
wondered what sort of crime warranted an enslavement of such
magnitude. He couldn't even shake a limb in his present
condition.
</body><p>


	<body>Font started digging with an old shovel, and wrestled with
himself as to if he wanted criminal proceedings brought against
a man he'd once called son.  But then he thought of their age
difference, and, the dream broken, he used the energy to make
the hole faster.</body><p>

	<body>"Hello, Font," said a voice from the darkness. </body><p>

	<body>There stood Robbie, a smile on his shiny teeth and an old
revolver in his hand. "I called the office.  Then I called your
house.  What are you doing?" Font gripped the shovel tighter but
only got a hum of discouragement from the weapon holder. "I'm
going to have to call the police on you, Robbie.  I'm sorry."
</body><p>


	<body>The leaf hardly noticed the scene below him at all. "Then,"
started Robbie, "I guess I'm going to have to shoot you.  Nobody
saw me arrive.  I turned my car lights off."  Robbie asked for
the evidence and Font unwillingly gave it to him. "You can dig
your own hole if you like", and with that, Font continued
digging for the next twenty minutes until it was deep and long
enough for his dead hide. "You once told me you were born in the
Spring," said Robbie. "Well, Font. You're going to die in it." 
Font stood up straight and prepared to die like a man.  His eyes
met the tree behind Robbie and he readied himself for the last
sight he would see.</body><p>

	<body>Upon hearing of a possible brother, the leaf perked up.  He
turned his gaze more closely to the human called Font and looked
deep into his eyes.  Inside, he found the warmth of a Spring
week and the compassion of an angel of birth; he knew the entire
history of this man, and loved him for it; he read the man's
mind of his birthday, which was his own; he read the man's
memory of his children's first steps and first blisters from hot
cement, his wife's weeping at the trip he bought her to reunite
her with her German grandparents whom she hadn't seen in
decades, of his business which meant almost as much as his
family if only in the sense that the work took at least the same
amount of time and energy away from his happy days.... He saw
everything in this object whose first breath had been of Spring,
and with that in the lungs, a brother needed nothing else.</body><p>

	"<body>Anything to say?" Robbie asked. "Any hidden accounts?" But
Font said nothing, and just stared at the unknown and withered
tree.</body><p>

	<body>With all his might, the leaf shook himself from the branch
which had held him prisoner for so many lifetimes and with a
large crack from the strong branch-root, he jumped from his life
and floated slowly to the bottom.</body><p>

	<body>Robbie heard the noise behind him and turned to look. Font took
this opportunity to jump into the barrel of the gun and within a
moment's intense struggle, with life being the First Prize, Font
claimed Victory! and stepped on Robbie's chest, as he held the
revolver to the head on the ground, and called to Shirley.</body><p>

	<body>The only sound upon the night was that of the two men breathing
hard, as they waited carefully for the police, and the soft
rustle of the wind lifting the quiet passengers of foliage to an
easy freedom.</body><p>
