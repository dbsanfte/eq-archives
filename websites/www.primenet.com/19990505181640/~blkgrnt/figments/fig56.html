<br>
<br>
BY KIM STINGER<br>
<br>
<br>
i hear my heartache<br>
   in the shrieking of birds <br>
and the scratching of my cat<br>
   at the door.<br>
my tears i see in a pond<br>
   of confused fish,<br>
swimming in all directions<br>
   but home.<br>
these thoughts i have i hear<br>
   in the wind beating my window <br>
and in the silence<br>
   in my room.<br>
the feeling of wholeness i felt once<br>
   was lost yesterday<br>
in the headlight of a train<br>
   and the hug goodbye.<br>
