<h3>HOW I BECAME A DICTATOR AND DIED</h3><br>
<br>
Christopher Stolle<br>
<br>
<br>
attempting to uncover<br>
everything this culture hinders<br>
as beggars scamper in the streets<br>
and priests shout from the pulpit<br>
while everyone of a tender age<br>
begin to question<br>
all the things they were taught.<br>
<br>
my little pinkie<br>
starts to bleed<br>
but if my head was to ooze<br>
could a bandage<br>
trap in the fear<br>
that a disease<br>
would come and take me away<br>
never to gasp again?<br>
<br>
fortresses built<br>
in overpopulated cities<br>
to keep the virgins sacred<br>
and the local merchants<br>
would sell you a bottle<br>
of the finest wine<br>
for a few hundred dollars<br>
to ferment your mind.<br>
<br>
snapshot of horror<br>
and the broom sweeps<br>
all the wisdom<br>
under the carpet.<br>
<br>
so long virtual reality.<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Cliff Top </h3><br>
<br>
<br>
Trina Stolec<br>  
<br>

I stand on<br>   
sand<br>     
grass<br>     
flowers gone wild.<br>  
Watch waves riot toward land....<br>  
waves born in crisp Arctic surges,<br>  
traverse galaxies of space, <br> 
go Kamikaze on<br>  
stone blades<br>  
miles beneath my feet.<br>  
Hydraulic explosions<br>  
unseen...<br>     
unfelt...<br>     
unknown.<br>  
<br>  
Their haunting song draws me<br>  
a step closer to the edge ...<br>  
their end now visible, yet <br> 
still slipping from my grasp. <br> 
Violent<br>    
erupting <br>    
mist.<br>  
  
          A ritual<br>   
          I can't seem<br>   
          to shake...<br>  
          Stand at<br>   
          the edge<br>  
          watch.<br>  
          Inches from<br>   
          joining<br>   
          holocaust.<br>  
          Wait for<br>   
          the reason<br>  
          to not leap<br>  
          to erupt    within    my thoughts.<br>   
The wind brings mist to my face.<br>  
No need to watch their demise today.<br>  
Just hope the reasons ...<br>  
whatever they may be ...<br>  
erupt in my brain very soon.<br>  
Only<br>     
one<br>     
step<br>     
left.<br>  
<br>
<br>

<h3>Synaesthesia</h3><br>
<br>
<br>
Amy Lyn Turner<br>
   <br> 
<br>
Can you see the thunder rumble,<br>
    or hear the gritty rocks?<br>
    Can you taste the bright sunlight,<br>
    or smell the sugary socks?<br>
     <br>
    Just slowly reach your curious hand<br>
    and feel the aroma of the land.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Generations </h3><br>                      
<br>
<br>
thomas j. clancy<br>
<br>
<br>
Blind great grandmother<br>
rocking in her chair<br>
knitting a scarf in<br>
mid-summer,<br>
kicks me away with<br>
old, decaying feet in<br>
pediatric shoes.<br>
<br>
Grandmother preparing<br>
sausage and ziti<br>
int the kitchen,<br>
cleaning garden tomatoes<br>
for salad, tells me to go<br>
to my<br>
mother.<br>
<br>
Mother sitting drunk<br>
at the table in tears<br>
speaking with<br>
grandfather about father,<br>
tells me to go<br>
out and play.<br>
<br>
I sit in the shade<br>
of the old willow<br>
tree, dreaming of<br>
yesterday and<br>
tomorrow and<br>
things never did<br>
quite turn out as<br>
good as I imagine<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Eternity</h3><br>
<br>
<br>
Cora M.Kammer<br>
<br>
From the darkness of heaven I heard them cry<br>
Angels were weeping and sad because God died<br>
And the world down below was lying in flames<br>
And the lost souls of Satan were not to be blamed<br>
<br>
From the darkness of hell I heard them cry<br>
Demons were howling and sad since Satan died<br>
And the world up above was engulfed in tears<br>
And it wasn't because of the angels' fears<br>
<br>
From inside the emptiness of our torn hearts<br>
We knew this was how our destruction starts<br>
And our world fell apart in a wave of black death<br>
And eternity had been all that we could get<br>
<br>
From the coldest dark void collapsed the stars<br>
Galaxies were screaming as they ripped apart<br>
And the Universe ebbed away into dust<br>
And it hadn't to do with what's right or what's just<br>
<br>
From the shores of our Universe the storm went away<br>
Silence fill up what once was a beautiful day<br>
And nothing remained but a smear of gray ash<br>
And the tide has ceased its once so terrible crash<br>
<br>
From a speck of reality that was once ours<br>
I wept but smelled nothing except the burnt stars<br>
And I wished that my soul had then disappeared<br>
And it would have been less than what angel's had feared<br>
<br>
From a faint hope a being was born to love<br>
He built himself a place of clouds far above<br>
And the Lord built a Universe because he was alone<br>
And all of its things reminded me of my home<br>
<br>
From His spot in the sky He saw me weep<br>
He came down from heaven, to me He would speak<br>
And the Lord gave me wings upon which to fly<br>
And He swore He would never be able to die<br>
<br>
From His seat in the heavens He heard my laughter<br>
Life had finally made it to the happily ever after<br>
And a world sang below, praising existence<br>
And a change had been made from that very first instant<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>SLEEPLESS</h3><br>
<br>
<br>
Pearl Mary Wilshaw<br>
<br>
Without looking...<br>
in the very early morn<br>
before dawn, shades<br>
still drawn, from<br>
beneath my mound<br>
of blankets, cocooned<br>
against the cold, I<br>
know when it's snowing<br>
by the hushed, muted<br>
sounds...tones<br>
of trains on tip-toe,<br>
humming through town,<br>
blaring horns wearing<br>
mufflers.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>HAPPINESS IS</h3><br>
<br>
<br>
Pearl Mary Wilshaw<br>
<br>
<br>
Christmas,pink cheeked<br>
children, candles<br>
bright, snow<br>
white wedding<br>
gowns, candle<br>
light, ocean<br>
reflecting<br>
blue skies,<br>
bright.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Two Orchids</h3><br>
<br>
<br>
Tom Brand<br>
<br>
<br>
He walks in with two orchids.<br>
Forty four.<br>
Bustling with energy.     Pizzazz.<br>
One hour later<br>
he stumbles out. Stopped and ninety five.<br>
In the shade.<br>
Wilting with each step.<br>
Nothing<br>
ahead but bad news and neighbors<br>
avoiding eye contact. And one orchid--<br>
perfect symmetry destroyed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>A Simpleton Looking at a Blank Museum Wall</h3><br>
<br>
<br>
Brice Patrick Gorman<br>
<br>
<br>

"Aint really nothin' for sure,<br>
resembles a butt crack upside down, inside out,<br>
with a barn's poetry on the outer fringes<br>
and a 1950's refrig that aint working'."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>OK</h3><br>
<br>
<br>
Rod Farmer<br>
<br>
<br>
"OK" is our subject.<br>
Will you OK the American word OK?<br>
I need your OK on OK<br>
OK, Please agree.<br>
Your approval would be, well OK,<br>
after all, OK is truly OK.<br>
OK, I have your attention?<br>
OK!!<br>
It is OK that OK wears<br>
many grammatical hats--all OK,<br>
it shows how OK OK is.<br>
OK?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Untitled</h3><br>
<br>
<br>
Rod Farmer<br>
<br>
<br>
There he is, Mr. Erect,<br>
standing at an aviator's<br>
one o'clock<br>
so full of himself<br>
so purposeful<br>
self-centered, audacious too,<br>
it's enough to make one laugh<br>
in amusement but we don't<br>
want to embarrass him, <br>
makes him shrink away.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Change-the Word</h3><br>
<br>
<br>
Benjamin Ivry<br>
<br>
<br>
Where humans silhouettes<br>
reduce to signposts for the toilet,<br>
and ancient spouses reunite for trysts<br>
with warty deathmarks of the Abbe' Liszt,<br>
we wait. Time drips like spittle,<br>
in no rush to traverse a famous face,<br>
that plays the game of change-the-word:<br>
hospital, hotspur, horsepiss, hospice.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Turning Point in Barcelona</h3><br>
<br>
<br>
Benjamin Ivry<br>
<br>
<br>
The idea that sleep is the sweetest benefice<br>
is disproved by the beloved one's<br>
nap in the Parc de la Ciudad.<br>
Particoloured lights, three old senoras arm-in-arm,<br>
a cyclist's thighs---all are missed<br>
by the one who feels absence of pain is the thing.<br>
Lying shriveled like a Civil War cadet<br>
changed by a bullet into a mess of clothes,<br>
he cannot see that the park is beautiful, people are passing,<br>
and we ourselves might be beautiful,<br>
so I tell it to the pungent wrapper<br>
of a bocadillo sandwich.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>The Last Lighthouse Keeper</h3><br>
<br>
<br>
Ryan G. Van Cleeve<br>
<br>
<br>
Sir, though your islands are dry<br>
Take your torch in a sturdy hand,<br>
Look to the white stars for guidance.<br>
Walk among the graves at dusk,<br>
Over the bland withered leaves.<br>
<br>
The sea washes the sand clean,<br>
Bleaches the bones of the dead,<br>
But the wise know enough to seek out<br>
A lonely lantern that hangs in the air<br>
Showing sailors how to come home.<br>
<br>
Let the mad flee to the dank caves<br>
That are shut up with walls of water.<br>
Learn from the strength of the sea kale<br>
To thrive on the lip of the world.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Lullaby</h3><br>
<br>
<br>
Greg Watson<br>
<br>
<br>
the last thing I hear<br>
is your breath, a silence rustling like spirits<br>
calling to late, the last movement<br>
a red rose<br>
tapping against the bed-<br>
room window, the smell of must<br>
and flesh wounds;<br>
the fact of your warmth<br>
when I come to bed, my body cold<br>
from wandering the apartment naked,<br>
is a book not to be read<br>
but breathed.<br>
<br>
