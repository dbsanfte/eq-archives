				Would a life spent <br>
				Be worth the grain of the stone<br>
				Carved into a deathless obelisk?<br>
				Would its name be sung beautiful and loud enough<br>
				To warrant it house's silence?<br>
					The soil bleeds with the straight pins of obeli.<br>
					And unbroken flesh trembles in slim, descending shadows.<br>
				What is your weight for fear?<br>
				How joyous your hue of new blood?<br>
				Upon thinking, in dreaming:<br>
				Does the coolness of stone prevail?<br>
				Should the coolness of stone prevail.<br>
