<h3>My Favorite Prostitute</h3><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Tom Burbank <br>
<br>
<br>
should've closed my eyes<br>
should've opened my hands<br>
felt the consciousness of the rain<br>
fluttering down with no demands<br>
<br>
here she comes on gargoyle lips<br>
here she comes on poisoned hopes<br>
on marooned hopes she dances by<br>
and there she goes on fantasy hopes<br>
<br>
down the street I wander<br>
under fluttering kisses of mother sky<br>
under my stoic eyes, a furrowed brow<br>
she dances under the crying, crying sky<br>
<br>
lightening cracks litter the sky<br>
I don't miss the cracks in my head<br>
I won't say a word for poor mother<br>
she cries down on our bleeding heads<br>
<br>
every scratch on the overground<br>
I twist to glance the stealing silhouettes<br>
she dances further into gargoyle black<br>
disappearing into an exhausted night<br>
"She's dead, it's her dying breathe, that's my last bet...".<br>
<br>
stealing the gift of night again<br>
dancing naked under my bleeding head<br>
dancing naked for mother once again<br>
dancing skyclad until I'm bloody red<br>
<br>
another night on broken knees<br>
another dream from this inbetween<br>
bloody murder trickled down the night-time trees<br>
she's a bloody mess, I wonder where's she been...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>We Will</h3><br>
<br>
<br>
Scott Ross<br>
<br>
<br>
We will go nude into the street, protesting our innocence<br>
To the insistent crowds that gather to mock and stare.<br>
After we are sufficiently shamed, please slip away with me<br>
Until we’re inside the little, barren speck of a room<br>
Where the walls are cracked and the floor slips away<br>
And the mind wanders like a lonesome child’s.<br>
We will be almost alone then, free in our tired fashion<br>
To make love beneath the naked eye of a fading bulb.<br>
We will experience all--we will regret nothing.<br>
<br>
After the silken wedge of love is driven between us<br>
We will proceed to the local park--lay on a blanket<br>
Count passing cars in the volcanic sunshine and read<br>
Important books about the nature of life and death<br>
And celebrate our dolphin-like existences while<br>
We slip between the worlds of water and air.<br>
In the blue-green haze of your eyes I see no fear<br>
Just an insistence that strives to draw me near<br>
Far reaching goals ending in mile-deep puzzles<br>
<br>
Please go a little further down the day with me<br>
Into a waiting area filled with silent sorrow<br>
Need is there as we relax in our vulnerability<br>
And make a truce as fragile as bone china.<br>
The air contains a rare and magic odor today<br>
Not perfume--more powerful by far because<br>
It’s the scent of fear--the fear of being hungry<br>
The scent of confusion blessed within every cell<br>
It urges me onward to a half-hidden conclusion.<br>
<br>
Please cease your crying--we’ll return together<br>
To the little room we occupied before--alone.<br>
Put aside the laughter of the weary world<br>
Wait for morning wrapped in chafed caresses<br>
Remember the cars and sunshine on green grass<br>
Listen for the sounds of scraping from my heart<br>
Take my head in your tiny hands and comfort me<br>
Cover my eyes with your hair while I weep to you<br>
Looking for barren fragments of a forgotten time.<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>On A Bus</h3><br>
<br>
<br>
David Simons<br>
I wrote a poem on a bus<br>
 but to hear it you must<br>
 climb to the top<br>
 of the bouncing metal stairs.<br>
 <br>
 Slither snake-like<br>
 past the rail<br>
 and sit<br>
 on the rainbow nylon bench<br>
 <br>
 I¹ll be there<br>
 at the top of the bus<br>
 reciting my rhyme<br>
 written as we ride along<br>
 past shops and houses<br>
 with musty nets<br>
 and peeling paint<br>
 on dingy doors<br>
<br>
 There¹s the old woman who<br>
 lives in house no bigger than a shoe box<br>
 who had so many children she didn¹t know what to do<br>
 but theyv¹e all grown and flown now and<br>
 she¹s all alone with no-one to talk to but herself<br>
 <br>
 Look at that kid: grimy smile and mischevious eyes<br>
 skateboard-scuffed knees<br>
 darting out from the roadside<br>
 screech!<br>
 as we stop and angry words<br>
 The kid glances back and tosses a vee<br>
 leaving just his smile behind<br>
 <br>
 The bus lurches on<br>
 at a snail¹s pace and stops at a stop<br>
 for a giggle girl gang<br>
 to chatter up the stairs<br>
 with a clatter of feet and voices<br>
 <br>
 Weekends and boyfriends<br>
 music and laughter<br>
 as the bus trundles and sways<br>
 past shops all shuttered<br>
 old folks gathered by doorways<br>
 talking about people<br>
 dead and forgotten<br>
 except by them<br>
 <br>
 Into the town now<br>
 a river of road-rage<br>
 as our bus rambles onward<br>
 toward carparks and markets<br>
 and rat-racing shoppers<br>
 <br>
 And stops by a brown pigeon-stained temple<br>
 of public philanthropy<br>
 a gift from a long dead civic leader
 and now proud home<br>
 to dogeared tomes of PC persuasion<br>
 <br>
 Our bus like some Trojan<br>
 horse disgorges its riders<br>
 who spatter and scatter<br>
 like rays of dawn light<br>
 to shop till they drop<br>
 <br>
 So just me and you seated<br>
 atop the steel stairway<br>
 and you say to me sharply<br>
 So where's your poem then?<br>
 I look at you strangely:<br>
 It's happened around you¹ I tell you quite curtly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>SOUNDS OF MORNING</h3><br>
<br>
<br>
Marc Awodey<br>
<br>
<br>
Leaves remember <br>
in small and gentile voices <br>
pregnant milkweed, <br>
<br>
cottonwood fibers <br>
symmetrically loitering <br>
in sunlight. Exposed seeds, <br>
<br>
that lingered before exhales <br>
were thrust to regenerate dying <br>
forests. My son once heard me <br>
<br>
muttering to myself, <br>
about a place of warm wind. <br>
Again ascending frequencies <br>
<br>
of morning unfold as twilight¹s <br>
gathered train atrophies <br>
above hard faced Adirondacks.<br>
<br>
Swarming raindrops <br>
rattle on my storm windows. <br>
Beyond dripping clapboards<br>
<br>
I hear October¹s last finch. <br>
<br>

<h3>RED BUTTERFLIES</h3><br>
<br>
<br>
Michael Rothenberg<br>
<br>
<br>
Black boxes on folding chairs<br>
Unfolded around a folding table<br>
<br>
A bowl of pretzels<br>
Four glasses of beer<br>
Gambling chips<br>
Playing cards face down<br>
I pick up one of the hands<br>
Five crisp cards<br>
All of them picture cards<br>
Red Butterflies light on their wings<br>
<br>
In the room of butterflies<br>
Four men play cards<br>
Drink, smoke, cough, grunt<br>
I put twenty dollars on the table<br>
A squinting man looks at the money<br>
He looks like the bank<br>
<br>
A jovial man deals me a hand<br>
Five of a kind<br>
Picture cards<br>
Red Butterflies<br>
I bet heavily on this hand<br>
<br>
The bank sits back in his chair<br>
Clicks his tongue<br>
He's sure I'm bluffing<br>
Maybe I am<br>
I never had a flush of butterflies<br>
He sees me, raises me<br>
<br>
The fourth hand<br>
A drunken man<br>
Flutters his cards<br>
As if he's got butterflies too<br>
He sees the bank<br>
I see the bank<br>
I raise the bank<br>
The bank folds<br>
<br>
The drunk sees me, calls me<br>
I show my hand of Red Butterflies<br>
He has a pair of aces and a pair of threes<br>
I reach for the pot, he stops me<br>
The money slides into his lap<br>
He beams around the table, says<br>
"No cigar, two pair beats five butterflies"<br>
<br>
Black boxes on folding chairs<br>
Around a folding table<br>
A game of Red Butterflies<br>
Folded and unfolded<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>CRAZY RANDALL</h3><br>
<br>
<br>
Michael Rothenberg<br>
<br>
<br>
Harmonica frog, banjo frog, pond, crickety-racket sundown<br>
Parked on a red dirt road in Crenshaw County<br>
Under a quarter moon and fireflies<br>
"Got somethin' to show you" Randall's prize<br>
Three strange chickens in a wire cage<br>
"Buy me a beer, Chuck!"<br>
Randall limping drunk at LeGrande store Saturday night<br>
When they were children he'd come knocking<br>
At two in the morning<br>
"Ho, ho, ho," dressed up like Santa<br>
"Grandma, I think that's Randall. We knew it was him"<br>
That was the last time Santa came<br>
We live our own lives<br>
Flycasting, frog gigging, coon dicks and turkey beards<br>
Looking for excuses to kill somebody, to question our own blood-lust<br>
Delayed stress syndrome, Boyhood to Mamhood<br>
"My soul has been psychedelicized"<br>
One time he out ran the police, he was jailed the second time<br>
Hereditary genetic disorders<br>
Acquired cultural deficiencies<br>
Desperate spiritual peculiarities<br>
He suffered gunshot wounds<br>
Flipped the pickup truck over on Hwy 331<br>
Fell from a tree drunk, got his arm caught in a motor<br>
Then died of a stroke in the stale dark night<br>
Descendant of The Mayflower, Veteran of Foreign Wars<br>
Member of  Alabama Wildlife Federation<br>
He sold watermelons from a trailer<br>
At the used car lot out by Ramer<br>
At a hazy lavender home spot, we talked<br>
Rusted nails, soft-rotted steps, 1887 slant floorboards<br>
Grass growing up all around us<br>
Vines crawled over broken window frames<br>
Lizards skirted the porch rail<br>
So, what do you know about love?<br>
"No one's ever knocked me over", Southern Girls  win<br>
More beauty contests, preening, "Yes I do, Bob"<br>
Chins tucked, pampered gentility<br>
Teeth vaselined, eyes green in jelly<br>
Miss Peach, Miss Pork, Miss Pecan, "Beauty Is Truth"<br>
And the some who are born not so beautiful<br>
He plays the guitar, hands wavering to stay a chord<br>
Cawtawba trees, bass, dragonflies, oak, pine and hickories<br>
Spanish Moss, Great-horned owls<br>
Blue Herons, 9 point buck, hunting dogs<br>
There's always a place for one of god's creatures<br>
"Thou shalt not turn thy back on the tablernacle"<br>
<br>						
<br>						
<br>
<h3>SEPARATION</h3>
<br>
<br>
Michael Rothenberg<br>
<br>
<br>
In the living room<br>
after dinner<br>
after the bones<br>
are removed<br>
from the table<br>
and dumped<br>
into the body bag<br>
beneath the sink<br>
cushions hiss<br>
as we sink<br>
into easy chairs<br>
prepared to kill<br>
whatever crawls<br>
forward<br>
whatever twitches<br>
of affection<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>The Calm</h3> <br>
<br>
<br>
 Jay Liveson<br>
<br>
<br>
It's quiet now, between the aftershocks.<br> 
I roam with care between the bricks and shards. <br>
With my toe I push the chips, the fractured  <br>
Mirror that glistens in the fissured yard. <br>
There lies the chimney base, the patio door, <br>
Your oils and easels splayed across the grass <br>
Bright pigments blending with floral shades.   And look, <br>
My ties tangle with his collar and leash. <br>
It's dusk.  A faint breeze skims the smoke and dust <br>
>From jigsaw masonry.  I've called his name  <br>
Again and set his usual dish among <br>
The smoldering debris.  It's growing late. <br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Don </h3><br>
<br>
<br>
Jay Liveson<br> 
<br>
<br>
I must admit my preference <br>
for "pen and ink."  I like a line <br>
carved on unskiid canvas. <br>
Especially if it traps  <br>
the gesture of a limb,  <br>
like gentle fingers  <br>
caressing a cheek <br>
or arm's ripple  <br>
after the spear is released. <br>
And massive areas are toned-- <br>
not by broad brush strokes,  <br>
that grey the whiteness <br>
with a few sweeps,  <br>
but rather by patterns  <br>
of wispy scratches <br>
ex-ing out the glare,  <br>
in mixtures  <br>
of herring-bone, checker, pin-stripes  <br>
each millimeter filled with care.   <br>
<br>
Don has enough movement  <br>
in the stubs of his phocomelic arms  <br>
to cradle a sharpened pencil.   <br>
He just manages <br>
to shift wheelchair controls <br>
with his hints of finger buds  <br>
rolls back a bit to scan his canvas. <br>
Then he readjusts the pencil  <br>
in clenched teeth,  <br>
his massive jaw muscles now rested, <br>
and returns to the paper's slopes.  <br>
The pitcher's knuckles  <br>
need more texture,  <br>
and the hatching that he has in mind <br>
is quite complex. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Mike </h3><br>
 <br>
<br>
Jay Liveson<br>
<br>
<br>
Mike never changes.  I see his bike rearing up <br>
front wheel spinning air, <br>
I see him stand, bat on his shoulder <br>
returning the pitcher's stare. <br>
I see him hop from the yellow bus <br>
books dangling, dashing across to "us guys"  <br>
to gab about "those girls" over there. <br>
But I never saw them pierce his veins <br>
or dress him in an open robe. <br>
I never saw when his sheets were changed <br>
or when the IV fluids flowed.   <br>
Children were spared the wards <br>
of hospitals, the smell of death.   <br>
And there was fear--the polio virus  <br>
could float on particles of bellowed breath. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
<h3>My Last Hemicraniectomy </h3><br>
 <br>
<br>
Jay Liveson<br>
<br>
<br>
That's my last hemicraniectomy  <br>
Patient on the x-ray screen.  You see <br>
The intricate vascularization  <br>
Of her tumor border.  Its invasion <br>
Of motor cortex, controlling her right hand-- <br>
More nimble than most surgeon's, I understand. <br>
I recall her execution months ago <br>
Of Brahm's Concerto's long arpeggio <br>
With such wondrous passion and depth.  Her face <br>
A curtain drawn against distraction.  Her pace, <br>
As her fingers spanned the range of ivory keys, <br>
Transcended your own, as her dexterity <br>
Evoked the flow of glittering streams, the lap <br>
Of gentle waves upon the sands, the clap <br>
Of thunderous clouds that gather to dim the daylight. <br>
Left pianissimo tossed to right <br>
Fortissimo, as if baton were passed <br>
>From lesser hand to one more strong and fast. <br>
She brought this same perfection to her life. <br>
She savored language, drank in words.  Her eyes <br>
Flashed the electric sparkling of her mind. <br>
Her dextrous wits surpassing even mine. <br>
And when she spoke, her skill of speech was such <br>
It struck one mute.  It's poignancy could touch <br>
The soul.  But this is what she was before <br>
My cure.  Before her silent tumor tore <br>
Through its borders.  This is a pre-op view <br>
While she still talked and smiled and played.  It grew. <br>
She had a grand mal seizure.  I gave commands. <br>
I ordered tests, dissected.  Now when she stands <br>
She's half-alive.  Her smile half-stopped.  Her right <br>
Leg drags.  She's mute.  Her hand against her side. <br>
No matter. I've freed her of her tumor, though, <br>
As evident in post-op films.  We'll go  <br>
Together down to brain pathology. <br>
They're photographing lecture slides for me. <br>
<br> 
<br>
<br>


<h3>Brandwein is Gone </h3><br>
<br> 
<br>
Jay Liveson<br>
<br>
<br>
The rumor is he chose to die. <br>
His table bares its plastic back. <br>
His sterilizer's balanced open <br>
awaiting his syringes.  Alongside <br>
vials of insulin and morphine line up  <br>
near the alcohol, and tournequet.   <br>
His stethoscope hangs  <br>
on the blood pressure apparatus,  <br>
whose mercury is poised  <br>
to ride the patient's tide.  But he,  <br>
Brandwein, will not return.   <br>
Never will his glass cabinets  <br>
reflect his stubbled jowls, <br>
the trace of foam at his lip's edge, <br>
his glasses over his brows. <br>
No longer will he lumber through this door,  <br>
open collar curled above stained shirt,  <br>
buttons strained against his belly's bulge.   <br>
to this dark warren of minor complaints. <br>
Brandwein, the youthful pride  <br>
of holocaust parents, the honor student, <br>
research dropout, was too long humbled  <br>
by recurrent whines of incurable patients. <br>
His empty home no longer charged  <br>
his ebbing will.  He read,  <br>
and pondered questions <br>
and for himself he found an answer. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>PEACE</h3><br>
<br>
<br>
Michelle Wentling<br>
<br>
<br>
When all is dark and quiet,<br>
When not a creature stirs,<br>
Then that's when peace will come to you,<br>
And softly sing in whispers.<br>
<br>
It gently urges you,<br>
To sit and listen more.<br>
It lightly moves and nudges you,<br>
To come in through it's door.<br>
<br>
Once there it shows you,<br>
Things you've never seen.<br>
And all is so beautiful,<br>
It's like a child's dream.<br>
<br>
You again are at it'd door.<br>
Must you go back<br>
To that world so cold and black...<br>
Where peace will always defy it<br>
Unless all is dark and quiet...<br>
And not a creature stirs?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>The World at Night</h3><br>
<br>
<br>
Michelle Wentling<br>
<br>
<br>
The night, so quiet and knowing,<br>
The frangrant winds so silently blowing,<br>
The flowers with only their petals showing,<br>
Where are their sleeping spirits going?<br>
<br>
The sky, with the stars are joyously sharing,<br>
The moon with it's light,so bold and daring<br>
The trees, their whispers so kind and caring,<br>
The crickets, their chirps loud,but not quite blaring.<br>
<br>
The sea, it's waves fall in perfect timing,<br>
The grass full of dew, so brilliantly shining,<br>
The roses,their redness slowly resigning,<br>
The bushes,their branches slightly inclining.<br>
<br>
The world at night is full of awe<br>
With wonderous sights for one and for all.<br>
the shadows can tell you all about night,<br>
Of things that happen in the absence of light.<br>
<br>
The beauty is seen in both night and day,<br>
It changes only slightly-- yet in a major way.<br>
<br>
 <br>        .
<br>
<h3>Righting the Kayak</h3><br>
<br>
<br>
Darren Lauzon<br>
<br>
<br>
simply from walking into the room<br>
their conversation stops <br>
as if I'd done something like<br>
grab mistakenly from a bowl of plastic fruit<br>
the insight sweeps me immediately<br>
down the rapids and eddies of similar times<br>
and maybe my brains<br>
would have been dashed against the rocks<br>
if I'd not sat down among them anyway<br>
in time<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Bed</h3><br>
<br>
<br>
Darren Lauzon<br>
<br>
<br>
the bowl of knickknacks I empty into<br>
toss the loose coins and buttons of dreams<br>
held fast like teeth<br>
in the gaping mouth of a snoring face<br>
dead looking except for the choking sound<br>
of the soul's dream fingers <br>
that probe for something discarded.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Awake</h3><br>
<br>
<br>
Darren Lauzon<br>
<br>
<br>
It used to be <br>
when something this enraging<br>
dropped like a stone in your water, <br>
breaking the still surface, <br>
tsunamis crashed at the edges.<br>
Enduring this was never easy.<br>
<br>
but now,<br>
the vacant pier where nothing <br>
is tied any longer, prevails. The ebb<br>
of shouts and clenched fists, <br>
the tantrums, the sadder of my losses,<br>
leaves a muddy wake in drying sun.<br>
<br>
It used to be nothing<br>
inflaming you, <br>
and your fire could extinguish <br>
the air in seconds,<br>
leaving vanity smouldering<br>
in the vacuum. <br>
Enduring this was never easy.<br>
<br>
but now your wet flint<br>
is struck in vain; <br>
and I,<br>
rooting in the scorched earth<br>
for good mineral<br>
long for the lightning.<br>
<br>
<br>
