If you don't love me <br>
I don't care, but<br>
I can love you<br>
If I wanta<br>
<br>
If you don't need me <br>
You won't see me,.<br>
but I can love you<br>
If I want<br>
<br>
Hey, listen. listen<br>
<br>
You be the listener <br>
I'll be the talker <br>
You be the prey <br>
I値l be the stalker<br>
<br>
I can't love you<br>
If you don't know <br>
the rules of my game <br>
Love can be an <br>
awfully evil thing <br>
with plenty of blame<br>
<br>
Don't invite me to <br>
your party, but<br>
I can cum<br>
If I wanta<br>
<br>
Don't invite me <br>
to your wedding. but <br>
I'll wed you<br>
If I want<br>
<br>
I値l deal the cards<br>
<br>
You be the Queen <br>
I値l be the Joker <br>
You be the prey <br>
I値l be the stalker<br>
<br>
I can worry <br>
about you<br>
If I wanta<br>
And you will <br>
Obey me If I want<br>
