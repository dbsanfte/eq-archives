Loving Looks<br>
<br>
<br>
By Kate Vetorino<br>
<br>
<br>
The young man looks deep into <br>
his beloved’s hazel eyes,<br>
and sees his children.<br>
<br>
Her eyes are clear<br>
and full of color so as to not <br>
cloud the vision<br>
of what is meant to be.<br>
The young man anticipates this day <br>
when he will have young ones <br>
who will look up to him in <br>
amazement.<br>
His beloved stands in the doorway <br>
as to not disturb the scene<br>
Father and child sit<br>
side by side together<br>
reading an old tale<br>
of long ago.<br>
The woman just smiles<br>
and laughs to herself.<br>
