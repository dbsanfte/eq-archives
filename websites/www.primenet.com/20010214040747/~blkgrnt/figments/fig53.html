<br>
<br>
By  Allison Eir Jenks<br>
<br>
<br>
The octave of us is an avenue<br>
of blackbirds with marbolized wings<br>
As the blacksnake licks the bobcat<br>
in a herculean daze.<br>
<br>
Your impotent homeland spread<br>
the last deep sea of freckles<br>
on your icy, olive face.<br>
<br>
Your blemished hands belong on you like<br>
Auburn liquer on pale blue tablecloths.<br>
<br>
I swim in the black of your eye until it<br>
liquifies like blues in autumn.<br>
<br>
We talk like friends of jewel and berry bandits<br>
Erasing halls of bored handwriting.<br>
