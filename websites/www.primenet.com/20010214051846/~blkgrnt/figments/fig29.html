						Souls flowing <br>
						circles & circles <br>
						time & time around <br>
						lost in the rite <br>
						lust in the rite <br>     
<br>
						what if I'm alone <br>
						what if I choose to die now <br>
						what if I let go  <br>  
<br>
						Souls flowing <br>
						sharing each other's fright <br>
						sharing the places <br>
						not to be lost, <br>
						time & time around, <br>
						sharing what they know <br>
						it will keep them from falling, <br>
						sharing what they think <br>
<br>
						it's shall keep them from dying alone   <br>   
<br>
						what if I'm alone <br>
						what if I choose not to follow <br>
						what if I let go. <br>
						What if we all die alone anyway... <br>
<br>
