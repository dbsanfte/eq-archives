Children of Unending Night<br>

Ifyou travel at night you are sure to meet a ghost, sooner or later.<br>
                        -- A Vietnamese Proverb<br>
<br>
Night does not necessarily<br>
Hold evil pretentions --<br>
Just the cold piercing silence<br>
Not unlike the morbid equality offered in death<br>
This balmy indifference weighs<br>
Into the night air like water.<br>
Come to its shores<br>
And feel the waxy sheath<br>
Ofthe serpent's tail<br>
As it slips between your ankles<br>
Like the foam of murky waters<br>
Drawn in by the tide and out again --<br>
Only real with the night.<br>
But bg sure to remain dry at its borders<br>
For not even the suicidal rat<br><br>
Considers a union with this realm<br>
Illusion is night's game<br>
And for a price it delivers --<br>
Hear the sound of the Serpent<br>
Over the sand and through the grass<br>
Like the hiss of the oven<br>
It is the uneasy calm<br>
Before the storm ofbreaking glass.<br>
As windows that once separated<br>
Mirror from mirror, shatter<br>
And the spirits that darkness once concealed<br>
Leap from shadows and dart<br>
From space to space between us --<br>
No longer an image in our peripheral vision<br>
Soon they form their secret societies<br>
And use their invisibility to undermine our world --<br>
No longer satisfied with being undefined images<br>
Behind gossamer and tulle --<br>
They are the children of unending night<br>
And like shadow people clamor in that<br>
Dark reflection for some sense<br>
Of the equality that exists<br>
Between you and me,<br>
But yearn for the day<br>
When they will do without us.<br>
