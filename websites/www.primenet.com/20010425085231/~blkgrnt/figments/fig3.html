<H3>IN THE WOMB OF WORDS</H3><BR>
<I>by David Hunter Sutherland</I><BR>
<BR>
<H3>
Pressed <BR>
in the womb of words and<BR>
dragged through the politics that<BR>
mist over our dreams and <BR>
soften the years, as sometimes;  <BR>
training your eyes,<BR>
<BR>the almost perceptible,<BR>
                   the near embrace,<BR>
                   the full orgasm,<BR>
            corners the curve, and always;<BR>
after the fall,<BR>
before the expression,<BR>
beyond a re-course,  its never;<BR>
<BR>
                     enough, in your silence,<BR>
                     too little, I speak,<BR>
                     far much, we regret.<BR>
