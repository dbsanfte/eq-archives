The Baby<br>
<br>
by Steven Bolia<br>
<br>
I do this quite often -- I love watching television<br>
And my favorite program is a soap opera<br>
On which a woman has just given birth<br>
And is waiting in the maternity ward<br>
And a doctor enters to inform her<br>
About the status of her baby<br>
My father enters my room<br>
And there is a baby in a rocking carriage<br>
At the top of the stairwell<br>
My brother enters my room<br>
And father says to him:<br>
"Please watch the baby while I wash my hands."<br>
My brother agrees but leaves soon thereafter<br>
The doctor tells the woman<br>
That her baby died during birth<br>
The unattended carriage begins<br>
To tumble down the stairwell<br>
I begin to cry -- I lose control<br>
And become hysterical<br>
My father returns with my sister --<br>
The carriage is upside down at<br>
The bottom ofthe steps<br>
My sister does not know what has happened<br>
And goes to pick up the baby<br>
It is limp as though it is dead<br>
But my sister sings to it<br>
And pretends it is only asleep.<br>
<br>
