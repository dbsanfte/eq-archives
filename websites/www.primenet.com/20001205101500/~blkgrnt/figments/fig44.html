<h3>BIRDS IN ART<br></h3>

The flock assembled in this gallery has stopped<br>
dead in its tracks, becoming subjects<br>
in a kingdom of pigment and paper.<br>
<br>
When the show opens, patrons gather, an <br>
incongruous lot, admiring famed artists<br>
or reciting the names of rarest<br>
<br>
birds by heart.  Painters present<br>
preen before their work, signing autographs,<br>
dressed to match the plumage<br>
<br>
they have rendered.  If life imitates <br>
art, will they soon take wing to distant<br>
forests or settle here instead, captioned<br>
<br>
on a perfectly illusory perch?<br>
