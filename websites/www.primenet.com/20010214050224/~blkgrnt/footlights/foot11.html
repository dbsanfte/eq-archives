A LETTER TO THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR<br>
<br>
Chris Sorochin<br>
<br>
Mein Lieber Herr Bundeskanzler:<br>
     <p>As you know, for the past fifty years, my country, the
United States, has considered itself the leader of the "free
world" and a shining moral example for all our allies, including
your country.<br>
     <p>Also, for the past fifty years, your country has struggled
to come to terms with and make amends for the inhuman acts
perpetrated in the name of Germany during the Third Reich.
     <p>I am pleased to inform you that you no longer need castigate
yourselves for your past, nor need you continue to maintain
public exhibitions commemorating this shameful part of German
history.<br>
     <p>As you're no doubt aware, this year is the fiftieth
anniversary of the atomic annihilation of the Japanese cities of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Our national museum, the Smithsonian,
had planned an exhibit showing not only the hideous effects of
the bombings on human beings, but also the disagreement among
military experts on their necessity and the continuing legacy of
atomic weapons and testing, including some experiments on
unsuspecting civilians that would make your Dr. Mengele envious.
But it was not to be. A coalition of veterans' groups and
reactionary politicians threatened to cut funding for the
Smithsonian if it went ahead with the exhibit as planned,and so
it was finally reduced t-o just the fuselage of the Enola Gay, the
plane that did the evil deed, with nothing describing its queasy
mission.<br>
     <p>Of course, a few malcontents attempted to undermine the unveiling 
with banners and pictures of the victims. 
Several even managed to pour blood and ashes on the sacred aircraft itself. 
Others have tried to verbally ruin everyone's 
day of fairytale history, but I hear that on one occasion, a group of patriotic 
tourists, determined that no unpleasant truths would reach their ears, drowned them 
out by singing "God Bless America.<br>
     <p>So, my suggestion to your country is that you follow our lead and refuse to 
acknowledge any chapter of your history that isn't flattering to the egos of your 
citizens, particularly the military. 
You should highlight how necessary the Nazis were for Germany's pride and prosperity and 
emphasize the positives of Hitler--like Volkswagens and the autobahns and how the trains 
ran on time and there was law and order. And get rid of those embarrassing exhibits at 
Dachau and Buchenwald. I'm surprised that Wehrmacht veterans' associations have allowed 
them for so long. Why, children might actually see these things and conclude that blind 
loyalty to one's country could be dangerous! Where would we be if everyone thought like that?
     The concentration camp buildings themselves can remain for historic interest, but get rid 
of all that other stuff about the victims and how they suffered. People always suffer in wars 
and we have to have wars, don't we? Anyone who attempts to inject negativity into these "politically 
cleansed" exhibits can be arrested or merely rendered inaudible with a rousing chorus of "Deutschland iiber Alles"
Learn from us: If you want to be a proud, powerful and mindlessly complacent nation, don't be so honest about yourselves. That, as Phil Gramm would say, is the recipe for our
       <p>Isn't it delicious? cake. 
<p>No apologies;no regrets.<br>

<br>
