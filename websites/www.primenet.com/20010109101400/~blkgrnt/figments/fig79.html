<b><h3>Hunt At Langley <br></h3></b>
<br>
<u>From JFK: Lines of  Fire</u>
<br>
<br>
I have nothing fo fight with. Am <br>
taking to the woods. I<br>
cannot wait for you ...(white noise).<br>
<br>
After the slaughter the White Houre ordered <br>
navy task force destroyers<br>
to move in and pick up stragglers,<br>
men in boats, on rafts, wounded<br>
clinging to bits of wreckage. <br>
A reconnaissance jet spotted<br>
a few survivors<br>
in the eater, on the beachhead<br>
only vultures.<br>
<br>
At Langley,<br>
we wept silently. Never<br>
had I seen<br>
a room lull of men<br>
in tears<br>
Somrune remembered Nino Diaz<br>
and his mutineers. His ship<br>
was ordered to the U.S. naval base<br>
at Viques Island where the marines <br>
disarmed them. We wanted<br>
no more trouble from Senor Diaz<br>
The president agreed to meet<br>
the six C.R.C officials. All<br>
had sons, brothers, nephews <br>
in the brigade. I thought<br>
of Tony, Mire, and Dr. Maceo <br>
and tears rolled down my face.<br>
<br>
·"Will you escort them to The White House?"<br>
I can't face them; they trusted me<br>
and I can't face them.<br>
<br>
Dulles, Cabell, and Bisell <br>
were summarily dismissed, <br>
thrown to the wolves<br>
to enpiate administration guilt.<br>
The White House whitewashed <br>
the New Frontier by heaping <br>
excrement on us. Privately, <br>
the president vowed<br>
to splinter the agency <br>
into a thousand pieces<br>
and scatter us to the winds. <br>
I issued one more war communique <br>
denying there had been an invasion, <br>
only a resupply effort to the guerillas <br>
in the Escambray, and the landing party <br>
had reached their comrades<br>
when in fact they<br>
were dead,<br>
imprisoned,<br>
or struggling through the Zapata swamps<br>
<br>
Sick of lying and deception,<br>
of political compromise<br>
and military defeat,<br>
I went home.<br>
peeling my socks off<br>
I realized I hadn't changed<br>
them in a week I couldn't eat. <br>
I showered, slept, still<br>
couldn't eat, fixrd a martini, a<br>
nd another and another and wept. <br>
This was the worst thing<br>
since we lost China.<br>

<h3><b>My Brilliant Career</b></h3>
<br>

It seemed dad was always<br>
at sea. When I turned eighteen<br>
he finally let me tag along<br>
on a Christmas cruise to Cuba.<br>
Our arrival coincided with the revolution.<br>
I fell in with the companeros, <br>
fell for Fidel, and he for me.<br>
When dad set sail I stayed behind.<br>
Fidel and I had a child, were happy<br>
despite his absences, his infidelities. Eighteen<br>
months later CIA double agent Francisco Fiorini,<br>
Cuban airforce chief of security, warned me<br>
Fidel was planning to murder me and our baby<br>
(I didn’t know Fiorini was CIA, only that<br>
he was Fidel's trusted assistant) We fled to Miami,<br>
where I was recruited by The Company, concocting plots<br>
to murder my former lover, and occasionally transporting weapons. <br>
The plots all flopped and my contact agent, E. Howard Hunt, <br>
code named Eduardo, instructed me to kill Fidel myself.<br>
Eduardo gave me poison capsules to drop into Fidel's drink, assuring <br>
me there would he no search at customs (he was right, there wasn't) <br>
but on the plane I lost my nerve, knew I could never murder<br>
the father of my child, went to the lavatory and hid<br>
the capsules in a jar of cold cream. When I tried<br>
to retrieve them in my hotel room that evening<br>
they had dissolved and I discarded the jar’s <br>
contents in the commode. The assignment<br>
aborted, Fidel and I enjoyed a relaxed reunion.<br>
Though 1 couldn't kill him, I at least managed<br>
to steal certain secrets, about which Pm nut<br>
at liberty to elaborate. Back in Miami, I resumed <br>
my former activities, joined by Fiorini, who now <br>
called himself Frank Sturgis, whom Eduardo put <br>
in charge of me. In November 1963 Frank and I<br>
set off on what st first seemed like just another<br>
gun running trip in a two car caravan with<br>
three Cubans and their Company contact agent<br>
Gerry Patrick Hemming. We started from a CIA<br>
safe house in Miami manned by agent Alexander Rourke<br>
and his Cuban assistant Orlando Bosch, who both<br>
stayed behind after loading the weapons machine guns,<br>
rifles, hand guns, thirty eights, forty fives, M16s, M1s,<br>
shot guns--in the trunk of the second, the back <br>
up car. Frank and I drove the lead car, reaching <br>
our destination, a Dallas motel on November 21. <br>
Eduardo came by and gave Frank an envelope of cash<br>
for the so-called operation (I still didn't know<br>
its nature) which Frank counted and stuffed in his pocket,<br>
saying "that’s enough." An hour later Eduardo left <br>
Jack Ruby came by. By now I knew this was different<br>
from other jobs. This wasn’t just gun running. <br>
This was big, very big, and I wanted to get out<br>
of it. I told Frank 1 wanted to leave. He said <br>
it was a very big operation but my part wasn’t <br>
dangerous; I was to be a decoy. "Please Frank, <br>
let me get out, I want to go back to my baby<br>
in Miami" He finally agreed and drove me<br>
Lo the airport. I flew to Miami, picked up<br>
the kid, flew to New York and stayed<br>
with my mother in New Jersey, About a week later<br>
the FBI came by, took me to their New York headquarters <br>
and mostly asked about my former lover. I told them <br>
about my Miami associations, the trip to Dallas, <br>
everything; they said they already knew, didn't want<br>
to go into it. Those were CIA activities, not FBI.<br>
<br>
Despite my having chickened out twice before, Frank offered <br>
me a job on another CIA project, saying "in Dallas you missed <br>
the really big one.  We killed the president that day.<br>
You could have been part of it -- you know, part of <br>
history. You should have stayed. It was safe<br>
Everything was covered in advance No arrests,<br>
no real newspaper investigation. It was all<br>
covered, very professional."<br>

<h2><b>If You Can Understand</b></h2>
v
<br>
David knew Lee<br>
when Oswald was chicken<br>
and later. I myself<br>
met someone introduced to me as Leon <br>
Oswald, had sex with him, a very<br>
fleet, passing meeting. He looked a helluva <br>
lot like him, but it's highly unlikely<br>
this was the same Lee Oswald.<br>
David did tell me<br>
Lee Harvey Oswald did not<br>
kill the president.<br>
He said one gunman fired<br>
from a sewer opening along<br>
the parade route, another from<br>
the grassy knell, and someone from behind.<br>
<br>
David drove to Houston<br>
the night of the 22nd<br>
to fly the assassins<br>
on to Mexico<br>
and eventually South Africa,<br>
which did not have an extradition <br>
treaty with the U.S. They had flown <br>
a single engine plane out<br>
of some little airfield between<br>
Dallas and Fort Worth and David <br>
had a twin engine plane ready<br>
for them--that was the purpose<br>
of his mad dash through a driving <br>
rainstorm from New Orleans. But their <br>
plane crashed<br>
off the coast near Corpus<br>
Christi. Apparently<br>
they tried to make it to Mexico<br>
on their own.<br>
<br>
David wasn’t a red baiter.<br>
He really believed<br>
Kennedy was a Communist, or <br>
being controlled by Communists. <br>
David had a deep<br>
love for his country,<br>
believed we were in danger<br>
of being invaded, that the missiles <br>
had never been removed from Cuba <br>
and there was going to be an all out <br>
atomic holocaust in the U.S. I don't know <br>
if you can understand<br>
the depth of his conviction--he was very <br>
religious, would wear priest robes<br>
and perform the Mass.<br>
<br><br>
around David had any visible <br>
means of support-- the money <br>
was put up by Carlos Marcello, <br>
the person most closely aligned<br>
with the people who actually did <br>
engineer the killing. Some of the<br>
characters who were brought together<br>
on Nov.  22, 1963, there was no way<br>
they could have been working in concert. <br>
They were all manipulated very cleverly<br>
--by someone in government pulling the strings.<br>
<br>
David called me<br>
here in San Francisco<br>
shortly before his death, said <br>
he was going to be killed. I said, <br>
"What are you drinking?<br>
"No, really." <br>
"Why can’t you come out here?" <br>
"I can't leave the South."<br>
I don‘t want to come out<br>
there with all those Communists."<br>
That was it. The next<br>
thing I knew, he was dead. <br>
They said he killed<br>
himself. But he didn't.<br>
You know it, and I know it. <br>

<h3><b>MY SPY</b></h3>
<br>
<br>
Here was this guy whose teeth had all been reworked,<br>
plenty of gold: had to be government work<br>
(the only other expensive mouth I’d seen like that<br>
was an uncle who was a Ford executive).<br>
Good looking man, trim, close-shaven, wearing<br>
a dark blue suit, summer weave,<br>
white shirt and regimental tie,<br>
highly polished black shoes. The guy<br>
looked about as out of place, to steal a phrase<br>
from Raymond Chandler, as  "a tarantula on a piece<br>
of angel food."  I mean, the Venice West was the ultimate<br>
beatnik coffeehouse in those days. I could see<br>
people running around whispering, "cop,<br>
cop." Well, obviously no real cop would come in<br>
dressed like that. I sat down and we started talking.<br>
He began by saying he was interested in and sympathetic to<br>
our organizational activities in the Santa Monica-Venice area,<br>
told me he was an exofficer with Army Intelligence, had done some <br>
hard thinking about his rule in the past, claimed to have<br>
friends and connections with various law enforcement agencies,<br>
and access to certain files, such as the one he showed me<br>
that came, he claimed, from the LAPDs Red Squad. Accurate, <br>
though somewhat dated, it contained the names of several friends <br>
who had worked with me on several projects. That's when<br>
he offered to help through his connections, saying<br>
he couldn t be as active as we were for personal reasons.<br>
We had a few beers and I asked him to prove his good intentions<br>
by tracing two licence plate numbers we suspected were cops.<br>
The next day he had the information, blew the cover off<br>
a narc, so I figured whoever he was and whatever his loyalty,<br>
it wasn't to the LAPD Richard Nagell was a charming man. And while <br>
I felt he was sincerely interested in what we were doing and dis-<br>
echanted with American foreign policy, at the same time I suspected <br>
he was also a spook, checking me out fur some unknown reason. <br>
Hell, I had nothing to hide. I’d even entertained FBI<br>
agents because I was intrigued with all this business <br>
of saving America from people like me. So I accepted <br>
Richard for what he was. Years later I would read:<br>
<br>
When Jim Garrison’s investigation was made public in 1967, <br>
Vaughn Snipes sent a letter to the Orleans Parish DA’s office <br>
disavowing any unlawful connection with me.<br>
I had investigated Snipes and his wife Priscilla<br>
in conjunction with my inquiry about Oswald.<br>
I witnessed one of ihe two Cubans who were associating <br>
with Oswald in August and September 1963 entering <br>
Snipes’  "On The Beach Bookstore" in Venice<br>
on two separate occasions. Snipes, who once boasted<br>
he was a good shot with a rifle was considered<br>
for recruitment to hit JFK during the latter’s June visit <br>
to the Beverly Hilton for the premier screening <br>
of  "PT-109." That project never materialized.<br>
<br>
That June Richard tried to check himself into<br>
the Brentwood VA hospital, was seen by a shrink<br>
in the outpatient clinic, but wasn’t admitted.<br>
And there I was, this crazy bastard who'd been<br>
to the Cuban embassy in Mexico City, helped run<br>
the L.A. Fair Play for Cuba Committee, tied<br>
into all these left wing groups My bookstore<br>
was in the middle of junkie paradise. The word<br>
on the beach was that I was a shooter. I put that out <br>
intentionally, because I didn I want to be<br>
knifed for my $25 a day receipts at the end<br>
of the night. I didn't hide the fact that there were <br>
guns in my bookstore and in my house. It was certainly <br>
known to the cops and the FB1 and Nagell knew it. <br>
wasn't going to shoot any of them. What’s really <br>
weird is, there was this little joke I had for a while.<br>
I used to talk about Nagell with my second wife and she <br>
would say, "what do you think that was all about?" <br>
And I’d say, "I think they were looking for somebody <br>
to shoot Kennedy and I was supposed to be Oswald." <br>
