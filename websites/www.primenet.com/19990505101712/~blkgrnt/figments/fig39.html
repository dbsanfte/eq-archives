<h3>Family Gathering<br></h3>

<br>
We used to live in a huge mansion all together<br>
Above a supposedly hidden cave<br>
Every year, we would have a meeting in our cave<br>
We could invite friends—<br>
Some more than others<br>
My mother could invite the most<br>
Because she had 143,000 live ones<br>
And 247,000 dead ones<br>
On this particular occasion she invited 81<br>
Out of curiosity I went to the meeting early<br>
But there was no one there because<br>
They were still filming a war movie<br>
Then I went to the real meeting (reluctantly)<br>
But I had to leave early because I had packed-up<br>
The wrong things—a bag full of stuffed animals<br>
I went to return them to my old closet—<br>
But it had already been sealed shut.<br>
