    Reflections<br>
<br>
Michael R. Baldwin<br>
<br>
<br>
Over pale ale and hardwood floors<br>
We talked of guilty ambitions and hidden smiles<br>
Those moments of candlelight reflections found in her eyes<br>
Were sincere and comfortable, even in the mist of butterflies<br>
The way her hair fell down about her face     <br>
Just enough to hide what should be      <br>
Just enough to show what could be...      <br>
...was intoxicating.<br>
<br>
Under an overcast sky and stretching tree limbs<br>
We shared generalities and specifics of our heart essays <br>
As reflections of the lights across the water smiled in <br>
her eyes<br>
She searched for answers...<br>
    	In the whispers of the wind<br>
     	Through the consequences of the sinned      <br>
     	In the brightness of the light      <br>
Through the darkness of the night.<br>
<br>
Even as I held her there, on a wet, wooden park bench <br>
While she played with the knee hole strings of my ragged jeans <br>
She was in someone else's sky...<br>
