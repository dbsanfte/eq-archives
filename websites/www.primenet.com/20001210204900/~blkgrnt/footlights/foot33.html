A good libretto, even an impressionist, double-exposed or portmanteau-ed one, follows most of the rules of simple dramaturgy. Balanchine once said the perfect type plot for a dramatic narrative ballet was the story of the Prodigal Son. Once there was a man who had everything, then he had nothing; finally he had everything again —Lincoln Kirstein, Ballet Alphabet (1939)<p>

A romantic student rages against society and himself until fate in the form of a fellow student lends a sympathetic hand, teaching him the value of community.
  	When a young woman appears in her nightgown at the door of a local hotel, her fiancé renounces her in public; but when he finds her sleepwalking over to his own house, he escorts her, apparently still asleep, directly to the church, hoping that once they reside together, the woman's somnambulation will cease.

sunny country; and once she follows him home, she tragically succumbs to a sunstroke, melting away much like the snow-maiden of traditional myth.  
Meant to be a parable of masochism, this ballet confines several athletic performers to a single space open at the front but otherwise five feet on each side.<p>
The Baseball Game is a ballet divided into nine sections that the program note calls innings. The large company is divided into two groups, each with nine dancers. Each performance has such variable results that stagehands can be observed going through motions that resemble the making of wagers.

  	On a green lawn, twenty-eight dancers, dressed in slightly different shades of green, blend into the natural surroundings as they move about.

While a young man, lying on a warm beach, picks up a conch shell to discover its sound, a sea nymph, watching him from a hiding place, emerges from her hiding place to meet him, and the dance they do together resembles coition in water.<p>
  	When a provincial ballet impresario visits a metropolitan dancing school, hoping to find his next prima ballerina, the cynical teacher tries to interest him in the least talented girl. The irony is that the ugly duckling, thanks to training and support, becomes an international star.<p>
  	When a demonic artist seduces an aristocratic woman and then asks to live with her, she sees no solution to her sexual-social dilemma other than poisoning him.
  	The development of the prima dancers is portrayed through showing first beginning children at the barre, then adolescents in class, and finally soloists exhibiting their bravura techniques, against a continuous background of their eating a proper dancer's diet.
A young man unhappily engaged to marry a woman chosen for him, succumbs instead to a lady drug dealer and her exotic potions.

  	This ballet portrays a mysterious fertility rite in which first an old dog and then a young woman are sacrificed.<p>
A European sailor returns to his native fishing village with an African woman whom his neighbors at first find exotic but later reject as alien to their narrow minds.<p>
The protracted conflict between two feuding families is resolved when a grandmother of one falls in love with a grandfather in another and, realizing what problems their relationship makes, the septuagenarians commit suicide together, prompting a necessary reconciliation over the tombs of the star-crossed lovers—a tragically "happy" end.
  	Summoning back to life several nuns who had violated their vows, our wicked protagonist gets them to dance with him, first clothed and then nude.<p>

Two young people flirt, embrace, and make love in a changing landscape of projected images from classic paintings. 
The young female protagonist gives her life to save the leader of a crowd of revolutonaries from an assassin's bullet, thus becoming a heroine immortalized in song and, here, in dance.<p>

  	Several individuals, representing various sexual persuasions, attempt to comfort one another in a socially disintegrating world.<p>
  	When a woman who fears she might lose her lover to her younger sister gives herself to a stranger, whom she finds disgusting, her lover accepts her apology, responding with sympathy and understanding.
