<h2>MAMIE ELLA</h2><br>

	Thank you so much for visiting me here in the Amarillo Nursing 
Home. The children are too far away to come here often. The staff is 
nice, but too busy to talk, much less listen to us old folks. Not that my 
life is such a story. Did you get your tea? Should I start now?<p>
	My name is Mamie Ella Hilburn. I was born December 29th, 1890, in 
Quanah, Texas.<p>
	As a young girl, I wanted to be a teacher. I received an 
appointment to the Denton State Normal College in Texas. I always loved 
to read. Poetry was my favorite reading.<p>
	I married Ancrum Mather Hilburn, August 15th, 1909. He was very 
clever at imitating people and "aping" them, so everyone called him 
"Ape." I had to give up my dream of teaching because women teachers 
couldn't marry, then. Men teachers could. Women couldn't. Anyway, we had 
three babies over eight years so that kept me busy. Ancrum ran a 
newspaper in Shamrock, <The Wheeler County Texian>, when I met him in 
1908. Afterward, Ape decided he wanted to be an actor and went off to 
Chicago to study acting. I had to raise the children myself because Ape 
traveled the Lyceum and Chautauqua circuit with his impersonations.<p>
	My son, Henley Mather, was a rambunctious boy, sometimes got in 
fights, wouldn't mind me. The girls, Mildred and Jean, were good girls, 
Jean was flighty though. Henley got in truancy trouble at school around 
the eighth grade, as I remember. I finally let him quit. I think he was 
an angry boy, a real handful with Ape gone weeks and months at a time. He 
got a job at Mr. Spruells hardware store. Henley was born in 1911.<p>
	Ape came home when my father, George Joshua Duncan died in 1931. 
I got the farm and some money. We tried farming but Ape didn't take the 
hard work well. His father, Thomas Mather retired as a Methodist circuit 
rider and he and Florence came to live with us. Thomas was a 
fire-and-brimstone preacher. He was furious with Ape for wanting to be an 
actor. He thought acting was the most sinful thing. Florence never said 
what she thought of Thomas traveling all the time, same as Ape did.<p>
	Old Mr. Spruell thought the world of Henley. Said "he could sell 
anything to anybody." Electric appliances were becoming popular. I'll 
never forget the time Henley brought home a new electric ice box for me. 
It was a wonder, made it's own ice, too.<p>
	My children got married, the girls all moved away. Henley married 
Otta Hope in 1934. The next year they presented me with a grandson, Wayne 
Mather.<p>
	The depression was bad, you know. Ape was teaching speech and 
elocution at the local schools, but people couldn't afford many electric 
appliances, so Henley was doing poorly. Otta Hope and the baby stayed 
with us while Henley looked for work in Lubbock and Sweetwater.<p>
	Baby Wayne was a delight! As curious as a child could be. There 
weren't many children to play with so he made up his own games and 
imaginary playmates. There's a picture of him, must be about two, in that 
box. He's carrying his grandaddy's box camera around with him, pretending 
to take pictures. He seemed fascinated with everything.<p>
	I used to take him with me in the Model A Ford we had to the 
Shamrock Literary Club meetings. The ladies would pick an author to read 
and meet to discuss the books. Wayne loved crayons and drawing at such an 
early age. I think I've kept every one of them, somewhere. I even have a 
child's drawing table and chair of his. I remember he was a quiet child 
who loved to listen to his grandpa tell stories. Ape could do so many 
stories with his different voices and faces. Most were <very> tall tales, 
but Ape had an attentive audience in his grandson.<p>
	When the second war came, Henley volunteered for the Navy and 
didn't come back until 1944. Florence died that year, followed by Thomas 
Mather in 1945.<p>
	Otta and Wayne stayed with us during the war. After the war, 
Henley and Otta moved away. Henley was able to get a good job selling 
again. Otta said he had to travel a lot. Ha! I know <that> story.<p>
	My grandson has become a very good artist. I always told him he 
as good at making pictures. He writes me loving letters from so many 
places, and always includes a picture in it. A drawing or sometimes a 
photograph. He's tall and thin, just like his grandpa. Has my button 
nose, though. Henley got Ape's nose, that's surely true.<p>
	Ape died six weeks ago.<p>
	I miss that silly old man.<p>

	Sorry, can you reach a tissue for me? My hands have taken to 
trembling of late, just old age. Do you need some more tea? Where was I? <p>
Oh, yes.<p>
	I often think about the Hilburns in my life, Thomas, Ape, Henley, 
and Wayne. They all had a real emotional streak in them. It just came out 
different ways. Thomas could preach with the wrath of God. Ape could 
mesmerize an audience. Henley could get you to want to buy something real 
bad. And my grandson, Wayne could show so much expression in his 
drawings. In their way, all were creative. I think of Florence, myself, 
Otta and my granddaughter-in-law, Patricia. We had to be the anchors to 
emotional men.<p>
 	They could make us laugh, though, as well as cry.<p>
                               ***<p>
	Mamie Ella Hilburn died softly, June 23, 1970.<p>
