TRUST<br>
<br>
Lyric Poem By: Griselda Steiner <br>
<br>
<br>
 I trust your hands<br>
I trust your kiss<br>
In your touch I remember<br>
The youth that passed me by<br>
When light flickers and dies in the night<br>
In my caress you searched for a dream<br>
By blue waters cooled by the moon<br>
Your heart will be transformed<br>
Bound by our roles and ancient mores<br>
We have only chosen moments<br>
I trust your hands<br>
I trust your kiss<br>
In your touch I remember<br>
The youth that passed me by<br>
<br>
