LEBANON RISING<br>
<br>
<br>
By Sheryl Hanna<br>
<br>
<br>
Like the Phoenix<br>
She will rise and soar to the heights of heaven.<br>
From the ashes of her destruction!<br>
<br>
She shall be resurrected:<br>
I can hear her heart begin to beat,<br>
The people of various religions and cultures, <br>
Shall be bound together by the band of unity<br>
Their love, hope and desire<br>
Will breathe the breath of life into the Princess Lebanon!<br>
<br>
The tears of war shall be wiped from her eyes, <br>
The dove with the laurel wreath of peace, <br>
Shall reign over all of her inhabitants, <br>
The fear of fighting from years before<br>
Has been banished forever more!<br>
<br>
Her natural beauty. <br>
Her golden crown, <br>
Shall be restored to her!<br>
<br>
From the top of her head, <br>
To the tips of her feet, <br>
The tranquillity of the sea <br>
Shall be felt by all,<br>
Who dwell within her land! <br>
