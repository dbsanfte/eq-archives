<h3>Chicago Nights</h3><br>

Dreams about Chicago.<br>
Six nights in a row.<br>
Rushed feet on crowded walks. <br>
Breezy lake shore drives. <br>
Barren old hotel rooms<br>
with skinny hallways.<br>
Creaky elevators that arrive <br>
when they feel like it.<br>
<br>
There's a focus on <br>
thick soled shoes.<br>
ancient carpet with<br>
faded rose patterns.<br>
grey slush splashed<br>
against helpless curbs.<br>
I never see faces,<br>
peaks of towering buildings, <br>
Light fixtures above my head.<br>
<br>
In these nightly ventures<br>
ethnic foods skim the surface. <br>
noises crawl through office lobbies, <br>
fast legs are lunch hour strangers. <br>
This nocturnal city<br>
may move me up<br>
from the baseboard heat, <br>
sidewalk cracks and <br>
steaming sewers.<br>
<br>
But then again,<br>
fresh grass planted in <br>
soil rich with newness <br>
knows somebody's gonna leave <br>
the first set of prints.<br>
On this seventh night<br>
in Chicago dreams,<br>
the guts of life<br>
begin at the bottom.<br>
