<h3>We Never Talk<br></h3>
<br>
Steven Bolia<br>
<br>
<br>
There lurks in the center of my heart<br>
An overweight girl with an artificial leg<br>
And a crooked-teeth smile on her face<br>
I have passed her on the freeway<br>
<br>
And on walks through the woods—we never talk<br>
And though I try to sway her in many directions<br>
She is always careful never to lose her balance.<br>
