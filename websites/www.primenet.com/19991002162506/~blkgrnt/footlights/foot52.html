<h3>THE RIVER FLOWS EAST IN SPRING<br></h3>
<br>

The water moved slowly, without picking up any speed. No waves 
hindered the gradual journey. The banks were muddy and possessed small 
mosses and other plant growth of indefinable types. Several insects 
buzzed around my ears, refusing to leave me alone. At first I tried to 
swat them away, but this just made things worse. It would incite them, 
almost into a frenzy. I've long since gotten used to it. Now I hardly notice.<p>
	A dead fly of unusually large size floated along. It's legs were 
shriveled up and compressed against it's chest as if in a final vain 
attempt to keep the life force from exiting it's corporal domain. The 
action was, or course, purely imaginary as it had long since ceased to be 
a living thing and now simply recalled the empty shell which envelops us 
all. The mortal coin of flesh as Javiar was so fond of saying.<p>
	I sat next to the yellowish water and watched the corpse continue 
it's final voyage down the river off to the east until it was out of 
site. And then I put my head down in the mud and let the cool sludge 
slowly mold itself to my head. I like feeling my head sink, and then the 
final blissful moment when the mud has covered my ears, the awful buzzing 
leaves my world and I can rest in peace. I had almost reached that 
perfect state of satisfaction when the loud growls pierced into my head 
like a thunderbolt. For a moment I laid, imagining myself ignoring the 
audible intruder and releasing my mind to the cosmos, but a second smack 
from the persistent sound once again assaulted me. Slowly I raised my 
head from the mud. I let the damp earth glide down my neck and back for a 
second before I turned my attention to my latest encounter.<p>
	I looked over the river from where I last perceived the sound and 
staring me directly in the face was some kind of small dog. It had no 
hair, only patches of gray stubble strategically placed around the facial 
area. Without even thinking I recoiled in disgust. It was Oscar. He 
looked at me even more sternly. I knew I had made a mistake. Oscar hated 
it when people gave some outside knowledge of how ugly he was. Had I been 
next to him and not across the river he would undoubtedly have torn my 
heart out from my chest and buried it under the rocks like he did to the 
others. He would have even crossed the river and done this to me like he 
had to Silvio, but he could not cross today, or tomorrow or the day after 
because it was spring and not even Oscar would dare cross the river when 
it was flowing east.<p>
	After some time, which seemed like hours, but almost certainly 
wasn't years, I began to move my eyes away from Oscar's. And for a moment 
I knew just what it must have felt like to experience absolute hatred. 
Which seemed strange to me because the last time I felt that way was when 
I was hungry and that indeed had been long ago.<p>
	I suddenly remembered why I was down at the river at this most 
odd hour. The time was spring, and in the spring the river flows east.<p>
	Slowly I say the giant vessel appear. Out from the distance and 
the mountains it came. The first part I saw was the large sails of the 
ship. White as the deepest of skies, fluttering in the wind like some 
giant butterfly which had just emerged from it's cocoon and now was ready 
to live the rest of it's life. Then the brown hull and bow of the ship 
came into clear view. At this point I noticed that the ship was indeed 
the one I was waiting for. I checked my compass again and slipped my coin 
out of my pocket. Traveling isn't cheep you know. One must be prepared 
for anything and today I was indeed prepared. I had been prepared for 
this day for my entire life and now was the culmination of what I knew 
was to come.<p>
	Almost as an afterthought I looked over to the other bank of the 
river. This was a mistake. My first mistake. Oscar was still there. When 
he noticed I looked at him again be raised his mangy eyebrows. His head 
jerked up as if being pulled by an invisible string attached to heaven. 
First with one leg and then the other he hunched his front side up from 
the mud. And then like a weed exploding from the earth the rest of his 
body elevated itself to the surface. I was still unable to shake my view.
	Once Oscar had established himself upon the surface he began to 
inch towards me. I knew I was safe. The time was spring and the river was 
flowing east, not even Oscar wouldn't dare cross the river when it was 
flowing east. And yet Oscar did not stop. His steady march continued 
towards me. Slowly he lifted his body up onto his thin hind legs until he 
stood only on them. His front legs reached out towards me with broken 
claws. Claws which had cut Silvio's and Javiar's hearts out. Claws which 
now longed to relieve me of mine.<p>
	Oscar's exposed belly was a pinkish yellow, with blue and red 
veins pulsating. A small projection erupted from his midsection and 
pointed accusingly towards me. I felt the horror and revulsion overwhelm 
my mind. I tried to scream, I couldn't. My body did not respond to my 
base desire to escape the horrible scene. I was helpless, like Silvio and 
Javiar had been.<p>
	Oscar continued to march towards me. He set one foot in the 
water. Then another and then another. He kept right on marching as the 
yellowish water brisked by his hairless body. I could still see the 
midsection pulsating, throbbing, this time faster than before. But 
suddenly the presence came. The presence which everyone feared and loved 
at the same time came. Slowly two plant-like stems erupted from the 
water. One of the stems was green, the other black. The black stem was on 
Oscars right, the green one on his left. They began to twist around Oscar 
like a snake. Moving delicately like silk. After enveloping him, Oscar 
became aware of what was happening. In vain Oscar attempted to fight the 
fate which met him. He began to struggle, but the stems just twisted 
around him tighter. Even his claws which had plucked the hearts out of 
both Silvio and Javiar were not enough to save Oscar from the horrible 
fate which awaited him. That was the way of things. Things happen when 
they happen and not a second sooner.<p>
	I witnessing the stems squeeze Oscar until his mortal shell began 
to crumble. First his blue, pearly eyes popped out, but clung defiantly 
to his body by the their strings. Then I his mustard-colored blood began 
to seep out from where the stems held him tight. Oscar gave out one last 
yelp. Then with no particular speed, the head came undone from the body 
and splashed into the opaque, yellowish water. The stems quickly 
retreated back to their underwater world, taking the captured body with 
them. <p>
	I watched the head float down the river. I tried several times to 
take my eyes away from it, but his left eye, which was bobbing in the 
water next to the head kept staring at me. Just as intently as before, 
only this time with even more hatred than before.<p>
	It was Oscar's own fate. He dared cross the river when it was 
flowing east.<p>
	Once the eye was out of site, I gazed back in the direction of 
the incoming ship. It had made little progress. I checked my pocket for 
my coin. I couldn't find it. For a brief moment panic began to sink into 
my body. If I did not have my coin how could I be prepared? Then I opened 
my hand and took inventory of it's contents. The coin rested upon my 
palm. The panic in my body subsided. I was prepared.<p>
	The ship began to inch closer and closer to me. I looked down, 
and realized that while I was standing there I had sunk nearly to my 
waist in the mud. I lapped my hand against the mud for a while and then 
began to move myself out. It wasn't too hard; it never was too hard.<p>
	Finally the ship pulled up next to me. A small rope was tossed 
over the side. I reached out my hand and grabbed hold of it with a firm 
grip. And then for no explicable reason I clenched my grip even more, I 
kept clenching until I observed my hand turn from it's pale color to red, 
and finally to white. Then I saw a trickle of blood emerge and slide down 
my hand into the mud. I was sure I has holding on tight enough, but I 
wanted to make no more mistakes. Looking back at Oscar was a mistake. My 
first mistake and it had nearly cost me my life, a relatively small cost, 
but I was hoping I could keep myself perfect for the voyage ahead.<p>
	The rope began to ascend and I with it. My grip was sure. As it 
neared the top Rodrigo was there. He flashed a big, toothy smile at me. I 
was glad to see him here. I hadn't expected to see him, but it was a 
welcome relief. The rope slowly deposited me aboard the deck of the 
vessel and coiled itself back up, going back to sleep on the floor. 
Almost immediately the vessel began it's journey.<p>
	Rodrigo asked me why I took so long, and yet he didn't say a 
word. I responded that I had made a mistake. To this he lost his smile 
and turned away immediately. Rodrigo then began a brisk walk towards the 
cabin. I knew Rodrigo wouldn't like me to make a mistake. Mistakes were 
why we are here now. I made the first mistake.<p>
	After several days of standing and waiting for Rodrigo to return 
I walked to the cabin. I feared my mistake was more grave than I 
suspected. For why would Rodrigo have not come to stand with me for so 
many days now? The door was ajar and I pushed it open. As I pushed the 
door, I suddenly made a realization. I looked down at my hands and body 
and realized that they weren't me. I was in control of them; other people 
are also in control of them. I then began to understand; I understood the 
gravity of my position. I began to fear that Rodrigo had made the second 
mistake.<p>
	As I opened the door I breathed a sigh of relief. He had not made 
the second mistake. He had done exactly as he should and thus only one 
mistake had been made so far. Rodrigo was very smart indeed. His body was 
hung on a rope. His lifeless body swayed back and forth. His tongue hung 
out of his mouth in a twisted fashion. Yes, indeed he had done the right 
thing.<p>
	But then for another instance I suddenly became panic-stricken 
again. Had he forgotten any of the steps? Had he done everything 
accordingly, or would a second mistake (admittedly, much smaller) been 
made? As I rushed around the cabin I was once again stricken with relief. 
I found his teeth on a small wooden table next to the door. Everything 
was fine. Rodrigo was a very wise man indeed. He has always made the 
right choices. Only one mistake had been made so far.<p>
	For a year and a day I slept in the cabin. I knew it would be a 
good idea to give time to the river, as to not rush it. For the river was 
eternal and nothing else was. It liked to be waited on. I then stepped 
outside the cabin back on the deck of the ship.<p>
	I looked over the side of the ship and saw the green water. I had 
reached it. And only one mistake had been committed which meant I still 
had a chance. I dove into the water and watched the ship sail away from 
me. I kept my eyes on it until I could no longer perceive it. At this 
point everything around me looked the same. Direction had become 
meaningless, more importantly, I was doing the right thing. I opened up 
my hand and looked at it again. The coin was still there. In the places 
were it was touching my flesh a thick layer of rot was consuming me. I 
couldn't help it. I had to do it.<p>
	Then I shoved my hand into my mouth and bit down as hard as I 
could. I kept chewing and gnawing until I felt my hand wrench itself free 
from my wrist and rest inside my mouth unattached to me. Everything was 
going according to plan.<p>
	I dove deep into the water, the green was all around me, it was 
so opaque I couldn't see more than a couple of inches in front of me. I 
kept swimming down as hard as I could.<p>
	My eyes began to burn. I knew I couldn't shut them, but I wanted 
to. I kept them open, and the burning sensation continued to sharpen. 
Finally my eyes gave way and I felt the water gush around inside my eye 
sockets. My eyes were gone but it was no worry to me. I no longer needed 
them. I had traversed the part which required my eyes and now they would 
only be a liability. And after all, it was because of them that I had 
committed the first mistake. With them gone I had purified myself.<p>

BIOGRAPHY<br>
I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina on June 19, 1976. During 
Argentina's "dirty war" my family fled the country to America. Since then 
I've lived in Denver Colorado, Bloomington Indiana, and finally Urbana 
Illinois.<p>
	Currently I'm a student of astronomy at the University of 
Illinois. I see writing as a artistic and emotional outlet from the 
drudgery of a stagnant life.<p>
