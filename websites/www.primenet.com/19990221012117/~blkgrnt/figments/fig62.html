Matrimony<br>

<br>
it's ruthless at home when the father's a bum,<br>
for his love should not lie in a bottle of rum.<br>
it's ruthless at home when the mother is bruised<br>
and a fall from the stairs is the only accused.<br>
it's ruthless at home when the love they once had<br>
is vanquished like magic, like a whimsical fad.<br>
it's ruthless at home when the children can't sleep,<br>
kept up by the screams of demons mom keeps.<br>
it's ruthless at home when an eight year old boy<br>
does not know how to fall in love with his toys.<br>
it's ruthless at home when daddy's in bed,<br>
and it's not with mom, but with his mistress instead.<br>
it's ruthless at home when mommy must cry<br>
and search in her soul for the power to try.<br>
it's ruthless at home when The Love is not owned;<br>
it's ruthless at home when they're both all alone.<br>
