<br>
Because I heard the aria<br>
        of a single violin<br>
        at nightfall in the park,<br>
                they made me wrap<br>
                cold fingers around a pen<br>
                to write -<br>
        There is no such thing.<br>
<br>
Because I hummed to a musical score<br>
        no one could hear<br>
        when walking on my own,<br>
                they demanded that I<br>
                purge my thoughts <br>
                in writing a thousand times -<br>
        I hear no such music.<br>
<br>
Because I was not able<br>
        to keep the aria to myself,<br>
                they made me form<br>
                the letters of my symptoms<br>
                on sheets of lined paper -<br>
        There is no such music.<br>
<br>
Because I had to be silent<br>
        in the numbness of my writings;<br>
Because the pen in my hand<br>
        began to dictate my thoughts,<br>
                the aria no longer came to me.<br>
<br>
Because I soon forgot<br>
        the strains of a violin,<br>
        I was returned to the silence<br>
        of the streets.<br>
<br>
Because the music ceased to be, <br>
        I was once more free.<br>
<br>
Because the silence and freedom<br>
        were too much,<br>
<br>
        I no longer am.<br>
<br>
