Shelby Stephenson<br>
<br>
<i>for Charles Ray Barbour<br></i>
<br>
<br>
In the summer of '44 when I was six,<br>

I heard a squeak<br>

and saw one foot<br>

poised<br>

on the bottomstep<br>

of the highplanked porch,<br>

the neat kahki-crease,<br>

his hat a tan wedge,<br>

wide belt, <br>

stride like the songs of the time—<br>

"Smoke on the Water," "Over There," "Atomic Power."<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>

FIELD POEM<br>
<br>
<br>
Hit the mind another grunt,<br>

force the hand,<br>

undo the ear from the outer shuck,<br>

the heaps of corn<br>
piling up in the middles between the rows,<br>
Septemher peas, adrenaline...<br>
voices up and down, narrow and wide cover an hour,<br>
conjure forever.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


TODDY<br>
<br>

Oh wizened face and eyes,<br>
Uncle in the cups--<br>
Mergins of damsels kissed, <br>
caressed-My eyes squinch to see<br>
Which spirit's mine.<br>
<br>
