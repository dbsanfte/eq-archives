THAT NIGHT<br>
<br>
James Snydal<br>
<br>
<br>
Switching to a private plane in Kansas City,<br>
he found twenty-five hundred citizens<br>
waiting to glimpse him.  For two hours, those high<br>
school kids and young married couples, beside<br>
<br>
themselves with happiness, had waited. Now,<br>
there was no microphone at all.  The crowd<br>
"pinned him against the plane, pulled at his clothes,"<br>
and started to scream.  Still, Bobby began to smile<br>
<br>
at the eager crowd.  Quietly he touched<br>
many hands.  Bobby smiled and nodded<br>
encouragement.  He touched many hands.<br>
Those people had waited for two hours to see their man.<br>
<br>
Only those closest to him could hear, but Bobby<br>
started to speak.  That voice they knew gave<br>
his first campaign speech: "I will need<br>
your help.  But if you work hard..., we will win."<br>
<br>
Bobby didn't have to have any bylines<br>
to get in the news; his movements were our headlines.<br>
<br>
