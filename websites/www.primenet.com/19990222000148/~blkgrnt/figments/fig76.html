<br>
           	        
  	quiet groups of old beatniks, ersatz 
dharma bums, continuously slumming in the 
tropics of "beatitude." lost in their opaque 
psychological interiors, reliving childhood 
hurts, petulant infantile angers over slights 
unrevenged,<p>
<br>
  	junior-grade Kerouacs and Cassidys 
talking about the glorious "Road to Emmaus." 
yet each day their energies remain idled,<p>
<br>
 	dull, humorless audience, deaf to new 
magic. a "risen moment." the young shaman-
philosopher's call to follow me,<p>
<br>
 	necessary reality of tavern, coffee 
house locale for silent regular musings, 
as if each morning like Scarlett's Tara, 
they can declare "it stands,"<p>
<br>
continuous cerebral masturbation, never 
reaching orgasm, wisdom always stillborn.<br>
<br>
   	timid victims resisting the risk of 
change, lost to the desires for comfort and 
convenience, pack, sleeping bag. notebooks, 
shack matches, pork and beans, the road still 
there, but for someone else.<br>
<br>
