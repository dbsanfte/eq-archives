Many are the crossroads of life, <br>
that challenge who we are.<br>
<br>
And<br>
<br>
Many are the decisions made <br>
based on what we want, <br>
rather than,<br>
on who we want to be.<br>
<br>

And soon, we become<br>
the embodiment of our wants, <br>
and dwell in the shallow end <br>
of the ocean of life.<br>
<br>
And when, as always,<br>
life's tides ebb and flow,<br>
the shifting sands of where we dwell, <br>
challenge our foundations.<br>
<br>
And I wonder;<br>
Did I build to close to the shore????<br>
