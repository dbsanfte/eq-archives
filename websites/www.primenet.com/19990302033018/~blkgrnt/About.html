<h2>About 256 SHADES OF GREY...</h2>

<h3><u><b>ABOUT THE PUBLISHER--CLIFFORD J. KURKOWSKI</b></u></h3>

<p>Creating a 'zine like 256 Shades of Grey is no easy task. In fact,
going into the publishing industry was not my first career choice. What I really
wanted to be was an English professor in a small town somewhere in the
Midwest. Okay, so I'm in the Midwest, in a small town, half my dream is
complete. Coming from a big city like New York, where I'm originally from,
I really don't think I would have had this kind of opportunity.
My phrase for this, big fish in a small pond. </p>

<p>My original goal for this 'zine when I first created it with my editors
20 issues ago, was to publish new writers that had a vision, a talent,
and a direction in fiction and poetry for the 21st Century. So far I have succeeded in this goal.
Yes, there are many ups and downs with a 'zine like this, for example, what to print,
how to create a distribution, how big do you want to get, and how far can you go. But, through
all the trials and tribulations I have gone through, I have remained faithful
to our readers and our writers by creating a monthly stepping-stone for
new writers, and by creating a monthly 'zine which is full of entertainment and good reading for the public.
</p>

<p>As I finish the last semester of my coursework in the graduate program for English  at the University of Wisconsin--Eau Claire (Department of English) I know it will be time
to move on and experience new opportunities. Though I won't have my degree
until the end of the year I feel that the time is right for me to move
forward with a career in publishing. Right now I have my goals set on being
the managing editor of a magazine in the Twin Cities area or somewhere else in the country
that I know I could grow. I realized that I have learned a lot by creating a 'zine
like 256, much of it will stay with me forever. In fact, I have probably
gone through as much pain, financial burden, stress, and mental frustration
as any other publisher who has ever started their own magazine.</p>

<p>As of June 1, 1996 I will be setting my sights on working in the
publishing industry as either a managing editor or publicist. I have the
skills, education, determination and know-how to get the job done. But,
I want to make sure I work for a company that is progressive in their views
of an ever-changing multi-media world, and can stimulate my creativity, not repress it.</p>

<p>If you would like to know more about me or have any questions or
comments please feel free to contact me at either: <a href="mailto:blkgrnt@primenet.com">blkgrnt@primenet.com</a>
or call me at 608-241-9577. Many thanks to all of the people who have logged
on to 256 Shades of Grey.</p>
<br>
Enjoy!!<br>

<h3><u><b>HISTORY OF 256 SHADES OF GREY</b></u></h3>

<p>256 SHADES OF GREY was started on January 15th, 1995 by four students
attending the University of Wisconsin/Eau Claire. 256 SHADES OF GREY was
to be an outside project (meaning no affiliation with the University) so
it could fulfill the literary/arts needs of Eau Claire. When the premier
issue of 256 came out, the four of us decided that we would do a mass distribution
of the magazine. This meant distributing it to local taverns, coffee shops,
cafes, the University, and other local businesses. To our surprise, we
seemed to have generated an instant hit on our hands. As our popularity
grew the editorial staff decided to play with 256's surname by calling
it, Eau Claire's underground literary/arts 'zine. At first we deemed it
an underground 'zine because we wanted to print anything, but
because of 256's quick rise in popularity we knew that we weren't going
to be able to print everything and anything.</p>

<p>Later, as 256's popularity strengthened, the editorial staff noticed
that 'zine was now being circulated in the high schools and among other
University professors. We began to get a little worried because we wanted
the 'zine to grow quickly but still have a raw edge to it. From then on
we decided that it was in our best interest to start picking and choosing
what went into 256 and then we decided to call it 256 Shades of Grey, Eau
Claire, Wisconsin's Avant-Pop Literary/Arts 'zine.</p>

<p>Right now, as our 'zine grows in popularity, readership, and stature
we have become more professional. Besides changing our design we have also
been receiving quality work from new and established writers and poets.
Many of the writers that submit to us know we are a small press, a stepping-stone,
to bigger publishing houses and they submit to us because we are professional
in what we do and we do care what kind of writing is out there especially
as we head into the 21st Century. If you would like to know more about
256 Shades of Grey we can be found in the following reference books: POET'S
MARKET, THE INTERNATIONAL DIRECTORY OF LITTLE MAGAZINES AND SMALL PRESSES,
DIRECTORY OF POETRY PUBLISHERS, AND ELECTRONIC JOURNALS, NEWSLETTERS, AND
ACADEMIC DISCUSSION LISTS. As we continue to grow, we would like to ask
our readers to please review our magazine and comment on our writers. Thank
you for logging onto our web site.</p>
