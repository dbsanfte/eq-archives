<h3>MY FATHER'S IRREPRESSIBLE ILLNESS<br></h3>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Another week less between my father <br>
and his death.<br>
We have passed this day together and marked<br>
one week each closer to his own.<br>
<br>
I reach my hands out to him<br>
As I leave<br>
And he looks at them.<br>
Unsure of what to do <br>
He picks up a paper from<br>
the table<br>
and puts it in my hand.<br>
<br>
Unsure of what to do<br>
I open the paper<br>
and read<br>
saying, "Thank you."<br>
