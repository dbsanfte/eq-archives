<P>Bill overslept again. He was late for work every day that week. He worked
in a small lumber- yard on Fourth Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn. He cut
lengths of wood on a circular saw to whatever size the boss said. It was
noisy and dusty work but he liked the smell of saw-dust and the pay was not
so bad. The boss warned Bill that if he were late again he would lose his
job. Bill was dismayed.<BR>
<P>
<P>When Monday came, the buzzer of Bill's alarm was preset to loud and blasted
him in the ear. His arm was out of the bed and reaching for the
snooze-button when the brain woke in a panic to avert the disaster. He was
soon in the shower. He turned the temperature control to as cold as he could
tolerate. In the tiny kitchen he poured himself a black coffee. The sports
section of the    Sunday newspaper was still open to the story he was
reading yesterday. As he took his last sips of coffee, he finished the
article on why the Knicks would not reach the play-offs. He glanced at
himself in the mirror as he left. For an instant he thought that his
reflection's eyes were closed. These dreams are haunting me, Bill thought.
<P>
<P>It was a ten minute walk down the Slope to the lumber-yard. Down to Eighth
Avenue where the tall apartment buildings of Prospect Park West become
elegant tree-lined brownstones. Down to Seventh where the fancy curving
stoops become simpler flights of stone steps. Down below Sixth and Fifth
where the redbrick row houses peter out into old warehouses, crumbling shop
fronts, and vacant lots along Fourth Avenue. The lumber-yard was located at
the bottom of the Slope. 
<P>
<P>Bill looked at his watch. It was only five minutes to eight which meant
that he was early. Bill entered the workshop and to his surprise found it
empty. The lights were on and the machines hummed quietly. The sound of the
machines became louder and louder and louder, until suddenly he was awake
again in bed. The buzzer of the alarm was loud in his ear. His heart pounded
and then sank as he realized he was late again. He ran through the routine
just as before, except he did not stop to read the newspaper. Bill arrived
thirty minutes late and the boss said he was out of a job.
<P>
<P>Bill knew this was serious. He called a doctor he'd seen once when he
caught flu and thought it was turning to pneumonia. Bill told the doctor the
problem of getting up and how he kept dreaming he was going to work. He
asked the doctor if he could give him something to stay awake so he wouldn't
be tricked. The doctor said it was a bad idea. If Bill lost sleep and didn't
dream, his body would soon become exhausted and crave sleep: he would then
find it impossible to get to work on time. Bill did not tell the doctor he
had already lost his job. 
<P>
<P>The doctor said he had a colleague who was conducting a study of sleep at
the Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan. The doctor phoned his colleague
while Bill sat in the waiting room. The doctor said that his colleague would
be pleased to see Bill for a consultation. The research grant would pay for
the consultation. Bill should go tomorrow morning to the address the doctor
had written on a card. Bill saw that it was on the upper East Side on York
Place. It was only a subway ride away. What have I got to lose? Bill thought. 
<P>
<P>It took four attempts for Bill to make it to the consultant. For three days
he dreamed that he went to Grand Army Plaza and took a Two train to Nevins
Street. He then changed for the Four train. He switched again at Grand
Central Station for the Six-local and finally emerged at Sixty-eighth
Street. From there it was an eight or nine-minute walk to the address on the
card. The building looked different each time he arrived, but the sound of
the door buzzer was always the same. He would then wake to find himself in
bed reaching for the alarm. On the fourth attempt he made it to the address
only to find that the receptionist had not expected him. After the missed
appointment she was waiting for him to call to reschedule. Bill thought he
had made the call but realized it was a dream. The receptionist asked him to
take a seat anyway, she would see if the doctor could see him. 
<P>
<P>The doctor did see him and was fascinated to hear Bill's apology about the
mix up. He led Bill to his private consulting room. The doctor asked Bill
many questions about what he called his "sleep patterns" and wrote the
replies on a yellow pad. He then gave a Bill physical examination. Finally,
he asked strange questions. Did Bill ever hear voices when no one was
around? Did anyone in his family have epilepsy? Did he take vitamin
supplements? Had he a drug or drinking problem? What was his highest form of
education? Had he ever been in a serious road accident or had a head trauma? 
<P>
<P>The doctor informed Bill that he thought this was an important case that
required further study. He told Bill that there are hynogogic dreams: those
that take place when someone is about to fall into a deep sleep. He told
Bill that there are hynopompic dreams: those that take place just before
someone wakes. Both types of dream have characteristic content and
distinctive brain patterns. These brain patterns -- called  alpha waves --
can be recorded while a patient sleeps. This must be done to Bill without
delay. The doctor said that Bill was very unusual because those dreams that
come just before waking are usually contentless and function to draw the
dreamer away from the tensions of life. Bill's dreams, however, were
indistinguishable from the ordinary flow of life. Furthermore, they were
paradoxical. On the one hand, they alleviated Bill's anxiety by making him
believe he was undertaking the tasks about which he was anxious. On the
other hand, they heighten his anxiety when he woke to find he had failed to 
accomplish the tasks. In short, Bill
was in a vicious cycle where the anxiety increased on each failure, leading
to deeper dreaming to alleviate the problem, and so on. Bill did not follow
all of this and asked,
<P>
<P>"Wouldn't it be simpler if I just got up and went to work on time?"
<P>
<P>The doctor was aware that Bill was a perfect subject for study. He knew
from his questions that Bill was unemployed, lived alone, and had few
prospects for work unless something was done about his dreaming. While it
was true that Bill was unlikely to have a high intellect, he was,
nevertheless, within the normal curve for the observations the doctor wanted
to make. The doctor proposed that Bill move into his clinic for a few weeks.
Drawing on his foundation funding, the doctor was sure that he could give
Bill a per diem to cover all of his expenses including rent. The doctor
thought he could do this without compromising the reliability of his
research. Bill agreed to move into the sleep lab for a few weeks. What have
I got to lose? Bill thought.
<P>
<P>It took Bill three false starts in the world of his dreams before he
managed to arrange for a neighbor to take in his mail. He now knew that he
was asleep if his reflection's eyes were closed. This did not help much.
Even when he knew he was asleep, he was unable to wake himself. He tried to
prick himself with a pin. He turned the radio in his dream studio-apartment
to maximum volume. He had no choice but to wait until he woke naturally. He
found himself thumbing through a magazine, sorting his laundry, or looking
out of the window at people walking their dogs in the park.
<P>
<P>When he finally made it to the sleep lab, he decided this could not go on.
He was happy to lie on the comfortable examination couch. The room was warm
and he felt perfectly comfortable in the thin cellular blanket and cotton
examination gown. The doctor placed a plastic helmet on Bill's head with
wires running across the room to a variety of machines. The doctor fiddled
with knobs and dials. One machine pumped out a thin stream of paper with
wavy lines traced along it. Bill fell asleep.
<P>
<P>Bill never woke again. The doctor recorded active alpha waves and evidence
of REM sleep. The doctor made a series of observations of breathing and
heart rate but was unable to wake Bill. In time, Bill was fed a liquid diet
and nursed like a comma patient. The doctor tried everything he knew. He
published articles on Bill in popular and serious journals. For a while the
doctor and his patient became quite famous. There was even a short piece in
the color section of the New York Times. Years went by and Bill was
forgotten by the public. The doctor remembered though. He refused to take
positions offered to him in other institutions. He felt he was somehow to
blame for what happened to Bill. Whenever he could, he would go in to see
Bill in a side room of Cornell's wing for experimental patients.
<P>
<P>As for Bill, he dreamed that he woke from a long satisfied sleep. The
doctor said all Bill needed was a good long rest. Everything would be all
right now. He went back to his studio and collected his mail which did not
include a single bill. Next morning he woke bright and fresh and decided to
visit the lumber yard. He missed the smell of saw-dust and working was
important. The boss said that he would take him on again because he had a
big order and Bill was a good worker. Bill was never late again.
<P>
<P>Early one Sunday morning, Bill met a woman about his age walking her dog on
the big lawn in Prospect Park. Bill plucked up courage and asked if she
would like to join him for coffee at Cousin John's on Seventh Avenue. She
agreed. A romance blossomed. A few months later she and the dog moved into
his studio overlooking the very park where they met. It was a little cramped
but they did not grumble. Things had turned out well. He was not given to
much introspection, but he would sometimes pause and look at himself in the
mirror as he was leaving to go to work. He would wonder for a moment what
would it be like if his reflection's eyes were open. He closed the door
softly so as not to disturb his companion. <BR>
