<h3>ALCHEMY<br></h3>
<br>
<br>
Christian P. Knoeller<br>
<br>
the trouble with money <br>
like lust is<br>
what we do for it<br>
<br>
trading apples<br>
for copper, futures for<br>
notes, an abstract chain<br>
<br>
reaction beginning with the hunger<br>
of hydrogen consuming itself<br>
in the heart of stars<br>
<br>
forging the heavy<br>
elements of our bodies <br>
on the anvil of time<br>
<br>
or peasants burning<br>
the furniture of czars<br>
to survive one more winter<br>
<br>
on earth: maybe<br>
the alchemists had it right:<br>
desire itself is precious<br>
<br>
