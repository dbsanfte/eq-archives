<h3>Hands Would Be Quiet<br></h3>
<br>
Raven Victoria Erebus<br>
<br>
<br>
Her hands would be quiet <br>
bound together like<br>
two clinging naked animals<br>
<br>
they looked more peaceful in gloves<br>
as if the cloth offered protection from eyes<br>
that might discern their secret<br>
<br>
on rare nights they could not restrain<br>
and danced about most elegant<br>
like swans as they lift into flight and circle<br>
<br>
but they have fallen silent for months<br>
sickness glistens sweat disgraces them<br>
paler now than ever any quiet spell before<br>
<br>
one night they wore the look of wax<br>
completely still awaiting nothing <br>
animals know not the hope of resurrection<br>
