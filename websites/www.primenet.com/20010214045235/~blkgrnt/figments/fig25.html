An Eternal Question<br>

		I've always had this notion about the way that things would be. <br>
		I've always felt a bond that was special between you and me. <br>
		You opened up my soul and haved dared to walk inside;<br>
		but is this a place where you learn to look...<br>
		or a place for you to hide?<br>
		Emotions cease and all feeling quits.<br>
		I feel like a speckle of earth<br>
		that moves none too fast or none too slow. <br>
		As the life of love transcends to the sky, is it me you love-<br>
		or <br>
		will our love just die.<br>
