<h2>THE DIFFERENT FACES OF ABUSE<br></h2>
<br>
<br>
Sheryl L. Nelms <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Abuse</b><br>
<br>

is to wake <br>
up at 1:30 to <br>
your drunk <br>
husband<br>
<br>
grabbing your <br>
head in his <br>
hands<br>
<br>
to feel your head <br>
knocking the<br>
plastered<br>
wall<br>
<br>
just because<br>
<br>
that is<br>
abuse<br>

<b>Alcoholic Marriage</b>
<br>
<br>
I said, "I do" <br>
to midnights<br>
<br>
full of worry<br>
about your drunk driving<br>
<br>
to morning<br>
bus rides back to <br>
work without<br>
a wrinkle<br>
In your<br>
sheets<br>
<br>
vomit<br>
lumped beside <br>
the kitchen <br>
trash can<br>
<br>
Like some gag shop <br>
Sunday surprise<br>
<br>
to black feelings <br>
stirred deep into <br>
breakfast coffee<br>
<br>
sipped alone<br>
at the Old South <br>
Pancake House<br>
<br>
while your shadow <br>
sleeps off Saturday <br>
on the divan<br>
at home<br>
<br>

<br>
<b>Sack Man
<br></b>
<br>
he slumps<br>
against the brick wall<br>
<br>
like a rumpled <br>
Goodwill pile<br>
<br>
clutching tight to <br>
his brown bag<br>
<br>
of liberation<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Ode to a Bag Lady
<br></b>
<br>
Think of me <br>
whenever you<br>
<br>
empty a can <br>
of Diet Coke<br>
<br>
read Newsweek<br>
<br>
or wipe with toilet paper<br>
<br>
think of me<br>
pawing the dank depths <br>
of Safeway’s dumpster<br>
<br>
for wilted lettuce <br>
stale rolls<br>
and molded cheese<br>
<br>
I am the <br>
grey bundle<br>
<br>
trundling it all<br>
<br>
along Miracle Mile <br>
In a Kroger cart <br>
looking for a<br>
<br>
safe place <br>
to curl<br>
<br>
the night<br>
<br>
while you<br>
In your creamy satin <br>
negligee are<br>
home<br>
<br>
fluffing <br>
your<br>
<br>
down pillows<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Sanguis eius super nos et files nostros<br>
<br>
<br>
What lizard demon lurks <br>
clawing at your mind<br>
<br>
what voodoo chant <br>
flagellates your ear drums<br>
<br>
what black goat <br>
bleats into your brain<br>
<br>
why do you fetal curl <br>
against the world<br>
<br>
is there any censer I can swing <br>
to smoke the Lucifers out<br>
<br>
any ashes I can sprinkle <br>
<br>
water to wine<br>
<br>
Jesus Christos <br>
let me in<br>
<br>
between your winding sheets<br>
<br>
give me a chance <br>
to cuddle<br>
<br>
your soul<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Candle in the Wind</h3>
<br>
<br>
black<br>
back lit<br>
by the sprinkle of stars<br>
and glittered neon of St. Thomas <br>
holds six carnivaled<br>
cruise ships<br>
at bay<br>
<br>
boats full<br>
of wrinkled<br>
moneyed bodies<br>
and corsaged honeymooners <br>
swaying to the<br>
steel band<br>
calypsos<br>
<br>
while I sit above <br>
alone<br>
<br>
on the hotel terrace<br>
under the rustle of palm fronds <br>
sipping endless banana daiquiris <br>
deep into the dark<br>
trying to escape<br>
<br>
the paper <br>
cut of<br>
<br>
divorce<br>
<br>
