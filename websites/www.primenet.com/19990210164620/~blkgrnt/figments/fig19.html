MY DAUGHTERS<br>
<br>
Lyric Poem by: Griselda Steiner<br>
<br>
MY DAUGHTERS<br>
NAKED ANGELS<br>
LED TO SLAUGHTER<br>
<br>
MY SWEET GIRLS<br>
FLOWERING<br>
IN A CRUEL, CRUEL WORLD<br>
<br>
WHO HOLDS YOUR HANDS<br>
UNTIL YOU WEAR<br>
A WEDDING BAND<br>
<br>
IN THE DESERTS<br>
I SEE YOU TOIL<br>
<br>
IN THE JUNGLES<br>
YOUR SMALL HANDS BLEED<br>
<br>
IN THE MOUNTAINS<br>
BURDENS SHAPE YOUR BACK<br>
<br>
IN THE RIVERS<br>
YOUR FEET ARE SOILED<br>
<br>
MY DAUGHTERS<br>
NAKED ANGELS<br>
LED TO SLAUGHTER<br>
<br>
MY SWEET GIRLS<br>
FLOWERING<br>
IN A CRUEL,'CRUEL WORLD<br>
<br>
OH COME TO ME<br>
YOU STARVING SOULS<br>
I KISS YOUR FACE, YOUR EYES SO OLD<br>
<br>
WHILE YOUR BROTHER<br>
GROWS TO RULE<br>
YOUR POOR STRICT WORLD<br>
YOUR LIFE BEOUEATHS THE DUST<br>
<br>
THEY CUT THE PLEASURE<br>
FROM YOU LOINS<br>
THE CORD - YOU WON'T<br>
INHERIT THE WORLD<br>
<br>
WHEN YOU MARRY<br>
WILL YOU BE HIS<br>
ONLY WIFE, A LONELY WIFE<br>
<br>
YOUR CHILDREN<br>
WILL YOU HOLD THEM<br>
SAFE IN YOUR LOVING ARMS<br>
<br>
I WILL HOLD YOUR HANDS<br>
TEAR OFF THE WEDDING BAND<br>
<br>
I GIVE YOU MY VOICE<br>
<br>
THE WIND TO DRY YOUR TEARS<br>
WILL YOU FOLLOW<br>
<br>
BURNT OUT GODS IN THE RAIN<br>
<br>
OR MY LOVE ON A<br>
RAINBOW TO THE SUN<br>
<br>
