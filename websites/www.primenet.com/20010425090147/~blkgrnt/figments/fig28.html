<br>

					Silhouette under-skin wind <br>
					rash of flowers <br>
					gathered birds to go <br>
					magic and purple(soul) <br>
					the wake follows <br>
					the eye goes along <br>
					as in mere despite <br>
					the leaves strong enough <br>
					soften the fall <br>
					while grace rises and ask's your silhouette <br>
					to let go.<br>

<p>Biography:  Diego Ulibarri is a twenty-three year old Mexican
poet.  The poems above are his own translations.<p>
<br>
          <p>Well, here's my biography. I was born here in Mexico
City, June the 13th 1972, and I've studyed here all my life, I'm
currently studying 4th. year of Vet school at the UNAM, and
planning to go to the US as soon as I finish to get a Masters
degree (specialization) on surgery, but I also want to take
courses on Literature... I'm going to be a writer, but I have to
finish school first. I have a lot poetry written, an a lot of
ideas for books and screen plays (currently working on one
"overdose" or "sobredosis"in spanish), but as I told you here in
Mexico its difficult to eat from writing alone, you've got to
have something else besides this activity.  I live with my
parents an four brothers, pretty normal family... I like
traveling, in fact I recently spent four months in Meryland
(upper Marlboro), living on a horse farm, I've been all over
Mexico, and also to some places in the US, Canada and Spain. I
enjoy being alone. I like to do things the right way, with truth
and efficiency. I dont know what else to tell you..., I love the
water, the moon means a lot to me, yellow is my favorite color,
and somehow I have something with number 13...<p>
<br>
<p>Hope thats enough, or useful. As you requested I'm sending some
poetry in Spanish with it's translation (interpretation in
English), these are some that I like, but not necesarily the
best, you know that's hard to say. One more thing, my english is
good but not excellent, if you think something is not right, or
it would sound better in some other way feel free to change it.<p>
