<h2>POEMS FROM THE HEART: A COLLECTION</h2><br>

<b>THIRTY MILES WEST OF CHICAGO</b><br>
<br>
<br>
paint chips slowly<br>
it’s so still you<br>
can almost hear it<br>
pull from a porch<br>
<br>
owls and cats<br>
a man walks out<br>
into fields cold<br>
grass claws like<br>
<br>
finger in a <br>
wolf moon corn<br>
bristle he<br>
stands listening<br>
<br>
watches as if some <br>
thing could grow<br>
from putting a dead<br>
child in the ground<br>
<br>

<b>WITH HIM<br></b>
<br>
<br>

not life <br>
but an idea<br>
of life <br>
in a flash<br>
like a short<br>
short story<br>
don’t look<br>
for meaning<br>
or much to<br>
develop a <br>
flicker<br>
in darkness<br>
firefly in<br>
the curtain.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>HE SAYS LATELY IT’S NOT THE SAME, HARDLY WILD<br></b>
<br>
<br>
the chase isn’t the same,<br>
it’s like being married.<br>
The zebras are just<br>
trucked to you. What’s<br>
the fun without a chase,<br>
without hallenge and<br>
danger. How can it<br>
count if you don’t have<br>
to sweat and risk to<br>
devour what you’re<br>
starved for. Safaris<br>
aren’t these days,<br>
more like a glop of oat<br>
meal when you’re <br>
longing for steak, something<br>
full of blood you can<br>
sink your teeth in<br>
<br>

<b>SHE SAID IT WAS AT THE DROP IN CENTER FOR THE HOMELESS
<br></b>
<br>
<br>
The night before Christmas<br>
we planned a fabulous <br>
dinner, hundreds of <br>
gifts and arranged a<br>
talent show. One woman.<br>
Lillian, a non stop ranter,<br>
a mentally disturbed woman<br>
who tried even the most<br>
patient, with her rambling<br>
loud prattle, wanted to sing<br>
a little known aria but had<br>
not been picked. But she was<br>
there early and as the hall <br>
was being swept up later,<br>
the others gone with their<br>
gifts and extra sandwiches<br>
stuffed in their pockets<br>
ignored mostly except for <br>
warnings it was time to<br>
leave, the dishes almost<br>
washed, suddenly Lillian was<br>
at the piano playing Silent<br>
Night in the sweetest style<br>
<br>
No one could really believe<br>
this tho there were stories<br>
about her studyong at a famous<br>
music school. Lillian sang<br>
in flawless German. The scruffy,<br>
loony obstreperous old bag<br>
lady was transformed. Out of her<br>
brokenness, this almost<br>
unearthly music. Then she stopped,<br>
began her non stop rambling,<br>
walked out in the snow on<br>
the night some say<br>
the angels sing<br>
<br>
