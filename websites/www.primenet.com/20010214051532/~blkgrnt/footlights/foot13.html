	<body>She had a name, this one did.  Selsh.  A beautiful name I
think.  She came at a time in my life when I was drowning in a
pool of memories and everything else was covered in three layers
of black.</body><p>

        	<body>I remember how she intrigued me, almost immediately. 
It was at a friend's house.  Alcohol, bad music and lots of
greenish cigarette smoke.  Camels, I think.  Camels and pot, of
course.  She was there when I pulled in the driveway.  Hair
short and streaked with gold, eyes dark and begging to be stared
at.  She had a perfect tan, I remember.  But the first thing I
noticed was her hands.  There's not really any way to describe
them.  They were elegant and beautiful, yes.  But the way she
held them.  There was something almost musical about the way
they slipped through the night air.  I imagined those hands
creating a painting so breathtaking, that the only thing you
could do when you saw it was cry.  Cry because it pricks at the
very essence of you.  Beyond the heart, beyond the soul, it
pricks the part that lies just beyond your dreams.  I wanted to
ask her about the painting, to see her hands flicker to life as
she described it, instead I found myself standing in front of
her exchanging names.</body><p>

        	<body>We spent the night on the back porch talking, pausing
every now and then, as someone would rush out the screen door
and disappear out the driveway.  I don't remember what we talked
about, I only remember listening to her and wondering what went
on behind her eyes.  Yes, I was definitely mystified.  I think I
fell in love with her that night.  Or soon after.  Very soon
after.</body><p>

        	<body>The next weekend I invited her to go with me to some
dinky little town on the coast of Louisiana.  She said sure and
we got there around three.  I remember how all the houses were a
dull gray and the people even duller.  It was an odd setting I
thought.  Even so, when we arrived, we rented a fluorescent
orange bike and rode it to the edge of the ocean, laughing about
how funny the bike-man's accent was and the way he twitched his
little blond mustache.  That night on the beach, she opened up
to me.  Not in any way that can be explained.  It was just in
her eyes, or maybe it was in her voice.  Either way, I just knew
and that's how it began.</body><p>

    	<body>We were good together, I thought.  Real good.  Good in a
way that makes you feel like everything's all right.  Like a
cheesy lovesong on the radio good.  Not that we didn't have
problems, it's just that I was naive.  Yeah, naive and ignorant.
Selsh had a lot of background.  A couple layers of it actually
and I didn't even begin to realize it until about a three months
after Lousiana.</body><p>

    	<body>"Jeremy?"  She began, one night.  Something a little
strange in her voice, something like a butterfly in December.</body><p>
<br>
    	<body>"Yes?" I said.</body><p>
<br>
    	<body>"Have you ever wondered what makes people do things?"</body><p>	
<br>
	<body>"Like what?"</body><p>
<br>
    	<body>"Can't really say.  Just things ... bad mainly."</body><p>
<br>
    	<body>"Yeah."  I said, sinking into that place.  My past.  I knew
that question.  Yeah, I knew that one too well.</body><p>

    	<body>She didn't say another word the rest of the night.  Neither
did I.  Just the hum of the ceiling fan to listen to.  But it
made me wonder about my Selsh.  Probably scared me too.</body><p>

    	

	<body>Hot sand, blue waves and a man in yellow trunks.  "C'mere
little boy."  He says.  "I won't hurt you."  I remember them
both, the boy and the man.  We don't get along real well, the
three of us.</body><p>

    	<body>A couple of nights later, we went to a jazz bar.  They were
good.  Smooth, simple, seductive.  We sat, listening, talking
about nothing and smoking cigarette after cigarette.  They were
all cool cats there.  Then, the band stopped playing and we were
alone, my cigarette dripping and a glass of bourbon stuck in her
hand.</body><p>
<p>
    	<body>"Jeremy?"</body><p>
<br>
    	<body>"Yes?"  </body><p>  	    
<br>
	<body>"I'm alone."  She said.  "Did you know that ... I'm alone."</body><p>
        	<br>
	"<body>Yeah, Sel ... I know."  And I did.  I really did
	because I was alone too.</body><p>
<br>
    	<body>"I don't want to be alone anymore."  She whispered over the
brim of her bourbon.</body><p>
<br>
    	<body>"Spend some time with me."  I smiled.</body><p>
<br>
    	<body>We left the bar drunk, hand in hand and headed for my
apartment.  When we got there, I fumbled with the keys until I
realized I had left the door unlocked.  We staggered inside and
kissed on the couch.  I don't remember a whole lot about that
night, but I do remember the way she kissed me.  It was open,
and wet and "hold me, please" and I knew I loved her and I
thought maybe she loved me too.</body><p>

    	<body>When we woke up in the morning it was raining so she
decided to stay.  Around three, she went into the bathroom and
didn't come out.  I heard the familiar rattle of a bottle and I
knew why she went in there.  Didn't believe in it, but I
understood.  I understand a lot of things.  Death and suicide. 
Yep, I understand.</body><p>
<br>
    	<body>Knock. Knock.</body><p>
<br>
    	<body>"Sel ... you're not alone."  I said, not because I wanted
her to come out or because I wanted to comfort her but because
it was true.</body><p>

	<body>She didn't say anything and it was silent as we waited.  She
just sat in there, probably playing with those wonderful hands
of hers.  Then, she exploded out the door and wrapped herself
around me with her head on my shoulder and cried.  Cried because
she had too many memories and they wouldn't leave her alone. 
Because she was no longer alone.  Because sometimes crying just
feels so good.</body><p>

    	<body>And then she told me about her memories.  How her father
would stick knives in people because he wanted to see if they
would still bleed.  He threatened to do the same to her
everytime she did something wrong, she said.  But that wasn't
the worst, she said.  It was his eyes.  The way they glowed when
he ran his fingers through the blood, she said.</body><p>

    	<body>I understood her.  I've seen people killed before.  I know
how much they bleed.  It's everywhere.  The blood, I mean.  Red
smeared everywhere.  Like a huge fucking painting.  That kind of
shit sticks to your eyes at night when you try to close them and
dream about happy things.</body><p>

    	<body>I think there was more to Selsh than just Daddy, though.</body><p>

    	<body>Memories.  Do you know what memories can do?  The past. 
That's what did us in.  On those cold, damp nights when you're
alone in front of the tube and all that's on is that show about
the serial killer who likes to display his artwork on his
victims' breasts-- the only things you have are your memories. 
Suddenly, the lights go out and you've a million beetles
squirming under your skin, all trying to get out and you're back
in that place.  You can smell his breath.  All sour and
cigaretty.  Tell me, where are you going to run?  When you're
trapped in your own mind, there are no exit signs.  Yeah, Mister
Psychologist, fuck off, cause you haven't been there in the dark
all alone.  Selsh had a past, I guess you could say.  It
tormented her.  I have a past too, so I know where she was.</body><p>

    	<body>For about a year, Selsh and I were happy.  We created our
own little world to live in, devoid of pain or memories or
reality.  Mostly reality.  Almost like a cove with only our
footprints in the sand.  We'd go to jazz clubs and the
occasional restaurant, laughing at our sorrows all along.</body><p>

    	<body>Then, one day, a man, I don't even know his name, said
something to her.  I don't know what he said or even if what he
said mattered.  What mattered, she said, was that he was a man
and she wasn't and he had this look in his eyes.  It was like he
was sizing her up, she said.  Looking for all the seams and
wondering how soft her skin was.  "If he wasn't dead, I would've
sworn it was Daddy."  She said.  And the tide came in, flooding
away the secret cove, covering it in cold, brackish green water.</body><p>

    	<body>She became depressed, if that's the word for it.  She sure
as hell wasn't happy.  Kept telling me how long the nights were
becoming and that she wasn't sure what she wanted anymore.  But
the biggest difference was the way she held her hands.  They
weren't mystical or musical anymore.  Just limp ordinary hands
that held coffee in the morning and turned out the lights at
night.  Yeah, that was the biggest difference.  It was like she
had been an elf or faerie or something magical but the world
she'd come from had just suddenly collapsed within itself and
she no longer had a reason or place to be here.  Or maybe, she
just no longer wanted a place.</body><p>

    	<body>Deeper and deeper she sank, her apathy becoming a noose
around my neck that she kept squeezing tighter and tighter. 
Until one day when I grew tired of it, or possibly scared of it
and I broke loose.  Cut the ropes, burnt the ropes, threw them
in her face and disappeared.  It wasn't that easy though, to
break free from her.  I had to do something with the emotions I
still felt.  Had to cage them.  But it felt more like I caged
myself.  Cold iron bars and big rusty old lock with no key.  I
couldn't trust myself anymore either.  Fear.  That's what it was
that drove me.  Can't escape fear.  Can't even try because if
you do, you end up running someplace far worse.  You don't even
try to run when you get there.  It's like a huge cavern.  No
sun, no stars, no nothing, just the dark.  If you run, you might
slip in the undercurrents and falls.  Only when you fall in that
place, you don't get up.  So, you stay scared and that's where I
was when one sunny afternoon, she called.</body><p>

    	"<body>Hi, Jeremy."  She says, her voice dull and flat.  "I want
to see you."  No.  It's over babe.  We're though.  "Please,
Jeremy.  Just once."  My lungs are about to explode, throat's
tight and closing fast.  She still has the key.  Fine, I say. 
And we made a date.</body><p>

    	<body>I was supposed to meet her in the park, in the pines.  Her
favorite place.  She loved the way the green seemed to cover
everything.  "You can get lost in here."  She used to say.  "Not
really lost, but if you want to disappear."  She loved the smell
too.  "It's so naive."  She would tell me.  "Like it's the only
kid in the world."</body><p>

    	<body>A few nights later, I found myself slipping through the
park heading for the pines. She said she would be waiting for
me.  It was her favorite place, she'd said. "Wear a white
tee-shirt."  I wore the white thing, not that that was
important.  I knew what she really wanted.  Somewhere in the pit
of my stomach I knew.  The deepness of the ache, maybe.  I
walked on ignoring.  As I broke through the green shadows, I saw
her.</body><p>
<br>
    	<body>"Wear a white tee-shirt."  She'd said.</body><p>

    	<body>Her body hung above a pile of clothes, her smile plastered
in the sky and she was a memory.  I'm alone, now.  Sit in front
of the tube late at night and fight the images just as much as
she did.  Fight the hurt she left, too.  But I'm fighting and
hey, maybe if we'd of tried a little harder it might've worked.</body><p>

    	<body>There wasn't even a note, only a message on my machine when
I finally got back.</body><p>
<br>
    	"<body>I'm tired of being alone."  She'd said.</body><p>
<br>
    	<body>That was it.  She was tired of being alone. What's the
point.  I don't know, but maybe that was enough.  Maybe I'd
mistakened our relationship for something bigger than it really
was.  Maybe I was alone the entire time, we both were, only I
didn't want to believe it.  Maybe the theories of existential
solitude aren't really theories at all.  For her, it was never a
question of maybe.  For me....  I sit alone on rainy nights,
pondering what could've been and telling myself "Hey, we tried
but it just didn't work, babe."  </body><p>
