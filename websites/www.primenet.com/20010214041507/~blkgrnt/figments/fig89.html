<b>FANTASY<br></b>

<br>
I bought a lottery ticket.<br>
Now I owned a fantasy<br>
Which I clutched like<br>
A holy script.<br>
<br>
The numbers on the television<br>
Screen danced to feverish pitch;<br>
Anxiety climbed to mountain peak.<br>
<br>
I pored over the tablet as<br>
Moses had over the commandments.<br>
The chariots rumbled;<br>
	Sweat pearled my brow.<br>
The sea never parted.<br>
<br>
