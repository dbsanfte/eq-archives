Tony boy,<br>
pony boy,<br>
you big ‘ole hotdog<br>
muncher<br>
if I were big and bold <br>
and brave and burly<br>
I would punch her.<br>
You know you would, <br>
you Tony boy<br>
you eat that macaroni<br>
Funky man,<br>
funky you,<br>
you dancing masticiolli<br>
Super dude,<br>
super high,<br>
just a-fingernail bit’n<br>
growing roses in your tambourine<br>
living for the fight’n<br>
