    <p>Oral cultures possess remarkable qualities that effect many areas of cognition.
 An oral culture influences memory, perception, symbol formation, and the
 expression of thoughts through speech. The Navajo Indians are one example of
 this. There is a Navajo song that serves as a good introduction to some concepts in
 this paper, such as the role of motion in Navajo mentality:
                       Voice above,<br>
                      Voice of thunder<br>
                      Speak from the<br>
                      dark of clouds;<br>
                       Voice below,<br>
                     Grasshopper voice,<br>
                      Speak from the<br>
                      green of plants;<br>
                      So may the earth<br>
                       be beautiful.<br>

                                       (Witherspoon)<br>
     Navajo memory utilizes mnemonic devices in ways unique to oral cultures.

 Culture plays a large role in the way stimuli is perceived, processed, stored in
 memory, and eventually how stimuli manifests in language.
    Two main views on communication skills and their cultural variations can
be used to summarize the nature versus culture debate, which compares the
amount of influence either genetics or upbringing and environment have on
development, pertaining to how memory operates. The first view is that cultural
differences in cognition are composed of differences in the existence or amount of
some hypothetical, psychological capacity such as egocentrism. The second view is
that differences reside in the way particular processes are brought to bear on the
problem; how knowledge is transformed and utilized (Cole). Discrepancies in
thinking are due to different premises about the nature and operation of reality
(Witherspoon). The latter best describes how the Navajo use mnemonic aids and
symbol formation in a manner unique to their culture and language.
    A mnemonic device is a tool, such as a metaphor, rhyme, or formulated
pattern, that assists memory. There are three basic principles necessary for
mnemonic device to work. First, both the items and their cues must be visualized
in the mind's eye. The images must interact to form an integrated association.
More than one item may be associated with a cue if the items are elaborated into a
unitary image (Baddely). For example, a "sweat" may evoke multiple images, such
as the smell of cedar smoke, the sound of the whistling wind, the scorching heat in
the lungs. Finally, the semantic meaning of the encoding cues must be significantly
distinguishable to avoid misinterpretation and tangled associations (Baddely).

     Mnemonics can be categorized into reduction coding, where only pertinent
 information is processed, or elaboration coding, which incorporates as many cues as
 possible in order to maximize recollection potential (Baddeley). The Navajo use
 reduction coding mnemonics to extract the relevant meaning from a dream, story,
 vision, or experience to create a symbol.
    The Navajo culture tends to take a more reflective approach, rather than an
 analytical one, to perception. They observe and listen more than they demand to
 know why. Oral cultures tend to ask "who causes" rather than "what causes". This
 gives an idea of the different perceptual viewpoint. In this light, it can be seen that
 the Navajo may use activity-based knowledge, which is extracted largely from
 experience in a way that reflects lifestyle, more extensively than non-oral cultures.
 For example, sitting is considered by the Navajo as a productive activity, not an
 inactive state of being (Witherspoon). As life is actively experienced, so it is
 represented in memory. Procedural knowledge consists of a set of procedures or
 acts acquired for carrying out activities. A sentence will then be represented in
 memory in terms of a set of actions (Foss & Hakes). This active nature of processing
 memories is evidenced in the fact that experience embeds things in the memory
 (Myers). Attitudes that are formed through experience, whether active or vicarious,
 are more thoughtful, certain, stable, and resistant to decay or extinction. For
 example, the Hopi Indians practice a ritual where Kachina clowns enact ethical or
 non-ethical behavior and its consequences. Those who portray the clowns are able
 to activel;i perceive these events in memory; the audience experiences the ritual

 vicariously through the clowns. This type of memory storage is actively fortified
 through actual experiences. Furthermore, information is best remembered when
 actively explained in one's own terms (Myers).
     Through the adoption of particular concepts and orientations to reality,
 humans can actually create the worlds within which they live, think, speak, and act
 (Witherspoon). In this way, society constructs reality. Interpretations of this reality
 and the causation of events are all based on an unbreakable connection of mind and
 matter (Witherspoon).
   Thought has tremendous power. The mnemonic devices Navajo use make it
possible to propagate their oral culture. These tools are manifested in the basic
components of their history, world views, and ways of life. The incorporation of
these memory tools into daily life is so complete that it may go undetected to the
untrained eye. They are, in fact, so integral to Navajo culture that they are the
means to the end in that they continue the oral culture.
    Indians use a combination of sequential remembering and visual imagery as
a basis of mnemonic systems (Baddeley). Sequential remembering is utilized
because it provides a systematic, reliable retrieval strategy which includes all the
items or events that occurred. The Navajo may find this especially useful when
 creating intricate sandpaintings that require exact recollection of shape, color, and
 placement, doubled with the necessity to portray the correct spiritual being for the
 ritual. Baddeley ran an experiment to test for the significance of imagery and
 sequence in relation to memory. He asked his subjects to remember spoken
 sequences of sentences describing the locations of certain animals. Some subject
 were told to use visual imagery to locate them, while others were told to treat each
 sentence as a separate semantic unit. Subjects who used imagery recognized
 sentences that were not said if they were consistent with their visual array. This
 tendency was not found in the other subjects. Baddeley's findings indicate that
 subjects go beyond the literal semantic information given and tie in their own
 visual representations to form detailed schemas about the sentence sequences
 (Baddeley).
     Visual imagery contributes to mnemonic memory when it manifests in
 cultural rituals, art, architecture, stories, and cosmologies and, therefore, acts as a
 constant and concrete reminder of the ima ges. Perhaps visual imagery in oral
 cultures is most often used to remember visions and dreams in symbol formation.
    Visual imagery can also be applied in a more direct way. If a Navajo
 participates in a ritual or important historical event, he or she has a prime
 opportunity to capture, create, and expand that experience in images. (A picture says
 a thousand words.) As most Navajo experiences are also teaching tools, they are
 repeated often. Repetition and active participation combine to strengthen the
 particular image's memory trace. In this way, the high frequency of visual and

 semantic relationships occurring together becomes embedded in memory.
    Dreams and visions must be encoded semantically for meaning. Semantic
coding and visual imagery are cited s the two basic forms of elaboration coding that
dreams and visions must be semantically encoded for recall (Baddeley). Dy
extracting verbal meanings from their richly abstract cognitions, the Navajo are able
to use semantic coding as a device for remembering the importance and utility of
these dreams and visions. Conversely, the meaning is encoded and recalled
simultaneously with the actual images seen in the mind's eye; visual imagery and
semantic coding strengthen the associations between each other and thus reinforce
the memory of such cognitions.
    Motivation to remember is such a prominent factor in oral cultures that it
may be synonymous with a highly used mnemonic device. Bartlett's theory of
cultural influence on memory ,as interpreted by Cole, argues that the various
cultural characteristics make a difference in the way things are recalled. Cole holds
that certain 'memory feats' seen in 'primitive' (oral) cultures are a result of the
focus of interest (Cole). This can be seen to some extent in the different blanket
patterns the Navajo are known for. Weavers pride themselves in producing
blankets of great variability. Also, the meanings of the geometric patterns must be

remembered so that duplicates are not made. In this case, the high motivation to
produce original blankets is a result of the interest in blanket diversity.
    Motivated memory is an integral part of the continuation of oral societies.
Social motivational perspectives are considered as heuristic alternatives for
studying individual and developmental differences in memory. This is because
they encompass motivational variables such as beliefs, values, expectations, and
coping behavior (Perlmutter & Weinert). Intentional recall is directed to achieve
specific purposes embedded in the activities that serve larger functions than the
individual person (Perlmutter & Weinert). For the Navajo, intentional memory
serves many functions: education, cultural continuity, and the preservation of
tribalhistory. Stories heard in youth can portray volumes (of unwritten text) in
history, geography, nature study, and ethical behavior.
    Indians are strongly motivated to remember tribal traditions, stories, dreams,
and visions not just because they generally lack a written history, but because these
things constitute the backbone of their culture. They provide standards, outlines for
ethical behavior, and explanations of events. Propositional trees and schemas are
reinforced and expanded when continuously incorporated into daily lives. The
Navajo use motivated memory because it brings results.
   The widespread, ripple effects of memory do not stop here. Perception of new
stimuli is effected by existing memories. Representations of a sentence in the
listener's memory is affected by other knowledge already in the memory (Foss &
Hakes). ThPse new memories are incorporated with the old to create a schema.
This schema serves as a ready-made reference, an existent category, to give meaning
to the new information.
    Psycholinguist Benjamin Whorf suggests that linguistic patterns determine
what is perceived and how it is thought about (Whorf). He asserts that language
shapes ideas rather than merely expressing them. Gary Witherspoon interprets the
Navajo cosmology as their world having been created through language- as it was
spoken, so it was (Witherspoon). In the account he cites, First Boy and First Girl
sustained life on earth, with thought being male and speech being female. If this
holds true for Navajo, then in their era! culture, thought and speech can have a
very literal and powerful impact on core concepts and meanings.
   Witherspoon gives further significance to the power of thought by declaring
thought as the crystallization of knowledge. His reasoning is that thought precedes
speech and knowledge precedes thought. In this way, thought and speech combine
with knowledge to gain creative force. An example of the amount of vitality and
magnitude the Navajo attribute to thought is the alleged rule that thinking of good
or bad things makes them happen. A direct example of the power of the word is
shown in the following lines from the Navajo song in the introduction: "Voice

below, grasshopper voice, speak from the green of plants, so that the earth may be
beautiful." Reality can be seen as a manifestation of symbolic form.
   I argue that language in oral cultures is formed and based on rich cultural
symbols. Witherspoon suggests that symbols are the building blocks of mental
images. Clifford Geertz supports this theory and states that thinking,
conceptualizing, and comprehension consist of a matching of existing symbolic
models to whatever new, unfamiliar information is received. Geertz goes on to
state that metaphor and allegory extend language by broadening their semantic
range, thus enabling the language to express meanings that cannot be expressed
literally (Geertz). Claude Levi-Strauss also asserts that perceived images act as
concrete entities that resemble concepts in their powers of reference (Levi-Strauss).
Symbols thus inform the thinking patterns that are expressed through language.
    One such thinking pattern seen in Navajo language is the concept of
perpetual motion. It can be said that the essence of Navajo life and being is
movement, constant reformation and restoration of proper relationships. This is
evidenced by the estimated 300,000 conjugations of the verb "to go" (Witherspoon).
In fact, Witherspoon suggests that the Navajo language is dominated by verbs
which reflect their conception of the universe in constant motion. Naaghaii, a form
of one of these verbs of motion, illustrates well the concept of motion. It refers to
continually going about and returning, reflective of the cycle of life (Witherspoon).
    Anpther example of motion expressed in speech refers to the Navajo
perception of air as the movement of life. AS stated above, they believe life and
their world to be created through spoken thought. They hold that air is alive and
thus makes knowledge possible through the breath of life. Air connects all things.
Through speech-the expulsion and intake of air- it enables one to communicate and
harmonize with the surrounding environment (Witherspoon). These examples
show how motion and language are necessary to the Navajo way.
    Navajo language seems to be largely based on symbolism. It is, therefore,
useful to examine how symbols are formed, represented, and manifested in speech.
If reality is a mirror of language, then the interplay between experience and
perception results in a symbol with rich rhetorical force (Witherspoon). These
perceptions and interactions between thoughts and knowledge and symbolic in
nature; they represent something else by association. Language is one of the most
important aspects of symbolic action (Witherspoon).
    To understand how symbols inform and constitute a large part of Navajo
language, it is necessary to explore how symbols are formed. The first thing needed
in the process is either and image, experience, or thought- basically any type of
stimuli. This stimulus is broken down into a proposition or set of propositions,
which are an abstraction that specifies relations among concepts or schemas.
Symbols employ many propositions. The images created out of perception of reality

are then formed into a symbol that is associated with many and varied propositions
(Fcss & Hakes). Forms and patterns of procedures then become inherent qualities of
language as they are represented and symbolized.
   The actual formation of a symbol is a higher level cognition. A symbol is
formed when perceptual relationships are recognized and represented via
mediation. This usually takes shape in words, pictures, or geometric patterns but
can also occur in sensations and emotions. Symbols and images are building blocks
of each other; they utilize relations and comparisons of propositions (Whorf). This
representation of related propositions is an interpretation of one's perceptual
experiences. These, in turn, can express certain attitudes towards the world, i.e.
worldviews (Whorf). The culmination of all the steps needed to form a symbol
exhibits the complex and highly sophisticated cognitive skills oral cultures such as
the Navajo possess and use daily.
    There are some limitations in the analytical discussion of the role of symbols
in speech that need to be addressed. First of all, it is difficult to establish the
existence of cognitive structures in an individual through linguistic mechanisms
(Whorf). This is especially poignant when the person studying Navajo language
does not speak it. Secondly, because of the differences in grammar among
languages, people are led to different observations, evaluations, and perceptions.
No two languages are exactly alike- some things inevitably cannot be represented in
the same way. English and Navajo, for example, are so dissimilar that they force the
speaker into two completely different conceptions of reality (Hall). Albert White
Hat reinforced my hypothesis that in order to understand either of these languages,
one needs another heart and mind (White Hat). Finally, the approach that Navajo
speech takes towards interpersonal relationships constitutes a large portion of its
meaning and orientation. More distinctions are made in regard to the hierarchy of
pronouns, for example, which makes evident the differing linguistic approaches
(Glenn & Glenn).
    In conclusion, the formation of speech represents evidence of varied
character and the extensive capacity of Navajo memory, thought, symbol use and
formation, and speech. These are all interconnected to each other and connected to
the concept of their universe through associated propositions and schemas. In this
way, their belief of perpetual motion is constantly evidenced in the dynamic
capacities of all the above cognitive functions, as well as the continuation of their
living oral culture. Speech is a reinforcement of the power of thought. Both of
these cognitive institutions are dependent on the strength and clarity of the
memory trace and the encompassing merits of Navajo memory. A final remark
that aptly states the crux of and inspiration for this paper: if one cannot remember
something without writing it down, if it is an idea that is not understood well
enough to be used effectively, then it is not important.
