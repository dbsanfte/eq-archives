Dear Mr.  Kurkowski, <br>
<br>
Thank you for your invitation to submit a few poems to
256 Shades of Grey. It is a pleasure to do so.

The poems come from a collection "The Rivers which connect
us to the Past. Survivors" which will be published later this
year by Mayibuye Publishers in Cape Town.
<p>

<h3>The Poor Interred Corpses Of The Cape Flats<br></h3>
<br>
In the evenings, when the South Easter abates<br>
in the plastic sheets of the squatter huts<br>
on the Cape Flats the poor interred corpses<br>
sink deeper into wet sand of the vleis.<br>
<br>
Later at night there is a rain which falls noisily<br>
onto the corrugated iron and all the blood<br>
is washed away. The last drops fall cautiously<br>
like the promise of futures into the sand.<br>
<br>
When the wind is still and the rain<br>
is a mere memory of drops from Port Jackson leaves<br>
the darkness swims into the hearts of the sleepers<br>
and makes them restless with undefined fear.<br>

They hold their breath for minutes of silence<br>
and know that something new is about to happen,<br>
something good, something which was an absence<br>
in their lives for hundreds of years.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Lines In A Grave Yard<br></h2>
<br>
<br>
That was the bad old time<br>
when he  lived: the time<br>
when children died of <br>
incurable emptiness of the stomach<br>
and the country <br>
had an elegeant medical term for that.<br>
<br>
That was the bad old time,<br>
here represented in numbers which designate<br>
the year of birth and the year of death,<br>
now engraved on the gravestones<br>
which have survived into our time,<br>
and the stones begin to speak<br>
about that disease which made children die.<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>The Cape Weather And The Five Year Plan<br></h3>
<br>
<br>
Like old men, the clouds piss<br>
when they can no longer hold their water,<br>
and the last pied crow<br>
shakes its feathers in disgust<br>
in the grille of tangled branches.<br>
<br>
Leafless oaks hold their upturned roots<br>
into a gale of leaden laughter<br>
errupting from forgotten graves<br>
clearing the skys to an icy blue<br>
and yesterday's news is driven against the wire mesh<br>
of our sieve-like memory: which Marx did you mean?<br>
<br>
With chattering teeth the cracked skulls<br>
caught in the grating of the sewerage system<br>
repeat the slogans shouted with such confidence<br>
seven long years ago at their grave side.<br>
A solitary woman woven in the trellis of pain<br>
her wrists broken, but alive, not like a runner<br>
who has reached her goal, but not like a corpse either,<br>
simply breathing in this wonderful new disorder <br>
and creative chaos breeding under the sun<br>
which begins to melt the snow on the mountains.<br>
<br>
Images which speed across the spherical<br>
splintered mirror inside my skull<br>
in retrograde circles of dulled pain<br>
while we spend our time,<br>
skin, bones, meat on some brilliant white sand<br>
a short span of time in an eternity<br>
a life and two cv's on this warm winter's day<br>
the sun above and the darkness below.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Mayibuye Centre<br></h2>
<br>
<br>
Some men and some women<br>
stepped into the flash light <br>
once<br>
for one hundredth of a second<br>
and lived in darkness for the rest of their lives.<br>
<br>
Therefore we know<br>
how they looked<br>
those<br>
who lived in the shadows<br>
in one hundredth of a second<br>
of the two billion five hundred million seconds<br>
which made up their life.<br>
<br>
