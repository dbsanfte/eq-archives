<p><font size="4">Not really time for an update this time.... Nightwatch not really 
  existing as a guild anymore, but I am getting a lot of requests for the location, 
  or info of the Crusaders of the High Plains guild page.... So.... I'll put that 
  link here on the front news page.... (I think its buried in the Forum somewhere 
  too).</font></p>
<p><font size="4"><a href="http://www.kenned.com/chp/index.html">http://www.kenned.com/chp/index.html</a></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Pop by... read the forum, and sign up on the roster if you would 
  like to join up (about 90% of Nightwatch is now in CHP)</font></p>
<hr width="50%" size="5">
<p><font color="BLUE">Tuesday August 8, 2000</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Time for another update (yikes....been a while since the last 
  one). There is a plan a foot for a raid/event in Trakanon's Teeth shortly, and 
  a possible lower level raid (around the 20's in level) a little later. Cubie 
  is putting togethor the Trak raid, and it looks like Fremont might be putting 
  togethor the other one.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">NEW FORUM ALERT!</font></p>
<p><font size="4">There is a new forum for us now. It uses the EZ Boards for Eze 
  of use, and Eze of reading. Please don't use the old forum anymore. If there 
  was a thread there that you are interested in continuing, please clip out what 
  you need from the old forum, and then paste it into a new topic in the new forum. 
  The sooner we clear out of the old forum, the quicker I can evaporate the link 
  on the Navbar. Speaking of the Navbar, I have linked the new forum under the 
  heading New Forum, and changed the old forum to Old Forum (seemed to make sense 
  to me).</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Enjoy! (thanks Chillin)</font></p>
<hr width="50%" size="5">
<p><font color="BLUE">Wednesday June 28, 2000</font></p>
<p><font size="4">New little section up in the Hints/Tips/Trades reflecting a 
  request from Fremont as to posting in a more permanent fashion Chillin's guide 
  to powerleveling (or at least leveling). Settle in for a read of it if you want 
  some solid hints as to get your second, third, or even first character to around 
  lvl 30 or 40.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">The event in Paw went off pretty much without a hitch (only 
  two deaths if you don't count the pets... ; ), and fun was had by most there. 
  Too bad more people couldn't have shown, or stayed longer, but fun was still 
  had (except for the poor gnoll's, I think they were glad when we left).</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Rumor has it that Kuno is itching for another meeting, and Breene 
  mentioned having lots of time to work on the page a bit, so I'm going to throw 
  the site access info her way.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">I'm going on holidays soon (mid-July), so I won't be playing 
  during that time frame (about 2 weeks), and won't be updating either, so this 
  will probably work out good having Breene doing updates. Medula mentioned on 
  the forum that he is a wiz at graphics, so maybe we can get him whipping up 
  some new stuff to spiff up the site, and I believe that Cubie mentioned being 
  a wiz at HTML as well, so maybe Breene and Cubie can share duties or take certain 
  sections of the site to maintain. Myself, when I get back would like to keep 
  doing the news (sure I suck at doing massive updates, but not much newsworthy 
  happens..hehe).</font></p>
<p><font size="4">So... have some fun playing, and I'll see you in-game till mid-July, 
  then its off on holidays I go! (Fremont, Kaijiro, Kashmyr, and Ballard if you're 
  reading this, then be warned I might drop by your way towards the end of the 
  holiday... ; )</font></p>
<hr width="50%" size="5">
<p><font color="Blue">Friday June 2, 2000</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Well.... it seems like the last update was... umm... eons ago. 
  We're working on finding some people with some time to look after the site. 
  As soon as layout is completed, we can pass around some page access to let people 
  keep the Members section, and the News straightened out. Whether or not I'll 
  have time for it (Kyrus speaking here btw), I'm not sure... but I'll give it 
  a shot. Keep ideas rolling in, and of course some submissions of pictures. If 
  you are going to submit a portrait of yourself... I'd prefer a straight or cropped 
  BMP file (not to the address listed in the contact info either... contact me 
  first if you're looking to submit a BMP, and I'll give you my 'real' e-mail 
  address).</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Happy hunting in Norrath folks!</font></p>
<p><font size="4">PS. Don't forget to keep checking the <a href="http://wwwboard.net/bbs1/nightwatch/wwwboard.sht">Forum</a>. 
  Kuno is getting antzy for a meeting. &lt;wink&gt; </font></p>
<hr width="50%" size="5">
<p><font color="Blue">Friday March 24, 2000</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Time to do another update again... Things are moving by a little 
  slowish again... Kuno, Palerider, and Mordante have been hanging out on the 
  planes for a little while now. The rest of us get to hear about it a lot too... 
  ; )</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Mordante has updated the Members section (a work in progress) 
  to be more class specific, and so far it looks pretty good (although it seems 
  that just the Necromancer part has started... hmm.... ; )</font></p>
<p><font size="4">The expansion is coming soon... I hope everyone is ready for 
  it... and don't forget to bug any Verant employees you see about the Bard songs 
  that aren't implemented yet in the game (lvl 39, lvl 45, and lvl 49 songs to 
  be exact) and that we don't seem to have any new songs for the expansion. Gross 
  inadequacy I think (but hey... I'm a bard, so of course I think that way).</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Keep your sticks on the ice folks and keep the air filled with 
  the blood of the foul beasts of Norrath!</font></p>
<hr width="50%" size="5">
<p><font color="Blue">Saturday March 11, 2000</font></p>
<p><font size="4">A little bit of a stretch again there... Well, we've been underway 
  for a while now, still adding more and more players (although we seemed to have 
  leveled off a bit now). We have run a few guild 'events', the most recent being 
  an attempt to slay the vile Sir Lucan, head guard of Freeport. Kuno is getting 
  itchy for a Soulfire I think.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">If you are a Nightwatch member and can read this... don't forget 
  to keep checking the forum by using the link to the left... there are little 
  tidbits about info, and upcoming events there...</font></p>
<hr width="50%" size="5">
<p><font color="blue">Saturday February 5, 2000</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Long time no update again.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Lots of news lately... Kuno has rounded up a ton of new players 
  for Nightwatch (a lot of them being real life friends I think), and the numbers 
  are usually around 3-8 online at any time now. Its always easy to have a Nightwatch 
  to Nightwatch conversation now. Kudo's to Kuno.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">As far as happenings and such... we have had a few 'events' 
  so far. Runnyeye, and Southern Desert of Ro being two of them, and a few more 
  major type of events upcoming.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Wedding bells are in the air. Maaeve and Urian are getting wed 
  on the 7th of February (he says 7th, and weekend, which would lead me to believe 
  that he means 5th...but hey, thats Kuno) at 5pm EST. This event is happening 
  on the Stone bridge in North Karana where the guards hang out (the bridge is 
  the zone point between south and north Karana's). Following the occasion will 
  be an Unrest 'party' (shivers of trains already). Come one, come all (and bring 
  LOTS o' booze).</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Secondly there will be a wedding between Mordante and Slaarnia 
  on Valentine's Day (February 14th for those not in the know). This one will 
  take place in Lake Rathetear at the Fire Tower. This game event is kind of a 
  pre-cursor to a real life wedding, so lets help them get the first one off smoothly. 
  This time Kuno got the date right, but he forgot the time (if its not one thing 
  its another... hehe, sorry Kuno, can't help myself here). Again, if you can 
  bake, or brew.... bring all you can to the event.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">As far as other issues go... I've switched my primary character 
  to my bard Kyrus now, and am under strict orders from Kuno to get to level 50 
  ASAP. And I have been playing quite a bit lately, so I think I will try to continue 
  on the news front. If you have anything you want plopped up in the News section... 
  drop me an e-mail, or an ICQ message (look in the Contact section), and/or message 
  me in-game (barring that...drop a message or a line to Mordante).</font></p>
<p><font size="4">See you in there folks, and long live Nightwatch!!!</font></p>
<hr width="50%" size="5">
<p><font color="blue">Thursday January 6, 2000</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Welcome to the year 2000. No, its not the millenium, and no 
  its not the 21st century yet... That all comes about next year...so save your 
  REALLY good partying for that.</font></p><font size="4">
<p>Nightwatch had recently fallen on some hard times... A lot 
  of members had their guild tag dropped from service. Even our illustrious leader 
  (who might I add looks mighty spiffy in his Armor of Ro and other pieces....) 
  lost his tag, which also means that he lost leadership. Daegarmo is back now, 
  and corrected the problem with Kuno, and the process of rounding up the stray 
  members is proceeding well.</p>
<p>On another note about rounding up... Nightwatch is continuing 
  to grow like a weed (hmm...maybe a poor simile). There are more and more Nightwatchers 
  online when I log-in. Good to see Kuno is active in this front. Now all we need 
  is an event or two and we'll be on the map.</p>
<p>I'm trying to get Kuno a little more active in feeding me info 
  he wants posted on the page (I got his e-mail address up in the contact spot 
  at least... ), and I'll try to get all the new members up in the Members section 
  too (and finish overhauling it too).</p>
<p>Hope to see a lot of you in the new year around somewhere in 
  Norrath... Happy hunting!!!</p>
