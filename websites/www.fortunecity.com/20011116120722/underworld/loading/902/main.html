<FONT COLOR="#918787">The site I have created is supposed to be one that
will finally draw the magicians of Norrath into a single place. Created by
magicians, about magicians, for magicians. I know that the information I
have provided within is nothing compared to what the magician community as
a whole can gather, and thus that is why the news section is on the message
board. If you have news, you can post it and see the results instantly. You
can ask questions, hash out your thoughts about the magician spells, or even
post spoilers within their respective forums. The site's name is taken from
the book we use to research, so without further ado, I welcome you to The
Grimoire!</FONT>
