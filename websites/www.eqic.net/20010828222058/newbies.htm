<H1>EQIC &quot;Just For Newbies&quot;</H1>
<H3>PLEASE NOTE: THIS PAGE IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION, IT IS NOT A
COMPLETE SET OF INFORMATION</H3>
<H3>Are you a newbie to EverQuest? Are you roaming aimlessly through
town and don't know what to do first? Are you wondering how everyone
is talking to each other and can't figure out how to do it yourself?
Wondering what all that stuff in your backpack is for when you start
playing? Here's the page for you!</H3>
<H3>We've got lots of articles on starting the game, the game's
interface, creating your character, memorizing your starting spells,
using your spells, a list of the most common commands you'll need to
learn to survive in the game and lots more! There's nothing that
veteran players dislike more than whining newbies who haven't done
their research and homework about the game before they jumped in and
started to play. Being a respected, great player takes a lot of
dedication to learn everything you can about how the game works. And
there's plenty of resources out there for you. Learn the game BEFORE
you get started, be self-sufficient in-game and conduct yourself and
your character like a pro!</H3>

            Choose a server to play on. Basically there are 3
            considerations when choosing a server: 1. Do you want to
            PK (player kill)? If so, choose one of the PK servers,
            because there are very few PK'ers on the regular servers.
            2. Where are your friends playing? If you already have
            friends playing EQ, you need to choose the same server
            that they are using, otherwise you won't be able to play
            with them. 3. If neither of the first two considerations
            matter, then the final consideration is how many people
            are already on the server? The most crowded servers are
            the hardest to play on because there's only so many
            monsters to go around.&nbsp;</TD>
