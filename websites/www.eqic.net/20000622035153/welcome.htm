                  Another quick update... we reformatted the layout of the frame
                  at the top of the page to allow you more viewing space at the
                  bottom of the page. The advertisement has been relocated to
                  the lower frame, hopefully we won't have a problem with that.
                  Your continued clicks on our advertising banner should prevent
                  us from having to relocate it back into the upper frame again.</p>
                  <p>In addition, we've got some more content to tell you about.
                  We found a map for Cabilis (the starting city in Kunark) and
                  the Cabilis underground. Both maps can be found in the <a href="citymaps.htm">City
                  Maps</a> section of the site. We found a handy Kunark zone
                  link map and you can find that in the <a href="specialtymaps.htm">Specialty
                  Maps</a> section. We also found a map for the Timorous Deep
                  zone which can be found in the <a href="zonemaps.htm">Zone
                  Maps</a> section. We've got some new things in the <a href="hints.htm">Hints
                  and Tips</a> section as well as a guide to playing an Iksar
                  necromancer in the <a href="classes.htm">Classes</a> section.
                  We also updated the <a href="patches.htm">Patches</a> section
                  with the last couple of months patch messages.</p>
                  <p>That's pretty much it for now, and we'll be working on
                  updating the Quests section with the new Kunark quests for the
                  next update.</TD>

                  Well, we finally did it! We went out and bought internet
                  hosting for the eqic.net domain name that we've had for the
                  past 6 months. We're very excited about having a home of our
                  own with an easy-to-remember URL address! All of our old
                  address pages will redirect you to the new site, so if you
                  forget to resave your bookmarks, you'll still get here for
                  awhile. Be sure to bookmark the new site so we can eventually
                  take those old pages down.<p>Ok, in the update today, we had
                  many, many bad links that have either been corrected or
                  deleted. Both EQ Stratics and EQVault decided to revamp their
                  sites and change all their page addresses in the process,
                  which accounted for a good number of our bad links. We've also
                  added some new content to the site which we hope you'll like.
                  We've added two sites to both the <a href="armor.htm">Armor/Weapons/Items
                  page</a> and the <a href="bazaar.htm">Bazaar page</a> which
                  list the going prices for player sold items. We've updated the
                  In-Game Commands file to include pet commands. You can find
                  that on the <a href="hints.htm">Hints and Tips page</a>. We've
                  added a couple of sites which list the major location
                  coordinates of specific areas within the zones, very helpful
                  info which is found on the <a href="combat.htm">Combat page</a>.
                  In the <a href="files.htm">Downloadable Files</a> section,
                  we've got 3 different versions of a spreadsheet that lists
                  NPC's in the game as well as their levels, zones and
                  hitpoints, and we've also found an EQ Server Checker. As a preview to the coming expansion, we've found a <a href="spells.htm">list
                  of the beta spells</a> being used in RoK. We've rearranged the
                  Navigation Bar at the top, Contact Us is now located in the
                  Home section which allowed us to fill that space with a new
                  category called Community. Check out the <a href="community.htm">Community
                  page</a>, it has several new links to help you find EQ friends
                  in real life, roleplay on bulletin boards, and get a head's up
                  on who's good and who's bad in the game. We've updated some of
                  the <a href="zonemaps.htm">zone maps</a> that were linked to
                  sites that no longer exist and we've found some new <a href="tradeguides.htm">trade
                  skill links</a> for you to check out. There are also other
                  scattered updates and additions, just cruise through the pages
                  and look for the <img border="0" src="images/1472237.gif" width="23" height="17"> or <img border="0" src="images/updated2.gif" width="44" height="12">
