<center><b><font color="#000099"><font size=+3>The Requiem Guild's Guide
to Hate</font></font></b>
<br><b>By Ebola Sorrowbringer, Requiem of Tribunal</b></center>

<p><i><font size=-1>Note: This guide is based upon Zyvalla Kwikfinger's
(Arcanum of Bristlebane) Guide to Hate. I have revised the format and corrected
things which have changed, deleted info </font>which we <font size=-1>will
not be using and added my own observations and strategy. The previous guide
gave no zone strategy as to the pulling , special roles, unique mobs or
preparations so the zone strategy is all new. The house section is basically
untouched from the earlier guide. The monsters section has been revised,
reformatted and updated with extra information. The map was originally
done by Sertain T'kell (ArchOverseers of Bristlebane) and I have edited
it for our strategy. This may change when Hate is changed in December.
However, I suspect that the currently empty third and fourth levels will
be populated with tougher things and the lower level and level 2 will remain
the same except Inny and maybe Maestro will be moved. We will see. I will
update this document periodically.</font></i><i><font size=-2></font></i>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>The Monsters</font></font></b>
<br>There are 14 different mobs in Hate at this time, and each is different.
All mobs can drop high end gems. All mobs can summon a person who has attacked
them. Also mobs are on either a 12 hour or 30 minute timer (for North and
South patrols). The only exception is Innoruuk who spawns once every 7
days. All standard monsters are level 48-51. Currently , Maestro is level
53 and Innoruuk is level 55.

him near a wall will throw you up to the third level from which you can't
get down. He also will not aggro from attacking any particular creature
nor will he call all residents of the zone to him like Cazic Thule so there
is no need to kill the while zone before him.

spawn and is second toughest mob in Hate.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>Spawn Types</font></font></b>
<p><b>Zone-Patrol</b>
<br>The first you will see on porting up is the zone-patrol. Zone patrol
is about 4 roaming spawns just to make plane breaking more difficult. They
will spawn on the east wall right behind either house 5 or I and walk the
east wall S and up into the ceiling. Occasionally, one will stop next to
a house to buff the mobs inside and then cut at an angle due SW, which
could lead them into the port room itself, but they do not stay there long.
However, since they are zone patrol, they will usually be right beside
the port room, so porting up could be a problem. Zone patrol can be Cleric,
Spite, Ire, or Rat, and in that order of appearance. Repop on zone patrol
is the same as static spawns if killed, so about 12 hours. If they de-pop
themselves, which they do if they make it to the zone line, then the repop
is about 30 minutes or so, but since they walk right by the zone-in, if
you setup camp there, you will get them all. They have a less than normal
drop rate.
<p><b>Normal Roamers</b>
<br>There are 2 patrol routes in Hate, the North and South. The North route
is basically just as is drawn on the map, except that the mobs will make
a square just north of the Fountain (house 8) and then head back up the
path to the NW end of it. The South route follows the path drawb on the
updated map Be extremely careful with them when near house 2 as they could
easily aggro the stuff in house C. The door to C is beside A, so if that
happens, everything between C and the zone room will aggro. All the roamers
have low drop rates. There are 6 mobs that spawn for each patrol.
<p><b>SW Corner</b>
<br>The SW corner is the other favorite pull spot (other than the zone-in
room). There are 3 semi-static spawns there, and they are 2 clerics and
a kirakuai. They are on a 30 minute timer and have very low drop rates.
They are here for one reason only... because it was a great pull spot away
from most of the roamer path. By being a 30 minute spawn, it makes camping
here much more difficult.
<p><b>Static Spawns</b>
<br>The ones in the houses are static spawns, and even they come in two
flavors. Some of the houses are huge, so they have fixed spawn points and
roamers within the houses. Static Spawns have the highest drop rates and
are on about an 12 hour timer. Houses will be covered shortly.
<p><b>Unique Mobs</b> - This is Maestro and Inny. Maestro spawns in the
far NW corner of house D in front of the organ. Inny is in a room upstairs.
Maestro is on the same static timer, while Inny is on a 7 day spawn. Maestro
stays in one area. While Inny will wander the north area on the second
level.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>Houses</font></font></b>
<p><b>House 1 </b>is the zone-in house. In fact, you will zone in almost
exactly where the 1 is drawn on the map. There are no spawns in this room,
but the zone-patrol will walk right by the E wall (just outside the house).
Unless you are in the pull group, or primary assist or told otherwise,
STAY AWAY FROM THE DOOR. The pull team cannot get into and out of the room
if everyone is crowded in the doorway. And a fight there could aggro the
other mobs the puller has. Also, stay away from the N wall for a little
while, as it could aggro some of the surrounding areas or the mobs pulled
to pull spot. The entrance is on the NW wall facing N (just under the rectangle
on the map on the left side of the room... that rectangle is only a hall).
Also stay away from the walls as until house C is cleared touching them
can result in House C aggroing which will result in a wipeout.
<p><b>House 2</b> has three spawns upstairs. One is always a box. The other
two can be abhorrents or ires. These do not aggro easily since all have
short aggro ranges, so pulling past them is usually okay. The usually do
not aggro on break-in, either. The only way the fights or pulls can aggro
them is one of the mobs with a large aggro range, then it will trigger
them as well. It is best to pull this room early. The entrance is on the
N side.
<p><b>House 3</b> will always be pulled with the zone-patrol aggro. The
mobs from zone patrol will aggro them, so at break-in, there will be no
less than one from zone-patrol and the two from this house. The two in
this house are usually an abhorrent and an ire. Entrance is on the W side.
<p><b>House 4</b> has a box upstairs. Do not pull this house until at least
the first half of house C is clear as it will aggro through the wall. Entrance
is on the NE side facing E (inside the L).
<p><b>House 5 </b>has an abhorrent downstairs and an ire or abhorrent upstairs.
Upstairs will not aggro from a downstairs pull, but it will if you pull
from beyond house 5. If you do not pull upstairs here, it will autopull
when you pull past it anyway. Entrance is on the SW side facing W (looking
at the door to house 4).
<p><b>House 6</b> has a box and ire upstairs. These will not aggro from
pulls around them at all and are usually the only mobs left in the zone
after a full clearing. They can be pulled or just left. Pulls from here
could aggro the neighboring rev houses, so it is best to leave for a while.
Entrance is on the W side.
<p><b>House 7</b> has a spawn right by the door and two more in the back
of the house on the SE side. All three spots can be abhorrents or ires.
Careful here as the S roamers like to stop just outside the door to this
house, and the N roamers could stop just to the N of it. Entrance is on
the far SW side closest to house C facing SW.
<p><b>House 8</b> is not a house, but a fountain or well. It is only a
landmark.
<p><b>House 9</b> is the ramp up to Innoruuk's chamber. Ramp starts on
E side. At the top of the ramp, there are two drakes. They can be pulled
without aggroing anything else. Once at the top of the ramp, there are
only four doors you can go into. The one on the S side, closest to the
ramp is a small house. There is a monk, scorn, abhorrent, or spite upstairs
in there.
<p>There are two entries on the east side of the courtyard up there, the
S one goes nowhere, the N one has a small house with 2 spawns, usually
cleric, rev, monk, or scorn. Careful with this one as it could aggro Innoruuk
through the wall (wall is close to the west T at the end of his hall).
<p>The entrance to the N of the area at the top of the ramp is Innoruuk's
Hall. The hall goes N, turns right and heads east, then turns south and
goes to a T that turns east and west, both of which dead end. There are
two static spawns guarding the door. They can be anything but drakes (though
not seen a rat there either). Within the hall, everything else, including
Innoruuk himself, will roam. Some will roam all the way to the entrance,
but only as deep as about half of the east hall going S. Others, including
Innoruuk, will roam only to the far NW corner of the Hall, but will go
all the way back to the T, and roam between the two ends of the T. The
roamers can be anything but drakes and rats. There are also 2 deep roamers
back at the T, and they are always drakes.
<p>Be very careful pulling the Hall. Inny will see sneaking.&nbsp; And
he will Death Touch. Every mob in the Hall except the 2 drakes in the back
can be pulled without aggroing Inny. You just have to watch for him and
get out of his way.
<p><b>House A</b> has a box and monk downstairs, and 2 abhorrents upstairs.
The monk will come as soon as you make a pull from anywhere near it, including
the chamber. The abhorrents are safe until you start pulling larger mobs
past it. The box may aggro on pulls, but has so short an aggro range it
will usually stay there. The entrance is on the SW side facing W. You can
see the box in the entrance.
<p><b>House B</b> has an abhorrent and monk upstairs and the same downstairs.
The downstairs monk will always aggro from any pull nearby, especially
the house C pulls. The upstairs and the abhorrent downstairs are usually
left for later (especially since there have been so many abhorrents so
far). Entrance is on the W side.
<p><b>House C</b> is generally called the Chamber or the Cleric House.
This is the first goal to be cleared (to prevent wall aggros). The entry
is noted on the map (right beside house A). guarding the entrance just
inside are two clerics. In the northern hallway (from the entrance to the
NE corner), there is a single roamer, but he can be anything on the spawn
table. Usually, it is a spite, rev (male or female), lich, monk, or ire,
but I have even seen a drake there. Just be careful and look before charging
into the room. Mostly, though, it is a spite or rev. In the far SE corner
of the house is a throne, and there is a cleric on either side of it. The
central hall of house C (between houses B and V) has 2 spawns, and both
are roamers. One spawns on the far west end of the hall and roams to the
east end. The other spawns on the far east end of the central hall and
will roam all the way to the far east wall of the house (close to house
2). These two can also be any mob on the spawn table, but mostly rev, spite,
ire, or lich on the east one, and rev, lich, ire, spite, or drake on the
west one. Be careful as the drakes have a huge aggro range. A drake pull
here could aggro a drake upstairs, and that would be very bad. No real
way to avoid it, but be careful. The west side of the central hall has
2 clerics guarding the passage (just inside the west side). There are also
2 roamers in the west end of the house just below the stairs, and the roam
from the stairs to the central hall and back. They can be anything on the
table, but I mostly see lich, drake, or spite. Usually, if one roamer is
in the corner near the stairs, you can safely pull the other (once the
2 clerics are gone, that is). In the far SW corner of the house, there
is another roamer that stays in that corner. Usually a lich or rat there,
but have seen others also. It is usually safe to pull from the west end
and not get this guy, but he does need to be killed. There is also a back
entrance to the Chamber, noted on the map on the W wall just above the
SW corner. This is the door to pull through when you camp SW corner.
<p>House C upstairs has the same floor plan as downstairs. All spots upstairs
can be anything on the table. There are two roamers at the top of the stairs
(NW corner), one in SW corner, two in the central hall, and four in the
East hall. NW stays in NW corner, SW in SW, and the central hall stay there.
The ones in the east end will roam from just above the entrance downstairs
(near house A) all the way to the SE corner. NW is usually revs, SW a lich,
central a monk or ire, and east is usually drake, spite, lich, and rat.
But again, anything can be in any spot. It could be all drakes. Of course,
that would be very unlucky for most, nice for any sks, but still. In most
cases, the upstairs will not aggro from downstairs. However, if there is
a drake upstairs and down, they could overlap ranges and cause a chain
aggro. Usually, however, upstairs Chamber is left for later pulls.
<p><b>House D</b> is the Chapel. There are also a lot of mobs in here,
and almost all of them are roamers. Once the Chamber is clear, you should
work on the Chapel so you can move camp. The SW corner of the Chapel is
generally called the Throne, and it is the next camp site (after Maestro
is killed). This is because it avoids most of the S patrol route, and there
is a much much better pathing from the rev houses (NE corner) to the Chapel
than to the zone-in room. That path does cross the N roamer route, but
there are less roamers on the N route than S. Chapel entry is guarded by
two clerics. There are also two clerics in the far SW corner beside the
throne. The only other static spawns in the Chapel are Maestro and his
guards.
<p>The Chapel roamers all have specific roam and pull paths. There is one
in the SW (usually monk) corner that stays in that area, one in the corner
on the S wall closest to the entry (usually rev), one in the NE corner
(usually scorn), and one in the corner of the stairs (NE of the entry)
(usually rev). There is another one just S of Maestro (just N of house
P) that roams from that corner up to Maestro and back (usually abhorrent).
Pull him when on the S end of his route. And in addition to these area
roamers, there are about six or eight house roamers that will roam from
near the throne area up to near Maestro over to near the stairs. All roamers
can be monk, abhorrent, both revs, ire, lich, rat, scorn, or spite. There
are specific paths for each, but that is too much to put in this already
long tutorial.
<p>The Chapel also has an upstairs, like the Chamber, but it is not a full
floor plan. There is a balcony overlooking the organ, so the 2nd floor
is cut off from the top of the stairs angled a little S over to above the
corner N of house P. At the top of the stairs, there is one roamer, usually
a rev or scorn. In the SW corner is one, usually cleric or spite. There
is also one in the SE corner, usually rev or lich. All three of these can
be anything but drakes.
<p>Maestro floats just in front of his organ in the far NW corner of the
house. He will have 4 personal guards, 2 on each side of him. In most cases,
he will be facing NW, but will turn to face his guards when they buff him.
It is safe to scout up behind him, but if facing you, he will aggro. His
guards are always spites or clerics, and can be any mix from all of one,
to a mix, or to all of the other. The entire Chapel, upstairs and down,
plus some of the surrounding houses must be pulled before he is or he will
aggro everything in his path.
<p>Once this is done and maestro is killed (see Maestro strategy), the
raid usually moves camp to the Throne area of the Chapel or the center
of the Chapel room noted on the map. The scout will scout the path, and
the puller or someone else will lead everyone there. If attacked along
the way, do NOT stop and fight. Keep running and take the mob to the Throne.
If you fight in the hall, more roamers could spawn on you or you could
aggro something not yet pulled. Once camp is reset, the puller and scout
can get back to work and pull everything else in the zone.
<p><b>House E</b> has a male rev just inside the door and another all the
way through near the bottom of the stairs. There is a female rev at the
top of the stairs on the second floor. Entrance is on the N wall just above
the E on the map. House F has a rev outside just to the east of the entry
and 2 more inside at the bottom of the stairs. These are usually males,
but could be either. Entrance is on the N wall.
<p><b>House G</b> has three revs in the far S corner, and they are usually
female. Entrance is on the far N wall.
<p><b>House H</b> has one male rev downstairs. Entrance is on the SW corner
facing west.
<p><b>House I</b> has a box in the NE corner and a rev in the nw corner.
There is also a rev upstairs. These can be either rev. Entrance is in the
central N wall facing N (middle of the U).
<p><b>House J</b> has one rev downstairs and two more upstairs, and they
can be male or female. Entrance is on the W side.
<p><b>House K</b> has one male rev in the SW corner downstairs and another
upstairs. Entrance is on the NW corner facing west.
<p><b>House L</b> has a female rev downstairs and two more upstairs. Entrance
is on the NE corner facing east (looking into house K).
<p><b>House M</b> has box in the far NW corner. Entrance is on SW corner
facing west.
<p><b>House N</b> has two revs in the back (far southern tip of the house).
Entrance is on NW wall.
<p><b>House O</b> has a scorn or monk. Entrance is on W wall.
<p><b>House P</b> has a monk and scorn downstairs, and a scorn or monk
with a box upstairs. This house is usually cleared before completing the
Chapel. Entrance is on E wall.
<p><b>House Q</b> has two monks or scorns downstairs and two upstairs.
Entrance is on W wall.
<p><b>House R</b> has a monk or scorn downstairs and another upstairs.
Entrance is on far SE wall.
<p><b>House S</b> has a box in the NW corner and a scorn or monk in NE
corner. There is nothing upstairs. But there are the corner spawns outside
(monk and 2 clerics in SW zone corner). Entrance is in the center of the
U.
<p><b>House T</b> has nothing.
<p><b>House U</b> has a monk or scorn. Entrance is on NE wall facing east.
<p><b>House V</b> has a monk or scorn upstairs. Entrance is on NW wall
facing west.

<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>Zone Strategy</font></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>General Things to Know</font></b>
<p>On break in no DoTs are to be used. This is because once the fight starts
more mobs will be joining in has they roam close to House 1 or are aggroed
from other houses. It is often necessary to switch targets because a spite
or tougher mobs shows up and a DoTed mob can't be mezzed.
<p>Always use assist. And if necessary reassist during the fight to make
sure you are on the right target. If you start beating on a mezzed target,
the enchanters will start yelling and you will make us have to fight more
then one mob at a time. This can result in people dying when they should
not. Have 2 assist keys hot keyed, one for the primary assist and one for
the secondary assist in case the primary assist dies or is gone for some
reason (LD or afk). Always wait until the primary assist engages the mob
before hitting the assist key. This is to make sure you are on the right
target. If reassist is called by an enchanter reassist.
<p>If using dots after the break in do not DoT until all mobs have been
mezzed and one mob is being engaged. This is to ensure that multiple mobs
do not get DoTed and are therefore unable to be mezzed. If you use a Darkness
DoT please shout DARKED so the designated Snarer knows why their snare
broke.
<p>Pets are only to be used if the raid leader says it is ok. If your pet
starts causing problems you will be asked to kill it. Do not start bitching
if you are told you can not use your pet. If you can show that you can
control your pet well under the dangerous conditions in Hate you may or
may not be allowed to use your pet more often. If you can't control your
pet most likley you will not be allowed to use them. Pets are not to attack
until all mobs are mezzed and only one target is being engaged.
<p>Only the pullers and scout have SoW and are in run mode. Everyone else
is in walk with no speed. If you use wolf-form, make sure you are in walk
mode at least. If you get feared, you could end up on the other side of
the zone. In walk you will not go nearly has far. If you get lost out there
from fear, don't worry. The scout can find you and take you back. If you
are killed, no matter where you are killed, the scout can find you and
take you back for a res. If under Maestro or Inny, it might take a few
minutes, but she will get you back for a res. Don't worry, no one gets
left in Hate. If you end out far away from the camp site DO NOT RUN right
back. If you aggroed something while feared you could train the raid. If
you are being attacked get a location (/loc) and die there rather then
trian the raid and cause a mass wipeout.
<p>The raid leader will assign the groups and assign special duties to
people. He or she will appoint the pullers, scout, slower, magic resistance
dropper, primary assist, etc.
<p>Pull order on all of the houses is up to the pull team and leader of
the raid. Please DO NOT ask that some mob get pulled. The pull team they
will try their best to keep a very balanced set of pulls in order to keep
everyone happy.
<p>If a mob gets on you please DO NOT run around the room. This just makes
the mob chase you around and makes it harder for the tanks to taunt it
off. Running away will not save your life in Hate and will more than likely
get you killed more easily. With so many people beating on a mob most likley
someone will taunt or nuke it off before you fall.
<p>Shout is reserved for the pulling group and raid leader to shout things
that everyone needs to know like incoming mobs, camp, or directions. People
who are assigned special roles such as slower may also use shout for a
specific purpose. Do not use shout for other purposes or shout suggestions
over it. Please use /ooc or guildsay for conversation outside the group.
<p>Either the main enchanter, raid leader or the scout will call a general
camp or a cleric camp. Noone else. If they are both dead, it is usually
not a good sign anyway. If camp is called, you MUST protect the clerics
and help them get out first. If you camp while a cleric is being beaten,
you will probably be run out of the raid. Clerics can res anyone back up.
If all the clerics are dead, it means porting new clerics up to res.
<p>Clerics and Enchanters are the two main classes to be protected. None
of the mobs in Hate are very hard. In fact, most are rather easy. But only
in small numbers or in controllable situations. A lot of mobs with no healing
or crowd control, and everyone dies. It's not so much that the deaths hurt
since everyone there should be getting a lvl 49 or higher res anyway, but
it does break the rhythm of the hunt and add some serious downtime.
<p>Always bring some magic resist (MR) gear. For Inny and Maestro MR is
necessary and if you are pulling or scouting for that too. High MR can
make the difference for Inny and Maestro just has it can for the dragons.
Maestro can almost always be killed each raid and it is definitely needed
for him. For the rest of the raid wearing your usual stuff is fine if you
are not a puller or scout.
<p>When moving between pull spots the scout and pullers will check ahead
and when it is clear the will give directions to everyone and lead you
to the next camp site. If you get attacked do not stop just keep going
to the next camp site and the mob will be killed there. It is most likely
just a roamer that has popped since the houses surrounding the path and
new camp site should already be cleared.
<p>In house 1 stay away from the walls. Touching them may aggro a mob in
a nearby house and bring a bunch of mobs running. When this happens the
result is usually a wipeout. It is a good idea to avoid walls everywhere,
but in House 1 it is very improtant early in the raid.
<p>Try to let everyone know at least 30 minutes in advance if you are gonna
leave. If a wizard or druid is not also leaving it means a wizard has to
port you down then come back up and be led by the scout back to the pull
site if it is not House 1. This can be dangerous if roamers have popped.
We want to avoid this situation as much as possible. Also by saying you
need to go in advance we can arrange for fresh blood to be in Greater Fay
so we can port them up to take your place if a porter has to go down.
<p>Expect to die. Hopefully nobody will, but it is very likely you will
die at least once, if not multiple times, so be prepared for it. The objective
is to have a fun and adventuresome trip. Just remember that, and everything
else will fall into place.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Special Roles</font></font></b>
<br>On any Hate raid certain roles will be assigned by the raid leader.
They are:
<p><b>Raid leader: </b>This is the person(s) responsible for getting things
organized, assigning roles and running the raid. The raid leader has final
say in all matters pertaining to the raid.
<p><b>Puller(s): </b>This person(s) will be responsible pulling mobs to
the party. They will work with the scout to make sure that whenever possible
pulls will be fast and easy to handle though this is not always possible.
If you are a puller you may need to sacrifice yourself to save the whole
raid. If you know a pull is too big to handle and can't FD successfully
you are to stay put and die. DO NOT TRAIN the raid party. The Scout will
get you and you will get ressed soon enough. Trains will occur sometimes
due to unexpected aggro, but don't train the party if you know there are
too many mobs. The pullers need to have very high magic resistance to avoid
being feared or rooted so they need to get MR to 100+ unbuffed and always
make sure that they have a MR buff when pulling so MR is 150+ buffed.
<p>Also the primary puller should always stay FD after the chain pullers
or primary assist brings the mob(s) to the group. Do not come help fight
even if there is a wipe out. This is to mainly ensure if there is some
unknown aggro you don’t bring them when you try to help fight. In the end
one person will not make or break the fight most likely. Your eyes will
be valuable in determining when the clerics can camp back in or people
can teleport up.&nbsp; Pullers should always be SOWed. Pullers should aggro
pull whenever possible to avoid being summoned.
<p><b>Scout:</b> The scout will scout ahead of the puller to let them know
where the mobs are and when it is best to pull. If you get attacked as
scout and know that there are too many mobs for the raid party to handle
you get to a good spot and die. Someone will get you soon enough. Same
as with pullers do not train the raid if you know there are too many mobs.
Scout should always be SOWed and wearing MR gear.
<p><b>Primary Enchanter: </b>This is the person who runs crowd control
on the raid. They have final say on what gets attacked in what order during
a fight.
<p><b>Assist: </b>Two tanks (warrior, SK, or pallie preferred) will be
apointed as primary and secondary assists. The primary assist will be the
one who everyone else will assist so that we are all on the same target.
Secondary assist will take over primary assist duties if the primary is
not there due to death or some other reason. The secondary assist will
also tank a second mob if it is a mob which can't be mezzed.
<p><b>Slower: </b>This job goes to the person who is responsible for slowing
the mobs so that they make fewer attacks usually a shaman. They should
shout when the slow sticks so everyone knows this. Your primary purpose
in this role is to have mana for slowing, everything else is secondary.
<p><b>MR lower: </b>This person is in charge of lower a mobs magic resistance
so that spells are resisted less. They also may use shout to shout out
the MR as been lowered. Your primary purpose in this role is to have mana
for lowering MR everything else is secondary.
<p><b>Group Leader:</b> This person forms their group and loots gems and
coin on mobs when their group gets the kill. They also report over \ooc
what was on the mob and if there are any special items which need to be
rolled for. Group leaders will roll for gems. They are also they only ones
who should answer questions for their group. At the end of the raid they
are to turn in the sellables (any non black saphire, diamond, jacinth items
-- these three are rolled for) and coin to the raid leader so that the
clerics and enchanters can be reimbursed for all the reagents they will
use up.
<p><b>Snarer: </b>This is person responsible for making sure that each
mob is snared so it can't run off and bring a train. They may use shout
to let everyone know when something is snared.
<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Groups</font></font></b>
<br>Groups should generally follow the guidelines I will supply thought
the raid leader can change them as they see fit or the situation demands
(i.e. Maestro or Inny).
<p><b>Pull Group: </b>This group will consist of 2 pullers (SK or monks),
a scout (rogue), primary enchanter, cleric and a secondary healer (druid
or shaman). The pullers and scouts are responsible for pulling mobs, the
enchanter will run crowd control for the raid and the two healers are to
keep the rest alive. However, the primary puller or chain puller should
only be healed if they say they can be when FD. This is because if an aggroed
puller is healed it will bring the mobs right to the group. If a rogue
is not available to scout or there is not a second FD puller the scout
will be replaced by the primary assist. When a chain puller is not available
the primary assist will pull mobs off the primary puller with an arrow
or spell on the primary puller's command, and ONLY on the primary puller's
command..
<p><b>Assist Group: </b>This groups should consist of the primary and secondary
assists, a cleric, and secondary healer and an enchanter. The other spot
can be any class and should include raid leader if raid leader is not in
the pull group. If the primary assist ends up in the pull group then this
group should include another melee type.
<p>After the two groups I set forth are formed the rest need to be formed
along the usual balanced group format as directed by the raid leader.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Mob Kill Order</font></font></b>
<br>Certain mobs are more dangerous and should be killed first if possible.
The first 4 are the most dangerous and if they are not mezzed should be
switched too. The last 8 can be done in any order really. The primary enchanter
will always have final say. Everyone should get familiar with the order
especially tanks who might end up as the primary assist. The order:
<p>1. Spite Golems
<br>2. AshenboneDrakes
<br>3. Female Forsaken Reverents
<br>4. Clerics of Innoruuk
<br>5. Male Forsaken Reverents
<br>6. Haunted Chests
<br>7. Scorn Banshee
<br>8. Kiraikueis
<br>9. Abbhorrents
<br>10. Loathing Liches
<br>11. Ire Ghasts
<br>12. Revultant Rats
<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Kill Strategy</font></font></b>
<p><b>Break-in</b>
<br>The method is 2 good groups head up at once invised. The next groups
head up in pairs a few minutes apart (to keep from crashing the zone with
too many folks zoning into the same area all at once). If no monster there
can see through invis then they wait till the other groups arrive before
fighting or until a monster which sees invis roams in. Once a monster aggroes
the fighting begins. Once the fight begins the two mobs in House 3 will
come running so there will be at least 3 mobs to fight (2 from House 3
and one roamer. There are 4 roamers that roam into the House 1 so eventually
all 4 will need to be killed. Avoid the walls like a plague as touching
them can aggro other mobs in House C or in south patrol. After break any
resses if necessary will be done and some medding done then pulling will
begin. Worst Case is a bunch of sprites or House C aggro results in a wipe
out in which case you repeat the first part again till House one is broken.
<p><b>Pulling Strategy</b>
<br>This strategy it for pulling to SW corner first rather then the NE
corner. I feel the SW corner is much easier because the mobs there generally
have smaller aggroes and are fewer than the those in the houses in the
NE area. It will allow you to get to House D (Maestro area) quicker and
once there you can pull the rest of the zone very safely including Inny's
area. In fact if things go smoothly after killing Maestro you can kill
Inny in an hour or so then start on the NE corner pulling to House D. Here
is the usual pull order; however, the raid leader may always change this
as they see fit..
<p>1) The first thing which must be done is to clear the south patrol spawns.
They will repop every 30 minutes so you will have to clear them until you
leave House 1. You pull them to FD spot 1.
<p>2) House 2 is pulled. However, the primary puller must Fd at the FD
spot 1 because it is possible to Aggro House C (I know from exp.) and they
will come to the room after 30 seconds or so if the primary puller is in
House 1. If they FD everything should be fine.
<p>3) House 5.
<p>4) House 6. Primary FD spot is now FD spot 2a. Chain puller takes from
there.
<p>5) House 7
<p>6) House C downstairs. This is a large house so it takes quite a few
pulls to clear. Also house A and B will aggro on some C pulls so they do
not need to be pulled. Pulling them first would likely aggro C and would
result in a massive train. After the downstairs is pulled you can also
pull theupstiars if you want but I would suggest waiting till you reach
House D and have killed Maestro then going ahead and pulling the upstairs
in house C.
<p>7) House 4. There is a chest upstairs that can be ignored till after
downstairs is cleared.
<p>8) Houses U and V. One mob in each. Primary FD spot is now FD spot 2b.
Chain puller takes from there.
<p>9) House S, SW corner, House R. If you are chain pulling the FD spot
for the primary puller is FD spot 2 and the chain puller will pull the
rest of the way. This spot give a very clear view so the cahin puller will
know much easier what has been pulled when to pull to the group. If you
only have one puller, the puller continues to pull to FD spot 1 and someone
pulls off his FD there.
<p>Get banshee at NE corner of House S first. This may also get a mob or
two from R but should not aggro SW corner. Someone needs to start timing
once the first SW corner mobs are pulled&nbsp; so you will know the repop
time from now til you move to House D. After that pull SW corner. Then
get whatever is left in House R. Last get the chest that is left in House
S.
<p>10) House Q.
<p>11) Once House Q has been cleared it is time to move to camp site 2.
You will need to have someone time the corner pops now cause they will
need to be cleared every 30 minutes for safety.
<p>12) Start pulling House D another large house. The puller will pull
this house to FD spot 3. The downstairs at least needs to be cleared for
Maestro. He has 4 guards that can be difficult to split. You should try
to split them all from maestro, but if you can’t get one or even possibly
2 you can still do Maestro it just takes a little more work. There are
three mobs upstairs you can either pull them before trying maestro or do
after. We cleared downstairs and did Maestro fine without aggroing the
upstairs. It is up to the pull team if they want to do them after or before
Maestro.
<p>13) House P. The primary puller should pull to FD spot 4. Then chain
puller will take them the rest of the way. This is because it is possible
to aggro Maestro pulling this house.
<p>14) Maestro time. We did this in House D usually. But there are three
possible methods. Method one is one I have done. If you can clear his guards
or at least all but 1 (maybe 2 but that would be bad) you can move up to
Camp Site 3. Make sure you are in middle off room so no roamers aggro.You
then form groups and buff up. See section called Maestro for the buffing
and grouping strategy. There are a couple other strategies also they are
detailed in the Maestro strategy section if you can't clear the guards.
<p>15) Now that you are in middle of house D you can pull the rest of the
zone from here much more safely than any other spot. If you did not do
the upstairs of House D before killing maestro you can now. After the upstairs
is pulled, the puller pulls to FD spot 5 the rest of the night except for
Inny where you go to him. This is great pull spot because it is wide open
and easy to see what has been aggroed by the puller so that the chain puller
will have a better idea of what is there. Also the pulls are long enough
that mobs get spaced some and chain puller will get less chain aggro when
they pull to group.
<p>16) House A and B. Pull whatever was not killed pulling House C earlier.
<p>17) House 9 the ramp. Pulling this ramp does not seem to aggor either
of the patrol routes spawns. If Inny is not up you can skip this or do
it later it is up to you. If he is up and you want to do him. It is best
to do it now so if you fail the first time you can try again. First you
pull the 2 drakes at the top. Then pull the south door house. Then do the
2 doors to the east. To the north is the inny room. You need to pull the
roamers in there before Inny can be done. The scout will let you know when
inny is not close so he does not DT the puller. Once all the mobs except
Inny and the 2 drakes in back which can be left they do not have to be
pulled. Move up to top of ramp and gather in the behind the ramp at the
top. Now follow the Inn strategy laid out later. Once he is dead you can
kill the 2 drakes or ignore them. Once done return to Camp Site 3
<p>17) If you did not do upstairs of House C earlier now is the time to
pull it. You can also skip it if you want.
<p>18) Clear North patrol spawns and you will have to kill them occasionally
afterwards as they spawn every 30 minutes. There are 6 of them.
<p>19) Start clearing the NE corner (houses E-O). I would pull in this
order. House E, H, N, O, F, J, M, G, L, K, I. But many orders would be
fine. The chain pulling and length of pulls should break up the mobs well
enough that getting too many should be unlikely.
<p>20) Port out..
<p><b>Maestro Strategy</b>
<br>Move to Camp site 3. Buff up on all the good hps, ac, and attack buffs
you have and most importantly resist magic. Maestro does not dispel so
no junk buffs are needed. Any MR gear should be donned now by tanks. Bards
should twist MR songs. MR is so important because he AoE a lifetap and
this will reduce damage from it greatly. Also, casters may also don MR
gear to some extent though because they should not be engaged in the first
half of the fight it is not has necessary for them and they could probably
go without or only add a couple items. They will need the extra mana for
the nuking at the end. Pets are summoned by all pet classes now. Once buffs
are finished med up to full.
<p>Groups are reformed. Usually the first group will be 4 (pure melee first
then hybrids) a cleric and bard. And as long has there are clerics and
bards to be in the group then the following few groups are formed the same.
If not then melee and several druids works fine once bards and clerics
run out. Last are the caster groups that should include a druid or shaman
healer if possible. Once buffed and formed up you are ready for Maestro.
<p>The strategy is for the tank groups to charge Maestro near his organ.
If guards remain the Enchanters will mezz any cleric that was not able
to be split away and killed earlier. If it is a spite golem (you want ot
avoid this at all costs) that is left you can either ignore it or assign
the weakest tank group to keep it busy. Once Maestro is at 50% health the
casters send in pets and start nuking. The raid leader will call for casters
to nuke. DO NOT NUKE EARLIER. When Maestro comes to you, casters do not
run. Stay grouped in the middle of House D other wise Maestro will run
all over and it will be much harder to kill. The tanks will come and everyone
will be fighting him in the middle area and he will be killed.
<p>If you have more then one guard left (or if it is a spite golem) near
Maestro you may want to pull him to Camp site 2. Buff and form up groups
the same in this case. I have not had to do this, but the strategy in this
case would be to stay tightly grouped in the SW corner and have everyone
unload on him from the start since there is not enough room for casters
to avoid his AoE lifetap. It might also be better for them to use MR items
in this scenario. This is a worse case scenario. In this case the primary
puller pulls Maestro to FD spot 3. Once the guards wander off then the
chain puller pulls Maestro (hopefully without any friends to the SW corner).
If friends come then the enchanters need to keep them mezzed if possible.
Once Maestro is dea then pull the last guards and move into hose D.
<p>Another method for pulling him from the previous guide is for the scout
to sit on the far east wall looking out between houses 5 and 6. Make sure
you are up the wall a little. The puller hits Maestro and runs to the area
in front of that alley and fds. Do not go in the alley or Maestro will
be too close to the scout and kill her. The assister would come out to
the corner by the totem and wait. When the scouts sees only Maestro above
the puller, she will give the word and the assister will shoot Maestro
and pull him into the zone room. For this to work takes timing, and the
roamers must be clear. The puller must stay down as the guards will probably
still be aggroed on him, but they should be back home. If they make it
home, and the scout will go there to make sure, then the puller can get
up. If they do not come then, the puller is safe to join the fun pounding
on Maestro and the scout can go poke some, too. There are a number of tactics
to actually kill him once pulled. This is only info on how to pull him.
After he is dead, you can safely pull his guards as will any pull to split.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Innoruuk Strategy</b>
<br>Once the North hall on level 2 is cleared the scout give the all clear
when Inny is away form the ramp and the whole raid party goes up the ramp
then groups behind the ramp and buffs for Inny. Inny does dispel so the
first 4 or 5 buffs should be junk buffs such as infravision, see invis,
resist poison, etc. After that buff with any hps, AC, and attack buffs.
One of the last buffs added should be resist magic so it will be one of
the last buffs dispelled if the fight lasts long. Pets should now be summoned.
Casters should med up when everyone is full mana you are ready. The lowest
level caster (they are unlikely do get much to stick to him) should now
be chosen to eat his DT. No special groups need to be formed for Inny.
The groups you have been in most of the night are fine.
<p>The scout will say when Inny is away from the ramp area. When he is
away you will move into the North hall hugging the wall on your left. The
Scout will go watch for Inny and position the sacrifice at the T intersection
straight out from the wall. When Inny gets close the scout will shout that
he is there and the sacrifice should nuke Inny and promptly get DTed (he
will DT every 30 secs or so after the first). Now everyone along the wall
charges to the T intersection and begins fighting Inny. DO NOT FIGHT HIM
NEXT TO A WALL. He will Gravity Flux you and you may end up stuck on the
3<sup>rd</sup> level unable to get down unless he summons you. If you are
away from the wall you will just hit the wall not go over it. Then you
just charge back into the fight. Casters will nuke right off and you must
be within melee range for your spells to work. If you follow these instructions
you should be fine as we killed him with 29 people and only lost 4 including
the sacrifice all to DTs. So even less peope can do it if you have the
right classes and levles. Once he is dead you can kill the 2 drakes left
along the north wall, port out or continue pulling the rest of hate from
House D. The raid leader will now make sure that loot is divied up according
to guild guidelines.
