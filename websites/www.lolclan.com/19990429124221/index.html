{LOL} Clan started as a group of fun loving Duke players who got fed up with the growing population of rude and inconsiderate 'net gamers. We have joined together to promote gamesmanship and netiquette across kali. Oh, we occasionally play games too! Our membership is an ecclectic group of folks with members all over the US and Canada, includeing Alaska and Hawaii. Members ages range from 50 to 9 years old, we have about a half dozen or more   married couples with both spouses on line (ALOT!),  we have one family with 8 members. And even one members mom!!

DethSquad was the brain child of Brian {LOL}GodsWrath, One of our rabid Q2 Rocket Arena players.  Brian put forth the idea of a different "persona" to go out on public RA servers with.  To scout out the different Clans playing style and abilities before issueing or accepting a challenge from them.  But as time wore on The DethSquad started getting a rep all its own.  So we legitamized it and made it a sub set of the {LOL} Clan with Brian as DethSquad#1.  Wanna see the the others? Go <A href="http://www.lolclan.com/ds.html">HERE</A> !

{LOL}Clan Code of Conduct 
</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Comic Sans MS, Arial, Helvetica">
As a Member of the {LOL} Clan, I shall:<BR>
<BR>
1. Be polite to all others at all times until such time as they prove unworthy and even then i will react with restraint and not allow myself to sink to their level.<BR>
2. Gracefully accept victory with a kind word for my opponents skill. <BR>
3. Even more gracefully accept my defeats with poise and sportsmanship. <BR>
4. Refrain from profane or vulgar behavior both in Chat and while Playing. <BR>
5. Never ever cheat. <BR>
<BR>
I understand that these 5 rules could not possibly cover every situation but will be my guide in choosing a response to any given situation. 
<BR>
<BR>
I agree with these guidelines and promise that I will adhere to them. I acknowledge that verified occurrences of non-compliance could be cause for dismissal from the Clan.

{LOL}Clan does NOT accept applications, nor 3rd party recommendations, nor constant email pleadings, nor impassioned letters, nor sorrowful phone calls.  As a matter of fact, we are not takeing ANY new members at all for any reason.   This is to ensure the quality of on-line life for {LOL}Clan members remains high.  We currently have  70  members  and as anyone who has had any experience in social or group dynamics will tell you, thats ALOT of people to try and administer to and keep happy.  So the chances of being asked to join are about nil to non-existent  :)
<BR>
<BR>
P.S.  We also ask for dues from our members.  Maintaining our Domain Server, our KALI License, and our Domian Name isnt free.
