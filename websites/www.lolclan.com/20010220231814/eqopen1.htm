    <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Well, there we were,
    peacefully blasting each other into small little giblets in Q2 RA. When Jody (Woodsman),
    Randy (Pyewacket) and Tim (Rellika) started ranting about the coolest game in the world, a
    little something called EQ.&nbsp; At the time it was still in BETA 3 or 4 and there was a
    healthy dose of skepticism amongst the rest of us following the Great UO Debacle.&nbsp;
    Well, They BETA'ed on and brought a few people they had met on the BETA servers into LOL
    Clan.&nbsp; Thus the Insidious Blight called EQ Addiction commenced.&nbsp; Final release
    of EQ hit the streets and a couple people were tempted into buying it. Those few then
    suborned 2 folks each, and they converted 2 more folks and they convinced 2 folks each,
    well, you get the picture.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pretty soon most of&nbsp; LOL Clan was hardwired
    into The Rathe server and running around Nek Forest mushing Moss Snakes with gleeful
    abandon.&nbsp; </font></p>

    doing Guild creations we were there almost at the head of the line.&nbsp; When we were
    created as </font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#00FFFF">Lost Souls</font><font
    face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> we had one of the very first Guilds on
    Rathe server.&nbsp; Over time, differing philosophies and playing styles began to emerge
    and we ended up with a pretty wide gulf between 2 separate groups.&nbsp; Rather than limp
    along with each group trying to co-exist under one guild banner we, the old core {LOL}
    Clan group, split off and created the </font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"
