<font size=2 face="comic sans ms">This is the home of LOL.  As you will  see, we have our roots in the old Duke Nukem craze of a few years ago.   The core group of both the Clan and Guild have been playing together for close to 5 years, going through several games starting with Duke, dabbled in Warcraft, C&amp;C, Unreal, Tribes, Starcraft, Diablo, Hellfire, Quake and the MANY variations of Q2.  Then, the ultimate downfall for the vast majority....EQ !!

<font SIZE=2 FACE="Comic Sans MS">{LOL} Clan started as a group of fun loving Duke players who got fed up with the growing population of rude and inconsiderate 'net gamers. We have joined together to promote gamesmanship and netiquette across kali. Oh, we occasionally play games too! Our membership is an eclectic group of folks with members all over the US and Canada, including Alaska and Hawaii. Members ages range from 50 to 9 years old, we have about a half dozen or more married couples with both spouses on line (ALOT!), we have one family with 8 members. And even one members mom!!

<font SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Arial, Helvetica">DethSquad was the brain child of Brian {LOL}GodsWrath, One of our rabid Q2 Rocket Arena players. Brian put forth the idea of a different &quot;persona&quot; to go out on public RA servers with. To scout out the different Clans playing style and abilities before issuing or accepting a challenge from them. But as time wore on The DethSquad started getting a rep all its own. So we legitimized it and made it a sub set of the {LOL} Clan with Brian as DethSquad#1. Wanna see the the others? Go <a href="http://www.lolclan.com/roster.htm">HERE</a> !</font>

<font SIZE=2 FACE="Comic Sans MS">As a Member of the {LOL} Clan, I shall:
<br>
<br>
1. Be polite to all others at all times until such time as they prove unworthy and even
then i will react with restraint and not allow myself to sink to their level.<br>
2. Gracefully accept victory with a kind word for my opponents skill. <br>
3. Even more gracefully accept my defeats with poise and sportsmanship. <br>
4. Refrain from profane or vulgar behavior both in Chat and while Playing. <br>
5. Never ever cheat.
<br>
<br>
I understand that these 5 rules could not possibly cover every situation but will be my
guide in choosing a response to any given situation.
<br>
<br>
I agree with these guidelines and promise that I will adhere to them. I acknowledge that
verified occurrences of non-compliance could be cause for dismissal from the Clan.</font>

<font SIZE="2" FACE="Comic Sans MS">{LOL}Clan does NOT accept applications, nor 3rd party recommendations, nor constant email pleadings, nor impassioned letters, nor sorrowful phone calls. As a matter of fact, we are not taking ANY new members at all for any reason. This is to ensure the quality of on-line life for {LOL}Clan members remains high. We currently have 70 members and as anyone who has had any experience in social or group dynamics will tell you, that's ALOT of people to try and administer to and keep happy. So the chances of being asked to join are about nil to non-existent :)

P.S. We also ask for dues from our members. Maintaining our Domain Server, our KALI License, and our Domain Name isn't free.</font>
