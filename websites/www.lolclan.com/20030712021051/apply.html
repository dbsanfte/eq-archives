<p>
First and most important you MUST read this thread in its entirety. By putting your application on this board you are agreeing to abide by our policies and will he held accountable as such. Each new Applicant is required to use the Online Application to apply. Please use the link located at the end of these guidelines.
</p>
</p><p>
If you disagree with anything within the policies, perhaps the League of Levity is not the best place for you.
</p>
</p><p>
<b>Purpose</b>
</p>
</p><p>
It is important to us that we get to know you and you us before any invitations will be extended to join League of Levity as a recruit or full member. We require all applicants to attend events/raids with us even before being accepted as a recruit. You will be given the raid channel to join. If you have a sponsor, you should also attempt to join any LOL experience groups in addition to raids. It is important for you to be known to some of the membership.
</p>
</p><p>
<b>Entry Requirements</b>
</p>
</p><p>
The League of Levity is an established guild on The Rathe. We're always on the look out for experienced and talented players of all classes. In order to become a contributing member in the shortest amount of time, we require you meet certain minimum requirements. Applicants should be at least level 58 with 6 AA. Past experience has shown that lower levels won't be able to participate effectively and will lead to frustration.
</p>
<p>
Only in the case of RL Family (husband, wife, son, daughter, brother, sister, father, mother), there are no specific requirements. These folks are allowed to be tagged immediately, however, the existing LOL member is responsible for ensuring their family members adhere to the LOL standards.
</p><p>
<b>Participation</b>
</p><p>
League members are what make the guild the great place that it is. In order for Guild Members to do this, their participation is needed. There are three areas of participation that are key to the League of Levity: participation in guild raids; participation in /guild chat; and participation on our guild Message Boards at http://www.lolclan.com. We do not force participation: our raids are not mandatory, you do not have to say hello to everyone that logs on in game, and we don't have a minimum monthly board post quota that you must reach. However, these three areas are what make it able for us to know you and you to know us, and we feel comfortable in that you wanting to be a Leaguers means you want to participate in LOL and aren't here just to get a fancy name tag.
</p><p>
<b>Minimum Equipment</b>
</p><p>
It is required that you are able to attain a minimum of 100 fire, or cold, or poison resistance unbuffed, while simultaneously having a minimum of 100 magic resistance. You must have at least one insta-click item. You must have your Sebilis key as a minimum.
</p><p>
<b>Faction</b>
</p><p>
The League of Levity is on Kael Giant faction.
</p><p>
<b>Sponsorship</b>
</p><p>
In addition to the general requirements listed above, you will need a LOL member who will act as your Official Sponsor. A Sponsor will teach you how to work well within the League of Levity, what rules we have, what techniques we use, and will try to answer any questions you may have. Having a Sponsor is a requirement, and once you have acquired a Sponsor your formal application process can begin. You may also be assigned one or more Guides. These are LOL members available to answer questions. As being a Sponsor puts a lot of responsibility on a member, we understand it may not be easy to get one, but without a sponsor, you will not be able to progress.
</p><p>
<b>Gatekeepers</b>
</p><p>
All applications are reviewed by the Gatekeepers Belew, Kalvarian, and Numagan. In addition to the online applications, each Gatekeeper and the respective Class Leader will interview the applicant in regards to your application and determine if you will be allowed into the guild as a recruit. While your application is being reviewed, you will be expected and encouraged to attend raids and with the help of your sponsor, join any LOL experience groups.
</p><p>
If approved by all Gatekeepers, your League of Levity E-Application will be accepted (notification via email) and you will start your Recruit phase.
</p><p>
<b>Stages of Recruitment</b>
</p><p>
Before submitting an application, you may attend LOL raids as an invited guest of your sponsor. Your sponsor will be required to coordinate this through the Event Organizer (EO). Once your application is accepted, you will be considered a Recruit for 30 days. Under extraordinary circumstances, the Gatekeepers may grant an extension to your 30-day Recruitment stage. During this time you are encouraged to attend any potential League of Levity raids. Guests and Recruits are not eligible for any loot.
</p><p>
No epic encounters will be engaged by the League of Levity on behalf of a Recruit.
</p><p>
You are allowed only one toon to be tagged into the guild during this stage. This one toon will be considered your "main" – this is the character you like and desire to contribute with.
</p><p>
Voting is open to all LOL members, and your application will be put to a vote at the end of your recruitment stage. Voting lasts for a seven day window. 
</p><p>
In order to be accepted as a Full Member, you must obtain a minimum of 65% yes, 35% abstain, 0 no votes. No votes must be explained via a PM to any GateKeeper. In the event of a valid no vote, app denied. (A "valid" no vote will be determined by the Council of Elders on a case by case system based on previous decisions by the Gatekeepers. In the event of no similar previous events to compare to, will be based on council debate and council vote to be concluded within 2 days).
</p><p>
In the event you obtain a large number of Abstain votes, your recruitment phase can be extended another 30 days, as long as you have not gotten any valid no votes. If after the end of the second 30 days, you still have not met the minimum vote requirement, you will be asked to /guildremove.
</p><p>
The LOL Council of Elders, on a case by case basis, may allow you to resubmit your application at a later date. In all other circumstances, you will not be allowed to resubmit to LOL.
</p><p>
If after your recruitment stage you are a good fit and have enjoyed your experiences with us and us with you, you will be tagged permanently. Welcome to the guild, hopefully you know your CLM's by this point and they will get you fitted into the system.
</p><p>
In all matters of recruiting, the LOL Guildmaster has final authority.
</p><p>
<b>Raid Rules and Requirements</b>
</p><p>
Event Organizers have complete authority during an event. If you fail to follow instructions, shout out contrary instructions, or otherwise cause additional delay or death you will be asked to leave.
</p><p>
Mobilization is crucial to getting an event off to a good start. Get to a common pick up spot and inform designated porters of your intent using /tell. If you don't know who is porting ASK, and then use /tell. If you fail to send a message to the designated porter within a reasonable time you will be left behind. We will have CoH set up when available. If you are late coming to an event please verify with the EO we can get to you before asking for a port. 
</p><p>
Corpse Retrieval: In the event CR is necessary find out who is dragging corpses and /consent them immediately. Clerics will get to you as soon as possible, in many cases without giving you a /tell, be READY to click YES.
</p><p>
Experience on Raids: If you want or expect experience on a raid don’t come. You end up making those around you miserable and it just causes tension. Come with the attitude that you are there to simply have fun being with friends. This is why we are all here.
</p><p>
<b>Guild Behavior</b>
</p><p>
Language: League Of Levity is a strong family based atmosphere; as such you are expected to act accordingly. We realize mistakes occur, but please keep them to a minimum. If you are offending those around you should have enough respect for your guild mates to know when to quit. Excessive complaints can result in action taken against you.
</p><p>
Flaming will not be tolerated on any level. If you have a problem with a person, in the guild or not, that you feel needs to be addressed let a guild officer know. The Co-Leaders and the other officers would be glad to help. That is what we are here for. All tells will be kept confidential unless otherwise discussed. Just keep in mind, when problems are brought out in the open that are inconsequential to other members it has the potential to damage future relationships between people who do not know one another well. End results being entirely negative causing bad morale and mistrust among fellow players. Failure to abide by this will result in action taken against you, as it is too powerful to ignore.
</p><p>
<b>Guildremoval</b>
</p><p>
If a member wishes to return to the guild after a /gr, then: the member will be allowed with the understanding they will undergo 30 days of probation. Any LAP points will be zero-ized in the database. No epic encounters on behalf of the probationary member.
</p><p>
If officer or leader, then relinquishes any positions of authority previously held before /gr'ing. After 30 day probation, guild leaders may put it to a vote whether the individual should be reinstated to any previous positions or not, chances are the individual won't be.
</p><p>
A five day Grace Period will be given on any one individual's first incident of /gr, beyond that the above Policy will be strictly enforced.
</p><p>
<b>Loot Policy</b>
</p><p>
LOL is a primary before secondary guild. Some exception may be made in those cases where a secondary is used A LOT to help the guild. Raid loot will be based on overall participation and assistance to the guild. This may not be the perfect solution, but it is consistent, and has served the guild well. To assist in this, LOL maintains a database to track participation and loot awards, the LOL Achievement System.
</p><p>
The CLM has the authority to award certain class loot like spells. Each class should visit their class sections on the message boards to keep the CLM up to date on what they have, and what they need. Epics fall in this realm. If anyone has a question about a loot call, please discuss it with your CLM in tells first to see what is up. If there is a problem that cannot be resolved, then take it up with a guild leader.
</p><p>
If any Guests will be looting, their ranking in their class will be determined by both GM and affected CLM after majority approval of those attending. Class membership approval may be sought at signup.
</p><p>
If you have any questions regarding your Application to LOL, please feel free to see me, Darkveinn, or any of LoL's CoLeaders (Panzyann, Deadlie, Naldwen, Panndor, and Samdarie) or an Officer of the Guild a /tell and we'll be sure to get an answer to you as soon as possible.
</p><p>
Again, thank you for your interest in League of Levity, and best of luck to you.
