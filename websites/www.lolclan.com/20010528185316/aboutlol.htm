LOL was started in August of 1996 by a group of Duke Nukem 3D Gamers. The first to use the badge {LOL} was {LOL}VictimBoy (later {LOL}Leviathan). The story goes, while in the Duke server on kali {LOL}VicimBoy and his group of friends were chastised by another server user for using the abbreviation LOL (laugh out loud) more than he cared for them to. While arguing was taking place, VictimBoy exited only to return a few minutes later as {LOL}VictimBoy. Since clans were just starting up in Duke circles this group of friends decided to start their own clan using the LOL badge, thus "Laff Out Loud" was born. <BR>

<BR>

The first members include; {LOL}VictimBoy, {LOL}GreatWhite, {LOL}GraveDiggr, {LOL}FXDB, {LOL}Motorbike, {LOL}Bucshot, {LOL}Trimster, {LOL}hctiB, {LOL}Woodsman, {LOL}Geronimo, {LOL}Hellrazor, {LOL}Starfox, {LOL}Shadow, {LOL}Kamando and {LOL}Ricochet. Since then LOL has grown to over 70 members (at the time of this writing). You can see a <A href="roster.htm">current list</A> of members here.<BR>

<BR>

Tiring of the excessive moronic language abuse on the Kali Duke server, it was decided approximately six months after LOL's start to secure it's own server for LOL use only. The first server was provided by {LOL}Ricochet. The current server is provided by {LOL}PainFool.<BR>

<BR>

Started as a Duke 3D clan it's members now enjoy a wide variety of games, including;<BR>
<BR>
Duke 3D<BR>
Quake II<BR>
Quake III<BR>
EverQuest<BR>
Unreal Tournament<BR>
Diablo<BR>
and others...<BR>

<BR>

LOL is comprised of a very talented group of gamers. Well over half the clan has made it to the top 50 of Cases Duke 3D ladder with a large number of those reaching the top 10. The highest rank held by a current member is #3 by {LOL}Pyewacket.<BR>

<BR>

LOL's latest adventures by LOL are EverQuest, Unreal Tounament and Quake III. Quite a few of us are also looking forward to Diablo II.<BR>

<BR>

*Note: On October 25, 1997 Steve Simpson ({LOL}VictimBoy) was killed in an auto accident. A personal friend of Hunter and Barb ({LOL}GreatWhite and {LOL}GraveDiggr) and an online friend to all of LOL he will be sorely missed. Without Steve LOL would have never been.
