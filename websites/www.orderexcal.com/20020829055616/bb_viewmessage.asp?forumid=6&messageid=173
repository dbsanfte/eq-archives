							<p>Tuesday morning, September 11th, 2001.  Like every other morning of every other day.  Thousands, millions of people got up from the comfort of their beds, showered and dressed, grabbed a quick cup of coffee and mumbled a "Good Morning" or "Good-Bye" to their loved ones, then headed off to the Financial District for a hard day ahead.  They did not know. </p><p></p><p>Maybe they left without even a word.  Maybe they didn't kiss their husband or wife good-bye.  Maybe the seething wounds of an argument the night before were still hot in their breast.  Maybe they were glad to leave and head to work.  They did not know.</p><p></p><p>But these were GOOD people.  They were going to work. They were making a difference. Many had already stopped by the polls early to vote, but still wanted to put in a full day at their firm, or cleaning windows, or sorting the mail. They were smart, hard working, enduring the subway ride to the terminal at the World Trade Center.  They did not know. </p><p></p><p>And the tourists! There is no greater view of Manhattan and its environs than from the observation deck of the massive Twin Towers.  Happy, skipping children from around the world were chattering in Japanese and French and German as they took the amazing elevator ride up and up and up.  They did not know.</p><p></p><p>Others had waited patiently for their flight, vying to get a better seat, to start the next phase of life far from Boston.  Vacation plans swirling. Business deals. Students returning to university. Mothers nursing their babies.  Happy to be going and moving on with life.  They did not know. </p><p></p><p>And then the unspeakable.  It looked like an accident.  A tragic mistake of a careless pilot.  The plane careeming into the tower. Flames. Screams. One breath on earth, the next in eternity.  And the world watched.  CNN cameras swung on to the scene of this terrible 'accident'.  We were glued to our television sets, listening in stunned silence in the freeway's gridlock. We did not know.</p><p></p><p>Then the second plane. In clear sight, banking to hit the Tower head on. The ball of flame and shower of debris join the pillar of cloud rising upward from the stricken building.  Many had no chance to think about it. They were ushered instantly into the presence of God. Most were not directly impacted and immediately started down the long slow process of 70, 80, 90 flights of stairs on one of the fire escapes.  Orderly, many talking on cell phones with loved ones saying they were leaving the building.  They did not know.</p><p></p><p>Fire fighters and police, New York's finest, were racing through the buildings, helping to evacuate.  The danger, they assumed, was from fire spreading.  Get out the folks, especially those below the fire level, as quickly as possible.  Set up triage and medical help at ground level for those who escaped. Away from danger. Out in the sunlight and far from the choking smoke. They did not know.</p><p></p><p>Then a rumbling as the steel girders began to buckle. The flames from thousands of gallons of jet fuel had taken their toll on the weakened walls.  And we all watched in horror as each Tower in turn imploded downward into a heap of twisted searing metal.  Thousands still inside. Hundreds of rescue personnel in the buildings or on the ground helping the walking wounded.  No one could have imagined. No one knew.</p><p></p><p>Had they known, would life have been different? Of course.  Had we known, would we not have told them? Most certainly.  But not one of those persons knew that Tuesday, September 11, 2001, would be their last day on earth. Oh, they all knew that they would die "some day" and perhaps most believed they would then face God.  But that day? And were they ready?  I do not know. </p><p></p><p>The lesson is clear. It does not take a college professor to drive home a point already understood.  We do not know when that day will come and we must be prepared.  Because that day IS coming for each one of us.  This I know.</p><p></p><p>Stephen Levine asks, "If you were going to die today and had only one phone call you could make . . . who would you call and what would you say?  And why are you waiting?"</p><p></p><p>"The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe." Proverbs 29:25</p>
