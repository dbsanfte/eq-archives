							<p><b>Hey Pro!</b></p><p><p>I'm still around, though not as much as I used to. In EQ, that is. Frankly EQ is just too boring and stale for me, so that I find no fun doing the everyday XP grinding there. I do log in my shaman at weekends mostly to do raids, that's all I really have used him lately. Raiding PoF, PoH, PoH and bunch of other places.. This sunday for example a Plane of Growth raid is planned again, and I will particiapte there with my shaman, again. I am raiding with XA (Xegony Alliance), as they are hosting many raids and in many cases, the schedule is good for me.</p></p><p><p>I have to say though that my shaman is not in Excalibur at the moment. As I still aim with him to get his epic (and he's close, 2 items to get, from which 1 is already planned and defaulted to him), I needed the "active" guild and as we're not really active in EQ anymore, I moved him on. He's at the moment in the guild called Invincible. Strong guild, we can enter any plane on our own and hold it and clear it, just that again, they are mostly on at US times and as you all know, it's not really a good time for me.. But the rest of my chars are still in Excalibur, i.e. Whailor the warrior. At the moment he's in North Karana, he's almost lvl 49. If you - or anyone in Excalibur still in EQ - want to hunt, drop me e-mail to <i>alca@trenet.ee</i> and I get him on - or shaman - and we hunt. We used to do really fun raids at weekends, me, Mintar, Trumag, Satin and Undecided, to Tower of Frozen Shadows, but lately all but me seem to be too busy to log to EQ heheh..</p></p><p><p>I play now mostly AO - Anarchy Online - though. I am on Rubi-Ka 2 server. Funcom has really fixed the game and it's actually quite playable now. Sure, it aint SWG yet, but it sure is Sci-Fi heheh.. So I am getting the "feeling". Funcom has actually a pretty good offer on AO: namely, you can download the game from <a href="http://www.anarchy-online.com"><b>Anarchy Online</b></a> site and install it. Then you have 7 DAYS (week) to play it WITHOUT paying a DIME. Once these 7 days are over and you have not cancelled your account, they will charhe you for $19 - the price of the game - and from that moment on, you have still 30 days left to play FREE, without a monthly fee. Once that 30 days are over and you have not cancelled the account, they will charge from that day on the monthly fee of $12, or whatever option you chose. Money-wise it's really a detail, so not expensive at all. At the same time it's TOTALLY different then EQ, DAoC, AC and such and still hold fun for me. Sure, once SWG beta is out (and if I get in) I will cancel all these accounts, but as for now, it's fun and I play it daily. My char's name there is <b>Arder</b>, he's now lvl 60 Martial Artist (like monk in EQ).</p></p><p><p>I suggest to get AO too and try it out. When you do get it, create a char on Rubi-Ka 2, clan side (you can switch sides always) and then send me a tell, and I will meet you, advise you, help you get started. For a short time it's quite OK game, and you will sort of get into sci-fi feeling before SWG is out heheh..</p></p><p><b>Banadan Skuld</b></p><p></p>
