      interested members! Please browse through our pages and familiarize
    yourself with Order of the Dragons people and there conversations on the public bulletin
    board.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">Our basic philosophy is contained in the <a href="duty.htm">Guild
    Duty</a>. If when reading these words you find yourself agreeing, then possibly we are the
    guild for you.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">Our membership policy is centered around getting to know some of
    the people in the guild. The details follow, but in general you must have sponsors who
    will put you forth to the Order of the Dragon membership. After consideration by the
    membership, the officers will make the final decision on each candidate. The more people
    you meet on your travels, and the more often you demonstrate the values of Order of the
    Dragon, the easier it is to become a member.</font></p>

        <br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font color="#000000">Seek out Order of the Dragon members (around your level is usally
        best as you can group together) and get to know them with the purpose of obtaining
        sponsors.<br>
        <br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font color="#000000">Look to the <a href="roster.htm">Rosters</a> to find people.

        <br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font color="#000000">Once you have found a sponsor return here and make a forum post

    <p><font color="#000000">If for some reason you don't get enough sponsor points within the
    time allotted, or are not selected, do not dispair, keep trying to meet more people and do
    good in Norrath.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">Keep up the great work through your probation period and try to
    be active in guild chat and on the boards to get to know everyone.</font></p>

    </small></strong>Name<br>

    <p>Below that initial Post everone is allowed to post comments about you with the
    following rules. If you are sponsoring the person, please make the Subject SPONSOR if you
    know the person or have other information that can spead the process, include it here as
    well. If you are not sponsoring the person, then the subject and body of the message can
    contain anything that you want.</p>
    <p>20 sponsor points are required to be considered for OOD. Sponsor points are equivalent
    to your rank number if you are sponsoring someone. So if you are rank 4 then your
    sponsorship is worth 4 points. All officers count as 10 sponsor points. Only 1 sponsorship
    per player, so if you have multiple characters, chose your highest ranking character. Also
    remember you can only sponsor every calander month (speak to a online officer for override
    of this rule this is done on a per case basis.)<br>
    Check the Responsibilities list for details.</p>
    <p>The person will be on the Administration Board for 1 week minimum.</p>
    <p>Mid-week usually on Wednesdays the Administration Board will be checked for possible
    candidates. If the candidate gathers enough sponsor points then he or she will be moved
    over to the officer board for final approval. If the candidate doesn't recieve enough
    sponsor points, then the post will remain on the private board to gather more sponsors. If
    the candidate doesn't have the sponsors within 1 month of the original post then he and
    she must be reposted to be considered for membership. A list of candidates pending officer
    approval will be posted to the Administration Board.</p>
    <p>The candidate will be considered on the officer board for one week. If there is no
    officer that has an objection to the new candidate then they will be considered approved
    for membership.</p>
    <p>The candidate will receive an email about his or her status and if approved the names
    of the officers to contact to be invited so please insure this info is correct.<big><br>
    <br>
    </big>There will be the typical probation period of 1 month where a member can be removed
    for just not fitting in to the guild. After those weeks he or she will be considered a
    full member of Order of the Dragon and gain all voting privledges. If the person is
    removed from the guild for any reason he or she must wait 1 month before being sponsored
    again.</p>
