        Groom and Bride stand near the<br>
        wizard ring of Kelethin, with the guests in a circle around<br>
        them. Soandso instructs everyone to disarm their weapons and<br>
        notifies Cleric when all is ready.<br>
        <br>
        Cleric gates into the circle right in front of the wedding party.<br>
        <br>
        Welcome, dear friends, to the joining of Groom and Bride.<br>
        <br>
        Let the four directions be honored, that love, peace, power, and<br>
        radiance enter our circle.<br>
        <br>
        With the blessing of the hawk of dawn soaring through the clear blue<br>
        sky, we turn to the east and call upon the spirits of air.<br>
        <br>
        With the blessing of the great stag in the heat of the chase, we turn to<br>
        the south and call upon the spirits of fire.<br>
        <br>
        With the blessing of the koalindl of wisdom who dwells within the sacred<br>
        waters of the pool, we turn to the west and call upon the spirits of<br>
        water.<br>
        <br>
        With the blessing of the great bear whose strength flows from the fruit<br>
        of the forests, we turn to the north and call upon the spirits of earth.<br>
        <br>
        May the harmony of our circle be complete.<br>
        <br>
        May we all be united in perfect love.<br>
        <br>
        Who walks the path of the moon to stand before all present to declare<br>
        her sacred vows?<br>
        <br>
        Bride: I do.<br>
        <br>
        Who walks the path of the sun to stand before all present to declare his<br>
        sacred vows?<br>
        <br>
        Groom: I do.<br>
        <br>
        Will you love survive the clear light of day, continuing to breathe life<br>
        into your relationship?<br>
        <br>
        BOTH: It shall.<br>
        <br>
        Then accept the blessing of the element of air in this place of spring.<br>
        May your union be blessed by the light of every new dawn.<br>
        <br>
        Will your love survive the harsh fires of change to continue to burn<br>
        even brighter?<br>
        <br>
        BOTH: It shall.<br>
        <br>
        Then accept the blessings of the element of fire in this place of<br>
        summer.&nbsp; May your hearts and home be filled with warmth.<br>
        <br>
        Will your love survive the ebb and flow of feeling, continuing to be a<br>
        well spring?<br>
        <br>
        BOTH: It shall.<br>
        <br>
        Then accept the blessings of the element of water in this place of<br>
        autumn.&nbsp; May the cup of your life be filled with love.<br>
        <br>
        Will your love survive the times of stillness and restriction,<br>
        continuing to anchor your hearts together?<br>
        <br>
        BOTH: It shall.<br>
        <br>
        Then accept the blessings of the element of earth, in this place of<br>
        winter.&nbsp; May your union be strong and fruitful.<br>
        <br>
        As the grass of the fields and the trees of the forest bend together<br>
        under the pressure of the storm, so you two must bend when the wind of<br>
        change blows strong.<br>
        <br>
        May you both stand strong in each others strength. As you give strength,<br>
        so you will receive strength. As you give love, so you will receive<br>
        love.<br>
        <br>
        Together you are strong in love, may your love feed you and keep you<br>
        well.<br>
        <br>
        Groom and Bride, do you have the symbols representing the<br>
        eternity of the great mysteries of life?<br>
        <br>
        BOTH: We do.<br>
        <br>
        Before all present exchange your rings.<br>
        <br>
        May the warmth and light of your union be blessed.<br>
        <br>
        Cleric binds Groom and Bride together at the wrists with a garland<br>
        of colorful ribbons.<br>
        <br>
        Do you swear upon the land your mother to be true to your promises?<br>
        <br>
        BOTH: We do.<br>
        <br>
        Then seal these promises with a kiss.<br>
        <br>
        In the name of Tunare, Mother of all, I now pronounce you husband and<br>
        wife! May you walk together life's long path.<br>
        <br>
        We thank the powers of love and peace for their presence in this circle.<br>
        <br>
        Let the spirits of the four directions be thanked for their energy and<br>
        blessings.<br>
