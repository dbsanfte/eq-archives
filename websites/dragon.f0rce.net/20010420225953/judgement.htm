    There may come a time when a member will require disciplinary action because he/she has
    strayed from the ways of the Guild. While this is a topic that we do not enjoy discussing,
    and one we don't expect to come into play often, it is vital that a documented means of
    disciplining errant members be established.<p>While this may appear to be a harsh and
    cumbersome procedure, we believe that the application process for adding guild members
    will minimize the number of members who will partake in activities that will damage the
    reputation of our guild.<ol>
      <li>In cases where an officer of the guild witnesses blatant violation of guild policy by a
        guild member, it is the obligation of the officer to expel the member from the guild and
        notify the Guild Leader. A member may petition his case to the Guild Leader to determine
        if the circumstances warranted Expulsion, however the circumstances as reported by the
        officer will be taken as factual and his authority to expel members not undermined. In
        short, there will be few reversals of a decision to Expel a member.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>In cases where a member of the guild witnesses blatant violation of guild policy by a
        guild member, it is the obligation of the witnessing member to report the violation to an
        officer of the guild. The officer of the guild will then be obligated to consider the
        manner of the offense and take actions to verify the report and take appropriate action.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>In cases where activities deemed inappropriate in Norrath society or damaging to guild
        standing in society are witnessed, the incident should be reported and the member in
        question will be asked to defent his actions. If his actions are justified, no action will
        be taken against him. If the member is found to be at fault, he will be asked to refrain
        from repeating the activity in question and the offense will be noted. Repeat offenders
        will be brought before an officer and disciplinary actions ranging from performing civic
        duties to guild expulsion will be taken. depending on the severity and frequency of the
        infractions.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>In cases where lawful and good citizens of Norrath are heard complaining about the
        activities of a guild member, it is the duty of the officers to convene and determine a
        means of monitoring the guild member's activities to see if the allegations are truthful
        and whether disciplinary action is needed.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><p align="center">Officer's are ultimately responsible for the action of those that are
        in the guild. If an officer is negligent in his or her duty, the officer will be subject
        to demotion.<br>
