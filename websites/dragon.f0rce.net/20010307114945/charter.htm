        <h4 align="left">1. SUMMARY</h4>
        <p align="left"><img border="0" src="images/dragon18.gif" align="left" width="101" height="116">The
        Order of the Dragon is a guild that represents the best of the races and
        classes of Norrath. We are committed to upholding the highest ideals of
        Truth, Justice, Honor, Strength, Loyalty, Brotherhood and Sisterhood. We
        are united together to fight for the interests of the Guild and to
        uphold the ideals we represent; to help other members in times of need;
        to foster an environment of friendship and camaraderie; to be a guiding,
        helpful force to others in need; and to serve as role models for others
        to emulate. We are a neutral Guild and believe everything exists as a
        necessary and integral part of the whole, each thing as a check and
        balance for the other. For what is good if there were not evil, or
        happiness without suffering. By maintaining balance throughout the
        world, we are better able to appreciate that which we have. All who
        possess these same ideals, goals, and beliefs, regardless of Race or
        Class, are friends of the Order of the Dragon.</p>
        <h4 align="left">2. OVERVIEW</h4>
        <p align="left">History tells us that in aeons past, Veeshan, the
        Crystalline Dragon and Ruler of the Plane of Sky, came upon the world
        and found it pleasing. The world then was pure and uncorrupted. She
        deposited her brood and thus began the age of scale. Great dragons
        roamed the lands and flew the skies. They were powerful beings of great
        intellect, wisdom and strength. The beauty and majesty of the world was
        unparalleled. In time, other gods took notice of Veeshan’s discovery
        and came unto the world. These gods created the elder races of Norrath
        and in turn, evil was brought into the world as well. In time, the
        dragons were driven from mastery of the over-world and the lesser races
        soon laid claim to all the lands. They spread across the length and
        breadth of Norrath and with their growth so too grew evil upon the
        lands. The world was brought into balance. Today, there is great need
        upon Norrath for the revival of the virtues of Truth, Justice, Honor,
        Strength, Loyalty, Brotherhood and Sisterhood. A need to restore Norrath
        to the same beauty, majesty and grandeur that Veeshan first saw in the
        world. A restoration of the balance of all things. A world uncorrupted
        by pettiness and greed. The Order of the Dragon was formed to uphold
        these ideals, to maintain the balance of all things, and to stand as
        role models for others to emulate. To best uphold our guiding ideals, we
        are duty bound to develop our abilities and skills to be the best of our
        classes and races and to be recognized by others as such. There is also
        a recognized need to have a place where one can find fellowship,
        camaraderie, and loyalty. The Order of the Dragon is a guild that will
        always put other members needs and interests before their own and
        provide aid to other members in times of need, no matter the risk. All
        members are duty bound to render aid to fellow members when called upon
        to do so. The Order of the Dragon is more than a fellowship of
        adventurers. We are a family: brothers and sisters bound in the pursuit
        of common goals. There is also a great need upon Norrath for teaching
        and guidance of the young. There are many inexperienced adventurers who
        could benefit greatly from the helpful guidance of the experienced, and
        in turn, may develop to further the cause of the Guild. As
        representatives of the best of the classes of Norrath, we are duty bound
        to recognize the worthy and needy and render assistance in the best
        interests of the guild. There are many races and classes upon Norrath,
        all with their own personal goals, abilities, and objectives. The Order
        of the Dragon is a guild of neutral alignment. We do not discriminate
        based on Race or Class. Any who strive to follow the ideals that we
        represent are friends of the Guild. As representatives of the best of
        the classes of Norrath, full membership is open to all that agree to
        uphold the ideals and bylaws as put forth by the Guild and have achieved
        a minimum of 20<sup>th</sup> rank. Additionally, all prospective members
        prior to initiation into the ranks of the Order of the Dragon must
        complete an apprenticeship period and a quest which will be assigned by
        the Guild quest officer.</p>

        <h4>4. GENERAL POLICIES</h4>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>New members</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The recruiting officer(s) will recruit new members as the need
          arises to maintain a balance of skill sets within the guild and as
          merit indicates. Potential new members may also initiate a request to
          be admitted.</p>
          <p>The potential initiate is to be assigned an apprenticeship and is
          required to journey with several guild members so his / her
          suitability and compatibility with the guild may be assessed. The
          apprenticed individual will be assigned to an appropriate guild
          member. That member is responsible for determining the successful
          completion of apprenticeship. Additionally, all members must be
          afforded the opportunity to meet the candidate. In addition to
          completion of an appropriate apprenticeship period, all candidates
          must complete a Quest in the name of the Guild as assigned by the
          Guild officer.</p>
          <p>In extreme cases when aiding an exceptional individual of lower
          than 20<sup>th</sup> rank, a member may petition for Apprentice status
          for the individual of less than 20<sup>th</sup> rank. If approved by
          unanimous vote of membership council, the apprenticed individual is by
          rights a provisional guild member while performing apprenticeship and
          is entitled to all rights, responsibilities and benefits, but without
          carrying the guild name. An individual accepted into Apprentice status
          is to be trained according to the Guilds ideals and Bylaws, and upon
          successful completion of Apprenticeship (as determined by mentor),
          guarantees guild membership when appropriate level achieved. In RARE
          circumstance, an individual who has successfully completed an
          apprenticeship, may be granted guild entry prior to attainment of 20<sup>th</sup>
          rank only with the UNANIMOUS vote of all officers.</p>
