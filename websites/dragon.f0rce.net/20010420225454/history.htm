    History tells us that in eons past, Veeshan, the Crystalline Dragon and Ruler of the
    Plane of Sky, came upon the world and found it pleasing. The world then was pure and
    uncorrupted. She deposited her brood and thus began the age of scale. Great dragons roamed
    the lands and flew the skies. They were powerful beings of great intellect, wisdom and
    strength. The beauty and majesty of the world was unparalleled. In time, other gods took
    notice of Veeshan&#146;s discovery and came unto the world. These gods created the elder
    races of Norrath and in turn, evil was brought into the world as well. In time, the
    dragons were driven from mastery of the over-world and the lesser races soon laid claim to
    all the lands. They spread across the length and breadth of Norrath and with their growth
    so too grew evil upon the lands. The world was brought into balance. Today, there is great
    need upon Norrath for the revival of the virtues of Truth, Justice, Honor, Strength,
    Loyalty, Brotherhood and Sisterhood. A need to restore Norrath to the same beauty, majesty
    and grandeur that Veeshan first saw in the world. A restoration of the balance of all
    things. A world uncorrupted by pettiness and greed. The Order of the Dragon was formed to
    uphold these ideals, to maintain the balance of all things, and to stand as role models
    for others to emulate. To best uphold these ideals, we are duty bound to develop our
    abilities and skills to be the best of our classes and races and to be recognized by
    others as such. </p>
