<h2>Raid Loot Rules</h2>

<p>Divine Prophecy uses a restricted /random system. The restrictions are based 
on if your character is a Main, Bot, Alt, or Probate, and when you last won. You 
should only roll if you CAN and WILL use the item.</p>
<p>The overall number one rule of our system is PEOPLE &gt; LOOT. We are all part of 
the same great guild, and a win for a guildie is a win for the guild. The friend 
you helped get an upgrade today will be the friend helping you get an upgrade in 
the future. No piece of pixel loot is worth losing a friend over. Rude, jealous, 
or spiteful remarks will not be tolerated.</p>
<h4>Rolling order is as follows:</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Tier 1 - Mains (lvl x 10 - 1000) &amp; Bots (1 - 1000) without a 2-week win.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Tier 2 - Mains &amp; Bots with one 2-week win.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Tier 3 - Mains &amp; Bots with two 2-week wins. (We'll add additional tiers 
	on-the-fly for 3+ wins should the rare need arise)<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Raid Loot. (Doesn't count as a 2-week win, but counts as a win for that 
	day meaning you can't roll on anything else that day. These are usually 
	items that aren't a big upgrade)<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Alts. (Only counts as a Raid Loot win since it's not an upgrade for any 
	Main or Bots)<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Probates.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Greed Loot. (Anybody who hasn't won anything that day can roll at 1 
	-1000. It doesn't count as any kind of win and the winner can do whatever 
	he/she wants with it since it isn't an upgrade for anybody. At rare times an 
	item may be kept for sale for guild funds)
</ol>
<h4>Bots</h4>
<blockquote>
	<p>Regardless of how many characters you have you can only have one character 
	designated as your Main and one designated as your Bot (a character on a 
	separate account that is played along with a Main), all others are Alts. 
	Bots must meet the current minimum application requirements to roll as a Bot. 
	A Bot designated character will be considered an Alt for loot purposes if 
	the Main character is not being played also unless the raid leader 
	specifically requests otherwise. Botters must choose between rolling with 
	their Main (lvl x 10 - 1000) or their Bot (1 - 1000), but not both. A win 
	for either counts as a win for both. People should only bring Bots to help 
	and only if they are capable both pc-wise and skill-wise to play two 
	characters in a raid environment. AFK Bots that do nothing and are only 
	brought for a chance at loot will be dealt with by the officers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Tracking</h4>
<blockquote>
	<p>Wins are tracked by officers and entered into the messageboard loot system 
	created by Talei and on the guild management tool. Should you find a 
	discrepancy, contact an officer ASAP. If an officer isn't present at a guild 
	raid (and this is rare), the raid leader is responsible for recording any 
	2-week wins and getting that information to an officer.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Changing a character's designation</h4>
<blockquote>
	<p>You can change a character from an Alt to your Main (or change Bots) once 
	every 30 days through an officer, but not during a raid.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>General</h4>
<blockquote>
	<p><b>Officers reserve the right to restrict items to certain classes based on 
	their assessment of the item and it's effects.</b> If you disagree with a 
	decision, bring it up on the messageboards or with the officers AFTER the 
	raid. We are human, we will make mistakes, but don't disrupt a raid. But 
	think before you speak or post, and do so in a calm manner. Restrictions are 
	made with the guild in mind and we try to do so only when we feel it's truly 
	necessary.</p>
	<p>When you win something you are not allowed to roll on *anything* else that 
	day unless absolutely everyone else passes.</p>
	<p>If you win another item before your 2-week timer expires, your time is reset 
	starting on the day of the latest win. Multiple wins are tracked and you 
	roll based on how many times you won in the last two weeks. Whenever you win 
	something you aren't allowed to roll again for two weeks unless all others 
	above you in the roll order pass.</p>
	<p>If you win on Thursday, Jan 1st, you are considered a non-winner again in 
	fourteen days, or Thursday, Jan 15th.</p>
	<p>Wins are recorded according to the day the raid started EST.</p>
	<p>If specifically requested by the raid leader to play an Alt for raid needs, 
	that character can roll as a Main for that raid.</p>
	<p>All items should be considered 2-week win items unless specifically 
	mentioned here. At this time, Spectral spells and Ancient spells don't count 
	as any kind of win, but Rune spells count as 2-week wins. When we start 
	encountering Runes on a more regular basis and fewer people need them then 
	we will change it.</p>
	<p>If you have the highest roll on an item and choose to pass for whatever 
	reason, it will automatically go to the next highest roll. You cannot win 
	something and choose to pass to somebody specific. You should only roll if 
	the item is a worthwhile upgrade and you intend to loot if you win. At times 
	guildies win something and notice who was the next highest, then choose to 
	pass because it's a bigger upgrade for that person or perhaps that person 
	hasn't won in a long time. This is admirable but should never be expected 
	nor should anybody ever be criticized for not doing it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Quest items</h4>
<blockquote>
	<p>The first item used for a quest will count. Things like the Dain head where 
	it's only one item will count, because the end result is why we kill the 
	Dain. Other quests where it takes multiple items, only the first one will 
	count, and if nobody else has started the quest, all subsequent drops will 
	be awarded to that person. Part of the reason why quest items count is to 
	ensure that only people who will seriously do the quest will roll. Too often 
	have I seen people roll on quest items without a clue as to how to do the 
	quest, what faction is needed, what other parts are needed, and what the end 
	result is.</p>
	<p>Orbs of Luclinite count as Raid Loot so if you roll on loot and win 
	something, you can't roll on an Orb. As we come across other valuable quest 
	items we'll evaluate their worth, but always assume everything counts as a 
	2-week win.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Selling loot won at a raid</h4>
<blockquote>
	<p>2-week, Quest, and Raid Loot wins can NOT be sold until you offer it to all 
	other guild Mains. If no other guild Main can use the item, then you are 
	free to sell it. Greed rolls wins can be sold right after you win.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Abuse or mistakes</h4>
<blockquote>
	<p>If the officers feel that somebody is repeatedly and intentionally trying to 
	abuse the way our loot system works then we will take disciplinary action 
	such as adding weeks to your win timer or totally removing any loot rights 
	for a period of time. If you roll, win, and loot a no-drop item that you are 
	not eligible to roll for, the officers will review the situation and decide 
	if any disciplinary action is necessary. We recognize mistakes can happen 
	but at the same time everybody is responsible for knowing their own loot 
	status and shouldn't depend on the officers to catch a mistake before it's 
	too late.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Botting others</h4>
<blockquote>
If you are botting somebody else's character for the purpose of getting them a flag, the character being botted will have Alt loot rights regardless of what that character is in the guild (Main/BoT/Alt) unless the raid leader specifically asked you to play that character.
