    <p>This document explains how to install, configure and run
    Apache 1.3 under the <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>
    layer for Microsoft Windows. Cygwin is a POSIX.1 emulation
    layer for 32-bit Microsoft Windows operating systems.</p>

    <p>The <a href="windows.html">Win32 port</a> of Apache is built
    on its own, custom code within Apache to assure
    interoperability with Windows operating systems. While it is
    considered release quality, it is slower and less thoroughly
    tested than the Unix ports. The Cygwin alternative uses the
    well tested Unix code by using the Cygwin portability layer for
    POSIX.1 emulation. The Cygwin port may suffer from gaps in
    security or reliability due to the interaction of the Cygwin
    compatibility layer with the native Windows API.</p>

    <p>The <a href="windows.html">Win32 port</a> will be more
    familiar to most Windows users. The Cygwin port (including the
    build environment) will be more familiar to Unix admins and
    developers. Due to these two different code bases, the security
    and reliability of the two ports are unrelated to each other.
    The Win32 port should be considered the more secure of the two
    at this time. The Win32 port is recommended for most Windows
    users, however the Cygwin port offers an extra layer of
    compatibility for Unix developers.</p>

    <p>Apache still performs best, and is most reliable, on Unix
    platforms. First benchmarks have shown that the same Apache
    setup on Cygwin performs about 30% slower than the
    corresponding native Windows version.</p>

    <p>Most of this document assumes that you have a working Cygwin
    installation and want to compile Apache yourself from the
    original distribution sources.</p>

    <h2><a id="hist" name="hist">History of Apache for
    Cygwin</a></h2>

    <p>Cygwin support for Apache began with Apache 1.2.6 and Cygwin
    b18.</p>

    <p>Due to licensing issues there has not been an official
    binary distribution until Red Hat Inc. (who merged with Cygnus
    Solutions Inc.) changed their Cygwin license to ensure compiled
    executables do not fall under GPL license if the distributed
    software is considered as open source.</p>

    <p>Cygwin is supported in the official source distributions
    from Apache 1.3.20 and later. Pre-compiled binaries for the
    Cygwin platform (without the <code>cygwin1.dll</code>) will be
    supplied at <a
    href="http://www.apache.org/httpd">http://www.apache.org/httpd</a>
    for each released version.</p>

    <h2><a id="diff" name="diff">Differences from Apache for
    Windows (native)</a></h2>

    <p>Both versions, Apache for Windows and Apache for Cygwin, are
    designed to run on the same operating systems, the Windows NT
    and Windows 2000 family. But there are considerable differences
    between the two flavors.</p>

    <p>While Apache for Windows is a native Windows port, Apache
    for Cygwin relies on the Cygwin POSIX.1 emulation layer
    provided by the <code>cygwin1.dll</code> dynamic library to
    create a Unix compatible environment. Therefore we consider
    Apache for Cygwin closer to the Unix side then to the Windows
    side, even while it runs on Windows.</p>

    <p>Most significant differences are the amount of changes to
    the source code needed to compile and run Apache on the Cygwin
    platform. While the native Windows port needs major changes and
    platform specific additions, the Cygwin based port changes are
    very small and most of the Unix source code can be used without
    major changes on the Cygwin platform.</p>

    <p><strong>When to use Apache for Cygwin and/or Apache versus
    Windows?</strong><br />
     Apache for Cygwin is intended to be most useful if you want a
    seamless transition from Unix systems to Windows systems for
    your HTTP services.</p>

    <p>If you are using Windows NT or Windows 2000 for development
    and office purposes, but your productive HTTP server
    environments are Unix based systems, you may use Apache for
    Cygwin to develop on Windows and simply copy whole Apache
    configurations (<em>i.e.,</em> <code>httpd.conf</code>) and
    Perl (<code>mod_perl</code>), PHP (<code>mod_php</code>) or
    Python (<code>mod_snake</code>) applications to your productive
    Unix systems.</p>

    <p><strong>What about modules (<code>mod_foo</code>) for Apache
    for Cygwin?</strong><br />
     Apache for Cygwin can be built with most of the available
    Apache modules with no or minimal changes. Many popular modules
    have been compiled and tested with Apache for Cygwin, including
    <code>mod_dav</code>, <code>mod_ssl</code>,
    <code>mod_php</code>, <code>mod_perl</code>,
    <code>mod_gzip</code>, and <code>mod_jserv</code>.</p>

    <p>While there are developers who directly support the Windows
    native port of Apache, very few module developers do. That is
    why it is can be difficult to make a Unix-based Apache
    installation with third-party modules work the same way on the
    Windows side using the native port. Apache for Cygwin makes
    this much easier.</p>

    <p><strong>What are the differences in the configuration
    files?</strong><br />
     While the Apache for Windows port uses Windows native path
    names to refer files and directorys, like</p>
<pre>
  # httpd.conf (for Windows)
  DocumentRoot "c:/apache/htdocs"
</pre>
    Apache for Cygwin can use unmodified POSIX style path names
    like 
<pre>
  # httpd.conf (for Cygwin)
  DocumentRoot "/usr/local/apache/htdocs"
</pre>

    <p><strong>What about performance?</strong><br />
     Apache for Cygwin is not as high-performance as Apache for
    Windows on the same hardware.</p>

    <p>This is to be expected, because Cygwin emulates a Unix
    environment on a "foreign" operating system, while Apache for
    Windows uses Windows code in its own native environment. First
    benchmark results have shown that Apache for Cygwin is about
    30% slower than native Apache for Windows counterpart.</p>

    <h2><a id="req" name="req">Requirements</a></h2>

    <p>This Apache 1.3 port for Cygwin is designed to run on
    Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000, <strong>NOT</strong> on
    Windows 95 or 98. Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 have both
    been successfully tested and approved. In all cases TCP/IP
    networking must be installed.</p>

    <p>Cygwin 1.x is required to compile and run this version.
    Cygwin 1.1.8 and 1.3.2 have been tested and approved on both
    supported OSes.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong>If you want to compile shared DLL
    modules using <a
    href="programs/apxs.html"><code>apxs</code></a> you will need a
    patched version of <code>ld.exe</code> with
    <code>--auto-import</code> support, which can be found at <a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/kde-cygwin/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/kde-cygwin/</a>.</p>

    <h2><a id="down" name="down">Downloading Apache for
    Cygwin</a></h2>

    <p>The Cygwin platform is supported out of the box by Apache
    1.3.20 and later. This means there is no extra download
    required for the Cygwin platform. The latest version of Apache
    can be found on the Apache httpd web site at <a
    href="http://httpd.apache.org/">http://httpd.apache.org/</a>.
    The site lists the current release, any more recent development
    versions, and information on any mirror sites.</p>

    <h2><a id="inst" name="inst">Configuring and Installing Apache
    for Cygwin</a></h2>

    <p>Apache on Cygwin is configured and compiled the same way as
    on Unix systems. Refer to the general <a
    href="configuring.html">configuration</a> and <a
    href="install.html">installation</a> documents for details.</p>

    <p>There are three ways to configure and build Apache for
    Cygwin, depending on how additional Apache modules should be
    used:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Static linked version</strong> 

        <p>To build a static linked version of <code>httpd</code>
        including additional modules, use the following commands in
        the shell:</p>
<pre>
  $ cd apache_1.3.x
  $ ./configure [--enable-module=<i>module</i>|--add-module=<i>/path/to/module</i>]
  $ make
</pre>

        <p>This will produce the required extra libraries or object
        files for <i>module</i> and link everything to
        <code>src/httpd.exe</code>.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Shared core, DLL linked version ('one-for-all'
        version)</strong> 

        <p>To build a DLL version of <code>httpd</code> including
        additional modules, use the following commands:</p>
<pre>
  $ cd apache_1.3.x
  $ ./configure --enable-rule=SHARED_CORE \
       [--enable-module=<i>module</i>|--add-module=<i>/path/to/module</i>]
  $ make
  $ make install
</pre>

        <p>This will produce the required extra libraries or object
        files which hold all static linked code. Then
        <code>dllwrap</code> and <code>dlltool</code> will export
        all of those (including any additional module code) to the
        shared <code>libhttpd.dll</code> and create the
        <code>libhttpd.a</code> import library which is required
        for linking <code>httpd.exe</code>.</p>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> After <code>make install</code>
        is performed you will find the resulting core DLL module
        <code>libhttpd.dll</code> within
        <code>/usr/local/apache/libexec</code>. This is due to the
        installation process. Please move the file to Apache's
        <code>bin</code> directory, i.e.</p>
<pre>
  $ mv /usr/local/apache/libexec/libhttpd.dll /usr/local/apache/bin
</pre>
        The core DLL module <code>libhttpd.dll</code> is the
        <i>only</i> file that should reside in
        <code>/usr/local/apache/bin</code> directory. All other
        shared DLL modules <code>mod_foo.dll</code> should be
        located in <code>/usr/local/apache/libexec</code>.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Shared DLL modules linked version</strong> 

        <p>This method is currently <strong>ONLY</strong> supported
        using a patched version of <code>ld.exe</code> which
        support the <code>--auto-import</code> option. Please see
        the <a href="#req">requirements</a> section for where to
        get that version.</p>

        <p>To build a dynamic loadable DLL version of
        <code>httpd</code> which can load DLL modules on the fly
        (at runtime), proceed as follows:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>First build Apache's shared core as follows:</p>
<pre>
  $ cd apache_1.3.x
  $ ./configure --enable-rule=SHARED_CORE --enable-module=so \
       [--enable-module=<i>module</i>|--add-module=<i>/path/to/module</i>] \
       [--enable-shared=<i>module</i>]
  $ make
</pre>

            <p>You will notice that there is a warning message
            shown which lets you know that the shared core DLL
            library <code>src/libhttpd.dll</code> is missing while
            trying to link the shared DLL modules
            <code>mod_foo.dll</code>.</p>

            <p>Unfortunatly while Apache's build process the shared
            modules are linked before the shared core import
            library <code>src/libhttpd.dll</code> has been made.
            The shared modules depend on this import library, so
            they can not link for the first time you run
            <code>make</code>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            Re-run <code>make</code> to build the shared module
            DLLs and install the whole package to the installation
            directory: 
<pre>
  $ make
  $ make install
</pre>

            <p>All shared modules are placed into
            <code>libexec</code>, including the shared core DLL
            <code>libhttpd.dll</code>. When Apache's
            <code>/bin/httpd</code> is started it has to dynamicly
            link <code>libhttpd.dll</code> while runtime. That is
            why you have to place the shared core DLL
            <code>libhttpd.dll</code> to the same direcotry where
            <code>httpd.exe</code> resides, i.e.
            <code>/usr/local/apache/bin</code>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            Add configuration directives to
            <code>conf/httpd.conf</code> to load and activate
            shared DLL modules at runtime: 
<pre>
  # httpd.conf
  [...]
  LoadModule foo_module   libexec/mod_foo.dll
  AddModule mod_foo.c
  [...]
</pre>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Using apxs to create shared DLL modules</strong> 

        <p>To make the extending <code>httpd</code> with shared DLL
        modules easier, you can use <a
        href="programs/apxs.html"><code>apxs</code></a>.</p>

        <p>Make sure you have configured
        <code>$CFG_LDFLAGS_SHLIB</code> within <code>apxs</code> to
        include the <code>--shared</code> directive and the path to
        the shared code DLL <code>libhttpd.dll</code>.</p>

        <p>After performing <code>make install</code> you will
        probably have the following lines within your
        <code>apxs</code>:</p>
<pre>
  # apxs
  [...]
  my $CFG_LD_SHLIB      = q(dllwrap --export-all --output-def libhttpd.def --implib libhttpd.a --driver-name gcc);          # substituted via Makefile.tmpl
  my $CFG_LDFLAGS_SHLIB = q(-g); # substituted via Makefile.tmpl 
  my $CFG_LIBS_SHLIB    = q();        # substituted via Makefile.tmpl 
  [...]
</pre>
        Change these to reflect the new compile options needed for
        shared DLL modules as follows: 
<pre>
  # apxs
  [...]
  my $CFG_LD_SHLIB      = q(gcc);          # substituted via Makefile.tmpl
  my $CFG_LDFLAGS_SHLIB = q(-g --shared); # substituted via Makefile.tmpl 
  my $CFG_LIBS_SHLIB    = q(<i>/path/to/libhttpd.dll</i>);        # substituted via Makefile.tmpl 
  [...]
</pre>

        <p>Now you should be able to create a shared DLL module
        from a <code>mod_foo.c</code> source file with:</p>
<pre>
  $ apxs -c mod_foo.c -o mod_foo.dll
</pre>
        Place the resulting DLL in Apache's <code>libexec</code>
        directory, so the <code>dlopen()</code> function within the
        compiled in <code>mod_so.c</code> module can find and load
        it at runtime.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a id="run" name="run">Running Apache for Cygwin</a></h2>

    <p>Apache on Cygwin can be started and stopped in the same
    manner as on Unix systems. You may also use the <a
    href="programs/apachctl.html"><code>apachectl</code></a> tool
    for starting and stopping Apache.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Starting Apache</strong> 

        <p>If installed with the default Apache directory layout,
        you can start <code>httpd</code> as follows:</p>
<pre>
  $ /usr/local/apache/bin/httpd
</pre>

        <p>An explicit background indicator (<code>&amp;</code>) is
        not required. The parent process is automatically detached
        from the current terminal. Check the global
        <code>error_log</code> to see if Apache started cleanly
        without any major problems.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Stopping Apache</strong> 

        <p>To stop Apache send at least a <code>SIGTERM</code>
        signal to the parent <code>httpd</code> process:</p>
<pre>
  $ kill -TERM `cat /usr/local/apache/logs/httpd.pid`
</pre>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Gracefully Restarting Apache</strong> 

        <p>In order to update configuration directives and reload
        the <code>httpd.conf</code> configuration file, send a
        <code>SIGHUP</code> to the parent <code>httpd</code>
        process:</p>
<pre>
  $ kill -HUP `cat /usr/local/apache/logs/httpd.pid`
</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a id="serv" name="serv">Running Apache for Cygwin as a
    Service</a></h2>

    <p>Apache on Cygwin can be invoked as a Windows NT or Windows
    2000 service. Cygwin has its own <code>cygrunsrv.exe</code>
    facility to define, remove, start, and stop services as
    follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Installing Apache as a new Service</strong> 

        <p>Use the following statement to install
        <code>httpd.exe</code> as a new service:</p>
<pre>
  $ cygrunsrv -I <i>service_name</i>-p /usr/local/apache/bin/httpd.exe [-a <i>arguments</i>] \
      [-e <i>VAR=VALUE</i>] [-t auto|manual] [-u <i>user</i>] [-w <i>passwd</i>]
</pre>

        <p>Where <code>-a</code> is used to pass command line
        arguments (such as <code>-DFOO</code> defines) to
        <code>httpd.exe</code>, and <code>-e</code> is used to pass
        environment variables. If necessary you may use the
        <code>-t</code> options to set the autostart configuration
        for the service. If you want the new service to run under a
        different userid, you will have to supply the
        <code>-u</code> and <code>-w</code> options.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Starting Apache as a Service</strong> 

        <p>After the new service is installed it can be started
        using the following command:</p>
<pre>
  $ cygrunsrv -S <i>service_name</i>
</pre>

        <p>Check your process table and global
        <code>error_log</code> file to ensure Apache has started
        without any major problems.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Stopping an Apache Service</strong> 

        <p>A running Apache service may be stopped using the
        following command:</p>
<pre>
  $ cygrunsrv -E <i>service_name</i>
</pre>

        <p>This will stop all running <code>httpd.exe</code>
        processes and shutdown the HTTP service for the
        machine.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Removing an Apache Service</strong> 

        <p>An installed Apache service may be removed from Windows
        NT or Windows 2000 using the following command:</p>
<pre>
  $ cygrunsrv -R <i>service_name</i>
</pre>

        <p>This will remove your previously defined and installed
        service from the machine.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please refer to the <code>man</code> page for
    <code>cygrunsrv</code> and the Cygwin mailing list for further
    details of how services are invoked.</p>
