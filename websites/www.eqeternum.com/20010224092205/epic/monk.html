You are required very early on in the Quest to hand in your RotWF, but if you are 46+ and have a lot of friends or are in a guild, you will be able to take the Fists first to get the Fang, then complete the RotWF. The start of the Epic Quest originates with Tomekeeper Dahl, on the second floor within the Erudite Library.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Hail Tomekeeper Dahl'<p>

<b>Tomekeeper Danl says</b> 'Good day, citizen. Please remember to keep your voice down in our library. Feel free to browse the extensive collection of books we have on display. Learning is all about you and our library is the greatest collection of educational literature in the world, as you can no doubt see. However, there are a few books we do not own and we are prepared to pay well to acquire [rare finds].<p> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'What rare finds?'<p> 

<b>Tomekeeper Danl says</b> 'Yes, any rare books, tomes, essays, or other literature you find may be of interested to me. Although the finds I am interested in are quite high profile and would most likely only be found in the possession of very powerful or influential beings. Give me what you have found and I will pay you what it is worth to us.<p>  

Now the book he requires, is the book of Immortals, a book found in Skyfire. It drops from any of the following - 'Soul Devourer' , 'lava walker' , 'Black Scar', 'a wandering wurm', 'a Shadow Drake', 'Guardian of Felia', or any other of the named mobs there.<p> 

The following is the text from the book of Immortals:<p>

<i>The immortals who can be spoken of are not the Eternal Immortals. Their Spoken names are not the eternal names. In the namelessness they are the beginning of heaven and earth. Named they are one of the ten thousand things.<p>  

Though different in title they spring from one source and appear as darkness within darkness. The gate to their mystery. The immortals do not go forth. All comes to them. They are like the ocean, the king of ten thousand streams. By staying beneath they are a receptacle for all things. They do nothing. Yet are masters of the universe. Trorsmang! Be our course of action. Anbeal! Become the Vessel to hold our virtue. Drina! Be our stability, where we can take root. Cordan! Fill our vessels and calm our ambitions. Norrath! Take our husks and breathe life into them. We beseech you! Guide us in your humility.</i><p>  

Giving Tomekeeper Dahl the Book of Immortals, prompts the following:<p>

Tomekeeper Danl gasps at the sight of the rare book and says, 'This is a great find indeed! I can only imagine who you had to.. persuade to give you the book. Our library would be very interested in acquiring this and I am prepared to give you this platinum and a referral that marks you as a friend of the library. If only [Lheao] could see this.'<p> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Who is Lheao?'<p> 

<b>Tomekeeper Danl says</b> 'Lheao was my predecessor here at the Library of Erudin. He has since retired, just a few years ago. I'm sure he would be most impressed with your find and offer insightful conversation on the subject. Although I'm not sure one of your profession would be interested in such a scholarly endeavor, no offense. If you are interested, find him and tell him you found the book 'Immortals.' I'm not sure where he has retired to, but I hear it is near an ocean somewhere.<p> 

He gives you a piece of paper, Danl's reference, which identifies as 'Paper with the Erudin Library Seal'<p>  

Lheao is found in the Timerous Deep in the hidden oasis. The loc is approximately neg 11500, neg 2000, where you will run into a huge rock wall that is a huge ring of solid rock. There is an underwater tunnel, which goes under this wall, at approx neg 11357 neg 3657.<p>

Once through that tunnel, you surface and see another huge rock. This second huge rock has another tunnel, so you have to stay underwater, and find the tunnel that goes under it. This finally leads you to the hidden oasis, where you see the hut with the ramp and Lhaeo.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Hail Lhaeo'<p>

Lheao jumps at your voice and begins laughing at his skittishness. He says, 'Ahh, hello there. Not many people know of this place, so visitors are quite rare. Hehehe. It's a very beautiful place indeed, so, ummm, please don't go telling everyone you know about it. Heheh. Thanks, friend.'<p> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I have found the book Immortals'<p> 

Lheao looks up at you, eyes wide in astonishment, and says, 'My god, you found 'Immortals'?! Where did you find it? Never mind, that is unimportant. I have in my possession a book that explains more about these individuals. Its value is unimaginable as well as the impact it is capable of. As you can see, I grow old. I need an individual to watch over this book and make sure it is protected. Would you be willing to [take this responsibility]?'<p> 
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I will take this responsibility'<p>

<b>Lheao says</b> 'I'm sorry, Kage , but I could only give this book to a true master, such as a member of the Whistling Fists Order. And unless you can give me proof that you are one, in addition to Danl's reference, which is very unlikely, there is no way I'll let you take charge of [the Celestial Fists].<p> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'What Celestial Fists?'<p>

Once the Robe of the Whistling Fists and note (Dahl's reference) are handed in, the following is said.<p>

<b>Lheao says</b> 'Astonishing! To think that you are a master of an order thought to be lost to our world. Forgive my earlier doubts. I believe you are indeed worthy to be given the responsibility of watching over this book. Take great care that it does not fall into the wrong hands as it would be truly disastrous.<p> 

The Celestial Fists Book is illegible.<p> 

<B><FONT SIZE="3">The Kaiaren's</FONT></B><P>

The next step is someone called Kaiaren, who is located at Loc -1609, -2679, just as you come into the upper Sebilis Ruins in Trakanons Teeth.<p> 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Hail Kaiaren'<p>

<b>Kaiaren says</b>, " AHHH get it away from me go away .. leave me alone". <p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'What Celestial Fists'<p> 

<b>Kaiaren says</b> 'Eh? What's that? Bah! That was destroyed long ago. Don't waste my time with fairy taAAAAAGGHHH GET IT AWAY!!!! HELP!!! They're all over MEHEHEHEHEEEEEEee!!<p>

 
Handing Kaiaren the book Celestial Fists prompts: Kaiaren's eyes open wide and he attacks you!<p>

Upon death he says 'Not bad.. Now lets see if you can find my trueform if you do we discuss this further.'<p>

Note: You do not need to kill Kaiaren, as giving him the book and feigning him off works fine.<p> 

The next step is to find Kaiaren's true form, which spawns when the book is given to the mad Kaiaren. He is also called Kaiaren, and is located near the lake in Trakanons Teeth. He spawns at approx 300, 2400 in a building next to the lake. He is level 60+ and indifferent.<p> 

When you hand him the book, he says the following:<p>

Important Note: The Book is returned to you, but it is NOT the same. The properties of this book have now been changed, and although you cannot tell, it is different. Please do not hand this book over again until the final stage.<p>

<b>Kaiaren says</b> 'Now, then. Where did you find this, monk? This is not just some light reading to be borrowed from the town library. Who gave this to you?<p> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I got it from lheao'<p> 

<b>Kaiaren says</b> 'Hmmm, never heard of him. Well, it doesn't matter, the book is here now. Curse that idiot for writing it in the first place. Not even sure why I let him stick around. If you ever see that clown monk Aradiel kick him in the shins for me! At any rate, I suppose you'd like to find the Fists and [have a nice chat with them], eh? Their master owes me much. I would reward you well if you were to bring me proof of the master's defeat'<p> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I would like to have a nice chat with them'<p> 
 
<b>Kaiaren says</b> 'Yes, I suppose you would. All you children looking for fame and glory will eventually learn the poison of ambition. But how will you find them? They are able to meld with their elements seamlessly and they certainly have no interest in fooling with the likes of you. No, you will need to get their attention. Fortunately, I know [how you can do this].<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'how can I do this?'<p> 

<b>Kaiaren says</b>, 'My guess is that the weakest of the Fists will be the easiest to draw out. he is egotistical and arrogant. How he came to master the Discipline of Fire, I do not know. He will most likely be in another form, one of his element. When you find the one you believe to be the Fist, you must challenge him. If you use his true name, Eejag, in your formal challenge, he will respond. A flame can burn intensely but it cannot last for long. Know this when you battle him.<p> 

<B>Eejag</B><P>

In Lavastorm, there is an wandering Imp, larger than the others, called 'a fire Sprite'. The sprite looks to be pretty common and seems to travel from the druid ring to the southeast and back again. He is also a very low lvl imp. If Eejag is already spawned he won't shout to the zone when you say the challenge to the sprite. To initiate the sequence, hail the Fire Sprite with:<p> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I Challenge Eejag'<p> 

The fire sprite disappears and the zone gets a message...<p> 

Eejag shouts What imbecile dares challenges a Celestial Fist?! Do you even know who you are challenging? HA! You are nothing but an insect! I will enjoy crushing you, I have not charred the flesh of an idiot in decades! If you truly wish to fight me, the battle shall be held in my own element. Come, challenger, come down to the pits of flowing fire.<p>  

Now go to the fire pit by the Solesek's and under the middle smoke plume, half way down an Iksar will be swimming. He is lvl 55, max hits for 157, but seems to swing very slow. Eejag will NOT be pulled. He refuses to move from his spawn spot, which is about half way down the lava, right in the middle. When you get summoned, you appear on the bottom of the lake directly beneath him, where he can hit you, but you cant hit him. He can summon you regardless of if you are in the lava or not. Visibility is VERY bad.<p>

<i>Tactics:</i> Min 2 Groups, and buff everyone with Dead Man Floating, Enduring Breath and Regen. One person goes down and gets the target then comes back up. Everyone charges in, including the Clerics, so they could do group heals, as the lava does not interrupt spells. Everyone then assists the person with target and find him via the /yell command.<p>

Other tactics involve all floating above him, and sending the tanks and caster pets in, and popping back up to the surface to the Clerics for heals.<p> 

Once killed, he drops nothing but the Charred Scale, which Identifies as the Remains of the Fists of Fire.<p> 

<i>Note:</i> Eejag can be summoned again immediatly after death by challenging the Fire Sprite again, there is no 'respawn time'.<p>

You then hand the Charred Scale to the True Form in Trakanon's Teeth. The scale is returned to you, and you get the following:<p> 

<b>Kaiaren says</b> 'Ahhh, impressive indeed! Now that you have broken the chain of the Fists, the others may come toppling down if you persevere. The Fist of Air is now the weakest, then Earth, and finally Water before the master of them all, Vorash. You must defeat them in order, proving the demise of the last to draw out the one you are after. The task before you now is to take this scale and show it to the Fist of Air wherever he may be. Good luck, Zadkiel .<p> 

<B>Gwan</B><P>

A presence, is found in the Plane of Sky, and is the Place Holder for the Fist of Air. The presence seems to have a respawn time of approx 2 hours. He has the model of a shadowed man, but carries no items, so is invisible apart from his name.<p>

<i>Note:</i> The Charred Scale does not have to be cycled through Kaiaren's true form before being given to 'a presence', so this part can be skipped, but it is advisable to follow the story as intended.<p>

If you travel to sky, rather than paying for the keys, kill the fairies, and have everyone loot a miniature sword. If you then kill the thunder spirit princess, she will spawn Sirran the lunatic. When everyone hands in the mini swords, you get a key of swords back. As with many guides on Sky, do not speak, (use /ooc instead) as if anyone says the key word [hassle] he will despawn. It is advisable not to buff people up until you are in sky, as zoning up removes all buffs. Now find the 'soapdish ashtray key platform thing' {Hotrod's term, not mine}, and drop the key on to use it, and it takes you to Dojorn isle, where the presence and Gwan are.<p>

Hand the Presence the scale for the following:<p>

<b>a presence says</b> 'Hahaha! That dolt Eejag fell to the likes of you? I'm not surprised. So, I guess this means you're here to challenge me. Normally, I wouldn't waste my time, but since you've defeated my younger brother, I suppose I'm obligated. I'm ready when you are, tell me when you're [prepared].<p> 

At this point the presence despawns and immediately respawns in the same location as a Human monk dressed in shiverback named Gwan. Telling him 'I am prepared' causes him to attack.<p> 

He doesn't respond to hails, and is lvl 57. He procs Fist of Air, which a lvl 57 resisted every proc with a MR of 120.<p> 

He has approx 8khp, hits for 165, and the Fist of Air proc can knock you backwards, and like other mobs of this level, enrages.<p>

Upon death, Gwan's corpse lets out one last, frustrated breath and gasps, 'Trunt! Prepare yourself!'<p>

 

<i>Tactics:</i> The 'a presence' is on Dojorn's island, and has the look of a shadowed man. Dojorn and the bladestorms, also on the island, have been confirmed that they will not attack and help, or KS Gwan.<p>

You cannot trade (i.e. give him the scale from Eejag,) with the presence while it is in the windmill. Give the scale to a presence, Gwan will spawn, then pull him into the windmill and kill him. Pulling him is recommended to be done while in Melee range, i.e. walking backwards with him. Running off will cause him to path incorrectly, and disappear to another island. It is highly recommended to pull him into the Windmill.<p>

It is possible for 6 people to kill Gwan (although it is recommend to have more, the original group was high 50's-60th lvl). Gwan is 100% MR, and only the lure line spells seem to hit him. He also required melee range for even Lure line to stick.<p> 

He drops nothing but the Breath of Gwan, which id's as Item Lore: Remains of the Fist of Air.<p> 

<i>Important Note:</i> Do not hand the The Breath of Gwan to the true form of Kaiaren, as it will be eaten. The Breath is required for the next step, Trunt.<p>

<B>Trunt</B><P> 

Within the mines of Nurga, which is located in the Frontier Mountains, there is 'a sleeping Ogre', near a number of spiders not too far into the dungeon. A good marker is a unique graphic to this dungeon, which is a smoking hole in the wall, where you can see lava. When he is spawned he is looking right at that crevice in the wall. The Sleeping Ogres respawn time is approx 1 hour 45 mins.<p> 

He is KOS, and he says nothing except some kind of sleeping message when you hail him while charmed. Turning in the breath of Gwan spawns Trunt, which is done by sneaking behind him, or charming him, and gets this response:<p>

<b>a sleeping ogre says</b> 'Your path of wanton destruction ends here, Southern . Gwan and Eejag were impatient and hot-headed. You will not defeat me, for I have the patience and perseverance of stone, unlike the children you have beaten before me. Are you sure you want to challenge me, Southern?<p>  

When answering the Sleeping Ogre, Trunt, who is KOS, spawns. He is around 59th level Ogre, who double hits for around 176, has alot of HP, possibly more than the 8k of Gwan, and is also immune to magic. He also attacks faster than the others.<p>

Trunt has no faction, and says no message when he dies. He drops nothing but the Head.<p>

Trunts Head identifies as Remains of the fist of earth.<p> 

<B>Deep</B><P> 

The next of the Celestial Fists is Deep. She is approx a level 58 Dark Elf, and lives under Lake Rathe, and is surrounded by Bloodgill Goblins. Her location is under the 3 Bird platform (the one with the flame on it).<p>

When Trunts head is handed to her, she says the following.<p>

Deep slowly opens her eyes and looks up at you. She stares at you a long while and then closes her eyes and lowers her head again, saying, 'Very well, Arakos, if you wish death so greatly, we will be happy to oblige. My master projects part of himself in the wilder lands known as the Overthere. He has granted you an audience. Find him and show him the head of our earth brother. At that point, we will discuss how we will end your life.<p> 

No Experience is received and Deep despawns immediately. You get the Head of Trunt handed back.<p> 
 

<i>Note:</i> Trunts Head does not have to be cycled through Deep, and this part can be skipped, but as mentioned above, it is advisable to follow the story as intended.<p>

<B>Astral Projections</B><P> 

Moving on, we have the Astral Projections. There is one in the Overthere, and one in the Lake of Ill Omen, with the Overthere Astral Projection being the first of the two. He is approx 52nd level, and if fought was hitting for 175 damage, and says nothing on death. His approximate location is 772, 860, neg 494, and is in the bottom of the scorpion chasm. He does not need to be fought.<p>

Handing the Projection Trunts head, results in the following:<p> 

Astral Projection looks up and down and says, 'Hmmm, I was hoping for something more impressive. This is just a small token of the last person who tried to interfere with my plans. He failed as you shall. But tell me truly, are you the one who has so rudely removed my students?'<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'yes'<p> 

Astral Projection says 'I assume you have read about us and spoken with the old man, Kaiaren. Since that time, I have grown in power and influence to a point unseen by any mortal. Unfortunately, I will have to demonstrate a small amount of my skill when I destroy you. This is bad. I must decide whether you are worthy to see the techniques I wield, even though you will die shortly thereafter. Tell me, Ashana , who are you?'<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I am the one'<p> 

Astral Projection chuckles and says, 'That's quite a boast, Ashana. All beings strive for nothingness at the most basic level of sentience. However, almost none ever achieve this. Not even I have discarded my ego yet and you stand here and tell me you have? Perhaps you will be a worthy opponent. I shall be waiting in the great lake near here. Take that token as proof of things to come for you. If you still wish to throw your life away so needlessly, return it to my image there. I await your decision.'<p> 

He will give you an Eye of Kaiaren, and then the Astral Projection despawns.<p>

He is a 3 hour spawn.<p>  

It is not sure where in the text the Eye of Kaiaren is given, and it is only the final text (telling him that 'I am the one') that despawns the Projection. So it is possible to give in Trunts head, receive the eye and leave the AP without despawning him.<p> 

<i>Note:</i> As with the previous warnings, for the sake of someone else waiting 3 hours for the respawn, I would despawn the projection. There were (prior to a recent patch) chances that Deep would spawn in the LoIO alone, without Vorash, so anything to minimize that chance is helpful.<p>

<B>The Final Fight</B><P>

The second of the Astral Projections is in the Lake of Ill Omen, and is on a platform on the lake itself. The Platform is too high to climb onto, but SoW and Levitation can get you up there. He is identical in appearance to the other Projection.<p> 

<i>Note:</i> Another way to minimize the chances of Vorash and Deep not spawning together, is to have your groups on the edges of the platform, and hand the 'eye' in at the maximum distance allowed for trading. You can never be too careful.<p>

When you give the Eye of Kaiaren to the Astral Projection, he despawns immediatly, and Deep and Vorash both spawn, who are KOS.<p>

Deep procs Fist of Water, and hits for 170ish. Vorash procs Fist of Mastery, which is a DD and a stun, and hits for around the same as Deep.<p>

Both Deep and Vorash have no items.<p>

Once killed, Vorash says 'Foolish mortal! You think you have defeated me? Now, witness the true power of Rallos Zek!<p>   

Xenevorash will then spawn on the platform, regardless of where Vorash dies.<p>

 
Xenovorash Procs Fist of Sentience which is a 500DD and a stun, and hits for 250 ish.<p>

Once he is killed, his death message is:<p> 

Xenevorash's corpse shouts 'Grraaaagghhhh!! NOT.. POSSIBLE!<p> 

He drops a Demon's Fang.<p> 
 

<i>Tactics:</i> The final battle was done with 4 groups, which where all 52 to 58th level, one group was on Deep, all with high CR, and 3 groups where all on Vorash, with high MR. Due to the large amount of people involved, the fight was not bad, with no casualties.<p> 

Some groups pull Deep and Vorash to the 'beach', and this is normally done by a Bard or Druid with a faster than SoW song/spell, but this is not nescesary, and the fight can easily be done on the platform.<p>

Xenevorash always runs on low health, so if fighting on the platform, he will run into the water.<p> 

<B>The Celestial Fists</B><P> 

Please remember that the book needed to be handed to the True Form first, for you to receive the quest information in the first place, (as in he prompts you to look for Eejag.) Once this (now different) book has been returned to you, it is now ready to be handed to Kaiaren along with the Fang.<p> 

Handing the True Form of Kaiaren the Book and the Fang, results in the Celestial Fists being handed over, with the following text.<p>

Kaiaren bows his head and breathes a long sigh as if relived of a great weight. He then looks up at you and says, 'I honestly did not believe you could have defeated Vorash. Even though he sought nothing but war and bloodshed, it is a life nonetheless and we must mourn him. I will sew these fangs into magical fist wraps and they shall be yours. Remember Xenevorash. A purpose can be found for every situation and individual. To achieve perfection is to perceive this truth.'<p>
