Kill Lord Bergurgle, then turn in his "Lord Bergurgle's Crown" to Shmendrik Lavawalker. Natasha Whitewater will attack him immediately after spawning. When he dies, kill the resulting "spirit of flame" spawn. Loot the "Damaged Goblin Crown" and give it to Natasha Whitewater, for which you receive "Ornate Sea Shell (I)" She despawns after receiving "Damaged Goblin Crown". Turn in "Ornate Sea Shell (I)" to Omat Vastsea and receive "Coral Statue of Tarew" in return. Give "Coral Statue of Tarew" to a certain "seeker" and kill the resulting "Plasmatic Priest" spawn, looting a "Blood Soaked Plasmatic Priest Robe". Kill Lord Gimblox and loot "Lord Gimblox's Signet Ring". Turn in the "Blood Soaked Plasmatic Priest Robe" to Omat Vastsea, receiving "Orb of Frozen Water", and Natasha Whitewater will spawn.<p>

<B>NPC: Shmendrik Lavawalker</B><P> 


<i>Location:</i> Lake Rathetear, loc (3600, 0).<p> 

<i>Spawn Timer:</i> Approx. 3 hours (+/- 15 minutes, I thought he showed up 15 minutes early)<p> 

<i>Level:</i> 30<p>

<i>Hit Points:</i> Approx. 1494<p>

<i>Melee Damage:</i> Very low (2-20)<p> 

<i>Spells Cast:</i> Cancel Magic, Smite, Greater Healing<p> 

<i>Accepts Items:</i> "Lord Bergurgle's Crown", results in "Oil of Fennin Ro" and Natasha Whitewater spawns<p>

<i>Drops:</i> Plasmatic Priest Robe (cannot be equipped)<p>

<i>Spoken Text:</i> (when hailed) Shmendrik Lavawalker says 'Hail, good [your name] !! Be wary near the waters of Lake Rathe! The Riptide goblin king, Lord Bergurgle has been commanding his minions to murder and rob all who come near it! I am here seeking his death but I am afraid I am no match for all of his subjects. I shall reward you greatly for the death of Lord Bergurgle. I simply ask that you bring me his crown as proof.<p> 

(when attacked) Shmendrik Lavawalker says 'I shall sear the flesh from your bones and your soul shall be carried to oblivion by my flames!<p> 

(when given "Lord Bergurgle's Crown") Shmendrik Lavawalker shoves the crown into a scorch marked leather satchel and cackles uncontrollably as madness twists his features and flames dance in his eyes. You [your name] have reduced the Riptides into chaos! Without a king to keep them in control they will ravage the settlements surrounding this lake! After the slaughter I shall return and easily burn the remainder of the villages and fishing shanties to the ground! None shall escape the fires of the Tyrant!!<p>

<B>NPC: A Spirit of Flame</B><P>

<i>Location:</i> Lake Rathetear<p> 

<i>Spawn Timer:</i> Spawns immediately in place when Shmendrik Lavawalker dies<p> 

<i>Level:</i> 40<p> 

<i>Hit Points:</i> Approx. 3300<p> 

<i>Melee Damage:</i> Moderate (up to 97)<p> 

<i>Spells Cast:</i> None, no native damage shield<p> 

<i>Drops:</i> Damaged Goblin Crown<p> 

<i>Tactics:</i> Natasha Whitewater will attack the Spirit of Flame, which may in some cases cause its corpse to disappear. It may be possible to keep her out of the fight using root, mesmerize, atone, or something similar, but the safest way to do the quest is to kill Shmendrik Lavawalker and the Spirit of Flame once to get the Damaged Goblin Crown, then wait for a second Shmendrik spawn to turn in Bergurgle's crown and complete this part of the quest.<p>

<B>NPC: Lord Bergurgle</B><P>

<i>Location:</i> Lake Rathetear, loc (2800, 150) in underwater cave. Cave entrance loc is (2831, -912, -221).<p>

<i>Spawn Timer:</i> Rare spawn with placeholder and 28 minute spawn timer. Surrounding DW goblins are on 6 minute timer. "Deep", a level 60 mob (beta neutral faction), can spawn in the tower nearby.<p> 

<i>Level:</i> 39-40<p> 

<i>Hit Points:</i> Unknown but substantial for his level<p> 

<i>Melee Damage:</i> Moderate (approximate max. 97)<p> 

<i>Spells Cast:</i> Complete Heal<p> 

<i>Drops:</i> Lord Bergurgle's Crown<p>

<B>NPC: Natasha Whitewater</B><P>

<i>Location:</i> Lake Rathetear, spawns when Lord Bergurgle's Crown is given to Shmendrik Lavawalker.<p> 

<i>Accepts Items:</i> "Damaged Goblin Crown", results in "Ornate Sea Shell (I)" (actual item name is "Ornate Sea Shell", identifies as "Ornate Sea Shell", referred to herein as "Ornate Sea Shell (I)"), then Natasha despawns.<p> 

<i>Spoken Text:</i> (when spawned) Natasha Whitewater shouts, 'The Triumvirate of Water has decreed your fate, Shmendrik Lavawalker!! I am here to deliver said fate!!'<p> 

Shmendrik Lavawalker says, 'I'll slay you like I slaughtered your fellow missionaries! The Triumvirate can not decide the fate of a follower of the Tyrant!!<p> 

Natasha Whitewater says, 'Enough!! Your existence has come to an end!<p> 

Natasha Whitewater says 'This conflict has been destined by the waters of the Triumvirate!<p> 

(when hailed) Natasha Whitewater says 'The Riptide goblins must have their crown returned to them. If you would be so kind as to give me the crown I will make sure that it reaches them. Hopefully they are capable enough to repair the damage that has been done to it.'<p> 

(when given the crown) Natasha Whitewater says 'I will have this crown returned to the Riptide Goblins immediately! Should you ever come across an Erudite named Omat Vastsea, give him this sea shell. The waters of Norrath shimmer with awareness of your deeds here today!<p>

<B>NPC: Omat Vastsea</B><P>

<i>Location:</i> Timourous Deep, loc (-11567, -2227). To reach him, take the cave entrance at loc (-11530, -3728), then the entrance at (-11336, -1307).<p> 

<i>Accepts Item:</i> "Ornate Sea Shell (I)", results in "Coral Statue of Tarew". "Blood Soaked Plasmatic Priest Robe" results in "Orb of Frozen Water" and Natasha Whitewater spawns.<p> 

<i>Spoken Text:</i> (when hailed) Omat Vastsea bows deeply. 'I have been expecting you, [your name] . The waters have foretold your arrival. I am High Priest Omat Vastsea of the Triumvirate missionaries. Please feel free to enjoy the quiet solitude of this inn.'<p> 

You say, 'who are the triumvirate'<p> 

Omat Vastsea says 'The Triumvirate of Water are: E'ci, the mistress of ice; Tarew Marr, the lord of water; and Povar, the formless master of vapor and mist. We Triumvirate missionaries are granted great divinatory powers and wisdom through our devotion to the Triumvirate and must defend the waters of Norrath from the ravages of the Tyrant of Fire, Fennin Ro.<p> 

You say, 'who is fennin ro'<p> 

Omat Vastsea says 'The Tyrant of Fire, Fennin Ro, is the merciless lord of fire in all its forms. The rivalry between the tyrant and the Triumvirate is as old as the gods themselves and is an eternal battle. We witness the struggle every moment of our lives as the Oasis of Marr succumbs to the heat of the surrounding desert and is replenished by the swelling of the Lifire River. That fragile balance between the elements must be maintained but the Plasmatic Priesthood threatens that balance.<p> 

You say, 'who are the plasmatic priesthood'<p> 

Omat Vastsea says 'The Plasmatic Priesthood are worshipers of the Tyrant of Fire, but they have been driven mad by their fanaticism and have forgotten the importance of the balance. In their madness they would set the whole world aflame, leaving nothing but lifeless ash.<p> 

(after turning in the shell) Omat Vastsea says 'So, you are a friend of Natasha's? That is good to see. She is a very wise and gifted woman. The Riptide goblins have adopted a new king but are still in a vulnerable state until his subjects accept his rule. The Plasmatic Priesthood is aware of the weakened state of the Riptides and has convinced the Fire Peak goblins to strike against them. Although I do not agree with the mannerisms or actions of any goblin clan, such a war would be detrimental to all who are caught in its path. Lord Gimblox of the Fire Peak clan has been meeting with a member of the Plasmatic Priesthood in the Temple of Solusek Ro. Locate the Plasmatic Priest, hand him this statue to hinder his powers, then eliminate him and bring me his robe.<p> 

(after turning in the "Blood Soaked Plasmatic Priest Robe") "You have proven yourself to be one who is willing to take responsibility for his own actions. Such a trait is desired by all deities to be present in their faithful. I pray that you had the wisdom to slay Lord Gimblox as well as the Plasmatic Priest in order to prevent further advancement in the incursion against the Riptides. Priestess Natasha awaits inside the inn for Lord Gimblox's ring, make haste for she is a busy women and will depart soon"<p> 

<B>NPC: "A Seeker"/Plasmatic Priest</B><P>

<i>Location:</i> Temple of Solusek Ro, loc (326,38,29).<p> 

<i>Spawn Timer:</i> Spawns at 9am, despawns at 9pm (game time).<p> 

<i>Level:</i> 55<p> 

<i>Hit Points:</i> Approx. 3000-3500<p> 

<i>Melee Damage:</i> High (maximum 150)<p> 

<i>Spells Cast:</i> Complete Heal, Tremor, Annul Magic, Reckoning<p> 

<i>Accepts Item:</i> "Coral Statue of Tarew", changes into "Plasmatic Priest" and attacks immediately.<p> 

<i>Drops:</i> Blood Soaked Plasmatic Priest Robe, Darkwood Staff<p> 

<i>Spoken Text:</i> You say, 'what solusek ro'<p> 

a seeker says 'Solusek Ro is the Master of Fire and the Keeper of Power.<p> 

You say, 'what plasmatic priest'<p> 

a seeker says 'You speak of things that should not be spoken! It would be in your best interest to leave this temple at once and return to lands less consumed by flame!<p> 

(when given "Coral Statue of Tarew") A seeker shakes violently as his hand closes on the coral statue and flames dance in the depths of his eyes! The statue begins to emit a reddish glow then shatters in a burst of fire and smoke! The flames in the plasmatic priest's eyes vanish with the explosion and only madness remains! 'The Triumvirate thinks that destroying my spirit of flame will stop me?!! I will kill you all now, the goblins will continue to war, and when my spirit is restored I will ensure that Ixiblat Fer consumes all of Norrath in his flames!!'<p> 

<i>Tactics:</i> AE Tremor spell can aggro surrounding temple mobs on him. If they get the kill, you lose the corpse and have to start over. Pulling him to the zone after turning in the statue is one way to avoid this result. He summons, so be sure not to damage him until you reach the zone. If you jump down from the upper level on the way to the zone, he has been observed to teleport directly to your group. Another potential way to manage the situation is to use Atone or another memory wipe spell to clear aggro on the mobs. Appears to be impervious to stun.<p> 

<B>NPC: Lord Gimblox</B><P>

<i>Location:</i> Solusek A, loc (-796, -366)<p> 

<i>Spawn Timer:</i> Rare spawn, 19 minute timer, placeholder is a "Large Fire Goblin" or "fire goblin shaman". Clearing surrounding king/torturer spawn areas MAY increase spawn rate by some reports, though it is more likely to be strictly random.<p> 

<i>Level:</i> 30<p> 

<i>Hit Points:</i> Approx. 1800<p> 

<i>Melee Damage:</i> Moderate (approximate max. 76)<p> 

<i>Drops:</i> Lord Gimblox's Signet Ring<p>

<B><FONT SIZE="3">Step Two: Obtain the Orb of Clear Water</FONT></B><P>

Immediately after completing the previous step, turn in "Lord Gimblox's Signet Ring" to Natasha and receive the "Ornate Sea Shell (II)". Turn in the "Ornate Sea Shell (II)" to Naxot Deepwater, receive "Message to Natasha" and kill Ixiblat Fer, looting "Sceptre of Ixiblat Fer". Kill Overking Bathezid Di'Zok, looting "Singed Scroll". Turn in "Sceptre of Ixiblat Fer" and "Singed Scroll" to Omat Vastsea, receiving "Orb of Clear Water" and causing Natasha Whitewater to spawn.<p>

<B>NPC: Natasha Whitewater</B><P>

<i>Location:</i> Timorous Deep, near Omat Vastsea.<p> 

<i>Spawn Timer:</i> Spawned when "Blood Soaked Plasmatic Priest Robe" is given to Omat Vastsea.<p> 

<i>Accepts Item:</i> "Lord Gimblox's Signet Ring", results in "Ornate Sea Shell (II)" (actual item name is "Ornate Sea Shell", identifies as "Ornate Sea Shell II", referred to herein as "Ornate Sea Shell (II)")<p> 

<i>Spoken Text:</i> (after turning in "Lord Gimblox's Signet Ring") "Thank you, [your name] , for your services thus far. The Triumvirate missionaries are, so far, impressed. However, there is yet another threat rising from the Plasmatic Priesthood that may have dire effects on all of Norrath if it is not stopped. An Iksar member of the Triumvirate missionaries has discovered that the Plasmatic Priesthood has somehow convinced the sarnak summoners of Chardok to assit them in summoning Ixilblat Fer to Norrath. Take this shell to Naxton Deepwater in the Burning Woods so that she knows I have sent you. We ask that you return with the Sceptre of Ixiblat Fer as well as evidence to show that the Plasmatic Priesthood is dealing with sarnaks. High Priest Omat will await your return. I Must depart now. I pray for your success."<p>

<B>NPC: Naxot Deepwater</B><P>

<i>Location:</i> Burning Woods, approx. loc (3400, -2150).<p> 

<i>Spawn Timer:</i> Spawns at 6pm, despawns at 6am.<p> 

<i>Accepts Item:</i> "Ornate Sea Shell (II)", spawns Ixiblat Fer and returns "Message to Natasha", an unreadable note. She will charge Ixiblat Fer and suicide if you do not keep her from doing so. If she is still alive after Ixiblat Fer dies, you can respawn it right away if you have another person waiting with an "Ornate Sea Shell (II)".<p> 

<i>Drops:</i> Triumvirate Missionary Robe (this item is now NORENT as well)<p> 

<i>Spoken Text:</i> (when hailed) "Beware these woods! The sarnak claim this land as their own and wicked creatures walk beneath the burning foliage."<p> 

(after turning in "Ornate Sea Shell (II)") "Praise the Triumvirate! Natasha sent you just in time! Those twisted sarnak summoners are summoning Ixiblat Fer as we speak! We must stop Ixiblat Fer while he is still weak or all of Norrath may be set aflame! Please do me one more favor, should I perish to this beast of fire. Give this note to Natasha when you next see her, and if you should perish and I survive, I will make sure the waters never forget your reflections of your deeds this day."<p>

<B>NPC: Ixiblat Fer</B><P>

<i>Location:</i> Burning Woods, loc (-2000, 1500)<p> 

<i>Level:</i> 62<p> 

<i>Hit Points:</i> Approx. 32000<p> 

<i>Melee Damage:</i> Godly (Max 575)<p> 

<i>Spells Cast:</i> AE Fire (300 pt dd, same as Noble Djorn/Overseer of Air, resistible)<p> 

<i>Drops:</i> (always) Sceptre of Ixiblat Fer (plus one of) Circlet of Fire, Mantle of Fire, Gloves of Fire, Belt of Fire, Cloak of Flames<p> 

<i>Tactics:</i> This is a high level (52+), multi-group (24-30 person) encounter. Most people pull him to the Skyfire zone before fighting, and report that he follows pullers reliably without aggroing additional mobs. His magic resistance is reportedly average to below average for his level, and he is NOT immune to fire-based spells. Mage fire pets will be immune to his AE fire proc, however. He will attempt to flee when low on health, and he apparently has a high regen rate which will take effect near the end of the fight if he is not finished quickly. Slowing/debuffing him is highly recommended.<p>

<B>NPC: Overking Bathezid Di'Zok</B><P>

<i>Location:</i> Chardok<p> 

<i>Spawn Timer:</i> 2 hours, no known placeholder<p> 

<i>Level:</i> 63+<p> 

<i>Melee Damage:</i> Uber (approx. max 385)<p> 

<i>Spells Cast:</i> Fiery Death (AE, approx 500 hp dmg, cancels 1 buff), Complete Heal, Gravity Flux, Gate<p> 

<i>Drops:</i> Singed Scroll which reads, "Greetings Overking Bathezid. The time has come for you to return the boon owed to me from so long ago. I have need of your most powerful summoners to bring Ixiblat Fer into the mortal realm and rain fire upon my enemies. Your old friend, Zordak Ragefire", other drops include Argent Defender (33/49 2h slash), Incarnadine Breastplate, Vibrating Gauntlets/Hammer of Infuse<p> 

<i>Tactics:</i> This is a high level (55+), multi-group (24-30+ person) encounter. The best location for the fight is a matter of opinion. If you fight in his room, you must be careful not to aggro the queen, plus Gravity Flux may aggro mobs in above rooms (Herbalist room) if they are not kept clear. If you fight in the hallway, he may gate (cannot be interrupted) and begin summoning people to their deaths. Another successful tactic involved clearing up to the Herbalist room and fighting the Overking there. He has approx. 6 guards (avg. level may be ~54) with him. Draining his mana will prevent use of Complete Heal and Gate late in the fight.<p>

<B>NPC: Omat Vastsea</B><P>

<i>Location:</i> As above<p> 

<i>Accepts Item:</i> "Sceptre of Ixiblat Fer " and "Singed Scroll", results in "Orb of Clear Water".<p> 

<i>Spoken Text:</i> (when given "Sceptre of Ixiblat Fer " and "Singed Scroll") I commend you on your success over the fire elemental lord, Ixiblat Fer. The fact that the Plasmatic Priesthood has mustered up the power to summon such a being means drastic actions must be taken to stop the fanatic cult of Fennin Ro. I wonder what kind of favor Zordak Ragefire performed for the sarnak summoners to convince them to assist in the ritual that brought forth Ixiblat Fer. The dragon Iksar hybrid abominations are not beings who ally with others easily. All I have seen in my divinations of the High Plasmatic Priest are riddles, and signs that the one who slays him may be awarded an Orb of the Triumvirate. If you are the one whom my visions foretell, then seek Zordak Ragefire and bring me his heart.<p>

<B><FONT SIZE="3">Step Three: Obtain the Orb of Vapor</FONT></B><P>

Immediately after completing the previous step, give "Message to Natasha" to Natasha Whitewater to receive "Shimmering Pearl". Turn in the "Shimmering Pearl" to Zordak Ragefire. He will transform from a level 60 vendor to a level 55 NPC and attack you. When he is killed, Zordakalicus Ragefire, a named fire dragon, will spawn on the spot. Kill him and loot the "Heart of Zordak Ragefire". Turn in the "Heart of Zordak Ragefire" to Omat Vastsea, receiving the "Orb of Vapor" and causing Jhassad Oceanson to spawn.<p>

<B>NPC: Natasha Whitewater</B><P>

<i>Location:</i> As above<p> 

<i>Spawn Timer:</i> Spawned when "Blood Soaked Plasmatic Priest Robe" is given to Omat Vastsea.<p> 

<i>Accepts Item:</i> "Message to Natasha", results in "Shimmering Pearl"<p> 

<i>Spoken Text:</i> (when given "Message to Natasha") Natasha Whitewater lowers her head in mourning and whispers a prayer. It is a shame that fate has decided one so young and from such a background should perish, but we must not attempt to change what was destined to be. Priestess Naxot sacrificed herself selflessly so that others may be spared the horrors Ixiblat would have brought to Norrath. May the waters of Norrath forever remember her reflection. I thank you for delivering Naxot's message to me and give you this pearl imbued with the power of the Triumvirate. Should you find Zordak Ragefire, speak with him before all else and hand him this pearl. No mortal enemy of the Triumvirate can resist its enchantments.<p> 

<B>NPC: Zordak Ragefire/Zordakalicus Ragefire</B><P>

<i>Location:</i> Solusek B in back of Nagafen's lair.<p> 

<i>Spawn Timer:</i> Uncertain. Kel posted an approximation for his spawn formula which may or may not be accurate: "At zone boot-up, do the following- spawn Nagafen, spawn Magus Rokyl, do not spawn Ragefire, set Ragefire-respawn to false. When Magus Rokyl dies, do the following- set Magus Rokyl respawn timer at four game-days, if Nagafen is not up and Ragefire-respawn = false then spawn Ragefire and set Ragefire-respawn to true. When Ragefire dies, do the following- set timer at 16 game-days, if Nagafen is not up at respawn time, then spawn Ragefire, otherwise do not respawn Ragefire and set Ragefire-respawn to false." Alternately, Aarich speculated "that his spawn is 0-65 hours (72 is the max I bet as one of the developers posted they can delay pops for up to 3 days) after nag dies. Then after you kill him it is 23-24 hours."<p> 

<i>Level:</i> 60 (initial spawn), 55 (after receiving "Shimmering Pearl"), 54 (dragon form)<p> 

<i>Drops:</i> Initially, he is a vendor that sells Imbue Fire Opal (Solusek Ro deity-specific spell) and Oil of Fennin Ro (~1700pp). In dragon form, always drops "Heart of Zordak Ragefire", plus one or more pieces of "Blazing" armor and Nagafen loot table items, including red dragon scales. Known "Blazing" items include Blazing Greaves of Fennin Ro, Blazing Vambraces, and a breastplate (AC 20, +5 WIS, +5 INT, +8 CHA, +20 SV FIRE, plate classes/all races but Iksar, effect: Sunbeam).<p> 

<i>Spoken Text:</i> (when hailed) Zordak Ragefire stares at <your name> with unblinking eyes. A wide grin crosses Zordak's face and flames flicker in the depths of his eyes. 'Welcome to the new fortress of the Plasmatic Priesthood! It's a shame about Lord Nagafen's untimely death, really it is! Such a powerful and noble creature should not perish at the hands of mortals.'<p> 

(when given "Shimmering Pearl") Zordak Ragefire laughs maniacally as he crushes the pearl in his hands with inhuman strength. 'The Triumvirate missionaries think their petty magic can affect me!! I will send your heads to Omat as a symbol of what is to come for all of his missionaries!'<p> 

<i>Tactics:</i> After being given the pearl, Zordak Ragefire will attack you. When he is killed, his true (dragon) form, Zordakalicus Ragefire, will spawn on the spot where he dies. Zordakilicus Ragefire is a clone of Lord Nagafen, but will not banish level 53+ characters. Normal Nagafen tactics apply, except that he runs at the end of the fight, as in the above picture, and may hit somewhat harder than Nagafen.<p>

<B>NPC: Omat Vastsea</B><P>

<i>Location:</i> As above<p> 

<i>Accepts Item:</i> "Heart of Zordak Ragefire", results in "Orb of Vapor" and Jhassad Oceanson spawns.<p>

<i>Spoken Text:</i> (when given "Heart of Zordak Ragefire") Omat Vastsea says 'I see now that Zordak Ragefire and the exiled elder dragon Zordakalicus were the same being. That explains how he resisted our attempts to divine his affairs and past. Each of these orbs I have granted you represents one of the Triumvirate. Jhassad Oceanson awaits on the shore below to perform the ritual that will merge the orbs into a single Orb of the Triumvirate and summon an avatar from the Plane of Water. Present the Orb of the Triumvirate to the Avatar of Water when it arrives and allow your destiny to be unraveled.<p>

<b>Jhassad Oceanson</b><p>

<i>Location:</i> Timorous Deep, near Omat Vastsea<p>

<i>Spawn Timer:</i> Spawned when "Heart of Zordak Ragefire" is given to Omat Vastsea.<p> 

<i>Accepts Item:</i> "Orb of Frozen Water", "Orb of Clear Water", and "Orb of Vapor", results in "Orb of the Triumvirate".<p>

<i>Spoken Text:</i> (when given "Orb of Frozen Water", "Orb of Clear Water", and "Orb of Vapor") Jhassad Oceanson kneels in the sand and places the three orbs into a large abalone shell bowl. A blue glow surrounds his hands as he waves them over the orbs resting in the bowl. The orbs crack and fall apart, releasing their contents, then reform into a single glowing orb. Jhassad Oceanson gently removes the Orb of the Triumvirate and places it in [your name]'s hands. 'The Avatar of Water approaches. You must hand him the Orb of the Triumvirate and it will be decided if it is your destiny to wield the Nem Ankh Sprinkler.<p>

<b>NPC: Avatar of Water</b><p>

<i>Location:</i> Timorous Deep, near Jhassad Oceanson 

<i>Accepts Item:</i> "Orb of the Triumvirate", returns "Water Sprinkler of Nem Ankh" 

<i>Tactics:</i> The Avatar of Water spawns, roams along the shore, then returns to stand by Jhassad Oceanson. You may turn in the Orb at any point in the Avatar's pathing, but you will not receive experience unless you turn it in once it has stopped.<p>
