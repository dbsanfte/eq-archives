Eternum was created in November of the year 2000 by a group of friends. As new people joined, it was decided that as the guild expanded, many guidelines would have to be implemented and here are the majority of them. This section is bound to change over time as members come and go, and as the core beliefs of the guild change ever so slowly. This is a list of the beliefs we expect our members, as a guild and as individuals, to follow taken from the texts of several conversations among the guild leaders and recorded by me, Karieanne.<P>

You are expected, simply put, to treat each other with respect. If you apply to join thinking following this most basic rule may be a problem, please delete your application now. You are not required to go out of your way to aide a guildmate in any way, but it is expected that if a member is in need of assistance and it is reasonably within your capabilities to do so (example : you are a Necromancer in the Dreadlands and a guildmate has lost his/her corpse and has a coffin on his/her persona for corpse summoning. You would be expected to aide this person if it was reasonably within your abilities. You would not be expected to do this if the person's corpse were in West Karana, but it would be most appreciated and the proper recognition and thanks would be given). You are not expected to give items/money to a guild member, though a guild discount is of course appreciated.<P>

In all cases, you are expected to interact honestly with those you meet on your travels. This does not imply that you are not allowed to have conflicts with people, only that, simply, if you don't like the person, ignore him/her. Like it or not, you are a reflection of the guildtag you wear. If you don't wish to act civilized, then please do not apply for membership.<P>

<B>Level Requirements</B><P>

We will consider all applications from players level 46 and above. Certain classes may be more carefully monitored while we review applications because of the excessive numbers of certain classes within the guild. This is not saying that if you apply to join, you will be rejected simply because of your class, only that if you notice your class has many more members on our roster than any other class, it would be a wise idea to get to know many of our members well before applying. In all seriousness, generally this is the best way to become a member. Just get to know us. Most of us are very open people and are easily found with a simple /who all Eternum. In regards to the questions I've heard inquiring just why we have the level requirement -- We want all of our members to be able to attend our guild's raids, and we want all of our members to group and spend time together. That's why Eternum was originally founded, to have a core member base of people who could and would spend time with each other and honestly just be able to have fun together.<P>

<B>How to Join</B><P>

Visit our message boards. You'll find a section entitled "Applications for New Members", which is exactly what it seems. Fill out a post stating your main character's name, class, level, guild acquaintances (if it does apply), and the reason you would like to join. All prospective members are required to apply on their message boards. Their post must stay for at least 1 week before they can be approved to join. In a few special cases which I will not go into detail in, but have existed in the past, mainly being caused by guild mergers and such, a vote of the officers will be taken and if none disapprove, the person will be invited. Again, this is quite rare, and few if any will match the circumstances to be invited through this process in the future.<P>

<B><FONT SIZE="3">Raids Scheduling and Leading</FONT></B><P>

Anyone with a fair amount of knowledge of the zone in question is welcome to set up and lead a raid on it. This requires commitment, and in many cases, reminders. If you mention that you have a raid coming up once and let the subject drop til 2 hours beforehand, don't be surprised if your member turnout is below satisfactory. In the case that you wish to raid a certain zone/mob for one reason or another, but don't believe you have the knowledge required to carry it through, ask an officer to find you a raid leader. All of the officers are very experienced players with a wide collective knowledge of all the zones Norrath has to offer and have lead numerous raids in our time.<P>

<B><FONT SIZE="3">Loot Rules</FONT></B><P>

Eternum does not currently work on a seniority system and I seriously doubt it ever will. We use a system most commonly known as Need Before Greed. When an item drops, all those present that can and will use it will roll a /random 1 100. The only exceptions to this rule are if the raid leader chooses to give certain privileges to those members who were present from the start of the raid. Again, this depends purely on situation and who your raid leader is at the time. Any items that no person present can/will use an item that drops, the item will be presented to a guild officer to be placed in the guild bank account to be presented to someone who can and will use it. In the case that no one can/will use an item, it will either be traded for another item that can/will be used by someone, or will be sold for money to fund future raids. How the person to receive an item is chosen, in the case that there are multiple members in need of it is usually decided keeping close in mind who participates most and behaves well within our ranks. Simply put, you come through for us and we'll come through for you. As far as raids go. Eternum is a self-sufficient guild. We have all the necessary member to raid the planes or dungeons that we choose to go to. However, there are still sometimes we will allow others to come to the planes/dungeon raids with us. And in this case the following loot rules will apply. I strongly believe in taking care of your own. Many members of Eternum could easily get into any of the other UBER guilds, so because of their dedication they receive benefits on our raids. Eternum members will roll before ANY of the invites do. Here is an example: Plane of Hate - 3 Eternum Clerics present - 2 invited Clerics present Ethereal Mist Vambraces drop - the 3 Eternum Clerics roll - winner loots and is "out" Ethereal Mist Gauntlets drop - 2 remaining Eternum Clerics roll - winner loots and is "out" Ethereal Mist Greaves drop - remaining Eternum Cleric loots.<P>

Now that ALL Eternum Clerics have looted something the floor is open for our invites to win something via rolling.<P>

Ethereal Mist Boots drop - ALL Clerics present roll - winner loots and is "out". And so on and so forth.<P>

<B><FONT SIZE="3">Twinks</FONT></B><P>

We do not currently, nor do I expect us to ever allow twinks in guild. I won't go into precise reasoning for this rule because every time it's brought up, it sparks a long debate that I do not, at this moment, have the patience to address. If this rule seriously concerns you, give me or another officer a tell in game, I'm sure each of us would be more than happy to explain the reasoning behind this rule. On a lighter topic, I've heard word that, for communication purposes, a twink guild is being established that everyone's twinks are welcome to join if you wish to stay 'in the know' while playing your twink. Meaning, if a raid is spontaneously set up, we don't have to /who all every person's twink who is not currently online, but simply /who all guild. I believe this is only in the discussion/beginning creation phase at the moment, but I'll edit this page to contain more information on the topic as the information becomes available to me. Also, if you're interested in joining Eternum, but do not yet meet the level requirement, or perhaps would just like to get to know a few of us, you may be directed to our twink guild as a 'waiting room' type of establishment. Again, as I'm unsure if it's been implemented yet, you would have to inquire with an officer for further information on the subject.<P>

<B><FONT SIZE="3">Guild Pride!</FONT></B><P>

In general, we would like to encourage everyone to leave off all forms of anonymous. Although, we most certainly allow the use of the /role command to disguise one's class/level to those pesky rez/port/etc. beggars. But, it should be also known that in near all circumstances, we do not approve of the use of the /anon command. For those of you unaware of the difference (yes, you do exist, I've spoken to people under the assumption that they knew the difference only to find out that indeed, they did not, which created quite some confusion both on my part, and to the person to whom I was speaking), /role hides your level, race, class, and zone. /anon hides all of the above, but also, in addition to that, it hides one's guildtag. The reason we have this as a rule is, in my experience, there are generally only two times in which people will logically use the /anon command rather then /role. First being they are ashamed of their guild. If while you have an Eternum guild! tag, you ever use /anon for this particular reason, please consult an officer, because obviously there is something very wrong which needs our attention. Second reason being, the person is about to do something wrong and does not wish to subject their guild's reputation to tarnish over this action. If this is the case, please reconsider your actions, and if you still wish to go through with this, please guild remove. We, as a guild, are a people who follow the rules, believing closely that they are there to protect us and cannot protect us unless they are followed. If an officer happens to notice you on /anon, no big deal. They'll simply request that you remove it and that if you wish to remain anonymous, to use /role. How you react to this request is your own decision. I am, however, aware that there are rare circumstances that warrant the use of /anon. For example, I've been on a couple raids where everyone went /anon to prevent the screen clutter and lag caused ! by having so much name line text on the screen. I believe I've gone over all the necessary topics. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to give me or another officer a tell in game, or create a post, with your email address, on our public board, and someone will contact you.<P>
