  <FONT SIZE="2" FACE="arial"><B>Time to move on... ~ April 8, 2001</B><BR>
After sixteen long months of playing EverQuest, the time has finally come for me to move on. I leave not in anger, but rather with the hope to improve my own well-being and to also help others realize that this is only a game. I have had many great adventures and made many good friends along the way. However, no game can compare to what real life has to offer. With that said, Breezer will be taking over the website in a few days. I wish Eternum the best in everything.<P>

This evening, Ssyn gathered a small army of fourteen to assist him with killing Gwan in the Plane of Sky. Unfortunately, someone was unaware of dangers with using area effect spells in this plane and everyone died. Soon thereafter, Another group was teleported up so that Penelopie could resurrect everyone. Once everyone was ready to go, we buffed up and proceeded to the next island. We then attacked and killed Gwan with only one casualty! Congratulations Ssyn! And many thanks to everyone who was there tonight! =)

  <FONT SIZE="2" FACE="arial"><B>New Webpage ~ March 26, 2001</B><BR>
Three months ago I designed a website for Eternum. Times have changed and I felt that our webpage should reflect those changes. For that reason, I have redesigned the webpage. It does look very similar to the old design, with the exception of added graphics and content. There are now member and officer only areas, a page for screenshots, and a new charter and rules for you to view. If anyone has any other suggestions regarding the new design, please send me an email  and I will see what can be done.
