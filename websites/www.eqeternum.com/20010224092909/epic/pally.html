The quest starts by hailing Inte Akera in the Plane of Air. He spawns in the windmill on Pegasus Isle when someone turns in 500pp to Dirkog. You must have good faction wit the Deepwater Knights for him to give you the quest. If your faction is too low, you can raise your faction with the Deepwater Knights by killing Elial Brook (level 8 necro) that spawns at the docks in the Toxxulia Forrest. His timed spawn rate is six minutes.<P>

Inte will tell you that he needs four things and upon you handing them to him, he will give you the blade he wields. He asks for two blessings, the head of Miragul and the Robe of Miragul. The blessings are received from Inte when you give him items that prove your nobility and your sacrifice.<P>

The first blessing, nobility, is received from giving him a <B>Soulfire</B>. The Soulfire quest begins by giving a blanket, bog juice, and edible goo to the prisoner under the arena. (FYI, this is Zimmel. He made Soulfire.)<P>

<B>Blanket:</B> Head over to Seafarer's roost in East Freeport. Then wait for the begger to spawn next to the bar. Purchase Drom's Champagne from the bar tender and keep giving the champagne to the begger, one at a time, until he gives you the blanket.<P>

<B>Bog Juice</B> is made by brewing snake scales, water flask, and bottle.<P>

<B>Edible Goo</B> is made by baking rat ears and a fire beetle eye.<P>

Once you give the blanket, juice and goo to Zimmel, he will give you a key with HK and a number on it. Give this key to the banker at the counter in High Keep. She will give you a note from Brother Hayle, which states that he will hold Soulfire until someone worthy enough to wield it comes along.<P>

Hayle is imprisoned within the caves of Splitpaw, but not too far in. I highly recommend that you check your faction with Hayle before handing him anything. Amiable or Kindly faction should be enough. If this is not the case, then you can increase your faction by giving 2gp to ___ in Qeynos.<P>

Giving Hayle the note will result in him asking for proof of your faith. He gives you the note back and asks you to bring him your Testimony of Truth, the Hilt of the Soulfire, a Sword of Faith, and the note he just gave you.<P>

<B>Testimony of Truth:</B><P>
This small quest is given by Merko in the Hall of Truth. He first gives you a letter and asks you to help Altunic Jartin in East Commons. Altunic can usually be found in the hut near Inn3, but he often wonders around. Just wait at this hut until he arrives. Give the letter to Altunic and he will ask you to help him kill a thief named Squire Narl. Narl spawns just outside the hut I referred to earlier. Hand in Narl's head to Altunic and he will then ask you to bring him a <I>medium</I> cloth shirt. Altunic will then give you the Token of Generosity.<P>

Head back to the Hall of Truth and talk to Merko. He will ask you to bring him a spider venom sac. Once you hand that in, he will give you the Token of Bravery.<P>

Now, give Merko both tokens and kill the guard that spawns in the sewers next to him. Loot that token and give it to Merko. Merko will now give you your testimony.<P>

<B>Hilt of the Soulfire:</B><P>
The hilt is dropped by Shadow Knight named Xicotl.  He spawns in Mayong's Bathroom of Castle Mistmoore.<P>

<B>Sword of Faith:</B><P>
Valeron Dushire in the Hall of Truth asks you to prove yourself by bringing him Sir Lucan's testimony. Lucan is the head of the Freeport Militia and can be found in the Militia House of West Freeport. Killing him will net you his testimony.<P>

The best way to kill Lucan is to have someone run the gate guards to the North Freeport zone, while another person goes inside the Militia House and brings Lucan outside the Freeport gates. The one pulling Lucan must zone into East Commons and someone else who is not KoS needs to keep Lucan hailed until everyone is ready to fight. The battle will not be easy, but a single, well-rounded group of 50+ should have no problem. After killing Lucan, a less powerful skeleton rises in his place. This skeleton has Lucan's testimony.<P>

After looting the testimony, head back to the Hall of Truth. Hand Lucan's testimony to Valeron and he will give you the Sword of Faith in return.<P>

Now, head back to Splitpaw and hand the Testimony of Truth, Hilt of the Soulfire, and the Sword of Faith and the note to Brother Hayle. With kindly faction or better, he will give you the Soulfire as he promised.
<P>

The second blessing, sacrifice, is recieved from giving Inte a <B>Ghoulbane</B>.<P>


The head of Miragul can be found by killing the Lich and Miragul in Everfrost.<BR>
The robe of Miragul can be obtained by bringing Miragul from the undead.<P>
