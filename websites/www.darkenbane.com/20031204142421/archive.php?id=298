Some info about the upcoming patch has been released.  I will list some of the good stuff here:<br />
<br />
<i>1) The Skyguard anti-aircraft buggy is now available for use. Enjoy!</i><br />
<br />
I get the impression they don't want aircraft buzzing around to much ;p <br />
<br />
<i>2) Hotspot algorithms have been improved. The Hotspots now scale up and down in size so that you can see the relative size of the battles in progress. Additionally, they are much more accurate (there is always a battle there now if you see a hotspot) and they refresh much more often. You should find them much more useful in finding battles now.</i><br />
<br />
This is gonna be nice.  I already use what they have and it seems pretty good.  Improvements will be even better. <br />
<br />
<i>3) You can now respawn to a hacked building if you are a member of the owning Empire. Previously, once a building was hacked, the option to respawn there was unavailable. This is no longer the case.</i> <br />
<br />
I smell some awesome tube camps in the making....<br />
<br />
<i>14) You can no longer see infiltration suits while your view is zoomed.</i> <br />
<br />
OOOOOOO, I like this one!<br />
<br />
<i>22) You can no longer hack an enemy base if the friendly base connected to that base (on the lattice) is already hacked. In otherwords, if your base of operations is hacked, you can't use that base to link to other enemy bases. Therefore, you can't hack enemy bases until your own rear area is secure.</i> <br />
<br />
Finally!   This should stabilize the frontlines of wars and stop the idotic lone hackers from "leapfrogging".  Thi sis real nice....and if they put a 5 minute hack time on towers, we will start seeing some really awesome fights.<br />
<br />
<i>25) Pulsar was boosted in damage slightly per shot against soldiers. Also, the AP fire rate was increased to match that of Standard shots.</i><br />
<br />
Ghey. <br />
<br />
<i>27) The population lock indicator has been changed to show how many slots are left for your Empire on that continent. In otherwords, it now shows a number instead of a percentage. The number caps out at 100, so if more than 100 slots remain on a continent, the indicator will say "100+". </i><br />
<br />
I guess they are doin' this cause people were not goin' to continants that had low % pops from their empire.  A change to fuxxor the sheep I guess.  <br />
<br />
I wish they would change some other stuff though like:<br />
<br />
1. Add a guild statistic (and leader board position) which divides the guild's points by it's members base.  Thus giving a good leaderboard position for non zerg guilds who have quality players.  Presently, leaderboards are only for the zerg.<br />
<br />
2. Add a death statistic to characters to see how many times a person has died and a ratio kill:deaths for the leaderboard.  This will make death a little bit more painful and perhaps stop the zerging to some extent.<br />
<br />
3. Add a warning when a hacker is currently beggining the hack on a base or tower and increase the time it takes to complete the hack so as to stop the solo hackers.   Hacking should be a at least a squad thing imho.  This will also stop the crap where a single stealthed hacker sneaks into a tower with 30 allies and hacks the tower around them.  Basically, if someone wants a tower or base, they are gonna have to fuckin' take it.<br />
<br />
4. Either nerf the Stryker or give tracking weapons to NC and VS (the tracking ability of a weapon is the most powerful addition of any weapon).   Being the only team with an infantry carried tracker missle is overpowered and makes using aircraft and vehicles vs TR much harder then vs. the other teams.  Nerf suggestions range from increasing the refire time dramatically, to "lighting" up the person who has a stryker equipped (making them visible on everyone's proximity map if they have the weapon equipped).   Any good teast to see if there is balance to a weapon is to check the % of players on a team that uses a given weapon.   I would venture to guess that 90% of TR 8th level and above have anti-vehicle (stryker).  Compare that to the other teams.  Basically, when you fight TR, go as infantry until they do something with this.</td></tr>
