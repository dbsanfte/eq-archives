<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="1">Submitted by <a href="mailto:grayrage@darkenbane.com">Grayrage</a> on 29-06-2001 19:54</font><p>As indicated previously, DB members are entering SZ to test it out.  Info regarding the progression of the server will be posted here!  In fact, the Sony team has some interesting new stuff for the mad PKers on SZ:<br>
<font size="2"><br>
Many of you know that we've been planning to add a point system to the deity team PvP server. The idea is to track the characters that are doing the most for their team, and to allow everyone to see what the activity is like on the server.<br>
We're working on that system now. The 'points' are already being counted, have been since the server went Live. Here's what we have in mind (and we'd appreciate any feedback on this).<br>
<br>
Points are only gained if the target/victim is 20th level or above.<br>
Points are only gained for killing characters within 5 levels of you.<br>
For each kill you earn 100 points.<br>
But for killing the same person a second time within a 60 minute period, you only gain 50 points.<br>
For the third kill on the same person in a 60 minute period you gain 25 points.<br>
For the fourth, you gain no points.<br>
For any over four against the same character in a 60 minute period you lose 25 points.<br>
Being killed by someone within 5 levels of you causes you to lose 25 points.<br>
Insignia are worth points as long as they are in your inventory or bank (anywhere in your character's possession.) when points are tallied.<br>
Lesser Insignia = 1 point<br>
Normal Insignia = 5 points<br>
Greater Insignia = 10 points<br>
Superior Insignia = 25 points<br>
<br>
Right now we are planning on daily or weekly updates (depending on the statistic being updated) of stats like the top 20 over all and for each team, perhaps the top 20 guilds over all and for each team.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind: This is all subject to change!<br>
<br>
If at some future date we feel that the point system is not working out, or if we decide to change the values of points gained or other such things, we will. Obviously we don't plan to make any changes once it is all established but keep in mind that this is an extraneous feature, a for fun thing, and it's not inviolate.<br>
<br>
So send in your comments and suggestions.<br>

** Gameplay Changes **<br>
<br>
- Aggro Changes: We've made an adjustment to the way that NPCs choose their targets. It's a rather simple change, one that makes a lot of sense. But we want you to be aware of it so that it won't surprise you too much, and so that you won't think that it is a bug. NPCs are now much more aware of the vulnerability (or, more precisely, the invulnerability) of their targets. NPCs will now be very unlikely to waste their time attacking a target that they can't harm.<br>
<br>
- Spell and Item Interruption: Ducking will now interrupt a spell instantly. You will no longer be able to sit while using items or casting spells. This will not affect bard songs, which will still work as they always have, but will affect all items, even those with song-like effects.<br>
<br>
<br>
** Spell Changes **<br>
<br>
- Skin Like Nature and Natureskin should stack with more spells now (though not with each other).<br>
<br>
- Aegolism can now be clicked off.<br>
<br>
- Imbue Ivory has had its casting level lowered to 29.<br>
<br>
- Shard of the Core will be tradable now.<br>
<br>
- Shroud of Hate and Visions of Grandeur should stack properly now.<br>
<br>
- Several new Translocation spells have been added.<br>
<br>
- Call of the Hero will no longer remove the target from NPCs' hatelists if the target is not summoned far enough.<br>
<br>
- Egress will now work indoors.<br>
<br>
- Wind of the North, Wind of the South, Markar's Relocation and Tishan's Relocation have had their additional restrictions removed, and can now be cast from any zone where other similar spells can be cast.<br>
<br>
- Summon Companion can now be used by Necromancers, Shamans, Enchanters, Shadowknights in addition to Magicians.<br>
<br>
- Deadeye should now stack with Dead Man Floating, but should not stack with Acumen.<br>
<br>
- Plainsight will now stack with Dead Man Floating, but not with Acumen.<br>
<br>
- The Great Divide portal spells are now 39th level instead of 44th level.<br>
<br>
- Spirit of the Oak will no longer be overwritten by any beneficial spells.<br>
<br>
- Paralyzing Poison spells should no longer be broken by direct damage spells.<br>
<br>
- Hsagra's Wrath and Porlos' Fury now have a 5 second recast delay.<br>
<br>
<br>
** Item Changes **<br>
<br>
- The effect on the 10th ring should have fewer stacking conflicts with haste buffs. <br>
<br>
- The effect of the Monk epic, Celestial Tranquility, will stack with the higher end haste spells. Keep in mind - the highest haste will always win out. This means that the spells will stack, the haste components will not.<br>
<br>
- Speed of the Shissar has had its duration increased from 20 minutes to 30 minutes. This effect should no longer conflict with Call of Earth.<br>
<br>
- Bone Ring of Condemnation will no longer be usable in the secondary slot, it will only be wearable on the finger.<br>
<br>
- Druid Skyshrine Quest armor has had a color change so that it will look more unique.<br>
<br>
- Circlet of Shadow will no longer drop in-game. The Circlet of Shadows, can now be found in its place. This item differs from the original only in that it has a five-second casting time. Existing Circlets of Shadow will retain the same functionality as before, though we may change existing Circlets at some future date.<br>
<br>
<br>
** Quest Changes **<br>
<br>
- King Tormax is now a little more particular about who he gives quests to.<br>
<br>
- The Iksar Shaman 6th Skull/cudgel quest should be working now. <br>
<br>
- Rumor has it that there is a new source for green dragon scales in Norrath.<br>
<br>
<br>
** PvP Changes **<br>
<br>
- If you go link dead on a PvP server and are killed you can still be looted.<br>
<br>
- When a player becomes invisible (or hides successfully) every other player that had them targeted will lose their target. This is true for all servers, but has the greatest implications on PvP servers. The use of spells that allow you to see through invisibility will prevent you from losing your target if that target hides or goes invisible.<br>
<br>
- Faction hits on Rallos Zek: Killing a person in one of his or her home cities will cause a faction hit with residents of that city.<br>
<br>
<br>
** Miscellaneous **<br>
<br>
- We've addressed a lot of spelling and grammatical errors over the past few weeks. For example we have corrected all misspellings of "deity" in messages to the player, changed Cantana to Cantata and others.<br>
<br>
- The 'Fab Four' in Dagnor's Cauldron will no longer assist Undertow Skeletons.<br>
<br>
- Instill Doubt/Intimidation can no longer be used while sitting, and sitting after starting it will cancel it.<br>
<br>
- Mastery of language skills now occurs at 100, not at 101. This was a problem for masters of a language, since language skills could not go over 100.<br>
<br>
- The messages for eating and drinking now say "Chomp... Chomp," or "Glug... Glug..." so that they can't be copied with emotes.<br>
<br>
- Helms on Barbarians, Trolls, and Ogres should no longer block the first person view when in combat. <br>
<br>
- Sirens Grotto has been changed a bit. It should be a more interesting zone now.<br>
<br>
<br>
** NOTE **<br>
<br>
Boisterous shouts can be heard across the lands as carriers herald the arrival of the latest volume of their city's newspapers. Citizens rush to get a copy of these publications to read the featured articles, latest gossip, and community news for their home town.<br>

<br>
As everyone is aware, the events group Sabbat, Synergy and, to a lesser degree, Reverant exist and are established event groups that have organized events to basically kill stuff and get goodies.  The Dark Pact will work in a similar manner as we will plan events on the Dark Pact message board.  Loot will be distributed based on an automated system on this website that logs the hours a member has put into the organization.<br>
<br>
Individuals are welcome to apply for the Dark Pact utilizing the <a href="http://www.darkenbane.com/apply.php3"target="_blank">apply</a> link to the left and selecting either DP or DB.  An email with information regarding your membership will be sent to you.<br>
<br>
The Dark Pact events group will NOT require a member to be a PK.  Additionally, members of the events group can expect to grow a relationship with DB members and enjoy an immunity from their attacks as well as help against their foes as necessary.<br>
<br>
Guilds may also apply to the events group and their members all receive membership packages.  The level restriction for the Dark Pact is the same as Darkenbane and is set at 46.  Any guild leaders that are interested in joining the Dark Pact should contact me at: grayrage@hotmail.com.<br><br></td></tr>

<font size="2"><br>
I have been promoted to the position of Lead GM.  This means that I now fill<br>
a role similar to Lead GM Kriggan from whom you received your notification<br>
of banning.  While server GMs are the final arbiters of all things which<br>
occur on server, a Lead GM is a source of information, consistency, and<br>
guidance.  I am honored to have been selected to fill this position.  I have<br>
enjoyed my time immensely on Rallos Zek, but feel confident that the new GM,<br>
GM Lyndro, will do a great job.  He has my personal recommendation and I'm<br>
confident that he will steward the server with a steady hand, an open mind,<br>
and a patient ear.<br>

Good luck and travel lightly.<br>

It is uncertain what our status will be come the time of the competion.<br>
<font size="2"><br>
I announced at Fan Faire that I will be coming out of events retirement to design and run Test of Tactics III. I am still working on the design document of this event, but at this time it looks like it will be 18 vs 18 using the entire inside of the arena. Basically the only rule will be, you can't bind in the arena zone. Those that are killed and can be revived would be able to re-enter the event. Fear, Charm, Fluxing would be allowed. Activatable items of all kinds (Except for amulet of necropotence, no more armies of undead), will be allowed.<br>
<br>
Teams would have a minimal of 1060 levels on their 18 person team. This is an average of 59th level. Prizes are yet undetermined, but should be extreme enough to promote the largest event in Verant history.<br>
<br>
While this event is still several months out, I wanted to give people a 'heads up' to start getting ideas, teams, and most importantly tactics ready for this event.<br>

More to follow when I have more.<br>

Congratulations!<br>
<br>
Your guild, Dee Bee, has been approved. We look forward to seeing your<br>
guild throughout the lands of Norrath.<br>
<br>
To actually have your guild created, you will need to have 10 players (that<br>
includes yourself) online and then petition that you are ready to have your<br>
guild created.  Please be aware that the 10 member minimum is now required to<br>
keep your active status as a guild, and that if you fall below this number, you<br>
could be subject to deletion of your guild.<br>
<br>
If you have any problems in scheduling the creation time for your guild, feel<br>
free to email EQGuilds@station.sony.com and we will work with you to get your<br>
guild up and running soon.<br>
<br>
Good Luck!<br>

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="1">Submitted by <a href="mailto:grayrage@darkenbane.com">Grayrage</a> on 21-06-2001 13:46</font><p>Well, one good thing about Sony stepping in and killing off Darkenbane is that we have a chance to clean up the roster.  The people LEFT on the roster will have an open admission in the guild DB is currently wrangling to get (they have turned down every name we have tried so far....should be interesting what name we end up with....maybe something with a purple dinasour.  It's starting to wear on me though and the fun of the game is slowly but surely fading with this sillyness.).<br>
<br>
The folks who have been removed from the roster will have to send in an email requesting to be re-added, but they will be required to show their skill in PvP and will have to approved on the private board.  We also are raising our requirements to 46+.<br>
<br>
Once everything gets situated, the Dark Pact will reform.  Since DB will be FAR harder to get into in the future, many applicants to the guild can be in the Dark Pact (our events group) while they try for admission.  The Dark Pact will have it's own secure message board for raid planning (DB will have its own secure message board to make fun of everyone and PvP raid planning).  Dark Pact members will have a login on the website to log points for raids (yes, members will now add their own points after a raid) and to trade points as necessary.   <br>
<br>
The points system will START OVER.  I expect the Dark Pact (given Sony does not do anything else silly) will begin events within 2 weeks or so..3 at the latest.   The DP message board and an application for the DP will be up on the website.  YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE A PK TO BE in the Dark Pact!<br>
<br>
The Dark Pact will simply be an alternative Planar Raid Group (alternative to Sabbat, Synergy or Reverant) so this might be a good time to get in early.  The Dark Pact roster will be cleared regularly so if u don't show up for a few events in a row yer gonna get jacked from the list and permission from the private board removed.<br>
<br>
The points system will work like it did before with everyone getting 1 point per hour of attendance and items received costing the member points based onthe value of the item received.  People that do NOT go to the events will be deducted prolly 2 or 3 points per missed event.<br>
<br>
Well, soon enough DB will be up and running under our gay new name (prolly the "Purple Fluff Boys" if they fail to accept my last submission of "The Bane") and we will try to get things goin' how they were prior to Sony's intervention.<br><br></td></tr>
