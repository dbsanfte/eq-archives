<br>
1. Fear Friday Night<br>
2. Fear Saturday/Dread goes DOWN!<br>
3. Battle with some Reverant in Fear Sat. night<br>
4. Hate Sunday<br>
5. Points Rules changes<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
On Friday night, DB broke Fear (we are getting good at it).  Here is the stuff that did not rot or get destroyed:<br>
<br>
1. Yaari-Cryosilk Cloak<br>
2. Uaelueliu-Carmine Gloves<br>
3. Ssukon-Diamond<br>
4. Graraige-Cryosilk Cloak<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Saturday in Fear was much better for loot drops.  We killed Dread also.  Here is the goodies dropped:<br>
<br>
1. Finastik-Cryosilk Cloak (sheesh)<br>
2. Melakwa-Jacinth<br>
3. Bamkrak-SK Gloves<br>
4. Enlucent-Carmine Boots<br>
5. Kulumalda-Some ball thing for her epic off Dread.<br>
6. Zearathero-SK Bracer<br>
7. Smoek-Cleric Belt (the droppable one)<br>
8. Ekimus-Jacinth<br>
9. Einnod-Another of those cleric belts.<br>
10 Hamadryad-TV Bracer<br>
11 Ekimus-Jacinth<br>
12 Fizzletwit-Verm Crown<br>
13 Pyscholistic-Carmine Sleeves<br>

<br>
--------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
After pretty much clearing Fear Saturday, we were plodding along with the temple (about 10 MOBs left) when we got word a crowd of folks was organizing to duke it out with us.  Well we buffed up and got ready, but they did not come.  We got bored and gated to Feerot so we could smash them there, but they zoned into Fear right when WE zoned out for them (unbelievable).<br>
<br>
In any case, we ran back to Fear and attacked.  <a href="http://boards.gamers.com/messages/message_view-topic.asp?name=darkenbane&id=zyusd"target="_blank">Here is a log of that fun ass fight.</a>  We got some goodies from them too :)<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Well we went to Hate on Sunday and, unfortutely I had to work.  I was able to help in porting everyone up, but I could not stay for the debacle of a raid (good thing too...as I heard it was a mess).<br>
<br>
Break in went ok...we camped two clerics and had our corpse pullers bring corpses to the safe spot without to much trouble.  I logged after that, but from what i heard...NOT ONE DRUID WAS PRESENT TO SNARE MOBS.  Unbelievable.  Genaside and myself were the only wizards and we had to let the new Maule (new ownership) back into the guild so he could help with porting duties.  Ever came late with a group, but of all 20 or so DB druids there was not ONE in Hate Sunday.  Only 1 necro...1 wizzie (after I left).<br>
<br>
Bleh, as everyone can see that was a disapointing raid.  In themiddle of everyone dying 50 times, TASH did get his purple people eater pants.  Grats Tash...u don't look like a newb so much anymore ;p  In any case, see the next section on some adjustments we will make ot the points system to try to fix the gay unresponsiveness of folks who don't show up for "their" Plane.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Points Rules changes:<br>
<br>
1. Axxeron will be in charge of logging people IN and OUT of all events.  DP members MUST send her a tell and get confirmation on when they ARRIVE and when they LEAVE an event.  If they FAIL to check in, they will NOT get points.<br>
<br>
2. DP members will now get 1 point per hour of attendance at DP events.<br>
<br>
3. We are considering a minor penalty for those DP members who do not attend events.  This way a druid who goes only on Fear raids can expect to lose points for missing all of the Hate raids.  I will think about this, but will probably deduct 3 to 4 points from people who miss events entirely.  Even showing up at all will prevent this loss of points.<br><br></td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="#7A7AA5"><td><b>Some important new PvP changes to come in the next patch!</b></td><td align="right"><b>05-05-2001</b></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="1">Submitted by <a href="mailto:grayrage@darkenbane.com">Grayrage</a> on 05-05-2001 01:42</font><p>Absor posted some GREAT news for PvP on the developer's corner at the Everquest website!!  Check it out!<br>
------------------------------------------------<br>
<p align="left"><font size="2">When we patch next, the following changes will be implemented on the PvP servers:<br>
Consider: /Consider will only have three results when used to consider a Player Character. The character will show as 'green' if he is below the range that allows you to attack him. The character will show as 'white/black' if he is within your ability to attack. And the character will show as 'red' if he is above your range.<br>
<br>
Sanctuary Levels: Characters below level six will not be able to engage in PvP combat, unless they take part in a Guild War, duel or use the Arena.<br>
<br>
De-Leveling: Characters that lose levels will only retain the skills of a character two levels higher. This means that if a character of level 10 somehow loses 5 levels, that character will only have skills that would be available to a 7th level character. This change will apply to all servers (it has to, code-wise). So the two level buffer is there to make certain that people that lose levels during normal gameplay will be minimally affected (hopefully not affected at all), while those that purposefully lose levels with the intent of causing other players grief will find themselves at no great advantage.<br>
<br>
There may very well be other changes in the patch, so read the patch message carefully. And this is only the first of the things that we plan to change, so don't worry that this is all that we plan to do. We are taking a careful, step-by-step approach to changes whenever we can.<br>

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="1">Submitted by <a href="mailto:grayrage@darkenbane.com">Grayrage</a> on 04-05-2001 17:34</font><p>I have updated the raid points from last week.  Please check to make sure they are accurate and DB insta-message me any mess ups.  Also all events raids and DB communications will now be done through the DB messaging system you see once you logon to the site.<br>
<br>
For those Dbers with alts that have negative points:  Please put points from your main characters onto your alts to zero them out so I don't have to do the addition/subtraction whenever we are determining loots.  *cough* Meter *cough*.  Transferral of points can be done after logging onto the site.<br>
<br>
DP members that don't know how to logon to the site please send me an email and I will send you instructions with your passwords and usernames.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Both Meter and myself have to work this entire weekend (in preparation for my trip to Europe Monday) so I am not certain anyone should expect significant event activity.  We will see what happens and perhaps someone will step up and lead an event.  If not, however, please work on your leveling some to increase your power for future events and epic quest trips.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
As I mentioned above, Axxeron and myself are touring Europe Monday, May 7th through Tuesday, May 15.  We will visit Amsterdam, Zurich, and some cities in Germany.  Many of our European brethren will be able to visit with us on this tour and we will be thrilled to post some pics of the event after our return!<br>
<br>
Needless to say we will have our portables with us...SO...even though our activity level in EQ may be decreased some...it will not disapeer completely.  <br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
I had a moment to look at our documented events (PvE) this year and figured I would share the stats.  Here are the events the Dp has done in 2001 to date:<br>
<br>

Plane of Fear (9)<br>
City of Mist (1)<br>
Karnor's Castle (1)<br>
The Hole (3)<br>

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="1">Submitted by <a href="mailto:grayrage@darkenbane.com">Grayrage</a> on 01-05-2001 19:47</font><p>In the dark frightening recesses of Innoruuk's home, The Plane of Hate, Darkenbane brought their prisoner before their master for questioning.  The intense torture and squeazing of this Norrathian Lord began with a serious staring contest as the foul <a href="http://www.darkenbane.com/pictures/21/30/large/9559.jpg"target="_blank">Necromancer Ekimus stood toe to toe with the Lord of the Mortal Realms, Ozuri!</a><br>
<br>
Soon it became apparent the great lord of Norrath was not goin to be easy to break as Ekimus took a breather.  <a href="http://www.darkenbane.com/pictures/107/30/large/9527.jpg"target="_blank">Ozuri thought he too would get a breather, but he did not see the Scum Enchanter Rykker skulking up from behind him!</a><br>
<br>
Soon the battle began between the infamous Rykker and the Lord of Norrath in a <a href="http://www.darkenbane.com/pictures/21/30/large/9560.jpg"target="_blank">battle of wits and fashion sense with Meter as referee!</a> (Rykker and Ozuri had a battle of outfits...Ozuri had to cheat though he started creating stuff ;p)<br>
<br>
The Master of Hate was so displeased with how long it took us to squeeze answers from Ozuri he sent his minion, <a href="http://www.darkenbane.com/pictures/21/205/large/9561.jpg"target="_blank">Maestro</a>, to see to it being done properly.<br>
<br>
Finally, the answers came forth regarding the current policies and rules on our server!  In a rather extensive series of question and answers, GM Ozuri gave not only the FACTS concering the rules on our server, but his own thoughts and beliefs!<br>
<br>
It is my opinion after conversing with him, that Rallos Zek's lead GM enjoys his job very much and is a pure gamer at heart just as you and I are.  He respects our server and the courage it takes to play on it.  His plans for Rallos Zek will include a significant DEREGULATION of "governmental" (Verant) involvement in player affairs.  The server is now for the <b><i>strong</b></i>!!<br>

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="1">Submitted by <a href="mailto:grayrage@darkenbane.com">Grayrage</a> on 28-04-2001 13:23</font><p>In a rather extensive conversation with GM Ozuri, DB was advised that it's activities would be carefully monitored and that any transgression by guildmembers would very likely lead to it's disbanding.  He expressed concern that the guild supported exploits and/or violations of Verant rules and policies.  He was assured that ANY member caught violating the game's rules would be removed so as to preserve our guildstatus in the game.  <br>
<br>
***NOTE TO ALL DBERS:   If you break the game's rules you WILL be removed from the guild.  DO NOT DO IT!<br>
<br>
Here are some excerpts from the warning:<br>
<br>
[Fri Apr 27 18:43:31 2001] Ozuri tells you, 'You're already on your last leg.'<br>
[Fri Apr 27 18:43:36 2001] You told Ozuri, ':('<br>
[Fri Apr 27 18:43:39 2001] You are out of drink.<br>
[Fri Apr 27 18:43:39 2001] Ozuri tells you, 'You know that.'<br>
[Fri Apr 27 18:43:43 2001] Ozuri tells you, '2 suspensions'<br>
<br>
***Note from Gray: He must be referring to DB, cause I have only been suspended once...that I can recall.  DB, however, has been disbanded twice :(<br>
<br>
[Fri Apr 27 18:43:55 2001] Ozuri tells you, 'You breathe funny and even I won't be able to save you'<br>
[Fri Apr 27 18:44:23 2001] Ozuri tells you, 'Well, let me put it this way..'<br>
[Fri Apr 27 18:44:28 2001] You are out of drink.<br>
<br>
***Note from Gray:  mmmmm I need a beer ;p<br>
<br>
[Fri Apr 27 18:44:29 2001] Ozuri tells you, 'If your guild messes up'<br>
[Fri Apr 27 18:44:35 2001] Ozuri tells you, 'I have to hold you accountable'<br>
[Fri Apr 27 18:44:40 2001] You told Ozuri, 'also....If u see anyone in our guild doin something wroung./...could u guys tell me?'<br>
[Fri Apr 27 18:44:46 2001] Ozuri tells you, 'Which will mean disbanding Darkenbane and your account will be forfeit.'<br>
[Fri Apr 27 18:44:53 2001] You told Ozuri, ':('<br>
[Fri Apr 27 18:47:29 2001] Ozuri tells you, 'Just as a tip'<br>
[Fri Apr 27 18:47:35 2001] Ozuri tells you, 'Stay off my radar..'<br>
<br>
I believe the GM desires to ensure that everyone, not just us, follows the guidlines of fair play on our server.  He does not want to disuade PvP or even PKin, but does want to curb stupid crap like: traning, bank killing, portal camping, corpse camping and stupidity in public channels...*cough*.<br>
