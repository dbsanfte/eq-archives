He found that the soldiers of Darkenbane, though deadly murderers, were FAR more honorable and courageous than any of his prior compatriots.  He has sworn his soul and power not just to Innoruuk, but to his brothers as well.</td></tr>

young mage soon became a student of the elements and a true follower of
Innoruuk. Aytowun D'Wode now weilds the true power of the mage, and chars the
flesh of the weak in sacrifice to Innoruuk. He is rumored to be the

<tr><td valign="top"><a href="kills/index.php3?id=8">Damphier</a></td><td valign="top">55</td><td>A new trooper in Darkenbane, Damphier utilizes his considerable power over the mind to sway others into doing his bidding.

His learning began early in life as he tested and experimented on neighboring humans picked from their homes by his skeltal minions. Though not necessarily gaining pleasure from killing or casuing he pain, he cares not whether his research does, in fact have these after effects.  Finding that his experiments have brought some notice from bounty hunters and such, this practicer of the Dark Arts signed onto Darkenbane for mutual protection and for more....subjects to experiment on.</td></tr>

Some say his mind has since been altered by the Father and yet another controls his thinking guided by his foul touch inot causing yet even more painful and torturous death to his victims.

All will atest that seeing the Bringer of Doom up close often brings considerable pain and suffering for his pleasure just prior to the enternal night of death.</td></tr>

Soon, however, he found the change was an error and requested of his former Brethren to fogive him.  They did, but asked thaqt he prove his loyalty by reaping death amongst their foes.

After each day passes, the predominatly Teir Dal Company loses more distrust of this Wood Elf and accepts him and his powers as one of their own.

His bid to become officer is currently under review.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><a href="kills/index.php3?id=30">Tash Alexander</a></td><td valign="top">8</td><td>A High Elven Priest who has found Innoruuk bestows power in a much more ambitious manner than his previous deity.  His recent recruitment came mostly from sickening jabber coming from those who claim to fight for the cause of good.  Lost in world of neutrality, he has decided to utilize his power to aid those who have shown some motivation and set goals instead of those who fill the air with their annoying voices.

Ruling the world has just GOT to be his destiny and if Innoruuk is his route to that end, then so be it.
