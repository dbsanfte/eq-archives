Darkenbane will continue to exist on Sullon Zek and have a presence, but it will be reduced after the departure of many core members.

<br />
<font size="1"><br />
Letter #2: Fri Mar 15 2002, Changes/Anniversary Detail <br />
<p><br />
As promised, we would like to explain in more detail some of the changes that you'll be seeing in EverQuest. <br />
<p><br />
Some of these changes are already available on the Test Server and will be arriving on Live servers just in time for EverQuest's third anniversary. Others you may expect to find on Test in the coming weeks, which we hope to make available to everyone soon afterward. <br />
<p><br />
For those new to EverQuest, as well as our mid-level players: <br />
<p><br />
<li>The need to sit down and stare at the spellbook to regain mana has been removed at all levels. (Sitting down and having Meditation skill are still required.) <br />
<li>When starting a new character for the first time, it can take quite some time to get into that class' core abilities. In some cases, the style of gameplay needs to shift dramatically. That being the case, we've accelerated the rate at which people gain experience up to level ten. <br />
<li>In addition, undue frustration can occur during these youthful times. Traumatic events such as losing a corpse and not knowing where to find it or how to retrieve it can be quite the ordeal. With that in mind, we've changed the way that death works below level ten. Characters level nine and under who die will appear at their bind point with all of their equipment intact. (A short-lived corpse will still be left at the site of the disaster to allow the player to receive a resurrection.) <br />
<li>Experience gained in dungeons designed for players level 30 and under will be increased. For many people, there is nothing more satisfying in EverQuest than adventuring in dungeons. By giving people the tools to help them succeed earlier, and rewards to match, we hope that more players will discover why many people feel this way. <br />
<li>In the spirit of getting characters into more dangerous and rewarding situations, earlier, the following spell lines have been altered to make them easier to use and more widely available, across more level ranges. <br />
<p><br />
* Resurrection, for Clerics and Paladins. <br><br />
* Summon Corpse, for Necromancers and Shadowknights. <br><br />
* Succor/Evacuate, for Druids and Wizards <p><br />
<li>The bind points of starting characters will more closely match the areas they are already familiar with. (No more getting lost as new characters die in town, only to show up someplace outside.) <br />
<li>New characters now start with considerably more food and drink. <br />
<li>After applying advanced mathematcs, the commonly known "hell-level" xperience gain effect in levels 30, 35, 40, and 45 has been largely done away with. Further, the "post-hell-level" experience loss in levels 31, 36, 41, and 46 was driven from the face of Norrath as well. <br />
<p><br />
For all EverQuest players: <br />
<li>Rumors abound that Bristlebane, God of Mischief, for reasons of his own design, has infused the Gnome and Halfling races with new potential professions. (Whether this is a blessing or a curse has yet to be decided.) <br />
<li>The long-requested global chat channels are well on their way. We'll be supporting player-created chat channels for raids, for friends, for total strangers - Anything you'd like to use them for. Expect a documentation update (eqmanual_supplement.doc in your EverQuest directory) explaining how to use these soon. <br />
<li>We've cleaned up what happens while you're zoning. The days of a frozen screen full of blurry text may well be over, forever. (The days of losing /tells, /guild chat, and group messages while zoning will hopefully be heading out the door behind them.) <br />
<li>While we have aimed to support armor/skin layer tinting on the majority of video cards, some of the abandoned video cards that are still used to play EverQuest unfortunately do not have the power to handle this feature. With that in mind, we will soon be implementing a switch that will allow players to enable armor/skin tinting at their discretion. (Stay tuned to a patch message, coming soon.) <br />
<p><br />
The last item we'd like to mention is a brief update on caster and priest rebalancing. (Please note that the balancing act is still going on, across the board. We wanted to update you on the progress we've made so far.) <br />
<p><br />
<li>Expect to see the first of the Focus Items for spell casters and spell-casting hybrids soon. We will leave the specifics to you to discover, but rest assured that useful and exciting focus items are making their way into the game as we speak. <br />
<li>Enchanters' Memory Blur line, and aspects of Rapture and Glamour of Kintaz have been improved. <br />
<li>The grouping requirement for the Translocate series of spells has been removed. <br />
<li>Clerics' Smite line has been improved. <br />
<li>The Post-50 Lich line for Necromancers has been redistributed. <br />
<li>Necromancers' Levant and Skin of the Shadow have been changed to allow them to be used any time of the day. <br />
<li>Necromancers' Quivering Veil of Xarn has been improved. <br />
<li>Many of the caster balance changes to date have been made with feedback from the dedicated players of these classes, both from EMails and message boards. We're grateful for the time and effort that has been put into many well-reasoned comments we've received. <br />
<p><br />
<br />
Thank you for helping us make our world, yours. <br />
<p><br />
- The EverQuest Team <br />

<br />
On Thursday night, Reapers and the evening shift of DB planned a raid on the Plane of Fear.  I was playing Draza and went in to scout whilst the others grouped and prepped.  Coincedentally, SOB ALSO had a Fear run planned and their scouts were zoning in the same time as I (but i was the only one who lived thank you FD ;p).<br />
<br />
In another show of Neutral consolidation (despite our differences), it became a Reapers/DB/SOB raid with folks from FOrza, Honourbound and TOW checking as the evening progressed.<br />
<br />
The break in went reasonbly well with 2 groups goin in carefully and clearing a nice safe niche.  The Chubber (who is the true trainer of DB...sorry Jotok), zoned in and killed us all, however, BUT we were prepared for this (cause we know Chubber so well) and had a cleric on standby (thanks Muddah).  Rezes were done, the rest of the crew came in, the adds and few trained mobs were dispatched and the clearing began in earnest!<br />
<br />
I cannot recall using FD after the main body of the Neutrals arrived.   I am not sure I coulda killed us if I had tried cause all I was doing as puller was repeatedly training 4 to 6 critters on the camp whilst they slaughtered them without effort.  In what may have been the shortest clearing of Fear I have ever seen (about 3 hours), we were ready for the Golems.<br />
<br />
Most of the Fear clearing is done to make way for the mobs we are truly interested in which are the Golems and Epic mobs.  The critters did yield up quite a bit of loot, however, and grats to all the lower level folks who came and geared up some (i know a crapload of carmine dropped, several Pali items, some Ranger goodies...ect).<br />
<br />
So then came the Golems.  All of these dropped pretty easily cept' the one who does the AE nuke for like 500.  He dropped about half of us, but we still got him without to much trouble.  At this point I do not know the exact name of the items that dropped and will get it later to post here, but Muddah did end up with a cool cleric weapon, Subb got Bloodfire (the warrior weapon that procs Bloodboil), Axxy got some Bard flute thingy.<br />
<br />
Ekomsdog, Onec, Slobbish and Grunter (the Broken Golem was up too) all got their epic pieces as well.<br />
<br />
For a raid that lasted 4 hours from beginning (when i went in to scout) to end, yielding so much stuff for the Neutral Team, it was a smashing success.  I will try to get some exact descriptions of the Golem loot also.  Great job to all who were involved.<br><br></td></tr>

<br />
In the thread linked below, most everyone admitted there was an extreme inbalance in the way the Teams were created and then evolved with the exception of Ranadiel (the leader of Malignant who is prolly one of those guys who should keep quiet and be THOUGHT a fool than to open his maw and be KNOWN a fool) who stated that the reason the evil team is better is because the more skilled players of Everquest chose the Evil team.<br />
<br />
Although I do not know if her reply was to him (who was about the only person who claimed the teams were balanced), but she did make a CLEAR indication that she is AWARE the teams are inbalanced AND that Manaburn/Lifeburn are out of place in PvP.   Here is the quote:<br />
<br />
<font size="2">I am going to lock this thread as well, and do what has been requested. 4 nights next week I will be holding PvP discussion meetings for each of the PvP servers in EverQuest chat. I will be announcing the times and dates of those chats hopefully later today or Monday morning.<br />
I am not commenting because I am listening, I want to hear what others think, so does the development team.<br />
<br />
Normally I will not debate on issues, but I will state this. <br />
<br />
There is about as much chance of talking me into believing that the darks are an evenly balanced team in means of raw numbers and starting locations as me believing manaburn is perfectly tuned for PvP combat. =)<br />
<br />
Those that wish to smite me for those words, I will see you at the discussions. =)<br />

My post at the above link reads as follows:<br />
<br />
This subject is important to all the people who play on the PvP server and more specifically on SZ.  As such, I will take the time to write an extensive post regarding the issues of PvP and support them accordingly with potential solutions.  My post will discuss each issue that I believe is a SERIOUS problem that needs to be addressed regarding PvP on SZ  in  sections with the contents as follows:<br />
<br />
1. Team Balance<br />
2. Golem Wands/Recharging of items<br />
3. Manaburn/Lifeburn<br />
4. Horses<br />
5. Water Fighting<br />
6. Zones<br />
7. Spell Damage Nerf<br />
<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Before the server went live many people pointed out the glaring problems with the teams.  All pretty much unanimously agreed the Evil Team was by far the most favored and the Goody Team was doomed.  Sony ignored the posts and continued as planned which ultimately turned out to be WRONG.  The reason is as follows:<br />
<br />
Team Make Up and geography -  <br />
<br />
Evil - This team has Iksars, Ogres, Trolls and DEs (99%) all to themselves.  They SHARE the following races: Barbarians (33%), Humans (33%), Erudites (33%), Gnomes (33%), Humans (33%), Wood Elves (33%) and Half Elves (33%).  This gives them 4 exclusive races and 11 available races.  This gives them 3 classes with Instant Kill abilities (HT, Manaburn, Lifeburn).   This gave them the starting areas virtually UNCONTESTED of  Nektulos, LS (with Sol and Nerana dungeons), Fearot  (with CT dungeon), Innothule Swamp (with Guk) and ALL of Kunark.  Their mandatory (where conflict was GOING to happen) PvP borders consisted of only fighting in WC and SK against the Neutral Team for those zones.<br />
<br />
Neutral - This team has Halfings (99%) and Dorfs exclusively to themselves.  They SHARE the following races:  DE (1%), Barbarian (33%), Half Elf (33%), Wood Elf (33%), Human (33%), High Elf (50%), Erudite (33%) and Gnomes (33%).  This gives them 2 exclusive races and allows them the chance to be 10 races total. They have one instant kill class (manaburn).The original uncontested zones included Misty (with RE Dungeon), HPH and area, Butcherblock (with Unrest).  The PvP border and mandatory conflict zones included WC (evils), SK (evils), BB/Fay zone (goodies), EF/BB/QH (goodies), SF/LF (goodies/evils).<br />
<br />
Goody - This team currently has only Cat People as exclusively to them (but NO exclusive races when server was born).  They had the option of being the following races: Barb (33%), Human (33%), Gnome (33%), High Elf (50%), Wood Elf (33%), Half Elf (33%) and  Erudites (33%).  This gives them ONE exclusive race and the availability to be 8 races.  Geographically the goodies had ZERO uncontested areas and eventually carved out a spot in EF/Perma as well as Gfay/LFay/KK/Crushbone.   The goodies always either fought over zones or contested zones with Neutrals only but in ALL of their zones because they always bordered neutral uncontested areas.  This is what has/had lead tot he animosity between the Neutral/Goody teams.<br />
<br />
The evil team having 4 races exclusive, 3 insta kill classes and 11 races potentially for creation exceeds the Neutral teams 2 exclusive races, 10 available races and 1 instant kill class and FAR exceeds the good team's 1 exclusive race (which came long after SZ was born), 8 available races and single insta kill class.  Additionally, the evil team's multitude of uncontested zones early in the life of the server gave them the ability to avoid PvP entirely if they so desired whilst the Neutral and goody teams were constantly battling for lands.  For these reasons, I am comfortable in stating that Sony failed to create our server with balanced Teams and is the primary reason why it's population dropped so dramatically (because if the teams were balanced Neutral and Goody would have the same numbers as evil).<br />
<br />
A better team makeup would have been as follows (and one that can still exist if you follow my proposed solution):<br />
<br />
Evil - Ogre, Troll, Iksar, DE, Human (33%), Erudite (33%)<br />
Neutral - Halfing, Gnome, Dorf, Barbarian, Human (33%), Erudite (33%)<br />
Goody - High Elf, Wood Elf, Half Elf, Cat Dude, Human (33%), Erudite (33%)<br />
<br />
The only class restrictions would be as follows:<br />
<br />
SK - Evil only<br />
Ranger - Neutral/Goody Only<br />
Paladin - Goody/Neutral Only<br />
<br />
Possible solutions for fixing the balance problems:<br />
<br />
Revamp all PvP servers - Create 3 PvP servers with the RZ, SZ and TZ/VZ rule sets.   Allow anyone to move log between the new servers one time with all gear.  For people already on SZ allow them to switch their race to remain on their team (IE: DE wizzies changing to Gnome).  Keep the 1 character per account (to prevent cross teaming) and consider making a language for each team that is unrecognizable and learnable by their foes.  Institute a NO SAME TEAM TRAINING rule, because it is impossible to stop your own teammate from doing this, but otherwise leave the rule set alone.  Additionally, expand the points system more and add some cool stats for this.  Everyone in ANY kind of gaming likes to fool with statistics.<br />
<br />
Nerf the Evil Team - This possibility involves returning the evil team exp modifiers back to normal whilst leaving the other teams where they are.  The trouble with this is that many evil team members are DONE expin' and it will not effect them.  Another possibility is to make the max rez for PvP death on the evil team 50%.  Allowing evil to attack each other might also help to balance the scales.   The power behind the evil team is their ability to exp and raid safely due tot heir geographic and numerical superiority.  If they must worry about more enemies, this will significantly cut down on this advantage whilst surely not destroying them as the high end guilds will surely make alliances and such just as they do on RZ where they do not kill each other.   The trouble with this is that there really will not be much evil on evil killing as killing one of their own team will make them a "PKer" just like on RZ where they are outcast from the community.  IF, however, they made an evil on evil PvP kill a single item loot situation, this truly might be an option that will effect and slow them down some.<br />
<br />
Merge Goody and Neutral - I have sat in The Bazaar for considerable periods of time and am astonished that the Evil Team actually outnumbers the Neutrals and Goodies present by 2 to 1 and out levels them still.  I am not sure that such a merger would actually SOLVE the problem at all unless possibly combined with some of the Evil team Nerfs mentioned above.  It would help in perhaps finding groups easier, but I am not sure it is a solution.   I far prefer the first solution.<br />

Golem Wands have 5 charges of Pillage Enchantment, which removes 4 buffs from the target.  This item has no cast time and can be used while running.  In battle this item WILL remove ALL buffs from its target effectively taking that individual out of battle by simply clicking the item on them.  This item is detrimental to PvP as it creates an extreme imbalance in combat as it will automatically make the target desire to flee the confrontation or to be killed with relative ease.  Add to this the ability to "recharge" these items and you have a situation where PvP becomes impossible against those who are using the item and the exploit to keep the item charged forever.<br />
<br />
The most important thing to fix regarding this issue is the recharging of the items.  Camped legitimately these items would not be prevalent enough to cause any long-term harm to PvP.  But when they are constantly in the hands of a few folks who ALWAYS use them as if it was a skill, it is a huge problem.  To fix this all that needs to be done is the item to be given LORE/NO DROP status.  End of problem.  The same should be done with other wands such as Conflag Wands and Life Tap Wands.<br />

Manaburn and Lifeburn has been addressed by many here and it seems is unanimously agreed upon to be detrimental to PvP.  Let me cover some basic problems with these spells:<br />
<br />
1. The Evil Team has 3 instant kill abilities (HT, Manaburn, Lifeburn) whilst the Neutral and Goody teams have one (Manaburn).<br />
<br />
2. These spells prevent PvP as many will flee from pvP instead of risk being instantly killed.<br />
<br />
3. These spells mock the thought that any skill in PvP should exist or DOES exist.  Why bother outfitting yourself for PvP or practicing certain skills in PvP combat if someone can simply kill you instantly regardless of any planning or practice you might have done?  It makes a joke of any pretense that some skill is involved in PvP, otherwise I would like to see these spells used in the TBOTB competitions.<br />
<br />
4. These spells will eventually lead to the PvP servers being ONLY Wizards and Necros.<br />
<br />
Solution - Make these spells PvE only.  Both Necros and Wizards have plenty of PvP power to survive these being taken out of the PvP game.<br />

Horses are a nifty addition to EQ and surely a lot of fun, but they have caused a great deal of problems for PvP.  Along with the multitude of bugs whereby one cannot hit someone on a horse (getting an out of range message even when they are right next to you), it is a simple PvP imbalance that some folks can run as fast as a Bard without actually being a Bard.  It is hard enough as it is to follow people who have SOW on let alone someone with Bard speed ALL of the time.  The fact of the matter is that PvP needs to be SLOWED down so that lag and hill bugging is not such a huge factor in combat.  <br />
<br />
Solution possibilities:<br />
<br />
1. Make it so you automatically dismount from your horse if engaged in combat (like Bard travel Song).<br />
2. Get rid of Horses on PvP servers.<br />
3. Only allow the 60k horses on PvP.<br />

I know the reason that we cannot cast on our fellow players in the water is to prevent a tank from fighting a mob IN the water while a cleric OUTSIDE the water HEALS him with immunity from the mob.  The trouble with this is EXTREMELY frustrating PvP where people exploit this by running in and out of the water to avoid spell hits.  This gives a major advantage to those with better connections and also deters PvP, as many won't even bother fighting if water is nearby.<br />
<br />
Solutions:<br />
<br />
1. Enable aggressive spells on players in the water whilst keeping beneficial ones disabled.<br />
2. Make water mobs summon.<br />
3. Make water mobs more like Kelorek Dar who can come out of the water to attack people.<br />

Zones are a commons source of problems and exploits in PvP.  The following TWO are the most glaring troubles:<br />
<br />
Zone Tag - This is when a player lingers near a zone knowing he is only a few steps away from safety and thus virtually immune from PvP attack.  The player then is free to act however he wants with no consequence or worry about PvP death.  If attacked he simply zones back and forth until he loses his foe.  Then he heals up or meds and continues the "game" of zone tag.<br />
<br />
Solution - Force a mandatory time limit on REZONING where a player must wait at least 1 or 2 minutes before being allowed to zone a second time.<br />
<br />
Zone Plugging - This is where a person pulls his modem cord right as he zones that has the effect of instantly camping a person and saving him from a possible PvP death.<br />
<br />
Solution - Make the plugged person appear on the opposite side of the zone LD and killable.<br />

With the advent of Vellious and SOL, players have proven the ability to get enormous Hps and resists bonuses over when the game originally started.  Ice Comet used to be an instant kill spell, but now many casters could easily survive 6 hits from it let alone a fully buffed 60th level warrior with 6k hps.  The fact of the matters is that the spell damage nerf was an outdated thing, which is no longer appropriate.  Removing it will allow casters to get back in the fight with the melees that wield such things as Primal Weapons and TOV gear with 150+ to all resists.  It is my believe that taking away this nerf will still require considerable time and casting by enemies who are prepared for such combat.<br><br></td></tr>

In the evening word went out to the Neutral Alliance members that Ragefire was up and it was determined that Jaxon was to receive the piece for the epic.  RF went down relatively easily netting not only Jax his epic, but also Axxy one of her last parts for her epic (Red Dragon Scale...she only needs one piece now).<br />
<br />
While there, the alliance decided to clear the GWs and take out Talendor.  Talendor dropped a bracer and boots as well as some spells (netting me Sunstrike and Onec Talisman of the Raptor).<br />
<br />
Amid the recent desertion by many Neutral Team members to the new Legends Server (I heard there was 120 people in TOV last night on that server), it was good to see the Neutral Alliance pull together 35 folks for an event.  We are still not pleased that Sony continues to ignore our requests for fixing such an extreme issues as Manaburn/Lifeburn.<br><br></td></tr>
