You might notice a link the Ladder section over to your left.  This is a project we are workin' on right now that should be set up soon.  It will be an ongoing PvP tourney where all DBer can fight each other and will be ranked based on their performance!!  It will be interactive as challenges, wins and losses will have have notes posted by the combatants!  A FAQ will be posted explaining how it works and the rules so don't bug me about it ;p<br>
<br>
F.Y.I. the ladder rankings shown now are temporary as u must have a win to get on the ladder in the first place and be ranked.<br><br></td></tr>

WOW!  Upon closer inspection, however, I saw many who were not actually active at all.   So i broke out Mr. Broom and swept them all into the KIA folder.  If you accidentally got caught in the broom, please send me an email requesting i fix it!!!<br>
<br>
I was thinkin' how nice it would be to do this sort of house cleaning in EVERQUEST!  How nice would it be if the guildleader could do a command like /guildlist and his entire guild list would come up.  Then he could /guildremove name and that person would be removed regardless of whther they were online or not.<br>
<br>
I will start a thread about that very subject onthe EQ forum and will post a link here if you guys agre it is a good idea.  I, for one, would LOVE to go through our list....<br><br></td></tr>

As gay as they are, they are OUR server homos and we want them to kick ass in the multi-server event!  Good luck Sabbat!!  Kick their asses!<br>
<br>
The win came amid controversy as the 3rd place Family of Peace team complained and protested that they should be allowed to brng MOBs for training.  Their protest was noted, but demands were denied.  Without being able to Train they switched to their next best tactics of /q.  This led to their disqualification.<br>
<br>
Also losing in the semi-final round was one of the Swarm of Fear teams which put in a good showing. Great fights and VERY entertaining!  Thanks all!<br>
<br>
After attending this last Test of Tactics, I have come to the conclusion that DB is prepared and able to compete in the next ToT!  As of this moment it is DB's official annoucement that they WILL field a team for the NEXT ToT and will bring upwords of 100 vicious killers flying the DB flag to root on their Brethren!<br>

Most often it is something we laugh at.  Sometimes we get the opportunity dispell these myths and expose liars for what they are *cough* Ordieth *cough*.<br>
<br>
In an earlier News post, DB showed the logs for two attacks on Fear over the weekend with some screen caps.  The clealy show DB destroyed it's foes without the use of underhanded tactics, yet the accusations came anyhow.  In a well written article by Meter, several accusers are exposed as frauds making excuses for their own inabilties to do anything, but die.  He documents it all in well retained documentary of screen shots.<br>
