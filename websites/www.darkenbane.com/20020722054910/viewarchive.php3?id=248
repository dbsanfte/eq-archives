<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="1">Submitted by <a href="mailto:grayrage@darkenbane.com">Grayrage</a> on 22-12-2001 21:42</font><p>It's been a while since I have done a news post and I apologize.  I plan to do more updates logging our daily activities.  Anyhow, there is ALOT of stuff I need to cover as follows:<br />
<br />
1. Shadows of Luclin released<br />
2. Darkenbane members mutiny!<br />
3. More epics<br />
4. The destruction of the foe.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
The expansion for Everquest has been released and most of the early bugs have been ironed out.   I feel comfortable giving my opinion of this new expansion based on our extensive play.<br />
<br />
The upgrade helped firm up my decision to purchase a new puter and, it seems, this was a good thing.  The game now takes ENORMOUS system requirments that my old puter is just helpless against.  It is my opinion that if you are going to play a game...play it with all the bells and whistles to get the most from it. Luckily, I can now.<br />
<br />
The results of needing a super puter to run EQ has yielded a new graghics engine that is just awe inspiring.  I cannot get over the new facial expressions of the new models and their motions.  Heck...I get horney looking up Talya's skirt.   lemee tell YOU...some crack should sure as hell be able to give us a nudie version to play with....hmm well I am getting off topic.<br />
<br />
Anyhow...it is MY opinion the new models are great and the new textures are nice as well.  Add to that the entire new world...and...WOW.  Luclin is just incredible.  Zone after zone of just plain NEAT shit.  I have not yet seen a zone that did not have some nifty orginality and great artwork.  The new critters are no less impressive with some really snazzy effects.  <br />
<br />
It does not end there though, as SOE added not just the new content and it's nice new spells, but the SKILLZ.  Holy SHITZ batman!!!  This is SO damn deep.  I just do not see the game EVER ending and FINALLY it is possible to become a GOD (which is really what I am, you see).  There is just SO much you can do and the world is just SO damn big.....I just can't begin to understand how they did it.<br />
<br />
A big fat woody to SOE for not only keeping up EQ, but improving it beyond my most sincere expectations.   <br />
<br />
Now to the bad things.  Lemee make a list:<br />
<br />
1. Water bug (PvP) - It is beyond stupid that all someone has to do to avoid getting hit with a spell is run in and out of the water.  Fix this.<br />
<br />
2. Zone plug (PvP) - It is one of the most annoying things that people can avoid PvP death by simply unplugging their puters when zoning.  Make it so they pop out the other side LD.<br />
<br />
3. Zone tag - make it so it is impossible to zone a second time until 30 seconds has passed.  Also makle a "line" where the first person who crosses a zone...is the first person who will appear regardless of system specs to take away that advantage.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It was a dark day when the officers and core of Darkenbane decided to overthrow their leader and take their own course.  A dark day indeed.  When the dust cleared and the blood was wiped clear of our eyes, DB lost many of it's lower level folks and some former core people.  One notable member who was lost in the scuffle is the infamous bard, Agrul.  Some others may be rooted out soon and follow him inot the wastes....<br />
<br />
The guild has since recovered and moves forward with renewed vigor and loyalty as the leadership has consolidated it's power.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
We farmed the General yielding Rogue epics (when they get all their robes) for Kalu (58), Chronoburn (56) and Fudly (55).  Grats to all you little backstabbers =p   Afterward we popped KD again (we kill him quite a bit) which yielded haste cloaks for Lethdar and Traeumer.  Buncha junk dropped too.<br />
<br />
We have also done some minor events as well including Lord Dojo a few times in Velks who dropped some silly Monk crapola.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
Sitting over the huge corpse of Kelorek Dar, the wizard Grunter (who is just the baddest Gnome ever created in the molds of Gnomes who are actually the rulers of the Universe..../cackle) pondered the suggestion made by some of his minions that it was time we moved to the castle where the infamous Venril Sathir calls home.  Speaking to his counterpart, Saii (the ninja dude), they agreed to gather their forces to kill this creature which holds some items of power that they needed.<br />
<br />
Gathering the forces of Darkenbane and SOB, these leaders brought their minions to The Dreadlands where they swept aside the meager resistance offered by their foes.  Entering Karnor's Castle (VS's home), they found it quiet and forboding.  Without hesitation they moved in killing Venril's guards until they met the creature face to face.<br />
<br />
The battle was engaged, but the forces of Darkenbane and SOB did not expect such terrific resistance by the monster as he cast incredible spells which killed many of the fighters whilst giving him back his health.  The only way it seemd to kill him was by protecting the attackers with rune spells which could only be cast by enchanters.   Having only ONE enchanter was what foretold our doom as VS waded through the ranks of his foes decimating them one at a time until they were all dead or forced to flee.<br />
<br />
Soon thereafter the foe (the evils) of these powerful guilds sent missives exclaiming their glee at our misfortune.  They claimed the victory for themselves even though they had naught to do with it and, what's more, claimed they would stop us from retrieving our fallen and bringing them back to life!<br />
<br />
Alas, we expected this from the foe whom many of us refer to as 'sheep' because of their weaknesses and inability to do anything but follow the crowd.  We expected and planned for it.   All went to sleep.....<br />
<br />
....and awoke together.  Quickly and quietly the remaing forces of DB and SOB gathered and struck the unorganized foe who were "guarding" their brethrens' corses.  The decimation was complete as the foe fell like butter before a hot knife.   Soon, the brethren had recovered their fallen and Venril knew fear at the renewed anger and power of his enenmies from the night before.  In the end, he died and gave up his goodies.<br />
<br />
-Ruin slaughtered and plugged.<br />
<br />
-Hate slaughtered and plugged.<br />
<br />
-Misc evils just...dead.<br />
<br />
-VS down, dropping TWO cobalt legs (grats Kulu and Smoke).<br />
<br />
As of this writing, the forces of DB and SOB are scouring the land for the last living foes who flee and scatter before their might and then heading to Chardock to finish farming the lands they have stolen from the sheep.<br><br></td></tr>
