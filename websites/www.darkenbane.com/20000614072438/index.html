<p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" size "3">I am again formatting pictures and preparing another big update.  Make sure your kill pics are sent in .jpg or .gif form to darkenbane@beer.com and, if you can, try to zip em up.  It is easier for me that way. Additionally, I am finding that alot of kills are coming in without being /guildstated.  It is not necessary to guildstat some while u fight them.  You can do it before or after or even 2 days later, but try to let me know what guild your victim feebly fights to defend against our might!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" size "3">Many important items come up about the development of EQ and corrections or errors and problems in gameplay on the EQ gameplay forum.  I will monitor this forum and try to put up some important issues here for you to visit and voice your thoughts on.  Many times the EQ personel won't even look at a post unless enough people voice their concern.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="8080C0" size="3">I believe one of our biggest problems in game today for both the PvE server AND our server is TARGETING.  Let's face it,  targeting in EQ sucks and really needs improvement.  This post also contains some info about a RZ GM warning DB that we will be disbanded if ANY of our members get another in game warning.  This post can be visited <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050263.html">Here. </a> Please visit this post and voice your support regarding changes to targeting and add any other thoughts you might have.</font></p><br>

Hannabal Castermaster was not just a DB Dreadknight and a hated murdering scum...he was a gamer and a friend to us all.  In the following missive sent by one of Hannabal's real life friends, we have been advised that he was slain by a drunk driver just a few short days ago. *bows head*  We will miss you bro and your character will grace the 'murdering scum' section of DB for eternity.

I am a close friend to Haanibal Castermaster in RL..On thursday May 25, 2000 only 3 days after receiving his driver's liscense he was struck by a drunk driver and killed on impact...the fire department stated that he died almost immeadiatelly, I know you and your guild because he spoke of you often and i also play on Rallos Zek...I am auctioning his account on Ebay,he wanted me to do that if anything ever happened to him. Do me a favor..he liked this game alot, and Iknow he had many friends can you please try and let the guild know and some of his freinds as well...I will no longer be playing EQ, or else I would do it myself..any further information..HC in RL was Barry Prettyman, HS sophomore..16 yrs. old, good friend of mine, we played for the football team, other teen stuff like that,his big brother gave him Haan as a birthday present when he left for college, ever since that was all He did. I have to go now. Please pray for his family. If the guild wold like his character's belongings i know the pw and login name for his account I could maybe help them out.<br>

            <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" size="3">Graraige
            D'Bane walks quickly past one of the DB compound
            structures. He hurries, knowing and feeling that the
            Father prepares to summon him. Before reaching the
            ominous Keep where he sleeps between forays, he
            realizes it is to late as the world swims under him.
            No longer even trying to walk, the feared Teir' Dal
            simply stops and waits allowing his God to bring him
            how he will to his presence.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" size="3">Unlike
            his usual experience with interdimensional portals,
            Graraige never has gotten used to being called by his
            deity. Beyond the sickening wrench to his reality,
            the fetid odor of death and destruction and the
            horrifyingly pleasant screams of others in agony, he
            simply did not enjoy the loss of total control the
            transfer took from him.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" size="3">Suddenly,
            without any fanfare, the control of his body was
            returned to him and his vision cleared. There, before
            him, stood the body of darkness known to many as the
            Father, Innoruuk. ON this visit the Father did not
            take on a visible corporal form, instead seemingly in
            a pleasant mood, remained in a vaporous trasparent
            cloud. His spirit, however, was quite clearly present
            as he spoke to his child.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" size="3">&quot;I
            am pleased with Majstic D'Bane's progress organizing
            and leading the purge. His chosen officers please me
            as well. It is time to begin the next...phase of the
            purge. Offer amnesty to all who pledge fealty to me
            and unite them under Darkenbane's banner. All houses
            who pledge loyalty to me THROUGH Darkenbane will be
            allowed to act on my behalf in the conquest of the
            mortal realms.&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" size="3">&quot;Advise
            Captain Majstic to continue the purge destroying ALL
            who fail to pledge in my behalf through Darkenbane.
            The time has come to begin increasing your numbers on
            the mortal plains in preparation for my coming.&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" size="3">There
            was a short pause and the air became noticeably
            charged. Graraige knew when his Lord was agitated.
            The Father's next words were no louder than before..nor
            was the tone different, but the force behind it left
            no doubt in the Teir Dal's mind that failure would
            not be tolerated by the Dark God.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" size="3">&quot;Although
            we must unite those who desire my favor, I will not
            tolerate the pretenders. Bring our numbers higher, my
            tool, but do NOT allow the infidels to live who
            continue to use my name for their own reasons. The
            mortals who serve me will do so through my tools in
            Darkenbane and if they pledge not to service, they
            MUST BE DESTROYED! DO not FAIL ME!&quot;</font></p>

            Mortal Tools on Norrath! The Father has advised his
            minions that his plan to mold the world of Norrath in
            his image is well under way. The recruits to his main
            tool on the mortal lands are growing in numbers and
            quality. His hands bring in more killers each day and
            he continues to order the execution of ALL pretenders!

            Teir' Dal that have NOT sworn their allegiance to him
            through Darkenbane! Any of these infidels MUST be

            He has, however, determined that Soulstrike's term
            for leadership of the Father's Weapon (Darkenbane)
            has come to an end. The New Phase for his plans on

            <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" size="3">Some
            discussion has come up regarding the viability of
            dueling whilst being one of the most hated (by the
            disbelievers) group in the soon to be scourged land
            of Norrath. Alec has proven that dueling with folks
            is possible in many situations, however, these
            situations are based on the so called 'honor' of the
            foe. The best we can do is 'blacklist' guilds or
            people that do not abide the rules of engagement in
            duels. Let me explain:</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" size="3">As a
            former Leader of this mighty Guild, I often receive
            multiple challenges to duel and accept them when
            possible or feasible. On the 2nd day of Feb. in the
            year 2000 i was asked again to duel by some unknown
            person in an obscure guild (Seekers of Divinity I
            believe). He claimed to be a 28th level Cleric which
            is far to low for someone with my power to bother
            with, but he insisted, claiming he had the ability to
            destroy me.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" size="3">Shrugging
            at his deathwish, I decided to grant his and Innoruuk's
            wish and seperate his soul from the earthly planes. I
            waited until he was buffed and medded then went with
            the duel. Almost immediately this clown jumped into
            the water staying right on the edge so that he could
            go in and out before i could cast a spell. Utilizing
            this obvious exploit and bug (time to fix this
            programmers) I could not even to get a root off
            without him being opposite of me and thus protected
            from my spells. Soon thereafter, two guildmembers of
            this weasle came into the picture and began casting
            on me (one found himself to low whilst the other's
            pathetic attempts bounced off my powerful
            enchantments of protection). Realizing this was their
            pathetic attempt at a trap i leisurely left the area
            to call for aid.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" size="3">Soon 2
            friends from Orden (the German Killers) came into the
            zone and chased the helper out of the zone, but it
            mattered not as the weasley sort simply kept up the
            little exploit of running in and out of the water. No
            DBers in his level range were availble to sit in the
            water while i sat out of the water before I got bored
            of the entire thing.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" size="3">This
            is why such as myself and other high profile figures
            cannot spend the time and effort dealing with such
            peasants as these. In their little pathetic lives the
            only existance they know is the waves and shadows of
            others. In their feeble attempt at touching those
            greater than they, another part of the game is taken
            away from others who truly wish to duel such as me.
            So do not get angry with me when I either decline
            your offer at a duel or simply don't answer you at
            all....look toward little, reaching, 'wanna be cool'
            guilds like Seekers of Divinity for the cause behind
            it.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" size="3">As a
            final thought, ask yourself the question of who is
            truly deserved of your scorn in a world such as
            Norrath. A Guild such as Darkenbane, that openly
            declares their desire to bring death and destruction
            to all and accepts all foes to their supremcy, or a
            group such as Seekers of Divinity that used exploits
            to gain attention and, in their feeble efforts at
            gaining mine and others notice, ruined another part
            of the game.</font></p>

            Verant will punish us for simply playing the role we
            are supposed to. Let's keep in mind, however, that
            corpse camping, exploits and harrasment are
            considered illegal by Verant and we must be cautious
            NOT to do these things. We must also be aware that
            our many victims will surely submit petitions and /reports
            to Verant regarding us and are often exaggerated.
            With this in mind we must walk a tight rope and a

            many know, KAAOS Guild is renowned for their farsical
            tales and manipulations of the truth. Often
            Darkenbane simply ignores their repetative posts on
            the bullentin boards about how 'they won this and
            they won that'. They surely have many members and if
            all of those members spam our and their boards enough
            many will even begin to believe they actually
            defeated the Mighty Darkenbane in the war.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" size="3">It
            truly does get old answering each of their slanderous
            claims of victory. Everyday it seems KAAOS comes to
            our boards with claims of grandour and defeat. A
            passerby might even be inclined to believe it's
            validity if they were not aware of the nature of
            KAAOS Members (beyond their known homosexuality and
            affiliation with N.A.M.B.L.A.). This really did not
            become truly apparent, though, until even the new GM
            of DB (Lord Ever Killimunchkin hehe) posted a
            response to KAAOS about the 'New DB' and that 'any
            defeats DB has had in the past are meaniless'. I am
            here now to explain to Ever and anyone else who has
            been duped by KAAOS propaganda lies, that Darkenbane
            may have lost some battles with KAAOS, but they
            surely never lost the war.</font></p>

            compiling Darkenbane's side of the Feud complete with
            many screan caps of the slain KAAOS. Please keep in
            mind that unlike KAAOS, DB has many OTHER foes and
            does not necessarily count KAAOS as any more
            importnat than the others. With this in mind many
            slayings of KAAOS were not capped because of their
            lack of importance and thus are not available for
            review. One must then imagine that for every picture

            <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" size="3">With
            the reorganization of Darkenbane we have reset the
            passwords to the private areas and tactics boards.
            Please contact Graraige at grayrage@hotmail.com or
            Ever at lord_killuminati@hotmail.com for the
            verification and password info. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" size="3">Additionally,
            Darkenbane invitations are currently limited. An
            aspirant must prove his prowess in battle completing
            various tasks inclding the defeat of a current member
            selected by the guild for the test. Don't bother
            asking to get in if you cannot handle yourself VERY
            well in battle and are not prepared to become a tool
            of destruction and death in Norrath.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" size="3">Many
            other guilds in the land have cried that Darkenbane
            is picking on them and ask for clemency in our
            clensing of the land. We do NOT kill those who truly
            follow the tenats of EVIL and Innoruuk's will!
            Innoruuk himself has spoken to our mighty leader,
            EVER, and proclaimed us his messenger of death! If
            these other organizations truly wish to follow
            Innoruuk's will and be immune from his sentence, they
            MUST declare their fealty to the mighty Lord of
            Hatred by serving Darkenbane's wishes and will!
            Declare your fealty to Innoruuk and Darkenbane and
            join the vengence on the puny mortals we have begun!</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" size="3">Everyone
            has asked and desired our screen cap page to be
            completed. It is almost done so please be patient! We
            have several hundred kill pics to organize and
            catalog so it is a time consuming process, but it
            will be fun and entertaining when all is done!</font></p>

            God Innoruuk sends Lord Ever Killuminachus back to us

            comes among us with Words for all of the Lord's
            Children (see the 'Charter' section soon to be up).
            In the wake of this vast Darkness comes the beloved
            hatred so desired and expected of Innoruuk's children!
            He hath decreed the Death Sentence for all who do not
            follow his will and this Sentence includes many who
            appear to be followers, but instead have been found
            Heretics and Pretenders only. Many so called Tier Dal,
            Trolls and Ogres who claim allegiance to Innoruuk
            have been seen interacting with lesser mortal
            grovelers to the other Gods. These PRETENDERS have
            been seen HEALING, BUFFING and otherwise treating the
            lesser mortals as EQUALS. With these actions they
            prove themselves untrue to the Darkness Innoruuk
            demands of his worshippers!</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" size="3">A call
            goes forth to those who pray to the Mighty Innoruuk
            to swear fealty to him and Darkenbane! In this you
            will be known by the Darkness as true and wilt be
            given power over the lesser Mortals in Norrath! Any
            who FAIL to swear and show their devotion to the
            Mighty God will be known as traitor to him. None will
            be spared his WRATH when the Darkness covers the
            Earth puny MORTALS!</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" size="3">All
            bow before the Mighty Innorruk and praise his
            messenger, Lord Ever Killuminachus, GM of Darkenbane
            and Bringer of DOOM!</font></p>
