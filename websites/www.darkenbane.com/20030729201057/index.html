I am not sure what is goin' on in Shadowbane, but it looks like the guys are goin' good on Scorn.  Somehow it looks like they are back being allied with TB (which, imho, is not a bad thing) and are having a good time.  I truly do not pay attention to the game's progress beyond seeing some screen shots which shows they are still enjoying the game.<br />

<br />
Our planetside crew is going real strong now with at LEAST a full squad (10 DBers) on each night.  We have several squad leaders now and always have all DB squads going regardless of the size.  Some changes Sony is making in the near future involve the addition of platoons (where multiple squads are linked by a commander) and outfit captures of bases (which puts your guild's name on bases we capture).   We are looking forward to this, but need to add more folks to successfully take and hold a DB base :)<br />
<br />
Here is a recent quote taken from a PR guy at Sony about some upcoming changes to PS (click <i><b><a href="http://forums.darkenbane.com/showthread.php?s=&threadid=3266">HERE</a></i></b> to discuss on our forums):<br />
<br />
<i><b>"As promised, here is a general breakdown on the Lattice Logic Module as it is currently being planned. Certain variables in the design have not yet been nailed down, but I wanted to get you all a basic understanding and give you the opportunity to ask questions on it. <br />
When an Empire hacks a base, the Lattice Logic Module will spawn in a random location somewhere in the base and players will be notified of its approximate location. A player will then need to locate and pick up the Module by running over it. There are certain restrictions, including the fact that MAX units may not pick it, and Infiltrators may pickup up, but cannot cloak while carrying it. <br />
<br />
Next, the player must deliver the module to a friendly base that is one Lattice link away. If there is more than one linked friendly base, the delivery base will be chosen at random. The player carrying the Module will begin to glow, advertising that they are carrying the Module, and will be marked by a pulsating icon on the proximity map. That player is then unable to drive any vehicles or board any air vehicles. They may be a passenger or gunner in any land vehicle. Land vehicles carrying a player with the Module will have their speed restricted somewhat and be unable to board a Galaxy. <br />
<br />
The module has a lifespan in which it must be delivered. If it is not delivered to its destination within that lifespan, it will decay and the hack on the enemy base will fail. The Module itself can be dropped, but not destroyed in the player’s inventory. Its properties will not allow it to be stored in vehicle trunks or in lockers and it will despawn if it is dropped in lava or deep water. If the carrier dies, the Module will remain active and drop near their corpse. <br />
<br />
The defending Empire cannot retrieve a dropped Module that is still active. Instead, they must guard its location until the Module’s lifespan runs out. The effective defense pursuing a moving Module will want to identify and set up forces at any chokepoints that may exist or organize ambushes on the Module carrier. The effective offense will set up a convoy to escort the Module carrier to their destination and send out advance forces to deal with roadblocks set up by the defenders."</b></i><br />
<br />
The way it is set up now, most fights take place at bases and are somewhat repetative.  We are hoping this new system of capturing bases will force fights into the countryside where bridges, high ground, forests and cover will become far more prominant.  Should be neat.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />

Blizzard has released the information on the lands of the Nightelves!  The link to the site to review the entire addition is <i><b><a href="http://www.blizzard.com/wow/townhall/kalidar.shtml">HERE.</a></i></b> I have taken the liberty of tossing a few screw caps up for your perusal.

We have had considerable debate about what sort of PvP WoW is gonna have and whether or not Blizzard is taking us seriously as PvP enthusiasts.  R. Pardo (the Blizzard PR guy) finally responds and gives us much to think about!  Here is the quote:<br />
<br />
<i><b>"We have actually never said that we would not have a PvP server. I saw that information post-E3 and have no idea where it came from. We totally consider it an option, but have not decided one way or the other. <br />
<br />
.....I doubt you can come up with any game or server where hard-core PvP'ers and hard-core PvE'ers (carebear is so derogatory) can happily co-exist. Most MMORPG players are somewhere in-between and can enjoy some amount of both. <br />
<br />
However, hard-core PvP players find it neccessary to be able to PK someone at any time. This is not merely to promote chaos, but an in-game way to resolve any conflicts that arise in the game. Sort of a might-makes-right mentality. The irony is that pure PvP servers usually do not have a lot of PK griefing, simply because your reputation matters and if you are a jerk, you will be hunted until you quit playing. This style of server is unacceptable to the hard-core PvE'er, since just getting randomly killed, sucks. <br />
<br />
PvP is certainly one of the top 5 most controversial topics in MMORPG design and I am not doing it justice with this short explanation, but hopefully it sheds a little light on the problem. "</i></b><br />

The PR guy for Blizzard (R. Pardo) has made several interesting posts which we repost and comment on in WoW forums (linked to your left).  Unless it's something ground breaking (like beta sign up), we will keep most of this in the forums.  Some good stuff though.<br />
<br />
Speaking of forums, we have set up a few new forums.  The first being for SWG even though we are not playing it as an organizaed group, many DBers ARE playing it and communicate some there.  The second is a General Forum for all non game related chit chat (should NOT be much of that!).  Current events, humping small animals, space flight and some other ...interesting stuff is goin on there!<br />
<br />
Lastly is a reminder to all DBers that they are able to upload pictures which appear on our front page and then remain in our picture section.  To have your account created, PM me on the message boards.<br />

Got a few quotes and info DBers might be interested in while waiting for WoW beta.  The following stuff was from an interview at Homelan with Bill Roper a VP and founder of Blizzard.<br />
<br />
<b><i>Our discussions soon turned to World of Warcraft, which with the release last week of Star Wars Galaxies has now officially become the single most anticipated upcoming massively multiplayer RPG currently in development. “We are very happy with the progress of the game,” Roper said. He added that they are now in an alpha state of the game’s progress and internally testing the game at their offices. Roper said that they will soon have a very, very limited alpha test with employees and their family and friends testing the game outside the Blizzard offices. Roper expects that official beta testing for World of Warcraft with outside testers will begin fairly soon, in about three or four months and like most tests will start with a small amount of testers and grow as the beta tests evolve. Roper said. He also said that unlike LucasArts, who kept its beta testers under a non-disclosure agreement until a few days before the end of the test, testers for World of Warcraft should be able to talk about their experiences long before the test ends.</i></b><br />
<br />
Yahoo Finance, however, reported that Bill Roper and 3 or 4 other employees left Blizzard North.  Here are some quotes taken from Yahoo:<br />
<br />
<i><b>In a statement, Blizzard Entertainment said Blizzard North co-founders Erich Schaefer, Max Schaefer and David Brevik, along with a fourth employee, Bill Roper, "resigned from the company to pursue other opportunities."<br />
<br />
Blizzard said it did not expect the group's departures to have any effect on properties in development. The team that had been known as Condor joined Blizzard and became Blizzard North in February 1996.<br />
<br />
"It would not be true to deny it's affecting the staff," Luc Vanhal, the president of VU Games' North American operations, told Reuters last month.</i></b><br />
<br />
Bill Roper in an interview with Gamespot gave some info about the departure:<br />
<br />
<i><b>Roper said, "We made a very difficult decision. We love everyone at Blizzard... at the San Mateo office and at Blizzard in Irvine." And in addition to this personal well-wishing, he did reveal other reasons for wanting to see Blizzard North continue on, and said, "I want to play Diablo." <br />
<br />
Asked what role Vivendi Universal's corporate management had to play in the decision, Roper admitted that was a big part of it: "We wanted to have a level of involvement [in deciding the studio's direction] that was not going to be made available. For the interests of the people that we work with, we should have been able to talk to the people that make the decisions and that knew what was going on." But in further describing Blizzard's situation, he said, "It's the same challenges we always faced. I have absolutely no doubt that they will keep fighting the good fight. We tried to leave them in a good place, and I honestly expect that Blizzard will continue to make great games." </i></b><br />
<br />
Basically, I am getting the impression from all of this that the French Company which owns Blizzard is not letting these guys do what they want, so they split.  I am not sure yet, but I do not believe they were directly working on World of Warcraft  (they were mostly workin' on Diablo stuff), but like i said, I am not sure.  I also am gettign the impression that Blizzard is for sale.  Whatever may be goin' on, I hope these clowns don't screw up World of Warcraft!<br />
<br />
I am starting a thread about this on the forums.  If anyone get's any info, please post it <a href="http://forums.darkenbane.com/showthread.php?s=&threadid=3117"><i>here.</i></p>

In an effort to maintain contact with their customers and shape Planetside around the ideas of the gamer, PS developers have posted on open forums some ideas they wish to add.   They are asking for YOUR opinion (believe it or not).  Here is the post:<br />
<br />
<b><i>Folks, <br />
As you've seen from the first month, Planetside gets a fairly steady flow of changes and enhancements in gameplay on a regular basis. We've got some more already done or in progress for you, for instance the Liberator which is being balanced and tested right now, and we'd like to gather some suggestions from you the players on how we can further improve the gameplay. <br />
<br />
We have two short term goals we're looking at with this post/discussion in particular. We'd like to improve the defense value and reward of bases, and we'd like to add some new game mechanics which will drive a larger variety and diversity of play. On the first point we're already in progress on higher rewards for kills made on defense, but there are plenty of other suggestions there we're sure. For the second we're currently looking at some form of base ownership to Outfits (probably not in a permanent sense, but more in the "we declare this our turf" sense). But we'd like your ideas there as well.<br />
<br />
Please use this thread to post those ideas if you think they are applicable. We encourage them all, and will read them all. It will help us get the best use of the thread if people do NOT post saying how much they like or dislike this or that idea - we'll start a separate thread for *discussion* of this one, please don't make "me too" kind of posts here. Also understand that while we may respond to some ideas and not to others, that doesn't mean any particular favor one way or the other - we'll be reading all of the posts, and also looking at our internal ideas of course.<br />
<br />
Our objective? By the end of this coming month we want to have a better variety of game play, more things to do, different ways to fight. Some ideas are doable in a short period like that month, some are much more long range, but we'd like to show some quick progress for you AND have some longer term plans in this area as well, so all suggestions will be considered.<br />
<br />
-Rich "Twist" Lawrence</b></i><br />
<br />
The higher experience for kills while defending a base was my idea BTW :)  The guild ownership of bases could be really interesting.   Darkenbane presently is way underpowered for such things, but hopefully this will change as we get more guys involved.  Anyhow, the link to the post is <b><i><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/planetside/Forum8/HTML/003553.html">here.</b></i></a></p>

<tr><td colspan="2" bgcolor="#424954">
<br>
<p align="justify">
Some info about the upcoming patch has been released.  I will list some of the good stuff here:<br />
<br />
<i>1) The Skyguard anti-aircraft buggy is now available for use. Enjoy!</i><br />
<br />
I get the impression they don't want aircraft buzzing around to much ;p <br />
<br />
<i>2) Hotspot algorithms have been improved. The Hotspots now scale up and down in size so that you can see the relative size of the battles in progress. Additionally, they are much more accurate (there is always a battle there now if you see a hotspot) and they refresh much more often. You should find them much more useful in finding battles now.</i><br />
<br />
This is gonna be nice.  I already use what they have and it seems pretty good.  Improvements will be even better. <br />
<br />
<i>3) You can now respawn to a hacked building if you are a member of the owning Empire. Previously, once a building was hacked, the option to respawn there was unavailable. This is no longer the case.</i> <br />
<br />
I smell some awesome tube camps in the making....<br />
<br />
<i>14) You can no longer see infiltration suits while your view is zoomed.</i> <br />
<br />
OOOOOOO, I like this one!<br />
<br />
<i>22) You can no longer hack an enemy base if the friendly base connected to that base (on the lattice) is already hacked. In otherwords, if your base of operations is hacked, you can't use that base to link to other enemy bases. Therefore, you can't hack enemy bases until your own rear area is secure.</i> <br />
<br />
Finally!   This should stabilize the frontlines of wars and stop the idotic lone hackers from "leapfrogging".  Thi sis real nice....and if they put a 5 minute hack time on towers, we will start seeing some really awesome fights.<br />
<br />
<i>25) Pulsar was boosted in damage slightly per shot against soldiers. Also, the AP fire rate was increased to match that of Standard shots.</i><br />
<br />
Ghey. <br />
<br />
<i>27) The population lock indicator has been changed to show how many slots are left for your Empire on that continent. In otherwords, it now shows a number instead of a percentage. The number caps out at 100, so if more than 100 slots remain on a continent, the indicator will say "100+". </i><br />
<br />
I guess they are doin' this cause people were not goin' to continants that had low % pops from their empire.  A change to fuxxor the sheep I guess.  <br />
<br />
I wish they would change some other stuff though like:<br />
<br />
1. Add a guild statistic (and leader board position) which divides the guild's points by it's members base.  Thus giving a good leaderboard position for non zerg guilds who have quality players.  Presently, leaderboards are only for the zerg.<br />
<br />
2. Add a death statistic to characters to see how many times a person has died and a ratio kill:deaths for the leaderboard.  This will make death a little bit more painful and perhaps stop the zerging to some extent.<br />
<br />
3. Add a warning when a hacker is currently beggining the hack on a base or tower and increase the time it takes to complete the hack so as to stop the solo hackers.   Hacking should be a at least a squad thing imho.  This will also stop the crap where a single stealthed hacker sneaks into a tower with 30 allies and hacks the tower around them.  Basically, if someone wants a tower or base, they are gonna have to fuckin' take it.<br />
<br />
4. Either nerf the Stryker or give tracking weapons to NC and VS (the tracking ability of a weapon is the most powerful addition of any weapon).   Being the only team with an infantry carried tracker missle is overpowered and makes using aircraft and vehicles vs TR much harder then vs. the other teams.  Nerf suggestions range from increasing the refire time dramatically, to "lighting" up the person who has a stryker equipped (making them visible on everyone's proximity map if they have the weapon equipped).   Any good teast to see if there is balance to a weapon is to check the % of players on a team that uses a given weapon.   I would venture to guess that 90% of TR 8th level and above have anti-vehicle (stryker).  Compare that to the other teams.  Basically, when you fight TR, go as infantry until they do something with this.</p>

Folks, <br />
<br />
A lot of you have expressed curiousity as to what the Dev Team is up to in regards to PlanetSide and its future content. Now that we've had a few weeks to shake out the launch of the game and watch how the game is running, we're ready to make some of this public. <br />
<br />
The list below is not a complete list of all features that will be added to the game. It's just a list of what we're sure will go into the game in the near future. There are a whole host of things we're not quite ready to reveal yet, so you can expect lots more to be unveiled in the months to come. <br />
<br />
Without further ado: <br />
<br />
Near Future Improvements (features & tweaks) <br />
<br />
(next two weeks) <br />
<br />
Facility Link Benefits: Each facility gives a benefit to the owning Empire. This ability is activated whenever an Empire owns a facility of that specific type somewhere on a continent. If multiple types of facilities are owned by an Empire on a single continent, then the abilities are shared between those facilities if there are no ownership breaks between those facilities on the lattice. <br />
<br />
<br />
For example: On Cyssor, if the TR own Pamba and Shango, then they would gain the ability for the Amp Station *and* the Bio Laboratory at both locations. However, if the TR only owned Pamba and Itan (no "friendly" connection between them), then the facilities wouldn't get to share their abilities. Instead, Pamba would have the Amp Station benefit (only) and Itan would have the Bio Laboratory benefit (only). <br />
<br />
<br />
The facilities have the following benefits: <br />
<br />
Bio Laboratory: Reduces all respawn penalties by 50%, at linked facilities only. (Not Towers and not Advanced Mobile Station (AMS)s.) <br />
<br />
Technology Plant: Makes "advanced" vehicles available at all vehicle pads linked to a friendly Tech Plant. <br />
<br />
Amp Station: Allows vehicles to recharge their shield capacitors in the courtyard of any linked facilities. This shield strengthens the armor of the vehicle, but dissipates as damage hits that shield. Vehicles recharge over time when in a linked courtyard, and only dissipate energy when damaged. There is no way to recharge a shield capacitor "in the field". <br />
<br />
Dropship Center: Allows access to Repair/Rearm Pads at linked facilities. Air vehicles can now land on the air vehicle pads and ground vehicles can pull up to a wall station in the courtyards. Once there, the vehicles can repair themselves over time, as well as access a terminal interface based on the Equipment Terminal that allows them to fill their trunk space without leaving the vehicle. <br />
<br />
Interlink Facility: Creates an extended area that the facility can see on radar. In otherwords, it greatly enhances the coverage area of your basic radar and makes your Phalanx wall turrets much more effective. NOTE: Wall turrets are automated at all times when they are not manned by a player. They fire more slowly when automated, but are still effective. It is no longer required to own an Interlink Facility in order to activate the wall turrets. All bases have active turrets at all times unless ownership is neutral. <br />
<br />
Advanced Hacking: Only Advanced Hacking lets you hack equipment terminals and vehicle terminals now. Basic Hacking only allows hacking of Medical Terminals, Lockers, Implant Terminals, and Certification Terminals. (Of course, all hacking abilities still continue to work for doors and control consoles.) <br />
<br />
<br />
Liberator (bomber): The Liberator is a three-crew vehicle where all positions can shoot. The pilot has a fixed-forward machinegun, the tailgunner has an easily swiveled machinegun for air defense and ground sweeps, and the bombardier can choose between "tankbuster" shells (dropped one at a time) or "anti-personnel" shells that split in mid-air and drop a pattern of shells around the target area, designed to annihilate infantry with multiple explosions. <br />
<br />
<br />
Skyguard (anti-aircraft buggy): The Skyguard is a two-crew vehicle where the driver sits forward and the gunner behind. The gunner has access to a flak cannon to take down air targets and a machinegun with which to defend against infantry. <br />
<br />
<br />
Orbital Strikes: Command Rank 4 & 5 characters now have the ability to pull down powerful energy beams from the Empire's orbital platform in space. Targets are designated by dropping a waypoint somewhere in a radius around the commander and then confirming the Strike to the orbital platform. They then send a beam down that is massively destructive in its power. Orbital Strikes cost Outfit Points to use, so Commanders should keep in mind that they're spending their Outfit's collective points when using this ability. This is a timed ability, and once triggered, the timer must expire before another Orbital Strike can occur. <br />
<br />
<br />
EMP Blasts: Imagine a Jammer grenade on steroids. A CR3-5 Commander can emit an EMP shockwave, centered on his position, that expands out, deactivating and disorienting enemy units around him. Soldiers lose their radar, all implants are reset, Spitfires and Alarm Sensors are deactivated, enemy vehicles are disabled, and mines and Boomers are detonated. All effects are temporary. Once an EMP Blast is used, the Commander must wait for a timer to expire before he's able to use it again. <br />
<br />
<br />
See all Enemies: Command Rank 4 & 5 characters can trigger this Uplink ability and get a sense of the positions of all enemy units within a certain radius of the Commander. (CR5 Commanders have a bigger radius than CR4 Commanders.) Enemy positions are accurate, but they are only valid for the moment that the info was downloaded. The position blips darken and fade over time to show that they are "old intel" and aren't reliable any longer. This ability, once triggered, must wait for a timer to expire before it can be triggered again. <br />
<br />
<br />
Uplink Device Interface: An interface has been developed for the Uplink Device allowing Commanders to better see the time needed before an ability is ready for use again. <br />
<br />
<br />
Vehicle Queuing System: After watching the game develop further, it became obvious that we needed to streamline the vehicle acquisition process. Thus, the queuing system was developed. Players now transport directly to their vehicle after purchase, and auto-drive away from the pad. This minimizes the amount of time needed to get a vehicle and clear the pad for other players. Additionally, if there is a line at the terminal, there is now a queuing system that's intuitive and easy to use that lets you just hang out after making your choice until your vehicle is created. No more "double-click frenzy" as you try to beat the other players in a timing game to acquire a vehicle. <br />
<br />
<br />
HotSpot Improvements: Hotspots are intended to tell you where the best battles are so that you can cut down your travel time and participate in the great combats around the world. Unfortunately, they don't currently refresh often enough, and they aren't always accurately portraying where groups of players are fighting. That will change soon. Hotspots will be scaled to the size of the fight occurring, and will be refreshed much more often so that the info is accurate when you arrive. <br />
<br />
<br />
Instant Action Improvements: You can currently be redeployed to a continent where no friendly facilities are owned, thus forcing you to either try and work a facility down to zero NTU (so you can hack it) or move to another continent if you want to attack a base. This, and some fall-through conditions, will be fixed so that Instant Action is more reliable, and so that when you use it, you're pretty much guaranteed to be near a quality battle of some sort. <br />
<br />
<br />
No "Hack Leapfrogging": You will soon be unable to hack an enemy facility if the only friendly facility linked to that enemy facility is also hacked itself. This will stabilize the "fronts" and prevent "hack leapfrogging". <br />
<br />
<br />
Defenders can Respawn at Hacked Facilities: To aid the defense a bit, they will soon be able to respawn at hacked facilities. Of course, the respawn tubes have to be in operating condition, but if they're available, then defenders can respawn there. <br />
<br />
<br />
Empire Incentives: The experience modifications are going away. Empire Incentives will be based on "meatier" variables now to give some bite to the Incentives. Health maximums will be affected directly so that underdog Empires get a bonus that matters. <br />
<br />
<br />
(next month and beyond) <br />
<br />
<br />
Again...this is not a complete list, but here goes: <br />
<br />
<br />
Tower Silos: Yes, you requested it and we agree with you. Towers are getting Silos. They'll run off NTUs soon. <br />
<br />
<br />
Tower Hack Times: It's likely that Towers will get a five-minute hack timer so that they can't be instantly flip-flopped. <br />
<br />
<br />
Medic Improvements: The Medic will get great new interfaces to make Revive a more useful ability, as well as additional abilities to help out friendly units with things like stimpaks and regen patches. <br />
<br />
<br />
Facility Gameflow: We'll be shaking up the gameplay you're used to now and making the buildings more interesting, with potential items like a force wall at the courtyard gates and possibly a blast door on the side entrance to the catacombs that would have to be hacked from within the building in order to open it to enemy attack. <br />
<br />
<br />
Continental Lock Incentives: As your Empire gains more continental locks, your Empire also gains "bonuses" that affect all players in your Empire. These incentives start after the first couple of locks, and are additive for each successive lock thereafter. They are balanced so that it doesn't create a problem where "winners keep winning", but they are attractive bonuses just the same. <br />
<br />
<br />
"Fame and Glory" Screens: In-game screens announcing recent best experience gainers, most kills, best outfits, territory "winners", etc. will all be available in-game so that those that it's all at-a-glance. <br />
<br />
<br />
Outfit Point Expenditures: The Orbital Strike ability is merely the tip of the iceberg. There will be a lot of ways to spend Outfit Points in the future and those will roll out continuously over time so that Outfits have to decide where they want their points to be spent during combats in the field. <br />
<br />
<br />
There's a lot more to come after that. Watch for more details in the weeks to come. <br />
<br />
