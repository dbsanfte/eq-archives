Phreeze was turned to the ways of killing when at a very young age
his parents were slain by a horde of halflings. With the deaths of
his parents his heart turned to stone. Forced to deal with the reality
of his bereavement, Phreeze first had to find suitable care for his
young sisters...

Darqness he sent off to learn the clerical arts and the holy hatred of
innoruuk, but she rebelled.. clerical might was not strong enough to
inflict the pain she craved to share so she turned to the enchanters
guild and trained with them.

Exquisite was older and more sure of herself, still shaken by the
butchering of our providers and teachers she took up a sword and
hacked apart the body of a fallen halfling. She later trained to be
one of the deadliest of fighters, the shadowknight.

Stunning was always the last to speak her mind.. always listening
and befreinding things so that when feeling at their safest, her prey
would be feeling not only emminent doom but the pain of betrayal.
She went without complaint to learn from the enchanters in Neriak.

As for myself, I had been training to become a wizard, my magic
was limited at first.. I was taken into the tower of the scorned
where I sent my sisters and studied the arcane arts... I was
relentless in my studies, I had to master magic enough to weild the
deadly lightning. once I had, I left my home of neriak and the grim
comfort of our dark forest and into the overly bright land of the
commons, there I lay in ambush for many months slaughtering all
the pale races I saw..dark elves, ogres, and Trolls would see me
fighting and help, I befreinded many of them... life was good. I was
introduced to a order of fighters who believed only dark races
should rule the lands. Hatred burned in my heart.. these friends
welcomed my ideals and my family into theirs, they were the Black
Tear.

For months, I fought with the tear. I piled bodies high into the sky,
they fell by the hundreds to me and my sisters. finaly my  hatred
began to abate just enough for my consuming desire for power to
push me on.. I progressed beyond the power of my sisters, I went
where they could not go into the lands known as oasis. There I
found many tougher opponents, but still I piled the bodies high
there... Here I began to run into what I will call the traitors. it was
not often, but it was annoying. I would spot some high elf or some
such and begin to call down all the magic I could muster to smite
the foe.. and my dark brothers and sisters would actualy take up
arms and spells against me! I could not believe it. I was fighting
this war for them! and they attack me.

Time passed slow after Oasis, I gained in magical strength.. but
the more I gained the more traitors I ran into.. when the bloodlust
would seize me I would run thru the deserts or forests in search of
some light race to kill.. many ogres, Trolls, and Dark elves would I
find.. wounded deeply from recent fights with the monstors that
terrorize norrath. These I would pass by or even greet. These dark
brethren were needed to fight against the plague of light races!
Sadly I began to fall victim to these same individuals whom I
passed by.. My heart was turning even more black.. I  began to
have thoughts of murdering my kin, but squelched them... I clung
to the memories of my time in the commons when all dark races I
saw would come to my aid.

The Tear left this world for another, I left the tear and joined the
malificus sect as they had similar ideals I had in my
youth..however my blood lust was dulled, It was now the norm for
dark races to attack me when I attacked a Tunare worshipping elf
druid... I began to focus on my power, gaining power became
important enough to ease the urge to slaughter as I knew If I did, I
would face the ever increasing problem of kinslayers.

Now Today my bloodlust is released, I know now there is no racial
loyalty.. there can be none, only my lust for blood remains. I cast
off the idealism of Malificus Sect and The Black Tear and
Embraced Hatred and mahem.

I am now Darkenbane
