A continuing relationship may exist between the guilds as some may go to the other's events and such, but no longer will any official raids be planned between the two guilds.<br />
<br />
Talks, however, have begun between DB and TOW to formalize an event group based on a points system where time invested in the group will yield rewards for the individuals involved.  These talks are leaning toward the two guilds engaging in difficult or large scale events planned together such as TOV or some epic mobs whilst keeping smaller events still within the guilds.  This has not been formalized, but discussionis underway.<br />

More info will be posted here when it is realized.<br><br></td></tr>

He has been found NOT guilty of Treason against the team and the guild.<br />
<br />
He has, however, been found guilty of acting in a manner unbecoming of an officer of Darkenbane as well as negligence which has lead to the deaths and dismemberment of his teamates.  The exact accusations leading to his conviction as well as the details surrounding his actions will remain confidential, but penalties will be assessed to him as follows:<br />
<br />
1. Stipped of his officer status.<br />
2. Reduced to recruit level permission (no private board or area access).<br />
3. Become Axxy's slave for a period of 2 weeks. (sorry man....but it has to be done) may god have mercy on your soul.<br />
<br />
The guild unanimously likes Draza, but believes he has committed grave errors which cannot be overlooked.  All hope to see him soon back within the trust and faith of his brethren.<br />

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="1">Submitted by <a href="mailto:grayrage@darkenbane.com">Grayrage</a> on 23-01-2002 15:55</font><p>Putting the hardest part of the Cleric Epic in a zone that is basically the evil team's back yard has always been somewhat of a balance issue for the SZ Teams server (among some other silly issues).  But alas, it has finally been addressed a LITTLE bit (it's still in their backyard, but no longer requires NAGGY to be dead).  As such, it looks like spawning the Ragefire replacement will be quite a bit easier.<br />
<br />
I will post the information regarding this change, but first wish to annouce that Darkenbane is seeing a serious shortage of clerics.  We always get a shortage in one class or another and bring in new folks to fill those requirments.  I do this by annoucing our neeeds here.  Well, we need clerics :)  So if you are planning on coming over to SZ and desire to join DB, consider makin' one for us!  At least now the epic is doable.<br />
<br />
Here is the change to the cleric epic:<br />
<br />
Normally this isn't something I'd do. But, well, I'm going to outline the changes we're making to this quest in rather close detail. But first, let me try to explain the concern that players had with this quest.<br />
With arguably the most popular Epic Quest item, the Cleric trying to gain his Epic item usually finds plenty of people to help in the process. Clerics are commonly the first in line with guilds to help with their epic quests. So Clerics tend to get further in their epic quest faster than many others. This has lead to a very nasty 'bottleneck' for Clerics trying to complete the quest. The Ragefire portion of the quest has been creating a lot of static among players.<br />
<br />
So we have decided to make a change to the end portion of this quest. To reduce confusion and to help people understand why we're making this change, I'm going to give out a few specific details. These changes will go Live with the patch tonight.<br />
<br />
For those that are not interested in quest details, consider the rest of this post SPOILER INFORMATION:<br />
<br />
<br />
First, the 'merchant' version of Zordak will now appear at a different location in SoldungB. He will appear once each day (except after a server comes down, then he will spawn in one to three days). The appearance of this NPC will no longer require the absence of Lord Nagafen.<br />
<br />
The cleric still turns in his Shimmering Pearl to Zordak. But now the merchant Zordak will return a Swirling Pearl to the Cleric and disappear.<br />
<br />
At that point the Cleric will need to head out and look for him. A killable version of Zordak will appear independent of the pearl turn-in every few days (except after a server goes down, then he will appear a little faster). Killing Zordak will transform him into dragon form, and the Cleric (with help…) must kill him immediately.<br />
<br />
The new dragon Zordak will drop a heart that is a container that requires the Swirling Pearl to be combined in it to create the Heart that is turned in to Omat.<br />
<br />
The rest of the quest remains the same.<br />
<br />
<br />
The goal of these changes is to reduce the problems with the bottleneck that existed before. They will not remove that bottleneck, but hopefully will remove the nasty competition for a single spawn with so many people willing to be… rude to each other.<br />

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="1">Submitted by <a href="mailto:grayrage@darkenbane.com">Grayrage</a> on 21-01-2002 17:13</font><p>As many know or have heard rumour, Draza was accused of being the mole DB had had problem with for the past 6 weeks.  I am making this news post to clarify the situation instead of letting it stay unaddressed.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is that Draza made some mistakes of judgement.  Whther it was actual SPYING or not is now up to the guild to decide.  His 'trial' was conducted last night and a log of this trial will be posted on our NOW secure board for the guild to discuss.<br />
<br />
For the record, Draza admits to having made some judgement errors in who he chose as his friends outside of DB, but claims no malice was involved nor any intention to harm the guild.  The prosecution, however, claimed that he had knowledge the entire time that his action would harm the guild.  It's in the hands of the guild right now what will be done and the final decision will be posted here for all to see.<br><br></td></tr>

Some things were said and done that created some bad blood, but the time for friction to end is upon us.<br />
<br />
The people of INkara are NOT our enemy.   They are our TEAMATES and the key to our success on Sullon Zek is cooperation with our Team.  Adjonai, one of the Neutral Team's premiere tanks, has/is seriously considering leaving the game.  Whilst this is an everyday occurance on the evil team and effects them little because of their numerical superiority, our team can ill afford such losses.  With this in mind, I conversed with Saradin extensively last night during the slaughter of Defilers, infeste Nex and Nine in Kith.  <br />

Amid the rather pleasant dissection of the foe, we came to the mutual agreement that the bitterness must go and the Team must continue it's course.<br><br></td></tr>

"Recharging" items confirmed to be a bannable offense. 15-03-2001 <br />
<br />
Submitted by Grayrage on 15-03-2001 15:30<br />
A common occurance these days on Rallos Zek (and many other servers) has been the "recharging" of items including (but not limited to) Egg Pumices, Conflag Wands and Golem Wands. <br />
<br />
Lead Game Master Valdelmar (Andy Kirton) addressed this issue advising: "It's a severe violation to do this and such actions if caught can lead to banning of the account." <br />
<br />
He further discussed that it will be fixed ASAP as he sees it as being unbalancing in PvP in the following statement: "I can see now that it's a <br />
huge problem given the old egg shaped pumices with instant dispell of buffs. I will make sure that this is processed asap."<br><br></td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="1">Submitted by <a href="mailto:grayrage@darkenbane.com">Grayrage</a> on 06-01-2002 16:12</font><p>In a day of accomplishments and glory, Darkenbane came back to the world of Norrath with one of it's best and most satisfying raids to date.  This comes after DB put together a few mini raids where such mobs as Kelorek Dar were dropped (netting 2 Bio Orbs and a cloak without excluding any neutrals who wanted to come....except those who excluded others in the past).<br />
<br />
This raid, to the Plane of Growth, may have been our most efficient ever with some enormous humour (in a cynical way) mixed in.  Let me explain:<br />
<br />
The plan was for DB to hit POG with with a few SOB mixed in.  Player, Marqus, Saii and a few chanters we invited (because we have only 1) did not show up (until well into the raid because they were doin a CR somewhere else).  So we go in with 15 DB and clear the easy side (80% of it anyhow) without ONE death (we have to try and not die since we do not have a rez stick or even a 56th rez yet).  Later Saii, Marqus and about 3 or 4 other SOB came as well as the enchantress Lizabella from the Reapers and we moved to the hard side.<br />
<br />
In all his glory, Saii pulled like a snowborder from hell keeping us busy with 2 and sometimes three mobs at once.  Deaths occurred, but Rakim was there with his uber rez so it mattered not as we waded through the entire zone in record time.<br />
<br />
All the named were hunted and destroyed.  The easy side ones went down first, then it was time for the bad boys.  Treah dropped with no deaths and 2 clerics at full mana, Undigo came into camp virtually unnannouced (well Saii did call incoming!!!!), but was put to death and we even tried to do the Protector of the Glade, but his stupid panthers we could not shake off him.<br />
<br />
Loot you ask?  Ahh well....this was prolly the most beautiful part of the raid!!!   There was ZERO arguement about loot!!   OH MY GOD, was it nice.  Darkenbane is actually now made up of people who care about the GUILD and their mates more than themselves.  In our cleansing it was a first concern to be rid of the folks who thought more of themselves than the guild and the difference was astonishing.  In any case, here is the goodies that dropped:<br />
<br />
Keta         -  Assassin Gloves<br />
Axxy         -  Resonant Arms<br />
Guteseele    -  Resplendent Robe<br />
<img src="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics15/resplendent_robe.jpg"><br />
Onec         -  Spiritweaver Arms<br />
Lizabella    -  Resplendent Robe (yep we got two)<br />
Lemarti      -  Beserker Greaves<br />
Arty         -  Mage Greaves<br />
<br />
In all the times we hit POG we never saw much enchanter stuff, but as soon as we drop FOUR enchanters, 2 ROBES come to us.  Kinda ironic, eh?  We got a nice set of SK greaves and Monk boots which were destroyed as well and some miscellaneous other stuff like POTG for Droox, Pet spell for Hama and Arch Liche for trade with the enemy (send me a tell if youw ant to trade for this spell BTW).  Grats to Liz (Reapers) on being in the right place at the right time for the default on the robe!<br />
<br />
All in all it was a good raid!   I am proud to be your brother, Darkenbane!<br><br></td></tr>
