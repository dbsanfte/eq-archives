Got a few quotes and info DBers might be interested in while waiting for WoW beta.  The following stuff was from an interview at Homelan with Bill Roper a VP and founder of Blizzard.<br />
<br />
<b><i>Our discussions soon turned to World of Warcraft, which with the release last week of Star Wars Galaxies has now officially become the single most anticipated upcoming massively multiplayer RPG currently in development. “We are very happy with the progress of the game,” Roper said. He added that they are now in an alpha state of the game’s progress and internally testing the game at their offices. Roper said that they will soon have a very, very limited alpha test with employees and their family and friends testing the game outside the Blizzard offices. Roper expects that official beta testing for World of Warcraft with outside testers will begin fairly soon, in about three or four months and like most tests will start with a small amount of testers and grow as the beta tests evolve. Roper said. He also said that unlike LucasArts, who kept its beta testers under a non-disclosure agreement until a few days before the end of the test, testers for World of Warcraft should be able to talk about their experiences long before the test ends.</i></b><br />
<br />
Yahoo Finance, however, reported that Bill Roper and 3 or 4 other employees left Blizzard North.  Here are some quotes taken from Yahoo:<br />
<br />
<i><b>In a statement, Blizzard Entertainment said Blizzard North co-founders Erich Schaefer, Max Schaefer and David Brevik, along with a fourth employee, Bill Roper, "resigned from the company to pursue other opportunities."<br />
<br />
Blizzard said it did not expect the group's departures to have any effect on properties in development. The team that had been known as Condor joined Blizzard and became Blizzard North in February 1996.<br />
<br />
"It would not be true to deny it's affecting the staff," Luc Vanhal, the president of VU Games' North American operations, told Reuters last month.</i></b><br />
<br />
Bill Roper in an interview with Gamespot gave some info about the departure:<br />
<br />
<i><b>Roper said, "We made a very difficult decision. We love everyone at Blizzard... at the San Mateo office and at Blizzard in Irvine." And in addition to this personal well-wishing, he did reveal other reasons for wanting to see Blizzard North continue on, and said, "I want to play Diablo." <br />
<br />
Asked what role Vivendi Universal's corporate management had to play in the decision, Roper admitted that was a big part of it: "We wanted to have a level of involvement [in deciding the studio's direction] that was not going to be made available. For the interests of the people that we work with, we should have been able to talk to the people that make the decisions and that knew what was going on." But in further describing Blizzard's situation, he said, "It's the same challenges we always faced. I have absolutely no doubt that they will keep fighting the good fight. We tried to leave them in a good place, and I honestly expect that Blizzard will continue to make great games." </i></b><br />
<br />
Basically, I am getting the impression from all of this that the French Company which owns Blizzard is not letting these guys do what they want, so they split.  I am not sure yet, but I do not believe they were directly working on World of Warcraft  (they were mostly workin' on Diablo stuff), but like i said, I am not sure.  I also am gettign the impression that Blizzard is for sale.  Whatever may be goin' on, I hope these clowns don't screw up World of Warcraft!<br />
<br />
I am starting a thread about this on the forums.  If anyone get's any info, please post it <a href="http://forums.darkenbane.com/showthread.php?s=&threadid=3117"><i>here.</i></td></tr>
