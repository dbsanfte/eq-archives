<a href="/image.php?id=84" title="One of the latest screenshots, it has nothing to do with this news item."><img src="/screenshots/0/small84.jpg" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="right" border="0"></a>
Some info about the upcoming patch has been released.  I will list some of the good stuff here:<br />
<br />
<i>1) The Skyguard anti-aircraft buggy is now available for use. Enjoy!</i><br />
<br />
I get the impression they don't want aircraft buzzing around to much ;p <br />
<br />
<i>2) Hotspot algorithms have been improved. The Hotspots now scale up and down in size so that you can see the relative size of the battles in progress. Additionally, they are much more accurate (there is always a battle there now if you see a hotspot) and they refresh much more often. You should find them much more useful in finding battles now.</i><br />
<br />
This is gonna be nice.  I already use what they have and it seems pretty good.  Improvements will be even better. <br />
<br />
<i>3) You can now respawn to a hacked building if you are a member of the owning Empire. Previously, once a building was hacked, the option to respawn there was unavailable. This is no longer the case.</i> <br />
<br />
I smell some awesome tube camps in the making....<br />
<br />
<i>14) You can no longer see infiltration suits while your view is zoomed.</i> <br />
<br />
OOOOOOO, I like this one!<br />
<br />
<i>22) You can no longer hack an enemy base if the friendly base connected to that base (on the lattice) is already hacked. In otherwords, if your base of operations is hacked, you can't use that base to link to other enemy bases. Therefore, you can't hack enemy bases until your own rear area is secure.</i> <br />
<br />
Finally!   This should stabilize the frontlines of wars and stop the idotic lone hackers from "leapfrogging".  Thi sis real nice....and if they put a 5 minute hack time on towers, we will start seeing some really awesome fights.<br />
<br />
<i>25) Pulsar was boosted in damage slightly per shot against soldiers. Also, the AP fire rate was increased to match that of Standard shots.</i><br />
<br />
Ghey. <br />
<br />
<i>27) The population lock indicator has been changed to show how many slots are left for your Empire on that continent. In otherwords, it now shows a number instead of a percentage. The number caps out at 100, so if more than 100 slots remain on a continent, the indicator will say "100+". </i><br />
<br />
I guess they are doin' this cause people were not goin' to continants that had low % pops from their empire.  A change to fuxxor the sheep I guess.  <br />
<br />
I wish they would change some other stuff though like:<br />
<br />
1. Add a guild statistic (and leader board position) which divides the guild's points by it's members base.  Thus giving a good leaderboard position for non zerg guilds who have quality players.  Presently, leaderboards are only for the zerg.<br />
<br />
2. Add a death statistic to characters to see how many times a person has died and a ratio kill:deaths for the leaderboard.  This will make death a little bit more painful and perhaps stop the zerging to some extent.<br />
<br />
3. Add a warning when a hacker is currently beggining the hack on a base or tower and increase the time it takes to complete the hack so as to stop the solo hackers.   Hacking should be a at least a squad thing imho.  This will also stop the crap where a single stealthed hacker sneaks into a tower with 30 allies and hacks the tower around them.  Basically, if someone wants a tower or base, they are gonna have to fuckin' take it.<br />
<br />
4. Either nerf the Stryker or give tracking weapons to NC and VS (the tracking ability of a weapon is the most powerful addition of any weapon).   Being the only team with an infantry carried tracker missle is overpowered and makes using aircraft and vehicles vs TR much harder then vs. the other teams.  Nerf suggestions range from increasing the refire time dramatically, to "lighting" up the person who has a stryker equipped (making them visible on everyone's proximity map if they have the weapon equipped).   Any good teast to see if there is balance to a weapon is to check the % of players on a team that uses a given weapon.   I would venture to guess that 90% of TR 8th level and above have anti-vehicle (stryker).  Compare that to the other teams.  Basically, when you fight TR, go as infantry until they do something with this.</p>

I have a sinking feeling we are gonna get ownzered by some new Vanu Superpower soon. It's not as if hovering over water is not good enough...and the only team ability to jump OVER buildings and walls, I have a feeling that soon the Vanu will have these plus comparable weapons and armor to us (or some other unique ability)....check out this quote:<br />
<br />
<b><i>I wanted to let you know that although I do not have specific information to share with you on the subject, the Vanu Sovereignty are being actively investigated to try and resolve any balance issues or technical issues that may exist, making them seem less effective than other Empires. <br />
Please note that the word "seem" does not mean that we do not believe that the VS is underpowered. At the same time, I can't just post that we agree on the subject before the designers have analyzed the situation and made a decision. It is not my judgement to make and I only say "seem" to respect their area of expertise. <br />
<br />
At any rate, I want to make sure you all know that it is a topic of investigation and I hope to have more to tell you in the next week or two on the subject. <br />

For the record, the reason people don't pick the Vanu is cause of the PURPLE and the annoying noise of their laser type weoponry.  Talk about a turn off....</p>

Folks, <br />
<br />
A lot of you have expressed curiousity as to what the Dev Team is up to in regards to PlanetSide and its future content. Now that we've had a few weeks to shake out the launch of the game and watch how the game is running, we're ready to make some of this public. <br />
<br />
The list below is not a complete list of all features that will be added to the game. It's just a list of what we're sure will go into the game in the near future. There are a whole host of things we're not quite ready to reveal yet, so you can expect lots more to be unveiled in the months to come. <br />
<br />
Without further ado: <br />
<br />
Near Future Improvements (features & tweaks) <br />
<br />
(next two weeks) <br />
<br />
Facility Link Benefits: Each facility gives a benefit to the owning Empire. This ability is activated whenever an Empire owns a facility of that specific type somewhere on a continent. If multiple types of facilities are owned by an Empire on a single continent, then the abilities are shared between those facilities if there are no ownership breaks between those facilities on the lattice. <br />
<br />
<br />
For example: On Cyssor, if the TR own Pamba and Shango, then they would gain the ability for the Amp Station *and* the Bio Laboratory at both locations. However, if the TR only owned Pamba and Itan (no "friendly" connection between them), then the facilities wouldn't get to share their abilities. Instead, Pamba would have the Amp Station benefit (only) and Itan would have the Bio Laboratory benefit (only). <br />
<br />
<br />
The facilities have the following benefits: <br />
<br />
Bio Laboratory: Reduces all respawn penalties by 50%, at linked facilities only. (Not Towers and not Advanced Mobile Station (AMS)s.) <br />
<br />
Technology Plant: Makes "advanced" vehicles available at all vehicle pads linked to a friendly Tech Plant. <br />
<br />
Amp Station: Allows vehicles to recharge their shield capacitors in the courtyard of any linked facilities. This shield strengthens the armor of the vehicle, but dissipates as damage hits that shield. Vehicles recharge over time when in a linked courtyard, and only dissipate energy when damaged. There is no way to recharge a shield capacitor "in the field". <br />
<br />
Dropship Center: Allows access to Repair/Rearm Pads at linked facilities. Air vehicles can now land on the air vehicle pads and ground vehicles can pull up to a wall station in the courtyards. Once there, the vehicles can repair themselves over time, as well as access a terminal interface based on the Equipment Terminal that allows them to fill their trunk space without leaving the vehicle. <br />
<br />
Interlink Facility: Creates an extended area that the facility can see on radar. In otherwords, it greatly enhances the coverage area of your basic radar and makes your Phalanx wall turrets much more effective. NOTE: Wall turrets are automated at all times when they are not manned by a player. They fire more slowly when automated, but are still effective. It is no longer required to own an Interlink Facility in order to activate the wall turrets. All bases have active turrets at all times unless ownership is neutral. <br />
<br />
Advanced Hacking: Only Advanced Hacking lets you hack equipment terminals and vehicle terminals now. Basic Hacking only allows hacking of Medical Terminals, Lockers, Implant Terminals, and Certification Terminals. (Of course, all hacking abilities still continue to work for doors and control consoles.) <br />
<br />
<br />
Liberator (bomber): The Liberator is a three-crew vehicle where all positions can shoot. The pilot has a fixed-forward machinegun, the tailgunner has an easily swiveled machinegun for air defense and ground sweeps, and the bombardier can choose between "tankbuster" shells (dropped one at a time) or "anti-personnel" shells that split in mid-air and drop a pattern of shells around the target area, designed to annihilate infantry with multiple explosions. <br />
<br />
<br />
Skyguard (anti-aircraft buggy): The Skyguard is a two-crew vehicle where the driver sits forward and the gunner behind. The gunner has access to a flak cannon to take down air targets and a machinegun with which to defend against infantry. <br />
<br />
<br />
Orbital Strikes: Command Rank 4 & 5 characters now have the ability to pull down powerful energy beams from the Empire's orbital platform in space. Targets are designated by dropping a waypoint somewhere in a radius around the commander and then confirming the Strike to the orbital platform. They then send a beam down that is massively destructive in its power. Orbital Strikes cost Outfit Points to use, so Commanders should keep in mind that they're spending their Outfit's collective points when using this ability. This is a timed ability, and once triggered, the timer must expire before another Orbital Strike can occur. <br />
<br />
<br />
EMP Blasts: Imagine a Jammer grenade on steroids. A CR3-5 Commander can emit an EMP shockwave, centered on his position, that expands out, deactivating and disorienting enemy units around him. Soldiers lose their radar, all implants are reset, Spitfires and Alarm Sensors are deactivated, enemy vehicles are disabled, and mines and Boomers are detonated. All effects are temporary. Once an EMP Blast is used, the Commander must wait for a timer to expire before he's able to use it again. <br />
<br />
<br />
See all Enemies: Command Rank 4 & 5 characters can trigger this Uplink ability and get a sense of the positions of all enemy units within a certain radius of the Commander. (CR5 Commanders have a bigger radius than CR4 Commanders.) Enemy positions are accurate, but they are only valid for the moment that the info was downloaded. The position blips darken and fade over time to show that they are "old intel" and aren't reliable any longer. This ability, once triggered, must wait for a timer to expire before it can be triggered again. <br />
<br />
<br />
Uplink Device Interface: An interface has been developed for the Uplink Device allowing Commanders to better see the time needed before an ability is ready for use again. <br />
<br />
<br />
Vehicle Queuing System: After watching the game develop further, it became obvious that we needed to streamline the vehicle acquisition process. Thus, the queuing system was developed. Players now transport directly to their vehicle after purchase, and auto-drive away from the pad. This minimizes the amount of time needed to get a vehicle and clear the pad for other players. Additionally, if there is a line at the terminal, there is now a queuing system that's intuitive and easy to use that lets you just hang out after making your choice until your vehicle is created. No more "double-click frenzy" as you try to beat the other players in a timing game to acquire a vehicle. <br />
<br />
<br />
HotSpot Improvements: Hotspots are intended to tell you where the best battles are so that you can cut down your travel time and participate in the great combats around the world. Unfortunately, they don't currently refresh often enough, and they aren't always accurately portraying where groups of players are fighting. That will change soon. Hotspots will be scaled to the size of the fight occurring, and will be refreshed much more often so that the info is accurate when you arrive. <br />
<br />
<br />
Instant Action Improvements: You can currently be redeployed to a continent where no friendly facilities are owned, thus forcing you to either try and work a facility down to zero NTU (so you can hack it) or move to another continent if you want to attack a base. This, and some fall-through conditions, will be fixed so that Instant Action is more reliable, and so that when you use it, you're pretty much guaranteed to be near a quality battle of some sort. <br />
<br />
<br />
No "Hack Leapfrogging": You will soon be unable to hack an enemy facility if the only friendly facility linked to that enemy facility is also hacked itself. This will stabilize the "fronts" and prevent "hack leapfrogging". <br />
<br />
<br />
Defenders can Respawn at Hacked Facilities: To aid the defense a bit, they will soon be able to respawn at hacked facilities. Of course, the respawn tubes have to be in operating condition, but if they're available, then defenders can respawn there. <br />
<br />
<br />
Empire Incentives: The experience modifications are going away. Empire Incentives will be based on "meatier" variables now to give some bite to the Incentives. Health maximums will be affected directly so that underdog Empires get a bonus that matters. <br />
<br />
<br />
(next month and beyond) <br />
<br />
<br />
Again...this is not a complete list, but here goes: <br />
<br />
<br />
Tower Silos: Yes, you requested it and we agree with you. Towers are getting Silos. They'll run off NTUs soon. <br />
<br />
<br />
Tower Hack Times: It's likely that Towers will get a five-minute hack timer so that they can't be instantly flip-flopped. <br />
<br />
<br />
Medic Improvements: The Medic will get great new interfaces to make Revive a more useful ability, as well as additional abilities to help out friendly units with things like stimpaks and regen patches. <br />
<br />
<br />
Facility Gameflow: We'll be shaking up the gameplay you're used to now and making the buildings more interesting, with potential items like a force wall at the courtyard gates and possibly a blast door on the side entrance to the catacombs that would have to be hacked from within the building in order to open it to enemy attack. <br />
<br />
<br />
Continental Lock Incentives: As your Empire gains more continental locks, your Empire also gains "bonuses" that affect all players in your Empire. These incentives start after the first couple of locks, and are additive for each successive lock thereafter. They are balanced so that it doesn't create a problem where "winners keep winning", but they are attractive bonuses just the same. <br />
<br />
<br />
"Fame and Glory" Screens: In-game screens announcing recent best experience gainers, most kills, best outfits, territory "winners", etc. will all be available in-game so that those that it's all at-a-glance. <br />
<br />
<br />
Outfit Point Expenditures: The Orbital Strike ability is merely the tip of the iceberg. There will be a lot of ways to spend Outfit Points in the future and those will roll out continuously over time so that Outfits have to decide where they want their points to be spent during combats in the field. <br />
<br />
<br />
There's a lot more to come after that. Watch for more details in the weeks to come. <br />
<br />

<tr><td colspan="2" bgcolor="#424954">
<br>
<p align="justify">
Do you watch TV and play EQ?  Do you do errands while playing EQ (wash dishes, cook, change the cat litter)?  How bout' a little homework?   You want to know the differnce between PS and EQ?  Well, for one, you cannot do any of the above in PS!    I dare you....go take a piss when in planetside....u will come back looking at your bullet ridden corpse as sure as the sun rises!<br />
<br />
Action....<big>actION....<big>ACTION</big></big>!  That's what planetside is about.  No downtime.  No diddling around.  Just constant fucking battle.  Jesus, there's not even enough time in PS to shitalk.  Hell, I tried.  And i got killed.  Gods, sometimes, just to speak to guildmembers i go try to hide in a river for a minute.<br />
<br />
The game has made death almost painless.  It still sucks to get killed, but it does not take an inordinate amount of time to recover and get back in the fight.  You lose your gear, but getting all your gear brand new is free and readily available at spawn points so you grab it and run right back into the fray.  So are you the gimp who keeps running back into the battle to be victim fodder?  Or do you run back in and take down 2, 3 or 4 people before they get you?   That's what PS is about in a zergfest environment.<br />
<br />
You don't have to deal with the zerg if you don't want to though.  If you are lucky, you can find...or create a good squad and pinpoint good targets to take over and hold with a strong organized unit.  After you capture the base, you can evacuate and move on to another target...avoiding the zerg which would ultimately come to you if you remained.  Believe me, there is alot of strategy if you want there to be such things.  Or you can follow the zerg around and have tons of fun blasting folks!<br />
<br />
Graphically, the game is beautiful.  I run it on a 1.5ghz  with a GeForce2 64 meg card and it runs great at medium settings (with no flora).  I checked it out on a GeForce4 with settings on high...and wow, it's amazing.  Real grass, shrubs, rocks and shit.  The damage models are really nifty too.  You can play it on a pathetic machine fine, but try to get a big dog to play it and enjoy the artwork and fancy effects!<br />
<br />
Is the game finished?  No, but it was ready for retail imho.  It's mostly very stable with minimal downtimes and no random crashes that I have seen.  None of that crap like in SB where you get the SB.exe error every 5 minutes.  That kind of shit is just inexcusable, Wolfpack.  Making folks pay for a beta game is not cool if you ask me.<br />
<br />
<b><big><big>Suggestions:</b></big></big><br />
<br />
1. Statistics - This game is all about stats.  It's great they saw this and have them for our review.  Frankly, without stats, there would be no point in the game.   There are, however, some stats they should add.  For example, they have number of members for an outfit on the leaderboard.  Why?  So the guy who spams everyone in the santuary with guild invites gets his gimp outfit on the leaderboard?  Instead the board should list a ratio of points/members as a leaderboard choice.  This way a 20 person guild with 20 GOOD members will be higher rated then 300 person guild with zerglings.<br />
<br />
2. Hacking - random hackers running around hacking every tower and base behind yah is annoying and stupid...espcially in the morning hours when you do not have the people to guard the bases behind you.  Change it so an annoucement is made when a hacker <i>begins</i> to hack a tower (so he cannot be hacking it while 5 people are inside not even aware he is there).  This will at least give people a chance to stop the hacker from accomplishing his deed.  It is also of my opinion that the hack times should be significantly increased (thus giving people time to go kill the lone hackers).  Basically this will stop the lone random hackers who are cruising around in mosquitos being annoying.  Instead it will force a squad to actually protect the hacker while he does his work.<br />
<br />
3. Outfits - Allow for outfit names to be above people's names.  Or perhaps their emblems on their armor.  Would be neat if we could upload our own emblems too, but i guess that would be hard as hell to code.  Allow for an outfit search function so you can see how many are on the island you are on, ect.   <br />
<br />
The game is fun as hell, but not for everyone.  It's definately a niche' game.  You either love it or don't.  If you are one who loves it, I'll see yah there.<br />

The Planetside statistics linked to your left is taken directly from the http://www.myplanetside.com website.   This statistical page updates most information every 15 minutes, but for some reason does <i>not</i> update the guild membership unless a removed person joins another guild.   This means that many of the folks that we have cleared off our roster, still appear on the website.<br />
<br />
This is the reason for the discrepency in the numbers i posted below.  As such, i admit that same discrepancy could exist for the KAAOS numbers, but let's just assume the worst for them (cause it's more fun!).</p>

Just when it seemed like killing the foe was similar to killing any no name zergling computer generated character, we ran into Rellik today (locking one of TR's continents).   And the gods of doom answered our prayers by providing us with whiny sheep like victims once again!<br />
<br />
Although KAAOS seems to have taken the zerg route (70 crying newbs already!), I am more then pleased to pit our 15 members vs them.  Let the camera's start clicking!  <br />
<br />
Doing a little math.....KAAOS has 90k points/70 members = 1280 per zerg.   We are at 26k points/15 members = 1733 per studly man. I will keep track as the game progresses!</p>

While Shadowbane, EQ and surely Planetside take much of our gaming time, we always look to the future.  Will it be EQ2 for us?   I am not so sure.  Skuttlebutt sayeth that EQ2 will again not be oriented around PvP whilst World of Warcraft has some other ideas.  <br />
<br />
After looking over at WoW (World of Warcraft) for sometime, we came to the conclusion that this game may very well be the next big thing to unite all of Darkenbane under one game!   With this in mind, I have taken the liberty of putting up a new message board for WoW discussion and Meter has already posted a nice quote from a WoW developer as follows:<br />
<br />
'That doesn't mean you can't share some encounters with your opponents. Blizzard hopes you will, specifically in the player-versus-player areas. 90 per cent of the world will remain non-PvP, but the rest will encourage you to clash with your opponents for the game's best cosmetic items, as well as experience points. "There will be only rewards, no disincentive to PvP," explained Adham. He continued with a joking illustration: "For example, in a non-PvP zone, you might be able to get an AC20 shield, but it has a care bear on the front. In a PvP zone, you can get an AC20 shield, but it's black." The PvP rules will follow the Horde vs. Alliance rules, with the good races facing those of a darker ilk. Adham took pains to point out that PvP would be consensual only, making up a small but interesting part of the world, although there would be full-PvP servers.' <br />
<br />
Per Meter's post the entire article where this quote was found is <a href="http://www.gamesdomain.com/gdreview...ay03/WoW_1.html"><i>here.</i></a><br />

Meter has done it again!  He has added a link (in your upper left corner) to the Darkenbane member statistics which is taken directly from Planetside's website and updated here automatically every 15 minutes!<br />

You can now easily click there to see how your favorite Murdering Scum is doin' in PS!  (BTW, did you guys notice that little butt maggot, Toad, is smokin' all of us in points?  Bastad.)</p>

Gonna get right down to the meat and potatos:  Planetside is FUN.   Longevity?  I dunno.  BUT FUN!<br />
<br />
In a flawless launch, Sony dropped this bad boy on us and let me tell yah, it's crazy action packed.  I often found myself on the edge of my seat in anticipation of killing or being killed.  The atmosphere is incredible as real time damage models make your bullets and bombs do actual damage to your surroundings and the sound of enemy fire wizzing past your ears actually makes you want to duck or lose your real life head!<br />
<br />
So how does it compare to SB or EQ?  It's a different animal completely.  The first thing that comes to mind, though, is noticing Planetside is far more finished then SB.  No lag, no bugs (that I could find), no crashes.  So whilst SB has some great concepts, the game is just not finished.  Lag, bugs, stability issues make Shadowbane a game which should really still should be in beta for a few more months.  <br />
<br />
PS, as opposed to the other games, is basically a monstrosity of an organized zergfest.  So whilst SB is also a Zerg type game, the Zerg there is directed by players whilst PS's zerg is guided by the game mechanics itself.  IMHO this is not a bad thing for the casual player who can just login, find where the battles are on his/her map and then head over and coin a few badies before login' for work.  The downside, however, is longevity.  Will this keep people interested? Only time will tell, but I can asure you it will keep folks interested for the short term.<br />
<br />
Although there is character development, it has minimal impact on a player's gaming and is not central to the game's dynamics.  Basically, a player can login as a complete newb, get right in on the action and smoke folks.  Any leveling done (exp is gained by killin' folks or taking over bases) is just a bonus adding more options for your play style.<br />
<br />
Death?  Well, like any good zergfest, there is basically zero death penalty.  Trust me, though, when I say Sony balanced this to make it work and still be fun.  Basically, dying just takes you out of the immediate battle, but also let's you get back into the fray with minimal downtime.<br />
<br />
PS is lacking in the social arena, however, while games like EQ and SB have a broad, expansive social atmosphere where folks spend hours chatting, sexxoring, arguing and otherwise interacting, this game is the opposite.  There is no shittalk, no sexxor (not yet anyhow)......just WAR.  Sure, if you want to go hide somewhere, you can send tells and such, but it's just not like that.  It's a non stop action game where downtime is almost non existant (which is central to the social atmosphere of EQ).<br />
<br />
So what is Planetside then?  Well, it's basically like Quake or one of those other first person shooters, that lets you use tanks, planes, buggies and has a few thousand other folks playing with you at the same time.  And like I said above, it's fuckin' fun as hell :)<br />
<br />
How does it fit in with guilds?  How are we gonna deal with it?  Well, PS is not as sophisticated in it's guild system as SB (where a guild can actually build it's own cities), but it still has a cool guild (outfit) system which allows folks to organize better and not necessarily follow the zerg.  The game is set up so that you can basically follow your team around the world and join with them in massive battles (I have already been in fights with many hundreds of people with ZERO virtual or network lag) without being a part of any organization.  Being in a guild opens this up some allowing for players to organize their own targets and actually have the firepower to accomplish their goals.  <br />
<br />
Last night, we created Darkenbane (8 of us now), and as the night passed got better at working together.  One of our guys is a galaxy pilot (a drop ship) and another a stealthed hacker (a rogue who can turn a bad guy base into a friendly base).  We would then go to what looked like a lightly defended base and kill any ememies around while our hacker would do his magic (which takes quite a while).  We earn points for killin' folks and for turning their base into ours. <br />
<br />
Our plan is to add more folks (though not become a zerg like some guilds which are randomly inviting anyone), get everyone on Teamspeak (which works better then PS's voice thing) and start plannin' some nasty surgical strikes!  We also expect to show up on the statistics page (we are on emerald server playing New Conglomerate).<br />
