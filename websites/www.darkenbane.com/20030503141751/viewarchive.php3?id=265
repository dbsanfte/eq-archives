<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="1">Submitted by <a href="mailto:grayrage@darkenbane.com">Grayrage</a> on 07-02-2002 18:45</font><p>After years of playing Everquest (since beta) as a PvP game I have rarely said anything but how much fun EQ has been.  They always work toward expanding the game world, fix bugs, balance and review powers of the classes and add content.  No games have come out that have added or bettered EQ's alledged lack as a PvP game (IMHO).  People already have been seen returning from DAOC and AO hardly took anyone.<br />
<br />
Now, however, many folks are becoming impatient as their loyalty to the game is not being returned.  With the advent of SOL, Sony released ALOT of new cool features for PvP, but also introduced more problems as well.  The trouble WE have, however, is that instead of FIXING these problems like we practically BEG, they spend resources and time creating servers like the ROLEPLAY or LEGENDS servers.  Why not FIX what you have before making MORE stuff you will end up having to fix?<br />
<br />
With SOL has come the ultimate death of PvP in EQ, the insta kill.  Manaburn and Lifeburn have created a situation in PvP where parties MUST avoid a confrontation or will face certain, helpless death.  How can pvP exist when one party has the ability to insta kill another?  It is not possible.  So now that SOL has been out for 2 months and folks have manaburn and are using it every chance they can get to insta kill people, what does Sony do?  Nothing.  It is still in game and these "skilled" one shot artists continue to destroy whats left of the population on the Sullon Zek server.<br />
<br />
Is it just this that upsets us?  Or perhaps the multitude of other rediculous bugs/exploits that we constantly bring to their attention, but yet remained unchanged.  What are these bugs which Sony seems to think not worth their attention?  let me tell you:<br />
<br />
1.  Golem Wands:  these items have the ability to instantly strip 20 buffs from a person.  They work as fast as you can click the item.  These make buffs useless in the game bascially making a caster's ability to enhance their abilitites and resists useless.  Taking away buffs from the game would create a PvE inbalance, right?  Then why take them out of PvP?  How hard could this be to fix?  Add a cast time on the wands?  Remove them from the game all together?  Ummm would taking this away create some kind of PvE inbalance?<br />
<br />
2. Recharging items - Well this is basically duping.  It has been brought to the attention of  Sony for over a year now and they still have not fixed it.  It allows people to take used items like conflag wands, egg pumices, golem wands and have them fully "charged".  This is clearly not the intention of the game...especially with the inherent inbalance these items cause in pvP.  These items in pvP fuck it up bad enough without the ability to RECHARGE them on top of everything else.   Why not FIX this?  How hard could it be?<br />
<br />
3. Water bug - Why is a person invulnerbale to spell casting just because they run in and out of the water?  Why do we lose mana casting on someone just casue they run in the water while you are out?   Why should this come into play at all?    This has been a GLARING problem in pvP since DAY ONE and for some ungodly reason is still not repaired.  As one of the most rediculous bugs in PvP, one would think they might take a few minutes to fix it.<br />
<br />
4. Zones -  A part of life, but still one of the most exploited parts of this game.  Take away the fast computer/fast connection advantage of zoning.  Make zoning a mandatory time limit or create a "line" whereby the first person who zones...is the first perosn who pops out.  AT the LEAST make a 2 minute limit on REZONING.  So people don't just zone back and forth back and forth....and then plug, which leads to our next problem.<br />
<br />
5. Zone Plugging - This is the stupidest aspect of PvP i have seen yet (short of water bug and manaburn....ahh well then there is alot...).  Why should someone get to just turn their modem off and instantly be away from PvP death?  Why not make it so they pop through LINK DEAD if they zone plug?  I think many of us are tired of the "brave" people who fight right next to a zone knowing they can just plug to avoid death and then go out and get a bite to eat.<br />
<br />
6. Hill Bugs - If someone runs straight up to the zone boundry, the server seems to send a bogus signal to our puters where that person is going.  FOr some reason it does not show the accurate direction the person is traveling in.<br />
<br />
7. HP Rings - Being able to pull a HP ring to avoid PvP death is stupid.  Folks need to lose EXP if they "die" as opposed to being "slain".<br />
<br />
Sullon Zek was a great idea and we sure as hell appreciated the effort, but there are some glaring issues that need to be addressed!  We all know Sony SERIOUSLY screwed up the teams and have made some other glaring mistakes.  Instead of covering up or making escuses regarding these mistakes, FIX THEM!  You will find alot more of us willing to stay with the game.<br><br></td></tr>
