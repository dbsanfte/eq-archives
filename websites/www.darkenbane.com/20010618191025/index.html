Greetings,<br>
<br>
I am Bruce W Economy, Lead GM Kriggan.  After reviewing your actions within<br>
the world of Norrath, we have determined that they are severe enough to<br>
warrant the banning of your account, GRAYRAGE.  Please make certain that you<br>
contact the Station at 1-858-537-0898 to ensure that your billing is<br>
cancelled.  If you have any questions or concerns regarding this matter<br>
please feel free to contact eqaccountstatus@station.sony.com.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
Bruce W Economy<br>
Lead Game Master Kriggan<br>

As I indicated before, I had thought about continuing to play EQ under other accounts.   I have changed my mind, however, and will be cancleing those accounts as well.  Soon enough we will change the format here to whatever new game we are going to play.<br>
<br>
Good luck to you all who remain playing Everquest.<br><br></td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="1">Submitted by <a href="mailto:grayrage@darkenbane.com">Grayrage</a> on 11-06-2001 17:50</font><p>We have had some discussion and all agreed that Darkenbane MUST be playing a game.  Right now the ONLY game out there worth playing is Everquest, this we will retain a presence in the game.<br>
<br>
Since beta Darkenbane has existed onthe Rallos Zek server and has been a loyal follower of Verant and Sony.  We have never left the game nor threatened to leave as the multitude of other MMP PvP guilds have done (TR, TB, KAAOS, CC, The Mercs).<br>
<br>
Our loyalty, however, has seemingly not been reciprocated as the character account that leads the oldest and probably the largest player guild on Rallos Zek is being reviewed for banning.  As such, we will continue to play on Rallos Zek, but will maintain an awareness of the upcoming MMP Titles expected to be released soon.  Whne released we will test each of the games and decide among ourselves where we will play and what game we will support on our website.<br>
<br>
If Sony decides to disband our guild from the game, we will continue to play Everquest under a different guild name or will join an existing guild, but will surely change games when the new ones come out.  <br>
<br>
I would ask members to please visit the private board as we discuss our course.  I will be playing several alts and will NOT stop killing people.  We will also continue to do events.<br><br></td></tr>

Dear Graraige:<br>
<br>
<br>
Your account is being suspended with a review for permanent banning for<br>
violations of the EverQuest Rules of Conduct governing corpse camping.  The<br>
Rules of Conduct can be found at www.everquest.com.<br>
<br>
The warning for corpse camping issued by Guide Precillan was reviewed per<br>
your request and was found, ultimately, to be valid.  According to the<br>
rules, you must allow a person reasonable access to their corpse.  That<br>
statute was not fulfilled in this instance.<br>
<br>
With the previous suspension of your account, this warning, per our<br>
conversations, mandates a suspension with a review for banning.  Your<br>
account will be reviewed by the appropriate individuals and notification of<br>
banning, should that be the course of action taken, will be emailed to you<br>
before the termination of the suspension period.<br>
<br>
I regret the necessity of this action, but wish you luck in your continuing<br>
endeavors.<br>
<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
<br>
<br>

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="1">Submitted by <a href="mailto:grayrage@darkenbane.com">Grayrage</a> on 06-06-2001 16:40</font><p>As our PvP rules evolve and all of us pray daily for some sort of book or guide, we learn more stuff everyday.  Previously I was under the impression that we only had to let someone who was AT their corpse loot then scoot.  It turns out that this is wrong.   Here is some new info gained from Ozuri during a multitude of conversations after killing some sheep.<br>
<br>
1. We MUST NOT interfere in someone who is trying to retrieve their corpse.  Regardless of WHERE they are.  We are not even allowed to intercept them from reaching their corpse.  Bascially, delibertely preventing someone from doing a CR is considered player harrassment.  The exceptions are as follows:<br>
<br>
a) The person MUST go directly to corpse, loot then leave.<br>
<br>
b) The person cannot med, linger, attack or otherwise do ANYTHING but get his shit and go.<br>
<br>
2. Zone "camping" is still a very VAGUE and scary PvP rule.  It's scary cause SO many fights happen near zones, but it seems to be a pretty arbitrary place or activity for Guide/GM warnings which could lead to bannings.  Ozuri indicates that the ZONE is NOT a viable ESCAPE route, but then says that you cannot attack someone until they have control over their Avatar.  Who determines control?   How much time do you have to give?   Is there REALLy such a thing as not being in control of your Avatar before being attacked at a zone?  I personally find this difficult to deal with as people will zone back and forth repeatedly to avoid PvP death and the only way to MAYBE get a shot in on them is to nuke RIGHT away and even then they often zone back before a nuke can go off.<br>
<br>
IMHO, Zone camping SHOULD NOT EXIST as a PvP rule as it is UNPOLICEABLE and allows for ENORMOUS exploits by fleeing victims.  <br>
