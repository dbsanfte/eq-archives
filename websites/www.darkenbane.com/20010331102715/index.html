Speaking of some changes, the Guild Shortenbane has not been living up to our hopes of a low level DB guild.  After receiving a multitude of complaints from applicants not receiving answers and poor organization, DB is canceling it's support of that guild.<br>
<br>
Taking Shortenbane's place will be the infamous and well renowned guild Flowers of Happiness!  aLL sub 40th level applications will be sent to FOH representative, Talonna, for processing! (starting tommorow so don't submit until the application page has FOH's name on it).<br>

Db will make every effort to support this guild and plans to add them to the PvP ladder when it is done!  Good luck FOH brethren!!<br><br></td></tr>

<br>
Some DBers stayed the entire 14 hours, ordering chinese or pizza and being fed by slaves (errr loved ones) whilst others took breaks for such useless chores as showering and using the toilet (duh...no one has heard of diapers? My god we gotta get these guys straight ;p).<br>
<br>
The marathon began like usual with OUR version of a breakin (killing any players that do not surrender or flee).  In a few short hours the plane was cleared and it was time to test Mr. Thule and his Lt.s.  After getting our asses kicked a few times (we had only ONE freagin' cleric the whole time...jeez) the zone was nice enough to spawn again.<br>
<br>
Cleared it a second time then got our asses kicked again by Casic's big boys  (oooooo  we got those fuukers next time though.  We know their deal now :).<br>
<br>
Loot?!  Yeeeehaw!  Innoruuk musta been chattin' with his pal Casic on our behalf, cause he HOOKED us up!  CHeck it out:<br>
<br>
1. Graraige:  Carmine Gloves, Arms.<br>
2. Meter:  Verm Gloves (Gay intel on these?)<br>
3. Frobin:  Blighted Robe, Cryo Choker<br>
4. Ever:  Carmine Gloves.<br>
5. Celoco:  Misc Thorny Vine (a full freagin' suit dropped practically).<br>
6. Valkar:  SK Bracers.  A BP dropped and it ROTTED before we could rez him...he was like 2 steps from corpse of MOB when it poofed!!!!!!!  /sob<br>
7. Ekimus:  Cryo Cloak, Blighted Gloves<br>
8. Zagg:  Blue Diamond.<br>
9. Yaari:  Diamond.<br>
<br>
Along with various money loot items, runes, words, wands and other crapola the following items rotted (or was picked up by Genaside to aggravate people with):<br>
<br>
1. Pali legs and helm.<br>
2. SK pieces (Valkar already had)<br>
3. Flux axe (s) (rangers had them)<br>
4. 4 Monk drops.<br>
5. Shaman boots (from jello)<br>
6. Bard bracers (from jello)<br>
7. Mage robe (from jello)<br>
8. Just kidding about mage robe to aggravate 801.<br>
9. Some other stuff I can't recall.<br>

All of us have fallen victim to Bards being able to poof our pets with a simple song. Additionally, their unique ability to use clickable CAST time items while running is being discussed on EQ gameplay forum.  The ONLY way this will be fixed is if we make enough noise for them to actually LOOK at the post and the issue so your support IS needed to keep it up front and in the spotlight until it is addressed.<br>

Lots of issues came up inculding the GM indicating a NEW rule advising we were NOT allowed to chase foes across zone boundries!<br>

We all know this is silly, but he SAID it!  The bottom line?  Our server needs a freagin' RULE book.  <a href="http://boards.gamers.com/messages/message_view-topic.asp?name=darkenbane&id=zzaxv"target="_blank">Here's the log of the GM warning us.</a><br>
<br>
Incidentally, did you know that Bard Charm 'poofs' pets?  Can someone explain to me why a simple bard song can make a pet poof whilst it takes a 60th level Druid or Mage spell with a 80 plat regent to do it (and it is resisted on top of that).  Druids and MAges are the "masters" of summoned damage, so why is it a Bard can kill a pet so much easier with no resistance at such an earlier level?  I will tell you why, it is a bug.  FIX IT, please.<br>
<br>
Hmmmm.  Not to pick on Bards to much (ummm Nyce), but does everyone know that Bards can use a crystalized pumice WHILE running?  Or ANY clickable items for that matter.  Well now....this does not seem to be fair to me.  Why can't EVERYONE run and use clickable cast time items?  Because it is a BUG!  FIX IT, please.<br>
<br>
Look for some links regarding these issues on the gameplay forums soon.  /wave Bard.  (apologizes to Gavotte).<br><br></td></tr>

Lead Game Master Valdelmar (Andy Kirton) addressed this issue advising: "It's a severe violation to do this and such actions if caught can lead to banning of the account."<br>

He further discussed that it will be fixed ASAP as he sees it as being unbalancing in PvP in the following statement: "I can see now that it's a<br>
huge problem given the old egg shaped pumices with instant dispell of buffs. I will make sure that this is processed asap."<br>

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="1">Submitted by <a href="mailto:grayrage@darkenbane.com">Grayrage</a> on 13-03-2001 15:09</font><p>Verant Interactive has surely destroyed legitimate player auctions on the popular auction site, EBAY.  They did not support these auctions in past which had inadvertantly led to many scams and fraud.  EBAY <i>did</i> lend credibility to some of these auctions which prevented ALOT of fraud through their user grading system.<br>
<br>
Now, however, scams and fraud are rampant as auctions are removed and buyers who are eager to acquire items and accounts send money without even the protection offered by EBAY to unsavory types who happily steal their money and disapeer.<br>
<br>
EMails have been sent to Verant regarding the obvious increase of scams and fraud as a direct result of their actions taken against ebay with no response having been received by this writer to date.<br>
<br>
As Verant continues it's crusade against out of game player trading, some auction sites still exist and try to add some safety and legitimacy to out of game transactions.  Start ups such as <a href="http://www.playerauctions.com/"target="_blank">PlayerAuctions.com</a> advise that they will resist Verant's attempts to stop them from allowing legitamate player trading with every possible effort in order to provide players a safe place to trade items and accounts without fear of being victimized by thieves.<br><br></td></tr>
