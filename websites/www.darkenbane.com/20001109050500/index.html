Some few pathetic infidels tried to interrupt the event, but were all slain for their efforts whilst to were suspended for intentional traning.<br>

If u did not get an email it's cause you are not on the Dark Pact mailing list anymore (for a variety of reasons) and you should email me to ask why.<br><br></td></tr>

After defeating the other teams on our server, the HP team went on to fight the teams from the other servers finishing on top as should be expected of any team coming from RZ against the homos who play on the blue servers.<br>
<br>
Here is the RZ soldiers who won the day:<br>
<br>
Kaukaz (The Tactician) - 60 TRO WAR <br>

If a VICTIM is not listed please put your pic inthe CLASSIFICATION PENDING folder.  Meter or I will then go through those pics and add the victims and their guilds.  AFTER we have done that you can go back in and update your pics placing them with the correct VICTIMS.  Please also put the name of their GUILD in the description area of the kill.<br>
<br>
ALOT of the victims are not listed with guild info.  PLEASE write down  the names of your victims then check them in game (/who all victim) to see if they have their tag up.  If u have a correct PLEASE EMAIL it to ME!  I will then fix it.<br>
<br>
It is necessary for this information to be accurate for the database to sort everyone properly!!  Please make an effort to do this!!  <br>
<br>
ALSO, Meter will be adding a button that allows us to put our pics int he BACK of our folder if so desired.  This will be nice for uploading ARCHIVED and old pics (I have about 250).  i DO not want my KAAOS kills goin up fron as that shit was like 2 years ago.  So this will be in soon.<br><br></td></tr>

No longer is bickering and squabbling amongst us to be allowed as the Foul Prince of Hatred has voiced his desires to me this day.<br>
No longer will any who covet the Dark or shelter in it's comforting grace be allowed to escape the commands of he who controls that shadow.<br>
<br>
Your alledged prowess in battle and the deeds of evil you perceive wrought from the dark heart of the Father are NOTHING if you do not wield it on behalf of his weopon on Norrath, DARKENBANE! BRING your power to us and be a part of the shuddering obsidian darkness that gathers in the sky as doom approaches the land under the marching tide of the dread soldiers of Darkenbane Company!<br>
<br>
Seek NO MORE for your home foul killers, pirates and murdering scum. Your home is here! We open our arms to ALL who have the HEART and SOUL of power and DARKNESS and who desire to bring that POWER TO BEAR against ALL of the infidels of the land!!! <br>
<br>
If you do not fear the sweet love of hatred and scorn and do not cower from brandishing your power over the heathen prey walking on OUR WORLD, then bring your arms to bear on behalf the voice of the GOD of Darkness and his tools of DOOM!<br>
<br>
No longer will this world survive us. *snarls* It's time to do some killin'.<br>

I also noticed that Morphite uploaded some pics and stored them under Aalamar (the first victim in the list), this is not how it should be done.<br>
If your victim is not in the list select 'Pending Classification', if everyone stores their pics anywhere it will be a mess.<br>
Also pictures that do not classify as kills should be files under victim 'Picture'.<br>
<br>
If people do not updating their Pending Class kill pictures on a regular bases i will start deleting them. You dont have to do it every day but you could at least check once a week.<br>
I will keep you updated as to when i have added the new victim names.<br>
So start updating =)<br>
