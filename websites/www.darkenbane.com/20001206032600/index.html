Wearing the tag in a zone is bound to get several shouts of warning about your presence and assured attacks by greaters numbers of people against you.  We are the ONLY true guild inthe game of Everquest that is PURE PK.  We kill EVERYONE with NO remorse and NO pity.<br>
<br>
The other pretenders who FAILED to be pure pks through their cowardice include The Begotten, The Regulators (dead guild), KAAOS (turned ANTI and DEAD in EQ now anyhow).  These guilds were RENOWNED PKers in UO and other games yet were not able to handle the pressure in EQ having to form alliances and simply STOP PK activities to survive.<br>
<br>
We will NEVER do that.  We are murderers to the end and will ALWAYS be Haven for the PURE killers.  We have, however, had a HARD stance against any quitter of the guild inthe past where they would be KOS regardless of their service in the past.  I have come to realize that not everyone is able to maintain their status in DB and accomplish some necessary goals (like leveling higher and obtaining some gear).<br>
<br>
I DO not want our guild to become a revolving door operation, but we WILL allow folks to leave and return as necessary to pursue their goals while still maintaining their good standing within the organization.  <br>
<br>
Additionally, there are many Dark Pact members who are not and will NEVER be PKers but aid DB in dungeon and Planes runs.  These will also be given amnesty and/or protected when necessary.<br><br></td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="1">Submitted by <a href="mailto:grayrage@darkenbane.com">Grayrage</a> on 16-11-2000 01:09</font><p>After successfully murdering another soulless swine, I was summoned<br>
before Innoruuk. Looking into the face of Hate himself brought a resurgence<br>
of faith in my beloved creator. Overwhelmed by the dramatic scenery of his<br>
hellish lair, i kneeled before him into a puddle of rancid blood. <br>
<br>
After showing favor for my loyal devotion to the Church of<br>
Darkenbane and its dark minions, he offered me a drink from his enchanted<br>
distillery. The wine was composed of fermented gnome blood, and was<br>
unsurprisingly delicious. Innoruuk's presence, however, was more intoxicating than the<br>
wine, so I decided to stay sober. <br>
<br>
Innoruuk taught me lessons<br>
of the Ages and also spoke of the Last Rites of the Tier'Dal. A messenger of<br>
Innoruuk was unknowingly killed by followers of the Underfoot. The messenger<br>
was supposed to deliver the Last Rites of the Teir'Dal to Janys D'Bious.<br>
Brell had intercepted the scroll intended for Janys and replaced it with<br>
words speaking of less evil intention. The Last Rites spoke of total<br>
domination of Norrath, and the elimination of all dragon influences. He told<br>
me that all traitors to Innoruuk must be sacrificed to him at all costs. The<br>
holiest believers of Innoruuk shall be rewarded with showers of blood and<br>
riches. Anything less than mass murder would be considered a disappointment.<br>
<br>
I agreed to spread the word to my fellow believers but Innoruuk implored me<br>
to do more. "True evil is more powerful than The Nameless or any blades of<br>
rightiousness...this is the only key to controlling Norrath" he said, and the<br>
truth was beautiful. Bloodlust, cruelty, revenge, and hate are the positive<br>
traits bestowed upon followers of Hate. False prophets, traitors to Innoruuk,<br>
and those who strive to defeat him must all be slaughtered with extreme<br>
prejudice.<br>

Too late coming out of his bloodlust and realizing his guildies were yellin' not to kill the halpless mindbender.<br>

Watching Jozeph turn into a whirlwind of feet, staves and teeth in Perma gave all behind him the asured knowledge he was bound to receive the 'Nasty Bastard' award this week!<br>

<br>
Four solid groups of Soldiers led by Kulumunga, the fearsome female Ogre Warrior, found the troopers quickly past her personal guards were naught stood betwixt her and the advancing killers of the Dark PAct.<br>
<br>
This Dragon, however, is very clever and placed traps unknown to the soldiers who quickly lost half their force to giant Polar Bears in the bottom of many hidden pits.  These traps combined with the vile 'Link Death' monster caused the mission to end in utter failure as the remaining troopers had to retreat with Lady Vox laughing at their backs.<br>
<br>
9 troopers perished this day.   The living ones only look back desiring a chance at vengence.<br>

OOC:  All Dark PAct personnel please check your emails for a debriefing and for future raid information.  This mission kinda blew.  We can do better.<br><br></td></tr>
