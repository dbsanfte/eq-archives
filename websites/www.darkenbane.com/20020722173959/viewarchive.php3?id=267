<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="1">Submitted by <a href="mailto:grayrage@darkenbane.com">Grayrage</a> on 14-02-2002 14:35</font><p>My apologies on being slow to update the news, but work has been heavy, I have some guests over and Manaburn/Lifeburn has made EQ kinda gay for now (PvP wise).  In any case, there is a buncha stuff I would like to cover:<br />
<br />
1. PvE - We have been wacking a buncha stuff (damn that sounds pathetic ;p)<br />
2. PvP - Have we been avoiding it?<br />
3. The adventures of Dumdi and Guteseele!<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Well, I have been kinda bad about tracking our recent PvE adventures, but that's mostly cause it's stuff we have been doin for a while anyhow like POG, VS, WW Giant.  Basically, we have killed VS now (with Forza and TOW) about 10 times with no Staff drop (but a buncha other loots), we have been workin' on Axxy's epic lately (got those cool +10 MR, +20 FR shoulders off the named Wurm in BW + the guts she needed) and only need 3 pieces now to complete it.<br />
<br />
POG last Saturday (after VS) netted a buncha stuff including a warrior BP (off Treah for Jotok), Warrior Arms (Jotok), Bard Legs (Harmonica), Bard Boots (Harmonica), a couple of those Stonewood Mails, Monk Hat (Trucid) and a few other items.   Wizzie Legs and BL Arms rotted as well (I always remembers the rotting stuff hehe).  Again, it was a LONG day, but with 3 groups we damn near cleared the entire zone which really did not yield the best loots we have gotten from there, but it helped alot (Jo really needed the Beserker stuff).  I believe we also went to COM and jacked Sieges his ORS (cause i took his GBS away from him cause he looked to much like me....hehe).<br />
<br />
What's in the future?  We seem to be doin' quite well with Forza and TOW and I hope to see the 3 guilds doing more in future.  TOW still does stuff without inviting others like TOV, but perhaps soon they will find the added help will aid us all in advancing and perhaps invite others to these things.  The Forza guys have proven to be alot of fun and proficient at doin stuff.   I hope to see us do more stuff with them and will gladly help them out whenever they need it.   VS last night surely looked more like a raid group that we need to create.  I am hopeful that Meter will put up Points system and TOW, DB and Forza can agree to it.  This will truly be a strengthening of the Neutral team when (and if) it get's done.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
Per my article below (regarding PvP), we are not to pleased with the course of pvP on SZ.  The abuse of Golem Wands (recharging), Manaburn and Lifeburn have made PvP often a rediculous joke in favor of those who cheat or abuse certain aspects of the game.  I went into details regarding the issues below, but frankly, i am not to keen on engaging in PvP activities until I am certain some clown who used pathing exploits to get Manaburn will not one shot me.  Additionally, being completely and instantly debuffed everytime I fight a Hate or Ruin member (or many other evils, but those seem to have the "most" wands) has made PvP for me an issue of constantly gating to rebuff.  It is my understanding that Manaburn does not work on even cons anymore, but I have not confirmed this and, sucky as it is, no mention was made of it in the patch message.<br />
<br />
So until they work on some of these aspects of PvP, don't expect us to necessarily stick around for any "battles" such as they may be.  It's a big world and we would just as soon avoid PvP than engage in it when it is so woefully inbalanced at the moment.<br />
<br />
What does all this mean?   Well it's simple really.  We want these issues to be FIXED!  Oh, and while yer at it, SONY, why don't yah just admit you fucked up the Teams on SZ and fix that somehow too (maybe put evil's exp back to the way it is on other servers?).<br />
<br />

<br />
Guteseele and Dumdi flew into Miami International Airport on Sunday.  They went from the frigid temperatures of Germany to the balmy humid 85 degress of a cloudy South Florida night.  It's their first trip to the US and we have introduced them to BBQ sauce, Subway, Pizza (real pizza not the crackers and sauce they have hehe), chicken wings (can you believe they do not have chicken wings there?), Hooters, drive thru banking, Ft. Lauderdale Beach and Strip AND they got to do a little spying and such too!!!<br />
<br />
Today they are driving down to the Keys (though it's a bit rainy today) and tommrrow they plan to hit Cape Canniveral (NASA).  Saturday and Sunday we plan to spend a little time doin some EQ, but will also head to the Sawgrass Mills Mall (prolly the biggest mall in the history of mankind hehe) and perhaps Pure Platinum so they can maybe get laid  (hehe JK!!!).<br />
<br />
Anyhow, we will keep you all updated here on their adventures!<br><br></td></tr>
