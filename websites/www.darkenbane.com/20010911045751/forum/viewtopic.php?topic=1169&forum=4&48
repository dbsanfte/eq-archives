<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" face="sans-serif">I don't know what to make of all of this, but I did not see Shame fighting Ruin when everyone else was.   Instead, i followed him while he slinked around EW and suddenly he stopped.....right at Skee's corpse (a dead Ruin).  I could not help but wonder if he was not preparing to pull the corpse, but he saw me and seemed a bit nervous asking me how did i get there.<BR><BR>Afterward I had a conversation with some other Zanshin members including Blascaster who seemed to think something hinky was goin on.

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" face="sans-serif">Well, I dunno what to make of all of this.  People usually have to do something to earn a reputation.  it does not just spawn randomly.  One thing about Shame is he is a SMOOOOOOOOOOTH talker.    He talk to me SMOOOOOTH no matter how nasty I am to him and as such, I might guess he does the same with our foe?    Heck, I would vote for him Pres.<BR><BR>The thing is, there was stuff done to get him this rep.   I know of other instances that are incriminating, but i was PARTY to it on one occasion and will put down my facts and let everyone else decide.<BR><BR>A large DB gang rape squad was hunting Milt and one of his Hate officers in WK a LONG time ago (Milt was high 30's and leveling on barbs and we were doing spiderlings in Steamfont  lol)  Anyhow after about an hour we killed Milt and his pal.   Some chit chat by Milt went on in OOC (we never bothered to respond) and a member of Zanshin advised Milt that "I was not with them!".    I could not believe my ears that such a pussy existed in our midst and sent this fellow a tell who admitted he was scared of Milt.   I told Shame who basically ignored and never booted the guy.  That was my first indication that Zanshin was a guild of pussies or......traitors.    But who am i to say?<BR><BR>Like i said, if u listen to Shame, he will make you believe anything he wants.  He is a SMOOOOOOOOTH talker.   SHAME for Pres!!!<BR><BR>Here is the pic of the pussy Zanshin bending over for the slick willy by Milt:<BR><BR><img src="http://www.darkenbane.com/pictures/300/4201/large/12193.jpg">

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" face="sans-serif">As my final addition to this "trial" let me explain the quote that I will post below.  Last night we fought Ruin for several hours in GD and EW.   there was shouts and OOC and it was known to everyone that their was a battle ongoing.   I came upon SKee (Ruin) and a nearby Blastacaster (Zanshin) and Blastcaster was asking Skee WHY he had killed him.  Considering a huge battle was ongoing, I thought it quite odd that a Neutral teamate was asking the foe why he killed him.  /shrug.<BR><BR><img src="http://www.darkenbane.com/pictures/300/4201/large/12194.jpg">

You have a picture of a necro walking by him and killing you.  Want me to send you one from earlier in the night were Mezmorirah walked by my guildmate Hocus and was able to 3 shot me?  Does that mean Hocus is a traiter....<BR><BR>As for the corpse dragging.. he dragged Melissandre's corpse and thats all that I know she got ressed and we moved on to lick our wounds.<BR><BR>As for the photo of him sitting on Skee's body both me and Hocus and the rest of the 6 tdc alive in the zone were regrouping their, until ruin arrived and we have to move regroup point.  <BR><BR>On the trade his items issue: I trade with Sect members and frankly will probably trade with IE members.  Some of our gear happens to be in zones they have more access to.  How and what I trade to improve my chances of fighting is my business.  I'd expect Shame considers it the same way.<BR><BR>Lastly and this is the only negative Ill say about Shame.  He started out on SZ and asked to play with us.  I let him, after two weeks it was apparant that he had more selfish interests in mind and since were a team based guild I removed him.  So to this day I would not consider him 'our friend' but as my earlier posts says.. 'my brother, my cousing and I against the infidel'<BR><BR>-end of line<BR><BR>Bone<BR>P.S.

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" face="sans-serif">Well, I don't really know what to say...because most of the time when people believe something, they will do anything and everything to uphold that belief. You find yourself hating Shame, well, I doubt you will shake that belief ever. You people are (the anti-Shame ones) are doing a great job of reinforcing your own suspicions, and not stopping to look at the fact that NOTHING in this thread is even close to hard evidence. Not even close.<BR><BR>"Well here we have shame sitting all alone at a corpse where about 8 ruin will be momentarely but that doesn't bother him..."<BR><BR>No DB would ever see a corpse from a recent battle out in the middle of nowhere and be curious in the slightest. If you saw a DB member sitting by that corpse would you assume he was going to pull it? I doubt that. Would you run off? No, you'd probably want to camp that corpse, and bring in reinforcements. Running off doesn't accomplish that.<BR><BR>"Oh and here is when I ran by Shame sitting near orc fort and the 54+ necro just walks by him and kills me woot note Shame on target:"<BR><BR>Don't know what to say on this one...I don't see Shame in the pic.<BR><BR>"Oh and here's a dandy why what's this? Ahhh yes 2 ruin running by Shame hanging at zone and proceed to attack Belmonto a green Darkenbane instead! Obviously Shame told them there was some greens to kill eh?"<BR><BR>Looks to me like he's running somewhere. Either that or it's the insidious "run-while-sitting" bug that has everyone so worried.<BR><BR>"Oh well but Shame camped those ES Vamps right?"<BR><BR>Shame is known as the highest lvl neut druid on the server. Evils have no druids. They'd want to sell off their druid equip...and Shame is an obvious customer. Who's to say he can't buy an item that he would probably not be able to get normally? Regardless who it's from...ES arms are a good item and what druid wouldn't jump at the chance to get them.<BR><BR>"And Zanshin didn't train Db at the orc fort exactly 2 minutes before Ruin attacked right?"<BR><BR>I doubt this is what you make it out to be.<BR><BR>"but I did not see Shame fighting Ruin when everyone else was."<BR><BR>Whether or not you did or did not see him fighting, the choice is his whether or not he fights. And I saw him put up a hell of a battle with 5 guildmates, against the 10 or so evils at the kith/RV zone, when they didn't even stand a chance. Yet they fought. Ask TDC.<BR><BR>"Shame made an annoucement on his website. In that annoucement he claimed (among other things) that his guild will not corpse camp and will act honorbly."<BR><BR>Check again who posted that, and you'll see a name at the end of the post that does not resemble "Shame".<BR><BR>"Blastcaster was asking Skee WHY he had killed him"<BR><BR>So? You would never do something like...oh I dunno...type /congratulate after a deep red wiz kills you in almost one nuke...such things are somewhat comical.<BR><BR><BR>Guys, I'm not trying to convince you that Shame is the Messiah. I'm just trying to show you that Shame is not the completely bad, evil-ally that you make him out to be. Your entire viewpoint is so skewed by the fact that "Oh Shame is allied with Ruin" you think that every time you see him he's doing something that makes him bad. Put anyone under the microscope, so to speak, as you are doing with Shame. I can come up with a nearly identical thread accusing nearly any neut on the server of the exact same thing you accuse Shame of.<BR><BR>Sometimes Shame fights with evils, sometimes he buys items not normally available to him from them. Just because he is neut doesn't mean he has to bend over backwards at every opportunity just to please every other neut. Give it a rest. Shame isn't the malevolent bastard you make him out to be. He's a good guy, a good player, and DOES help out other neutrals.</FONT><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" face="sans-serif">Bohn,<BR><BR>Please advise what u think of the pic of the zanshin member groveling to Hate leader.  Also, do you have any comments about what the member Blastcaster said?    Lastly, i saw the WD hit one of the bogies....was he the only 53 druid there?   <BR><BR>The Ruin he killed is an even con to a 40 thus green to Shame.   It would have been a bit more convincing had he killed an even con in battle.<BR><BR>Double lastly, their website claims they will not corpse camp or bind camp yet they obviously did it the day before yesterday (se my post) to a non ruin evil.  I don't have a problem corpse camping (i actually enjoy it), but the hypocracy behind the cowardly statement (because the only reason they would not say it is in the hopes it is not done tot hem) that they do not do it is quite clear.  But the fact of the matter is they DID do it which shows a tendanceny to dishonesty (cause they DID do it).<BR><BR>He may be innocent or not, but I can't help but wonder why ll these accusations exist.  Did folks just amke it up?  Or do stupid lame shit like what his member did with our HATE kill cause him all these troubles.  If one of our members said that in OOC he woulda been removed.<BR><BR>In conclusion,  I see a rift in the Neutral team appearing here.  Several of our members seem to hold strong feeling regarding this issue and wish to have nothing to do with the guild.  I am not certain that this will even be available for change.  If this does comes to pass we will have to decide if any events or PvP engagements will occurr when Zanshin is present.  Our groups may simply leave a zone when a PvP engagement is eminant if Zanshin is present (some say that the elites were trained on them right when Ruin ported into IC which caused us not to be part of the fight).<BR><BR>If this occurs, TDC will end up having to build their relationship with guild Zanshin and not Darkenbane.  A firm decision will have to be made soon.  Please go over ALL of the evidence above and don;t skip any for explanations.  I would like to know why member Blastcaster said those things and why the member in WK kissed Milt's ass after we killed him.   I want to know why Kivik quit the guild and Deas quit the guild.

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" face="sans-serif">Listen, my thoughts on this:<BR><BR>Shame is trying to play both sides.   I think he has friends in Ruin and trys to play both sides fo the fence.  He prolly needs to just come clean and tell us what's up and what we can expect from him.

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" face="sans-serif">I may well get kicked out of Zanshin for posting here since I'm not a guild officer. Since I like being in Zanshin let me say this first. I speak for me and am not speaking in any official capacity for the guild. I am speaking as one of the first members in the guild. Before Deas, Kivik, Keidis, Ramladu.<BR><BR>Kivik quit because Shame wouldn't drop what he was doing and port him around. I don't take logs and such (game not that important that I need evidence. I do have some screen shots of me getting PK'ed in the thurg bank when i was 15th), but I talked to Kevik and I am convinced it was a personal issue between them.<BR><BR>Deas, like his friends, has in the past shown an ability to jump to conclusions or get a little hot under the collar when a cool head would be in order.  I believe that is what happened here. <BR><BR>I wasn't in IC or EW the day all this stuff happened. I'm only 24th so I don't get to do that stuff yet. I looked at the screen shots and several looked misinterpreted to me. Maybe i'm wrong...I didn't think you could quad kite evils. 1 57th anything isn't going to take on a group of even conns, or even a group of high greens. <BR><BR>About the corpse camping. If I'm not mistaken that was done to teach the guy a lesson. He CC'ed Magruda for over a level worth of exp. We do not CC or BC and we allow LnS..if they are given to us. If you screw with us; you should expect the same.<BR><BR>I post here because I respect TDC and Gladius and several other guilds that will read this.  If Shame is allied with Ruin, I have one question: Where the hell is my Loot?<BR><BR>And in conclussion and there is one; If you want to get to know Zanshin give me, or ganomee, or Cinnamon, or any Zanshin member a tell, group with us...see what you think. Don't let your opinions be based on a screen shot that proves only one thing: 40th Necros are smart enough to ignore a 57th druid.<BR></FONT><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" face="sans-serif">Oh, I have no doubt shame might have an associate or friend in Ruin.  Hell I fight IE daily but Nafgar and I are as close to 'drinking buddies' as I want to get with a internet enemy.  I'd probably never camp his corpse, I'd probably extend him the curtesy of a reach around before I assfucked him to much (ie bind camping)... but there draws the line.  He's my enemy and come fight time he drops.<BR><BR>I dont know shame personally and frankly I dont think any of us do.  I'm fairly confident he is 2 people.  This btw is why he got booted from TDC.  His brother was behaving like a greedy fuck and harming fellow guild mates and I instantly booted him.  Later the 'real' shame apologized for his brother actions etc etc.<BR><BR>It may or may not explain things but at this point I could care less.  TDC is 'warmly' to Darkenbane (a recent development) and 'indiffirent'-'scowls' to all others.  If you want to osterize or black ball shame it your business and I'd cover that bridge in any join effort we did when it comes.<BR><BR>Bone<BR><BR>P.S. saw this and thought it appropriate:<BR>"Shame did NOT help the evils at all. He was trying to kill us. He was in the bridge battle and later on in a battle at thurg. He did not make things any easier." -Abbu<BR><BR><BR><font size=-1>[ This Message was edited by: BoneDancer-SiN on 2001-08-14 22:48 ]</font></FONT><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" face="sans-serif">"It would have been a bit more convincing had he killed an even con in battle."<BR><BR>So...he kills evils, but now it's not enough. Basically I see you, Grayrage, creating hoops that Shame has to jump through to earn your "respect" back. At least you agree to the part that Shame does kill evils. As far as I know, you don't kill people you are allied with.<BR><BR>"Double lastly, their website claims they will not corpse camp or bind camp yet they obviously did it the day before yesterday (se my post) to a non ruin evil."<BR><BR>You have no proof. MAYBE they corpse camped, maybe not. Maybe the guy came up and kept attacking. That warrants repeated killing. You have no idea what happened, nor if the guy deserved the CCing, if it even took place.<BR><BR>"I am not certain that this will even be available for change. If this does comes to pass we will have to decide if any events or PvP engagements will occurr when Zanshin is present."<BR><BR>The holier-than-thou attitude I've come to expect from Darkenbane on my many dealings with them (on RZ as well as SZ). Once you get it into your collective heads to not like someone, you never change.<BR><BR>"Shame is trying to play both sides. I think he has friends in Ruin and trys to play both sides fo the fence. He prolly needs to just come clean and tell us what's up and what we can expect from him."<BR><BR>Look at the actual evidence, instead of the huge gaps you are crossing with your paper-thin reasoning. Shame has killed evils, Shame has helped neutrals, Shame leads a guild of people who, just recently, did a raid on an evil zone. Many evils were killed, and got exp loss. Shame started a battle against evils camping the RV/kith zone, Ruin among them. Allies don't call people against you, and participate in your killing. If you were Ruin, would you appreciate Shame calling a bunch of neuts on you? Probably not.<BR><BR>"I would like to know why member Blastcaster said those things..."<BR><BR>You mean, told you what Nizzarr said? That he didn't kill Blastcaster because of his tag? Well that's a good question. Ask Nizzarr.<BR><BR>"...and why the member in WK kissed Milt's ass after we killed him."<BR><BR>Sure it's not the most honorable thing to do. But who wants to incur the wrath of a higher level player? And maybe he was just joking around.<BR><BR>"I want to know why Kivik quit the guild and Deas quit the guild."<BR><BR>If they want to tell you, I'm sure they will. But as for anyone in Zanshin telling you, they either don't know, or realize that it's guild business and not your's. Nobody asks you why people leave Darkenbane.<BR><BR><BR>Rumors start. They grow. I'm reasonably sure that's all this is. A rumor blown up way the hell out of proportion, fueled by people that don't like Shame, and inconclusive screenshots.<BR><BR>Try to take this as an alternate viewpoint to your anti-Shame propaganda. Respect my opinion, and consider it. This isn't conclusive evidence in any way, in either direction. But I don't think anyone has even stopped to think that maybe this is just a rumor. You say evidence keeps coming up, but that's the problem: it's not really evidence. No real conclusions can be derived from any of the screenshots posted above.<BR><BR><BR><BR>EDIT: Looks like Pavis already mentioned Kivik and Deas. Didn't notice that.<BR>Also, the corpse camping thing...looks like Shame killed him a couple times then Magruda and Tikku took over (looks pretty brutal from the timestamps). Zanshin usually doesn't corpse camp. This guy probably did something to warrant it.<BR><BR><font size=-1>[ This Message was edited by: MonkeyThief on 2001-08-14 23:51 ]</font></FONT><BR>
