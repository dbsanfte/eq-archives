<font style="font-size:9px">Posted by <a href="mailto:grayrage@darkenbane.com">Grayrage</a></font><p>Well, as folks by now should know, Discord was the temporary "hard core" Everquest server where death resets a person to level 1 and all of their gear is lootable.  27,000 characters (only 1 per account was allowed) were made on Discord over it's month long life with it topping the population server list for the first few days.  Darkenbane, entered the competition among many other organized Guilds and ended up completely dominating the server.  Anyone above level 6 was forced to camp or flee as DBers swept across the globe.  The end result found 4 out of the 6 winners Darkenbane with one being left out because his name violated the naming policy (Apostle).  Sony made 2 posts about the selection process and then the winner post which I will go over.<br />
<br />
<i><b>"While you are waiting for the winners..<br />
Some interesting Discord tidbits for you to peruse.<br />
<br />
Over Discords nearly four week run you all created over 27000 characters there.  <br />
<br />
The majority were Humans at 19%, with Dark Elves coming in second at 14%.  <br />
<br />
The Vah Shir were the least played race at a mere .1% of the Discord population, poor kitties.  <br />
<br />
Dark Elf necromancers were the most common race/class combo and necromancers were the most common class overall.  <br />
<br />
One character managed to make it to level 44 (a High Elf cleric) and stay there, with several others leveling to the mid 40's and high 30's.<br />
<br />
There were so many looted corpses I can't even get the logs to pull them all but a rough guess would be about 1000 a day.<br />
<br />
We hope you enjoyed Discord.  We will be evaluating the results of this cycle prior to announcing any new contests or server rule sets.  <br />
<br />
We know that there were some problems with cheaters and we appreciate all of your help, as a community, in tracking them down.  Our programmers are working on new code to try and remove even more of the cheats they are using but we will still need your help.  Please, if you can, take the time to submit your feedback regarding Discord using the Submit Comment link below. <br />
<br />
Thanks much for all of your help.<br />
<br />
Brenlo the Statistician"</i></b><br />
<br />
<br />
As you can see from Brenlo's post, they confirmed that no one who used hacks will be considered for victory.  Also, he made it pretty clear that ALOT of folks tried their hand at this server.  Unfortuntely, the "naming policy" nailed one of us as he was left off the list.   Apostle had more points then several guys named on that list (I am sure WAY more then that level 18 necro none of us ever heard of).  In any case, here is Sony's announcement of the winners:<br />
<br />
<i><b>"And the Discord Winners Are....<br />
Here they are, the top six player killers on Discord.  These are the 6 that showed the most tenacity and resolve.  They fought against unspeakable odds to make their mark on the world of Norrath.  These six persevered when others faltered to fight for their honor and beliefs.  Let us gather together and praise these six Discord heroes for all they have accomplished in the last four weeks.  Each of these adventurers is the essence of PK perfection, the bringer of terror and chaos to all who fell before them.  They are the pinnacles of Discord.  <br />
<br />
So without any further ado and with great pleasure I would like to ask you all to join me in congratulating....<br />
<br />
Your Discord Champions!!<br />
<br />
Redwin the 24th level Halfling druid<br />
Dang the 24th level Gnome magician<br />
Awakened the 20th level High Elf wizard<br />
Korpo the 24th level Gnome magician<br />
Searyx the 37th level Dark Elf cleric<br />
Trindamere the 18th level Dark Elf necromancer<br />
<br />
Congratulations to you all.  Well done indeed!<br />
<br />
Brenlo the Master of Ceremonies"</i></b><br />
<br />
Congratulations goes out surely to the winners who I will now go over in detail:<br />
<br />
<i>Redwin the 24th level Halfling druid</i> - Darkenbane's MUCH better version of the "Sams", Redwin was always helpful to all DBers and alot of fun in Teamspeak and on Discord.  He was always smart in his PvP and never made mistakes.  His enemies hated him whilst his friends all  respected him.  He was from Sullon Zek and had considerable experience as a "hard core" PvPer!<br />
<br />
<i>Dang the 24th level Gnome magician</i> - Another member of Darkenbane, Dang came from both Sullon Zek (Nine, Vindi, ToW) and Rallos Zek prior to that.   Having a long history of PvP paid off on Discord as she was methodical in her killing alongside many friends.  Well respected among the guild, Dang was yet another member who was deserved of this honor!<br />
<br />
<i>Awakened the 20th level High Elf wizard</i> - A newer member of Darkenbane, Awakened (a 24th Wizzie not 20th) quickly found a home amonst fellow PKers.  It was a rocky start, however, as he almost was removed for accidentally killing his own mates (not checking the channel).  Instead, he paid a penalty and helped his "victims" level back up :D  Soon, Awakened became the butt of many jokes implying he was cleaning out more DBers then the anti-DBers!  All joking aside, the reason he was allowed to remain DB was because everyone liked him and enjoyed him as a fellow killer.  Additionally, Awakened was often used by us as "bait" to catch cheaters as we camped in a trap spot and waited for them to pop on top of the "solo" Awkakened.   They found out quickly enough he was not so solo after all! He is undoubtedly a great PvPer and earned this honor!<br />
<br />
<i>Korpo the 24th level Gnome magician</i> - Korpo was the final Darkenbane LISTED as a winner of the Discord competition and was a feared Gnome Mage on Antonica around the Oasis area.  He often utilized ambush strategies to kill foes who usually gated or camped anytime he was within a zone of them.  He would camp at a well known leveling spot of victims and then login after determining they were in his trap.   Our guild channel often got the pleasure of his stories of wiping out almost full groups as he suprised them uncamping right in the middle of them!  A clever Pker indeed deserved this win!<br />
<br />
<i>Searyx the 37th level Dark Elf cleric</i> - This person often lead the resistance against Darkenbane and was one of the folks responsibilbe for the little organization they had.  He had some class as a PvPer and never talked shit after a defeat.  We are not quite sure how he got his points as he was an "anti-PKer" and did not kill many DBers that we are aware of, but suspect other anti-Pkers "sacced" to him to boost his points.  He did admit that folks in their alliance were using cheats (Saromon specifically), but at the least was not a hypocryt accusing DB of using them whilst hanging out with known hackers.  Whatever the case may be, if a non DBer was to win, I cannot think of someone who would deserve it more then someone who often organized the resistance against us and did so with class.<br />
<br />
<i>Trindamere the 18th level Dark Elf necromancer</i> -  We have no clue who this is. <br />
<br />
Finally, I would like to give props to a guy who we KNOW had the points to be on this list and we KNOW did not cheat or hack, but was left off of it because his name violated Sony's naming policy.<br />
<br />
<i>Apostle the 44th High Elf Cleric</i> -  Part of the Pyratt/Farglebump brother combo, they are from Sullon Zek and surely prived their mettle there as a Druid/Ranger combo feared among their foes.  On Discord, they again showed their PvP prowess right fromthe start killing a then level 30+ Kirban Necromancer.  His brother played Skervy a level 40ish mage who died, but then rerolled to MAthias a Ranger.  Apostle never died and was feared throughout the server.  He and his brother were a great PK combo and deserved a spot on this list.  It's sad they were left off.<br />
<br />
It was a great effort by everyone and alot of fun!  If there is a Discord II before we start the World of Warcraft beta, look for DB once again!<br />
