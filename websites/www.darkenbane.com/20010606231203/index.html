<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="1">Submitted by <a href="mailto:grayrage@darkenbane.com">Grayrage</a> on 06-06-2001 16:40</font><p>As our PvP rules evolve and all of us pray daily for some sort of book or guide, we learn more stuff everyday.  Previously I was under the impression that we only had to let someone who was AT their corpse loot then scoot.  It turns out that this is wrong.   Here is some new info gained from Ozuri during a multitude of conversations after killing some sheep.<br>
<br>
1. We MUST NOT interfere in someone who is trying to retrieve their corpse.  Regardless of WHERE they are.  We are not even allowed to intercept them from reaching their corpse.  Bascially, delibertely preventing someone from doing a CR is considered player harrassment.  The exceptions are as follows:<br>
<br>
a) The person MUST go directly to corpse, loot then leave.<br>
<br>
b) The person cannot med, linger, attack or otherwise do ANYTHING but get his shit and go.<br>
<br>
2. Zone "camping" is still a very VAGUE and scary PvP rule.  It's scary cause SO many fights happen near zones, but it seems to be a pretty arbitrary place or activity for Guide/GM warnings which could lead to bannings.  Ozuri indicates that the ZONE is NOT a viable ESCAPE route, but then says that you cannot attack someone until they have control over their Avatar.  Who determines control?   How much time do you have to give?   Is there REALLy such a thing as not being in control of your Avatar before being attacked at a zone?  I personally find this difficult to deal with as people will zone back and forth repeatedly to avoid PvP death and the only way to MAYBE get a shot in on them is to nuke RIGHT away and even then they often zone back before a nuke can go off.<br>
<br>
IMHO, Zone camping SHOULD NOT EXIST as a PvP rule as it is UNPOLICEABLE and allows for ENORMOUS exploits by fleeing victims.  <br>

Pretty weak loot day.  We ran off also to do some dragon for Yoink's epic, but he was hiding (was not spawned) so we went and keeled some folks instead :)<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Updating the points is V ERY time consumiong for me and I am just not able to keep up with it.  The sytem, however, is good but we need to automate it.  Basically people will add their OWN points for events.   After an event it will be added tot he list.  The player is then gonna be responsible for pluggin' in the amount of hours (points) they were present.<br>
<br>
Obviously we will be monitoring for abuse.  Anyone caught putting in the wrong amount of hours will be punished by either being docked points or kicked from the planes group.  I will be updating the points this weekend for one final time (from the last events) then we will switch over to the new system.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
NOTE TO ALL NON-DB Dark Pact Members:  We have moved from the email system we were using before to planning raids on the private board.  YOU MUST CREATE an account on our message board system which THEN must be approved by Meter or myself for private board access.  Then you can read about upcoming events and make plans to attend.<br><br></td></tr>

** Zone Changes **<br>
<br>
- Runnyeye has been changed. Something is up in Goblin land...<br>
<br>
<br>
** Spell and Song Changes and Bug Fixes **<br>
<br>
- We've been fixing holes in the spell stacking code. For the most <br>
part the changes fix bugs that allowed tricks to get spells to <br>
stack that were never intended to stack.<br>
<br>
- Increased duration on Bard Charm songs to 18 seconds from 12 seconds.<br>
<br>
- Fixed the Spell Scroll for Imbue Amber so that Erudite Clerics of <br>
Cazic Thule can scribe it.<br>
<br>
- The casting messages for Necromancer pet summoning spells have been <br>
changed to be more appropriate.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
** Features and Interface Changes **<br>
<br>
- The variable %t will now work with /assist. So you can use /assist %t <br>
if you wish. Though it should have exactly the same effect as /assist <br>
without the %t.<br>
<br>
- %r returns "corpse" for corpses and "NPC" for targeted NPCs.<br>
<br>
- Sense traps failure message text color has been changed to <br>
user color 15 (same as other skill messages). The success message <br>
was already set to user color 15.<br>
<br>
- Ignore Lists now work the same way that the Friends List does. <br>
It has been expanded to 30 names per character per server. The new <br>
ignore list is stored in the same ini file as the friends list <br>
(<character name>_<#>.ini). The first time a character is created or <br>
loaded after the patch their new ignore list will be a copy of the old <br>
ignore list, but will from then on be unique to the character.<br>
<br>
- The Alt key now works in several new situations. It will now show <br>
item names when in the trade window. Because the trade items of the <br>
local player and the trading partner are so close together, the item <br>
names of the trading partner will always show up unless the player <br>
positions their mouse pointer over the local player part of the trade <br>
window, which will cause the game to only show the local player's trade <br>
item names.<br>
<br>
- The Alt key will show item names for items in your bank.<br>
<br>
- The Alt key will also pop up names for merchant items and corpse <br>
items when you hold it down in merchant mode or loot mode.<br>
<br>
- The Alt key will even pop up names for items in open containers when <br>
held down and the mouse cursor is over the open container window (they <br>
don't show up otherwise).<br>
<br>
- The client will now automatically reject a /duel request from any <br>
player that is on your /ignore list. Some players were using this <br>
to annoy players that had ignored them.<br>
<br>
- You also will no longer see /consent messages from people that are <br>
on your /ignore list (this was also something people were doing to <br>
annoy people that had ignored them).<br>
<br>
- /who GUILD (and the GUILD must be in caps) will now show you the <br>
members of your guild in your zone. You can also specify a guild name, <br>
such as /who "Irontoe Brigade".<br>
<br>
- /safelock command added. /safelock will lock the EverQuest interface <br>
(mostly just mouse clicks, keyboard commands/movement, and most slash <br>
commands) with the password that you supply to the command. You must use <br>
this command a second time, supplying the same password, to unlock the <br>
interface. Passwords are NOT case-sensitive. So to lock your interface, <br>
you would type /safelock password. You would do the same to unlock it. <br>
REMEMBER: If you forget what password you typed, you will need to <br>
reboot your machine.<br>
<br>
<br>
** Item Changes **<br>
<br>
- All the shields in the game that have the Ribcage graphic should now <br>
also have the ribcage icon when they are in your inventory.<br>
<br>
- Tinkered Watchman helm should show up now.<br>
<br>
- Ring of Pureblood is now equipable only on your fingers instead of <br>
your waist.<br>
<br>
- Grand Master's Leg Wraps and Fists of the Grand Master are now No-Drop. <br>
They were intended to be No-Drop when they were created. <br>
<br>
- Peacekeeper Staff and the Bug Collection box are no longer equipable. <br>
There are problems that can arise when containers can be equipped, so <br>
we had to disable that for these items.<br>
<br>
- Sewing Kits: No existing sewing kits are being changed with this <br>
patch. But from now on, kits sold on vendors will be somewhat different. <br>
Large Sewing Kits will have 8 slots. Deluxe Sewing Kits will have 10 <br>
slots and weight slightly more than the Large Sewing Kit.<br>
<br>
- Changed the color of the Kael SK quest armor from a very pretty <br>
blue-green to a more appropriate reddish-gray.<br>
<br>
<br>
** Other Stuff **<br>
<br>
- Changed the spelling of Troubador to Troubadour for the 55th level <br>
bard title. :)<br>
<br>
- King Tormax's spawn rate has been adjusted to be more in line with <br>
that of his counterparts in Velious. This is not the sort of thing <br>
that we will usually announce, as spawn times and things of that <br>
nature are part of the dynamic content of EverQuest. We're <br>
announcing this, however, to help avoid some confusion.<br>

<br>
--------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Right when logging I realized it was necessary for me to clarify DB's position and policy on various issues in game as follows:<br>
<br>
1. Killing naked (folks on CR) - Previously we frowned on DBers wacking dudes who were obviously naked and on CR.  A recent incident with Menarya (a mid 50's SK in Seekers of Divinity) has changed our opinion on this.  We were on a killing spree when we ran across this naked SK.  We checked her and saw she was neked...an easy kill for sure as every root, snare interrupt and stun would stick.  She was likely on a CR so we waved and moved on.  About 5 minutes later we found ourselves in a battle with some bogies and this SK came up and HT'd me for 800+ points (still naked).  For minimal mana we could have easily ridded ourselves of this threat, but our mercy and 'respect' for other players came back and bit us good.   Incidentally, after we did kill her anyhow we asked why she figured we did not attack her when we had first seen her.  Anyone care to guess her response?  "You were scared".  As such, we will kill folks if for no other reason than to elliminate them as a threat.  If we are just passing through and the naked bogie can't hurt us, we will prolly still cut them some slack, but otherwise expect the plunger.  /thanks Menarya.<br>
<br>
2. Bank Killing - Folks have been doin' this to us since they figured out how to do it.  Long ago we had stopped petitioning GMs knowing it was virtually impossible for them to police the activity.  Ozuri has obviously realized this as well and simply made the banks NOT a safe spot to just erase the problem from their end all together...and from ours as well.  We no longer have to be JUST the recipients of bank attacks (because WE followed the rules before).  As such, PvP at banks is now allowed.  As a qualifier, however, banks are NOT to be camped or farmed for victims.  An occasional raid to a well know 'hang out' bank is ok, but just sitting there for hours is likely gonna get this outlawed again so try to nail folks there when yer feeling extra spunky as opposed to making it your camp.<br>
<br>
3. Corpse camping/Bind Camping - I usually keel folks and move on, so this is not really an issue.  Sometimes, however, a person is keeled in a spot where we are doin' something (Fear or Hate) and as such we will ask them to grab their stuff and scram.  Per Ozuri, we SHOULD let them loot (and we will), but they DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO JUST HANG OUT and med.  Bottom line:  give them a reasonable chance to get their gear and gate or run off and warn them if they do not.  If they fail to comply then sick pets on them to conserve mana.  If at anytime a person on CR attacks you or any DB (before getting their corpse) all bets are off.  They can and should be slain until we are done doin whatever it is we are doin'.  Let's see them on the top ten ;p<br>
<br>
4. Zone/Portal Camping.  ON portals the rule is to wait until the person has CONTROL of his character.  I am gonna say this is 3 seconds from the time you see them or they move (whichever comes first).  There is NOTHING wrong with killing folks at portals as long as you make sure they have control of their guy to give them a chance at escape.  I would not recomend hanging out at portals, but making passes at them is just fine (since the goodies love to hang out there).  Zone camping is a little different, because it has a quick avenue of escape (simply backing up and pulling the plug).  I don't believe there is a control issue here as I have failed to get a 2 second spell off on a zone tag we were playing the other day.  According to Ozuri the ZONE IS NOT AN ESCAPE from PvP.  So feel free to chase folks across the zone and wack them.  Wars at zones are inevitable as well.  It's all part of life on RZ in EQ....deal with it and don't bug the GMs.  Kill first, ask questions later ;p<br>
<br>
5. Guard Agro Range - This is sort of like the MOB Agro thing.  If you attack someone and you are standing near a MOB, the MOB will agro you.  So the common method of attacking someone is to attack AWAY from a MOB so the MOBs don't beat you senseless.  The same thing goes with the guards.  Even if you have good faction, often the guards will agro you if you wack someone near them.  It is common sense to stay out of their awareness when PvPing.  I am not to fond of PvP spell casting through walls, but it seems like it will be part of life or healing and other beneficial spells will be removed if they get rid of ill intentioned ones....and the bluebies will cry if we take that away ;p<br>
<br>
6. Event interference - It is DB's policy not to interfere with other events in progress with the exception of organizations that have interfered in our events.  As such, we will not attack organized raid groups when they are conducting an event and will try to shape our events around others that are currently involved in an event at a location.  Currently there is no group or organization that has violated this policy in relation to DB.<br>
<br>
OK.  I should have the pics up for everyone soon!  Glad to be back bros!!!!!!!   OH!  /makes a face.  Congratulations to PRAXX for winning the DROOD TOT on RZ.   As much as he is a *(^*&^$*^$@  (hehe) we still want him to own the other servers ;p  Sorry we kept so many folks from watching your triumph that night btw ;p<br><br></td></tr>

<br>
On Friday night, DB broke Fear (we are getting good at it).  Here is the stuff that did not rot or get destroyed:<br>
<br>
1. Yaari-Cryosilk Cloak<br>
2. Uaelueliu-Carmine Gloves<br>
3. Ssukon-Diamond<br>
4. Graraige-Cryosilk Cloak<br>
<br>

<br>
Saturday in Fear was much better for loot drops.  We killed Dread also.  Here is the goodies dropped:<br>
<br>
1. Finastik-Cryosilk Cloak (sheesh)<br>
2. Melakwa-Jacinth<br>
3. Bamkrak-SK Gloves<br>
4. Enlucent-Carmine Boots<br>
5. Kulumalda-Some ball thing for her epic off Dread.<br>
6. Zearathero-SK Bracer<br>
7. Smoek-Cleric Belt (the droppable one)<br>
8. Ekimus-Jacinth<br>
9. Einnod-Another of those cleric belts.<br>

--------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
After pretty much clearing Fear Saturday, we were plodding along with the temple (about 10 MOBs left) when we got word a crowd of folks was organizing to duke it out with us.  Well we buffed up and got ready, but they did not come.  We got bored and gated to Feerot so we could smash them there, but they zoned into Fear right when WE zoned out for them (unbelievable).<br>
<br>
In any case, we ran back to Fear and attacked.  <a href="http://boards.gamers.com/messages/message_view-topic.asp?name=darkenbane&id=zyusd"target="_blank">Here is a log of that fun ass fight.</a>  We got some goodies from them too :)<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Well we went to Hate on Sunday and, unfortutely I had to work.  I was able to help in porting everyone up, but I could not stay for the debacle of a raid (good thing too...as I heard it was a mess).<br>
<br>
Break in went ok...we camped two clerics and had our corpse pullers bring corpses to the safe spot without to much trouble.  I logged after that, but from what i heard...NOT ONE DRUID WAS PRESENT TO SNARE MOBS.  Unbelievable.  Genaside and myself were the only wizards and we had to let the new Maule (new ownership) back into the guild so he could help with porting duties.  Ever came late with a group, but of all 20 or so DB druids there was not ONE in Hate Sunday.  Only 1 necro...1 wizzie (after I left).<br>
<br>
Bleh, as everyone can see that was a disapointing raid.  In themiddle of everyone dying 50 times, TASH did get his purple people eater pants.  Grats Tash...u don't look like a newb so much anymore ;p  In any case, see the next section on some adjustments we will make ot the points system to try to fix the gay unresponsiveness of folks who don't show up for "their" Plane.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Points Rules changes:<br>
<br>
1. Axxeron will be in charge of logging people IN and OUT of all events.  DP members MUST send her a tell and get confirmation on when they ARRIVE and when they LEAVE an event.  If they FAIL to check in, they will NOT get points.<br>
<br>
2. DP members will now get 1 point per hour of attendance at DP events.<br>
<br>
3. We are considering a minor penalty for those DP members who do not attend events.  This way a druid who goes only on Fear raids can expect to lose points for missing all of the Hate raids.  I will think about this, but will probably deduct 3 to 4 points from people who miss events entirely.  Even showing up at all will prevent this loss of points.<br><br></td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="1">Submitted by <a href="mailto:grayrage@darkenbane.com">Grayrage</a> on 05-05-2001 01:42</font><p>Absor posted some GREAT news for PvP on the developer's corner at the Everquest website!!  Check it out!<br>
------------------------------------------------<br>
<p align="left"><font size="2">When we patch next, the following changes will be implemented on the PvP servers:<br>
Consider: /Consider will only have three results when used to consider a Player Character. The character will show as 'green' if he is below the range that allows you to attack him. The character will show as 'white/black' if he is within your ability to attack. And the character will show as 'red' if he is above your range.<br>
<br>
Sanctuary Levels: Characters below level six will not be able to engage in PvP combat, unless they take part in a Guild War, duel or use the Arena.<br>
<br>
De-Leveling: Characters that lose levels will only retain the skills of a character two levels higher. This means that if a character of level 10 somehow loses 5 levels, that character will only have skills that would be available to a 7th level character. This change will apply to all servers (it has to, code-wise). So the two level buffer is there to make certain that people that lose levels during normal gameplay will be minimally affected (hopefully not affected at all), while those that purposefully lose levels with the intent of causing other players grief will find themselves at no great advantage.<br>
<br>
There may very well be other changes in the patch, so read the patch message carefully. And this is only the first of the things that we plan to change, so don't worry that this is all that we plan to do. We are taking a careful, step-by-step approach to changes whenever we can.<br>
