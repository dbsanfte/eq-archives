In an effort to maintain contact with their customers and shape Planetside around the ideas of the gamer, PS developers have posted on open forums some ideas they wish to add.   They are asking for YOUR opinion (believe it or not).  Here is the post:<br />
<br />
<b><i>Folks, <br />
As you've seen from the first month, Planetside gets a fairly steady flow of changes and enhancements in gameplay on a regular basis. We've got some more already done or in progress for you, for instance the Liberator which is being balanced and tested right now, and we'd like to gather some suggestions from you the players on how we can further improve the gameplay. <br />
<br />
We have two short term goals we're looking at with this post/discussion in particular. We'd like to improve the defense value and reward of bases, and we'd like to add some new game mechanics which will drive a larger variety and diversity of play. On the first point we're already in progress on higher rewards for kills made on defense, but there are plenty of other suggestions there we're sure. For the second we're currently looking at some form of base ownership to Outfits (probably not in a permanent sense, but more in the "we declare this our turf" sense). But we'd like your ideas there as well.<br />
<br />
Please use this thread to post those ideas if you think they are applicable. We encourage them all, and will read them all. It will help us get the best use of the thread if people do NOT post saying how much they like or dislike this or that idea - we'll start a separate thread for *discussion* of this one, please don't make "me too" kind of posts here. Also understand that while we may respond to some ideas and not to others, that doesn't mean any particular favor one way or the other - we'll be reading all of the posts, and also looking at our internal ideas of course.<br />
<br />
Our objective? By the end of this coming month we want to have a better variety of game play, more things to do, different ways to fight. Some ideas are doable in a short period like that month, some are much more long range, but we'd like to show some quick progress for you AND have some longer term plans in this area as well, so all suggestions will be considered.<br />
<br />

The higher experience for kills while defending a base was my idea BTW :)  The guild ownership of bases could be really interesting.   Darkenbane presently is way underpowered for such things, but hopefully this will change as we get more guys involved.  Anyhow, the link to the post is <b><i><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/planetside/Forum8/HTML/003553.html">here.</b></i></a></td></tr>
