I am sure many folks have not put up their kill pics yet, but we are monitoring the kills section to see how it goes!<br>
<br>
I also noticed ALOT of killpics up this month that DID NOT have the time and date stamp onthe kill.  This is UNSATSFACTORY if these kills are supposed to count for the contest.  The REASON for the time/date requirement was to prevent PREVIOUS kills from counting just because they were uploaded this month.<br>
<br>
You guys are also not guildstating worth a crap.  If they are an officer and u do not have them guildstated, you will lose the extra point.  YOU CAN cut and paste the guildstat...and EVEN cut and past the time/date stamp, but try not to make a habit of it.   YOU MUST HAVE THE TIME/DATE stamp and GUILDSTAT if u want credit.<br>

<br>
+2 Points Nelphim Guild (Leader Exploiting)<br>
+1 Point  Taskman (exploiting)<br>
+1 Point  Bolte (exploiting)<br>
<br>
Check this out.  Ekimus get's bank killed by Taskman (AKA Rigamortis the leader of Nelphim) and help.  I ask him wtf is up with the bank shit?  Wondering what example he is settign as a guild leader and all.  He says he is paying us back for when I bank killed his member Treeplug.  So I ponder this for a minute trying to figure out how Treeplug, a Woof Elf, was at Neriak bank (the only bank I am not KOS at).<br>
<br>
Ummmm  you Taskman, when yer gonna come up with some fable to justify yer pathetic cheating at the bank....at least try to come up with a story that COULD even happen.<br>
<br>
Check this out...20 mins later I have to port Ekimus to Nek so he can corpse recover...guess who is landing spells on me before i even materialize in the zone?  Yup, ole' "i can't seem to kill anyone unless I am cheatin'" Taskman.  COurse him and about 4 others (The Begotten up there too) maybe rubbed about 10 hps off me before I gated.  Pathetic.  <br>
<br>
Anyhow, lemee see some Nelphim bank kills bros.  The points count there for THEM only.  Don't geyt caught though...The GM's do NOT give a shit that we are doin it as retribution for their leader's actions.  ENjoy.<br><br></td></tr>

Several recent applicants have indeed been significant foes to the guild and, in the interest of the goals of the guild, it is time to forgive them their past feeble attempts at staying the might of Darkenbane and allow them to now strengthen us.<br>
<br>
With that in mind, I ask all membersto please go to the recruits board and discuss this under some applications that are up there now.  We additionally open our arms to those who have found it fruitless to continue and resist us.  You will not find scorn among us for realizing the task of opposing us is to great.   You will only find open arms and a new family that is VERY strong and will become only stronger by your presence.<br><br></td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="#7A7AA5"><td><b>The Point system get's a revamp!</b></td><td align="right"><b>29-01-2001</b></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="1">Submitted by <a href="mailto:grayrage@darkenbane.com">Grayrage</a> on 29-01-2001 16:20</font><p>Obviously there was some problems with the points system in Fear this weekend.  3 big ones need to be addressed and HAVE been fixed:<br>
<br>
1. Bidding on an item is NO longer possible AFTER everyone decides to random for it.  Thus seeing if u win by random THEN bidding when u lose is no longer a valid way to get an item.<br>
<br>
2. Bidding was to time consuming and seemed unfair.  We have fixed this and I will describe the change below.<br>
<br>
3. The system is unfair to the more common classes as they must use points to obtain gernal class specific itmes while rare classes can save their points for God drop items, because they will never have to use points to obtain class specific drops.<br>
<br>
Ok bros.  Every event we learn something new and make it better for the next event.  The point system will evolve and hopefully be the fairest way to reward those who put in more effort than those who attend one event for 2 hours.  WE must reward the people who HELP the guild the most or people will not have incentive to come.  Randoming everything is simply not fair for the following reasons:<br>
<br>
Example:  Ebula has been to all 4 events (and she has).  He has stayed through the entire event as well and has been enormous help to the guild.  He is a Shaman and has also received NO loot through ALL four events.  Let's say we do Hate Wednesday night and a new Shaman to the guild comes on the run.  This time we kill something that drops shammy stuff and the new guy wins the ROLL!  Ebula will have gone on FIVE events and STILL gotten nothing while the new guy gets an item on his first event and then quits the next day.<br>
<br>
THIS MUST NOT HAPPEN.  That is what the point system is for.  Ok let me tell u the changes to the points system and then use the example above under the new points system.<br>
<br>
1.  The points will accumulate the same way as described in a previous News post (and as will be posted in the Events folder).<br>
<br>
2.  People will NO LONGER bid for items.   IF no one is willing to use points for an item (let's say a blue diamond), the item will be randomed.  IF the item is a class specific item there WILL be a COST for the ITEM.  Class specific items will cost 15 points!  That is a SET price.  That means our ONLY monk will HAVE to pay 15 points for his class specific armor even THOUGH he does not have competiton for it.  The reason for this is so he does not accumalate a zillion points and get all the god drop items simply because he does not have to use points to get items.  On CLASS specific items the PLAYER with the MOST accumulated points GETs the ITEM!  Once he gets it, he will lose 15 points and that will most likely drop him below whoever had the second most points so that HE gets the NEXT item.  UBER items will COST 20 POINTS!   Quest specific items will cost 10 points.  Also players can USE their points to have the GROUP obtain quest items for them.  For example:  Rumproaster needs us to go do part of the cleric quest for him.  Let's say he has 30 points.  He can pay 10 points and the planar group will organize a mini-event to obtain the quest item.  He will get his item and be reduced down to 20 points.  The people who went onthe mini-event will be rewarded in points for attending the event.<br>
<br>
Under these changes, let's look at the Ebula example above.  Ebula has at least 40 points (prolly 45) for all of his event attendance and for not getting any gear yet.  The new shammy has ZERO cause he has never come before.  A shammy breastplate drops and Ebula is awared the item (dropping his total to 30).  A second shammy arms drops, but this time Einnod has 35 points and wins it. He get's the item and it drops his points to 20.  <br>
<br>
You can see that the new guy prolly will not get a shammy drop with those two old timers there, but after he has put in an event or two under his belt, he to will begin to obtain items.  This will reward loyalty and time invested while weeding out the moochers who just come up for one raid then scram cause' the heat is to much for them in our heavily PvP guild.<br>
<br>
As always, we willbe open to suggestions and will change things to make them as fair as possible.  I do NOT wish to discourage new guys from joining the planar group.  Many times people with lots of points will NOT go onthe trips and it will leave the item drops open for younger folks.  But at the least you can count on your loyalty to the planar group paying off and being reciprocated in the end!<br><br></td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="#7A7AA5"><td><b>The Plane of Fear.  We killed it...beatch!</b></td><td align="right"><b>29-01-2001</b></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="1">Submitted by <a href="mailto:grayrage@darkenbane.com">Grayrage</a> on 29-01-2001 01:57</font><p>OK.  The plan was a Hate run cause we are getting good at doin Hate and we were hoping the FAKE Innoruuk was up so we could prove she was not the real god.   Anyhow, it turns out Hate was camped to the hilt (Blood of Kings, Destroyers of the Faith, Unholy Inquistion and some others) and we had to decide whether to go up anyhow and do some killin' or find something else to do.<br>
<br>
Figuring those fellas in Hate prolly had their hands full enough with Innoruuk's minions, we decided to take a little journey to the Feerot where the portal to CaZic Thule's domain exists.<br>
<br>
So we pop in with 6 freagin' full groups of murdering scum.  All ready for battle, the armor creaked and the magic crackled, but it was ODDLY quiet when everyone popped through.  Shrugging it off, we figured it was exploring time and soon enough found Cazic's critters cringing in fear form the miight and power invading their domain!!  Sure they tried to fight, but in the end they fell and Darkenbane walked the Plane of Fear like the triumphant conquerers they are.<br>
<br>
OOC:  In a rather long day, we started nice and lucky with the portal being clear (thanx to the folks from the previous night one must assume).  Basically it was just a matter of pullin' and killin'.  We decided to let the portal stay agro (after the pop) to greet those fellas who invevitably would come to train us and such.  <br>
<br>
After clearing one area we moved through the middle and cleared our way to the opposite end of the zone.  We had two blow outs when some pets agroed the temple and pulled about 10 critters outa there which really hurt.   The second blow out came when we were traopsing across the zone like dingbats and agroed a mess of crap we did not know was there.<br>
<br>
The down time on corpse recovery was not to bad and we did alot of killin'.  Loot included a Drood BP Axxeron won by bid, Drood pants Meter won (he needed pants anyhow cause current ones had a hole in them).  Some monk booties, Rogue piercing weapons, Warrior whip thingy, Cryo neck and feet along with some other miscellaneous goodies.<br>
<br>
The PvE was a pretty damn good success with a little luck mixed in.  The PvP was rather pathetic as the server learned of our presence in the plane.  Knowing the mentality of most people, we left the port nice and inhabited for guests.  After getting about 100 threats, some Fusion, EP and a few toher guilds (i can't recall who they were and do not really care) corpsed themsleves OUTSIDE of fear so they could come in NAKED.  There is little wonder what the plan was when dipshits like that are doin silly crap like that.  /Shrug. Most never even made it to us and the ones that did were killed rather easily.  A few FD ones tried to inch their way over to us (to FD train of course) but a nice little dot always messes up FD :).<br>
<br>
I suppose the low point was when exploiter type realized that none of us were 56th level (thus being able to hit him at 60th).  This fellow was in East Power (imagine that...someone in East Power training) and just trained the hell outa of us.  It was pathetic.  He also annulled our mobs of roots and mezzes.  Broke just about any rule that existed...luckily just long enough for a GM to spot him.  /cheer.   <br>
<br>
People are so lame.  EP's motto should be:  "If you can't beat em', cheat like a little bitch."  Hey.....there sure was no good PvP goin on, why not one guy who is OOR to just train shit?<br>
<br>
In any case, the Superbowl was starting and our number had dwindled from 30+ to about 16 at the end.  Folks were getting weary and it was time to bug on outa dodge.  Was a helluva day and some good team work by a hard workin' crew.  /salute<br>
<br>
The point system will be updated by Monday bros.  It will reflect accurate point totals including subtraction for those who bid on stuff (Axxeron and Meter).<br><br></td></tr>

Whatever the case may be, I just spent forever sorting through email lists and have created a VERY good list of all confirmed Dark PAct members.  i EMAILED that list just NOW so if you DID get the email, you are good to go.  If you DID NOT get my email then you NEED to send me an EMAIL immediately to be added!!!<br>

ALOT of guys are not on the list!!  Enlucent and 90% of the Ordens comes to mind!!  Please EMAIL me if u did not get today's EMAIL!!!!!   I promise I will add u.<br>

If you are BELOW 46th level you are NOT in the Dark PAct.  So do not worry if u did not get an email if you are LOWER than 46th level but in DB.  You will STILL get DB emails, but just NOT Dark PAct emails (at least until u ding to 46).<br>

It is VERY important that Dark Pact members recieve their emails!  We are doing MULTIPLE events per week and u will NOT be informed of them if u are NOT on the list!!  PLEASE EMAIL ME!!!  (have I said this enough yet?  /sigh)  hehe.<br><br></td></tr>
