Saradin and Inkara have proven their ruthlessness and desire to see the success of the Neutral Team through their devastating and viscous attacks on the foe.  They have no mercy in their hearts and expect none in return.  Their addition to the Pact will strengthen us.<br>
<br>
Saradin, as a guild leader of the pact, will have admin on the secure forum as well as voting rights for it's course.  All members of Inkara (GF and TDC as well) need to contact their guild leader to have permission granted for access to the board.<br>
<br>
Note to guild leaders:  The admin panel for the boards is <a href="http://www.darkenbane.com/forum/admin/"target="_blank">Here</a>.  Please select "set private board permissions" and then "Gray Pact Board" from the drop down menu.  Then highlight each person's name from the left menu you wish to add (hold down the control key to select multiple people).  Then push add and they will be added on the right.  You will then have to give each user permission to actually post and you will see a button near their name that says "grant or remove posting rights".<br>
<br>
If you have ANY questions regarding the admin of the board please let me know, but it is important that we all attend this board to plan raids, organize defense, determine looting and the general course of the Pact.<br><br></td></tr>

** Crashing Bug Fixes **<br>
<br>
- Fixed the problem that was causing zones to crash in some instances.<br>
- Corrected a bug that would cause some people to hang up while waiting for a sound event between the splash and character-select screens.<br>
<br>
<br>
** Item Change **<br>
<br>
- The Green Flower should be working again.<br>
<br>
<br>
** Spell Change **<br>
<br>
- Fixed a stacking bug that allowed multiple Levitation buffs to stack.<br>
<br>
<br>
** Sullon Zek Changes **<br>
<br>
-  The Resist code changes we made with the last patch should be working properly now.  Here is the text about that change:<br>
<br>
"Changed the way resists are calculated when a Player Character casts a spell on another Player Character on Sullon Zek.  Resist modifiers based on level will now be more smoothly distributed and will allow lower level characters a slightly better chance to land spells on higher level characters.  At the same time giving lower level characters a slightly better chance to resist spells cast on them by higher level characters."<br>
<br>
- Cancel Magic spells should now work across teams.<br>
- Characters should no longer disappear when Mesmerized or stunned.<br>

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="1">Submitted by <a href="mailto:grayrage@darkenbane.com">Grayrage</a> on 17-08-2001 14:02</font><p>Per previous discussions, guilds Gladius Fatalis, The Dark Coalition and Darkenbane Company have formed the beginning of the "Gray Pact".  This is a multi-guild event group that will do Planes Raids, Dragon Raids, Epic Events and PvP Events together.<br>

The leaders of the Raid group are Grunter (DB), Vega (GF) and Bohn (TDC).  All three are moderator's for the new secured forum created for this raid group (linked to your left).  After creating your user account on the message board forums, please contact your guild leader so that they can give you user level access to the board.<br>

<tr bgcolor="#7A7AA5"><td><b>Conclusion to the Zanshin situation</b></td><td align="right"><b>17-08-2001</b></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="1">Submitted by <a href="mailto:grayrage@darkenbane.com">Grayrage</a> on 17-08-2001 11:54</font><p>We have looked over all of the "evidence" regarding guild Zanshin's association with the Foe and come to the following conclusions:<br>
<br>
- Shame does, in fact, have friends on the evil team and not only talks to them in tells, but has been seen 'hanging out' with them (even when they might make sport of some helpless newby teamates).  In his defense, he advises that EQ IS just a game and, although he is friends with (and respects) some of the foe, he will fight them (and then maybe have a chat afterwards).<br>
<br>
- Guild Zanshin has been known to and has admitted to negotiating with the foe when the odds do not seem to be in their favor.  When doing PvE or when outleveled this guild's leadership has admitted to and been seen to 'work out deals' of non agression with the enemy.  Examples are when Firble a 50th Necro was allowed to get his Student's Homework on the same level in TOFS as a group of Zanshin because "he was red".<br>
<br>
- It was determined that Guild Zanshin are not activily traitors, but instead have a leadership with cowardly ideals.  They will fight, but it seems only when they have the advantage or when THEY are out looking for a fight.  When trying to do PvE or when outnumbered and/or outleveled they will very possibly back out of a fight if negotiation will allow it.  We also believe the "friendships" of the guild leader may have leaked out info to the foe in the past and that he should not be trusted with sensative information.<br>
<br>
Darkenbane leadership has determined that guild Zanshin's attitude is detrimental to the success of the Neutral Team.  We believe including them in on events will possibly yield difficulties with the foe being aware of our activities and must be concerned with whether they will stand and fight when necessary.  As such, Darkenbane will not engage in any events where guild Zanshin members are present and will not group/assist their members.  We do not wish this type of organization to grow as it will ultimately lead to the downfall of the Neutral Team.  A weak guild is a weak link in our armor.  We MUST not allow it to continue.<br><br></td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="1">Submitted by <a href="mailto:grayrage@darkenbane.com">Grayrage</a> on 15-08-2001 16:01</font><p>** Sullon Zek Changes **<br>
<br>
- Changed the way resists are calculated when a Player Character casts a spell on another Player Character on Sullon Zek. Resist modifiers based on level will now be more smoothly distributed and will allow lower level characters a slightly better chance to land spells on higher level characters. At the same time giving lower level characters a slightly better chance to resist spells cast on them by higher level characters.<br>
<br>
- Characters below 6th level cannot be pick pocketed in any zone.<br>
<br>
- Guards have a better chance of aggro'ing a rogue that fails at picking pockets near guards.<br>
<br>
The change in the resistance tables is to close the power discrepency based on level some.  Previously a level 35 with 150 MR would be rooted 100% of the time by ANY 50+ which was an extraodinary inbalance in PvP.  Now, hopefully, resists for a level 35 will be calcualted the same as for a level 55 and thus make PvP engagements more balanced regardless of the levels involved.<br>
<br>
This hardly takes away the power of higher levels as they have enormous HP advanatges as well as skill and spell advanatges.   A level 35 wizzie is still not gonna get close to outnuking a level 51 wizzie, but at least now 2 or 3 level 35 wizzies have a shot at taking him down.<br>
<br>
This writer's opinion of the change? Full on wood.<br><br></td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="1">Submitted by <a href="mailto:grayrage@darkenbane.com">Grayrage</a> on 15-08-2001 14:31</font><p>As the trial of Shame and Zanshin continues on our forums and more evidence reveals some things many people in that guild did not know, we see many members fo Zanshin leaving.<br>
<br>
Darkenbane has seen applications from some of these folks and have no problem with processing their application in a similar manner as we process ANY application, but I wish to warn those applicants of some fundamental differences in our guilds.<br>
<br>
Darkenbane does NOT negotiate with the foe.  We will GIVE no quarter and expect none in return.  Making a corpse rot is considered a GRAND SLAM for DB.   We give out punishment to those that oppose us and expect it in return.  The foe attacks us in the hopes of causing exp loss, why should we show them mercy?  We believe that to deter further attacks it is necessary to make any attacks agasint us as painful as possible.<br>
<br>
Zanshin onbiously has/had alot of other ideas about how to fight this war.  They seem to change their mind frequently so I don;t know what to make of them, but they surely are not firm in their beliefs.<br>
<br>
Bottom line:  Don't join DB unless you are ready for some blood.  We don't want people like this in DB:<br>
