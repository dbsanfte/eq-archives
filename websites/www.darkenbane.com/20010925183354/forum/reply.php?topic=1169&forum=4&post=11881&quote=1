Well, I don't really know what to say...because most of the time when people believe something, they will do anything and everything to uphold that belief. You find yourself hating Shame, well, I doubt you will shake that belief ever. You people are (the anti-Shame ones) are doing a great job of reinforcing your own suspicions, and not stopping to look at the fact that NOTHING in this thread is even close to hard evidence. Not even close.

"Well here we have shame sitting all alone at a corpse where about 8 ruin will be momentarely but that doesn't bother him..."

No DB would ever see a corpse from a recent battle out in the middle of nowhere and be curious in the slightest. If you saw a DB member sitting by that corpse would you assume he was going to pull it? I doubt that. Would you run off? No, you'd probably want to camp that corpse, and bring in reinforcements. Running off doesn't accomplish that.

"Oh and here is when I ran by Shame sitting near orc fort and the 54+ necro just walks by him and kills me woot note Shame on target:"

Don't know what to say on this one...I don't see Shame in the pic.

"Oh and here's a dandy why what's this? Ahhh yes 2 ruin running by Shame hanging at zone and proceed to attack Belmonto a green Darkenbane instead! Obviously Shame told them there was some greens to kill eh?"

Looks to me like he's running somewhere. Either that or it's the insidious "run-while-sitting" bug that has everyone so worried.

"Oh well but Shame camped those ES Vamps right?"

Shame is known as the highest lvl neut druid on the server. Evils have no druids. They'd want to sell off their druid equip...and Shame is an obvious customer. Who's to say he can't buy an item that he would probably not be able to get normally? Regardless who it's from...ES arms are a good item and what druid wouldn't jump at the chance to get them.

"And Zanshin didn't train Db at the orc fort exactly 2 minutes before Ruin attacked right?"

I doubt this is what you make it out to be.

"but I did not see Shame fighting Ruin when everyone else was."

Whether or not you did or did not see him fighting, the choice is his whether or not he fights. And I saw him put up a hell of a battle with 5 guildmates, against the 10 or so evils at the kith/RV zone, when they didn't even stand a chance. Yet they fought. Ask TDC.

"Shame made an annoucement on his website. In that annoucement he claimed (among other things) that his guild will not corpse camp and will act honorbly."

Check again who posted that, and you'll see a name at the end of the post that does not resemble "Shame".

"Blastcaster was asking Skee WHY he had killed him"

So? You would never do something like...oh I dunno...type /congratulate after a deep red wiz kills you in almost one nuke...such things are somewhat comical.


Guys, I'm not trying to convince you that Shame is the Messiah. I'm just trying to show you that Shame is not the completely bad, evil-ally that you make him out to be. Your entire viewpoint is so skewed by the fact that "Oh Shame is allied with Ruin" you think that every time you see him he's doing something that makes him bad. Put anyone under the microscope, so to speak, as you are doing with Shame. I can come up with a nearly identical thread accusing nearly any neut on the server of the exact same thing you accuse Shame of.

Sometimes Shame fights with evils, sometimes he buys items not normally available to him from them. Just because he is neut doesn't mean he has to bend over backwards at every opportunity just to please every other neut. Give it a rest. Shame isn't the malevolent bastard you make him out to be. He's a good guy, a good player, and DOES help out other neutrals.
