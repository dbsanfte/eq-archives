I am not sure what is goin' on in Shadowbane, but it looks like the guys are goin' good on Scorn.  Somehow it looks like they are back being allied with TB (which, imho, is not a bad thing) and are having a good time.  I truly do not pay attention to the game's progress beyond seeing some screen shots which shows they are still enjoying the game.<br />
For more info check out their boards!<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Our planetside crew is going real strong now with at LEAST a full squad (10 DBers) on each night.  We have several squad leaders now and always have all DB squads going regardless of the size.  Some changes Sony is making in the near future involve the addition of platoons (where multiple squads are linked by a commander) and outfit captures of bases (which puts your guild's name on bases we capture).   We are looking forward to this, but need to add more folks to successfully take and hold a DB base :)<br />
<br />
Here is a recent quote taken from a PR guy at Sony about some upcoming changes to PS (click <i><b><a href="http://forums.darkenbane.com/showthread.php?s=&threadid=3266">HERE</a></i></b> to discuss on our forums):<br />
<br />
<i><b>"As promised, here is a general breakdown on the Lattice Logic Module as it is currently being planned. Certain variables in the design have not yet been nailed down, but I wanted to get you all a basic understanding and give you the opportunity to ask questions on it. <br />
When an Empire hacks a base, the Lattice Logic Module will spawn in a random location somewhere in the base and players will be notified of its approximate location. A player will then need to locate and pick up the Module by running over it. There are certain restrictions, including the fact that MAX units may not pick it, and Infiltrators may pickup up, but cannot cloak while carrying it. <br />
<br />
Next, the player must deliver the module to a friendly base that is one Lattice link away. If there is more than one linked friendly base, the delivery base will be chosen at random. The player carrying the Module will begin to glow, advertising that they are carrying the Module, and will be marked by a pulsating icon on the proximity map. That player is then unable to drive any vehicles or board any air vehicles. They may be a passenger or gunner in any land vehicle. Land vehicles carrying a player with the Module will have their speed restricted somewhat and be unable to board a Galaxy. <br />
<br />
The module has a lifespan in which it must be delivered. If it is not delivered to its destination within that lifespan, it will decay and the hack on the enemy base will fail. The Module itself can be dropped, but not destroyed in the player’s inventory. Its properties will not allow it to be stored in vehicle trunks or in lockers and it will despawn if it is dropped in lava or deep water. If the carrier dies, the Module will remain active and drop near their corpse. <br />
<br />
The defending Empire cannot retrieve a dropped Module that is still active. Instead, they must guard its location until the Module’s lifespan runs out. The effective defense pursuing a moving Module will want to identify and set up forces at any chokepoints that may exist or organize ambushes on the Module carrier. The effective offense will set up a convoy to escort the Module carrier to their destination and send out advance forces to deal with roadblocks set up by the defenders."</b></i><br />
<br />
The way it is set up now, most fights take place at bases and are somewhat repetative.  We are hoping this new system of capturing bases will force fights into the countryside where bridges, high ground, forests and cover will become far more prominant.  Should be neat.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Blizzard has released the information on the lands of the Nightelves!  The link to the site to review the entire addition is <i><b><a href="http://www.blizzard.com/wow/townhall/kalidar.shtml">HERE.</a></i></b> I have taken the liberty of tossing a few screw caps up for your perusal.  Also, I am looking forward to seeing the implentation of the Blood Elves (this has not been announced...it is just an assumption on my part to add another evil race).  I will keep an eye out!<br />
