Book of Darkness</font></p>
<ul>
	<li><p align="left">According to those who sit in
		power, we come into this world as a character
		in a play, fulfilling our role. Many futilely
		believe that they shape their world, yet few
		are willing to admit that the forces that be
		are what shapes their puny lives. Those who
		dare to know their fate, and to pursue it,
		are the ones who find true power and glory in
		this universe-be it for good or for evil-neither
		being clearly understood. In this age have
		risen many mighty amongst the dark forces of
		this world. Some are reincarnations from ages
		past, dating as far back as the world of
		Toril. We are children of darkness and seeds
		of malevolence who have hatched at the point
		in time and space that has been appointed to
		us. For it is our destiny to bring about the
		end of the ages.</p>
		<p align="left">Many ignorant fools, lacking
		wisdom, ask what these foreboding prophecies
		mean, and we the Darkenbane will declare that
		we have come to bring darkness into your
		world, to smother the light therein, and to
		poison it with a vile poison that consumes
		both the mind and body of our victims. We are
		a Company...a group closely, even exclusively,
		associated for criminally destructive
		engagements as willed by our Father, Innoruuk.
		We are outlaws made immortal by the glory
		your worship bestows upon us, furthermore, we
		have been made immortal because the gods have
		deemed us worthy to bring about the
		desolation of all life which they have come
		to regret making.</p>
		<p align="left">Many in our world are deluded
		in their imaginings which translates to their
		actions. We recognize the other guilds as
		frauds-claiming to a form of godliness and
		declaring themselves the incarnations of
		murder, evil, power, and glory, yet they
		cannot even begin to understand the darkness
		that will soon consume their souls. This
		darkness, Darkenbane, is the bane of all
		those who claim to be living, undying, and
		even god-like. For regardless of their
		insanity, ours is the greater, for we are
		consumed by this plague of malevolence-prepared
		to destroy this world and all worlds to come
		until all come to see that it was our mastery
		of the art that led to all their demise. They
		will indeed ridicule what they are both
		jealous and afraid of. And what possesses our
		malignant hearts? That which it has been
		ordained for us to speak: we are the children
		of wrath, chosen by the gods to bring about
		an end to all ages. Our work will continue
		after this world is gone, for other worlds
		soon await their destruction. Let them deny
		the truth, yet we shall grow stronger with
		each passing day as our enemies dwindle into
		the places of non-existence they already hold
		in our minds. </p>
		<p align="left">We are the only true outlaws
		of this world, for we truly take what we want
		and do whatsoever we desire. We are a law
		unto ourselves, having ignored the mandates
		from above and below (save the law of our
		destiny-a choice given to each of us), for we
		are the end of the law, and where law ends
		destruction begins. We are, therefore, set up
		against every tradition and all mankind. The
		gods who destined our fate have grown tired
		of those who claim titles of god-hood, of
		those who meekly worship them, and of their
		failed creations in general! Therefore, we
		have been appointed this season of the
		universe for its destruction; and after which,
		we ourselves shall be consumed by the
		darkness, which for the time being, cannot be
		extinguished in our undying hearts. We shall
		be raised back to life again, so that all
		will know that we come not as a savior, but
		as the harbingers of your deaths. The
		darkness shall consume this land, and the
		poison shall strike with a lingering that
		shall torment you for eternity, so that all
		shall know we came to bring the pain. </p>
		<p align="left">The most incompetent amongst
		you will even ask how light-dwelilng races
		can bring such evil into your midst. So we
		say unto you orang-utans: evil is not a
		measure of skin color, for all blood sheds
		red, rather evil is staring you in the face,
		for through the doorway to our soul's you
		shall see where the evil lies-in our hearts-if
		you can truly say we still have such a thing.
		And it is these corrupted hearts, which have
		forsaken every god, that are also bound by
		the gods as instruments of your end and ours.
		So it begins&#133;so it ends.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p align="left">&quot;In this life we live as
		thugs&#133;&quot; </p>
		<p align="left">The Organization known as
		Darkenbane is united by the mutual Pact
		written in our hearts; much how our names are
		written as the final words in the books of
		history. Therefore, we recognize all these
		truths to be self-evident to all members of
		Darkenbane:<br>
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><p align="left">All who do not swear fealty
		to the Messenger of Darkness (Innoruuk's Tool)
		will and MUST be slain. None can live! Your
		neighbor MUST die and his children ENSLAVED
		as the will of the Darkness engulfs the World!
		NONE will be spared! The Prey must be preyed
		upon!<br>
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><p align="left">None of the Soldiers of
		Darkness will bow to anything above or below,
		for you are creatures of only ONE law and are
		bringers of Doom and destruction as commanded
		by your God and father, Innoruuk! Never will
		a Darkenbane Trooper ask for Quarter and NONE
		will ever be given!<br>
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><p align="left">All Soldiers will receive the
		mandates of your leader with respect and
		honor and likewise, you shall respect and
		honor all members of Darkenbane.<br>
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><p align="left">You will always put the
		members of Darkenbane before all other
		creatures no matter how sinister and
		enjoyable their company.<br>
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>No member of the Company will assualt another
		in the Company for any reason beyond training.
		<br>
		</li>
	<li>You shall always strive to obtain the most
		power possible in each world to better
		accomplish the task set before us, especially
		plane-faring magics. <br>
		</li>
	<li>Any who fail to obey these Commandments will
		be cast out and sent among the prey. <br>
		</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">3.
Darkenbane Hierarchy</font></p>
<ul>
	<li><p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Prophet</font>
		- This Mortal is Innoruuk's link to the
		Norrathian World. His authority comes from
		the revelations given to him by Innoruuk
		himself as the Father gives instructions
		meant to be followed by his Mortal Minions.
		Graraige D'Bane is the Prophet sent by
		Innoruuk to lead us to Glory and Power! His
		words are a reflection of our Father's wishes
		and though he is not the actual leader of DB,
		his guidance is always present to maintain
		the structure and integrity of Innoruuk's
		Tool.<br>
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Lord
		Captain</font> - This Mortal is selected by
		Innoruuk to Lead his Minions into battle. He
		is the Leader of the guild and considered the
		'Guild MAster'. He will make all decision
		regarding war, recruitng, disputes, strategy
		and the course of the guild within the
		guidlines set by Innoruuk through the Prophet.
		His word is law...his anger is death, he is
		Innoruuk's weapon in Norrath!<br>
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Lords
		of Darkenbane</font> - These are the personal
		advisors of the Lord Captain. Together they
		decide on important decisions and any
		commandment issued through them from the
		Captain is law. They act as leaders in his
		stead, upholding the Pact and guiding the
		actions of Innoruuk's tools. <br>
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Dread
		Knights</font> - As Soldiers of the Company,
		most members of Darkenbane are Dread Knights.
		The Dread Knights function is to execute the
		destruction of all life on whatever world
		they occupy and to heed the words of their
		beloved Captain whom they have put their
		loyalty in. Dread Knights are not below
		anybody for all members of Darkenbane honor
		and respect each other as equals in the
		greater cause. They recognize the Prophet as
		being inspired and the voice of Innoruuk,
		their Father and therefore heed his word so
		long as it coincides with the pact of
		darkness they have together formed. <br>
		</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">4. OOC Policy</font></p>
<ul>
	<li>There are three basic rules in DB as follows:<br>
		<br>
		1. Never attack another DBer unless in
		training or play.<br>
		2. Never whine, beg, grovel, ask for quarter
		or otherwise act in such a manner as would
		embarrass your Brothers.<br>
		3. Never get caught violating any Verant/Sony
		policy or rules.<br>
		</li>
	<li>The goal of Darkenbane is to kill ANY non
		DBers for their loot and the glory of the
		kill. There are NO guidlines for HOW you kill
		others or WHO you kill as long as the victim
		is NOT another DBer.<br>
		</li>
	<li>It should be understood by any recruits that
		DB plays the HARDEST possible role in
		Everquest as the most hated and scorned.
		DBers are hunted and despised. As such, a
		recruit MUST be prepared to escape when
		unprepared for battle. He must be prepared to
		be attacked CONSTANTLY as 98% of the
		population WILL attempt to kill you! The
		reward for playing this role is being among
		the best PvPers in the game. Who else would
		take on the entire populaation of Norrath and
		THRIVE?<br>
		</li>
	<li>The mentality of a DBer should be one of
		expecting attack. A DBer should EAGERLY
		anticipate battle and NEVER fear his opponant(s).
		He is ALSO responsible for staying ALIVE. A
		DBers death reflects poorly on the rest of
		the guild. Do not feel the need to enter into
		combat against rediculous odds. Do not be
		goaded by those who are envious and jealous
		of your position!<br>
		</li>
	<li>A DBer should never be goaded into anger. A
		DBer is responsible for GOADING and ANGERING
		our foes, not the other way around. If no
		possibility for groveling (by the victims)
		exists, then ignore any victims as the sheep
		they are.<br>
		</li>
	<li>Being attacked and hated in Norrath is part
		of the JOB as a DBer. We play a role in
		Norrath as TRUE evil! We are the COMMON foe
		for the MAJORITY of the players and as such
		will face enormous odds quite often. As a
		DBer you must learn to COPE with these odds
		and be prepared for the unfairnous thereon.
		DO NOT bring the morale of the guild down by
		whining or complaining in guildsay that you
		were ganked by 6 people. It happens...and
		should be shrugged off as funny that it takes
		SO many to kill only ONE of us. Additionally,
		think of the fun our victims ultimately have
		by having such a ready group to hate. Don't
		get upset....we are supposed to be having FUN.
		SO kill the prey and enjoy their groveling! *grins*</li>
