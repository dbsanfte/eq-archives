<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="1">Submitted by <a href="mailto:grayrage@darkenbane.com">Grayrage</a> on 27-12-2001 07:16</font><p>.....greed.<br />
<br />
I recall when SOB, DB and TOW were mending fences and trying to do some events togther.  Things started looking good as we did some epic mobs, Kael and it looked bright for the Neutral team indeed.   <br />
<br />
But then, one day, we got word KD was up and 2 groups of TOW were gonna try to do him.  Their two groups consisted of one level 51st level  warrior as a tank who was just was not strong enough to get the job done. Instead of asking for help and having to share the loots, they went ahead and tried as hard as they could to do it.  We were insulted and it set us back a bit in relations as all they had to do was say they would share and KD would drop like a nail with everyone having some fun and the guilds being brought closer togther.  TOW died....we killed KD and everyone had a sour taste.<br />
<br />
Tonight, I found about 30 Ruin in Skyfire getting ready to do Talendor.  The first thing i did was holler for all available folks who wanted to attack to come to Skyfire for battle.  Unfortuntely, Ruin was rather fast at killing him so I was the only attacker.  Some Dbers came in late, but without Tal helping....it would not have been pretty.<br />
<br />
Little did i know, however, that 6 of our core DB had other plans which consumed their attention.  6 DB and 6 SOB found that KD was up and somehow decided not to annouce in guildsay that this coveted mob was available for a party.  How something as prized as a KD kill could be overlooked by these core members is still a mystery to us, but we can conjecture.<br />
<br />
Why invite the entire guild when they can do it with 12?  Why share the loot with others when we can split it among 12 of us?  Did these questions pass through their minds?  Did 6 CORE DBers actually decide to do a major mob without the rest of the guild so they would not be liable to split it?  I still cannot believe this, but no other facts are forthcoming.  Yes, some in the group are rather greedy, but SPLEEFA?  Adjonai?  In a million years I would never have thought to have seen this from you.  Can you imagine Lethdar asking me to bring a group to do KD, but not the rest of our guild?  Can u imagine what i would have said to him?  Of course, that's why no one told me.  <br />
<br />
My spirit was torn asunder when I learned that my very own officers had just done to their own guildmates, officers and fellow members, what TOW had done to us.  <br />
<br />
What precedent would this set for a guild?  To sneak off and do mobs without telling your guildmates?  It would destroy us of course...slowly and painfully.  I am ashamed.  Never would DB have done this 1 year ago....I have failed to lead the guild away from our true enemy and it has evolved into our demise.<br />
<br />
I have deleted the mighty Darkenbane as I could not bear to tear us asunder by removing those who had struck us so deeply with their actions.  Removing our core is like removing our hearts...even if the heart has gone black and dead from greed and selfishness.  Removing them from Darkenbane would have weakened us.  I would rather be dead than weak.<br />
<br />
As such, I say that Darkenbane...in Everquest is dead.  I will miss you all.<br><br></td></tr>
