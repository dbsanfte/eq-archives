Bradic has a shaded history when it comes to his younger childhood days. All that is really known of his origin is that he hails from the house of the Knights of Truth in Freeport near the Commons. Under the wing of Valeron Dushire, Bradic soon became very anxious to learn the ways of the Knight. As Bradic came of age he did indeed learn the noble ways of Knighthood and used his skills to defend the Commons from orcs, raiders, and even some of the dark elf attackers from Neriak. Valeron, very proud of Bradic sent him out one day on a mission to find himself and to make a name for himself as a Kinght of Truth throughout Norrath. 

That day Bradic left Freeport and ventured to High Hold Keep. Here he met a fellow Paladin named Ludjens who was also a Knight of Truth from Freeport. Ludjens told Bradic about his travels and of the guild where he hailed from and his lord in which he served. It was called Wild Hunt and they truely served a noble cause, one that Bradic wished to be a part of. Ludjens took Bradic under his watch and took him to see Dhabu the friendly Ogre. Dhabu would be Bradic's new lord in which he would serve like any other knight to the end. Bradic's services where so highly reguarded that Dhabu appointed him into a high position in his guild and together they forged it into a strong and formitable army full of brotherhood and good will, Tempered Fury. 

Bradic seemed to have made a name for himself after all but something was wrong after awhile. He had been at his lord's right hand throughout the building of thier strong force but he did not find satisfaction in this as much as he did in battle and destroying his enemies. Bradic began to see a dark entity in his visions, one he was not familiar with. There was also a man in these visions who seemed to call to be able to make Bradic very powerful. The more he saw this evil entity the less he saw the divine gods his very name stood for. Then one day Bradic met a very powerful group called Darkenbane, who where servants of Innorruk. They where led by a man named Graraige, the very man Bradic saw in his new visions. Bradic watched as they terrorized Norrath making sheep out of it's inhabitants. He was strangly attracted to them, and the vision of the dark entity became clear finally. Innorruk came to Bradic and he told him who he really was. The words he passed on to Bradic are not known but now Bradic wields his blade for Innorruk under his new lord Graraige. 

Bradic had become an Unholy Crusader. One of Innoruuk's only Knights.<br>
