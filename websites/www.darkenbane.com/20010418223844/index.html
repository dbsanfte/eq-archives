I have been rather busy lately as my wireless connection seems to be improving, thus allowing me to be in game more instead of out here telling you all about it ;p<br>
<br>
Ok here is a run down:<br>
<br>
Yesterday we fought Sabbat and CD (aren't they supposed to be fighting each other?) over that big turtle in Iceclad.  Those nasty stickers and slashers aren't quite as bad in the open /grin.<br>
<br>
In the early evening we killed folks in Dreadlands totaling at least 25 kills.  Talk about meat shop ;p   People stopped coming to DL so we flew over to S. Ro and thwacked the malingerers there.<br>
<br>
We exped for a while...maybe 2 hours after that a GM pops on the scene and advises that our guild received a few hundred petitions against it during the evening.  The GM further advised that he did not witness any trnasgressions by our guild and thus no warnings were issued. He did say that they would be watching us and if he did catch us doin bad stuff they would disband DB.<br>
<br>
Over a 4 or 5 hour period of slaughtering pathetic whining little weasel fucks, we had hundreds of petitions and not one turned out to be legitemate (i can't spell this stupid word) or warnable.  That's the way to spam the GMs yah silly sheep.<br>
<br>
This morning was fun too.  Paradigma, for some reason, got all brave and shit and attacked us.  They left with Volture, Trylun, Needra (Ole QUad plugged) and some other guildmates in bodybags without hardly touching any of us.  We got some goodies off them too including a BD earing, GEBs and some real nice SK item.  Thanx for the contributions!  Trylun and Volture (my god these guys can FLAP their mouths):  feel free to bring more of your guild for us to kill..saves us the trouble of hunting you down.<br>
<br>
PVE NOTE:  Grats to EInnod who got MALO, Malchasion who got some mage spell that summons a haste item, Axxeron who got Spirit of the Oak, Graraige (thats me) got Tears of Prexus and I got a diamond in Fear.  BAAAAAAAHAAAAAA!  Oh...and Eki got his Arch Lich.   Can't wait to see that bugger as a spectre.  Yeeeeehaw!<br>

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="1">Submitted by <a href="mailto:grayrage@darkenbane.com">Grayrage</a> on 11-04-2001 14:33</font><p>Thanks to Shiya and Coan who took the time to represent DB at the San Diego EQ Fanfare!  For the parts they can recall (they were pretty sloshed from what I hear ;p) Shiya made up a nice report:<br>
<br>
<p align="left"><font size=2><i><br>
I got to speak with PVP GM "Lady Daegarmo", and Rallos Zek, Lead GM<br>
"Ozuri", at great lengths, and these are some of the issues discussed:<br>
<br>
1. New "Zek" Server on the way.  Including possible Exp loss/gain upon<br>
PVP death. They seem to be gathering input still for this server.<br>
Movelog  not a probable option for RZ players.<br>
<br>
2. The number one change players suggested to see on RZ, seemed to be<br>
getting rid of attackable blue/red cons. Having only black/white colors<br>
as attackable.<br>
Blue/red cons to become OOR, for PVP.<br>
<br>
3. Egg shaped pumice exploit will be changed, in that, it will cost a<br>
GREAT deal more, to repurchase them!<br>
<br>
4. De-leveled characters will drop to +1 of maxed skills level, for<br>
actual current level. No more 300 HP backstabs at lev 20!!<br>
<br>
5. Name cleanup.  RZ is 1st server to start clearing the list of<br>
"questionable/offensive" names of characters.  If you have any level<br>
character with a "borderline" name, you should come up with a lengthy<br>
list of alternate names, then petition to have it changed. This will<br>
save<br>
GM time in selecting a usable name(while their Help List continues to<br>
stack),and increase your chances to have a decent name.  A 55 Rogue lost<br>
account for a racially offensive level 1 character name...lotta effort<br>
wasted for stupidity/rudness.<br>
<br>
6.NO NONSENSE POLICY.  Do NOT make derogatory remarks pertaining to:<br>
-Racial hate<br>
-Sexual Preference<br>
-Sexual Violence<br>
This is a good way to lose account without warning! This is Verant<br>
policy and it is not to be tested!<br>
<br>
7. Enchanters being at a recognized disadvantage, because of all the<br>
high Magic Resist gear, will get a probable increase in the power of<br>
Tashania line of spells, unless they can find another way to increase<br>
fairness to Enchanters, in regards to PVP.<br>
</i><br>
<br>
Note from Gray: OMG do they ever fight ANYONE that knows what they are doin? ;p  Enchanters OWN now!  Stupid chanters' are the only ones that get owned.<br>
<br>
<i>8. We have all seen the amount that rules vary from GM, to GM, when<br>
disputing a problem.  GM Ozuri said that they were trying very hard to<br>
get a standard of PVP rules for Rallos, to ensure fairness, and<br>
alleviate ill tempered discussions. The general idea I was left with, is<br>
that, after the PVP meeting in a couple weeks from now, that Rallos Zek<br>
with become a very dangerous place, more so than now! Meaning that<br>
Rallos players will be left to "Fend for themselves", with the<br>
exceptions of "Training opponents", and "Attacking opponents before<br>
Realized Zone Entrance".(movement/turning once into the new zone). We<br>
should have a "blessed" set of rules within next 3 weeks. Thanks to GM's<br>
Ozuri and GM Lady Daegarmo for all your extra efforts at the Fanfare and<br>
ingame!!<br>
<br>
  All in all, Verant put on a super event, with many interesting<br>
discussions and displays.<br>
As a member of Darkenbane, I was met with a spectrum of different<br>
feelings.  I got a lot of heat, but learned that most players know what<br>
to expect when they deal with DB...Not always the case with other<br>
guilds.  I received many "Kudos" on the tactics/stategies of "Grayraige<br>
Studmuffin" and the many players that comprise Darkenbane.<br>
 I got a tremendous amount of compliments on the Darkenbane website, and<br>
passed along appreciation, and "Thank You's", since our designer "Meter<br>
Methodical", could not be present.<br>
   Most of the players from Rallos were very nice to me, and I enjoyed<br>
talking with them. When I talked to the players from non-PVP servers,<br>
they seemed to all get very quiet, and just listen to the war stories of<br>
PVP battles. I honestly believe that most of the 1100, or so, players<br>
that showed up for the event, only wish they had the courage to go full<br>
PVP...I guess that's where you and I are a little different from the<br>
rest!!!  And thats why we deserve the heart pounding adrenaline rush,<br>
that only comes from PVP, on Rallos Zek, in a guild called,<br>
"DARKENBANE"!!!<br>
                        Thx, Shiya<br>

Player reports are starting to tricke in regrading info developed in San Diego:<br>
<br>
<p align="left"><font size=2><i><br>
I was at the discussion with Gary Grobson (aka Lady Daegarmo) regarding PvP. A number of issues were discussed. Perhaps Shiya (whom I had a chance to meet there, and is a nice person IRL - it's hard to believe the transformation that takes place when Shiya enters Norrath) can elaborate on some on this:<br>
<br>
1. The new server will be up in about a month.<br>
<br>
2. The specific rule set hasn't been decided upon - several variants of team PvP are options. Those include pure GvE, deity-based teams, and a three-team setup. I don't know what loot system is being considered.<br>
<br>
3. This affects primarily the race wars servers, but they're looking at not allowing beneficial buffs or heals to be cast on those not on your team. They may do it on one of the race wars servers and/or the new server.<br>
<br>
4. The deleveling issue was addressed. They're strongly considering making it so you temporarily lose the skill when you delevel, so that a level 40 who drops to level 11 will have level 11 (or perhaps 12) skills.<br>
<br>
5. Exploits such as corpse camping, portal camping, and zone line camping were addressed. A suggestion that Guides be in trouble spots 24/7 was quickly shot down. I doubt that anything will be done in this area.<br>
<br>
6. It's possible that newbie PK will be eliminated by making level 1-5 characters "blue". Once you hit level 6, you automatically go "red".<br>

Check out the unclaimed drops on Sunday:<br>

1. Rogue Vambraces.<br>
2. Rogue Bracer<br>
3. SK Bracer<br>
4. 3 (yes THREE) warrior boots<br>

7. Bard Gloves<br>
8. Warrior Gloves<br>

All day we were there.  Some really bad ass fights too.  One fight involved 4 Clerics of Innoruuk and 3 misc mobs.  We thought for sure it was blow out time, but somehow Rykker and Stoffer stayed alive and kept them all mezzed until we got to them.  At the end of the fight 3 outa of 4 of OUR clerics lay dead, but we ended up victorious.  All that work and here is what got into the hands of the Dbers:<br>
<br>
- Tash got cleric bracer.<br>
- Woggie got some nifty pali only mace with pretty good stats.<br>
- I got a blue diamond<br>
- Stofferr got a diamond<br>
- Eki got a jacinth<br>
- Rykker got a jancinth<br>
- Rump got a jancinth<br>
<br>
Bad loot day.  Good confidence day.  PKing is seeming like a walk in the park compared to the fun pathing in Hate!  Thanks to everyone who came and helped out!  Special thanks to the Dark Pact Members who made up 25% of the raid group (and 75% of the experience and success).<br><br></td></tr>

It seems any officers of the guild will be able to leave messages of the day for the guild so that whenever a guildmember logs on their screen will be spammed with the guild messages.  Let's save the Guild messages of the day for important stuff so it actually won't be ignored by everyone when they logon ;p<br>
<br>
I would like to say farewell (for now) to Rumproasta (the original)!  He has decided to take a break from EQ (he says forever...but we know how that goes hehe) and has contributed the services of Rump to the guild!  Wotonn will be taking up Rump's charge as Priest of Darkenbane!  Rump will always be welcome back in DB when he realizes EQ addiction can't be shaken that easily! (Actually he is graduating college and wants to have his head straight for his new job.  Go RUMP!)<br>
<br>
Hey!  What is there to do when the server are down all day?  Well how bout checking out some <a href="http://www.nep.nu/falcons/movies/harmy.swf"target="_blank">Ogre dancing lessons</a>....or better yet, <a href="http://server49.hypermart.net/voxton/flash/bell.html"target="_blank">REAL OGRE DANCING LESSONS!</a><br>
<br>
After Fear on Saturday we did Fear on Sunday too!  The usual stuff dropped.  Check your points and make sure they are correct!  I will be getting them set up today. Also grats to Frobin who got his Monk Pet off a Guardian Wurm last night!<br><br></td></tr>
