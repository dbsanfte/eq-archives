After that he pulled my corpse and windom ressed me. He might trade with evil, some evils might not 1 on 1 attack him (its not exactly easy to kill a 58 druid outside) and he might even be friends with some evils - shrug he was there and fought on the right side - like Bone says...I and my cousin...<BR>*nods to abbu - good fight*<BR><BR>MyshellaSiN aka Melissandre<BR></FONT><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" face="sans-serif">Hmm.<BR><BR>Today in Misty, Atha?  Atla? 50+ mage (I think 58? Not sure) of Ruin was ganking greenies in Misty and Rivervale.  When he decided to try and start pking in Rivervale, a bunch of people notified Shame (He asked for Atla's loc) of the mage's whereabouts.  Shame wanders over, looks at him, does nothing.<BR><BR>Then Atla zones back to Misty.  Shame zones, runs in almost the opposite direction of Atla. (Shame does have tracking right?!  Right?!)<BR><BR>Eventually, Atla sets up camp just out of the wall and summons a pet and decides to sit down and med.<BR><BR>There's something about knowing that you're going to hit someone for full damage, so I shoot an arrow into him, and then pull his pet to the guards.  In case you're wondering a 50+ pet > Misty guards..  At this point while the pet is engaged... a big mob of greenies attacks Atla, knocking him down to 1/5 of his life before he gates out.<BR><BR>What did Shame do the entire time?<BR><BR>Absolutely dick.<BR><BR>Just thought I'd share.<BR><BR>Sunshine<BR><BR><font size=-1>[ This Message was edited by: Sunshine on 2001-08-15 12:05 ]</font></FONT><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" face="sans-serif">Well I think Darwoth's post clears up how he got this reputation.  He admitted to having a non agression pact with Ruin.<BR><BR>Obviously Shame made some deals.  He is playing both sides.<BR><BR>Let me explain DB's point of view:<BR><BR>We don;t mind bantering with the foe.  We don;t mind being frinedly in tells or out of game, but when we see someone in attack range we will kill them without remorse and with no mercy.  The ONLY question might be whther someone might be just a manasink (below 20 and not worth the mana waste).   We will corp[se camp people not to be a "griefer" (a term created by retards) in an effort to make it VERY painful to attack us and thus make them think twice about doing it again. <BR><BR>So, if you come to vellious and die.  Bring your whole fucking guild to get your corpse back cause we are not gonna let yah have it if we can help it.  Or don;t fucking come to our land.<BR><BR>We expect the same in return.  If u nab one of us (and you will) we expect to be corpse camped and will either just log off and CR the next day or we will bring everyone to get it back.<BR><BR>It's very simple, kill or be killed.  No fucking negotiation.<BR><BR>2 night ago 2 Ruins and an IE came to attack us at the orc fort.  We were not ready (it was a surpriose attack) we were outleveled (50+ Cleric and Wizzie and 40+ Shammy), but we saw them inthe zone 2 mins before the attack and at least knew what to expect.  They were coming to kill us.  Mercy to them?>  I think not.  Shammy and cleric went down.  They took a risk and it did not pay off.  Now they are gonna need to spend some hours doin CR.  They brought 20 Ruin to do it and succeeded.  Thats how it is done.<BR><BR>Guess what though?   They got overconfident and 6 of them stayed after the other left.  We killed three.  Guess what time it is?   That's right....CR time.  And guess what?  it wasn;t easy  (they did it though and were very clever about it too).<BR><BR>Let me tell you this too, in 2 months we will all be 55+.  Its gonna get ALOT uglier when u die when u don;t have 20 levels on us.  ALOT uglier.  Come at your own risk, but one day we will make someone's corpse rot.  it's like a grand slam for us <IMG SRC="/forum/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><BR><BR>Anyhow, back tot he subject, SHAME.  I would like him to address this and help us in figuring out how to resolve it.  His comments to Darwoth, his member's comments to Axxy, his members ass kissing to Milt all add up to some serious probable cause that he has had some dealings with the foe and may still.<BR><BR>Through all of this we still have not heard from him.  Shame, feel free to explain all of this.

You won't change your mind. It's been pretty obvious. You tell Shame that his guild members are not dropping everything to help you, that makes him a traitor.<BR><BR>Open your damn eyes, man. You are only going to see what you expect. Expect the best, and you'll get it. Expect that Shame is a traitor, and your opinion is already so skewed that you cannot see anything else.<BR><BR><BR>Why doesn't Shame comment? My only thought is that he already has. But you weren't listening. The only thing you will listen to is if he says outright that he allies with evils. Anything else he says to you, you'll obviously discard as untrue.<BR><BR><BR>Read the post. thxu~</FONT><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" face="sans-serif">Oops...accidently submitted before I was done ) I bet Sunshine here didn't give Shame a tell to get to see what was up.<BR><BR>Lets look at what we got here. Accusations about Shame in alliance and not killing evils(Ruin to be exact). We also seem to have proof of Shame killing and being killed by Ruin. That is where this whole thing should end.<BR><BR>What happened to "Innocent until proven guilty"? It seems to be reversed in this situation, Shame is already guilty until proven innocent. Even with this backwards philosophy Shame seems to be winning. Almost every post against Shame has been replied to with one that clears things up. While I'm here I might as well clear up another one. Pumpkin said in her post they left because we told them not to kill goods so we could farm. We told them not to kill the good that zoned in to loot his corpse and that WE were not PKing them at the zone since we were going after loot in the castle and didn't want to get trained. We could have cared less if they wanted to stay at the zone to PK, more power to ya IMO.<BR><BR>And as far as training in EW goes, if anyone has hunted at the orc fort on any server you should know there will be trains coming through because you are right by a zone.I could go on and on with a defense for a lot of these ridiculous accusations, but I won't waste my time hoping most people have the common sense to realize themselves.<BR><BR>I do not post this to help our situation with DB, the ones that still hold this hatred can never have their minds changed. I could care less what they do if they want to judge Shame and Zanshin on rumors and no convincing evidence. I post to reach those outside of DB reading this whole discussion. Do not judge Zanshin on rumors and word of mouth. If you judge us on personal experience you will not be disappointed; give or take maybe a few bad experiences which no guild can avoid.<BR><BR>I would like to thank DB, I enjoyed reading all this. Whenever I want a good laugh I'll be sure to drop by and see whats new on this post.</FONT><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" face="sans-serif">LOL grayrage again it makes me laugh. Darwoth's post was messed up when i first went through but i just went back to read the conversation. The only thing Shame is guilty of there is not wanting to go kill a group of Ruin and get himself killed, its called smart playing. He never said in that conversation he was allied at all or did not PvP, just that he avoided Ruin.<BR><BR>Let me ask you a question Gray, have you seen any of the posts in his defense? There are quite a few of them and they prove that he does PvP against Ruin when they are in our zones. I just think people are angry that he doesn't bend over backwards helping newts 24 7. You cannot argue that he does not help out. I would like to hear what you still have against us after reading the posts to clear our name, because I think they do a pretty good job at it.<BR><BR>-Truble <Zanshin></FONT><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" face="sans-serif">Truble,<BR><BR>I am doing my best to look at this from both perspectives.   What i see is a guild that tries to avoid conflict with the foe.  <BR><BR>-Shame last night was reported to be hanging out with an evil who was slaughtering neutrals.<BR><BR>-Zanshin was reported in MM asking Neutral not to PK goodies cause they wanted to PvE there.<BR><BR>-Member of Zasnhin grovelled to Milt leader of Hat ein open chat and was not removed for his actions and words.<BR><BR>-Member of guild Zanshin who has now quit advised he knows there has been a treaty with Shame and some Evils.<BR><BR>-A member of guild Zanshin caused a train (this is not disputed) which took the darkenbane contingent out of the fight in EW right when Ruin ported into IC.<BR><BR>-About a week ago, we called for everyone in GD to prep for battle with guild Ruin.  A Zanshin member called out for us all to prepare our coffins and laughed at us (this does not seem appropriate and helpful when trying to organize a battle).<BR><BR>-Shame's direct comments to Darwoth are rather incriminating.<BR><BR>So, is it guild Zanshin's goal to only fight when they think they can win (and since Ruin is to high they won;t fioght them?)?  Or inthe instance of MM is it Zanshin's perspective to make a deal witht he locals so they can do MOBs ina zoen and get their gear instead fo killing the locals and taking what u want?<BR><BR>it seems pretty clear to me thus far that guild Zanshin (or it's leadership) has an issue with courage. I am simply giving the opportunity here to dispell that thought.<BR><BR>Soon, we will decide what willbe done with guild Zanshin on our private forums.  If it is decided that your guild is not helping the cause of the Neutral team we will ostricize you and will not partake in any fights or events with your guild.   I must advise you not to make any disparaging remarks about guild Darkenbane or our conclusion will be a forgone one and will escalate to killing your guild (training) as well.

Untill then have fun with Shame "helping" you in fights lol.

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" face="sans-serif">If you are trying to see things from both sides - lets cover points you cite as the evidence.....<BR><BR>>Shame last night was reported to be hanging <BR>>out with an evil who was slaughtering <BR>>neutrals. <BR><BR>So Shame sat down and chatted with a player from another side....big deal maybe both wanted a break from PvP and fancied a bit of social interaction other thatn 'my d00d 0wnz j00s'<BR><BR>>Zanshin was reported in MM asking Neutral <BR>>not to PK goodies cause they wanted to PvE <BR>>there. <BR><BR>Truble dealt with this just fine<BR><BR>>Member of Zasnhin grovelled to Milt leader <BR>>of Hat ein open chat and was not removed <BR>>for his actions and words. <BR><BR>Who? - never seen this - but why should he be removed all fair in love and war - if grovelling saved his life and 4 hours worth of xp and CR then thats his/her choice.<BR><BR>>Member of guild Zanshin who has now quit <BR>>advised he knows there has been a treaty <BR>>with Shame and some Evils. <BR><BR>Except the member wasnt an officer, actually knew nothing, and had been reported to the guild for ninja looting already - he knew he was gonna get kicked - hence his first comment of 'Im gonna leave my guild shortly' - axe to grind perhaps?<BR><BR>>A member of guild Zanshin caused a train <BR>>(this is not disputed) which took the <BR>>darkenbane contingent out of the fight in <BR>>EW right when Ruin ported into IC. <BR><BR>Seemed to be disputed by Truble fairly well<BR><BR>>About a week ago, we called for everyone in <BR>>GD to prep for battle with guild Ruin. A <BR>>Zanshin member called out for us all to <BR>>prepare our coffins and laughed at us (this <BR>>does not seem appropriate and helpful when <BR>>trying to organize a battle). <BR><BR>Helpful: no, joke: maybe, lightening up the atmosphere a bit: maybe...<BR><BR>>Shame's direct comments to Darwoth are <BR>>rather incriminating. <BR><BR>Actually yet again they show someone who is busy levelling and not taking an active role in PvP till they got their levels - and that seems pretty smart to me - its why Shame is lvl 58 and you aren't. A lvl 58 is far more PvP capable than a lvl 40 and is going to be able to help his guild and other neutrals far better in PvP and questing.<BR><BR>I have stuck to levelling with a few isolated forays into PvP when it will not interrupt my goals - having already got to lvl 19 on the Good team and 35 on Neutral I should be over 50 by now if I hadn't changed. Does this make me anti-neutral as I don't run immediately to any shout of 'Evils in zone'? No it makes me smart enough to know that the best way to beat them is to level faster. Ruin were smart enough to avoid PvP until they had their levels, and now they can pretty much kill who they want, where they want.<BR><BR>-----------------------------------------<BR><BR>I have grouped with at least 20-30 different members of Darkenbane on many occasions.<BR><BR>On the whole they have been great players, great people, and good fun to be with.<BR><BR>A few bad apples are present in any barrel - and this seems to be a case of those with an axe to grind being bitter and highly vocal.<BR><BR>Despite members of Ruin and TDC providing far more substantial evidence that Shame has not committed any of the sins you assign to him, some remain fixed in their views.<BR><BR>I would hate to see the Neutral team rip itself apart due to a few bitter individuals who have their own personal reasons for wanting to attack shame or others.<BR><BR>I would like to continue to group with and fight alongside Darkenbane members. Those of Darkenbane that still possess reasoning faculties will I'm sure see that this is a big storm over nothing - those who wish to remain blinkered, good luck to you.<BR><BR>Harpeyes</FONT><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" face="sans-serif">Just reading the posts from you DB members makes me fuckin sick.  Nothing you have shown or said is ANY evidence, let alone solid evidence, that Shame has a pact or any sort of relationship with Ruin.  And, if you'd get your head out of your asses, you'd realize that although this IS a pvp server, it's possible for members of opposite teams to cooperate at certain points.  Take for example LnS...well, if it was all out war all the time, then that would be an impossibility.  <BR><BR>At least bohn shows some fucking character here by not making accusations based on faulty screenshots and bullshit evidence.  If any one of you thinks for a second that Zanshin isn't about neutral, or doesn't want to pk and has a non agression pact with Ruin or whatnot, well, fucking wake up.  We raid evil zones as a guild once a week, killing every evil we see.  If TDC asks Shame and the guild for help, we show up.  We aren't cowards, we aren't evils in disguise, we're fucking sullon zek players on the neutral diety alliance.  <BR><BR>I'm sick of all your accusations directed at shame, and consequently the entire guild.  Darwoth's post of chat lines shows exactly how little you all know about what's going on.  Here, let me give you an example:<BR><BR>Shame tells you, 'I got nothin to fight about'<BR>Shame tells you, 'I don't just fight to fight'<BR>You told Shame, 'this server is for pvp, coming here means you're supposed to...pvp the other teams'<BR>Shame tells you, 'Rallos is pvp'<BR><BR>Does anyone else see what I see about this?<BR><BR>Sullon is a fucking pvp server, so is rallos, but unless you're a fucking darkenbane reject, you don't go around pking everyone you can.  This just shows that DB has maintained, and will maintain, their Rallos philosophy on Sullon.<BR><BR>Basically the whole message of this post was:<BR>Anything Darkenbane says should be put under serious scrutiny before even acknowledging, let alone believing.<BR><BR>-Ram</FONT><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" face="sans-serif">Two direct quotes from Grayrage:<BR><BR>"Please go over ALL of the evidence above and don;t skip any for explanations."<BR><BR>"Shame, feel free to explain all of this."<BR><BR><BR>I found that funny. Don't know if anyone else will.<BR><BR><BR>Maybe you don't realize ,Gray, that you don't deserve shit from Shame. He's spoken with you, tried to convince you that he is not allied with Ruin, or evils, evils have spoken and said they are not allied with Shame or Zanshin.<BR><BR>Yet all of this falls on deaf ears.<BR><BR>You only want to hear Shame say that he is allied with evils. It's pretty god damn obvious that he is not, both sides of this hypothetical Shame-Evil alliance have told you it does not exist. Yet you persist. Shut up already. You are wrong. There is no alliance. All the ACTUAL EVIDENCE points against an alliance. You, Grayrage, Darkenbane, are wrong, completely wrong in your accusations.<BR><BR>"As the trial of Shame and Zanshin continues on our forums and more evidence reveals some things many people in that guild did not know, we see many members fo Zanshin leaving."<BR><BR>4 members have left. I can tell you their names, if you want. One of them was asked to leave, and another followed. The other two left of their own accord, due to differences in opinion between the guild and them. In the course of these 4 members leaving Zanshin, we have recruited more than 4 additional members. Our guild is not weakening in any way, due to any of this. I've told you, as Shame and the rest of Zanshin have, that we are NOT allied with any evils whatsoever. We fight our way, you fight yours. If we don't fight, it's our business.<BR><BR>"Zanshin onbiously has/had alot of other ideas about how to fight this war."<BR><BR>Quit trying to make this into some fucking epic battle that is shaping history. It's not that, nor do you lead this "war." Everquest is a god damn game, and you treat it as if it's real life. By the way, EQ is not real life.<BR><BR>Again, everything you, Darkenbane, have said is wrong. You have no actual evidence. The actual evidence points away from your ridiculous accusations. Some people don't like Shame or Zanshin. That's become pretty obvious.<BR><BR>I'm almost done with this. Darkenbane is, I would think, trying to bring Zanshin down. But anyone with sense (ie most of Zanshin) realize that, well, everything Darkenbane says is utter shit. Nothing you say makes sense. No evidence supports your accusations.

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" face="sans-serif">Ive said it elsewhere, Ill say it again. <BR><BR>I dont KNOW that Shame has some thing with the evils. It definately appears that he has something going on. Letting some prick farm a bunch of greenies in a newbie zone while you sit and watch is bullshit.<BR><BR>I dont believe that I have ever sat back when there was an evil that I could help kill. If there is someone that even appears to be takeable, I go for it. <BR><BR>So in the end, it may turn out that Shame is just a punk that is afraid to PvP. If that is the case, fine. I dont trust him either way presently. <BR><BR>Whatever the case/truth is, when I eventually come to my final decision on where Shame stands in my eyes, that is where he will sit. If it is with the untrusted, that will never change. <BR><BR>Anyhow, still waiting for an end to the mess.<BR><BR>Anni</FONT><BR>
