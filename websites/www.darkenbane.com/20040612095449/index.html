Korpo made a movie about his experiences with us on the discord server. It was a pleasure having you, and thank you for including us in the movie. Discord was fun as hell, and the group pic at the end makes me /cry.<br />

Btw, it’s a slow load, so sit tight and wait, it’s worth it. (seriously. It's a horrible load. If it seems like it's stuck, don't touch it)<br />

While we hate to give into the drama brought on by the former members of DB, but due to all the lies, deceit, and propaganda being spread, we thought you should all know the truth.  We are trying to wipe the slate clean and make a smooth transition, but we are unable to because some people have become a nuisance and simply cannot be ignored.  Due to these people's actions, there are severe consequences and so the truth and the whole story now will unravel.<br />
<br />
<b>1)  Bannings</b><br />
<br />
The following people have been banned from this site:<br />
<br />
Grayrage<br />
Lesa <br />
Mindgames<br />
<br />
The reasons for their banning are as follows:<br />
<br />
1) Constant recruiting on the Darkenbane forums via PM's after they were first asked nicely not to and then were warned once again later.  A few of these PM's were forwarded to the Overlords providing us proof and will be delivered upon request to the membership.  We aren't going to stand by idle while they try and poach members, especially when the PM's tell a story that couldn't be further from the truth.<br />
<br />
2) Undermining and trying to manipulate the leadership from outside of the guild and even worse, while STILL in the guild.  Here is a clip from Toad's answering machine where you will find famous quotes such as:<br />
<br />
"If I have Meter with me we'll just do it and if anyone disagrees I'll just freaking kick all these motherfuckers out."<br />
<br />
There is also some other stuff about badmouthing the leadership.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.darkenbane.com/audio/grayrage.mp3" target="_blank">http://www.darkenbane.com/audio/grayrage.mp3</a><br />
<br />
The voice on the tape is Grayrage.<br />
<br />
3)  Being a general ass, trolling the boards and derailing applications for the sake of insinuating drama.  It really is ironic how they used to tell board trolls to get off our nuts when they are now those trolls need to get a life.  What is even more ironic is that they all wished to leave on good terms, yet, 2 seconds later they are trolling threads and flaming individuals in the public sections.<br />
<br />
So how did we get to this?  The next parts will explain.<br />
<br />
<b>2) Gray's fall from favor</b><br />
<br />
Unfortunately, all of this drama started with a very simple problem of making a decision between playing Alliance or Horde for World of Warcraft.  Here is what set everything up:<br />
<br />
1) Grayrage, for some reason or another was so adamant about playing alliance and was not willing to negotiate or discuss otherwise with anyone.<br />
<br />
2) The core thought it was too early to make a decision and also wanted to have a say in the issue.<br />
<br />
3) Gray came up with the idea of playing both factions.<br />
<br />
The entire leadership council, the core, and every member except for 2 lonely folks, being him and Lesa, shot down the idea of splitting the guild.  In fact, his loyalties to the guild were now in question and many people were irritated.<br />
<br />
4) Convinced to get his way, he pressured his views onto the guild by forcing an election runoff between himself ( Alliance ) and another candidate ( Horde ).  Whichever candidate won would become the new guildmaster and would be leading the guild under their appropriate faction.<br />
<br />
<b>3) Grayrage's Resignation as Guildmaster:</b><br />
<br />
After a bunch of volleying of the Alliance/Horde issues on the forums, Saradin finally answered his call and decided to run against him.  The night before the campaign speeches were to be posted, Grayrage found out that the majority of the officer core and more importantly, Meter, was going to vote against him, so he promptly threw in the towel and resigned as GM of Darkenbane.  He completely brought this on himself as the entire guild except a very select few were fully against the way he had been pushing the issue for the last couple weeks.  His plans to rip the guild apart were later revealed by Lesa in which they will create a new guild.<br />
<br />
<b>4) Negotiations with Grayrage</b><br />
<br />
The guild stood in limbo for awhile without a leader as Saradin took the reigns for a day, only to hand it back over to the council of the Overlords.  The negotiation period lasted for one week.  Before these negotations took place, there was a very hot and nasty conversation amongst the leaders of DB in TS.  While most were civil, Lesa was found to be screaming at the top of her lungs at "Fagpatch" and "Turd", swearing, and calling them every name in the book while constantly reiterrating to them "I HATE YOU FUCKERS."  Clearly, that's someone who should be an officer, right? Hah.<br />
<br />
Since this had been the 4th or so time that Gray had resigned from Darkenbane, the council wanted to create a terms of agreement before reinstating him to the overlord council.  The first draft consisted of an apology, a 5 man council ruled equally, and Lesa was to be stripped of her Officer status and have to reapply to the guild since she had formerly resigned from the guild.  Everyone was pretty apalled by her actions in TS and it was agreed that she should never hold a position of influence again.  The ToA was rejected and the council bent to nix the apology by having a 6 man council suggested by Gray where Maule would be instated as the 6th overlord to protect Gray's interest, but we didn't move on Lesa.  It was then rejected, again because of concerns of a public application by Lesa.  The council then bent, yet again, allowing her to re-apply in private.  The next rejection came with resignations and so concluded our negotiations.  All the overlords sincerely wanted Gray to come back to the the council and hold the entire guild together.  Sadly, this didn't happen because his priorities and loyalty were obviously elsewhere.<br />
<br />
This concludes the story of the truth and is based on 100% facts.  Some people's loyalties are to Gray and some are to the guild.  This is mainly for the members of DB as well as for the ex-DB members joining him under false pretenses, but it is also here for those that may consider joining him in the future.  While the old leadership had some sick penchant for drama, the new leadership does not.  Enjoy your bans and let the new age of Darkenbane begin.<br />

I actually sat down and looked at the WoW beta forums last night, and god was that a big mistake. That place is so bluebie infested you wouldn’t believe it. Here are a few random posts for your reading pleasure:<br />
<br />
<blockquote><smallfont>quote:</smallfont><hr>Hey Everyone, <br />
<br />
I've been having a wonderful time in Beta for a few months now. Being new to MMoG's and coming in from a primarily FPS based background i've been quite pleasantly suprised at how generous, kind and cooperative the majority of the WoW Beta community has been. This has enhanced my game experience immeasurably. <br />
<br />
It came as great shock however, when I was witness to a group of low level gnomes traveling under the clan name of "LOD" behaving quite badly near Anvilmar. I was in a cave, searching for Grik'ner the Cold, and killing Frostmane Welps. <br />
<br />
The LoD clan accosted me here, claiming that I was too high level to be in the cave, and using derogatory epithets such as "Homo" and "!@!@!%" (i.e.bundle of sticks) and a host of other unpleasant words to indicate their displeasure with my presence. I saw nothing wrong with my being there - my gnome was at level 5, this was the next quest on my itinerary, so I declined to respond to their language. <br />
<br />
Particularly nasty was "RonJeremyLOD" and "AsiaLOD". <br />
<br />
I wanted to bring this up only because the WoW beta community has been so remarkably cool over the past few months, and I hadn't experienced trash talk like this since my headier Counterstrike and Red Orchestra Days. I was content to leave it alone, but decided to post and give everyone a heads up - This LOD group is one bitter foul mouthed bunch, best left alone or avoided completely. <br />
<br />
Having said that, I wanted to end on a positive note, and thank those out there who've helped keep the Beta experience enjoyable and fun for everyone. I'm looking forward to more adventures! <br />

Thanks to LOD for pissing him off. He deserved it.<br />
 <br />
Needless to say, the number of irellevant topics is high enough to make a normal person go insane:<br />

<br />
This maybe an old topic, but is anyone else disappointed with the removal of the no facial hair option for gnome? I think it subtracts from the face choice. Who's with me? We Want To Shave!<hr></blockquote><br />
<br />
Or how about this one?:<br />
<br />
<blockquote><smallfont>quote:</smallfont><hr><br />
I've been playing for a little over a month now and have witnessed the economy of the game going to hell. <br />
<br />
Sure sure, you can tell me this is Beta all you want, but Beta is a precursor to how the game is going to be when it goes live. And if this Beta is any indication, then the economy of WoW is going straight into the crapper when it goes Live Release. <br />
<br />
Point in case: <br />
<br />
I was selling some things on the trade channel last night and all of a sudden I see a purple named weapon come up. <br />
<br />
Flurry Axe <br />
<br />
The poster wanted a 210 GOLD min bid to start the auction.... <br />
<br />
210 GOLD?!?!?!?!?! Are you people NUTS??? <br />
<br />
The audacity of some people just amazes me. <br />
<br />
First off, this is BETA. WTF in the name of everything thats holy do you need 210 gold or more for? <br />
<br />
Secondly...hello you greedy imbecile...YOU are the reason why the game economy is in the crapper. <br />
<br />
The funny part is...the axe wasnt even a good axe really. I didn't see one person bid on it in trade channel. <br />
<br />
Anyways....guess my point is that some of us are trying to play this game and are doing the best we can...and it just burns me to see some greedy a$$ try and scam the community. So what if its a purple named item. Get off yer high horse and stop being a tard. <br />
<br />
BTW....I'm getting close enuf to get into the Scarlet Monastary. Once I do get in there, I'm gonna farm the hell out of it...and then I'm going to GIVE AWAY everything I dont need...FOR FREE....then we'll see how you greedy bastards feel when u can't get but 2 silvers for your Miters and Hands and Herods and such. <br />
<br />
Enjoy it while it lasts...I hop Blizzard puts a cramp in your camping style before we go live or the economy will blow up in your face. <br />
<br />
Oh and heres a link to a post about greedy players...both the posters and the thief in the team...  <br />
<br />
Enjoy<br />
<hr></blockquote><br />
<br />
OH HOW HORRIBLE. The guy that worked to get the axe determines the price? /GASP! What an evil capitalist pig!. Clue: Mind your own business you fucking retard. If you don't have the gold, get another cheaper weapon till you can afford it.<br />
<br />
I am once again reminded how retarded gamers are.<br />

I have the sad duty of announcing that two of DBs legends are retiring from the guild.<br />
<br />
Grayrage and Lesa have informed us that they would like to pursue new projects, and we accept this resignation with sorrow. Gray and Lesa have been the heart and soul of this organization for years, and we wouldn’t be what we are today, one of the premier pvp guilds in the community, if it wasn’t for Grays leadership. He is a true leader and a great guy.<br />
<br />
On DBs behalf I’d like to wish them both the best of luck in whatever project they may pursue, and on a personal note, I’d like to thank them for their friendship. <br />
<br />
But of course, out of the chaos will come order, so I’m going to take this chance to introduce the new leadership of DB.<br />
<br />
It will be somewhat different than before, but most of you shouldn’t really feel any difference since it’s the same old bastards in charge. Here are the new ranks:<br />
<br />
Overlord.<br />
Overlords will be the supreme big cahuna master generals of the guild, and they will be responsible for everything from kicking members out, to picking which shade of pink should be on our emblem. They will, in other words, be the guildleader(s). Those Overlords are:<br />
<br />
Meter<br />
Saradin<br />
Eyepatch<br />
Maule<br />
Stoffer<br />
<br />
The guild has been standing still for the past few weeks, and I think I speak for everyone when I say that we are really looking forward to making the super guild even more super (super x2).<br />
<br />
Core.<br />
This title will replace the old M+/Officer title, so instead of two groups closely connected, there will be one big pool of people (with a cooler name might I add). Core members will be expected to carry out practical assignments for the leadership, such as day to day leadership, leading raids and even recruitment. They will not be involved in voting on guild matters, which will be done solely by the Overlords, but they will have a access to a core board where they can advise leaders on differnt subjetcs.<br />
<br />
Everything else will stay the same. Members are still members, recruits are still recruits, Once is still a polar bear, and Sieges still lives in Ohio.<br />
<br />
Hopefully everyone will back this new leadership up, and we can go back to being the psycho pk family we have always been. <br />
