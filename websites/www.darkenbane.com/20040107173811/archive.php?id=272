One of the folks at Sony responsible for how PvP is set up for our server posted a request for opinions on various issues and troubles with PvP on Sullon Zek.  To post on this board you must log on using your Everquest username and PW AND you must be careful not to FLAME people or act in a fucked up manner or you EQ account will get banned.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum6/HTML/000854.html"target="_blank">This is a link to the post that ALL of us should be very interested in watching and voicing our opinions on.</a><br />
<br />
My post at the above link reads as follows:<br />
<br />
This subject is important to all the people who play on the PvP server and more specifically on SZ.  As such, I will take the time to write an extensive post regarding the issues of PvP and support them accordingly with potential solutions.  My post will discuss each issue that I believe is a SERIOUS problem that needs to be addressed regarding PvP on SZ  in  sections with the contents as follows:<br />
<br />
1. Team Balance<br />
2. Golem Wands/Recharging of items<br />
3. Manaburn/Lifeburn<br />
4. Horses<br />
5. Water Fighting<br />
6. Zones<br />
7. Spell Damage Nerf<br />
<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Before the server went live many people pointed out the glaring problems with the teams.  All pretty much unanimously agreed the Evil Team was by far the most favored and the Goody Team was doomed.  Sony ignored the posts and continued as planned which ultimately turned out to be WRONG.  The reason is as follows:<br />
<br />
Team Make Up and geography -  <br />
<br />
Evil - This team has Iksars, Ogres, Trolls and DEs (99%) all to themselves.  They SHARE the following races: Barbarians (33%), Humans (33%), Erudites (33%), Gnomes (33%), Humans (33%), Wood Elves (33%) and Half Elves (33%).  This gives them 4 exclusive races and 11 available races.  This gives them 3 classes with Instant Kill abilities (HT, Manaburn, Lifeburn).   This gave them the starting areas virtually UNCONTESTED of  Nektulos, LS (with Sol and Nerana dungeons), Fearot  (with CT dungeon), Innothule Swamp (with Guk) and ALL of Kunark.  Their mandatory (where conflict was GOING to happen) PvP borders consisted of only fighting in WC and SK against the Neutral Team for those zones.<br />
<br />
Neutral - This team has Halfings (99%) and Dorfs exclusively to themselves.  They SHARE the following races:  DE (1%), Barbarian (33%), Half Elf (33%), Wood Elf (33%), Human (33%), High Elf (50%), Erudite (33%) and Gnomes (33%).  This gives them 2 exclusive races and allows them the chance to be 10 races total. They have one instant kill class (manaburn).The original uncontested zones included Misty (with RE Dungeon), HPH and area, Butcherblock (with Unrest).  The PvP border and mandatory conflict zones included WC (evils), SK (evils), BB/Fay zone (goodies), EF/BB/QH (goodies), SF/LF (goodies/evils).<br />
<br />
Goody - This team currently has only Cat People as exclusively to them (but NO exclusive races when server was born).  They had the option of being the following races: Barb (33%), Human (33%), Gnome (33%), High Elf (50%), Wood Elf (33%), Half Elf (33%) and  Erudites (33%).  This gives them ONE exclusive race and the availability to be 8 races.  Geographically the goodies had ZERO uncontested areas and eventually carved out a spot in EF/Perma as well as Gfay/LFay/KK/Crushbone.   The goodies always either fought over zones or contested zones with Neutrals only but in ALL of their zones because they always bordered neutral uncontested areas.  This is what has/had lead tot he animosity between the Neutral/Goody teams.<br />
<br />
The evil team having 4 races exclusive, 3 insta kill classes and 11 races potentially for creation exceeds the Neutral teams 2 exclusive races, 10 available races and 1 instant kill class and FAR exceeds the good team's 1 exclusive race (which came long after SZ was born), 8 available races and single insta kill class.  Additionally, the evil team's multitude of uncontested zones early in the life of the server gave them the ability to avoid PvP entirely if they so desired whilst the Neutral and goody teams were constantly battling for lands.  For these reasons, I am comfortable in stating that Sony failed to create our server with balanced Teams and is the primary reason why it's population dropped so dramatically (because if the teams were balanced Neutral and Goody would have the same numbers as evil).<br />
<br />
A better team makeup would have been as follows (and one that can still exist if you follow my proposed solution):<br />
<br />
Evil - Ogre, Troll, Iksar, DE, Human (33%), Erudite (33%)<br />
Neutral - Halfing, Gnome, Dorf, Barbarian, Human (33%), Erudite (33%)<br />
Goody - High Elf, Wood Elf, Half Elf, Cat Dude, Human (33%), Erudite (33%)<br />
<br />
The only class restrictions would be as follows:<br />
<br />
SK - Evil only<br />
Ranger - Neutral/Goody Only<br />
Paladin - Goody/Neutral Only<br />
<br />
Possible solutions for fixing the balance problems:<br />
<br />
Revamp all PvP servers - Create 3 PvP servers with the RZ, SZ and TZ/VZ rule sets.   Allow anyone to move log between the new servers one time with all gear.  For people already on SZ allow them to switch their race to remain on their team (IE: DE wizzies changing to Gnome).  Keep the 1 character per account (to prevent cross teaming) and consider making a language for each team that is unrecognizable and learnable by their foes.  Institute a NO SAME TEAM TRAINING rule, because it is impossible to stop your own teammate from doing this, but otherwise leave the rule set alone.  Additionally, expand the points system more and add some cool stats for this.  Everyone in ANY kind of gaming likes to fool with statistics.<br />
<br />
Nerf the Evil Team - This possibility involves returning the evil team exp modifiers back to normal whilst leaving the other teams where they are.  The trouble with this is that many evil team members are DONE expin' and it will not effect them.  Another possibility is to make the max rez for PvP death on the evil team 50%.  Allowing evil to attack each other might also help to balance the scales.   The power behind the evil team is their ability to exp and raid safely due tot heir geographic and numerical superiority.  If they must worry about more enemies, this will significantly cut down on this advantage whilst surely not destroying them as the high end guilds will surely make alliances and such just as they do on RZ where they do not kill each other.   The trouble with this is that there really will not be much evil on evil killing as killing one of their own team will make them a "PKer" just like on RZ where they are outcast from the community.  IF, however, they made an evil on evil PvP kill a single item loot situation, this truly might be an option that will effect and slow them down some.<br />
<br />
Merge Goody and Neutral - I have sat in The Bazaar for considerable periods of time and am astonished that the Evil Team actually outnumbers the Neutrals and Goodies present by 2 to 1 and out levels them still.  I am not sure that such a merger would actually SOLVE the problem at all unless possibly combined with some of the Evil team Nerfs mentioned above.  It would help in perhaps finding groups easier, but I am not sure it is a solution.   I far prefer the first solution.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Golem Wands have 5 charges of Pillage Enchantment, which removes 4 buffs from the target.  This item has no cast time and can be used while running.  In battle this item WILL remove ALL buffs from its target effectively taking that individual out of battle by simply clicking the item on them.  This item is detrimental to PvP as it creates an extreme imbalance in combat as it will automatically make the target desire to flee the confrontation or to be killed with relative ease.  Add to this the ability to "recharge" these items and you have a situation where PvP becomes impossible against those who are using the item and the exploit to keep the item charged forever.<br />
<br />
The most important thing to fix regarding this issue is the recharging of the items.  Camped legitimately these items would not be prevalent enough to cause any long-term harm to PvP.  But when they are constantly in the hands of a few folks who ALWAYS use them as if it was a skill, it is a huge problem.  To fix this all that needs to be done is the item to be given LORE/NO DROP status.  End of problem.  The same should be done with other wands such as Conflag Wands and Life Tap Wands.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Manaburn and Lifeburn has been addressed by many here and it seems is unanimously agreed upon to be detrimental to PvP.  Let me cover some basic problems with these spells:<br />
<br />
1. The Evil Team has 3 instant kill abilities (HT, Manaburn, Lifeburn) whilst the Neutral and Goody teams have one (Manaburn).<br />
<br />
2. These spells prevent PvP as many will flee from pvP instead of risk being instantly killed.<br />
<br />
3. These spells mock the thought that any skill in PvP should exist or DOES exist.  Why bother outfitting yourself for PvP or practicing certain skills in PvP combat if someone can simply kill you instantly regardless of any planning or practice you might have done?  It makes a joke of any pretense that some skill is involved in PvP, otherwise I would like to see these spells used in the TBOTB competitions.<br />
<br />
4. These spells will eventually lead to the PvP servers being ONLY Wizards and Necros.<br />
<br />
Solution - Make these spells PvE only.  Both Necros and Wizards have plenty of PvP power to survive these being taken out of the PvP game.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Horses are a nifty addition to EQ and surely a lot of fun, but they have caused a great deal of problems for PvP.  Along with the multitude of bugs whereby one cannot hit someone on a horse (getting an out of range message even when they are right next to you), it is a simple PvP imbalance that some folks can run as fast as a Bard without actually being a Bard.  It is hard enough as it is to follow people who have SOW on let alone someone with Bard speed ALL of the time.  The fact of the matter is that PvP needs to be SLOWED down so that lag and hill bugging is not such a huge factor in combat.  <br />
<br />
Solution possibilities:<br />
<br />
1. Make it so you automatically dismount from your horse if engaged in combat (like Bard travel Song).<br />
2. Get rid of Horses on PvP servers.<br />
3. Only allow the 60k horses on PvP.<br />
<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
I know the reason that we cannot cast on our fellow players in the water is to prevent a tank from fighting a mob IN the water while a cleric OUTSIDE the water HEALS him with immunity from the mob.  The trouble with this is EXTREMELY frustrating PvP where people exploit this by running in and out of the water to avoid spell hits.  This gives a major advantage to those with better connections and also deters PvP, as many won't even bother fighting if water is nearby.<br />
<br />
Solutions:<br />
<br />
1. Enable aggressive spells on players in the water whilst keeping beneficial ones disabled.<br />
2. Make water mobs summon.<br />
3. Make water mobs more like Kelorek Dar who can come out of the water to attack people.<br />
<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Zones are a commons source of problems and exploits in PvP.  The following TWO are the most glaring troubles:<br />
<br />
Zone Tag - This is when a player lingers near a zone knowing he is only a few steps away from safety and thus virtually immune from PvP attack.  The player then is free to act however he wants with no consequence or worry about PvP death.  If attacked he simply zones back and forth until he loses his foe.  Then he heals up or meds and continues the "game" of zone tag.<br />
<br />
Solution - Force a mandatory time limit on REZONING where a player must wait at least 1 or 2 minutes before being allowed to zone a second time.<br />
<br />
Zone Plugging - This is where a person pulls his modem cord right as he zones that has the effect of instantly camping a person and saving him from a possible PvP death.<br />
<br />
Solution - Make the plugged person appear on the opposite side of the zone LD and killable.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
With the advent of Vellious and SOL, players have proven the ability to get enormous Hps and resists bonuses over when the game originally started.  Ice Comet used to be an instant kill spell, but now many casters could easily survive 6 hits from it let alone a fully buffed 60th level warrior with 6k hps.  The fact of the matters is that the spell damage nerf was an outdated thing, which is no longer appropriate.  Removing it will allow casters to get back in the fight with the melees that wield such things as Primal Weapons and TOV gear with 150+ to all resists.  It is my believe that taking away this nerf will still require considerable time and casting by enemies who are prepared for such combat.</td></tr>
