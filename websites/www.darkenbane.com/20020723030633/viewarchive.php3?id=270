<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="1">Submitted by <a href="mailto:grayrage@darkenbane.com">Grayrage</a> on 26-02-2002 14:57</font><p>Well, another patch has come and gone and still the Evil Team has two classes available to them with instant kill ability. So, in the usual course Sony has taken on SZ for "Team Balance", The Evil Team has MANY Lifeburning Necros and several Manaburning wizards whilst the other 2 Teams have none.<br />
<br />
Of course we know this is mainly due to the Evil team having the superior (smell the sarcasm) players AND we all know that the Goodies and Neutrals just don't have Lifeburn because we are poor Necromancer players *cough*, so of course we deserve to be instant killed by gimps who never could match us previously in PvP even with the enormous advantages of their team (did i forget to mention all the Neutral and Goody SKs out there with HT?).<br />
<br />
So another day goes by where our constant petitions, letters and tells fall upon ears that seem to hear us, but yet cause no change for the betterment of the game and the server.....and with that passing day yet more people leave Sullon Zek.  Some even from Darkenbane who are renowned for their resillience against the poorest of odds.<br />
<br />
As we lose faith that Sony will take the few minutes to change Golem and Conflag Wands to lore, no drop or turn Manaburn and Lifeburn OFF for PvP, our eyes begin to turn to other games in earnest and we piddle with some PvE mobs (when we can secretly do it without some clown with instant kill taking out our people).  I really do not feel much like posting this stuff as it implies we are having fun, but in reality we are all getting weary of the extreme inbalance and the lack of attention to the glaring issues we have received lately.  But amid all of this, we still DO kill some stuff....or try.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, about 15 DB found and pulled the boss camel, Zelninik, from Umbral Plains.  We felt him out some (dying pretty much to learn what he does...which is 2 different ae nukes/stuns and flurrying as well as an interesting ability to warp at the end of the fight and single summon us).<br />
<img src="http://www.darkenbane.com/pictures/300/30/large/13995.jpg"><br />
<br />
So finally we drop this guy and Sieges got himself a cool range slot item while Trucid got a nice bracer.  (sorry no pics of these items are even up on websites yet).<br />
<img src="http://www.darkenbane.com/pictures/300/30/large/13996.jpg"> <br />
<br />
That was actually quite and accomplishment for so few folks as he was real dick.  ANYHOW, 21 TOW, 13 DB, 11 SOB and 1 Inkara dropped Zlandicar again with DB getting the Heart (grats Gowenna!).  No pics cause Zlandicar looked like a giant man to me during this fight which was kinda ghey.  After Zlandicar, we decided to try Klandicar, but sure enough...the leet 1 shot kill artists showed up to prove their "supiority" in PvP skill, so instead of fighting (for the most part...cause no one wanted to be the recipient of the instant kills), Agrul decided to kite a few (rofl) WW critters around to make things interesting.<br />
<img src="http://www.darkenbane.com/pictures/300/30/large/13997.jpg"><br />
<br />
Although it was amusing seeing the train Agrul had so artfully collected, PvP was again a joke as most of the non-evils simply left to avoid the inevitable possibility of being instant killed by some low skill gimp.  It was a shit...a giggle...and then we camped to have a beer cause it was the same old thing.  Grats Sony, you have proven to us that you can make mistakes (the team balance, allowing MB and LB), but don't have the integrity to admit it AND, worse, the loyalty to us to fix it.<br />
<br />
I would really like to see a public notice that you fucked up the Teams on Sullon Zek.  Just admit it.  SZ was SUCH a good idea.  All you had to do was actually make the stupid Teams balanced.  Why not take a moment to ASK us what we think?   To actually LISTEN to us for once?  Even now it's not to late to fix things....people ALWAYS have good ideas.  *sighs in frustration*.<br />
<br />
This is our notice to Sony and to everyone who plays with or against us.  Darkenbane prepares to leave Everquest if some effort is not made soon to repair these glaring issues.<br><br></td></tr>
