They outnumbered us, outleveled us and still lost 4 to 1.     Just so folks who were not there know the story, I will go over it:<br />
<br />
I logged in and got invited to the SolB group (which was enjoying it's usual level 1 cheater trains).  No sooner had i arrived when my spy advised the antis (yes, there are actually ANTI PKs on Discord which makes up all of the server except for us) were preparing for some big "shindig" against us.  I thanked him and began to monitor their doings.  Soon I saw them appearing in BB and called Darkenbane to ARMS!<br />
<br />
About 15 DB ranging from level 16 to level 39 (me) met and organized in Lesser Fay within Minutes.  It was an incredbly fast response and just barely in time too!.  No sooner did our SF force zone into LF, the Saromon the Cheater  (they should give him this title)  came in.   We chased him down, mezzed him and had him blind...oh he was a dead man, but then, guess what?  Poof....yes, he insta gated wihtout casting anything.  Ok no worries.  We are used to it.<br />
<br />
I checked my /who dipshit list and I saw the morons (no offense of course) all spread out between BB and Gfay so I ordered the immediate move of all our forces to Gfay knowing they were all over the place.  Sure as fuck we found only 1 group of them milling about near the wizzie spires with the rest all over God's green Earth.  We enaged, they fought briefly then began to run as they saw their demise immenant (jesus, i cannot spell). Unfortutnely, their level 37ish ranger was not so lucky as he/she got rooted, snared, blinded and then butt fucked to level 1.  BAM, 1 down!<br />
<br />
Some of them had gated from us further splititng up their overpowering force and i ordered the immediate move to BB zone.  They held the BB zone line with pets up, but i knew they were disorganized and afraid from my spy's constant updates.  I commanded the attack almost immediately and a HUGE battle ensued!  Holy shit BATMAN@!!<br />
<br />
Bylo charged in like a gnome on his period and unfortunetly got anal raped :(   Other then him  (30th wiz) we suffered no losses.  The anti PKs, however, had no such luck as their 40th level mage went down (BANG down goes number 2).  The others withdrew back to the LDON camp.  We stayed at the zone line getting our pets up and resting a moment whilst fighting off Saromon's hacker attacks (attacking from out of range and the usual BS we are getting more familiar with).  Meanwhile, my spy advised they had 3 folks sitting in GFAY right at the BB zoneline (OMG?  are they stupid?)  As soon as this information came in, I immeditely ordered the attack on those three and down went a 35th+ mage (BANG number 3!)<br />
<br />
Further decreasing their numbers, I knew they had no chance versus us and ordered the attack on them in BB at the LDON camp.  They never engaged, instead simply fleeing and scattering throughout the lands.  Their massed raid which had started (in their channel) as an overconfident sure thing, ended in dismal defeat as they fled, routed by a smaller lower level force.<br />
<br />
We goofed around and split up the phat loots whilst letting Bylo get his gear back (they obviously could not loot him).  Everyone then went about their business, made exp groups and such.<br />
<br />
Soon, tho, my spy advised they were trying for round 2.  They began gathering in Stonebrunt mountains some 22 people (they are like fuckin' rabbits I say!  We keep killin' them but they never seem to run out of people!)  They had 3 34th level plus druids so I once again called Darkenbane to prepare for battle! We organized and prepped at the SF Druid Ring.  They had several level 1 Gnomes buzzing around and knew we had only 15 or so defenders versus their 22+.  Yet they delayed and delayed and we began to get bored :(<br />
<br />
After perhaps an hour they finally began porting a group or two into Gfay (my spy said they were scared to port into us in SF).  I checked and some were still in Stonebrunt!  They were split up AGAIN!   I immediatly ordered the attack on the ones who were alone in Lesser Fay (about 60% of them).  As soon as we zoned in we insta killed a 20th level chanter (BANG number 4!) with the next victim already targeted and ready to die.....but then BLAMMO...."you are disconnected"!!!<br />
<br />
Yeap, the zone crashed.  We all were in TS and the command was given to continue trying to get back in.  Within minutes the zone was back up and we got in.  Funny, Saroman was in gfay when he was in Lesser fay during our attack.  How did that happen?  Oh wait....he is a cheater.  Forgot.  Ho hum, how much longer will he be playing.....<br />
<br />
Anyhow, they accused us of crashing the zone on purpose (surprise surprise), but it truly saved their lives, so if anything they should be thanking whoever did it.   <br />
<br />
So it went down, 4 of them dead, 1 of us.  ON a server where when you die...u really freagin' DIE.   This MAY be the last big battle of Discord, folks.  Most DBers have quit, sickened with the constant and blatant cheating and the lack of action taken by Sony.  Perhaps even sicker that the bluebs who cry to us about US cheating constantly hang out with the ones who are really doing it.  Although we sure thank whichever one duped that 6k plat and was stupid enough to get killed by us.<br />
<br />
It was a fun fight.  Surely a good one for what may be the final battle on Discord.  Grats DBers, u once again did awesome job and showed what it is to be an organized fighting force.</td></tr>
