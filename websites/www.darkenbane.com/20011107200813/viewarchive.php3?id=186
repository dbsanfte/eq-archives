I wanted to give some information on what we are still planning to do with Sullon.<br>
<br>
The first thing that will always be in progress is adding Sullon specific content. You will notice that their a some new NPC's that will start to appear on this server to guide and explain the rules and what options you may have as a member of a certain Deity Alliance.<br>
<br>
For Example: The first set of NPC's will offer an item for a small donation that will allow players to identify players of another alliance through armor tints. This NPC will also explain in more detail how Insignias work, and what they may be used for in the future. NOTE: Not all these NPC's are done for every deity. They will be completed and patched as time permits.<br>
<br>
The second topic is team balance.<br>
<br>
Very soon, there will be methods to determine outside the game what team has control of what areas. The strength and maybe some other stats about that team will be shown. We may increase or decrease the reward for a particular alliance based on this information. An example would be offering a larger bounty for the insignia of a slain Cazic Thule follower over the insignia of a slain Tunare follower.<br>
<br>
On this same topic will be slightly changing the way teams identify each other through /con. We will be changing it such that each team will be able to tell which team his target is aligned with. This will help those who wish to form a temporary alliance with another team.<br>
<br>
Other gameplay issues.<br>
<br>
We will be removing the below level 6 PvP immunity in mid to high level adventure zones. This will be done to prevent players below level 6 from causing grief without the higher level players having a means to retaliate. A prime example of this is the level 5 bard training sand giants in the oasis. Because this would be considered a mid level adventure zone, the level 5 bard could and would most likely be killed by another player. This will indeed make the trek from one city to another, which is currently pretty safe for players below level 6, much more difficult if it involves going through adventure zones.<br>
<br>
Example zones where the below 6 PvP immunity would remain would be: Nektulos, Qeynos Hills, Innothule, and East Commons. These are just some of the examples. We will provide a full list or provide an in-game method of notifying the player when he enters one of the zones where this is implemented.<br>
<br>
We will be removing the ability for bards to use songs on boats. Following shortly behind that will come the removal of any melee combat on the boats. Before doing this, we will be taking a look at ways of insuring the safety of a traveler on a boat from NPC's in the ocean.<br>
<br>
We will be also changing the way PvP experience loss works on Sullon. The current problem is that a high level player can repeatedly kill lower level players without risk. The higher level player can continue to harass these lower level players without risk of experience or coin loss for any amount of time. While one could use the same argument that the lower level players are also losing nothing, we feel there should be some innate risk with a higher level player bottom feeding these lower level players. With this change, it will make higher level players think twice before attacking low level players. This will also give groups of lower level players an incentive to group up and take on higher level adversaries. So we intend to change the rules so that any character killed by a lower level character will lose experience. Along with the experience loss, the killing person will be given looting rights also.<br>
