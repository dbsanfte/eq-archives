<h1 align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to Lodestar!</font></h1>

<h3 align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Whether you're a member or considering it, please
take a look at our <a href="Charter.htm">Charter</a> and then wander on over to our <a href="http://pub80.ezboard.com/blodestar">Message Board</a> to say hi to our <a href="members.htm">members</a>!</font></h3>

<h2 align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">We have a <a href="http://www.calsnet.net/lodestar">calendar</a>!
&nbsp; Go take a look and add your event!</font></h2>

<h4 align="left"><font color="#000080"><strong>A brief summary of the charter, as
interpreted by Binnen</strong></font></h4>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Lodestar is a lawful/neutral guild.&nbsp; It is
based in friendship first and everything else a distant second.&nbsp; We aren't a power
leveling guild, an &quot;uber guild,&quot; or a particularly active raid guild.&nbsp; Our
only cast-in-stone rule for new members or alternate characters is that they must be at
least level 10.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">We are comprised of mature people of a wide age
range (from 18 - 41 as far as I know).&nbsp; Since we are comprised of mature people,
vulgar language in /guildchat is not allowed.&nbsp; Only children use &quot;adult&quot;
language where it's not appropriate, and we feel that it's not appropriate in guild chat.
&nbsp; Please don't get the impression we're prudes...I use the &quot;f&quot; word when I
feel the need to express my feelings that way to friends, including the other Elders
(guild leaders), and they're not particularly shy with the word either.&nbsp; &nbsp; We're
not Thought Police, we just want guild chat that any mature person would feel proud to
view and to which to contribute, whether they curse like Navy Seals or they're offended by
somewhat risqué jokes.&nbsp; What you say in /tells is your own business.</font></p>

<p align="left"><strong><font color="#000080">Becoming a member:</font></strong></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">It's not difficult to get a character of yours
fitted with the &lt;Lodestar&gt; guild tag.&nbsp; It simply requires two full members
(those who have made it out of &quot;Recruit&quot; status) to sponsor you and we'll tag
you immediately.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><big><u><strong>Keeping</strong> the tag is another
story</u>.</big>&nbsp; You will be a &quot;Recruit&quot; for your first month.&nbsp;
During that month you have a &quot;quest&quot; to complete; you must get at least 1/3 of
the members to like you well enough to vote for&nbsp; full membership. Since friendship is
THE thing upon which we are based, being friendly with ONLY&nbsp; your two sponsors CANNOT
be enough.&nbsp; Here's some tips (for those who don't like quest &quot;cheats,&quot;
don't read any further ;) ):<br>
<strong>Visit, read and post to the </strong><a href="http://pub80.ezboard.com/blodestar">Message
Board</a>.<br>
<strong>Speak up in guild chat</strong> (say hello to folks logging in, and goodbye to
those leaving, answer what questions you can, or simply be pleasant)<br>
<strong>Group with guild <a href="members.htm">members</a> you don't know very well.</strong></font></p>
