<p align=center><center><font face="Arial" color=#ffffff size=6><B>Our Charter<br></center></p><p align=left></B></font><font face="Arial" color=#ffffff size=4><B>LODESTAR GUILD CHARTER &amp; GUIDELINES FOR EXISTENCE <br></B></font><font face="Arial" color=#ffffff size=1><B><br></B></font><font face="Arial" color=#ffffff size=3><B>Lodestar: One that serves as an inspiration, model or guide. Our lodestar is friendship.<br></B></font><font face="Arial" color=#ffffff size=3><I>&quot;Lodestar is a social guild concentrating on friendship and community above all else. We promote the ideals of honesty, integrity, philanthropy, and fair play. We encourage diversity in all aspects of the game and use friendship as a core around which all other activities are built. We believe raiding is fun and an important part of EverQuest but not the sole purpose of our guild. Instead, spending time with friends and enjoyment of the game are our primary aims.&quot;</I></font><font face="Arial" color=#ffffff size=3><br></font><font face="Arial" color=#ffffff size=3><B><br>RULES AND REGULATIONS<br></B></font><font face="Arial" color=#ffffff size=2><br>Herein lie the rules and thoughts for the clean and efficient running of the guild known as Lodestar.<br></font><font face="Arial" color=#ffffff size=3><B><br>I. HIERARCHY<br><br>Lodestar is a hierarchy and consists of 5 levels:<br></B></font><font face="Arial" color=#ffffff size=2><br>Elder: <br>An Elder (&quot;guild leader&quot; in Verant parlance) is responsible for the charter of the guild and making all structural decisions concerning the guild. Elders may make changes to the Charter given three out of the four Elders agree. <br><br>Officer: <br>Officers are responsible for the day to day running of the guild. Officers will be designated as needed, based on the size of the guild. Some duties of Officers are: as contact points for new members, collecting and collating data about current guild membership, hearing initial grievances pertaining to guild members, serving as a point of contact with other guilds and supporting the central theme of the guild.<br><br>Members in Full Standing:<br>A full member has passed the recruitment stage and is allowed to sponsor other players into the guild as recruits. A full member may sponsor no more than 2 recruits in any one-month period. Full members are strongly encouraged to group with recruits and get to know them so that they can participate in membership votes for recruits with the most information available. It is very important to note those members in Lodestar have a very strong say in who will be members of the guild. As the guild is currently designed, it is very difficult for the guild to grow very large without every member knowing at least a third of the other members in the guild. We believe this encourages tight friendships and promotes a more controlled guild growth.<br><br>Recruits:<br>Recruit status is granted to a player when one full member of Lodestar offers sponsorship. During the next 30 days the Recruit will have access to all Member Forums on the message board. Recruits can only have one character in Lodestar during the 30 day period so the members will only have to worry about remembering one character to each player.<br><br>The Ruling Council:<br>The Ruling Council will be comprised of the Elders and the Officers. Issues dealing with changing the guild charter are discussed by the council but only voted on by the Elders. Any other issues brought before the Council will be voted upon with each Officer and Elder having exactly one vote. In most cases, simple majority rules will determine the outcome. Votes will be blind so that one voter doesn&#39;t influence another voter directly.<br><br></font><font face="Arial" color=#ffffff size=3><B>II. GENERAL DUTIES<br></B></font><font face="Arial" color=#ffffff size=2><br>Elders/Officers:<br>1. Promote the integrity and structure of the guild.<br>2. Have fun and make friends!<br>3. Keep up on what is happening in the guild <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a. Check the page and forums as often as reasonable<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b. Try to &quot;listen&quot; to what is being said in guild chat whenever possible<br>4. Try at all times to set an example for guild members<br>5. Help to guide and aid your guild mates <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a. Obviously twinking and power leveling is not required,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b. Nor is dropping everything because a guild member needs help finding something or killing something, etc.<br>6. Seek out potential recruits<br><br>Members:<br>1. Follow all General guidelines<br>2. Have fun and make friends!<br>3. Give your opinions and ideas about guild issues. We value your input!<br>4. Keep in touch with the guild as much as possible <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a. Post in the forum -- This is our central communication center. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b. Talk with your guild mates, either in guild chat or /tells<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;c. Do not be afraid to ask questions, if someone knows the answer and is able to respond, they usually will.<br>5. Always keep yours eyes open for potential recruits.<br>6. Vote on Recruits<br><br></font><font face="Arial" color=#ffffff size=3><B>III. MEMBERSHIP</B></font><font face="Arial" color=#ffffff size=2><br><br>Membership is granted to the player and not a particular character; however, that character should be a minimum of level 10. Once membership is granted, we will guild one or more of the player&#39;s characters on the Zebuxoruk server. Players may have characters that are members of other guilds and we strongly encourage you to cultivate friendship between Lodestar and your other guild(s) if that is the case. We prefer to have one character listed as a primary for purposes of paperwork but this is not required and you may change which character is listed as your primary at any time.<br><br>The following behaviors will prompt action for /guildremoving a Member or a Recruit:<br><br>1. Behavior unbecoming, AFTER investigation.<br>2. Not adhering to the Lodestar Charter. <br>3. Having someone non LS routinely run your LS character. We will always retag whenever the appropriate person is playing.<br><br>It may be required for the situation that an Elder or Officer to immediately /guildremove someone and then begin investigation. In those cases there is a chance to be retagged. In determining the action to be taken, the Ruling Council will take into consideration length of time in guild, activity in guild, activity on the message boards, adherence to the precepts of the guild charter, and any mitigating circumstances that occurred around the event. <br><br><br></font><font face="Arial" color=#ffffff size=3><B>IV. VOTING<br></B></font><font face="Arial" color=#ffffff size=2>Recruits become full Members after they have a Voting. If at least one-third of the active members in full standing voted and the recruit receives a majority of &quot;yes" votes from those voting then the recruit is promoted to a member in full standing, assuming no one gives a strong reason why the recruit should not be promoted. In such a case promotion will be decided by the Council after careful review. After review the recruit may be asked to leave, be promoted to full member, or kept on in &quot;recruit&quot; status until such time as the Council has enough information to make final dispensation.&nbsp; At the end of the 30th day (3am ET) voting will open for the Recruit. Votes will be posted in the "Ballot Box" Forum.&nbsp; A link to the Lodestar Message boards can be found on the Lodestar homepage.&nbsp; At 8am the third day an Elder will check the forum and tally the votes.&nbsp; If for some reason a person will be out of town (i.e. Military or job) and unable to vote in the aforementioned time frame they can vote early.&nbsp; Predated votes must be sent to Lodestarvotes@yahoo.com with the following subject line:<br><br>Example:<br>Subject: Recruit Tahlia predate voting<br><br><br></font><font face="Arial" color=#ffffff size=3><B>V. BEHAVIOR<br></B></font><font face="Arial" color=#ffffff size=2><br>Abusive or foul language will not be tolerated. We understand that each person has their own perceptions about what is considered offensive but in an effort to promote the most non-offensive environment, we respectfully ask that all members refrain from perpetually using foul language. Try to keep all chat channels at a PG rating. In addition, we ask that you refrain from using derogatory phrases used to refer to ones racial, religious, or sexual preferences. Intentional misspellings of obscenities (such as "bitz" instead of "bitch") will be treated as if there were no misspellings. We take this rule seriously and repeated violations of this request may lead to guild removal. Notable exceptions would include words such as "damn," "hell," and "bastard," and may include other words on a case-by-case basis. If you have any questions about what is and isn&#39;t appropriate, please ask an Elder before using it in guild chat.<br><br>Do not humiliate a fellow guild mate or any other player in the game of EQ. It is safe to say that if you wouldn&#39;t want someone to treat your mother or father this way then you shouldn&#39;t do it to someone else. No one should be unfairly harsh to another guild mate under any circumstances. Regardless of your personal feelings towards someone, you should try to act with respect. There are three sides to every story: your side, their side and the truth.<br><br>Be aware at all times that you bear the name of your guild wherever you go! Remember that your actions reflect upon all other guild members. Anyone caught purposefully violating EverQuest's Terms of Service, kill stealing, training, or other antisocial behavior may be removed from the guild.<br><br>Since all members are proud of our guild we ask that if you choose to mask your character information and location you use the /roleplay command instead of the /anonymous command, since the former will display our guild name, and your name will show up when members use the "/who all GUILD" command. Retaining your guild tag at all times is not mandatory, HOWEVER, if you are /anon in perpetuity, an Officer or Elder may inquire as to the reasons.<br></font><font face="Arial" color=#ffffff size=3><B><br>VI. GUILD MESSAGE BOARD &amp; WEB PAGE<br></B></font><font face="Arial" color=#ffffff size=2><br>It is important that you visit our web site periodically as a lot of guild information including this charter can be found there. Our website can be found at www.eq-lodestar.com. Our message board is a critical means of communication within the guild and the primary and reliable way to contact other members. As a member of the guild, we require that all members read the official guild message board at least once a week. We understand that real life takes precedence in all things but communication is essential to friendship and our guild is built on friendship and thus built on communication. We recommend that you read the board a minimum of two times a week. Please be aware of the proper message board protocols, which match guild chat guidelines.<br></font><font face="Arial" color=#ffffff size=3><B><br>VII. OTHER GUILDS<br></B></font><font face="Arial" color=#ffffff size=2><br>Please respect all other guilds by being cordial, polite, and follow the basic rules of etiquette on the Zebuxoruk server. If you are in a conflict with another player that is anonymous, check to see if they are a member of a guild (via the /guildstatus player_name command). Remember that you represent Lodestar as long as you are a member; so if the matter might affect relations with another guild, please report it to an Officer as soon as possible. If no Officer is available, remove yourself from the situation and contact an Officer as soon as possible with an explanation.<br></font><font face="Arial" color=#ffffff size=3><B><br>VIII. RESIGNATION &amp; RETURN POLICY<br></B></font><font face="Arial" color=#ffffff size=2><br>If you wish to retire from the guild, for any reason, contact an Elder or Officer in game or in email first to explain why you are leaving before you make such information known to the guild membership at large. If you wish to resign from the guild you will be given a 30-day grace period during which time you will have the option to reconsider. During this time you will be on a &quot;Leave of Absence&quot; status. If, at the end of the 30-day period, you feel you still wish to leave, your resignation will be fully accepted and your name will be removed from our Membership. If you wish to re-instate yourself at the end of the LOA period, the Council will have to vote to reaccept you into full membership. You may not sponsor recruits while on LOA. LOA status will not be granted if you have joined another guild. There is one exception to this, joining a guild to be a part of a Raid and ease of a chat channel.<br><br>The Leave of Absence period covers only those removals where the member informs the Officer that the LOA will be taken. If you do a &quot;/guildremove&quot; without first contacting an Officer, you are considered to have thought about this in great detail already and have no intentions of returning to the guild. It is unlikely that the Council will look favorably upon accepting members that quit the guild in this manner, however each situation will be dealt with on an individual basis.<br></font><font face="Arial" color=#ffffff size=2><B><br></B></font><font face="Arial" color=#ffffff size=3><B>IX. LOOT POLICIES<br></B></font><font face="Arial" color=#ffffff size=2><br>The guild has no formal loot policies but does offer the following suggestions:<br><br>In the spirit of friendship, we recommend a &quot;need before greed&quot; sort of policy. This means that if an item becomes available we encourage that the members at large will distribute them according to members that can use them effectively. We ask that when you have spare items you no longer need that you try to find a reasonable and fair way to make them available to your guild mates first. This does not mean that you must give a valuable item to your guild mate instead of selling it for profit. Instead we would appreciate you giving your guild mates a first opportunity to purchase it and possibly even consider collecting less money or items in trade in exchange for the unique friendship that you have with your guild mates. <br><br>Occasionally, there will be raids or hunts organized by guild members. We leave the distribution of loot up to the raid/hunt coordinator and the loot rules should be posted prior to the raid&#39;s execution. We strongly encourage either a &quot;pure dictatorship done by the raid coordinator with input from the Officers and Members&quot; or a &quot;totally random distribution based on those that can use the item according to the equip list on the item.&quot; <br><br>Regardless of the above rules, the person who wins or is given the item will OWN it. What a member does with any loot is their business, although we hope that they will consider the guild as a whole if they decide they no longer have a use for it, as mentioned previously.<br></font><font face="Arial" color=#ffffff size=2><B><br></B></font><font face="Arial" color=#ffffff size=3><B>X. DISBANDING THE GUILD<br></B></font><font face="Arial" color=#ffffff size=2><br>The guild will only disband with the unanimous vote of the Elders. If any Elder chooses to step down, the retiring Elder will recommend a replacement to be voted on by the remaining Elders with input from the guild.<br><br>Last Updated on: 02/25/02<br></font>
