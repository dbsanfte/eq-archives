        Today's patch was primarily comprised of server-side changes in preparation 
        for the release of EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark. Only one gameplay-affecting 
        issue was updated as a result of this patch: 
      <p> - Being killed by another player in a duel will now cause you to re-spawn 
        with zero mana. 
      <p> This change was implemented to counter a strategy used by casters where 
        they would duel to reduce downtime between fights, thus allowing groups 
        to engage creatures that they normally would not be able to.

      <p> <b>Player</b>: I've heard rumors that two new teleport spells were introuduced 
        in this patch. One is to Everfrost and the other to Innothe Swamp. Does

        Abashi commented on a players idea of adding more bolt spells to the wizard 
        class. This was found in the newgroup alt.games.everquest 
      <p><b>Player:</b> So, as a suggestion to GZ/Brad, if you were trying to 
        think of a simple way to add a few new goodies to the Wiz class, how about 
        a new Bolt spell every other level or so (16,24,29,etc...). Not too unbalancing 
        I'm sure - and everyone likes new spells to play with. 
      <p><b>Abashi:</b> Bolt spells aren't what the wizard does, that is the realm 
        of the Magician, as decided back in beta. I imagine that that particular 
        spell wasn't removed because its not that big of a deal at 16. The same 
        is true with O'kiels Radiation.

        Greetings from Vaslin Slickfinger of EqCaster! <br>
        I have released version 2.0 of EqCaster for your approval! It now has 
        the ability for you to compare spell files to see exactly what was changed. 
        For example, the latest patch has a lot more changes than were announced!! 
      <ul>
        <li>Paladins Lay Hands for 32 points per level instead of 27. That's a 
          whopping 300 points more at level 60! </li>
        <li>Swamp Port for teleporting to Innuthule Swamp </li>
        <li>Frost Port for teleporting to Everfrost Peaks </li>
        <li>Many, many new Shaman potions </li>
        <li>Divine Barrier for Clerics (L29) now has a much higher damage shield 
        </li>
        <li>Skin like Nature does not show the regeneration restoration! </li>
        <li>Shauri's Sonorous Clouding does have See Invisible! </li>
        <li>Bard spells do have a higher Area of Effect range </li>
        <li>Burnout III has a higher attack speed </li>
        <li>Dyn's Dizzying Draught is greatly increased with a lot of new effects 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>And much much more!! Download your latest copy at <a href="http://www.eqcaster.com" target="_blank">www.eqcaster.com</a> 
        <br>
        And of course, the disclaimer: Please remember, that EqCaster may interpret 
        the data incorrectly on some spells, so do not take this as a definitive 
        resource. Use your own judgement and test the spells out for yourself! 
        This is a major spoiler and can ruin some of the fun that EQ has for you.

        Just when Cinius' e-mail box started slowing down, he does it again. This 
        time, Cinius Shade explores the meaning and proper use of Area Effect 
        spells. For all of you wizards out there afraid of casting those AoE's

        I need to make you all aware that the link to purchase Ruins of Kunark, 
        will get you both the Everquest CD and the Ruins of Kunark all in one 
        package. If you own Everquest now, do not buy it from that link (yes.. 
        I would have got a cut from the sales, but I don't want to have any of 
        you shell out any more coin than needed for the expansion). This is from 
        the official Everquest website concerning the matter: 
      <ul>
        <li>All existing EverQuest customers will be given the opportunity to 
          upgrade to the Expansion directly (via the Login server) and at a discounted 
          upgrade-only rate. This opportunity will most likely happen during the 
          month of April, prior to launch. The upgrade package will include an 
          upgrade CD-ROM and a new world map. <br>
          IMPORTANT: The retail EverQuest box will be replaced with a new box 
          that will include both EverQuest and the Expansion. You may have already 
          begun to see advertisements for this box at a regular retail price. 
          If you are already an existing EverQuest customer you do NOT need to 
          purchase the box at retail -- you will be given an opportunity to buy 
          an upgrade only package directly and at a discounted price. <br>
          Pricing for the upgrade will be announced shortly. </li>

        You are Cordially Invited To the marriage of Cynara Quey of Freeport to 
        Datal Ephialtes of Neriak.<br>
        We would like to announce the bonding between two souls, Cynara Quey and 
        Datal Ephialtes. Cynara being a Priestess of Love and Datal a Warrior 
        of Honor. At long last we are to be married and we invite all of you to 
        share in our happiness! Our ceremony will take place on the 19th of February 
        at 9:00 P.M EST. It is upon the shores of the lovely lake in the Western 
        Commonlands that the ceremony will take place. 
      <p>Note from Cynara: <br>
        It seemed an eternity ago that I first encountered the man that is to 
        be my husband. He was the fearless warrior, the man leading the Teir’dal 
        assault upon Faydwer, leading his people into battle to reclaim a child 
        stolen from them. I was taken by his bravery, such valor this one had. 
        Mithaniel Marr himself would have smiled. Erollisi must have smiled as 
        well for the Love I felt for him. 
      <p>Note from Datal: <br>
        When I first met Cynara she was just another human. One who protected 
        a Teir`Dal child named Sazami. I never imagined I could love another after 
        the things that have happened to me in the past, but alas I have. I owe 
        it all to the small child Sazami, for bringing her to me and allowing 
        me to see that one can still care for another even after one has been 
        hurt and betrayed by some.

        This time it is fairly well optimized. The mobs from the newbie zone have

        a second entrance to what seems to be an underwater entrance to 'The Hole',

        <i>&quot;I just wanted to make a comment on the new resistance we get 
        when we hit lvl 35. You will probably not notice a difference when fighting 
        mobs a few lvl above you, but you will when trying to cast many lvl above. 
        At lvl 35 I was given an invite to camp the Arch Magi in LGuk, when he 
        popped I tried casting on him he resisted everything. Well I was determined 
        to get am SMR (Shiney Metalic Robe) and stayed all the way through lvl 
        35 into lvl 36. Well when i first cast in the Magi at lvl 36 I hot for 
        full damage at my lvl (and plz remember this mob is lvl 45 so that 9 levels 
        above mine). <br>
        It was a shock on how well the lowered resistance was working :). Well 
        thanks to the new resistance cap and some very nice ppl I was able to 
        camp my SMR and become the lowest lvl to camp and earn it. <br>

        <i>&quot;Hello...I am writing to you about a warning to all wizard players. 
        Last night I was fightining Seafurie Cyclopses in OOT with 2 other friends, 
        and we sadly got trained with 4, so I memorized Evac to Gfay and casted 
        it, now here the wierd thing....yah i know theres a slim chance that other 
        people might not be taken with the portal....but I, the wizard, wasnt 
        transported by the spell that *I* casted. So think twice and try to cast 
        a regular portal just to be sure that you make it alive yourself. <br>
        I spoke to a couple of GMs, one said there is a chance that the caster 
        might make it, and the other one said he/she would have to check the logs 
        to be sure about the portal collapsing on me (I think he/she though i 
        was lieing), but the lead GM was off on Sundays and Mondays, so I just 
        took the exp loss rather than waiting for him to check the logs on Tuesday. 
        So becareful!-<br>

        Some of you may have heard about this already, but if not.. it needs to 
        be told. Monday morning, many headed into Fear to do the normal routine 
        of battle. Now on Xegony, before any of what I am about to tell you happened, 
        there was only one (1) Carmine Robe on the entire server. That robe was 
        won on a roll by Lindiien Lightbringer and you can actually find his picture 
        on this site of him adorning it with pride. Now Monday's battles in Fear 
        begin and a Carmine Robe drops. The fair thing happens and Cabar wins 
        the lotto. Much to everyone's suprise, another wizard runs up, loots, 
        and gates out. I'm going to leave this person's name out because including 
        it isn't my style. If you want to find out who it was.. I'm sure you know 
        the proper channels to do so (no, that doesn't include e-mailing me *smile*). 
        Now the person that did this does claim he did it so it didn't decay, 
        but everyone there knows what their own eyes saw.<br>
        Now I didn't write this to further reduce the reputation of the person, 
        I wrote it to show everyone how small these little worlds called servers 
        we play upon are. Much like the community you live in now.. do something 
        wrong and you better try your hardest to correct the issue or live your 
        remaining days alone. As for Cabar, I know we don't talk on a regular 
        basis, but I know you to be a good wizard and well liked upon our server. 
        If there is anything I can help you with, call upon me.<br>

        Test Server:<br>
        Testing has begun on the new loot message when in a party. No longer will 
        someone loot 10 platinum worth of money and equipment and say they received 
        a rusty sword and some copper. Currently, a blue message is shown that 
        reads as: <br>
        <b>[Playername] loots an [item] </b><br>
        If you wizards are anything like me, you don't get much loot unless you 
        have very considerate group members. Most of us do our work and just drop 
        to meditate immediately. This is a huge improvement in the game and I 
        cannot wait for it to be implemented on the live servers.<br>

        I had a few people ask me how I looked at the data files for the spell 
        listings. Well, I actually had to use a program called SoftICE.. but the 
        info it gives is really ugly if you don't understand hexidecimal figures. 
        If you want to make things easy for you but don't care for all of that 
        mumbo jumbo that debuggers present, I suggest downloading <a href="http://www.eqcaster.com" target="_blank">EQ 
        Caster</a>. Keep in mind that the values shown by these programs may not 
        always be correct. Many times I see people using the data given by such 
        programs to try to go head to head with Verant on the different message 
        boards spread around. Not a wise decision because many, many things happen 
        on the server end that we do not see. It also just so happens that today, 
        EQ Caster has just implented many new upgrades and changes to the program:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Replaced the double-click tree with buttons. Much easier to use. </li>
        <li>MUCH faster loading times </li>
        <li>100+ spells have been updated! </li>
        <li>All teleportation spells now include zones. Including Kunark </li>
        <li>Resurrection experience restoration included. </li>
        <li>All pet information updated. Including necromancer skeleton levels. 
        </li>

        WHAT: Festival <br>
        WHERE: Qeynos Hills on Tunare server <br>
        WHO: Abjurators Anoymous <br>
        WHEN: Friday, Feb 4, 2000 @ 6:00 PM Mountain Time (7PM Central, 8PM East, 
        5PM Pacific)</p>
      <p>Abjurators Anonymous is having their first ever guild festival in celebration 
        of their100 member mark! Here are a few events we plan to have... Find 
        the dead! Here are the rules... One unlucky character named Arcanine is 
        going to DIE in several places all over the Qeynos Hills Area. The members 
        who wish to play this game must pay 5pp to join, and come to the North 
        Qeynos Zone. Once everyone is in N. Qeynos, Arcanine will zone in and 
        give them all consent to loot his corpse. Everyone will zone into Qeynos 
        Hills and begin to run madly around looking for the corpses which will 
        be looted for prizes and money! (Kind of like an easter egg hunt, but 
        with human flesh instead of boiled egg) All members must be in the North 
        Qeynos zone to play, latecomers will most likely not be let in. If any 
        member zones before everyone has consent, it will be considered cheating 
        and they will be disqualified with no refunds, with possible risk of loss 
        of guild membership. Don't cheat. :) </p>
      <p>Lottery! The rules for the lottery are simple. To enter the lottery, 
        you must buy a "ticket" for 5pp. You can buy asmany tickets as you wish. 
        Each player who enters will be given a number for their ticket, and then 
        the ticketmaster will use the /random command. The grand prize winner 
        will receive a Staff of Writhing! The first prize will be a Flowing Black 
        Robe! The second prize will be 40% of the lottery money, and the third 
        prize will be 25% of the money! (You can't win twice, sorry.) </p>
      <p>Duels! Duels will be held in Qeynos Hills near the undead runes. Both 
        players will pay 'x'amount of pp to the referee (depending on how much 
        they have to spend). When both players accept the challenge, the duel 
        will begin. When the battle is over, the ref will give the victor his 
        money and his challengers money. (Challengers should generally be within 
        2 levels of each other) This event should last no more than an hour. </p>
      <p>Drunken Brawls! Drunken Brawls will be just a bit different. *grin* The 
        players will be given 5 or 6 of their favorite alcoholic beverages. Once 
        the players are good and drunk, the players will give some plat to the 
        ref. The battle will commence once both players shed their weapons into 
        their backpacks. The opponents will fight hand to hand with no ability 
        to cast spells. After the brawl has been fought, the victor will be given 
        their money, and also their opponents money. (Booze compliments of Ceenla 
        and Ibzen)</p>
      <p>Tailoring! Raw Silk will be made by Ibzen for all of those who need some 
        fairly good caster armor! Just bring him the spider (not spiderling) silk, 
        and he'll make you some fancy clothes to show off.</p>
      <p>Jewelry Making! Karshek, a jewelrer at (97), along with a couple other 
        jewelrers will be open to making jewelry for all those who need it. Just 
        supply the metal and gem, and he'll make you virtually any silver or electrum 
        jewelry you can think of! Might I recommend the Silver Rose Engangement 
        Rings, and Silver Jaded Rings. Jaded Electrum Bracers are also great.</p>
      <p>Language Trading! Know a language? Teach it to a friend.</p>
      <p>Wedding of Iueanea and Raianu! 2 of our newest members are currently 
        engaged, and they're historic marriage may be one of the guildevents at 
        this party! Good luck u2!</p>
      <p>There will be ALL these events and more! Some events may be subject to 
        slight change, but this is kind of the plan. :) See you on the 4th! Power 
        to the casters! <br>

        After medding up, healing, and listening to the 3 Orcs shout for all non-Orcs 
        to flee or die, I was invited to help some old Druid friends kick their 
        Orc behinds (No I have not been Power-Leveling, I just play WAY too much 
        - 19 days playing in the 70 calendar days I have had the game). We attacked 
        these Orcs (I did not con them, everything in there should be green to 
        me). I kept casting Leatherskin to reduce interrupts, nuked away and we 
        had one almost dead. Suddenly I was zoning, with an almost-full health 
        bar! LOL I thought I was dying and lagged. <br>
        Anyhow, I popped up in BB with a message on my screen that said "You Have 
        Been Summoned By The Gods!" And there was a LVL 50 standing there, (not 
        tagged as a GM) who I recognized as a GM, nevertheless.<br>
        It was cool being summoned, but I still would have rather they just gave 
        me a tell to quit it and let them play, at least I could have watched. 
        The 2 druids whooped them all anyway. :)<font size="1">&quot;</font></i><font size="1"><br>

        Set 4:<br>
        Chron X announces Expansion Set 4, "Whiteout". Check it out at <a href="http://www.station.sony.com/chronx" target="_blank">http://www.station.sony.com/chronx</a><br>
        - Whiteout includes 74 new cards which fully compliment the latest battleground, 
        "Antarctica". Whiteout introduces a new keyword, "Arctic", on some assets. 
        These assets, like the existing Mawson assets, do not suffer from the 
        usual penalties associated with the Antarctica map - they do not take 
        damage if unprotected by a base and they do not have their firepower reduced. 
        Arctic assets are more expensive to move, but a whole range of decks specialized 
        to the Antarctica map can be built around these assets. With their immunity 
        to cold, they will be able to survive in an enemy's Headquarters city, 
        where a non-Arctic defender will not have the firepower to dislodge them. 
        Because of their higher movement costs, Arctic assets are less likely 
        to be seen on other maps, with one exception. Whiteout introduces the 
        Freak Blizzard intervention. With this in play, anyone can create "blizzard" 
        conditions in any city on any map. The result is the same as a city on 
        the Antarctica map. Imagine the enemy's surprise when his assets suddenly 
        start freezing to death in the Pacific!<br>
        - Whiteout also introduces a powerful new enhancement, "Double Agent". 
        Double Agent can be used on your own assets to untap them. It's the only 
        non-program that can do so, but you run the risk of the card being used 
        against you next turn.<br>
        - Take advantage of the new Player Referral program to get FREE cards! 
        For every registered player you refer you receive a FREE 15-card Booster 
        Pack from Chron X.<br>

        I have added a search engine to the site. Keep in mind that it will not 
        search the message boards. I opted to do this to keep the database to 
        a decent size (faster searches) and the message boards have thier own 
        search capabilities as well. You can find the search form in the table 
        of contents to the left side of your screen. Can't see it? Scroll down 
        a bit or increase your viewable area to 1024x768. Enjoy!<br>

        <i>&quot;...I have came up with a working idea to retrieve the "spokes"

        we know that wolf form works .. well so does the "Ball of golem clay" 
        I had the pleasure of obtaining my rod in Eruds cross unscathed, using 
        one of those potions. I also heard (not actually tested), that "camoflage" 
        works on the undead shark. Be well ... <br>

        jump in thinking you are totally safe. Every day I get at least one e-mail

        see through invisibility.. well those of you that have been mauled to 
        death know different and that is why I leave the warnings all over the
