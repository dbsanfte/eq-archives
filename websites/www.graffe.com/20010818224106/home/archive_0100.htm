      Discussion from alt.games.everquest:<br>
      <b>Player</b>: I have an SB Live with the latest drivers. Luckily the crashes 
      have stopped but I've noticed a difference in the 3D effects. I noticed 
      my rear speakers are a lot more active. If someone casts a spell behind 
      me only the rear speakers emit the sound. Before you could still here it 
      in the front speakers. Also the ambient sounds are louder. Anyone else notice 
      this? This may be why some people do not hear wolf howls anymore...perhaps 
      they don't have rear speakers? I still hear the wolves. 
      <p align="left"><b>Brad</b>: Actually, that was our original plan. We were 
        working with Creative on using SB Live cards much more effectively, but 
        some code was checked in prematurely and we got some crash bugs :( Our 
        goal was (and is) to use the four speaker sound more effectively, use 
        reverb in caves and such, etc. - Brad<br>

        It's seems that the website that hosts www.keithparkinson.com has been 
        shut down. I'm not sure if it is from the extra strain I may have caused 
        with the link in Saturday's news (I sure hope not and that is somewhat 
        doubtful). I have been a fan of his artwork long before Everquest came 
        around so I know the URL is correct. Give it a few days and try again 
        if you wished to view his site and artwork.<br>

        Well, just as I said in the news a few days ago<font size="1">,</font> 
        <i>&quot;I only pray whatever tweaks they did to the code do not get erased 
        with the next patch&quot;</i>, looks like it happened. What started to 
        be the best sounding experience in my Norrathian life, is now driving 
        me batty. It seems that the sound realism cannot be adjusted and is stuck 
        on full throttle. Get next to the ocean and it sounds like the high-school 
        bully just flushed your head in the toilet.. run through West Commonlands 
        and it sounds like you have a parrot and 1000 crickets in your front pocket. 
        I'll poke around and see if the boys and girls at Verant are working on 
        a solution.<font size="1"> <br>

        of Air?:<br>
        Many seem to think the Plane of Air is really for the expansion. The zone 
        is mainly composed of red mobs although yellows and blues are scattered 
        about. Reports of really bad trains and the such. So it seems that this 
        Plane will be for the expansion once everyone is able to level a bit further 
        than the current maximum of 50. Dregen Darklithim of Fennin Ro sent in 
        two pics just to give you an idea of how hard things hit. (note: Dregen 
        even claims that a friend was punched by a Gnome for 1200+ points of damage..

      <p><img src="purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="9">Wizard Patch Changes:<br>
        The changes to Wizards mean that for any Wizard above Level 35 they get 
        a lower chance of their Cold, Fire, or Magic spells being resisted. In 
        reality their spells are basically given a built in "debuff" factor. This 
        stacks with any other debuff, such as Tashania, Malosi or Temperate Flux 
        and gives Wizards much better combat effectiveness. It is not a duration 
        debuff. It does not mean when you cast a DD spell the mobs resistance 
        is lowered for other casters in the group. What the tweak does is when 
        a DD spell is cast it looks at the current resistance of the target, and 
        then the new tweak reduces that resistance amount further, then uses that 
        new reduced resistance within the game formula to determine if the spell 
        lands, or is partially or fully resisted. This process is done each and 
        every time you cast a spell which is enchanced by the new code. Wizards 
        should now notice the following with these types of spells now:·Green 
        Mobs: Rarely Resited ·Blue Mobs: Rarely Resited ·White Mobs: Much Lower 
        Resistance ·Yellow Mobs: Much Lower Resistance ·Light Reds: You will now 
        have a much better chance against these mobs. ·Deep Reds: Regular Resistance, 
        with a slight chance of the "debuff factor" assisting. This tweak for 
        Wizards doesn't change the 6 level cap. It simply makes general combat 
        much easier for the Wizard Class. They should be able to use more powerful 
        spells with less resists on mobs that would be resisted by most other 
        members of the party. It should help to keep the Wizard the true masters 
        of direct damage spells.<br>

      <p><img src="purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="9">Patch Message:<br>
        The patch wasn't large (took about 30 seconds on DSL) but a lot of things 
        have been updated and added to the game. I'll post what is directly effected 
        to us as wizards here:</p>
      <p> The Plane of Sky is now open!!! As a reminder to our customers, the 
        alternate planes of reality do not necessarily follow the same physical 
        or ethereal rules as Norrath proper. Enjoy!</p>
      <p>- Casting times have been implemented on several activatable items. This 
        was done to correct issues that could arise from people chain-casting 
        these items.</p>
      <p>*Spell Changes*<br>
        - All Wizard AoE damage and stun spells have had their radius slightly 
        increased<br>
        - Yonder will now interact better with levitate.<br>
        - NPCs will now treat the "Cancel Magic" series of spells as hostile. 
        Previously, NPCs did not mind if players dispelled all of their buffs 
        before attacking. Now they will.</p>
      <p>*Levitation Changed* <br>
        Due to the implementation of casting times on activatable items, the code 
        that disallowed refreshing of the Levitation spell while it was active 
        is no longer necessary and has been backed out. The Levitate spell may 
        now be refreshed while the spell is in use. </p>
      <p>*Quest and Items*<br>
        - We have changed the reward of a newbie quest in the Qeynos area from 
        a level 49 scroll to a level 1 scroll. The issuance of a level 49 scroll 
        was a typo in the quest data, allowing new characters to amass an abnormally 
        large amount of currency.</p>
      <p>*Paw* <br>
        The difficulty of Paw has been decreased. We found that many of the gnolls 
        in the new Paw had too many hitpoints, making the dungeon more difficult 
        than it should have been for the desired level target. Please let us know 
        how this change affects the viability of the dungeon.</p>
      <p>*The Plane of Fear* <br>
        The item-drop percentages in the Plane of Fear have been increased. This 
        change was supposed to have occurred in the last patch, however the data 
        was not exported. It has been tested and equipment drops are now occurring 
        at a much higher rate.</p>
      <p>*The Plane of Hate*<br>
        The item-drop percentages on roaming and fast-spawning NPCs in the Plane 
        of Hate have been decreased. Previously, these NPCs used the same drop-percentages 
        as the slow-spawning NPCs, causing overall drop percentages to be extremely 
        high. Also, the inhabitants of the Plane of Hate no longer fall for illusions, 
        and tend to "Hate" everyone. </p>
      <p>*Wizard Enhancement*<br>
        Level 35 or above wizards will find that their spells (Magic, Cold, or 
        Fire) much less likely to be resisted. This effect stacks with the Staff 
        of Temperate Flux and enchanter, shaman, and magician resistance debuffs. 
        <br>
        This change was made to increase the effectiveness of wizards at about 
        the level that all spell-casting classes start seeing their resistance 
        rates go up. Wizards specialize in direct magical damage. It makes sense 
        that they should be better at causing that damage than the other classes. 
      </p>
      <p>*Manastone Changed* <br>
        The players have raised many concerns about the power of the Manastone, 
        which no longer drops. They cite that people without a Manastone are not 
        as welcome in expeditions to the outer planes and other areas as people 
        with them. Since dropping additional Manastones via quest or removing 
        them from the existing populace is not desirable, we've decided to make 
        it so that the Manastone will no longer function in the alternate planes. 
        Furthermore, it will not function in any of the zones included with the

        Rumors (only rumors) say that tomorrow's patch will be one of considerable 
        size... much larger than any other patch we have downloaded yet. If this 
        is correct, you may wish to run home tomorrow at lunch or fire it off 
        before you head to work/school and start the download so that you can 
        play when you get home. I'll try to find out just how big tomorrow's patch

        I'm simply amazed. Last nights message says that the patch will be going 
        in not on Wednesday but will be started at 7am on Thursday morning. The 
        reason I am amazed is that it is going to be on a day that I actually 
        work. It never fails that the big patches always seem to hit on days that 
        I have all day to play (therefore not letting me play due to the patch 
        and after consequences that usually double their expected time). Keep 
        your fingers crossed that our patch to help us in group makes it in tomorrows

        Apparently the changes to Fear were not witnessed across all the servers. 
        On Mith Marr there are still only about 4 fingers and the drop rate was 
        horrible tonight, maybe 2% and that's being generous. I'm glad to hear

        WIZARDS REJOICE ONE AND ALL! Lindiien Lightbringer here, Xegony server 
        i am here to sell you wizards no longer get the shaft when it comes to 
        plane of fear armor. Before yesterday there were only 3 frightfingers 
        in the zone with about a 5% chance of dropping carmine. Sunday, on xegony, 
        i organized and broke the plane of fear and was pleasantly surprised. 
        the changes i noticed are as follows <br>
        1- a LOT more roamers which means fear is harder to break. <br>
        2- the previous samhain tower has had samhains replaced with frightfingers 
        while the old frightfinger house still has frightfingers. This means that 
        instead of 3 fingers in the zone we now have 6. <br>
        Plus on tuedsay the drop rate in fear will be changed from5% to match 
        the 15% drop rate of fear. <br>

          <br>
          4- Sowing - Will be provided for those hours that we are there. <br>
          <br>
          The next series of services that we will provide are trade skill services 
          that have many contingencies to them since they are volatile in performance. 
          Note that these services ARE NOT 100% GUARANTEED. There will be failures. 
          All materials that are required to perform these services are to be 
          provided by the individual requesting the service.<br>
          <br>
          5- Fletching - Free fletching serviced will be provided from a master

          7- Research - Free research will be provided from a wizard with a ******180***** 
          skill in research. Although this isn't the maximum skill, it might be

          I had a short talk with GZ yesterday concerning our class as Wizards 
          and the state of all of the petitions and such that are going around. 
          Near the end of our talk, he said, &quot;I do have something coming 
          in for wizards this patch - we will have to see what they think&quot;. 
          Now don't go getting your hopes up thinking we will become the all powerful 
          class within Norrath because that will never happen... that is a balance 
          issue. I'm sure it will be a small tweak, but none the less, it's something.

          a little bit of common sense here:<br>
          <i>&quot;I have noticed a trend in current GM events. When players can 
          not figure out what a GM controlled NPC wants, they turn on him and 
          want to kill him, gathering up as many people in the zone as possible 
          to try and pound the NPC into dust. On my server today, Quellious, there 
          were several tiny Sand Giants that had appeared and wanted to play games 
          with the PCs nearbye. This was real fun at first, as we played tag, 
          got them Orcs to squish [they really enjoyed squishing things] and generally 
          roleplayed with us. I brought them some things to kill, gave them some 
          wine I was carrying, talked to them [with little response, as they were 
          being talked to be everyone] and tried to have a decent time. Then after 
          a bit some players got bored of this and wanted to get items from the 
          little giants, since they were not giving them away, they tried to take 
          them by force. It was a futile effort at first as they could not muster 
          up enough dmg to make a different, but after a bit many many more people 
          joined and started to actually hurt the playful giants, a lot! The whole 
          time they were being attacked they asked us via shouts why were we attacking 
          them when all they wanted to do was to play? I tried to help the giants 
          while they were being attacked, but since I am a wizard there is very 
          little I can do to help other than try to get the giants out of there 
          [I gave them several warnings to run away so they would not have to 
          die]. After about 30 mins of solid combat, some of the PCs gave up and 
          the battle became somewhat light, this is where I was summoned to the 
          "lead" Sand Giant. At first I thought it was part of their games, cause 
          they did this before. [they would summon someone back and forth across 
          the zone and roleplay that they were having a game of catch with you 
          as the ball! :) ] After i tried to get away for the 6th or 7th time 
          and was resummoned back time and again, I sat down and smiled at him. 
          Then he gave me a Rubicite Helm! He said thank you for the games and 
          the help. About 10 mins after that all the playful Giants went away. 
          As far as I know I was one of the few people to get any item at all, 
          and I got it just because I was nice to them. Anyway, the point of this 
          email is that force is not always the way to get things, and when it 
          comes to GM events, listen to the GMs and try to play as best you can 
          with what it is they want to do. They are not looking for the perfect 
          role playing time, but rather just to see the ingenuity of people, and 
          to make others have a good time. Sorry this email is so huge bud, but 
          I feel this is something that people have to try an learn if they want 
          to participate in GM events and make them successful for all involved. 
          Have a safe journey. <br>

          the loss of the pulling team no lives were lost to the best of my knowledge. 
          <br>
          A great adventure was had by all in this storming of the plane of Hate, 
          though I am sure the dark god will rise in power once again to torment 
          the citizens of Norrath all to soon..... <br>

          Sit Out:<i><br>
          &quot;Hello everyone, I am here today to explain and to solve a problem 
          that has been on Everquest for a certain time regarding Wizards resist 
          cap. I as a felow wizard is tired of it. We wizards have to wait several 
          levels more than the other classes to get into groups that gives quite 
          good experience. This situation is unberable and is very frustrating 
          because it is just not fair for us wizards to have to wait for more 
          levels.<br>
          Exemple: 2 of my friends, Lvl 36 bard and lvl 37 warrior joined DT (Death 
          tower) in Lower guk a few days ago while i was gettin trhou my hell 
          lvl 35. Well they made it to 39 in DT in 2 days. Imagine my excitement 
          when i learned i was too low to get in DT group or even list because 
          the frog would resist too much. How does that make me fell, well useless 
          and frustrated about it. Now i have to go in a lower level group longer 
          than my 2 other friends.<br>
          How to settle this? Me and some friends a putin together a Sit-out for 
          wizards on the Mithaniel Marr server and hope some of the other server 
          will do the same. We are gonna sit as long as it takes to get thing 
          sort out. We will not tolerate this injustice. Now im leaving my E-mail 
          for people of the other servers to contact me so we will execute the 
          event at the same time and place. I hope you felow wizard will understand 
          and support us because you felow young wizard will get annoyed too. 
          imgaine a lvl 50 wizard not even capable of doing partial damage on 
          a Lvl 50 mob. And would really like it if other class would help them 
          out too in there Sit-out. <br>
          When? Im so tired of it im doing it soon. Lets say Wednesday January 
          5th by 8 pm eastern time at West Freeport at the West Gate. Create lvl 
          1 characters wizard or bring your own precious character with you. Thank 
          you for your time and please consider this the movement that will make 
          us wizards equal.&quot;</i><br>

          If you visit the message boards, you may have seen well written posts 
          by a Wizard named Cinius Shade of Mithaniel Marr. One of his posts even 
          made it into the <a href="../skills/skills.htm">Skills</a> part of the 
          website for <a href="../skills/manause/manause.htm">Mana Use</a> about 
          a week ago. With his mature attitude and well written editorials, I 
          knew he would make a great addition here to the website. So without 
          further adieu, I want to give a great welcome to Cinius Shade! Cinius

          of Solusek Ro sent word that the level 49 spell Super Nova may now only 
          hit 3 mobs (like most AE's) instead of ALL mobs like it used to. Where 
          he could normally take out LOTS of small mobs, he can now only hit 3. 
          How about you?</p>
