</div>Apple and Gucci very similar actually.  People willingly pay more to have something with that logo on it.   The Galaxy S3 by Samsung is a great phone,  currently considered superior to the iPhone,  However you can bet people will still buy the iPhone because its the iPhone and has the Apple logo.  I mean there is a reason the Apple logo lights up on their laptops and while all the iPhone cases have a circular cut out so everybody can see the Apple logo. Pretty much why a Gucci bag is covered in big stylized Gs(well I am guessing that is Gucci).</blockquote>

			Apple is ridiculously protective of its trademarks and patents. That much should be clear by now. The company will drag you to court if you so much have a single element in common with its own devices. One could argue that Apple was within their right to sue other electronic companies like Samsung, but their latest legal assault might be going a tad bit too far.<br />
<br />
Reuters is reporting that Apple is suing an online Polish grocery retailer named A.pl. The Web site’s name is an obvious pun on the word “apple.” Apples are a fruit and, as such, belong in a grocery store. Surely Apple wouldn’t be angry over a grocery store using a pun. They aren’t even in the same market.<br />
<br />
Apple says that the lawsuit isn’t about the name, but rather the logo. The company’s main logo isn’t infringing in the least, but their offshoot company, fresh24, may be the cause of the suit. <br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.graffe.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=1849"  title="Name:  
Views: 
Size:  ">Attachment 1849</a><br />
<br />
The logo does bear a resemblance to Apple’s iconic logo, but is it really worth a lawsuit? Apple says that A.pl is using its logo to attract customers. In essence, Apple says that a grocery store has copied its logo, which is associated with electronics, to sell fruits and vegetables.<br />
<br />
I don’t even know what to say about this so I’ll just let A.pl’s CEO Radoslaw Celinski take over:<br />
<br />
    “The accusation is ludicrous”. <br />
<br />
It’s so simple, yet gets the point across so well. Apple’s lawyers must have gone insane. Anything that even remotely resembles an apple (or a rectangle) is apparently fair game for the lawsuit happy lawyers over at Apple.<br />
<br />
Once again, it’s perfectly fine for a company to defend its trademark. Nobody would care if Apple was going after an electronics supplier that was using an Apple-like branding to sell their products, but this is a grocery store. I guess they could just change their logo to that of an orange or a pear, but the apple is most commonly recognized as the king of all fruits.<br />
<br />
Anyway, A.pl is currently reviewing the case being brought against them. It will probably reach the trial phase and A.pl will probably win. Apple’s legal escapades have not been met with the same kind of success that they have seen here in the U.S. If Apple does win, however, we can say goodbye to any kind of common sense that was left in the world.

</div>I'm curious, do you know if they reached a settlement with the private developers of Black Mesa (independent free remake of HL1 using the HL2 engine) or is that covered under the separate section of &quot;mod&quot; as some sort of exemption?</blockquote>

			Apple will reportedly request $3 billion in damages from Samsung for patent infringement, triple the amount initially awarded by a court.<br />
<br />
Attorneys for Apple plan to ask U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh to order Samsung to pay $3 billion after losing the recent patent suit between the two companies, reports the Korea Times. A hearing is set for Friday in which Apple will argue its case.<br />
<br />
In seeking triple the amount in damages, Apple would likely rely on a jury decision that found Samsung guilty of &quot;willfull infringement&quot; on five of the six patents in question. This decision meant the jury felt that Samsung knowingly violated Apple's patents.<br />
<br />
&quot;By using that condition, Apple has decided to request the judge to order Samsung to pay more than $3 billion in the hearing on the San Jose verdict on Sept. 21 in California,&quot; a legal source told the Korea Times.<br />
<br />
Judge Koh does have the power to triple the damages based on a ruling that finds Samsung willfully infringed on Apple's patents.<br />
<br />
The August 24 jury verdict found in favor of Apple in virtually all the decisions, awarding Apple damages of $1.05 billion. Samsung continues to face other challenges.<br />
<br />
On Monday, Koh denied Samsung's request to overturn a three-month-old U.S. ban on its Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet. But the judge cited a lack of jurisdiction in her ruling, so a permanent decision is still up in the air.<br />
<br />
The Galaxy Tab 10.1 was hit with a preliminary sales ban in June. A stipulation was added that the ban could be reversed if the jury found that Samsung did not infringe on Apple's D'889 tablet design patent. And that's exactly what the jury found last month. As a result, Samsung has argued that the ban should be removed.<br />
<br />
CNET contacted both Apple and Samsung for comment and will update the story when we receive further information.
