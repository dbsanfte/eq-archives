<HR>
Loremaster Borannin says, "Ahh yes, good to see you again Korteal. I wish it were under better circumstances that we meet today. For some time now we have sent teams of our finest rogues to gather intelligence for the Dain. Tanik Greskil is one of our best. He was recently sent into the heart of Kael Drakkel on a very important mission and has not returned. He is now long overdue, and fearing the worst, our wise council has asked me to dispatch a rescue party to determine what has become of him and return him to safety. I have decided to give you this opportunity to build upon the trust you have earned from the council. Will you accept this mission?" 
<HR>
<b>You say, "I will accept this mission." </b>
<HR>
Loremaster Borannin says, "The council will be pleased to hear of your acceptance, Korteal. Scour the regions surrounding the city of the Giants. Discover what happened to Tanik and, if possible, return him to Thurgadin. If you are successful, remember to hand me your woven shawl. We seem to be running low on them, but I must say Mordin has never had so much help in the kitchen. Anyway, I will eagerly await word of your findings. Good luck, and may Brell protect you." 
<HR>
<b>You say, "Hail, Tanik Greskil" </b>
<HR>
Tanik Greskil says, "Outlander! Thank Brell you've found me! I am the last surviving member of my unit. Our mission was somehow compromised, the bloody Kromrif knew just where to find us... I can't imagine how they knew. I was barely able to escape with my life and wandered into a trap here. I am badly hurt and need your help." 
<HR>
<b>You say, "I will help you." </b>
<HR>
Tanik Greskil says, "Quickly, give me a vial of Velium Vapors so I can return home, I am in desperate need of some attention from our clerics." 
<HR>
(Note: Tanik will despawn if you ask the next question in the conversation, so don't ask him about the Velium Vapors if you wish to give them to him at this point.) 
<HR>
<b>You say, "What are Velium Vapors?" </b>
<HR>
Tanik Greskil says, "Drat! Are you telling me you don't have one with you? Run back to Thurgadin at once and speak with Frundle, she can make you one. I will do what I can to stay alive. I may need to move about a bit to keep from being discovered. Hurry now outlander, you're my only hope." 
<HR>
<b>You say, 'Hail Frundle Frenkler' </b>
<HR>
<b>You say, 'What are Velium Vapors?' </b>
<HR>
Frundle Frenkler says, "Ahh, you come seeking my family recipe? After all you've done for our people it's the least I can do. First you must fashion a velium vial, then combine the vial with two small pieces of velium in this jar. That's all there is to it. Please keep the recipe a secret." 
<HR>
<b>You say, "What is a velium vial?" </b>
<HR>
Frundle Frenkler says "I'm no potter mind you, but if I remember correctly it's a small brick of velium, three crystalline silks, and two glass shards. Then you'll have to finish up by firing it in a kiln with a high quality firing sheet." 
<HR>
[Receive: Velium Purifier] 
<HR>
Combine in a Pottery Wheel: 1 Small Brick of Velium + 3 Crystalline Silks (unstacked) + 2 Glass Shards (unstacked) = Unfired Velium Vial. (trivial < 123) <BR>
Combine in a Kiln: Unfired Velium Vial + High Quality Firing Sheet = Veluim Vial. (trivial = 122) <BR>
Combine in Velium Purifier: 2 Small Pieces of Velium (unstacked) + Veluim Vial = Vial of Velium Vapors. (no-fail combine)
<HR>
[Give Tanik: Vial of Velium Vapors] 
<HR>
Tanik Greskil says "Thank you, Korteal. I shall be eternally grateful to you. Should you ever require my assistance I pledge to you my aid. Please deliver this to Borannin, it is imperative that he deliver this to the Dain at once. Farewell for now outlander...." 
<HR>
[Receive: Tanik's Note] 
<HR>
[Give Borannin: Tanik's Note & <a href="http://www.graffe.com/quests.php?id=56">Woven Coldain Prayer Shawl</a>] 
<HR>
Loremaster Borannin says "Words cannot express our gratitude for your deeds outlander, you have saved a hero of our people from certain death. Please accept this, the Fur-lined shawl, as a token of our sincere appreciation. You are indeed among the most highly regarded Barbarians to set foot in Thurgadin. The next time we meet be sure to ask me how to further advance your reputation with the coldain."
