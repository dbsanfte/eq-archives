    Pull with Atol's. You need the time on the snare and the resist bonus and 
    you don't want them after you at full speed.<br>
    <br>
    Pop traps invised, swarming beatles see invis though so avoid that trap 
    (second ramp corner)<br>
    <br>
    When a spider hits you that you weren't expecting, cast Atol's on it while 
    it is hitting you. Their melee range is such that they will start hitting 
    you while you are still out of the range of Atol's. I've only hit myself 
    with snare once doing this and I was dealing with multiple spiders at the 
    time (/hug exodus).<br>
    <br>
    The spiders proc a phase shift (Yonder) on you. This can be disorienting. If 
    you get confused, bail and try again. If you get ported mid-cast duck 
    immediately and recast. Getting phase shifted is counted as a (long) 
    movement so your cast is already blown. You can also get ported onto the 
    bones, which hold Dragon Construct traps. Dragon Constructs stay up for days 
    and like any dragonish thing, require melee range to cast on making them 
    essentially un-killable by you solo.<br>
    <br>
    The spiders are fairly resistant so you may have to snare several times. 
    This can be problematic with a full quad when you keep seeing one or two 
    resist messages. <br>
    <br>
    Even snared these things are fast. Run the lot of them back to the zone in 
    and in a big loop around it as you burn.<br>
    <br>
    Pathing when you pull is FUBAR (particularly past the first ramp) so watch 
    and make sure they are following, you may have to back track a bit. <br>

    NOTES:</span><ul>
      <li><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Sometimes drop 
      Phase Spider Blood (nice for non casters) and about every 30th one or so 
      drops a PSC.</span></li>
      <li><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">I do not 
      generally quad these intentionally, I go for two or three, and if I get an 
      add, snare it and quad then. They run fast, hit hard, proc yonder on you, 
      spring from traps, warp on you, warp unexpectedly in front of you while 
      pulling others, etc. Learn where the traps are so you can pop and pull 
      them.<br>
