<a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=10123">A Tsetsian Fly</a>. 
Level 46-48 Mob</p>
<p><i>AA XP per Quad at 56</i>: ~6%</p>
<p><i>Danger Rating</i>: Extremely High</p>
<p><i>Dangers</i>: Bards Swarm Kiting, Druids Charm-Kiting, Rangers Fear Kiting, 
Trains to zone returning to their spawn points, and adds.</p>
<p><i>Creature Dangers</i>: Rats have lots of HP, you can kill them, but will 
likely need to med-kite them.  Diseased Malarians. If one of these starts 
coming after you, don't think, just gate.  They summon (about 10 second 
delay), and hit for 475-500.  I believe they also assist anything else in 
the zone, so don't let your quad get too close.</p>
<p><i>Mana Required</i>: I would guess a mana pool of at least 3000 would be 
required, although with focus items you may be able to do it with less.  
With 3500, C3, and FT3 I am able to do these fine (I end up with 20-40% mana 
remaining), even if I have to take care of adds.  I would recommend Pillar 
of Lightning, or it will probably take too long to kill them.</p>
<p><i>Buffs</i>: Koadic's Endless Intellect, Spirit of Eagle, and a Rune (epic, 
or your self only skins will work fine).  First-timers may also want 
Aegolism/Virtue, Regrowth, and Focus.  When you get hit (and you will) they 
will do significant damage.</p>
<p><i>Additional Spells Required</i>: You will need to have some sort of root 
memorized, as well as Invisibility/Improved Invisibility and Gate/Abscond.</p>
<p><i>Other</i>: Make sure that when you stop, you turn left-right before 
casting.  Interrupts here slow down your kill time, and may force you to 
re-snare.</p>
<p><i>Details</i>:  Upon zoning into PoD, look north.  Run across the 
pond, and you will see the following spot of land</p>
<p><img border="0" src="http://www.nadiar.com/flyguide.jpg" width="400" height="389">(up is North)</p>
<p>The southern-most area, is almost always completely safe, however, you may 
wish to invisible before stepping away from your keyboard.  Trains in 
Planes of Disease are very common, and the path they take to return home may 
lead them through your previously safe area.</p>
<p>The following map shows area's that you want to avoid:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="http://www.nadiar.com/flyguideareas.jpg" width="400" height="389"></p>
<p>Avoid kiting in all area's marked red. The one on the far left is full of 
potential adds, and the others are full of bad pathing.  There isn't much 
worse than having a Fly decide it's going to take the scenic route, turning 
around and staring down the eyes of a very excited fly.</p>
<p>Green is a very easy place to kite them, and most rangers and druids will be 
willing to move to another area if you ask politely.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pulling:</p>
<p>Invis up run around them, make sure there are no potential adds nearby (make 
sure to run into the water and check there as well), and target the furthest one 
of the first group. Pull in the direction indicated:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="http://www.nadiar.com/flyguide1st.jpg" width="400" height="389"></p>
<p>This one is pretty easy, and is good for learning the pathing, and dangers.  
While there are only 3 of them, trust me, 3 is easily enough xp to make it worth 
killing them.</p>
<p>If you get an add, remember that controlling the add takes precedence over 
your quad! Root him and snare him before dealing with the quad.  Halfway 
through your quad, re-snare him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The next one can be a bit more difficult.  You will want to make extra 
sure there are no adds nearby, and then run out over the water to the south of 
them.  Target with your tstaff, and pull, then run back to land and wait 
for them.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="http://www.nadiar.com/flyguide2nd.jpg" width="400" height="389"></p>
<p>This one will probably get you smacked around more often then the other, 
because you cannot see all of them from any safe angle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The next one, and the last one I'm going to cover, is more difficult than the 
first, but not nearly as difficult as the second.  Again, its only 3, but 
the XP for even 3 is sufficient.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Don't feel bad if it doesn't go as planned the first few attempts, it took me 
3 tries before I could get past the second group without dieing or needing to 
get a heal.  Mana regen is very important, and you may wish to grab a few 
other mana regen buffs (Protection of the Glades/Nine, Spiritual Purity, etc.) 
if you are often running low.</p></tr></td></table></body></html>
