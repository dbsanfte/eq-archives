				You'll finally be able to take your fiscal skills and pit them against like-minded mayors in Cities XL, as the latest iteration of the City Life series for the PC drifts into the realm of MMOs. <br />
<br />
I got a chance to look at an early build of Monte Cristo Games' city-builder title last week, and it looks to be shaping up quite nicely.<br />
<br />
The genre hasn't evolved much since Sim City established the basic rules: Plop down a few industrial, commercial and residential zones, sit around (or hit the fast-forward button) till they matriculate, collect taxes to buy a few roads, and zone more areas until you have the funds to keep the expansion process going. Eventually you'll establish a brimming metropolis, and maybe toss in a disaster or two to see how well your city-planning skills hold. <br />
<br />
City Life added social classes into the mix, each with their own particular needs and desires: The nouveau riche wouldn't be caught dead at a burger joint, while the average Joe or Jane could only afford to live in visually unappealing housing, and could only work at menial jobs in polluting industries. Toss in yuppies, hippies and other colorful civilian archetypes, and the aspiring mayor will find himself with a complex simulation game -- after all, you can't have a hospital unless you have high-income doctors to mend the patients, and low-income orderlies to mend the sheets.<br />
<br />
Cities XL hopes to perfect the stagnant city-builder genre, bringing the art of micromanagement to extremes. <br />
<br />
If serving as lord over a bunch of digital vassals is your thing, Cities XL attempts to grant you an unprecedented amount of control over every nook and cranny of your modern kingdom. Buildings can be zoned out in the traditional method, or you can select a particular structure by keyword (large, low-income residential only, for example) and plop individual structures down one by one. Zoom in a bit -- the camera goes from hovering at satellite level all the way down to a citizen's backyard -- and see people play soccer, sit in traffic or go about their workdays with the eerie feeling that they're being watched.   <br />
<br />
You can shape neighborhoods any way you please. If you're a fan of tidiness, you can use the traditional grid system, placing roads at right angles. Or you can leave your helpless populace to navigate a maddening, yet visually appealing, series of twists and turns. <br />
<br />
Add pedestrian-only thoroughfares to cut down on noise pollution in quiet neighborhoods, tack a few bus-only lanes onto your four-lane highway to convince people to use public transportation, establish bike paths to please those environmentally conscious hipsters who want to pedal to work ... and then juggle the nightmarish levels of traffic and disgruntled commuters who want nothing to do with the convoluted asphalt jungle you've constructed.<br />
<br />
To take things even further, Cities XL will offer expansion pack-esque Gameplay Extension Modules, or GEMs. The price of a GEM will vary based on the amount of gameplay it offers; the price range is tentatively set between $2 and $20. <br />
<br />
A Ski Resort GEM will come bundled with the game. It was the only one available during my test, but from what I saw, the levels of interaction are just this side of maddening. You'll be able to design a vacation resort from the ground up to complement your city, map out ski slopes with varying trail difficulties to sate the desires of novice and expert skiers, construct lifts and, of course, offer amenities and gift shops to help your patrons part with their hard-earned dollars. <br />
<br />
If you'd like to see how you're doing with your resort, just click on a patron and you'll get a dossier of their experience. You can find out what socioeconomic group they belong to, how much spending money they've brought along with them on their vacation (making adjustments to their quality of living back in the city as necessary), what they thought of a particular set of slopes (too difficult? Not as difficult as they'd like?), how many days they've been on vacation and how much money they spent on a particular day. <br />
<br />
Other GEMs might include a railroad GEM, giving you complete control over the rail industry you may have established in your town, or a winery GEM, which would allow you to create custom vintages ($400 bottles of cabernet or a $2 jug of Dr. Nate's Cure-All) to peddle to consumers and, potentially, other players.   <br />
<br />
We've all done the city-builder thing. Cities XL hopes to kick it up a notch by offering a massively multiplayer experience. With an optional fee of somewhere between $6 and $8 a month, you'll have access to Cities XL's subscription mode, called &quot;Planet offer,&quot; that will let you use your neurotic number-crunching and tax-balancing tendencies to compete or cooperate with like-minded mayors-in-training around the world. <br />
<br />
If you subscribe, you'll choose an Earth-like planet which will host thousands of players (think servers, in traditional MMO parlance) and scramble for a 10-kilometer-square plot of land on which to place one of your five allotted cities. Particular areas on a planet will provide specific resources, which will be crucial to your development: You can't build a ski resort in the middle of a desert, nor will you find much water, but you more than likely will have access to an abundance of oil. <br />
<br />
The game will then play as it does in the single-player mode, though you'll lack the ability to pause and control time. Fortunately, your city will progress at a much slower rate when you're logged out, so you won't return from a long break to find a smoldering ruin. The benefit of going online is, of course, all of the other folks to meet and greet. Players will be able to band together, establish city links by way of road, rail, air or sea, and trade cash and resources. <br />
<br />
The definition of a &quot;resource&quot; is a bit hazy, but in a good way. For example, you could potentially trade some of your excess oil to a city with a bountiful auto industry in exchange for getting your citizens access to vacations in that city's ski resorts, or a lowered price tag on imported vehicles. Cities can also work together, specializing in, and offering services, that benefit all: Natetopia pumps crude oil, Kohlerlandia refines it and Wiredville's sprawling transportation industry cuts both of our costs in distributing that gasoline to our own cities, and those who purchase from us.<br />
<br />
Social networking will be intertwined with the MMO experience. Those who participate in the Planet offer will be granted a player profile, listing all the stats and details of their cities, and any friends they may have made along the way. From the profile, you'll be able to  leave comments for others, write entries and post pictures in a journal (I had my first riot today!), or chat with other players and discuss business agendas and fiscal schemes, all from the comfort of your browser. <br />
<br />
At the Cities XL website, you'll also be able to shop for GEMs, new building models (if you'd like to take the customization even further) and topographic maps: buy a New York setting and you'll get a detailed replica of the city, so you can finally add the maximum security prison Central Park so desperately needs.  <br />
<br />
The game is still under development, with a tentative ship date of sometime in 2009. System requirements are up in the air at this point: I was told that the game would ideally be able to run on a 3-year-old system. But as anyone who's played a city-builder knows, once you've sculpted that complicated, sprawling empire, frame rates can drop into the single digits, even on beefy machines. We'll have to wait and see how that one plays out.

				Back in February we posted an article titled Fox Suing Warner Brothers Over Watchmen Movie that outlined a legal case that 20th Century Fox was fighting against Warner Brothers for the rights to the Watchmen movie. At the time it didn't create too much buzz because back in February, I was one of the only ones who had visited the set and knew what we'd be seeing in that amazing teaser trailer later on. However, Nikki Finke of Deadline Hollywood has an update today and it's not good, not good at all. &quot;A federal judge has denied a Warner Bros motion to dismiss 20th Century Fox's legal battle over the rights to develop, produce and distribute a film based on the graphic novel Watchmen.&quot; Apparently WB is in some serious legal trouble if this doesn't get straighted out, but details are a bit hazy at the moment.<br />
<br />
Finke says that a 20th Century Fox rep told her that U.S. District Court Judge Gary Allen Feess refused to dismiss the lawsuit filed by Fox. The legal details of this whole case are a bit complicated, so we'll do our best to simplify them. Fox claims that between 1986 and 1990, they acquired all movie rights to the 12-issue DC Comics series and screenplays by Charles McKeown and Sam Hamm. However, in 1991, they sold some rights to Largo International with the understanding that they still held exclusive rights to distribute the first movie. Largo shut down sometime around 1994 and the rights were thus transfered to producer Lawrence Gordon. Fox claims that under a separate agreement between Fox and Gordon, he would pay a &quot;buy-out price&quot; to Fox if he was contracted by another studio to develop Watchmen. And now the movie is being made and they claim they never got their buy-out amount and should be involved.<br />
<br />
And here's what the judge had to say on the situation. &quot;In essence, the Judge appears to conclude that Fox retained distribution rights in Watchmen through the 1991 Largo quit claim, and he concludes that, under the 1994 turnaround, producer Larry Gordon acquired an option to acquire Fox's remaining interest in Watchmen that was never exercised, thereby leaving Fox with its rights under the 1994 agreement.&quot; Apparently the court is still contemplating Fox's motion for an injunction, which means that if they get it, Warner Bros will essentially be forced to give up all rights to Fox and they'll in turn to distribute the movie. The Fox rep also adds that &quot;while the Judge's opinion is preliminary and his views could change in the course of the litigation, his current take on the facts is consistent with our position.&quot;<br />
<br />
Are you fucking kidding me? If this happens and Fox does end up with the rights, I will be the first to boycott the movie. I love Zack Snyder, but Fox needs to know when to step back and stop whining. They had over 20 years to make the Watchmen movie and didn't and I'm sorry that the smarter guys ended up figuring out how to make it successfully. Everything Warner Brothers has done for this movie so far has been wonderful and they deserve to market and distribute the movie, hands down. I'm trying not to get too enraged by this news, because we're waiting for more developments and details, but I just can't help it. I expect Warner Brothers to pay some high price for Fox to step down, but we'll never hear about that publicly and I hope we don't feel the effects of it (in a marketing budget that gets cut, etc). I truly wish Warner Bros' legal department the best of luck.

				A Texas car dealership has settled a lawsuit filed by the widow of a man who killed himself after dropping out of a contest in which participants tried to keep their hand on a vehicle the longest.<br />
<br />
Details of the settlement between Patterson Nissan of Longview, in east Texas, and Chalala Gutierrez, the wife of contestant Richard Thomas Vega II, are confidential, officials said.<br />
<br />
The suit, settled Thursday, focused on a 2005 contest in which the winner of the &quot;Hands on a Hardbody&quot; contest was awarded a Nissan truck and other prizes.<br />
<br />
Just before a scheduled rest break 48 hours into the event, Vega dropped out, crossed a street and broke into a Kmart store, where he took a gun from a case and shot himself.<br />
<br />
In her suit, Gutierrez alleged that the dealership was negligent in organizing and conducting the contest. She likened Vega and other contestants' stress and sleep deprivation to &quot;brainwashing&quot; and said the dealership failed to provide a safe environment for contestants who &quot;temporarily lost their sanity.&quot;<br />
<br />
Court documents show damages sought included fneral costs, lost income of about $600,000 and court costs.<br />
<br />
Attorney Adam Allen said the dealership was happy with the result. An attorney for Gutierrez said the settlement resolved all the allegations in the lawsuit.<br />
<br />
The contest was featured in a 1990s documentary by the same name. It has not been restaged since Vega's death.

<br />
Are Washington’s political parties destined to go the way of the smoke-filled rooms where candidates once were anointed by all-powerful party bosses?<br />
<br />
With the state’s first top two primary just two days away, it’s at least clear that the parties’ wings have been clipped. Under a 7-2 Supreme Court ruling, the state will no longer run its primary election to advance the major parties’ chosen candidates to the general election ballot.<br />
<br />
Instead, the power to choose now rests with the voters, who are free to cast their vote for any candidate, with the top two vote-getters advancing regardless of their party affiliation. Come November, there is no guarantee there will be a Republican and a Democrat in every race. It could even happen in Southwest Washington’s 3rd Congressional District.<br />
<br />
Party leaders aren’t happy about the prospect.<br />
<br />
The top two system “will reduce the influence of the parties, and I think that’s a bad thing,” said state Democratic Party Chairman Dwight Pelz, “because the fact of the matter is that for hundreds of thousands of voters in Washington state and millions of voters across the country, party labels are important in deciding who to vote for.”<br />
<br />
“We feel very strongly that we should not have people who are hostile to the principles of the Republican Party choosing Republican candidates,” Republican state chairman Luke Esser said.<br />
<br />
Washington’s experiment with the open primary could be just the opening wedge in a movement to diminish the influence of political parties.<br />
<br />
In November, Oregon voters will decide whether to follow Washington’s example and jettison their own party-run primary system. Oregon voters, unlike those in Washington, register by party, and only major-party candidates appear on the state’s primary ballot, so the overhaul there would be even more dramatic.<br />
<br />
Recent polls show the Oregon measure enjoys strong support. If it passes, and survives a likely legal challenge, the two states could find themselves on the leading edge of a national movement to cut political parties out of the candidate selection process in state and local partisan races.<br />
<br />
“Parties have no constitutional right to be part of the primary system,” says former Oregon Secretary of State Phil Keisling, chief petitioner for the state’s open primary measure. “They have plenty of free speech. They can advertise. What they don’t have is control, and they hate that.”<br />
<br />
In Oregon, he said, an open primary would enfranchise large numbers of voters, including those under 35 who tend to identify themselves as independents. Under the current system, independents, Libertarians, Greens and members of other minor parties are excluded from the Oregon primary. In the state’s 2006 primary, the median age of voters was 60 years.<br />
<br />
“Fewer and fewer people are participating, and more and more decisions and being made by fewer and fewer people,” Keisling said.<br />
<br />
Washington’s system hasn’t limited voter participation as much as Oregon’s “because we have not had political party registration,” said Washington Secretary of State Sam Reed. “But I do still think it has had a chilling effect on people participating.”<br />
<br />
Reed, perhaps the state’s leading champion of the top two primary, says that though political parties no longer have the clout they once did, they still have an important role to play.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think political parties will become irrelevant,” he said. “I think the role of political parties in the 21st century is to go out and recruit quality candidates who would be good office holders, who fit their general philosophy, and to help them with training, raising money, helping them organize and succeed. That is going to be their role, instead of the 19th-century notion of the party bosses hand-picking who the candidates are going to be.”<br />
<br />
Party leaders say it’s premature to write the political parties’ obituaries.<br />
<br />
“I do think it’s too early to tell whether (the top two primary) has weakened the influence of the major parties,” said Ryan Hart, chairman of the Clark County Republican Central Committee. “It certainly has that potential. It may be that we have some single-party races on the ballot in November.”<br />
<br />
With voting front-loaded to the primary, “Our number one job now is to get our members out voting for our candidates,” said Dena Horton, chairwoman of Clark County Democrats. “A negative effect of doing it this way is that now it’s up to the candidates to raise more money than ever before.”<br />
<br />
“If you have a race like Pam Brokaw’s, to distinguish yourself among seven candidates, you have to do a lot to get your message out,” she said.<br />
<br />
Brokaw is the lone Democrat in a seven-way race to succeed County Commissioner Betty Sue Morris.<br />
<br />
Regardless of how the new primary plays out, political parties aren’t going away, Hart said. “The parties have their platforms and the voters identify with the platforms and the parties. They know in general what a party stands for. They want to vote with the party that shares their ideals.”<br />
<br />
‘Cussed independents’<br />
<br />
In one way, Washington’s new top two primary sends the state’s election system into uncharted territory.<br />
<br />
In another way, Washington voters have been here before.<br />
<br />
They’ve always been skittish about identifying themselves with a single party at the ballot box. That’s why they liked the blanket primary, which for nearly 70 years allowed them to vote both sides of the ballot.<br />
<br />
“The whole ticket-splitting is a Washington tradition,” says Dave Ammons, longtime state political reporter for the Associated Press and now communications director for Secretary of State Reed. It’s a reflection, he said, of “our cussed independent streak.”<br />
<br />
Voters weren’t happy two years ago when they were required to check a party preference box for their votes to count in the much-reviled “pick-a-party” primary. Nearly 100,000 voters statewide failed to do so, including about 6 percent who cast ballots in Clark County.<br />
<br />
The 2007 Legislature wasted no time passing legislation to get rid of the offending box, which was supposed to prevent ticket-splitting.<br />
<br />
The box surfaced again on the February presidential primary ballot, on which voters were required to declare themselves either Democrats or Republicans and to promise not to take part in the nominating process of any other party. Presidential primaries won’t be affected by the top two primary rule.<br />
<br />
‘Will of the people’<br />
<br />
In March came the U.S. Supreme Court’s surprise 7-2 ruling upholding the top two primary, which Washington voters had approved by a 60 percent majority in 2004 with the passage of Initiative 872.<br />
<br />
To overturn the primary, wrote Justice Clarence Thomas, would be “an extraordinary and precipitous nullification of the will of the people.”<br />
<br />
Legal challenges by the major political parties had stayed the implementation of the new primary system for four years. The parties argued, and still argue, that a primary election where they have no control over how candidates identify themselves violates their right to freedom of association and undermines the entire concept of party affiliation.<br />
<br />
Reed hailed the high court’s ruling. “We took the people’s case to the nation’s highest court and the people won,” he said.<br />
<br />
Washington voters “told us they wanted the freedom to vote for the candidate of their choice regardless of party, and the U.S. Supreme Court agreed with them,” said Attorney General Rob McKenna, who argued the case before the Supreme Court.<br />
<br />
The Washington State Grange joined the state in the court battle to implement the top two primary.<br />
<br />
The ruling forced the parties into a defensive posture. If they could not nominate candidates through the primary system, they said, they would make endorsements outside the election system.<br />
<br />
“We’ll adapt,” Esser said. “We’ll have to do things to nominate our candidates earlier in the process, through conventions and caucuses.”<br />
<br />
In Clark County, 17th District Democrats were spared a public vote when Martin Hash bowed after it became clear the party favored David Carrier to run against Republican Sen. Don Benton.<br />
<br />
Republican precinct committee officers in the 17th recently endorsed Joseph James over Rep. Jim Dunn by a 16-1 vote on a secret ballot. But both James and Dunn appear as Republicans on Tuesday’s ballot.<br />
<br />
Both parties faced tricky choices in the 3rd Congressional District race, where one Democrat and two Republicans filed to run against Democratic U.S. Rep. Brian Baird.<br />
<br />
“It was possible that two Democrats could advance to the general election,” said Hart, the county Republican chair. To lessen that possibility, he said, 3rd Congressional District Republicans endorsed Olympia party regular Christine Webb over Libertarian-leaning Michael Delavar “to make it clear who the Republican choice was.”<br />
<br />
Similarly, 3rd Congressional District Democrats had to choose between Baird and Olympia peace activist Cheryl Crist, who strongly opposed Baird’s support for the 2007 U.S. troop surge in Iraq. Baird got the nod.<br />
<br />
“We are a party of many voices,” Horton said. “For folks who have strong opinions about the Iraq War, it was a difficult decision.”<br />
<br />
The Democratic, Republican and Libertarian parties continue to challenge the legality of the top two primary in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, focusing on issues the Supreme Court did not address.<br />
<br />
In July, their attorneys argued that the state should continue to use the pick-a-party system “until such time, if ever, as the validity of I-872 is fully and finally upheld.”<br />
<br />
Reed considers the case closed. “The fact that the highest court in the land not only decided this case, but decided it by a 7-2 margin, and the fact that the people adopted this system by a 60 percent margin, puts the state in a very strong position.”<br />
<br />
Early impacts<br />
<br />
The legal arguments are likely to continue for a while.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, how is the new system working?<br />
<br />
There are still some bugs to be worked out, Ammons concedes.<br />
<br />
For example, candidates are asked to state a party preference, whether or not the party they name actually exists. Case in point: the legislative candidate from Bellingham who said he preferred the “Salmon Yoga Party.”<br />
<br />
“There’s no way to register a party anymore,” Ammons said. “It’s definitely a new day.”<br />
<br />
Because I-872 did away with a lot of state election rules, a cleanup bill will be introduced in the Legislature in January, he said.<br />
<br />
 The top two primary is designed to winnow the field in partisan races to the top two vote-getters, who will advance to the general election, as long as they receive at least 1 percent of the vote cast.<br />
<br />
But in Clark County legislative races, little winnowing will be required. Only two contests drew more than two candidates. Most races pit one Republican against one Democrat, just as in the past.<br />
<br />
Incumbents still enjoy an advantage. Statewide, three dozen House members did not even draw a challenger this year, and others face only token opposition. Eight state senators, including Sen. Craig Pridemore, have a free ride, although a Republican is mounting a write-in campaign against the Vancouver Democrat.<br />
<br />
In races with just two candidates, this year’s primary is something of an empty exercise, especially for incumbents. Many are saving their campaign war chests for the general election.<br />
<br />
“I think it would be more interesting if there was a third person involved,” said Rep. Jim Moeller, 49th District Democrat, who is being challenged by independent Mike Bomar.<br />
<br />
Bomar, in fact, stands to benefit from the top two primary rule. He’s virtually guaranteed a runoff even as an independent.<br />
<br />
First-time candidates say the experience of ringing doorbells and getting to know voters is invaluable even if they’re assured a spot on the November ballot. And by revealing where voters stand two-and-a-half months before the general election, the primary results could lead some candidates to rethink their campaign strategies.<br />
<br />
 Even in two-candidate races the results will be watched closely by potential campaign donors. Lesser-known candidates say it’s important that they make a respectable showing if they hope to raise money for the general election.<br />
<br />
Jon Haugen, a Democrat who has raised less than $10,000 in his campaign against Sen Joe Zarelli, R-Ridgefield, hopes to get at least 40 percent of the primary vote to show he’s a viable candidate. “It’s a dress rehearsal for the November election,” he said. “If the voters say they want to stick with Joe, then I’m not getting any money.”<br />
<br />
“I’ve taken nothing for granted,” Zarelli said of the primary campaign. “Given the fact that people can vote cross-ticket, we’ve made it a priority.”<br />
<br />
Washington primary timeline<br />
<br />
1935-2003: Washington uses a “blanket primary” that lists candidates from all parties on one ballot and allows voters to choose candidates from any party. The highest vote-getter in each party becomes that party’s nominee in the general election.<br />
<br />
2000: The U.S. Supreme Court overturns a nearly identical primary in California, siding with four political parties who argue that the system unconstitutionally forces them to associate with voters who don’t share their beliefs.<br />
<br />
2003: The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals strikes down Washington’s blanket primary as “materially indistinguishable from the California scheme.”<br />
<br />
2004: Washington voters pass Initiative 872, which establishes a top two primary system in which the top two voter-getters advance to the general election regardless of party affiliation.<br />
<br />
2005: A federal district court judge rules I-872 unconstitutional in a case brought by the state Democratic, Republican and Libertarian parties. The state of Washington and the Washington State Grange appeal to the 9th Circuit, which upholds the district court ruling.<br />
<br />
2006: Primary voters are required to pick a party and vote a straight party ticket.<br />
<br />
2007: Attorney General Rob McKenna argues the state’s case before the U.S. Supreme Court.<br />
<br />
2008: March 18: The U.S. Supreme Court upholds the top two primary in a 7-2 opinion. Aug. 19: Voters use the top two primary for the first time.<br />

We all know that music can alter your mood. Sad songs can make you cry. Upbeat songs may give you an energy boost. But can music create the same effects as illegal drugs?<br />
<br />
This seems like a ridiculous question. But websites are targeting your children with so-called digital drugs. These are audio files designed to induce drug-like effects.<br />
<br />
All your child needs is a music player and headphones.<br />
<br />
Understanding binaural beats<br />
<br />
There are different slang terms for digital drugs. They're often called &quot;idozers&quot; or &quot;idosers.&quot; All rely on the concept of binaural beats.<br />
<br />
It is incorrect to call binaural beats music. They're really ambient sounds designed to affect your brain waves.<br />
FIND MORE STORIES IN: Internet | Phoenix | YouTube | Duke University | Pied Piper | Barrow Neurological Institute<br />
<br />
For binaural beats to work, you must use headphones. Different sounds are played in each ear. The sounds combine in your brain to create a new frequency. This frequency corresponds to brain wave frequencies.<br />
<br />
There are different brain wave frequencies. These frequencies are related to different states like relaxation and alertness.<br />
<br />
Digital drugs supposedly synchronize your brain waves with the sound. Hence, they allegedly alter your mental state.<br />
<br />
Binaural beats create a beating sound. Other noises may be included with binaural beats. This is intended to mask their unpleasant sound.<br />
<br />
Different types of digital drugs<br />
<br />
Some sites provide binaural beats that have innocuous effects. For example, some claim to help you develop extrasensory powers like telepathy and psychokinesis.<br />
<br />
Other sites offer therapeutic binaural beats. They help you relax or meditate. Some allegedly help you overcome addiction or anxiety. Others purport to help you lose weight or eliminate gray hair.<br />
<br />
However, most sites are more sinister. They sell audio files (&quot;doses&quot;) that supposedly mimic the effects of alcohol and marijuana.<br />
<br />
But it doesn't end there. You'll find doses that purportedly mimic the effects of LSD, crack, heroin and other hard drugs. There are also doses of a sexual nature. I even found ones that supposedly simulate heaven and hell.<br />
<br />
Do digital drugs work?<br />
<br />
Many are skeptical about the effects of digital drugs. Few scientific studies have been conducted on binaural beats. However, a Duke University study suggests that they can affect mood and motor performance.<br />
<br />
Dr. Nicholas Theodore, a brain surgeon at Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, said there is no real evidence that idosers work. But he noted that musical preference is indicative of emotional vulnerability. Trying idosers could indicate a willingness to experiment with drugs and other dangerous behavior.<br />
<br />
Theodore added that idosers are another reason to monitor kids' Internet usage. And, he said, kids need frank talks with their parents about correct choices.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suspect this 'Pied Piper' phenomenon will pass rapidly and quietly,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Online, many people have posted their experiences with digital drugs. They tout the effectiveness of binaural beats.<br />
<br />
Or, go to YouTube. You'll see videos of teens experimenting with digital drugs. You can decide for yourself if binaural beats induce drug-like effects.<br />
<br />
Companies that sell digital drugs take both sides of the argument. They say that the doses are extremely powerful. Some are recommended only for experienced users.<br />
<br />
But they often hedge their bets. Some users may be immune to binaural beats, they say. They also say the situation must be right to feel the effects.<br />
<br />
Should you worry about digital drugs?<br />
<br />
Companies that sell digital drugs claim they're safe. Supposedly, they won't affect your physical health.<br />
<br />
Let's think about this for a moment. The sites claim binaural beats cause the same effects as illegal drugs. These drugs impair coordination and can cause hallucinations. They've caused countless fatal accidents, like traffic collisions.<br />
<br />
If binaural beats work as promised, they are not safe. They could also create a placebo effect. The expectation elicits the response. Again, this is unsafe.<br />
<br />
At the very least, digital drugs promote drug use. Some sites say binaural beats can be used with illegal drugs.<br />
<br />
The sites also look favorably on the effects of illegal drugs. So, talk to your children. Make sure they understand the dangers of this culture. It could be a small jump from digital drugs to the real thing.<br />

It looks pretty bleak for HGL. Comerica holds the IP, so no one can actually do anything with development right now. Too bad. I really wish the 2.0 patch had at least been released before everything imploded. <br />

Also, the business plan for ongoing content was apparently directly ripped off from the underpants gnomes:<br />

				well, part of the challenge was that when we originally came up with the concept of doing the game, the whole idea of continuing content was pretty amorphous. How that was going to happen, who pays for that -- we all kind of assumed that would come out of the revenue. The subscription money we did get, we all poured directly into keeping the game online, keeping it up and running. But the development demands far outstripped the revenues. There just wasn't a good contemplation early on of how that would work. It wasn't like: This is the budget that comes in every month; we'll do whatever we can do with that. We just said [that] development will get done out of the revenues, and whoever pays for development, they get paid back out of the revenues. And there wasn't really enough revenues coming in to cover the expected and required development costs.

A Cleveland Police spokeswoman said: &quot;The incoming flight from Amsterdam was coming in to land at Durham Tees Valley Airport when a laser device was shone into the cockpit. <br />
<br />
&quot;The pilot was temporarily blinded and the co-pilot landed the plane. <br />
<br />
&quot;When the police helicopter was sent to investigate, it too was targeted by the laser device. <br />
<br />
&quot;Officers on the ground were able to arrest a 19-year-old man, who was outside the airport, and the device recovered.&quot; <br />
<br />
She said there were no reports of injuries. The man is due to appear at Teesside Magistrates' Court on Friday.

</div>Assbag got me in the eye with a laser pointer, years ago, felt liek a combination of being punched in the eye and seeing arc welding without a visor, ugh.<br />
<br />
Either some mentally deranged person, or a Chav doing it for a laugh, in latter case, the bastard almost killed many people and should thus suffer for that, not mere recklessness.</div>

				The Banana Splits in TV comeback  <br />
  <br />
The Banana Splits have kept their original &quot;groovy&quot; feel<br />
 <br />
Children's TV classic The Banana Splits is getting a modern makeover. <br />
<br />
Fleegle, Bingo, Drooper and Snorky are to star in new comedy shorts and music videos on the Cartoon Network in the US, and its website, from September. <br />
<br />
A series of DVDs, live concerts, music CDs, and online games from the anarchic crew are expected to follow. <br />
<br />
&quot;Everything that made The Banana Splits popular in the '60s is back, including the group's terrific humour and music,&quot; said Jordan Sollitto, of Warner Bros. <br />
<br />
&quot;We take great pride in having carefully updated the look and feel of the original show for today's kids while retaining all of the elements that made the original Banana Splits such a hit.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
The Banana Splits came onto the scene in 1968 as hosts of The Banana Splits Adventure Hour, a show created by Hanna-Barbera that featured comedy and music videos. <br />
<br />
They are a costumed rock band made up of Fleegle (a dog), Drooper (a lion), Bingo (a gorilla) and Snorky (an elephant) who hang out in their Banana Pad while playing music and telling jokes. <br />
<br />
The show's theme song, The Tra La La Song, quickly became a classic. <br />
<br />
The new shorts share the same &quot;groovy&quot; look of the original TV series. <br />
<br />
&quot;The Banana Splits is a classic that has been entertaining kids for years,&quot; said Stuart Snyder, president of Turner Animation, Young Adults and Kids Media. <br />
<br />
&quot;We're thrilled to have this new version on Cartoon Network for our kids to enjoy today.&quot;
