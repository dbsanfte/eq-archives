These are very long and drawn out, you will understand by the time this explanation is done.
<HR>
<b>Step 1:</b> First you need a King Cod Card. There are two ways of attaining this. One way is by fishing... (go fish.. haha). The other way is by killing Dinner. After you get the card you have to find Ferjenorer in the garden maze to receive your Deck of Spontaneous Generation, a 4 slot container (This will be explained later).
<HR>
<b>Step 2:</b> Now you need to get your library card. As far as I've seen it drops off any of the gorilla's in the zone. There are the Gorilla Scholars in the east wing, and there is Glonk in the Alice in Wonderland area. After you get your library card. You have to give it to the librarian in... /gasp the library. She will give you the Book of Mischief, another 4 slot container (This will also be explained later)
<HR>
<b>Step 3:</b> Well now you've got your two containers filling up inventory space.. now what? Now you gotta start collecting those cards for the Armor of Distraction, and other card combine armors. You combine different combinations of 4 cards in your Deck of Spontaneous Generation this armor. Now you're like what the heck? This isn't what I wanted. Read on my friend. I told you this wasn't a 3 day quest. (For a full listing of the card combinations and armors go <a href="http://www.planeofmischief.com"><b>here</b></a>)
<HR>
<b>Step 4:</b> Now you've got your Armor of Distraction, which is kinda cool, and your 2 containers, but you're STILL not satisfied! You want your class specific armor right? Right. So now you've gotta start finding those pieces of the Words of Wealth. You've probably seen them dropping while finding your cards. When you finally get all 4 corners: Top left, top right, Bottom left, and Bottom right then you can combine them in your Book of Mischief (you remember this?) to get a Words of Wealth. You then give this to Bob the Painter in the treasure chest room and he will give you /grumble ANOTHER container! This one is called Pot of Gold, this is a two slot container. You're like "Holy crap! this sucks now I've got 3 main inventory slot filled with crappy containers and still don't have the armor I want!" Right? but hey.. you want this armor or you wouldn't be here.
<HR>
<b>Step 5:</b> Don't worry there's no more containers (whew). Now you gotta start making funny money. To do this you gotta combine any card combine armor piece with... /mumble another words of wealth (remember that annoying 4 corner combine thingy.. yea.. that..). You need two funny money. Then you give those two funny money to Peaches in front of the castle entrance for a gift box. The color of the box is completely random. You might get the color for your class... you might not... but hey... this plane is mischievious right? The box has 5 charges of summon doll (different dolls depending on the color of the box). You combine the dolls for your class with the armor of distraction to get your class specific armor. Yay.
<HR>
<b>Step 6:</b> Enjoy your new armor! That's about it.
<HR>
Note: all of the cards are tradable, as are the dolls. If you get the wrong gift box you can always trade dolls with someone else who got the wrong box. I see the cards and dolls for sale in bazaar sometimes. Just if you start feeling desperate and stuff ya know.</td></tr></table></body></html>
