  <p align="left">Within Qeynos at the bridge near the bank, there is an NPC 
  named Zamel. Speak to him about the aqueducts, beasts and children. He will 
  then give you the information you need to start the quest.

  <p>Go down into the water where the bridge is and find the spawn point within 
  the sewer (132, -63). Please note that there is a way down in the water right 
  next to Zamel but it has been blocked off for downward travel. You must use 
  the other entrances to get down. Kill everything that spawns and at some point 
  Cuburt, a gelatinous cube, will come out. </p>
  <p>Kill him and he will sometimes drop a tattered dress. Kill Cuburt quickly 
  or he will sometimes kill himself within the water as he runs away. </p>
  <p>Take the tattered dress back to Zamel and he will in return give you a +3 
  intelligence earring (the booby prize is a piece of hemitite). Getting the 
  earring in return is actually quite rare. Be prepared to do this quest over 
  and over.</p>
  <p>HELPFUL INFO:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Faction can be easily raised by giving Guard Wenbie muffins 4 at a time 
    in <br>
    Qeynos. The reward on the earring quest seems to be relative to faction.</li>
