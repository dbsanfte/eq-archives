			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Well, up to this point this has been some of the best coverage of the Olympics I have seen in years. Certainly the best NBC has done in a long while. They've finally figured out that taped events suck in the age of the internet. They have had a ton of live coverage and it really has made a difference.<br />
<br />
It has helped that there have been some compelling stories with Phelps and that relay race. It looks like the US Mens Gymnastics team could be putting together something amazing as well.<br />
<br />
Also, the coverage on other channels is cool as well. It has allowed more air time for events that usually aren't covered.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I hope they can keep this up and they don't get too bogged down showing 3 hours of rythmic gymnastics.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>the company is going in a different direction, and it is better for both parties.<br />
<br />
That's what I was told this afternoon at work.<br />
<br />
I worked for a small company (2 software developers, 2 clerical people, 1 VP, 3 Executive VPs, 1 CEO, 1 Majority Owner, 1 Majority Owner's Assistant).  I was the only one let go (on this day).  I was given the option to resign or be fired.  If I chose resignation, I would get 8 weeks severance pay, plus 12 weeks health insurance as my severance package.  I chose to resign, rather than try to get unemployment compensation.  So, I have 2 months worth of money to support the wife and I (our savings is currently thrashed between her school and buying a car and vacation) while I try to find another job.<br />
<br />
Yeah.  Wonderful Monday.<br />
<br />
Anyone need an ASP.NET/C# Developer in the Dallas, TX area with 3.5 years experience and a BS in Computer Science from The University of Texas at Dallas?</div>

By HILLEL ITALIE – 16 hours ago<br />
<br />
NEW YORK (AP) — He's written million-selling books about his early years and the meaning of public life. Now, Sen. Barack Obama, with the help of his campaign staff, has another side to share with readers: policy wonk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Change We Can Believe In: Barack Obama's Plan to Renew America's Promise&quot; is coming out Sept. 9 as a paperback with an announced first printing of 300,000 copies and a list price of $13.95. Looking ahead to the digital market, the e-book, also $13.95, will go on sale the day before.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are proud to have published two best-selling books by Barack Obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country,&quot; Crown Publishing Group president Jenny Frost said in a statement.<br />
<br />
The book will include a foreword by Obama, the Democrats' presumptive presidential nominee, and feature sections — written by members of Obama for America, his presidential campaign — on such issues as health care, energy and national security. &quot;Change We Can Believe In&quot; also compiles some of his better known speeches, including his celebrated talk on race and his recent address in Berlin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Change&quot; will be released by Three Rivers Press, a paperback imprint of Crown Publishing, which published Obama's &quot;Dreams From My Father&quot; and &quot;The Audacity of Hope.&quot; According to Obama's literary representative, Washington attorney Robert Barnett, the contract is between Crown and Obama's presidential campaign, not Obama himself.<br />
<br />
Financial terms were not available, although Barnett says the campaign will donate all net proceeds to a charity still to be determined. The new release was assembled over the past few weeks and is not part of the senator's current deal with Crown, which calls for him to write two more books, including a children's book.<br />
<br />
&quot;Change We Can Believe In&quot; will test Obama's appeal. Policy books are rarely hits with the public, although they can be quite useful for candidates, such as Obama, who have been criticized for lacking substance. In 1992, Bill Clinton and running mate Al Gore released &quot;Putting People First,&quot; a blueprint for their time in office that became a best seller and remained popular even after they were elected.<br />
<br />
Obama's book will have strong competition at stores. It comes out at the same time as Bob Woodward's fourth volume on the Bush administration, one of the fall's most anticipated releases.<br />
<br />
Crown is a division of Random House Inc.</div>
			
			<hr />
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Great financial decision by the Obama campaign: all those people criticizing Obama of being light on policy will have to buy his book to have any credibility.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I saw The Clone Wars Saturday morning.  I know this isn't released until later this week, but I got to go to an advanced screening through some friends.  Getting in was like going through airport security.<br />
<br />
I will avoid spoilers, so read on without fear<br />
<br />
<br />
The Good:<br />
The scenes are very full and busy.  The overall movie is well done, although I'm not sure I like the blocky/sharp angle style of animation.  The movie touches on all of the various things you'd expect to see.  Just about every race/class from the movies makes an appearance, although there are a few missing.  The various droids, ships, and places are shown too.  <br />
<br />
The Not Good:<br />
The voice acting for on of the Huts is beyond annoying (sounds like a nasaly Cartman).  The endless banter between some characters and factions gets annoying as well.  My friend that got us in made an accurate observation about the style.  He said that the jedi are fluid in their movements and that everything flows well.  In this, everything was fast and furious with start/stop jerky movements.  <br />
<br />
Side Question:  If this takes place between Episodes 2 and 3 shouldn't Anakin have a fake hand/arm at this point?<br />
<br />
Overall:  It looks nice and kids will love it.  There isn't much substance behind it though.  <br />
<br />
Bonus:  The guy from the movie studio that was there said they are doing a cartoon network series later based on the movie.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>This movie was a lot better than I expected it would be after seeing previews.  It's basically an action-comedy.  By action comedy, I mean violent in a way that is just one step more painful than you were expecting.  There's lots of gore, but it's mostly funny.  There are well-choreographed fights, car chase scenes, and even massive explosions.  They're like regular movie action scenes with tension drained out and humor filling in the gaps.  Sort of what you'd expect from a movie named after a type of Marijuana.<br />
<br />
The whole movie is just a little off-kilter.  The characters are wacky and colorful.  None of the characters are extraordinarily likeable, but some are more likeable than not; especially James Franco's Saul.  The side plot with the High School girlfriend feels a little superfluous at times, but it's good for a few laughs.  The dinner scene is hilarious.  Gary Cole and Rosie Perez are great as the villains.  Cole especially: Ted Jones would have a similar douchebag rating to Bill Lumberg, but in a completely different way.<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed it.  It's light, irreverent, doesn't take itself too seriously, and it's fun start to finish.  I don't think any of the characters will become as iconic as The Dude, but they're all memorable in their own way.</div>
