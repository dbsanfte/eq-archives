			<b>Doctors say looking at busty women for ten minutes a day is good for your health</b><br /><br />    <a href="http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/by-date/09-07-2011" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> 9 Jul 2011 00:00 </a>       Staring at busty women can lengthen your life, scientists have proved.<br />

     <br />
      Staring at busty women can lengthen your life, scientists have proved.<br />
 A German study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine,  concludes that staring at women's breasts for a few minutes daily is  better for your health than going to the gym.<br />
 &quot;Just 10 minutes of looking at the charms of well-endowed females is  equivalent to a 30-minute aerobics work-out,&quot; said author Dr Karen  Weatherby, an expert on ageing.<br />
 The research team, led by Dr Weatherby, spent five years monitoring the effects of this unique discovery.<br />
 The men who were told to stare at bosoms daily had lower blood  pressure and slower resting pulse rates and also decreased their risk of  coronary artery disease.<br />
 Dr Weatherby explained: &quot;Sexual excitement gets the heart pumping and improves blood circulation.<br />
 &quot;There's no question - gazing at large breasts makes men healthier.&quot;<br />
 She also recommends that men over 40 should spend at least 10 minutes daily admiring breasts sized D-cup or larger.<br />
<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>It's been going on for decades now, an entirely one-sided attack on America by the people in the .1% income bracket and their servants in the 1% income bracket.  Now that we're noticing these things, and that America has lagged far behind the rest of the Western Nations in improving our social contracts, these people who have been waging war on you for decades are now squalling like bee-stung babies about the &quot;class warfare&quot; inherent in things such as healthcare reform and whenever the idea of allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire for the upper income brackets is discussed.  <br />
 <br />
If you still require more proof that this is so, if you are still carrying water for the Right, then tell me, have you got about 5 miles handy to properly display a chart of the income disparity in the USA right now?<br />

			Charles Cooper, the attorney arguing on behalf of gay marriage  opponents, said marriage between a man and a woman is in the best  interest of society because only such a union could lead to “responsible  procreation.” Since gay couples do not have the biological capacity to  produce children together, the equal protection clause under the  constitution does not apply to them, he argued.<br />

<br />
Interesting return to the fundamental argument that conservatives have made in the past.  This is an easy argument to shoot down in specific example but if the court decides that it's a &quot;rational basis&quot; for making marriage between a man and a woman, then the case is over.  <br />
<br />
This is the &quot;go for broke&quot; argument for the conservatives.</div>

It looks like it took all the parts I liked best about Bastion and making them better, while also throwing in cool new things. It's got a bit of a strategy mechanic mixed in with the action rpg gameplay. You can pause and queue actions, which use up a limited resource when then refills during normal combat.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So, everyone has their opinion. Everyone who reads this thread is going to imemdiately think, &quot;No No, its all about smokers&quot; or &quot;Its all about Mesquite&quot; <br />
<br />
Thats not what I'm asking.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just Grilling. Charcoal or Gas? <br />
<br />
Personally? I used to be a huge fan of Gas, and for the last couple years, its all I've done. <br />
<br />
But for my son's birthday party yesterday, we went out to the regional park, got one of the picnic areas with a 4 ftx4ft charcoal grill and filled it up with 4 bags of charcoal in a great big pyramid, and along side it setup my gas grill. <br />
<br />
When it came down to it. We (me) burnt the hell out of everything over the charcoal to a crisp. 90% of all surfaces that hit that charcoal grill were black. <br />
<br />
HOWEVER, it sealed in so much juice. Some people ripped off the bark, others ate it right on it. The meat we cooked on the gas grill was 100% a secondary product, against what burnt on the outside over the super hot charcoal. The charcoal was so hot that the hair on my arms was gone by the end of the day, but I have to say, after that experience, I'm highly considering going  and getting one of those extra large Weber charcoal grills. Way more impressed with that route after 4 years of not using one.<br />
<br />
And to be quite honest, I almost feel like I tasted the propane in tonight's recreation of everythign we did yesterday over charcoal.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I finally broke down and subscribed to netflix.  Not sure how long it will last.  I watched this movie, <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_Game:_The_Movie" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Indie Game: The Movie</a></i>, released last year.  I searched the archives and didn't find any discussion of it, but my brain is fried from not sleeping last night so I might have missed it.  Anyway this is a good movie.  Highly recommended.<br />
<br />
The format is a standard documentary, reminiscent of <i>The Dungeon Masters</i> but far more sympathetic to the subjects.  They use interviews with and video footage of the designers and programmers to construct narratives about the creation and release of several Indie Games, specifically <i>Super Meat Boy</i>, <i>Fez</i>, and <i>Braid</i>.  The sections on <i>Braid</i>, which was released in 2008, are more of a reflection, while the target for <i>Meat Boy</i> is X-Box live release day and <i>Fez</i> is a playable demo at PaxEast.<br />
<br />
The movie touches on the talents of the creators, their sacrifices, hard work, various difficulties and setbacks as well as their successes and high points.  There is plenty of discussion of and reflection on design philosophies and creative motivations, though it never gets too technical.  It ranges from Edmund McMillen's bizarre artistic mind to Jonathan Blow's concise description about the fundamental differences between independent games and studio games.  Each creator also spends a significant amount of time discussing the motivations, ideas, and concepts related to the particular game, both in terms of artistic expression and gameplay experience.<br />
<br />
Without spoiling too much I have to say my favorite part was probably watching the creators watch the reactions of people actually playing the games.</div>

    CINCINNATI (AP) — A shadow of a different kind is hanging over Punxsutawney Phil.<br />
 <br />
  Authorities in still-frigid Ohio have issued  an ‘‘indictment’’ against the famed groundhog, who predicted an early  spring when he didn’t see his shadow after emerging from his lair in  western Pennsylvania on Feb. 2.<br />
 <br />
  Spring arrived Wednesday, and temperatures are  still hovering in the 30s in the Buckeye state and much of the  Northeast. While it’s not the coldest spring on record, it’s a good 5  degrees below normal, said Don Hughes, a meteorologist with the National  Weather Service in Wilmington, Ohio.<br />
