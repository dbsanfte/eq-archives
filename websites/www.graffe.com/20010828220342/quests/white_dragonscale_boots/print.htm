<p align="center">This quest starts by talking to Lord Yelinak within Skyshrine.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>You say</b>, 'Hail, Lord Yelinak'<br>
    <b>Lord Yelinak says</b> 'Welcome young mortal, word of your deeds has preceded 
    your arrival. Your intentions seem honorable, young one, however my trust 
    is not an easy thing to win these days. Like you, there has been another that 
    came before me with the trust of the dragon kin, and trust them too I did, 
    but alas that proved to be destructive. I note your deeds to this shrine young 
    one, but should you wish my counsel, you must prove your worth beyond doubt. 
    Perhaps a small challenge shall be of interest to you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="MM_showHideLayers('spoiler','','show');MM_showHideLayers('riddle','','hide')"><img src="spoiler.gif" width="130" height="27" border="0"></a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>You say</b>, 'I wish to prove myself worth'<br>
    <b>Lord Yelinak says</b> 'Then as agreed, young mortal, I will grant you one 
    <br>
    chance to prove your worth in my eyes. The Storm King Tormax sits on a <br>
    throne carved from the skull of one of our fallen within the city of Kael, 
    <br>
    which disgraces the mighty children of Veeshan. His life alone is a blight 
    <br>
    upon the children of Veeshan. Should you be a true patriot to our cause, I 
    seek of you but one task. Should you succeed in this task, not only will <br>
    your actions offset the balance of this war in our favor, but will surely 
    <br>
    take a step in driving the vileness of the giants from our noble lands. Bring 
    me, young one, the head of Tormax, and then we shall speak further.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Speaking to Lord Yelinak, you learn that he wants you to return 
  the head of King Tormax (L70 Giant WAR) from Kael Drakkal to him. Once you have 
  obtained the head of Tormax, take it back to Yelinak and trade it to him.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Lord Yelinak watches as you drop the colossal head of King Tormax to the 
    ground before him. You sense intense hatred within Yelinak as he stares down 
    at the bloody remains of a descendent of the one who slew his mate. Obviously 
    the death of Tormax has done little to console the ancient snow dragon. Finally 
    Yelinak speaks, 'I look upon this face, and even though he is dead, the hatred 
    burns on. My grief and anger are unchanged even in the face of ultimate fate. 
    His grandfather's act was so despicable and all-encompassing that it instilled 
    an. . . immortal loathing. Neverttheless, you have completed the task I set 
    before you and, as such, you deserve my gratitude. Please accept this [treasure]. 
  </p>
  <p>Your faction standing with Yelinak could not possibly get any better.<br>
    Your faction standing with ClawsofVeeshan could not possibly get any better.<br>
    Your faction standing with KingTormax got worse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In return for the head, Lord Yelinak gives you a <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('clawed_griffin_sword.gif','clawedgriffonsword','width=330,height=145')">Clawed 
  Griffin Sword</a>. </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>You say</b>, 'What treasure?'<br>
    <b>Lord Yelinak says</b> 'This sword is a symbol of our evolution and ancient 
    <br>
    heritage. Back when our feathered relatives were not so distant, a sword was 
    forged and enchanted with the spirit of an elder griffin. This noble griffin 
    bound his soul to the sword, the essence of his being honing the blade to 
    an edge imperceptible to mortal eyes. Although our races have evolved away 
    from each other, we still hold them in high regard. But if you think you are 
    not worthy to wield this honor, return the sword to me and I have other tokens 
    you may find of more use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now hand back the Clawed Griffin Sword to Lord Yelinak. In trade he will give 
  you a very nice pair of boots -</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Lord Yelinak says 'I lost the scales that made these boots in a battle with 
    Tormax's minions. The casters of the shrine gathered these fallen scales up 
    and fashioned a very powerful enchantment into these boots.<br>
  </p>
