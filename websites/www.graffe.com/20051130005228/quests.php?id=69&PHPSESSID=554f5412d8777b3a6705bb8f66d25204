<HR>
Betti Frostweaver says, "Spectacular artistry! I doubt I could have done better myself. You’ll have to forgive me, I know time is short and I tend to carry on. This is the pattern for the making of a rune sacred to our people. It will be our final test of your craftsmanship and will put many of your skills to the test, but I trust you'll find the finished product to be more than worth the effort. Show Gilthan the silk shawl, he will set you on the path. May Brell always be with you outlander."

<HR>
Gilthan Brittleblade says ‘So, you’ve been chosen to attempt the rune, eh? Been ages since anyone’s even made an attempt. The rune represents the very essence of our people, our culture, and our religion. Take a sea shell runed with enduring breath and a small brick of velium and grind them together in a mortar and pestle. Add water to the powder and model the rune. Fire the rune with water and the best of firing sheets. Show the product to Trademaster Kroven."

[Give Talem Tucter: Velium Etched Rune] 
<HR>
Talem Tucter says, "I’ve heard of your mission, Korteal. I must admit that I had my doubts you’d make it this far. The rune’s creation is nearly impossible for even the most skilled of Coldain craftsmen. You should be exceedingly proud. Many have attempted this feat and nearly all have lacked the skill, faith, patience and persistence that is prerequisite for what destiny holds in store for you. You are now ready to use this pattern to construct the sacred rune’s casing and complete the runed shawl."
