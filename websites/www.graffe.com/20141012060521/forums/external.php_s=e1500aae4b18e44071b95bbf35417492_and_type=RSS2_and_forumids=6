<br />

			Lindsay Lohan is getting serious in her lawsuit against Take-Two Interactive, the publisher of Grand Theft Auto V, replacing a 10-page complaint that at one point misspells her name with a new 67-page complaint that opens by discussing the &quot;common interest among all celebrities, actors, singers, and athletes &#8230; to protect their likeness and personas from misappropriation by unscrupulous merchandisers.&quot;<br />
<br />
The actress has long been litigious on the publicity rights front, suing E-Trade over a commercial that featured a &quot;milkaholic&quot; baby named Lindsay as well as suing Pitbull for rapping, &quot;So, I'm tip-toein', to keep flowin', I got it locked up, like Lindsay Lohan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her latest lawsuit came in July when she objected to a Grand Theft Auto V character named &#8220;Lacey Jonas,&quot; an actress who's involved in a side mission where the protagonist must help her escape the paparazzi.<br />
<br />
Take-Two not only wanted the lawsuit dismissed, but demanded sanctions on grounds &quot;her claim is so legally meritless that it lacks any good-faith basis and can only have been filed for publicity purposes.&quot;<br />
<br />
On Wednesday, Lohan's lawyers reacted to this gambit by stuffing 45 pages of pictured exhibits into an amended complaint, including a photograph of one of the game discs, which features a blond, red bikini&#8211;clad woman holding up the peace sign. According to the amended complaint, the game publisher &quot;used a look-a-like model to evoke the persona and image&quot; of Lohan by imitating a photograph that was once taken of her in 2007.<br />
<br />
The actress still must confront the questionable decision to bring this lawsuit in New York &#8212; a state whose version of a publicity rights statute only concerns works of &quot;advertising&quot; or &quot;trade.&quot; But her lawyers are clearly attempting to overcome that hurdle by now alleging that Take-Two Interactive has been using an image of the blond character (allegedly Lohan) on merchandise like T-shirts and coffee mugs as well as in advertising on billboards, posters, buses, buildings and websites. The lawsuit also aims to counter any talk that the game represents a transformative fair use, which would invoke the free speech protections of the First Amendment.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Defendants were in the business of selling games as opposed to artists displaying artwork in galleries for profit where unauthorized images or portraits of individuals were reproduced in limited editions as opposed to the mass production for commercial promotion and financial gain.&quot;<br />
<br />
Take-Two has also raised a statute-of-limitations defense to Lohan's lawsuit. The defendant points out that the original complaint had alleged that an announcement of the Grand Theft Auto side mission involving Lacey/Lindsay had come in June 2013, more than a year before the complaint was filed.<br />
<br />
Lohan has reacted to this defense by pointing to the &quot;republication&quot; of her image upon the release of the actual video game later that year. According to the amended lawsuit, Take-Two modified her image to fit on the game disc. Lohan now claims that this &quot;modification&quot; should satisfy the exception to the one-year statute of limitation.<br />
<br />
The lawsuit progresses concurrently with former Panama dictator Manuel Noriega's <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/manuel-noriega-call-duty-my-738736" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">action against Activision Blizzard</a> over the use of his persona in Call of Duty: Black Ops II.

			10 October 2014 UKIP leader Nigel Farage defends HIV remarks<br />
<br />
 <br />
UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage has defended comments suggesting immigrants who are HIV-positive should not be allowed to come to the UK.<br />
<br />
In an interview in Newsweek Europe, Mr Farage said he wanted to &quot;control the quantity and quality of people who come... people who do not have HIV&quot;.<br />
<br />
Mr Farage later told the BBC he would extend the ban to &quot;people with tuberculosis too&quot;.<br />
<br />
Campaigners have condemned the UKIP leader's comments.<br />
<br />
The interview was published on the same day that UKIP won its first parliamentary seat in the Clacton by-election and came a close second in the Heywood and Middleton by-election.<br />
<br />
Mr Farage told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK's public services could not cope with extra demand created by people with severe medical conditions coming to Britain.<br />
<br />
&quot;We want people to come who have got trades and skills, but we don't want people who have got criminal records - and we can't afford people with life-threatening diseases,&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
Jump media playerMedia player helpOut of media player. Press enter to return or tab to continue.Nigel Farage: Ban sufferers of life-threatening illness from entering UK<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not think people with life-threatening diseases should be treated by our National Health Service and that is an absolute essential condition for working out a proper immigration policy.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have leading cancer experts in Britain saying the burden now of treating overseas people is leading to huge shortages in the system.&quot;<br />
<br />
He added the UK should follow similar bans he said were in place in the United States and Australia.<br />
<br />
Asked about Mr Farage's comments during a walkabout in Clacton, Mr Carswell called for &quot;an Australian-type immigration system, with control over our borders&quot;.<br />
<br />
About 40% of new HIV diagnoses in 2013 were of people born outside the UK, according to Public Health England.<br />
<br />
Tory defector and UKIP candidate for the parliamentary seat of Rochester and Strood, Mark Reckless, said he did not believe there should be a blanket ban on people with HIV entering the country. <br />
<br />
Open door <br />
He added he believed the Mr Farage's comments, as reported by Newsweek Europe, were misleading.<br />
<br />
In his interview with Newsweek Europe Mr Farage is quoted as saying immigrants from outside Europe are &quot;discriminated against because we have an open door into Europe today&quot;. <br />
<br />
Mr Farage added: &quot;If you're an Indian engineer, say, your chances of admission are limited. UKIP want to control the quantity and quality of people who come.&quot;<br />
<br />
The UKIP leader then went on to define what he meant by &quot;quality&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's simple. That Latvian convicted murderer shouldn't have been allowed here. Yes and people who do not have HIV, to be frank. That's a good start. And people with a skill.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are those words inscribed under the Statue of Liberty? 'Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses . . . ' What you're saying is: 'Bring me your electricians, your merchant bankers and your guys without HIV'.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There are 190 countries in the world,&quot; Mr Farage added, &quot;that operate like that&quot;.<br />
<br />
'Ignorant'<br />
 <br />
In Australia, migrants are required to answer a series of questions about their skills and personal circumstances, for which they are awarded points. <br />
<br />
Applicants need at least 65 points or their request for a visa will be rejected. However, there is no mention of personal health as one of the factors taken into account. <br />
<br />
Those applying for permanent residency in the US or naturalisation need to undergo a medical screening for inadmissible health-related conditions. <br />
<br />
Heywood and Middleton by-election result <br />
Clacton by-election result <br />
The Terrence Higgins Trust said the UKIP leader's remarks displayed a &quot;new level of ignorance&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;The idea that having HIV should be used as a black mark against someone's name is ridiculous and shows an outrageous lack of understanding of the issue,&quot; the charity's chief executive Rosemary Gillespie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;In bracketing those living with the condition with murderers, and suggesting there is no place for them in his vision of Britain, Mr Farage has stooped to a new level of ignorance. He should be truly ashamed,&quot; she added.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>and he's called for corporations to take over parts of the NHS<br />
and so many of his party have been exposed as supporting Eugenics, racist nasty fuckwits, etc etc<br />
<br />
<br />
Middle Class sleep walking into cluster fuck of epic proportions...&quot;<i>bad things cannot happen in Britain, oh noes!&quot;<br />
</i>yeah, <i>riiiiight</i>.<br />
<br />
Boris Johnson + Farage = DISASTER</div>

			LOUISVILLE, Ky., Oct 8 (Reuters) - The developer of a Noah's Ark-based theme park in Kentucky said on Wednesday he would fight for his religious rights after state officials warned he could lose millions in potential tax credits if he hires only people who believe in the biblical flood.<br />
<br />
Ark Encounter, which is slated to open in 2016 in Williamston, Kentucky, is not hiring anyone yet, but its parent company Answers in Genesis asks employees to sign a faith statement including a belief in creationism and the flood.<br />
<br />
State officials and Ark Encounter lawyers have exchanged letters in which the state threatened not to proceed with tax incentives for the park if there was discriminatory hiring practices, a state official confirmed on Wednesday.<br />
<br />
The letters between the parties came to light after the Louisville Courier-Journal and the Lexington Herald-Leader obtained them through open records requests.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're hoping the state takes a hard look at their position, and changes their position so it doesn't go further than this,&quot; Ark Encounter's Executive President Mike Zovath told Reuters.<br />
<br />
Zovath, who is also co-founder of Answers in Genesis, said that if tax incentives for the project are withdrawn because it does not give written assurances the state now seeks, it would violate the organization's First Amendment and state constitutional rights.<br />
<br />
Plans for the park include a wooden replica of the ark during the $73-million first phase and other biblical-themed attractions will be added in phases. The project has been financed through donations and bonds, but Zavath said the state's incentives could help finance future phases.<br />
<br />
In July, Ark Encounter, LLC, received preliminary approval to collect a rebate from a portion of the sales tax revenues generated at its park.<br />
<br />
The tourism tax credit is potentially worth more than $18 million over a 10-year period.<br />
<br />
Zovath said the state has added a requirement about hiring practices that is not part of the existing tourism tax credits law.<br />
<br />
But a state official said on Wednesday that everybody knows laws regarding hiring practices and that the states doesn't need to elaborate them for companies seeking incentives.<br />
<br />
&quot;We expect all of the companies that get tax incentives to obey the law,&quot; Gil Lawson, communications director for the Kentucky Tourism, Arts and Heritage Cabinet, said.

			ROMNEY: I cannot predict precisely what the rate would be at the end of one year. I can tell you that over a period of four years, by a virtue of the polices that we put in place, we get the unemployment rate down to 6 percent, perhaps a little lower.<br />
<br />
Yep, Romney said that if he were elected, and given a chance to implement his bold economic vision, freeing the nation of the scourge that is Obama&#8217;s crushing agenda, the unemployment rate would drop to &#8220;6 percent&#8221; &#8211; maybe even &#8220;a little lower&#8221; &#8211; by the end of 2016.

			PITTSBURGH (NewsRadio1020 KDKA) – A local restaurant is serving up dishes from nations in conflict, and it’s causing a controversy. <br />
<br />
Conflict Kitchen in Schenley Plaza latest menu features Palestinian food.<br />
<br />
The Jewish community of Pittsburgh has taken offense to the cuisine selection, some headlines suggesting it only presents a one sided discussion towards the Middle East.<br />
<br />
The idea of the food hot spot came from the desire to draw attention to cuisine options from counties influences aren’t always represented in the culinary world. <br />
<br />
Jon Rubin, one of the founders of Conflict Kitchen joined Bill Rehkopf on the KDKA Afternoon News to talk about ironically, the controversy its bringing to it’s Schenley Plaza location. <br />
<br />
“The idea was to fill what we felt was a void in Pittsburgh. So we started thinking about what can we serve and how can we have a conversation that’s not already here,” Rubin said, “We realized there has never been a Persian, or an Afghan or a Venezuelan restaurant in the city and that not only have never been those restaurants but, those communities actually exist here.” <br />
<br />
Rubin said it was meant to generate conversations about different cultures and help to learn and respect the influences of others in our area. He wanted people to be able to have a different perspective on countries that we either politically or from the media view as “enemies”. <br />
<br />
Gregg Roman, Director of Community Relations Council at the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, told the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, “Conflict Kitchen’s focus on countries in conflict is honorable, but Palestine is not in conflict with the U.S. The restaurant is stirring up conflict for the sake of trying to be relevant.”<br />
<br />
Rubin isn’t worried by Roman’s opinion explaining he was a participant at a public even the Conflict Kitchen held where he spoke freely and contributed to the different view points expressed, which is the main purpose of the Conflict Kitchen. <br />
<br />
“We are there to be a forum to engage Pittsburghers, or customers in the general public in conversations that they might not ordinarily have,” Rubin said.<br />
<br />
Despite the blow back from some in the community Rubin tells KDKA that this menu seems to already be very popular with their customers. <br />
<br />
“We’ve had 300 people each day, Monday and Tuesday, we opened on Monday and people are super excited and we’ve been very fortunate we’ve got a great base of customers who like to come to all the versions we do,” Rubin said. <br />
<br />
Conflict Kitchen has served food from Afghanistan, North Korea, Iran, Cuba and Venezuela. <br />
<br />
Dishes from nations in conflict typically are served in rotations that last between three and five months.<br />

			‘Dredd’ EP Adi Shankar Reveals ‘Dark Judges’ Miniseries Coming Soon Online<br />
<br />
<br />
Fans still clamor for a sequel to the 2012 action movie starring Karl Urban and Olivia Thirlby<br />
<br />
Judge Dredd fans have spent two years clamoring for a sequel to the epic 2012 action movie “Dredd” to no avail. But executive producer Adi Shankar has taken cinematic justice into his own hands, TheWrap has learned.<br />
<br />
Shankar has spent the last two years creating a top-secret “Dredd” miniseries centering on the Dark Judges to thank the loyal fans who passionately supported the feature.<br />
<br />
Shankar told TheWrap that the project will be released online later this month — and the best part — it will be free.<br />
<br />

<br />
Since Shankar's unofficial “Dredd” project was done off-the-grid, it's technically a part of his popular Bootleg Universe, which includes the short “Punisher: Dirty Laundry” starring Thomas Jane and Ron Perlman, as well as “Venom: Truth in Journalism,” which starred Ryan Kwanten as Spider-Man villain Eddie Brock.<br />
<br />
See video: ‘True Blood’ Star Ryan Kwanten Plays Marvel Villain in New Short Film <br />
<br />
Shankar first alluded to the “Dredd” miniseries in a Reddit “Ask Me Anything” on March 19, 2013, when he described it as a short film. The project has since become a seven-part miniseries.<br />
<br />
Shankar recently thanked “Dredd” fans for their unwavering support in an appreciation video that he taped in honor of Day of Dredd. Watch the video below<br />
<br />
Pete Travis directed “Dredd” from a script by Alex Garland. Karl Urban starred as the titular enforcer, and he was joined by Olivia Thirlby, Lena Headey, Wood Harris and Domhnall Gleeson.<br />

<b><font size="4">21 Numbers That Explain Why The Time To Address Climate Change Is Right Now, Or Maybe Yesterday</font></b><br />
<br />
As this week's viral photo of 35,000 walruses crammed on an Alaskan shore reminds us, the climate crisis is still very much a thing. For those who missed it, a lack of Arctic ice evidently forced the poor creatures to huddle together on a narrow piece of land out of desperation -- normally, they're observed lying more spread out. (The same thing happened last year as well.)<br />
<br />
The plight of the walruses is striking, but climate change is also having all kinds of other, less readily visible effects. It's been shown to produce heat waves around the world, contribute to global wildlife extinction and maybe even reduce gravity.<br />
<br />
Below, we give you 21 numbers to help explain one of the most pressing global issues of our time.<br />
<br />
<b>0.01%</b><br />
<b>Percentage of working climate scientists who reject man-made global warming.</b> According to research by the geologist James Lawrence Powell, among 9,136 scientists who published a combined 2,258 peer-reviewed climate articles between November 2012 and December 2013, just one person rejected the idea that humans are changing Earth's climate. Another review looked at 4,000 peer-reviewed papers on climate change and found that a full 97 percent identified humans as the cause.<br />
<br />
<b>90%</b><br />
<b>Percentage of 108 climate change denial books published between 1982 and 2010 that were not peer-reviewed.</b> The books variously denied that climate change is happening, that humans are at fault, that climate change is having a negative effect on the environment, or any combination of the three. A strong link was also found between the books and conservative think tanks. Seventy-two percent of the books were published by an author or editor with a verifiable affiliation to some such group.<br />
<br />
<b>800,000 to 15,000,000</b><br />
<b>Number of years it's been since carbon dioxide levels were as high as they are now. </b>Not only did humans not exist back then, but the oceans were 100 feet higher than they are today and the world's surface temperature was 11 degrees warmer than it is now.<br />
<br />
<b>1895</b><br />
<b>The year Svante Arrhenius presented a paper describing the impact of increased carbon dioxide on Earth's greenhouse effect. </b>Arrhenius, a Swedish physicist and chemist, hypothesized that changes in concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases could have a significant impact on the planet's surface temperatures. While Arrhenius was not the first to suggest humans might be capable of influencing the climate, his research shows that the basic science of global warming has been understood for more than a century. Yet somehow, there are still public figures in the U.S. debating whether it's real.<br />
<br />
<b>142%</b><br />
<b>The percentage by which atmospheric carbon dioxide has risen since the Industrial Revolution. </b>Concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide, two other important greenhouse gases, have risen 253 percent and 121 percent from pre-Industrial levels, respectively.<br />
<br />
<b>2°C</b><br />
<b>The generally accepted maximum increase in average global temperature that humans can sustain without dangerous consequences. </b>It was proposed as a policy target by the EU in 1996, and again in the Copenhagen Accord of 2009. After the planet warms by more than two degrees Celsius, or roughly 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit, relative to pre-Industrial times -- as it is currently on track to do -- humans could face more of the negative consequences of climate change, such as more frequent food shortages, extreme weather and mass extinction of plant and animal species.<br />
<br />
<b>800,000,000,000</b><br />
<b>Estimated total number of metric tons of carbon dioxide that humans can pump into the atmosphere before average global temperatures rise more than two degrees Celsius.</b> According to a 2013 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 800 billion tons is Earth's &quot;carbon budget,&quot; and we've already used up close to two-thirds of it.<br />
<br />
<b>19.6</b><br />
<b>The number of pounds of carbon dioxide produced by burning one gallon (6.3 pounds) of gasoline.</b> One gallon of diesel fuel does even more damage, releases 22.38 pounds of CO2 into the atmosphere. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that gasoline- and diesel-fueled transportation added 1,522 million metric tons of carbon to the environment in 2013.<br />
<br />
<b>25%</b><br />
<b>The percentage increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere between 1959 and 2013. </b>That's a rise from 316 parts per million to 397 ppm. Over the past two decades, the average annual increase rose from 1.9 ppm to 2.1 ppm.<br />
<br />
<b>400,000</b><br />
<b>Estimated number of annual deaths due to factors influenced by climate change.</b> A 2012 report published by the European nonprofit DARA estimated the average number of fatalities due to &quot;hunger and communicative diseases&quot; related to extreme weather affected by climate change. These conditions appear to hit the children of developing countries particularly hard. A group of doctors recently estimated that up to 7 million people may face premature death as a result of indoor and outdoor air pollution linked to fossil fuel consumption.<br />
<br />
<b>$696,000,000,000</b><br />
<b>Loss in 2010 global GDP estimated to have been caused by climate change.</b> By 2030, researchers estimate that 3.2 percent of annual global GDP will be lost due to climate change, through consequences such as negative effects on crop yields. In developing countries, the loss may be even greater -- up to 11 percent of a nation's GDP.<br />
<br />
<b>1.7 to 3.2</b><br />
<b>The average number of feet by which global sea levels are expected to rise by 2100.</b> This estimate by the IPCC assumes that greenhouse gas emissions will continue to climb at present-day rates. Sea levels around the globe are not expected to rise evenly, and some regions, such as the Mid-Atlantic U.S., are believed to be particularly vulnerable.<br />
<br />
<b>4</b><br />
<b>Number of feet global sea levels could rise if the increasingly unstable West Antarctic ice sheet should collapse. </b>The sheet is already thinning, and one study has called its eventual collapse &quot;unstoppable.&quot; However, while the ice sheet's melt would cause already-rising global sea levels to climb even higher, researchers do not believe that will start any time soon -- in a worst-case scenario, rapid collapse might begin 200 to 1,000 years from now.<br />
<br />
<b>2041</b><br />
<b>Year when it will become too late to stop Miami from slipping below sea level, due to greenhouse gas emissions already built up in the atmosphere.</b> This doesn't mean Miami will actually be underwater by 2041 -- but if emissions continue at their current rates, 2041 is the year there will be no way to reverse the sort of sea-level rise that would end up drowning most of the city.<br />
<br />
<b>11.5°F</b><br />
<b>High-level projection for average global temperature increase by 2100. </b>A low-level projection puts the average global increase at 2 degrees Fahrenheit, but changes in temperature are expected to vary by location.<br />
<br />
<b>0.3°C to 0.5°C</b><br />
<b>Estimated decrease in regional temperature by 2100, if certain presently non-forested areas of Europe are converted to deciduous forest.</b> Though it's unlikely to happen, a 2013 study illustrated the benefits of using vegetation as a weapon against climate change.<br />
<br />
<b>70-plus</b><br />
<b>Number of days in 2011 when the temperature in parts of the U.S. </b>was at least 100 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the National Climate Assessment. Texas, Oklahoma, Arizona and Southern California were particularly hard-hit with scorching hot weather that year, a trend that is expected to increase with climate change.<br />
<br />
<b>14.9</b><br />
<b>Average number of days each year when temperatures in New York City exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit.</b> That's based on data collected between 1870 and 2013. The last year when New York City had only one day of 90-plus temperatures was 1902.<br />
<br />
<b>69</b><br />
<b>High-level estimate of how many days per year New York City will have temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit if emissions aren't curtailed.</b> That's the projection for the year 2100. A low-level estimate puts that number at 18 days. Other cities could face a much hotter future. In Miami, by 2100, almost 200 days out of the year could be 90 degrees or above.<br />
<br />
<b>9</b><br />
<b>Number of the top 10 hottest years on record that have occurred in the 21st century. </b>The other year was 1998, and 2010 was the hottest year of all since record-keeping began in 1880.<br />
<br />
<b>71%</b><br />
<b>The percentage increase in very heavy precipitation events recorded in the Northeastern U.S. between 1958 and 2012.</b> Only Hawaii saw a decrease in precipitation (12 percent) during that time frame. The Midwest experienced a 16 to 37 percent rise in heavy precipitation, and the South saw a 27 percent increase.<br />

			President Barack Obama's claim that he doesn't need congressional authorization for his current war in Iraq and Syria is troubling. The country's founders would pass out upon hearing his claim that the post-9/11 congressional approval of force in 2001 against the perpetrators of those attacks and their abettors and the congressional resolution approving George W. Bush's invasion of Saddam Hussein's Iraq in 2003 give him the current authority for a very different war against very different people. However, Obama is not the first president to believe that he has the rather imperial authority for war by executive fiat.<br />
<br />
Up until 1950, for major conflicts, presidents followed the nation's founders' intent in the U.S. Constitution to obtain a declaration of war from Congress. For the Korean War, however, Harry Truman, really the first imperial president, decided that this vital constitutional requirement was optional. Unfortunately, as I note in my new book -- Recarving Rushmore: Ranking the Presidents on Peace, Prosperity, and Liberty -- once a bad precedent is set, meaning that the chief executive gets away with an unconstitutional act, future presidents will cite it in carrying out their own questionable actions. <br />
<br />
Over American history, that process has thus resulted in an expansion of presidential power much past what the founders had envisioned when they wrote their constitutional blueprint. Thinking of the powerful European monarchs of the day, who took their countries to war on a whim and let the costs in blood and treasure fall to their unfortunate citizens, the founders wanted an executive with severely restricted powers. Congress was to be the dominant branch of government, and the executive's role merely was to narrowly execute and enforce laws passed by that body. Even the president's commander-in-chief role, much abused by modern chief executives, was to be restricted narrowly to commanding the U.S. military in battle. In fact, contrary to the conventional belief in Washington and among the American public, the Constitution gives most of the powers in defense and foreign affairs to the Congress, not to the president. The erroneous notion that the chief executive is the &quot;sole organ of American foreign policy,&quot; derives from the non-binding part of a Supreme Court decision in the 1930s (that is, fairly recently). <br />
<br />
In the Constitution, the founders signaled their intent for Congress to approve even minor uses of force by the United States. The document says that Congress will issue letters of marque and reprisal. At the time, letters of marque were issued to private ship captains to raid an enemy nation's commerce. <br />
<br />
So it is curious from his past behavior that Obama, a constitutional lawyer, believes that if he avoids putting &quot;combat troops&quot; on the ground -- defining this narrowly to exclude Special Forces hunting terrorists and American military trainers of local forces -- and limits his attacks to air strikes, it's not a real war that would require congressional approval. His criterion seems to be that if no Americans would be killed, it's not a &quot;war&quot; that the Congress needs to bother with authorizing. Yet aircraft can get shot down or malfunction and pilots can be captured or killed. Also, the people being bombed would probably call it a war, and so the people's representatives in Congress might want to comment on whether the United States should be in a state of hostilities with them.<br />
<br />
The people's representatives don't always make the right decision -- as they didn't in President James Madison's pointless War of 1812, James Polk's war of aggression against the weaker Mexico to steal its land, William McKinley's colonial Spanish-American War, or Woodrow Wilson's ruining of the twentieth century by American entry into World War I -- but they should at least get to vote, as the nation's founders intended and the Constitution states.

			Police officers in Dubai will soon be able to identify suspects wanted for crimes just by looking at them.<br />
<br />
Using Google Glass and a custom-developed facial recognition software, Dubai police will be able to capture photos of people around them and search their faces in a database of people wanted for crimes, according to a recent Reuters report. When a match is made in the database, the Glass device will receive a notification.<br />
<br />
Although the project will initially be rolled out to traffic police, the devices will eventually be given to detectives as well, according to Reuters.<br />
<br />
Facial recognition for Glass seems like a dream tool for law enforcement, especially considering that Glass now provides native support for blink-enabled control of the camera. With the Wink feature, the Glass unit takes photos when the user winks. If police officers using the device choose to activate the Wink feature, they could take photos without using their hands or voice commands. Theoretically, everyone within the vicinity of a police officer could be subjected to a check for any connection to unpaid parking tickets or outstanding warrants, and they'll have no idea if their photos are being taken or their faces are being searched in a database.<br />
<br />
What's particularly interesting about the project is that facial recognition technology is banned by the Google Glass developer policy. After a company called FacialNetwork showcased its own facial recognition app for Glass last year, Google clarified that the app violated its policy. The section of the policy that addresses such technology seems to disqualify the Dubai police force's plan for Glass:<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			Don't use the camera or microphone to cross-reference and immediately present personal information identifying anyone other than the user, including use cases such as facial recognition and voice print. Glassware that do this will not be approved at this time.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>Google also addressed privacy concerns regarding facial recognition with Glass in March, mentioning it in a blog post debunking common myths about the technology.<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			<b>Myth 5: Glass does facial recognition (and other dodgy things)</b> Nope. That’s not true. As we’ve said before, regardless of technological feasibility, we made the decision based on feedback not to release or even distribute facial recognition Glassware unless we could properly address the many issues raised by that kind of feature. And just because a weird application is created, doesn’t mean it’ll get distributed in our MyGlass store. We manually approve all the apps that appear there and have several measures in place (from developer policies and screenlocks to warning interstitials) to help protect people’s security on the device.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>The Dubai police force will reportedly use its own custom software for facial recognition and discovery in the database, so it’s unclear whether its application actually violates the Glass policy. If it does, though, Google might not be able to do anything about it. If the Dubai police force developed it only for internal use, then the software probably won't go near the MyGlass store. That blog post debunking the myth says that it will not &quot;release or even distribute facial recognition Glassware.&quot; But if someone develops their own system and uses it independently, there's not much Google can do to stop it.<br />
<br />
I've reached out to Google for clarification on how its facial recognition policy might apply to the reported project in Dubai, and will update this story when I hear back.

			Red Bull GmbH agreed on Thursday to pay more than $13 million to settle a proposed class action lawsuit that alleges false advertising of its energy drinks, according to Law360.<br />
<br />
If the proposed settlement is passed by the court, Red Bull would be required to pay $6.5 million into a settlement fund within seven days.<br />
<br />
The settlement could include millions of individuals who purchased at least one Red Bull can over the past 10 years, offering class members the option of a $10 cash reimbursement or two free Red Bull products with an approximate retail value of $15 (Red Bull would cover shipping costs).<br />
<br />
Red Bull sent BevNET an email with the following statement:<br />
<br />
“Red Bull settled the lawsuit to avoid the cost and distraction of litigation. However, Red Bull maintains that its marketing and labeling have always been truthful and accurate, and denies any and all wrongdoing or liability.”<br />
<br />
The plaintiff representing the class, Benjamin Careathers, said he had been drinking Red Bull since 2002 as part of the lawsuit he filed on Jan. 16, 2013 in U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York. <b>The suit argues that Red Bull misleads consumers about the superiority of its products with its slogan “Red Bull gives you wings” and its claims of increased performance, concentration and reaction speed, to name a few.</b> This deception is proliferated through the company’s advertising on television, the Internet, social media and events, athlete endorsers, glossy print brochures, marketing campaigns and its slogan-promoting Red Bull Flugtag series, according to the suit.<br />
<br />
“Such deceptive conduct and practices mean that [Red Bull’s] advertising and marketing is not just ‘puffery,’ but is instead deceptive and fraudulent and is therefore actionable,” the suit says.<br />
<br />
The class action cites articles by The New York Times, Nutrition Reviews and the European Food Safety Authority Journal, which indicate that energy drinks provide their boost through caffeine alone, not guarana or any other ingredient.<br />
<br />
The suit says that a 7 oz. cup of drip coffee contains approximately 115 to 175 milligrams of caffeine, depending on the blend, and a 12 oz. serving of Starbucks coffee costs $1.85 and “would contain far more caffeine than a regular serving of Red Bull.” An 8.4 oz. can of Red Bull contains 80 milligrams of caffeine.<br />
<br />
“Even though there is a lack of genuine scientific support for a claim that Red Bull branded energy drinks provide any more benefit to a consumer than a cup of coffee, the Red Bull defendants persistently and pervasively market their product as a superior source of ‘energy’ worthy of a premium price over a cup of coffee or other sources of caffeine,” the suit says.<br />
<br />
Despite Red Bull’s denial of wrongdoing, the company has voluntarily withdrawn and revised marketing claims challenged in court, according to the plaintiff’s motion.<br />
<br />
Plaintiffs David Wolf and Miguel Almaraz made similar allegations in a lawsuit filed in California federal and later transferred to New York, Law360 writes.<br />
<br />
BevNET spoke with August T. Horvath, a partner with the law firm Kelley Drye, who focuses his practice on advertising law and antitrust matters. While Horvath didn’t offer an opinion on the potential settlement, he said the case features difficult claims from the plaintiff. He posed the following questions about the complaint:<br />
<br />
<ul><li style="">Did Red Bull really make the alleged claims?</li><li style="">How many consumers actually saw the claims?</li><li style="">How many consumers believed the claims?</li><li style="">How many people consumed the product because of one of the aforementioned claims, and not for some other reason?</li></ul><br />
<br />
“As with any class action,” Horvath said, “there’s a lot to prove before you can get to the end.”

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Talking over people is about the most rude as hell social faux pas someone can commit IMO. I would rather have them fuck my sister behind my back than talk over me or someone else or interrupt a conversation, the only time that should happen is if it is a life threatening event that had to be taken care of right then, such as your water broke or an appendix burst or the building is on fire. I had to have a come to Jesus meeting with a new hire that kept doing this, even when their apparently urgent information was unrelated to the conversation in place. And while I gave the person room to save face, other people do this same shit all the time, in particular my relatives who I happen to not be able to divorce easily. I don't get why people think that not listening and talking over people is in any way acceptable behavior, especially as an adult where social cues should be recognized. Hell, even the autistic people that are common in engineering pick up on this as a learned behavior, yet this person just wasn't getting on the same page to the point where I had to break the pretense of being nice about communicating how much they should fuck off with that behavior permanently. Thing is, aside from this, the person is exceptional and very promising, so I hope to fucking Christ that they make a sincere effort to change their behavior otherwise I will have to do things I don't want to.</div>
