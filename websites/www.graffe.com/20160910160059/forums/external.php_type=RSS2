<br />
John Smedley, formerly of SoE is heading the company.  When I first heard that, I was a bit leery, but they had a twitch stream with CohhCarnage and Patrick Rothfuss (both of whom are part of the dev team) and this looks fairly impressive.<br />

The stream is on YouTube here:<br />

Sounds almost like a descendant of Dwarf Fortress, with some EQ Next living world ideas thrown in (where races interact with each other without player intervention).  You can play it on your own server with up to 200 people, or I'm guessing there will be official servers, but I haven't heard for sure.<br />

I'm impressed so far.</div>

		<hr />
		
			The British decision to leave the European Union in the wake of the Brexit referendum has given renewed impetus to the idea that the EU should have its own army.<br />
<br />
The UK - by far the most capable European military player, along with France - has always been a brake on such an idea, fearing unnecessary duplication with Nato. <br />
<br />
The UK went along with EU plans up to a point. A British army light mechanised infantry unit (2nd Battalion the Yorkshire regiment) currently forms the core of one of the EU's 1,500-strong battle groups: a rapid-reaction force capable of being deployed to a crisis zone at short notice.<br />
<br />
In fact over recent years the UK has also stepped up defence co-operation with France - a natural partner, given the scale of their military ambitions. <br />
<br />
Indeed, defence was the sector in which the UK was perhaps the strongest EU player, in part to compensate for Britain's absence from other core issues of European business - the common currency, the project for ever greater political union and so on. <br />
<br />
But Britain's view was that EU defence co-operation should only go so far. Nothing should be done to reduce the primacy of Nato and money should not be wasted on duplicating things that the transatlantic alliance was already doing. <br />
<br />
This - broadly speaking - is the US view too. <br />
<br />
What matters in Washington is European defence spending and capability. The willingness (or as he would see it unwillingness) of America's European partners to pay more for defence is a key element in the Republican candidate Donald Trump's critique of Nato.<br />
<br />
But now, with the UK in the departure lounge for EU exit, a number of European leaders are reviving the idea of a stronger EU defence identity - summed up in the phrase, &quot;a European army&quot;.<br />
<br />
This has long been the ambition of the most ardent eurocrats. Back in March 2015, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker declared that a common European army was needed to address the problem that the EU, as an international player, was not &quot;taken entirely seriously&quot; in the world - not least in Moscow.<br />
<br />
The Brexit vote has opened the floodgates to the idea. The prime ministers of Hungary and the Czech Republic have urged the EU to build its own army. Only this week, German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen, who was visiting Lithuania, declared that &quot;it's time to move forward to a European defence union which is basically a 'Schengen of defence'.&quot;<br />
<br />
This reference to &quot;Schengen&quot;, the EU's open borders agreement, prompted one defence expert I know to comment wryly that it was pretty rich to talk about a &quot;Schengen of defence&quot; when Schengen had effectively allowed thousands of refugees to &quot;invade&quot; EU territory. <br />
<br />
But an EU army is back on the agenda and it is unlikely to go away. <br />
<b><br />
EU setbacks</b><br />
<br />
The UK's Brexit vote was a blow to the EU's sense of itself. <br />
<br />
The EU has already been battered by its failures to deal adequately with a series of crises: from the Greek bailout to the wave of refugees heading for Europe's shores. It is perhaps understandable that the EU's advocates are looking to bolster its standing by moving ahead in other areas.<br />
<br />
But it is crucial to realise that there is more politics here than strategic thought. What exactly does &quot;a European army&quot; mean? Sending soldiers into harm's way is perhaps the ultimate sovereign decision a government can take. <br />
<br />
Countries enter into alliances like Nato (or indeed the EU itself) because pooling resources provides greater capability and thus security. <br />
<br />
But there is no Nato army as such, just national forces integrated into a common command structure. They only become Nato forces in the event of a conflict. <br />
<br />
Sections of the British press that hyperventilate whenever the idea of an EU army comes up miss this essential point: that the term &quot;EU army&quot; is largely meaningless.<br />
<br />
But more European defence there will be. There is already a patchwork of defence arrangements - some bilateral, some multilateral, some in the EU and many involving Nato as a whole. <br />
<br />
If this leads to more defence and better defence it is probably a good thing. If it leads to political posturing and duplication then the sceptics may be right - and the only person who may be happy is Russian President Vladimir Putin, watching it all from the Kremlin.

Southern Health: New job for ex-boss Katrina Percy 'did not exist'<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Tim Smart said no other candidates were considered for the post<br />
<br />
The chief executive who resigned as the head of a troubled mental health trust had a new £240,000-a-year job created for her, the BBC has learned. <br />
<br />
Katrina Percy faced sustained calls to resign over Southern Health's failure to investigate hundreds of deaths. <br />
<br />
The BBC has now discovered her new job did not exist previously and she was the only candidate for it. <br />
<br />
Ms Percy faced months of criticism for the way her trust failed to investigate patient deaths. <br />
<br />
In June, the trust accepted responsibility for the death of 18-year-old Connor Sparrowhawk, who drowned in a bath at Slade House in Oxford.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ms Percy resigned last week but went straight into a new role at the trust on the same salary of £240,000 a year, including pension benefits. <br />
<br />
Trust Chairman Tim Smart, who has been in his post for four months, said it did not advertise the role but that the work the job entails - giving strategic advice to GPs - &quot;needed to be done&quot;, describing Ms Percy as &quot;uniquely qualified&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dr Maureen Rickman, whose sister died while in Southern Health's care, called the move &quot;completely outrageous&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;She should be axed from Southern Health altogether, end of,&quot; she said. <br />
<br />
&quot;There shouldn't be a sideways move, that shouldn't be an option at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Southern Health said it had addressed the failings highlighted in a series of reports and that patients were now safe. <br />
<br />
Mr Smart said: &quot;I can unequivocally look you in the eye and say every member of staff that I have met who works on the front line is putting patient safety and the quality of care first.&quot;<br />
<br />
The trust is currently being investigated by the Health and Safety Executive over the earlier deaths of patients. <br />
<br />
'Very strange'<br />
<br />
Mark Aspinall, who resigned as one of the trust's 13 public governors following a critical report by the Care Quality Commission in April, said it seemed &quot;very strange&quot; the new role for Ms Percy had been created.<br />
<br />
&quot;The health service is usually very rigorous in terms of recruitment, so the idea that a new role has been created purely to move Katrina sideways seems very surprising.<br />
<br />
&quot;The whole board has to look at itself and the policies it has put in place that have led to reports that have slated leadership at the trust, and the failures to investigate the deaths of patients in its care. <br />
<br />
&quot;But Katrina should have taken responsibility for this a long time ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
Former health minister Norman Lamb has already called for Southern Health to reconsider its decision to create the role.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't have a difficulty with someone being well paid for a highly-responsible job, but on the proviso that there is accountability with it and that, if things go wrong, you take responsibility for that and you step down ultimately.&quot;<br />

			Lost Doctor Who adventure to return in animated form<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Power of the Daleks was first broadcast from 5 November to 10 December 1966 <br />
<br />
A &quot;lost&quot; Doctor Who adventure from 1966 whose original master tapes were wiped in the 1970s is to be released in animated form, the BBC has confirmed.<br />
<br />
The animated makeover of The Power of the Daleks is based on film clips, surviving photographs and audio recordings featuring the original cast.<br />
<br />
The six-part story was the first full outing of Patrick Troughton's Doctor.<br />
<br />
It will be available on 5 November at 17:50 GMT on BBC Store, 50 years to the minute after its broadcast on BBC One.<br />
<br />
The adventure sees the newly regenerated time-traveller battling the evil Daleks with his companions Polly and Ben.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Power of the Daleks is being produced by the same team behind the animated version of a lost Dad's Army episode that was released on BBC Store in February.<br />
<br />
A special screening of the first three episodes will take place at BFI Southbank in London on 5 November, with a DVD release to follow on 21 November.<br />
<br />
Charles Norton, producer and director of the black-and-white animation, said it was &quot;the most ambitious Doctor Who archive restoration ever attempted&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Intelligent, suspenseful and magnificently staged, Power of the Daleks is one of the great lost classics of 1960s television,&quot; he added.

In a statement Monday, Oregon Parks and Recreation Department spokesman Chris Havel said that the agency and state police were reviewing the incident and deciding how to respond. <br />
<br />
Havel told NBC News that possible penalties were still unclear, though breaking park rules can carry a minimum fine of $435. <br />
<br />
The department initially believed the formation's collapse was natural, saying in a Sept. 1 Facebook post that visitors were fortunate that no one was injured and that the event should serve &quot;as a sobering reminder of the ever present dangers of our fragile coastal rocks and cliffs.&quot; <br />
<br />
Then department officials saw a video that had been posted on Aug. 29 by David Kalas. <br />
<br />
Kalas, 19, had visited Cape Kiwanda Natural Area earlier that day with two friends, including an aspiring videographer who brought a drone along to capture the coast's scenery. <br />
<br />
From a football field away they saw a group of eight to 10 people gather around the formation, known as Duckbill, Kalas told NBC News. <br />
<br />
&quot;They were trying to push it over,&quot; he said. &quot;We thought nothing of it. It's sturdy. It's not going to break.&quot; <br />
<br />
Once the formation began wobbling, Kalas said, he and his friends sprinted over and confronted the group. <br />
<br />
&quot;They said one of their friends had broken their legs,&quot; he said, adding that the group described it as a &quot;giant safety hazard.&quot; <br />
<br />
He said the group claimed that &quot;they did a favor by knocking the rock down.&quot; <br />
<br />
The formation was perched behind a fence in an area the the parks department pleaded with visitors not to cross: Since 2009, seven people have died when the park's sandstone cliffs crumbled and they fell into the ocean or onto rocks. <br />
<br />
Still, climbing atop Duckbill and snapping a photo was a favorite pastime, and on Monday its popularity was still on full display. Instagram users started a hashtag — #ripthatpnwrock — and posted photos depicting their favorite treacherous poses, including one showing a bride and groom embracing. <br />
<br />
In another, an Instagram user scolded the apparent vandals for their &quot;lack of respect.&quot; <br />
<br />
Cape Kiwanda, the post noted, &quot;took thousands of years to make through the wind and weather of the Oregon coast. People want to blame others who came to enjoy this place for causing its destruction over time, but this was a blatant and disgusting act that has taken yet another landmark away. Please be respectful to the places you enjoy.&quot;

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Ordered Pods for my Reef tank through Amazon on Thursday Morning. They are living organisms. I paid about $20 for expedited shipping. <br />
<br />
I get the information about shipping on Thursday evening that they are going to be delivered Wednesday, but not yet picked up by the carrier. That is no bueno. I e-mail them and explain that I think it should be shipped via expedited shipping, or sent after Labor Day weekend.<br />
<br />
They e-mail me back the following morning, Friday. &quot;What makes you think it will take a week for them to arrive? Thanks!&quot;<br />
<br />
Additional correspondance as follows:<br />
<br />
<i>9/2: Both amazon and the tracking number state a tuesday/wednesday delivery.<br />
__<br />
9/3: The tracking information indicates that the package is still sitting in Denver.  I hope they are still alive when they get here.<br />
__<br />
9/3: It is not that I doubt the USPS to honor a shipping guideline, nor the unexplainable lack of updates from both USPS tracking as well as Amazon after sourcing in Denver, but am I going to get a response regarding this?<br />
<br />
I didnt receive the package delivered today, Saturday as was previously advised in prior correspondance, but do you see something which I do not in your site of tracking in order to indicate a Saturday delivery?<br />
<br />
__<br />
9/4: After initial response on Friday, I tried contacting you 3 different times. Am i being ignored until the package arrives, or is it indefinite?<br />
<br />
__<br />
Re 9/4: Hi Tinth,<br />
<br />
So sorry, I have been moving from Texas to Colorado this weekend. Just now getting settled. I assure you nobody has been ignoring you but we have also not received any more messages from you via Amazon.<br />
<br />
What can I help you with?<br />
<br />
____<br />
<br />
TO BE FRANK, THIS IS GETTING RIDICULOUS. I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO WORD MY QUESTION, SO I AM GOING TO DESIRE A TELEPHONE CALL DIRECTLY TO ME SO WE CAN WORK THIS OUT. MY TELEPHONE # IS 909 222 3390. PLEASE CALL ME IMMEDIATELY. I DO NOT CARE WHAT TIME IT IS WHEN YOU CALL.<br />
<br />
Tinthalas Tigris</i><br />
<br />
Not two minutes later he calls me and asks, &quot;Hello, is this Tinthalas?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, this is.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, what is the problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
I unleash. I unleash and unleash and unleash. I explain everything I did above just the same and he states he is sorry, he didn't get any of the other e-mails (well, then why the fuck did you not research my question for the ones you responded to?), and he guarantees they will be fine when they arrive, or he will send replacements to me free of charge. <br />
<br />
<br />
Well, at least I have him recorded, as well as his phone number. So Fuck it if he doesn't honor it.</div>

			<title>Fuck Kaiser Permanente (Medical Group)</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Since before I was born, I have gone to the same medical group. Kaiser Permanente of Southern California. I always saw it as a wonderful place. I would hear people say they had bad experiences there, but never knew it. For me, having vision and breathing difficulties, I never really understood where these problems could come from. <br />
<br />
I had Kaiser through my parent's medical coverage. I had Kaiser when I got my first job with health benefits, and every full-time job that I have held has come with Kaiser coverage. I would call for appointments, and see the doctor they selected, or the doctor given to me through Emergency or Urgent care. WHen I fell off the ladder in March, I went to Kaiser. Sometimes I would get sent through a minor rigamarole of one nurse referring me to the wrong location, and another person sending me to the wrong place to help resolve a problem.<br />
<br />
My 3 children were all born at Kaiser. My wife had 2 terrible deliveries, and one amazing delivery (the last one). Nothing permanently terrible, but the first two were downright scary. <br />
<br />
Despite smoking cigarettes for the last 16 years, I have always been in relatively fantastic health. Some little things here and there have caused me to go in to get checked out from back pains to a flu that seemed a little strong, and I needed a doctor's notice for my employer for a couple days off, but since Friday, I have had a hell of a terrible experience with them. <br />
<br />
Thursday, the 25th of August, I developed a strange pain in my left wrist, and my lymphnodes were swollen in my throat. I figured it would go away on its own, like most shit like this does - minor cold or flu, and my body running its systems in the way it should. <br />
<br />
Wednesday, August 31st, the pain vanishes from my wrist. Thursday, September 1st, the pain appears in my right wrist, and also my abdominals, my thighs, and my left foot. <br />
<br />
Friday, it is even worse. i wake up at 1am with terribly fierce chills. I put 6 blankets on me and am still freezing. I make an appointment to see a doctor, and go to work. When I get to the doctor, not my regular doctor, she says she'll order labs, xrays, etc, and call me about the results. She says, if I am informed by her that I have a blood infection, I must get to the Fontana Hospital immediately. That doesn't mean that what I have no is a blood infection, just that in case that is what she tells me, I am to go to Fontana, and asks me if I understand this. Yep. I do. She says, in the mean time, to manage the pain, to pick up the prescription of Ibuprofen from the Pharmacy. They will contact me through the website when it is ready. She will be on call all weekend to let me know my results. <br />
<br />
<br />
So, I get blood drawn (10 minute procedure, the girls in the lab all watch, because they've never seen so many tests done at once). They have to use a special needle and a special applicator which they don't normally do, because they have to remember where it is, and then do so. They ask me if I can walk after all this blood. I'm fine in that respect. No worries there. I go and get the x-ray, and I go pee in a cup. <br />
<br />
I get e-mails of test results (computer generated) in less than an hour. Nothing outside of normal parameters. No X-ray info. no pee info. No call from the doctor (like she said she would). The pain isn't too bad at this point, but I went in initially, just in case. I go to sleep Friday night with no phone call from the doctor. <br />
<br />
Saturday morning, the pain is much worse, and is now all over my body. I have never had cold-sores in my life, but now the interior of my mouth is riddled with them. <br />
<br />
I go to the webpage for Kaiser, and more test results are in. No message from my doctor. No message from the Fontana location. Nothing. I e-mail my doctor about what I should do, and that I haven't been contacted about the Ibuprofen prescription. <br />
<br />
This morning, I have more cold-sores, and the pain is even worse, all throughout my body. <br />
<br />
I start making phone calls. No one has any information they can access. I try to get my prescription filled through the webpage. None of the local pharmacies are open this weekend. Fucking great. So I select the Fontana pharmacy (20 miles away). They cannot get me my prescription until Tuesday -- WHAT THE FUCK?! THEY'RE OPEN 24/7!!!!!!! <br />
<br />
I start making livid phone calls. Everyone says they'll help me. They cold transfer me to places that are closed, from pharmacy to regional, to nurse hot-line. Some of the transfers just turn into hang-ups. <br />
<br />
Finally, I get through to a gal who calls in the prescription to the pharmacist back-line who says to go in and get the prescription. It is 3:40, and she says that my prescription was approved at 3:30pm. --- WHAT THE FUCK?! WHEN THE HELL DID THIS HAPPEN?<br />
<br />
So I get from her, that I need to go to Medical Building 5, the Pharmacy is there, and I will have my prescription ready immediately. <br />
<br />
I drive to Fontana. There is no building 5 at the main hospital.. This is a humungous city block of a hospital, with satellite entities around it for various services. I  park in the parking lot, and start walking. I find a map/directory with building number 5 on it --- Behavioral Health. <i>You have got to be kidding me. Did they do what I now think they did?</i><br />
<br />
I walk carefully across the street to the Mental Health facility, and it is closed. The door opens, and I carefully walk into the reception desk, and a man in his 50s is on the phone talking to someone about their addiction. <i>Oh shit. This is <b>exactly</b> what I think is happening</i><br />
<br />
I turn my phone recorder on, and set my head set microphone a little higher. I wait for the man to end his phone call and delicately ask, &quot;I'm looking for the Pharmacy.&quot;<br />
<br />
He gives me a strange look, scratches his chin and says, &quot;There is no Pharmacy here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't think there was one, but I was directed to building number 5 when I called the hotline earlier, for which building to find the 24/7 Pharmacy at.&quot;<br />
<br />
This guy pauses, and then directs me to the main hospital building. No mention of Number 5. I walk all the way back to the main hospital, into the place he tells me to, and then hand them my card and simply say, &quot; I'm here to pickup my Ibuprofen.&quot; 5 minutes later, my name is called and I pay $15 for Ibuprofen. <br />
<br />
Thank god that part was simple enough, but the literal BULLSHIT I had to go through for FUCKING IBUPROFEN is ridiculous. <br />
<br />
I'd have just bought a bottle of 200mg Motrin, but those things have adulterants in them to make you vomit if you take more than 2, and I didn't want to have that shit either. <br />
<br />
I feel great, by comparison, despite being numb, now. I still have pain, but my god is it more manageable. Still waiting on the fucking followup e-mail from the doctor that saw me to tell me what the fuck I have.</div>
