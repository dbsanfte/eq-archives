<br><ul>November 05, 2003 3:00 am <br><BR>
------------------------------<BR>
<p>** Quests, Adventures and Encounters ** </p><BR>
<p>- We have added one more new LDoN raid to Stormhammer. This raid was created<BR>
  with Elemental capable characters in mind. </p><BR>
<p>- Changed the minimum required number of group members to request an adventure<BR>
  from 4 to 3. </p><BR>
<p>- We have increased the consolation prize on level 65 hard adventures from<BR>
  19 to 26 to match the increase in reward points for success (raised from 76<BR>
  to 105 with the last update). </p><BR>
<p>- Verrell Cogswin can help convert red dragon scales into green dragon scales. </p><BR>
<p>- Fixed the Undead and Fire event in the Plane of Time. There was a bug that<BR>
  could cause some of the minions to fail to spawn. </p><BR>
<p>- Raotin Teawel will always give out the correct robe for completion of his<BR>
  quest. </p><BR>
<p>- Thought Destroyer has returned to the Plane of Hate. </p><BR>
<p>- Check with the Town Crier of your home town for news. There is information<BR>
  about the recent activities of the Wayfarers that should prove interesting. </p><BR>
<p>- We have made some improvements to the Plane of Air avatar rings. We have<BR>
  added a random interval to the respawn time of the Plane of Air avatar rings,<BR>
  placed apparitions at the avatar spawns so that it is possible to tell when<BR>
  the event is available, and the Avatar of Smoke will now respawn properly. </p><BR>
<p>- The Mujaki event in Plane of Nightmares was completely rewritten. It should<BR>
  now be a lot more intelligent about where it sends players. </p><BR>
<p>- Increased the number of items found at the end of a successful LDoN raid. </p><BR>
<p><br><BR>
  ** Skills and Alternate Advancement ** </p><BR>
<p>- Channeling Focus was not giving bards the proper reduction to the chance<BR>
  of missing a note. It is now fixed and gives messages to indicate when it is<BR>
  has helped. </p><BR>
<p>- Corrected a problem that was causing Alternate Advancement buff duration<BR>
  increase abilities and duration focus effects to negatively affect lull spells. </p><BR>
<p>- We have fixed a bug that could cause pick pocketed items to not show up<BR>
  on your cursor until you zone. This could also sometimes cause the client to<BR>
  crash. </p><BR>
<p>- Added /stoptracking command so that you no longer have to re-open the track<BR>
  window and hit cancel if you want to cancel your tracking quickly. </p><BR>
<p>- Activated AAs from Planes of Power were not working if the user did not<BR>
  have Shadows of Luclin registered. This has been fixed. </p><BR>
<p><br><BR>
  ** Spells and Pets ** </p><BR>
<p>- The Aura of Pain Recourse can no longer be removed by Radiant Cure. </p><BR>
<p>- When the character changes size (through illusion), other players will no<BR>
  longer see the mounted player separate from their horse. </p><BR>
<p>- Magician Pets will no longer attack the caster who summoned them. </p><BR>
<p>- Hitting your own pet while in a PVP area or while you have the PK flag on<BR>
  will no longer kill it. </p><BR>
<p>- Cataclysm of Ro has had its movement rate bonus removed to fix a stacking<BR>
  issue with the Selo's line of movement rate songs. </p><BR>
<p>- Cassindra's Chant of Clarity and Cassindra's Chorus of Clarity now lasts<BR>
  3 ticks instead of being instant. <br><BR>
    <br><BR>
    - Cloak of Luclin, Cloak of the Akheva and Frostreaver's Blessing will no<BR>
    longer be overwritten by Call of the Rathe. <br><BR>
    <br><BR>
    - There are still some issues with Frostreaver's blessing being overwritten<BR>
    by some spells. We are aware of the issue and hope to get it resolved soon. </p><BR>
<p>- Protection of the Cabbage, Protection of the Glades and Protection of the<BR>
  Nine will block Temperance, Aegolism and Virtue. </p><BR>
<p>- Ice Flame of E`ci now has the standard 2.5 second recast time. </p><BR>
<p>-Reclaim energy should now function properly on the pet summoned by Child<BR>
  of Bertoxxulous. <br><BR>
    <br><BR>
    -Beastlord warders focused by Summoner's boon should now look as they should. </p><BR>
<p><br><BR>
  ** Interface ** </p><BR>
<p>- We have added the consider color to the Target window. The art used to display<BR>
  the consider color can be removed or edited via XML by custom skins. </p><BR>
<p>- We have also added a 3D target indicator. The ring color indicates the con<BR>
  color of the target. This can be turned off in the Options window. A new settings<BR>
  file in the UI folder can be edited by players to customize the appearance<BR>
  of the indicator, including different animated textures for each con color<BR>
  and other interesting settings. </p><BR>
<p>- Added /fontface command (usage /fontface &lt;fontname&gt;, e.g. /fontface<BR>
  Courier). This will change, on the fly, the fonts used by the interface (and<BR>
  over character's heads). Fonts can also be selected in the General Options<BR>
  page. </p><BR>
<p>- Added /tell windows. Each time you get a &quot;tell&quot; from a new character,<BR>
  a new chat window would open. That window will only display &quot;tells&quot; from<BR>
  the particular character, and any message sent from the chat window would automatically<BR>
  be sent as a &quot;tell&quot; to that character. You can turn this option on<BR>
  and off in the Options window. If you have the maximum number of chat windows<BR>
  open when a new tell is received, the tell will go to the main chat window </p><BR>
<p>- Temporary pets will no longer send their buffs to the pet window. Generally<BR>
  they have none, and they would replace the buffs of any standard pet. </p><BR>
<p>- The buff display portion of the pet window will now fade. </p><BR>
<p>- The Auto-inventory area of the Inventory window now fades with the parent<BR>
  window. </p><BR>
<p>- The Dump button in raid window now creates the proper, non-blank, file. </p><BR>
<p>- We have also added time-stamp to Raid Dump output file. </p><BR>
<p>- Pop-up dialogs no longer close when you press ESC. This will prevent the<BR>
  rez dialog from being closed accidentally. </p><BR>
<p>- Lay on Hands will no longer &quot;gray out&quot; the Inspect and Open hot<BR>
  keys in the Hotbutton window. This was fixed earlier in the Actions window,<BR>
  but now it is fixed in the Hotbutton window as well. </p><BR>
<p>- Alt-tabbing in and out of EQ should no longer cause mouse issues. </p><BR>
<p>- Fixed a bug that sometimes left charmed pets health bar in the group window<BR>
  after the owner of that pet is killed. </p><BR>
<p>- Find trader can now be cancelled in bazaar. </p><BR>
<p><br><BR>
  ** Items ** </p><BR>
<p>- The Copper Medal of Rapture now gives a bonus to Int. instead of Wis. </p><BR>
<p><br><BR>
  ** For the New Player ** </p><BR>
<p>- Left-clicking on an NPC prints out a message indicating what type of NPC<BR>
  they are and indicating that you should right-click on them. This message can<BR>
  be turned off in the Options window. </p><BR>
<p>- New characters will now start with a bag. </p><BR>
<p>- Added a tip window that pops up when you invoke the Quantity window that<BR>
  explains the use of Shift and Control when selecting items. </p><BR>
<p>- All characters will gain a Sense Heading skill of 200, if it was below 200.<BR>
  All new characters will start with a Sense Heading of 200. </p><BR>
<p><br><BR>
  ** Miscellaneous ** </p><BR>
<p>- Explore mode works properly again. </p><BR>
<p><br><BR>
  ** UI Files ** </p><BR>

*** REMINDER! - If you notice augmentations on your cursor, you MUST place those items into your inventory BEFORE you zone. If you zone with those items on your cursor, they will disappear!<BR>
<BR>
- Corrected the slot types for some augmentations that were given the wrong slots during the update last night.<BR>
<BR>
- Reverted some of the existing LDoN armor that was changed in the update last night. Those armor pieces will remain as they were, but they will no longer be available. New armor pieces will replace them.<BR>
<BR>
- Returned Warders to their proper sizes.<BR>
<BR>
- Also returned wolves and tigers in The Plane of Growth and the Emerald Jungle to their proper sizes.<BR>
<BR>
- Two items we forgot to mention in the update message yesterday.<BR>
- There is a new "dump" button on the raid window. This will dump the information in that window into a text file to make determining raid participation a little easier.<BR>
- We have added a "link all" button to the loot window. This will place a link for all items on the corpse into the active chat window. This should make loot distribution easier.<BR>
<BR>
October 9, 2003 3:00 am<BR>
------------------------------<BR>
<BR>
(Add to the line about the hp/mana augmentations that drop in adventures now being type 7):<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
** Zones and NPCs **<BR>
<BR>
- Two new raid zones have been added to the Lost Dungeons on the Legends server. These are Guk-themed raids, one for Elemental Plane and one for Time Plane capable raiders.<BR>
<BR>
- The revamped Plane of Mischief is now available on all Live servers.<BR>
<BR>
- There were some situations where the warders in Vex Thal could be up, but the bosses needed to kill them would not be available. That shouldn't happen anymore.<BR>
<BR>
- Shrunk the giant wolves that appeared in the lands.<BR>
<BR>
- The Coirnav encounter has been changed. Be much more careful if you have been relying on stuns to deal with this encounter.<BR>
<BR>
- Corrected an issue with the Filth Gorgers that was causing them to remain around with they were supposed to despawn.<BR>
<BR>
- Soldiers of Madness in Grieg's End will no longer be so unbelievably numerous.<BR>
<BR>
- Zoning into the Plane of Fire will no longer cause characters to occasionally take 20k points of damage.<BR>
<BR>
- The Froglok Hunter and Forager will no longer be killed by the inhabitants of Trakanon's Teeth, so they should be easier to find.<BR>
<BR>
- When Mithaniel Marr is killed, his planar projection now spawns in the middle of his room rather than at the point of death. This fixes a problem that could cause the projection to appear out of reach.<BR>
<BR>
- The Qeynos investigator is now taking "follow me" orders again.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
** Adventures **<BR>
<BR>
- Every character that successfully completes an adventure will now get at least one point as a reward. This is also true for the "consolation" rewards.<BR>
<BR>
- Completing Hard adventures will yield more points.<BR>
<BR>
- Several trap spells on interactive objects have had their severity reduced.<BR>
<BR>
- Added some new type 7 and type 8 augmentations to various adventure merchants.<BR>
<BR>
- It will be clearer now which raids are "hard" and which are "normal". Hard raids are intended for Time capable guilds. They are very hard.<BR>
<BR>
- All raid recruiters now properly check to be sure that you have completed two adventures in their respective themes before they will give out the raid.<BR>
<BR>
- Fixed an issue in a Mistmoore's Catacomb raid that was preventing players from accessing an interactive object they had earned for killing Sfisithik.<BR>
<BR>
- Removed the ability to see through Shroud of Stealth from some of the NPCs that appear in LDoN Raids.<BR>
<BR>
- There was a misconception about the behavior of goblins in some Rujarkian Hills adventures. Goblins that are fleeing because they are unwilling to die or are seeking help will make it clear that they are doing so. We also corrected an issue that could cause these goblins to "ping pong" in some cases.<BR>
<BR>
- All of the "flavor" NPCs in dungeons (usually those that are lying down, nearly dead) will display full health to make it impossible to tell what kind of NPC they are (friend or foe) simply by looking at their health level.<BR>
<BR>
- Hostages will no longer be attacked by their captors.<BR>
<BR>
- We thinned out the population in the Grand Library and a few other Miragul's Menagerie themed zones to bring the challenge in line.<BR>
<BR>
- Rats in Mistmoore's Catacombs are now animals, shadows are now summoned.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
** Items and Objects **<BR>
<BR>
- Corrected a bug that allowed players to buy multiple lore augmentations if they were in a bag (which also caused issues when trying to loot corpses with those items). If you had multiple lore items, the extra items will be removed. A refund for the points spent on those items will be made when they are deleted.<BR>
<BR>
- Broken Chunk of Coal, Cracked Ruby, and Charred Pebble are no longer valid augmentations. If you had these augmentations bonded to an item, you will find them on your cursor. You can take those items to Dible Hedledrap in South Ro and he will restore your adventure points.<BR>
<BR>
- Perfect Garnet of Constitution, Pristine Garnet of Constitution, Perfect Sapphire of Insight, and Pristine Sapphire of Insight can be turned in to Dible Heldedrap in South Ro. He will replace them with type 8 versions of the same items.<BR>
<BR>
- Changed pre-LDoN items to have a single slot of type 7 instead of 1. Some LDoN items which had a slot type 1 were also changed to type 7.<BR>
<BR>
- Fixed a bug with the Adventurer's Stone that would sometimes cause it to not display its bonuses.<BR>
<BR>
- Interactive objects will now only appear on LDoN raids when the main boss has been killed. This change was done to prevent an exploit, and is a temporary change.<BR>
<BR>
- We have improved the types of rewards that can be found in interactive objects to improve the reward given for the risk taken by opening them.<BR>
<BR>
- Fixed a bug that prevented augments with no deity restrictions from combining with deity-restricted items.<BR>
<BR>
- Added a message that should make it clearer when a character is unable to loot an interactive object because they are on an NPC's hate list.<BR>
<BR>
- Hand-to-hand weapons are now part of the one-handed restriction on augmentations. So augmentations that say they can be used with one-handed items will also work with hand-to-hand items.<BR>
<BR>
- Geomancer's Crown of Reformation now fits in the head slot and the effect is worn instead of right clicked.<BR>
<BR>
- Gravestone of Dire Melodies and the Limestone Shard of Battle Cries will now properly modify instrument skills.<BR>
<BR>
- All of Royal Attendant Armor will now show up as plate armor.<BR>
<BR>
- Rogue pets focused with Summoner's Boon should no longer lose the ability to backstab.<BR>
<BR>
- Shard of Shrunken Bone was changed from Shield of Pain III to Shield of Pain II.<BR>
<BR>
- Changed many of the new Lost Dungeons "shields" to make them useable as shields (they can be used to bash now).<BR>
<BR>
- Removed augmentation slots from the following items: Primal Velium Knight's Sword, Divine Hammer of Consternation, Breezeboot's Frigid Gnasher, Primal Velium Fist Wraps, Primal Velium Battlehammer, Primal Velium Spear, Primal Velium Claidhmore, Primal Velium Brawl Stick, Primal Velium War Lance, Primal Velium Reinforced Bow, Primal Velium Battle Axe, Primal Velium Warsword, Ancient Prismatic Bow, Ancient Prismatic Lance, Ancient Prismatic Spear, Ancient Prismatic Claymore, Ancient Prismatic Brawl Stick, Ancient Prismatic Battlehammer, Ancient Prismatic Warsword, Ancient Prismatic Axe, Ancient Prismatic Fist Wraps, Ancient Prismatic Staff, Ancient Prismatic Stiletto, and Ancient Prismatic Mace.<BR>
<BR>
- Changed some weapons dropped from rare NPC's in LDoN zones to have slot type 4 instead of 1.<BR>
<BR>
- Changed Pristine Limestone of Hatred to Vengeance IV.<BR>
<BR>
- The hp/mana augmentations that dropped in adventures as slot 1 items will no longer drop. They have been replaced with similar items that fit into slot 7.<BR>
<BR>
- Made changes to various stats and effects on Plane of Time items.<BR>
<BR>
- Changed the level required to use the right-click effect on Wild Lord Armor to 45, to match all other Kunark armor.<BR>
<BR>
- Corrected a bug with mounts that would sometimes leave the horse buff up without the actual mount. Also corrected a problem that could cause a player to be unable to summon a mount.<BR>
<BR>
- Fixed the haste on Spiritbound Mystic's Torch<BR>
<BR>
- Altered the damage and delay on the Delightful Orb of Forgotten Magic to be more appropriate for where it drops<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
** For the New Player **<BR>
<BR>
- Find Feature added. This will create a mystical indication of the path to take to find certain people. This feature works in the Bazaar and in newbie zones and cities. In the Bazaar you just click on the merchant you seek in the Bazaar window and click the Find Trader button. For all other uses, just hit CTRL+F to open the window, select someone on the list and click the Find button. This will locate any Bazaar trader or any NPC with an alternate name, such as (Spell Vendor). The exception is that it will not locate NPCs in the Wayfarer's Camps.<BR>
<BR>
- The auto-attack key now defaults to Q (not A).<BR>
<BR>
- New characters start with their weapons and armor equipped.<BR>
<BR>
- New characters start with their spells scribed and memorized.<BR>
<BR>
- When a caster reaches the level required for one of the first two rings of new spells, they will get a message informing them that new spells are available.<BR>
<BR>
- New characters will begin with a stack of bandages. These bandages cannot be sold or traded.<BR>
<BR>
- When a character trains in a hotbutton-able skill that he did not previously have skill in, a hotbutton for that skill is created on the cursor.<BR>
<BR>
- New characters will have a page of hotbuttons set for them based on the skills given to them by their class and race.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
** Interface **<BR>
<BR>
- Merchants now separate items with different charges in their list. For example, 9 dose and 10 dose potions will show up as separate items on the merchant's list. Items with the same amount of charges will be stacked. NOTE: This will remove the ability to "recharge" items by selling them to a vendor and buying them back.<BR>
<BR>
- The Bazaar now supports selling different charged items. For example, a 10 dose potion with 9 charges can be sold for 90 plat., while a 10 dose version of the same potion can be sold for 100 plat. NOTE: All currently priced charged items will no longer have a price attached and will need to be reset by the trader.<BR>
<BR>
- Pet buffs are now visible in the pet window. A small icon will display for each buff on the pet (up to 30 - you may need to resize the pet window). You can hover your mouse over the icon to see the spell name. Alt left-click or right-click and hold for spell info box (which only contains name and icon).<BR>
<BR>
- Improved the functionality of the ESC key. Windows close in the opposite order that they were opened.<BR>
<BR>
- When World Containers (ovens, kilns, augmentation sealers and similar items) are closed, No Drop items in those containers will be placed in the character's inventory. If it will not fit there, it will appear on their cursor.<BR>
<BR>
- The "Only show items I can use" option in the Adventure Merchant window will be saved when you log out.<BR>
<BR>
- Hotbuttons created using the Abilities and Combat skill lists are no longer connected to the buttons in the Actions window. This means that you can create a button on the Abilities or Combat section of the actions window, drag that button to the hotbutton window, then change the button on the Abilities or Combat section, and the hotbutton you made will not change. This allows you to create hotbuttons for ALL of your character's skills, not just the ones that can fit in the Actions window.<BR>
<BR>
- You can now use the (`) key to "Target nearest NPC", in addition to F8.<BR>
<BR>
- Shared bank slots will no longer accept rentable containers with no-rent items in them.<BR>
<BR>
- A new system for the leaderboard has been implemented to track adventures by their difficulty. You can sort by normal/hard/all difficulty. Not only will this display the stats for the leaders, but you will also be able to see your own successes and failures at the bottom, based on the sorting you chose for the leaderboard. So, for example, if you filter the leaderboard by Miragul's Wins and choose Hard, you will not only see the leaders for Hard adventures in that theme, you will see your own statistics for Hard Miragul's adventures. NOTE: Because this tracking is new, it will only be able to differentiate hard and normal adventures from the time of this update onward. Past adventures will be treated as if they were normal difficulty.<BR>
<BR>
- /autojoin is now saved per character, not for all characters.<BR>
<BR>
- The Open and Inspect buttons are no longer "grayed-out" when Lay on Hands or Harm Touch are used.<BR>
<BR>
- Merchant inventories will refresh properly after a character purchases the last of an item in inventory.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
** Spells **<BR>
<BR>
- Casting Grow on an unshrunk shaman pet will no longer shrink the pet.<BR>
<BR>
- Remove Minor Curse cures 2 curse counters instead of 3-4.<BR>
<BR>
- Lich and Pact of Hate now use different colored skeleton models.<BR>
<BR>
- Monster Summoning will summon the correct models, not just earth elementals.<BR>
<BR>
- Frostreaver's Blessing will no longer block the bard song Wind of Marr. We realize there are still some stacking issues with these spells, and we hope to resolve them soon.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
** Tradeskills **<BR>
<BR>
- The Blessed Steel Arrowheads recipe will return the file.<BR>
<BR>
- NPC Merchants will now pay less for Steel Hunter Arrows, Steel Arrowshafts, and Steel Fletch.<BR>
<BR>
- The Muckskipper Chowder recipe no longer returns a pot on a failure or success, since the recipe does not require a pot at all.<BR>
<BR>
- The recipe for the "Lemming Fur Backpack" now requires an Embroidering Needle instead of a Sewing Needle.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
** Alternate Advancement **<BR>
<BR>

<br><BR>
*** Game Updates ***<br><BR>
<br><BR>
** Items **<br><BR>
<br><BR>
- Warrior and Magician epic changes – A new version of these two epic items is available to accommodate the new item augmentations.  Both of these epics are basically summoned items, and therefore they would lose any augmentations when used or unsummoned.  Players wishing to change these items into "permanent" versions in order to augment them should do the following:<br><BR>
<br><BR>
Warrior Epic - Talk to Gartrog Smitehammer in East Freeport.  He will replace your Red Scabbard and Jagged Blade of War with augmentable versions of the Jagged Blade of War, the Blade of Strategy, and the Blade of Tactics.  You will not receive the Red Scabbard back, as it will no longer be useful to you.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
Magician Epic - Talk to Ilisiv Gantrau in the Tox Forest.  She will take a summoned Orb of Mastery and replace it with a permanent augmentable orb.  The epic pet is still summoned in exactly the same way, with no changes to the spell or use.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
<br><BR>
** Zones and Quests **<br><BR>
<br><BR>
- Plane of Mischief - We have updated the factions for a few NPCs for this zone on Stormhammer only.  All of the NPCs there are meant to be aggressive. Some of them were on the wrong faction, and were not aggressive.  They are now.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
- The Deep - There were some NPCs in this zone that could see invisible but were bugged to be non-aggressive.  They will again be aggressive, so be more cautious when using invisibility in The Deep.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
- Plane of Valor - The Aerin'Dar projection was despawning after only a few minutes.  It will now remain as long as other projections.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
- City of Mist - Black Reavers are immune to magic once again.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
- Oxidized Steel Plate will now drop.  This should allow the completion of the Rallican’s Bracer quest<br><BR>
<br><BR>
- The Ghost of Kindle has returned.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
- Manastone is no longer usable in The Hole.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
- The trader limit increase mentioned in the last update should be working properly now.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
<br><BR>
** Spells **<br><BR>
<br><BR>
- We have reduced the cost of the Summon Wooden, Stone and Iron Bracelet spells.&nbsp;<br><BR>
<br><BR>
- We have added new Skeleton models for pets, illusions, and transformation spells.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
- We have changed the underlying way that pet focus items work to allow for future upgrades and items.  All existing foci should work as they always have.  If you notice anything unusual when using a pet focus, please /bug report the issue.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
<br><BR>
** Interface **<br><BR>
<br><BR>
- Context Tips - We have added a question mark symbol to windows that have help information available.  Just click on the question mark in the upper right of the window to see the tips.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
<br><BR>
** Miscellaneous **<br><BR>
<br><BR>
- Fixed a bug that was causing NPCs to appear to have a larger melee range than they should have in some cases.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
- Sullon Zek - There was a bug that allowed players to create characters on opposing alliances.  That is no longer possible.  If you see this message:&nbsp;<br><BR>
<br><BR>
"You currently have characters created on opposing deity alliances. You can only have characters that are on the same alliance.  Please correct this by deleting the character that was recently created and has an opposing alliance with the first character you created."&nbsp;<br><BR>
<br><BR>
You will not be able to log in until you delete any characters that are not on the same alliance.<br><BR>

** Known Issues **<br><BR>
 <br><BR>
This is the list of cosmetic issues that we're aware aren't perfect, but determined as acceptable to launch with, as none should affect peoples' ability to enjoy the game. &nbsp;<br><BR>
 <br><BR>
Rather than attempt last-minute changes that often break more than they fix, these will be addressed in an update after Lost Dungeons' launch.<br><BR>
 <br><BR>
- Paladins and Shadowknights:  The new INSPECT and OPEN ability buttons will *appear* disabled for the duration of your Harm Touch or Lay Hands timers when you use those abilities.  You may still use INSPECT and OPEN, however.  It just won't look like you can.<br><BR>
 <br><BR>
- When receiving an adventure from one of the Wayfarers' Camps, for now, the Adventure Window does not automatically close when you walk away from the Adventure Recruiter as it should. &nbsp;<br><BR>
 <br><BR>
- Pet Users:  If you tell your pet to attack an interactive object (chest, vase, coffin, etc) inside of a dungeon, your pet will tell you that it is attacking, but it will not actually attack.  This is a problem with the message, not the behavior.  The pet should be telling you that it cannot attack such a thing.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
<br><BR>
<br><BR>
** Use Augmentations Wisely **<br><BR>
<br><BR>
If you have an item with more than one slot available and you intend to apply an Augmentation Item that can fit into any slot (i.e. Type 1), be sure to apply it last.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
For example, you have an item with three slots available and you have filled Slot 1 with an Augmentation Item.  In your bag you have an Augmentation Item that can fit into any slot on the item (i.e. Type 1) and one that fits into Slot 2.  If you use the Type 1 Augmentation Item first, it will fill the first open slot on your item, which would be Slot 2 in this case.  This means you will not be able to use the Slot 2-specific Augmentation Item you had available.&nbsp;<br><BR>
<br><BR>
So, remember, the rule is that if you have an Augmentation Item that can be used it any slot, be sure to apply it last!</p><BR><br><br>-Glinlor Stormweaver</ul></div>

<BR>
August 26, 2003<BR>
------------------------------<BR>
<BR>
** Zone Revamps **<BR>
<BR>
- The Deep, Charasis (Howling Stones), Dragon Necropolis, Siren's Grotto, The Hole, The City of Mist, and The Accursed Temple of Cazic-Thule have been partially revamped. Gameplay in these zones has been improved, based on feedback from players and careful review of the content. The changes are not dramatic, but make these zones more entertaining to play in.<BR>
<BR>
- The Plane of Mischief, home of the trickster Bristlebane, has undergone an extensive revamp. As one of the most unusual places to visit in EverQuest, this zone is a very interesting challenge, if you have a sturdy funny bone. The improved zone is now available on Stormhammer.<BR>
<BR>
- The Greig's End revamp is now available on the Live servers. The redesign includes new encounters, items, traps, and events that make the zone a challenge for the experience group, with plenty of events for a raid group.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
** Interface **<BR>
<BR>
- /memspellset # - Using this command memorizes one of your saved spell sets. # is the number or name (or shortened name) of the spell set you wish to memorize. Note that if you use a shortened version of the spell set name, it will match the first spell set that has those characters, so /memspellset Dots will find your "Dots and Charms", or "Dots", or "Dotsandstuff" - whichever shows up first on your list.<BR>
<BR>
- A Platinum slot has been added to the shared bank to make transactions between characters on the same account more convenient.<BR>
<BR>
- Clip Plane - The clip plane slider should work more reliably now. Where before it may not have done anything until lowered to a very low percentage, now the slider should have an effect at any setting.<BR>
<BR>
- Filters for your own pet's messages have been added. Your own pet's attacks are no longer subject to the Other Attacks/Misses filters. On the options screen there is now a separate button for filtering YOUR Pet attack messages. Also, the ability to redirect your pet attack messages to any chat window has been added to the chat window context menus.<BR>
<BR>
- /random messages can now be sent to any chat window you'd like. There is no option to filter these messages, however, to prevent any loss of the information in cases where it is needed (meaning, people can't claim that they didn't see the /random that they lost just to force a re-roll).<BR>
<BR>
- The Journal Window has been changed to make it easier to use and understand. We've merged the the two information windows into a single window.<BR>
<BR>
- Fixed a bug in the Looking for Group window. The Get Matches button should no longer grey out at inappropriate times.<BR>
<BR>
- The Bad Word Filter now filters chat channel text as well as other game text.<BR>
<BR>
- To make things a little more logical, the /inspect command will allow characters to inspect interactive objects for LDoN, and /toggleinspect allows you to toggle on or off the ability to inspect other player characters using the mouse.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
** Alternate Advancement **<BR>
<BR>
- Purify Soul reuse time reduced from 72 minutes to 30 minutes.<BR>
<BR>
- Divine Resurrection reuse time reduced from 36 hours to 18 hours.<BR>
<BR>
- Celestial Regeneration reuse timer reduced from 72 minutes to 15 minutes. We have increased the duration from 24 seconds to 48 seconds, adjusted the amount healed, and made this a group effect.<BR>
<BR>
- Celestial Renewal duration increased from 24 seconds to 48 seconds, adjusted the amount healed, and this has become a group effect.<BR>
<BR>
- Harmtouch has been fixed. There was a problem with the timer for Harmtouch that would make it appear to reset when the character was logged out, even though it does not reset until the appropriate amount of time has passed.<BR>
<BR>
- Summon Death Charger and Summon Holy Steed have been fixed. We fixed a bug that caused these abilities to fail until the character zoned or logged out.<BR>
<BR>
- Endless Quiver no longer grants an endless supply of thrown weapons, only arrows.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
** Spells **<BR>
<BR>
- Unswerving Hammer of Faith has had its mana cost reduced from 250 to 175.<BR>
<BR>
- Divine Barrier no longer has a damage shield component and has gained three times the healing effect.<BR>
<BR>
- Celestial Remedy has had its mana cost lowered from 190 to 150.<BR>
<BR>
- A targeting issue with pets is now fixed. There was a bug that caused pets to be untargetable with the F1 key and with pet spells that target the pet automatically. This was happening only if a pet was summoned and then a mount was summoned.<BR>
<BR>
- AE Rain Spells were resisted 100% of the time when an NPC was above level 20 and had less than 10% of its hit points left. This will no longer happen.<BR>
<BR>
- Eye of Zomm would cause a player's pet to kill itself if that pet was commanded to kill the owner's Eye. This has been corrected. Also, the Eye no longer moves at incredible speed under water, but they can now swim up and down in water.<BR>
<BR>
- PBAoE Songs no longer prevent a bard from singing if used while the bard has himself targeted.<BR>
<BR>
- Illusions can once again be cast on others while the caster is on a mount.<BR>
<BR>
- When Invisibility drops due to looting a corpse, the player will be informed that their invisibility has dropped.<BR>
<BR>
- Pets no longer break enthrall.<BR>
<BR>
- Armor of the Zealot will no longer be overwritten by Focus of Soul and Focus of the Seventh. Blessed Armor of the Risen and Ancient: High Priest's Bulwark will no longer be overwritten by Focus of Spirit or Khura's Focusing. Also, Pact of Hate and Call of Darkness should stack properly (meaning that they won't stack).<BR>
<BR>
- Illusion: Guktan was fixed on all servers a little while ago. We just wanted you to be aware that the spell will make the target look like a Guktan, not a male human.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
** Zones and Quests **<BR>
<BR>
- Bazaar - We have increased the limit on the number of traders in the bazaar. We fixed an issue that would cause the "Begin Trader" button to be disabled if a player tried to use it when the maximum number of traders was reached. And the "Held" slot option was removed from the search, since it is not a valid option.<BR>
<BR>
- The Coirnav Encounter has been modified to respawn faster when the encounter is failed badly (if the attempt fails to reach a certain depth in the encounter).<BR>
<BR>
- The Illusion: Guktan quest had some issues. We have addressed them.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
** New Player Improvements **<BR>
<BR>
- After creating a new character, that character is the default selection on the character select screen.<BR>
<BR>
- At character creation, left-clicking on an attribute displays text that explains what that attribute is important for. Right-clicking allocates the maximum possible points to that attribute.<BR>
<BR>
- To help reduce clutter for the new player, the Story window no longer pops up when a player first logs in.<BR>
<BR>
- When a context Tip window pops up, if the Tip of the Day is still open, the Tip of the Day window will close. Again, this is to help reduce the clutter.<BR>
<BR>
- We've change the name of the "Camp" button in the Actions window to "Camp (Exit)" for clarity.<BR>
<BR>
- The Inventory Tip window now explains how to read books and notes, how to give/trade items with NPC's, and how to scribe spells.<BR>
<BR>
- We've added a text message on the screen to inform players when they are loading a zone, and what zone they are about to enter.<BR>
<BR>
- Added numeric background to buttons in the Hot Button window to make it easier to tell which button corresponds to which number key.<BR>
<BR>
- The Mousewheel zoom is now enabled by default.<BR>
<BR>
- New installations of EverQuest will default to 1024x768 resolution.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
** Misc **<BR>
<BR>
- Fixed a bug that caused some equipment to be invisible on characters created recently (since our update on August 6th).<BR>
<BR>
- Luclin elemental models will now display if selected, regardless of other settings for Luclin models. You can turn these models on with no other Luclin models active, and you will see the Luclin elemental.<BR>
<BR>
- Hitting cancel on a trade window or using the /consent or /deny commands will now only send you one message, not two.<BR>

<BR>
August 6, 2003<BR>
------------------------------<BR>
<BR>
Note: Some internal data restructuring created a delay in the introduction of the new platinum slot in the shared bank and the new text filters. We will bring those to the Live servers as soon as we can.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
** New Adventure in Lavastorm! **<BR>
<BR>
In the depths of the Lavastorm Mountains there is only one ruler. But even his burning breath and power have their limits. Rumor has it that there is wealth and danger in locations even further below the boiling lands than Lord Nagafen can reach. These tales have been spreading like ripples on a calm lake, and their point of origin appears to be an upstart barbarian named Morden. Some say that he's already delved these fabled caverns and taken what there was of value. Other say that he couldn't have carried it all off by himself. But most say that he's a rogue, a teller of tales, and not to be trusted. Will you discover the truth and brave the heat, or will you sit beside your cozy campfire and listen to stories?<BR>
<BR>
This new adventure zone will only be around for a while, so you may want to visit soon.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
** Spells **<BR>
<BR>
- Summoned Burning Affliction focus items added - Mages have four new spells, Summon Wooden Bracelet, Summon Stone Bracelet, Summon Iron Bracelet, and Summon Steel Bracelet. The bracelets summoned provide the Burning Affliction effect for DoT spells.<BR>
<BR>
- Summoned container spells updated - The Quiver of Marr, Bandoleer of Luclin and the Pouch of Quellious now appear filled with the appropriate item (for example, the Quiver of Marr now appears with six stacks of arrows). Also, these items should all be exactly the same, so the quiver function should work properly.<BR>
<BR>
- Mass Enchant spells corrected - The mass enchant spells for Adamantite, Brellium, Mithril and Steel now create the 5 enchanted blocks that they should.<BR>
<BR>
- Illusion: Guktan is available - This is an illusion spell for the new Froglok models.<BR>
<BR>
- Illusion: Scaled Wolf is available - This is an illusion spell for the Scaled Wolf seen in Kunark.<BR>
<BR>
- Tiny Companion - The spell scroll for this spell is no longer No Drop.<BR>
<BR>
- Dooming Darkness no longer overwrites Cascading Darkness.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
** Items **<BR>
<BR>
- Moss Covered Hood - This item can now be equipped by all classes.<BR>
<BR>
- Silk String - This item is now stackable.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
** Trade Skills **<BR>
<BR>
- New Fletching recipes added - We've added several new Karana-only fletching recipes to help round out that skill.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
** Quests and Zones **<BR>
<BR>
- Halls of Betrayal - Corrected an error with some of the quest item drops in this zone.<BR>
<BR>
- Plane of Time - The events in Plane of Time B now remember the progress your raid has made through the zone when you leave and will restore you to the same state when you return.<BR>
<BR>
- Kagazz will respond when you ask him about fasteners.<BR>
<BR>
- Experience in city zones updated - Some time around the release of Planes of Power we reduced the experience gain in some city zones. Tthe experience gained from quests in those zone has been increased.<BR>
<BR>
- Ogre newbie quests - Added a weapon quest for young ogres.<BR>
<BR>
- Iksar Necromancer Spell Vendors - The Iksar necromancer spell vendors have moved and are a lot closer to the necromancer guild. This should make it easier for new necromancers to find these vendors and will hopefully boost their sales.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
** Miscellaneous **<BR>
<BR>
- Spell book bug - Corrected a bug that was causing characters to be randomly forced to stand up when in their spell book.<BR>
<BR>
- Client crash information - If your game crashes on the client side, a dialogue box will come up asking if you'd like to send us the information about the crash. This information may help us pinpoint problems and make it easier to fix them. Only information relevant to the crash, your character name, server name and the zone you were in will be sent.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
** Fan Faire **<BR>
<BR>
Chicago Fan Faire is sneaking up on us! The Chicago event will be held September 26-28th, and the last day to guarantee your spot at the event by pre-registering is September 8th.

<br><ul>July 10, 2003 for Wizards<br><BR>
<hr size="1"><BR>
<p> ** Zones **</p><BR>
<p>- Increased Experience - We have increased the experience modifier in the Tower <BR>
  of Solusek Ro, Halls of Honor, The Temple of Marr, and the Lair of Terris Thule. <BR>
</p><BR>
<p><br><BR>
  ** Spells **</p><BR>
<p>- New Spell levels for Clarity line - Boon of the Clear Mind is now a level <BR>
  44 spell, Clarity II is now a level 52 spell and Gift of Pure Thought is now <BR>
  level 56.</p><BR>
<p>- Area of Effect spells - AoE spells that do not affect your group in PvP no <BR>
  longer affect your Raid in PvP either.</p><BR>
<p>- Direct Damage spell messages - Striking the killing blow with a direct damage <BR>
  spell will no longer show a double cast on the spell message.</p><BR>
<p>- Draught of Lightning - We have added a new Wizard spell to the game called <BR>
  Draught of Lightning.</p><BR>
<p><br><BR>
  ** Items **</p><BR>
<p>- Ornate Armor Molds - These molds are more readily available.</p><BR>
<p>- Spellshield - Spellshield items now reduces spell damage by a percentage <BR>
  rather than a fixed amount. </p><BR>
<p><br><BR>
  ** Quests **</p><BR>
<p>- Newbie Quests - Erudites, Trolls, Ogres and Barbarians now have quests in <BR>
  their newbie areas similar to those implemented for all other races. This completes <BR>
  the updated newbie quests for all races.</p><BR>
<p>- Bors Wharhammer - He will be checking level instead of flags as a requirement <BR>
  for his quests to bring him in-line with the flag removals for the lower tier <BR>
  planes. </p><BR>
<p><br><BR>
  ** Interface **</p><BR>
<p>- Camera - We have added the ability to bind cameras to keys. This will allow <BR>
  players to hit one key to switch to a desired camera rather than having to cycle <BR>
  through the F9 camera chain. This can be changed in the Options window (Alt-O) <BR>
  under the Keyboard tab (select &quot;camera&quot; from the list).</p><BR>
<p>- Auto-inventory - Items right-clicked off your corpse will now be place into <BR>
  your inventory in the correct order.</p><BR>
<p>- Spell Favorites - Creating a spell favorite name that matches a name that <BR>
  already exists will cause the new favorite to be saved over the old (whereas <BR>
  before it would create a second list with the same name).</p><BR>
<p><br><BR>
  ** Miscellaneous **</p><BR>
<p>- Mounts - Fixed a bug with mounts showing up with incorrect Luclin model settings. <BR>
  Mounts should now only show up when the Luclin models for the character race <BR>
  of the rider AND mounts/elementals are both on.</p><BR>
<p><br><BR>
  Also, as a heads up to players that have created their own user interfaces for <BR>
  EverQuest, these are the interface files that we have changed:</p><BR>
<p>EQUI_Optionswnd.xml<br><BR>
  EQUI.xml<br><BR>
  EQUI_charactercreate.xml</p><BR>

------------------------------ <BR>
** Experience System Change - Grouping ** <BR>
<BR>
We've made some improvements to the way experience is rewarded in EverQuest. These improvements are aimed at positively reinforcing the act of grouping. After all, this is a Massively Multiplayer game. <BR>
<BR>
Prior to this update groups gained a 2% to 20% experience bonus for having two to six members. <BR>
<BR>
As of today this bonus has increased to range from 20% to 80% for having two to five members. When a group adds a sixth member, the 80% bonus remains, but the experience gained is only divided by 5 before being distributed. The sixth group member no longer causes the experience gain to be divided by 6. <BR>
<BR>
Planes of Power zones had an increased experience award above and beyond those of most other zones. Because of these new dramatic improvements to group experience gains, we will be reducing the zone-specific experience bonus for Planes of Power zones a bit. As long as character is grouped with at least one other in these zones, they will see an improvement in experience gain over the old system. The one down side to the new system is that there will be a small decrease in experience for those who do not group, and only for those who do so in Planes of Power zones. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
** Experience System Change - Level 60+ ** <BR>
<BR>
In addition to the above changes, we have increased the range of NPC levels that give a character experience after they reach level 60. This will open up many of the "old world" zones to players previously restricted to Planes of Power zones for experience gain. The range of NPCs that will be "blue" to a level 65 character has been increased as far as level 50, with the "light blue" range extending to level 45. The best experience gains, however, are still for fighting things around and above your level. This should open up areas for high level characters in groups and solo. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
** Interface ** <BR>
<BR>
- Shared Bank Vault - We've added two shared bank slots to the interface. These extra bank slots can be accessed by any character on the same account and server. No-Drop and No Rent items can't be placed in these bank slots, and only one of any specific Lore item can exist in the shared bank at any time. <BR>
<BR>
- Spell Context Menus - This is a new interface menu that will make memorizing spells less tedious. To access the spell menu, just right-click an empty spell gem. This will open a list of spell categories. Point your mouse at a category and a list of spells will be displayed. Select a spell from that list to memorize it in that slot. Your character will sit down, memorize the spell and stand back up. <BR>
<BR>
- Spell Favorites - Spell favorites are an easy way to memorize a full set of eight spells without the tedious book searching. Right-clicking on the spellbook icon in your spell window will open up the spell favorites menu. You will be able to save your current spell lineup as a favorite, delete a favorite or memorize all the spells in one of your already saved spell sets. You can save as many as ten sets of spell favorites. As with the new spell context menus mentioned above, this will not replace the spellbook, it is meant to make memorizing large numbers of spells more convenient. <BR>
<BR>
- Spell Descriptions - We have expanded the spell description window. Along with the information that has always been available, we have added an explanation about what the spell does in general that includes damage and duration when appropriate. You can see these new descriptions by right-clicking and holding on the spell scroll, the spell gem in your Spells window, or the spell icon in your spellbook. <BR>
<BR>
- New Camera - We've added a new camera mode to the game. Lovingly dubbed the EQ Cam, it uses the mouse wheel to allow you to zoom away from your character into a "chase" camera. This only works from first person mode (the default view). Using the mouse wheel you can determine the distance of the camera from your character, or to zoom back into first person mode. When in the chase mode, mouselook turns the character and camera together and you can change the pitch of the camera using the mouse. <BR>
<BR>
- NPC Names - Many NPCs will be displaying additional titles to make it clearer what their job is. For example, an NPC that sells tailoring supplies may have the title [Tailor Supplies] under their name. This will help folks find the proper merchant. It's analogous to them hanging out their shingle. <BR>
<BR>
- Rare Character Select Crash - Using the arrow keys to try to change the selected character at the character select screen when there were no characters on the account was causing people to crash out of the game. That's fixed now. <BR>
<BR>
- Guild Message of the Day - Using certain HTML codes when setting up a Guild Message of the Day was causing all members of the guild to crash. While this may have been amusing for pranks on your guild, we still decided to fix it. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
** Spells ** <BR>
<BR>
- Spell level limits now enforced - Some high level spells cannot be cast on characters under a certain level. In the past a caster could get around this level restriction when casting a group version of a spell by targeting a higher level group member, and the spell would take effect on the whole group, regardless of their level. That loophole has been closed. We're sorry if you have grown accustomed to the system working this way, but those level restrictions are important to the integrity of lower level gameplay. <BR>
<BR>
- Incineration and Conglaciation of Bones - Both of these spells should now crit and stack (when cast by different casters). <BR>
<BR>
- Divine Intervention - This spell should now be reporting the amount of healing it delivers. <BR>
<BR>
- Healing Messages - The target of a healing spell will now get a message telling them the caster's name and the amount of healing they receive. <BR>
<BR>
- Reporting Damage Over Time - Damage over Time (DoT) done to NPCs will now be reported to the caster every time it does damage. These messages can be filtered in the Options window. <BR>
<BR>
- Boon of the Garou - The level restriction for this spell has been removed. We have also fixed a bug with the spell that would prevent it from being cast on target that are not on a horse if the enchanter is on horseback (spell still cannot affect those on horseback). <BR>
<BR>
- Wake of Karana - To improve the usefulness of this spell, we have lowered the recast time from 90 seconds to 15 seconds. <BR>
<BR>
- Beastlord Warders - Beastlords will once again be able to summon their warders in the Plane of Sky. Sorry for the delay in getting this one fixed properly. <BR>
<BR>
- Familiars - Familiars will no longer attempt to equip items. This was causing them to try to wear weapons inside their heads, which probably isn't a good thing for them to do. <BR>
<BR>
- Spirit spell line - We have added +75 dexterity to the effects of Spirit of Flame, Spirit of Rellic, and Spirit of Snow. <BR>
<BR>
- Spell stacking and blocking - Changed the following spell lines to cause them to bounce off of each other. Each line should block everything from the other line, but still be overwritten by spells of the same line. <BR>
<BR>
Spiritual Strength <BR>
Spiritual Brawn <BR>
Spiritual Vigor <BR>
<BR>
Strength of Tunare <BR>
Strength of Nature <BR>
<BR>
Brell's Mountainous Barrier <BR>
Brell's Stalwart Shield <BR>
Brell's Steadfast Aegis <BR>
<BR>
- Translocation spells - Fixed a bug with translocation spells. If a second translocation spell was cast on a character before he had accepted the first, both would fail. <BR>
<BR>
- Spell casting pets - In the past, pets were restricted to casting spells of level 20 and below. We have given them access to higher level spells. You may want to be careful with them until you get used to their new abilities. <BR>
<BR>
- Drunken Riders - We fixed an odd bug that allowed people who were extremely drunk to cast spells without mana cost while on a horse. Yes, crazy bugs like that actually happen. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
** Zones ** <BR>
<BR>
- Droga and Nurga - The mines of Nurga have been inhabited by crafty Goblins and stolid Burynai for many long years, digging and slaving away under the earth. It's time to shake them up! The redesign for these zones are now on the Legends server, Stormhammer. The mines of Nurga are a fun zone for characters of levels about 40 to 55. The Temple of Droga accommodates characters around 50th to 65th level. Both zones will have some new events and quest, while retaining the distinct feel of the zones. <BR>
<BR>
- Veksar - Since the rediscovery of the lands of Kunark, there have been rumors springing from the ancient lore of the Iksar. Most of those rumors remain unfounded, as gaining access to the lore of the insular Iksar is no easy task. One of the most persistent legends is about a city that lies buried under the Lake of Ill Omen. That city was called Veksar, and it is up to you to discover the tale of its fate. <BR>
<BR>
- Planes of Power access - Planes of Power has provided us with valuable insight into the group and guild dynamics that are involved in large scale games. The way that we had expected guilds to advance through the story of Planes of Power has become a problem for some guilds as some members have fallen behind and found it difficult to catch up. Obviously this was not our intention. We want people to play with their friends and guild mates. <BR>
<BR>
To correct this issue, we will be allowing characters to enter the following Planes of Power zones by meeting a simple level requirement: <BR>
<BR>
Level 55 and over <BR>
Plane of Storms <BR>
Plane of Torment <BR>
Plane of Valor <BR>
Crypt of Decay <BR>
<BR>
Level 62 and over <BR>
Bastion of Thunder <BR>
Halls of Honor <BR>
<BR>
Characters that don't meet the level requirement may still enter these zones using the existing flags, and raids may still bring additional unflagged or lower level characters with them. All other planes with flag or story requirements for entry will still require those flags, and those flags can still be obtained as they always have. <BR>
<BR>
This will make the majority of Planes of Power zones available to characters over the minimum level, and will allow their guilds to travel and adventure together in the planes. We understand that those that have already earned the entry flags for these zones have put some effort into that accomplishment. We will be giving a reward to those that have done so, though you'll have to wait to see what that reward is. <BR>
<BR>
If you have completed the requirements for flags for these zones, you may wish to visit Gram Dunnar. <BR>
<BR>
- Great Divide - The Plane of Knowledge portal in the Great Divide will now be available when the Ring War is in progress. <BR>
<BR>
- Bastion of Thunder - We have upgraded the loot available from many of the mini-bosses in the Bastion of Thunder to make the reward more inline with the risk. <BR>
<BR>
- Sol Ro's Tower - They look like frogs, hop like frogs and now they even react to spells like frogs. Flame Frogs are now flagged as animals. <BR>
<BR>
- Rallos Zek encounter - Rallos Zek will remove anyone from the zone that attacks him if they are not part of the raid that has him engaged. Even in war, there are rules to be followed. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
** Items ** <BR>
<BR>
- Tradeskill item flag - There is a new flag on items. When viewing the information about an item, if you see that it has a Tradeskill flag, it is an item that can be used in a tradeskill recipe. This isn't to clearly spell out every item that is used in every tradeskill recipe. The intent is to assist those who are finding items that do not already have an obvious use, by letting them know that the item is used in a tradeskill recipe, somewhere. <BR>
<BR>
- LoY "Fine Steel" - Many of the more commonly dropped weapons in the Legacy of Ykesha zones were a bit too powerful for the ease and level needed to get them. Some of the most out of line items were the Harpoon, Luggald Trident, and Luggald Dagger. We've decided that it is necessary to tune them down a bit. <BR>
<BR>
- The Hollow Acrylia Obelisk - This is the old Acrylia key. It has been changed into a charm. This charm can be used by anyone, not just those that own LoY. <BR>
<BR>
- Bows - The Longbow of the Grimlings and the Bow of Gloaming have both been given ranges. They can now be used properly. <BR>
<BR>
- The Burning Flame Shield - This item had the wrong resist modifiers. It now has a +30 fire resistance and a -10 cold resistance. <BR>
<BR>
- Bazaar Search - Non-instrument items with instrument modifiers will now show up in instrument type searches in the Bazaar. <BR>
<BR>
- Ornate Stone Medicine Totem - This item can now be equipped. <BR>
<BR>
- Storm Reaper Thorn Machete - This newbie Halfling quest weapon is now flagged as magical. <BR>
<BR>
- Charm of the Brotherhood - This item will now give a bonus when grouped with others of either the same class or race. <BR>
<BR>
- Dagger of Distraction - This item can no longer be used by Monks. <BR>
<BR>
- Edge of Eternity - Beastlords and monks can no longer use this item. <BR>
<BR>
- Veil of Lost Hopes and Orb of Clinging Death - The casting times on both of these items has been lowered. <BR>
<BR>
- Magi`Kot's Pants of Convergence - The effect on this item has been changed to summon a Rod of Mystical Transvergance. <BR>
<BR>
- Cloak of the Falling Skies - The focus effect this item has changed to Preservation of Solusek <BR>
<BR>
- The Wristguard of Keen Vision - This item is now useable by int. casters. <BR>
<BR>
- The Mask of Conceptual Energy - This item is now useable by priests. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
** Alternate Advancement ** <BR>
<BR>
- Lifeburn - This ability would cause an undue amount of aggro to be generated because it would bring the caster to an extremely low number of hit points, making them look like tasty targets to enemies nearby. To lessen this problem, Lifeburn will no longer reduce the caster to 10 hit points, but to about one fourth of the caster's hit points. This should prevent the additional agro generated while retaining the risk for using the ability. <BR>
<BR>
- Feigned Minion - The Child of Bertoxxulous pet will no longer cast buff spells to break his feign when under the Feigned Minion effect. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
** Quests and Tradeskills ** <BR>
<BR>
- Bankers - There were a few quests that required giving an item to a banker. When we recently removed the ability for characters to give items to bankers to help prevent mistakenly losing items, those quests became unavailable. We have moved those quests to new NPCs. If you see any other quests that ask you to give something to a banker, please use /bug and report it to us. <BR>
<BR>
- Newly Stackable Items - Valor Crystals, Ceramic Linings, Holgresh Fur and Casks are now stackable. Also, Valor Crystals can be sold to vendors. <BR>
<BR>
- Sewer Catfish - These unappetizing fish have begun to appear in Cabilis. <BR>
<BR>
- Klok Foob - Will now accept a Catfish Croak Sandwich. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
** Changes for New Characters ** <BR>
<BR>
- Newbie Starting Locations - We've modified all locations where new characters start to make them a bit more convenient for the new player. They should all start very near their guild masters. <BR>
<BR>
- Nudging - New characters will be given a text message to encourage them to hand in their newbie note to their guild master. For new players, this is one of the key things to get them involved in gameplay, and one of the easiest to overlook. <BR>
<BR>
- Guild Masters - To help guide new characters, Guild Masters now take a more active role in helping out new recruits by directing them to some starting points for quests. <BR>
<BR>
- Quests - There are even more quests in the newbie zones, most of them revolving around the pests that seem to inhabit even the grandest cities. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
** Miscellaneous ** <BR>
<BR>
- We are working on an update to the Luclin player character model animations. This will not be a complete revamp of all the animations, but will address some of the most common concerns. However, in the mean time you may see some unusual animations, particularly when shorter PCs are running. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
** UI File Changes ** <BR>
<BR>
NOTE: In order to see the new Shared Bank slots, you will need to use the default bank window, or modify your custom bank window to include the new slots. <BR>
