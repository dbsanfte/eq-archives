  <p align="left">This quest is initiated by speaking to Gardern in the <b>
  Temple of Solusek Ro</b>. He issues this quest along with the Weeping Wand. 
  For the Staff of Temperate Flux, he asks you for a Heart of Fire from an 
  Inferno Goblin Wizard from Solusek's caves, a Heart of Frost from a Goblin 
  Wizard in Permafrost, a Rod of Bone from Stone Skeletons in Lake Rathe, and 
  finally a Staff of Ro. It is arguably one of the most important quests a 
  wizard will ever do.</p>
  <p><b>Heart of Fire</b> - In Solusek A, I was near the Solusek's Champion when 
  a wizard spawned that had this. The hearts are semi rare. Wizards and Shamans 
  share spawning points so by killing shamans you increase your chances of 
  finding a wizard with one of these. They only drop from Inferno Goblin 
  Wizards. If you want to save yourself a headache, go into Solusek A during 
  peak hours and OOC that you would like to loot one in return for some 
  platinum.</p>
  <p><b>Heart of Frost</b> - In Permafrost, I did an OOC that I was looking for 
  a heart of frost, someone found one on a wizard that spawned in the Preacher's 
  room. I wasn't there long, got very lucky. I was told a few things about this 
  from a very trusted guildmate, she found the heart of frost on more than just 
  wizards (being a 50 Bard, she would go in and kill all the npc's that weren't 
  camped for fun). Apparently, wizards have them much more frequent but hearts 
  can be found on anything. I know first hand that, the best place to find 
  wizards is while camping for the preacher. I was unlucky that the preacher was 
  camped, but lucky that a person there was kind enough to let me loot the 
  heart. I also know, first hand, that my heart was found on a frost goblin 
  wizard.</p>
  <p><b>The Rod of Bone</b> - is found on Stone Skeletons that sit inside an 
  eerily lit tower on the shore of Lake Rathe. I got to this tower by entering 
  Lake Rathe from South Karana and I swam keeping the zone wall on my left side. 
  I should note that this Tower is located on a high shore that you'll find 
  shortly after passing the zone entrance to Rathe Mtns. A solo aviak guard 
  spawns on a perch on this highland. Many 20-24 people camp that as it easy 
  exp. (I know first hand) so be careful. The stone skeletons, to the best of my 
  knowledge, are magicians who conjure earth pets. Two of them with pets con'ed 
  green to me at 35. They were green but high enough to aggro me when I cast on 
  one of them. I had a wizard with me and we needed to kill 3 sets to get 2 
  rods... not too shabby.</p>
  <p><b>The Staff of Ro</b> - is obtained in Solusek's Temple. Romar Sunto tells 
  you he will give you a Darkwood Staff, also known as a Staff of Ro, if you 
  bring him a Lambent Stone. Lambent Stones are found on Sand Giants, Hill 
  Giants, and Griffins.</p>
  <p><b>A Few Notes</b> - I wouldn't trade this staff for anything, if I could.
  <br>
  1) It lowers a mob's fire/cold resistances by 6 each. Very nice while soloing 
  or being in a group without someone who can lower fire or cold defenses. 6 
  points is enough to notice a difference. With this stick I've had fewer full 
  resists and fewer partial resists (of all mobs within my ability to hit, of 
  course). <br>
  2) It also makes a great pulling device because it aggro's without damage. <br>
  3) The effect cannot be multiplied and doesn't stack with other fire/cold 
  debuffs. As a debuff, it helps all in your group, not just you. <br>
  4) It can be resisted, but is rather pointless since you can just click away 
  until it takes effect. <br>
  5) When kiting, it is a great distance-judging device, since you can click it 
  on the run. </p>
