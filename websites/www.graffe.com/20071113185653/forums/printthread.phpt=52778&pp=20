		<div>Lets start a new bug / fixes list the one from xara was out-dated and a lot of the stuff in that post has been addressed or is working as intended.<br />
<br />
I hear dev's are doing a quick fix pass(non code related fixes) slated for GU3 so lets see if we can complie a list of stuff and I'll send a pm over to talisker and aviar on the soe forums with the completed list, and hope for the best.  At least its &quot;somthing&quot; more than what we have now which is nothing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<u>Chromantic Halo</u><br />
***edit*** My toon was bugged, Learning this ability is working fine.<br />
However the description on the mobs still says +50% spell reduction, and they take just that 50% less spell damage with the buff up.  <br />
<br />
<u>Finishers</u><br />
When using flamespear our 1st and 2nd fire finisher will not activate if past 30m range.  only our 1st and 2nd cold finishers will light up and be usable.<br />
<br />
<u>Z axis bugs with Conical abilities</u><br />
Color spray &amp; 1st/2nd cold finishers.<br />
If you are on un'even terrain you have to pan your camera up / down via PgUp and PgDn keys so that you can hit your target if standing above / below them, and if you dont hit the mob due to Z axis the refresh timer is incurred.<br />
<br />
<u>Seradon's falling star</u><br />
The ability is very underpowered.  The cast time is just too long for the damage it deals.  It needs a significant damage boost or cast time reduction.  many have been asking for this to be our large single target nuke.  If possible up the damage and remove the chance to root.<br />
<br />
<u>taqmir's barrage</u><br />
This ability needs a minor tweak, a damage boost/higher crit bonus or cast time reduction will go a long way to making it more used ability.<br />
<br />
<u>Chaos volley</u><br />
still get epic / legendary self feedback damage from this, and we still get feedback damage when it is resisted.<br />
We can get partial resists on the feedback damage inflicted to us be never a full resist unless we use our arcane immunity self buff.<br />
<br />
<u>Energy shards</u><br />
There is a bug in that if you cast an energy shard while wearing a Quicksilver ring, and log out(for an extended period of time) while the refresh timer is counting down, when you log back in you will have the full 1 hour recast restriction placed on it.<br />
If you log out right after the refresh timer expires at the 45m mark (with quick silver ring) and come back in say the next day you will incur the 1 hour recast restriction.  <br />
You must wait the full hour after casting the shard, or when you log back in you will have the 1 hour recast lockout.<br />
<br />
<u>Energy rift</u><br />
This ability does not scale very well at higher levels.  its power cost is very high, when coupled with the high endurance cost. Currently its more efficient to use fireball for more damage and less power and less endurance.  Can the endurance or energy cost get re-evaluated and reduced on higher lvl versions?<br />
<br />
<u>icequake</u><br />
The scaling on this spell is non existant.  it has the same snare duration as the first version, and there is zero reason to use the highest lvl version.  The power cost on this ability is also very high, and needs a reduction.<br />
<br />
<u>Mantle of ether</u><br />
This dropped group lvl 50 spell has the same arcane resistance (270) as the single target arcane debuff we get at lvl 50.  It needs a slight upgrade.  <br />
<br />
<u>Firebarrier 3</u><br />
The scaling on firebarrier 1 and 2 are very good.  The scaling on the &quot;energy regeneration&quot; from firebarrier 2 to firebarrier 3 is very poor.  it goes from 22 per 6s to 26 per 6s. or a net gain of 4 energy per 6s.  Can this get looked into and increased if neccessary?<br />
<br />
<u>Disperse / reflect group wards</u><br />
counterspelling with disperse/reflect will still sometimes drop the ward from all group members.  For example if you have both wards up and the mob casts a spell you disperse it, the log will indicate each member of the party dispersed the spell and the spell ward is removed from each of them.  The same holds true for reflect.<br />
I know a few have asked to have back the single target version of this spell, a single target 3.0s cast while keeping the group 6.0s cast.  Is this feasable?<br />
<br />
<u>Char</u><br />
This spell needs a small damage increase and could use it by increasing the number of dot ticks by an additional 6 seconds for a total of 10s or 5 dot ticks 1 per 2s.<br />
<br />
<u>Forget</u><br />
This spell still does not appear to be reducing hate other than the 2.0s of cast time of not dealing damage.<br />
<br />
<u>Magic Immunity Self Buffs (sanctuary lines)</u><br />
Ethereal sanctuary - the +300 to arcane resistance after the 15second immunity wears off does not stack with our self arcane buff.  At lvl 50 we can self buff 270 to arcane, this barrier gives us only +30 since it does not stack.  We think they should stack.<br />
The rest- We would like to see each one on a separate timer and not linked.</div>

		<div>Chromatic Halo <br />
- agreed<br />
<br />
Finishers <br />
- agreed. Noticed this as well, I doubt it's working as intended (tm) so a fix would be nice.<br />
<br />
Z axis bugs with Conical abilities - <br />
hmm havn't really noticed this but I don't doubt its there, also not sure these conical abilities are supposed/intended to spread in the Z axis?<br />
<br />
Seradon's falling star <br />
agreed that it's underpowered. But if you want to up the damage and remove chance to root you basically have another Flamespear but with shorter range. No real need for this. <br />
I'm not sure why we got this spell in the first place, it doesn't really bring much new or flavor to the table. My suggestion would be to remove this spell and replace it with a longer (minute long) DoT spelline. Not asking for something as good as the more dot-based casters got, but a small longlasting DoT would be cool. <br />
<br />
taqmir's barrage<br />
I'm not sure I agree on this one. Its pretty much only asking to make the class more powerful, and this spell has its uses. I'm sure you noticed in groups with the right buffs its possible to get the casttime on this very fast.<br />
<br />
Chaos volley<br />
I agree on the crit feedback on this spell, this should be removed. But I don't understand why we shouldn't get feedback if the mob resists the spell? That's something the mob does, and shouldn't affect its feedback. Just remove the chance of crit on the feedback and this would be enough.<br />
<br />
Energy shards <br />
Yes, please have a look at this. Annoying bug.<br />
<br />
Energy rift<br />
Agree somewhat, the last version need damage upped a little to be worth using. But I like the endurance cost, its adds a demand for at least one item with +end regen (which helps a ton). You know you can put resonating crystals of recovery on more than chest, as description says. Get situational AE gear and you'll notice big difference!<br />
<br />
icequake<br />
Agree somewhat, maybe we don't need as many versions of this spell? Agree the energy cost is a bit high, but I love the no-limit (that I've noticed) to how many mobs it can affect (unlike in EQ where it was 4). Nothing like the rush of pulling 9 (my record so far) mobs with it and go at them with fireball, to be totally out of energy when they all drop :)<br />
<br />
Mantle of ether <br />
- agree, a little bonus would be in order<br />
<br />
Firebarrier 3<br />
Maybe a few points more on it, but again if you increase this too much there would be less demand for +energy regen on gear. Gearing up should be about having to make choices, sacrificing one thing to gain another. When you power-up abilities it calls for a look on other classes, and you're back on sqare one balance wise.<br />
<br />
Disperse / reflect group wards <br />
- Agree, gief self only version.<br />
<br />
Char<br />
Nah, see previons comments about increasing abilities, also my suggestion for a longer lasting dot instead of S falling star could help with this.<br />
<br />
Forget <br />
- Agree, and this is one of my major concerns. Please have a look at this spell. It can't be working as intended (tm).<br />
<br />
Magic Immunity Self Buffs (sanctuary lines)<br />
Don't really agree, having them on separate timers may be too powerful for the PvPers, maybe also in PvE, but I have to admit I havn't played much with these spells other than the first one for CV feedback..</div>

		<div>As others have said the refresh on the energy shards is often very glitchy and keeps reseting.  Also there sometimes used to be problems with binding and logging off when levitating though this might have been fixed by now since it doesn't seem to have been a problem recently.  I agree that Taqmir's Barrage, Flamespear, and Seradon's FS should be tweaked some.  Taq's and Flamespear are useful however the range limitations should be mitigated somewhat on Flamespear and Taqmir's Bolts/Barrage, though it has uses, should be made more viable in comparison to Chaos Volley.  Adding an arcane or ice version of char might be a good idea as well.  <br />
<br />
And most of all positively make Asaya's Insight possible to cast on other players.  It is far, far more logical if it can be used on other players; there is no reason to keep it self only.</div>

The advantage is that you can have up to 4 wards up at a time (with chromatic barrier), which saved my life quite often alredy ;)</div>

		<div>For me the top priority would be fixing the glitches around spell counter. I understand that changing the interface would be too big for GU3 (also I would really like it done) but damage assigned to the wrong person, spells overcastting spells (how can a mob cast two spells at the same time?) that I don’t know what I actually counter, feedback if someone else countered already the spell and spell counter consuming wards (which is for me the biggest glitch) should be not too big of a task.<br />
<br />
The spell tweaking is a question of taste. Some of your suggestions, I would not agree to. <br />
The recast timer glitch is a bug. I agree it should get fixed soon. <br />
The ward drop is a bug, creating a single target version is not a fix. <br />
Seradon's Falling Star is a nice spell, not very useful I agree, but I don’t see the need to change the concept of the spell. <br />
I think Taqmir's Barrage’s worth depends on your equipment. With high crit equipment (and some spell haste) it does decent damage and it’s save to cast. <br />
The Chaos Volley self crits may only be an issue with high int/sdf/sdr (legendary crit from the 13th and 14th cast may kill me but legendary crits are rare and I usually don’t need the 13th and 14th cast to get a dead mob if I go with the crit finisher). I can’t remember dying from them without some stupidity on my side involved as well. I don’t see why the resist from the mob should have effect on the casters feedback. <br />
Energy Rift does not scale well. Most of the spells don’t scale well. Mob is scaling but is at all levels to easy. I think Vanguard follows the concept of small encounters (the CC limitations and game engine going down in performance with larger encounters are examples for this). Building strong AE spells will trivialize content or just wipe your group if the mob is not trivial (AE kiting is the only use I currently see for AE spells, do you think AE was put in game to safely kite large mob groups?). Based on this, I really don’t know if it makes sense to change this without changing a lot more in the game as well. For Icequake it is the same.<br />
Forget is still a puzzle to me. If you get aggro, this spell will not help you. The spell is even not able to lower the aggro in a way that you don’t get back aggro when the effect of a rescue wears off (and I assume the tank taunts during the rescue duration as well).</div>
