      <p>This quest starts out in North Qeynos inside the Crow's Tavern. Once 
        inside, speak to the Erudite librarian named Umvera Dekash:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><b>You say</b>, 'hail Umvera Dekash' </p>
        <p><b>Umvera Dekash says</b> 'What, Graffe ? Do I look like a merchant 
          to you? Just because all these merchants are in my library, it doesn't 
          mean that I am one. If you are interested in something other than spell 
          scrolls, then, we can talk. </p>
        <p><b>You say</b>, 'I am interested' </p>
        <p><b>Umvera Dekash says</b> 'Ah, so you do have half a wit about you! 
          Very well. As you can clearly see, I am the librarian here. I keep track 
          of all of the mystic tomes that enter this divine building. I also take 
          care of all of the purchasing. Have you something to offer? </p>
        <p><b>You say</b>, 'I have something to offer' </p>
        <p><b>Umvera Dekash says</b> 'Excellent! You have no idea how difficult 
          it is to get good help these days. Do you think you would have the time 
          to gather some information for me? </p>
        <p><b>You say</b>, 'I think I will have the time to help you gather information' 
        </p>
        <p><b>Umvera Dekash says</b> 'Even better! Well, it has been some time 
          since the Tesch Val gnolls moved in on the Split Paw. That being said, 
          we still know little to nothing of their origins. If you can bring me 
          back the four scrolls that our diviners speak of, I believe I can reward 
          you well. </p>
        </blockquote>
      <p>The scrolls he wants are four different LORE Tanned Split Paw Skins, 
        which are dropped randomly off Gnolls in Infected Paw and look like actual 
        scrolls, not spells. Each skin/scroll can be identified and each has a 
        number from 1 through 4 that will appear near the beginning of the identify 
        message. Being that they are LORE, you cannot have two of one scroll so 
        that should narrow things down for you as well. </p>
      <p>After you have each of the four scrolls, head back to North Qeynos and 
        visit Umvera Dekash again in the Crow's Tavern. Hand him the scrolls and 
        in turn, will give you a book of the translated split paw skins. Umvera 
        will then inform you that you need to have the book bound by Jheron Felkis.</p>
      <p>Jheron Felkis can be found in East Freeport at &quot;Velith &amp; Bardo's 
        Imported Goods&quot; upstairs in the first room. Give the book to Jheron 
        and it will rewrite itself into a series of letters written by the Ishva 
        Verishe Val called "A Paw Book". Take this new book back to Umvera in 
        North Qeynos and he will give you a sealed letter to take to Durkis Battlemore.</p>
      <p>You can find Durkis in the Butcherblock Mountains inside a hut near Kaladim, 
        on he path from the docks. Give Durkis the sealed letter and he will give 
        you a set of Gem Inlaid Gauntlets.</p>
