    NOTES: Requires master quadder. Not for beginners or for weak total mana 
    and/or regen outputs. <br>
    <br>
    First kill Lower camp: TECHNIQUE LOWER CAMP: Use lev and invis -&gt; lev over 
    lower camp at angle to right with outside right bandit targetted -&gt; float 
    down a bit away from outside right bandit -&gt; 3rd person/pan view mouselook 
    view almost a must -&gt; cast snare on target bandit as you are floating down 
    and timing it so you'll be on same planar level and (will snare 3) -&gt; whole 
    camp (4 bandits) will aggro -&gt; run off lower hill and retarget 4th aggro 
    unsnared bandit and snare as he comes off hill -&gt; vector together 3 snare 
    and 1 snare toward empty hut -&gt; blast them in a racetrack pattern around 
    tall mushroom plants and empty huts and whole open area. You will see you 
    actually have tons of room. Kill with Pillar of Flame. <br>
    <br>
    Second Kill Upper Camp (4 only) TECHNIQUE FOR UPPER CAMP: After lower camp 
    dead -&gt; Target outside right bandit (2 pair - the one closest to the goranga 
    thingies) -&gt; lev jump off back of midline ridge between bandit camps -&gt; 
    Float down between &quot;V&quot; gap bit off the ledge (you'll be floating above 
    goranagas - they won't ever aggro if you havent killed them and gone kos) -&gt; 
    cast snare as you float down near level with bandits -&gt; snare (will bag 2) 
    and 2 nearest fire will aggro-&gt; other 2 almost always stay put -&gt; turn and 
    run toward right and lev run over now empty (20 minute repop) lower camp. 
    Use same line coming off lower hill and retarget 1 of the 2 aggro unsnared 
    as they run thru lower camp -&gt; you should get both with 1 snare cast -&gt; 
    wheel to toward the huts and vector 2 original snare (should be coming down 
    thru lower camp - you wont see them at first - but they will surely come) 
    and 2 fresh snare and run racetrack pattern to huts, etc as in first camp 
    pull.<br>
    <br>
    3rd Kill (If You have insane mana regen and gobs of mana) TECHNIQUE FOR Lake 
    camp: Run the humpline and flux staff pull closest bandit -&gt; Run the hump 
    back toward racetrack open area (near empty huts/mushroom trees). -&gt; stop at 
    rock and cast snare as they come off ridge, should get 3, many times you 
    will get all 4 -&gt; once snared run racetrack pattern, etc.<br>
    <br>
    DANGERS: You blow a snare they can kill you quick if your not careful. 
    Danger becomes almost non-existant as you master the camps and pulls or if 
    you have a lot of hps and are near level 65, AA, etc. With Nexus gate and 
    exodus, risk is really minimal.<br>
    <br>
    BENEFITS: Bandit rings. Camps are always open. Nice experience for a level 
    58 or so. Even at level 65, 4 bandits nets you a solid 4.5% AAXP per pull. 
    Not much but with 5K mana, 200 AAXP and buffs, you'll put down a pack of 4 
    with approx only 45% mana cost. You'll be killing 12 per 20-22 minutes or 
    so. Thats 35% (or more) AAXP per hour and &lt;3 hours gets you an AAXP. Not too 
    bad for an old SOL camp. Not too bad if you need to finish off an AAXP real 
    quickly and reliably. Certainly not like a supercharged POP group, but its a 
    nice quad challenge even at 65. A level 59 doing bandits makes for a fast 
    level...<br>
    <br>
    NOTED QUIRKYNESS: Before major resistance changes over a year ago, these 
    things resisted quite a bit. After that, at level 60 THEY NEVER RESIST A 
    SPELL EVER. I suspect they don't resist at any level. The only thing they 
    resist is they will sometimes give you a partial critical. So no fear that 
    you blow a snare, they simply stop resisting (ANY SPELL YOU THROW AT EM) if 
    you are 60 plus or even lower probably.</font><p>&nbsp;</p>
