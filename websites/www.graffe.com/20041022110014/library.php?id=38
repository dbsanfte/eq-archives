    Minimum Level: 34<br>
    Maximum Level: 42 <br>
    Zone Name: The Overthere<br>
    Camp Area/LOC: West and South sides<br>
    Mob List (HP): Sarnaks, Succulant, Cockatrice<br>
    Availability (1->10): 6 (depends on pull groups)<br>
    Loot Ranking (1->10): 3<br>
    Diff.Ranking (1->10): 6 (Rhinos/Cats/SoW'd Sarnaks)<br>
    Faction Affected: Sarnaks<br>
    <br>
    Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: This is a great zone to learn to quad in. The 
    mobs are plentiful and the spawn times high. The easiest things to quad are 
    Sarnaks; start with berserkers and move up to knights.<br>
    <br>
    Sarnaks - Social; if there is more than one (1) they will chase you forever, 
    if there's only one and it is snared it will freeze.<br>
    <br>
    Succulants - Non-social; if they are close and low and snared they will 
    stand still. These will wander off if you leave a certain radius so keep 
    them close when you're finishing a quad. Get them all low and the same time 
    and they will all freeze in a group giving you an easy finish.<br>
    <br>
    Cockatrice - See Succulants<br>
    <br>
    The main dangers here are the adds. Rhinos and cats are SoW speed. If you 
    pick one up, dart up a hill/rock and Shadow Step then gate or root it fast 
    and zone out. There are a ton of wandering mobs as well, so keep your eyes 
    open. You can quad along the southern hillside with few wanderers between 
    the Frontier Mountain zone line (ledge) and the SE corner. Another great 
    line is along the gorge running north and south since it is almost devoid of 
    wanderers.<br>
    <br>
    I have found that grabbing a mob then running ahead, invising up and then 
    looking for more worked great. It kept down the adds until I chose to break 
    invis and the tagged mobs continued to follow. Only Sarnaks will add on 
    their friends, so it greatly minimizes your risk while tagging mobs. </span>
