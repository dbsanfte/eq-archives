Completing this quest allows the quester and anyone grouped
at thefinal turnin to zone into Tactics and hunt there, but not to progress past that point in the storyline. Storyline advancement requires you to get a Tactics flag by killing the Manaetic Behemoth in Plane of Innovation.</p>
                                                                                
<p>The quest is a simple one that starts in Plane of Storms. Follow the cave near the zone-in all the way to the back, where you'll find a gnome named Wembly the Forlorn.</p>
                                                                                
<b>You say, 'Hail, Wembly the Forlorn'</b><br>
Wembly the Forlorn grumbles under his breath, 'Yes, yes, I see you there. No need for you to shout I can see you just fine! Now, what was I saying? Yes that's right... let me know when you are [done].<br>
<b>You say, 'I am done'</b><br>
Wembly the Forlorn says 'Yes done! Weren't you paying attention? Once you've gathered all the pieces of the [key] bring it to me and I'll put them back together for you.'<br>
<b>You say, 'What key?'</b><br>
Wembly the Forlorn says 'THE Key, you really are as thick skulled as you look. You [agree to help] me and you aren't even paying attention.'<br>
<b>You say, 'I will agree to help'</b><br>
Wembly the Forlorn says 'You agree to help? Great! I haven't even told you what
I needed yet, or why. It is very noble of you to offer me your assistance. I've
been trapped here for a little too long, I washed up on the shore still [tied to the mast] of my ship. Wonder that I even survived the storm.'<br>
<b>You say, 'Why were you tied to the mast?'</b><br>
Wembly the Forlorn says 'The Diaku Raiders, filthy sort if you ask me. I was out on a shipping run, when Diaku attacked, they pillaged all of my goods, then tied me to the mast and left me floating a sea. Then the storm came and ate my ship, and I woke up here, I swear that I saw some [Diaku] washed up on the shore with me.'<br>
<b>You say, 'What Diaku?'</b><br>
Wembly the Forlorn says 'The Diaku that attacked me! Pay attention for Karana's
sake! You appear to be the fighting sort. You can help me kill the Diaku at their source in [Drunder].'<br>
<b>You say, 'What Drunder?'</b><br>
Wembly the Forlorn says 'Drunder! The Fortress of Zek, the Zeks don't trust any
one mortal to have free access to the fortress. The Diaku come and go in fours,
and four parts are needed for entry. Of course they won't part with them easily. If you find four, and bring me four, I can make the four into one, and with one, you can get into Drunder without three more. Then, with your one, you can kill all of them. I would do it myself, but with my bad knee and all. . .'<br>
                                                                                
<p>In the desert area of Plane of Storms, you will occasionally find Diaku Raiders. They are rare spawns and they drop talismans of various sorts. You need four different talismans (they're LORE) to complete the quest.</p>
                                                                                
<p>The Diaku Raiders are are aggressive (unlike most mobs in the desert), but they do not summon (everything else in the desert does). A tracker is useful in hunting them down. Kill enough to get the four parts of a talisman, then return to hand them in to Wembly.</p>
                                                                                
<p>When you turn in the four pieces, all members of your group will receive a flag that allows you to zone into Drunder, Fortress of Zek.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
