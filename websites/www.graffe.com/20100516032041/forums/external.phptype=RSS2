			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I have posted my thoughts on the administration's foray into thinking it may want to avoid Miranda in some cases.   My thoughts there are all based on my analysis as a lawyer who very much believes in applying the rights in the constitution consistently.<br />
<br />
However, as much as I am the liberal in applying our 5th Amendment right against self incrimination in a manner consistent with that language and the cases interpreting it, I would like to have a parallel discussion on an issue without muddying up that thread.<br />
<br />
Here's my question - stepping back from the fact that the right IS in the Fifth Amendment and pretending we were going to write a brand new Bill of Rights to go into effect on 1/1/11, would YOU include a right against self incrimination in there?  If so, why?  What is the historical reason we as a society guaranty such a right?  Are those historical reasons still present today?  Is there a fundamental moral reason we don't want people to implicate themselves?  Is it a matter of trustworthiness or some base sense of fairness?<br />
<br />
I think this should be an interesting thread.  I hope folks can discuss this without jumping to absolutes and name calling.<br />
<br />
Here is a link to one site discussing the historical basis for the right we treasure - <a href="http://www.rcarterpittman.org/essays/Bill_of_Rights/Privilege_Against_Self-Incrimination.html" target="_blank">http://www.rcarterpittman.org/essays...imination.html</a></div>

			(May 14) -- A man in Washington state who branded his children like cattle has been acquitted of second-degree assault charges.<br />
<br />
A jury in Port Angeles deadlocked Thursday on two lesser charges of fourth-degree assault, and a judge declared a mistrial on those counts.<br />
<br />
The two teenage sons of 39-year-old Mark J. Seamands testified that they had wanted to be branded.<br />
<br />
The Sequim (SKWIM') man was branded himself. He testified he wanted to bring the family closer together while he was going through a divorce. Seamands' ex-wife said she was horrified when she saw the scars.<br />
<br />
Seamands' 18-year-old daughter also was branded, but the dad wasn't charged with assaulting her because she was old enough to give consent.<br />
<br />
The children were branded with the letters &quot;SK,&quot; which stands for &quot;Seamands' kids.&quot;

		<hr />
		
			CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Sarah Palin told NRA members meeting here that the only reason President Obama and his allies aren't trying to limit gun ownership rights is the fear of a political backlash.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't doubt for a minute that, if they thought they could get away with it, they would ban guns and ban ammunition and gut the Second Amendment,&quot; Palin told the annual NRA gathering Friday. She urged some 9,000 NRA members to &quot;stop them in their tracks.&quot;<br />
<br />
The NRA's &quot;Celebration of American Values&quot; event was part political rally, part Tea Party gathering, with a parade of mostly Republican warm-up acts before Palin, the day's star, spoke. An NRA member, she electrified the crowd with a speech that defended Alaska, the Second Amendment and America, and attacked President Obama, the &quot;lamestream media,&quot; and gun control activists -- &quot;anti-Second Amendment rights activists,&quot; she called them. <br />
<br />
While some might dismiss her as an &quot;NRA gun-nut chick,&quot; she said, those folks don't get it. &quot;Criminals are, of course, to blame for the crimes,&quot; she said. &quot;It's the bad guys, not the piece of metal.&quot; All gun bans do is &quot;take them away from law-abiding citizens.&quot;<br />
<br />
Palin said Second Amendment rights – which &quot;protect the weak from the strong&quot; -- are &quot;so important especially&quot; for women and minorities.<br />
In front of this friendly crowd that interrupted her speech with applause and stood for much of it, she attacked hypocritical &quot;celebrities, Hollywood types,&quot; who produce violent &quot;shoot 'em-up action films.&quot; They employ armed bodyguards and live in gated communities, she said, but &quot;have a problem with you owning a gun to protect you and your family.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Those left-wing groups are supposed to be so tolerant of everybody's lifestyle, but they're intolerant of our lifestyle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Palin took a comedy break midway through her speech to embrace her &quot;redneck&quot; spirit, saying that some jokes she has heard &quot;aren't funny, these are me.&quot; If shopping for dinner involves an orange vest or camo, then you're a redneck? That's me, she said.<br />
<br />
But, turning her remarks toward politics and November, she said, &quot;I can't wait for these midterm elections . . . We'll show them what we think of this fundamental transformation of America that we have been promised.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chelsey Vanderpool of San Diego gave her a thumbs-up. &quot;She seems honest, a real person,&quot; said the 25-year-old student, who has served in the Navy. Her husband is deployed and most of her family is military, she told me.<br />
<br />
While none of the other speakers had the star power of Palin, a few got ovations for choice one-liners.<br />
<br />
Ken Blackwell, former Ohio secretary of state and the author, with Ken Klukowski, of &quot;The Blueprint: Obama's Plan to Subvert the Constitution and Build an Imperial Presidency&quot;: <br />
<br />
&quot;Rights are gifts from God, not grants of state.&quot;<br />
<br />
Former United Nations ambassador John Bolton (the U.N. got booed): <br />
&quot;Today we've got a different kind of president, the first post-American president.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michael Reagan, radio host and son of President Ronald Reagan:<br />
&quot;Liberals are like termites, eating away at the foundation of this country every day. That is their job.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.): <br />
&quot;When our freedoms are threatened, battle is our calling.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lt. Col. Oliver North:<br />
&quot;If there was no NRA, then we would have to invent one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rep. Mike Pence (R-Ind.):<br />
I am &quot;a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just a few Democrats got face time, and they spent it shoring up their gun-loving bona fides. Rep. Heath Shuler of North Carolina spoke about NASCAR's moonshine-running roots and the joys of father-and-son hunting excursions. &quot;I don't think there's another member of Congress who buys more ammunition in a year than I do,&quot; he said.

			Rizzo said he was bothered by a recent spate of stories about cops who have retired from the force a day before they were arrested.<br />
<br />
Many have interpreted the sudden retirements as last-ditch attempts on the cops' behalf to save their pension benefits.<br />
<br />
Officer Anthony Floyd, a 14-year veteran, retired on Tuesday, and was charged the following day with assaulting and harrassing a woman he was dating.<br />
<br />
Another longtime cop, Tyrone Wiggins, retired a day before he was arrested on rape charges in November.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can't have cops retiring one day, then getting arrested the next,&quot; Rizzo said.<br />
<br />
Even cops fired for gross misconduct are not blocked from receiving a pension. Also this week, Police Commissioner Charles H. Ramsey fired Sgt. Robert Ralston after the 21-year veteran admitted that he shot himself last month and created a phony story about being shot by a black man with cornrows.<br />
<br />
<b>Chapter 22-1300 of the city code states that a city employee could lose retirement benefits only if he or she pleads or is found guilty of perjury; accepting or offering a bribe; engaging in graft or corruption; theft, embezzlement or willful misapplication of city funds; malfeasance in office or engaging in conspiracy to commit any of the above.</b>
			
		<hr />

</div> This pension issue came up after officer Frank Tepper retired the day before he was arrested for murder and another officer was arrested for rape.<br />

on one hand hand he gets praised for it, maybe a medal, but is made by the &quot;voice of auhtority&quot; to tell others &quot;it was a bad thing!&quot;<br />

Another thing is, here we have a black dude, doing a good thing, he's obviously not some toff or celeb w*nker, but an ordinary bloke, so a great role model, and yet his brave action is said to be &quot;bad&quot; by authority...yet they say they want more positive black role models...conflicting stupidty, eh? <br />

Flashforward and Better Off Ted are getting the axe.  Scrubs is cancelled too, but it should never have come back this year anyway, so who cares? :)

Hope they at least let Flashforward wrap up their storyline, but since next week is the season finale (I think) I doubt they will.</div>

&#9824; A fully customized Fallout: New Vegas deck of cards. Each card in the pack has been uniquely illustrated to depict characters and factions found within the game. Use the cards to play poker, blackjack or Caravan, an original card game that was created by Obsidian especially for New Vegas!<br />
&#9824; A recreation of the game's highly coveted &quot;Lucky 38&quot; platinum chip.<br />
&#9824; A hardcover graphic novel &quot;All Roads&quot;, that tells the story of some of the characters and events that lead up to Fallout: New Vegas. &quot;All Roads&quot; was written by Chris Avellone, the game's creative director, and created in conjunction with Dark Horse Comics.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Okay, keep up, because this gets a bit complicated. :)<br />
<br />
So this girl (we'll call her Girl A) told me that she likes me, and we've been friends for a really long time. She has a boyfriend, and she's said that she doesn't want to break up with him because she loves him. But she wants to start something with me.<br />
Another girl (we'll call her Girl B), who is another one of my close friends, posted an angry Facebook status about seeing something that ripped her heart out, so I commented that we should go for a walk so that she could tell me about it. We did, and she told me that she liked me, and that she saw Girl A kiss me in the hallway at school. So I told her all about Girl A, and the situation with her boyfriend. I also told Girl B that I like her too, and I do. <br />
So we went home, and I got on Facebook. I don't have a Myspace, but Girl A and B do. Girl A told me via Facebook that Girl B had posted a status about her. Something along the lines of &quot;Kissing girls and dating a guy, huh? You've got some issues honey, 'cause I'm sure your boyfriend doesn't know about this.&quot;. That really upset Girl A. Her boyfriend commented on it saying that he DID know about it and telling her to stay the f*** out of their relationship. Now both girls are mad at each other, and I'm in the middle and I feel really bad about causing all of this. <br />
I guess that's high school, huh? <br />
And I'm staying over the night at Girl A's house this weekend, and I dunno what to do.<br />
Oh, and my parents are talking about divorce, my soap opera got canceled, and some fat chick in my gym class doesn't like me because she thinks I'm weird. :D<br />
XOXO, <br />
