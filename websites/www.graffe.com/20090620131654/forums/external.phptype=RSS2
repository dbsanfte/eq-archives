				Pardon the cliche, but it's one of the holiest of Holy Grails of technology: Wireless power. And while early lab experiments have been able to &quot;beam&quot; electricity a few feet to power a light bulb, the day when our laptops and cell phones can charge without having to plug them in to a wall socket still seems decades in the future.<br />
<br />
Nokia, however, has taken another baby step in that direction with the invention of a cell phone that recharges itself using a unique system: It harvests ambient radio waves from the air, and turns that energy into usable power. Enough, at least, to keep a cell phone from running out of juice.<br />
<br />
While &quot;traditional&quot; (if there is such a thing) wireless power systems are specifically designed with a transmitter and receiver in mind, Nokia's system isn't finicky about where it gets its wireless waves. TV, radio, other mobile phone systems -- all of this stuff just bounces around the air and most of it is wasted, absorbed into the environment or scattered into the ether. Nokia picks up all the bits and pieces of these waves and uses the collected electromagnetic energy to create electrical current, then uses that to recharge the phone's battery. A huge range of frequencies can be utilized by the system (there's no other way, really, as the energy in any given wave is infinitesimal). It's the same idea that Tesla was exploring 100 years ago, just on a tiny scale.<br />
<br />
Mind you, harvesting ambient electromagnetic energy is never going to offer enough electricity to power your whole house or office, but it just might be enough to keep a cell phone alive and kicking. Currently Nokia is able to harvest all of 5 milliwatts from the air; the goal is to increase that to 20 milliwatts in the short term and 50 milliwatts down the line. That wouldn't be enough to keep the phone alive during an active call, but would be enough to slowly recharge the cell phone battery while it's in standby mode, theoretically offering infinite power -- provided you're not stuck deep underground where radio waves can't penetrate.<br />
<br />
Nokia says it hopes to commercialize the technology in three to five years.

I'm new to these, but do play Backgammon in real life. I happened to try the online MS Backgammon since about Feb this year and much to my surprise found that after a few games, the play became bias towards trying to equalise things out, almost as if &quot;the system&quot; is programmed to try and either equal the stakes or as I have found more recently, just issue the opponent with win-win dice throws, some games I have found to be totally un-realistic in the probability of dice runs.<br />
<br />
If this is the case, I don't see the point in playing these on-line games.<br />
<br />
Anybody got any views on this ?<br />

When I was training many years ago now, a Tutor of ours asked a question to a fellow student who replied with great confidence the answer and then followed the answer with &quot; I'll stake my life on it&quot;, the Tutor paused for a moment and then replied:  Ok, but may I suggest that you stake someone else's life on that answer just incase it's wrong ! &quot;<br />
<br />
The student replied: &quot; Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Tutor replied: &quot;because with that answer, you could have mis-judged the question&quot;, to which the student replied: &quot;but that was your answer to my question two weeks ago !!&quot; :grinyes:</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Thanks to finally getting a new mp3 player after my iAudio went down in a blaze of glory (and poorly soldered connections), I've had a golden opportunity to poke around at podcasts and the like.  I found a few awesome things again like Podiobooks and Secret World Chronicles and finally ended up on Decoder Ring Theater, mimicking old radio dramas.  Fast Forward a few weeks to random wiki surfing and I end up on an article about Dimension X; a 1950s sci-fi radio drama with the following description:<br />
<br />
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; width: 100%;">

			<hr />
			
				Preceded by Mutual's 2000 Plus (1950-52), Dimension X was not the first adult science fiction series on radio, but the acquisition of previously published stories immediately gave it a strong standing with the science fiction community, as did the choice of well established, respected writers in the field: Isaac Asimov, Robert Bloch, Ray Bradbury, Fredric Brown, Robert A. Heinlein, Murray Leinster, H. Beam Piper, Frank M. Robinson, Clifford D. Simak, William Tenn, Jack Vance, Kurt Vonnegut, Jack Williamson and Donald A. Wollheim. Ernest Kinoy and George Lefferts adapted most of the stories and also provided original scripts.
			
			<hr />

	</tr>
	</table>
</div>This all leads to the discovery that all 50 episodes are preserved online in mp3 format: <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Dimension_X_Singles" target="_blank">http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Dimension_X_Singles</a>.  Archive.org has an entire old radio section with other shows saved and even a full day's programming from the D-day invasion.  Everything I've poked at is in mp3 format and readily downloadable or streamed from the site.  I figured there has to be at least one other person on Graffe's who'd get a kick out of this.</div>

				Story Highlights<ul><li>300,000 cases of Nestle Toll House refrigerated cookie dough being recalled</li>
<li>66 cases of food-borne illness reported in 28 states; dough is one common link</li>
<li>Dough may be contaminated with E. coli, which causes gastric symptoms</li>
<li>Nestle: E. coli not detected in product; recall is safety precaution</li>
</ul><br />
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Two federal agencies warned consumers Friday not to eat raw Nestle Toll House refrigerated cookie dough.<br />
<br />
The company said it is recalling an estimated 300,000 cases of the dough as a precaution after reports of food-borne illness in 28 states.<br />
<br />
There are concerns that the premade dough may be contaminated with the bacterium E. coli 0157:H7, which causes abdominal cramping, vomiting and diarrhea, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Young children and the elderly can suffer more serious symptoms.<br />
<br />
Nestle issued a statement saying, &quot;While the E. coli strain implicated in this investigation has not been detected in our product, the health and safety of our consumers is paramount, so we are initiating this voluntary recall.&quot;<br />
<br />
According to Nestle spokeswoman Laurie MacDonald, raw dough was one of the things the sick people reported eating.<br />
<br />
&quot;The health and safety of our consumers is our No. 1 priority,&quot; she said. &quot;We felt the best thing to do is a voluntary recall.&quot;<br />
<br />
She said the company was informed by the FDA Wednesday night &quot;and immediately took action.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We really want to remind consumers that raw cookie dough should not be eaten,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Since March, the CDC says, 66 people have become sick in 28 states after eating raw cookie dough. Twenty-five people were hospitalized. No one has died.<br />
<br />
The FDA and the CDC say people who have become sick after eating refrigerated Toll House cookie dough should contact their doctors.<br />
<br />
They advise consumers to throw out all prepackaged, refrigerated Nestle Toll House cookie dough products. Retailers and restaurateurs should not sell or serve any Toll House cookie dough products, the agencies said.<br />
<br />
The company said the market share for Nestle Toll House refrigerated cookie dough for the most recent 52-week period was 41 percent.<br />
<br />
The recall does not include already-baked Toll House cookies, varieties of Toll House morsels, chocolate baking bars or cocoa or Dreyer's and Edy's ice cream products with Nestle Toll House cookie dough ingredients.

				For everyone looking to hop the next commercial flight to space, your departure gate has finally been announced. Almost two years after the first plans were announced, construction has finally begun on Spaceport America. The spaceport, which will serve as the launch and landing pad for Virgin Galactic flights, is the first of its kind anywhere in the world, and represents the first serious commitment of infrastructure to manned commercial spaceflight.<br />
<br />
According to the the project website the festivities kick off today with a a panel of speakers, food and drink, and even a mariachi band. Tomorrow, the construction begins in earnest.<br />
<br />
Currently, Virgin Galactic only has two space ships, so it will probably be sometime before the facility experiences O'Hare and LaGuardia level traffic. So now might be the best time to sign up for a flight, before Spaceport America starts experiencing the soul-crushing delays that keep John Grisham, Hudson News, and Brookstone in business.

				Fresh off the news that he’s won a spot in the Guiness Book of World Records for directing “the biggest explosion on film with actors present,” reports say Michael Bay has filmed his last Transformers movie and has had enough of big-budget blockbusters.<br />
<br />
Bay says he’s sick of receiving negative reviews from critics who dislike his movie-making style and is determined to move away from the genre. He says, “It’s easy to go shoot an art movie in a winery in the South of France. But people have no idea how hard it is to create something like Transformers. They review me before they’ve even seen the movie.”<br />
And Bay admits that if film bosses give the go ahead for a third Transformers movie, they will have to find a different director. He adds, “After the three and a half years I’ve spent making these movies, I feel like I’ve had enough of the Transformers world. I need to do something totally divergent, something without any explosions.” [movietickets - note: I'm not sure how reliable this source is]<br />
<br />
Michael Bay trying to live a life after explosions would make a classic fish-out-of-water reality show.  It would be like when Superman gives up his powers in Superman II, or that old State sketch where an aging pornstar becomes a gas station attendant, and keeps pulling the nozzle out and spraying the gas all over the hood.  It’ll be like that except with Michael Bay going, “What do you mean I can’t bring my tiger in here?  Now the chaps are just going to look ridiculous.  Yeah?  Yeah?  Same to you, buddy.  I wouldn’t let my tiger crap in this dump.”

I was actually a little bummed when I read this. The guy's movies may not be Oscar worthy, but they are fun to watch. I wonder who is going to fill the void that he is about to leave?</div>

1,000 Bonus points for those that say yes: How many miles will it be from land before being shot down or splash into the ocean?</div>

I'm sure this movie will join the classics like Armageddon, The Day After Tomorrow, and Independence Day. It's just that bad/good.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I read something the other day that got me thinking about how society changes, how things evolve into mainstream; whether it be a new technology, or a new idea, or a new style of music.<br />
<br />
Change.<br />
<br />
Howard Roark, the fictional archetect from the Ayn Rand book probably said it best, and I'll paraphrase, &quot;the man who invented fire was probably burned at the stake for making a deal with the devil, yet from that point on, his brothers had fire to keep them warm and light up the darkness.&quot;<br />
<br />
Do you remember what it was like when you were a child? You had guardians to keep you safe, you had a security blanket to pick you up when you fall. Everything was new. Learning was exciting. The unexplored was dangerous, but thrilling. You knew nothing, and the world was for you to uncover.<br />
<br />
And then you grew older. The safety nets were replaced with responsibilities. The discoveries became less frequent, and your life fell into a pattern of familiarity. The unexplored was still dangerous, but far less thrilling, since the unexplained had risks. You knew more about the world, and yet at the same time you lost something. You lost that sense of adventure and excitement from learning something new. You gained opinions, and change became a fearful thing.<br />
<br />
In many ways, you are less of a person than you were when you were young.<br />
<br />
Youth.<br />
<br />
The young are free. They have less care, they have fewer opinons, they have more choices. When a young person encounters something new, they are curious, they want to dissemble it, learn about it, make it their own. And this is how social change comes about.<br />
<br />
If I were to invent something new today, something radical, something that would change the world, I might be burned at the stake for it, but not by the young. I would be crucified by my peers, by the entrenched, by the adults. Beaurocracy hates innovation - it tends to make them look bad, especially if innovation does what they do, but does it smarter, better, faster.<br />
<br />
No so the young. They will see the things they refuse to see. They will accept, they will apply, they will learn what the future can give them, and they will be better for it.<br />
<br />
The world evolves, ideas change, people move forward, but isn't it funny how the young become old? How the new ideas that they grew up with become right? How the creations of their peers become dangerous, and the generation that follows thinks - I'll never be like them!<br />
<br />
Remember that when you grow old - this world isn't yours, it belongs to your children, and their children, and the generations that follow. It is our place to guide, to teach that fire burns, but also to remember that first person who found out how to make fire on demand and realize that the night would be a lot scarier for all of us if he had been afraid of the new.</div>

The city government in Bozeman, Montana, isn't content to cyberstalk its potential employees—they're now asking applicants for their login information for any social networking sites.</b><br />
<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
&quot;Please list any and all, current personal or business websites, web pages or memberships on any Internet-based chat rooms, social clubs or forums, to include, but not limited to: Facebook, Google, Yahoo, YouTube.com, MySpace, etc.&quot; the form reads. But Bozeman isn't simply interested in finding out where to look for potentially embarrassing personal details; the city wants full disclosure, since the form demands username and password information for each. City employees will apparently be able to dig through any information applicants have put online, regardless of whether it's accessible to the public.<br />
<br />
[...]</div>

	</tr>
	</table>
</div>I can't believe that this is actually supposed to be legal. And if the city can do it, what's to stop private employers to follow suit?</div>
