          about last night's Quest on Povar:<i><br>
          &quot;I made a decision tonight that could possibly have been one of 
          the dumbest decisions of my time playing EQ. King Tearis Thex decided 
          to have a gathering in Felwithe tonight on the Povar server. Upon hearing 
          the news, I zapped myself straight to the GFay spires, and headed off 
          to Felwithe. When I arrived, hoards of players filled the zone (max 
          count of 101, I believe). Nothing happened for quite awhile, but then 
          "A Cute Rat", "A Rat", and "A Gator" appeared in the zone. Some merchants 
          began to shout for us to get rid of them. I decided that I would help, 
          so I proceeded to attack a (what I now know was level 50ish) gator. 
          The guards promptly dispatched me to my bind point (in Dragnor's Cauldron). 
          I laughed, shrugged it off, and began memorizing my spells. Suddenly, 
          I was "summoned by the Gods!" This is about the point where I made my 
          stupid mistake (I think). Where did I end up? I was summoned, by Templeton 
          The Wise, to Tox Forest, just outside the zone to Kerra Isle. Two other 
          players were summoned as well. Templeton started scolding us for attacking 
          the "sacred gator". He said "The king shall slay thee!" I begged for 
          his forgiveness, but he simply shouted "BEGONE!" After that, he said 
          "Poof", and vanished. I stood around for a few minutes (naked), wondering 
          what to do. Finally, I decided to gate back to GFay, and see what was 
          going on in Felwithe. King Tearis Thex came out, and was introduced 
          to his long lost daughter Firiona Vie. They talked for a little while, 
          then the king told us all to go home. This is about the time that I 
          smacked myself on the forehead, and wondered if I should have remained 
          in Tox Forest. I would really like to know what happened in Tox after 
          I hastily gated out. :(<br>

          -- Welcome to Gnomestock '99 -- <br>
          The purpose of this event is to celebrate the discovery of the Third 
          Book of Gimbleston. This book contains many useful and new tinkering 
          formulas, as well as some more words of wisdom from Gimbleston himself. 
          While the location of the book is still only known to a few, those few 
          have been generous enough to share its contents with all gnomes. This 
          act of sharing shows true gnome spirit. I and many others are forever 
          indebted and grateful to this person.<br>
        </p>
        <p>Some events at Gnomestock '99 will include: <br>
          - Fishing with collapsable fishing poles and animated bait. <br>
          - A small fireworks display. (snicker) <br>
          - Free beer and booze for all. <br>
          - High Diving at the great wheel. <br>
          - And just some general, 'Gnomeing about'.</p>
        <p>So come on out and meet everyone! I want to see Ak'anon packed with 
          gnomes, its our heritage, and I hope to see everyone there. <br>

          be doing this, but I need to ask that before you e-mail me asking a 
          question about our class, try the other avenues first. Try the message 
          board here, or try the <a href="http://www.onelist.com/community/EQ_Wizard" target="_blank">mailing 
          list</a> (this mailing list is not run by me but by onelist.com) to 
          see if anybody is willing to answer your question. If that fails, by 
          all means, e-mail me and I will see what I can do. I really wish I could 
          take the time to answer everyone's questions, but I am losing ground 
          with the site and I really wish to keep up with the content for all 
          of you. I might find another way around this by trying to find a high 
          level wizard that is mature, levelheaded, and willing to answer such 
          questions on his free time. If this pans out, then I'll issue that person 
          his own e-mail address and I will have a bit more time on my hands to 
          work on other aspects of this site and my life. =) Thank you all for

          or something of the like to have mana bar rise. It has been corrected

          The EQ Mana and Weapon Damage Calc3.0 (newer version 3.5 available 10/26/99) 
          is out! Now just simply select the weapons you want to compare from 
          the pop-up list and that weapon's damage and delay is automatically 
          put into the program. Then you just make a few clicks and you have your 
          comparison. You can still compare duel wield and double attack, and 
          you can also input values manually in case you find a weapon that is 
          not in the included database. The included database has detailed info 
          on all the weapons, including lore and/or magic, classes and races, 
          procs, and any bonuses. You can access all this information if you have 
          Access 97. If you don't have Access, don't worry because the next version 
          will have a feature to show you all this info. Just hit a button and

          run there and have a wizard invis you, jump in and survey the situation. 
          A little hint here also, you don't have to enter the tower from the

          <i>&quot; In doing this quest, which by the way is very fun, I came 
          across a very rough part. The rod of FANA which is in the bottom of 
          the lake in Oasis. This is at the top of a tower guarded by many, many 
          deepwater goblins. My friend did this alone about a month or so ago 
          at level 35 by going invis drinking a flask of enduring breath and swimming 
          up and grabbing it. Well doesn't seem so simple anymore. I tried and 
          died 3 times while trying to get it. he died 2 times. I had to call 
          in the help of my guild, a few level 50's for this. I am level 37 and 
          they smoked me very fast. some hit for 80's and they cast of course. 
          evidently Verant has made these buggers much harder. they can see through 
          invis and when my level 50 ranger showed up, with full Fear Plane gear 
          he was almost killed and he said a lot of them con blue to him. We brought 
          in a level 50 cleric to help the ranger kill them so I could safely 
          swim up. fine they wiped them all, about 7 or 8 and the respawn is about 
          2 mins or less on these things, they are like rabbits they spawn very 
          fast so could be a good spot to hunt because most 30 plus people are 
          doing specs and SG...finally we called in a druid, he cast wolf form 
          on me and the gobs all became apprehensive to me and I could swim right 
          up unharmed and grab the rod. beware if you are doing this and the other 
          level 45 wizard that was showing me around to these rods was shocked 
          at how much harder it was for me to get this rod than it was him just 
          a month or so ago so maybe something was changed in the last patch.&quot;</i><br>

          You say, 'where is the key?' <br>
          Linara Parlone says 'Last I knew, Najena's Priest had the key. I fear

          <i>&quot;Finally got a response to my petition, feedback's, and emails. 
          The quest works for those members who have not had specialization skills 
          reach 50. If you have two or more skill levels over 50, (a small amount 
          of people had skill levels in two or more increase beyond 50 prior to 
          the patch that limited it to one skill level above 50) and only one 
          is increasing now, albeit the wrong one, there is no help for you. One 
          of the GM's, Trailkis, if I remember correctly, is trying to work with 
          Verant trying to get this fixed so that those who have more than one 
          skill level at 50 or above can change their main skill level back to 
          49. If any who are in this position attempt the quest, they will end 
          up like me and be out the cost of one ruby, which for some can run about 
          160 pp. Good luck to all.&quot; </i><br>

          gate or a self only buff in the bottom spell slot. (As the AI will not
