   <title>Astral Armor Quest</title>
</head>
<body>
<I>Note: There are two 'titan's samples' quests, good
and evil, starting in the Erudin Palace and Paineel respectively.&nbsp;
The focus of this write-up is the good quest, since it rewards the quester
with nice INT-caster gear.&nbsp; The evil 'titan's samples' quest reward
is a kinda sad 2HB weapon for SK/Necro only.</i><br><br>
<I>Another note: Be forewarned that this quest involves killing
titans, great beasts that are revered, yeah worshiped, by the Stonebrunt-native
Kejeken race.  Killing any of these titans is considered an act of
religious heresy by the resident Kejekens who wander the Stonebrunt Mountains
and reside in the village of Kejek, high on a mountain. The Kejekens
will assist the titans if they see you fighting them and for every titan
you kill you will take a mean Kejeken faction hit.  In addition, you will take a Peace Keeper faction hit for killing Giang Yin and the Prowler of the Jungle.  Peace Keepers are the clerics and paladins of Erudin.</i><br><br>
<b><i>Getting Started:</i></b>
<I>As with most quests, you may not need to actually go through the
quest dialogue to do the quest. But here it is anyways. It
goes without saying that you need to have at least apprehensive faction
with Akbaq to complete the quest, maybe higher.</I><br><br>
<I>Find Akbaq Salid. He is in the Tower of the Crimson Hands (Wizard
Guild) on the third floor of the Erudin Palace. He is upstairs on
the first floor of the tower and looks like a wizard guildmaster.
Hail him to get the dialogue as follows:</i><br><br>
<b>You say, 'Hail, Akbaq Salid'</b><br><br>
<I>Akbaq Salid says 'Greetings Lunal! I have recently returned to Erudin
since hearing word of the titan spirits that inhabit the Stonebrunt Mountains.
Should you be heading in that direction there are some [samples] that I
am interested in acquiring.</I><br><br>
<b>You say, 'What samples?'</b><br><br>
<I>Akbaq Salid says 'The titan spirits of the Stonebrunt Mountains appear
in several various animal forms seemingly with different areas of influence
in the spirit world. I am interested in conducting some experiments on
the hides of the giant leopard titan and the giant sabretooth titan. Once
I have acquired those hides I will seek to conduct experiments on the [others].</I><br><br>
<b>You say, 'What others?'</b><br><br>
<I>Akbaq Salid says 'Once I have finished my studies of the feline titans
pelts I am interested in experimenting with the hides of the strongest
of the stonebrunt titans, the gigantic gorilla and the gargantuan panda!
The [ancient snake] that inhabits those mountains is another matter that
you may be interested in as well.</I><br><br>
<b>You say, 'What ancient snake?'</b><br><br>
<I>Akbaq Salid says 'I believe I have uncovered a process with which to
harness the mystical properties of the scales of the snake titan so that
they can be fashioned into a powerful robe. If you bring me the ancient
snake skin and some platinum thread I am sure there will be enough material
to craft multiple robes and I shall reward you with one for your assistance.</I><br><br>
<b><I>The Questing Begins!</I></b><br><br>
<I>Now head to the Stonebrunt Mountains zone and start looking for
titans! What you will hunt depends on the reward you want. See the
table below for information about the rewards and quest items/mobs.</I>

<br><br><I><b>A few tips for those taking on the titans:</I></b><br><br>
<i>First of all, almost all of the titans but one (the snake, I hear)
are IMMUNE to root/snare spells.  However, Giang Yin can be rooted with the level 39 wizard spell, Elnerick's Entombment
of Ice, although he breaks it easily.  Possibly other titans are vulnerable
to that spell as well but I haven't tried it on them. At any rate
I suggest going after the titans with a level-appropriate group rather
than trying something crazy like 'EEoI-nuking' them solo.  I've heard, but not confirmed that a high level SoW is enough
to outrun them.  Even if thats true, its possibly not enough speed to kite them well, though.  The titans
are susceptible to fear animal spells.</i><br><br>
<I>Second, the titans wander alot and can be hard to find.  Its
a good idea to bring a tracker with you since Stonebrunt is a large zone.&nbsp;
If no titans are up, there is not much you can do except just start killing
stuff until they spawn. Some have theorized that getting them to
spawn can be encouraged by killing everything from just rabbits to killing
others of their kind (ie killing leopards to get the Prowler of the Jungle
to spawn).</I><br><br>
<I>Lastly, Certain titans seem to be more common than others, especially
Old Ghostback and Giang Yin. Giang Yin paths near the Kejek
Village alot, and is often seen very close to the entrance. Beware!
The Kejekens will assist. Old Ghostback seems to wander more
towards the vicinity of the Warrens (but out in the zone a little).</I><br><br>
<b><I>Additional rewards:</i></b><br><br>
<I>The titans drop more than just their skins/hides. Its outside
of my intended scope to list all of them here, but suffice it to say that
there are some nice items dropped by the titans. The following titans
drop items usable by wizards: Giang Yin (a grey colored robe), Old Ghostback
(gloves), Prowler (leggings) and Slyder the Ancient (mantle).</I>
