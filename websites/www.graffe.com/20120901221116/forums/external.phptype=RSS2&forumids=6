			OTTAWA - Jessie Sansone and his family are reeling after he was arrested and strip searched by police after his four-year-old daughter drew a picture of a man with a gun in her Kitchener, Ont., kindergarten class.<br />
<br />
The 26-year-old father of four said Saturday the sketch was supposed to be him, getting the bad guys and monsters.<br />
<br />
The school must have thought differently, as after Nevaeh drew it Wednesday, the school contacted Family and Children's Services and they called police.<br />
<br />
Waterloo Police met Sansone at the school when he tried to pick up his kids he was told he was charged with possession of a firearm. He was then handcuffed and put him in one of the several squad cars waiting outside, he said.

			&quot;They came to my house, told my wife that I had been charged with possession of firearms, that she would have to come with them, and that Sundae (their infant daughter) would have to go with the social worker,&quot; said Sansone. Stephanie called her Mom who rushed over to take Sundae instead.<br />
<br />
&quot;My littlest is still in diapers with a bottle. Thank goodness my mother-in-law lives nearby,&quot; Sansone said.<br />
<br />
Once Stephanie got to the police station she had to wait.<br />
<br />
&quot;The detective was giving my wife the idea that our children were at the police station with her, just in another room at the station. She was waiting for over an hour, close to two hours, not knowing where the kids were,&quot; Sansone said.<br />
<br />
His children had been at Family and Children's Services, being interviewed by social workers.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, my wife was really panicking at that point. So her and the detective drove down to children's services. They questioned each of my children.&quot;

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Time for the annual college football post! Normally, I can't wait for college football as it is the true kick off for fall and it really makes the time until Christmas fly on by. For some reason, I'm not as excited as usual. Could be, in part, because of the whole Penn State fiasco never really got college football out the news and, the news wasn't good.<br />
<br />
More likely, Iowa's chances of winning more than 7 games are about the same likelihood as Romney's chances of pulling off a landslide victory this fall in November. Considering that the relentless pursuit of the AIRBHG (Angry Iowa Running Back Hating God....see here for more details: <a href="http://www.hawkeyenation.com/forum/football/44730-airbhg-complete-saga.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.hawkeyenation.com/forum/f...lete-saga.html</a>) has struck yet another round of Iowa running backs they are left with the starting running back being a freshmen, again. Not to mention, Garmon, the likely starter or soon to be starter once he learns the plays was already in offseason trouble. The defensive line is young and the offensive line is young as well. Iowa does have a new defensive and offensive coordinator, so it is a bit tougher to predict Iowa's season. They are under the radar, which is often a good sign for an Iowa team, however Iowa hasn't overperformed as a team since 2004. For that to happen, Iowa has to be solid in the trenches and I just haven't heard anything that really gives me any confidence. They do have a relatively forgiving schedule though so going 8-4 is a possibility. Michigan, Michigan State, and Nebraska all should be losses for them. Chalk up another inexplicable loss to Northwestern and that is 4. However, Iowa teams have had a nasty habit of losing to teams they shouldn't lose to so it is entirely possible that loss total goes up again. If Iowa loses to Iowa State and Minnesota again, Ferentz's seat is going to start feeling a bit toasty. So, I'll be reasonably optimistic and say Iowa will go 7-5 and finish in the middle of the Legends division in the Big Ten.<br />
<br />
As for the rest of the Big Ten, in my opinion Michigan is the team to beat. We'll find out very quickly just how good this team is as they open up against Alabama Saturday. They don't have to win this game, they just can't get blown out and at least put up a fight. For Michigan to gain respect, they have to put up some points against Alabama's defense. Denard usually starts off strong so it is possible. Speaking of Robinson, I think he will finally put together a complete season. Possibly a heisman run, but we'll see.<br />
<br />
Legends Division rankings:<br />
Michigan<br />
Michigan State<br />
Nebraska<br />
Iowa<br />
Northwestern<br />
Minnesota <br />
<br />
Leaders Division rankings:<br />
Wisconsin<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Penn State (even with sanctions they still managed to keep most of their talent. We won't see the affect of these sanctions until 2 or 3 years from now)<br />
Ohio State<br />
Illinois<br />
Purdue<br />
Indiana<br />
<br />
Yeah, just put Wisconsin in the conference championship game now. Only a collapse of epic proportions keeps this from happening (remember, even if Penn State and/or Ohio State finish ahead of Wisconsin they still go to the championship game).<br />
<br />
As for the rest of the country:<br />
<br />
I haven't followed the SEC too much this offseason so outside of Alabama I'm not sure who graduated whom. I'm sure LSU will be good again and the usual suspects will be up there. Missouri is in for a rude awakening though. It's not the Big 12 anymore. This time you have to play teams that actually have a defense every week, not just twice a season.<br />
<br />
I don't see any team stepping up to dethrone the SEC champ this season. Just so I have a prediction, my final 4 picks are...oh wait, that doesn't start until 2014-2015. Alabama will beat USC (I think they are eligible) in the MNC this year.</div>

<b><font size="4">Obama's Stimulus Failure: Tampa Recipients Have No Clue They Got Funds</font></b><br />
<br />
TAMPA, Fla. -- With the full docket of Republican convention speakers hammering him over the stimulus package he passed early in his presidency, Barack Obama said in an interview published Thursday morning that the main problem with the legislation was a public relations one.<br />
<br />
&quot;[W]e were in the midst of a once-in-a-lifetime crisis, so we had to just do stuff fast,&quot; Obama told Time magazine. &quot;And sometimes, it wasn’t popular. And we didn’t have the luxury of six months to explain exactly what we were doing with the Recovery Act, which was basically a jobs act and making sure middle-class families didn’t fall into poverty act.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's a convenient out for politicians to blame a policy's lack of popularity on an insufficient communications push, but in the case of the American Recovery Act, the president may have a point. The Huffington Post reached out to a dozen stimulus recipients in the Tampa area near the Republican convention to see how the bill affected them. Of those who agreed to talk about it, only one initially knew that they'd received any stimulus money.<br />
<br />
Jay Catalani didn't know the $22,550 contract he received to electrify water meters inside veteran cemeteries throughout Florida came from the government. <br />
<br />
&quot;I had no idea. I was a subcontractor bidding a job through another company,&quot; Catalani said. &quot;My check didn't come from the government. It came from the company we were working for.&quot;<br />
<br />
Catalani owns two companies near Tampa. The website for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act said the contract went to Light Vision of Tampa Bay, but Catalani recalled that the money went to his other company, called Electric Eels Inc. It was a subcontract from TL Services, a government contractor that received more than $13 million in stimulus funds. <br />
<br />
Catalani initially denied that his company benefited from the government spending, but changed his tune after HuffPost told him the precise amount of the contract as listed on Recovery.gov. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nobody explained the stimulus and nobody explained the health care bill,&quot; Catalani said. &quot;It should have been just literally peeled through like an onion and it wasn't.&quot; <br />
<br />
And yet, the stimulus has had a lasting impact on Catalani's company, which now has 12 workers. &quot;I ended up adding two employees,&quot; he said. &quot;I didn't know it was a stimulus, but it stimulated my company. And I still have them today. Even though it was only $20,000, but ... we were right on the cusp of, 'Hey, should we bring more people on or shouldn't we?' We brought two guys on and ended up keeping those two people.&quot;<br />
<br />
Like Catalani's business, Hamilton Engineering &amp; Surveying Inc, a Tampa civil engineering, environmental and land planning company, received a small infusion of stimulus cash. The $5,500 contract was so small, in fact, that officials didn't realize its origin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe that's why I don't know anything about it,&quot; Carol Scheafnocker, the company's chief marketing officer told The Huffington Post. &quot;I had no idea [we received stimulus money] whatsoever.&quot; <br />
<br />
Having not known about the stimulus funds, it was impossible for Scheafnocker to say how (or if) it had an impact on the company. But she said that business &quot;is definitely better than it was&quot; albeit &quot;not as good as it could be.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We are one of the ones who survived so I guess we are on the good side of things,&quot; she added.<br />
<br />
Steve Ward &amp; Associates Inc., a Tampa firm that represents manufacturers and does health care consulting, got $16,631 in stimulus funds. But Scott Moore, an official with the company, likewise couldn't recall what it was for nor whether they'd received it in the first place. <br />
<br />
&quot;Our corporate office can speak to that,&quot; he said. The corporate office ended up not returning a request for comment, but federal records suggest that the money was to renovate buildings (perhaps their own) with energy efficient features. <br />
<br />
It may be easy to not notice an infusion of $5,500 or $16,000 into some companies, but Tampa-based organizations that received far more stimulus funds were equally in the dark. The Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission of Florida's Tampa division received $117,000 in Recovery Act money (via the Department of Homeland Security) on Sept. 29, 2009. But a spokesman for the commission said he was unaware of the government help. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure that we got stimulus funds?&quot; Gary Morse, an official with the commission asked. &quot;OK, I have no clue about that. You would have to call our finance and accounting department in Tallahassee.&quot; <br />
<br />
A call to that department was not returned. But federal government records show that it received eight awards through the stimulus act totaling $640,000-plus dollars (a chunk of which went to Tampa). <br />
<br />
And therein lies the difficulties with the president's stimulus act sales job. Recipients often received help only after it had been filtered down through several other entities or government agencies.<br />
<br />
The Tampa chapter of the Girl Scouts of West Central Florida, for example, received $172,014 that originated with the stimulus. But it took a bit of digging from the group's Chief Financial Officer Michael Sapp to figure out how, exactly, it ended up in their coffers. The stimulus funds, he concluded upon investigation, weren't given directly from the federal government. Instead, the state used them to fill a hole in the Florida Mentoring grant program; the cash helped the group buy supplies, make payments to part-time staff, and execute the Girl Scout the program. <br />
<br />
But it wasn't stimulative as much as preventative. <br />
<br />
&quot;It didn't build anything. It was not tangible,&quot; said Sapp. &quot;To us, it was just the continuation of funding. I can't say if it helped or if it didn't help. They just shifted money into our pot.&quot; <br />
<br />
Sapp had considered taking advantage of another stimulus program -- administered by the Florida Department of Energy -- which would have covered a share of the cost of retrofitting the organization's old office building. But when it turned out that the project would have cost far more than the initial estimation, he balked at the idea. Instead, they moved locations, settling on an nondescript office building right off a busy road miles out of downtown Tampa, with a still-to-be-completed ground floor being designed, in part, by a dozen of young Girl Scout members. <br />
<br />
Henriquez Electrical Corporation, in Tampa, took advantage of the program that Sapp skipped. The company received $75,064 in stimulus funds to outfit its business with solar panels as part of an effort to lower its energy costs and show, to other companies, that it could do help them with their own retrofitting. <br />
<br />
Sharon Henriquez, the owner of the company, had no trouble recounting that she received stimulus cash, but she had mixed opinions on its success. Under the program, she had to cover the costs for the solar panels and their installation herself, after which the government would pay her back a portion of the cost. The Obama administration was quick to send her a check, but the state of Florida, which was responsible for part of the tab, took two years. <br />
<br />
Still, since they made the switch, the Henriquez Electrical Corporation has saved between $100 and $150 a month on its electrical bill. &quot;I would say, for us, probably as our business, just to save money on our electric bill, yes the stimulus helped,&quot; she said. &quot;But it didn't work from a marketing perspective.&quot;<br />
<br />
The president, likely, would agree. <br />

			A man makes a $250 million fortune loading up companies with debt and then extracting million-dollar fees from those same companies, in exchange for the generous service of telling them who needs to be fired in order to finance the debt payments he saddled them with in the first place. That same man then runs for president riding an image of children roasting on flames of debt, choosing as his running mate perhaps the only politician in America more pompous and self-righteous on the subject of the evils of borrowed money than the candidate himself. If Romney pulls off this whopper, you'll have to tip your hat to him: No one in history has ever successfully run for president riding this big of a lie. It's almost enough to make you think he really is qualified for the White House.

			The federal records, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, reveal that Romney's initial rescue attempt at Bain &amp; Company was actually a disaster – leaving the firm so financially strapped that it had &quot;no value as a going concern.&quot; Even worse, the federal bailout ultimately engineered by Romney screwed the FDIC – the bank insurance system backed by taxpayers – out of at least $10 million. And in an added insult, Romney rewarded top executives at Bain with hefty bonuses at the very moment that he was demanding his handout from the feds.

<br />
If this is false, an accusation of this scale should make Mitt Romney the richest man in America through a libel lawsuit.<br />
<br />
If it's true, you have to wonder what kind of society it is we live in that allows a man like this to even become a candidate for the highest elected office.</div>

TLDR:<br />
<br />
Deaf boy uses sign language. The registered sign for his name is a gesture that some fucktard at the school says resembles a gun. So they want him to change his name so he doesnt violate the weapons policy. He doesnt have a weapon, he doesnt have a gun. He is not trying to gesture a gun. <br />
<br />
THE KID IS 3 YEARS OLD SIMPLY USING AN ACCEPTED, REGISTERED S.E.E GESTURE FOR HIS NAME. <br />
<br />
Does this mean anyone using a pointer finger will violate the fucking weapons policy? How utterly foolish have we become in this country? Unfuckingbelievable.<br />
