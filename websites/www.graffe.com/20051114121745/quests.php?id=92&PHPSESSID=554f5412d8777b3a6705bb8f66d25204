<HR>
Xasri Virek says 'Welcome my student. I see you have brought with you the Beginner's Manual. If you are ready for your next lesson, the task is simple. A vicious terror has awoken somewhere in the Plane of Innovation. You must seek out the Junk Beast and bring me its power source along with your Beginner Combat Manual. Doing this will prove your battle courage above all else. Remember, the gem cannot be polished without friction, nor man or lizard perfected without trials. I wish you luck.'
<HR>
The junk beast can be found in Plane of Innovation, hits for max of 975, doesn't quad and can be slowed. His area effect blind is sort of a pain though.
<HR>
Give your <a href="http://www.graffe.com/quests.php?id=87">Beginner Combat Manual</a> and the junk beast head to Xasri Virek to recieve your Intermediate Combat Manual.
