    </b></p>
  <p>This quest is given by a Dark Elf named Dyth X`Teria in the Kunark lands 
    of 'The Overthere'. He can be found in the docktown at +3137.13, +2266.10, 
    -49.97. He is inside a small stone building. The end result is the level 39 
    spell, Concussion.</p>
  <hr noshade>
  <p align="left">You say, 'hail Dyth X`Teria' </p>
  <p>Dyth X`Teria appears to be the local master of wizadry. His garb clearly 
    comes from the dark city of Neriak it has an emblem of a black sun. Speak!! 
    I am dispatched from Neriak to this land by order of the king. I shall research 
    [new spells] and aid the adventuring wizards. My knowledge of wizardry is 
    offered to all in hopes of gaining information of Kunark. </p>
  <p>You say, 'What new spells?'</p>
  <p>Dyth X`Teria says 'Within this lost land could lay the knowledge of extinct 
    civilizations. I am ordered to seek this knowledge for the empire of Neriak. 
    So far all I have discovered is a way to harness a spell of my own design. 
    I call it, [Brain Bite]. </p>
  <p> You say, 'what is brain bite?' </p>
  <p>Dyth X`Teria says 'If you wish to own a copy of MY spell, Brain Bite. I would 
    be glad to give you one. All I ask is that you [gather a few souls] for me. 
  </p>
  <p>You say, 'I will gather a few souls' </p>
  <p>Dyth X`Teria reveals three ornate bottles. While I finished my research of 
    Brain Bite, I encountered three [interlopers] who wished to steal my spell. 
    I had the Dragoon garrison track them down and dispatch them. Unfortunately, 
    I forgot to instruct them to trap their souls with these bottles. Do you want 
    to [take the bottles] and finish the job. </p>
  <p>You say, 'who interlopers' </p>
  <p>Dyth X`Teria says 'The garrison report was sloppy to say the least. They 
    informed me that Hampton was slain near ruins within a jungle infested with 
    raptors. Mardon was slain within an ancient city found deep in a jungle. Ryla 
    was slain in a hidden fortress guarded by fierce armored wolves who walked 
    on their hind legs. </p>
  <p>You say, 'I will take the bottles.' </p>
  <p>Dyth X`Teria says 'The bottles also require a gem. You will fetch me the 
    three gems and I will prepare the bottles and give them to you to finish the 
    job. I need an onyx, a peridot and a star rose quartz. </p>

  <p>So far, this is all of the info that I have found out myself or has been 
    submitted:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The beings that need to be found are called &quot;a human skeleton&quot;.</li>
    <li>To get the souls, do not kill the skeletons but try to hand them the correct 
      bottle (use Identify to find out which bottle is which).</li>
    <li>Some race/diety combinations are KoS (kill on sight) to the skeletons. 
      If you are KoS to the skeletons, you will need someone to charm them while 
      you hand them the correct bottle (charming can be done by an enchanter or 
      a level 49+ necromancer with Cajole Undead). Once you hand the skeleton 
      the bottle, the skeleton will vanish and in your inventory will be a new 
      bottle called &quot;Bottle of Swirling Smoke&quot;. 
      <ul>
        <li><b>Hampton</b>: Found in the ruined city within Trakanon's Teeth. 
          Location is +270, -3800 (zone into TT from EJ and simply follow the 
          left zone wall the whole way). You do not need an enchanter on this 
          leg of the quest. If the 'a human skeleton' is not at the spawn point 
          given, wait for it to spawn. Someone may have killed it.</li>
        <li><b>Mardon</b>: Found in The City of Mist. Mardon is a level 40-45 
          wizard and is aggro to everyone. The location of Mardon is +136.00, 
          -641.00, +76.97. This is upon the second floor of Mist and requires 
          a key (or a high level rogue with lockpick) to enter the locked chamber 
          on the first floor if you take the long way. Take a look at <a href="city_of_mist.jpg" target="_blank">this 
          map</a> created for the easiest and safest path to the 'a human skeleton' 
          without the need for a rogue. Another way is to set up camp near the 
          waterfall/river and then have someone who can sense undead try to target 
          the human skeleton when it spawns up in the corner tower room. Once 
          they successfully target the human skeleton, have them swim down into 
          the water underneath and then taunt it. Taunting from this distance 
          will work since there is no z-axis (vertical) check.</li>
        <li><b>Ryla</b>: Found in <a href="karnors_castle3.jpg" target="_blank">Karnor's 
          Castle</a>. <b>** WARNING **</b> Be careful what you kill here! Killing 
          mobs that effect Venril Sathir will ruin your chances of finishing the 
          quest! Most large Drolvargs (guards) are apprehensive and will not attack 
          unless provoked. The smaller, Drolvarg Sentry's have the consider message 
          of 'scowl' and can be killed without fear of ruining your faction. Enter 
          the castle and go over the second bridge. Turn left and enter the courtyard. 
          Go up the curved staircase. You'll come across a Spectral Caller, a 
          Sentry and a pet. Go straight to the rail and turn right. Continue (East) 
          to first door on your right, then go downstairs and across the room 
          to the door. Go straight (East) to the end, turn right and go short 
          way to the opening on your right. Turn right and go to second cell on 
          the right. Voila! For an interesting way to get this bottle with a very 
          low level rogue, click <a href="rogue_ryla.htm">here</a>.</li>
      </ul>

    </li>
  </ul>
  <p align="left">Once you have all three bottled souls, return to Dyth X`Teria 
    in The Overthere outpost. Handing these three bottles to Dyth will result 
    in this:</p>
  <p align="left">Dyth X`Teria says 'Only three souls shall get you my knowledge, 
    wizard. <br>
    Dyth X`Teria empties the bottles smoke into a very large glass urn filled 
    with similar swirling smoke. You think you hear the cries of a thousand tortured 
    souls. He then closes the urn and hands you a scroll. Here is your reward. 
    It will blast a foes brain and hopefully they may forget their hatred. </p>
  <p align="left">Your faction standing with VenrilSathir got better</p>
