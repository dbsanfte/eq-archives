			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Okay, so Guild Wars 2 just came out, but maybe it isn't everyone's cup of tea. Rest assured, September has new games to look forward to as well.<br />
<br />
Prince among them, Borderlands 2! Yeah sure, the first game had problems, but the sequel promises to fix them! I won't be playing it yet, but I went ahead and pre-ordered it anyway. <br />
<br />
Supposedly, Torchlight 2 will finally make an appearance as well. Sort of bad timing, sandwiched in between Borderlands 2 and Guild Wars 2, but for $20, it will be hard to not be worth it. The Baldur's Gate remake/port is also supposed to come out this month, isn't it?<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and that WoW expansion too. :D<br />
<br />
Below you can find the rest of this month's releases. As always, if you know something I don't, feel free to share! I readily admit I been preoccupied by GW2 to the point where I am not as current on other gaming news.<br />

			Fallout 4 set in Boston?<br />
<br />
August 20, 2012 1:04PM PDT<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
By Eddie Makuch, News Editor <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Reddit tipster claims Bethesda has been &quot;scoping out and researching&quot; Massachusetts capital for upcoming unannounced game; Fallout 3, New Vegas in-game messages lend credence to assertion. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If a new rumor proves accurate, Bethesda's next Fallout game will be set in Boston. A Reddit user going by &quot;fallout4boston&quot; claims the unannounced Fallout 4 will be set in the Massachusetts capital city.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Might Fallout 4 do battle in Faneuil Hall?<br />
 <br />
<br />
This tipster says Bethesda has been &quot;scoping out and researching&quot; the city, and suggests the developer has a &quot;strong connection&quot; to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a prestigious research university near Boston. The Reddit user &quot;may or may not be an MIT employee,&quot; according to the post.<br />
 <br />
A Bethesda representative told GameSpot, &quot;We don't comment on rumors and speculation.&quot;<br />
 <br />
According to the Fallout Wikia page, &quot;The Commonwealth&quot; was referenced in 2008's Fallout 3. Four real-world states in the US categorize themselves as Commonwealths: Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Virginia, and Massachusetts. Bethesda lead designer Emil Pagliarulo told 1UP in 2009 that the Commonwealth reference in Fallout 3 was in fact speaking about Massachusetts, not any of the other three states.<br />
 <br />
<b>Additionally, Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas included mentions of a mysterious &quot;Institute,&quot; which is located in The Commonwealth</b>. This could potentially be related to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology referenced by the Reddit user.<br />
 <br />
The most recent Fallout title was 2010's Fallout: New Vegas, which was developed by Obsidian Entertainment and set in a postapocalyptic Las Vegas. Its predecessor, Fallout 3, was developed by Bethesda Game Studios and took place in Washington DC and the surrounding area.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Thought this might interest some of you. A small gaming studio wants to make a Total Annihilation styled RTS game. I will link the concept video below. The game is titled Planetary Annihilation, and the only other game the studio has made that I am aware of is Monday Night Combat, a fairly well received third person dota styled shooter.<br />
<br />
I think it looks pretty interesting, but there are a few problems.<br />
<br />
1) I think the concept they are promising is going to be harder/more expensive to pull off than they might expect. I get the feeling it will be simplified in the final product, which might make pc elitists angry.<br />
<br />
2) They are asking a lot for a Kickstarter. There have only been a few breakout successes using Kickstarter as a source of funding that I am aware of so far. That Shadowrun project I linked awhile back, for example, has been unable to achieve the requested funding, last I checked.<br />
<br />
Edit: I guess I'm just pessimistic, they already have 700k of the 900k they requested. <br />
<br />
For those that don't want to watch the video, here is a short summary of what you see in it:<br />
<br />
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px"><b>Spoiler</b> for <i>summary</i>: <input type="button" value="Show" style="width:45px;font-size:10px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onClick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != 'inline') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'inline'; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none';  this.value = 'Show'; }">
</div>
<div class="alt2" style="margin: 0px; padding: 6px; border: 1px inset;">
<div style="display: none;">
<br />
The graphic style presented is very simple and cartoony, they almost look like legos. I thought they were reasonable considering the budget, but some people will be put off.<br />
<br />
So the game starts off exactly how you would expect TA or SC to. A robot is called down, starts building a base, then robot armies start fighting each other. You notice in the process, however, that the battlefield map is spherical, like Spore.<br />
<br />
The action cuts back to the base, the player opens a GUI that lets them designate the nearby moon, and they launch a robot to build a base on it. The lunar base then sends new units to the battlefield on the planet with what looks like artillery.<br />
<br />
The robots on the moon base are then told to access the nearby asteroid belt. They build engines on an asteroid, and send it plummeting towards the enemy base. Defense missiles are fired, but the asteroid still wrecks most of the planet. Hence the game's name: Planetary Annihilation.<br />
 
</div>
</div>
</div><br />
<br />
So what do you guys think? Is this something that would excite you?<br />
<br />

			After all the speculation, we’re absolutely thrilled to be able to  announce a new game in the Broken Sword series: “Broken Sword – the  Serpent’s Curse”. Due for release in Q1 2013, we can confirm PC, Mac,  Apple iPhone/iPad, Android &amp; Linux formats (we hope to add console  versions to the list). We have been writing the game for six months and  are now launching a Kickstarter campaign to allow us to complete the  game and maintain complete creative control. <br />
 <br />
 To see George and Nico in glorious 2D/HD, and discover more about the game, please visit the Kickstater project page:<br />

 <br />
 We really hope that you like our approach – and look forward to hearing  your reactions. And please consider making a pledge on Kickstarter, and  join our adventure.

</div>While I actually enjoyed the ill-received third and fourth games, it's nice to see the series return to its original style. I'm not really a fan of kickstarter in general, but I really hope this one gets funded.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Been playing this while waiting for Guild Wars, and I thought some of you might be amused by one of the optional side quests. It's basically just a series of hidden collectibles, and when you find them all you get a prize. But the collectibles are garden gnomes with skulls for faces, and the reward is a pair of skulled garden gnome scythes. They have low damage and no stats, but a bonus effect that procs random effects on enemies during battle. Whenever they proc, they cackle like a tiny maniac.<br />
<br />
Can't find any good pictures or videos really, so these will have to do. The first shows what the gnome looks like, and the second shows the weapon (but sadly not the cackle).<br />

			Sony shuts Wipeout video game studio in LiverpoolComments (30) By Leo Kelion<br />
 <br />
Technology reporter<br />
 <br />
 The studio's last title was Wipeout 2048, released in January of this year Continue reading the main story <br />
Related Stories<br />

Sony acts to boost PS Vita sales <br />
Crysis 3 maker opens China studio <br />
<br />
Sony has closed one of the UK's oldest video game studios following a review of its operations. <br />
<br />
Sony Liverpool employed about 100 workers. It dated back to 1984 when it was known as Psygnosis. The Japanese company bought it in 1993.<br />
<br />
The developer's early titles included Lemmings for the Atari ST, and Shadow of the Beast for the Commodore Amiga.<br />
<br />
It was perhaps best known for later PlayStation releases including the Wipeout racing game series.<br />
<br />
A statement released by the company to the games site Kotaku said: &quot;We do regular reviews to ensure that the resources we have can create and produce high quality, innovative and commercially viable projects in an increasingly competitive market place. <br />
<br />
&quot;It has been decided that Liverpool Studio should be closed. Liverpool Studio has been an important part of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios since the outset of PlayStation, and has contributed greatly to PlayStation over the years. Everyone connected with Liverpool Studio, past and present, can be very proud of their achievements.<br />
<br />
 This studio posted this Wipeout-inspired graphic onto its Facebook page <br />
&quot;However, it was felt that by focusing our investment plans on other studios that are currently working on exciting new projects, we would be in a stronger position to offer the best possible content for our consumers.&quot;<br />
<br />
The firm said other divisions at its Liverpool campus would not be affected. But it did not mention whether the staff at the shuttered studio would be offered posts elsewhere.<br />
<br />
The unit's last title was Wipeout 2048 for the PlayStation Vita handheld console. A message on the game's Facebook page from the team said: &quot;Thank you for everything, Pilots. It's been an amazing journey and we'll miss you.&quot;<br />
<br />
'Times are changing'<br />
 <br />
The founder of the independent games studio Rebellion, which also employs staff in Liverpool, said the decision reflected a wider shift within the games industry.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a tragedy when an old institution like this disappears, but the times are changing and games are moving from a retail-dominated landscape to a digital download-dominated one,&quot; said Jason Kingsley.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arguably the power that the big publishers had, employing lots of talent, was relevant to the old model - now the advantage of being big isn't so important and smaller teams can be just as effective.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can liken it to a jungle environment - when a big tree falls over it creates lots of opportunities for others to grow in its space. There is still a lot of life and excitement in the UK gaming industry, and hopefully opportunities for some of Sony Liverpool's staff too.&quot;<br />
<br />
 The Liverpool studio made games for Atari and Commodore computers before being bought by Sony <br />
Evan Narcisse, a writer at Kotaku, added that the Wipeout series had seen a decline in popularity, but said the studio left behind a strong legacy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Psygnosis was one of the first games studios to deliver titles that felt like they were delivering a unified, artistic vision.<br />
<br />
&quot;Early titles like Shadow of the Beast expanded the polish, scope and ambition of the video game medium and didn't feel quite as disposable as other contemporary titles. <br />
<br />
&quot;It was also notable for making the transition from home computers to consoles, riding out a shift that many companies didn't survive. I remember playing Wipeout on the first PlayStation years ago... the art direction, music and feel was like nothing I had ever experienced.&quot;<br />
<br />
Popcap cuts<br />
 <br />
The announcement of the stuido's closure came amidst news of turmoil elsewhere in the industry.<br />
<br />
Popcap, the company behind Plants vs Zombies, has cut 50 posts at its Seattle headquarters following its takeover by Electronic Arts. It has also signalled it might close its Dublin studio with the loss of about 100 positions.<br />
<br />
 Early titles by Psygnosis included Barbarian, Ballistix, Colony Wars and Obliterator <br />
Norwegian developer Funcom has also announced what it described as &quot;temporary layoffs&quot; blaming &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot; for its recent release The Secret World.<br />
<br />
However, Call of Duty publisher Activision has recently opened a studio in Leeds called The Blast Furnace which is dedicated to making games for mobile devices.<br />
<br />
Transformers Universe creator Jagex has also opened a new studio near Cambridge, while in the US Gears of War developer Epic Games is creating Impossible Studios in Hunt Valley near Baltimore, Maryland.

most melee fights soon become unwinnable even with all 3 buffs running<br />
<br />
have the &quot;80s retro outfit&quot; on, does it apply a negative combat buff or some damn thing, jeesh<br />
may try again with different outfit<br />
<br />
IMHO they have made a total fuck up of porting it to PC, regarding the controls<br />
<br />
Shame as it has lots going for it :/</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Figured I'd post my first impressions of this re-release (it's not a remake!).<br />
<br />
Pro:<br />
<br />
- 3D graphics are <i>optionally</i> rendered at high resolutions, making especially battle scenes and the overworld look significantly better than before.*<br />
- Texture filtering (for 3D graphics) can be toggled.<br />
- Saves are synced with &quot;the cloud&quot;.<br />
- Four language options (English, French, German, Spanish).<br />
- Runs perfectly on new versions of Windows (the original release is a pain in the ass to get working).<br />
- Achivements (for those who care about them).<br />
<br />
<br />
Con:<br />
<br />
- Requires online activation.<br />
- Requires account login (SE or Facebook).<br />
- 2D graphics still low-res. No filtering option for backgrounds.<br />
- Videos badly upscaled (to 1280x896). They still look like crap because Square hasn't bothered to re-render them, but seem to exhibit less compression artifacts than the original PC version.<br />
<br />
<br />
What bothers me the most is Square's ridiculous habit of requiring an internet connection for re-releases of their old games (the Android versions of Final Fantasy I and III suffer from the same). At least the game can supposedly be installed on multiple systems (according to the confirmation email I received, haven't tested it yet).<br />
<br />
<i>* You can achieve a similar look with the PS1 version on an emulator, but the PC version lacks the PS1's &quot;wobble&quot; caused by the lack of a depth buffer.</i></div>

			<description>I am so excited for this.  
 
I honestly thought they were going to produce Project XBLAZE first, but then this comes out of nowhere and is in local testing in japan.

Being the third - This is probably the final game in the Blazblue series...</description>

Being the third - This is probably the final game in the Blazblue series (excluding potential side games like &quot;XBLAZE&quot;) and I have to say I'm looking forward to seeing lots of stories conclude. I look forward to new merchandise and BlueRadio episodes. I love this setting and franchise and I hope they put all their love into it to end it well instead of...well...Mass Effect 3.</div>
