	<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" >The statue is unmoving, in the way that all statues are unmoving, made of granite or marble to decorate a lawn or garden. But something about the detail level of this statue is supernatural...the moustache so lifelike it seems too finely carved to be stone, the eyes so rendered that you would expect it to blink. Yet stone it is, cold heartless stone, a shadow thrown across the floor as Luclin waxes fat and pregnant behind it, bathing it in pale blue moonlight, revealing stone grey hair unstead of the deep black of the statue's model. Silence except the sound of wind whistling by is the only noice.<br />
<br />
Until that silence is disturbed.<br />
<br />
With a deafening sound, the statue shatters, pieces of the enchanted stone that is its medium exploding outward with one tremendous CRACK. And in its place, a humanoid shaped light wavers, and then shrinks to the size of a pinpoint. In its place, eclipsing it in its own darkness, is another manlike shape, the black power of it palpable, filling in the space where the stone likeness once occupied. Slowly the darkness coalesces, taking on the likeness of the statue, but now rich in the hues of the living and real, and the mouth opens and inhales, taking a deep breath. Eyes open, but they are not the deep black pools of the original owner. Rather, they are lit with the fire of the mad, malevolent, violent. The new being seems to hold onto the form of the original shape, then spastically shifts forms dozens of times, becoming dwarf, hafling, giant, kerran, a myriad of different shapes and looks. Then it settles back on the long haired, moustacioed, human form of the statue, and opens its mouth to speak.<br />
<br />
"Free..." it growls.<br />
<br />
And with a move of its newly formed hand, catches the wisp of a light that had been seen upon the destruction of the stone, to capture it like an insect in its powerful grasp.<br />
<br />
And from the wisp, one word, weak, anguished, with the voice of the statue's model.<br />
<br />
"Avenge...."<br />
<br />
And behind the living statue, Luclin's light slowly turns from blue to hazy red, as the face of the moon fills with blood.<br />
<br />
<br />
* * *<br />
<br />
Camille bolted straight up in bed choking back a cry. The bed far too large for one woman to sleep in alone, but one she had never had the heart to replace, even as she neared the one year marking of her husband's death. His sword Reaver hanging on the wall glinted Luclin's moonlight in the dark, grounding her in reality, while the remenants of the nightmare, the first she had suffered since his passing, danced at the edge of her memory. A tear rolled down her cheek as she looked upon that blade, and then to the empty spot in their bed. And slowly she fought for control of her beating heart, which had almost stopped when the thing in the dream had spoke.<br />
<br />
Just a dream, she told herself, tossing to the side.<br />
<br />
But dream or not, though it did not return, Camille Wyldechylde found no more sleep that night. <br />
<br />
<br />
   ***   ***   ***<br />
<br />
<br />
"Brimstonnnnne..." Camille singsonged cautiously from the other side of the stable door. An angry snort answered her in reply.<br />
<br />
Sigh, here we go again.<br />
<br />
Camille had made sure to dress in full armor this time. The last time had her laying hands on herself in a panic as she found her arm nearly bitten in two. Only a fast regeneration from Grelin had saved the arm. She knew it was dangerous to attempt this without the half-elven druid there, but the night had left her feeling rattled and odd. And the danger of doing this alone was something she needed to draw her mind away from the crazy imagery and haunting cry of River's ... "Avenge..."<br />
<br />
"Ok.", she said, brandishing the apple as if it were a weapon. She unlatched the lock from the outside of the stable and slowly pushed open the swinging stable door. "I'm not going to hurt..."<br />
<br />
BAM.<br />
<br />
The door was hit from inside with a massive force, slamming the doors outward, connecting solidly with Camille's head, which she foolishly led with to peek inside. The wood cracked hard against her skull, tossing her backwards onto her rear as consciousness threatened to leave her.<br />
<br />
Inside the stable, a whinny of mockery.<br />
<br />
"Dammit!" she growled, staggering to her feet. "I'm not trying to hurt you!" A blonde lock had fallen across a gash now openly bleeding on her forehead, making her golden hair copper red. The apple lay on the grass forgotten. She squared her shoulders and prepared to do her daily battle.<br />
<br />
A finger appeared in front of her face, glowing green with light. It reached up to her forehead, touching the wound. A light touch, but it stopped her dead. The wound began to mend.<br />
<br />
"No." Grelin said simply, as his magic began to mend the cut.<br />
<br />
"That horse!" Camille exclaimed angrily. "It treats me like I'm an enemy!" She took another step toward the stables, but Grelin laid a hand on her shoulder, not forcefully, but it had the effect all the same. All the wired tension in her disappeared, and her shoulders slumped in defeat.<br />
<br />
"Ah, what the hells did you cast?" she said, sitting down dejectedly onto a bale of hay. Grelin scooped up the apple from the ground and took a bite.<br />
<br />
"Harmony." he smiled boyishly through his chewing. His short blonde page cut made him look even younger than the smile. Camille could not find herself angry with him, one of her oldest and certainly most quiet friend. Getting Grelin to use more than two words in a sentence would be as difficult as getting Brimstone to not kick her to death.<br />
<br />
"That damned horse! I used to ride him, when River was alive!" <br />
<br />
"Aye." Grelin said, then fell silent. That Aye said it all. River had been dead almost a year, and from the day of his death, Brimstone had known, and become the unmanageable wild stallion that now snorted in disdain in the stable. <br />
<br />
"Every single day, you'd think it would remember me, or let me groom it." Camille commented. "But it knows its master's gone. Am I a fool, Grelin, to try to befriend it?"<br />
<br />
"Him." Grelin corrected.<br />
<br />
"Yes, HIM." Camille spit. "It's obviously male, pig headed, stubborn, obstinate..."<br />
<br />
Another snort from inside.<br />
<br />
"Ah, we AGREE on something!" Camille exclaimed in exasperation. Then she turned back to Grelin. "If it were a normal horse, this wouldn't be a problem. But a stallion of the Goddess of Nightmares...River was fascinated with her, and this horse. What went on between them, while I slept, during EndGame?"<br />
<br />
Grelin shrugged with no answer. He had not been there.<br />
<br />
"I miss him Grelin." Camille said forlornly, tears welling up. Grelin averted her gaze. She understood why. No one wanted to see her tears, once they had gotten past their own. Paladins don't weep. Knights don't cry.<br />
<br />
Grelin's gaze found a figure approaching far in the distance. A rack of rabbits tied to a pole was slung over the visitor's shoulder, crisscrossing the long bow fixed there. The man was peering intently at the ground, following trail of broken grass from where Grelin had come upon Camille. So intent he was on the floor, that he walked straight into a low lying treebranch, almost knocking himself to the ground. Only then did he look up, rubbing his head, and seeing Camille and Grelin in the distance.<br />
<br />
"Hi hi hi hi!" the man called, waving a hand in excited greeting.<br />
<br />
"Food." Grelin said, motioning to the man and his pole full of skinned rabbits.<br />
<br />
Camille recognized the ranger at once.<br />
<br />
"Talvarien." she smiled. <br />
<br />
<br />
   ***   ***   ***<br />
<br />
<br />
"I thought you might need some more meat since it was so long ago since my last time through here and me being in the neighborhood and all so I shot a few rabbits powpowpowpow even though I know you like bunnies so you might be mad but I figured you'd forgive me so I..." Talvarien began, as usual oblivious of commas or pauses. Camille waited for the inhale and jumped in.<br />
<br />
"Thanks Talv, I was running low on meat. Stay for lunch?" she cut in smoothly.<br />
<br />
Talv blinked, having lost his entire train of thought. It was a common occurance. The friendly and exuberant ranger spoke as fast as he handled his bow, at a breathtaking pace with little regard for direction or awareness of where he was.<br />
<br />
"Sure." he said after a pause.<br />
<br />
"I'm done here for now." she said, shooting a dark look at the stable doors. Grelin was already locking in the black stallion. "Let's head up to the guildhou...to the house."<br />
<br />
A short quiet march later they found themselves in the large dining room.<br />
<br />
The guildhouse of Razor's Edge. Once full and bustling with activity, the halls echoed with their footsteps. Camille had kept it neat and polished, more out of habit than for any need, since it was 12 times the size of anything she would need for material comfort. The sound of their passage reverberating off the walls reminded them of the size, and more sad, the emptiness.<br />
<br />
"I'll boil some water for those rabbits." Camille said, filling a pot. Grelin was already using his druid fire to light the stove, and before long, the three sat waiting for the meat to cook into a stew, each lost in their own thoughts as they sat at the large officers table, in their old seats, reliving the ghosts of the past.<br />
<br />
Here there used to be such familiar faces, now gone, some stopping by the visit Camille from time to time, others disappearing down whatever paths time deems when friends part. There sat Kaguera, the warrior woman general of Razor. Here at one time you could see Malkar the wizard sparking O'keil's embers to his meat when it came to his plate undercooked. There at the far end, Barnabe and Annir sat on high cushions, barely clearing the table, suffering jokes partly about short folks and mostly about halflings. There in the corner, Rocsalt's punching bag. Here was the chair made specially for Zullie, allowing the tail of the Iksar woman to pass through the back. All the chairs of the officers, the people Camille had dined with every night for years, had joked with, sang with, planned with, and finally, one morning, cried with.<br />
<br />
There near the end was Nizzre's place, to the right of the head. To the left was Camille's, and the chair to her left, Bwael's, with its cushioned stool with no back, made especially for Bwael. The head ranger of Razor refused to put his bow aside even during dinners, and spent more time with his eyes on the door than anywhere else.<br />
<br />
And of course, at the head, River's place.<br />
<br />
The father of Razor's Edge, or at least, its frontman. River's connections had formed the guild, had somehow, through his interrelations with all those different people, brought them together under one roof. And formed a family. Arrogant, egotistical, blunt, confident Riverdane Wyldechylde. Why, River? she thought with a trace of anger. Why with all of these people around you, do you die alone? How does one find themselves alone among all these people? How? How could you leave me alone...<br />
<br />
"Soup's done." Grelin said.<br />
<br />
Camille began spooning it out, while Talvarien entertained them with the tales of his last few months travelling. Camille half listened, still haunted by the chairs of those gone. Kaguera had gone to Appotus Dominus, a military guild, unsurprisingly. Zullie had ended up with Order of Antondwer, and most of the others split between Walkers and Lucid Chimera. Some had said goodbye, some just disappeared. Most disturbingly were Nizzre and Bwael. The two brothers, the ones who had founded Razor with River, Grelin and her, had joined Lucid Chimera for a short while, Nizzre married, and then poof gone. No one knew, those few who still visited, where they had gone to. She hoped they were all right. They were grown men, but they had been like brothers to her, and having them missing affected her on more than one level.<br />
<br />
"...but, ever since I restrung this one with fresh owlbear gut it handles like a dream..." Talvarien finished at last, patting his bow.<br />
<br />
"Dream..." Camille murmured. Grelin's brow furled, and Talvarien put down his spoon and looked at her oddly.<br />
<br />
"Cami, is something wrong?" Talvarien said, "Cause you just went white as a ghost when I mentioned...."<br />
<br />
"What dream?" Grelin asked.<br />
<br />
Camille paused, embarassed, not realizing she had spoken out loud. Then after a moment, took a deep breath. After all, they were still family, tags or not.<br />
<br />
She began to tell them her dream.<br />
<br />
<br />
   ***   ***   ***<br />
<br />
<br />
"I don't get it." Talvarien said.<br />
<br />
Camille sighed. "Neither do I, Talv. We cremated River. You and Grelin were there as we returned his ashes to the riverbed where he was born in Kithicor. Some of the Alliance folks had asked to erect a statue, but I didn't allow it, River wouldn't have wanted it. And that voice. 'Free...' What WAS that?"<br />
<br />
"Bad milk." Grelin suggested.<br />
<br />
"Ha!" Camille laughed. "Yeah, I suppose it may have been." But no upset stomach could have caused her mind to paint the pictures it did. Inside her, she knew that. Her face grew pale again.<br />
<br />
"Bad milk or not," she said, "I'm afraid to go to sleep again."<br />
<br />
Talvarien exchanged a look with Grelin. "Listen Cami, I'm in town for...however long. Why don't you set up our old rooms and we can stay through breakfast? I cook a mean egg. You never tasted eggs like Talv Upside Down Over Easy Scrambled Eggs. I juggle them first to pre-scramble them in the shell, then crack em like...." Grelin simply nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
"Thanks, Talv." she said, covering his hand with hers. "I've never been afraid of the dark. But...I don't know."<br />
<br />
"All good all good." Talvarien said, carrying the bowls over to the wash basin. "I'll clean up this, and you can get back to whatever you were doing before lunch."<br />
<br />
"Thanks." Camille said, putting on a mailed gauntlet, "I just need to go to the armory and get my helmet." And with that she pushed through the door and was gone.<br />
<br />
"Helmet? Where is she headed, the arena?" Talv asked in surprise.<br />
<br />
"Horse." Grelin said simply, disappearing through the door after her.<br />
<br />
"Ah, Brimstone." Talvarien said, shaking his head. He began rinsing the bowls.</font></p>

<br />
Camille is in total blackness. She senses she is outside from the breeze upon her skin, but she hears none of the noises that usually accompany the outdoors....no cricket song, no bass from the frogs, nothing. Slowly her eyes adjust to the gloom.<br />
<br />
She finds herself inside a huge arena, with one opening to the outside. In the center floats a woman in a long black and purple dress, suspended in the air about four feet above the ground. The woman is as tall as a giant, standing a good 25 feet or more from the top of her head to the bottom of her dress. She watches the entrance as Camille takes in her size, and then looks around the rest of the room.<br />
<br />
Statues.<br />
<br />
On four pedestals crouch four large stone gargoyles, sentinels in the room. They do not move, being made of stone, but Camille senses some sort of life in them, or perhaps the detail work is just so precise she tricks herself into believing she can see them breathe. Each is slightly different than the other, and she slowly turns to take in each of them.<br />
<br />
And her breath stops.<br />
<br />
On a fifth pedestal behind her, stands River.<br />
<br />
She begins to run to him, then stops, confused. His skin is too pale, his limbs raised and unmoving, his hair almost white....no, not white, she realizes, heart beginning to beat again. Gray. The gray of stone. River is yet another statue here, nothing more. And the woman in the center of the room is Terris Thule, she who had once shed a tear for Camille, while Camille lay locked in unnatural slumber. Shed a tear to help save the world, a world that feared her. Terris Thule, the Goddess of Nightmares.<br />
<br />
Slowly Camille approaches River's statue. Why, she thinks. Why would Terris erect a statue of River here? She knows she is dreaming, and wonders if this is her mind placing the statue from her previous dream here in Terris' lair, after her questions to Grelin about River and the goddess' relationship. Or maybe bad rabbit on top of bad milk. But this doesn't feel like a bad dream. This feels like something...more.<br />
<br />
Her hand reaches up to the statue,trembling, to touch River's lips. They seem so lifelike. But her fingers touch cold stone, almost jarring her from her sleep. She had so expected those lips to move when she touched them. The cool reality of stone makes whatever hope she has in her diminish to quiet mourning.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a noise from outside the collesium, loud enough in the eerie silence to startle her. She spins from the statue clumbily, unprepared for battle, if battle were needed. Her feet twist as she turns, and she falls backwards.<br />
<br />
Two stone arms wrap around her from behind, breaking her fall and embracing her tight. She almost screams, she is so surprised. She had not heard a sound from the statue. She feels the lips press against her ear, and the statue speaks, in River's even voice, a voice she had not heard except for dreams for almost a year. In her older dreams, his voice was changing, as time slowly ate away at a clear memory of it. But this voice is the real River, with every nuance, pitch and tone identical to the living man. The only thing that is wrong is when he speaks in her ear, she does not feel the hot rush of breath on her neck. She does not struggle, just allows the embrace of stone. She had longed for that embrace so often in the past that it means little that it is hard and cold.<br />
<br />
"Shhh." River whispers in her ear. "Watch."<br />
<br />
And placing her hands over the cold stone ones crossing her breasts, she turns her eyes to the entrance as light explodes into the room. <br />
<br />
<br />
   ***   ***   ***<br />
<br />
<br />
Arms reach through the entrance, brandishing large torches on spiked poles. With a thrust, the torches are planted on either side of the entrance. Two other figures step forward with large bowed sheets of glass, set up on tripods. The legs are flipped out to support the glass in front of the torches, magnifying the light, chasing away all shadows in the large arena. The night becomes bright as day.<br />
<br />
"BUFF NOW.", booms a voice from outside, carrying as if amplified through the collesium. "SAVE MASS GROUP BUFF FOR LATER, WE'LL NEED IT. I WANT THIS DONE IN TWO MINUTES."<br />
<br />
Then the hum and crackle of magical energies being spent, as the gloom behind the torches becomes blinding white light. Between the noises of the casting, other voices:<br />
<br />
"....Why in Tunare's name can't we mass group buff? This is gunna wipe my mana..." <br />
<br />
"....Just shut up, don't piss him off. He's been studying this fight for a week..."<br />
<br />
"...VOQ to nuke team, wizzies, be in range..."<br />
<br />
"...Focus inc, clerics, run now or don't bitch..."<br />
<br />
"...we have a druid here for Nine or am I doing Virtue?...."<br />
<br />
"....I did Nine in Tranquility, check your buffs, slacker. Use Symbol K...."<br />
<br />
Then the first voice:<br />
<br />
"BLOW YOUR RODS NOW IF YOU NEED MANA, AND NECRO, STOP PLAYING WITH YOUR BONE. POP A TWITCH ON AAMEDOR SO WE CAN GET THIS SHOW STARTED. YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE."<br />
<br />
And all through this, Camille watches Terris' hair lift as if charged with electrical energy, swaying in a breeze she couldn't feel, gathering energy for...something.<br />
<br />
"FORTY SECONDS. YOU KNOW THE PLAN. PRON, FRONT AND CENTER. QUARKEN, IF HE DROPS, YOU'RE THE MAN. CLERICS KNOW YOUR ROTATION, AAMEDOR WILL START AND LEAD IT. THIRTY SECONDS. TREMAS, BE READY FOR ANY SURPRISES WHEN THE BITCH STARTS TO BLEED. TWENTY SECONDS. WHERE THE HELLS IS THE STANDARD? WHAT ARE WE, A FAMILY GUILD? KATARIN, GET THAT DAMNED FLAG PLANTED!"<br />
<br />
An armored woman with a mandolin strapped to her hip, a woman Camille recognized, steps in front of the torches, carrying a flag on a stick. She stabs the other end of the stick into the dirt and retreats, leaving the flag flapping in the wind. On the flag is the picture of a man from the torso up, half sculpted from a block of clay that makes up his lower region. The man brandishes a torch burning bright.<br />
<br />
"Promethian Order." River whispers in her ear needlessly. Camille knows the military guild well.<br />
<br />
"FIVE SECONDS." the man, who could only be Akethadar, raid leader of Promethian Order, bellows. Terris' head turns for a moment to stare at Camille, eyes two huge black pools. And then her head snaps back to the army at her gates.<br />
<br />
"ENGAGE!"<br />
<br />
<br />
   ***   ***   ***<br />
<br />
<br />
MOTION<br />
<br />
Pron, ogre warrior and hammerhead of Promethian Order leaps through the opening, the rest of the guild following in a wedge with military precision and then splitting to either side against the wall. Pron is screaming something unintelligible, a gutteral warcry in his native ogre. Quarken, barbarian warrior, is sidestepping like a crab to Terris' side. The rogues appear briefly as they cross in front of the shadows, and then dart quickly around the others and disappear again, to reappear behind Terris with daggers raised. Rangers ring Terris at a safe distance, bows unslung. The shadowknights and paladins form a wall behind Pron, ready to intercept should Pron be unable to hold her attention. Aamedor is leading the other clerics to a spot close enough to heal the warrior, then falls with them to his knees, each in supplication to whatever god gives them their gift. Tremas is pointing to various spots on the wall, as shaman, wizard and enchanters peel off and wait patiently. Katarin is playing a war march on her flute, feet moving in time, close to the wizards for when they will need amplification of their power. The mages and beastlords hold tight leashes on their pets, who are going wild with Pron's scream. The necro has one hand clasped to his pet's armbone, the other hand free and glowing to feed mana where necessary. The one druid with them sits down to meditate, only to be jerked roughly to her feet by Akethadar.<br />
<br />
"STAND, noob." he hisses.<br />
<br />
Pron and Terris connect.<br />
<br />
Camille involuntarily jerks back as Pron's dual swords cut into Terris, one to her side, the other to her arm, which flies up to cover her face. -Crack- Camille's head connects with River's stone chin, pain shooting through her head.<br />
<br />
"Sorry baby..." he murmurs.<br />
<br />
"Sok..." she says distractedly, eyes drinking in the battle.<br />
<br />
The swords meet with resistance, cutting through, but not as deep as a swing from an ogre would cut on a normal mortal. But Terris is no normal mortal. Her wounds bleed thick black blood, and she strikes back with a vengeance.<br />
<br />
"Beginning defensi..." Pron begins, crouching low as Terris unleashes her fury.<br />
<br />
"NO!" Akethadar yells, switching tactics in a blink. "POP RIPOSTE NOW! CLERICS, BEGIN YOUR CYCLE NOW ON A SHORT CHAIN, THERE WILL BE NO DEFENSIVE."<br />
<br />
"Riposte active now." Pron says automatically, weapons singing.<br />
<br />
Terris, furious, is swinging at Pron with blinding speed, but as his riposte disc settles in, every blow is knocked back or deflected, with his free hand slicing at her sides. Any plan Terris had of ignoring the warrior is gone, such is her blood rage. The clerics are shooting blue light into the warrior, but for as long as his disc holds, he would suffer no damage. In fact, for every one of Terris' swings, he is hacking back twice.<br />
<br />
"YOUR ALTERNATE ADVANCEMENT AT WORK, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN." Akethadar announces smugly. "QUARKEN, LEARN DOUBLE RIPOSTE IF YOU HAVEN'T."<br />
<br />
"I got it two months ago," Quarken replies, waiting for the assist call. "Is this really the place to try new tacti...?"<br />
<br />
"TASH IN. MALO IN. SLOW IN. KATARIN, GET THAT BITCH OCCLUDED."<br />
<br />
The male enchanter runs forward, casting tash to strip Terris of her magic resistance. It lands, and between swings Terris backhands the enchanter. He flies across the room like a kicked ball and smashes into the wall, crumbling unconscious to the floor. A shaman casts Malo with less notice.<br />
<br />
"THAT'S GUNNA HURT IN THE MORNING. GET THAT SLOW ON!"<br />
<br />
Katarin's tune reaches Terris' ears, and more of her resistances are drained away. A second shaman is already chanting, a cloud of insects pouring from his hands, swarming for Terris' nose. They greedily fly into her nostrils, massing and crawling up from the smooth expanse of skin where her mouth would normally be, had she had one, and Terris' movements slow as she breathes in the flies. Camille for some odd reason felt pity well up in her, as Terris' flailing upon Pron grinds down.<br />
<br />
"Slow is on!" the shaman says, and prepares to help the clerics.<br />
<br />
"ASSIST on TERRIS THULE!" Pron calls, and the rogues' daggers descend. The air is full of arrows as the rangers let loose their first volley and restring for the next. Pets unleashed leap into the fray as Promethian Order descends upon the bleeding goddess.<br />
<br />
"TREMAS, EYES OPEN. I HEAR SHE HAS TRICKS UP HER SLEEVE."<br />
<br />
'More like up her DRESS!" Tremas exclaims, sweat beading off his tall Erudite forehead from the heat of the lights. "Check it out!"<br />
<br />
Camille's eyes focus where he is pointing, and almost screams.<br />
<br />
Terris' belly is extending splitting her dress open in the front. Her skin strethes and cracks, and from within her, wraithes, hideaous black shapeless bodies with beautiful colored moth wings pour out of her like a dam breaking open.<br />
<br />
"SHE'S GOT BUTTERFLIES IN HER STOMACH." Akethadar says mirthlessly. "TAKE THEM OUT."<br />
<br />
The wraithes, free of their confinement, dive onto the hapless druid, who whether in shock or confusion sat to memorize a different spell. The mistake costs her her life, as the wraithes rip her to bloody shreds in seconds.<br />
<br />
"Stuns IN!" Tremas orders, as the two enchanters still in the fight begin to spin, hands building light. "Katarin, AMP US UP!"<br />
Katarin has no time to nod, as she switches tunes and plays furiously, feet dancing with blinding speed as she lends power to the wizards.<br />
<br />
-PULSE- shock waves pour forth from the enchanters in a palpable wave at the wraithes. The wizards begin to turn in time, hands burning red with wizard fire. They begin to empty their wrath into the colorful demons.<br />
<br />
The wraithes are stunned momentarily, but some resist the shock wave and reach greedily for the source. One enchanter screams as a wraith locks its teeth onto his wrist.<br />
<br />
"They're resisting! Where the hells are my heals??" he shrieks, as his hand is bit from hiswrist.<br />
<br />
"The druid was our healer..." Tremas shouts, spinning, magical flames shooting from his fingertips, sizzling the flesh of the wraithes.<br />
<br />
"LET HIM DIE." Akethadar announces mercilessly. "KNIGHTS, KEEP THE WRAITHES OFF THE WIZARDS!"<br />
<br />
Like a machine, the shadowknights and paladins spin from the butchery of Terris, and march into the tangle of wraithes and casters, stunning and snaring the remaining wraithes, keeping them busy while the wizards finish their incineration. The one enchantress alive collapses in exhaustion against the wall.<br />
<br />
"ON YOUR FEET!" Akethadar yells, to which she shakily stands. "THIS ISN'T OVER YET. PREPARE!"<br />
<br />
Terris, bleeding from a thousand wounds, opens her black eyes wide, and they glow white.<br />
<br />
Like a beam from a lighthouse cutting through the fog, she turns her gaze upon them. As the light washes over them, they slow, their adreneline bulging muscles contracting, the chanting becoming a whisper. And now, having completely stripped them of all their magical buffs and enhancements, she began to fight back and do damage.<br />
<br />
"MASS GROUP BUFFS IN!" Akethadar ordered.<br />
<br />
"Mass Group Buff KEI now...." the enchantress yells, stepping in close to the casters and clerics and letting blue light flow from her hands.<br />
<br />
"Mass Focus UP!" the shaman who had maloed cries, positioning himself close enough to catch all.<br />
<br />
"Group Alacrity incoming!" the other shaman calls.<br />
<br />
"ALACRITY?"<br />
<br />
"We're shy a few chanters." the shaman says apologetically, casting a watered down spell to hasten the swings of the melee.<br />
<br />
"Virtue INC!" a cleric calls, dropping out of the rotation.<br />
<br />
And quickly, precisely, the soldiers of Promethian Order are back in full swing, rebuffed and whittling down Terris like a fletcher's knife to an unshaped bow.<br />
<br />
"SHE'S GOING DOWN LIKE A HALAS WHORE." Akethadar shouts. "BE READY. I'M SURE THESE STATUES AREN'T HERE FOR DECORATION."<br />
<br />
And he is right. Camille feels River stiffen, limbs going back into the pose he was in before he embraced her. And while he stiffens, the other gargoyles begin to move, stone creaking as the leap down from their perches. One lifts its nose to the wind, and sniffs, its eyes blind, but its sense of smell keen. It smells blood, from the warriors and the chanters, and it and its three companions lope hungrily towards the fray. Terris' head snaps to the side, to glare in pain at Riverdane, and his lips are the only thing to move.<br />
<br />
"I cannot..." he whispers.<br />
<br />
A furious, betrayed look from Terris, one that nearly ripped Camille's heart in two. And then the bloody goddess turned back to the warrior carving her body.<br />
<br />
"KATARIN, PLAY RABBIT TO THOSE DOGS." Akethadar announces. Kat is already moving, at a speed that almost defied following with Camille's mortal eyes. Katarin circled each gargoyle, stabbing at it once and passing, till all four were following the singing woman in a large circle around the fight, oblivious to their bloody mistress in the center.<br />
<br />
"NOW IS THE TIME! DROP THIS BITCH!" Akethadar demands, "KNIGHTS, BE READY TO PEEL THESE OFF SONGBIRD WHEN TERRIS IS DEAD."<br />
<br />
Terris howls, a mournful note rising from all around the room, as the bloodshed continues. And finally, she falls forward to the floor, black blood pooled around her like an inky pond. One of the rogue's daggers is still in her back.<br />
<br />
"GOOD WORK! CLEAN THIS UP!" Akethadar shouts, as the knights begin to work over the gargoyles.<br />
<br />
Camille is not surprised to find that she is crying, chest heaving uncontrollably as she sobs, eyes locked on the growing pool of blood, as Akethadar begins to remove a ring from the corpses finger.<br />
<br />
And then, Akethadar notices the fifth statue.<br />
<br />
"What's this?" he says to himself out loud, staring at the likeness of River. The statue does not move.<br />
<br />
"Wyldechylde....." Akethadar hisses, recognizing. He is oblivious of Camille's presence two feet away. There is no surprise, no wonder, at why a statue of Riverdane Wyldechylde should be in the midst of Terris Thule's lair. Just an odd look that chills Camille as Akethadar smiles.<br />
<br />
"QUARKEN, YOU HAD IT EASY THIS FIGHT. GET A STRENGTH ON HIM, SHAMAN. THIS STATUE IS COMING BACK TO THE GUILDHOUSE."<br />
<br />
Noooo, Camille thinks, as Quarken is buffed and marches over unhappily to lift the statue off its base. He props it over one shoulder, and marches toward the exit.<br />
<br />
For a second River's head tilts up, unseen to the others, and looks Camille straight in the eye. <br />
<br />
"Venge..." he whispers.<br />
<br />
And then he, Quarken and the others are gone.<br />
<br />
Camille steps out of her shock, staring forlornly at the beaten figure of Terris in the center of the arena. Repulsed she walks through the blood, intent on seeing if the goddess' eyes are at least closed in death. A useless gesture, but one she felt compelled to provide. She stood over the fallen woman and reached down to turn her head up.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, with an iron grip, Terris' hand grips Camille's arm like a vice, startling a choked scream from the paladin. She turns her mutilated face up to Camille.<br />
<br />
~~VENGE~~ Terris shrieks insanely, the disembodied voice ringing in Camille's ears. <br />
<br />
And then, in shock, Camille pitches forward as her consciousness flees, and all is black.</font></p>

	<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" >"See I told you..." Talvarien said from in front of the stove, as Camille walked groggily into the dining area. Grelin was already there, as Talvarien busied himself at a pan over the fire. "I make a mean egg, MEAN eggs. Bad egg! BAD! Ack ack, your brains are scrambled! Nono, let go of the spatula! Down egg DOWN! Nooooooo!"<br />
<br />
Grelin chuckled, watching Talvarien mock wrestle with the frying pan, going into convulsions with two hands wrapped around the insulated handle. Camille tried to smile through bloodshot eyes but failed, and raised one hand in exhaustion.<br />
<br />
"Not before coffee." she managed.<br />
<br />
"Coming right u..." Talvarien started, grabbing a cup already prepared off the counter and spinning to face her. Then he got a good look at the bags under her eyes and her frown, and gingerly handed the cup over. "Um, usually one sleeps when they say 'I am going to sleep'."<br />
<br />
"Dream?" Grelin asked, concerned.<br />
<br />
"Aye." Camille confirmed, sitting down and gripping the coffee cup with two hands. She raised the cup to her lips and sipped. Perfect. She didn't know about Talvarien's eggs, but he made a good cup of coffee. "This is good, Talv."<br />
<br />
Talvarien pulled up a seat next to her and watched her drink. "Soooo, I take it this one wasn't about the Mr. Antonica Bodybuilding Contest. More screaming statues?"<br />
<br />
"And then some." Camille agreed, beginning to tell of her dream.<br />
<br />
"Amazingly after that lovely vivid freak show I'm still hungry." Talvarien said. Grelin just looked pensive after hearing Camille's dream through to the end. Talvarien got up to inspect his breakfast. "Noooooooo, bad eggs! Cold, COLD eggs! Sigh, so, cold eggs anyone?"<br />
<br />
They began to eat Talvarien's ruined breakfast. Even cold, they were still good.<br />
<br />
"Soooo, what are we doing today?" Talv asked, cleaning up his work area. "Chat about the old gang, tangle with that killer horse? Blindfold ourselves and fire arrows at Orc One?"<br />
<br />
"I don't know about you," Camille said, walking for the door. "But I'm going to speak with Akethadar from Promethian Order." She exited through the doorway. After a quick pause, Grelin disappeared after her.<br />
<br />
"Greatttt." Talvarien said outloud to himself. "We're going to ask Promethian Order if they starred in any dreams lately." He looked forlornly at his half-empty cup of coffee, and gulped the rest down. "Yup, I get the feeling I'm gunna need this." Then he sprinted through the door, his voice carrying down the halls:<br />
<br />
"Cami, Grelin, wait for meeeee!"<br />
<br />
<br />
   ***   ***   ***<br />
<br />
<br />
The guildhouse of Promethian Order was two times the size of Razor's Edge and four times as opulent. They had the money to spend on the finest wood, most polished marble, highest craftsmenship and it showed. Talvarien openly gaped as the went through the front lobby. Camille just continued to march, not sure how to proceed, working over and discarding a hundred opening speeches for when she saw Akethadar. Hi, do you have a statue of my dead husband? didn't seem like it would go over very well.<br />
<br />
"Well," Talvarien said nervously, glancing around the lobby and its variety of statues and figurines. "I don't see River, can we go now?"<br />
<br />
Camille shot him a look. "Did you think they would be using him as a lawn elf, holding a lantern?" she said dryly.<br />
<br />
"Knowing how Akethadar felt about him, yes yes." Talvarien replied.<br />
<br />
"Come on," Camille said, tugging Talvarien's elbow. They moved further in.<br />
<br />
The place was huge. "I don't even know where to start." Camille commented.<br />
<br />
Grelin pointed to the side, a separate room with the sound of many people in it. "Bar." he indicated.<br />
<br />
"Ah, good idea." Camille said, steering the three into the in-house tavern of Promethian Order.<br />
<br />
The place was bustling with activity. Too much activity. First thing Camille noticed was that at least half of the guild was in the bar area drinking and talking. For a guild as active as Promethian Order, if they weren't raiding they would usually be training. This kind of inactivity keyed her into the fact that something was out of place.<br />
<br />
"Soooo, where to start?" Talvarien asked, pushing his way through the crowd. They paid him little attention, but the chatter dropped a notch as Camille entered the room. She had the distinct feeling most of the bar's attention was suddenly riveted on her. Then conversation kicked up again, but more hushed. Her skin crawled as she got the impression of being scrutinized by dozens of eyes.<br />
<br />
After glancing around, she noticed Katarin sitting in a corner in the 'Member's Only', intent on retuning a mandolin that lay in her lap. She began making her way towards her, looking back once to address Talvarien and Grelin.<br />
<br />
"Go hang out in the 'Guests and Applicant' side of the bar, guys." she said. "This will only take a moment."<br />
<br />
Grelin nodded and took Talvarien by the elbow towards the less populated area of the bar reserved for non-guildmembers.<br />
<br />
"What can I get you?" the bartender asked, friendly enough, to Grelin.<br />
<br />
"Water." Grelin said.<br />
<br />
"Well, that's a first, in here." the bartender chuckled, pouring a small glass. "One plat please."<br />
<br />
Grelin fished out a platinum piece and dropped it on the counter.<br />
<br />
"One plat!" Talvarien cried indignantly, "How much is a glass of wine, his left leg and firstborn??" And then he glanced to his right, spotting a beautiful red-headed female knight sitting alone. "Um, two glasses of wine please." He dropped 10 plat onto the bar. "I'll send you the leg tomorrow and the firstborn as soon as she delivers." he grinned, pointed to the knight. And then he slid over to her.<br />
<br />
"Helllllllo." he said, placing the glass of wine in front of the woman, who looked up and smiled. "Guest or applicant?"<br />
<br />
"Guest," she said, with a voice deep for a female, and undeniably sexy.<br />
<br />
"Well, imagine that," Talvarien exclaimed with surprise. "SO am I! Talvarien, ranger." He extended his hand.<br />
<br />
"Bonlainy, paladin." she said, going to shake his hand. But with a smooth move Talvarien caught her hand and brought it up to his lips, lightly kissing the back of it.<br />
<br />
"Charmed, I'm sure." Talvarien replied.<br />
<br />
Bonlainy looked at him oddly. "You don't want to do that, sailor." she said, withdrawing her hand slowly. "I'm a mangina."<br />
<br />
Grelin choked on his water. Talvarien sat down close to her and went on blithely.<br />
<br />
"Mangina? What's that?" he said, "Sounds foreign. Foreign is sexy. S-E-X-Y, sexy."<br />
<br />
"Mangina? You really want to know?", Bonlainy chuckled. "Ok, loverboy. I'm from Walkers, and it happened long ago, on our first Fear break. It went horribly, corpses piling up, including mine, and time ticking down. We were close to the three hour mark, and we feared the entire guild would be wiped. So Whizbang tells us to swallow our pride, and calls in Regression to corpse recover us. Of course, we should have done this a long time ago, but we were thickheaded then. Regression swoops in, and starts mass ressurecting us. But my body is too old, I'm toast. Oh, by the way, at the time I was a man, my name was Bono. Anyway, Divide, the human female monk who led Regression, dies several times to deathtouches while pulling us all back to camp. In the rush, she left several corpses. And as I'm floating there, feeling the pull of Marr to claim my soul, all I'm thinking about is my little girl, whom I would leave orphaned; her mother had died at childbirth long ago. So, having lost my body, when they went to resurrect Divide's bodies, I fought Marr's call and took Divide's place in one of them. Bye bye Bono, hello Bonlainy. And let me tell you, high heels are a bitch. So that's what mangina means, man with a vagi...."<br />
<br />
"CHECK PLEASE!" Talvarien called, staring at the wall. <br />
<br />
<br />
   ***   ***   ***<br />
<br />
<br />
Camille stood at the edge of the booth, looking down at Katarin, who was tightening one of her instrument's strings, lost in the job.<br />
<br />
"Kat..." Camille began.<br />
<br />
Kat's head snapped up and registered Camille standing over her.<br />
<br />
"Oh my god, Cami..." she said, looking around hastily to see if she was observed. Serveral eyes had followed Camille's progress through the bar, but they were elsewhere now.<br />
<br />
"Can I sit down?" Camille asked, after a pregnant pause.<br />
<br />
"Oh, yes, sorry." Katarin said, motioning to a spot in the booth opposite her. "Forgive me, you just....startled me."<br />
<br />
Startled was a good word for it. And Camille noticed something else on Katarin's face, totally out of place...guilt.<br />
<br />
"First off," Camille began, settling in, "I'd like to thank you properly, for singing at River's funeral. I know he would have enjoyed that, he loved your singing..."<br />
<br />
"Was my pleasure." Katarin replied, waving it off, "I only wish it wasn't a performance for the reasons it was..."<br />
<br />
"And secondly, is more business." Camille said, jumping right to the point. "I need to know if..."<br />
<br />
"...it's gone." Katarin said quickly, face pained. "I'm sorry, I know it must have been a shock to find it miss..."<br />
<br />
"Gone?" Camille asked blankly. Katarin registered it differently than it was intended.<br />
<br />
"The memorial to River. It's gone." Katarin repeated quietly. "But I want to assure you Promethian Order was not the ones who took it from wherever you had erected it. We found it in Terris Thule's lair, and we weren't even sure it was yours until you showed up here out of the blue. Akethadar swore Terris planted it there to tick him off, reading dreams or something."<br />
<br />
"The statue...was here." Camille repeated in a daze. All color drained out of her face. The nightmares, all true. But how, why...?<br />
<br />
"I just want to make sure you know we Promethians are not bad people. We would never deface a grave. And not all of us hated River or blamed him for what happened during End Game, that was beyond any of us." She looked genuinely striken through the entire monologue. Bards were known to be good actors as part of their trade, but Camille had no reason to doubt Katarin's sincerity.<br />
<br />
"Tell me..." Camille said, unsure of how to proceed, stomach flipping at the thought of River whispering in her ear. "Tell me more about the statue...and where it is now." Could it be? Could River still be alive in that stone, somehow? Someway? Or was it merely a statue, and her mind had added the parts of it moving and speaking to her as her heart refused to let go of the one man she had ever truly loved? And what of 'Avenge' and 'Venge'? And that awful voice 'Free...'? Her mind ran amok with questions.<br />
<br />
"What I am about to tell you now you must promise to me you will never repeat to another living soul." Katarin said in a whisper, eyes back darting around the room. "If anyone finds out I've told you, I could be thrown out of the guild, and I need my job."<br />
<br />
"I promise." Camille lied. It hurt her abstractly to lie to Katarin like that, but anything that may pertain to River still being alive out there was her first priority.<br />
<br />
"Can I get you ladies something to drink?" a barmaid asked, appearing at the edge of the booth. Katarin waved her away with one hand.<br />
<br />
"No, no, we're good." Kat said, and the barmaid walked away to serve another table.<br />
<br />
Kat picked up the mandolin and started playing, a light soothing song. The barmaid passed by them again, but the closer she got, the more her focus started to slip, till she blankly stared and walked past. As she got further away, her focus seemed to come back, and expression returned to her face.<br />
<br />
"There." Katarin said softly, continuing to play. "That will keep away listening ears."<br />
<br />
"Tell me." Camille begged, leaning forward to not miss a single word. The need to know was eating at her like acid.<br />
<br />
And Katarin began her tale.</font></p>

	<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" >"Ake was obsessed with the statue. OBSESSED. He thought Terris, sensing we were coming for her by tapping into Ake's dreams while he plotted her takedown, arranged for a likeness of Riverdane to throw him off. Fortunately, we never even saw it till it was all over, 'cause I think Ake would have lost it had he seen it. Ever since the Fear thing during End Game, he was on an anti-River kick, down to warning against us attending the funeral, nice try, and actually celebrating with some of River's political enemies when Razor's Edge was disbanded afterward. It was an ugly side of him, but that was between him and River, normally he's not as bad as his public image sometimes presents, and he IS a damned good raid leader.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the statue came back with us after we defeated Terris. The news travelled fast that we had taken out the Goddess of Nightmares, even had we wanted to hide the fact that we took out a goddess, things of that scale don't go unnoticed long. But the statue is something we kept quiet. Some, like me, suspected what you've confirmed just by being here: the statue wasn't created by Terris to taunt Akethadar, but actually taken by her from a memorial. I have to admit, with my schedule lately I haven't been to the river in Kithicor, so I had never seen that you had put one up. But I had a feeling you were the one, and I've been dreading the day one of our people slipped with the tongue and you came looking for it. I'm so sorry Cami, I was mortified; I didn't know what to do, and I'm more than a little embarrassed it wasn't me who told you about it, but....how can I apologize enough? It was my job, you know, on the line. Work for bards is hard enough to find, especially with the pay as good as it...<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, I'm drifting. The statue came back to the guildhouse, and Ake had Quarken place it in his private chambers. Then, rather than attend the post-raid party, Ake just locked himself up with it. I was busy with the rest of the guild, and I'll have to admit, I was getting a buzz on. It's not every day you take out a god. And suddenly, Akethadar sends for me.<br />
<br />
So, there I am, head swimming, when the maid ushers me into the room. Akethadar is in his training outfit, covered with sweat. One of the lounge's pianos has been wheeled into the room in a corner. And Ake's knuckles are bleeding, dripping onto the floor. I mean really beat up. And his eyes are sort of flat, odd, but not too odd for Ake. He gets that look when he's heavy in planning or just before a raid moves. People say he's a little crazy, his brains scrambled from all the rezzes when he pulls, but it's not that...people don't know him like I do. He's just very very focused. I see you don't agree, but like I said, you have to work close with him like I do to understand it. I'll stop singing his praises, this is something we'll never agree on....<br />
<br />
So he's bleeding all over the marble floor, and I'm standing there, partially wasted from too much ale. All I'm thinking about is going back to the party a little and getting some good smoke, and then passing out in my room. And Ake points to piano and asks me to play something classical. So I do. What do you say when your boss tells you to play? You just play, so I played.<br />
<br />
As I begin, Ake starts circling the statue, like one of those big cats from Iceclad. Round and round he circles, breathing evenly, eyes closed, but feet still guiding him in a perfect circle. You can tell he's getting into the music, and I have to tell you, playing it, I watched him, and I felt hypnotized, watching him circle like that. I think we were both hypnotizing each other. I don't know...<br />
<br />
Then suddenly, like a snake, Akethadar takes a swing at the statue, right into River's face. CRACK. I heard bones crunch in Akethadar's fist, and the statue's nose splits open a new wound on his knuckle, spraying blood onto the statue's face. I stop playing, it's obvious Ake just broke his hand.<br />
<br />
PLAY, he says. I think I mumbled something about him needing a cleric, but he just fixes me with that flat look. PLAY he repeats, so I do.<br />
<br />
Now I'm feeling really uncomfortable, but he starts that even circle again, and I see his muscles loosening. He's leaving this bloody trail as he walks around the statue, ringing it in red. And then, again with no warning, he plants and kicks to the statue's chest. Nothing, the statue doesn't even budge, so much so that Ake is thrown off balance and lands on his ass.<br />
<br />
Then he goes nuts, getting up, going into some crazy monk posture and goes to town on the statue, pummelling, flailing, like a wild man. And all the while I'm scared out of my wits, trying to keep playing to calm him down or something. I even try using my magic to soothe him, but nothing is working. And meanwhile, the statue is unyeilding, and blood is all over the room, as Ake practically cuts himself to ribbons. It's splattering everywhere, the bed, the piano everywhere. Ake is swinging wildly, and missed the statue, and puts his broken fist THROUGH the stone wall. Cami, I don't know what the hells you had that statue made of, but it was harder than granite. And seeing his hand in the wall and the statue unbroken, Akethadar just redoubled his effort. I don't know which was more unbroken, the statue or his rage. Finally, after the blood started getting on ME, I couldn't take it anymore. I just stopped playing and ran out; I don't even think Ake noticed. I found Aamedor and quietly sent him to take care of him, and then went to my room and washed the blood off of me and passed out. The next day I saw Akethadar, and Aamedor had done the job, he seemed healed. Ake didn't say anything to me, like it hadn't happened, and I wasn't about to bring it up. For the next few days we didn't see Akethadar around the guildhouse; he stayed holed up in his room. But he didn't call for me. Aamedor I did spot heading that way several times during that time. Ake's maid quit near the end."<br />
<br />
"This is....horrifying." Cami said, finding her voice. "All that hate...."<br />
<br />
"Akethadar is an intense man." Katarin said, as if that explained it. "Quite honestly, I was freaked out, but not surprised. He and River had a lousy past, and Akethadar treats all of his enemies the same, without mercy. It's just that Akethadar wanted to split that stone, it was a matter of pride, and even in death, River defied him."<br />
<br />
Camille smiled without mirth. "Yeah, that was River, he could get a rise out of a corpse."<br />
<br />
"But..." Katarin said, "All that craziness aside, that's not the bad part...."<br />
<br />
Camille just stared at her, willing her to go on.<br />
<br />
And on she went.<br />
<br />
<br />
   ***   ***   ***<br />
<br />
<br />
"What do you know about Grieg Veneficus?" Katarin asked. Camille was startled by the question.<br />
<br />
"Um..." she said. "Just that he was instrumental in us getting up to Luclin in the old days."<br />
<br />
"Alright," Katarin said, "You know the name, that's enough. He was a powerful geomancer, drawing his power from stone and earth, manipulating the properties of gems, things along those nature, and as much a scientist as a magic user. He was one of the few non-gnomes that ever mastered tinkering beyond the mechanical bait we other races can throw together. Anyway, he had a castle you may or may not have heard about off Dawnshroud Peaks on the light side of the moon. When the Combine Empire wanted off Luclin in the early days, and he couldn't find a way to reverse what he had done, they turned on him and holed him up in his castle. He became a recluse, working on a way to return the unhappy populace back to their native Norrath. He was never heard from again, and presumably died there. Some of the lore indicates Luclin, the goddess herself, intervened in some way with his progress, but that may just be a dramatic flair prior bards had added to make the songs more interesting. A lot about Luclin is hazy, we tellers of the stories not having actually been there, and instead, picking up tidbits from the moon folks.<br />
<br />
History lesson over. Promethian wanted to hit Grieg's castle. Tremas had an idea if Grieg had been a geomancer, there was probably a wealth of gemstones cached somewhere inside his old castle, as well as the possibility of ore for bane weapons in our eventual plan of attack of Emperor Ssraeshza. So we gear up, port into Dawnshroud, and enter the castle.<br />
<br />
Well, I can see why it's been left alone, place seems empty, but you take just five steps inside, and bam, this thing that looked like a rockhopper pops out of nowhere, and attacks us. The thing is much stronger than any rockhopper I've dealth with, but we take it out. Quarken gets bit, and after a few moments, I don't see Quarken. Instead, there's this woodelf woman with us I've never seen before wearing his armor. Meanwhile, she's talking just like quarken, his voice everything. So I say to Pron, who the hells is she, and points. And Pron freaks and draws his sword and rushes the girl, and the girl says in Quarken's voice What the hells, Pron? and parries the swing that would have killed her. And meanwhile Pron is saying ASSIST ON A VAMPIRE BAT and the whole guild is looking at him like he's nuts. So he sort of stops, realizing the woodelf is making no move to attack him. And Tremas says, why the hells are you attacking a plant, Pron? And after enough confusion, Akethadar finally realizes that whatever bit Quarken injected him with some poison, that must ooze out of the skin like a gas or something and infect the minds of whoever is around them, making them hallucinate that the infected is something else, at least until it is out of their system. So, the rest of the crawl is pretty nuts, with us moving on, aggroing more of these weird sentinels and half the time trying to kill each other instead of the mobs.<br />
<br />
But we push on, we don't back down easily. After a while, it actually got amusing, and we started to recognize which were the traps and which were really us, and by assisting Pron only instead of tank plowing, Pron was the only one to get bit, so we only had to worry about one shapeshifter. And we moved deeper in. We didn't know if these were old traps or something new, but we got the sense something was happening.<br />
<br />
Finally we got to what had to be Grieg's chambers. I won't detail the route or how we got there, it's not important. The important thing, was, SOMETHING was there, alive, the ugliest piece of garbage I had ever seen. It was this purple floating....blob, mass of...something. It still had some guards around it, odd four-armed natives of Luclin, but we took them out easily enough. And then the fight with this thing itself starts. <br />
<br />
It was casting areas, bad. Some sort of spell where the gravel floor in the room rose up to our knees like a flood, snaring us all as effectively as if we were crawling through mud. And trying to approach it, every now and then it'd pulse light, and anyone near it would be blown back clear to the other side of the room, to have to crawl their way back to it. And it's proccing some sort of blindness on Pron, who after the assist call is yelling 'Where the hells is it?' and meanwhile it's three feet away. Fortunately, Pron's instincts kicked in on the engage and he planted himself in a corner, or he would have been blown across the room and probably would have killed one of us thinking it was this floating turd.<br />
<br />
All during the fight, the purple thinf is going through the same transformations we had seen our own people go through, but rapidly, shifting forms and races like it was made of elastic. And the fight rages on, stun stun stun. But we're hurting it, bad, and finally Tremas lands big nuke just as it is flinging out one of those big stuns.<br />
<br />
Well, the stun lands just before the nuke, blowing the entire guild into the wall. Except Ake, he was timing the stuns, and it didn't take someone as focused as he gets long to figure it out. He dives behind a door as the stun goes off, and missed getting tossed completely.<br />
<br />
Tremas' nuke lands, and sizzle goes the purple blob, and drops to the floor like a balloon with the air let out. JUST like a balloon, cept it isn't air that leaks out of it, it's this black gas. And the gas coalesces, and what does it form into, but the form of Old Grieg himself, if the paintings in some of the rooms were accurate. And Grieg takes off back toward where we had pulled the purple people eater.<br />
<br />
Ake is the only one not crawling through this gravel, having been out of the room behind the door, when Greig runs past him. Ake yells, I GOT IT and follows, and we hear the sounds of a struggle as we come out of our stuns and crawl through the liquid rock. And when we get there, there's Ake, standing over the corpse of Grieg, and just looking around the room in a daze. Tremas asks him if he's ok, and he just tells Tremas to loot the corpse, and continues to stand there, totally not with it. It's enough to be noticeable, but Tremas takes over, and tsarts pointing people around the room to strip anything they find. You know, the plunder part of pillage and plunder.<br />
<br />
Trem was right, there's a load of gems, tho no ore for weapons. And other things, nice stuff, flowing thought gloves, and a silk bridle that summons a horse, a wisdom caster breast plate that had Aamedor drooling. And then Tremas goes to grab this blue gemstone, rather large, that was sitting on a velvet pillow near the bed in the room.<br />
<br />
LEAVE IT, Ake commands, coming out of his fog, and shoots Tremas a look that made my skin crawl. It was....mean, like, nasty. And unlike Ake, even when I have seen him at his worst, even when he was working over the statue. <br />
<br />
Tremas must have sensed it too, cause he just put up both hands in supplication and went elsewhere. And then Akethadar tells us to grab the rest of the stuff and go, immediately, and stalks out of the room.<br />
<br />
Quarken almost grabbed the gem anyway, but something about Ake's tone must have freaked out Tremas, cause Tremas just goes off on Quarken and they end up leaving without the gem. I don't blame Tremas...had I been in charge of loot and Ake told me to leave something, like he did, I would have without thinking twice. I think Ake would have murdered Tremas had he disobeyed him."<br />
<br />
Camille had taken this all in, and cut in when Katarin took a breath to continue.<br />
<br />
"Kat, what does this have to do with the statue?" she asked, intrigued but confused.<br />
<br />
"I'm getting to that," Katarin said, with a sad look on her face, and then continued. <br />
<br />
<br />
   ***   ***   ***<br />
<br />
<br />
"We got back to the guildhouse after distributing the loot, and the post-raid winddown starts, with most of us here in the bar. Akethadar goes immediately into his room, for what I thought would be another bout with the statue. After a while, tho, the normal call near the end of the night from Ake's new maid to Aamedor to patch him up doesn't happen. Aamedor gets concerned and calls me with him, I grab Tremas and we go to check on Ake.<br />
<br />
After knocking on the door for ten minutes, Aamedor finally pushes it open. And there's Akethadar, standing completely naked in front of an open window, with all the torches out, staring up at the moon and talking to himself. Just mumbling nonsense phrases, in an odd voice. He's not cut or anything, unlike the other times he's been with the statue. In fact he's ignoring it, and us. Just mumbling, bathed in moonlight, his skin so pale he almost looks like a statue himself. I of course shouldn't be looking at this, and leave and close the door. Then more mumbling, and Aamedor comes out, saying Ake ordered him to leave him with Tremas. I hear Tremas asking if he's alright, and then more mumbling. And then I hear the sound of Tremas porting. I opened the door, but they were both gone. And so was the statue.<br />
<br />
Aamedor and I left the room and headed as fast as selo's would take us to West Commonlands, to the wizard portal, hoping that would be where Tremas came back, when he did. Stayed there the whole night, biting my fingernails, while Aamedor almost fell asleep. We finally went home around five in the morning and I slept through the afternoon. I had figured wrong, Tremas came back with Ake via North Ro, and I missed all the drama when he returned and then slept through the debriefing of the rest of the guild.<br />
<br />
What I'm going to tell you next came directly from Tremas, and there's parts he hasn't even told the guild, so you have to keep this to yourself, cause it's not only embarrassing, it's disturbing.<br />
<br />
Ake had told Tremas between gibberish to port him and the statue to Dawnshroud. Tremas tried to get more out of him, but Akethadar just went on mumbling, till with heavy reservations Tremas did as his superior officer asked and left me and Aamedor outside the room while he brought a stripped Akethadar and the statue of River to the moon.<br />
<br />
He said the port in was ringed with mobs, these tall gangling humanoid shaped with black scarfs or something tied across their faces. They were digging holes around the port-in area, burying large chunks of glowing rocks in a ring around where druids and wizards usually land. They certainly didn't look friendly, and the bodies of a few dead woodelves were collecting flies nearby, most likely the remains of the last group to port in. The scarved mobs raised their shovels to attack us, but Akethadar mumbled a few sentences, and they slowly lowered their shovels. And then, as one creature, half a dozen of them picked up the statue and started dragging it away.<br />
<br />
Tremas was completely freaking out, but Akethadar was smiling, staring after them. And then, in his own voice, clearly, Akethadar said to no one in particular....'There you are. Now you are free....'..."<br />
<br />
"...'Free...'.." Camille whispered.<br />
<br />
"Yes," Katarin continued. "And then Akethadar, raid leader of one of Norrath's largest military guilds, a man who masterminded the take down of a goddess, pissed down his own leg. And all he did was laugh as he did it, not even glancing down. And Tremas said the laugh was totally incredibly insane.<br />
<br />
Tremas had seen enough, and tried to port out of there, but for some reason, half a second after he began his port spell, it just...failed. No fizzle, no nothing, just a failure to port. And the things that had dragged off the statue were coming back. So he grabbed Ake by the hand and led him, still laughing, like a crazed child away from the port-in. It took him a good quarter-mile from the port-in area to actually get his teleport to take, and finally went the North Ro route, Akethadar still laughing in tow, and snuck him in the back way to the guildhouse. <br />
<br />
We haven't raided since, Cami. Most of us know bits and pieces of what's happened, and we spend a lot of our time in here trying to forget the fact that our leader is a raving lunatic. We tried posting a 24 hour guard on him, but one fell asleep, and Ake..." she faltered.<br />
<br />
"What?" Camille asked quietly, "What did Akethadar do?"<br />
<br />
"He clawed his own eyes out." Katarin whispered. <br />
<br />
Camille's hand gripped the edge of the table hard. "I'm sorry Kat."<br />
<br />
"So am I..." Katarin said softly. "So, the statue is gone, on Luclin somewhere. If you are going after it, Cami, be careful." She put her hand over Camille's and squeezed to drive her next point home. "Something got into Ake's head when we went into Grieg's. Something bad. And Ake isn't easy to break. But he's broken, bad, ok?"<br />
<br />
"I understand." Camille whispered, looking into the bard's haunted eyes. Katarin let go, offered a small odd smile.<br />
<br />
"Go get your friends and get going." she said, "Quarken's been looking over here too much, and he's a nasty drunk." And then she waved to the bar maid as Camille stood. "Barmaid, something strong....no ice. Just one."<br />
<br />
Camille took that as her dismissal and made her way to Grelin and Talvarien at the bar.</font></p>

<br />
"About time!" Talvarien said, "...'this will just take a second...' she says! At these prices, I almost had to sell Grelin for some ice!" Then he pointed to Bonlainy's back, as the red-headed paladin was making her way out of the bar. "What a waste, you see the way she walks? She's a mangina. You know what a mangina is?"<br />
<br />
"Bono?" Camille replied. "Yes, a shame, but at least he did what was right for his little girl."<br />
<br />
"What the hells!" Talvarien exclaimed indignantly, "What was I, dead, when they gave the speech about manginas?"<br />
<br />
"Probably." Grelin smiled.<br />
<br />
"Talv," Cami said gently, "You ARE a ranger..."<br />
<br />
"Alright alright enough!" Talvarien cried, hands up in supplication. "Enough with the ranger-bashing. I get enough of that when I see my mother."<br />
<br />
"Well well..." a drunken voice said nastily, as its owner appeared suddenly to Camille's right. Quarken. "Mrs. Wyldechylde! Started whoring the bars when your inheritance ran out?" The smell of liquor on his breath washed across her as she frowned.<br />
<br />
"I was just leaving, Quarken." Camille said brusquely, starting to walk away.<br />
<br />
"Not so fast." Quarken said, stepping in front of her with agility of a man only half as drunk as he was. "What bring you here to enemy ground?"<br />
<br />
"Personal business." she replied curtly, and tried to shoulder past his barbarian frame. But he moved fast, catching the wrist of her sword hand and pulling her in close to him.<br />
<br />
"What business?" he asked, his grip iron.<br />
<br />
Grelin grabbed Quarken's hand. "Hands off." he said quietly.<br />
<br />
Quarken paused for a moment, staring incredulously at the young man's hand on his. And then with alarming speed, Quarken picked up Grelin with one hand by his shirt and tossed him over the bar. Glass tinkled as Grelin hit the floor.<br />
<br />
Like a flash, Talv reached over his shoulder to draw his bow. He pulled it off his back.....CRACK and it hit the edge of the bar loudly. Talv fought for his grip on it, other hand drawing an arrow, nocking it and pulling back....WHACK his elbow connecting solidly with the bartender's face and TWANG in the confined quarters Talv's sweating hands let loose the actual bow on the disturbed draw and THUNK the bow snaps back to strike Talvarien squarely across his nose, bloodying it before he dropped it in a daze to the ground. Vision swimming, Talvarien brought up his then empty fists and waved them around wildly.<br />
<br />
"NOBODY MOVE OR THE RANGER GETS HURT!" he warned shrilly.<br />
<br />
"So," Quarken asked again, breathing fumes in Camille's face, as she tried to wrench free of his grasp. "What business?"<br />
<br />
"Take your hands off the lady." a hooded man said quietly from the bar. He was hovering over a mug of ale, face obscured.<br />
<br />
"Stay out of this, applicant." Quarken said slowly. "We may be shy on monks lately, but I won't hesitate to blacklist you, Brother."<br />
<br />
"I'm not your brother." the man said evenly, drawing back his hood. Camille recognized him instantly, the shaved clean head, the chiselled features, the eagle sharp eyes.<br />
<br />
"Roc...?" she said in shock.<br />
<br />
"Don't make me hurt you, Rocsalt." Quarken said, but his grip on Camille's wrist was wavering.<br />
<br />
"Hurt me?" Rocsalt Di'Varr, former officer of Razor's Edge, said calmly. "Boy, I have more alternative advancement training under my belt than you have hair on your balls." And then added, after an appraising look at the fuming Quarken, "Although in your case, I could have just turned Baron and still said that, I suppose."<br />
<br />
Camille forgotten, Quarken released her wrist and grabbed in a rage for the monk.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
   ***   ***   ***<br />
<br />
<br />
Quarken learned three lessons that day, lessons that had he been sober, he would have realized he knew already.<br />
<br />
LESSON ONE: Don't ever fight a monk with your bare hands<br />
<br />
Quarken's hands reached to pull Rocsalt off the bar stool. But Roc wasn't there. With a flex of his leg muscles, Roc planted his heels into the crossbars near the base of the stool, and leapt straight up. Quarken's lunge ended up with him grabbing air, as Rocsalt simply was not there. The monk instead came down on top of the bar, and delivered a kick under Quarken's chin. Had Quarken's tongue not been back far enough, the barbarian warrior would have bitten his own tongue in two.<br />
<br />
The rest of the bar, some with amusement, some with fear, scattered to the side. Quarken dived at Roc's legs in front of him.<br />
<br />
Again, Rocsalt wasn't there. With a high leap, Rocsalt dove up and over Quarken, as Quarken rushed the bar with a rage. As Quarken's belly hit the edge of the bar, Roc came down behind him on his hands, and pushed back up, both feet pistoning out at Quarken's rear. The spring kick propelled Quarken up in the air over the bar, sending the enraged warrior into a rack of bottles, shattering glass and drenching him in ten different varieties of alcohol. Meanwhile, Roc came out of the spring smoothly and landed on his feet, and without a look back started to walk away from the bar. Quarken stumbled to his feet, bleeding from superficial wounds from the glass, but more wounded in the pride area. He picked up a broken bottle and climbed back onto the bar, eyes locked on Roc's retreating form, murder in his eyes.<br />
<br />
LESSON TWO: If you attack a monk with a weapon, be sober enough to use it<br />
<br />
With a roar, Quarken jumped off the bar at Roc's back, broken bottle raised, jagged edges glinting dangerously. Roc deftly stepped to the side, hands reaching back, locking Quarken's forearm at the wrist. Then, one, two, three, Rocsalt forced Quarken's locked hand down at a close table, striking it three times with the broken bottle. The bottle shattered more each time, until Quarken was left with nothing but a bit of broken glass in his hand. Roc released his grip and danced to the side.<br />
<br />
Quarken reached down and grabbed one of the legs on the table, and with a flex and the sound of splintering wood, tore it free of the table. He turned to Rocsalt brandishing it like a club, waving it back and forth as he advanced towards the monk. Stabbing with the splintered edge, he backed Rocsalt up against the bar, more cautiously this time, as pain and humiliation sharpened his ale-addled senses.<br />
<br />
Another lunge at Roc, and Roc was up and leaping onto the bar. But now the bar was covered in spilled booze and glass. Roc's feet slipped from underneath him on the wet countertop, and he tried to adjust himself by jumping onto a nearby table. He realized as he was landing a moment too late that he chose as his landing spot the table Quarken had used to get the wooden leg. With only three legs to support Rocsalt, the table flipped over, dropping Rocsalt like a sack of flour onto the floor. Roc's head hit the floor with a dull thud, and his whole body went slack as he stopped moving. Quarken laughed nastily, stepping over the unconscious monk, one foot on either side of his body, and raised the splintered leg high. Camille watched helplessly from across the room as Quarken brought down the leg to impale Rocsalt into the floor.<br />
<br />
LESSON THREE: No matter how drunk you are, never forget you are fighting a feign death class<br />
<br />
Without even opening his eyes, Rocsalt swung up his foot and kicked Quarken between the legs with a sickening thump. Quarken howled like a dog shot with an arrow, club dropping uselessly to the ground, as he cupped his bruised crotch and staggered against the bar for support. Roc semi rolled back onto his shoulders and then from a laying position jumped back up to his feet. Quarken, with tears of pain pouring down his face, was gesturing weakly at his guildmates.<br />
<br />
"What the hells are you looking at!" he yelled, face still in agony. "Get them!"<br />
<br />
"Get close." Grelin said, stepping between Rocsalt and Camille, as Talvarien grabbed his dropped bow and ran to them. The druid began chanting.<br />
<br />
Quarken collapsed to the floor, hands pressed to his lap. He looked like he was about to be ill. At this point the shocked Promethians had come out of their daze at seeing Rocsalt wipe the bar with their second assist, and were angrily moving in on the intruders in their bar. <br />
<br />
But, with a flash of green light, the four were gone. <br />
<br />
<br />
   ***   ***   ***<br />
<br />
<br />
West Commonlands druid portal.<br />
<br />
"Nice lift, Grelin, I thought we were the next assist call." Talvarien commented.<br />
<br />
"Messy." Grelin said, brow furled.<br />
<br />
"Thanks, Roc." Camille said, hugging the monk. "Your timing was perfect."<br />
<br />
Rocsalt returned the hug stiffly. It was obvious he wasn't used to being hugged. "I was surprised to see you there."<br />
<br />
"That goes both way, man." Talvarien said, "There we are getting pushed around by Rallos Zek Jr., and suddenly powpowpowpow! The Roc is tossing him all over the place!"<br />
<br />
"You were applying to Promethian Order?" Camille asked, curious.<br />
<br />
"When Razor fell, me and Logik holed up for a while in the planes. Did a lot of Halls of Honor. Didn't see many people." Rocsalt replied. "But a few days ago I got the itch to raid again, so I started putting out feelers. Did some time with Appotus Dominus, Triality, Eternal Advocates. Just to see. Promethian Order was on the list."<br />
<br />
"Let's head back to the guildhouse." Camille said, "You can tell us about where you've been over dinner."<br />
<br />
"Aye, I toss a mean salad!" Talvarien added. "I toss it up down, across the room, Roc style, powpowpowpow!"<br />
<br />
"And...?" Grelin interjected, looking at Camille with a raised eyebrow.<br />
<br />
"And....I can fill you in on what I learned from Kat." Camille continued. The thought of the conversation darkened her mood.<br />
<br />
They began to walk east back to Freeport, crossing into East Commonlands.<br />
<br />
"Soooo, speaking of Logik," Talvarien said, referring Rocsalt's usual constant companion, Logiktue, one of Razor's barbarian shaman and chief alchemist. "How is ole One Eye?"<br />
<br />
"Dead." Rocsalt said emotionlessly.<br />
<br />
Camille, Talvarien and Grelin stopped short in their tracks, but Rocsalt continued to walk, oblivious to their halt. After an awkward pause, the three caught up to him.<br />
<br />
"I'm sorry, Roc." Camille said softly, touching his arm. "I know you were like brothers..."<br />
<br />
"Was my fault." Rocsalt said stonily, eyes ahead. "I was pulling the whitesuits in the southeast corner of Hall of Honorl you've heard of them, these animated white suits of armor. And we had been doing it over and over, day after day, clearing that area. You know me, I bore easy."<br />
<br />
Camille knew. Rocsalt had always lived for stimulation, whether it be on the battlefield or behind a chessboard, where she remembered leaving River and the monk for hours at a time while they matched wits.<br />
<br />
"I started pulling sloppy, to keep us awake. Logik and I were of same mind, we needed a challenge. I stopped pulling singles and began with double, letting Logik root park the add."<br />
<br />
Past the East Commons tunnel they walked, ignoring the distant figure of Sergeant Slate chasing a dark elf into the woods.<br />
<br />
"Then, I overpulled." Rocsalt said, glancing briefly at Camille. River had been a puller, too. He knew she would understand what that meant. "I brought eight, damned impressive train, but I knew too much for a shaman and a monk to handle. So I feigned it off. But Logik, he was on autopilot, heard the pull call and stepped out from behind the pillar we camped at to root the add." Roc paused a moment, letting that image hold. "Cept it wasn't one add, it was seven. And there I am laying on the ground, thinking they are going back to their posts, and they're ripping my best friend to pieces. Logik's dog starts barking, and that's when I realize something is wrong. Normally Fang doesn't make a sound on the pull, he's been with us ever since we started hunting together. And then, I hear Fang yelp, and nothing. I got up, and ran back, but...too late. Logik was...a mess. Fang was dead. And so was I, if I didn't immediately feign."<br />
<br />
"You couldn't get a cleric over there to rezz?" Talvarien asked, upset. Logik and he had been friends for a long time. Hell, he knew Logik longer than even Roc...had introduced them.<br />
<br />
"I was the first thing on my mind." Roc said, as they crossed into West Freeport. "But the damned suits camped us. I couldn't get up. Everytime I did, they would be all over me. It took every discipline I had to keep me still on the ground, while time ticked down." Finally he stopped his brisk pace, and looked at them each, taking in Talvarien's striken look, Grelin's open stare and the tear trickling unnoticed down Camille's face.<br />
<br />
"I would have taken his death in his place if I could have. By the time the suits finally moved away and let me go, it was already too late for a resurrection. Logik's spirit had moved on. I took his remains and Fang's out to the Plane of Tranquility and burned them on a raft I set afloat. And then I disappeared for a while. Did a lot of exploring, on Luclin, and Kunark. Reckless stuff. I think I was trying to kill myself. Then I decided it was time to get on with my life. Logik would have called me an ass to die for him after he was already dead. So, I started shopping for other guilds."<br />
<br />
"Sorry." Grelin said to Rocsalt sadly.<br />
<br />
"So am I, Grelin." Rocsalt said. "So am I."<br />
<br />
"Roc, I know you think it's your fault," Camille said gently, "But you are a damned good puller. River used to call you the best. And accidents happen..."<br />
<br />
Roc smiled ruefully. "You know, that's funny." he said. "All my life I trained to be the best damned puller there was. And I was. Monks I didn't even know would ask me to explain techniques and show them my skill. And you know what I realized, after I spent enough time alone to figure it out?" He waited.<br />
<br />
"What?" Camille asked.<br />
<br />
"That it's all luck." Rocsalt said, self-loathing in his eyes. Camille reached out and squeezed his arm. "It's all... just... luck."<br />
<br />
And without another word, the four made their way to the guildhouse.</font></p>

	<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" >"This place hasn't changed," Rocsalt remarked, settling down in his old chair at the chessboard. Camille took a seat opposite him in River's old chair. Talvarien and Grelin were still outside foraging up some vegetables from the garden.<br />
<br />
Roc was staring at the chessboard. The pieces had dust gathered on them, the black horsemen and pikemen almost as white as the opposing pieces. They were scattered across the board, not lined up neat they way they would at the beginning of a game.<br />
<br />
"You never cleaned this up." Roc commented, gesturing to the game. Camille just shook her head. "See this?" Roc continued, pointing to the white Lady piece. He reached out and slid it diagonally across the white squares, cleaning a straight line behind the piece through the dust as he did. He brought it to rest five squares away. Then he reached out and tipped the black King onto its side. It hit the marble board with a clunk. Roc leaned back.<br />
<br />
"Checkmate." Roc said quietly. "I had him that night, if he didn't go to Velks..."<br />
<br />
"I wish you had won." Camille answered, staring at the Black king on its side. The king regarded her mutely from its fallen spot on the game board, crown still on its head, but beaten, on its side, its time and place in the game over. Game over.<br />
<br />
Roc laughed suddenly. "Damned River. You know what Logik used to hate? We'd be in Western Waste, and I'd be pulling in one of the big lizards, and as soon as I would come up over that last snowbank River would turn to them on that horse of his and bark 'If you aren't STANDING when the dragon comes, you have effectively pinned a sign to your forehead that says EAT ME'...boy, Logik used to get so insulted with that, like Riv thought we were all noobs working the front of Crushbone."<br />
<br />
Camille smiled at Roc's imitation. "He just wanted to make sure everyone got home alive."<br />
<br />
"Aye, I tried to explain that to Logik, that he wanted to make sure no one was sleeping, but you know Logik, you can take the barbarian out of Halas, but you can't take the Halas out of the barbarian."<br />
<br />
"Well, River certainly has found ways even in death of keeping me from sleeping..." she commented, but then noticed Rocsalt's eyes had drifted to the corner. Two large bowls sat in the corner, handlettered. The one on the right spelled out some letters in iksar and then, in common underneath, 'Warmblood', Zullie's wolf's feed dish. And the other, written in oversized lettering and an inexperienced hand, simply said 'Fang'.<br />
<br />
"When do we stop mourning the dead?" Camille asked sadly.<br />
<br />
"When we join them." Rocsalt replied. And then he burst out into a fit of coughing.<br />
<br />
"Are you alright?" Camille asked, startled. She had dealt with coughs before, River was always coughing to wake the dead after strenuous raids, with the way he smoked, but this was deeper, harsher.<br />
<br />
"Aye," Roc said, waving her off as she stood. He got his cough under control. "Something I picked up in Luclin while I ran around. A weird mushroom exploded in my face and I got a breathful of spores or something..."<br />
<br />
"Sorry no mushrooms." Talvarien said, coming in with Grelin, both carrying a small bushel each of fresh vegetables. But I did get celery, onions, lots and lots of lettuce, radishes, carrots...."<br />
<br />
"Tomatoes." Grelin added, wetting his lips.<br />
<br />
"Ugh, yeah tomatoes." Talvarien said, pulling down a large bowl and emptying the bushel onto the counter. "I hate tomatoes. Ok ok, the tomato is Quarken." He rolled it out into the pile of lettuce. "And Roc, you are the lettuce, and these here are the rest of the bar and GET HIM ROC DON'T LET HIM GET US!" Talvarien started tossing everything rapidly into the bowl and the shook the bowl furiously. "TOSS HIM ROC! TOSS HIM!" Camille just shook her head with a smile. Roc stared openly at the deranged ranger. "Oh nooooo!" Talv cried, as a piece of lettuce flew out of the bowl. "The Roc is out of the ring! Don't worry Roc, Talv the Knife will get him!" He began chopping furiously at the tomato with a parring knife. "Die tomato! Talv the Knife will slice you up with dual epics! A TOMATO IS SLOWED WITH RANJA POWER!"<br />
<br />
Grelin watched Talv's antics with a grin on his face. "Crazy." he said.<br />
<br />
"Shhh, you." Talvarien said, still slicing the tomato. "You're a carrot. Since when do carrots talk?"<br />
<br />
Camille motioned Roc over to the counter. "When you're done tanking dinner," she said to Talv, "I should fill Roc in on what's been going on around here and tell you what I found out."<br />
<br />
"Oh yeah." Talv said, slowing down his chopping. "Ranja.... down...." he said with a gasp. Then he pointed to the tomato. "You may have won today, Tomato, but....I'll be back."<br />
<br />
And then Camille began with her first dream and caught them up to Katarin's story, a twinge of guilt at so soon breaking her promise to the bard, but trusting the three as she would her own husband. And the night went on, Talvarien's half-tossed salad forgotten.</font></p>

	<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" >"Cami?" Talvarien asked after Camille finished her story.<br />
<br />
"Hmm?" she replied.<br />
<br />
"Are you going to preface every meal by making me sick to my stomach?" he asked. "That has to be the most disturbing thing I've heard since I compared my armor class to a pure caster's." Then after a pause, "Scratch that, I forgot about the manginas."<br />
<br />
Grelin was lost in thought, having sunk to his haunches when Camille began Katarin's recount and not having moved since. Roc was contemplating what she had told him, from start to finish, stroking his chin thoughtfully.<br />
<br />
"Well," Roc said after a moment. "That explains why Promethian cancelled its raids. So what have we got here, when you bring all of this together?" He started ticking down facts on his fingers. "One, Promethian Order hits Terris, and finds a statue of River there. One they think was stolen from River's memorial, but it isn't; no statue was ever made, that you know of." Camille nodded.<br />
<br />
"Two," he continued. "Akethadar, being Akethadar, has the statue brought back to his guildhouse, and begins using it as a punching bag. I knew Ake's capabilities as a monk, he was top class. That thing should have been reduced to gravel. But it didn't break. The statue's creator, whomever it was, used something beyond normal rock to form it. Ake flipping out on the statue is a little wacky, but nothing unusual, given Akethadar and Riverdane's crappy past."<br />
<br />
"No love, all hate." Talvarien chimed in.<br />
<br />
"Three." Roc said, and then again with that whooping cough. They waited. "Three. Promethian Order invades Grieg's End, the old castle of Grieg the Geomancer. Greig should be dead long ago and it should just be them getting past those crazy traps and looting the place, but Grieg is ALIVE somehow, and gets alone with Akethadar before they actually kill him. They clean the place out, except for some blue gem, and leave.<br />
<br />
"Four, I'm running out of fingers here. Four. Ake loses his mind completely, even by Ake standards, and has Tremas port the statue to Luclin, and, I may add, the Dawnshroud port, close to Grieg's castle. These funky guys in black scarves drag away the statue. Tremas's magic doesn't work, and they have to run away to actually get off the moon. Akethadar finally loses it completely, and raiding in Promethian grinds to a halt."<br />
<br />
"Dreams..." Grelin adds suddenly from his spot near the ground.<br />
<br />
"Ah, yes," Roc says, tapping his thumb. "Five, all of this oddly correlates to Camille's recent nightmares. The statue of River, the actual battle against Terris by Promethian, the whole 'Free' thing. I bet a sack of plat that Camille's details of that fight match exactly, down the dead druid and switching of opening tactics. And I'll bet that evil voice, the 'free' voice, was Grieg. But the rest? River's 'Avenge' and whatnot? And those glowing rocks the scarved guys were burying on the moon? No idea. Maybe River speaking was just Camille's head talking for River, I don't know. And that business on the moon is beyond me. And why exactly Camille is picking up these images I'm clueless. We live in odd times, Cami. The dead do indeed walk, just take a look at Befallen and the Estate of Unrest. Perhaps you are the victim of a haunting. River was stubborn enough in life, I'd expect him worse in death." Camille just frowned, taking that in.<br />
<br />
"And now," Roc said, standing up and stretching out. "I'd like to eat. I'm hungry as hells."<br />
<br />
"Well, YOU can toss the salad." Talvarien said. "Once she got to the 'Akethadar gouged his eyes out' part, only thing I want to toss is my breakfast."<br />
<br />
"I got it." Grelin said, standing up and moving to the salad.<br />
<br />
"I'm with Talv," Camille remarked. "I've lost my appetite for the night. I think I'm going to head to bed early and think about all this."<br />
<br />
"Night Cami." Talvarien waved, starting to kindle a fire at the fireplace.<br />
<br />
"Night, girl." Rocsalt said, moving over to the larder and taking out some bread. "Where the hells do you people keep the butter?"<br />
<br />
"Night." Grelin called over his shoulder, generously adding two more tomatoes to the salad.<br />
<br />
"Night." Camille said absently, and disappeared in the direction of her room.</font></p>

Then....blue light.....blinding, electric blue, shining like a blue sun, so bright Camille has to raise her hand to her eyes.<br />
<br />
Slowly the light dims, shrinks...takes form...a gem, a blue gemstone, the size of her fist, beautifully cut, laying on a pillow of black velvet. She reaches out, picking the gem up from its bed.<br />
<br />
Something is moving in the gem.<br />
<br />
A dark spot inside the gem, moving. Intrigued, she brings the gem close to her face, peering inside to see what it is, uneasiness not quelling the curiosity that has risen in her.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, with a small thump, a figure inside the gem slams up against the edge, face and fists pressed up darkly against the crystal walls. Riverdane, tiny, but recognizable, banging again and again on the walls of the gem, eyes wild and staring right through her.<br />
<br />
"VEN...!" he begins to scream, and is drowned out, as Camille, horrified, joins with him, and the sound of her shrieks the only thing left that she hears.</font></p>

	<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" >She waked as if cold water had been thrown on her, the sound of her scream continuing on faintly in the night, hands twisting the bedsheet into a torn clump. After a breathless pause, she realized it wasn't the echo of her scream she heard; that was only in the dream. Thankfully for the rest of the house, it had never reached her lips. But there was a high pitched noise coming from outside.<br />
<br />
Still in her white nightdress, she climbed out of her bed and went to the window. Still night, and dark. She was wide awake, the nightmare having dissipated any fog of sleep that may have still clung to her. Luclin was nothing more than a crescent, as she looked out the window towards the source of the shrill wail. The stables. Brimstone was awake and agitated inside.<br />
<br />
Without bothering to get a robe, she made her way barefoot down the halls and outside. Normally she would have approached the horse in full armor, considering the hellion he had become. But the whinnies seemed urgent, frightened, and to lose time while dressing for battle would have taken too long. She did, however, grab River's sword, Reaver, from the wall. The steel glinted slightly in the little moonlight the quarter moon afforded as she made her way across the grass to the stable.<br />
<br />
Unlocking the stable doors quickly, she entered the stables, Reaver gripped in one hand tightly. Brimstone neighed loudly as she slipped inside, but did not do its custom lunge at her, to her relief. Instead it just danced back.<br />
<br />
"What's wrong?" she asked the horse, half expecting it to answer. No answer except it dancing nervously. She reached out a hand tentatively towards the trembling horse, ready to pull back if it tried to bite like it usually did. But not tonight. Closer she drew.<br />
<br />
Contact, finally, after a year. She touched her hand to Brimstone's mane.<br />
<br />
Hot. She had forgotten after a year how unnaturally warm the horse's bodyheat was. She ran her hand through its mane as its prancing slowed and stopped. It snorted once and was still under her caress.<br />
<br />
"What, you crazy horse?" she repeated, brushing her hand through its mane. It moved closer to her, lowering its head under her moving fingers. Slowly it nuzzled against her arm. After all that time fighting the horse, she felt like crying. It was finally accepting her.<br />
<br />
She found herself swinging up onto its back before she registered she was doing it. No saddle, reins, anything, just climbed up on a stool, sword still in hand, and onto the stallion's back. She ran her hand again through its mane, surprised she had made that bold a move, but everything seemed controlled.<br />
<br />
"Now, you want to canter out and...." she began.<br />
<br />
Then, clearly, in her mind, she clearly heard the thoughts of the horse, as if it had spoken out loud in common.<br />
<br />
--NOW, HUMAN. LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN RIDE.--<br />
<br />
And with a snort of fire from its nostrils, Brimstone bolted out of the stable, Camille still in her nightgown, one hand grasping Reaver, the other in a deathgrip on the horse's mane, as they charged into the dark night.</font></p>

<br />
"Hands where I can see them!" Sergeant Slate barked, levelling his crossbow at the dark elf as he attempted to slip across East Commons to the Nektulos border. The elf cursed his luck and lifted his hands high in the air.<br />
<br />
"I'm just trying to get home." the teir'dal said in broken common. "I wasn't disturbing anyth..."<br />
<br />
"Well, today's your lucky day." Slate said smugly, "Because I'm in a good mood. Safe passage across the commons will only cost you what you have in your pockets." The dark elf cursed quietly in his native tongue. "Andddd," Slate continued, "I don't know what you just called me, you piece of trash, but that will cost you your boots as well. Now, off with them!"<br />
<br />
The dark elf decided silence was the best answer, and began to bend down to unlace his boots, when the sound of pounding hooves reached his ears. Both he and Slate turned in the direction of the noise.<br />
<br />
Bearing down on them, like a roaring river, came a black horse, flames flying out from its hooves as it thundered across the path. On its back was a beautiful woman with golden hair, gripping onto the horse's mane, bearing a dangerous toothedged sword. She rode with no saddle, knees up near the horses shoulders, squeezing the horse tight as she held on. She was dressed in a slight white dress, barefoot. They were a vision of Rallos' warrior riders, death incarnate riding in the moonlight. Slate gaped as she passed by without even glancing at them.<br />
<br />
"What in hells..." he murmured, as she passed him at a speed unlike any gallop he had ever witnessed. But just like that, the horse and rider were gone, marked only by a cloud of dust behind them.<br />
<br />
Slate blinked and turned back to his prisoner. "Did you see tha..."<br />
<br />
But the darkelf was gone.<br />
<br />
And onward they rode....<br />
<br />
In West Commons, Guards Valon and Colin played checkers inside the small hut attached to the toll booth. It was how every night usually ended since they pissed off Sir Lucan and wound up with one of the crappiest details of the Freeport Militia. At that time of night, the toll road got very little traffic. So on they went, jump jump jump with the game, until the sound of hooves hitting the paved road reached their ears.<br />
<br />
"Someone riding this late at night?" Colin asked, eyebrow raised.<br />
<br />
"I'll get it." Valon offered. "And I know where the pieces are, Colin, so don't think of cheating me." And out he went.<br />
<br />
The figure was still a bit in the distance, a lone person on horseback, moving toward the tollbooth with alarming speed.<br />
<br />
"Halt, in the name of the Freeport Militia. Use of this road is regulated to a toll." he called out, as usual.<br />
<br />
The rider showed no sign of slowing.<br />
<br />
"Halt! In the name of the Freeport Militia!" he called louder. Colin, hearing Valon repeat himself, came out to gape at the rider, who was not reining in the horse even in the slightest.<br />
<br />
"He said Halt, in the name of the..." Colin yelled out.<br />
<br />
"HALT! IN THE NAME OF...!" Valon screamed, waving his arms back and forth as the two stood in amazement as the horse bore down on them. Now it was close enough to see the flames licking the hooves of the horse, the fire shooting from its nostrils, the red hellfire in its eyes, and the wicked sword held by its ghostly rider.<br />
<br />
"Mother of Rallos..." Colin murmured, as his legs buckled. "LOOK OUT!"<br />
<br />
But Valon was moving without the warning. Colin dived left, Valon right, as the horse hit the toll gate full across its broad chest. It didn't even lose one step. The board that made the gate snapped off its swing, splintering and flipping a good distance away, almost taking off Colin's head as it sailed over him. Valon was getting to his feet, watching the rider disappear to a tiny dot in the distance.<br />
<br />
"Lucan is going to be...upset." Colin mentioned, looking at the destroyed toll gate.<br />
<br />
And onward they rode....<br />
<br />
"Do the Shralok orcs know what to do?" General V'Ghera asked, without looking up from his map of Highpass Hold as he scoured his papers in the burnt out cabin that posed as his headquarters in the Kithicor Forest. Luclin's sparce light would make the maps hard to read for a human, but the General's teir'dal eyes picked out every detail clearly.<br />
<br />
"Aye," Advisor C'zatl answered, nodding in the darkness. "On my order they'll meet with the orcs in the pass and sweep past the Keep, drawing the front guards to the west, and we'll be able to move in from the east."<br />
<br />
"Good good." V'Ghera murmured. "And the Pickclaw goblins?"<br />
<br />
"Ready to rise up and move into the upper Keep on my call." War Priestess T'zan said, licking her lips absently.<br />
<br />
"Q'ioul, the asslings...will they assist if they get word? Or...?"<br />
<br />
"All asleep in Rivervale, after a little taste of tainted jumjum." Coercer Q'ioul smiled. "Should we hit them after, take the halfling city?"<br />
<br />
General V'ghera regarded her for a moment, and then a smile broke across his dark face. "But...why?" he asked. And laughed nastily, as his entourage joined in heartily. Why indeed would anyone want to occupy Rivervale....<br />
<br />
"Sir?" Adjutant D'kan said suddenly, listening. "Do you hear somethi..."<br />
<br />
Suddenly, sweeping through their midst, a black stallion bearing a blonde rider charged through their midst, papers scattering with the wind from their passage. One of the horse's flaming hooves came down on the maps, and fire greedily began to consume them. And then, they were gone as fast as they came.<br />
<br />
General V'ghera stared after the horse and rider, as Adjutant D'kan stomped on the burning maps, putting out the flames.<br />
<br />
And onward they rode...<br />
<br />
"Rider in the pass!" came the frantic shout. Captain Orben ran from his post on the west watch, and peered over the wall high above the lower pass. He arrived just in time to see the back flanks of a horse disappear around a corner, and a wisp of golden hair.<br />
<br />
He frowned. "This bodes ill." he said to Renlor, one of the volunteers who watched the pass with the guards. "Send word through the Pass to double the security at the east and west entrances. Something odd is in the air tonight."<br />
<br />
Volunteer Renlor nodded briefly and was gone, while Captain Orben lit his pipe distractedly, eyes intent on the west pass. <br />
<br />
And onward they rode....<br />
<br />
Down the long twisting road from Highpass, Brimstone dangerously close to the edge, Camille's fingers feeling permanently twisted into a grip, as she squeezed her aching legs to the horse's neck and tried to stay balanced with one hand holding Reaver. She would jump off the speeding horse to her death before losing her husband's sword on what was becoming a nightmare journey across Antonica. Her body screamed in protest with each jarring step, while Brimstone dragged her unwillingly across the rushing landscape.<br />
<br />
Across East Karana they galloped, toward the wooden bridge that crossed the river into North Karana. Broon blinked his one cyclopean eye in disbelief as the firey horse and scantily clad rider flew by him like an arrow.<br />
<br />
Into North Karana, past the gypsy camp and guard tower, faster, faster, grffins steering clear of the rider as she was rushed across the plains, leaving small clumps of burning brush behind her, where the horse's hooves would find dry grass and set it alight.<br />
<br />
Then a straight shot across Western Karana, the horse's speed, unslowed from lack of turns, picked up so that the bandits hiding along the road only saw a streak of gold as she passed. One fired an arrow at their passage, but the arrow fell short far behind the rushing horse.<br />
<br />
Into Qeynos Hills, and a turn towards the city itself. Camille almost slipping from the horse's back as it turned suddenly. Only by leaning into the curve and swinging her sword arm straight back was she able to regain balance.<br />
<br />
Then up the cobblestone road to Qeynos.<br />
<br />
"Yapyapyapyap!" Fippy Darkpaw yelped, running ahead of them, charging towards the Qeynos gate, small gnoll brain oblivious that death was coming up the road behind him. "I claim Qeynos in the name of the Gn..."<br />
<br />
And then, in a mix of flaming hooves, burning gnoll hair, and broken bones, Fippy is run down by the horse and broken into a sad lump of twitching muscle on the road.<br />
<br />
"...olls." he finished lamely, the last of his breath leaving him with a deathrattle.<br />
<br />
Guards scattered as Camille and the horse plunged into their midst, taking corners at neckbreaking speed, Camille gripped Brimstone's mane so frantically she was surprised she hadn't torn the hair out of the horse's neck. Past big clock, the temple, the bank, to the docks they rode. The boat was in port, and Brimstone without care plunged up the ramp, crossing the boat, while passengers dove out of their way, some into the icy waters below, to avoid being trampled. The other side of the boat loomed quickly in front of them.<br />
<br />
"Brimstone..." Camille warned, knowing the crazy horse would ignore her. And it did, coming fast on the wooden railing on the far side of the boat, Brimstone bunched his muscles and leapt up and over the rail.<br />
<br />
I'll see you soon, River...Camille thought, closing her eyes as the sea rushed up toward her.<br />
<br />
Nothing. No jarring crash as they plunged into the sea, no cold icy grip as the water surrounded her, no gasp for breath as the ocean swallowed horse and rider.<br />
<br />
She opened her eyes slowly.<br />
<br />
They were galloping across the waves, white foam a foot under the horse's burning hooves, rushing across the water.<br />
<br />
"Where are you taking me??" Camille screamed over the roar of the sea.<br />
<br />
--VERY GOOD.-- Brimstone thought clearly to her, --I THOUGHT FOR SURE I WOULD LOSE YOU TURNING INTO THE CITY.--<br />
<br />
"Please, Brimstone," she begged, "I have had enough..."<br />
<br />
~~indeed, she has had enough~~ floated down an eerie female voice. ~~had i known you were going to attempt to kill her, i would have sent another more obedient servant~your time with the mortals has made you as bloodthirsty as they~~<br />
<br />
Brimstone's ears lay flat back against its head as the horse was chided, and the gallop reduced to a trot. Camille was afraid to untense her muscles, for fear she would fall off and pass out.<br />
<br />
~~to me, horse, and gently~~<br />
<br />
Brimstone neighed once. --YES, MISTRESS.--<br />
<br />
And with a shimmer of light, horse and rider disappeared.</font></p>

	<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" >Camille's eyes, even before they pierced the gloom, knew where she was.<br />
<br />
The lair of Terris Thule.<br />
<br />
Terris still lay on the ground where Camille had seen her last, dress shredded around her, soaked in caked blood. Most of the puddles of blood had reduced themselves to dry dark stains on the floor. Terris' wounds were all gone, without a scar, but she did not move.<br />
<br />
~~dismount~~ came that disembodied voice, but now with some direction. It was coming from Terris herself.<br />
<br />
Camille, for the first time since the insane journey had begun, loosened her leg muscles and released her grip on Brimstone's mane. She half slid, half fell off the horse, exhausted, every sinew screaming. She landed uneasily on her feet, and then just slid abruptly to the ground, panting. She feared she would never walk again.<br />
<br />
Slowly, painstakingly, Terris rolled over, without a sound of rustled cloth, to lay on her side and yet look upon Camille. The goddess' breast heaved as her nostrils flared out and in, taking in air. Her huge dark eyes scrutinized the sprawled out paladin, dressed only in her sleeping gown, still clutching her husband's sword.<br />
<br />
For a long time they just contemplated each other silently.<br />
<br />
~~you are a strong woman, to have survived that~~<br />
<br />
"So are you," Camille remarked, looking at the dark stains on the ground.<br />
<br />
~~i am a goddess, i will never truly die, until the day mortals finally succeed in their little dream of conquest, and kill us all in the plane of time ~ then they can see how they like a world with no gods ~ akethadar and his dogs did not kill me, just my avatar, and slowly, over time i will be whole again ~ and then i suppose they will be back, as mortals always are ~ although i imagine akethadar will not be leading the next set, no no~~ and the sound of a chuckle that chilled Camille.<br />
<br />
"Did you drive Akethadar mad?" Camille asked bluntly.<br />
<br />
~~me?~~ Terris asked, actually surprised, ~~i wouldn't touch that man's mind even if the nameless commanded me to ~ no, camille wyldechylde, the only mind i have touched in quite a while has been yours~~<br />
<br />
"The dreams. You sent them to me."<br />
<br />
~~yes ~ garbled at first as i was weak, very weak ~ later stronger ones, and finally, the will to have the horse bring you here~~<br />
<br />
"If you didn't read Akethadar's mind, why the statue of River?" Camille asked, so many questions bouncing around in her mind. "How would you know?"<br />
<br />
~~ah, the statue~~ Terris said, ~~it was here for the last year ~ where did you think your husband's soul went, to innoruuk? ~ in the end he chose me to worship~~<br />
<br />
"I see." Camille said shortly, hurt in some undescribable way, unable to stop a pang of jealousy from striking her heart. Terris picked up on it.<br />
<br />
~~ah, you mistake the term worship, mithaniel's handmaiden ~ when faced with which plane his soul would reside in, he chose me, for whatever effect our business with end game had had on him ~ but, from the state of his dreams when he was here, he dreamed of you ~ only you~~<br />
<br />
Camille didn't know whether Terris had said that to appease her or was speaking the truth, but the words acted as a salve for her pained heart. But still her question was unanswered.<br />
<br />
"So you erected a statue of him here?" Camille asked, confused.<br />
<br />
~~no~~ Terris replied, ~~that was no statue of any rock known to man ~ that was a soulcasing, my own creation ~ you saw my gargoyles, they are of the same stone~~<br />
<br />
"Soulcasing." Camille said blankly.<br />
<br />
~~yes, my other four worshipers, yes, only four, were all demons, and thus their likenesses as grotesque ~ the soulcasing can hold the living soul that exists after the body dies~~<br />
<br />
"So when River died," Camille said, hope lighting her face as stared at Terris. "He did not die?"<br />
<br />
~~yes, and no~~ Terris said. ~~the soul if preserved will never truly die, so while his time among mortals was done, he lived on dreaming in the soulcasing i provided for him ~ in times of dire stress, i wake the dreamers to protect me, but river ~~~ would not ~ you saw that~<br />
<br />
"I saw." Camille replied, recalling the dream.<br />
<br />
~~he suspected that i would eventually survive the attack, while promethian would not ~ even against his sworn enemy he would not attack with the strength the soulcasing would have lended him~~<br />
<br />
"River didn't hate Akethadar." Camille said.<br />
<br />
~~but akethadar hated him ~ oh how he hated him ~ and grieg saw that, saw the statue in akethadar's mind, even as he died, and jumped on it~~<br />
<br />
"Grieg." Camille said, seizing upon the name to change subjects to more of her questions. "Where does he fit into this?"<br />
<br />
~~grieg veneficus was a brilliant geomancer, the top of his class ~ long ago his studies with the magic inherant in stone and earth allowed for travel to luclin, where he brought the combine ~ when he failed to discover a route back in timely fashion, however, he was spurned, and forced into his castle to discover a route back ~ but luclin the deity was enjoying the new additions to her little world, and drove grieg mad in his home, and set up clever mind-altering guardians to guard both him ever leaving his castle and anyone entering ~ the insanity also had the unusual side effect of keeping him alive long after he should have died, as his body rotted and changed into a blobbish purple mass ~ grieg festered like an open wound in his home while others finally found a way to open a two way portal to the moon, and was forgotten ~ but he never forgot the outside world, or the wrongs they had suffered upon him~~<br />
<br />
Slowly Terris propped herself up into a sitting position, and continued.<br />
<br />
~~over the years of his imprisonment, grieg had still worked on his experiments, but now for his own dark purpose ~ one of these was the creation of a blue gem that he called the geomancer's stone ~ the gem was part prison, part battery~~<br />
<br />
"I don't understand." Camille cut in.<br />
<br />
~~patience, mithaniel's handmaiden~~ Terris shhed her, then went on as Camille fell silent, more questions dying on her lips. ~~the geomancer's stone could act as a housing for a soul without a soulcasing, to preserve the soul, very similiar to what the statue of riverdane could do ~ and once a soul was inside it, could be used as a power source for mechanical devices, drawing on the lifeforce of the soul within, consuming it as it magnified that lifeforce to energy many many times the size of the actual soul ~ eventually, the soul would be snuffed out, but the power output would be astronomical~~<br />
<br />
"My dreams." Camille said, face pale, "River....is in that gem."<br />
<br />
~~yes~~ Terris confirmed. ~~when akethadar killed grieg, grieg tapped his mind and saw the statue, and knowing more about stone than any other living man, knew the soulcasing for what it was ~ he planted the seed of insanity into akethadar's brain, like a parasite, and then escaped with his own soul into the geomancer's stone, and waited ~ waited for akethadar's mind to be eaten away, and to answer the hypnotic order greig had placed in him ~ to deliver the statue to the moon ~ grieg's servants, local natives whom grieg's magic had bound and twisted, recovered the statue and brought it to the geomancer's stone, where grieg, powered with insanity and taking riverdane quite by surprise, forced riverdane's soul out of the soulcasing and took his place ~ river, having no other place to go, slipped into the geomancer's stone~<br />
<br />
"River..." Camille said helplessly.<br />
<br />
~~is trapped~~ Terris continued. ~~now grieg has a form that can move and is nearly indestructable in one on one combat ~ and riverdane is trapped in the geomancer's stone, unable to leave, with nowhere to go ~ and freedom is not the only thing grieg wanted ~ he is currently working on another experiment, and i suspect he intends to use river's soul to power it ~ grieg's mind is too twisted to read, and he does not dream, not for even a second ~ the insanity luclin placed on him ate any capacity he had for dreams ~ so i do not know what the madman is planning to do, only that river's soul is in great peril, and knowing grieg's insanity, so are a great many more~~<br />
<br />
"River was trying to tell me something. YOU were trying to tell me something!" Camille exclaimed, panic in her tone. "What does 'Avenge' have to do with this? Avenge River? You?"<br />
<br />
Terris stared blankly at her. ~~avenge?~~<br />
<br />
"Yes!" Camille said with frustration. "In the dream, River said 'Avenge', 'Venge'; you, YOU said 'Venge'!" But Terris just continued to stare at her with no comprehension in her eyes. Then suddenly, Terris' eyes narrowed a moment.<br />
<br />
~~ahh, no, not avenge~~ Terris said. ~~it never fails to amaze me how you mortals hear things and don't hear, twisting things to suit what you think they mean ~ the word i wanted you to hear was vven~~<br />
<br />
"Ven?" Camille asked, confused.<br />
<br />
~~two v's~~ Terris sighed.<br />
<br />
Camille's mouth dropped open, as she began to understand. "Vven? The enchanter that helped River during End Game?"<br />
<br />
~~yes~~<br />
<br />
"How does Vven figure into this at all?" Camille asked, confused again.<br />
<br />
~~when your husband and his companions were here, i opened up his mind, to read his past and his intentions ~ his friends suspected i was also picking through their minds ~ and they were right ~ i remember a fragment from vven of a meeting at some point in his life with grieg, a flash in time, but i remember it ~ enough so for me to believe that vven psyphon may have more information on grieg's intent, even though the teir'dal may not realize it himself ~ seek him, and find answers~~<br />
<br />
"Thank you, Terris." Camille said softly, reaching out to place her palm over the goddess' massive hand. Terris allowed it, an odd look in her eyes at the woman's touch of sisterhood. "Why? Why did you tell me all this?"<br />
<br />
~~you love him~~ Terris said after a pause. ~~a year ago, riverdane wyldechylde helped return my love to me~i am repaying that favor~~ A pause and then, ~~and he was the only mortal other than demons to choose me~~<br />
<br />
Camille nodded, understanding. Then her eyes suddenly brimmed with tears. "And the dreams, River talking to me, holding me....was that really him or...?"<br />
<br />
~~that was me~~ Terris said sadly. ~~trace memories from him lending me script for the dream ~ i am sorry i made you think he was speaking to you~~<br />
<br />
Camille wiped her eyes as that sunk in. Knights don't cry. "Thank you all the same. Even in a nightmare, it helped keep him alive for me."<br />
<br />
~~mount the horse, mithaniel's handmaiden~~ Terris said gently. ~~i promise you safe passage back to your home~~ She laboriously drew herself from her feet, and lifted Camille up like a doll to place her on the back of Brimstone, still clutching River's sword. Then Terris passed her hand in front of Camille's eyes.<br />
<br />
~~sleep~~ Terris intoned, and Camille collapsed weakly against Brimstone's neck, deep in slumber. Terris sent her magic out into the woman to keep her from sliding off.<br />
<br />
~~sleep, camille wyldechylde, and for your lost nights in my nightmares, dream of what you wish~~ Terris commanded the paladin in her nightdress, sword hanging from one limp hand. <br />
<br />
~~bring her safely back to the stables, brimstone~~ Terris said quietly.<br />
<br />
--YES, MISTRESS.-- the horse whinnied, unable to disobey. Terris slumped weakly to her knees, the whole conversation having drained more out of her than she would have preferred.<br />
<br />
~~and fetch rallos to me~~</font></p>

	<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" >Camille Swordswinger, she thought to herself.<br />
<br />
Her nose wrinkled at the thought, as she lifted an armored foot out of the sand and plodded through the featureless desert of North Ro.<br />
<br />
Camille Stunqueen.<br />
<br />
"Eww." she said out loud. "Appropriate but eww...."<br />
<br />
A passing sand scarab clicked on by, and she regarded it for a moment.<br />
<br />
"I need a surname!" she mock plead.<br />
<br />
-clickclickclick- the sand scarab clicked.<br />
<br />
"Camille Clickclick." Camille tried. "Sorry, Mr. Scarab, catchy but no."<br />
<br />
She was nineteen years old, and at the point of her training with the Knights of Truth in North Freeport was reaching the level where she could choose a last name. Easier said than done.<br />
<br />
"I don't want to be Camille Spelldancer all my life." she sighed, marching across the dunes. "I'm not even a caster!"<br />
<br />
True. Her parents were both pure casters, and were secretly, she suspected, horrified that she had decided to become a melee. But for most of her childhood, she had watched the Knights of Truth jousting and training with the look of hero worship in her eyes. And then into her tumulent teens, and the handsome blonde knights with their razor short hair and piercing blue eyes and shining armor. She had giggled like a typical teenage girl with her friends, watching the knights battle in training sessions. But then, when she hit sixteen, she stopped giggling, and started watching closer. Her other friends disappeared, as she began staying at home more, practicing with a stick feints and parries, to the growing distress of her parents. And a year later, on her seventeenth birthday, she marched into the recruiting office of the Knights of Truth and signed on. And her life changed.<br />
<br />
"Camille Bladeweilder." she tried lamely.<br />
<br />
Now she was one of those 'knights in shining armor'. And she learned something, being part of them, training with them. They were just boys, just like the others her age. Immature, some of them mean, some of them stupid. And they all treated her, during the training sessions, like a...well...like a girl.<br />
<br />
"Camille Dlere." she tried. Double ewww. Wouldn't he just LOVE that.<br />
<br />
She quickly tossed away the thought of taking on the surname of one of Freeport's most talented knights, Lucan Dlere. He was excellent in training, but he was so....full of himself. He knew he was good, and didn't let any of the other knights-in-training forget it. And when she and he sparred, he let her win, every time, even though she begged him to make it a fair fight. But he just laughed at her, and would fall onto his rump and plead for mercy. He had it in his head to make her his wife when they were older, that she knew. But ever since he tried to touch her where he shouldn't a year ago at the May Festival, she had avoided him like the plague.<br />
<br />
"Camille Weaponmis...." she began, and then blinked.<br />
<br />
Sand straight ahead.<br />
<br />
Sand to the left.<br />
<br />
Sand to the right.<br />
<br />
Sand behind, and the sun having sunk down to the point where she could not tell where it had been.<br />
<br />
It was growing dark, and there she was, lost somewhere in the middle of North Ro.<br />
<br />
'Oh no..." she whispered, distraught.<br />
<br />
She was lost again.<br />
<br />
Camille had never had a sense for direction, but with the sun to guide her, when the Knights of Truth had impressed upon her a mission to head to the first dervish outpost in North Ro and ascertain if a dark elf was indeed in charge of operations, she had readily set out. And now she was lost, daydreaming the day away and screwing up the first important task the Knights had asked her to perform. She sat down abruptly in the sand, looking helplessly around her, when hot salty tears suddenly found their way to her eyes. Frustration fueled her as she wept.<br />
<br />
"What now, knights don't cry." came a voice from the side, startling her to her feet and surprising her tears to a halt.<br />
<br />
"I wasn't crying!" she lied hastily, examining the young man who stood atop a dune looking down at her.<br />
<br />
He looked like no knight she had ever seen.<br />
<br />
Long black hair, as long as hers, fell across his forehead and down past his shoulder in the back. A straight handsome nose, with the shadow of hair underneath it, unshaven. Lips in an amicable smile, and eyes, eyes so black they seemed to look right through her. Long lashes, almost....pretty, she would wager, made those eyes something to behold. But his armor! No bracers or gauntlets, patchwork leather arms, a chain tunic with some of the links broken, leather boots, tarnished plate leggings, and a dented sheild. The only thing quality in his attire was the Knights of Truth regulation long sword, which was sheathed at his side. She recognized the insignia on the hilt.<br />
<br />
"Ah," he said, eyes taking her in. "Forgive me, miss. Must have been sand blown in your eyes." The fact that there was no wind did not escape Camille, but she took his opportunity for an out.<br />
<br />
"Yes." she said, removing a steel gauntlet and wiping her eyes free of tears. "Who are you?"<br />
<br />
"You can call me River." he said. "And you are...?"<br />
<br />
"Camille." she replied, curiosity in her rising. "You carry a longsword from the Knights of Truth, yet I have never seen you in the guildhouse....River."<br />
<br />
"Ah, this." he said, glancing down at the weaponry. "A gift from my father for my twentieth birthday. Beats the old rusty short sword I used to use."<br />
<br />
"Your father bought it from the Knights for you?" Camille asked with a frown. That was unheard of.<br />
<br />
"No." River said with a laugh. "It was his, before he upgraded. My father is Dane, one of the Knights."<br />
<br />
Camille surpressed a gasp. She had had a childhood crush on Dane that time had erased. But this long-haired ruffian looked nothing like the blonde, blue eyed Dane who did much of the Knights external affairs work.<br />
<br />
"I did not know Dane had a son." she remarked casually.<br />
<br />
"Not many do, my father is a private man." River said. "My mother died in childbirth bringing me into the world, and he has kept to himself since."<br />
<br />
"I'm sorry," Camille said truthfully, but the young man shrugged it off. Then more questions from her.<br />
<br />
"So why have you not applied to the Knights?" she commented. "You could get some real armor and..."<br />
<br />
River laughed suddenly. "I don't think I would make a good Knight." he said. "I make do with what I can buy or find. You don't like my outfit?" And he turned, posing, self mockery on his face. She had to smile. "Anyway, my father trains me at home, and as he upgrades, I'll get some of his old pieces."<br />
<br />
"And what is that bit of dirt under your nose?" she asked coyly, pointing at the unshaven hair above his lip.<br />
<br />
"Oh, that." River said, face going red. "That, my lady, is a moustache, if it ever grows in. My father says with my long hair I am looking more like my mother each day, so I am growing it to stop torturing him. I think he would prefer I cut my hair, but...no chance there."<br />
<br />
"It IS an odd look for a man." she remarked.<br />
<br />
"I'm an odd man." he grinned.<br />
<br />
"Do you have a surname?" she asked suddenly.<br />
<br />
"Aye." he said. And left it at that.<br />
<br />
"You do?" she asked in surprise. "What is it?"<br />
<br />
"Wyldechylde." he said, a little embarassed.<br />
<br />
"Wyldechylde!" she exclaimed. "How...odd."<br />
<br />
"I'm an odd man." River repeated with a selfconscious smile. "My father used to call me that, remarking on my tendency to throw away the rules of combat when we sparred. I took it half as a joke, but....it seemed fitting."<br />
<br />
"Very bold of you, to take a surname with no formal training of a guild." she commented archly.<br />
<br />
"Ho ho!" he laughed. "I have all the training I need, Miss Camille..."<br />
<br />
Camille laughed at him shortly. "Oh really?" she said. "Things your father taught you? I cannot imagine they compare to the vigorous training of the Knights of T..."<br />
<br />
"Spar?" River offered, drawing his sword. Camille's heart raced. She loved to spar.<br />
<br />
"Gladly." she said, drawing her sword. Please don't just let me win, she thought desperately.<br />
<br />
He did not disappoint her.<br />
<br />
Swords locked, their faces close to each other as they pushed toward each other, and the spar began.<br />
<br />
Camille swung each swing, falling into the last two years of training naturally. And she was good, having learned her lessons well. But the young man matched every swing, parrying, feinting, riposting, blocking. They circled around in the sand like two dancers leaping into a delicate, deadly waltz.<br />
<br />
"You're good." she commented breathlessly, dodging as he lunged forward, escaping the tip of his blade.<br />
<br />
"So are you," River panted, ducking as she sliced high. "You ARE holding back, yes, I would hate to bleed all over that shiny armor of yours." And then he swung low, knocking her sword up high.<br />
<br />
Reflexes kicked in, part of her training. Her eyes lit with blue light, and she murmured a short incantation, and a force of air slammed into the young man and stunned him off his feet and onto his rear in the sand. He blinked in surprise, as she swung over her head at him, but he rolled quickly to the side, leaving her sword half buried in the dune.<br />
<br />
"Very nice, very nice!" he remarked, swinging at her side as she brought her sheild between his blade and her armor. It deflected the blow.<br />
<br />
"I'm surprised you haven't tried to stun me yet." she said, circling around him.<br />
<br />
"I can't stun." River said, circling with her, the two of them like cats in an alley.<br />
<br />
"What?" she said in surprise. Block, parry. "Your father has been remiss in his teachings then."<br />
<br />
"He tried." River replied, riposte, dodge. "I can't catch on to it. But there are other ways to stop a caster. Is that sheild of yours for decoration only? You haven't used it except to block."<br />
<br />
"I don't need anything but my stuns." she said confidently, lunge, counter. Blast him, he escaped her blade again.<br />
<br />
"Oh, realllly." he singsonged, slowing his movement. "Alright, Miss Stun. Try to stun me again."<br />
<br />
She stopped moving in circles, and faced him. "Ok." she agreed, eyes lighting blue.<br />
<br />
SMASH. His sheild came up like a weapon, taking her by surprise, and knocked her flat onto her back, spell dissipating as she momentarily forgot the incarnation. Her head swam.<br />
<br />
"Damned, sorry." he said honestly, reaching out a hand to help her up. She groggily accepted, as he began to pull her to her feet.<br />
<br />
With a wrench and a roll back, she yanked him off balance and tossed him over her into the sand. Then leaping to her feet, she turned and swung, but his sheild was up and blocking, even from his prone position on the ground.<br />
<br />
"Haha!" he laughed, "Nice try. Now for a bit of MY magic!" and he said something in a gutteral language, and his eyes lit red. Suddenly Camille felt all the strength drain out of her legs, and she pitched forward, drained, unceremoniously landing between the man's legs across his body.<br />
<br />
"It's ok, I just took some of your strength." he said softly, her faces inches from his as they lay in the sand. "It will come back soon."<br />
<br />
Their eyes locked. Her cheeks flushed red as her whole body grew warm in his half-embrace.<br />
<br />
Suddenly uncomfortably aware of the position they were in, she jumped to her feet, dusting sand off her armor and not looking down at him, sheathed her sword.<br />
<br />
"Draw?" he offered, climbing to his feet.<br />
<br />
"Draw." she said shortly, embarrassed at both losing her balance like that and her body's reaction.<br />
<br />
"What was that spell you cast on me?" she asked suddenly.<br />
<br />
"Drain strength." he said, sheathing his own weapon.<br />
<br />
"Drain strength? I've never seen any of the Knights use that." she said, confused.<br />
<br />
"That's because paladins can't cast it." he said, clearly uncomfortable with where the conversation had led.<br />
<br />
"You mean you are not a paladin?" Camille began, looking at him oddly.<br />
<br />
"Sooo..." he said, changing the subject abruptly. "What brings you to the Desert of Ro this fine evening?"<br />
<br />
The mention of the desert brought her mission screaming home to her. She had almost forgotten it after meeting this strange young man.<br />
<br />
"Oh, I almost forgot!" she exclaimed. "Can you point me in the direction of Derv One?"<br />
<br />
He frowned. "What is a young girl doing crawling around the desert at this time of night looking for Derv One for?"<br />
<br />
"Young KNIGHT." she corrected, miffed at his tone. "And it's guild business.<br />
<br />
"Yes, young knight, forgive me." he said, pointing slowly to her right. "You were close. It's about four dunes in that direction till you will be able to see their campfire, at this time of night. But perhaps I could accompany you to..."<br />
<br />
"No, thank you." she said abruptly, wincing at her tone, but wanting to do this on her own. "As you may have seen, I am more than capable of defending myself. Goodnight, River." And she began marching in the direction he had pointed.<br />
<br />
"Just be careful, milady." he called out after her. "There are strange things afoot in the desert now adays...." but the last of his voice faded away as she marched on.<br />
<br />
He was correct, she was not far off. As she topped the fourth dune she saw the campfire, and upon creeping closer, the three tents surrounding it. An orc was warming his hands at the fire in the cold desert night air, but other than some movement in one of the tents, she could see no other people.<br />
<br />
The dervs were an odd bunch, appearing serveral years ago in the desert of Ro. A nomadic people, other than for a few skirmishes over market prices when they ventured close to Freeport, they generally kept to themselves. But intelligence had caught rumors that a strange darkelf from the Nektulos was travelling from camp to camp, and it was feared that an alliance of some sort was in the works. So the Knights sent out all those they had in training to watch the camps, to see if indeed this dark elf existed, or if it was just a rumor. Her assignment was Derv One, but thus far, she saw no sign of a teir'dal.<br />
<br />
Slowly she crept around the dune, attempting to get a better glimpse at the occupants of the tents.<br />
<br />
"Camille Dunestalker..." she whispered nervously, making her way down the sandy hill.<br />
<br />
The cold steel of a knife to her throat from behind and an iron grip on the back of her neck stopped her dead in her tracks.<br />
<br />
"What's this, a pretty miss?" came a harsh female barbarian voice from behind her. The grip tightened, and Camille's eyes watered in pain. "Let's see yer weapon girlie, nice an' slow, and drop it where Weezer kin git at it." <br />
<br />
The knife at her throat decided it for Camille. She slowly drew her weapon and dropped it to the sand, where a ragged, filthy human, presumably Weezer, scooped it up and pranced, half dancing, toward the tents. The blade was removed from her throat and pressed roughly to her mailed back, and she was given a rough shove from behind.<br />
<br />
"Now march, missy, or I'll skewer ya like a pig, by gods." the woman said, pushing Camille again. Camille slowly made her way towards the tents. As she passed the orc, he looked at her chest hungrily and licked his lips. The orc fell in place behind her.<br />
<br />
The flap to the largest tent was thrown to the side and she was pushed roughly inside. <br />
<br />
There, across from her, eating a leg of mutton, was a teir'dal in full armor, blinking his violet eyes in surprise.<br />
<br />
"Lookit here what I found sneakin' around in the sand, Dorn." the barbarian woman said, pushing Camille forward.<br />
<br />
"Well, a Knight of Truth." the dark elf, Dorn said, appraising her with his eyes like one looks at a bug. "They have been spotted at almost all of the camps poking around. Silly asses think it is wise to spy in full plate mail. Such noisy noisy spies." And then, his appraisal over, he went back to his mutton. "Varissa, strip her out of her armor." Dorn said to the barbarian, and then indicated the orc. "And the give her to Grozz to play with." The orc clapped his hands together and began unbuckling his pants, tongue licking over his lips again. "If there's anything left, toss it to Weezer, is time he became a man. Then we will discuss tomorrow's caravan from Oasis, and how we may relieve Freeport's taxes that are starving your people..."<br />
<br />
Camille's stood still in shock, still feeling the press of the blade to her back, as the orc's pants hit the floor with a jangle of beltstraps. Three opponents, she thought. The armor may buy me some time. Horrible odds, but if I can get a stun off...<br />
<br />
"Put your clothes back on, Grozz, before you catch cold." commanded a strong voice from the entrance. It was the voice of a leader. <br />
<br />
Grozz stood blinking, pants around his ankles. Camille turned to follow his stare.<br />
<br />
There was River standing in the doorway, one hand outside the flap, the other holding his sword drawn.<br />
<br />
Dorn leapt to his feet. "Do not interfere, Riverdane.", he growled.<br />
<br />
"Dorn B'Dynn." he said amiably, but his eyes were not smiling. They were cold, flat, emotionless. "I thought I saw you sneaking around the dunes this afternoon. What brings you crawling out from under your rock in Neriak?"<br />
<br />
Dorn's hand crept toward his sword at his waist. "Business from the Fatherland, human. You may think yourself protected because you bear the Taint, but if you get in my way I will not hesitate to skewer you alive!"<br />
<br />
River laughed. "With what? That piece of mutton?" he chuckled.<br />
<br />
That was enough for Dorn. With a roar, he threw the mutton aside, and drew out his sword.<br />
<br />
"Miss Stun, catch!" River called, bringing his outside hand into the tent. It held Camille's weapon, wet with blood. Seeing River unmarked, she absently realized it must be Weezer's blood. She came out of her daze and caught the weapon midair.<br />
<br />
Varissa violently brought the knife at Camille's back up to her throat again, with the intent to cut her windpipe. But Camille, automatically, without so much thinking as just doing, reversed the sword as she caught it, and drove it back under her arm with both hands. She felt it slide home and then the sudden sticky wet rush of blood onto her hands. The knife at her throat fell uselessly to the ground, as Camille pushed the dying woman off her back and pulled her weapon free of her. Some part of her stomach revolted as she dimmly realized she had slain her first living person in combat, while another more primitive part of her cheered.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Dorn had rushed River, swinging wildly up over his head. River's sheild came up, deflecting the blow, but Dorn spun, countering River's riposte and slipping out the entrance as he danced past. River turned half in the entrance and half out, furiously exchanging blows with Dorn B'Dynn outside.<br />
<br />
Grozz still stood there with his pants around his ankles, at River's back. Then, coming to his senses, he grabbed a long carving knife from Dorn's dinner table and raised it, shuffling over to where River fought. He brought it high, intent on plunging it into River's neck.<br />
<br />
"River!" Camille cried, eyes flashing blue.<br />
<br />
-STUN-<br />
<br />
Grozz stood poised over River, knocked senseless for a moment by the force of Camille's stun, hand still gripping the knife but unable to move.<br />
<br />
Without turning into the tent, Riverdane's hand shot back, locking around Grozz's throat. And then something...peculiar happened. Grozz's eyes bulged as all the color drained out of his face, and then his skin....collapsed, falling in upon itself as Camille watched in shock. Within seconds, nothing but an empty husk remained. River let go and Grozz's empty skin fluttered to the ground like parchment. And then, blocking a swing from Dorn, River disappeared outside as he and B'Dynn battled.<br />
<br />
Camille came out of her surprise and ran from the tent. There to the side was Weezer's body, but his head...was nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, Riverdane and Dorn were locked in mortal combat, Dorn having produced a long parrying knife and dual weilding. River was good, but it was obvious with the way Dorn was handling his weapons that the teir'dal was the superior.<br />
<br />
Without thinking, Camille joined the fray, swinging without a word into the fight. But Dorn was good, damned good, holding Camille off with the parrying knife, as River and he exchanged blows. And then, Dorn's weapon slipped through River's defenses, cutting across the leather armor on his bicep and drawing blood in a thick line. River howled, and spun off, muttering something in a coarse language Camille did not understand.<br />
<br />
And then River's eyes pulsed green.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, in the air, tiny green skulls materialized and began to spin, as green light shot out of River's eyes and pierced Dorn's body. Camille stopped midswing, gaping, panting for air as she stared at the lightshow.<br />
<br />
Dorn dropped his weapons, screaming. But the scream was not one of pain....rather, one of terror. It went right through Camille as he turned, shrieking, and disappeared over the dunes.<br />
<br />
"Dammit!" River growled, touching his fingers to the slice on his arm tenderly.<br />
<br />
"What did you cast on him?" Camille whispered in awe.<br />
<br />
River did not meet her stare. Rather, he began slowly unbuckling the leather and peeling it away from the wound. "Fear. I cast Fear." he said softly.<br />
<br />
"Fear?" she asked, "But I thought necromancers cast fear, but you're...you're no caster." Her head was a jumble of confused questions. "And what did he mean that you have the Taint?"<br />
<br />
River drew his eyes away from his wound, and looked at her squarely.<br />
<br />
"My mother was Eleese of the Commons." he said intensely. Camille gasped involuntarily. Every girl who had ever disobeyed their parents were warned they would end up like Crazy Eleese, Madwoman of West Commons. It was a popular tale to frighten children with, since it was true.<br />
<br />
"I see you have heard of her," River continued, going on. "She was raped by Innoruuk and left for dead. Dane found her and took her in. She gave birth to me. That...is the Taint. I am born of a mad woman and the seed of Innoruuk." He reached out, grabbing her hand, wanting desperately for her to understand. She felt she should recoil, but somehow, could not. "That is why I can never join your Knights of Truth. That is why I can not learn the magic of healing, or stuns, or the rest of the code. I will never be a paladin, Camille. I am a shadowknight, the only thing I could be." He then suddenly brought her hand up to his lips, kissing the back of her hand, and glancing up at her sidelong. "But I'm not that bad." he grinned, and released her hand, starting off for the dunes.<br />
<br />
"Fear doesn't last long, milady!" he called back to her. "I would be off before Dorn returns!" And then, the dunes obscured him from view, while she stood dazed looking out after where he had disappeared.<br />
<br />
"Camille Wyldechylde..." she whispered softly, and then, clearing her head, made her way away from the camp.</font></p>

	<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" >Camille awoke suddenly, body stiff. She blinked twice in surprise, not quite sure where she was. Pale light lit the stable, as she realized she was laying on a pile of hay. My gods, she thought, I slept till dawn. The memory of the dream was quickly escaping her the way dreams do, and she felt a pang of loss as the recollection of her first meeting River slowly faded away. It wasn't without its bad parts, the dream, but when his lips had touched her hand...<br />
<br />
She suddenly realized she was not alone in the stable. Grelin sat on his haunches, a silly grin on his face, watching her. When her eyes met his, he smiled wider, stood, and ran out of the stables. She rose, groaning to her feet. Brimstone was no where to be seen. Reaver was still gripped in her hand. With horror she noticed that it was covered in blood, as was the hay where it had laid.<br />
<br />
Grelin returned, with Rocsalt in tow. And slowing, limping severely, Talvarien entered the stable behind them, eyeing Camille warily and giving her a large berth.<br />
<br />
"I'm sorry if I worried you, guys." Camille began, stepping forward. Talvarien scuttled backwards, terror in his eyes.<br />
<br />
"Cami," he said, panic in his voice. "Put DOWN the sword!Down girl! Don't hurt the Talv...."<br />
<br />
"Huh?" she asked, confusion in her eyes.<br />
<br />
"Before Talvarien has an accident in his pants, I suggest you put down the sword, Cami." Roc suggested. "He's already had enough for one day."<br />
<br />
"I don't understand," Camille said.<br />
<br />
"You stabbed him." Grelin grinned.<br />
<br />
"I WHAT?" Camille said in shock, stepping towards Talvarien.<br />
<br />
"DON'T HURT ME!" Talv half-shrieked, pulling Rocsalt in front of him.<br />
<br />
"Talv!" Camille said, slowly placing the bloody sword onto the ground. "I'm sorry...I....what happened??" She took two steps deliberately away from the sword.<br />
<br />
"When we woke up and you missed breakfast, we started looking for you." Roc said. "Talv tracked you to the stable, found you sleeping in the hay. He tried to wake you up."<br />
<br />
"And you tried to KILL me like a crazy woman!" Talv wailed. "Where's the love? None!"<br />
<br />
"You sliced him in the leg, without even opening your eyes. And then you went right on sleeping." Rocsalt said, with a half smile. "He screamed like a little girl."<br />
<br />
"It HURT!" Talv exclaimed indignantly. "It took three ranja heals to stop me from bleeding to death."<br />
<br />
"Bah." Roc said. "It takes a full ranger heal to heal a mosquito bite. You were fine after Grelin popped a regen on you. And what's with the limp?"<br />
<br />
"I'll be a gimp for life." Talvarien predicted.<br />
<br />
"You're gimp now." Grelin replied.<br />
<br />
"No love!" Talvarien exclaimed, and was silent.<br />
<br />
"Talv, I'm sorry, I didn't know what I was doing." Camille apologized sincerely. "I've had a....long night. And long day it seems. I missed breakfast? That means..."<br />
<br />
"Aye," Roc finished for her. "It's sunset now. You slept the whole day away."<br />
<br />
"The whole day." Camille said, agitated. River was locked in that gem, and she was sleeping away what could be precious time. "Let's get back to the guildhouse, guys. I need to get into some clothes and tell you what happened."<br />
<br />
She picked up Reaver, and left towards the house, Rocsalt and Grelin at her side. Talvarien fell into step behind them, with a careful eye on Camille's swordhand, but the limp miraculously gone. He was as curious as the other two to where Brimstone had gone and why Camille was asleep in the stables.<br />
<br />
Grelin fixed a quick dinner as Camille detailed her meeting with Terris, the history of Grieg, the use of the blue gem, every little detail she could remember. They ate quietly while she told the tale, stopping every now and then to eat. She was ravenous. At the end she sat back, exhausted by the retelling.<br />
<br />
"So what do we do now, head over to Greig's place and bust River out, powpowpowpow?" Talvarien said, all thoughts of his little injury forgotten.<br />
<br />
"No." Grelin said, shaking his head.<br />
<br />
"You remember what Katarin said about that statue." Rocsalt added. "Akethadar couldn't scratch it. It would be suicide to head in there just us four."<br />
<br />
"Plus Terris wanted me to talk to Vven first." Camille said, recalling how insistant the goddess had been. "He may have some answers for us that will make some sense."<br />
<br />
"I haven't seen Vven Psyphon since.....since my arms got ripped off and they buried me during End Game." Talvarien said with a shudder.<br />
<br />
"He stayed on in Hate, taking my place when Innoruuk demanded a soul be paid." Camille said, remembering back two years ago. "I bet he is still there."<br />
<br />
"Then we need to get to Hate." Roc said, standing up. "Which means..."<br />
<br />
"We need a wizard." Camille finished.</font></p>

	<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" >"Verdad, let us in!" Camille called again, knocking on the door urgently.<br />
<br />
"Not home?" Grelin suggested.<br />
<br />
"He's home, I see candlelight in the windows." Camille said, knocking again. "My mother was a wizard, she would never leave a lit fire in the house if her and my father were out. Wizards respect the power of fire too much."<br />
<br />
"Allow me." Rocsalt said, stepping forward. He rapped his knuckles on the door, hard.<br />
<br />
Inside, the sound of a door opening hastily, and then the locks clicking open. The door swung open.<br />
<br />
"Come in, A...." Verdad began, standing in the doorway in nothing but black boxers decorated in bright red hearts. A half finished bottle of wine was in one hand. As he took in the four in his doorway, his mouth dropped open in surprise.<br />
<br />
"Sorry to call this late, Verd." Camille apologized, "But I need a favor."<br />
<br />
"Um, bad time guys...." Verdad began, finding his voice, turning his head to a closed door behind him nervously. The sound of falling water stopped, and Verdad looked back at them imploringly.<br />
<br />
"Nice duds. Is that real silk?" Talvarien said, slipping past Verdad into the room. Verdad turned with him, panic in his eyes, as the rest filed into the room. "Wowowow, look at this place!" Talvarien exclaimed, taking in the lush couch, with the candelabras lit in all corners, half eaten cheese platter on the marble table, plush tigerskin rug. Outer clothing was scattered all over the couch, some male, some female. "Is this an original?" he asked, pointing to a satyr and nymph orgy scene framed on the wall.<br />
<br />
Verdad quickly closed the door behind them as they invaded his living room. "Cami, heh, I would never close my door to you, I hope you know that, but your timing is a little...."<br />
<br />
"Verd, I wouldn't have come if it weren't important." Camille said honestly. But Verdad was only half listening, still looking at the door from which the sound of water had stopped.<br />
<br />
"Any other time, ok?" Verdad begged.<br />
<br />
"Good cheese!" Talvarien said, popping another piece in his mouth.<br />
<br />
"I need to get to Hate." Camille said quickly.<br />
<br />
"Hate?" Verdad blinked. "Just get on that horse of River's. You still have it, don't you?"<br />
<br />
Suddenly the door swung open, and a redheaded highelf, dressed only a towel, walked out, facedown as she wrapped up her hair in another towel, water dripping onto the carpet.<br />
<br />
"So where is this surprise you promi..." she began, looking up. And then her mouth dropped open as she took in the room.<br />
<br />
"Jazzy..." Verdad began, hands up in supplication as her face grew dark.<br />
<br />
"THIS is the surprise?" she exclaimed indignantly, anger rising. "FOUR PEOPLE??"<br />
<br />
"We lost the horse." Talvarien answered for Camille obliviously, popping another piece of cheese into his mouth.<br />
<br />
"HORSE??" Jazzy shrieked.<br />
<br />
"Jazzy it's not what it seems..." Verdad began, face crumbling.<br />
<br />
But she was not listening. She stalked over to the couch and grabbed up her robes. "You sick perverted..." and a string of colorful curses as she stormed into the bathroom and slammed the door behind her.<br />
<br />
"Sorry, Verdad." Camille said, mortified. <br />
<br />
"You're cramping my style!" Verdad wailed, and then a knock on the door. Verdad's eyes went wild. "Don't get..."<br />
<br />
"I got it." Talv said blithely, swinging open the door.<br />
<br />
In the doorway, another, younger high elven girl stood with her eyes closed, wearing a long black trenchcoat. The moment the door swung open, she opened the trenchcoat wide with a smile. Underneath she was wearing two tassels, a skimpy loin cloth and.....nothing else.<br />
<br />
"I wore it!" she said brightly, eyes still closed. "Where's my surprise??"<br />
<br />
"Surprise." Grelin said, grinning.<br />
<br />
The girl's eyes snapped open.<br />
<br />
"Aiene...." Verdad began.<br />
<br />
"Impressive." Rocsalt commented, eyebrows raised, as Aiene hastily covered herself with the trenchcoat.<br />
<br />
"There's no horse!" Talvarien added emphatically.<br />
<br />
Aiene screamed.<br />
<br />
"Aiene..." Verdad tried again, when Jazzy swung open the bathroom door, now fully dressed, and took in the latest addition in shock.<br />
<br />
"Oh my gods, you sick bastard!" Jazzy exclaimed. "Aiene too? She's only seventeen!"<br />
<br />
"Today's my birthday." Aiene said miserably.<br />
<br />
"She's legal now!" Verdad tried desperately.<br />
<br />
"And there's NO horse! None!" Talvarien piped up helpfully.<br />
<br />
"Perverts!" Jazzy exclaimed, shooting Verdad a murderous look. He took a tentative step toward her, but her eyes narrowed and she disappeared from view, gating.<br />
<br />
"Aiene..." Verdad sighed, turning back to the girl in his doorway. She was fuming.<br />
<br />
"YOU RUINED MY BIRTHDAY!" she screamed, eyes lighting gold. A white hammer materialized in the air, hovering for a moment.<br />
<br />
"Not in the face!" Verdad cried, as the hammer flew at him. He ducked.<br />
<br />
--SMASH-- the hammer hit Talvarien full in the face, breaking his nose.<br />
<br />
"Ranja...down..." Talvarien said weakly, slumping onto the couch.<br />
<br />
"Aiene..." Verdad tried again, but the girl blinked, and like Jazzy, gated.<br />
<br />
"Verdad..." Camille began lamely.<br />
<br />
"You're KILLING me here, Cami!" Verdad growled, looking distraught in his boxers.<br />
<br />
"Verd, I wouldn't have come if this wasn't important!" Camille pleaded. "It's about River..."<br />
<br />
"River is dead, Cami," Verdad said, miffed. "As I have been trying to remind you for the last six months..." He suddenly tapered off, a nervous look crossing his face. "Um, he IS dead, right?"<br />
<br />
"Yes and no..." Camille began.<br />
<br />
"Ah dammit, Grelin, fix Talv's nose!" Verdad exclaimed, noticing the ranjer groaning behind him. "He's bleeding all over the damned couch..."<br />
<br />
"Easy with the schnozz!" Talvarien yelped, as Grelin touched his fingers, glowing green, to Talvarien's shattered nose.<br />
<br />
"So what exactly did you wreck my life for?" Verdad asked, shrugging into a robe and sinking into an easy chair.<br />
<br />
And Camille, for the second time that night, told her tale.</font></p>

	<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" >"This is unreal." Verdad commented, staring at Camille when she finished.<br />
<br />
"It's real alright, Verd." Camille replied.<br />
<br />
"You know," Verdad said, "It's getting to the point where I'm afraid when I see a Wyldechylde."<br />
<br />
"Will you help?" Camille asked, looking him in the eye.<br />
<br />
"On one condition." Verdad said.<br />
<br />
"And that is?"<br />
<br />
"Dinner when this is over." Verdad said, watching her.<br />
<br />
"Not a chance."<br />
<br />
"Ok, I'll do it anyway." Verdad sighed.<br />
<br />
"Thank you, Verd." Camille smiled. "We need to leave at once."<br />
<br />
"Ok, stone please." Verdad said, standing up.<br />
<br />
"Stone?" Camille said blankly.<br />
<br />
Verdad sighed. "Hate stone. I need a reagent to port."<br />
<br />
Camille looked flustered, and glanced around at the lost looks of her companions. "I...err..don't...."<br />
<br />
"You didn't bring a rock." Verdad finished for her. "Ok, buckle up, we're headed to the Nektulos. I need to see a guy River turned me on to that can work the inside."<br />
<br />
"Nektulos?" Camille asked, confused.<br />
<br />
"The only place port stone to Hate are sold are in Neriak. There's a guy I use in there for potions and other oddities." And then, with a word in elvish, they shimmered and disappeared.<br />
<br />
With a flash of light, they found themselves on the flat-topped pyramid that was the wizard portal in the Nektulos Forest, which housed the teir'dal city of Neriak. Verdad started off, motioning for them to stay.<br />
<br />
"I'll be back in about ten minutes." he said over his shoulder.<br />
<br />
Talvarien glanced down at the ground and then looked up. "Verd waitwaitwait."<br />
<br />
"What?" Verdad asked, stopping impatiently.<br />
<br />
"I'm picking up...." Talvarien began, running down the side of the pyramid and staring at the grass. "One two three...ten...twenty? More. Over twenty guards in full armor near here, and not long ago either."<br />
<br />
"Over twenty guards?" Verdad said incredulously. Not that he didn't believe him. They may be correct in doubting Talvarien could tie his boots without hurting himself, but when it came to tracking, they trusted the ranger's talents implicitly. It was just that large a force in the Nektulos was unheard of for a very long time.<br />
<br />
"Aye." Talv said, looking up, "And they're patrolling. They'll be back."<br />
<br />
"Well, I can send you all back to my place...." Verdad began.<br />
<br />
"We'll go with you." Camille suggested. "Grelin, Spirit of Eagle and Foilage Sheild please."<br />
<br />
Grelin nodded and began chanting. His first spell lifted them up in the air, levitating them, lending speed to their movement, and blessed their eyes to see the invisible. The second spell made them disappear from normal sight, though they all saw each other plainly.<br />
<br />
"Alright, while it holds." Verdad said, "Let's move."<br />
<br />
They made their way double quick through the forest to the city of Neriak.</font></p>

	<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" >Verdad turned to them outside the filthy hut deep in Neriak's Foreign Quarter, and mouthed, This is it. Camille nodded, and followed Verdad into the rundown shack, the others on her heels.<br />
<br />
She stopped dead as a dog began to growl.<br />
<br />
And then a loud whipcrack as something in the shadows passed wind.<br />
<br />
"Shhhh, Stinky!" a decrepid voice called out from the gloom across the room. "Don't growl at the dinner guests! Kekkekekkekkekekke!"<br />
<br />
The dog's growl tapered off to a low snarl, but didn't stop.<br />
<br />
"Soso?" the voice asked, "Who be here? Sound off, cause I can't see you yet!"<br />
<br />
Verdad murmured something, and his hand began to glow with wizardfire, just enough to light the room for Camille and Rocsalt, his two human companions, with their weaker eyes.<br />
<br />
Across from them, sitting in the darkness stirring a large soup pot, was a disgusting troll. A filthy cur of a dog lay at his feet, hackles raised, looking at them dangerously.<br />
<br />
"We see you now, Scurg." Verdad said, addressing the troll.<br />
<br />
"Ah you see me, but I don't see you, see? Kekekekkekk! Soup needed radishes!" the troll laughed oddly, pointing up to his face. Both eyes were missing, leaving nothing but dark black holes in his face.<br />
<br />
"I'm so going to be sick." Talvarien moaned.<br />
<br />
"If you do, do it in the pot!" Scurg suggested. "So, I hear two. One voice I know, one I don't. But there are more yes? I hear your in out of breath! So who be you?"<br />
<br />
"Camille Wyldechylde." Camille offered, trying not to breathe in the stench.<br />
<br />
"Talvarien." Talv said, shifting uncomfortably.<br />
<br />
"Rocsalt. Di'Varr." Roc added, and able to finally make noise after their hushed trip through the city's outskirts, let go with his cough he had been surpressing.<br />
<br />
"Grelin." the druid finished.<br />
<br />
"Five! Old Scurg has five bless me, come to my home! Going to need more soup!" Then he turned roughly in Verdad's direction. "So, back so soon, paleface? Ran out of Scurg's Spirit of Rabbit already? Lady friends like it, yes? Thumpthumpthumpthump done!"<br />
<br />
"Err..." Verdad said, face turning red. "I don't need any more potions, Scurg, thanks, I need..."<br />
<br />
"Ah, I know what you need." Scurg murmured, stirring his pot. "Scurg know lots of things."<br />
<br />
"I know Scurg is out of his freakin' gourd." Talvarien whispered to Rocsalt.<br />
<br />
"Kekekkkkekekkk, ranger boy!" Scurg said loudly, turning his eyeless face directly to Talvarien. "I threw my eyes into the soup, but not my ears! You may be right, you may be right, but it better to listen to a crazy man than to hear nothing at all, yesyes?"<br />
<br />
"Um, yeah." Talvarien said, embarrassed he had been heard.<br />
<br />
Scurg continued to stir his pot. "Yesyes, Scurg hear many things. Scurg see many thing, with or without radishes! Scurg see snakes slither across the face of the moon! Scurg smell a change in the wind!" And to punctuate that, he farted loudly.<br />
<br />
"Scurg," Verdad said suddenly. "There is increased patrols in the Nektulos. You know anything about that?"<br />
<br />
"Ahh, the darkies are up in arms!" Scurg gibbered, nodding. All cities are increasing their watches! Something strange afoot, for lighties and darkies both! The books of passage are gone, poof, stolen!"<br />
<br />
"Books of passage?" Rocsalt asked. <br />
<br />
"Yes, sick one." Scurg said, turning in Rocsalt's direction. Roc gave another involuntary cough, almost on cue. Camille glanced at him nervously before looking back to the troll.<br />
<br />
"What books of passage?" Camille asked.<br />
<br />
"He means the portal books to Plane of Knowledge," Verdad said slowly. "Don't you, Scurg?"<br />
<br />
"Yesyes," Scurg said, nodding vigorously, "Young lion smart as he is virile! Kekkekekkkekekke!"<br />
<br />
"What the hells?" Verdad asked. "Those books are fused to the pedestals they sit upon, to prevent theft."<br />
<br />
"But when the rock become soup, easy enough to pluck out the chicken!" Scurg chortled.<br />
<br />
"Rock becomes soup?" Verdad asked, confused.<br />
<br />
"Whoever take the books, melted the rock!" Scurg informed him, stirring the pot happily.<br />
<br />
"Odd." Rocsalt commented.<br />
<br />
"Great." Verdad moaned, looking at Grelin. "Well, Grel, get ready for a ton of 'Hey dood, can you port to West Commons for 5 plat?'..." Grelin nodded sadly. "So, Scurg, I need a Hate rock."<br />
<br />
"Ah, going up to see my old friend, aye? Tell him for Scurg things too quiet around here without him! Kekekekkkekke!" Then Scurg reached down under his seat, looking for something. "Hate stone, Hate stone..." he murmured. "Ah, here it be!" And he withdrew something from under his chair and held it in Talvarien's general direction. It was a lumpy shape, brown, and had a foul odor. Talvarien took it from the troll and stared at it, holding it in his hand.<br />
<br />
"Um, Scurg." Verdad said, "That's not a Hate stone."<br />
<br />
"Hmm?" Scurg asked, snatching it back from Talvarien. He sniffed it once. "So it ain't! Bad dog!" he scolded, as the dog cringed. "Bad Stinky! I told you, not in the house!"<br />
<br />
"Gah!" Talvarien exclaimed in disgust, frantically wiping his hands on his leggings.<br />
<br />
"Ah well, flavor for soup!" Scurg said, tossing the dog turd into the pot with a wet splash. "Now where be it?" and he went rummaging under hs chair again. After a short time, he brought up a black stone, looking very much like coal.<br />
<br />
"Ah here it be, yes?" Scurg said, holding it out.<br />
<br />
"I'm not touching it!" Talvarien cried.<br />
<br />
"That's it, Scurg, thanks." Verdad said, taking the stone from the troll. "Put it on my tab."<br />
<br />
"That I will, that I will, kekekekekke." the troll chuckled. "So....stay for dinner?" he pointed to the pot.<br />
<br />
"I'll pass." Talvarien said weakly, still wiping his hands.<br />
<br />
"We have to go, Scurg." Camille said politely, "But thank you."<br />
<br />
"Ahh, another time, maybe!" Scurg suggested brightly. Then he stared in Camille's direction. "Give Scurg some time with Mithaniel's handmaiden, yesyes? I have secrets for her."<br />
<br />
"No." Grelin and Rocsalt said in unison.<br />
<br />
Camille blinked, hearing herself addressed by the strange troll in what she had thought to be a semi-private name for her.<br />
<br />
"Guys, I'll be fine." she said slowly.<br />
<br />
"Cami..." Rocsalt began.<br />
<br />
"Do you doubt my ability to fight, Roc? Or am I just River's wife to you?" she said warningly, looking at him with an eyebrow raised. Rocsalt's mouth snapped shut and he said nothing.<br />
<br />
"Leave us a moment, I'll be right out." she said.<br />
<br />
"Gladly." Talvarien said, slipping out the front door.<br />
<br />
"Be quick Cami." Verdad said, "We'll be between the huts outside. We shouldn't be seen by the guards in this area."<br />
<br />
And, with a last look of disapproval from Grelin and Rocsalt, the men made their way outside.<br />
<br />
"Come closer, dreamer." Scurg chortled, stirring the soup. Camille obliged him and came closer to the blind troll.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, like a snake, he dropped his ladle into the soup and grabbed her right hand in both of hers. His grip was clammy but firm. Her first reaction was to strike him, but she kept that in check, as his grip was not for pain, but to emphasize his next speech.<br />
<br />
"Remember this, girlie!" the troll whispered, his face up close a picture of madness. "When you want to talk to the dead, they got no ears left when the worms finish with them! So, you wanna talk to the dead, you gotta speak their language! They say dead men tell no tales, but dead women got plenty to say! Heed the troll shammie! Scurg knows many things! And the Dane still got plenty to say, for a man with no tongue! Kekekkkekkkekekekkekekeke!"<br />
<br />
Camille, body recoiling from his insane chatter, yanked her hand out of his grasp.<br />
<br />
"Thank you..." she managed, making her way out the door, trying to make sense of his gibberish.<br />
<br />
"Anytime, girlie!" Scurg called out after her, "And when it's all done, come for soup!"<br />
<br />
"Ready?" Verdad said, seeing Camille appear in the alley.<br />
<br />
"Aye." she said.<br />
<br />
"What did that crazy bastard say to you?" Talvarien asked.<br />
<br />
"Later." Camille said distractedly, rubbing her hand absently where the troll had touched her, trying to get the clammy feeling out of her system.<br />
<br />
"Be ready for anything." Verdad warned. "I hear Hate has changed a bit."<br />
<br />
"I love the place." Rocsalt said. "I spent so many raids there I could pull it blindfolded."<br />
<br />
"Not anymore." Verdad corrected him, starting to chant.<br />
<br />
"Huh?" Rocsalt began.<br />
<br />
But then, the incantation done, they winked out of sight, as the slums of Neriak disappeared from around them.</font></p>

<br />
They appeared around a shallow well, one Camille had never seen before in her previous raids on the home of Innoruuk. Normally you would arrive in Hate in a small abandoned building, praying that you wouldn't be swarmed by patrolling mobs that milled without direction through the streets. Now, you were outside on the streets in a corner, with no instant flurry of action, since the streets were deserted.<br />
<br />
"They removed the second floor." Rocsalt commented, glancing up. Camille followed his gaze. The low ceiling of the plane of Hate had disappeared, and the gothic buildings soared into the heights, arched and majestic, the architecture impressive in the pale blue glow that seemed to light the plane.<br />
<br />
"So, the reports were right." Verdad said. "Zone in is safe...."<br />
<br />
Talvarien was inspecting the walls surrounding the well with interest, reaching out to touch the bricks. "Wowowow, look at the stonework on this wa..." <br />
<br />
"Who dares invade the home of Innoruuk?" a spite golem growled from somewhere on the other side of the wall.<br />
<br />
"More victims for the Father!" cackled an unseen loathesome lich.<br />
<br />
"Blerg blerg!" cried an evil little imp.<br />
<br />
"Ooops?" Talvarien said lamely.<br />
<br />
"Same old aggro problems." Rocsalt sighed. He took a defensive posture as Camille drew Reaver out of its scabbard and prepared.<br />
<br />
From around the corner came a crowd of Hate's denizens.<br />
<br />
"So not good...." Talvarien said nervously, drawing his bow.<br />
<br />
"No chanters, I'm using areas..." Verdad murmured, hands glowing. Grelin looked around helplessly at the dead end they were trapped in.<br />
<br />
"Succor no good." he said.<br />
<br />
"No." Verdad agreed. "Probably drop us off right here again."<br />
<br />
Surrounded, the mob of liches, revenants, clerics, and other nightmares came towards them.<br />
<br />
"Cami! Verd!" came a loud happy voice from the back. The rush of demons stopped as if frozen in place. "Back, back to your camps, idiots!" the voice continued, as someone began to move through the crowd. "They're with me."<br />
<br />
The crowd of mobs parted, and out came a teir'dal with jet black hair and a big smile. He was carrying a clipboard and quill.<br />
<br />
"Well, I'll be damned!" the dark elf said. "Why the hells didn't you write you were coming?"<br />
<br />
"Nice timing, Vven." Verdad replied.<br />
<br />
"It's all about the timing." Vven agreed, looking from Verdad to Cami. "Cami, looking wonderful, amazing what a month asleep in Hate can do for the skin...."<br />
<br />
"Thank you, Vven." Camille said, smiling despite herself.<br />
<br />
"And is that Talvarien? With ARMS?" Vven exclaimed. "I almost didn't recognize you!"<br />
<br />
"Hi Vven." Talvarien said, wincing at the recollection of having his arms ripped off in the Plane of Nightmare.<br />
<br />
"And Rocsalt, Grelin...." Vven nodded. "What, is Razor's Edge coming up for a raid? We're not open yet..."<br />
<br />
"Razor disbanded after River died, Vven..." Camille said quietly.<br />
<br />
"Ah, I had heard River slipped in Velks." Vven said carefully. "I would have come to the funeral, but I didn't think dancing on his grave would be appropriate..."<br />
<br />
"You wouldn't have danced on his grave." Camille said, not believing the teir'dal for a minute.<br />
<br />
"Well, maybe just a LITTLE dance...." Vven laughed. "Boy was Inny upset when River didn't end up here..."<br />
<br />
"You look well, Vven." Camille said, changing subjects.<br />
<br />
"Hate has been good for inky." Vven agreed. "I found my true calling, as an administrator here. So what do you think of the place? All my idea..." He turned and gestured broadly to the buildings behind him with the clipboard. "Hate 2.0!"<br />
<br />
"Interesting..." Roc commented, face not registering if he cared for the changes or not.<br />
<br />
"Vven, I came up here to talk to you about something...." Camille began.<br />
<br />
"Sure sure..." Vven said, taking her by the hand and pulling her away from the well. "Let's talk in the lounge. I can give you the nickel tour as we head over."<br />
<br />
"Hate has a lounge?" Rocsalt asked, nose wrinkling.<br />
<br />
"Oh, Hate has a lot of new things." Vven said, looking at him sidelong slyly.<br />
<br />
And, as the others following the teir'dal and Camille, they made their way south into the streets of Hate.</font></p>

	<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" >"This first part of Hate is the same 'ole, same 'ole." Vven said, pointing to various buildings with the quill. "Just with better scenery. You like it? Sorta like Katta without the fog machine." <br />
<br />
Various mobs were working their way in and out of the buildings, dragging in furniture, removing large sacks of trash, typical construction site. They paused for a moment as a spite golem crossed their path, pushing a large harpsichord into a nearby building. <br />
<br />
"ANOTHER piano?" Vven asked the spite golem incredulously. <br />
<br />
"Sorry, Boss." the spite said apologetically. "Maestro's orders."<br />
<br />
"Soooo old school." Vven sighed, steering them around the musical instrument. Then in a low whisper he added, "Maestro has been pitching a fit ever since I took over operations in southern Hate. So since he was assigned Zone In, every other building has a freakin' piano. Ridiculous waste of money. What are we going to do, play classical music and BORE them to death?"<br />
<br />
Camille just shrugged, not knowing quite what to say.<br />
<br />
"Ok, so, here's Northern Hate, clerics here, spites there, yadda yadda..." Vven said dismissively. "Now, we're getting near my area. Cami, do you remember way back when, why Innoruuk didn't want to keep River in Hate?"<br />
<br />
The answer was on her lips in a second. She still remembered the day she woke up from her long sleep in End Game like it was yesterday. "He said because River would turn Hate into an amusement park." she recalled.<br />
<br />
"Right!" Vven exclaimed, moving them along. "So after you two left, I started thinking, Hmm, not a bad idea. Took me half a year driving Inny crazy but..." He turned the corner and made a grand gesture. "Voila!"<br />
<br />
They stopped dead in their tracks and gaped.<br />
<br />
There, sprawled out before them, lights flashing, was a huge demonic....carnival. Booths lined the streets, with dozens of games. A rollercoaster roared in the distance. Ramps leading to different attractions were everywhere, complete with rulers protruding from the ground with height requirements for certain rides.<br />
<br />
"Oh...my...gods..." Roc blinked in disgust, and started coughing.<br />
<br />
"You like it??" Vven asked happily, clapping his hands together. Fortunately, Roc at the moment could not respond.<br />
<br />
An abhorrant, stone wings flapping, flew up to Vven carrying a large box. "The advertisments are in, Boss!" the abhorrant exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Vven excused himself for a moment while they stared at the glitzy travesty before them and took one of the fliers out of the box. As he skimmed it, his face grew dark.<br />
<br />
"What the hells is this? 'Come to 'isnnyland!'....'ISNNYLAND?" he barked. He rolled up the flier and rapped the abhorrant over the head with it. "Idiot, do you even proofread this crap before you send it out? It's INNY'S LAND, not 'isnnyland, you moron! Get this back to the printers before they close!"<br />
<br />
"Yes Boss." the abhorrant said miserably, lugging the box back the way he came.<br />
<br />
"Can't find good help nowadays." Vven sighed, looking at them apologetically. "Anyway, come, I'll show you some of the highlights!"<br />
<br />
They followed him mutely, too amazed to say anything.<br />
<br />
"The whole thing, you know, came to me in a flash. I mean, when I was adventuring with the rest of you saps down on Norrath, I used to think 'and THIS is what I get? Camp the Arch Mage in Guk for 8 hours for these crappy PANTS?'...risk vs. reward was more imbalanced than casters vs. melee in the Arena. Why bother? So, I figure, after you battle it out in Maestro's area, read:RISK, then you get to inky's area, read:REWARD."<br />
<br />
"Oh my gods, I LOVE this!" Talvarien exclaimed. Rocsalt just stared at him.<br />
<br />
"Ok ok ok," Vven said, speaking at a fast clip. "Over there you got the Pirates of Guntrak, over here you have Tolapmuj's Wild Ride, and heh here's a little game I had dedicated to Whizbang, that little punk." He steered them towards a booth with a board on it, with about half a dozen holes cut into it. Chained to the board on a long cord was a fist sized replica of Pedi, Whizbang's wife. A large sign over the booth indicated the name of the game: Whack-A-Gnome.<br />
<br />
"Hehh," Verdad said. "I like this one."<br />
<br />
"Guarunteed to be a hit!" Vven exclaimed proudly. "Pop in a plat, and a little Whizbang pops out of anyone of these holes for a few seconds. The more Whizbangs you bonk with the Pedi Hammer here, the more tickets you get, till you win an Inny Doll! Whiz even goes 'Damnation!' when you hit him. Priceless!"<br />
<br />
"Can I play now?" Verdad asked hopefully.<br />
<br />
"Later!" Vven said, pulling Cami and the rest deeper into the carnival. "I want to show you my biggest brainchild!"<br />
<br />
They paused as a new sign loomed. In large pink letters, they read 'END GAME GROVE'.<br />
<br />
"...'End Game Grove' ..???" Camille exclaimed.<br />
<br />
"Hey!" Vven replied. "I had some of my best laughs during End Game! So I dedicated a whole section of the park to it. Come, look!"<br />
<br />
They walked under the sign, Camille still shaking her head, after Vven.<br />
<br />
In one section they found a rather large booth. On the counter, was mock pieces of a human being. Inside the booth sat a sad looking squid, dressed rather pathetically in a dragon costume. An ire ghast in a carnival barker's hat was sitting on a stool outside it. The sign over the booth read 'STARVE WUOSHI'.<br />
<br />
"Starve Wuoshi!" Talvarien replied in delight.<br />
<br />
"That's right kid, Starve Wuoshi!" the ire ghast piped up, sensing a customer. "Just 5 plat to try your luck! The object is to pick up these pieces of human meat and toss them past old Wuoshi there! If you can get three body parts past her without her catching and eating them, you can get this genuine imitation Shattered Emerald of Corruption, just like all the rangers want!"<br />
<br />
"Imitation?" Talvarien asked, smile fading. "Doesn't the real Shattered Emerald of Corruption drop in Hate?"<br />
<br />
"Hheh, yeah kid," the ghast chuckled, rolling his eyes. "Surrre it does."<br />
<br />
"Hard as hells to win too!" Vven added. "See our Wuoshi there? Out of work squid-thing from the Plane of Water. Not much to look at, but the damned things got sixteen arms! Nothing gets past him!"<br />
<br />
Camille took a good look at the pieces of 'human' on the counter. Her eyes came to rest on the head. Something about it was familiar. Long black hair, moustache....<br />
<br />
"Vven!" she shrieked.<br />
<br />
"What??" he asked, recoiling from the anger in her voice.<br />
<br />
"You are feeding this Wuoshi thing a dummy of RIVER?" she yelled.<br />
<br />
"Ok ok ok! Poor taste!" Vven said as she bonked him. "I'll have it changed to Verdad or something!"<br />
<br />
"You better..." Camille warned.<br />
<br />
"Take a picture with Ramluk?" Vven said, trying to lead them away from the replica of Riverdane's dismembered body. A large spite golem in ogre battle armor stood looking bored against a pole.<br />
<br />
"Ogre." it said half-heartedly.<br />
<br />
"That's OGGA!," Vven whispered fiercely, jabbing the thing in its side. "You're making me look bad!"<br />
<br />
"Ogga." it said, shrugging its massive shoulders.<br />
<br />
"Ok ok ok." Vven said, eyes murderous, pulling them in yet another direction. "This one's my favorite. Check this out!" He dragged them to a large mechanical model, rather realistically rendered of a large tree, with the features of a beautiful elven woman etched into the bark. Above it, was a pretty sign that said 'The Tunare Tree'.<br />
<br />
"Ok, stand back!" he said, as a forsaken revenant ran up to him with a bottle of liquor and a torch. Vven took both and stood in front of the tree.<br />
<br />
"Ok, I learned this trick from an old friend Momur....that chick makes me look like an amateur." And with that he took a huge swig of alcohol, holding it in his mouth. Then he quickly brought the torch near his face, and with a woooosh spit out the drink into the fire. A huge flame shot from his mouth, hitting the tree and enveloping it in fire.<br />
<br />
Immediately, two eyes in the tree opened up as it started to burn. The woman's mouth started opening and closing as the branches began flailing about. "Oh no!" she wailed. "It's End Game! I'm burning! I'm burninggg!"<br />
<br />
Vven wiped his mouth and stood back proudly. "Gods I love that."<br />
<br />
Camille addressed the demented dark elf from a distance. "Vven, this is...fascinating. But we really need to talk."<br />
<br />
"Ok ok ok." Vven said, steering them away from the tree, which was still moaning something about 'The tear! The tear!'. "Let's hit the bar."<br />
<br />
"A bar in Hate." Rocsalt murmured.<br />
<br />
"Yeah!" Vven said, stopping in front of a large building. "Here it is." A large sign above named the bar. It said: JEERS.<br />
<br />
Vven pushed his way in. The place was packed with undead, drinking and having a rather good time. When he entered, they all lifted their mugs of beer as one. "Vven!" they chorused.<br />
<br />
"Hey." he waved, then turned to his companions. "Where everybody knows your name." he said, motioning to a large unoccupied table to the side.<br />
<br />
Sitting down, Vven finally slowed down, and looked at Cami.<br />
<br />
"Ok, Cam. What do you want to talk about?" he asked.<br />
<br />
Cami took a deep breath, and said, "What do you know about Greig Veneficus?"<br />
<br />
Vven's blue skin drained almost of all color.<br />
<br />
"Oh boy. There's a name I try not to think about." he said, twitching nervously.<br />
<br />
"Tell me." Camille insisted.<br />
<br />
And he did.</font></p>

	<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" >"Where do I begin?" Vven asked, "Greig, damned, I didn't think I would be asked about him ever. Who's been talking to you about him, and why? Vindayyan? Dooma? Moelle? We had made a pact not to talk about it to anyone, but who can trust dark elves?" He laughed ironically. <br />
<br />
"None of them." Camille said, "It was Terris."<br />
<br />
"Terris?" Vven laughed, then stopped abruptly, searching Camille's face for a lie. Camille just nodded slowly. "That bitch. She DID pick my head, then. I knew it."<br />
<br />
Vven whistled sharply towards the bar. Within seconds an ire ghast bearing a tray of six mugs of ale appeared at the table and set them before the party. Rocsalt and Verdad took their mugs up, while Camille, Grelin and Talvarien let theirs sit. Vven took his mug and drained in down in one long quaff.<br />
<br />
"Ok, let's see." Vven began, staring at the empty mug. "It was a while ago, a year? Year and a half maybe before the whole End Game thing. I was on a double date with my pal Vindayyan, this dark elf shadowknight I was was guilded with at the time. Sort of like River but blue and bloodthirsty. I was dating Dooma, this inky cleric, and Vinny was with this teir'dal wizard chick, Moelle. Both of us thought we were getting laid for sure that night, until the girls show up, and Dooma introduces her idiot cousin Randolf, a....hells, I forget his class. Probably didn't have a class, too damned stupid to learn one. The kid was sort of gangly and awkward for a dark elf, and...slow, I guess is the word. Freakin' moron, would laugh like an idiot, even if no one was saying anything. Me and Vinny exchange looks cause with Happy the Classless Dope with us, getting these chicks out of their gear and into the shadows was going to be more difficult than banking in Felwithe. But, we go out anyway, Vinny having brought two jugs of Black Poison, and the five of us head to the moon to see what trouble we can get into.<br />
<br />
Moe ports us into Dawnshroud Peaks cause she 'loves the wolves'. So we spend some time killing wolves, getting a little wasted on the Black, setting the wolves on fire and watching them run off howling, when this raid ports in. They're wearing a mix of armor, none of them looking like they could take on Crushbone with the way they're milling about and ignoring orders the leader is desperately calling out. We all are hiding, old dark elf trick, and none of them see us.<br />
<br />
'Pickup raid, looks like.' Vinny whispers to me, and I nod, smelling disaster. And then Vinny starts smiling all nasty like, and I'm smiling, and mouth 'Pickup raid' to the girls and now they're smiling, and Randolf, he's smiling cause he's an idiot, and then he starts with that stupid laugh of his, and Vinny kicks him till he shuts up.<br />
<br />
So, this raid finally gets its crap together, and we, too drunk to think twice about this, sorta mix ourselves in in the back. They don't even notice. And they start marching along a hillside, and end up in front of this old castle.<br />
<br />
In we go with the raid, and they are a freakin' mess. They have like three pullers and two tanks and the tanks are trying to plow by just marching ahead but the pullers are getting angry they aren't allowed to pull so they start pulling anyway, and pretty soon we're fighting mobs that we're walking into and mobs that are being added by the pullers and it's like a joke. At this point, just to keep US alive I'm mezzing like nuts, and Dooma is healing Vinny cause he's getting his hands in it, and Moe thank Inny ISN'T using areas for once. But it's pretty bad, and I'm pretty drunk. I don't know to this day how I was even able to cast, I was so gone from the booze. I was literally hallucinating. I'm looking at one of the tanks at one point and suddenly he looks like this minotaur, so I poke Vinny and point, and Vinny sticks him with the sword and he dies and then he looks like the tank again. Ooops, ah well. Black Poison is some strong crap, let me tell you.<br />
<br />
We stopped doing anything at that point, after we killed one of the raid, and just hung out in the back, watching. This raid would have wiped for sure if not for the size of it. And deeper and deeper into this place we go.<br />
<br />
Then we get to this one place where like four halls are intersecting and the raid is jamming in and I'm thinking, aggro city, they are gunna pull everything within 100 feet. So I grab the girls' wrists and pull them after me and Vinny into this one room we just cleared and wait. And Dooma's like 'Where's Randolf?' and Vinny sighes and rolls his eyes, while she goes off to find her cousin. After a moment she comes back with Idiot Boy, who's giggling and Vinny has to backhand him to shut him up, before the raid heard we were in the backroom and wondered why we weren't with the rest of them. So I pass around the bottle and we juice up, and wait. And sure enough after a few moments, we hear them start fighting and yelling add, add, add. I guess they lost their other chanter earlier or he gated or something, cause they keep yelling add add add and I just keep on drinking while they start screaming and this goes on for a while and then finally stops. <br />
<br />
After all the noise finished I invis up and check out the room. Everybody's dead, the mobs, the raid, everybody. There's more blood than when Vinny tried to pierce his ear with a dagger when we were kids. So I call in the rest of them to see, and Dooma goes 'Rezz them?' and I go 'Nah' and Vinny suggests, 'Loot the mobs?' and I go 'Yeah!'. So we start rummaging through the dead, but they don't have nothing, cept this one, has this key. And go figure, the room has a locked door. So I'm looking at Vinny going "Key?' and Vinny's wasted enough to say 'Sure.' so we put the key in the door and click we're in.<br />
<br />
Nothing in the room cept this big glowing gem, the size of man. And Randolf that idiot goes 'Oooh, sparkly!' and touches it, and POOF he disappears. Dooma starts cursing and saying we gotta go get him, so we all against our better judgement touch the gem and POOF we go too, into this room where Randolf is running around like the dope he is with three mobs on him. Now, we have a chanter, a tank, a cleric, a wiz and a moron, and it's only three mobs, so mezz mezz chop chop boom we kill them. Then Vinny kicks Randolf and Dooma kicks Randolf and we look around and see there's only one way out, through this door at the other room and up these steps. I'm thinking, let's just have Moe port us the hells out of here, but Vinny wants to look up the steps, so up we go."<br />
<br />
Vven stopped speaking for a moment, lost in thought. Then he pointed to Camille's untouched mug.<br />
<br />
"You going to drink that?" he asked. Camille shook her head.<br />
<br />
"Don't mind me." Vven said, picking it up and draining it. Then putting the empty mug down on the table, he continued.</font></p>

	<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" >"At the end of the steps, we're in this, bedroom or something. And it's occupied. By this...blob of purple snot, just...gross. It's got eyes and a mouth, and two arms, and its sorta floating there, and we're getting sick looking at it when it notices us."<br />
<br />
"Greig..." Camille murmured.<br />
<br />
"Yeah," Vven said, looking up from his empty mug for a moment. "The thing opens its maw and growls 'After all this time, invaders in the home of Grieg Veneficus! Prepare to meet thy doom!' or some flowery crap like that. But Vinny, quick as a whip says 'You Greg?' and the thing says, 'I am Grieg.' and Vinny says, 'Well you can thank us later, man. We just killed a raid that was on their way to kill you.' Randolf goes to say something but I just kick him, and he howls and shuts up. Probably the smartest move he ever made. And this Grieg thing floats over to us and it's like staring and I can hear Moelle starting to murmur an evac. And then the thing smiles, freakin' SMILES, the ugliest smile you ever seen, and says 'Thank you.' I almost fell over. Thank you!<br />
<br />
So Vinny, being the gentleman he is, offers the bottle of Black to this thing, and the thing looks at it for a second, and then takes it in one drippy hand, takes it to his lips, and CHUGS it. Chugs Black Poison straight, like it was water. We're just staring at this thing, half glad he polished the bottle off cause no WAY I'm bringing that bottle to my lips after he wrapped his around it, when he goes two shades darker purple and pukes all over the floor. Randolf the idiot starts laughing and someone kicks him, Moelle I think, and Grieg is sort of embarrassed and looking at Randolf like he wanted to kill him. And he's sorta wobbling now, and I'm thinking, this thing is as wasted as we are.<br />
<br />
So Vinny says, 'Why you in here all alone, man?' and the thing starts going off on Luclin trapped him there, and he wasn't strong enough in that form to get out, and how he hates her, and rambling on and on, cursing Luclin worse than some of the best teir'dal ranters I have heard. Then the thing starts, crying, and mixing in crying and cursing and we're all standing there looking at it feeling sorta disgusted. Then the thing looks up and says, 'You got through the traps, you can get me out of here!' and I'm thinking no friggin' way and say 'Yeah sure man, we'll get you out'. Vinny gives me this look but I just shrug but this thing is so happy Vinny just goes with it. 'Yeahyeah, no problem man.'. Well, the floating grape goes to leave down the stairs, but it's so wasted it crashes into the wall instead. "You're too gone to go now.' Vinny says, looking at it trying over and over to walk through the wall. 'Let's sober you up a little, sit down, play cards or something.'<br />
<br />
'Cards?' the blob says. And Vinny nods and pulls out his old deck of cards he had intended to use for strip poker with the girls before the idiot cousin showed up, and some dice. He motions for us to sit down, so we all do, near the blob thing in a circle.<br />
<br />
'Let's play Pain/Fear.' Vinny says. 'You know what that is?' Old Teir'dal card game, played with a deck and dice. Grieg just says 'No.' so Vinny starts telling him the rules, five players, each gets so many cards, you can only play a card off the top of your deck on the player to your left, and you have choices, Pain or Fear. The guy you play your card on has to play the card off the top of HIS deck against you, and you have the option of Pain, killing his card if its weaker than yours, or Fear, sending his card to the bottom of his deck if it is stronger than yours, which is hard. Both players roll the dice, add the total to the cards value, compare, and the high total wins the hand. Fun game. Something to do. Hells, we were still wasted ourselves, somehow playing Pain/Fear with a purple turd didn't seem too odd.<br />
<br />
Well, Grieg gets this shifty look in his eyes, and goes behind the bed and pulls out this glowing rock. He comes back and sits down and drops the rock in the middle of us. 'There.' he goes, 'Now that will stop anyone using magic from cheating.'<br />
<br />
'What's that?' I ask, and he smiles all sly like.<br />
<br />
'Something I created.' he said looking all nasty. 'It puts up a radius that cancels all magic, in case one of you tries to alter what the cards look like.'<br />
<br />
Bah, paranoid bastard. Plus, it was exactly what I DID intend to do, so he sort of crimped my game style.<br />
<br />
Vinny starts dealing out the cards to Grieg, me, Dooma and Moe. Then Randolf is standing there, and goes 'hey I wanna play.' Like the idiot knows how to play Pain/Fear. Plus, it was a five person game, no room. We just laughed and called him names. We didn't let poor Randolf play in any Pain/Fear games. Vinny told him to watch and learn and Randolf grumbles and stands there, sorta drooling watching.<br />
<br />
'I hate kids.' Greig said, staring weird like at Randolf. Vinny's dealing, making small talk, saying 'Yeah me too, always playing on my damned lawn.' which starts Moe off laughing like a nut, cause there are no lawns in Neriak. <br />
<br />
'Are there many children like this one out there still?' Greig asks.<br />
<br />
'Kids?' Vinny says, dealing. 'No kids man, most of the children up here went back to Norrath after we figured out how to get back to the moon.'<br />
<br />
'The way back was discovered?' Grieg says, all shocked like.<br />
<br />
'Yeah man a while ago, how long you been IN here?' Vinny says, still dealing out the cards. But Grieg just starts mumbling crazy like again, and then says 'The children laughed and threw garbage at me, when they forced me in here. I hate them.'<br />
<br />
'You gunna jabber or play cards?' Vinny said. And Grieg mumbles something else, and then turns over his card. It's a ten. Vinny is sitting to his left, so turns over HIS card, and its a 7. So Vinny asks him if he wants to Pain or Fear. Grieg says Pain, figuring his card is already higher, that he'll be able to get rid of Vinny's 7 no problem. They both roll, and Grieg roll a 1 and Vinny gets a 6. That's Vinny, luck of the halflings. So they total at Grieg with an 11 and Vinny with a 13, and Vinny shakes his head sadly and tells Grieg to bury his card. Greig is sorta pissed but goes to do it.<br />
<br />
When SUDDENLY, Randolf starts braying like a damned donkey and pointing at Grieg and laughing, going 'He can't play Pain/Fear! He sucks!' an all sorts of stupid crap. And Grieg's face is getting more and more purple, and I want to kick Randolf but I'm sitting so he just goes on and on.<br />
<br />
Well, Grieg floats up and looks at Randolf, and he's mad. 'What am I, here for your amusement?' he yells, but Randolf can't stop laughing. 'What am I a clown to you? I'm here to make you laugh?' He's angry as hells, but Randolf isn't getting it, and the rest of us get real quiet, not knowing what to do. And Grieg is fuming, 'You think this is funny, you stupid moron?' Grieg is going, and Randolf must finally figure it out, cause he stops giggling and starts staring at Grieg, who's circling him at this moment. And something must have frightened him, cause suddenly, his pants get this growing stain in the front, and he just lets go where he's standing, pissing himself. And Grieg looks at the stain and smiles, and then all the anger goes out of his voice. 'Yeah, that was sorta funny, me losing like that, huh?' he says all nice like, and starts to laugh. Well, we're all on edge, and Randolf starts to giggle with him, thinking its ok. And then Grieg laughs some more, and damned if it wasn't infectious, all of us start laughing, I mean tears from your eyes laughing, Grieg laughing the loudest of all, Randolf right along with him.<br />
<br />
And then suddenly Grieg stops laughing and grabs Randolfby the arm and opening that big weird mouth of his, takes a bite out of the kid's neck. <br />
<br />
Blood gushes everywhere and w're just sitting there in shock and Randolf is making these gurgling noises and Grieg is just biting away, at the kid's face, arms, taking out huge chunks. We're all getting drenched as randolf's getting eaten and before long he's nothing but a piles of bloody flesh and we're all in a daze and Moelle is staring real hard at the glowing rock thinking the same thing I'm thinking....no evac with that thing cancelling magic.<br />
<br />
'Let's play cards.' Grieg says suddenly, as if nothing happened, and floats down again.<br />
<br />
'Um, sure.' Vinny says, trying to be cool, but his hands are shaking. It's not every day you see someone get eaten, you know?<br />
<br />
'Hate kids.' Grieg said again. 'I'd kill them all if I could.' <br />
<br />
'That's cool, man.' Vinny says, playing a card on Dooma, who's not even watching, she's just looking at her dead cousin.<br />
<br />
'I could you know,' Grieg rambles, 'When I get out of here I'm going to talk to a few creatures I know, and kill all the kids. On Norrath, they are now?'<br />
<br />
'Yeah yeah.' Vinny says, trying to tune him out. 'Dooma, you going to play or what?' but Dooma's still staring at the bloody cousin.<br />
<br />
'How you going to kill them?' Moelle asks timidly. I haven't ever heard Moe timid, but we were all a little rattled.<br />
<br />
'Drown them.' Grieg said.<br />
<br />
'That's going to take some time.' I said, poking Dooma in the side so we could get the game done and find some way out of there. Dooma came out of her stare and made a bad play and Vinny took her card, but I don't think he cared if he won or lost at that point.<br />
<br />
'I'll get them all in one shot.' Grieg nodded. 'Shift the moon off its orbit, mass flooding on Norrath, earthquakes, the works... lock up the portals to Luclin...let them all drown..."<br />
<br />
'How you going to move the moon?' I asked, intrigued despite the situation.<br />
<br />
'Rockets...' he whispered. 'With some help...'<br />
<br />
Well at the time, this was before the gnomes and all started talking about rockets and jet packs and stuff, so I didn't know what the hells he was talking about.<br />
<br />
'Cool.' I said, playing a card on Moelle. But Moelle, eyes wide listening to Grieg, had a brainstorm, thank Inny.<br />
<br />
She stood up. 'Me and Dooma have to powder our noses. Excuse us.' And she grabbed Dooma by the hand and practically dragged her up the stairs out of the room. Me and Vinny caught the idea.<br />
<br />
'Um, yeah...' Vinny said, 'I have to go drain the weasel, I'll be right back.' and up he goes after the girls, leaving me alone with the Purple Blob from Outer Space. <br />
<br />
Grieg's not paying much attention, instead, reaching for the other bottle of Black Poison and starts drinking it.<br />
<br />
'I'm gunna smoke, if you don't mind.' I said, and then made a show of patting my pockets. 'Damned, Vinny has my smokes, I'll be right back.' Grieg just nods and keeps drinking, and I get up and hurry out after them. Then minute i get out the door, Moelle starts chanting and we port the hell out.<br />
<br />
I have never been so damned happy to be out of somewhere. Dooma is freaking out, saying 'How I am I going to tell Uncle Dvinn his son is dead??' and I'm like 'Ambassador Dvinn is your uncle??!' and you think you know a chick and all...<br />
<br />
Well Vinny suggests we just STFU and pretend like Randolf never came out with us. And after a while, Dooma sees this is a good idea and we agree to never mention this again. And that was the end of our relationship with THOSE two chicks.<br />
<br />
But me and Vinny, well we never said a thing to nobody after that. Until, now that is."<br />
<br />
And that being said, without asking Vven reached out for Grelin's untouched ale, and began drinking it down, the ghosts of his past fading from his eyes with each gulp.</font></p>
