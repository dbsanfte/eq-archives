    within the Temple 

    of Solusek Ro. Solomen is a human wizard located on the left portion of 

    the temple, third floor, between the two undead knights, one room away from 

    Lord Seafire. The end result of the quest is not known, but it is thought 

    to be a blunt sceptre type weapon with fantastic stats as well as unique particle 

    effects when held. This is the mother of all wizard quests.</p>

  <hr noshade>

  <p>You say, 'hail Solomen'</p>

  <p> Solomen says 'Ah, I see you have found my study. This is where I study and 

    scribe the history of magic in Norrath.</p>

  <p>You say, 'what history?'</p>

  <p>Solomen says 'I have worked to chronicle everything from the beginnings of 

    magic to what we consider the modern day of magic. Solusek Ro has been very 

    generous to those who wield magic in Norrath. But throughout history there 

    is one thing I have noticed - too much power corrupts the soul. I have seen 

    and documented that the strongest wizards and those closest to Solusek Ro 

    become corrupted by their power.</p>

  <p>You say, 'what wizards?'</p>

  <p>Solomen says 'Unfortunately, I don't have time to speak of such things right 

    now. But I could use your help since you are here. I have here an envelope 

    that I need delivered to one Camin Rah. You can find Camin in the wizard tower 

    in the city of Erudin. He is a sage like myself whose knowledge rivals my 

    own. Do you [agree] to undertake my task? </p>

  <p>You say, 'I agree.'</p>

  <p>Solomen says 'Here you are, then. Good luck on your journey.</p>

  <hr noshade>

  <p>Solomen hands you a <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('solomen_note.jpg','solomennote','width=406,height=327')">note</a>

  <p><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('camin.jpg','camin','width=193,height=467')">Camin</a> 

    can be found at the Vasty Deep Inn within Erudin. To find him inside the Inn, 

    open the front door to the Inn and go up the stairs on your right. Follow 

    the hallway around the second floor and Camin is found behind the first door 

    upon your left. Off the bat, he is normally indifferent or apprehensive to 

    everyone. Hand him the note that was given to you by Soloman and you will 

    receive positive TrueSpirit faction. <i>(Note: Since the patch on 10/03/00, 

    you can no longer keep handing Camin the note and gain faction.. it has been 

    nerfed)</i></p>

  <p>Camin will now reply with -</p>

  <blockquote> 

    <p><b>Camin says</b>, 'So you have met Solomen, eh? He is a man with a wealth 

      of knowledge. It is good to hear he is well.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p>Now hail Camin and he will respond with this -</p>

  <blockquote> 

    <p><b>Camin says</b> 'Go away! I have no time for you! </p>

  </blockquote>

  <p>If this happens, you can continue with the quest. <i>(Note: Since the patch 

    on 10/03/00, you can no longer keep handing Camin the note and gain faction.. 

    it has been nerfed)</i>. </p>

  <p align="left">If you have good faction already, you can talk to Camin: </p>

  <blockquote> 

    <p><b>you say</b>, 'What are you searching for?'<b><br>

      Camin says</b> 'Ah! A smart one, I see! If you really wish to know about 

      such a thing, you will have to help me finance my studies. The knowledge 

      I have acquired and researched did not come cheaply.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p align="left">At this point, hand Camin 1000 platinum and the quest will continue. 

    Some have even reported this as working while being apprehensive to him <i>(confirmed 

    you must do this part of the quest or the next part will result in "I 

    do not do business with your kind.")</i>. Doing this will make Camin 

    reply with:</p>

  <blockquote> 

    <p><b>Camin says</b>, 'Good, good, you show a willingness to learn of this 

      with your offer. What I can tell you is that Solusek Ro had four followers 

      who had shown exceptional aptitude in the arts of wizardry. Solusek Ro himself 

      tutored them. He considered them to be like his own children. I know of 

      one who still exists. He goes by the name of Arantir Karondor. He used to 

      specialize in the storing of magic into physical objects. Arantir has been 

      hiding for many, many years and will most assuredly be going by another 

      name, so keep your eyes open. Anyway, be off, I need to continue my research. 

      Return to me if you ever find Arantir Karondor.'</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p><a name="dargon"></a></p>

  <p>Now to find Arantir Karondor. I honestly have no idea what Verant was thinking 

    when they did this part of the quest. There are <i>zero</i> clues as to who 

    or where this person is and honestly, it's sort of disturbing to me that every 

    other class' quest is straightforward, but still has a very good degree of 

    difficulty. None the less, there is a female NPC vendor in Halas named '<a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('dargon.jpg','dargon','width=149,height=363')">Dargon</a>' 

    that sells a potion called <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('ros_breath.jpg','rosbreath','width=330,height=145')">Ro's 

    Breath</a>. She is located in front of the Shaman guild. Purchase this potion 

    from Dargon for the sum of about 900pp to 1100pp depending on your faction 

    and charisma. <i>(**evil races be warned - you ARE KOS to surrounding NPC's. 

    See <a href="halas.htm?PHPSESSID=b419dd69515826e63f9ec98d62eebd1d">this page</a> for Halas Guard and Vendor info**)</i>. 

    There is also three other known vendors in the world that sell Ro's Breath 

    -</p>

  <ul>

    <li>Female Barbarian, Marlyn McMerin (loc -3825, +1665), who is found on the 

      dock shops in Fironia Vie.</li>

    <li>Female Iksar shaman vendor, <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('klok_scaleroot.jpg','klokscaleroot','width=220,height=418')">Klok 

      Scaleroot</a> in West Cabilis. </li>

    <li>Female coldain dwarf, Hudda, who is found within the bank inside the city 

      of Thurgadin.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>You can buy Ro's Breath from any of these vendors but you cannot return it 

    to them. Neither of them will turn into Arantir. However, it is confirmed 

    that you can buy Ro's Breath them, take it to Camin to be stripped of it's 

    charge, and then take it to Dargon. Handing this potion to Dargon in Halas 

    will make her turn into Arantir and the quest will continue.</p>

  <p><a name="caminpotion"></a></p>

  <p>Now take this potion back to Camin in Erudin and hand it to him. He will 
    reply with the following:</p>

  <blockquote> 

    <p><b>Camin says</b> 'Very interesting... I've seen this work before. Yes, 

      yes! It's the work of Arantir Karondor! Give this back to the person you 

      got it from. Maybe he will have a clue to Arantir's location.' </p>

    <p>Your faction standing with Truespirit got better<br>

      You gain experience!!</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p>Camin gives you back the potion (it has now been stripped of it's Shield 

    of Lava charge) and you must take it back to Dargon in Halas.<br>

    <i>Note: you cannot skip the previous trip to Camin. You absolutely, must 

    hand the potion to Camin. If you try to skip the trip to Erudin, you will 

    get the following message from Dargon: "I didnt request this item, but thank 

    you very much".</i></p>

  <p><a name="dargonpotion"></a></p>

  <p>Back in Halas, hand the Ro's Breath potion back to Dargon. She will turn 

    into blue robe adorned, <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('arantir.jpg','arantir','width=208,height=480')">Arantir 

    Karondor</a> and reply with:</p>

  <blockquote> 

    <p><b>Dargon says</b> 'So, I've been discovered! You must know Camin - he 

      is one of the only people who could have recognized my work. I have worked 

      very hard to mask my presence here.' </p>

    <p><b>You say</b>, 'hail Arantir Karondor' <br>

      <b>Arantir Karondor says</b> 'Before I tell you anything, I require you 

      to help me. Seek a woman named Challice. Give her this letter and then return 

      to me.'</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p><a name="challice"></a></p>

  <p>The letter that Arantir hands you is actually a ring called <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('arantir_ring.jpg','','width=330,height=145')">Arantir's 
    Ring</a>. Identifying it reveals: "Item Lore: My love has no bounds." <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('challice.jpg','challice','width=195,height=388')">Challice</a> 
    is found in the basement of the Felwithe paladin guild. Once you hand Challice 
    the ring, she will reply with:</p>

  <blockquote> 

    <p><b>Challice says</b> 'Oh yes? Arantir? What a fool he was! the man gave 

      me everything, but for all his intelligence, he could never understand why 

      I was truly with him. It was for his power; he could do anything. But when 

      he mysteriously lost it, he became just another toy. I never loved him. 

      Return this ring to him. He will understand that I have no desire to see 

      him again.' </p>

    <p>Your faction standing with Truespirit got better<br>

      You gain experience!!</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p><a name="returnring"></a></p>

  <p>This new ring, when indentified reads: "Item Lore: I never could love a man 
    like you." Take this ring back to Dargon/Arantir in Halas and hand it over. 
    <i>NOTE: When this quest was first introduced, you had to respawn Arantir 
    by handing Dargon another potion. The quest has been fixed to definitely make 
    Arantir spawn once you hand the ring to Dargon.</i> Once you spawn Arantir, 
    then you must hail Arantir to get his attention and go through the following 
    dialogue:</p>

  <blockquote> 

    <p><b>you say</b>, 'Hail Arantir Karondor!'<br>

      <b>Arantir Karondor says</b> 'Ah, but it pains my heart to see this. How 

      I could love a women like that is beyond me. And yet, I still do love her. 

      It was on the day I was to ask her to marry me that I lost my powers. When 

      I was about to cast my greatest spell to prove my love to her, my magic 

      failed. She ran out on me that day. But enough of me, do you wish to hear 

      my story?' </p>

    <p><b>you say</b>, 'I wish to hear your story.'<b><br>

      Arantir Karondor says</b> 'I once was one of four true followers of Solusek 

      Ro. So great were the four of us that Solusek Ro himself made us each a 

      special item. We did not know what the others' items were, but we realized 

      that was for our own safety. Each one of us, after receiving the item, began 

      to plot against Solusek Ro. Each of us believed we had enough power to dominate 

      Norrath. Solusek Ro saw this and at the time we needed our powers most, 

      he stripped us of them. Now I know two of the other wizards by name. One 

      was called Sylen Tyrn, the other's name was Demunir Scry. The last wizard 

      was a gnome, but I can't think of his name.</p>

    <p><b>you say</b>, 'What about Sylen Tyrn?'<br>

      <b>Arantir Karondor says</b> 'Sylen was a high elf wizard, and like many 

      high elves, he believed himself to be better than others. Because of his 

      birth, he thought he was more noble and more intelligent than anyone else. 

      I heard how met his demise - while flying over a vast area of water, his 

      powers were stripped from him in midflight. He fell and was captured by 

      a rival wizard who specialized in magics of the water. Search for that wizard 

      and you could find a trace of Sylen.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p>The 'trace' of Sylen Tyrn is found off of Phiningel Autropos deep in Kedge 

    Keep - the <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('../../weapons/1h_blunt/blue_crystal_staff.jpg','bluecrystalstaff','width=330,height=145')">Blue 

    Crystal Staff</a>. When this item is identified, the power of Solusek Ro radiates 

    from within.</p>

  <blockquote> 

    <p><b>you say</b>, 'What about Demunir Scry?'<br>

      <b>Arantir Karondor says</b> 'Demunir was a human in a rush for power. He 

      was extremely intelligent and resourceful but, unfortunately, was more interested 

      in destructive magic. Hearing of an ancient land, he immediately traveled 

      to it, believing there to be powerful relics left undiscovered there. While 

      exploring, he came upon a dwelling that housed a powerful warrior. Believing 

      himself to be more powerful, he attempted to take this dwelling for himself. 

      While in battle with this warrior, Solusek Ro stole his powers and left 

      him helpless. It is said that Demunir's item is the warrior's most prized 

      trophy.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p>The Demunir item is the <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('../../weapons/1h_blunt/gnarled_staff.jpg','gnarledstaff','width=330,height=145')">Gnarled

  <blockquote> 

    <p><b>you say</b>, 'What about the gnome?'<br>

      <i>if he doesn't reply, say the following..</i><br>

      <b>you say</b>, 'Who is the gnome?'<br>

      <b>Arantir Karondor says</b> 'Ah, the gnome I know very little about. I 

      know he was small and crafty, and that he had a brother. His brother's craft 

      was that of making fireworks, and he was the unfortunate victim of one of 

      his own experiments. His firework exploded, leaving his mind diminished 

      in capacity, even for a gnome. I remember others calling him 'Old Stewpot' 

      in jest. I do not know if this is his birth name, but it may help you to 

      locate him. I hear he also stays close to water because of the explosion. 

      You never know when another gnomish invention will go awry. Give him this 

      letter to help motivate him to remember. </p>

    <p><b>Kandin Firepot says</b> 'Great! Give this to Arantir so he knows you've 

      helped me! Hey! Have you seen my lantern anywhere? </p>

    <p> Your faction standing with Truespirit got better</p>

  <p><b>THE SECOND WAY</b> (the new way) -</p>

  <p align="left">If you hail Kandin instead of handing him the skin, the following 

    is what will happen -</p>

  <blockquote> 

    <p><b>You say</b>, 'hail Kandin Firepot'</p>

    <p><b>Kandin Firepot says</b> 'Hello, there! Don't have time to talk. I'm 

      workin', workin', workin'! Careful! Don't slip in the oil! <br>

    </p>

    <p><b>You say</b>, 'what oil?'<br>

    </p>

    <p><b>Kandin Firepot says</b> 'Ah the oil! I recently sent a specially crafted 

      golem to explore through a huge portal to another plane. It's instructions 

      were to collect special oil that I suspect existed in the plane. What I 

      think is the golem broke down. This looks like a good task for one like 

      you. Go see what's wrong with the golem. Here is <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('golem_sprocket.jpg','golemsprocket','width=330,height=145')">spare 

      gears</a> of mine incase it's broken. Be careful though, if you put it in 

      wrong it could explode or worse! </p>

  </blockquote>

  <p>This golem is a non-aggro '<a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('broken_golem.jpg','brokengolem','width=220,height=237')">broken 

    golem</a>' that is found in the Plane of Fear (-720, -109). Hand the broken 

    golem the golem sprocket -</p>

  <blockquote>

    <p>an enraged golem says 'Error! Malfunction! Destroy! <br>

      an enraged golem says 'Warriors like you always bring out the worst in me.'</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p>You now have an <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('enraged_golem.jpg','enragedgolem','width=220,height=360')">enraged 

    golem</a> on your hands that is aggro. The enraged golem can double hit for 

    400 each, has approximately 150k HP and is not a caster. Flame based spells 

    and lures are most efficient to use in bringing him down. Once he is dead, 

    loot the <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('green_oil.jpg','greenoil','width=330,height=145')">green 

    oil</a> from his corpse. Take this green oil back to Kandin in the ButcherBlock 

    Mountains.</p>

  <blockquote> 

    <p>You say, 'hail Kandin Firepot'<br>

    </p>

    <p>Kandin Firepot says 'Hello, there! Don't have time to talk. I'm workin', 

      workin', workin'! Careful! Don't slip in the oil!</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p>Hand over the oil -</p>

  <blockquote> 

    <p>Kandin Firepot says 'Oh wow! You found the oil! Where is the golem? You 

      didn't hurt him did you? I am very fond of him. Anyways, here is your reward 

      a note and staff to give to that guy you were asking me about. <br>

    </p>

    <p>Your faction standing with Truespirit got better</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p>You will now have BOTH the note to take to Dargon/Arantir <i>and</i> the 

    <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('../../weapons/1h_blunt/staff_of_gabstik.jpg','staffofgabstik','width=330,height=145')">Staff 

    of Gabstik</a>.</p>

  <p><a name="kandinsnote"></a></p>

  <p>Now take this note from Kandin and give it to Dargon in Halas. This will 

    cause Arantir to spawn in the place of Dargon once again. Once Arantir has 

    spawned, hail him and continue -</p>

  <blockquote> 

    <p><b>You say</b>, 'hail Arantir Karondor' </p>

    <p><b>Arantir Karondor says</b> 'Ah yes, you again. Do you have the items? 

      Give me the three you possess and I'll combine them with my own.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p>At this point, hand Arantir all three staves, the Blue Crystal Staff, the 
    Gnarled Staff, and the Staff of Gabstik. <i>IMPORTANT: Be sure to have an 
    empty slot open in your MAIN inventory before you hand over the 3 staves. 
    That or have a container that can hold a 'giant' item.</i></p>

  <blockquote> 

    <p><b>Arantir Karondor says</b> 'Here, this pack contains all of our items. 

      You will never be able to open it again, so you must deliver the pack, intact, 

      to Solomen. He will then reward you. Now that I have helped you, leave me 

      in peace.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p><a name="solomenspack"></a></p>

  <p>Now you must go back to <b>Solomen in the Temple of Solusek Ro</b> (not Camin!) 
    and hand him this pack. Upon doing so will result in getting the epic item, 
    Staff of the Four.</p>

  <blockquote> 

    <p><b>Solomen says</b> 'You actually did it! I never would have thought that 

      anyone could have truly followed this path. This is a tribute to your intelligence 

      and patience. Here, take this staff and know that you have made Solusek 

      Ro and all the wizards of the world proud this day. </p>
