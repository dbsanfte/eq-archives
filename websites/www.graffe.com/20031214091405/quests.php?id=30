<br><br>
First, talk to the halfling named Willamina in Plane of Knowledge (n426, 1143). She'll be sitting gazing at a tree.
<br><br>
<i>Willamina says 'The city is full of curious people all searching for something. Many have struggled for a long time to find their reward. Some are not even aware of what is it they are looking for, but will know it when they see it. Would you care to [help] me out? It will only take a moment.'</i>
<br><br>
<B>Say 'I will help you'</B>
<br><br>
<i>Willamina says 'How wonderful! To pass the time I enjoy sitting under the trees and sewing together luscious fabrics. But now it seems my old sewing needles have all broke or gone dull, and I require a new supply. Bolcen Tendag has promised to purchase and deliver some for me, but he has not yet arrived and I worry about him. If you could locate him and ask him...'</i>
<br><br>
Visit Bolcen in the good part of town (683, 949). He is in the building that leads to the archway up to the library.
<br><br>
<B>Say 'I have come for the needles'</B>
<br><br>
<i>Bolcen Tendag says 'I feel just terrible that I haven't been to see Willamina yet. Due to my illness I barely have the energy to stand. If you could aid me in some way, I would greatly appreciate it. Mirao Frostpouch might have an elixir that would help me feel better. Please seek him out and ask for it.'</i>
<br><br>
Mirao is in the neutral part of town (n95, n210)
<br><br>
<B>Say 'I have come for the elixir'</B>
<br><br>
<i>Mirao Frostpouch says 'That poor lad, he's always catching ill this time of year. Unfortunately I am out of the medicine he needs right now. Perhaps if you could obtain the key ingredient I am missing, I could brew up a batch for you to take to him. I have heard Cador recently came into possession of some black lava powder. If you can convince him to give you some, bring it to me right away!'</i>
<br><br>
Cador's place is back in the good part of town near Plane of Tranquility zone (630, 110)
<br><br>
<B>Say 'Do you have any black lava powder?'</B>
<br><br>
<i>Oracle Cador says 'You are most astute. I do have a stock of black lava powder with me, but I will only share it with those who prove themselves worthy. Onirelin Gali is currently in possession of an artifact I need to better commune with the spirits. Please recover it for me.'</i>
<br><br>
On you go to Onirelin in the evil side of town (n650, 1045).
<br><br>
<B>Say, 'I have come for the artifact'</B>
<br><br>
<i>Onirelin Gali pauses for a moment and continues, 'I am aware of that which Cador desires. Be wary of his ways for they are not always as they appear. Nevertheless, if he thinks this artifact will bring him greater peace, he may have it for a price. Certainly I have no use for it but what do I get in return? I'll tell you. Narik and I used to be good friends, until he became jealous of my relationship with his former companion Elisha. During our fight, he marched off with one of my finest jewels, and I believe still has it. Find him and ask for my jewel back. If you bring it to me, Cador may get want he wants as well.'</i>
<br><br>
Arch Mage Narik is in the neutral area (410, 80).
<br><br>
<B>Say 'I have come for the jewel'</B>
<br><br>
<i>Arch Mage Narik slams his book shut. 'So, the snake has legs after all! Tell Onirelin if he wants this back, he can come here himself and kiss my. . ., no wait. I have a better idea.' He draws closer and whispers, 'Did Onirelin tell you why I took this jewel? I did it in response to him taking my lady love, Elisha Dirtyshoes. We were to be married until she ran off with him. However, she also ran off with my engagement ring I gave to her. It is quite valuable to me, and I would be most happy to have it back. If you can procure it from her, I'll give Onirelin his jewel back. He's suffered long enough, I think.'</i>
<br><br>
Although getting involved in lover's quarrels is never a good idea, you're too far in to turn back now. Find Elisha in the merchant ring (390, 935).
<br><br>
<B>Say 'Can I have the ring?'</B>
<br><br>
<i>Elisha Dirtyshoes sighs and says, 'Tis a painful memory, for sure. My love for Narik fell once I met Onirelin, but my love for him was not reciprocated. Now I am left with no one to share my life, with only this ring as a reminder. Narik may have it back if he desires it, but then I shall be left truly alone. Boiron Ston once held a door open for me, such a handsome dwarf he is. If he could only find more time to spend with me, giving up this ring would be no problem at all. Do you think he likes me? Could you ask him and find out?'</i>
<br><br>
Right. Off you go then. This fellow is another merchant in the inner ring (35, 324).
<br><br>
<B>Ask him 'Do you like Elisha Dirtyshoes?'</B>
<br><br>
<i>Boiron Ston says 'Aye, she's a pretty lass. And I am aware of her feelings toward me. I haven't had the courage to approach her though. My family standard has recently disappeared, and no dwarf is the same when their standard is in jeopardy. Seek out Caden Zharik and demand my standard back, I believe he may have lifted it from me.'</i>
<br><br>
Almost done... Caden is a gnome at (n350, 760).
<br><br>
<B>Say 'I have come for the standard'</B>
<br><br>
<i>Caden Zharik turns white with fear. 'Ah, so he sent you to rough me up, did he? Fine, but you should know you couldn't hurt me any worse than Agrakath Theric would! I'm in a bit of trouble you see, I owe Agrakath some money I haven't got. So I stole the standard to pay him off. If you could please find him and have him somehow erase my debt, I would gladly give the standard back.'</i>
<br><br>
At this point, I would understand if you did want to rough him up a bit. But don't do it, even if he is a gnome. Head on over to visit Agrakath (n560, 1210).
<br><br>
<B>Tell Agrakath 'I have come to erase the debt'</B>
<br><br>
<i>Agrakath Theric grins and says, 'So, that weasel Caden has sent you to settle his debt? And you actually agreed to this endeavor? Ha ha, very well! I shall transfer the responsibility of what Caden owes me to your shoulders. I have a simple job for you. Somewhere in the library there lies a book I have been searching for, but it has eluded me for quite some time. I believe it can be found somewhere in the upper levels. You are to venture into Myrist and seek out a tome titled History of Evils: The Age of Scale, and bring it to me. Do this one task for me and your debt shall be relinquished.'</i>
<br><br>
Finally, something to do other than talk to someone. Head to the library, it's on a bottom shelf at about n100, 1000. The respawn on the book is reportedly about 30 minutes.
<br><br>
Once you have the book, take it back to Agrakath... you have to go back and talk to all those people again...
<br><br>
<i>Agrakath Theric eyes go wide with surprise as you hand over the book. 'Very impressive for one of your abilities. Here, take this note to Caden. He is absolved of his debt to me at this time.'</i>
<br><br>
<i>Caden Zharik eyes go wide with relief. 'Oh thank you thank you! Here, take the standard. And do apologize to Boiron for me. It shall never happen again. Again, thank you!'</i>
<br><br>
<i>Boiron Ston seems to perk up. 'Ah, 'tis a beauty, is it not? I thank you for its safe return. Perhaps I shall go and visit Elisha after all. Please take this letter to her, so she may be ready for me when I arrive.'</i>
<br><br>
<i>Elisha Dirtyshoes reads the letter and says, 'Oh happy day! Boiron will be visiting me soon. You may take Narik's ring back to him now. If you'll excuse me, I have some cleaning up to do.'</i>
<br><br>
<i>Arch Mage Narik says 'This is truly excellent. You have done well recovering this for me. You may take Onirelin's jewel and also tell him never to set foot near me again. Leave me now, I have much work to do.'</i>
<br><br>
<i>Onirelin Gali says 'How did you get this away from Narik? Oh never mind, I'm just happy to have it back. I shall give you what Cador desires now, keep it secure and deliver it to him.'</i>
<br><br>
<i>Oracle Cador says 'The spirits are restful now that this piece of legend is in safe hands. You may take this to Mirao for whatever purpose he desires it for. May your vision always be clear!'</i>
<br><br>
<i>Mirao Frostpouch takes the powder and quickly dashes it into a boiling cauldron. He then stirs it and pours the concoction into a small bottle. 'Here you go, this should make poor Bolcen feel much better. Hurry now, he's waiting.'</i>
<br><br>
<i>Bolcen Tendag says 'Oh thank you so much.' He drinks from the bottle, then reaches in his pocket and produces a set of needles. 'I believe this is what Willamina is in need of. Please take these to her and give her my best.'</i>
<br><br>
Finally...
<br><br>
<i>Willamina takes the needles and smiles. 'Thank you so much, kind stranger. I can't tell you how much you have really helped by doing this for me. It's funny, you know. The entire city seems to be in a happier mood today. I can't quite put my finger on it, but everyone seems to have uplifted spirits. Oh well, thank you again. I have something you may find to be of use to you, if you would be interested. Remember, knowledge is the key to life.'</i>
