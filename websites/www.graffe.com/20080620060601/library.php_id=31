    Minimum Level: 24<br>
    Maximum Level: 31<br>
    Zone Name: Lake of Ill Omen<br>
    Camp Area/LOC: Northwest Ruins by the lake shore<br>
    Mob List (HP): Goblins<br>
    Availability (1-&gt;10): 8 (popular for low level wizards)<br>
    Loot Ranking (1-&gt;10): 1<br>
    Diff.Ranking (1-&gt;10): 3 (must have SoW, a little difficult w/o BoF)<br>
    Faction Affected: Goblins decreased, Iksar increased<br>
    <br>
    Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: I learned to quad here, it's extremely simple and 
    a pre-packaged quad-kite. I had a hotkey to tell the zone, given the idiot 
    ratio in LoIO, when I was quadding. Plus OT and FM are right nearby, and you 
    can sometimes get into a Sarnak group.<br>
    <br>
    I suggest binding at the mill; it's a bit of a run to the ruins, but it 
    makes it easier when your SoW/clarity runs out, or when a pull goes bad. 
    Keep root and gate up at all times, and watch for roamers.</span><p align="center">
