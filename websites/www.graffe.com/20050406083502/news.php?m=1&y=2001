<br><ul>         Just a side note on the purchasing of your portals from Guardian Trekolz.          I noted to bring an enchanter or a bard with you to try to increase faction          in order to purchase. I got an e-mail saying that the bard's song does          not raise faction high enough in order to purchase. So if this is that          case, grab your nearest enchanter by the robe and drag them in there with          you. That or the failsafe way of finding someone with good faction to          simply buy the portals for you.</p>       <br><br><i>Thanks to Aeternus of Fennin Ro for the e-mail.</i><br><br>-Graffe</ul></div>

Here's her quote from the Bug          Board -        <blockquote> There was a problem unfortunately and the spell was missed          <br>         It will be fixed the next time we patch data... that is the best I can          do sorry =( </blockquote>       Even though they blew it, I can at least respect Ester for replying.        <p></p>       <br><br><i>The bummer is that there is no set date for the next patch.

<br><ul>         Yesterday, Verant introduced our vendor to the world that supplies us          with our Velious portal spells. However, there are a couple issues with          this vendor. </p>       <ol>         <li>The vendor carries 3 portals.. but not the correct three. It seems            that instead of putting the Great Divide Portal on the vendor, Iceclad            Portal is in it's place. So the three portals the vendor carries are            Wakening Lands, Cobalt Scar, and Iceclad.</li>         <li>Many are having faction issues with this vendor, resulting in not            being able to purchase. If this is the case, the quick fix is to find            someone with good faction to buy your spells for you or bring an enchanter            or bard to correct the issue.</li>       </ol>       <p></p>       <br><br>-Graffe</ul></div>

<br><ul>         There is a letter from Al'Kabor titled &quot;Stranger in Qeynos&quot;          to a one, Earron Huntlan found on the officail Everquest site. Here, Al'Kabor          speaks of combining some lost runes to make a very powerful spell. My          thoughts are that this spell creation is the one I found a couple weeks          ago in the data files. This spell is called Velium Chill of Al'Kabor and          it has a tag of 'Illusion Elemental' along with it. The data shows that          the spell is a level sixty, cold based direct damage, doing 1700 points          of damage. I am guessing this is a quest so I have started a new forum          just for it. Hopefully, we can all work together at this quest and perhaps          have a spell tagged by Al'Kabor himself that is actually worth the mana          spent.        <ul>         <li><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/hht/quests/mq_strangers05.shtml" target="_blank">Al'Kabor's            Letter &quot;Stranger in Qeynos&quot;</a></li>         <li><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm11">Velium            Chill of Al'Kabor Forum</a></li>       </ul>       <p></p>       <br><br><i>Thanks to Tellum for the link to the letter</i><br><br>-Graffe</ul></div>

<br><ul>         This afternoon, Absor confirmed that wizard portals are for sale on a          vendor, much like the NPC found that sells druid portals.

Rumors I hear are on a vendor        IN the Plane of Growth (I think this would have been found already) and        a vendor near the entrance to the Plane of Mischief.

<br><ul>         Over on <a href="http://www.everlore.com/" target="_blank">Everlore</a>,          Absor (Alan) responded to a druid forum post concerning quad kiting. If          this is to happen to druids, you can bet it will have a trickle-down effect          and hit us wizards as well. Here's what Absor said about it. -</p>       <blockquote>          <p>Quad Kiting: My personal opinion is that the ability to do this should            probably be reduced. I will probably suggest changes that have that            effect. Though the only one I&#146;ve seen (that wouldn&#146;t also            affect the rest of the gameplay for the class) that might work is to            reduce the range on AoE spells&#133;</p>       </blockquote>       <p>What are your thoughts on the issue? Should we be nerfed? Or should we          be allowed to use our spells to our best ability in order to get experience?

<br><ul>         Norrath history shows us that Al'Kabor is the great wizard that we all          could only wish to be (too bad his spells prove otherwise..hehe). The          other night on Quellious, Al'Kabor showed his face in the Dreadlands of          Kunark and the wizard by the name of Laughs was lucky enough to trade          conversation with him. In this conversation, Laughs was also given a book          by Al'Kabor which briefly tells about a few hidden spells. Here are some          pictures -</p>       <ul>         <li><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('../al_kabor/al_kabors_journal_v.jpg','alkaborsjournalvstatpic','width=330,height=145')">Al'Kabor's            Journal V Statpic</a></li>         <li><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('../al_kabor/al_kabors_journal_v_01.jpg','alkaborsjournalv12','width=418,height=340')">Al'Kabor's            Journal V Pages 1 &amp; 2</a></li>         <li><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('../al_kabor/al_kabors_journal_v_02.jpg','alkaborsjournalv34','width=418,height=340')">Al'Kabor's            Journal V Pages 3 &amp; 4</a></li>       </ul>       <p>Now if you read the journal, he speaks about some rare recipes for some          spells he has created. This could be a hint for us to try some crazy combo's          in research, but he also speaks of three spells he has created but hidden.          I think the three spells he speaks of are already in game. He speaks of          &quot;Inferno Shock&quot; and this is most likely the level 53 Inferno          of Al'Kabor. He speaks of &quot;a retribution effect of freezing winds&quot;          and this is most likely the level 56 Retribution of Al'Kabor. Lastly,          he speaks of &quot;Vengeance effect only usable by the 59th rank&quot;          and this is most likely the level 59 Vengeance of Al'Kabor. All three          spells are 'green jem' AE's, which are the spells most higher levels are          using for AE Kiting.

This has a few added effects on the other end. <br>             For instance, root will no longer cancel SoW or Journeyman's Boots              effects. It also allowed us to correct a long-standing bug that was              allowing bards to cancel root on themselves by playing Selo's Accelerando              if Selo's was in effect at the time that the bard was rooted. As mentioned              in a previous patch where the first part of this bug was fixed, this              was not the intended effect.</li>         </ul>         <p>Besides these two changes/fixes, there are a couple other neat additions            to the game you may want to read about.

I thought I'd take this moment to also say that the rune event on            Xegony that was held on Saturday was a huge success. Thanks so much            to Nelr for putting it all together and thanks to Exec for helping me            out with combining the runes. Before it all ended, a lot of wizards            donated their runes to the event. This helps out so much.. thank you!</p>         <br><br><i>Thanks again Nelr! Without you putting it together,            I doubt Xegony would have ever had a rune event.</i><br><br>-Graffe</ul></div>

<br><ul>           There is a new forum up to discuss the issues some have with wizard's            class balance, bugs, and issues. I was asked to create it in light of            Verant's recent listenings to other classes. Personally, I think it            would be a good idea to use the forum here to get all of your ideas            on the same page before submitting anything to Verant.

<br><ul>           I'm sure you've all seen the pictures of area effect damage and the            mass killing it can accomplish. I have too. But every once in a while            a picture comes across my desktop that I just have to post. This series            of pictures take place in Sebilis and was sent in by Lasomb the Large            who is in the guild 'Hoss' on Druzzil Ro. Here's what he had to say            -</p>         <blockquote>            <p>&quot;We have from time to time set up in Sebilis, with two level              59+ enchanters, and several level 59+ wizards with 3 people pulling,              and pulled from each wing, 20-30 frogs at a time for xp. in one pull              we had the Froglok ostarity(however that's spelled) the commander,              and the Necrosis scarab, and we killed them all easily. I have included              three screenshots of a standard xp pull with this method. and you              can see for yourself what damage effecency is, 8091 damage for 285              mana. Not too shabby. I think I made about a bubble of yellow experence              in a little under an hour here at level 58.&quot;</p>         </blockquote>         <ul>           <li><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('../screenpics/ae_sebilisfrogs01.jpg','aesebfrogs01','width=820,height=620')">The              Train</a></li>           <li><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('../screenpics/ae_sebilisfrogs02.jpg','aesebfrogs02','width=820,height=620')">The              Damage</a></li>           <li><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('../screenpics/ae_sebilisfrogs03.jpg','aesebfrogs03','width=820,height=620')">The              Aftermath</a></li>         </ul>         <p></p>         <br><br><i>Thanks Lasomb!</i><br><br>-Graffe</ul></div>
