I first went over to PoS to the froggie area in the forrest part of PoS.  I pulled using SoTF after getting the frogs in a nice tight bunch I didnt snare them yet.  I lured them down to the dead part of the forrest.  Over here you will have plenty of room without being worried about AoE snaring a tree or snake or running into some giants (bad things they are).  They sometimes resist your snare so be aware of that I would say on an uncommon basis.  Right now I have mana regen 18 with KEI Bot9, symbol, Force shield, shield and sow I would recommend at least this plus a 4.5k mana pool. I usually get about 23% per quad AA thats putting 10% in regular xp. These spawn about every 10min or so gives you enough time to med and pull the other 2 that spawn and kite them.  I suggest to take them out quickly so you can have time to med and quad the 4 that will spawn.  You get about 12% from those 2.  So thats about 35% in about 18 minutes worth of work.  

<P>Enjoy!  PS try not to get hit these babies inflict a wicked bad azz DoT on you.</td></tr></table></body></html>
