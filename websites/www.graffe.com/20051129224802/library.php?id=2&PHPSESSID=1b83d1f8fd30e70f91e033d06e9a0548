On the contrary there is so much you will have to discover on your own but I write this in hopes of encouraging those who have put away their AE spells to pull them out once more and make them a permanent part of their playing style.
<hr>
 <P>Ok, first off let's identify the problem with the player base. It's a 
 single MoB world out there and that's how everyone wants it cause that 
 means the party isn't taking as much damage. Mez, stun, whatever it takes 
 to reduce the amount of MoB's the party has to deal with cause it's a 
 1 dimensional world out there in Norrath. Why is it so 1 dimensional? 
 I've heard many explanations to the way things are and the one I absolutely 
 have to throw out the window is Efficiency. It is not more efficient to 
 tackle a group of multiple MoB's and take them down 1 by 1 in almost every 
 instance. There are instances where single mob tactics are required or 
 recommended due to grouping, type of camps, and special situations. AE's 
 are not meant to be used in every situation however, with proper planning 
 and a good knowledge on how the spells work they can be used in just about 
 every group you join. This writing is just to get you started down the 
 path with hopefully less deaths and to encourage you to explore that unused 
 spell line.</P>
 <P>So now you see the real challenge. Not how to use AE's but how to change 
 the mindset of the player base. And that may well be your toughest part 
 of this yet. Old habits die hard this is true of anything and probably 
 more so in EQ. </P>
 <P>There are 3 types of AE's so let's describe them:</P>
 <blockquote> 
 <p><b><u>Personal Based</u></b> - These AE's radiate out from the caster, 
 which requires the caster to be within Melee range or pretty close. 
 Due to the latest patch the radius of the PB's has been increased dramatically 
 making them even better. You can target a MoB or a friend and this spell 
 will work. This is my personal favorite due to the fact that there is 
 not a MoB limit. You can hit as many as you can fit into the blast radius. 
 I will more than likely be spending more time on this series than the 
 others due to their friendliness to group game play provided there is 
 an Enchanter in your midst. I still use this line even without an Enchanter 
 in the group but then again I'm a mad man.</p>
 <p><b><u>Distance AE</u></b> - These AE's have the range of your usual 
 DD spells and radiate out from the target, whether that be a MoB or 
 you target one of your Tanks. You want to be out of the blast radius 
 for these spells cause they will damage the caster too. Extreme caution 
 should be used with these spells in a dungeon cause they have a very 
 large radius when cast. The MoB limit for these spells is 4 in almost 
 every case. When casting this various line use them like you would a 
 DD spell. Assist the tank and make sure you're hitting the same MoB. 
 The only difference I would suggest is to let the tank get in 125% of 
 your damage, cause with AE's taunt does not really apply to the extra 
 MoB's and the Aggro of the extra MoB's is based off the main MoB that 
 the party is attacking. </p>
 <p><b><u>AE Rains</u></b> - Much like the Distance AE in range and target 
 however, this spell has a pulse type effect in that it will rain up 
 to 3 separate DD's centered around the area that the target was at when 
 cast. If the targets move out of the Rain they take no damage from any 
 pulses after the first. The MoB limit for these spells is also 4 and 
 not every time will there be 3 pulses (Dungeons usually have more 2 
 pulse rains in my experience). This line is diluted IMO and therefor 
 of less use. The more targets the less pulses and the more diluted the 
 damage (this may have changed I'll need to play with them some more 
 sometime and possibly re-evaluate them). Being in the area of this spell 
 line will also hurt the caster.</p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>First I'll take the easy route and talk about grouping with an Enchanter. 
 Enchanters get stuck on the Mez series. It's what everyone hollers for 
 when they get an over pull and it's reinforced in the Enchanters mind 
 cause they're good at it. If the MoB's resist the first Mez the Enchanter 
 pops off a Color Flux or the equivalent level AE stun and Mez again. Mez 
 has its place but not in a group with a good Wizard. Enchanters get an 
 AE stun at level 4, 20, and 44. They stun for 3, 7, and 12 seconds respectively. 
 In 12 seconds I can get off almost 4 PB AE's doing 1998 damage using Thunder 
 Clap and Cast Force (not the best setup but it allows me to chain cast 
 quite well) this is only on 3 MoB's so it's 666 pts of damage per MoB. 
 For 646 pts of Mana. Crunching the numbers to do about the same damage 
 with Conflag would cost 750 Mana but since the numbers just get better 
 with the more MoB's you add using AE's the Wizard comes into his own. 
 Want some numbers? 8 MoB's 1 hit of TC does 1856 damage for 175 mana , 
 all Mob's were Greater Kobolds and Solusek Kobolds with Shamans and their 
 pets. I got an e-mail from someone who got 15 MoB's with SuperNova but 
 we can all crunch numbers so let me move on. </p>
 <blockquote> 
 <p>More numbers from the Enchanters world:</p>
 <p>Color Flux level 4 25 mana 3 secs<br>
 Color Shift level 20 40 mana 7 secs <br>
 Color Skew level 44 60 mana 12 secs <br>
 </p>
 <p>Mesmerisation level 16 70 mana <br>
 Dazzle level 49 125 mana </p>
 <p>Seems to me an Enchanter can probably stun for a long time just by 
 looking at the cost of the stun spells. Heck the stuns are cheaper than 
 the Mez line, cast faster, and don't have the aggro potential of the 
 Mez line. <b><a href="#editorsnote">1*</a></b> </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>At the<font size="-1"> end of casting AE's from both the Wizard and the 
 Enchanter usually the Wizard is taking the damage so the Enchanter can 
 get off another stun. Rarely is this a problem since the Enchanter is 
 chain casting. There might be a MoB or 2 that resists but they usually 
 get stunned on the next try. Most of the time if I have the time (which 
 isn't often) I make sure</font> I start with Steel Skin up. Even in a 
 train situation with an Enchanter laying down stuns I lost 2 bubbles of 
 health or less during the whole fight. As far as clerics wasting Mana 
 on the Wizards I guess it doesn't matter if I'm the only one they're having 
 to heal to a great degree and with most of the MoB's stunned damage to 
 the casters isn't as bad as when a tank is going toe to toe with a MoB. 
 Caution should still be used when pulling MoB's to the group. I have used 
 this in the bug group in SolB which has level 40+ mobs in it but I don't 
 suggest pulling 10 sonic bats and trying this tactic unless the Enchanter 
 has an extremely high magic resistance (Sonic Bats have a stun spell). 
 Common sense will always play a part in AE use, it helps to be familiar 
 with what's around when you start using them</p>
 <p>This tactic with an Enchanter is great however, you must present this 
 to the group ahead of time and they must ALL have a warm fuzzy. Believe 
 me if the healer isn't ready for this and panics, it will be a short-lived 
 event for the Wizard and Enchanter as they see the healer running for 
 the zone. So always make sure the entire group is ready for what you are 
 about to do. This will vary greatly on the amount of MoB's you have to 
 fight. I have successfully in a party taken down 5 MoB's without an Enchanter 
 (our Enchanter was AFK and the puller didn't know, can you say oops?) 
 however this was very difficult and the healer was working over time. 
 As with any situation you can still over pull using this method. Pull 
 enough MoB's and all's it takes is 3 or 4 out of say 20 to not be stunned 
 and things can go bad (Myztic can tell you all about that).</p>
 <p>Now we'll talk about a tank heavy group. Of course you can't burn as 
 fast and as hard here which should be obvious. You're gonna be limited 
 in a few ways so let me talk about expected variations. MoB level, tank 
 level, amount of MoB's, and types of tanks will all affect your ability 
 to use AE's. If you're tanks are relatively low level in comparison to 
 the MoB's (Ex. Would be high level 30 tanks instead of Mid to upper 40 
 tanks in King group in SolB, or if the tanks are not at least a few levels 
 higher than the MoB's you are fighting) I'd suggest not using AE's cause 
 your tanks won't be getting any MoB off you through either killing it 
 or taunting it. Good taunting classes for AE use are Warriors, Paladins, 
 and SK's but you should always get a feel for what a group can do before 
 you go throwing down AE's. A common tactic for me to test the waters is 
 to wait until the first MoB, in say a 3 MoB pull, is close to dead (30% 
 or less in health) step in and lay down 2 AE's killing that MoB. 2 MoB's 
 aren't too difficult for 3-4 tanks to pull off a caster. If they do a 
 good job taunting you'll be able to get more AE's off but you really have 
 to be careful using your PB's. Columns are a little different. Use them 
 like you would DD's assisting the puller or Main tank but let the lead 
 tank get in 125% of the damage of the AE you plan to use. Verant has lowered 
 the aggro of AE's in that the extra MoB's won't immediately jump a caster 
 as long as they don't pull the primary targeted MoB away from the Tanks. 
 As a caster you will not always see this due to the fact that the tanks 
 can taunt the MoB they are on but this taunt does not apply to the extra 
 MoB's so you will have to be extra cautious in these situations.</p>
 <p>The higher the MoB's in level, the more there are other things you will 
 have to worry about but I'm just trying to get you started and not hand 
 you the game at this point.</p>
 <p>The use of AE's is a matter of preference plain and simple. But AE's 
 cannot be ignored when comparing damage from class to class. DD stands 
 for Direct Damage and AE's are nothing but a Subclass of the Direct Damage 
 spell line (with the exception of Rains which is in a way a visible DoT). 
 When you use a column on 4 MoB's you are doing Direct Damage to those 
 4 Mobs'.</p>
 <p>In retrospect, how long did it take to get used to using DD's in a group 
 setting? When to cast and when not to cast? How long to wait before you 
 could drop your big DD? I still know Wizards who DD until they're OOM 
 or the MoB is dead expecting the tanks to taunt off them, quite often 
 running in a circle screaming "Get it off me, get it off me!!" . These 
 are people I place on my do not group with list. These are people that 
 need to learn the game. It takes finesse and learning to be able to use 
 the AE line of spells correctly. One thing I want to stress is this writing 
 does not license Wizards to run down into SolB and expect to kill Fire 
 Giants with AE's. High level MoB's that have a natural high resistance 
 to certain types of magic should be handled accordingly. </p>
 <p>While this does open the road seldom traveled by Wizards and definitely 
 increases the power of our class, if used correctly, it also increases 
 the value of grouping. Even with good tactics we still need other classes 
 to be our most effective. Dropping all those MoB's fairly fast is all 
 well and fine until they start walking off cause you're waiting for a 
 spell to refresh. That's why it takes a good group of tanks and casters. 
 Rangers snare, Paladins, SK's and Warriors taunt, Monks and Rogues are 
 damage machines, you will still need healers, and who's gonna pull? </p>
 <p>If you've never used AE spells successfully before start out small. You 
 have to find your limits before going all out. Last thing I want is a 
 bunch of Wizards running around killing themselves or their groups cause 
 the first time they wanted to try these tactics they over did it. This 
 has been something that I've worked on for many levels and many deaths 
 and it doesn't come easy. I don't use AE's all the time and everywhere 
 but I always have at least one loaded (2 dd's and an AE almost always). 
 It takes time to learn where and when to use them but once you start you'll 
 find yourself using them more and more as you get comfortable with the 
 item and more players get comfortable with this play style. </p>
 <p>There will be tons of questions, complaints, and generally other things 
 to consider. I will be updating this page as they come to me. First thing 
 I ask is for you to think out your questions, sometimes you'll find the 
 answers yourself. A lot of times with tactics we need to research the 
 other classes and see what compliments our own line of spells or how we 
 can compliment another class. </p>

 <p><b><a name="editorsnote"></a>1* Editors note</b>: These spells are 
 listed with these values but through experience and from a good enchanter 
 friend of mine these duration's are not entirely correct. An enchanter 
 can however chain cast the level 20 and 44 spells with less than a round 
 in between refresh</p>
