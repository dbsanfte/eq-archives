<br>Greetings!! I am Bicrius, aka "Bic" of <a href="http://www.eqluclin.com">Luclin</a>. I am a wizard fanatic and a veteran quad kiter. I spend most of my time questing and goofing off, and only level when I need to... and every wizard knows that the best way to level is through quad kiting. Believe it or not, YOU are one of the best soloing classes in the game because of the wonders of quad kiting. So, with out further delay, I'd like to give my quad kiting advice to other wizards out there who don't know the wonders of quad kiting. This is what I did all the way from 34 through 45:</p>

<p><b>Necessary spells</b>:
<br>- Bonds of Force (level 34 vendor bought ae snare)
<br>- Circle of Force (level 34 researched ae)</p>

<p><b>Necessary buffs</b>:
<br>- Sow or jboot effect
<br>- Steel skin
<br>- Your best sheilding spell</p>

<p><b>Helpful extra</b>:
<br>- Staff of temperal flux (quested insta right click debuff item)</p>

<p><b>Best zone to quad in</b>:
<br>- Eastern Wastes</p>

<p><b>Quad kiting description</b>:
<br>- In Eastern Wastes, when you're coming down off the bridge from IC, turn right and follow the coast until you hit a tree that's sitting alone on the ledge, a little way past the Coldain Missionary post (loc not available at the monent). That tree is a safespot if you sit at it's base, not mobs should wander close enough to aggro onto you.</p>

<p>- 1. Bind yourself at the tree's base
<br>- 2. Self buff with your best shield and LeatherSkin/SteelSkin
<br>- 3. Spells to have loaded: Harvest, Circle of force, Bonds of Force, Root, Tishan's Clash, you're biggest dd for your level, a smaller dd (inferno shock or frost shock), and a gate to your favorite banking zone... I use Gfay Gate.
<br>- 4. BE SURE TO BE SOWED OR HAVE JBOOTS ON
<br>- 5. What to pull: You'll be pulling walruses, Ulthork Hunters, and Ulthork Warriors. A note on the Ulthork Warriors- unless you're 39+ you may have trouble finishing them off after the quad, but try it first. If you're 39+ don't bother pulling walruses because you won't get exp from them. If your back is to the ocean and you're at the base of the tree, the Ulthorks and Walruses spawn and wander in a range from directly along the coast to your right to about straight ahead of you in that 90 degree range.
<br>- 6. How to pull (without staff of temperal flux): Run up to get the Ulthork/walrus's attention, the second it aggroes on you MOVE IT and get another to aggro you until you have 4 of them following you. Run toward the Coldain Missionary Outpost... once you're somewhere between the tree and the outpost turn around and wait for your mobs to catch up to you... don't get too far ahead or you'll lose them. Once they're within casting distance, run around them in a large circle and round them up so that they're all close together. You may have to hit F9 a few times so you can get a good angle to see what you're doing... Once you've got them rounded up into ball, run along the coast toward the Missionary Outpost and past it... the coast has no mobs near it, it's safe. Once you've run far enough that you think you can get off Bonds of Force, stop and cast it. If some resist, run ahead and try again, then re-round them up and re-Bonds of Force them. Once you have them snared and following you, run ahead along the coast and cast Circle of Force on them. Repeat Circle of Force until they're all dead. Keep in mind how long since you snared, incase you have to re-snare. Bonds of Force only lasts roughly a minute and a half. If all hell breaks lose and you run out of mana, either gate or run along the coast to the bridge and zone.
<br>- 6. Pulling WITH a staff of temperal flux: Use the same as is stated above, but cast your SoTF on the run to aggro them, and use it as a gadge for casting distance for when you're going to cast Bonds of Force or Circle of Force.</p>

<p>Use root, tishan's clash, and your nukes when necessary for finishing them off at the end. Once you get the hang of this be creative, there are other safe places to pull, and that quad kiting skill will come in handy time and time again...</p>
<p></p>

<p>Good luck wizards of Norrath!! This worked wonders for me, I sold and gave away tons of Velium weapons, Ulthork armor, Walrus tusks, Ulthork tusks, etc... and actually made money doing this. PLUS Ulthorks can drop up to about 5pp each, so killing 4 of them at a time can be quite lucrative.</p>

<p>A final note on Ulthork Tusks- It's wise NOT to sell your Ulthork tusks. They're used for a quest in Cobalt Scar. If you hand 4 of them in at a time to the Otter chief there, he will give you rare gems and Velious quest armor gems... so you'd actually be losing out BIG TIME if you were selling the Ulthork tusks for 30-50pp each rather than doing this quest.</p>

<p>Any questions or other help? Come to <a href="http://www.eqluclin.com">Luclin</a> and look me up... the name is Bicrius, my main alt is Dabic.</p>

<p>And if you don't believe it can be done, this is from when I was only 37... (need to find the screenshot again)</p>
