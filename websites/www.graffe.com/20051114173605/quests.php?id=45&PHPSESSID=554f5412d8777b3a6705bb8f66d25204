Isn't the area 'round 'ere so nice an' quiet? Such a departure from me old days; slaving o'er the forge t'create masterpieces! T'be 'onest, at times I do miss the old forge, but after I created me finest breastplate, it seemed as if nothing else I made could ever live up t'it. So I left me home to'wander the land an' see what I could learn o'the world. I 'ave learned quite a bit from the elders 'ere an' the skilled craftspeople in New Tanaan. I 'ave even devised a type o'emblem that will impart the magic o'tranquility into the user t'create planar armors from pieces o'energy found in the planes.' 
<HR>
<b>You say, 'what emblem?' </b>
<HR>
Bor Wharhammer says 'Well, the emblems dinnae be easy t'craft but I will gladly give ye one fer the price of 500 platinum pieces. They allow a planes traveler with no craftin' skills t'create many fine pieces o'planar armor in a special, magical kit I also 'ave an' will throw in with the price. The kit acts as a focal point fer the wild magic energy o'the Planes. Ye will only be able t'use each emblem an' kit once when ye create the piece, 'owever I dinnae be goin' anywhere soon! Just venture back when ye need another an' dinnae ferget the coin! 
<HR>
<b>You say, 'what silk?' </b>
<HR>
Bor Wharhammer says 'Har! It be quite funny that we be referin' t'silk as armor, fer the amount o'protection it provides be miniscule at best. The planar armor made from strands o'ether can still be quite useful fer its magical properties, 'owever. Ye will need t'take up a Tanaan embroidery needle, a pattern, an emblem an' various amounts o'ether silk swatches t'create a piece. Craft it all within a sewing kit boilin' with magical energy. 
<HR>
<b>You say, 'what swatches?' </b>
<HR>
Bor Wharhammer sighs at you. 'T'make a swatch, ye need t'combine two strands o'ether along with a curing agent in a Tanaan loom. Ye will need t'seek a skilled brew master t'make the curing agent fer ye. Just 'ave them create it by using two celestial essences, soda an' paeala sap' 
<HR>
Handing Bor 500 pp will get you an emblem specific to your class. The ornate molds drop in various zones.
