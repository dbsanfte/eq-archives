    Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: Despite the changes to the Chromadracs dispell, 
    SF is still a spot we can quad in. It takes some time and skill but it is 
    doable. With the Changes to Chromadracs I seriously advise getting Run3 
    before making SF your home for quadding. You get your SoW dispelled and you 
    are in trouble here and will be dead pretty quick. Also try to keep a skin 
    up at all times, mobs hit pretty hard here. <br>
    <br>
    The edges of the zone tend to have a few spots that are not filled with 
    wanderers and tend to be flat without a lot of big boulders in the way. Find 
    these spots and do your quadding runs here. I've done multiple quads with 
    various mobs thrown together and am able to get them all snared with no 
    problem.<br>
    <br>
    If you get a resist or miss a snare on a mob, simply run ahead a little, 
    root it, and then break root by tapping mob with Shock of Ice. Proceed to 
    round up the quad from there, you may or may not have to resnare before all 
    of the mobs drop (I do at 50% health just to be safe)<br>
    <br>
    A note on Chromadracs: While Verant gave them the ability to dispell at 
    casting range this has merely taken them out of the lineup as quadding 
    targets. The agro on Chromas seems to be a very small area. I run over the 
    top of a hill and stop right in front of them all of the time, just be sure 
    to turn tail and run like the wind in the opposite direction.<br>
    Make sure you put your important buffs like SoW, C3, Ageo, etc behind as 
    many dummy buffs as possible. This reduces the chance of accidentally losing 
    them if you aggro a Chroma. If anything, quadding in SF while teach you how 
    to really drive a quad with finesse. What I mean by this is that I prefer to 
    have a full quad when I am kiting so I end up running around a bit tagging 
    mobs here and there to make a full quad. Dodging Chromas and steering my 
    unsnared quad around Chromas has taken quadding to a whole new level for me. 
    Quadding in CS made me complacent, quadding in SF honed my skills to a sharp 
    edge.<br>
    <br>
    Oh yeah, one final note... if you happen to see Talendor and are in the 
    middle of a quad, take you quad away from him and with a quickness. His 
    aggro range is a tad large and you can aggro him by pulling near him.</span><ul>
      <li><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Spell drops and 
      an average of 8pp or so from each mob, occasional gem. Do not go /role or 
      /anon, lots of individuals will pay nicely for TLs here.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Verdana">*Note from Gemdiver: 
    Skyfire is certainly one of the hardest places to quad throughout Norrath. I 
    would recommend quadding here only to veteran wizards.</span></font><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana"><![if !supportLineBreakNewLine]><br>
