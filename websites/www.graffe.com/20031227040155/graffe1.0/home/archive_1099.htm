        about last night's Quest on Povar:<i><br>
        &quot;I made a decision tonight that could possibly have been one of the 
        dumbest decisions of my time playing EQ. King Tearis Thex decided to have 
        a gathering in Felwithe tonight on the Povar server. Upon hearing the 
        news, I zapped myself straight to the GFay spires, and headed off to Felwithe. 
        When I arrived, hoards of players filled the zone (max count of 101, I 
        believe). Nothing happened for quite awhile, but then "A Cute Rat", "A 
        Rat", and "A Gator" appeared in the zone. Some merchants began to shout 
        for us to get rid of them. I decided that I would help, so I proceeded 
        to attack a (what I now know was level 50ish) gator. The guards promptly 
        dispatched me to my bind point (in Dragnor's Cauldron). I laughed, shrugged 
        it off, and began memorizing my spells. Suddenly, I was "summoned by the 
        Gods!" This is about the point where I made my stupid mistake (I think). 
        Where did I end up? I was summoned, by Templeton The Wise, to Tox Forest, 
        just outside the zone to Kerra Isle. Two other players were summoned as 
        well. Templeton started scolding us for attacking the "sacred gator". 
        He said "The king shall slay thee!" I begged for his forgiveness, but 
        he simply shouted "BEGONE!" After that, he said "Poof", and vanished. 
        I stood around for a few minutes (naked), wondering what to do. Finally, 
        I decided to gate back to GFay, and see what was going on in Felwithe. 
        King Tearis Thex came out, and was introduced to his long lost daughter 
        Firiona Vie. They talked for a little while, then the king told us all 
        to go home. This is about the time that I smacked myself on the forehead, 
        and wondered if I should have remained in Tox Forest. I would really like 
        to know what happened in Tox after I hastily gated out. :(<br>

        -- Welcome to Gnomestock '99 -- <br>
        The purpose of this event is to celebrate the discovery of the Third Book 
        of Gimbleston. This book contains many useful and new tinkering formulas, 
        as well as some more words of wisdom from Gimbleston himself. While the 
        location of the book is still only known to a few, those few have been 
        generous enough to share its contents with all gnomes. This act of sharing 
        shows true gnome spirit. I and many others are forever indebted and grateful 
        to this person.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Some events at Gnomestock '99 will include: <br>
        - Fishing with collapsable fishing poles and animated bait. <br>
        - A small fireworks display. (snicker) <br>
        - Free beer and booze for all. <br>
        - High Diving at the great wheel. <br>
        - And just some general, 'Gnomeing about'.</p>
      <p>So come on out and meet everyone! I want to see Ak'anon packed with gnomes, 
        its our heritage, and I hope to see everyone there. <br>
        Time: This Wedensday, Oct. 27 at 7:00 pm e.s.t. <br>

        about our class, try the other avenues first. Try the message board here, 
        or try the <a href="http://www.onelist.com/community/EQ_Wizard" target="_blank">mailing 
        list</a> (this mailing list is not run by me but by onelist.com) to see 
        if anybody is willing to answer your question. If that fails, by all means, 
        e-mail me and I will see what I can do. I really wish I could take the 
        time to answer everyone's questions, but I am losing ground with the site 
        and I really wish to keep up with the content for all of you. I might 
        find another way around this by trying to find a high level wizard that 
        is mature, levelheaded, and willing to answer such questions on his free 
        time. If this pans out, then I'll issue that person his own e-mail address 
        and I will have a bit more time on my hands to work on other aspects of 
        this site and my life. =) Thank you all for understanding!</p>

        pop-up list and that weapon's damage and delay is automatically put into 
        the program. Then you just make a few clicks and you have your comparison. 
        You can still compare duel wield and double attack, and you can also input 
        values manually in case you find a weapon that is not in the included 
        database. The included database has detailed info on all the weapons, 
        including lore and/or magic, classes and races, procs, and any bonuses. 
        You can access all this information if you have Access 97. If you don't 
        have Access, don't worry because the next version will have a feature 
        to show you all this info. Just hit a button and all the information will 
        pop up for you to see. This update should be released in a couple days. 
        I hope you all enjoy this!<br>
        Thanks Nate!<br>

        <i>&quot; In doing this quest, which by the way is very fun, I came across 
        a very rough part. The rod of FANA which is in the bottom of the lake 
        in Oasis. This is at the top of a tower guarded by many, many deepwater 
        goblins. My friend did this alone about a month or so ago at level 35 
        by going invis drinking a flask of enduring breath and swimming up and 
        grabbing it. Well doesn't seem so simple anymore. I tried and died 3 times 
        while trying to get it. he died 2 times. I had to call in the help of 
        my guild, a few level 50's for this. I am level 37 and they smoked me 
        very fast. some hit for 80's and they cast of course. evidently Verant 
        has made these buggers much harder. they can see through invis and when 
        my level 50 ranger showed up, with full Fear Plane gear he was almost 
        killed and he said a lot of them con blue to him. We brought in a level 
        50 cleric to help the ranger kill them so I could safely swim up. fine 
        they wiped them all, about 7 or 8 and the respawn is about 2 mins or less 
        on these things, they are like rabbits they spawn very fast so could be 
        a good spot to hunt because most 30 plus people are doing specs and SG...finally 
        we called in a druid, he cast wolf form on me and the gobs all became 
        apprehensive to me and I could swim right up unharmed and grab the rod. 
        beware if you are doing this and the other level 45 wizard that was showing 
        me around to these rods was shocked at how much harder it was for me to 
        get this rod than it was him just a month or so ago so maybe something 
        was changed in the last patch.&quot;</i><br>

        The quest works for those members who have not had specialization skills 
        reach 50. If you have two or more skill levels over 50, (a small amount 
        of people had skill levels in two or more increase beyond 50 prior to 
        the patch that limited it to one skill level above 50) and only one is 
        increasing now, albeit the wrong one, there is no help for you. One of 
        the GM's, Trailkis, if I remember correctly, is trying to work with Verant 
        trying to get this fixed so that those who have more than one skill level 
        at 50 or above can change their main skill level back to 49. If any who 
        are in this position attempt the quest, they will end up like me and be 
        out the cost of one ruby, which for some can run about 160 pp. Good luck

        the Temple of Solusek Ro:</p>

      <p>This from Nezzar Enkahmin of <clockwork brotherhood> Rodcet Nife :<br>

        <i>&quot;Greetings, I am emailing to let you inform players of the possibility 

        of the Specialization Removal Quest being inop. My character's name is 

        Nezzar, I play on the Rodcet Nife server, and am a level 31 wizard. I 

        followed the quest, giving the ruby to Ostorm like he had asked. He then 

        said that my specialization is now at 49 and I got faction adjustments 

        415 and 416. He then asked for the 50 gold pieces I owed him. I paid him 

        and went on my way. Went to guild, tried to train in it, but it said that 

        it was maxed. While fighting, during a med period, glanced at my skill 

        levels and noticed that my abjuration was average while my evocation was 

        at below average. The skills were not reset. Now, the only thing I can 

        think of is the possibility of the 50 gold pieces being to nullify this 

        effect. I am not sure of this, the 50 gold pieces were in brackets, but 

        only after doing the quest, giving him the ruby, I was in a conversation 

        with another at that time and lost the NPC talk so I could not bring up 

        that dialogue with the NPC Ostorm. If anyone out there is going to do 

        this quest, have them ask about the gold pieces and what they are for 

        before they pay for it. It may be that it cancels the effect. Warn the 

        others. I have submitted a feedback after I noticed it, (I had done a 

        petition, but the 2 GM's online got off line before answering my petition), 

        and I am waiting on an email from Verant if they respond. Thank you&quot;<br>

        </i>Thank you Nezzar!</p>

      <p>This from Solice:<br>

        <i>&quot;In the temple. Beware the genie </i>(Tazgar, the Efreeti)<i>. 

        If you hail him you take a faction hit. You should be able to identify 

        him. He is the one surrounded by corpses. It seems to have a varrying 

        effect. But 2 different reports. One person hailed him over and over and 

        the whole temple turned to warmly. Another did it and the whole temple 

        went aggro on him. Just be wary, even hailing him causes a faciton adjustment.&quot;<br>

        </i>Thank you Solice!</p>

      <p>If you do mess up your faction somehow, killing off Shadowmen will raise 

        your faction with the inhabitants of the Temple.</p>

        to me and I am a Dark Elf that kills most anything that moves. The lava 
        within the zone does inflict damage. A tip to get info from our quest 
        givers: turn on your log file and stand near both of the NPC's (Vilissia, 
        and Gardern). There will be so many people spamming, it is too hard to 
        catch all of the details. Once you have stood there long enough, log off 
        and go read your log file for the quest info. I also took it upon myself 
        to update the map I had for the Temple to show where the Wizard quest 
        NPC's are.. view it <a href="../maps/_temple_of_solusek_ro.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>.

        find it not up. My partner in crime, Keiote, and I sat outside the zone 

        for a bit until the server wide message came through that Xegony was coming 

        down for a server-side patch. So, here I am posting a picture of the waiting 

        line to get into the zone. Looks like a bunch of quest hungry people out 

        there. If you wish to submit any quest info, please take your time with

        of this info to the General Message Board. I have confirmed it so I will 

        post it here so all can read: If you are still not able to speak to Sulgar 

        within Everfrost Peaks concerning the Ice Comet Quest, there is only one 

        thing you can do... and that is petition so that a full GM can help you. 

        There is faction that Sulgar is based on called 'beta-neutral'. Everyone 

        that cannot talk to Sulgar is trying to find a way to raise this faction. 

        This is a faction in game that is not supposed to change so that anybody 

        can speak to NPC's with this type of faction.. no matter what they have 

        killed in the past. Apparently, there was a mob within Mistmoore (a werewolf) 

        that did effect this faction when killed. This mob has been fixed but 

        unfortunately, before it was, it effected a few Wizards out there. So, 

        if you wish to have this corrected... write a nice petition stating your 

        problem with Sulgar and maybe.. just maybe if your server's GM is online 

        and feeling kind, they will help you out. There is no promises and don't

        the Temple of Solusek Ro: I've seen a few upset people on the message 

        boards, within my e-mails, and over on the Wizard Mailing List concerning 

        the lack of Wizard quests within the upcoming zone of the Temple of Solusek 

        Ro. I posted to the mailing list saying not to get upset yet because the 

        zone is not completed. In saying that, it seems some changes have already 

        taken place within the new zone. Tirion of Povar sent in this e-mail:<br>

        <br>

        &quot; After I heard there wasn't any wizard quests in the temple I decided 

        I had to take a look for myself before I believed it. I found two npc's 

        on the balcony opposite of the mage's quest. Gardern gives the quests 

        for Staff of Temperate Flux and Weeping Wand and Vilissia gives quests 

        for Runescale Cloak, Tishans Kilt and Acumen Mask. Gardern seems a bit 

        bugged... I can't get past the first hail, but Vilissia is working fine.</p>

      <p>Vilissia will make the Runescale Cloak if you give her a Lizardscale 

        Cloak and three Runes of Scale. The runes can be found on saltwater crocs 

        in Guk, deepwater caiman in Oasis and firescale crocs in Rath Mountains. 

        For Tishans Kilt, which I am assuming is going to be a lower magic resist 

        effect on it, you need to take a Shadowed Ball, from shadow men, to Trankia 

        in Everfrost (I am assuming it continues from there.) And for the Acumen 

        Mask she wants a Glowing Mask from a Skel Monk in Guk, Patch of Shadow, 

        Darkbone Skull from Unrest and a Bonechipped Mask from a Goblin Headmaster 

        in OOT. &quot;</p>

      <p><img src="purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="9">Qenelin Bu'Khma mailed 

        in some information and pics of the new upcoming zone, Temple of Solusek 

        Ro. Here is an exerpt of his info and the pics to follow:</p>

      <p>&quot;....The zone is very small. I've found one secret passage, leading 

        me to Tazgar (a cool looking NPC who did not answer Hails) and barring 

        more, the whole zone is the size of Northern Felwithe, if not smaller. 

        I must admit, it was beautiful to behold. The furniture and buildings 

        looked great . So why was I disappointed? Well, first of all there are 

        NO WIZARD QUESTS, that I could find. All I found were Cleric, Mage, Enchanter 

        and Necromancer quests. Classes that already have an abundance of quests, 

        if you ask me. Not that I'm against, but Wizards got the shaft, once again, 

        and that angers me. Moreover, all the quests were similar to the crafted 

        armor quests - bring me this and that and I'll give you this and that 

        armor/weapon/spell. Nothing to think about, nothing to explore, just straightforward 

        "go camp that mob" quests. Finally, there are just not that many quests. 

        Qeynos has more quests than this, I am sure. Oh yeah, there is one guy 

        who will (assumingly) erase your specialization. This is for those who 

        went over 50 on the wrong skill and want to change it. No big deal.&quot;</p>
