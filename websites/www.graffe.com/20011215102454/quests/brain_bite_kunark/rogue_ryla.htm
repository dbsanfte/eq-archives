      <p>Get a rogue to either Firiona Vie or The overthere. Get the rogue bound 
        at that location. Best to have some SOW potions in the bank. Drink an 
        SOW potion and have another on hand incase the first runs out. Hide and 
        Sneak on all the way to Karnors. Do a quick /ooc or /shout to find out 
        if the human skel is up on anyone's tracking. Once moving into Karnors 
        don't stop for anything. Hide and Sneak on, head strait accross the bridge 
        and through the gate area. Turn left and then go up the stairs that will 
        shortly be on the right. At the top of the stairs go left. When you get 
        to the outside of the wall turn right and go all the way to the end. At 
        that point your only option will be to turn right. (I can't remember from 
        there the written directions to the jail, you just need to get to the 
        jail). Go to the second cell on the right. Open the door and go in. Go 
        to the corner as far from the door as possible. Note: from here you must 
        not be in full screen mode, time is very precious and you can not afford 
        even the miniscule delay of the screen switching modes for the trade window. 
        Turn so that the skel is on the left side of the screen, again to save 
        time moving the cursor to the give button. Pick up the jar from your inventory 
        and move it over the skel. Now double click. Two clicks are needed because 
        the first does nothing but kill your hide and sneak. Quickly move the 
        cursor to the give button and click. Right about then the Drolvarg in 
        the cell across the hall will kill you. After you pop back up at your 
        bind point get an SOW potion or two from the bank and get back to Karnors 
        the same way you went the first time. Once inside follow the same path 
        to the jail, again hiding and sneaking. Even if you can see your corpse 
        through the wall you have to get to right in front of the door to start 
        draging it. Drag your corpse to the zone and loot it. Viola! One bottle 
        of swirling smoke. </p>
      <p>Note: very infrequently one of the little drolvargs in Karnors will see 
        you while hiding and sneaking and you will die an extra time. Don't sweat 
        it and don't run for the zone, even if you make it your just going to 
        piss off several people by training a bunch of mobs to the zone line. 
        Just make the slow run again. </p>
      <p>This was done with a level 8 rogue, but level 6 is all thats really needed 
        to make sure the corpse lasts long enough, though I recommend at least 
        level 7 to make sure you don't drop to 5 in the process. </p>
      <p>Oh and if anyone on the Cazic Thule server wants me to get this one for 
        them with my rogue at the overthere I'll gladly do it. For an exorbatant 
        price of course ;) </p>

      <p>Note from Graffe-</p>
      <p>For those who are asking, &quot;Great. I've got a bottle on a level 7 
        rogue. Now what do I do with it?&quot; There is a trick that works with 
        all quests. Anyone can turn in any number of items that are required for 
        a quest, but to get the finished quest item, the person that wants to 
        receive it must be the last person to hit 'GIVE'.</p>
