  <p align="center">The Quest starts at Lawlya, a wurm found at the top of 
  skyshrine very near Yelinak. You must be of kindly or higher faction in order 
  to do this quest.</p>

  <hr noshade>

      <blockquote>
        <p>You say, 'hail Lawyla'</p>
        <p>Lawyla says 'Hail and well met Ninan . I can see by your appearance 
        that you are well traveled. I congratulate you on your thirst for 
        adventure as you are obviously far from where you call home. Would you 
        happen to study the art of Sorcery? </p>
        <p>You say, 'yes, i study the art of sorcery'</p>
        <p>Lawyla says 'Then I believe you would be interested in hearing of the 
        sad tale of our beloved Hsagra. Many years ago, Hsagra was slain by the 
        wicked Kromzek Porlos. Unfortunately, Porlos found out that Hsagra had 
        discovered a new magic that was extremely powerful against the Giants. 
        Hsagra was the mate of Yelinak. You might have heard the tale of Yelinak, 
        for he still lives with the terrible memory of the horrid day that he 
        lost his wingmate. The Giants even have the gaul to have made the throne 
        of King Tormax out of the skull of Hsagra. Do you wish to avenge Hsagra 
        after what I have told you? </p>
        <p>You say, 'i wish to avenge hsagra'</p>
        <p>Lawyla says 'The Kromzek have been a bane upon our very existence for 
        far too long. If you wish to aid our cause, I will need proof of your 
        devotion and allegiance. We will not waste our time educating anyone who 
        does not have our best interests at heart. The journey will prove very 
        dangerous both to you as well as whom you choose to accompany you. After 
        knowing this, do you still want to prove your allegiance? </p>
        <p>You say, 'yes, i wish to prove my allegiance'</p>
        <p>Lawyla says 'Before I divulge the secret behind the sorcery against 
        the Kromzek, I require three items from you, and you alone. Please also 
        keep in mind I will need to combine these 3 items together, so I will 
        not accept them individually. First, we must start out with the 
        teachings of Relinar, for it is necessary in recreating the magic 
        against the vile giants. Our lorekeeper is one you must seek out to 
        acquire those teachings, He resides within the confines of our dwelling.
        </p>
        <p>You say, 'who is the lorekeeper'</p>
        <p>Lawyla says 'Jualicn is the one that you seek. Ask him of Relinar and 
        he will guide you in acquiring the teachings of our Relinar who 
        rediscovered the lost magic that once belonged to Hsagra. Once you have 
        all of the items in hand that are needed to recreate this powerful 
        spell, come back and we will continue this discussion then. Until that 
        point, our business here is done. May you be blessed in your efforts to 
        assist in the annihilation of the Kromzek. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Jualicn is the dragon we passed just before Lawyla.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>You say, 'hail Jualicn'</p>
    <p>Jualicn says 'Why hello there Ninan . I do not see many that pass through 
    these chambers unless they are trusted. What brings you before me today? </p>
    <p>You say, 'i wish to acquire the teachings of relinar'</p>
    <p>Jualicn says 'In order to receive the teachings, you need to gather four 
    runes from the descendants of Relinar. Each descendant of Relinar has one of 
    the four runes. You will find them where they stand six abreast in the 
    wasteland. However in order to know that you have my blessing you must 
    present them with a treasure that they would know came from me. </p>
    <p>You say, 'treasure'</p>
    <p>Jualicn says 'I do have an ancient token that I have carried with me for 
    quite some time. It is very special to me, but if you have been sent here by 
    Lawyla then you must be worthy, for she is quick to see through the lies 
    that some believe will gain them admittance to our halls. Please take this 
    and present it to each of the descendants so that they will know you are 
    truthful when you say that you were sent by me. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>You now have the
  <a onclick="MM_openBrWindow('jualicns_token.jpg','jualicntoken','width=330,height=145')" href="javascript:;">
  Jualicn token</a>.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>You say, 'who are descendants of relinar'</p>
    <p>Jualicn says 'Another Wizard joining our ranks? Excellent. Listen closely 
    Ninan . I will give you the Lexicon of Relinar, a great and well remembered 
    Sorcerer whose teachings are necessary in constructing a spell that is very 
    powerful against the Giants. I will give you his ancient lexicon which can 
    harness his teachings if you can carry this large tome. You may need to 
    rearrange your belongings. Are you ready to receive the Lexicon? </p>
    <p>You say, 'i am ready to receive the lexicon'</p>
    <p>Jualicn says 'Combine the four in this lexicon and you will then have the 
    teachings of Relinar. After you have done this, you are required to speak 
    again with Lawyla about the problems we are having of late with Kromzek 
    spies. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>You will now be given back the Jualicn Token and you will also recieve a
  <a onclick="MM_openBrWindow('lexicon_of_relinar_stats.jpg','lexiconofrelinarstats','width=330,height=145')" href="javascript:;">
  Lexicon of Relinar</a> (be sure to have one main slot empty in your inventory 
  because the the lexicon is a container.. therefore it won't fit in another 
  container). </p>
  <p>Now go back to Lawyla -</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>You say, 'what problems with Kromzek spies?'</p>
    <p>Lawyla says 'Hello again Ninan . I see that you have spoken to Jualicn. 
    We have been having problems with spies in this area. I require three items 
    in order to recreate the magic necessary to scribe the spell. I need the 
    head of a Kromzek spy, the teachings of Relinar, and finally a scale from 
    Hsagra. In order for the magic of Hsagra to work, we must have some of her 
    remains to complete the components. It is rumored that high ranking Giant 
    Noble that goes by the name Helssen, treasures a scale that came from the 
    body of Hsagra herself. But I believe you will have to kill him in order to 
    take the scale away from him. He resides in the Giant City with the other 
    vile creatures. Bring it to me along with the head of the spy and the 
    Teachings of Relinar and we will conclude our dealings. </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Now move to Western Wastes, the dragons guard the entrance to Temple of 
  Veeshan and find

  Ionat</a> (loc +195.00, +1557.00).</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>You say, 'hail Ionat'</p>
    <p>Ionat says 'Hello Ninan . It is good to see that you have traveled so far 
    to be in my presence. I do believe that you are the one chosen to aid us in 
    our fight against the Giants. If you are then I am sure that you will need 
    my rune for your research. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Give Ionat the Jualicn token -</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Ionat says 'Take this Rune of Revenge Ninan . You will need it to extract 
    retribution in remembrance of our dear Hsagra. I thank you for your 
    contributions to our cause, It is good to have you amongst our ranks. </p>
    <p>Your faction standing with ClawsofVeeshan got better.<br>

    <p>Entariz says 'Greetings Ninan . I have heard that one is amongst us in 
    the lands which will aid us in our cause. If you are the one that seeks my 
    ancient rune for your studies please make sure it is not used in vain. I do 
    not talk to many that pass through here and I feel in my heart that it is 
    you that shall help us. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Give Entariz the Jualicn token -</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Entariz says 'Ah of course Ninan . You will need a Rune of Eradication 
    for your lexicon. We are counting on your loyalty. Remember that you will 
    need to bring the teachings of Relinar to Lawyla for further instructions, 
    as she requires them to pass on the magic to those worthy of it. I bid you 
    farewell Ninan . </p>

    yourself before me without reason. What brings you to these lands on this 
    day? Please be quick for I have many ancient runes I must study. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Give Draazak the Jualicn token -</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Ninan , which Relinar found to be necessary for the success of the magic 
    against those foul Giants. I present this to you with faith that you are

  <p>You now have all four runes. Put the runes into the
  <a onclick="MM_openBrWindow('lexicon_of_relinar_open_with_runes.jpg','lexiconofrelinarfull','width=139,height=266')" href="javascript:;">
  Lexicon of Relinar</a> and combine.</p>

  <p>So you just have to kill now
  <a onclick="MM_openBrWindow('noble_helssen_pic.jpg','noblehelsson','width=660,height=500')" href="javascript:;">
  Noble Helsson</a> in Kael, found next to Wenglawks in the Noble building.</p>
  <p>He cons yellow to Lvl 53, so his lvl is max 55. We took him down with one 
  group, Monk58, Rogue56, Paladin53, Cleric56, Druid57, Wizard60. He dropped a
  <a onclick="MM_openBrWindow('scale_of_hsagra.jpg','scaleofhsagra','width=330,height=145')" href="javascript:;">
  scale of Hsagra</a>.</p>
  <p>Back to Skyshrine, we moved up again very high and found the Kromzek Spy on 
  the icy path before Jualicn at loc 1413,2465,-37. He cons yellow again to lvl 
  53, so again max lvl 55. The icy path is tricky, so keep in mind to have 
  levitation or dead man floating on.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>a kromzek spy says 'Your bones will be crushed by the Kromzek of Kael 
    Drakkel! </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>We took him down with the same group. He dropped the
  <a onclick="MM_openBrWindow('head_of_a_kromzek_spy.jpg','headofakromzekspy','width=330,height=145')" href="javascript:;">
  head of a kromzek spy</a>.</p>
  <p>Now moved the short way to Lawyla and handed over the three pieces from the 
  quest (head, scale, teachings).</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Lawyla says 'Ninan . You are to be commended for your valor and 
    determination in assisting my Kin. Here is the spell that Hsagra died so 
    long ago over. I only ask that each time that you use the sorcery here, that 
    you remember Hsagra in a silent prayer of thanks. For I hope that will help 
    ease Yelinaks still tormented soul from his loss. I bid you farewell. You 
    are welcome amongst our ranks. </p>
    <p>Your faction standing with ClawsofVeeshan got better.<br>
    Your faction standing with Yelinak got better.<br>
    Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse.<br>
    You gain party experience!!</p>

  <p>You get in return, the level 60 spell, Hsagra's Wrath.</p>
