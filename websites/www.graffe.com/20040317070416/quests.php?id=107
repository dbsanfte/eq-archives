  <tr>
    <td width="547"> <p>This is the second of four Sewer trials given by the 
    High Priest in Barindu. Please note you need to have hailed the High Priest 
    before starting this mission. However you can still receive the flag as long 
    as the expedition leader has completed the previous trial.</p>
    <p>
    You'll need to clear towards the furnace room (marked on map). Like in the 
    previous trial you can skip some content by hugging the walls of the rooms 
    and invising/pacifying your way. Along the way you must collect the remains of four Taelosians. 
    They're dropped by random mobs in the zone. </p>
    <p>
    Once you get to the furnace room the ghosts of the four will spawn. Kill 
    them each and wisps will spawn when they die and move out of the room - DO 
    NOT touch the wisps. This is when it gets tricky. A 30-minute timer starts 
    for you to reach the Blue Crystal room (also marked on map). In my 
    experience, the fastest way is to evacuate your group to zone-in and then 
    run back skipping as much of the mobs as possible. You can invis past lots 
    of them, and the ones you can't invis by your bard/enc can pacify. The zone 
    will emote at some point which means you have 15 minutes remaining.</p>
    <p>
    Once you reach the crystal room the four wisps will be on a pedestal and a 
    npc (someone the Pure). Hand him the four remains. You may need to hail at 
    this point but I dont think so. You'll receive a character flag as well as 
    access to the 3rd trial.</p>
