Area Effect spells comprise the bulk of the spells a Wizard has in his book, more than the Direct Damage spells and Bolts of all kinds combined. As one could guess, failure to understand and use these spells will result in a Wizard who is not living up to his full potential and power. This essay is an attempt to help my fellow Wizards understand and use these spells to their best potential without endangering themselves or their party.
<br><br>
Despite their description all too often as 'suicide spells' by some people, Area Effect spells are very powerful and very useful when properly used. First, an examination of their advantages:
<br><br>
<li>Give you better damage for each point of mana than any spell you have. They result in incredible ratios, especially the Point Blank series, that lets you damage as many targets as you can crowd around you at the same time. 
<li>Can turn a bad situation into a winning one, with or without an enchanter.
<li>Allow the Wizard to contribute significantly in any fight in a way that few if any classes can. Wizard AE spells have better mana ratios and more variety than any other class. 
<li>Make you feel damn powerful. 
<li>Allow you to function as more than simply a cannon. 
<li>Clear those out stupid, swarming aggro greens faster and better than anything else in the game. 
<li>You can damage the entire crowd of guys enough that they all drop faster, if done right sometimes you can hurt them all so bad the tanks can nearly one-hit each creature, which makes them feel pretty good too.
<br><br>
However, it would be foolish to ignore that AE has inherent dangers and drawbacks, and to have a complete picture, their problems must be examined as well:
<br><br>
<li>Dangerous to use without crowd control, caution must always be taken in when they are used and how.
<li>Use up a lot of mana. Yes, they are mana efficient against a lot of targets, but they also suck mana like a firehose, and you have to be very careful not to overuse them. 
<li>Can Slow down people's computers. The more modern particle effects are less troublesome for computers, but older systems may still have problems. If you want to use these a lot, advise your group to shut off the particle rate in their Display Options. Spells will not show up most of the time (in fact there will be times you will be mystified whether any spells are going off at all). 
<li>With only a few resistances things go from a manageable fight to a total party wipeout very quickly.
<li>Aren't always feasible with crowding and camping. The situation will often not allow you to intentionally pull more than 1-2 guys at once, which isn't exactly AE heaven. 
<li>Few groups like to pull multiple targets and will actively resist using AE spells. One target at a time for steady, safe experience is the catchword for a game that erases hours of play time with a single death.
<li>You can end up pulling every monster in a dungeon because some walls, floors, and ceilings ‘leak’ aggro through them (more on this below). This is less of a problem in newer areas, but there still are a few spots you'll find sometimes.
<li>Most Area Effect spells will hurt you if you are in their radius. Remember you have a fraction the hit points of your enemy. 
<li>On PVP servers, AE spells hit your friends (except teams, where they hit the races you are supposed to be enemies with but not friendly ones). Pets will aggro on the caster on PVP servers when they are hit by AE spells.
<br><br>
General Area Effect Strategy
<br><br>
Area Effect spells require somewhat more thought than your usual blast to get the best effect from. Too often, people think of an AE spell as being like a grenade, you pull the pin, throw it at your enemy; they fly all over the place and die. In Everquest NOTHING works that well unless the targets are so weak to be nearly harmless to you in the first place. To use Area Effect Spells properly, consider them to be a DD that hits multiple targets, nothing more, nothing less.
<br><br>
There are a few things that a good Wizard will keep in mind with the use of Area Effect spells: 
<br><br>
<li>Know Your Radius - learn and understand the radius of each type of AE spell so you can predict and control who and what you affect with it. Each one has a different area that it affects, which means they vary by their proper use 
<li>Know Your Setting - some areas are totally deadly to use Area Effect in. Unrest, for example, has very thin walls and floors, ceilings, which means casting an AE in the wrong spot will result in something running in from possibly even another floor, bringing all his friends. 
<li>Watch your Hits - you can tell how many targets you have in your area and how many you struck, if you only hurt a couple, this tells you something about their resistances and if you missed any. If you hit more than you can see, you probably just made a train, be ready.
<li>Z-Axis Control - Another thing to remember is that Area Effect spells have some odd errors with up and down (the z-axis) due to the way the game perceives things. In some places, something far, far above you will be considered in the radius of the AE, as if it was an infinite column into the sky. This doesn't come up much, but in Kedge Keep, for instance, you can make some very unpleasent enemies by using them. 
<br><br>
With this in mind, to use AE properly they should be considered to be slightly higher power than their damage listed in terms of aggro. Do not simply open up with an AE spell any more than you would a blast, let the monsters get good and angry at the puller and tank. This will keep the main target monster from aggroing on you, and usually, if you are back a fair distance, the other monsters in the area will not aggro either. These rules are a good general help for all AE spells. 
<br><br>
The true challenge, more than learning to use these spells properly, is to get your group to be willing to let you use them. Groups are very likely to be locked into the “single pull” philosophy, rejecting any attempt to use Area Effect spells.
If there is a multiple pull, experiment with your group. 
<br><br>
Try to get them to bunch up adds or multiples and to split the tanks up between the targets rather than root or mez to separate them. In many if not most cases, especially before level 50, it is a valid tactic to kill several creatures at once rather than single pulls. The result is really very little more mana used by you or the Cleric and faster kills, and when people see that this can work and is rewarding, they will be more likely to try it again.
<br><br>
Unfortunately past level 50, it becomes increasingly more difficult to get groups to let you use AE spells because the creatures are so deadly that an uncontrolled add (in their opinion) is not worth the potential benefit. Groups will prefer charming or mezing, or even rooting adds and taking them on one at a time. Some will even kick you out for trying to use AE (note those people and avoid them in the future).
<br><br>
AE Radius <br>
Radius AE spells are in two basic types, the first is usually called the Pillar or Column line. This sort will hit up to 4 targets at range, and have a smallish area of 15 feet in which they explode in immediately. This is more of the ‘grenade’ idea for Area Effect spells, or like a Fireball spell in Dungeons and Dragons.
<br><br>
The second is the Al'Kabor spell line. This line has a larger area, and can affect one more target (five total) but cost a VERY large amount of mana, and are not especially popular. Al’Kabor spells do so poor damage for the mana that they really are only useful in a few very limited settings and against greens or at best very light blue at very high level.
<br><br>
Al'Kabor spells do have their uses, they aren't utterly worthless. For example, they can be used to clear out an entire smaller room of greens in one shot, they just glow sparkles and fall over. This can be useful for farming trade skill supplies, for instance. Overall, though, Al'Kabor AE spells are going to spend a lot of time in your spellbook without even a second glance.
<br><br>
In general, Radius AE spells tend to put fewer graphics on the screen, and as such don't annoy the party as much, although some are very busy and laggy. The Pillar Line also does the most damage to each target of all the Area Effect spells (at least, in a single pulse). 
<br><br>
Here’s how to use your Radius AE spells intelligently in a group:
<br><br>
<li>First, make sure your group knows what you are going to do, so there isn’t any confusion. The last thing you want to do is AE a mesmerized crowd of monsters – they will aggro on the Enchanter and not you.
<li>Control your burn like you would with a normal blast, you will often be able to hit creatures not actually being attacked and not aggro them. 
<li>Pick the target the main tank is taunting. Everyone’s aggro should be on that one target, and when you drop your AE spell, the other monsters nearby the main target will tend not to aggro on you if that one will not.
<li>If you can, get a tank on each target, or at least split tank as much as possible. This will control aggro significantly better.
<li>Another secret is that if someone else is blasting them with AE spells the aggro can often act as if you are negating each other, not building up, so that you can alternate between targets and drop them all. This is far from foolproof, and you are always best off with someone to control the aggro, and can only work if you have a main target that the tank is taunting
<li>Stay at the maximum range you can manage in the setting, because range affects aggro.
<br><br>
Pillar AE spells are usually your best spell to use against multiple targets in an ordinary group. For example, if you see a creature and his pet, these will damage the pet and the master without aggroing the main creature and probably killing the pet outright. As a general rule of thumb, the only time you'll want to pull out a Radius AE is while Quadding (might get to that later) or if you have 3-4 targets. For only 2 targets, your most recent AE Rain spell can do more damage - if not resisted. The post-50 AE Radius spells will do more damage than any single blast you have other than Ice Comet, to each target. They just cost a lot of mana and have a radius so they are less convenient to use.
<br><br>
AE Rain <br>
Area Effect Rain Spells do damage to everything adjacent to the target in three separate waves of damage like a storm. The Radius of AE Rain Spells is from 15-25 feet, usually larger than the Pillar Line of AE spells, but like them, rains hit a maximum of four targets. Rain Spells are similar to a Damage Over Time spell in the sense that they continue to have effect after casting unlike a DD spell. However, AE Rain is a totally unique creature, with its own unique advantages and limitations. 
<br><br>
When cast, an Area Effect Rain Spell will cause a wave of damage to each target under it, and then every three seconds or so another wave takes effect on the area targeted up to three maximum. Each wave is resisted separately, and monsters are able to physically walk out of the radius at any time.
<br><br>
Because their damage is low for each pulse, and the rain waves are spaced apart, with a good damaging group, you can often get the spell off without angering the target. However, due to the design of AE Rain spells, if all three waves hit you will do more damage than any single target blast of the same level range. Post 50 especially these do a tremendous amount of damage, more than any single blast you get until level 60.
<br><br>
After level 50, your AE Rain spells (the Tears line) will be your workhorse, they will outdamage any attack spell you have if all three waves hit, and will be the most deadly single target spell you have, ironically. The primary use of AE Rain, in fact, is to kill a single target.
<br><br>
Here’s how to use your AE Rain spells intelligently in a group:
<br><br>
<li>This one seems sort of obvious but stay out of your rain. They hurt. A lot.
<li>A useful trick for avoiding the rain hitting things its not supposed to (mezed creatures, yourself) is to use a party member as the target. You can use this trick to get two targets as well if your group can't quite figure out why you want things bunched up. Pick a target far enough away from you and mezed creatures that they won't be hit, it doesn't matter who as long as your opponent is within the radius. It will go off on your buddy the Paladin or the shaman's pet just as well as it will on the monster.
<li>If you have concussion, squeeze one in as soon as you can (usually about the same time the second wave is hitting, roughly, landing just before the third wave). This will keep the target under control, which is important when creatures summon – you don’t want to be summoned into your own rain.
<li>Stay as close to the monster as you can without being within the actual rain, this will tend to keep the creature in the area even if it aggros on you and comes to vent his anger.
<li>Wait to cast, these spells do a great deal of damage in a rapid succession of attacks that you wouldn’t probably attempt normally with a Draught spell. Usually starting at 80% life or lower is safest.
<li>Rains will bleed through walls and floors etc very badly, be very careful where you use them. The really bad Z-axis problems have been fixed but some still remain, make sure you are safe to use these.
<li>AE Rain spells stay where you cast them, even though the fiery effect can follow the target around for a while.
<li>On two targets, as noted above, AE Rain spells will do more damage for less mana than a Pillar spell, however the resistances make this unpredictable - you'll be happy to see three hits, rather than expect it.
<li>Very large monsters such as Giants are so big that they take up most of the radius of Rain spells, and it is very difficult to get more than one of them in the effect.
<br><br>
At present, and probably for the duration, Rain Spells are, according to past Verant admission*, bugged. They do not hit the proper number of targets with enough waves. Instead of hitting up to 4 targets with 3 waves of effect, the Rain Spells for all classes treat each wave of damage against each target as a separate target... so it will hit 4 times at most.
<br><br>
Thus if you have 3 targets, it hits them both with one wave (3 hits) and then hit one target with one wave (4th hit). This grossly reduces the effectiveness of the spell. This has been petitioned and pleaded to no avail so far, despite earlier promises to work on it.**
<br><br>
One option would be for them to turn the spells into single-target attacks, making the radius meaningless. This would maintain the damage but unpredictability of the spells while making them not useful on multiple targets. If this was done, the damage would need to be raised at lower levels or they would be nearly worthless.
<br><br>
*they may have since changed their minds on the subject, but GZ - Geoffrey Zatkin the game's original spell designer, no longer working for SOE - said twice that the spells were not working properly and actually used the word "bug" describing them in early 2000.
<br><br>
**GZ and Absor both said they'd work on changing them - GZ's comments being more certain - but the only change made so far was to remove pets from the valid target list.
<br><br>
PBAE <br>
Point Blank Area Effect spells damage everything adjacent to YOU, such as what the first level spell Numbing Cold does. For starting Wizards, this spell line can be very puzzling, as it appears to do nothing at all when cast unless something is very close. Unlike the rest of the AE spells, these will not hurt you no matter what, and can only be used when very close to targets.
<br><br>
These can be handy at very low levels to, for example, damage the 3 wasps all buzzing around you. At higher levels it can often be suicide unless you use it in very specific circumstances, as damaging every single monster next to you will tend to make them turn on you.
<br><br>
Wizards get two types of PBAE spells, most of them ranging from 10-12 feet radius around you. This doesn’t give a lot of area to work with (about the height of an Ogre), which limits their use. Two of the PBAE spells Wizards get have a larger area, and are even less mana efficient for their damage: Supernova and Winds of Gelid. The area on these is 35 feet, rather large for an AE spell. 
<br><br>
All PBAE spells have the advantage of hitting any number of creatures in their radius. This can be a rather astounding number, as will be discussed below. They do not need a target, you simply trigger the spell and it goes off, hitting anything nearby it. PBAE spells also do not harm the caster when they go off. However, they can be used to save your friends from a train, by sacrificing yourself and annoying a large number of the train to pay attention to you. This is very heroic and epic, but is suicidal: you will not get away.
<br><br>
These spells can be used in groups but they are probably your worst choice for normal grouping. The damage per mana efficiency of PBAE spells is the worst of all but the Al’Kabor spells, and they require you to be rather close to the targets. Since creatures aggro more the closer you are to them, this can be very unhealthy, even using the techniques given above for the Radius AE spells.
<br><br>
However Point Blank AE spells when used with a capable Enchanter can be very powerful. 
<br><br>
Very briefly, get an enchanter or two and a healer in your group. Pull as many creatures as you can and feel sane doing, then when they arrive, let the Enchanter use his color line of stun PBAE spells to keep the monsters tame. Chain cast using several Point Blank AE spells, and have the healer watch health and heal anyone who needs it. Use skin and rune spells liberally, and make sure nobody runs because you will be very low on mana in a hurry doing this (the stuns should normally prevent this). If done properly, the group gains a lot of experience in a big hurry because you are killing many monsters at once. Remember though, all it takes is a few resistances (especially on the Enchanters) and you will die, and die fast.
<br><br>
I can post a much more extensive guide on PBAE Grouping if there is any interest, I suspect most Wizards are fairly up to speed on this sort of thing by now.</td></tr></table></body></html>
