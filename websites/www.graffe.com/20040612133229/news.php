<BR>
Gates of Discord<BR>
-------------------<BR>
- Zone experience modifiers were increased in all zones from Tipt/Vxed and beyond.<BR>
- Natimbi, Qinimi, Barindu, Riwwi, and Ferubi should be tuned more appropriately for their intended level ranges.<BR>
- NPCs will no longer hit for max damage as often. Knights in particular should find it easier to tank the NPCs they previously had difficulty with.<BR>
- Ikkinz -- Guilds no longer have to flag every member in order to complete the Ikkinz trials. Only one person needs to complete all events/raids to start the seventh Ikkinz trial. At that point, all players who complete the seventh trial will get full credit for the zone.<BR>
- NPC innates have been adjusted to behave a little more reasonably.<BR>
- Zone travel has been made easier. Animal aggression was lowered by changing their faction and See Invis percentages were reduced on several NPCs.<BR>
- Spell drops have been increased.<BR>
- Increased the rate of cash drops.<BR>
- The mini bosses in Qvic now have a more appropriate respawn rate.  Their item drop rate has been increased to compensate for this.<BR>
- Breakdown in Communication quest now has improved rewards!<BR>
<BR>
Collision<BR>
-------------------<BR>
More improvements to the collision system should make it a lot more difficult to get stuck.<BR>

Headlines!<BR>
--------------------<BR>
- You now have the ability to remove your own surname!<BR>
- All characters will regen HP faster when sitting!<BR>
- /rewind is back and ready for action!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Surnames<BR>
--------------------<BR>
You can now use the /surname command to remove your own surname and add a new one. Please remember to read the naming policy as listed on EQlive.station.sony.com as it applies to both first names and surnames. You will still need to ask for CS assistance if you wish to have a name with double capitals or special characters. Please note that this command can only be used to remove or change your surname once per week.<BR>
<BR>
HP Regen<BR>
---------------------<BR>
- All characters should now regenerate HP faster when sitting. The longer you sit, the faster you regenerate! <BR>
- You will not receive increased regen while under the effects of a DOT or while feigned.<BR>
- You can now bandage yourself up to 70% of your HP. Folks with the appropriate AA abilities can bandage above 70%.<BR>
- You can now bandage while sitting.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
/rewind<BR>
----------------------<BR>
/rewind is back and should help if you find yourself stuck. This is not an automatic rewind, you will have to execute the command. We are continuing to work on other collision issues and hope to no longer need /rewind in the near future. This command is only able to be used once every 30 seconds, and in order to make use of it, your character will need to be stationary for at least 30 seconds. <BR><br><br>-Eand</ul></div>

<BR>
Headlines! <BR>
<BR>
- A new storybook has arrived! Make sure you read it to find out what Tondal is up to now. <BR>
- A new adventure zone is live on Stormhammer! <BR>
- A new adventure zone has moved from Stormhammer to Live! <BR>
- What are the "HOT SPOTS"? <BR>
- Plane of Knowledge open to everyone! <BR>
<BR>
New Adventure Zone goes to Stormhammer <BR>
----------------------- <BR>
- We have added a new adventure zone which should be a challenge for 2 groups of about 50th level. <BR>
A party of adventurers is missing and was last seen working with the undead. Will you brave the catacombs to find them? <BR>
<BR>
New Adventure Zone moves to Live <BR>
----------------------- <BR>
- The adventure zone currently on Stormhammer will move to live servers. You can visit the Lost Pyramid of Galuuk Korr. This midlevel adventure zone will allow you to explore a monument from the lost elvish city of Takish Hiz! Now you must find what was left beneath the sands. Good luck. <BR>
<BR>
Hot Spots <BR>
----------------------- <BR>
Try out the new Hot Spot zones which give a boost to Experience while adventuring in them, in a similar manner to Paludal Caverns. The current Hot Spots are: <BR>
<BR>
- The Castle of Mistmoore (20th to 30th level) <BR>
- The Lair of the Splitpaw (35th to 45th level) <BR>
- Dulak's Harbor (40th to 45th level) <BR>
- The Tower of Frozen Shadow (30th to 35th level) <BR>
- The Gulf of Gunthak (35th to 40th level) <BR>
- Hate's Fury (55th to 60th level) <BR>
- The Crypt of Nadox (50th to 55th level) <BR>
- The Torgiran Mines (45th to 50th level) <BR>
<BR>
These Hot Spot zones are generally aimed at characters level 20 to 51. The Hot Spot zones will shift from time to time, so watch for messages giving clues as to where the new ones may be. <BR>
<BR>
Plane of Knowledge <BR>
----------------------- <BR>
All EQ characters can now access the Plane of Knowledge whether they have purchased Planes of Power or not! <BR>
<BR>
General <BR>
----------------------- <BR>
- We have decreased load times when zoning. <BR>
<BR>
Gates Sewers and Vxed <BR>
----------------------- <BR>
- Rare NPCs in the Gates sewers and Vxed will not spawn at the creation of the expedition zone. They will now spawn after the zone has been occupied for some time. <BR>
<BR>
Items <BR>
----------------------- <BR>
- Skill percent-mods now work for Ammo slot items. <BR>
- Grand Tunic of the Oracle and the Grand Robe of the Oracle have had a type 7 augmentation slot added to them. <BR>
- Lungi of the Forbidden will display a robe graphic once again. Monks and Beastlords will be able to swap the robe in for a leather looking BP with the same stats by visiting Garath the Trader in East Wastes. You will be able to swap the items back and forth with Garath for your desired look. (Lungi? Lungi? What is a Lungi?) <BR>
<BR>
Spells <BR>
----------------------- <BR>
- Characters in illusion form can again be targeted. <BR>
- Bull Rush is now a magical resist. Please do not use in a china shop. <BR>
- Balance of the Nihil has had its Mana and Slow percentage increased. <BR>
<BR>
Tracking <BR>
----------------------- <BR>
- More NPC's in Qinimi now leave tracks for trackers to find. <BR>
<BR>
Firiona Vie <BR>
----------------------- <BR>
- The Shuriken of Eternity and Ton Po's Mystical Pouch are now no-drop.<BR><br><br>-Eand</ul></div>
