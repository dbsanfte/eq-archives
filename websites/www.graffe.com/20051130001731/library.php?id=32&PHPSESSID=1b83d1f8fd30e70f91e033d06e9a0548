    Minimum Level: 29<br>
    Maximum Level: 34<br>
    Zone Name: Great Divide<br>
    Camp Area/LOC: Tizmak Caves #1-#3, (Left on the wall from the waterfall)<br>
    Mob List (HP): Tizmaks of all Shapes and Sizes<br>
    Availability (1->10): 10<br>
    Loot Ranking (1->10): 4 <br>
    Diff.Ranking (1->10): 6 <br>
    Faction Affected: Lowers Tizmak faction, which cannot be re-raised, but 
    serves no useful purpose other than keeping them from agro-ing you if you 
    run by them later.<br>

    Fairly good place to learn to quad as there is very little chance of getting 
    an add unless you've hosed your Coldain faction somehow by this level. You 
    usually have to pull them down off the hill to the flatter land otherwise 
    you get targeting issues. I use Column of Lightning and drop them in about 
    five casts. Cave #1 has a LOT of Tizzies. You can usually pull the four at 
    the entrance with no problem though. Cave 2 only has two spawns at the 
    entrance so it's good, safe, steady kiting. Cave 3 has from 3-4 mobs, 
    depending on where the runner is.</span><p>

    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">I've never had a 
      problem getting one of the three caves. One of them is almost always open.</span></li>
      <li><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">They sometimes 
      drop velium weapons that will sell for 3-6 plat in Shadowhaven. No coin, 
      though.</span></li>
      <li><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">They run fast. 
      Will also get a caster sometimes that can ruin a quad. </span></li>
