			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I hope you enjoyed March, because things are going to get quiet for awhile. Each month will at least have one big game, but don't expect the volume of March.<br />
<br />
I guess the biggest game this month is <b>The Elder Scrolls Online</b>, which says a lot about this month. With so few other games to choose from, will people hold steadfast in their determination not to play it, or will people get curious and end up giving it a shot? Also big this month is the PC version of <b>Dark Souls II</b>, if it actually comes out. I haven't seen clear confirmation that it's going to be released on schedule. Will it keep the advanced lightning techniques seen in the pre-release demos, or will it suffer the same downgraded visual state as the PS3 and 360 versions?<br />
<br />
<b>Child of Light</b>, the storybook rpg that I have been hyping lately is due this month, as is the 360 version of <b>Titanfall</b>, <b>Tropico 5</b>, and a few other things that don't really warrant going into further detail on. That's not to say they aren't worth your attention, but that's going to have to be something you decide on yourself. Check the spoiler tag below and see if anything interests you.<br />
<br />
I will say, though, that the Vita is starting to become the system to get if you want weird Japanese (read: anime) shit. The PS3 and 3DS gets that stuff from time to time, but 2014 has had announcement after announcement of these sorts of games for the Vita. I think the ease of accessing digital titles on the system has been a boon for this kind of niche game.<br />
<br />
April gets two: <b>Demon Gaze</b>, which I actually don't know much about as I'm pretty sure it was only announced a couple of weeks ago; and <b>Conception II: Children of the Seven Stars</b> (also for 3DS), a game which has drawn comparison to Persona, except instead of fusing tarot cards together to create demons, you pair up with a girl of your choice and create magical star children who combine to form giant robots. As weird as it sounds, what I've seen of it so far is kind of light as far as jrpg perversion goes, and is mostly just Japanese branded innuendo and jokes. <br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Meh, my home desktop kicked the bucket last Sunday.  :(<br />
<br />
Power supply fried and I was hoping that would be it, but no such luck.  After replacing it, still no video.  I borrowed my wife's video card and still nothing, and I'm not getting any error code beeps at boot that would signify RAM issues, so I'm pretty certain its the motherboard.  /sigh.<br />
<br />
It was a good machine for 3-4 years though I think.  It has a Geforce 9800 in it from back when they were new if that gives any indication how old the machine was.<br />
<br />
But I guess this provided an opportunity to finally upgrade to a SSD hard drive like a couple of the threads around here keep tempting me.  :p<br />
<br />
So we went ahead and just ordered a new barebones.  Don't have the cash to go nuts on a state of the art gaming machine, but I think this will provide a substantial upgrade nonetheless.  With only brief researches, we went with:<br />
<br />
Barebones w/ AMD Fusion APU (Socket FM2)<br />
  w/ AMD APU A8-5500 (4 x 3.7GHz CPUs - plus Radeon 7560D GPU)<br />
  Asus A88XM-A<br />
  Systems - CPU Fan Only<br />
  8GB DDR3 1600MHz (1 x 8GB - Single Module)<br />
  64GB SATA3 Solid State Drive (SSD)<br />
  Standard Value Mid-Tower Case<br />
  400 Watt Power Supply<br />
  nVidia Geforce GT610 - 1GB<br />
<br />
I'll be using the CDROM and additional fans from my old system and the 650W power supply we just bought to put in this new one.<br />
<br />
Total damage was $450 through PortaTech, who I've used many times in the past with success, which seemed reasonable.<br />
<br />
I'd welcome any pro's or con's about the motherboard, processor and video card we selected if anyone has any though.<br />
<br />
I was a little concerned about how big of a pain it would be transferring my OS over using Windows 8, but holy shit, that was a welcome surprise.  A quick Google search resulted in a very easily found link that I just popped my activation code into and immediately downloaded the setup files, and it also provided the option of temporarily extracting them to a thumb drive and making it bootable.  Schweeet!<br />
<br />
Its supposed to be here late next week.<br />
<br />
:)</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>This one is for the books. I guess I'll start with this:<br />
<br />
Between Lowe's and Home Depot (and I'll even put in Harbor Freight for the sake of argument), I get more satisfaction out of anything I purchase from there than just about any of its competitors. I can go in and simply say, &quot;Toe Grills, HVAC&quot; and they say, &quot;End of Aisle 15.&quot; <br />
<br />
Well, I had the worst experience Thursday (Last) Night, and ended up writing an e-mail about it.: <br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			: I had the absolute worst customer experience today in the Tool<br />
Rental/Repair department.<br />
<br />
I brought my Ridgid LSA 18v Battery and charger in to get looked at. It<br />
was coming up as &quot;Defective&quot; in its charging base.<br />
<br />
When I walked into the Tool Rental/Repair Department, I noticed there<br />
was one customer ahead of me who was having a problem with a tool<br />
rental.<br />
<br />
I stood there for 40 minutes while the cashier called for a &quot;Code<br />
Orange&quot; or &quot;Orange Alert&quot; to Tool Rental 3, perhaps 4, maybe even 5<br />
times. No one ever came.<br />
<br />
She then contacted the store ASM - His name was David. It sounded as<br />
though he would be over  there as soon as he was doing whatever it was<br />
that he was doing.<br />
<br />
The associate (Her name was Tiffany) continued to try and assist this<br />
customer. Then another associate came around (I believe her name was<br />
Athena). Then a man (whose name I did not see on  a tag), he seemed a<br />
bit exasperated himself, he was dressed in all black and no<br />
identification of a Home Depot uniform at all) arrived. They all<br />
attempted to assist Tiffany, but not one person engaged the two<br />
customers ahead of me, nor myself.<br />
<br />
They all llooked at me. THey all observed I was falling asleep on the<br />
Makita 2&quot; Rotary Hammer, they just didn't ask what I was there for, with<br />
my Ridgid battery and charger in hand.<br />
<br />
Tiffany at one point said, &quot;He's gotta be here for LSA.&quot; to which I<br />
finally said, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Athena eventually left the scene after about 5 minutes, to no avail, nor<br />
to return again, after bidding herself adieu and saying, &quot;Gotta love<br />
computers.&quot; The gentleman in black literally vanished. I don't know<br />
when, exactly, he left nor how. Eventually David, the ASM arrived and<br />
without making a single bit of eye contact with any customer in line,<br />
nor observing audibly, nor olfaction or other sense, looked things over<br />
with Tiffany, said it was OK, and then dismissed himself. He didn't even<br />
observe there were customers in line.<br />
<br />
At this point, I knew there was something seriously wrong in the retail<br />
machinery to know that it was not just Tiffany who was undertrained for<br />
this department.<br />
<br />
After making a resolution, which wasn't a resolution, as she and the<br />
customer being worked on decided to have a go at it tomorrow, the couple<br />
in front of me was quickly taken care of, and then it was my turn.<br />
<br />
Mind you, 50 minutes transpired and still not a single associate has<br />
arrived in the Tool Rental/Repair department to engage the &quot;Code<br />
Orange/Alert.&quot; Good thing someone's hand didn't get caught in a Tiller,<br />
I'd hate to see how long it would take for someone to figure out how to<br />
dial 911.<br />
<br />
So, with me finally being dealt with, Tiffany called someone for<br />
assistance who walked her through the new process of how to get into the<br />
Ridgid LSA information screen.<br />
<br />
I just got done picking up my RIDGID drill for service with Gabriel the<br />
week before, so I figured this part should go by quickly.<br />
<br />
While trying to &quot;click on the big E&quot; (Internet Explorer) Tiffany kept<br />
becoming obfuscated that the process of getting to the warranty website<br />
wouldn't work.<br />
<br />
She tried several times, and it wouldn't work. She exasperatedly said,<br />
&quot;I'm going to try on this computer.&quot; She went to another computer and I<br />
could see she was getting into Internet Explorer, but instead of opening<br />
the website through the URL Input Field, she was inputting it in the<br />
HomeDepot.Com Website Product Search Bar.<br />
<br />
I instructed her how to use Ctrl+O to open a dialog for a URL to be<br />
entered. After 15 minutes of additional waiting, this FINALLY got us to<br />
the place we needed to be - only it didn't.<br />
<br />
This website needed my customer number. A number whose records was<br />
nowhere retained anywhere. There was no paperwork anywhere that she<br />
could find. She tried calling Gabriel who said he didn't ahve that<br />
information anymore.<br />
<br />
Perhaps this is neither Home Depot's fault, nor her fault, nor<br />
Gabriel's. Perhaps the associates who came in to help Tiffany could<br />
instead had asked the people in line what they could do for them.<br />
<br />
Perhaps some associates could have come to assist in the Orange Alert?<br />
<br />
Perhaps everyone coudl have been trained to assist in the situation<br />
more?<br />
<br />
Regardless, I asked Tiffany what I would need to do after I got the<br />
Customer # from Ridgid - without an answer to apply a resolve to, she<br />
said she didn't know. She said she wasn't sure if she had to take the<br />
battery and send it off, or if they just sent a new one.<br />
<br />
Great. So in the ultimate end-all resolve, I wasted 1 hour and 30<br />
minutes for absolutely nothing. I'm still going to have to call RIDGID<br />
tomorrow during normal business hours in order to get my customer<br />
number, just so that I can bring it back in and wait for a resolution<br />
someone might not have at that very moment.<br />
<br />
Things to fix. BIG Things to fix. BIG.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>So, I called RIDGID this morning. My phone ran out of juice yesterday, and I dropped it off at home and put it on the charger before heading over to Home Depot. I ran in, thinking it would be quick - why would I need my phone? Well, had I my phone on me, I coudl have logged into either my google drive, or gmail and found my product registration confirmation from RIDGID, and gotten it all resolved right then and there - only I didn't have my phone, and the associate who let me use her computer had a firewall against google. Fuckin' Great. SO that lead me to the situation above. <br />
<br />
<br />
RIDGID had my customer information for me in less than 6 minutes - seriously. After dialing their 800 number, getting transferred to a sweet lil' thang from Ohio, she said I dialed into the wrong department, but had me to a guy with a real nice voice who got me my # from start of phone call to finish in 6 minutes.  That was at 9:45. <br />
<br />
At about 11AM, I got a phone call from Home Depot Corporate Office in Alabama, who said that they were working on my case, and they would get back to me with a resolution. Then I got an e-mail from the same lady who called me, saying exactly the same thing. Mind you, I never really knew what all I had written to Home Depot on their feedback form, because it is so small, did not have a scroller, so I just sort of let it all out. That spiel up there in quotes if First Draft, no rewrites. Personally, I'm sort of impressed with myself. It never has been that easy writing anything the first time (I'll probably rewrite this about 3 times before hitting &quot;Submit Thread.&quot; ) The e-mail sent to me from the Corporate office contained, also, my original feedback -- that spiel above. It was the first time I'd really known what I wrote, and I was sort of nervous about all the name dropping I made. <br />
<br />
Seriously, I used to spend about 10 hours a month in this store before I got transferred. People knew me, and in the last 6 months, alot of employees have changed up, and the day crew (whom I was familiar with) has been replaced with the night crew for my visits, and those are only about once every 2 months. I was very concerned I might be doing others a disservice between they and their employer. <br />
<br />
So, at about 1pm, I get a phone call from The Home Depot around the corner from my house (Oi, I didn't even realize I put in enough information for them to figure out which Home Depot it was). Its the Store's General Manager, he's got me on speaker phone, and he's hearing my account. I know he's doing this with every afflicted party listening - I mean, thats what I would do. <br />
<br />
So I explain everything, and I stress how Tiffany was really trying, REALLY trying to do this, and I was walking her through everything I knew, and she was REALLY trying. <br />
<br />
<br />
I was at work, underground, amazed I even had a signal on my cell phone, but somehow I managed to get some of what he said back into my earpiece; something along the lines of, please head back into the store, we will resolve this, we want you as a customer, we handle 30,000 transactions every single day, and we want every single one of them to be absolutely perfect. SOmetimes this happens, and the fact you wrote an e-mail means everything, you name it, he said it. Followed by something along the lines of &quot;We can do some markdowns, and I'll give you $40 in store credit, and we can go from there.&quot; <br />
<br />
So, after a long day of work, I get to The Home Depot at 6pm, right, exactly, as I said I would be. He told me to go in, ask for David, the Asisstant Store Manager, and he'll make sure everything is resolved. <br />
<br />
In my mind, I wondered if I should just take my battery over to tool repair, get it resolved over there first, and then ask for David. THen, I thought maybe I could go talk to David first, and have his resolution, then it won't feel as awkward while I go to Tool Repair and have them handle the tool thing, and it'll be easy, because its during normal hours,a nd the store manager will be prepped to handle the repair, and everything will be good -- and yeah. Thats how I was thinking. Very circular. Very nervous. Not like myself at all. <br />
<br />
I finally decided to just act like I wasn't even there to see the store manager David. Just to handle as its own transaction. What are the chances that Lightning would strike twice? &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
100% !!! THAT'S WHAT THE CHANCES ARE!!!!! <br />
<br />
SO I go in today, I go to tool rental. First thing from the guy at the desk, &quot;I'm sorry, I'm new here, so I don't know how to do that. You'll have to wait for Tom.&quot; <br />
<br />
So I sit and wait for 15 minutes for Tom to show up. &quot;Oh, I'm sorry, I don't handle that stuff. You're going to have to come back when Gabriel is here tomorrow, and handle it then.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
I was so pissed off, I wanted to pee on the floor. But I don't show that. I had dinner plans with my wife, so I didn't want to get angry. I just wanted to make sure this got handled right. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, well, I got a phone call from Steve earlier today, and he told me to come in today at exactly 6pm, and that David the ASM would know how to handle this. Thats all I'm here for, is David.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tom: &quot;Well, I don't know what David is going to do about it. he doesn't handle these machines, so he's not going to know how to handle this at all. YOu'd be better off waiting until tomorrow and coming in and seeing Gabriel.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I was on the phone with RIDGID this morning, and they helped me out with my customer ID #, and they e-mailed me the entire process on how to get this taken care of, and I can walk you through it, because I've got my phone, and my e-mail has all the info. Steve called me, somehow he got wind of this whole fiasco, and he personally requested that I come in, and ask for David in order to get this resolved.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tom: &quot;Well, lets go ahead and walk through the whole process. I can do that.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, [walked him through the whole process leading up to Store Login @ the Warranty LSA website] now your login is H1303, and your password is the same one that you use for all your online transactions that they trained you on.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tom: &quot;Well, I'm going to have to find a manual for that.&quot; (goes rifling through manuals.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, just type in H1303, and just enter your password for the store.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tom: &quot;Well, I've got to make sure this is right, because I've never done this before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, well, then I suggest you call for David and ask for him to come over here. Steve asked for me to come in and ask for him.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tom: &quot;Well, if you think he's going to know what to do, then that's fine with me. I'll give him a call&quot;<br />
<br />
He picks up the phone and calls David. I have bad hearing, so all I hear is David's name a couple times. <br />
<br />
Customer to the left of me sees my RIDGID battery on the counter and  asks me if it is defective. I say yes. He says he's got 2 that are defective. I ask him if he's taken them in for the LSA. He says that it isn't his job to deal with that, it is his accountants. Oi, Gevalt. He's in for a rude awakening. <br />
<br />
<br />
Tom turns back to me and says david will arrive shortly. I take a chill-ax break on my previously used Makita 2&quot; Rotary hammer. <br />
<br />
David shows up, shakes my hand, and says that he's going to get me a brand new battery and some money in store credit. he walks me over to the battery corral, and my battery isn't there. There are other Ridgid 18v Batteries, but not the one the same as mine - there are batteries way better than mine, but not thes ame as mine. Plus, I'm a little nervous, because this still doesn't truly resolve my issue of my battery, which has to follow RIDGID's procedures to retain its Lifetime Service Agreement warranty. <br />
<br />
So, he pulls out the most expensive battery on the shelf. A compact, 4x Life, 2.0 amp 18v battery - this is like my existing battery, but on steroids, methamphetamine, and wrapped in velvet vagina flesh. With Tits. Yes, its that fucking good. <br />
<br />
Then he tells me he'll meet me at the front counter, and to go through the store and get whatever it is that I need. he asks if $40 is adequate, and I'm stunned. I just got a rim job, a handjob, and now he's asking if I want him to swallow. Come again? At this point, I really only wanted to have the LSA procedure honored, but it felt like everytime I tried segueing into that, saying things like, &quot;I didn't want anyone to get in trouble,&quot; or &quot;At the end of the day&quot; and he cuts me off each time, saying I deserve everything I&quot;m getting today.<br />
<br />
So I say, &quot;well, I was planning on painting a house tomorrow, so I just need to get a paintbrush and a scraper (i have all this, and my brain is sort of numb, so I think if I dismiss myself, I might be okay.&quot; <br />
<br />
So I grab a  paintbrush - i really needed to get a bucket head, and that was the secondary reason I went in, but my brain has become so numb that i completely forgot - a scraper, and a hand bucket and hand trays. <br />
<br />
I make my way over to the checkout, and there's David, standing at the Front counter with a knockout Aztlanian Princess in front of him with the battery at her side. I'm stunned. I really, at this point am speechless. He's got the battery out of its packaging (I assume so I can't return it for cash?), and she's ringing me up for everything and marking it all down to 0. She bags it all up, and tells me to have a nice day. <br />
<br />
Fuck. I still didn't get it resolved. Should I still go back tomorrow and have Gabriel run the LSA on my battery? Do I call RIDGID and ask for them to transfer my warranty from the defective battery over to this new better battery? Hell, will they even honor this? <br />
<br />
In the end, I didn't even get what I came there for resolved in the first place! FUCK! FUUUCK!!<br />
<br />
SO, after my wife and I go out for dinner, I make a list of the stuff I actually needed to get there for painting tomorrow, as well as my new Buckethead. I walk in, I pick up everything I actually needed and proceeded to the back checkout near the ProDesk (I didn't want to run into anyone from before). Lo and behold, who makes their way from the back right past me? Fucking David, the ASM. <br />
<br />
What does he do? He tells the cashier to mark evrything down I was purchasing to 0, and that it was to complete the full $40 (which it was going to be almost $60 in stuff) which 'he owed me' from prior. <br />
<br />
FUCK. What the Fuck. Do I call and complain that I didn't want this? I feel like CHristian Bale in AMerican Hustle, &quot;NO no no, No no no, I can't take your money.&quot;  &quot;TAKE MY MONEY.&quot;</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I tend to leave my work PC on and only reboot it once every few weeks. In that time period I tend to accumulate a lot of open apps and files. Things that I want to remember to look at or work on. We moved to a new office a few months back and since then my computer has occasionally rebooted over night. Windows Update is disabled so I think the circuit I'm on has a problem. My company needs to get me a battery backup, but in the meantime I'm trying to find something that would allow me to re-open all the last things I had going before the computer last shut down. Some Microsoft apps like Office have this, but not SQL Server Management Studio. All the browsers have this capability. You'd think Microsoft would be smart enough to make this an OS feature.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Google turned up a couple potential candidates for what I want (Twinsplay and SmartClose) but the reviews I found for them are from back before 2010. Do any of you guys know of any reliable software that you'd recommend for this?</div>

I have everything planned out and the supplies purchased bu the weather has been shit and would have killed my plants at least twice already had I gone ahead with doing so. I did some test plants last year and I'm going with making a few raised beds with various spices to supplement what is available at the local farmer's market, plus it is relaxing. I'm going to plant some flowers in the holes in the concrete blocks too which should turn out nice. It was pretty fun doing the design and planning everything out.

Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Gulf War Illness Revealed by 31Phosphorus Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy: A Case-Control Study <br />
 Hayley J. Koslik,   Gavin Hamilton,   Beatrice A. Golomb mail   <br />
<br />
Published: March 27, 2014<br />
•DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0092887<br />
<br />
Abstract<br />
<br />
Background<br />
<br />
Approximately 1/3 of 1990-1 Gulf War veterans developed chronic multisymptom health problems. Implicated exposures bear mechanisms that adversely affect mitochondria. Symptoms emphasize fatigue, cognition and muscle (brain and muscle are aerobically demanding); with protean additional domains affected, compatible with mitochondrial impairment. Recent evidence supports treatments targeting cell bioenergetics (coenzyme10) to benefit Gulf War illness symptoms. However, no evidence has directly documented mitochondrial or bioenergetic impairment in Gulf War illness.<br />
<br />
Objective<br />
<br />
We sought to objectively assess for mitochondrial dysfunction, examining post-exercise phosphocreatine-recovery time constant (PCr-R) using 31Phosphorus Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (31P-MRS), in Gulf War veterans with Gulf War illness compared to matched healthy controls. PCr-R has been described as a “robust and practical” index of mitochondrial status.<br />
<br />
Design and Participants<br />
<br />
Case-control study from 2012–2013. Fourteen community-dwelling Gulf War veterans and matched controls from the San Diego area comprised 7 men meeting CDC and Kansas criteria for Gulf War illness, and 7 non-deployed healthy controls matched 1:1 to cases on age, sex, and ethnicity.<br />
<br />
Outcome Measure<br />
<br />
Calf muscle phosphocreatine was evaluated by 31P-MRS at rest, through 5 minutes of foot pedal depression exercise, and in recovery, to assess PCr-R. Paired t-tests compared cases to matched controls.<br />
<br />
Results<br />
<br />
PCr-R was significantly prolonged in Gulf War illness cases vs their matched controls: control values, mean±SD, 29.0±8.7 seconds; case values 46.1±18.0 seconds; difference 17.1±14.9 seconds; p = 0.023. PCr-R was longer for cases relative to their matched controls for all but one pair; moreover while values clustered under 31 seconds for all but one control, they exceeded 35 seconds (with a spread up to 70 seconds) for all but one case.<br />
<br />
Discussion<br />
<br />
These data provide the first direct evidence supporting mitochondrial dysfunction in Gulf War illness. Findings merit replication in a larger study and/or corroboration with additional mitochondrial assessment tools<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Introduction<br />
<br />
Of the ~700,000 US troops deployed to the 1990-1 Persian Gulf theater, an estimated 175,000–250,000 (~1/4–1/3 of those deployed), developed chronic multisymptom health problems often termed “Gulf War illness” (GWI) [1]. GWI is characterized by protean symptoms spanning multiple symptom “domains” (such as cognitive, fatigue, musculoskeletal). Gulf deployed veterans on average have more symptom domains affected, and greater severity and multiplicity of symptoms within domains, than Gulf era veterans who were not deployed [2]. Fatigue, exercise intolerance, cognitive difficulties, muscle pain and weakness, shortness of breath, gastrointestinal problems, sleep problems, behavior change, neurological findings, and skin problems are all elevated. GWI is defined by symptoms; a number of objective findings have been replicated, such as autonomic dysfunction, increased autoantibodies, reduced natural killer cell activity, and increased coagulation activation among others [3]. Studies generally show that affected veterans have not improved with time [4], [5], [6]; Gulf War veterans (GWV) continue to experience symptoms and impaired function 23 years later.<br />
<br />
GWI is not equivalent to signature conditions of subsequent deployments to the region, such as posttraumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. Indeed, stress and combat are demonstrably not the cause. While combat stress bears a dose-response relation to posttraumatic stress disorder (including in GWV); it bears no significant relationship to GWI in studies that adjust for other exposures [4]. Environmental factors are clearly inculpated in GWI. Many exposures were new, unique or excessive in the Gulf War. These include heat, sand, depleted uranium tanks/munitions, chemical agent resistant coating paint, and oil fires; as well as protections such as high numbers of multiple vaccines, anthrax vaccine, pyridostigmine bromide nerve agent pretreatment pills, pesticides and insect repellents, and permethrin-impregnated uniforms among others. Evidence most strongly implicates acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEi) related exposures (which adhere to Hill's criteria for causality, include a dose-response relationship, and are buttressed by gene-exposure interaction data) [7]. Multiple vaccinations and anthrax vaccine also show relatively consistent epidemiological associations, but do not have the triangulating evidence for causality. AChEi related exposures include (carbamate) pyridostigmine bromide nerve agent pretreatment pills, given to an estimated 250,000 US troops [8]; carbamate and organophosphate pesticides [9], used aggressively and sometimes excessively to protect against insect vectors of disease [10], [11]; and organophosphate nerve gas, to which the Department of Defense estimates as many as ~100,000 US troops were exposed in association with the demolition of the Khamisiyah munitions depot [12], with other possible nerve agent exposures [13]. Number of exposures experienced has also been linked to illness [14]; and exposure interactions, conceptually and empirically, may produce more problems [15].<br />
<br />
The involvement of AChEi provides important information regarding potential mechanisms. Whereas AChEi toxicity is often viewed in terms of acetylcholinesterase inhibition, evidence shows that toxicity and lethality in fact relate decisively to (intertwined) oxidative stress (OS) and mitochondrial dysfunction (MD) [16] (phenomena that are tightly intertwined because the mitochondria are a leading target and source of reactive oxygen species [17], [18], [19]): indeed, animal evidence shows that high quality antioxidants administered just before or just after organophosphate pesticide exposure protect against lethality and chronic sequelae [20], [21]. We have shown that a mechanism involving OS-MD would explain the symptom profile (including which symptoms dominate – fatigue as well as central nervous system and muscle symptoms dominate in MD), symptom multiplicity, protean symptom character, variable latency to onset of symptoms, and the objective markers linked to GWI [3]. This mechanism would also provide for a subsidiary role for multiple other exposures for which mechanisms of action are classically considered to be unrelated, but which share in common induction of OS – potentiating MD and further OS. Figure 1 depicts the mechanism we propose.<br />

</div>Note similarities ot ME/CFS, in fact some researchers think they're the same thing.<br />

and for the record, Wessely DID state that GWS *was* psychological until a UK inquiry said otherwise, so he had to change his story.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Just some tips for those farming at 70.<br />
<b>#1 You can right click on the map to zoom out.</b><br />
Simple tip, but it can save you a lot of time when you join a friends game (and thus made everything harder for them).<br />
<br />
<b>#2 Check the world map prior to starting the act</b><br />
Unless you can handle all of the bounty objectives without wasting a lot of time, don't do that act, just quit out and start another game.  Most people can't handle Malthael on the same difficulty as everything else, and if they can, it takes them a LOT of time to get that far.<br />
<br />
<b>#3 Use the map for direct transportation.</b><br />
Instead of going from one bounty back to town, then waypointing to another bounty, if you open your map, you can click on the destination you want to travel.<br />
<br />
<b>#4 You can complete a Horadric Cache by joining an in-progress run.</b><br />
This means as long as your friend hasn't talked to Tyrael to complete, you can join the game and get credit when they turn-in the quest.<br />
<br />
<b>#5 Speed</b><br />
This is the most important aspect.  You want to maximize how often you spend killing, and minimize how long you spend traveling. Try to max your run speed without giving up too many stats (This is a good use of paragon points).  Also focus on AOE attacks rather than single target damage.  The faster you can kill large groups, the faster you can move along.<br />
<br />
<b>#6 Keep in mind what you're after, and choose an appropriate difficulty</b><br />
If you're just starting off, and Torment is extremely slow, don't do it.  Play on Expert.  You'll get the double shards, and the drop rate is the same as at Master.  If you can handle Torment 2, consider playing on Torment 1. That gives you access to the class specific set items.<br />
<br />
If you can't kill a Treasure Goblin, your difficulty is too high.<br />
<br />
<b>My Thoughts on Gambling</b><br />
Gambling seems like something they're going to end up patching. I'm considering holding onto my blood shards until 2.1.  It's up to you of course, but I've spent ~500 shards and gotten nothing.  No usable yellows, and no legendary items.</div>

			Part of the fun of being an Xbox One owner is the social aspect of the console. When deciding who you want to play with, you want to know that your potential opponent is going to play fair, is of the same sort of skill level and is going to behave properly whilst playing. This is something the gamer reputation system helps with, and starting this month it is being updated to make it more useful.<br />
<br />
While most gamers managed to remain in the Green (Good Player) category, there are some who gradually slip. As feedback from other players is received and a player's reputation starts to drop, warnings will be sent out to try to encourage them to change their ways. Microsoft says that these warnings &quot;are based on community feedback collected since Xbox One launched.&quot;<br />
<br />
If things start to get really bad and a player slips right down into the red, Avoid Me, zone, there could start to be penalties. Those who exhibit bad behavior which others complain about could well find that they are unable to take advantage of certain features such as Twitch broadcasting -- so remember to behave from now on!<br />
<br />
The changes should only really affect those users who have been spoiling the experience for everyone else, but in case you are worried that you may have your privileged lowered without good reason, Microsoft offers some reassurance:<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember, we designed the algorithm so it won’t penalize you for bad reports over a few weeks of play. The system also adjusts for false reports from people that might intentionally report someone of greater skill or for other griefing purposes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Does all of this seem like a good idea to you?
