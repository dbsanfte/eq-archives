    <h4><a name="PartOne"></a>Part One</h4>
    <p><b>You say, 'Hail, Seana Marsinger'<br>
    </b><br>
    Seana Marsinger says 'Hello, my name is Seana Marsinger. I am here 
    representing my loyalty to the League of Antonican Bards. It matters not to 
    me whether you support the League or loathe it propaganda is not my 
    objective. Everyone must find their own truths in this life path, so says 
    Quellious. To business then, are you [familiar with the Plane of Hate?]'<br>
    <br>
    <b>You say, 'I am familiar with the Plane of Hate'<br>
    </b><br>
    Seana Marsinger says 'Good, I need someone that has a bit of an eye for how 
    things should look up there. My brother and I have been studying Innoruuk 
    and his intricate dealings for years. Being raised in New Tanaan may lend us 
    certain neutrality towards all people, yet the values our parents have 
    instilled in us do not allow us to let him go unwatched. In fact, I have 
    begun to believe that my paranoia may prove useful not only to the League, 
    but to the Citizens of Tranquility and New Tanaan itself as well. We have 
    received a simple [piece of intelligence] that may conceivably upset the 
    entire balance of the Pantheon and have most dire repercussions here in 
    Norrath.'<br>
    <br>
    <b>You say, 'what piece of intelligence?'<br>
    </b><br>
    Seana Marsinger says 'An old friend of our father's in Qeynos, Jusean 
    Evanesque, has been very busy sorting out the information that is coming to 
    him in droves. The first clue came from Kardin Nillic in Gunthak, and then 
    in bits and pieces from many travelers moving through Qeynos. Piracy on the 
    seas has grown, and somehow the Broken Skull Clan has gained power that 
    should have been out of their grasp. Our informants there say that it can 
    only come from Innoruuk. I am afraid that the Plane itself has shifted with 
    this power. I do not believe that we will be able to uncover all that we 
    need [alone] in time to warn people of the dangers.'<br>
    <br>
    <b>You say, 'why are you alone?'</b><br>
    Seana Marsinger says 'Our parents are back in Qeynos assisting Jusean with 
    all that needs to be verified and ensuring that the League's network 
    contacts are all still viable. They will need to stay there in case we must 
    get the word out quickly. I do not believe that any of the residents of 
    Tanaan would approve of our little quest, and would view it as biased. Thus 
    we are here alone. Does this type of project [interest] you?'<br>
    <br>
    <b>You say, 'I am interested'</b><br>
    <br>
    Stefan Marsinger takes a moment to size you up. 'You appear to be a 
    practitioner of pure magic, am I correct?'<br>
    <br>
    <b>You say, 'you are correct'</b><br>
    <br>
    Stefan Marsinger says 'I believe it is safest if you study those who have 
    similar interests as yourself. Travel to the Plane of Hate and observe the 
    revenant, the ashenbone drake, and the loathing lich. They seem to be the 
    main practitioners of your art in the least dangerous area. My interaction 
    with these creatures has been mostly at a distance, and I am not as familiar 
    with them as I would like. If you survive long enough to uncover some type 
    of signet that proves you have been studying these creatures, and truly wish 
    to aid with this cause, bring it to me along with some vampire dust and a 
    diamond. I can craft you protective item and may have some further work for 
    you to do.'</p>
    <p><font color="#CC99FF">.:: Now head to the Plane of Hate. Kill forsaken 
    revenants, ashenbone drakes, and loathing liches until you get a Minor 
    Signet of the Dark Sorcerer. <br>
    <br>
    Also collect some vampire dust (dropped by various mobs throughout the game 
    but while you're in PoHate, just kill revenants until you get one)</font></p>
    <p><font color="#CC99FF">Give the signet, vampire dust, and a diamond to 
    Stefan Marsinger back in Greater Faydark and you will receive the first 
    reward ::.</font><br>

    <p><b>You say, 'what work?'</b><br>
    <br>
    Stefan Marsinger says 'Wonderful. Return to the plane and continue your 
    studies of the demons of magic. With the new information you have brought I 
    believe we have a good framework of reference for the lower rankings of 
    these beings, however there is another echelon of power that I will need to 
    be familiar with. Seek out the minions of magic that seem to take Dark Elven 
    form. These would be the sages, warlocks, and sorcerers. All of these 
    creatures should be within your area of study, but take care! You may even 
    find some that follow your particular discipline if that makes you more 
    comfortable. Make sure to keep your protection with you at all times. Some 
    of them should have a kind of Etched Sorcerer's Crest symbolizing their 
    rank; bring me this crest and some hatebone drake bones, along with your Gem 
    of Sorcery. If you succeed in this task you are more valuable than I could 
    have imagined, and I may need your skill with a final reconnaissance 
    errand.'</p>
    <p><font color="#CC99FF">.:: Head back to Hate and hunt down Sages, 
    Sorcerers, and Warlocks of Hate, they are found south of zone-in. Kill them 
    until you receive an etched sorcerer's crest.<br>
    <br>
    Next kill some hatebone drakes until you receive hatebone drake bones.

    <br>
    Stefan Marsinger says 'In my personal studies I have heard rumor that there 
    are four archaic tomes that contain some of Innoruuk's darkest secrets. I 
    cannot ask you to uncover all four, I am not even certain that they exist. 
    The Concordance of Black Magic, Teachings of Innoruuk, Book of the Dead, and 
    Applications of Suffering are the fabled tomes. If they do indeed exist and 
    you manage to find them, you are far grander than I. The tome that I do seek 
    will most likely lie in the hands of one of Innoruuk's own advisors, and 
    they seldom seem to leave their studies. It is possible the Prince of Hate 
    himself holds the tomes close. Find me the Concordance of Black Magic; 
    return it to me with your Gem of Enchantment and your work is finished.'</p>
    <p><font color="#CC99FF">.:: Head back to Hate and this time bring some 
    friends. You need to collect a Concordance of Black Magic. It is dropped by 
    Innoruuk and other bosses in the zone including Maestro.<br>
    Next kill some hatebone drakes until you receive hatebone drake bones.
