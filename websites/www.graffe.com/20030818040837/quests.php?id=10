      <p>This is an easy quest that can get you a great ring for pure casters 
      except for Necromancers. First of all you must get your faction to kindly 
      with the Temple of Life. I did this by giving Lashun Novashine 2 bone 
      chips at a time and paying him 2 gp for a cure disease.(Faction can be 
      raised by killing Putrid Skeletons in South Karana or by performing the 
      blessed oil quest as well as donating 2gp to Lashun) Once your faction is 
      kindly you can do the quest. </p>
      <p>Talk to Enic Rulkin by the Temple of Life Pool within Qeynos (he is 
      usually glitched and is swimming in the water by the Koalindl fish). He 
      will tell you of a problem that he has. It seems that Frostbite (McMannus's 
      pet dog in West Karanas) has eaten a Koalindl fish. Enic must get the 
      corpse back because even the fish's corpse is still considered to be holy. </p>
      <p>Here is the trick... instead of killing Frostbite, which may be too 
      high level to kill and not always drop the fish corpse, simply create a 
      level 1 character with your friend doing the same (Shadow Knights are the 
      best for this because of Harm Touch) and go into the pool by the Temple of 
      Life and kill a Koalindl. The Koalindl will usually drop its scales. Now 
      log out the level 1 character and loot the fish with your real character. </p>
      <p>I thought that this would be the best way to do the quest, otherwise 
      you would lose faction with the Temple of Life if you kill the Koalindl 
      Fish with your true character. (To be safe, gate out of the zone and come 
      back in before you do the next step. One has been killed for simply 
      looting the corpse) Now simply give the Koalindl Fish Scales to Enic 
      Rulkin, and if he cons amiable, you may get the Band of Rodcet Nife. The 
      quest booby prize is Prayer Beads.<br>
      <br>
      For another way to get the Koalindl fish, read on.<br>
      <br>
      Go to Surefall Glade (if you have acceptable faction). The druid in the 
      druid tree on<br>
      the far left will give you Nitrates if you take to them. Take the Nitrates 
      to Ak'Anon,<br>
      and give them to the Zookeeper (again, faction must be decent). He will 
      give you a Regurgitonic. From there, take the Regurgitonic, and give it to 
      Frostbite, who will<br>
      throw up the fish, which you can then take back to Enic Rulkin. In some 
      ways, this is easier than killing the fish (they seem to drop about 1 in 3 
      to 1 in 8) with an alt, in some ways harder. I was bound in Qeynos, so it 
      was easy for me to port over to Greater Faydark and do this, then gate 
      back.<br>
