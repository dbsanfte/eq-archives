  <p align="left"><font size="2">This quest begins in the Temple of Solusek Ro 
  from Vilissia. One of the items she offers you is the Runescale Cloak. To 
  obtain this item, you must return to her a Lizardscale Cloak and 3 Runes of 
  Scale.</font></p>

  <hr noshade>

      <p><font size="2">&nbsp; The Lizardscale Cloak can be obtained as the common 
      drop off of the Tae En Templar in the Temple of Cazic-Thule. Please note 
      that unless it has changed with the removal of Rubicite, he spawns very 
      rarely. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2">&nbsp; The Runes are rather tricky to get as well. The easiest is 
  the ones on Deepwater Crocodiles, these are in Oasis and rather plentiful. If 
  you're feeling kind and don't wish to take kills from the newbies, just offer 
  the zone 20pp for looting rights on one that drops the Rune. However, note 
  that the Rune drops 10% of the time at best. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2">&nbsp; The second rune is held by Saltwater Crocodiles in Upper 
  Guk. Please note that these are not the wandering ones at the beginning, to 
  prevent extreme camping I will not go into further detail. The main problem 
  here is that they still come up about 10% of the time but the only saltwater 
  crocs in the entire zone spawn every 25 minutes. Furthermore, as all the 
  saltwater crocs spawn at the same time, either they all have the rune or all 
  don't. For reference, I camped this, alone, with no one else bothering me, for 
  3-4hrs. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2">&nbsp; The final rune is the one held by the Firescale Crocodile.&nbsp; 
  His spawn is very near to the Temple of Solusek Ro, and he spawns every 25 
  minutes. Verant showed a little more mercy on this one, he seems to drop the 
  rune about 25% of the time. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2">&nbsp;Good luck! </font></p>
