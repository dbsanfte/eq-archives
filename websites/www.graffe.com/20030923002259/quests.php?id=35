<HR>
<b>You say, 'Hail, Lairyn Debeian'</b>
<HR>
Lairyn Debeian peers up from his journal and smiles at you warmly, 'Greetings, friend. I was so involved in my research that I did not hear you approaching.' He closes the leather-bound tome and pats it with one slender hand. 'Please forgive my lack of courtesy. I am Lairyn from the order of the Crimson Hands, and this little book here is my life's work. I am currently unraveling the secret of a [new power] that has emerged on Broken Skull Rock.' 
<HR>
<b>You say, 'What new power?' </b>
<HR>
Lairyn Debeian says 'The strange beasts known as Luggalds that reside on Broken Skull Rock have an amazing power over the dark waters of the deep. They are able to conjure it up in the form of an immense spear of ice. I have seen them do so with my own eyes, though I was watching from afar, of course. I would not dare venture close enough to anger the foul beasts. Their grasp of this magic is simply breathtaking, and from my observations alone, I am very close to unlocking their methods. Unfortunately, I have run into an obstacle, as I cannot complete my research without something more tangible. If only I were brave enough to get closer, or foolish enough. As you can see, I am more intellectual than adventurer.' At this, Lairyn chuckles and his spectacles slip a little further down his nose.' 
<HR>
<b>You say, 'I am brave enough.' </b>
<HR>
Lairyn Debeian gasps in apparent surprise, 'What? Are you certain you wish to put yourself in such a perilous position? Well I certainly can't turn down good help, so I'll tell you what I know. The Luggalds often utilize their spells against creatures in the waters of the harbor. Whether this is for practice, or for sport, or to ward off attackers I am not sure. I would suggest investigating the harbor for further evidence. Take this bag and bring me whatever you can find.' 
<HR>
He then hands you a Small Pouch. From here, swim south and find Aliaka Songscale, a named mermaid. She is hiden under a sunken boat, at loc 337, -564. 
<BR>
<b>You say, 'Hail, Aliaka Songscale' </b>
<HR>
Aliaka Songscale flinches as you initially approach, but appears more at ease when she realizes you are not an immediate threat. 'Ah, thank Prexus you are not one of them. Not that this guarantees that you are any less dangerous, so please state your intentions clearly. We have suffered much [abuse] at the hands of other races, and in particular I do not appreciate the pain that the sea trolls inflict upon my sisters.' 
<HR>
<b>You say, 'What abuse?' </b>
<HR>
Aliaka Songscale speaks, her visage one of sadness and despair, 'This shore has forever been the home of my people, but we are practically driven into hiding now, forced to flee and scatter when the Luggalds come near. At their whim, the fiendish beasts lance us with their icy spears. The cold chill bites and the pain is horrible. In fact, there are still fragments of the dark ice embedded in my scales from their last attack. I believe they only mean to torment and not kill us, as so far there have been few deaths. Now that you understand our plight, what is it you want from me?' 
<HR>
<b>You say, 'I want the fragments of dark ice.' </b>
<HR>
Aliaka Songscale smirks, 'Forgive my hesitance in trusting a stranger, but the frozen shards are quite painful, and removing them would be even more so. Perhaps we can trade services? I will give you some willingly if you would complete a [task] first.' 
<HR>
<b>You say, 'what task?' </b>
<HR>
Aliaka Songscale says 'As a sign of loyalty, and to avenge the innocent blood that was spilt by the Luggalds, I would like you to cut down some of the fiends and bring proof of their demise. Use whatever means necessary. Grant them no quarter and expect none in return. For each of their dark hearts, I will trade pieces of the ice that you seem so interested in. I will accept nothing else.' 
<HR>
Now you need to get 4 Luggald hearts. These need to be turned into Aliaka, she will give you a shard for each heart you give her. They are a semi-rare drop off of the luggalds in Nadox. I have also heard people say they were dropping in Dulak. If you get a group together you can get 4 of them in a couple of hours. Once you get 4 shards, combine them in your Small Pouch that Lairyn gave you. Give the final product back to Lairyn and he will hand you a copy of Frozen Harpoon.
