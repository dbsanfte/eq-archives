			STORY HIGHLIGHTS<br />
<ul><li style="">Man tried to donate kidney to his older sister in Toledo, Ohio</li><li style="">Nurse mistakenly disposed of kidney in medical waste, lawsuit says</li><li style="">Medical center denies gross negligence, apologizes to family</li></ul><br />
<br />
An Ohio man intended to save the life of his older sister by donating a kidney to her -- a sacrifice on his part that ended in vain a year ago when a nurse mistakenly threw away the donated organ.<br />
<br />
Paul Fudacz Jr. and his sister, Sarah, say the University of Toledo Medical Center &quot;utterly botched&quot; their kidney transplant surgery.<br />
<br />
The medical center this week said it has &quot;worked hard to learn from this incident&quot; and apologized to the family.<br />
<br />
But on Tuesday it asked that a lawsuit be dismissed and denied claims of gross negligence and failure to meet accepted standards of care.<br />
<br />
The civil complaint contends Paul Fudacz's right kidney was considered a &quot;perfect match&quot; for his sister, then 24, who reportedly suffered from end-stage renal disease.<br />
<br />
During the brother's surgery on August 10, 2012, his kidney was placed in a &quot;slush machine&quot; until it could be moved to his sister's room, where she'd yet to undergo her surgery.<br />
<br />
A nurse, who was cleaning up, had just returned from a lunch break and thought the kidney was already in Sarah's room when she discarded the machine's contents, according to the lawsuit. While the kidney was later recovered, it couldn't be used because it had been thrown away with other infected or unsterile medical waste, the Fudacz family alleges.<br />
<br />
Sarah Fudacz required additional dialysis and four dialysis-related surgeries before she received a replacement kidney three months later, the lawsuit states.<br />
<br />
&quot;When compared to Paul Jr.'s kidney, Sarah's new kidney is a poorer match and of poorer quality,&quot; and she has a higher risk of rejecting it over time, the lawsuit claims.<br />
<br />
The pair's parents also claimed they suffered emotional distress and a &quot;loss of consortium,&quot; or loss of family relationships.<br />
<br />
But the Ohio attorney general contends parents of adult children and siblings cannot make such a claim about loss of consortium in such a case.<br />
<br />
Each of eight Fudacz family members -- including four other siblings -- are seeking in excess of $25,000.<br />
<br />
Dr. Jeffrey Gold, chancellor and executive vice president for health affairs, University of Toledo Medical Center, said the university &quot;continues to express the sorrow that we feel that this unfortunate incident occurred. We apologize sincerely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;While the legal realities of this situation are complex and ongoing, we have worked hard to learn from this incident and have spread the lessons widely to try to make hospitals and transplant programs safer across the country.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the wake of the incident, the hospital temporarily suspended its live kidney donor program. It has since resumed operations.<br />
<br />
The nurse involved in the incident retired from the hospital. The surgeon in charge of the planned transplant no longer directs the kidney transplant program but continues to perform them and remains a professor, the University of Toledo Medical Center said.

			U.S. intelligence services carried out 231 offensive cyber-operations in 2011, the leading edge of a clandestine campaign that embraces the Internet as a theater of spying, sabotage and war, according to top-secret documents obtained by The Washington Post.<br />
<br />
That disclosure, in a classified intelligence budget provided by NSA leaker Edward Snowden, provides new evidence that the Obama administration’s growing ranks of cyberwarriors infiltrate and disrupt foreign computer networks. <br />
<br />
Additionally, under an extensive effort code-named GENIE, U.S. computer specialists break into foreign networks so that they can be put under surreptitious U.S. control. Budget documents say the $652 million project has placed “covert implants,” sophisticated malware transmitted from far away, in computers, routers and firewalls on tens of thousands of machines every year, with plans to expand those numbers into the millions.<br />
<br />
The documents provided by Snowden and interviews with former U.S. officials describe a campaign of computer intrusions that is far broader and more aggressive than previously understood. The Obama administration treats all such cyber-operations as clandestine and declines to acknowledge them.<br />
<br />
The scope and scale of offensive operations represent an evolution in policy, which in the past sought to preserve an international norm against acts of aggression in cyberspace, in part because U.S. economic and military power depend so heavily on computers.<br />
<br />
“The policy debate has moved so that offensive options are more prominent now,” said former deputy defense secretary William J. Lynn III, who has not seen the budget document and was speaking generally. “I think there’s more of a case made now that offensive cyberoptions can be an important element in deterring certain adversaries.”<br />
<br />
Of the 231 offensive operations conducted in 2011, the budget said, nearly three-quarters were against top-priority targets, which former officials say includes adversaries such as Iran, Russia, China and North Korea and activities such as nuclear proliferation. The document provided few other details about the operations.<br />
<br />
Stuxnet, a computer worm reportedly developed by the United States and Israel that destroyed Iranian nuclear centrifuges in attacks in 2009 and 2010, is often cited as the most dramatic use of a cyberweapon. Experts said no other known cyberattacks carried out by the United States match the physical damage inflicted in that case. <br />
<br />
U.S. agencies define offensive cyber-operations as activities intended “to manipulate, disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers or computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves,” according to a presidential directive issued in October 2012.<br />
<br />
Most offensive operations have immediate effects only on data or the proper functioning of an adversary’s machine: slowing its network connection, filling its screen with static or scrambling the results of basic calculations. Any of those could have powerful effects if they caused an adversary to botch the timing of an attack, lose control of a computer or miscalculate locations. <br />
<br />
U.S. intelligence services are making routine use around the world of government-built malware that differs little in function from the “advanced persistent threats” that U.S. officials attribute to China. The principal difference, U.S. officials told The Post, is that China steals U.S. corporate secrets for financial gain.<br />
<br />
“The Department of Defense does engage” in computer network exploitation, according to an e-mailed statement from an NSA spokesman, whose agency is part of the Defense Department. “The department does ***not*** engage in economic espionage in any domain, including cyber.”<br />
<br />
<b>‘Millions of implants’ </b><br />
<br />
The administration’s cyber-operations sometimes involve what one budget document calls “field operations” abroad, commonly with the help of CIA operatives or clandestine military forces, “to physically place hardware implants or software modifications.”<br />
<br />
Much more often, an implant is coded entirely in software by an NSA group called Tailored Access Operations (TAO). As its name suggests, TAO builds attack tools that are custom-fitted to their targets. <br />
<br />
The NSA unit’s software engineers would rather tap into networks than individual computers because there are usually many devices on each network. Tailored Access Operations has software templates to break into common brands and models of “routers, switches and firewalls from multiple product vendor lines,” according to one document describing its work.<br />
<br />
The implants that TAO creates are intended to persist through software and equipment upgrades, to copy stored data, “harvest” communications and tunnel into other connected networks. This year TAO is working on implants that “can identify select voice conversations of interest within a target network and exfiltrate select cuts,” or excerpts, according to one budget document. In some cases, a single compromised device opens the door to hundreds or thousands of others.<br />
<br />
Sometimes an implant’s purpose is to create a back door for future access. “You pry open the window somewhere and leave it so when you come back the owner doesn’t know it’s unlocked, but you can get back in when you want to,” said one intelligence official, who was speaking generally about the topic and was not privy to the budget. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive technology.<br />
<br />
Under U.S. cyberdoctrine, these operations are known as “exploitation,” not “attack,” but they are essential precursors both to attack and defense. <br />
<br />
By the end of this year, GENIE is projected to control at least 85,000 implants in strategically chosen machines around the world. That is quadruple the number — 21,252 — available in 2008, according to the U.S. intelligence budget. <br />
<br />
The NSA appears to be planning a rapid expansion of those numbers, which were limited until recently by the need for human operators to take remote control of compromised machines. Even with a staff of 1,870 people, GENIE made full use of only 8,448 of the 68,975 machines with active implants in 2011. <br />
<br />
For GENIE’s next phase, according to an authoritative reference document, the NSA has brought online an automated system, code-named TURBINE, that is capable of managing “potentially millions of implants” for intelligence gathering “and active attack.”<br />
<br />
<b>‘The ROC’ </b><br />
<br />
When it comes time to fight the cyberwar against the best of the NSA’s global competitors, the TAO calls in its elite operators, who work at the agency’s Fort Meade headquarters and in regional operations centers in Georgia, Texas, Colorado and Hawaii. The NSA’s organizational chart has the main office as S321. Nearly everyone calls it “the ROC,” pronounced “rock”: the Remote Operations Center.<br />
<br />
“To the NSA as a whole, the ROC is where the hackers live,” said a former operator from another section who has worked closely with the exploitation teams. “It’s basically the one-stop shop for any kind of active operation that’s not defensive.”<br />
<br />
Once the hackers find a hole in an adversary’s defense, “[t]argeted systems are compromised electronically, typically providing access to system functions as well as data. System logs and processes are modified to cloak the intrusion, facilitate future access, and accomplish other operational goals,” according to a 570-page budget blueprint for what the government calls its Consolidated Cryptologic Program, which includes the NSA.<br />
<br />
Teams from the FBI, the CIA and U.S. Cyber Command work alongside the ROC, with overlapping missions and legal authorities. So do the operators from the NSA’s National Threat Operations Center, whose mission is focused primarily on cyber*defense. That was Snowden’s job as a Booz Allen Hamilton contractor, and it required him to learn the NSA’s best hacking techniques. <br />
<br />
According to one key document, the ROC teams give Cyber Command “specific target related technical and operational material (identification/recognition), tools and techniques that allow the employment of U.S. national and tactical specific computer network attack mechanisms.”<br />
<br />
The intelligence community’s cybermissions include defense of military and other classified computer networks against foreign attack, a task that absorbs roughly one-third of a total cyber operations budget of $1.02 billion in fiscal 2013, according to the Cryptologic Program budget. The ROC’s breaking-and-entering mission, supported by the GENIE infrastructure, spends nearly twice as much: $651.7 million.<br />
<br />
Most GENIE operations aim for “exploitation” of foreign systems, a term defined in the intelligence budget summary as “surreptitious virtual or physical access to create and sustain a presence inside targeted systems or facilities.” The document adds: “System logs and processes are modified to cloak the intrusion, facilitate future access, and accomplish other operational goals.” <br />
<br />
The NSA designs most of its own implants, but it devoted $25.1 million this year to “additional covert purchases of software vulnerabilities” from private malware vendors, a growing gray-market industry based largely in Europe.<br />
<br />
<b>‘Most challenging targets’ </b><br />
<br />
The budget documents cast U.S. attacks as integral to cyber*defense — describing them in some cases as “active defense.” <br />
<br />
“If you’re neutralizing someone’s nuclear command and control, that’s a huge attack,” said one former defense official. The greater the physical effect, officials said, the less likely it is that an intrusion can remain hidden. <br />
<br />
“The United States is moving toward the use of tools short of traditional weapons that are unattributable — that cannot be easily tied to the attacker — to convince an adversary to change their behavior at a strategic level,” said another former senior U.S. official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive operations.<br />
<br />
China and Russia are regarded as the most formidable cyber*threats, and it is not always easy to tell who works for whom. China’s offensive operations are centered in the Technical Reconnaissance Bureau of the People’s Liberation Army, but U.S. intelligence has come to believe that those state-employed hackers by day return to work at night for personal profit, stealing valuable U.S. defense industry secrets and selling them.<br />
<br />
Iran is a distant third in capability but is thought to be more strongly motivated to retaliate for Stuxnet with an operation that would not only steal information but erase it and attempt to damage U.S. hardware.<br />
<br />
The “most challenging targets” to penetrate are the same in cyber-operations as for all other forms of data collection described in the intelligence budget: Iran, North Korea, China and Russia. GENIE and ROC operators place special focus on locating suspected terrorists “in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Iraq, Somalia, and other extremist safe havens,” according to one list of priorities. <br />
<br />
The growth of Tailored Access Operations at the NSA has been accompanied by a major expansion of the CIA’s Information Operations Center, or IOC. <br />
<br />
The CIA unit employs hundreds of people at facilities in Northern Virginia and has become one of the CIA’s largest divisions. Its primary focus has shifted in recent years from counterterrorism to cybersecurity, according to the budget document.<br />
<br />
The military’s cyber-operations, including U.S. Cyber Command, have drawn much of the public’s attention, but the IOC undertakes some of the most notable offensive operations, including the recruitment of several new intelligence sources, the document said.<br />
<br />
Military cyber-operations personnel grouse that the actions they can take are constrained by the legal authorities that govern them. The presidential policy directive on cyber-operations issued in October made clear that military cyber-operations that result in the disruption or destruction or even manipulation of computers must be approved by the president. But the directive, the existence of which was first reported last fall by The Post and leaked in June by Snowden, largely does not apply to the intelligence community.<br />
<br />
Given the “vast volumes of data” pulled in by the NSA, storage has become a pressing question. The NSA is nearing completion of a massive new data center in Utah. A second one will be built at Fort Meade “to keep pace with cyber processing demands,” the budget document said.<br />
<br />
According to the document, a high-performance computing center in Utah will manage “storage, analysis, and intelligence production.” This will allow intelligence agencies “to evaluate similarities among intrusions that could indicate the presence of a coordinated cyber attack, whether from an organized criminal enterprise or a nation-state.”

The Lord of the Rings trilogy—the novels, films, and video game—are our central example of how “remediation” transforms familiar stories as they move across media.  We will study The Lord of the Rings Online™ (LOTRO) against the backdrop of other games such as Final Fantasy, Star Wars: The Old Republic, and Skyrim; narrative theory, intermediality, and game theory; poems by Spenser, Coleridge, Keats, and Browning; fiction by Tolkien and others; and art since the Pre-Raphaelites that has influenced the neo-medievalism of much fantasy literature and gaming.<br />
<br />
Drawing on centuries of romance narrative conventions, the twenty-first century gaming industry has become a creative and economic powerhouse.  It engages the talents of some of our brightest writers, artists, composers, computer engineers, game theorists, video producers, and marketing professionals, and in 2012, it generated an estimated $64 billion in revenue.  Anyone interested in today’s culture needs to be conversant with the ways this new medium is altering our understanding of stories.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I am getting a new addition. She isn't named yet and is only a day old in the pictures. My son wanted a Husky. My first thought was that it wouldn't be fair to the Husky because it can get pretty hot here during the summer. After doing some research, they actually do a pretty good job of keeping themselves cool. I have done a lot of research and found a reputable breeder. This isn't a puppy mill. They made me fill out a questionaire/application before they would agree to sell me one. So I put down my deposit and had to wait about a month for the next litter. Two of them had litters within a couple of days of each other so there were 9 puppies. I was number 11 on the waiting list. I had to email my first second and third choices by midnight on Wednesday. Well I got very lucky and was able to get my first choice. Quite a few people on the list were looking for something specific. <br />
<br />
Here she is at one day old. She dark gray with the goggles mask. <br />

			<br />
<b><font size="4">Eric Holder Says DOJ Will Let Washington, Colorado Marijuana Laws Go Into Effect </font></b><br />
<br />
WASHINGTON -- The United States government took a historic step back from its long-running drug war on Thursday, when Attorney General Eric Holder informed the governors of Washington and Colorado that the Department of Justice would allow the states to create a regime that would regulate and implement the ballot initiatives that legalized the use of marijuana for adults. <br />
<br />
A Justice Department official said that Holder told the governors in a joint phone call early Thursday afternoon that the department would take a &quot;trust but verify approach&quot; to the state laws. DOJ is reserving its right to file a preemption lawsuit at a later date, since the states' regulation of marijuana is illegal under the Controlled Substances Act.<br />
<br />
Deputy Attorney General James Cole also issued a three-and-a-half page memo to U.S. attorneys across the country. &quot;The Department's guidance in this memorandum rests on its expectation that states and local governments that have enacted laws authorizing marijuana-related conduct will implement strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems that will address the threat those state laws could pose to public safety, public health and other law enforcement interests,&quot; it reads. &quot;A system adequate to that task must not only contain robust controls and procedures on paper; it must also be effective in practice.&quot;<br />
<br />
The memo also outlines eight priorities for federal prosecutors enforcing marijuana laws. According to the guidance, DOJ will still prosecute individuals or entities to prevent:<br />
•the distribution of marijuana to minors; <br />
•revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels;<br />
 •the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states;<br />
 •state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity;<br />
 •violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana<br />
 •drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use;<br />
 •growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands;<br />
 •preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property.<br />
<br />
The eight high-priority areas leave prosecutors bent on targeting marijuana businesses with a fair amount of leeway, especially the exception for &quot;adverse public health consequences.&quot; And prosecutors have shown a willingness to aggressively interpret DOJ guidance in the past, as the many medical marijuana dispensary owners now behind bars can attest. <br />
<br />
U.S. Attorneys will individually be responsible for interpreting the guidelines and how they apply to a case they intend to prosecute. A Justice Department official said, for example, that a U.S Attorney could go after marijuana distributors who used cartoon characters in their marketing because that could be interpreted as attempting to distribute marijuana to minors.<br />
<br />
But the official stressed that the guidance was not optional, and that prosecutors would no longer be allowed to use the sheer volume of sales or the for-profit status of an operation as triggers for prosecution, though these factors could still affect their prosecutorial decisions.<br />
<br />
The Obama administration has struggled with the legalization of medical marijuana in several states. Justice Department Officials had instructed federal prosecutors across the country not to focus federal resources on individuals who were complying with state laws regarding the use of medical marijuana. But the U.S. attorneys in several states that had legalized medical marijuana rebelled, and what was known as the Ogden memo faced stiff resistance from career prosecutors.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's just not what they do,” one former Justice official told HuffPost. “They prosecute people.&quot;<br />
<br />
As a result of the internal pushback at DOJ, a new memo was issued by Deputy Attorney General James Cole in 2011 that gave U.S. attorneys more cover to go after medical marijuana distributors. Federal prosecutors began threatening local government officials with prosecution if they went forward with legislation regulating medical cannabis.<br />
<br />
After recreational marijuana initiatives passed in Washington and Colorado in November, President Barack Obama said the federal government had “bigger fish to fry” and would not make going after marijuana users a priority.<br />
<br />
Holder said back in December that the federal response to the passage of the state ballot measures would be coming “relatively soon.” <br />
<br />
Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson told HuffPost his office was preparing for the “worst-case scenario” of a federal lawsuit against the law.<br />

			<b>Trips to the DMV don't typically elicit genuine smiles, but from beneath a metal pasta strainer, Texas Tech student and practicing Pastafarian Eddie Castillo flashed the &quot;biggest, cheesiest&quot; one he could muster last week.</b><br />
<br />
Castillo told KLBK that the triumphant moment came after a lengthy fight with the state's Department of Public Safety that the unusual headgear was protected as part of his religious beliefs. He worships the Flying Spaghetti Monster, a deity created by an atheist in 2005 in protest of the Kansas School Board's defense of teaching intelligent design. According to its founding principles, &quot;the only dogma allowed in the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster is the rejection of dogma.&quot;<br />
<br />
Castillo is the first American to successfully have his government-issued photo identification taken while wearing a colander, though DPS officials are reportedly planning to follow up with Castillo in order to &quot;rectify&quot; the situation. Others have tried unsuccessfully, and Castillo told KLBK that he was surprised at his victory, which he called a &quot;political and religious milestone for all atheists everywhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Especially in Lubbock County where we are kind of looked at as one of the most conservatives cities in the country,&quot; Castillo said. &quot;I've heard of the stories happening of the guy getting arrested for attempting to do the same thing that I was doing so when I walked in there I had to mentally prepare myself to probably gather bond or something to get out of jail.&quot;<br />
<br />
A New Jersey man caused a scene at a local DMV earlier this year when he refused to remove his pasta-strainer. He eventually complied with the demands, however, and took his photo without the garb. The state told him he could apply to have his strainer approved.<br />
<br />
Donald Hoover, a Pastafarian in Illinois, took up a similar legal battle in May, petitioning the state to allow him to wear a colander for his license photo. When a state official told Hoover there was no exception for &quot;satirical headgear,&quot; he shot back, noting that the state didn't have grounds to question the validity of Hoover's religious beliefs. So far, Hoover hasn't been able to get a Pastafarian-friendly license.<br />
<br />
Pastafarians in Europe have seen more success in their efforts to pay homage to the Flying Spaghetti Monster in official documents. Earlier this month, Czech citizen Lukas Novy was issued an ID  showing him wearing colander, after officials ruled that turning down his request would violate the nation's religious equality laws. Austrian atheist Niko Alm's license also shows him wearing a strainer, the product of a lengthy legal fight.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I need your guy's help.  I'm eligible for a new phone via my Verizon contract and I simply can't decide what to get.  Although I have narrowed my choices down to two phones.  But I have some unanswered questions that maybe graffe can help me with.  I'm definitely going android, as I've tried all the platforms and it's the one that best fits my needs.  And I want to go high end in the 5.0 screen size range.  The Note is too big.<br />
<br />
My major question is this, while researching phones one person mentioned that the new version of android, 5.0, may not support expandable storage, at least not at first, since it's another major re-write.  Meaning that phones like the s4 wont be compatible, but phones like the LG g2 will be.  This seems odd, as most current phones could not upgrade, but not many upgraded to 4.0 without rooting either.<br />
<br />
I've gone back and forth a dozen times, I've put more thought into this than it deserves, but still can't decide.  But the fact that this decision has to last me 2 years it seems worth the research.  My research does show though that there's not a better phone in the pipeline before Christmas than these 2.  That the next google phone is likely to be more focused to the masses than the high end.  And everyone else has just finished announcing their latest and greatest, at least for android.<br />
<br />
I should also mention that I have a 3 week old daughter, so taking high quality pictures and video is a major decision maker.  Although both devices should fit that need, the LG g2 slightly more so.<br />
<br />
I also really want wireless charging since no one seems to make phone docks for landscape mode anymore.  But I'm concerned that they will charge too slow with a protective case on them.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.phonearena.com/phones/Samsung-Galaxy-S4_id7597" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Samsung Galaxy s4</a>.  The obvious current frontrunner.<br />
Pros:<br />
<ul><li style="">Bright screen</li><li style="">Removable battery</li><li style="">expandable storage</li><li style="">most popular phone, therefore most custom accessories.</li></ul><br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
<ul><li style="">Bloatware (I would likely install a custom rom)</li><li style="">Screen prone to burn in</li><li style="">Have heard reports of easy breaking because case twists easily</li><li style="">Supports wireless charging, but it's extra</li><li style="">screen dims over time</li></ul><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.phonearena.com/phones/LG-G2_id7969" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LG G2</a>.  A faster phone, and huge leap forward for LG, but still wont get much press or aftermarket accessory support.  Releases in 2 weeks.<br />
Pros:<br />
<ul><li style="">Current fastest phone</li><li style="">larger screen</li><li style="">bigger battery</li><li style="">IPS screen (possibly not as prone to burn in?)</li><li style="">Improved camera software over stock android</li><li style="">rumor of multiple band LTE antenna</li><li style="">verizon version said to support wireless charging by default</li></ul><br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
<ul><li style="">Bloatware (but camera software is compelling and a reason to not install a custom rom)</li><li style="">Non removable battery</li><li style="">non expandable storage</li><li style="">power button on back of phone (only a con because the button is not accessable in my car mount)</li><li style="">Larger screen could offset larger battery for overall less up time</li></ul><br />
<br />
There are probably other features I'm forgetting to mention.</div>
