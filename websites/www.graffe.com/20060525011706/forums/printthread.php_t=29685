See, these are the situations where we'll likely never know just how fun things can be in the White House.  You have to wonder just what Hughes did to piss off Rove so badly that he'd relocate her whispering lips all the frigging way to State Department Mideast issues?  She's somehow an expert on mending fences with people in the Mideast? Hehe, that's a good one.  In the past she'd been a whole lot more involved in sculpting Bush's political presence domestically, and it's pretty obvious that over the years (even prior to Rove, I believe) she's been one of GWB's closest confidantes.  This moving away of her from Bush's ear is interesting to say the least, and sure makes one wish they were a fly on the wall.<br />
<br />
Pure, fun, unsubstantiated guess out of right field - Rove's punishing her for the absolute innane handling of Social Security propoganda by putting her out to pasture.</div>

I thought that might be the case too, but if that's the case then Hughes would be very foolish to distance herself from the President's ear like this.  And if Sarah Hughes is anything, it's not foolish.  This isn't like &quot;I'm going home to be a good mommy but I'll be on the phone with the White House constantly&quot;, this is an actual position that I'd suspect will have her overseas or pretty busy most of the time.  It's just not her M.O.  Maybe Dina Powell will do most of the heavy lifting, who knows.</div>

Well, while I am not for the social security change, I don't have much evidence other than the &quot;I hate any idea Bush has&quot; instinct I have. I don't know much about it, but no one has been able to tell me whether or not the average person will have more money with this plan or less. Its just I don't think the Bush administration has had a good idea as of yet and I don't see why this should be any different.<br />
<br />
Speaking of this, if anyone has a place where I can get unbiased information that I don't need an economics degree to understand, I really would like to get up to speed with the issue.<br />
<br />
What I find most disturbing though, is while the democrats have roundly denounced the plan, they have yet to come up with a plan of their own (even though there's no way in hell any of it would see the light of day given the current political climate). The response seems to be, &quot;well there's not really anything wrong with it&quot;, which is quite different from the tune they were singing 5 years ago. I guess they are seeing the approval ratings for this continuing to plumet and rather than taking the focus off a bad plan and try to improve it, they will see how low the approval can get before midterms next year. Either way, everyone is getting screwed by doing nothing. But I'd rather have no change rather than a change which screws some people even more.</div>

<br />
Phrase it something like. &quot;In order to stop those GAY MARRIAGE we need to modify social security. By revising social security we can define and limit marriage and benefits. By revising social security, you stop GAYS MARRYING!. You might here the evil liberals talk about &quot;not working&quot;, &quot;sceme to get my buddies rich&quot;, or &quot;a huge failure in the wings&quot; that will result in &quot;lower benefits&quot; but they are pro-gay marrying terrorist who seek at nothing to destroy or nation of liberty and freedom... blah blah blah Freedom blah blah LIBERTY! blah blah freedom and liberty!</div>

		<div>The Democrats already have a plan - raise the age, raise the taxes, or close the lockbox.  They tried lockbox - the uneducated public (fed by the Conservative Media) killed Gore with all the jokes, cause they didn't understand what he was talking about.  Talking about age or taxes (and it will have to be taxes, age is a non-starter - just because people live longer doesn't mean that those extra years are years they are physically able to WORK in) is political suicide unless the other side is willing to talk back, so they won't mention that until the Republicans give them some assurances which they seem to not want to do.  But the reason they are saying now there &quot;isn't a problem&quot; now is because it's not the problem the Republicans say is there - SS is not, and never was, a retirement fund, which is what all this private account crap is about - SS is a social safety net, no matter how many times people reword things to use the word &quot;retirement&quot;.  The Republican plan is basically to change what SS is, not to fix it or improve it</div>

I don’t blame Hughes, I blame the near impossibility of going against the AARP, the apatchy of Gen X and Gen Y, who will be most harmed by SS in the 2020s-2042, and Politicians who spend money today that they should be saving.</div>

Domestically, he just got bankruptcy reform, some Tort Reform, and at least tried and tackled the SS problem when everyone else was afraid too.  For a second term, it’s actually pretty impressive so far.   <br />

I also reject that Karen Hughes was exiled, I think that Bush places far more importance on Foreign policy than SS, so he placed his most trusted advisor on what he considers most important.</div>
