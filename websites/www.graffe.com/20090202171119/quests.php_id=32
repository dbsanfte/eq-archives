  <p align="left"><b>You say, "Hail, Councilman Srethix"</b><br>
  <br>
Councilman Srethix regards you with narrow eyes, then smiles. "Greetings, _____. I am Councilman Srethix of Kartis. It is good to see some new visitors to our little corner of the cosmos. I certainly hope you can find what you are looking for here in the Myrist library. Unfortunately, I'm sorry to say that I am quite busy seeking some rare books at the moment, and I do not have much time for light conversation. Otherwise, I believe my aid Garuuk may have some chores he could use help with. That is, if you feel up to it." <br>
<br>
  <b>You say, "what rare books?" <br>
  </b> <br>
Councilman Srethix glares at Garuuk and turns back to you. "You are interested in a job seeking knowledge, yes? Very well, I think I may have something suitable for you. I happen to be seeking an ancient tome containing some valuable information about artifacts of power. I have learned this book is somewhere in our very own library but so far Garuuk has been unable to locate it. Find me the Tome of Dark Power and I may see what other jobs I can pass along to you." <br>
<br>
  <font color="#CC99FF">&nbsp;.::
The book spawns on a bookshelf in the library at +50, +1050, -60. On the bottom shelf, you'll see a large slanted book... under it is the book you need. Pick it up and hand it to Srethix. 
  ::.</font><br>
<br>
Councilman Srethix says, "Very impressive, this little tome has eluded my aid for quite some time now. How good of you to discover its whereabouts and bring it to me. But from the looks of it, this book has a strong, magically-sealed lock upon its cover. I wonder if Elder Tal Almad would know how to break it? Take this to him in the Plane of Tranquility and let him have a look at it. If he can open it, bring it back to me." <br>
<br>
  <font color="#CC99FF">.::
Go to the Plane of Tranquility and you'll see Elder Tal Almad near the zone in. 
  ::.</font><br>
<br>
You say, "Hail, Elder Tal Almad"<br>
Elder Tal Almad says, "Welcome traveler, are you here to meet with someone or are you new to this place?" <br>
<br>
  <font color="#CC99FF">.:: Give Elder Tal Almad the book ::.</font><br>
  <br>
Elder Tal Almad looks the book over carefully, "This is a most interesting find indeed. You seek to break the seal that surrounds this tome? This may take some time, please be patient.' As he waves his hand over the lock and mumbles a few syllables, the clasp instantly falls open. With a surprised look he says, 'That was odd, the seal was easier to break then I thought it would be. It's almost. . . Well, it's almost as if the book had a will to be opened. I sense much power inside this tome, you best be careful with it." He hands the book back to you. <br>
<br>
  <font color="#CC99FF">.::
Go back to Plane of Knowledge and hand the book to Srethix again. ::.</font><br>
  <br>
Councilman Srethix says, "It's good to see my instincts about the Elder were correct." He opens the book, begins thumbing through the pages, and frowns. "What's this? Some pages are missing, eight of them to be exact. I'm afraid this book will be of no use to me without those pages. You can have it. I wonder what happened to them, whomever had this book before must have removed them for some reason. If you find the missing pages somewhere, be sure to close them up inside the book and return it to me." <br>
<br>
  <font color="#CC99FF">.::
He gives you the book back as a container. You must now find the following pages which are scattered on various MoBs throughout the first tier planes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19. Once you have combined these all in the book, bring it to Srethix for a nice cloak.
