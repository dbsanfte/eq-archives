It takes a bit of learning to get this camp down, but when you do the rewards 
are great (Great XP, 4-5 plat swords/axes on every guard, Validus Custodus 
armor, and loose plat. Make sure you have a Rallic Pack or something of the 
sort.) If you want to, you can try to learn on SOW, but RS3 is all I've needed. 
There are two sets of spawns in the area: The Tavern/Stair guards, and the 
Bank/Left Cave Halfing Guards. Always pull the tavern/stair guards first to 
break the camp. In my strategy, I run around them in circles far enough away 
from the bank guards to not aggro them to get the group close together enough to 
snare them. Then, I run behind the tavern and click my TFlux staff till they are 
out of range, then turn around and Atol's them. Then I get up on the wall and 
pass them, and once at a good range I start using my Pillars. You can go back 
out into the main area for the nuking, just don't get too close to the bank. (I 
chain-nuke with PoL and Pillar of Frost.) Once the guards are dead, loot, med. 
When ready, pull the bank and halfling guards and repeat.<br>
