		<div>Lets start a new bug / fixes list the one from xara was out-dated and a lot of the stuff in that post has been addressed or is working as intended.<br />
<br />
I hear dev's are doing a quick fix pass(non code related fixes) slated for GU3 so lets see if we can complie a list of stuff and I'll send a pm over to talisker and aviar on the soe forums with the completed list, and hope for the best.  At least its &quot;somthing&quot; more than what we have now which is nothing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<u>Chromantic Halo</u><br />
***edit*** My toon was bugged, Learning this ability is working fine.<br />
However the description on the mobs still says +50% spell reduction, and they take just that 50% less spell damage with the buff up.  <br />
<br />
<u>Finishers</u><br />
When using flamespear our 1st and 2nd fire finisher will not activate if past 30m range.  only our 1st and 2nd cold finishers will light up and be usable.<br />
<br />
<u>Z axis bugs with Conical abilities</u><br />
Color spray &amp; 1st/2nd cold finishers.<br />
If you are on un'even terrain you have to pan your camera up / down via PgUp and PgDn keys so that you can hit your target if standing above / below them, and if you dont hit the mob due to Z axis the refresh timer is incurred.<br />
<br />
<u>Seradon's falling star</u><br />
The ability is very underpowered.  The cast time is just too long for the damage it deals.  It needs a significant damage boost or cast time reduction.  many have been asking for this to be our large single target nuke.  If possible up the damage and remove the chance to root.<br />
<br />
<u>taqmir's barrage</u><br />
This ability needs a minor tweak, a damage boost/higher crit bonus or cast time reduction will go a long way to making it more used ability.<br />
<br />
<u>Chaos volley</u><br />
still get epic / legendary self feedback damage from this, and we still get feedback damage when it is resisted.<br />
We can get partial resists on the feedback damage inflicted to us be never a full resist unless we use our arcane immunity self buff.<br />
<br />
<u>Energy shards</u><br />
There is a bug in that if you cast an energy shard while wearing a Quicksilver ring, and log out(for an extended period of time) while the refresh timer is counting down, when you log back in you will have the full 1 hour recast restriction placed on it.<br />
If you log out right after the refresh timer expires at the 45m mark (with quick silver ring) and come back in say the next day you will incur the 1 hour recast restriction.  <br />
You must wait the full hour after casting the shard, or when you log back in you will have the 1 hour recast lockout.<br />
<br />
<u>Energy rift</u><br />
This ability does not scale very well at higher levels.  its power cost is very high, when coupled with the high endurance cost. Currently its more efficient to use fireball for more damage and less power and less endurance.  Can the endurance or energy cost get re-evaluated and reduced on higher lvl versions?<br />
<br />
<u>icequake</u><br />
The scaling on this spell is non existant.  it has the same snare duration as the first version, and there is zero reason to use the highest lvl version.  The power cost on this ability is also very high, and needs a reduction.<br />
<br />
<u>Mantle of ether</u><br />
This dropped group lvl 50 spell has the same arcane resistance (270) as the single target arcane debuff we get at lvl 50.  It needs a slight upgrade.  <br />
<br />
<u>Firebarrier 3</u><br />
The scaling on firebarrier 1 and 2 are very good.  The scaling on the &quot;energy regeneration&quot; from firebarrier 2 to firebarrier 3 is very poor.  it goes from 22 per 6s to 26 per 6s. or a net gain of 4 energy per 6s.  Can this get looked into and increased if neccessary?<br />
<br />
<u>Disperse / reflect group wards</u><br />
counterspelling with disperse/reflect will still sometimes drop the ward from all group members.  For example if you have both wards up and the mob casts a spell you disperse it, the log will indicate each member of the party dispersed the spell and the spell ward is removed from each of them.  The same holds true for reflect.<br />
I know a few have asked to have back the single target version of this spell, a single target 3.0s cast while keeping the group 6.0s cast.  Is this feasable?<br />
<br />
<u>Char</u><br />
This spell needs a small damage increase and could use it by increasing the number of dot ticks by an additional 6 seconds for a total of 10s or 5 dot ticks 1 per 2s.<br />
<br />
<u>Forget</u><br />
This spell still does not appear to be reducing hate other than the 2.0s of cast time of not dealing damage.<br />
<br />
<u>Magic Immunity Self Buffs (sanctuary lines)</u><br />
Ethereal sanctuary - the +300 to arcane resistance after the 15second immunity wears off does not stack with our self arcane buff.  At lvl 50 we can self buff 270 to arcane, this barrier gives us only +30 since it does not stack.  We think they should stack.<br />
The rest- We would like to see each one on a separate timer and not linked.</div>

		<div>Chromatic Halo <br />
- agreed<br />
<br />
Finishers <br />
- agreed. Noticed this as well, I doubt it's working as intended (tm) so a fix would be nice.<br />
<br />
Z axis bugs with Conical abilities - <br />
hmm havn't really noticed this but I don't doubt its there, also not sure these conical abilities are supposed/intended to spread in the Z axis?<br />
<br />
Seradon's falling star <br />
agreed that it's underpowered. But if you want to up the damage and remove chance to root you basically have another Flamespear but with shorter range. No real need for this. <br />
I'm not sure why we got this spell in the first place, it doesn't really bring much new or flavor to the table. My suggestion would be to remove this spell and replace it with a longer (minute long) DoT spelline. Not asking for something as good as the more dot-based casters got, but a small longlasting DoT would be cool. <br />
<br />
taqmir's barrage<br />
I'm not sure I agree on this one. Its pretty much only asking to make the class more powerful, and this spell has its uses. I'm sure you noticed in groups with the right buffs its possible to get the casttime on this very fast.<br />
<br />
Chaos volley<br />
I agree on the crit feedback on this spell, this should be removed. But I don't understand why we shouldn't get feedback if the mob resists the spell? That's something the mob does, and shouldn't affect its feedback. Just remove the chance of crit on the feedback and this would be enough.<br />
<br />
Energy shards <br />
Yes, please have a look at this. Annoying bug.<br />
<br />
Energy rift<br />
Agree somewhat, the last version need damage upped a little to be worth using. But I like the endurance cost, its adds a demand for at least one item with +end regen (which helps a ton). You know you can put resonating crystals of recovery on more than chest, as description says. Get situational AE gear and you'll notice big difference!<br />
<br />
icequake<br />
Agree somewhat, maybe we don't need as many versions of this spell? Agree the energy cost is a bit high, but I love the no-limit (that I've noticed) to how many mobs it can affect (unlike in EQ where it was 4). Nothing like the rush of pulling 9 (my record so far) mobs with it and go at them with fireball, to be totally out of energy when they all drop :)<br />
<br />
Mantle of ether <br />
- agree, a little bonus would be in order<br />
<br />
Firebarrier 3<br />
Maybe a few points more on it, but again if you increase this too much there would be less demand for +energy regen on gear. Gearing up should be about having to make choices, sacrificing one thing to gain another. When you power-up abilities it calls for a look on other classes, and you're back on sqare one balance wise.<br />
<br />
Disperse / reflect group wards <br />
- Agree, gief self only version.<br />
<br />
Char<br />
Nah, see previons comments about increasing abilities, also my suggestion for a longer lasting dot instead of S falling star could help with this.<br />
<br />
Forget <br />
- Agree, and this is one of my major concerns. Please have a look at this spell. It can't be working as intended (tm).<br />
<br />
Magic Immunity Self Buffs (sanctuary lines)<br />
Don't really agree, having them on separate timers may be too powerful for the PvPers, maybe also in PvE, but I have to admit I havn't played much with these spells other than the first one for CV feedback..</div>

		<div>As others have said the refresh on the energy shards is often very glitchy and keeps reseting.  Also there sometimes used to be problems with binding and logging off when levitating though this might have been fixed by now since it doesn't seem to have been a problem recently.  I agree that Taqmir's Barrage, Flamespear, and Seradon's FS should be tweaked some.  Taq's and Flamespear are useful however the range limitations should be mitigated somewhat on Flamespear and Taqmir's Bolts/Barrage, though it has uses, should be made more viable in comparison to Chaos Volley.  Adding an arcane or ice version of char might be a good idea as well.  <br />
<br />
And most of all positively make Asaya's Insight possible to cast on other players.  It is far, far more logical if it can be used on other players; there is no reason to keep it self only.</div>

		<div>For me the top priority would be fixing the glitches around spell counter. I understand that changing the interface would be too big for GU3 (also I would really like it done) but damage assigned to the wrong person, spells overcastting spells (how can a mob cast two spells at the same time?) that I don’t know what I actually counter, feedback if someone else countered already the spell and spell counter consuming wards (which is for me the biggest glitch) should be not too big of a task.<br />
<br />
The spell tweaking is a question of taste. Some of your suggestions, I would not agree to. <br />
The recast timer glitch is a bug. I agree it should get fixed soon. <br />
The ward drop is a bug, creating a single target version is not a fix. <br />
Seradon's Falling Star is a nice spell, not very useful I agree, but I don’t see the need to change the concept of the spell. <br />
I think Taqmir's Barrage’s worth depends on your equipment. With high crit equipment (and some spell haste) it does decent damage and it’s save to cast. <br />
The Chaos Volley self crits may only be an issue with high int/sdf/sdr (legendary crit from the 13th and 14th cast may kill me but legendary crits are rare and I usually don’t need the 13th and 14th cast to get a dead mob if I go with the crit finisher). I can’t remember dying from them without some stupidity on my side involved as well. I don’t see why the resist from the mob should have effect on the casters feedback. <br />
Energy Rift does not scale well. Most of the spells don’t scale well. Mob is scaling but is at all levels to easy. I think Vanguard follows the concept of small encounters (the CC limitations and game engine going down in performance with larger encounters are examples for this). Building strong AE spells will trivialize content or just wipe your group if the mob is not trivial (AE kiting is the only use I currently see for AE spells, do you think AE was put in game to safely kite large mob groups?). Based on this, I really don’t know if it makes sense to change this without changing a lot more in the game as well. For Icequake it is the same.<br />
Forget is still a puzzle to me. If you get aggro, this spell will not help you. The spell is even not able to lower the aggro in a way that you don’t get back aggro when the effect of a rescue wears off (and I assume the tank taunts during the rescue duration as well).</div>

How do you count the wards? If you talk about the different damage types the mob, I’ve seen so far, does only one type of damage. So I think that can’t be what you meant. <br />
I can have a disperse and a reflection ward in addition to Chromatic Barrier and Chromantic Halo up at he same time, I can even counter spells but all wards (ok not Chromantic Halo as far as I have seen in that short time) are gone at he same time. So I think that also can’t be what you meant.<br />
I had only a short time to test Chromantic Halo (as I said I was not 50 at that time and I don’t grouped again with the person so far) but the mob beat me almost dead with out triggering the Chromantic Halo wards. Therefore I think the spell is of limited use.<br />
What experiences do you have with the wards? Maybe they are different then mine. Do you use Chromatic Barrier often? I tried it only few times but I start to miss Fire Barrier very fast and I switch back. Have you already learned Chromantic Halo?</div>

As i showed, Taqmir synergises incredibly well with Critic/Int, but still suffers from its 3 second casting time.<br />
It should be lowered to 2.5 so as to be able to hit the GCD with 10% worn Haste.<br />
ATM you need 15% worn haste, thats just fubar.<br />

		<div>I have really difficulties to disagree with you on the rune thing. I don’t have the experience to predict what the future holds but if I would be a developer and if I developed a cool mob ability I would not like that a stupid rune is killing my cool ability. It would be really too bad if that would be the same for the counter system as well. It would scrap a functionality I really liked (even it needs some major improvement).<br />
<br />
I agree Seradon's Falling Star is not a very useful spell. My point was: just don’t change it to something totally different. It is one of the few cold based damage spells and cold based spells have the concept of movement restrictions. The spell was introduced late and the designer was over careful not to create something too powerful. I think most of the spells have a scaling issue, Seradon's Falling Star is just one other example. The fire based stun is not in line with the concept in my opinion. If you would switch something around that spells to make them consistent and useful I would be ok.<br />
<br />
I don’t know what equipment they introduce with raids. If it would possible to reach 15 haste without sacrificing too much else would the current Taqmir then ok with you? I think you should not design abilities around current equipment gaps. I’ve seen this too often and in most cases it totally messed up the system when they addressed the gaps.<br />
<br />
I did not understand you CV comment. Maybe you could rephrase your suggestion?<br />
<br />
If Forget really has the effect written on the tool tip your suggestion would make Forget more desirable but I think the power cost would then needed to be lowered as well.</div>

		<div>for those of you opposed to most of my tweaks and suggestions, you have to remember that the biggest complaint people seem to have about sorc is how simple they are to play in a group due to spamming cv 1,2,3,4.<br />
<br />
I'm expecting a nerf to CV sooner or later, and the only way to cushion that nerf is to boost up taqs, char, and falling star.<br />
<br />
This will also have the adverse affect of giving viable choices to use for dps while grouping.  Char with additional ticks will make weaving it in with other spells more possible, adding an additional level of complexity if one so desires.<br />
<br />
Taq's is only disadvantage if we remove CV from our lineup is its cast time.  If CV stays the way it is for good, it will need a large boost in damage as well.<br />
<br />
Falling star needs improving.  Easiest way is to remove the root chance, which may be detracting from its damage capability.  I personally feel falling star should be our biggest single target damage nuke.  I know there have been other discussions and posts about making this our big nuke, and for the most part I agree with that view.<br />
<br />
ER needs scaling tweaks<br />
When you first get ER, you can kill 2 dots in 3-4 casts.  Over time it slowly looses that ability, at lvl 50 unless you get lucky with a mimic crit on ER, you aren't going to kill a 2 dot in 3-4 casts.  I understand now why people complained about this ability, because for some, it was a playstyle to them to plop on force barrier and ER 3-4 2 dots dead.  Unfortunately this is only viable in the lower lvls.<br />
Secondly when you compare ER to fireball in terms of energy costs, and total damage, you can see how underpowered ER truely is.  Fireball deals approximately the same total damage as ER, costs less power and is usable from range and doesnt cost endurance.<br />
IF the end cost on ER was removed I dont think anyone would complain about it, however since we know it will stay the energy cost needs a severe reduction, it should cost much less than fireball and deal more damage because of the risk associated with ae'ing mobs within mele range.<br />
<br />
Icequake's scaling is just fubar.  How can you introduce an AE snare and never upgrade it's duration from the first ability to the last.  This makes everyone use the first version because lets face it, the only reason to use it is to snare, not to deal damage, and since the durations dont increase its more power efficient to use the first version that costs much less energy to cast.  Thus allowing more snare casts and longer ae kites.  If the power costs are not adjusted dramatically the snare durations must be rescaled.</div>

you have to remember this is primarilly a pve game.  pvp balancing should not enter a pve discussion and vice versa.<br />
<br />
also, there are many abilities in pvp that ward / rune/ against mele/spell abilities. <br />
<br />
giving sorc the ability to rune against all 6 for 15 seconds with a long long recast imho is not overpowered.   You have to first reconginze who is attacking you, with what abilities, know by memory what 3 schools that class can use, then click off each of those abilities in succession (which would take 6 seconds) if you were not already dead at that time, you might survive long enough to evac.<br />
<br />
the restrictions are already in place on these<br />
long recast<br />
bound by the 2.0s global cooldown.<br />
15s duration<br />
<br />
if you wanted to try to have all 6 up at the same time you would end up running out of immunity in 3 seconds on the first one you casted at the 12th second mark.<br />
<br />
so i dont see how having them separate will be an issue?</div>

		<div>Sasami, If I had to guess Chrom Barrier will be much more usefull in raids (even if the ward is borked the +resists are V.Nice), where you'll have energy regen and haste buffs from other classes to compensate for the loss of Flame Barrier.<br />
I do use CB solo fighting some casters and grouped fighting mobs with AE, but it seems to just be a fairly situational spell.<br />
<br />
Seradons is truly a disapointment to me, maybe when the spell is fixed (the 25% root is just fluff) the graphic could be beefed up a little. I'd like to see a bigger ice chunk and more ice shards sprayed after impact :evil:<br />
<br />
I would prefer a damage increase with taq was dealt with by increasing its already greater crit chance by a few percent per rank. That would give it more substance by increasing its output and keep with the flavor. (assuming crit trully is not capped) Oh and adding the bonus crit % to its tool tip would be lovely ;)</div>

		<div>I don’t know how raid is going to turn out. I could be death all the time with Chromatic Barrier up or it could be a real live saver. I think you will be right with the buffs from the other classes but I will final know only when raid is in. I will wait and see.<br />
<br />
You use CB in solo against caster mob? Bow using mob I’m dead anyway and melee mob should not reach me because I’m kiting. I did not meet a lot of caster mob so far but I try to avoid soloing because I like the interaction of people in groups. In groups I usually do more damage to myself then the mob is doing with AE to me. If the AE is really serious I try to counter it with the reflection ward. I’ve seen rarely mob with serious AEs, overall encounter in VG are in my opinion to easy and I hope this will change with raids.<br />
<br />
25% root is fluff. I don’t care so much about the graphical effects if I need to turn it of because of bad performance. I think VG has a long way to go before improved graphic effects will not be over shaded by bad performance.<br />
<br />
You need to see the improved crit chance for taq in relation to the max crit chance you can reach fully buffed and with max gear.<br />
Two percent more crits is nothing if you go from 10% crit to 12% crit but it gets serious if it moves your chance from 96% to 98% (it halves the non crit casts) and it gets stupid if it increases the chance from 100% to 102%. I don’t know where we are today, my equipment is not so well but I’ve seen people saying lots of the casts are already crits. Increasing crit chance has a scaling issue. You will reach a limit sometimes. If I would need to design this stuff I would be very careful with crits.<br />

				<div style="font-style:italic">How do you count the wards? If you talk about the different damage types the mob, I&#8217;ve seen so far, does only one type of damage. So I think that can&#8217;t be what you meant. <br />
I can have a disperse and a reflection ward in addition to Chromatic Barrier and Chromantic Halo up at he same time, I can even counter spells but all wards (ok not Chromantic Halo as far as I have seen in that short time) are gone at he same time. So I think that also can&#8217;t be what you meant.<br />
I had only a short time to test Chromantic Halo (as I said I was not 50 at that time and I don&#8217;t grouped again with the person so far) but the mob beat me almost dead with out triggering the Chromantic Halo wards. Therefore I think the spell is of limited use.<br />
What experiences do you have with the wards? Maybe they are different then mine. Do you use Chromatic Barrier often? I tried it only few times but I start to miss Fire Barrier very fast and I switch back. Have you already learned Chromantic Halo?</div>

<br />
A lot of questions ;)<br />
<br />
1. I count them as: 1x Reflect for each spell type from chromatic halo, 1x Mirror ward, 1x Dispersion Ward and 1x Chromatic Halo (i'm counting it only once here, cause i consider recasting it as soon as one of its bubbles is gone)<br />
<br />
2. The wards are &quot;working as intended&quot; imho in pve: per spell casted on you, you'll loose one ward (tho i've experienced some &quot;normal&quot; attacks from mobs seem to be considered as spells, i.e. you disperse one real spell casted on you -&gt; 1. message like &quot;your mirror ward has reflected XY's Spell&quot; and at the same time you'll get a 2nd message like &quot;your dispersion ward has dispersed XY's attack&quot;)<br />
<br />
3. My experiences with the wards are good when it comes to grouping: as soon as everyone is there, i cast the two barriers and chromatic halo with a precedent amplify effectivity. Once i get the mobs turning to me, this gives the tank a few seconds to regain aggro, the healer to switch to me and me some time to fully burn the mob or deaggro ;) If you have an eye on your aggro you should be able to recast all the wards again after the fight.<br />
On the other hand, all the wards are useless while soloing, cause if you're fighting a caster mob, its either a 2/3dot which you should be able to burn anyway or a 4dot+ which takes too long to kill to keep your wards up during the fight.</div>

		<div>It really comes back to equipment. If you compare a green equipped Sorcerer with a yellow equipped Rouge, the Sorcerer does not look good. But it it’s true the other way around as well. Even defensive melee looks good against a green equipment Sorcerer. All that class balancing is so meaningless if equipment has such effects.<br />
<br />
Please don’t balance classes, the only thing which matters: is the class fun to play.<br />
<br />
I really don’t have a problem that Rouges do good damage with good equipment because Sorcerers do decent damage with good equipment as well.</div>

My experience is that per spell cast you loos all your wards in 80%. It does not really matter if you reflect the spell or not, the ward is gone in most cases.<br />
<br />
For fighting in groups, that spell counter trigger wards does not matter much because the ward of the other group member (tank usually I guess) is gone. But because you where not target of the initial spell, you kept your ward.<br />
<br />
The ward protects you from the first hit of the mob, when the tank looses aggro. With high avoidance you may easily survive two attacks, which gives the tank enough time for a rescue. The ward protects you from melee hits as well. I don’t know from where you get the information that this is working as intended. I never saw an official statement how it should work. I think it is ‘working as “you” expected’.<br />
<br />
For group combat the current behaviour is acceptable for me because I get the useful effect. From the game mechanic point of few I think it’s not correct (and correct game mechanics has again nothing to do with ‘working as intended’). I think the term should be reserved for developers who like to say: ‘I’m not going to look into the details of this and nothing will be done for the issue in the next two month’ but have only time for writing 3 words.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry for ticking off on that phrase. But I really hate it.</div>

Nothing of your concrete suggestions, but nerving CV and putting recast on spells would do. I hate when I have to cycle through spells just because everything else is on recast.<br />
<br />
My statement, that classes loose there profile, was not directed against your suggestions (I responded in more detail what I think about your suggestion in another post) instead it was a response to your expectation that CV get nerved. I think that would be the first step to loose the quick and focused cast of Sorcerer game play that is the fun for me.</div>

Our DPS with a good tank is kinda crazy. <br />
These 20K double backstables are far more common than you think.<br />
<br />
I dont envy him, and i dont complain.<br />
When the fights are under 18 seconds (all ToT mobs) he does more dmg than me.<br />
When the fights are over 20 seconds (RI Bosses) i do more dmg than him.<br />
<br />
Nerfing CV will make it useless (it already sucks for a fast pulling group).<br />
What we need a huge boost so that our other spells become better than CV for 14 second fights.<br />
Sure some of them might compete (see my spreadsheet) with 50% spell haste.<br />
But the manacost is so horrible, you'd have to be retarded to use them.</div>

I understand your CV comment and I did not argue against that point. Just the opposite, I think messing around with CV will do no good. <br />
<br />
I’m not sure I would need the damage boost for fights less then 14 seconds because I don’t need any fights of less then 14 seconds (I’m looking for challenging fights and I can’t imagine what could be challenging with a less then 14 seconds fights).

Actually it was illusive i wanted to quote but nevermind.<br />
I would like to do &quot;more dmg&quot; on short encounters.<br />
Because in a &quot;good group&quot; stuff just dies too fast.<br />
It has been that way since lvl25 in Trengal...<br />
Of course it would be foolish to ask for something that would reliably put me above a rogue.<br />
<br />
But what are our options ?<br />
1) Under 10 Seconds : CV<br />
2) From 10 to 20 Seconds : CV<br />
3) From 20 to 28 Seconds : CV<br />
<br />
Why Because CV is just better than our other spells.<br />
You could make &quot;other spells&quot; compete with CV dps wise.<br />
But for that you would need 20% worn spell haste.<br />
Needless to say, you will be gimping yourself hardcore if you go that way.<br />
<br />
And even if you accept to gimp yourself with 20% worn spell haste.<br />
You will still be using TWO times more mana than with CV.<br />
<br />
<br />
So what do i want ?<br />
I want &quot;fast brutal expensive&quot; spells, that can put me near a rogue.<br />
But at the price of mediocre efficiency.  <br />
<br />
Taqmir is kinda of a good example.<br />
It does more dmg than CV, it costs more mana than CV.<br />
But for it to work, you need a very specific gear set (Haste/Critic).<br />
<br />
And one spell that will put me &quot;above&quot; the rogue, at the price of horrible efficiency.</div>

		<div>Flordiel minitrees have a &quot;long range stun&quot; that ignores your runes.<br />
So do the Magehunter/Magekiller on Island of Madness.<br />
<br />
The best part about these ? No range.<br />
I've been stunned at 45+ range.<br />
<br />
Anyway about the lady, it happens a LOT..<br />
Mayor Tressam's Snare/DoT or DoT, her DoT  the list is just too long.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit : BTW something i dont think everyone knows....<br />
<br />
There are 4 types of attacks.<br />
<br />
A) Auto-attack : These are the basic melee, and are not affected by runes at all<br />
Also they are not affected by &quot;silence&quot; since they are not &quot;casted&quot;.<br />
<br />
B) Special Attacks : I expect these to be reflected by runes <br />
These cost endurance for players, and are considered as spells (cant use when silenced)<br />
<br />
C) Procs : They can come from Auto-attack or specials.<br />
I know reflect works on them, because Old Targonor skeletons can be stunned for 18sec by runes.<br />
This spell is cast only when in melee, and only when attacked, i expect this to be a &quot;1 charge proc buff&quot;.<br />
<br />
D) Casted Spells : No comment<br />
<br />
<br />
So depending on what type off attack, runes should act differently.<br />
I am still curious about how archery works...<br />
But with the unreliability of runes, you cant know.<br />
<br />
However since melees cant use &quot;specials&quot; when silenced, these specials are considered as &quot;spells&quot;.<br />
So Runes should protect us.</div>

		<div>Few things I wanna say after reading through this thread again.<br />
<br />
I like spells to have pros and cons, it's about having to make choices and value situations, not having everything be good at all times which it seems most people here would prefer. That would only make it more dull, in my opinion. For example the range thing on Flamespear is something you gotta consider before using it, no it's not gonna be good 2 feet from the mob. This spell is a good opener, but that's it, and the way it should be used, again imo. <br />
<br />
A lot of complaints here also on Seradon's star nuke, and I agree with these comments and I'm not sure what this spell is supposed to bring that we didn't have already, other than that it's cold based. <br />
<br />
Also to comment a bit on Emilia's comparison with his Rogue mate, I wouldn't look as much on what other classes have and don't have, but this is just my attitude to playing these games and class balance... Playing a rogue is a very different experience than playing a sorceror, just go with whatever class you're having the most fun with. If the rogue has higher DPS in short fights? Good for him! I'd look for a rogue when I set up groups!<br />
<br />
Last I think sorcerors are in fairly good shape, but there's a few tweaks I'd like to see:<br />
<br />
-All bugs regarding timers, wards and counters must be fixed!<br />
-Forget line needs looked at, this spell appears to do nothing. <br />
-Insight buff castable on others.<br />
-I'd still like to see a 60 or 90 sec DoT for sorcerors, just enough to be worth casting during long fights, also with upcoming raid encounters in mind.</div>

<br />
Very good list.  I find it delightful that many others agree with the proposition that Asaya's Insight should be useable on others.  It would fit so well with the class theme.  <br />
<br />
I also agree that, if more dds are added, they should be innovative and not redundant.  Emilia's <br />
suggestion of &quot;fast brutal expensive spells&quot; would help fill this niche as would an arcane/ice type char that would be similar to the char itself yet have sufficiently different characteristics such as focusing more on the subsequent damage.  <br />
<br />
The class has enough wards and enough crowd control.  What is needed are some tweaks to the damage options and refinement of the anti-magic defense ability and to become more unique.  Self-only junk hopefully is not being contemplated in place of substantive ideas.</div>

This is incorrect. Special Attacks are considered whatever they are flagged as. Melee specials costing endurance are flagged as melee attacks and do work when silenced.<br />
<br />
Some classes like the Shaman have specials that cost endurance and are flagged as spells, but those are the exception, and they usually cost energy <b>and </b>endurance.</div>

I am lucky enough to do some testing in APW and i have some dreadfull news :<br />
<b><font color="Red">Wards Dismiss/Counterspell seems to be useless vs Bosses.</font></b><br />
<br />
Now of course this is not a surprise to anyone, and as i have already said many many<br />
times, if you expected yourself to rune out of a Dragons AE or Dismiss a God you are naive.<br />
<br />
<br />
Since Grimoire is MIA, and Cylus will be gone soon, something has to be done.<br />
I will be sending an email to someone in SoE to talk to him about a huge part<br />
of our class that will become useless with raids..<br />
<br />
This is the email, please feel free to add any ideas suggestions :<br />

				The sorcerer class is build around 2 core ideas : DPS + Caster Disruption.<br />
This is why we have skills as Nulling/Reflective Wards and Reflect/Dismiss<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><font color="red">A) Spell Runes</font></b><br />
<br />
For a long long time, sorcerers used to have 2 spell runes/wards.<br />
Nulling Ward &amp; Reflective Ward.<br />
<br />
These were single target wards that either &quot;nulled&quot; or &quot;reflected&quot; a spell.<br />
I do not remember the manacost, but the casting time was 3.0 seconds.<br />
<br />
You could &quot;prebuff&quot; the entire group, and thus protect them from 2 spells.<br />
But it would take 24 to 36 seconds to do that.<br />
<br />
At some point, the wards were changed in theory for the better.<br />
They became &quot;Group Nulling Ward&quot; and &quot;Group Reflective Ward&quot; <br />
with a casting time of 6.0 seconds. <br />
<br />
Which means that with the adequate setup, a sorcerer can do a FULL group<br />
Warding every 3 seconds. <br />
 <br />
Quite Obviously, this just killed all the AEs in the game.<br />
(This was already a very overpowered for single group content, <br />
but vs a Dragon 4 sorcerer in 4 groups = AE totally negated). <br />
<br />
All the mobs we tested yesturday ignored my runes.<br />
The &quot;Curse Guy&quot; has a DoT and a Curse, both which ignored my runes<br />
The &quot;2 Adds Guy&quot; has an AE Stun, which ignored my runes <br />
I did not see any spells for X99, but they will probably be ignored too.<br />
<br />
<br />
This point is very important, because it is with fire/cold/arcane resist<br />
the only buffs a sorcerer has to help a group. We help fight casters.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<b><font color="Red">B) Dismiss/Reflect</font></b><br />
<br />
These two skills are also related to &quot;caster fighting&quot;.<br />
As their name implies they are used to fight casters.<br />
<br />
They work like &quot;Counterspell and Reflect&quot; in Magic the Gathering.<br />
Any spell cast by your target, can be either dismissed, or reflected back to him.<br />
<br />
Again, for all raid mobs we tested yesturday, my Dismiss/Reflect were ignored.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
While it is worth noting that both Wards/Dismiss have been acting unreliably (fubar)<br />
since beta (every sorcerer will tell you they are half bugged), it is clear that <br />
you will have to be na&#239;ve to expect 1 person to be able to &quot;shut down&quot; a dragon.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
<b><font color="red">C) Conclusion &amp; Solutions</font></b><br />
<br />
While i am really greatfull towards the person that came up with the idea<br />
it lacks some insight for &quot;real life application&quot;.<br />
 <br />
To be honest, i do not see any solution regarding these skills for a Sorcerer <br />
(at least under their current version).<br />
 <br />
If they are made operationnal in raids, they are very very very overpowered.<br />
And if you make events tuned around them, 4 sorcerer will be mandatory for<br />
maximum Warding speed in every event with AE. <br />
It is the same problem EQ had with &quot;stun&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can probably add gimmick spells/AEs on trash to make<br />
sorcerer secondary function (caster disruptor) usefull, but i dont like gimmicks.<br />
(See Hunter Tranquil Shot in WoW). <br />
This does not help my class, or balance the fact Wards/Dismiss are overpowered.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<font color="Lime"><b>D) The only solution would be a change to the Mechanics of the class.</b></font><br />
<br />
You are not the &quot;Sorcerer&quot; dev, so asking for &quot;class chances&quot; is a long shot.<br />
However, i hope that you may be able to transfer my mail to someone that can look<br />
into this issue, because it is more of a class problem than raid problem. <br />
<br />
What do i propose ?<br />
<br />
Delete Nulling Ward<br />
-&gt; Replace it by a &quot;Single Target Rune Ward&quot; that eats spell damage <br />
   The damage absorbed increases with level (exactly like spellshield).<br />
   Making sure Chaos Volley feedback is ignored by this ward. <br />
   Slow enough be useless for in fight group buffing but fast enough to be usable.<br />
   (Like when we had Wizards do Spellshield rotation in PoTime for Tallon Zek Procs)<br />
<br />
Delete Reflecting Ward<br />
-&gt; Replace it by a &quot;Self Only Rune&quot; <br />
   A copy of the Clicky on : <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3719" target="_blank">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3719</a><br />
   That will help sorcerers be less fragile, and more enduring.<br />
   Making sure Chaos Volley feedback is ignored by this ward.<br />
<br />
Add A Counterspell : Sorcerer's Discretion<br />
-&gt; Aggro will probably be a huge problem in raids. <br />
   Specially because of the 15% miss rate vs lvl53 mobs with full defensive tanks.<br />
   Since we cant expect to Dismiss/Reflect spell cast by bosses, this will help. <br />
   What should it do ? : Channels a bit of the Residual energy left <br />
by your target's spell to reduce your hate by X% for 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
I do agree that my changes will weaken our class (specially in AE debuff heavy zones),<br />
But if we do not have overpowered abilities, encounters can be tuned easily.<br />
<br />
<br />
Xennumet with a sorcerer is trivial (since silence will almost never land on anyone).<br />
Without a sorcerer its really really tricky (25 sec silence = dead group).<br />
<br />
<br />
