    Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: Alrighty, not sure if anyone is still keeping 
    this a secret or whatever since PoP came out ...but I'm done with it and 
    going to spill the beans. First off to any naysayers, this is perfectly 
    doable, did it for probably 40 or so AA points. I'm going to assume whoever 
    tries this knows a thing or two about quadding and such.</span><p>
    <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana"> It took a little 
    time to find the non-warping path to quad down there but since that is 
    probably all you need to know if you're reading this here it is. Go to the 
    main area where the ladder is, start off by pulling and killing the Ice 
    Witch solo, stay away from directly near the ladder as there are two (2) 
    quad mobs there that will assist if you get too close, but as long as your 
    level is sufficient single pulling is easy. Finish Ice Witch.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Now go to the safe 
    corner, the little indented corner where the big rock is in the ground ..the 
    one opposite the side of this big area that the ladder is on. That it the 
    safe spot down there. Snare pull the 2 mobs near the ladder, then the 2 in 
    front of the dire wolf cubby hole. Round them up by making circles around 
    the 2 large rocks, go from the safe corner, to the corner a bit to left of 
    the rock opposite, you'll see it's as far as you can get on that wall. Snare 
    them then start the quad. You have just a little more time than you need to 
    go to one corner, Pillar, run around one rock to next corner, Pillar, and so 
    on. Circle should be clockwise, big rock on your right each time you run 
    around it.<br>
    <br>
    Successive pulls can be determined by any experienced quadder as to what is 
    to your liking. I always then pulled the the dire wolf cubby if four (4) in 
    there, if not ..pulled they and polar bears at ramp down. Once you are 
    pulling the bears on lower level, go to middle of the wall with no bears on 
    it to snare the ones at bottom of ramp, and then grab another two (2) down 
    there, or vice versa.<br>
    <br>
    Epic is a huge help down here but not necessary, and manastone is lovely, 
    but this is still a viable option for those lacking either that are after 
    great XP level 60 and below for a little risk. Do not to try to quad 
    elsewhere down there though aside from around those two (2) big rocks, 
    corner to corner, or they will warp onto you and make things go all ugly.<br>
    Hope this helps some people and is as productive for you as it was for me.<br>
