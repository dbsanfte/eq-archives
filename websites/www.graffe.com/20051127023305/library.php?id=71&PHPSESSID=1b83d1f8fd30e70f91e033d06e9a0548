This spot is very out of the way and typically very quiet.  You can easily spend an hour or two without seeing another person and trains are almost non-existant.<p>

Getting to the quad site requires travelling to Nadox (I use the tunnel off of Gunthak), then absconding.  The evac point is the entrance to the Shrine area and is located off of the Torgarin Mines, providing you with a zoneline if needed.<p>

The terrain leading up to the Shrine appears to have gaps in the floor that one might fall down.  Don't be fooled - you don't need to jump and there is no risk of falling into the lava.  Ignore your common sense on jumping or staying away from edges -- the programmers apparently took a short-cut on what ought to be a natural hazard.<p>

The first quad are the four Shrine Bruisers straight in front when you zone in.  Pull each with Snare and run them around the cavern a few times where you zoned in.  They bunch together easily.  Resnare and kite them back and forth using Pillar of Lightning.  You may want to resnare about 2/3 through the quad to be safe.  They occasionally resist Snare, so have Root up for pulls that resist.  4th Level Root doesn't usually last long, so I usually re-snare the rooted mob and run the others around until the root breaks, then group them together.<p>

The second quad can also be single snared but is a little more tricky.  There are two more outside the Shrine that are easy to pull.  Pull them back to the cavern area to allow you time to run back to the Shrine and pull the 3rd and 4th.  The 3rd is just inside the Shrine on the right and can be targeted by standing at the left of the Shrine on the outside.  Snare him and pull back to the others, then head back to the Shrine and snare the one straight ahead through the doorway.  Gather them together and re-snare.<p>

If your mana is sufficient, a third quad can be pulled from inside the Shrine.  You may need to root an add (snaring him to be added to the quad).  This gets risky due to the chance of the front four mobs re-spawning (about an 18 minute spawn), so time accordingly.<p>

Each mob typically drops between 2 and 10pp and usually has a Zaxthril weapon (sells for 5-6pp).  Occasionally, they drop a Rotting Tooth (9pp) and rarely mid-level gems.  There is also a Named that will rarely spawn immediately upon the death of a Shrine Bruiser.  He is easily taken but does have more hit points.  He drops a Flesh Bound Deity.  I have seen him pop once in the 10 hours or so that I have done this camp.<p>
