    *Stonegrabbers also, if you feel especially brave, but there are a lot of 
    stonegrabbers and they are very social. I have not tried because it does not 
    seem worth the effort with so many other easier things to pick on. But the 
    looting would be better--they drop gold earrings occasionally. If you are 
    careful you can avoid all the extras that would agro. They also drop armor 
    dying materials. The stonegrabbers are still dark blue with the occasional 
    light blue at level 34, so I imagine the area is viable through 35, but 
    probably not worth it with Overthere and other areas listed that are, in my 
    humble opinion, better.)<br>
    <br>
    My main interest in quad-kiting here is because I was a master tailor before 
    I took my long break, and wanted an easy place to collect pelts to take me 
    to a moderate level again without spending too much plat. The greyhoppers 
    drop low quality hides frequently and regular hides almost as frequently. My 
    tailor skill went from about 20 to 88ish here over the course my XP'ing.<br>
    <br>
    These critters start to turn light blue at 30 (but I'm currently 31 and have 
    not yet found a green hopper or lightcrawler; some green zelniaks), so XP 
    wise it may not be terribly worth it to you.<br>
    <br>
    The camp area is very wide open though, with hills around the edges (that 
    you should avoid because of the usual pathing and line-of-sight issues). 
    Very minimal danger of adds if you pay attention and rarely will you have 
    people complaining about you.<br>
    <br>
    I tried north of the Neth Lair entrance a lot, but there is too much hilly 
    terrain and too many chances for adds there for my taste. <br>
    <br>
    NOTES:<br>
    ·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For newbie quadkiters the long agro range of zelniaks can be 
    difficult to get used to. (EDIT: a &quot;gigantic lightcrawler&quot; that cannot be 
    rooted and runs faster than blood of the wolf SoW occasionally spawns here, 
    too.) For people like me, returned from a long break and starting over, it 
    shouldn't be too difficult.<br>
    <br>
    ·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are so many mobs and so few people here (on my server, at 
    least) that availability has never been an issue for me.<br>
    <br>
    ·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No coin or &quot;interesting&quot; items in my experience. Various caster 
    research items (runes, pages, and such), pelts, and hides.</span></p>
