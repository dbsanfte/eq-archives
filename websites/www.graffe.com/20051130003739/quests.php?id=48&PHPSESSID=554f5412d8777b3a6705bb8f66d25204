<br>
You say, 'Hail, Holly Longtail'<br>
Holly Longtail says 'Hello, Vashanti.  The preservation of ancestors is a time-honored tradition.  It's a task one must handle with painstaking care and precision.  Please do not fret for the lives of these specimens.  They live in the eternal realm of beauty now.  I have quite a large collection of stuffed animals ready to go, but many of them have sustained injuries in their capture.  In fact, I wouldn't mind some help to collect some [replacement parts] from creatures around the world.'<br>
<br>

You say, 'What replacement parts?'<br>
Holly Longtail says 'Grab a Collector's Box from [Merri] before you go.  You need to recover an Undead Froglok Tongue, Cockatrice Beak, High Quality Cougarskin, and a Tiny Rockhopper Eye.  Seal the box tightly and return it to me.  If the contents are in sufficient and usable condition, I may have a reward for you.'<br>
<br>

<i>Tell Merri you need a Collector's Box (No Drop), receive the Box, combine the 4 requested items in the box, then return it to Holly Longtail.</i><br>
<br>

<i>Undead Froglok Tongues come from Guk, or from Bonecracker in Najena, among other places.</i><br>
<i>High Quality Cougarskins come from the Iceclad Ocean or the Eastern Wastes in Velious.</i><br>
<i>Cockatrice Beaks come from Cockatrices, naturally, in the Dreadlands of Kunark.</i><br>
<i>Tiny Rockhopper Eyes come from hoppers in the "pit" areas, outside of Shar Vahl, in Luclin.</i><br>
<br>
The quest reward is a Finger slot item: <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=28237">Fine Antique Ring</a></td></tr></table></body></html>
