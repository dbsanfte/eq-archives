    Seek the plains, seek the island in tears and seek the dunes for there is

    </font></b></font><font size="2" color="#999999"> <b>Ancient Cyclops</b> - 

    In South Ro and the Ocean of Tears. Green to Level 50- Hits for 110. Ring 

    is AC 6 Int +5 No Drop and goes in wrist slot. </font></p>

  <ul>

    <li><font size="2" color="#999999">If you choose to get him in Ocean of Tears, 

      you can sit in one spot and just kill the placeholders until he spawns. 

      Keep in mind he is approximately 10 levels higher than than the one in South 

      Ro and the camp is horribly boring.</font></li>

    <li><font size="2" color="#999999">If you choose to get him in South Ro, you 

      must keep the complete sand area clean of 'yard trash'. This includes Tarantulas, 

      Mummies, Sand Giants, Zombies, anything that inhabits the sand. You will 

      begin to notice a cycle of spawns after all is clear. Keep that cycle going 

      by killing them off quickly. Soon, the Ancient Cyclops will spawn. I have 

      had him spawn twice in two hours this way. While doing this you will also 

      get Terrorantula and Hassam to spawn as well. Get as many people as you 

      can to join you because he spawns in random spots. (each time I have seen 

      him, he has spawned near the Dervish camp near the west wall)</font></li>

  </ul>

  <p><font size="2" color="#999999"><b>Shadowed Rapier</b> - These can be found 

    off of Shadowmen scattered all through Norrath. Most hunt for the rapier at 

    the camps in Innothule swamp due to it's close location.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font size="2" color="#999999"><b>Hasten Bootstrutter</b> <a href="Hasten.jpg" target="_blank">(picture)</a>: 

    A gnome that wanders Rathe Mountains. Most find him near the Feerrott Zone 

    side. Note that Hasten Bootstrutter wants GOLD not platinum. His spawn point 

    is in the Hill Giant/Cyclops area of the zone close to the guard tower in 

    the Southwest part of Rathe Mountains. If he is not there, look for one of 

    his placeholders and kill it:</font></p>

  <ol>

    <li><font color="#999999" size="2">The most common place holder is called 

      "A DRAKE" not to be confused with the other Drakes there, this is the ONLY 

      one called "A DRAKE" Simply kill him and wait 8 minutes for another spawn 

      </font></li>

    <li><font color="#999999" size="2">Second most common Pop is Maldyn the unkempt 
      druid. He is level 34ish and drops a Ranger Quest item. Again kill him and 
      wait for another pop, one should be kind enough to offer the bow parts "a" 
      that he drops to some ranger for their glove quest of course :) Note that 
      killing Maldyn effects no factions at all. </font></li>

    <li><font color="#999999" size="2">3rd most common is Hasten, Thank goodness</font></li>

    <li><font color="#999999" size="2">The most rare spawn is Brother Zephyl for 
      the Robe of the lost circle (Monk Quest). You can either wait for him to 
      despawn (unknown time) or attempt to kill him. If you attempt to kill him, 
      note that he double hits VERY hard (rumors say somewhere in the 300 range) 
      and is red to a level 54. I suggest waiting for him to despawn *smile*.</font></li>
