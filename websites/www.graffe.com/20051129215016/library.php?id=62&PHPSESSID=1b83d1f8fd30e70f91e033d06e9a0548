    <font color="#FFFFFF"><b>44-51 Jaggedpine Forest (Poachers)</b></font><br>
    Minimum Level: 44<br>
    Maximum Level 51<br>
    Zone Name: Jaggedpine Forest<br>
    Camp Area/LOC: Poachers tents by the river on the far end of the zone.<br>
    Mob List (HP): Poachers, a few named.<br>
    Availability (1-&gt;10): 5 (sometimes people will be there killing them all for 
    the half elf mask)<br>
    Loot Ranking (1-&gt;10): 8 (Average platinum + random drops of low-high 
    bear/wolf/cat pelts, one of the best pelt camps in the game)<br>
    Diff. Ranking: (1-&gt;10): 3 (real easy once you've got pulling down)<br>
    Factions Effected: Pirates of Jaggedpine (-), Citizens of Jaggedpine (+)<br>
    <br>
    Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: Didn't see this in the post, so thought I'd add 
    it.<br>
    <br>
    The easiest way to pull is to invis (none of them see invis) then run inside 
    a tent and get your target, then pull in such a way that you'll agro 3 more 
    of them. They will run through the walls of the tent and right at you. There 
    is also a small tent with only 4 of them, perfect for starting out.<br>
    <br>
    For quadding, no animals wander near the river, so you have a long stretch 
    of area to quad in, with rocks as the only thing in your way. Don't hover 
    OVER the river itself though, or you'll agro the turtles, which I hear are 
    unsnarable/rootable. They shouldn't cause any problems long as you stay on 
    the ground though.<br>
    <br>
    The loots consist of the 4 platinum max. per poacher, tons of pelts ranging 
    in low-high quality (never ruined) and varrying from wolf/bear/cat. Zed 
    (forget last name) also drops the half elf illusion mask as a rare drop, 
    which is no drop. There is also various sap stained/stalker armor pieces, 
    but the stats aren't too great. They sell for 15pp + to merchant though.</font><p>&nbsp;</p>
