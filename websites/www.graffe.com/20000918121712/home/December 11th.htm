          Paw updated with new items:<br>
          Looks like Paw has been updated on most of the servers now. Some mob 
          holds a <b>Gnoll Hide Tome</b> that grants all pure casters some nice 
          stats (Str -10, Int +10, Wis +5, HP +15, Sv Poison +10). All I need 
          now is a pic. I'm stuck at work so if anyone wishes to go get the pic 
          and <a href="mailto:graffe@graffe.com?subject=Gnoll%20Hide%20Tome%20Submit">send</a> 
          it in, I think all of the viewers would appreciated it! Zenolan Shadowblaze 
          has already sent in a pic of one item. Even though we cannot use it.. 
          I thought you might wish to see what kind of items are being dropped. 
          This whip was found on one of the doggies outside of the tunnel entrance.</p>

          <img src="purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="9">Someone has put together 
          a Wizard Sit-In on the Mithaniel Marr Server. Read on for more info:<i><br>
          &quot;To make a greater statement and to emphasize the completion of 
          the petition regarding the spell effectiveness cap there will be a sit-in 
          this <b>Saturday (December, 11 1999) from 7-10PM PST on the Mithaniel 
          Marr</b>. All wizards and people who support this petition and wizards 
          in general are invited to<b> create a Human (the face with the eye-patch) 
          in Freeport and attend the sit-in at West Freeport Gate</b>. We will 
          talk about exactly what it is that has upset us so much as well as the 
          petition and other issues. The leaders of this sit-in will be very apparent 
          and I will personally be there as the first of us comes to the gates. 
          I ask that because there is the possibility of there being so many of 
          us that everyone speaks as little as possible and that those attending 
          keep the OOC, auction, and shout channels clutter free as much as possible. 
          There will be times when the leader may ask you to voice your opinions 
          or for specific persons to relate something that happened to them regarding 
          the cap or other problems. Please follow our instructions. I may ask 
          that we all cast our shield spell a time or two so have it memorized. 
          Things may get a bit choppy so hang in there. I hope this will be a 
          good demonstration of our resolve. We like our Wizards. We just don't 
          want to useless to a group, or accepted in out of pity which seems to 
          be more and more the case. Following are some of the complaints voiced 
          by a majority of wizards.</i></p>
        <p><i>1. Change the level modifier/resistance cap from 1.2 to 1.5 or remove 
          it all together (this would assist ALL spell casting classes).</i></p>
        <p><i>2. We should not have to depend completely on having an enchanter 
          in the party every time we group in order for our spells to land on 
          things. Possibly wizards should have some way of lowering resistance, 
          whether that be a VIABLE item or a line of spells. Ultimately enchanters 
          are the best at this and therefore because the Wizard studies destructive 
          forces and travel so single-mindedly they should not be quite as effective. 
          Perhaps a slight reduction of the curve by which things higher than 
          us are more resistant regardless of their resistance scores is in order. 
          Or, perhaps better personal protection spells.</i></p>
        <p><i>3. Lastly remove the lower level nerf. You all know that low monsters 
          resist is meant to prevent kill stealing. Verant has treated this concern 
          with the group damage patch and as such it has out stayed its viability. 
          </i></p>
        <p><i>PS. As a side note many would also like to see three verities of 
          DD every level analogous to mage elemental pets. This again though is 
          wishful thinking, I must say if we are to push for this or any other 
          auspices it must come after we address our initial concerns.</i></p>
        <p><i>Remember, these are merely points that will be brought up for discussion 
          at the sit-in. The main point of this rally is to put a little force 
          behind the petition. The other items are important as well. We want 
          Verant to notice.</i></p>
        <p><i>Thank you <br>
          See you there. <br>

          Crossing Rod:<br>
          <i>&quot;Well with all the new quests, the Eruds Rod just got easier. 
          I was on the island with my level 15 druid and on 3 separate occasions 
          now there have beer groups of level 50's killing the sharks. I noticed 
          that none on them were wizards, so I know they were not looking for 
          the rod. So when I asked what they where on the island for, they responded 
          that they were getting paladin quest items and they were clearing all 
          the sharks waiting for a diseased shark to spawn. They said the diseased 
          1 was rare, although I've seen it a few times when checking the area 
          out. I asked if they minded if i want in and got it, of course they 
          didn't mind, the rod is of no use to them. so I ported in the wizard 
          and got the rod, no sharks anywhere. I'm guessing that this is going 
          to be a trend no that I?ve seen this (full groups of 48-50) happen 3 
          times over the weekend. Just some info that I thought might be useful. 
          well I have the 1st rod, next guk, than I'll get the easy ones. I wanted 
          to add that I don't have first hand knowledge of the paladin quest, 
          I'm just assuming that they wouldn't have told me that it was a quest 
          if it wasn't. I think they would have just said were here killing sharks 
          for the hell of it.<br>

          the 'bigger mob' resists:<br>
          <i>&quot;I've been catching up on my eq websites of late and I've been 
          surprised to read that people feel nagafen has been upgraded. About 
          three hours after the servers went up, post patch inner circle, cunnans 
          brewing company and a few others took down nagafen. We had more people 
          then I have done him with before, and as such it was the most sucessfull 
          raid I've seed. All and all I would say we had six groups, so 36 people, 
          and from start to finish the fight lasted about six minutes. We did 
          it in one wave this time, so because of that we didn't see if his regen 
          got upgraded or not. If it did I for one think this is a great thing. 
          This prevents people from using the cheese tactic of fighting, till 
          most die, then rezing, buffing and fighting again. As for resists I 
          will have to talk to a few people because my wizard was parked in the 
          garage (where he will forever stay) and I had my enchanter. His casting 
          basically amounted to pilage enchantment, tishania, then assisting nagafen 
          and casting rune IV on whomever he was beating on at the time. Well 
          just wanted to say that he has been killed post patch. <br>

          A full report and pictures of last night's Cleric Sit In, can be found 
          on the Bilge Hunter.<br>

          <br>
          And while not the success many of us hoped for, it was a good event 
          to show Verant that we clerics are a bit upset. Arturum<br>
          Thanks Arturum!</p>

          of Xegony sent in this info:<br>
          <i>&quot;Similarily to the Nagafen incident, it seems that some High-Level 
          mobs randomly completely resist magic. My similar experience was in 
          a Fire Giant hunt in Solusek B, one of the guards at the first archway, 
          even from melee range, completely resisted all magic from me and my 
          group. This was in all types I could cast, including Rend, Markar's 
          Clash, Tishan's Clash, Conflaguration, and of course, Ice Comet. Even 
          tried a Supernova to see if AoEs would have any shot. However my spells 
          worked fine later on other mobs (well, some completely worked, some 
          only the stuns worked... stuns seem to have a better shot of working). 
          I should also add that this was before the last patch.&quot;<br>
          </i>Thanks Endy!</p>

          <i>&quot;Safespot in East Commonlands right outside West Commonlands 
          zone has been moved from the center of East Commonlands right next to 
          Freeport Zone to the Center of East Commonlands next to West Commonlands

          incident but none the less, I'd rather you all have warning concerning 
          entering Nagafen's Lair (Solusek B):<br>
          <i>&quot;Added a LDC </i>(Lava Duct Crawler) <i>and two sonic bats that 
          patrol near the zone entrance. Sonic bats are near the "king room, and 
          Circle room". The LDC is said to spawn in the pool room, and can be 
          seen much of the time running up and down the zone corridor. Makes for 
          a more cautious zone in! Oriz Stormweaver Quellious Server&quot;</i><br>
          Thanks Oriz!</p>
        <p><img src="purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="9">Concerning Nagafen:<br>
          <i>&quot;They did alot more then just upgrade his regeneration, im a 
          level 50 Necromancer on Brell Serilis and Thursday night 37 of us attempted 
          to kill him, however unsuccesful. Basically all of our lvl 49 drains 
          were resisted, and yes an enchanter cast tashani on him. About 30-40 
          Drain souls (lvl 49 Necro lifetap) were cast and all of them were resisted 
          fully. Yes we were in melee range. Also all the druids got resisted 
          (and we had about 6 druids) f ully of id say 60 spells. I think buffing 
          him was totally uncalled for, and please at least put it in the patch 
          message, alot of people died for nothing and it turned into corpse retreaval. 
          When we first attempted to kill Nagafen i was lvl 44 and did not get 
          resisted a single time, now im lvl 50 and im useless against him!&quot;</i><br>
          Thanks! (no character name given)</p>
        <p><img src="purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="9">Out of about 80 e-mails 
          stating that change in the guards ability to hit harder and resist more, 
          I have just received two e-mail's conflicting the report and saying 
          there has been no change. If you have any doubts, I suggest bringing 
          a friend along to tackle one before you try to solo, just in case they 
          are tougher. All I can say is be safe and you be the judge.</p>

          Time to time I get an e-mail from a viewer upset about the things that 
          get posted (namecalling, bickering, profanity). When people send in 
          e-mail such as this, it really hits home. I don't want to have to play 
          police or tell any of you what you can or can't say. But if everyone 
          could keep the boards clean of these types of messages, It would mean 
          a lot to me and everyone out there that reads them. If you do want to 
          critisize someone's post, feel free to... but do it in a manner that 
          you would wish to be critisized in. Try to help me keep this place clean 
          for all of you and make us Wizards known for what should be known for..... 
          our intelligence. Thank you!</p>

          in concerning talking to Sulgar for the Ice Comet Quest:<br>
          <i>&quot;I got all 10 rods for the Ice Comet quest and went to Sulgar 
          and he would not give me the Wheel Case or tome. I petitioned as per 
          the instructions on the Quest page. Well I waited 2 hours Monday night 
          and no GM. Started Tues. morning and No GM on Veeshan between 7 and 
          9 am. Checked back at Noon and after 2 hours was told a GM would be 
          on in 3 hours. Came back at 5 and was told NO GM's are on Veeshan on 
          Monday and Tues. Well I sat there for 2 or 3 hours as 1 Guide told me 
          for sure a GM would be on.... Needless to say I was getting very board. 
          I looked into my inventory and saw I had 29 copper. I hailed the 2 barbarians 
          and got a nod from one of them and a Humm form another. I gave the one 
          that did the Humm 9 pieces of copper and then gave the other 5 pieces 
          of copper and gave Sulgar 5 pieces of copper all three said "Thank You". 
          So I asked Sulgar once again about the Wheel Case and he gave it to 
          me. Hope this will help some other people that need there Beta Neutral 
          re-set per the info on your quest page. Seems a little Bribe does not 
          hurt... lol - and sure saves time waiting on GM's. Outerlimit Tyme -
