  <p align="center">This quest starts by talking to Lord Yelinak within 
  Skyshrine.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>You say</b>, 'Hail, Lord Yelinak'<br>
    <b>Lord Yelinak says</b> 'Welcome young mortal, word of your deeds has 
    preceded your arrival. Your intentions seem honorable, young one, however my 
    trust is not an easy thing to win these days. Like you, there has been 
    another that came before me with the trust of the dragon kin, and trust them 
    too I did, but alas that proved to be destructive. I note your deeds to this 
    shrine young one, but should you wish my counsel, you must prove your worth 
    beyond doubt. Perhaps a small challenge shall be of interest to you?</p>
  </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p><b>You say</b>, 'I wish to prove myself worth'<br>
        <b>Lord Yelinak says</b> 'Then as agreed, young mortal, I will grant you 
        one <br>
        chance to prove your worth in my eyes. The Storm King Tormax sits on a
        <br>
        throne carved from the skull of one of our fallen within the city of 
        Kael, <br>
        which disgraces the mighty children of Veeshan. His life alone is a 
        blight <br>
        upon the children of Veeshan. Should you be a true patriot to our cause, 
        I seek of you but one task. Should you succeed in this task, not only 
        will <br>
        your actions offset the balance of this war in our favor, but will 
        surely <br>
        take a step in driving the vileness of the giants from our noble lands. 
        Bring me, young one, the head of Tormax, and then we shall speak 
        further.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">Speaking to Lord Yelinak, you learn that he wants you to 
  return the head of King Tormax (L70 Giant WAR) from Kael Drakkal to him. Once 
  you have obtained the head of Tormax, take it back to Yelinak and trade it to 
  him.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Lord Yelinak watches as you drop the colossal head of King Tormax to the 
    ground before him. You sense intense hatred within Yelinak as he stares down 
    at the bloody remains of a descendent of the one who slew his mate. 
    Obviously the death of Tormax has done little to console the ancient snow 
    dragon. Finally Yelinak speaks, 'I look upon this face, and even though he 
    is dead, the hatred burns on. My grief and anger are unchanged even in the 
    face of ultimate fate. His grandfather's act was so despicable and 
    all-encompassing that it instilled an. . . immortal loathing. Neverttheless, 
    you have completed the task I set before you and, as such, you deserve my 
    gratitude. Please accept this [treasure]. </p>
    <p>Your faction standing with Yelinak could not possibly get any better.<br>
    Your faction standing with ClawsofVeeshan could not possibly get any better.<br>
    Your faction standing with KingTormax got worse.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In return for the head, Lord Yelinak gives you a
  <a href="javascript:;" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('clawed_griffin_sword.gif','clawedgriffonsword','width=330,height=145')">
  Clawed Griffin Sword</a>. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>You say</b>, 'What treasure?'<br>
    <b>Lord Yelinak says</b> 'This sword is a symbol of our evolution and 
    ancient <br>
    heritage. Back when our feathered relatives were not so distant, a sword was 
    forged and enchanted with the spirit of an elder griffin. This noble griffin 
    bound his soul to the sword, the essence of his being honing the blade to an 
    edge imperceptible to mortal eyes. Although our races have evolved away from 
    each other, we still hold them in high regard. But if you think you are not 
    worthy to wield this honor, return the sword to me and I have other tokens 
    you may find of more use.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now hand back the Clawed Griffin Sword to Lord Yelinak. In trade he will 
  give you a very nice pair of boots -</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Lord Yelinak says 'I lost the scales that made these boots in a battle 
    with Tormax's minions. The casters of the shrine gathered these fallen 
    scales up and fashioned a very powerful enchantment into these boots.</p>
