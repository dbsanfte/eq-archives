(Translated from the original Gnomish, Edition 1.00)

<br><br><I>Greetings again, learned wizards. To my surprise, I recently discovered there was no single write-up about wizardly familiars. As an adjunct to my humble <a href=" http://www.arcanist.com/modules.php?name=Reviews&rop=showcontent&id=11"> Handbook for Young Wizards</a>, this simple fact sheet lists out the details on what the various familiars offer to their wizard masters.

<br><br>Before I get into the fact sheet, let me reiterate something from the aforementioned Handbook: Practice your Conjuration! The ability to call up a familiar without wasting all of your mana (perhaps more than once) is not something to take for granted. Yes, it's somewhat difficult and frustrating to raise the ability, given our limited spells in that field, but that does not make it acceptable to not do so. You will want to be able to summon your later familiars reliably. Practice early and often to make that happen.

<br><br>For wizards who do not wish the companionship of their familiars, after summoning them, invoking the magical phrase "/pet get lost" will cause them to vanish, but to silently provide all the same benefits as they would if they were visible.

<br><br>Thank you for your kind attention and please contact me, in care of Ak'Anon's Library Mechanamagica, if you have any additions or corrections for me to make to this listing. You can normally hear my familiar flapping behind the secret door leading to my office there.

<br><br>Yours in Gnome Power,<br>

<br><br><b>IMPS OF SOLUSEK RO</b>

<I><br><br>The first familiars a wizard is able to summon are red imps summoned from the Temple of Solusek Ro, the <a href="http://www.arcanist.com/modules.php?name=Reviews&rop=showcontent&id=10">so-called god of wizardry</a>, high in the Lavastorm Mountains. These imps, known as the minor and lesser familiars, provide an aura of protection to their masters, assist them in casting spells (causing their masters to fizzle less often), and the lesser familiar also is able to see invisible creatures and helps their master regenerate mana faster.</I>

<br><br><b>Minor Familiar</b>
<li>Level 29 (Conjuration)
<li>Mana 290
<li>Casting Time: 12 seconds
<li>Increases all resistances by 10
<li>Increases effective casting level by 2

<br><br><b>Lesser Familiar</b>
<li>Level 49 (Conjuration)
<li>Mana 490
<li>Casting Time: 14 seconds
<li>Increases all resistances by 15
<li>Increases effective casting level by 2
<li>Grants See Invisibility
<li>Increases mana regeneration by 1

<I><br><br>Both spells are sold by Goesel Soisonich of House Midst in the city of Shadow Haven.</I>

<br><br><b>EBON DRAKELINGS OF THE STEAMFONT MOUNTAINS</b>

<I><br><br>It is a matter for theologians, or perhaps dracologists, to argue why the more potent familiars all come from the magical land of Faydwer. Is it the touch of Brell and Tunare upon the soil? Or is it instead a lingering influence of Veeshan herself? Whatever the case, channelers and sorcerers leave behind imps in favor of summoning ebon drakelings from my homeland, the Steamfont Mountains. These drakes provide benefits similar to the ones provided by the lesser familiars, but the familiars and greater familiars also provide their own mana pool for their master to draw upon.</I>

<br><br><b>Familiar</b>
<li>Level 54 (Conjuration)
<li>Mana 525
<li>Casting Time: 14 seconds
<li>Increases all resistances by 20
<li>Increases effective casting level by 4
<li>Grants See Invisibility
<li>Increases mana regeneration by 2
<li>Adds 75 to mana pool

<br><br><b>Greater Familiar</b>
<li>Level 60 (Conjuration)
<li>Mana 650
<li>Casting Time: 16 seconds
<li>Increases all resistances by 25
<li>Increases effective casting level by 8
<li>Grants See Invisibility
<li>Increases mana regeneration by 4
<li>Adds 150 to mana pool

<I><br><br>Both of these spells can be found amidst the treasure of creatures found on the world of Luclin. In addition, Greater Familiar can be researched using a sorcerer's lexicon (obtained in the Gulf of Gunthak), a quill, parchment and runes of amalgamation, association and conjuration.</I>

<br><br><b>FOREST DRAKELINGS OF THE FAYDARK</b>

<I><br><br>The final and most powerful familiars are summoned by evokers, sorcerers and arcanists from the Faydark forest, north and west of the Steamfont Mountains. These drakes, the so-called improved and allegiant familiars, provide unmatched benefits for their masters.

<br><br>Unlike previous familiars, these are not summoned with spells, but rather with "alternate advancement" abilities. The investment in them is nothing to sneeze at -- 9 points for the improved familiar and 6 more for the allegiant -- but the benefits are well worth it. (Summoning these familiars still improves Conjuration skill, incidentally, although there is no chance for failure otherwise.)

<br><br>Note that the improved familiar ability once merely provided additional protection for summoned familiars. This is no longer the case, although some scholars have been slow to update their information in this regard.</I>

<br><br><b>Improved Familiar</b>
<li>Level 59 (Alternate Advancement Class ability: 9 points)
<li>Casting Time: 16 seconds
<li>Increases all resistances by 25
<li>Increases effective casting level by 9
<li>Grants See Invisibility
<li>Increases mana regeneration by 6
<li>Adds 200 to mana pool

<br><br><b>Allegiant Familiar</b>
<li>Level 64 (Alternate Advancement Planes of Power ability: 6 points)
<li>Casting Time: 16 seconds
<li>Increases all resistances by 30
<li>Increases effective casting level by 9
<li>Grants See Invisibility
<li>Increases mana regeneration by 8
<li>Adds 300 to mana pool

<br><br><b>FIRETREE'S FAMILIAR ENCHANTMENTS</b>

<I><br><br>The Combine Loyalist wizard Lathin Firetree has created two spells to enhance familiars. Both of these are of dubious benefit, as familiars are able to resist most forms of damage, but I include this mention of them for the sake of completeness.</I>

<br><br><b>Firetree's Familiar Augment</b>
<li>Level 52 (Alteration)
<li>Mana 250
<li>Casting Time: 5 seconds
<li>Duration: 30 minutes
<li>Increases familiar hit points by 100
<li>Increases familiar movement speed by 35 percent
<li>Increases familiar armor class by 7

<br><br><b>Firetree's Familiar Enhancement </b>
<li>Level 60 (Alteration)
<li>Mana 300
<li>Casting Time: 5 seconds
<li>Duration: 1 hour
<li>Increases familiar hit points by 200
<li>Increases familiar movement speed by 55 percent
<li>Increases familiar armor class by 15

<I><br><br>Both of these spells can be found amidst the treasure of creatures found on the world of Luclin. In addition, Firetree's Familiar Enhancement can be researched using a sorcerer's lexicon (obtained in the Gulf of Gunthak), a quill, parchment and runes of cascade, complexity and conglomeration.</I></tr></td></table></body></html>
