<br />
**********************************************<br />
Greetings <br />
<br />
This is GM Crayson, thank you for emailing us. Actually we use the same<br />
contact that players use for the Dev Department. If I would forward your<br />
email the only one I have would be <a href="mailto:eqmail@soe.sony.com.For">eqmail@soe.sony.com.For</a> the most part<br />
Dev. does not respond to email that are redirect to them it however does not<br />
mean that they don't read them I know for a fact that they do and or none of<br />
the changes in everquest would have been done. Unfortunately they cannot<br />
change something ingame with only one or a few wanting the change, they<br />
would need a good portion of the fan base wanting the change then consider<br />
what the change will do to other aspects of the game. Your going about it<br />
the write way by using the contacts at the forums and the emails and how<br />
knows if enough of the players want the change maybe it will happend. If you<br />
have further questions or comments please email me at <a href="mailto:jtyler@soe.sony.com">jtyler@soe.sony.com</a>.<br />
<br />
Thank you for playing quest<br />

Well, Figured i would ask you since you probably have more <br />
access to the Dev team gonna post this in Dev section as well but they <br />
don't seem to care about feebback from Valued Customers.<br />
<br />
I was Wondering if the Spells Elnick's Electral Rending and Garrison's <br />
Superior Sundering would ever be change to drop off the normal lvl 60 <br />
spell table in Luclin instead of dropping on the Loot table of just 2 <br />
mobs.<br />
<br />
EER drops from Thought Horroe Overfiend in the Deep and GSS Drops from <br />
Emporer Ssra.<br />
<br />
Now that Planes of Power is out Wizard's are finding ourselves out of <br />
balance slightly to other classes.<br />
<br />
To correct this the best solution would be to change these 2 spells to <br />
drop off the normal SoL Loot Table.<br />
<br />
Please respond Thanks appreicate your time and effort in this matter<br />
**********************************************<br />
<br />
Please send a post similiar to this on the Dev board lets send a flood of posts to get these drops changed.<br />

		<div><br /> EER is now on the loot tables of several Luclin ubers, i got my copy off the burrower parasite.  Normally, the mods here don't allow &quot;petitioning&quot; per se, as it makes the community appear whiny and invites cross posting and flames.  If you agree that GSS and EER should be more common, send a comment to the dev corner like the original poster did.  I personally think EER should drop off the same Luclin yard trash that drops moonfire, and should be on spell table, not loot table.  GSS should be on the spell table of all Luclin ubers, i.e. the mobs that are dropping EER now.  And sunstrike should have a quest to obtain, about the same difficulty as protection of the cabbage (although research based instead of other tradeskill based) as well as being obtainable through drops. <br /></div>

Well guess what, what percentages are even wizards (meaning who would care).. Knock off people that are too low level to even consider it matters, knock off the casual non-raider, who wouldn't be in a position to get it even post-changes.. Knock off people that don't read graffe, or EQ messageboards in general for that matter.. And finally, of whats left, who will see the thread, take time to read it about so many others, and then decide &quot;ok, this is good&quot;, and take time to write out their agreement.<br />
<br />
Yeah, ok, this sounds a little pessimistic.. But even if every wizard that ever existed said something.. well 10% or whatever we are, sure isn't a majority of players <br /></div>

I did not encounter a lot of broken content in Luclin.  I thought it was an excellent expansion.<br />
<br />
Wizards should not have to level to 63+ to be balanced.  AT is nice, but in order to use it you have to abandon most pre-PoP content.  For those in smaller guilds that have varied leveled members, this can cause grouping issues.  <br />
<br />
If 63+ spells are so superior to the level 60 Luclin nukes, why is there any opposition at all to making GSS and EER more available?  There appears to be a very vocal minority that make it a point to squash any debate on this point.  Most think that making these spells more available would help with balance in the low 60s:<br />

<br />
over all, Luclin offered the most to the wizard class, horses, familiars, mobs that never freaking heard of any sort of spell resistance, focus items, FT coming out of the woodwork.<br />
<br />
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quote:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr&gt;I did not encounter a lot of broken content in Luclin. I thought it was an excellent expansion.[/quote]<br />
<br />
ring of valor tells you, 'go screw yourself~'<br />
<br />
there is a ton of shit that is broken, a lot more that was broken at release, entire endgame areas that were so broken that VI gave up on ever hoping to fix them, and even a few things that were sorta broken, got fixed and are in a worse state than they were before.<br />
<br />
wizards don't have to level to 63+ to feel balanced, they need to take a reasonable look at what other classes have before claiming they are not.<br />
<br />
and the second poll was made long after 90% of the board stopped giving a shit about FoT and avoided anything that even resembled a thread about it.  &lt;img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=&quot;:\&quot;&gt;  <br /></div>
