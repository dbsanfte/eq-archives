        in their Journeyman Boot tales and the way it seems for many is: If you 

        are gaining experience when you kill Drelzna, you will receive the boots. 

        If you do not get experience when you kill her, you will get the note. 

        Now, if there anybody level 40 or above that has camped the boots after 

        Tuesday's patch that has received the boots directly from Drelzna, please 

        let me know. Thanks!</p>

        but I have learned from my original source that it is <u>not</u> found

        is a quest item, I would venture to say that it has to be the mother of 

        all quests. So... start running throughout Norrath spamming &quot;Hail!&quot;. 

        Oh.. don't bother the GM's and Guides on this one either, they are just

        the patch to let us move our spells around within our spellbook. To do 

        this, right-click quickly upon the spell you wish to move. It will highlight 

        and prompt you to right-click within the square you wish to move it to. 

        There is no scribing that takes place.. it just simply moves it. Very 

        nice. Also, we now get casting time info when you right-click hold on 

        a spell. Yippee!<br>

        <img src="purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="9">A while back I posted 

        news concerning a robe that had some literally unbelievable statistics 

        (I even got flamed for posting it). It seems this thorn in my side has 

        rubbed me again. It seems somebody actually has a picture of it's stats. 

        Now before you start writing me e-mail saying this is a fraud, I will 

        tell you that I have gone over the picture very closely and it seems to 

        be original. I'm not saying it is... someone could just be a very good 

        graphic editor (take note that the icon was in the lower right side when 

        I got it and I moved it to the upper right). Being that the stats on this 

        robe are phenomenal, I wish not to put it upon the armor page until I 

        receive an original bitmap. This is supposedly found within the Plane 

        of Fear and this is all I know about it. Have fun drooling on your keyboard 

        and thanks to Itzokae Blastenburn for sending in the pic (so he doesn't 

        get pestered, Itzokae does not have this robe in his posession either)</p>

      <p><img src="purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="9">A viewer took the time 

        to write to Geoffrey Z and send in his e-mail to me so all can view. This 

        is concerning the situation of our root line of spells not holding like 

        they used to:</p>

      <p>&quot;<font color="#FFFFFF">Darren</font> - This is the only time I have 

        ever written to you and appreciate the time you take to read the emails. 

        I will start by saying that I am a wizard...please do trash this yet. 

        I have really enjoyed EQ since opening day. I am not a big game type person 

        but this really appeals to me and also as an Internet worker, I truly 

        realize the huge accomplishment EQ is. Now on to the question.</p>

      <p>I have played a wizard as my only character. I am merely level 30. In 

        the last two weeks I have all but given up. Last night I was in lower 

        guk trying to solo crocs because none of my friends were on or wanted 

        to go that deep in guk. These crocs are blue to me. They have no innate 

        magical ability. I played for 3 hours and killed 2. I gated out to save 

        myself 7 times and died once and used 15 leatherskins. Why, you may ask? 

        I kept track of my root resists by scrolling through the combat text. 

        Root was resisted an average of 60%. Forget about enstill, it is even 

        worse. The worst part is that even if root did stick, 75% of the time 

        they would break it before I even cast one spell or I would get one spell 

        off. Thank god my agility is over 100 so I could cast leatherskin or gate 

        through the misses. This resist rate seems incredibly high. </p>

      <p>In actuality I realize why root and enstill have been toned down. You 

        write code for all the servers on a widespread basis. You have been focused 

        on the race war server and PVP. There are actually many classes that have 

        root. Root is extremely unbalancing in a pvp situation and the fighters 

        were screaming. They would get rooted and killed and never even had a 

        chance to hit. Verant toned down root to balance PVP play not realizing 

        that 95% of the players are not PVP. It did not really affect too many 

        classes too much (how often does a cleric use it? or a druid?) Most used 

        it to stop runners so no big deal. Wizards got left in the cold because 

        we have no other line of defense except root. This kind of falls into 

        the same category as the resist cap because it affects everyone but only 

        the wizards are killed by the change because of their lack of versatility. 

        I understand that you do not want to add any more versatility to the class 

        because they would be stepping on other classes toes and most wizards 

        I know are happy with their role as the damage dealer. But please, please 

        change the resist rates back to normal. Is there any possibility of this? 

      </p>

      <p> Wizards and warriors are the mirror image of each other. They are supposed 

        to be the master of their realm, either melee damage or casting damage, 

        and it makes them one dimensional by nature. I understood this and accepted 

        it. It is that one dimensional nature that makes things that might not 

        affect all the other classes much, affect a massive change to these classes 

        (like the root resists). These are just some thoughts.&quot;</p>

      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Geoffrey Z</font> - &quot;I wish I had time for 

        a long answer. The short version is that we had to balance Root type spells 

        verses both Solo AND Group play. While they may seem a bit underpowered 

        for Solo, they do very well (perhaps too well) in group environments. 

        We had to balance it somewhere between the two.</p>

      <p>Hope that helps. :) <br>

        <img src="purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="9">Looks like there is a 

        few out there confused on what Research Practice is. Research practice 

        is something that Verant implemented to help us gain experience in Research 

        without spending hard earned points or wasting VERY hard to find runes. 

        There are two ways to go about this and it depends if you are of a good 

        background or evil background. To practice, you will need the Concordance 

        of Research Tome (which is a combining book much like the Lexicon) and 

        the recipe book which is called 'Runes and Research Book 2'. You learn 

        the recipes from the book Runes and Research Book 2, put the recipe items 

        within the Concordance of Research (you also need a quill and parchment 

        for each combination), and hit combine. Do it correctly and you should 

        have some practice runes. To learn how to get the Concordance of Research 

        and Runes of Research Books 1 and 2, goto the <a href="../quests/quests.htm">Quests</a> 

        page. There you need to pick if you are <a href="../quests/GoodResearch/GoodResearch.htm">Good</a> 

        or <a href="../quests/EvilResearch/EvilResearch.htm">Evil</a> and do the 

        quest accordingly.</p>

        <img src="purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="9">Reading the message boards 

        scattered around I hear of people losing items when dropping them. All 

        I can say is.. don't drop items. If you don't have the room in your inventory 

        before you accept a trade, cancel the trade and make room. Delete items 

        of less importance if you have to. I would venture to say that half of 

        the people that lose items when dropped are victims of nearby thieves... 

        hence the reason you won't get reimbursed for your items.</p>

      <p><img src="purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="9">Now for a bit more roleplay 

        info upon Xegony... it seems my foul barbarian slave has heard of our 

        plot to have his head brought back to us. My spies have intercepted and 

        slain a messenger last night and found this letter upon the corpse:</p>

      <p>&quot;Good citizens of Xegony - I need your help!</p>

      <p>For many years I have slaved away to the every whims of the foul souls 

        known as Darkmoon, an evil group of dark elves that have terrorized the 

        honest citizens of Norrath. I have done this against my will only to keep 

        my children alive while they sit among filth, imprisoned in the dark elf 

        city of Neriak. The High Lord Graffe of Darkmoon is holding my children 

        captive just inside the walls of the city but try as I might; I have not 

        been able to free them. The last resort to free my children was to raid 

        the Darkmoon treasury and steal one of their most prized artifacts, a 

        staff of some power, and hold it for exchange in the release of my young 

        ones.</p>

      <p> A note from my son Jallaan was smuggled out of Neriak and has reached 

        my hands; alas my hopes to free them have been dashed. It appears that 

        the evil races are gathering soon to hunt me down and kill me. I wish 

        not to have my head used as some heathen's doorstop, so I have gone into 

        hiding with no hope of getting my children back. </p>

      <p> I call out now to my friends and good citizens of Norrath to aid me 

        in my time of need. My children sit now just inside the gates of the dark 

        elf city waiting to be released from captivity. If any of Norrath's good 

        people were to gather together and free Jallaan and Gwena from captivity, 

        I would be able to come out of hiding and leave my terms of slavery. In 

        turn for this great deed, I'm willing to turn over all the artifacts that 

        I have pilfered from the Darkmoon treasury to those who rescue my young 

        ones and deliver them back to Halas safe. </p>

      <p> I have seen the guards of Neriak and know this will be no easy task 

        to accomplish. The first group that is able to enter the city and deliver 

        the two children back to Halas will have all the hoarded treasure in my 

        bank within Halas.</p>

      <p>Please aid me in my time of need, you will not regret the help you lend 

        me. All those interested in freeing my children should meet at the entrance 

        to Nektulos on the East Commonland side, <b>Sunday, September 19th at 

        9 am PST (12 noon EST)</b>. </p>

      <p>Thank you my friends,<br>

        Leber of the Xegony Frozen North</p>

      <p>(ooc - This quest is open for "light" races only. The two barbarians 

        will be waiting just inside the Neriak Foreign Quarter zone and will group 

        with the first adventurers that zone through. The group will need to make 

        their way out of Nektulos before any spell or song can be used upon the 

        two barbarian captives (example: invisibility, teleport, cloud…), but 

        the two barbarians will aid in the escape anyway they can (including SoW 

        if needed). In the event that one of the barbies dies along the way, they 

        will need to be escorted back to their body from Freeport zone. Once the 

        group reaches Halas, Jallaan will retrieve a pack from the bank and turn 

        it over to the leader of the group. The pack will include many magic items 

        and a rare, high quality bear hide, total value is close to 1000 plat.)&quot;</p>

      <p> - 7:50am PST<br>

        Had an enchanter send me a bit of news that some high level Wizards might 

        enjoy if they did not know already:<br>

        &quot; Gravity Flux is also a level 39 (yes, Thirty-Nine) Enchanter spell. 

        Ask an Enchanter to make it for you. Be forewarned though, the scroll 

        will say that it is Enchanter Only, BUT it can be scribed by a wizard. 

        I have personally made the scroll Gravity Flux and given it to a level 

        50 Wizard. He succesfully scribed the spell. &quot;</p>

      <p>Thanks Laszarus! </p>

        Armor news: Players can now create Raw Silk Armor. The instruction book 

        cannot be bought off of a vendor (unless a player sold one to a vendor). 

        The instruction book is found on random mobs. A viewer sent in stat pics 

        to most of the Raw Silk Armor, and it has been posted accordingly.</p>
