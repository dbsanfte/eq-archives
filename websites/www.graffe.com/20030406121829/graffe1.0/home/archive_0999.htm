        news concerning a robe that had some literally unbelievable statistics 
        (I even got flamed for posting it). It seems this thorn in my side has 
        rubbed me again. It seems somebody actually has a picture of it's stats. 
        Now before you start writing me e-mail saying this is a fraud, I will 
        tell you that I have gone over the picture very closely and it seems to 
        be original. I'm not saying it is... someone could just be a very good 
        graphic editor (take note that the icon was in the lower right side when 
        I got it and I moved it to the upper right). Being that the stats on this 
        robe are phenomenal, I wish not to put it upon the armor page until I 
        receive an original bitmap. This is supposedly found within the Plane 
        of Fear and this is all I know about it. Have fun drooling on your keyboard

      <p><img src="purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="9">A viewer took the time 
        to write to Geoffrey Z and send in his e-mail to me so all can view. This 
        is concerning the situation of our root line of spells not holding like 
        they used to:</p>
      <p>&quot;<font color="#FFFFFF">Darren</font> - This is the only time I have 
        ever written to you and appreciate the time you take to read the emails. 
        I will start by saying that I am a wizard...please do trash this yet. 
        I have really enjoyed EQ since opening day. I am not a big game type person 
        but this really appeals to me and also as an Internet worker, I truly 
        realize the huge accomplishment EQ is. Now on to the question.</p>
      <p>I have played a wizard as my only character. I am merely level 30. In 
        the last two weeks I have all but given up. Last night I was in lower 
        guk trying to solo crocs because none of my friends were on or wanted 
        to go that deep in guk. These crocs are blue to me. They have no innate 
        magical ability. I played for 3 hours and killed 2. I gated out to save 
        myself 7 times and died once and used 15 leatherskins. Why, you may ask? 
        I kept track of my root resists by scrolling through the combat text. 
        Root was resisted an average of 60%. Forget about enstill, it is even 
        worse. The worst part is that even if root did stick, 75% of the time 
        they would break it before I even cast one spell or I would get one spell 
        off. Thank god my agility is over 100 so I could cast leatherskin or gate 
        through the misses. This resist rate seems incredibly high. </p>
      <p>In actuality I realize why root and enstill have been toned down. You 
        write code for all the servers on a widespread basis. You have been focused 
        on the race war server and PVP. There are actually many classes that have 
        root. Root is extremely unbalancing in a pvp situation and the fighters 
        were screaming. They would get rooted and killed and never even had a 
        chance to hit. Verant toned down root to balance PVP play not realizing 
        that 95% of the players are not PVP. It did not really affect too many 
        classes too much (how often does a cleric use it? or a druid?) Most used 
        it to stop runners so no big deal. Wizards got left in the cold because 
        we have no other line of defense except root. This kind of falls into 
        the same category as the resist cap because it affects everyone but only 
        the wizards are killed by the change because of their lack of versatility. 
        I understand that you do not want to add any more versatility to the class 
        because they would be stepping on other classes toes and most wizards 
        I know are happy with their role as the damage dealer. But please, please 
        change the resist rates back to normal. Is there any possibility of this? 
      </p>
      <p> Wizards and warriors are the mirror image of each other. They are supposed 
        to be the master of their realm, either melee damage or casting damage, 
        and it makes them one dimensional by nature. I understood this and accepted 
        it. It is that one dimensional nature that makes things that might not 
        affect all the other classes much, affect a massive change to these classes 
        (like the root resists). These are just some thoughts.&quot;</p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Geoffrey Z</font> - &quot;I wish I had time for 
        a long answer. The short version is that we had to balance Root type spells 
        verses both Solo AND Group play. While they may seem a bit underpowered 
        for Solo, they do very well (perhaps too well) in group environments. 
        We had to balance it somewhere between the two.</p>
      <p>Hope that helps. :) <br>

        few out there confused on what Research Practice is. Research practice 
        is something that Verant implemented to help us gain experience in Research 
        without spending hard earned points or wasting VERY hard to find runes. 
        There are two ways to go about this and it depends if you are of a good 
        background or evil background. To practice, you will need the Concordance 
        of Research Tome (which is a combining book much like the Lexicon) and 
        the recipe book which is called 'Runes and Research Book 2'. You learn 
        the recipes from the book Runes and Research Book 2, put the recipe items 
        within the Concordance of Research (you also need a quill and parchment 
        for each combination), and hit combine. Do it correctly and you should 
        have some practice runes. To learn how to get the Concordance of Research 
        and Runes of Research Books 1 and 2, goto the <a href="../quests/quests.htm">Quests</a> 
        page. There you need to pick if you are <a href="../quests/GoodResearch/GoodResearch.htm">Good</a> 
        or <a href="../quests/EvilResearch/EvilResearch.htm">Evil</a> and do the

        info upon Xegony... it seems my foul barbarian slave has heard of our 
        plot to have his head brought back to us. My spies have intercepted and 
        slain a messenger last night and found this letter upon the corpse:</p>
      <p>&quot;Good citizens of Xegony - I need your help!</p>
      <p>For many years I have slaved away to the every whims of the foul souls 
        known as Darkmoon, an evil group of dark elves that have terrorized the 
        honest citizens of Norrath. I have done this against my will only to keep 
        my children alive while they sit among filth, imprisoned in the dark elf 
        city of Neriak. The High Lord Graffe of Darkmoon is holding my children 
        captive just inside the walls of the city but try as I might; I have not 
        been able to free them. The last resort to free my children was to raid 
        the Darkmoon treasury and steal one of their most prized artifacts, a 
        staff of some power, and hold it for exchange in the release of my young 
        ones.</p>
      <p> A note from my son Jallaan was smuggled out of Neriak and has reached 
        my hands; alas my hopes to free them have been dashed. It appears that 
        the evil races are gathering soon to hunt me down and kill me. I wish 
        not to have my head used as some heathen's doorstop, so I have gone into 
        hiding with no hope of getting my children back. </p>
      <p> I call out now to my friends and good citizens of Norrath to aid me 
        in my time of need. My children sit now just inside the gates of the dark 
        elf city waiting to be released from captivity. If any of Norrath's good 
        people were to gather together and free Jallaan and Gwena from captivity, 
        I would be able to come out of hiding and leave my terms of slavery. In 
        turn for this great deed, I'm willing to turn over all the artifacts that 
        I have pilfered from the Darkmoon treasury to those who rescue my young 
        ones and deliver them back to Halas safe. </p>
      <p> I have seen the guards of Neriak and know this will be no easy task 
        to accomplish. The first group that is able to enter the city and deliver 
        the two children back to Halas will have all the hoarded treasure in my 
        bank within Halas.</p>
      <p>Please aid me in my time of need, you will not regret the help you lend 
        me. All those interested in freeing my children should meet at the entrance 
        to Nektulos on the East Commonland side, <b>Sunday, September 19th at 
        9 am PST (12 noon EST)</b>. </p>
      <p>Thank you my friends,<br>
        Leber of the Xegony Frozen North</p>
      <p>(ooc - This quest is open for "light" races only. The two barbarians 
        will be waiting just inside the Neriak Foreign Quarter zone and will group 
        with the first adventurers that zone through. The group will need to make 
        their way out of Nektulos before any spell or song can be used upon the 
        two barbarian captives (example: invisibility, teleport, cloud…), but 
        the two barbarians will aid in the escape anyway they can (including SoW 
        if needed). In the event that one of the barbies dies along the way, they 
        will need to be escorted back to their body from Freeport zone. Once the 
        group reaches Halas, Jallaan will retrieve a pack from the bank and turn 
        it over to the leader of the group. The pack will include many magic items 
        and a rare, high quality bear hide, total value is close to 1000 plat.)&quot;</p>

        Had an enchanter send me a bit of news that some high level Wizards might 
        enjoy if they did not know already:<br>
        &quot; Gravity Flux is also a level 39 (yes, Thirty-Nine) Enchanter spell. 
        Ask an Enchanter to make it for you. Be forewarned though, the scroll 
        will say that it is Enchanter Only, BUT it can be scribed by a wizard. 
        I have personally made the scroll Gravity Flux and given it to a level 
        50 Wizard. He succesfully scribed the spell. &quot;</p>

        More roleplay news for Xegony and a shameless plug for my guild =)</p>
      <p>&quot;Greetings Norrath, <br>
        To my dismay, it was brought to my attention that a great artifact was 
        stolen from the Darkmoon treasury a few days ago. The culprit has turned 
        out to be none other than the barbarian Leber, a former slave to our High 
        Lord Graffe of Darkmoon. I say former because as of now he will be hunted 
        down and killed on sight. Word has reached us that the filthy barbarian 
        is holding our artifact in exchange for the release of his two children, 
        currently being held captive inside Neriak. For many years Leber has served 
        as a slave to Graffe, while the High Lord held the children in a dungeon 
        within the dark elf city. Now Leber believes he may purchase his children's 
        lives with the exchange of our artifact. </p>
      <p>I am offering a grand reward for the safe return of Darkmoon's artifact. 
        The reward will be a pack full of various magic items that we have collected 
        over the years, plus some platinum. The hunt will start on <b>Sunday at 
        9:00 am PST - 12:00 noon EST, September 19th</b>. This hunt will be open 
        to only the Dark Races (dark elves, trolls and ogres). Leber has been 
        known to be able to travel wide distances in just a short while, so we 
        assume that our search will take us all across the continent of Antonica. 
        The first of our evil brethren to find, duel, and slay the heathen must 
        bring back the artifact (a staff) to Nektulos and you will be handsomely 
        rewarded with riches of great power. Be forewarned, we have information 
        that Leber has sought out help from his pale skinned allies, so this may 
        require a coordinated search with your fellow brethren of Innoruuk. Any 
        and all that feel up to the challenge must meet in Nektulos forest in 
        front of the pyramid before the starting time of the event so myself or 
        High Lord Graffe may take your name. Any late comers will be welcome to 
        register their name with Darkmoon as long as they start in Nektulos forest.</p>
      <p>I wish all the luck to my dark friends, may Innoruuk guide your steps.

        him. Leber will not be hiding in any so called "good" city but he may 
        travel from zone to zone. Only those that have given their names to a 
        Darkmoon rep in Nektulos may dual the filthy barbie)&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;The Dark Race Bezerkers Event!<br>
        Hail the minions of Innoruuk, Rallos Zek, and Cazic Thule! We the perpetrators 
        of Hate cordially invite all fellow Teir'Dal, Trolls, and Ogres to spread 
        the Hate, War, and Fear out amongst the Light Dwelling races of Norrath 
        on the Rallos Zek server.... Starting at 1 pm (central Earth time) on 
        September 26th, a bezerker event will be held to spread the wrath of THE 
        dark gods amongst the light dwelling races. Teams of dark races will be 
        assembled by the Bashers before the start of the event. After assembling 
        our might in Innothule swamp, each contestant team will be given charge 
        to kill as many light-dwelling PLAYER CHARACTERS as possible between Innothule 
        Swamp and West FreePort. A referee will be assigned to each group to tally 
        kills. The team that has the most confirmed kills will receive a hefty 
        reward of 200 plat to be divided equally amongst the winning team members. 
        Looting of ye slain victims is also allowed so the bounty received has 
        the possibility to be much greater.<br>
        <br>
        If interested in attending, email the event coordinator at <a href="mailto:pawnofhate@hotmail.com">pawnofhate@hotmail.com</a> 
        for Rules of the Event. Due to the limited number of referees, preference 
        will be given to those who email early. Please provide your character 
        name. If you plan on organizing your own team then provide us with your 
        team members' names. Characters without team members will be assigned 
        one. Max number of members per team is 5 and max player level is 20.&quot;</p>

        There is a new server player event website that I suggest you go check 
        out. It's a bit bare now, but hopefully with your help, this page can 
        get off its feet and be a great resource for events! Here is a bit of 
        info that was sent in:</p>
      <p>&quot;I have started a new EverQuest related site. It is called EverQuests 
        and I would like it to be a repository for player run events. I will have 
        a page for each server with events for that server sorted by date. Eventually, 
        I would like to add search capabilities and the ability for people to 
        add their own events. Right now, all players would need to do is send 
        me email at <a href="mailto:arncota@everquests.com">arncota@everquests.com</a> 
        and I will add the event to my page.&quot;</p>

        Seems that the original poster of the &quot;Camp Banning&quot; to EQVault 
        had his wired crossed just a bit. You can read more on it over at EQVault, 
        but what Verant is doing is politely telling the high level players that 
        are camping a low level item, to move on if there is another lower level 
        group there that wishes to take the spawn. This is a far cry from &quot;GMs 
        are now warning High level people (40+) that are camping for Jboots, that 
        they are exploiting&quot;. The GM's will only step in and ask the high 
        level players to move on if they do not yield to a lower level group that 
        wishes the spawn. Now.. if you argue with the GM, you bet your hiney you'll 
        get a warning. =)</p>

        I read on EQVault where somebody submitted info that Verant is warning 
        and banning high level players for camping lower level items such as Journeyman 
        Boots. I cracked up when I read this and I wanted to know where this guy 
        got his information. Don't beleive it at all. The only way you can get 
        a warning is if you blantantly kill steal and argue with a GM. I was amazed 
        that EQVault even posted that.. haha!</p>

          New Poll Posted. This question asks if when battling large mobs such 
          as Lady Vox or Nagafen, should Verant somehow implement a way to link 
          two or more groups together so that they may share experience and converse 
          in chat? Granted, this would have to be initiated by a Guide or GM because 
          they would not allow the player to do it and have the whole party clear 
          a zone with ease. It would only be useful for the BIG mob's.</p>

          Big BMP's are Good. Small Jpegs are Bad. =) Thanks to all of the submitters...

          for the viewers with 56k's. I may need to finish it up when I get home..
