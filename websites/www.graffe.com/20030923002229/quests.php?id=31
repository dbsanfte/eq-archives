</head><body><table border=0 align=center width=80%><tr><td><center><h1>Vision Shift - Spell Quest</h1><br>by Whizbang Dustyboots</center><br><I>Note: At level 44, you will need a full group for this quest; sometime in the 50s, this becomes soloable, and trivial (if tedious) after 60.</I>

<br><br><I> Look for Redlin Hullnic, a gnome sitting down outside a hut beside the lighthouse. </I>

<br><br><b>You say, "Hail, Redlin Hullnic"</b>

<br><br>Redlin Hullnic says "Eh, who's there? Yender is that you? No you're far too tall to be Yender.  You must be one o' them [pirates]!" Redlin then begins to beat furiously on your ankle with his staff.  Furiously might be a slightly strong word, as he doesn't seem to be doing any real damage.

<br><br><b>You say, "I am not a pirate"</b>

<br><br>Redlin Hullnic says "Not a pirate, aye?  Well lucky thing for you, I would have given you a real thrashing with my stick if you were!  I don't suppose you know where I could get a good pair of gnomish glasses around here do ya?  Mine broke on the boat ride over and I can't see a thing without 'em."

<br><br><I>There is a gnomish pirate who wears glasses in the pirate port town of Dulak's Harbor, accessible through the sea caves south of the lighthouse.

<br><br>Architect Vaukin (male gnome pirate model) is located at -220, -240, in a large barn-like structure where the pirates normally build ships' hulls, but which stands mostly empty now save for a lot of lumber and a number of dark elf assistants. As you come from Gunthak, it's on the street on the right, but is the first building on the left, at an intersection of two roads.

<br><br>Architect Vaukin is a static spawn, between a pile of barrels and the wall. If you drop invisibility there, you will typically agro a dark elf "engineering assistant," although the pathing in town is such that it may take a few moments for him or her to get to you. Unless you decide to kite, you shouldn't ever get more than two adds, max.

<br><br>His place holder is "A lead engineer" (male gnome pirate model) and his hit points seem to be about 2750-2800 (so he was not fleeing after a single full hit of Agnarr's Thunder, although it should be noted that a few times I got a full resist casting AT on PHs). Only loot is coin and a shiv. He appears to be a warrior.</I>

<br><br>Your faction standing with Nadox Initiate got worse.
<br>a lead engineer's corpse says "I expect this will put us a bit behind schedule."

<br><br><I>Respawn is about 20 minutes, although it feels infinitely longer. It took me about two hours from the time I found the right spot and began clearing place holders to get Architect Vaukin to spawn, although many people have waited much longer, even days, to get him to spawn. He also fully resisted a cast of Agnarr's Thunder, but not all of them. Hit points appear to almost exactly 5,000 and he appears to be a warrior.</I>

<br><br>Architect Vaukin's body is rent by thunderous energy.
<br>You have slain Architect Vaukin!
<br>Your faction standing with Nadox Initiate got worse.
<br>Architect Vaukin's corpse says "No, it cannot be!"

<br><br><I>Dropped coin, a Lava Infused Charm (don't get excited, it's not an actual charm), and a Gnomish Spectacles (wizard, no drop, non-equipable). </I>

<br><br>Lava Infused Charm
<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM
<br>Slot: Neck
<br>AC: 5
<br>STR: +3 WIS: +5 INT: +5 HP: +25 SV COLD: +8
<br>WT: 0.3 Size: TINY
<br>Class: PAL RNG SHD BRD BST
<br>Race: ALL

<br><br><I>The good news is that there is a second spawn who drops the spectacles, and that you can camp both of them at once: In the lighthouse near the water, a gnome pirate named Konus Alatuk will also drop the spectacles. His place holder is a male gnome pirate model called "a lighthouse pirate." Find the spawn at around -480, -1000. Konus has stats comparable to Architect Vaukin, and the two PHs are similar. Konus can drop several items, but he also can drop a Purple Tipped Orchid, a charm that activates at nighttime. Stats improved include stamina, wisdom, agility, mana and cold resistance. He doesn't drop it every time, so remember that you were killing him for the spell, not the charm ...

<br><br><I>Go back to the Gulf of Gunthak and give Redlin the spectacles. </I>

<br><br>Redlin Hullnic takes the spectacles from your hands and puts them up to his eyes and blinks several times. "Many thanks, Whizbang! I don't know what I would have done without you.  Probably stagger around the island half blind for the rest of my life! At any rate I can repay you with a little trick I picked up along the way.  If you ever get in a jam, hopefully you won't be as forgetful as I was!" He hands you a scroll with several runes scrawled across it.

<br><br><I>The Vision Shift scroll is no drop. The level 44 spell is an upgrade to See Invisibility and adds Infravision to the buff and like See Invisibility, it can be cast on others.
