There are three places in the entire world where Polio is still around, and for some reason all our efforts to eradicate the disease have failed. The above link might have something to do with it. Perhaps also we should NEVER AGAIN USE MEDICAL PEOPLE AS SPYS. Fucking morons. As harsh as it is, at least one thing will come from this - fewer Taliban children; while this is sad, it's sadder still that we are unable to do anything about it for these children.</div>

<ul><li style=""> Two others are injured in the blast</li><li style=""> Landmines continue to kill dozens in Afghanistan</li></ul><br />
Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Ten girls were killed in eastern Afghanistan on Monday when a landmine exploded as they were out collecting firewood -- the latest casualties in one of the most mined countries in the world.<br />
 <br />
Two other girls were injured in the incident in Nangarhar province, said Ahmad Zia Abdulzai, the spokesman for the province's governor.<br />
 <br />
Landmines -- those planted by insurgents and those left over from the Soviet occupation -- continue to kill dozens of Afghans every year.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Naturally curious, children are likely to pick up strange objects, such as the infamous toy-like 'butterfly' mines that Soviet forces spread by the millions in Afghanistan,&quot; according to UNICEF.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Apparently there will be one. A nice 10 minute set-up trailer is at the link. Bruce Boxleitner (sp) is in it so it has to be legit.<br />
<br />
I thought Tron: Legacy was a missed opportunity. It turned out to be kind of boring in my opinion and it didn't have any of the &quot;geekdom&quot; that the first one had in it. With the explosion of the internet and other aspects of the computer world since the original I think they could have done something much better (like maybe have CLU's goal be to get his computer access to the internet or something).<br />
<br />
I'll most likely still give this movie a shot though as I really believe the core setting is strong and a truly great movie is hidden somewhere inside it. Now if they'd just get the right writers to bring it out.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Now for some good news.  Its a really good movie, better than LOTR part one.  I read some mixed reviews, was kinda expecting the Star Wars prequels but I was really pleasantly surprised.  It is long, 3 hours with previews, has a lot of stuff jammed into it, including some from the Silmarilian.  It would actually be a better movie if it was shorter.  Some stupid slapstick, but not too bad.  I still like the animated Hobbit movie better.  <br />
<br />
-they do have the Thats What Bilbo Baggins Hates song in it!<br />
<br />
-It ends at the end of Out of the Frying Pan and Into the Fire<br />
<br />
-Thorin was better than I thought he would be, and the dwarves are basically mini klingons, complete with the headbutt<br />
<br />
-Kinda wish Bird Crap the Brown wasn't in it, he was stupid and gave me flashbacks to pod racing<br />
<br />
-Sweater vest dwarf pimp!<br />
<br />
Its going to suck ass waiting a year.  And next years one better have the battle of five armies in it or I am going to find Peter Jackson and kick him in the balls.  I don't want to wait another 6 months.</div>

		<hr />
		
			NEWTOWN, CONN -- Twenty-nine people including 22 children were massacred in a horrific bloodboth at the Sandy Hook Elementary School Friday morning, a source with knowledge of the investigation tells Hearst Connecticut Newspapers.<br />
<br />
The Associated Press is reporting that 27 people including 18 children were killed.<br />
<br />
The gunman is dead, state police have confirmed.<br />
<br />
Few other details were immediately available, and other reports contradicted those numbers.<br />
<br />
But local, state and federal authorities swooped down on the school about 9:40 a.m. after someone called 911 from inside the school and reported the shooting<br />
<br />
Gov. Dannel P. Malloy was meeting with families from the school at 1:40 p.m., as a news conference was held in Newtown.<br />
<br />
&quot;His chief concern is to get the families the information as soon as possible,&quot; said Roy Occhiogrosso, a spokesman for Malloy's office.<br />
<br />
There were fatalities at the school, State Police spokesman Lt. J. Paul Vance said, adding that no other information on the fatalities would be released until notifications were made.<br />
<br />
&quot;The shooter is deceased within the building,&quot; Vance said. He said police, including his department, the Newtown police, the Danbury state's attorney's office and federal agencies are investigating the shooting. Vance said &quot;search warrant,&quot; activity is being carried out to cover all their bases regarding the shooter.<br />
<br />
Vance didn't take any questions from the media, but said the situation is secure.<br />
<br />
&quot;The public is not in danger,&quot; Vance said.<br />
<br />
ABC News said state and federal sources told the network that dozens of victims had been shot, many of them fatally.<br />
<br />
ABC said the shooter was an employee who had been fired earlier in the morning and returned with an assault weapon, shot a school employee and then shot himself.<br />
<br />
The network quoted one parent who said that &quot;hundreds of shots&quot; were fired during the 9:40 a.m. incident.<br />
<br />
Panicked parents rushed to the suburban school this morning after the unidentified gunman wounded a school employee, authorities and sources said. There were also reports that another gunman was involved, and Danbury police had surrounded a van in that city investigating the incident.<br />
<br />
Several students were reportedly brought to Danbury Hospital's emergency room this morning, but the extent of their injuries was unclear.<br />
<br />
Andrea Rynn, spokeswoman for the Western Connecticut Health Network, which runs Danbury Hospital, said three patients were taken to the hospital and it's not expected any other patients will be sent there. The hospital emergency department is on lockdown as a precautionary measure, but is still accepting patients.<br />
<br />
There are armed guards outside the hospital.<br />
<br />
A parent from Shelton whose 6-year-old son is a student at Sandy Hook Elementary School was at the hospital, and said he doesn't know whether he is OK.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's the only family I have left,&quot; said Neil Heslin.<br />
<br />
While both ABC and CBS reported that multiple children had been shot, other sources said the pupils had been cut by flying glass caused by the shooting.<br />
<br />
A 9-year-old student heard the gunshots this morning.<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw police with big guns,&quot; said Venesa Bajraliu. &quot;It was a little scary.&quot;<br />
<br />
She said she was in her classroom when she heard shots, about 20. The class was instructed to go into the teacher's office, she said.<br />
<br />
Police came and took the students out, telling them to close their eyes.<br />
<br />
Some reports identified the school employee as a teacher, and said she was wounded in the leg. Other reports from the scene, including from a CBS news reporter, indicated the school principal, Dawn Hochsprung, was shot and had been killed.<br />
<br />
The United Methodist Church, down the hill from the school, has opened a sanctuary for families and anyone who has come to the scene. The American Red Cross is setting up in the church's basement to help first responders. The Red Cross is also going to the town hall to provide grief counseling and other support.<br />
<br />
A hospital official confirmed that three people were transported from the scene to the hospital. No information on their conditions is immediately available.<br />
<br />
Danbury Police Chief Al Baker said people were killed in the shooting, but offered no specifics. He brought in extra officers to Danbury Hospital to control the &quot;chaos expected as parents and media arrive.&quot;<br />
<br />
Children are being evacuated to the Sandy Hook firehouse and all schools in town are locked down.<br />
<br />
A parent who picked up their child at the school reported that children were advised by a fireman to close their eyes and run past the office, where the shooting reportedly occurred during an administrators meeting.<br />
<br />
Superintendent of Schools Janet Robinson is at the firehouse where parents are picking up their children. She has been trying to contact the school's principal.<br />
<br />
Hocksprung became principal of Sandy Hook Elementary School July 1, 2010.<br />
<br />
She was an administrator in Danbury public schools for six years, for five years as assistant principal of Danbury's Rogers Park Middle School and from 2003-2004, an assistant principal of Danbury High School.<br />
<br />
Police are planning a press conference for early afternoon.<br />
<br />
Andrea Rynn, spokeswoman for Western Connecticut Health Network, said Danbury Hospital's emergency department has convened its emergency team to be ready for the victims of this incident. She did not say how many victims are expected from the shooting.<br />
<br />
Rynn said that &quot;out of an abundance of caution'' the hospital put its emergency department on lockdown Friday. There is no direct threat to the department, she said.<br />
<br />
Robinson said it is best if parents do not try to call the school at this time. The school district will release a message once further information is known.<br />
<br />
Danbury parochial schools and Bethel schools are in lockdown as a precaution. Danbury schools are keeping close watch.<br />
<br />
Baker said he brought an extra shift of officers for the schools. While indications are the Danbury schools are safe, he said it would be &quot;prudent to take precautions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are doing our due diligence to make sure our schools are safe,&quot; Baker said.<br />
<br />
The White House said President Barack Obama was notified of the shootin<br />

	</div>
</div>This is rather surprising to me,  As someone who grew up near this town and only two exits away from this school on I-84  I can say that Newtown was an extremely quiet town.  Articles do say Sandy Hook but that is actually part of Newtown.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>The games would count in the standings as regular-season games and there would be a trophy for the winner.  (Possibly count only wins and not losses)<br />
<br />
I am thinking something like:  Each league invites as many teams as possible who play a series of one-game playoffs to determine and a winner for each league.  The tournament should be quick and festive, perhaps inviting multiple teams to a single location for doubleheaders and such.  I think you'd have to sacrifice some normal regular season games for this to happen, but there are plenty of those.  <br />
<br />
Basically: I think the MLB needs something to spice up its long season.  Summer is the best time for baseball and it's also the time when there are the fewest distractions from other leagues like the NFL and NBA.  Having a short, dramatic tournament would give fans and media something to focus on, a reference point for the rest of the season.  <br />
<br />
This is somewhat inspired by the progression of the Tennis season, which peaks in the summer with Roland Garros, Wimbledon and the US Open then gradually winds to a close with the indoor Finals in London.  (There's the Australian Open as well but I don't think the MLB is remotely in a position to play in the southern hemisphere during January.  Though there is southeast Asia.)</div>

			A Tucson man who killed a pit bull puppy during an argument with his wife was sentenced to 1 1/2 years in prison and three years intensive probation Wednesday.<br />
<br />
Kevin Michael Davis, 46, was indicted in July on one count of cruel mistreatment of an animal and aggravated domestic violence.<br />
<br />
<b>Davis and his wife got into an argument over whether he should stop drinking and he twice took her puppy by its hind legs and slammed its head into concrete, killing it, according to court documents.</b><br />
<br />
Davis pleaded guilty to cruelty to animals resulting in serious physical injury and aggravated domestic violence. Under the terms of his plea agreement, he could have been placed on probation on both charges or he could have received up to 2 years in prison on the cruelty charge and up to 2 1/2 years in prison on the domestic violence charge.<br />
<br />
Assistant Pima County Public Defender Vladimir Novokshchenov asked Pima County Superior Court Judge Paul Tang to place his client on probation, noting he was just recently diagnosed as seriously mentally ill and would be able to receive treatment if released from custody.<br />
<br />
Deputy Pima County Attorney Danielle Constant asked for a prison sentence because Davis has an extensive violent criminal history.<br />
<br />
Davis’ wife did not speak at the hearing, but Constant said she did not want him to go to prison.<br />
<br />
Tang opted for the prison sentence, saying he had a hard time imagining what Davis did to the puppy, all in an effort to emotionally torture his wife. “It’s beyond disturbing and deplorable,” Tang said.<br />
<br />
Davis has seven prior felony convictions and 21 misdemeanor convictions, Tang said. <b>The crime was committed four months after Davis was released from prison.</b>
