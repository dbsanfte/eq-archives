<b>Plane of Fire, Guide for kiting the yellows.</b>
<p>There is an area in the Plane of Fire known on my server as 'the field of gib' or just 'gib' for short. It's the field of level 66-67 mobs past the golem/phoenix bridge and before the castle. Soloing here at first might seem impossible or have no purpose at all.

<p>It is hard, but possible...and why? Well I've found several purposes; exp if you dont think you have the mana regen for tables, for soloing when theres no good amount of reds up, pulling spiders to get saps for armor/earring quest and lastly, to spice up quad pulls for solo or group. The first motivation for me to even try such an insane thing was the pretime rush to make armor for people.

<p>Anyways, how its done.
<p>If you can walk to tables without aggro, and you feel very confident in your quadding skills, you can quad gib

<p>First off is the pull. You can pull with temp flux if you think yer hardcore or whatever, but that can lead to a train in the long run. I suggest snare pulling but hey that can lead to a train too. The area outside the steps of the castle is the safe place to stand, pull or kite. However avoid kiting there at all costs, a train can sneak up on you real easy.

<p>The next step is to time your pull into the castle so you don't aggro the pats, indicated by the red arrows in the diagram:

<p>The aggro range in fire is so low that the timing doesnt have to be perfect, in fact ive sometimes pulled 4 snared mobs right under both pats at the same time and nothing happened.

<p>If you get this far, you are golden, you follow the green line into the castle, just as you would if you were going to tables..and you can go to tables and kite, or you can kite around the 3 buildings with the green path indicated on the diagram. Kiting mobs through the choke point before the 3 buildings is just as safe as walking through it, just don't let the mobs get kited through buildings that have mobs.

<p>The pillars at the top of that area are nice to kite through along with the carpet area in the staircase room, but be careful you can aggro mobs through the wall from the carpet room if you go too far down the line of pillars.

<p>Spawns are indicated on the diagram to give a good idea of why the green lines are where they are, as long as you stick close to the 3 buildings or in the middle of the carpet room, youll be fine. Mobs don't warp on you if you kite them through buildings so don't be afraid.

<p>Most importantly, be polite to any tables group, this is the main reason i indicated the alternate kite area, so that in case you die...which is very likely to happen...you dont kill 6 other people and make em real mad at you.

<p>If snare wears off or you get a bunch of resists on the pull, the blue line on the diagram is the best path for you to take while trying to resnare.

<p>I think that about covers it all, you'll probly die a lot, im not held responsible, but if you got questions or comments or have something to add...
