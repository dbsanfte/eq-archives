<br />
The Galaxy theatre in Gig Harbor, about 10 minutes from where I live has a &quot;VIP Theatre&quot;, which is, perhaps, the most brilliant idea for a movie venue ever. You pay a bit more for the ticket, but you also get bigger seats, more room between the seats with a place to put your drink, candy, etc... and you can order drinks during the film. Pay for it in advance, tell them to bring you a new beer every 15 minutes, and they'll keep them coming.<br />
<br />
This is like first class moviegoing, in exactly the same way you'd think of first class flying. And it's awesome. Top it off, and Galaxy theatres in this area are all brand new, with beautiful Cristie digital projectors, and you've got a top notch movie experience that beats going to a bar by a mile. From this day forward, I don't think I'll ever go to a &quot;normal&quot; movie again.</div>

This platform allows the servers in &lt;Company Name&gt;’s office to self-replicate and synchronize, allowing users in each of the offices to have access to the same set of data. <br />

			<hr />
			
				<b>HOUSTON -- A suburban Houston homeowner was cleared by a grand jury Monday for shooting to death two men he suspected of burglarizing his neighbor's home.</b> <br />
<br />
Joe Horn, 61, shot the two men last November after he saw them crawling out the windows of a neighbor's house in Pasadena, a Houston suburb. <br />
<br />
Horn, a retired grandfather, called 911 and told the dispatcher he had a shotgun and was going to kill them. The dispatcher pleaded with him not to go outside, but Horn confronted the men with a 12-gauge shotgun and shot both in the back. <br />
<br />
&quot;The message we're trying to send today is the criminal justice system works,&quot; Harris County District Attorney Kenneth Magidson told reporters at the courthouse. <br />
<br />
Horn's attorney, Tom Lambright, has said his client believed the two men had broken into his neighbor's home and that he shot them only when they came into his yard and threatened him. <br />
<br />
The two suspected burglars, Hernando Riascos Torres, 38, and Diego Ortiz, 30, were unemployed illegal immigrants from Colombia. Torres was deported to Colombia in 1999 after a 1994 cocaine-related conviction. <br />
<br />
The incident touched off protests from civil rights activists who said the shooting was racially motivated and that Horn took the law into his own hands. Horn's supporters defended his actions, saying he was protecting himself and being a good neighbor to a homeowner who was out of town. <br />
<br />
&quot;I understand the concerns of some in the community regarding Mr. Horn's conduct,&quot; Magidson said. &quot;The use of deadly force is carefully limited in Texas law to certain circumstances ... In this case, however, the grand jury concluded that Mr. Horn use of deadly force did not rise to a criminal offense.&quot; <br />
<br />
Magidson said nine of the 12 grand jurors would have had to vote in favor of an indictment in order for Horn to be charged. Lambright said this week that his client regrets the shooting and would stay inside if he had it to do over again. <br />
<br />
Lambright did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment from The Associated Press. <br />
<br />
<b>In the 911 call, a dispatcher urges Horn to stay inside his house and not risk lives. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't go outside the house,&quot; the 911 operator pleaded. &quot;You're gonna get yourself shot if you go outside that house with a gun. I don't care what you think.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You wanna make a bet?&quot; Horn answered. &quot;I'm gonna kill 'em.&quot; After the shooting, he redialed 911. <br />
<br />
&quot;I had no choice,&quot; he said, his voice shaking. &quot;They came in the front yard with me, man. I had no choice. Get somebody over here quick.&quot; </b><br />
<br />
Texas law allows people to use deadly force to protect themselves if it is reasonable to believe they are in mortal danger. In limited circumstances, people also can use deadly force to protect their neighbor's property; for example, if a homeowner asks a neighbor to watch over his property while he's out of town. <br />
<br />
It's not clear whether the neighbor whose home was burglarized asked Horn to watch over his house.

The best part is, I'm so cut off from the real world in college town, what with no active classes and no cable connection, nor really any desire to browse sites other than graffe's and gaming sites, that I didn't even realize California was<br />

So I drove home on Friday and I pop over the hills into the San Joaquin valley, and I'm looking at a sky that looks like China-Lite. &quot;WTF?!&quot; I say to myself. That's no cloud.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the air is cleaning out here. Maybe the throbbing headaches I've had for the past 6 days will stop. Between this and grindel's recent wind issues, all that's left is the great quake, and we're looking at armageddon. Are you prepared?<br />

Here&#8217;s a collection of tips I&#8217;ve picked up that may help you:<br />
<br />
1. Brushes are too thin and round to be comfortable for large chunky fingers. Either buy a triangular &#8220;pen grip&#8221; from Amazon or the like, or use three matchsticks tapped to the handle to make it easier to grasp. <br />
Another thing is to cut off a fair length of the end of the brush, I don&#8217;t like having a foot long brush when all I need is 6 inch near the front!<br />
<br />

<br />
2. Holding minis for painting can be a pain: a great tip is to take a small plastic, flat topped bottle (like a Tamiya paint tub, or old Rall Partha or Gameswokshop or similar), and put Blue-Tac on the top. You can thus stick your mini on top for painting, and hold the empty paint tub below. I also put scrap lead or steel nuts etc in the bottle to give it a good counterweight, so the mini won&#8217;t get knocked over.<br />
<br />
3. I like using a dark wash to add shading and dark edges to areas (to delineate them). Use an empty paint pot, and mix a dark brown and black paint for the wash. You do not want to use just black as that tends to look too artificial, some brown makes it look more natural. Once mixed, add 50% to 100% water, as you preffer. A &#8220;wash&#8221; is a think mixture designed to flow over an area, and gather in lower areas, such as folds of skin.<br />
<br />
4. Hard to figure out exactly what paint colour is in each bottle, isn&#8217;t it?! Damn, that drives me nuts, when the colour of the paint isn&#8217;t obvious on the bottle. So what I do is paint the top white, then paint the bottle colour over the white. There after, it&#8217;s easy to see what the colour of the bottle is!<br />
<br />
5. Paint tends to evapourate and congeal. Remember and add a few drops of water to the pot if you&#8217;ve had it open a while. To help stir up paint, you can get small stainless steel nuts or bolts, drop them in a pot, and shake to stir the paint. Note metal paints are extremely bad at clumping up, due to the metal flakes used to give colour.<br />
<br />
6. To paint gems, make the top of the gem dark, bottom light, and add a highlight to the top. This resembles the way in real life that light refracts through gems. Add gloss varnish over gem when model is varnished, to make it look lustrous.<br />
<br />
7. A browny-orange wash or ink is a great way to make metal look rusty.<br />
<br />
8. Real steel has a bluish-grey look to it, so using such a wash colour is nice way to get realism.<br />
<br />
9. The standard method to paint metal is to undercoat black, then drybrush metal over the top. If you do not put a wash over the metal it won&#8217;t look so good. You can also paint metal with non-metallics (&#8220;non-metal metal&#8221;, as it&#8217;s called - NMM), so for steel you could work from almost blackish grey blue, to blue grey.<br />
<br />
10. For drybrushing, what I do is take an old brush that&#8217;s a bit worn, chop the hair down straight to half length  or les, to have stiff bristles that&#8217;s great to drybrush with. Drybrushing, for those not familiar with it, is taking a brush with just a small amount of paint on it, wiping most of the paint off, and lightly painting over the highest surfaces of model, to leave a highlight.<br />
<br />
11. I always undercoat white, as it provides the best colours. However black is nice for doing lots of armoured figures quickly. The new &#8220;Foundation&#8221; paints from Gamesworkshop cover over black quite nice, so can be used to do reds/yellows (which usually demand a white undercoat).<br />
<br />
12. For basing, what I do is superglue or epoxy the mini to base. Then use plaster for filling in house wall cracks, the kind that comes in a squeezy tube, to fill in slots in the base, or add shapes etc. On top I then add a mix of white glue (PVA) and water (50/50%), and sprinkle on stuff like flock, sand, tiny rocks etc. When dry, tap off any excess. I then usually paint on top to hold it all down, give a colour then drybrush. You can also add magnetic plastic or tiny magnets into the base, for use on metal or magnetic game bases, or to stop minis moving in tool boxes etc. <br />
&#8220;Static grass&#8221; is another nice touch to a mini&#8217;s base, it looks like grass, a spot of PVA glue mixed with water, drop some static grass onto it, turn mini upside down (so grass stands straight), tap off excess.<br />
<br />
13. To glue parts of a metal model together, I use superglues (cyanoacrylate). , if there are few gaps. Note that superglues only work good on flat surfaces that are clean and flat together, so I often sand surfaces flat. For areas with gaps, I use superglue and/or epoxy. For large pieces I often &#8220;pin&#8221; the tow halves to add strength.<br />
Pinning is where you insert a steel pin into one half, that matches with another drilled ole in the other. To do this, add a small drop of paint to one half, and put them together, leaving a neat guide on both halves that matches up. Use a &#8220;pin drill&#8221; to make a hole, and I use panel pin nails, cut to fit, for the actual pin. Then epoxy them and the model together. Gamesworkshop sells pin drills.<br />
<br />
14. There are very fine tipped permanent ink pens from Staedler (pigment liner) which are great for doing eye pupils!<br />
<br />

PS, is this Dmitry with his Makin Penii?  :evil:<br />

I've been looking forward to this update for quite a while.  Any 360 users out there know what advantages XBox Live will have after this is in place?</div>
