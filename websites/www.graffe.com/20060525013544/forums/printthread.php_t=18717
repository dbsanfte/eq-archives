<h3 class = "title">Standard Player vs. Environment Server</h3><br />
<p><br />
Currently, players now have the ability to attack almost all opposing faction NPCs including vendors and quest givers.  If a player attacks an opposing faction NPC, players of the opposite faction are then able to target and attack that player.  Whenever an NPC is attacked, players who share the same faction as that NPC will receive a system message indicating that a specific town is under attack.<br />
<p><br />
Please be aware that some quest NPCs might not always be available. If they have been killed, players should wait for the NPC to respawn.  The development team expects there to be some bugs associated with this so be sure to /bug and /suggest whenever necessary.<br />
<p><br />
Actions that will enable PvP on the standard player vs. environment server are: attacking an NPC of the opposing faction, attacking a player who attacked an NPC, and/or aiding a player engaged in PvP.  Players will also have the ability to enable PvP on their own by using the /pvp command.  Once PvP has been enabled by a player, no matter what the method, it will remain in effect for five minutes.<br />
<p><br />
In time, all standard servers will include a consensual Player vs. Player system called Battlegrounds.  Once Battlegrounds has been implemented, players will have the ability to attack other players to defend their cities and towns from invasion. We expect the Battlegrounds system to be available later during the beta test.  <br />
<p><br />
<br />
<a name = "b"></a><br />
<h3 class = "title">Horde vs. Alliance Race War Server</h3><br />
<br />
<p><br />
The new Horde vs. Alliance race war server will establish a straightforward method for the development team to test and balance the races and classes in a PvP environment.  PvP concepts will be gradually introduced on this server.  This means that the initial implementation of PvP is not how our final model will work once World of Warcraft is released.  This patch includes the fundamental ideas of PvP in order to tune and refine the very foundation of our PvP model.<br />
<p><br />
On the Horde vs. Alliance race war server, territories will be indicated whenever a player enters a new zone.  The zone name will now include additional information to inform the player of the territories status.  Additionally, the mini-map will be color coded to indicate who controls the zone: Green = Friendly, Red = Enemy and Yellow = Contested.<br />
<p><br />
Players will be able to initiate player vs. player combat based on what territory they are in.  Players in friendly territories are safe unless they decide to engage an opposing faction player in combat.  Players in enemy territories will always be at risk and can be attacked by all players that belong in the territory.  All players can be attacked in neutral (contested) territories.<br />
<p><br />
Actions that will enable a player for PvP status on the Horde vs. Alliance race war server will be: entering or being in an enemy territory, entering or being in a contested territory, attacking an NPC of the opposing faction, attacking another player, and/or aiding a player engaged in PvP.  Players will also be able to enable PvP on their own by using the /pvp command.  Once PvP has been enabled for a player, no matter what the method, it will remain in effect for five minutes.<br />
<p><br />
<br />
<a name = "c"></a><br />
<h3 class = "title">Rest State Changes</h3><br />
<p><br />
The Rest State system has undergone several changes.  There are now three tiers of rest states: Rested = 200% experience, Normal = 150% experience and Tired = 100% experience.<br />
<p><br />
The rest timer is much more flexible than before, allowing players to gradually accumulate incremental rest credit for all time spent logged out.  Additionally, people who do not log into World of Warcraft for several days will gain bonus rest credit.  This will allow those who only play once or twice a week the added bonus of playing as rested (200% experience) for longer periods of time than those who play on a daily basis.<br />
<p><br />
Players also have the ability to rest anywhere in the world. This should help players who forget or choose not to log off at an inn. Resting at an inn is still the preferred method, as rest credit will accumulate four times faster for players logged off inside of an inn.<br />
<p><br />
Lastly, the Rest State modifier is now level-based using a sliding scale to determine how much experience you can gain at each tier instead of the previous flat 20,000 experience per level.  <br />
<p><br />
<br />
<a name = "d"></a><br />
<h3 class = "title">Enter the City to Rest</h3><br />
<p><br />
When visiting one of the six main cities (Darnassus, Ironforge, Orgrimmar, Stormwind, Thunder Bluff and The Undercity), players will no longer need to check into the inn to rest.  Players will however still need to seek an innkeeper to receive a hearthstone or to bind themselves to the city.<br />
<p><br />
In this initial implementation, there will be some areas close to the cities that will allow a player to rest without actually being in the city.  There are also some areas within each city that are not currently activated for resting.  Please be sure to check the character portrait to ensure that the character is resting before logging off.  The team is aware of this and will continue to work through these areas.<br />
<p><br />
As before, you will still need to rest at an Inn in smaller towns.<br />
<p><br />
<br />
<a name = "e"></a><br />
<h3 class = "title">Skill System Changes</h3><br />
<p><br />
The focus of the skill system is to allow character's the ability to choose secondary skills.  As such, attributes will now raise automatically when a character levels.  As a result of this change, characters will receive less skill points than before.  <br />
<p><br />
Current characters may lose some skill points to compensate for the redesign of the Skill System.  In some instances, characters may fall into a negative skill point status if they have already spent more skill points than the new system will allot them.<br />
<p><br />
<br />
<a name = "f"></a><br />
<h3 class = "title">Old Characters Unlocked</h3><br />
<p><br />
All of the older characters from previous patches have been unlocked and are available once again.  The older characters have all been assigned skill points as appropriate for their levels.  Their talents have been disabled.<br />
<p><br />
<br />
<a name = "g"></a><br />
<h3 class = "title">Items Deleted</h3><br />
With a few exceptions, all items and currency are being deleted for this patch.  The following items will not be deleted: Bags, Scarlet Key, all Shaman Totems and the Hearthstone.  Each character will be assigned funds based on their level.<br />
<p><br />
Players will be able to redo quests that have already been completed in order to gain back quest items.<br />
<p><br />
<br />
<a name = "h"></a><br />
<h3 class = "title">Quests Reset</h3><br />
All quest progress for existing characters has been reset.  Characters have the ability to go back and redo all quests if they wish.  For players that were in the middle of a quest chain, those quests will need to be restarted from the beginning.<br />
<p><br />
Quests were reset to allow players the means for reacquiring lost quest items and to participate in the many quests that have been fixed and rebalanced.<br />
<p><br />
<br />
<a name = "i"></a><br />
<h3 class = "title">Resistances</h3><br />
<p><br />
The beginnings of the new resistance system are in the game.  Players and some creatures now have the ability to resist damage from offensive spells and abilities based on their total resistance, their level and the level of the person or creature causing the damage.<p><br />
<p><br />
New items, with better resistances, will be available in the future.<br />
<p><br />
<br />
<a name = "j"></a><br />
<h3 class = "title">Introduction Cinematic For All Races</h3><br />
<p><br />
A cinematic is now available for each race and will be played after character creation takes place.  <br />
<p><br />
<br />
<a name = "k"></a><br />
<h3 class = "title">Postal System Introduced</h3><br />
<p><br />
Players now have the ability to send and receive in-game mail though World of Warcraft's postal system.  Every inn has a mailbox that players can right click in order to access mailbox functionality.<br />
<p><br />
There are several types of mail:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Normal Mail: This is text only mail written on stationery.  Normal mail may also include money.<br />
<li>Package:  Players will receive a package when an item is sent to them.  A package can also include a text message and money.<br />
<li>C.O.D: Players will receive a C.O.D. mail when an item has been sent to them that they still need to pay for.  C.O.D. mail will need to be accepted and paid for, rejected or postponed until its expiration date.<br />
</ul><br />
<p><br />
Normal Mail will arrive at their destinations immediately while Packages and C.O.D items will take one hour to arrive.<br />
<p><br />
<ul><br />
<li>Normal mail: expires in 30 days, deleted when expired.<br />
<li>Package: expires in 30 days, returned to sender when expired.<br />
<li>C.O.D.: expires in 3 days, returned to sender when expired.<br />
</ul><br />
Mail can be sent to players by NPCs.  <br />
<p><br />
<br />
<a name = "l"></a><br />
<h3 class = "title">Level Cap Raised</h3><br />
<p><br />
The level cap has been increased to 45.  New zones, quests, items and content have been added to accommodate the level increase along with the ability to purchase and ride mounts!<br />
<p><br />
<br />
<a name = "m"></a><br />
<h3 class = "title">Mounts</h3><br />
<p><br />
Race specific mounts are now available.  A player can train in any mount; however, the skill points necessary to train for a mount assigned to a different race will cost significantly more skill points. <br />
<p><br />
The Warlock spell to summon the Nightmare, a Warlock specific mount, is available as well.  The Paladin's class specific mount, The Charger, will be available at a later date.<br />
<p><br />
<br />
<a name = "n"></a><br />
<h3 class = "title">Wide Screen Support</h3><br />
<p><br />
Support for wide screen ratios (16:9, 16:10 and 5:4) have been added as a fullscreen choice.  The video options have been enhanced to list individual display resolution modes.  At this time, windowed mode will still be limited to a 4:3 ratio.<br />
<p><br />
<br />
<a name = "o"></a><br />
<h3 class = "title">Macintosh OS Upgrade</h3><br />
<p><br />
World of Warcraft beta testers using the Macintosh version will need to upgrade their OS to OS X 10.3.4 or World of Warcraft will not run.  OS X 10.3.4 is a free upgrade from any previous 10.3 releases and contains OpenGL drivers that are now necessary for World of Warcraft to operate on a Macintosh system.<br />

Far as I can tell, recipes are just something your character needs to possess to be able to make stuff.  A spoiler site might know and post what ingredients are needed to forge XYZ armor, and you might have them - but if your particular character hasn't bought or found the recipe - you can't make it.<br />
<br />
I'm sure all the recipes will be found and posted - but it won't help all that much - because by the time you can make the particular item, your character's already found the recipe in-game.  Seems like a fairly workable compromise between gameplay and verisimilitude.</div>

This is correct.  Recipes are one time things that you "scribe" into your tradeskill window.  Without the recipe, you can't make an item.</div>
