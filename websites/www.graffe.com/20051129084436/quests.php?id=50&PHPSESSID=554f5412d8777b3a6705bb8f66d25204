  Makil Rargon says 'Greetings. I am Makil Rargon, an esteemed assistant to the 
  great wizard [Al'Kabor]. What can I help you with?<br>

  <br>
  Makil Rargon says 'Al'Kabor is the most powerful wizard on all of Norrath. He 
  is currently back to his Combine Empire research. Being his most trusted 
  assistant, he assigned me to follow up on his fusibility [research] findings. 
  Do you have any information to offer?<br>
  <br>
  <b>You say, 'what research'</b><br>
  <br>
  Makil Rargon says 'Ah. Yes, his fusibility research. Al'Kabor has been 
  studying the melting point of minerals. Here. Take this journal. It explains 
  what fusibility is. Over the last few years, he has conducted several tests on 
  [fusible ores].<br>

            <br>
            By nature, most minerals have some point at which they can be 
            melted. In order to determine what that point is, fusibility tests 
            must be conducted. Being a master of the scientific art of wizardry, 
            I, of course, have mastered this process. When exposing a mineral 
            ore to a controlled amount of heat and other factors, it slowly 
            shrinks, forming a liquid base of particles.<br>
            <br>
            Over the last few years, I managed to collect several samples of ore 
            that produce a unique output when subjected to these fusibility 
            tests.<br>
            <br>
            My research continues...<br>

            Fusible Coral Ore:<br>
            <br>
            Back while unraveling the secrets behind the demise of the Kedge, I 
            confronted Phinigel Autropos, the last survivor of his kind. While 
            speaking with him and enduring his ill-tempered threats and warnings 
            toward me, I noticed coral-like ore on the reef of his domain. I 
            managed to collect a few samples of this fascinating mineral.<br>
            <br>
            This ore is composed of coral reef shells, another substance, not 
            yet defined, and is tightly compressed by the water of the Kedge 
            Keep.<br>
            <br>
            Fusible Earthen Ore:<br>
            <br>
            When those bumbling gnomes destroyed the Hatch releasing Yael and 
            Dartain, minerals from the Plane of the Underfoot dispersed outward 
            onto the surrounding area.<br>
            <br>
            This form of earthen ore is one of the hardest substances currently 
            existing on Norrath and is the source of the earthen golems and 
            elementals who lurk in the Hole.<br>
            <br>
            Fusible Igneous Ore:<br>
            <br>
            I spent many months researching upon the continent of Kunark. I came 
            across a unique form of lava in the Skyfire Mountains. These 
            mountains have several dorman volcanoes filled with lava waiting to 
            erupt. It was around one of these volcanoes where I found fusible 
            igneous ore.<br>
            <br>
            When volcanin lava cools it forms into a hard-form mineral. This 
            mineral is by far one of the hottest minerals on Norrath and 
            requires extreme heat to melt.<br>
            <br>
            Fusible Velium Ore:<br>
            <br>
            Although he is usually a bothersom individual, the dwarven warrior 
            Thubr Axebringer has assisted me with obtaining samples of velium 
            ore. He managed to find a few rare pieces of it in the Western 
            Wastes of Velious.<br>
            <br>
            Velium ore is the most unique ore I have found so far. Its 
            composition relies heavily on the coldness of the area it is found. 
            The cooler the area, the more tightly compressed it si likely to be. 
            In addition, the more compressed the ore is, the greater the 
            likelihood of it being useful in spell research.<br>
            <br>
            My research continues...<br>
            <br>
            The four different ores spoken about in that book can be found in 
            the world -<br>
            <br>
            * Fusible Coral Ore - Found by killing Phinigel Autroposs (L53 Fishy 
            WIZ) from within Kedge Keep. For a short while, this component was 
            found on the ledge next to where you can find Phinigel. This is no 
            longer the case.<br>
            <br>
            * Fusible Earthen Ore - Found by killing Master Yael (L56 Earth 
            Elemental MAG) within the bottom of The Hole. For a short while, 
            this component was found on the ground where Master Yael roams. This 
            is no longer the case.<br>
            <br>
            * Fusible Igneous Ore - Found on the ground within Skyfire. The loc 
            is apporximately +900, -1500. Just South of a lava pool atop the rim 
            of a volcano.<br>
            <br>
            * Fusible Velium Ore - Found by killing Guardian Kozzalym (L53 Air 
            Elemental Class unknown) in Western Wastes.<br>

            This journal explains what he has been able to accomplish. He has 
            managed to create several magical items including an artifactual

            <p><font color="#CCCCCC">Part 3: The Experiments<br>
            <br>
            Continuing my research on the fusibility of the fusible coral, 
            earthen, igneous, and velium ores, I have conducted several 
            experiments. By mixing the velium ore with the other three, I 
            discovered quite an extraordinary magical compound. When cooled, the 
            velium caused the compound to expand and quickly harden - the 
            outcome, a product that is uniquely resistant to the elements.<br>
            <br>
            In order to make use of this newly created substance, I performed 
            the experiment again. This time, while reciting a few incantations 
            that I have been working on. I then quickly poured the compound into 
            a mold of a scepter while chilling it. With the power of the chilled 
            fusible ore compound and the spell incantation, I managed to create 
            quite an unusual scepter artifact.<br>
            <br>
            When held by a wizard of great power, not unlike myself of course, 
            the magical energy of the scepter flows throughout the mind 
            expanding the intelligence while providing a greater protection from 
            the elements.<br>
            <br>
            Needless to say, I would only entrust a most loyal assistant with 
            the safeguarding of such a powerful artifact.<br>
            <br>
            At this time, Makil Rargon is the only assistant whom I am sure I 
            can trust to continue on with my fusibility research. I have 
            authorized him to release my findings regarding this study to others 
            since I'm positive that only Makil Rargon and I, myself, can 
            duplicate the process.<br>
