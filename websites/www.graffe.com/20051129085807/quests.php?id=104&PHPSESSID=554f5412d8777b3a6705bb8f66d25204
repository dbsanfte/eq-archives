    This is the newbie erudite armor quest. You can find Barodreth inside Erudin 
    Palace. All components can be found in Erudin, Toxx Forest, and surrounding 
    zones.<br>
&nbsp;<hr>
    <p><b>You say, 'Hail, Barodreth Firefingers'</b><br>
    <br>
    Barodreth Firefingers says 'Greetings Gemdiver, are you a [young initiate] 
    of the Craft Keepers? If you are then I might have some great news for you. 
    We are currently in the process of training up all new recruits so this 
    might be your lucky day. '</p>
    <p><b>You say, 'I am a young initiate.'</b><br>
    <br>
    Barodreth Firefingers says 'Excellent Gemdiver. Many have passed before me 
    and said they wished to be the greatest practicioner of the arcane to ever 
    set foot in these halls. Many of those same people didn't amount to much but 
    I think you are different. If you are [ready to begin your training] I will 
    be happy to get you started.'<br>
    <br>
    <b>You say, 'I am ready to begin my training.'</b><br>
    <br>
    Barodreth Firefingers says 'Fantastic, I will be delighted to get you 
    started. Toxxulia forest is where the majority of your training will be 
    held. There are many [important components] I will need you to [gather] out 
    in the forest and also in town.'<br>
    <br>
    <b>You say, 'I will gather important components.'</b><br>
    <br>
    Barodreth Firefingers says 'All right then Gemdiver, here is your Craft 
    Keepers Sewing Kit. In this sewing kit you will combine a number of recipes 
    that will be used for creating your Craft Keepers armor. When you are ready 
    to craft a certain armor piece all you must do is tell me which piece you 
    [want] to craft. I will then present you with the component recipe along 
    with the applicable pattern for Craft Keeper [Caps], [Bracers], [Sleeves], 
    [Sandals], [Trousers], [Gloves] and [Robes]. When you have completed the 
    material for whatever piece you asked for you will combine it in a sewing 
    kit with the appropriate pattern to fashion your armor piece. Its as easy as 
    that, I suggest though that you attempt your robe last as the components are 
    more difficult then any other piece to collect.'<br>
    <br>
    <b>You say, 'I want to craft a cap'<br>
    </b><br>
    Barodreth Firefingers says 'To create your cap material you will need to 
    combine 2 Woven Spider Silks, 1 Rat Ear, 1 Spiderling Legs and 1 Short Ale 
    in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a 
    sewing kit along with this pattern to fashion your very own Cap of the Craft 
    Keeper.'</p>
