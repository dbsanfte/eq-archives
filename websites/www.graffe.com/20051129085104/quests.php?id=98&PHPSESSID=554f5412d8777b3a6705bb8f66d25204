<HR>
Ethoach Trokith says 'Good day, Kati. It would appear you have learned much about the art of stealth already, and this is good. Are you ready to learn more? If so, listen closely. To graduate to the next level of precision and cunning, you need to discover a few items. Bring forth a Blizzard Gem, a Symbol of the Diaku, a Blue Diamond, and your Intermediate Stealth Manual. I feel this will be an adequate test of your skill at this stage in your development. Good luck!'
<HR>
Blizzard Gems can be found in the east wing of Torden, Bastion of Thunder.<BR>
a Symbol of the Diaku can be found off the various Diaku in Plane of Tactics.<BR>
a Blue Diamond drops from many mobs throughout Norrath, or can be purchased from players.

Hand in your Blizzard Gem, a Symbol of the Diaku, a Blue Diamond and your <a href="http://www.graffe.com/quests.php?id=90">Intermediate Stealth Manual</a> to recieve your advanced combat manual.
