  <p align="center">The main quest is given by Emperor Ganak (-2740, +2845) in 
  Trakanon's Teeth (this is the same NPC that gives the Sebilis key quest), but 
  it involves several subquests.</p>

  <hr noshade>

      <p align="left">The subquests are the quests for the medallions of Jarsath, 
      Obulus, and Kylong. Each of the 3 medallions consists of 3 pieces each (9 
      medallion pieces + the tooth = 10 piece total quest for the key). Once you 
      have all 3 medallions you simply hand them in along with one of Trakanon's 
      fangs to get your Key of Veeshan.</p>
  <p><i><b>NOTE</b>: You can not use the tooth dropped off the named trakaraptor 
  in Trakanon's Teeth, it must be from the actual poison dragon Trakanon in 
  Sebilis.</i></p>
  <p><i><b>Hint</b>: If you get the medallion pieces mixed up in your inventory, 
  just cast identify on yourself while the pieces are on your cursor and it will 
  give you the name of the segment your holding.</i></p>

  <p><b>Medallion of Jarsath ::.</b><br>
  This quest is given by Xiblin Fizzlebik (-5777, +2943) in Timorous Deep, like 
  each of the medallions, there are 3 pieces you must return to him for the 
  Medallion of Jasarth. By the way, this is the "easy" medallion. :)</p>
  <p>The first portion is located in Firiona Vie and is dropped off the ancient 
  Jarsath. The ancient is a level 40 Iksar skeleton monk (4000 HP) that spawns 
  very close to the mouth of the drolvarg temple at +647, -2097 and roams down 
  the hill to the nearby drolvarg camp then across the road a bit and back. I 
  suggest killing all non-drolvarg NPCs in this area (which there are very few) 
  to get him to spawn, and from what I could deduct the placeholder is a leech 
  that wanders in this area (Note: this does not mean he necessarily does have a 
  PH, it may just be a long spawn but this is what it appeared to be like). Also 
  he is the only undead mob in the whole zone (at the time this was written, 
  assuming they don't add any), so sense the dead works great if you have it. 
  Approximate time it took me: 2 hours.<br>
 </p>
  <p>The next piece is on the blood gill marauder at the bottom of Lake of Ill 
  Omen at -376, -52. He is a static non-roaming lake goblin with 2 lesser 
  guards, level 35-39, and the marauder himself is level 40 (3000 HP). He hits 
  around the 90s, guards hit in the 70s. His spawn point is a few feet inside 
  the "entrance" to the underwater temple here (so bring your fishbone, local 
  enduring breath caster, or potions), even though it ends in a dead end (Note: 
  this is the future site of the zone-in for the pending underwater dungeon). 
  Approximate time it took me: 5 hours, but I left and came back once or twice 
  and likely missed his spawn, I have returned twice since and he was already up 
  both times.</p>
  <p>The last piece is incredibly easy, it's just a bag sitting on the ground in 
  the Swamp of No Hope at +52, +2935, there are no dangerous NPCs in the area. 
  The exact respawn time of the bag is unknown to me, but reasonable. 
  Approximate time: However long it takes you to run to the Swamp.</p>
  <hr align="left" width="200" noShade>
  <p><b>Medallion of Obulus ::.</b><br>
  Slixin Klex (-681, -1127) in Burning Woods holds the quest for this one.</p>
  <p>This is one of the more agonizing pieces, requiring you to kill the pained 
  soul in Trakanon's Teeth. The pained soul has a single spawn, static, Iksar 
  spectre placeholder at -1835, -4368, which is pretty close to the ramp that 
  leads down to the Sebilis bubble. He is about level 44 and hits for over 100 
  and his placeholder spawns every 8.5 minutes exactly. Approximate time: It 
  took me 6 hours, and from what I have heard it typically ranges from 4-10 
  hours for him to show up.</p>
  <p>The next portion is from Dreadlands, dropped off a rotting skeleton. The 
  rotting skeleton has a single, static, non-roaming placeholder that spawns at 
  +2246, -5113 which is up on the ledge above one of the spider intensive areas 
  here. As you are exiting the Frontier Mountains zone, hug the wall left and 
  stay up farily high on it to find him. The spot has a quick (7 minute exactly) 
  respawn, but he is somewhat uncommon, and is level 43 (5000 HP). Approximate 
  time it took me: 2 hours.</p>
  <p>The final medallion piece for this quest has its own subquest from Ssolet 
  Dnaas (+4010, +396) in Warslilks Woods. Contrary to the guide on AllaKhazam's 
  site (which is what I tried to do the quest with, but lacks a ton of critical 
  information), you can't kill him for the piece or hand him the burnished 
  wooden staff from Chardok, handing him the staff is your only option. The 
  staff is a random drop on any mob in Chardok (45-60 zone), and drops quite 
  frequently (6 dropping in one night of hunting is not uncommon). The only 
  problem is he is on some type of Iksar faction (not Legion of Cabilis because 
  I am warmly to them) which most non-Iksars are KOS to. Unless you somehow have 
  good enough faction with him to receive the quest, you have to bring along an 
  enchanter or bard to charm him, he is level 50 and very buggy (ie he won't 
  even leave his spawn point if agro'd). Once he is charmed simply hand him the 
  staff to get your medallion piece. Approximate time: Minimal hours of Chardok 
  hunting + however long it takes you to find an enchanter and take them to 
  Warslilks Woods. </p>
  <hr align="left" width="200" noShade>
  <p><b>Medallion of Kylong ::.</b><br>
  This is the last and in my opinion hardest medallion. The quest is offered by 
  Professor Akabo (-2540, -2994) in Lake of Ill Omen. NOTE: The professor cons 
  dubious to most people, but will still give you the medallion as long as he 
  offers you the quest.</p>
  <p>Chardok: There is a subquest in Chardok given by the NPC ratman Niblek for 
  the first piece. He requires you to bring him a Black Sapphire and a Ruby (I 
  buy rubies in Highpass) for his medallion segment. View
  <a href="http://www.graffe.com/graffe1.0/quests/veeshans_peak_key/chardok_map.gif" target="_blank">
  this map</a> and note that the gold section is where you would be entering the 
  tunnel from. However, the directions to his area are simple, and he doesn't 
  roam. As you run up the ramp to the exit a bit and turn around, look to the 
  left of the castle and you'll see a ledge that leads to a tunnel. You need 
  levitate to get up here, and either a group to clear the way or invis (Note: 
  invis works great here on all the mobs in this tunnel except chodikai "dog" 
  models which there can be none or several in the path, up to you if you want 
  to risk it, I did). Follow the tunnel down until the first fork which is 
  Y-shaped and take a right, at the second fork which is T-shaped take a left, 
  and a right again at the 3rd and last fork which is also T-shaped and just hug 
  the wall right. Once you start seeing ratmen slaves (around the 3rd fork) you 
  are pretty much safe from harmful NPCs except the slaves themselves which are 
  like level negative 10. (aka if you actually die to these slaves solo or not 
  you have no business in Veeshan's Peak :P) Niblek is indifferent to everyone 
  as far as I know, simply hand him the 2 gems for your piece and you are set. 
  Approximate time it took me: 15-20 minutes, I got seen by a dog once and had 
  to gate, rest, and try again (but thats not counting getting gems, I already 
  had a black sapphire when I decided to do the quest). </p>
  <p>Kaesora: Now to the dungeon of Kaesora. There is a piece sitting on the 
  ground on the 2nd floor of the library here, click
  <a href="http://www.graffe.com/graffe1.0/quests/veeshans_peak_key/kaesora_map.jpg" target="_blank">
  here</a> for a map. Kaesora is a low (30ish) level zone and you will need both 
  regular invis and invis vs. undead to get down here if you really don't want 
  to be seen, but the majority of the MOBs in the way are undead (the spiders 
  are live). The "respawn" on this piece is 2 hours, 10 minutes. Approximate 
  time: 5 minutes if the medallion segment is up to 2 hours 10 minutes if you 
  just missed it.</p>
  <p>Karnor's Castle: This is the hardest section of all save the tooth from 
  Trakanon in my personal opinion. It is located in Karnor's Castle on Verix 
  Kyloxs remains. He is a level 51 shaman Iksar skeleton, and a fairly rare 
  spawn. Verix spawns in the sewers. Enter sewer from moat, when you rise out of 
  the water take a right and then the next right (if you take either of the 
  lefts you come across additional water spots). You'll be in a room with a 
  staircase on your right-ish and two adjacent rooms on your left. First left 
  room has 3 skeleton pops, next room has 4ish skeletons and Verix or his ph. 
  Verix is a shaman and he summons.</p>
  <p>The placeholder is the "decayed kylong", who spawns every 20-30 minutes. 
  This particular area of Karnor's is a great place to farm since you can pull 
  turnkeys and skeletal caretakers here. Approximate time it took me: 5-6 hours, 
  it varies.. but the hard part is getting a group competant enough to hold the 
  area for a while. </p>
