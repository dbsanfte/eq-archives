			<b>Doctors say looking at busty women for ten minutes a day is good for your health</b><br /><br />    <a href="http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/by-date/09-07-2011" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> 9 Jul 2011 00:00 </a>       Staring at busty women can lengthen your life, scientists have proved.<br />

     <br />
      Staring at busty women can lengthen your life, scientists have proved.<br />
 A German study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine,  concludes that staring at women's breasts for a few minutes daily is  better for your health than going to the gym.<br />
 &quot;Just 10 minutes of looking at the charms of well-endowed females is  equivalent to a 30-minute aerobics work-out,&quot; said author Dr Karen  Weatherby, an expert on ageing.<br />
 The research team, led by Dr Weatherby, spent five years monitoring the effects of this unique discovery.<br />
 The men who were told to stare at bosoms daily had lower blood  pressure and slower resting pulse rates and also decreased their risk of  coronary artery disease.<br />
 Dr Weatherby explained: &quot;Sexual excitement gets the heart pumping and improves blood circulation.<br />
 &quot;There's no question - gazing at large breasts makes men healthier.&quot;<br />
 She also recommends that men over 40 should spend at least 10 minutes daily admiring breasts sized D-cup or larger.<br />
<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>It's been going on for decades now, an entirely one-sided attack on America by the people in the .1% income bracket and their servants in the 1% income bracket.  Now that we're noticing these things, and that America has lagged far behind the rest of the Western Nations in improving our social contracts, these people who have been waging war on you for decades are now squalling like bee-stung babies about the &quot;class warfare&quot; inherent in things such as healthcare reform and whenever the idea of allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire for the upper income brackets is discussed.  <br />
 <br />
If you still require more proof that this is so, if you are still carrying water for the Right, then tell me, have you got about 5 miles handy to properly display a chart of the income disparity in the USA right now?<br />

			Charles Cooper, the attorney arguing on behalf of gay marriage  opponents, said marriage between a man and a woman is in the best  interest of society because only such a union could lead to “responsible  procreation.” Since gay couples do not have the biological capacity to  produce children together, the equal protection clause under the  constitution does not apply to them, he argued.<br />

<br />
Interesting return to the fundamental argument that conservatives have made in the past.  This is an easy argument to shoot down in specific example but if the court decides that it's a &quot;rational basis&quot; for making marriage between a man and a woman, then the case is over.  <br />
<br />
This is the &quot;go for broke&quot; argument for the conservatives.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I finally broke down and subscribed to netflix.  Not sure how long it will last.  I watched this movie, <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_Game:_The_Movie" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Indie Game: The Movie</a></i>, released last year.  I searched the archives and didn't find any discussion of it, but my brain is fried from not sleeping last night so I might have missed it.  Anyway this is a good movie.  Highly recommended.<br />
<br />
The format is a standard documentary, reminiscent of <i>The Dungeon Masters</i> but far more sympathetic to the subjects.  They use interviews with and video footage of the designers and programmers to construct narratives about the creation and release of several Indie Games, specifically <i>Super Meat Boy</i>, <i>Fez</i>, and <i>Braid</i>.  The sections on <i>Braid</i>, which was released in 2008, are more of a reflection, while the target for <i>Meat Boy</i> is X-Box live release day and <i>Fez</i> is a playable demo at PaxEast.<br />
<br />
The movie touches on the talents of the creators, their sacrifices, hard work, various difficulties and setbacks as well as their successes and high points.  There is plenty of discussion of and reflection on design philosophies and creative motivations, though it never gets too technical.  It ranges from Edmund McMillen's bizarre artistic mind to Jonathan Blow's concise description about the fundamental differences between independent games and studio games.  Each creator also spends a significant amount of time discussing the motivations, ideas, and concepts related to the particular game, both in terms of artistic expression and gameplay experience.<br />
<br />
Without spoiling too much I have to say my favorite part was probably watching the creators watch the reactions of people actually playing the games.</div>

    CINCINNATI (AP) — A shadow of a different kind is hanging over Punxsutawney Phil.<br />
 <br />
  Authorities in still-frigid Ohio have issued  an ‘‘indictment’’ against the famed groundhog, who predicted an early  spring when he didn’t see his shadow after emerging from his lair in  western Pennsylvania on Feb. 2.<br />
 <br />
  Spring arrived Wednesday, and temperatures are  still hovering in the 30s in the Buckeye state and much of the  Northeast. While it’s not the coldest spring on record, it’s a good 5  degrees below normal, said Don Hughes, a meteorologist with the National  Weather Service in Wilmington, Ohio.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>My google-fu is failing me, so I figured I'd ask here.<br />
<br />
years ago, I bought a television with a sort of extender for the remote controls. The idea was to hide all the equipment in a cabinet, and put this cable it came with (a daisy chain of about 3 IR lights) and plug one end into the televiison, and the 3 ends right in front of the IR sensor of whatever was in your console cabinet. <br />
<br />
Then, if you wanted to adjust the volume on the RECEIVER, you could point at the television, and it would automatically send the same signal to the daisy chain IR lights, and it would hit inside the hidden receiver in the cabinet. <br />
<br />
Simple concept, nothing amazing, but I've been wanting to set this up with my cabinets so that I don't have to point the remote in that sweet spot for what is hidden behind the glass in the cabinet the are all in.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone know what sort of product I'm talking about? what is its real name? Has the technology advanced to something better? (I don't want to pay a tremendous amount for a smart remote... Yes, they are better technology, but I don't want the expense). Just looking for that key-word, to find such a similar simple product on amazon or ebay and order it direct from china for 2 bux. <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div>

			An incident at the annual Python developer conference has led to allegations of sexism, death threats, the firings of two people, and—apparently—multiple DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attacks.<br />
<br />
The strange saga began Sunday at the PyCon event in Santa Clara, CA, when Adria Richards, a developer evangelist for e-mail vendor SendGrid, overheard jokes being told by two developers sitting behind her during a session. The jokes were sexual in nature, she said. Richards proceeded to take a picture of the developers, then tweeted the photo and asked PyCon organizers to have a word with them.<br />
<br />
The story ended with one of the developers getting fired, Richards getting fired, and an apparent denial of service attack against Richard's personal blog and against SendGrid. &quot;Anonymous has reviewed the situation and rendered judgment using their collective wisdom and experience,&quot; wrote one anonymous poster in a manifesto. Could the story get any stranger?<br />
<br />
According to Richards' tweets and a personal blog post titled &quot;Forking and Dongle Jokes Don't Belong at Tech Conferences,&quot; the developers in question were sitting right behind her at PyCon and made &quot;jokes about forking repo's in a sexual way and 'big' dongles.&quot; (Richards herself apparently made a joke about male genitalia on Twitter, using her work account, several days before PyCon.)<br />
<br />
Richards did not tell the developers that she was offended, saying in the comments on her blog post, &quot;I didn't want to be heckled or have my experience denied.&quot; She initially decided to remain silent about the jokes, she wrote, until she saw up on the main stage a photo &quot;of a little girl who had been in the Young Coders workshop.&quot; At that moment, &quot;I realized I had to do something or she would never have the chance to learn and love programming because the ass clowns behind me would make it impossible for her to do so,&quot; she wrote.<br />
<br />
After tweeting the pictures of the developers, she then wrote on Twitter, &quot;Can someone talk to these guys about their conduct? I'm in lightning talks, top right near stage, 10 rows back #pycon.&quot; She also linked to PyCon's code of conduct, which says in part that &quot;offensive jokes are not appropriate for PyCon.&quot; On her blog, Richards concluded, &quot;Yesterday the future of programming was on the line and I made myself heard.&quot;<br />
<br />
PyCon staff quickly spoke to the developers, who apologized, but the staff took no further action. PyCon described its response in a blog post yesterday:<br />
<br />
On Sunday March 17th an incident occurred involving some inappropriate comments made during a crowded plenary session. Per the stated guidelines for attendees and staff, the issue was reported to the PyCon 2013 staff and resolved privately.<br />
<br />
Both parties were met with, in private. The comments that were made were in poor taste, and individuals involved agreed, apologized, and no further actions were taken by the staff of PyCon 2013. No individuals were removed from the conference, no sanctions were levied.<br />
<br />
PyCon values the privacy of all attendees above everything. Except in cases wherein law enforcement must or could be involved, all reports and actions taken are kept confidential by PyCon staff.<br />
After the incident, PyCon updated its &quot;Attendee Procedure for Handling Harassment&quot; to encourage conference attendees to report such behavior privately. &quot;Public shaming can be counter-productive to building a strong community. PyCon does not condone nor participate in such actions out of respect,&quot; the updated PyCon procedures say.<br />
<br />
One of the developers was also fired by his employer, PlayHaven, which said the inappropriate comments were contrary to the company's dedication to gender equality. PlayHaven makes a financial platform for monetizing mobile games.<br />
<br />
“Forking” and firings<br />
<br />
A person going under the Hacker News name &quot;mr-hank&quot; claimed that he was the developer who was fired. He apologized for the jokes but said Richards misinterpreted the &quot;forking&quot; statement. The developers were discussing the process of forking code bases, not making sexual jokes, he said. &quot;While I did make a big dongle joke about a fictional piece [of] hardware that identified as male, no sexual jokes were made about forking,&quot; he wrote, adding:<br />
<br />
She gave me no warning, she smiled while she snapped the pic and sealed my fate. Let this serve as a message to everyone, our actions and words, big or small, can have a serious impact. I will be at pycon 2014, I will joke and socialize with everyone but I will also be mindful of my audience, accidental or otherwise. Again, I apologize.<br />
The other developer making jokes, Alex Reid, was not fired.<br />
<br />
PlayHaven CEO Andy Yang acknowledged firing the developer, writing, &quot;PlayHaven had an employee who was identified as making inappropriate comments at PyCon, and as a company that is dedicated to gender equality and values honorable behavior, we conducted a thorough investigation. The result of this investigation led to the unfortunate outcome of having to let this employee go. We value and protect the privacy of our employees, both past and present, and we will not comment on all the factors that contributed to our parting ways... We believe in the importance of discussing sensitive topics such as gender and conduct and we hope to move forward with a civil dialogue based on the facts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richards' own blog was subsequently hit by a DDoS attack. VentureBeat also reports that Richards has been the target of rape and death threats on Twitter, although such tweets have apparently been deleted by Twitter.<br />
<br />
The SendGrid website has also been unresponsive much of the day. The company has not confirmed the cause, although it's assumed to be a DDoS attack. (Hacktivist group Anonymous is supposedly behind it.) &quot;Our SMTP and Web servers are currently down,&quot; SendGrid wrote in a status update. A few hours later, the company provided some good news: &quot;We're now accepting mail via SMTP &amp; Web API. The Website is up, and we're working to finalize this resolution.&quot; Business customers have complained about the outage impacting their operations.<br />
<br />
Today, SendGrid fired Richards. In a Facebook post, SendGrid wrote, &quot;Effective immediately, SendGrid has terminated the employment of Adria Richards. While we generally are sensitive and confidential with respect to employee matters, the situation has taken on a public nature. We have taken action that we believe is in the overall best interests of SendGrid, its employees, and our customers.&quot;<br />
<br />
A further post from SendGrid CEO Jim Franklin a few hours later expanded on the company's reasons for firing Richards. &quot;SendGrid supports the right to report inappropriate behavior, whenever and wherever it occurs,&quot; Franklin wrote. &quot;What we do not support was how she reported the conduct. Her decision to tweet the comments and photographs of the people who made the comments crossed the line. Publicly shaming the offenders—and bystanders—was not the appropriate way to handle the situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;A SendGrid developer evangelist’s responsibility is to build and strengthen our Developer Community across the globe. In light of the events over the last 48+ hours, it has become obvious that her actions have strongly divided the same community she was supposed to unite. As a result, she can no longer be effective in her role at SendGrid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Update: The original version of this story said Adria Richards found out about her firing on Facebook and left a comment on her employer's page threatening a lawsuit. It now appears that comment was written by an impostor, and not by the real Adria Richards.<br />
<br />
Update #2: Our editor-in-chief Ken Fisher weighs in on the controversy.

			STORY HIGHLIGHTS<br />
<ul><li style=""> Forced adoptions were widespread in Australia for decades</li><li style=""> They were often arranged for the babies of unwed mothers</li><li style=""> Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard delivers the apology</li></ul><br />
<br />
<br />
(CNN) -- <b>Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard offered an apology Thursday to the mothers, children and families affected by forced adoptions.<br />
 <br />
An untold number of unwed women in Australia were forced to give up their children for adoption over decades during the 20th century.</b><br />
 <br />
&quot;To you, the mothers -- who were betrayed by a system that gave you no choice and subjected you to manipulation, mistreatment and malpractice -- we apologize,&quot; said Gillard, speaking in the Great Hall of Parliament House in Canberra.<br />
 <br />
Addressing those ripped from their families, she said: &quot;To each of you who were adopted or removed, who were led to believe your mother had rejected you, and who were denied the opportunity to grow up with your family and community of origin, and to connect with your culture, we say sorry.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Gillard's comments came about a year after a Senate committee that investigated forced adoptions released its report, which included a recommendation for a national apology.<br />
 <br />
The report found that some mothers signed adoption papers while under the influence of medication. Others were not advised of government payments that may have been available to them.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Most common of all was the bullying arrogance of a society that presumed to know what was best,&quot; Gillard said.<br />
 <br />
The report estimated there were 140,000 to 150,000 adoptions between 1951 and 1975, and as many as 250,000 from 1940 onward. It determined it was impossible to say exactly how many of those were forced.<br />
 <br />
Gillard pledged support for families that continue to be affected by such adoptions, committing $5 million Australian to improving access to specialist support and records tracing.<br />
 <br />
&quot;We offer this apology in the hope that it will assist your healing and in order to shine a light on a dark period of our nation's history,&quot; she said.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So for the last year I've gone from not knowing even the alphabet to testing at a 2+/2+/2 at Listening/Reading/Speaking respectively. Didnt get the 3's I was hoping for but those are a pretty lofty goal within the scope of the course.  Here's a link to what those scales mean below. For reference a guy in my class with a bachelors degree in Russian Studies got a 1+/1+ before going through this class. <br />
<br />
Just thought I'd share with my friends cause I'm awfully proud of myself!<br />

			I have always been a big proponent of following your heart and doing exactly what you want to do. It sounds so simple, right? But there are people who spend years&#8212;decades, even&#8212;trying to find a true sense of purpose for themselves. My advice? Just find the thing you enjoy doing more than anything else, your one true passion, and do it for the rest of your life on nights and weekends when you&#8217;re exhausted and cranky and just want to go to bed.

			Say, for example, that your passion is painting. Well, what are you waiting for? Get out there and buy a canvas and some painting supplies! Go sign up for art classes! And when you get so overwhelmed with your job and your personal life that you barely have enough time to see your girlfriend or boyfriend or husband or wife, let alone do anything else, go ahead and skip classes for a few weeks. Then let those paint brushes sit in your room untouched for six months because a major work project came up and you had a bunch of weddings to go to and your kid got sick and money is tighter than you thought it would be and you have to work overtime. And then finally pick those brushes back up again only to realize you&#8217;re so rusty that you begin to question whether this was all a giant waste of time, whether you even want to paint anymore, and whether this was just some sort of immature little fantasy you had as a kid and that maybe it&#8217;s finally time to grow the fuck up, let painting go, and join the real world because, let&#8217;s face it, not everyone gets to live out their dreams.
