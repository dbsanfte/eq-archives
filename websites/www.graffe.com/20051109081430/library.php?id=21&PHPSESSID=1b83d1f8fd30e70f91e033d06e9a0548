I’m starting to see more “new” 65 wizards, wizard that are level 65 but perhaps went on the fast leveling track, they were twinks or had high level friends who helped power level them or perhaps they took over a friends character who retired from the game.  This guide is written for them, the wizard who is 65 but took an “accelerated” path and wants to learn more of the fine details.  Various level 65 wizards have asked me all of these questions.<br><br>

<b>What is a “right click buff”?</b> – On occasion you will encounter mobs that dispel.  Plane of Tactics in one such place this happens.  The preferred method to handle this is having an instant right click buff in your top buff slot.  Two example items that will do this are Eye of Innoruk and J-boots.  Now, with the “dummy” right click buff in your top slot, if that buff is dispelled, you can instantly click it back up.  This allows you to be dispelled repeatedly yet not sacrifice any of your real buffs nor waste any amount of time or mana replacing your dummy buff.<br><br>

<b>Does concussion really help?</b> – if you don’t have concussion, ancient greater concussion or right click concussion, do the quest now.  At 65 you should be able to solo the whole thing.  Concussion lowers agro.  Some say that even when the spell is resisted it lowers aggro.<br><br>

<b>How do I keep from dying in the Elemental planes other then not nuking at all?</b> – go draughts then.  Yes, the big boom spells are more fun, do better damage and are more mana efficient.  I love to use them myself whenever I can.  However, there are just times when you can’t.  If you find yourself dying repeatedly, switch to draught spells.  Your damage per mob will go down, at times drop dramatically but you life expectancy will go up.  There are three magic based draughts, Jiva, thunder and lightning.  Jiva and Thunder have a stun\interrupt component, while it can interrupt casters mobs, it also adds quite a bit of aggro to you.  Consider doing the quest for Draught of lighting which does not have the stun\interrupt and therefore a “less aggro” magic based draught.</br><br>

<b>What spell should I use? I keep getting resisted.</b> – Find your spells aren’t doing the damage they should?  First, if your casting fire or cold based spells, start using your staff of temporal flux.  If you don’t have on, do the quest now.  Its an easy quest at level 30.  You might find when you cast your SOTF that it does not take hold.  That’s ok, all that means is a druid or mage already debuffed the mob with a better spell.  if its resisted, just keep clicking away until your successful.  Still resisted? Try draught spells, they are your next best option.  Draughts have a –50 modifier to resists.  Still resisted?  Then go lure spells.  Sometimes lures are your best option.  They cast slower and are not as mana efficient but you are much more likely to land them.  Still resisted?  See next topic..<br><br>

<b>Which spell do I use? SoS keeps getting resisted.</b> When in Fire, use cold – To someone that always played a wizard, this seems basic, but it’s not always evident to the boxed wizard.   Fire spells will be resisted 100% in Sol Ro and Plane of Fire.  Cold spells will be resisted in Plane of Water.<br><br> 

<b>Which spell do I use? They all seem to work, whats best?</b> – In a situation where all your spells will land equally well, look at which focus items you have.  If you have a greater % focus on fire, factor that into your decision, if you have a greater % focus with cold or magic, factor that in.<br><br>

<b>What is Iceflame of Eci?</b> – Iceflame of Eci is a self buff.  It adds focus to level 60 cold based spells only.  At this time that is Ice Spear of the Soloist, Lure of Ice and Winds of Gheld.<br><br>

<b>Should I buy Manaburn? When is best to manaburn?</b> – Most of the time, manaburn is not an efficient strategy for a wizard to use.  Basically a manaburn is 3 SoS or 8-9 draughts.  If you find your summoned by a mob and near full mana about to die soonish, go ahead and burn.  Otherwise, use a spell parser and review the overall damage you do on named fights.  If you find your doing under 20K damage vs a named, its probably a good situation to manaburn in the future.<br><br>

<b>Which focus stack?</b> – As a general rule, you can have 1 spell buff focus, 1 bard song focus, 1 item focus and AA focus all stack with each other.  Item focus wont stack with Item focus, spell focus won’t stack with spell focus, but spell, item, birdsong and AA focus will all stack with each other.<br><br>

<b>How do you kite a mob that can’t be snared?</b>  –  Kiting is all about distance and building distance.  Snare is simply a tool to make that easier.  SoE is another tool to make that easier.  So long as you move faster then the mob, the possibility to kite exists.  Room to run must also be taken into consideration.  You need the space to build up the distance.  If you wanted to look at it as a formula, it would be something like:  When to nuke = Seconds spell takes cast * (Distance you run in a second – Distance mob runs in a second)<br><br>

<b>Do I really need a horse or Drogmar?</b>  It’s a huge help in outdoor zones.  You get sitting mana regen while on a horse standing still.  There are two benefits to this.  You can cast spell while gaining sitting mana regen and you can med without sitting aggro.<br><br>

<b>I have the evacuate spell, do I need the AA?</b> The AA is practically instant.  It allows you to explore new areas and take more risks because if you get in trouble, a way out is just a click away.<br>
