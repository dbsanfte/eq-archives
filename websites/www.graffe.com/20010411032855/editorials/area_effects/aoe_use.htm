      <P>Ok, first off let's identify the problem with the player base. It's a 
        single MoB world out there and that's how everyone wants it cause that 
        means the party isn't taking as much damage. Mez, stun, whatever it takes 
        to reduce the amount of MoB's the party has to deal with cause it's a 
        1 dimensional world out there in Norrath. Why is it so 1 dimensional? 
        I've heard many explanations to the way things are and the one I absolutely 
        have to throw out the window is Efficiency. It is not more efficient to 
        tackle a group of multiple MoB's and take them down 1 by 1 in almost every 
        instance. There are instances where single mob tactics are required or 
        recommended due to grouping, type of camps, and special situations. AE's 
        are not meant to be used in every situation however, with proper planning 
        and a good knowledge on how the spells work they can be used in just about 
        every group you join. This writing is just to get you started down the 
        path with hopefully less deaths and to encourage you to explore that unused 
        spell line.</P>
      <P>So now you see the real challenge. Not how to use AE's but how to change 
        the mindset of the player base. And that may well be your toughest part 
        of this yet. Old habits die hard this is true of anything and probably 
        more so in EQ. </P>
      <P>There are 3 types of AE's so let's describe them:</P>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><b><u>Personal Based</u></b> - These AE's radiate out from the caster, 
          which requires the caster to be within Melee range or pretty close. 
          Due to the latest patch the radius of the PB's has been increased dramatically 
          making them even better. You can target a MoB or a friend and this spell 
          will work. This is my personal favorite due to the fact that there is 
          not a MoB limit. You can hit as many as you can fit into the blast radius. 
          I will more than likely be spending more time on this series than the 
          others due to their friendliness to group game play provided there is 
          an Enchanter in your midst. I still use this line even without an Enchanter 
          in the group but then again I'm a mad man.</p>
        <p><b><u>Distance AE</u></b> - These AE's have the range of your usual 
          DD spells and radiate out from the target, whether that be a MoB or 
          you target one of your Tanks. You want to be out of the blast radius 
          for these spells cause they will damage the caster too. Extreme caution 
          should be used with these spells in a dungeon cause they have a very 
          large radius when cast. The MoB limit for these spells is 4 in almost 
          every case. When casting this various line use them like you would a 
          DD spell. Assist the tank and make sure you're hitting the same MoB. 
          The only difference I would suggest is to let the tank get in 125% of 
          your damage, cause with AE's taunt does not really apply to the extra 
          MoB's and the Aggro of the extra MoB's is based off the main MoB that 
          the party is attacking. </p>
        <p><b><u>AE Rains</u></b> - Much like the Distance AE in range and target 
          however, this spell has a pulse type effect in that it will rain up 
          to 3 separate DD's centered around the area that the target was at when 
          cast. If the targets move out of the Rain they take no damage from any 
          pulses after the first. The MoB limit for these spells is also 4 and 
          not every time will there be 3 pulses (Dungeons usually have more 2 
          pulse rains in my experience). This line is diluted IMO and therefor 
          of less use. The more targets the less pulses and the more diluted the 
          damage (this may have changed I'll need to play with them some more 
          sometime and possibly re-evaluate them). Being in the area of this spell 
          line will also hurt the caster.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>First I'll take the easy route and talk about grouping with an Enchanter. 
        Enchanters get stuck on the Mez series. It's what everyone hollers for 
        when they get an over pull and it's reinforced in the Enchanters mind 
        cause they're good at it. If the MoB's resist the first Mez the Enchanter 
        pops off a Color Flux or the equivalent level AE stun and Mez again. Mez 
        has its place but not in a group with a good Wizard. Enchanters get an 
        AE stun at level 4, 20, and 44. They stun for 3, 7, and 12 seconds respectively. 
        In 12 seconds I can get off almost 4 PB AE's doing 1998 damage using Thunder 
        Clap and Cast Force (not the best setup but it allows me to chain cast 
        quite well) this is only on 3 MoB's so it's 666 pts of damage per MoB. 
        For 646 pts of Mana. Crunching the numbers to do about the same damage 
        with Conflag would cost 750 Mana but since the numbers just get better 
        with the more MoB's you add using AE's the Wizard comes into his own. 
        Want some numbers? 8 MoB's 1 hit of TC does 1856 damage for 175 mana , 
        all Mob's were Greater Kobolds and Solusek Kobolds with Shamans and their 
        pets. I got an e-mail from someone who got 15 MoB's with SuperNova but 
        we can all crunch numbers so let me move on. </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>More numbers from the Enchanters world:</p>
        <p>Color Flux level 4 25 mana 3 secs<br>
          Color Shift level 20 40 mana 7 secs <br>
          Color Skew level 44 60 mana 12 secs <br>
        </p>
        <p>Mesmerisation level 16 70 mana <br>
          Dazzle level 49 125 mana </p>
        <p>Seems to me an Enchanter can probably stun for a long time just by 
          looking at the cost of the stun spells. Heck the stuns are cheaper than 
          the Mez line, cast faster, and don't have the aggro potential of the 
          Mez line. <b><a href="#editorsnote">1*</a></b> </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>At the<font size="-1"> end of casting AE's from both the Wizard and the 
        Enchanter usually the Wizard is taking the damage so the Enchanter can 
        get off another stun. Rarely is this a problem since the Enchanter is 
        chain casting. There might be a MoB or 2 that resists but they usually 
        get stunned on the next try. Most of the time if I have the time (which 
        isn't often) I make sure</font> I start with Steel Skin up. Even in a 
        train situation with an Enchanter laying down stuns I lost 2 bubbles of 
        health or less during the whole fight. As far as clerics wasting Mana 
        on the Wizards I guess it doesn't matter if I'm the only one they're having 
        to heal to a great degree and with most of the MoB's stunned damage to 
        the casters isn't as bad as when a tank is going toe to toe with a MoB. 
        Caution should still be used when pulling MoB's to the group. I have used 
        this in the bug group in SolB which has level 40+ mobs in it but I don't 
        suggest pulling 10 sonic bats and trying this tactic unless the Enchanter 
        has an extremely high magic resistance (Sonic Bats have a stun spell). 
        Common sense will always play a part in AE use, it helps to be familiar 
        with what's around when you start using them</p>
      <p>This tactic with an Enchanter is great however, you must present this 
        to the group ahead of time and they must ALL have a warm fuzzy. Believe 
        me if the healer isn't ready for this and panics, it will be a short-lived 
        event for the Wizard and Enchanter as they see the healer running for 
        the zone. So always make sure the entire group is ready for what you are 
        about to do. This will vary greatly on the amount of MoB's you have to 
        fight. I have successfully in a party taken down 5 MoB's without an Enchanter 
        (our Enchanter was AFK and the puller didn't know, can you say oops?) 
        however this was very difficult and the healer was working over time. 
        As with any situation you can still over pull using this method. Pull 
        enough MoB's and all's it takes is 3 or 4 out of say 20 to not be stunned 
        and things can go bad (Myztic can tell you all about that).</p>
      <p>Now we'll talk about a tank heavy group. Of course you can't burn as 
        fast and as hard here which should be obvious. You're gonna be limited 
        in a few ways so let me talk about expected variations. MoB level, tank 
        level, amount of MoB's, and types of tanks will all affect your ability 
        to use AE's. If you're tanks are relatively low level in comparison to 
        the MoB's (Ex. Would be high level 30 tanks instead of Mid to upper 40 
        tanks in King group in SolB, or if the tanks are not at least a few levels 
        higher than the MoB's you are fighting) I'd suggest not using AE's cause 
        your tanks won't be getting any MoB off you through either killing it 
        or taunting it. Good taunting classes for AE use are Warriors, Paladins, 
        and SK's but you should always get a feel for what a group can do before 
        you go throwing down AE's. A common tactic for me to test the waters is 
        to wait until the first MoB, in say a 3 MoB pull, is close to dead (30% 
        or less in health) step in and lay down 2 AE's killing that MoB. 2 MoB's 
        aren't too difficult for 3-4 tanks to pull off a caster. If they do a 
        good job taunting you'll be able to get more AE's off but you really have 
        to be careful using your PB's. Columns are a little different. Use them 
        like you would DD's assisting the puller or Main tank but let the lead 
        tank get in 125% of the damage of the AE you plan to use. Verant has lowered 
        the aggro of AE's in that the extra MoB's won't immediately jump a caster 
        as long as they don't pull the primary targeted MoB away from the Tanks. 
        As a caster you will not always see this due to the fact that the tanks 
        can taunt the MoB they are on but this taunt does not apply to the extra 
        MoB's so you will have to be extra cautious in these situations.</p>
      <p>The higher the MoB's in level, the more there are other things you will 
        have to worry about but I'm just trying to get you started and not hand 
        you the game at this point.</p>
      <p>The use of AE's is a matter of preference plain and simple. But AE's 
        cannot be ignored when comparing damage from class to class. DD stands 
        for Direct Damage and AE's are nothing but a Subclass of the Direct Damage 
        spell line (with the exception of Rains which is in a way a visible DoT). 
        When you use a column on 4 MoB's you are doing Direct Damage to those 
        4 Mobs'.</p>
      <p>In retrospect, how long did it take to get used to using DD's in a group 
        setting? When to cast and when not to cast? How long to wait before you 
        could drop your big DD? I still know Wizards who DD until they're OOM 
        or the MoB is dead expecting the tanks to taunt off them, quite often 
        running in a circle screaming "Get it off me, get it off me!!" . These 
        are people I place on my do not group with list. These are people that 
        need to learn the game. It takes finesse and learning to be able to use 
        the AE line of spells correctly. One thing I want to stress is this writing 
        does not license Wizards to run down into SolB and expect to kill Fire 
        Giants with AE's. High level MoB's that have a natural high resistance 
        to certain types of magic should be handled accordingly. </p>
      <p>While this does open the road seldom traveled by Wizards and definitely 
        increases the power of our class, if used correctly, it also increases 
        the value of grouping. Even with good tactics we still need other classes 
        to be our most effective. Dropping all those MoB's fairly fast is all 
        well and fine until they start walking off cause you're waiting for a 
        spell to refresh. That's why it takes a good group of tanks and casters. 
        Rangers snare, Paladins, SK's and Warriors taunt, Monks and Rogues are 
        damage machines, you will still need healers, and who's gonna pull? </p>
      <p>If you've never used AE spells successfully before start out small. You 
        have to find your limits before going all out. Last thing I want is a 
        bunch of Wizards running around killing themselves or their groups cause 
        the first time they wanted to try these tactics they over did it. This 
        has been something that I've worked on for many levels and many deaths 
        and it doesn't come easy. I don't use AE's all the time and everywhere 
        but I always have at least one loaded (2 dd's and an AE almost always). 
        It takes time to learn where and when to use them but once you start you'll 
        find yourself using them more and more as you get comfortable with the 
        item and more players get comfortable with this play style. </p>
      <p>There will be tons of questions, complaints, and generally other things 
        to consider. I will be updating this page as they come to me. First thing 
        I ask is for you to think out your questions, sometimes you'll find the 
        answers yourself. A lot of times with tactics we need to research the 
        other classes and see what compliments our own line of spells or how we 
        can compliment another class. </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><b><a name="editorsnote"></a>1* Editors note</b>: These spells are 
          listed with these values but through experience and from a good enchanter 
          friend of mine these duration's are not entirely correct. An enchanter 
          can however chain cast the level 20 and 44 spells with less than a round 
          in between refresh</p>
