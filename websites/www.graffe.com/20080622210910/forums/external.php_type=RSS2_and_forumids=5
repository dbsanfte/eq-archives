If you did the tutorial thing and have a new character you can easily use your kobold skull charm thing for the augment... I'm guessing an older character shouldn't have a problem. <br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I know that its frowned upon posting this here and I apologize. I couldn't find another place for this and we need some wizards in a big way! If you need to tank the post I will understand.<br />
<br />
=====================<br />
Descendents is a well-established, experienced raiding guild originating from the Mithaniel Marr server and presently resides on the Saryrn server. Our primary raid focus is Solteris. We are always interested in adding talented and dedicated players to our roster. The typical Descendents member is an experienced and skilled Everquest gamer, who also leads an active and rich personal and professional life. We appeal to players who choose to raid on a Pacific time frame, and who can not or do not wish to make the sacrifices needed to raid five or six days a week. We raid three nights a week and expect to stay current with end-game content. Limiting our raid schedule means that we require total commitment from all members toward our goals. Because of these choices, our members are mature and established individuals, both in Everquest and out. We require and recruit not only exceptional playing skills and knowledge, but also outstanding character and personality. If you feel that this describes you, and you find our raid times fit your schedule, please take a look at our guild and see if you might find a place with us. We are very anxious to work with those who embrace our values and goals.<br />
<br />
Raid Schedule: Tuesday/Thursday: 7pm-11pm PST, Sunday: 6pm-11pm PST<br />
Guild Website: <a href="http://www.descendentsguild.org" target="_blank">www.descendentsguild.org</a><br />
Forums: <a href="http://www.descendentsguild.org/forums" target="_blank">www.descendentsguild.org/forums</a><br />
<br />
Guild Leader: Rolalron<br />
Officers: Larknos, Peavi, Simi<br />
Recruiters: Fatbuk, Peavi, Sympx</div>

<br />
That being said, most posts that deal with equipment are a bit old and outdated hence the new post.<br />
<br />
I need suggestions for damage foci on the big three (magic, cold, fire) that work from 75 to 80. I have some very good foci now but they work up to 72 (they don't decay after 72 they just stop working)<br />
<br />
I'm on the FV server so any piece of equipment or aug is attainable for the most part.<br />
<br />
So any ideas on damage foci? 45% or higher?<br />

Thank you very much!<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Disclaimer: I am specifically posting this without looking to see if there have been other threads on this, simply based on the activity of this board (any thread that does exist is likely several months old, and the game/economy changes.<br />
<br />
So I'm curious to know what some cheap bazaar attainable upgrades would be for my wizard.  I figure if I've got two months of free play time thanks to SOE, I'll try to give it a go again.  I quit back in 2004, and most of my stuff is a hodgepodge of single group attainable stuff from then.  I have a few raid items, but nothing serious.<br />
<br />
I claimed the armor/weapon from the living legacy thing, and the three armor pieces increased my INT by 10 and my Mana and HP by roughly 400-500.  The weapon increases mana/hp further, but I'd lose my detrimental spell haste if I equip it...<br />
<br />
<a href="http://eq.magelo.com/profile/1395736" target="_blank">http://eq.magelo.com/profile/1395736</a> &lt;--that's the magelo I just made, it's roughly accurate.<br />
<br />
Beyond that, any tips on spells to get/use/etc would be awesome.</div>

It's been a while.  I was thinking today, for you, when was the Golden Age of EQ?  What expansion or period?<br />
<br />
For me was after Kunark was released.  The game was polished further after this point but there was an excitement then that was maybe the high point of my MMO enjoyment.  The first Iksars migrating across the old world of the game.  Rumors of dragons/wurms wiping out entire guilds of lvl 50 characters in Skyfire Mountains. :)<br />
<br />
However, a close second was the period after the SoL was released.  The AA system for me was a need breath of fresh air for high level players.</div>

<br />
What should I do? Should I just use my pillar spell to quad still I get to 71? I have been using the Ice Meteor for awhile and I always hope i can do better than 2460 dmg. Sigh, finally dinged 65 but seems like no spell upgrades for me?<br />
<br />
I have never played any caster up to this level so please bear with me. Thank you very much in advance. <br />
<br />
BTW, I am planning to quad kite in Blackfeather roost, hopefully my pillar spell will last me awhile. I have 0 AA which means very little crit so i guess I will not be able to impress other player with my 2460 dmg spell with no crit..:(</div>
