<p align="center">This quest is started by talking to <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('solomen.jpg','solomen','width=177,height=409')">Solomen</a> 
  within the <a href="../../maps/_temple_of_solusek_ro.jpg" target="_blank">Temple 
  of Solusek Ro</a>. Solomen is a human wizard located on the left portion of 
  the temple, third floor, between the two undead knights, one room away from 
  Lord Seafire. The end result of the quest is not known, but it is thought to 
  be a blunt sceptre type weapon with fantastic stats as well as unique particle 
  effects when held. This is the mother of all wizard quests.</p>
<hr noshade>
<p>You say, 'hail Solomen'</p>
<p> Solomen says 'Ah, I see you have found my study. This is where I study and 
  scribe the history of magic in Norrath.</p>
<p>You say, 'what history?'</p>
<p>Solomen says 'I have worked to chronicle everything from the beginnings of 
  magic to what we consider the modern day of magic. Solusek Ro has been very 
  generous to those who wield magic in Norrath. But throughout history there is 
  one thing I have noticed - too much power corrupts the soul. I have seen and 
  documented that the strongest wizards and those closest to Solusek Ro become 
  corrupted by their power.</p>
<p>You say, 'what wizards?'</p>
<p>Solomen says 'Unfortunately, I don't have time to speak of such things right 
  now. But I could use your help since you are here. I have here an envelope that 
  I need delivered to one Camin Rah. You can find Camin in the wizard tower in 
  the city of Erudin. He is a sage like myself whose knowledge rivals my own. 
  Do you [agree] to undertake my task? </p>
<p>You say, 'I agree.'</p>
<p>Solomen says 'Here you are, then. Good luck on your journey.</p>
<hr noshade>
<p>Solomen hands you a <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('solomen_note.jpg','solomennote','width=406,height=327')">note</a> 
  that you must give to Camin. Now the real quest begins!</p>

<p><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('camin.jpg','camin','width=193,height=467')">Camin</a> 
  can be found at the Vasty Deep Inn within Erudin. To find him inside the Inn, 
  open the front door to the Inn and go up the stairs on your right. Follow the 
  hallway around the second floor and Camin is found behind the first door upon 
  your left. Off the bat, he is normally indifferent or apprehensive to everyone. 
  Hand him the note that was given to you by Soloman and you will receive positive 
  TrueSpirit faction. <i>(Note: Since the patch on 10/03/00, you can no longer 
  keep handing Camin the note and gain faction.. it has been nerfed)</i></p>
<p>Camin will now reply with -</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Camin says</b>, 'So you have met Solomen, eh? He is a man with a wealth 
    of knowledge. It is good to hear he is well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now hail Camin and he will respond with this -</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Camin says</b> 'Go away! I have no time for you! </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this happens, you can continue with the quest. <i>(Note: Since the patch 
  on 10/03/00, you can no longer keep handing Camin the note and gain faction.. 
  it has been nerfed)</i>. </p>
<p align="left">If you have good faction already, you can talk to Camin: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>you say</b>, 'What are you searching for?'<b><br>
    Camin says</b> 'Ah! A smart one, I see! If you really wish to know about such 
    a thing, you will have to help me finance my studies. The knowledge I have 
    acquired and researched did not come cheaply.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">At this point, hand Camin 1000 platinum and the quest will continue. 
  Some have even reported this as working while being apprehensive to him <i>(confirmed 
  you must do this part of the quest or the next part will result in &quot;I do 
  not do business with your kind.&quot;)</i>. Doing this will make Camin reply 
  with:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Camin says</b>, 'Good, good, you show a willingness to learn of this with 
    your offer. What I can tell you is that Solusek Ro had four followers who 
    had shown exceptional aptitude in the arts of wizardry. Solusek Ro himself 
    tutored them. He considered them to be like his own children. I know of one 
    who still exists. He goes by the name of Arantir Karondor. He used to specialize 
    in the storing of magic into physical objects. Arantir has been hiding for 
    many, many years and will most assuredly be going by another name, so keep 
    your eyes open. Anyway, be off, I need to continue my research. Return to 
    me if you ever find Arantir Karondor.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="dargon"></a></p>
<p>Now to find Arantir Karondor. I honestly have no idea what Verant was thinking 
  when they did this part of the quest. There are <i>zero</i> clues as to who 
  or where this person is and honestly, it's sort of disturbing to me that every 
  other class' quest is straightforward, but still has a very good degree of difficulty. 
  None the less, there is a female NPC vendor in Halas named '<a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('dargon.jpg','dargon','width=149,height=363')">Dargon</a>' 
  that sells a potion called <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('ros_breath.jpg','rosbreath','width=330,height=145')">Ro's 
  Breath</a>. She is located in front of the Shaman guild. Purchase this potion 
  from Dargon for the sum of about 900pp to 1100pp depending on your faction and 
  charisma. <i>(**evil races be warned - you ARE KOS to surrounding NPC's. See 
  <a href="halas.htm">this page</a> for Halas Guard and Vendor info**)</i>. There 
  is also three other known vendors in the world that sell Ro's Breath -</p>
<ul>
  <li>Female Barbarian, Marlyn McMerin (loc -3825, +1665), who is found on the 
    dock shops in Fironia Vie.</li>
  <li>Female Iksar shaman vendor, <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('klok_scaleroot.jpg','klokscaleroot','width=220,height=418')">Klok 
    Scaleroot</a> in West Cabilis. </li>
  <li>Female coldain dwarf, Hudda, who is found within the bank inside the city 
    of Thurgadin.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can buy Ro's Breath from any of these vendors but you cannot return it 
  to them. Neither of them will turn into Arantir. However, it is confirmed that 
  you can buy Ro's Breath them, take it to Camin to be stripped of it's charge, 
  and then take it to Dargon. Handing this potion to Dargon in Halas will make 
  her turn into Arantir and the quest will continue.</p>
<p><a name="caminpotion"></a></p>
<p>Now take this potion back to Camin in Erudin and hand it to him. He will reply 
  with the following:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Camin says</b> 'Very interesting... I've seen this work before. Yes, yes! 
    It's the work of Arantir Karondor! Give this back to the person you got it 
    from. Maybe he will have a clue to Arantir's location.' </p>
  <p>Your faction standing with Truespirit got better<br>
    You gain experience!!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Camin gives you back the potion (it has now been stripped of it's Shield of 
  Lava charge) and you must take it back to Dargon in Halas.<br>
  <i>Note: you cannot skip the previous trip to Camin. You absolutely, must hand 
  the potion to Camin. If you try to skip the trip to Erudin, you will get the 
  following message from Dargon: "I didnt request this item, but thank you very 
  much".</i></p>
<p><a name="dargonpotion"></a></p>
<p>Back in Halas, hand the Ro's Breath potion back to Dargon. She will turn into 
  blue robe adorned, <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('arantir.jpg','arantir','width=208,height=480')">Arantir 
  Karondor</a> and reply with:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Dargon says</b> 'So, I've been discovered! You must know Camin - he is 
    one of the only people who could have recognized my work. I have worked very 
    hard to mask my presence here.' </p>
  <p><b>You say</b>, 'hail Arantir Karondor' <br>
    <b>Arantir Karondor says</b> 'Before I tell you anything, I require you to 
    help me. Seek a woman named Challice. Give her this letter and then return 
    to me.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="challice"></a></p>
<p>The letter that Arantir hands you is actually a ring called <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('arantir_ring.jpg','','width=330,height=145')">Arantir's 
  Ring</a>. Identifying it reveals: "Item Lore: My love has no bounds." <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('challice.jpg','challice','width=195,height=388')">Challice</a> 
  is found in the basement of the Felwithe paladin guild. Once you hand Challice 
  the ring, she will reply with:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Challice says</b> 'Oh yes? Arantir? What a fool he was! the man gave me 
    everything, but for all his intelligence, he could never understand why I 
    was truly with him. It was for his power; he could do anything. But when he 
    mysteriously lost it, he became just another toy. I never loved him. Return 
    this ring to him. He will understand that I have no desire to see him again.' 
  </p>
  <p>Your faction standing with Truespirit got better<br>
    You gain experience!!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="returnring"></a></p>
<p>This new ring, when indentified reads: "Item Lore: I never could love a man 
  like you." Take this ring back to Dargon/Arantir in Halas and hand it over. 
  <i>NOTE: When this quest was first introduced, you had to respawn Arantir by 
  handing Dargon another potion. The quest has been fixed to definitely make Arantir 
  spawn once you hand the ring to Dargon.</i> Once you spawn Arantir, then you 
  must hail Arantir to get his attention and go through the following dialogue:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>you say</b>, 'Hail Arantir Karondor!'<br>
    <b>Arantir Karondor says</b> 'Ah, but it pains my heart to see this. How I 
    could love a women like that is beyond me. And yet, I still do love her. It 
    was on the day I was to ask her to marry me that I lost my powers. When I 
    was about to cast my greatest spell to prove my love to her, my magic failed. 
    She ran out on me that day. But enough of me, do you wish to hear my story?' 
  </p>
  <p><b>you say</b>, 'I wish to hear your story.'<b><br>
    Arantir Karondor says</b> 'I once was one of four true followers of Solusek 
    Ro. So great were the four of us that Solusek Ro himself made us each a special 
    item. We did not know what the others' items were, but we realized that was 
    for our own safety. Each one of us, after receiving the item, began to plot 
    against Solusek Ro. Each of us believed we had enough power to dominate Norrath. 
    Solusek Ro saw this and at the time we needed our powers most, he stripped 
    us of them. Now I know two of the other wizards by name. One was called Sylen 
    Tyrn, the other's name was Demunir Scry. The last wizard was a gnome, but 
    I can't think of his name.</p>
  <p><b>you say</b>, 'What about Sylen Tyrn?'<br>
    <b>Arantir Karondor says</b> 'Sylen was a high elf wizard, and like many high 
    elves, he believed himself to be better than others. Because of his birth, 
    he thought he was more noble and more intelligent than anyone else. I heard 
    how met his demise - while flying over a vast area of water, his powers were 
    stripped from him in midflight. He fell and was captured by a rival wizard 
    who specialized in magics of the water. Search for that wizard and you could 
    find a trace of Sylen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 'trace' of Sylen Tyrn is found off of Phiningel Autropos deep in Kedge 
  Keep - the <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('../../weapons/1h_blunt/blue_crystal_staff.jpg','bluecrystalstaff','width=330,height=145')">Blue 
  Crystal Staff</a>. When this item is identified, the power of Solusek Ro radiates 
  from within.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>you say</b>, 'What about Demunir Scry?'<br>
    <b>Arantir Karondor says</b> 'Demunir was a human in a rush for power. He 
    was extremely intelligent and resourceful but, unfortunately, was more interested 
    in destructive magic. Hearing of an ancient land, he immediately traveled 
    to it, believing there to be powerful relics left undiscovered there. While 
    exploring, he came upon a dwelling that housed a powerful warrior. Believing 
    himself to be more powerful, he attempted to take this dwelling for himself. 
    While in battle with this warrior, Solusek Ro stole his powers and left him 
    helpless. It is said that Demunir's item is the warrior's most prized trophy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Demunir item is the <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('../../weapons/1h_blunt/gnarled_staff.jpg','gnarledstaff','width=330,height=145')">Gnarled 
  Staff</a> found off of Venril Sathir from within Karnor's Castle.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>you say</b>, 'What about the gnome?'<br>
    <i>if he doesn't reply, say the following..</i><br>
    <b>you say</b>, 'Who is the gnome?'<br>
    <b>Arantir Karondor says</b> 'Ah, the gnome I know very little about. I know 
    he was small and crafty, and that he had a brother. His brother's craft was 
    that of making fireworks, and he was the unfortunate victim of one of his 
    own experiments. His firework exploded, leaving his mind diminished in capacity, 
    even for a gnome. I remember others calling him 'Old Stewpot' in jest. I do 
    not know if this is his birth name, but it may help you to locate him. I hear 
    he also stays close to water because of the explosion. You never know when 
    another gnomish invention will go awry. Give him this letter to help motivate 
    him to remember. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="kandin1"></a></p>
<p>The gnome is <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('kandin_firepot.jpg','kandinfirepot','width=145,height=259')">Kandin 
  Firepot</a>. Kandin can be found in the Southwest region of ButcherBlock Mountains 
  (-1500 +2800) near the ocean. You can hand him the note (when identified it 
  reads - &quot;This item appears to be written in Common Tongue. Item Lore: What 
  is lost must be found.&quot;) from Arantir and he will give you the text below:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Kandin Firepot says</b> 'Brother! I have one of those. He's great, but 
    he's dead. His name was Gabstik and he was a really powerful wizard. I still 
    have one of his greatest possesions! You look like you could use it. I've 
    added another thing to my shopping list. I require a dry brittle skin that 
    I can mold or a rare oil found in the planes that I can soak the fuse in. 
    Get me one of these things and I'll trade it for my bother's stick.'</p>
  <p>Your faction standing with Truespirit got better</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">You can do this part of the quest two ways now but it is easier 
  to do it the new way (thank you Verant for realizing our epic quest was nearly 
  impossible).</p>
<p align="left"><a name="cazicsskin"></a></p>
<p align="left"><b>THE FIRST WAY</b> (the old way and the hard way). Do not attempt 
  to do the quest this way anymore. -</p>
<p align="left">If you have happen to have <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('cazics_skin.jpg','CazicSkin','width=330,height=145')">Cazic's 
  Skin</a> from Cazic Thule in Fear (some may have the skin from before the patch), 
  you can hand it to Kandin and he will reply with the following -</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Kandin Firepot says</b> 'Great! This is? What is this for again? Oh yeah, 
    the casing for my firework. Here, you can have this then, oh no, wait. You 
    can't yet. I forgot I needed another part to my firework, and you are exactly 
    the person to get it for me! I need some mistletoe powder. Now, go find some 
    for me! Go, go, go, go! Shoo! Oh, wait! Hold on to my bag for me, please. 
    You can give it back after you've given me what I want.</p>
  <p>Your faction standing with Truespirit got better</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">At this point, Kandin Firepot will give you '<a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('kandins_bag.jpg','kandinsbag','width=330,height=145')">Kandin's 
  Bag</a>'. When identified, the bag comes up with: Item Lore: Warning - Explosive!". 
  Although it is a bag, it <u>cannot</u> be opened. Don't worry about this, continue 
  with the quest.</p>
<p>The <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('mistletoe_powder.jpg','mistletoepowder','width=330,height=145')">mistletoe 
  powder</a> is found within Old Sebilis upon Tolapmulj. Once you have the powder, 
  return to Kandin and hand <u>only</u> the powder to him. Upon handing Kandin 
  the mistletoe powder, he will return to you the <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('../../weapons/1h_blunt/staff_of_gabstik.jpg','staffofgabstik','width=330,height=145')">Staff 
  of Gabstik</a>. Once he hands you the staff he asks for his bag back. Hand him

<p><a name="brokengolem"></a></p>
<p><b>THE SECOND WAY</b> (the new way) -</p>
<p align="left">If you hail Kandin instead of handing him the skin, the following 
  is what will happen -</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>You say</b>, 'hail Kandin Firepot'</p>
  <p><b>Kandin Firepot says</b> 'Hello, there! Don't have time to talk. I'm workin', 
    workin', workin'! Careful! Don't slip in the oil! <br>

  <p><b>You say</b>, 'what oil?'<br>
  </p>
  <p><b>Kandin Firepot says</b> 'Ah the oil! I recently sent a specially crafted 
    golem to explore through a huge portal to another plane. It's instructions 
    were to collect special oil that I suspect existed in the plane. What I think 
    is the golem broke down. This looks like a good task for one like you. Go

  <p><b>You say</b>, 'hail Arantir Karondor' </p>
  <p><b>Arantir Karondor says</b> 'Ah yes, you again. Do you have the items? Give 
    me the three you possess and I'll combine them with my own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point, hand Arantir all three staves, the Blue Crystal Staff, the Gnarled 
  Staff, and the Staff of Gabstik. <i>IMPORTANT: Be sure to have an empty slot 
  open in your MAIN inventory before you hand over the 3 staves. That or have 
  a container that can hold a 'giant' item.</i></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Arantir Karondor says</b> 'Here, this pack contains all of our items. 
    You will never be able to open it again, so you must deliver the pack, intact, 
    to Solomen. He will then reward you. Now that I have helped you, leave me 
    in peace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="solomenspack"></a></p>
<p>Now you must go back to <b>Solomen in the Temple of Solusek Ro</b> (not Camin!) 
  and hand him this pack. Upon doing so will result in getting the epic item, 
  Staff of the Four.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Solomen says</b> 'You actually did it! I never would have thought that 
    anyone could have truly followed this path. This is a tribute to your intelligence 
    and patience. Here, take this staff and know that you have made Solusek Ro 
    and all the wizards of the world proud this day. </p>
  <p>Your faction standing with Truespirit got better<br>
