<br><ul>           Heh.. that got your attention, aye? These spells have not been found.            They are not on vendors and they are not dropping from mobs. They are            in the spell data for the live servers and all this means is that if            someone was to find one, it could be cast. Why are they not found on            the live servers? Reason has it that the spells are still being modified            with a 'verification box' over on the Test Server.

Please note that only Rangers and Druids will be able to              trigger the spawn for the skeletal remains, and those remains will              only be dropping items for those epic quests. Hopefully these changes              will dramatically reduce the competition and resentment over this              spawn.</li>           <li>We have reduced resistances to some spell types on some NPCs in              Sky Shrine and the Tower of Frozen Shadow.

This is a real pain for soloing wizards that depend            heavily on this spell to reduce downtime. This icon needs to stay greyed            out till it is actually ready to use again and not be affected by right            clickable items.            <p> <b>Answer - We will look into that</b>            <p> Temperate Flux Staff - The text mesages in chat for the staff's              effect is not always received properly. There seems to be a dead spot              for this staff where you do not get any effect messages back from              the mob. If you are way out of range you will receive a message stating              "you are out of range" that and if you keep reducing the distance              to the mob you will eventually come to the point where you sometimes              get no messages, if you close the distance even more you will then              start receiving messages stating that the mob is either uncomfortable              or the mob has resisted the lower element spell. This is not a big              deal if the mob is snared and chasing you but if it is not snared              and you want to try to debuff it before you try to snare it again,              can prove to be a little tricky. I wish the staff would either state              you are out of range or one of the other two messages " the mob is              uncomfortable" or the "the mob has resisted the lower element spell".              Even though elevation does make this worse it can happen in a totally              flat area.            <p> <b>Answer - We wil look into that</b>"          </blockquote>         <p></p>         <br><br><i>Thanks Jaqe!</i><br><br>-Graffe</ul></div>

So far she is doing a wonderful job and we are very            lucky to have her on the crew. So if you feel so inclined, give her            props in the forums or drop her an e-mail at <a href="mailto:fastasia@graffe.com">fastasia@graffe.com</a>.</p>         <br><br><i>Sorry Xarpolis and Arbaal.. one more person just got            added to the 'shiny blue title' list. *grin*</i><br><br>-Graffe</ul></div>

This is something that was talked about in class            discussion. Well, there answer was a very fast and sharp no.." </blockquote>         Neme also commented that there was a very low number of people representing          wizards at the faire.          <p></p>         <br><br><i>Thanks for the info Neme!</i><br><br>-Graffe</ul></div>

<br><ul>           Dynamite Shortfuze of Fennin Ro sent in info about a Wizard Faire that            is going to be held on Fennin Ro later this month -<br>         </p>         <blockquote>            <p>Hail good wizards of Norrath!</p>           <p>I come before you today with news of <b>Fennin Ro's</b> first ever              Wizard Faire! In months past, I have hosted a Rune Trade on Fennin              Ro, and the time has come to expand upon this, with a huge faire...              for wizards!</p>           <p>I'm hoping that this can be held on the <b>28th of April</b>. I know,              it's very early to discuss this, and I don't even know myself if I              will be available, but I've been getting pressure to start announcing              it (especially from Omnip, who is possibly the Faire's biggest supporter).              Let me explain how it works...</p>           <p>Before, at the rune faires, wizards of all levels would come together.              We would discuss life and have fun (the Ol'Tujim's Fierce Brew helped              with that I'm sure), but most prominently, we would trade runes. If              you needed a rune, you would ask if anyone had it, and you would likely              receive it. Conversely, if you had a rune someone else needed, you              would offer it to them. Higher level wizards were on hand to assist              lower levels in the research of their spells, and fun was had by all.</p>           <p>No changes are being made to that. We're just expanding on it. This              month, we will have contests, games, duels, the rune trade, and above              all, fun!</p>           <p>I would like to offer prizes of cash and items for this event, but              as this is an independant project and not one of any guild with a              large support base, my income restricts this from being much good.              I can offer prizes just fine, they just won't be good in many respects.              So much so that prizes would probably have just as much impact if              they weren't present. However, if you have any donations of items              or cash that you would like to put forward to this, please contact              me in-game and let me know. I won't ask that you give it to me until              the event (since I can't guaruntee my presence just yet), but I would              like to know that these things are available so I can plan ahead with              them in mind. If you can't get to me in-game, please contact me at              <a href="mailto:fenninrunes@hotmail.com">fenninrunes@hotmail.com</a></p>         </blockquote>         <blockquote>            <p>Also, I am just one wizard, and in past trades, I have had JUST enough              alcohol to please the masses. So if you'd like to bring some of your              own brew for all to sample, please, I wholeheartedly encourage it!</p>           <p>We have a few games in mind, and Omnip has some that she won't tell              me about (she says it's a surprise and she'll post it on the boards              herself), but we can only get better with help. So, if you've got              an idea for a game, again, contact me with the procedure and rules              at <a href="mailto:fenninrunes@hotmail.com">fenninrunes@hotmail.com</a></p>           <p>I'm really looking forward to this month, I expect it's going to              be the best we've had yet! I hope to see you there!<br>           </p>         </blockquote>         <p>I noticed a thread on the General Forum started on this.. if you have            any questions, you can e-mail <a href="mailto:fenninrunes@hotmail.com">Dynamite</a>            or visit the thread <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=2557.topic">here</a>.</p>         <br><br>-Graffe</ul></div>
