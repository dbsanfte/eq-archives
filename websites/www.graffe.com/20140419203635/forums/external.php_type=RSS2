The US government does not represent the interests of the majority of the country's citizens, but is instead ruled by those of the rich and powerful, a new study from Princeton and Northwestern Universities has concluded. <br />
<br />
<br />
The report, entitled Testing Theories of American Politics: Elites, Interest Groups, and Average Citizens, used extensive policy data collected from between the years of 1981 and 2002 to empirically determine the state of the US political system. <br />
<br />
<br />
After sifting through nearly 1,800 US policies enacted in that period and comparing them to the expressed preferences of average Americans (50th percentile of income), affluent Americans (90th percentile) and large special interests groups, researchers concluded that the United States is dominated by its economic elite. <br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
The peer-reviewed study, which will be taught at these universities in September, says: &quot;The central point that emerges from our research is that economic elites and organised groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on US government policy, while mass-based interest groups and average citizens have little or no independent influence.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
Researchers concluded that US government policies rarely align with the the preferences of the majority of Americans, but do favour special interests and lobbying organisations: &quot;When a majority of citizens disagrees with economic elites and/or with organised interests, they generally lose. Moreover, because of the strong status quo bias built into the US political system, even when fairly large majorities of Americans favour policy change, they generally do not get it.&quot; <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
The positions of powerful interest groups are &quot;not substantially correlated with the preferences of average citizens&quot;, but the politics of average Americans and affluent Americans sometimes does overlap. This is merely a coincidence, the report says, with the the interests of the average American being served almost exclusively when it also serves those of the richest 10 per cent. <br />
<br />
The theory of &quot;biased pluralism&quot; that the Princeton and Northwestern researchers believe the US system fits holds that policy outcomes &quot;tend to tilt towards the wishes of corporations and business and professional associations.&quot; <br />
<br />
The study comes in the wake of McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, a controversial Supreme Court decision which allows wealthy donors to contribute to an unlimited number of political campaigns. <br />

			ST. LOUIS (AP) - After he was convicted of armed robbery in 2000, Cornealious Anderson was sentenced to 13 years behind bars and told to await instructions on when and where to report to prison. But those instructions never came.<br />
<br />
So Anderson didn't report. He spent the next 13 years turning his life around - getting married, raising three kids, learning a trade. He made no effort to conceal his identity or whereabouts. Anderson paid taxes and traffic tickets, renewed his driver's license and registered his businesses.<br />
<br />
Not until last year did the Missouri Department of Corrections discover the clerical error that kept him free. Now he's fighting for release, saying authorities missed their chance to incarcerate him.

I work among a great majority of right wingers, so whenever the &quot;gubbermint&quot; goes infringing on people's rights, I'm the first to hear about it. Most of my research only came up with this video: Pretty cool, at about 44 seconds in, a dude gets bolt-tazed not once, not twice, not thrice but FOUR times, and each time, yanks them out. THEN he even kicks the police dog, who further has nothing to do with him. <br />

From what I understand, this guy who owns the Bundy Ranch in Nevada also was found to own the only lands that some threatened to near extinction species of tortoise also inhabits. So the BLM is stepping in and taking cattle... who knows what else. I don't know the exact details, because everything seems a little sketchy. <br />

			For the first time in history, scientists have successfully implanted lab-grown vaginal organs in human patients.<br />
<br />
The organs, grown with the patients’ own tissue, were implanted between June 2005 and October 2008 in four teenage girls who each lacked or had an underdeveloped vagina and uterus, the result of a rare genetic condition called Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome.<br />
<br />
Years after the two-hour procedures, annual follow-up visits showed that the surgeries had been a success: The new organs functioned normally, including during sex, and their tissue was indistinguishable from the native tissue that had already been there.

			BOSTON (CBS) – A Wakefield man was ordered held on $100,000 bail Wednesday on several charges connected to a bomb scare at the finish line of the Boston Marathon Tuesday, hours after memorial tributes there.<br />
<br />
Kevin Edson, 25, who also goes by the name Kayvon Edson, is charged with possession or use of a hoax device and making a false bomb threat.  If convicted, those carry up to five and up to 20 years in state prison, respectively, according to Jake Wark, the spokesman for Suffolk County District Attorney Dan Conley.<br />
<br />
Edson, who also has an address in Mission Hill, is also charged with disturbing the peace, disorderly conduct, and disturbing a public assembly.  All are misdemeanors carrying minimal jail time or a fine.<br />
<br />
He pleaded not guilty at his arraignment in Boston Municipal Court.<br />
<br />
Edson, according to police and witnesses, was barefoot, wearing blue and yellow face paint and a long black veil while screaming “Boston Strong” in the middle of Boylston Street at 6:50 p.m. Tuesday.  It was a short time after the city marked the first anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombings.<br />
<br />
At the time, the area was open to the public, but the street was still closed to traffic.<br />
<br />
When Edson was stopped by officers, police say he told them he had a rice cooker in his backpack. That’s when the area was evacuated, the bomb squad was called in and Edson was arrested. Bus and subway service was also suspended.<br />
<br />
The bag was detonated as a precaution.<br />
<br />
A source told CBS News that the rice cooker in the bag was full of confetti.<br />
<br />
A court psychologist said Wednesday that Edson has a history of psychiatric problems, but he has been off his medication for months.<br />
<br />
Edson’s family elaborated on that in a statement issued Wednesday afternoon.<br />
<br />
Prosecutor Susan Terrey said Edson told police he knew what he was doing, calling the incident “performance art.” Edson is a student at Massachusetts College of Art and Design in Boston.<br />
<br />
He was sent to Bridgewater State Hospital for a psychiatric evaluation and is due back in court May 7.<br />
<br />
“If this was a performance, it was the most irresponsible, senseless, and selfish performance I can imagine,” Conley said in a statement Wednesday afternoon.<br />
<br />
“It was also criminal. It was akin to shouting ‘fire’ in a theater. People were put in fear, public transportation was disrupted, and a day of somber remembrance and reflection was marred by this defendant’s choices. There could not have been a worse time or place for this inexcusable behavior.”<br />
<br />
Edson’s brother TJ posted this message on Facebook after the incident:<br />

			I ask for those of you who know my family to take a moment to pray for myself, my sister, my mother, and my father. My dad is an American Hero. The kind of man you hate to see on his last legs sick with cancer. But that is the reality. It is stressful enough as it is.<br />
<br />
Another reality is that my brother is a different kind of sick. What he did at the finish line earlier today is absurd and shameful. It should not be considered art or condoned in any way. <br />
<br />
Do not play into that. He is a sick person with multiple diagnoses. Unfortunately, no consequences of his abnormal behavior were dire enough for him to shape up before he thought something like this could get him that fame he always chased. Ultimately, he is a disillusioned and very sick individual. I apologize to anyone that takes offense to his actions as his brother. <br />
<br />
My family has done all we can to foster Kevin’s mental health. He is an artist. I am an artist. I understand that much. Thank you God that he did not hurt anybody.

			DETROIT (WWJ) – A new study finds low levels of the “sunshine vitamin” could be keeping some people on the couch.<br />
<br />
Vitamin D may make the difference between an active and a more sedentary lifestyle among severely obese people, according to research out Ireland.<br />
<br />
Researchers found severely obese people who were also vitamin D-deficient walked more slowly and were less active overall than their counterparts who had healthy vitamin D levels.<br />
<br />
The study, published in the Endocrine Society’s Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism (JCEM),  measured physical functioning and vitamin D levels in about 250 severely obese people.<br />
<br />
Researchers found the group with the highest vitamin D levels had the fastest walking times and highest amount of self-reported physical activity.<br />
 This group also had the lowest average BMI of study volunteers.<br />
<br />
One of the study’s authors, Tomás Ahern of St. Columcille’s Hospital and St. Vincent’s University Hospital in Dublin, said the severely obese are already eight times more likely to have poor physical function than people with a healthy BMI.<br />
<br />
“Improving vitamin D status should improve quality of life and may decrease the risk of early death in people with severe obesity,” Ahern said, in a media release. “This could be a simple matter of spending more time outside, since sun exposure can boost the body’s natural vitamin D production.”<br />
<br />
A person whose body mass index exceeds 40 is considered severely obese.  According to the study’s authors, about 6.5 of American adults are in this category.
