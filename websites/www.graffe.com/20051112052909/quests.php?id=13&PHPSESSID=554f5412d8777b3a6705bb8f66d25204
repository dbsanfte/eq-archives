  <p align="left">Goto Skyshrine and travel up through the maze until you come 
  to the room with two Wurms in it, Lawya (for Hsagra's Wrath Quest) and Ralgyn
  <i>(picture needed)</i>. Hail Ralgyn.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>You say, 'Hail Ralgyn'</p>
    <p>Ralgyn says 'Hello Rombus , what brings you to these sacred quarters on 
    this day? If it is treasure that you seek please ask someone else for I do 
    not have time to think of such petty things. My worries are much greater at 
    this time I am afraid. </p>
    <p>You say, 'what are your worries?'</p>
    <p>Ralgyn says 'Well I suppose I can tell you of my promise if you are 
    willing to listen as I do not feel you have intentions of using anything I 
    tell you against my dragonkin. Not many can walk these quarters unless they 
    are very trusted amongst us. </p>
    <p>You say, 'what was your promise?'</p>
    <p>Ralgyn says 'I made a promise a very long time ago to my wingmate Faliana, 
    a promise that I feel I may have broken. </p>
    <p>You say, 'how was your promise broken?'</p>
    <p>Ralgyn says 'I promised my dear Faliana that I would always keep her 
    talisman close to me. If something has happened to my son I must retain his 
    talisman so that I may keep Faliana's Talisman secure, as I promised her I 
    always would. Before she perished she split her talisman into two pieces one 
    of which I always will carry and the other half which my son Glanitar 
    carries. My son has not returned to me for some time and I am deeply 
    concerned for this is not normal behavior for him. I fear something must 
    have happened to him for he has never been so involved in his training to 
    not inform me of his whereabouts or to not come visit. </p>
    <p>You say, 'what was his training?'</p>
    <p>Ralgyn says 'It seems like it was only yesterday that my only son 
    Glanitar was practicing his skills as a young Wurm. Before long he quickly 
    mastered many fighting skills and the development of his magical skills 
    rapidly progressed. He was coming along so well in his training that he was 
    quickly drafted for the Patrol. Even when he was away for his training he 
    would often return to me and tell me of his progress. I was very proud of 
    him for his involvement with the Patrol. Although I am very proud of his 
    accomplishments, I have not seen him for longer then I have ever been away 
    from him and I fear for the worst. </p>
    <p>You say, 'what is the patrol?'</p>
    <p>Ralgyn says 'Ah yes, the patrol. Well in the Great Divide there is a 
    collection of caves that the dragonkind holds as a sacred territory. For 
    this reason we always have a number of our strongest up and coming younger 
    ones train there with the great [Kardakor]. They patrol the caved labyrinth 
    to make sure it is free from unwanted intruders who are quickly dealt with 
    upon discovery. </p>
    <p>You say, 'who is kardakor?'</p>
    <p>Ralgyn says 'Kardakor is a strong and powerful Warrior. He has fought in 
    many battles against the vile Giants and is well respected amongst our 
    people as a champion. For this reason when one was needed to train our young 
    fighters seeking guidance in developing both their magical and fighting 
    techniques it was clear to us who we should select for this honor, Kardakor.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now, head to Great Divide and seek out Kardakor <i>(picture needed)</i>. 
  He's located in the wurm caves to the right of the area where the Guardian 
  Wurms live. There is a KoS wurm next to him but I was able to complete this 
  part without agroing the wurm.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>You say, 'Hail Kardakor'</p>
    <p>Kardakor says 'Hello Rombus . It is not very often that I see adventurers 
    back in this cave unless they have intentions of hurting the kind wurms 
    here. I can only hope that for your sake that your intentions are good. </p>
    <p>You say, 'i am looking for glanitar'</p>
    <p>Kardakor says 'Glanitar? It has been quite long sense I have seen 
    Glanitar, I fear that something unfortunate has become of him. It is not 
    like him at all to be away for this long. He was out on normal patrol with a 
    few others when they disappeared. We have not heard from any of them. </p>
    <p>You say, 'where did they disappear?'</p>
    <p>Kardakor says 'This, I do not know. There are a few Giant forces that I 
    have heard word of moving into the area. It is tough to say where they could 
    have gone and if something happened to them or not who would be to blame. I 
    highly doubt the Coldain would dare attack one of our units. The last I 
    heard of them was when they left for the patrol of the Divide; this could 
    have been anywhere. I remember that Glanitar carries a talisman from his 
    mother. If you are to find any sign of Glanitar or any of the others please 
    come to me first along with something that would symbolize who you received 
    or took it from.' </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>From here get a group of 12, 55+ people or one good group of 60s. Find 
  Taskmaster Aboytt<i> (picture needed)</i> (you should get a tracker if 
  possible, he's located near the wurm caves) and kill him. A Shaman can slow 
  him (his MR is very, very low) and once he is slowed, he's easy. The 
  Taskmaster cons yellow to a 60, but doesn't hit that hard. Once he dies he 
  drops a sword (not needed for the quest), a piece of a talisman <i>(picture 
  needed)</i>, and a head <i>(picture needed)</i>. Take the head and the 
  talisman back to Kardakor. He gives you the talisman back. Now, seek out 
  Rolandal <i>(picture &amp; loc needed)</i> and hail her...</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>You say, 'Hail Rolandal'</p>
    <p>Rolandal says, 'It would be my guess that you present this to me in hopes 
    to find out more about the magics it possesses. Before I can do this I 
    require some rare treasures that you must present to me.&quot;</p>
    <p>You say, 'what rare treasures?'</p>
    <p>Rolandal says, 'There are 3 items that I seek to continue my studies of 
    some various and musterious magics. Bring to me the teachings of a high 
    ranking Kromzek that I hear goes by the name of Gkrean, a chipped fang from 
    a beast deep within the Cursed Necropolis. Also for good measure, I require 
    the Head of a Kromzek Staff Sergeant to prove to your dedication to our 
    cause. Present these 3 items to me along with your Talisman that you wish to 
    learn more about and I shall do my best to identify its origin for you.'</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Gather these items:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Head of Staff Sergeant Drioc <i>(picture needed)</i> - Found in Kael on 
    Staff Sergeant Drioc in the bank at Kael. He can be taken down easily by a 
    group of 55+. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Teachings of Gkrean <i>(picture needed)</i> - Found on Gkrean in the 
    Arena in Kael. He has two Cleric guardians and is a Cleric himself (he gates 
    and complete heals), conned red to a 60. He can be killed with a group of 
    high levels, but I would reccomend getting your friends for this. You should 
    be able to single pull the two Cleric guards (using FD or a Bard) then go 
    into his room and fight him to prevent gating. He doesn't hit very hard, but 
    the gating / CHing makes him a challenge. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>a chipped fang <i>(picture needed)</i> - Drops from Vilefang in Dragon 
    Necropolis. When you go down the ramp proceed to Zlandicar's lair, the 
    serpent in the water there has been replaced with Vilefang. Can be taken out 
    easily by a group of high levels. He blinds and casts. Seems to be on a 24+ 
    hour spawn, but has no PHs.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once you have these items hand them back to Rolandar along with the 
  talisman and you will recieve an Imbued Talisman. Go back up to Ralgyn and 
  hand this item to him. It will result in the Circlet of the Falinkan.</p>
