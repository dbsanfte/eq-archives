<p><font color="#0000FF">You say, 'Hail, Talwyn Flamecaller'</font></p>
<p><i>Talwyn Flamecaller says 'The fire of destruction burns within you, does it 
not? I can see that your affinity for destructive magic has served you well in 
your travels. It has served you so well that it has caught the eye of Solusek 
Ro. He has created and sent me here to discuss the matter of joining his 
legions. If you do, you will be granted power unheard of on mortal lands. What 
say you?'</i></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">You say, 'I agree' </font><br>
<br>
<i>Talwyn Flamecaller says 'I knew you would. . . What wizard could refuse an 
offer of such power? Since you have proven yourself only through combat and not 
yet through adventuring, I require you to prove yourself worthy once more. A 
small set of tests, really.' </i><br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF">You say, 'what tests' <br>
</font>
<br>
<i>Talwyn Flamecaller says 'The tests I require of you are merely to measure 
your ability as a wizard and follower of Solusek. They will draw upon the focal 
points of being a wizard. Through intelligence and its application to magic, you 
can call upon the elements more often without strain. Through subtlety, you are 
able to be destructive without calling the attention unto yourself. Through 
research, new, more powerful spells and incantations are discovered. Through 
channeling, the ability to concentrate on spells is enhanced, even in the most 
distracting of environments. Once you have completed these tests, return to me 
with the results, so that I may review them.' </i><br>

		able to become more efficient at what we do. To prove to me that you 
		have this gift, I will need you to work your way through a set of 
		riddles. These riddles will take you full circle, beginning with me and 
		ending with me. The path between those two points must be discovered by 
		your own mettle. Take this note and do as it instructs. Take care when 
		handling these notes, they are the lifeblood that will guide you on your 
		journey and should you lose them, you will fail the test. I hope to see 
		you back here with the correct answer soon.'</i></p>

		Only with the proper protection could a mortal hope to enter the citadel

				<br><br><i>Taromani licks her lips and whispers, 'The overlord failed to

<blockquote>
	<p>1. Although locations are listed for ground spawns, they have been reported 
	as spawning in multiple locations in the vicinity.</p>
	<p>2. Talwyn asks for a &quot;rod.&quot; This is indeed the Fluxing Staff.</p>
	<p>3. The Elite Sun Revenant is on a goofy timer. If he has already been up for 
	a while, you can respawn him after you kill him. But if you spawn him then 
	kill him, you will have to wait for the respawn timer.</p>
	<p>4. Shar Vinitras is a new mob in Akheva Ruins; this is not a typo.</p>
	<p>5. Kalym will not talk to you if you have not handed in all previous items 
	to Talwyn.</p>
	<p>6. Treasure Sorter Neiben can be spawned from any Shady Treasure Sorter 
	but seems more common at and around the above location.</p>
