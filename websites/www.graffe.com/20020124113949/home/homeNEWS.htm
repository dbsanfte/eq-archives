        I am a Dark Elf Wizard in the Norrath lands of Xegony. During the beginning 
        of Everquest, I searched and waited for a 'Wizard-only' website. Time

      <p><img src="/home/purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="8">January 23rd Patch Message... /thank Verant:<br>
<p>All I can say is that was one hell of a patch.&nbsp; Changes effecting 
Wizards are in bold.&nbsp; Thank you, Verant!</p>
<p><b>Quest Changes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Ragefire portion of the Cleric Epic quest has been changed. Please see the 
  Developer's Corner on our web site for more details</li>
  <li>Added Quest NPCs to Thurgadin, Kael and Skyshrine for Beastlord quest 
  armor</li>
  <li>Gravel leaf tea will now fit in the combine container for the associated 
  quest</li>
  <li>Grimling Blood should now be dropping</li>
  <li>Idia in the bard guild in Kelethin was telling you to turn in a quest item 
  to the incorrect NPC. Changed quest text to reflect the correct NPC to hand 
  the item to</li>
  <li>In Iceclad, Keref Spiritspear won't be so unreasonable when you complete 
  the task that he asks of you</li>
  <li>Citizens in skyshrine no longer defend the 'vermin' spiders</li>
  <li>Increased the drop rate of the Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth</li>
  <li>Bloody Shak Dratha Hearts should now be dropping</li>
  <li>Quest of Nobility should now be working properly</li>
  <li>Increased the spawn rate of Brother Qwinn tenfold</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Item Changes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Adjusted statistics on equipment that was dropping in the Umbral Plains. 
  Many of the items had AC that was inconsistent with the armor types of the 
  classes. The AC has been reduced on some pieces and raised on others. In all 
  instances where the AC was dropped a different statistic was raised. Several 
  items received a significant upgrade while others were downgraded</li>
  <li>Also in regards to Umbral Plains armor, Ranger has been removed from the 
  plate class armor that was dropping and have been added to the usable classes 
  on the chain equivalent. Bards have been added to the plate equipment list. 
  This might mean that some Rangers will have armor that they can't use. Our 
  Customer Service personnel will trade out that armor for the chain equivalent</li>
  <li>Ghoulbane is now No-Drop</li>
  <li>SoulFire charges can only be used by Paladins (though they can be used 
  from inventory)</li>
  <li>Raised the armor value on many Beastlord specific armor pieces</li>
  <li>Added effects to a few of the Wild Lord's armor pieces</li>
  <li>Added Vah Shir to Imbrued Plate Mail useable races</li>
  <li>Rhino Hide armor is now Druid and Monk usable</li>
  <li>The Crustacean Shell Shield is now magic</li>
  <li><b>Scroll of Knowledge can now be equipped in the primary, secondary, and 
  range slots</b></li>
  <li><b>Scroll of Enlightenment can now be equipped in the primary, secondary, 
  and range slots</b></li>
  <li>Thought Horror Fangs can now be thrown</li>
  <li><b>Iron Scroll of War must now be worn to activate</b></li>
  <li>Cloak of Thorns right click effect should work now</li>
  <li>Runed Bone Fork is now equippable primary, secondary and ranged. The 
  &quot;range&quot; value has been removed to prevent people from accidentally throwing 
  them</li>
  <li>Spider Fur Collar has been given weight 0.0 to be consistent with other 
  pieces</li>
  <li>Dark Cloak of the Sky must now be worn to activate</li>
  <li><b>Sage's Crown is now No-Drop to match every other Velious quest armor</b></li>
  <li><b>Icicle Circlet is now No-Drop to match every other Velious quest armor</b></li>
  <li><b>Bone Collar of the Possessed should no longer cause players to crash 
  when inventory is opened</b></li>
  <li>Idol of Rallos Zek can now be used by ShadowKnights</li>
  <li>Helm of Grim Blessings can now be used by Wood Elves</li>
  <li>Flayed Skin Bracer is no longer a Lore item</li>
  <li>Greaves of Avoidance can now be used by all races</li>
  <li>Steel Threaded Wrist Wraps are no longer lore</li>
  <li>Bravado's Breastplate now grants a larger Hit Point bonus</li>
  <li>Guise of the Hunter can now also be worn by human bards and rogues </li>
  <li>Primal Cudgel now has the proper effect</li>
  <li><b>Added &quot;Recommended Level&quot; equal to the current item use level for the 
  several items. All of these items require the player to be level 51+ to equip 
  them and/or use their effects. Setting the &quot;Recommended Level&quot; field like this 
  just lets the player know what level they need to be to use the item. The 
  actual utility of the item was not affected in any way, this change is purely 
  informational</b></li>
  <li>Several items have been changed to be not useable by Iksar. They had been 
  erroneously set as Iksar useable in the last item patch. These were primarily 
  items that were usable by Beastlords (and were therefore changed to allow all 
  Beastlord races to use them), but that had been specifically restricted from 
  use by Iksar due to their inherent armor value</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Zone Changes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Shades in Umbral, Maiden's Eye and Vex Thall are now considered undead</li>
  <li><b>Placed portals to and from Great Divide and Nexus</b></li>
  <li><b>Added many new items to better round out the rewards for high-level 
  Luclin encounters</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Horse Changes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Implemented horse trade in quests. There are now four stable hands who 
  will buy back specific colored bridles located in the stables in the Bazaar</b></li>
  <li><b>Being stunned will now stop players on horses. Not stopping them when 
  stunned was causing warping and other bad things</b></li>
  <li><b>Knockback spells, and spells that throw you into the air, now affect 
  people on horses properly</b></li>
  <li><b>Horses now levitate when their rider should.</b></li>
  <li><b>Fixed a bug that was causing the client to crash when attempting to 
  follow someone while on a horse. /follow should also now work when the person 
  you are following is on a horse</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Spell Changes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Wizard Familiar spell scrolls will now increase in purchase cost with 
  the spell level</b></li>
  <li>Several spells will no longer be interrupted, spells such as the 'proc' 
  generated by Instrument of Nife</li>
  <li><b>Several spells that were not functioning in the planes have been fixed 
  and now work in the planes </b></li>
  <li>Bards should now gain singing skill when singing and should no longer gain 
  skill in an instrument when they are not using one.</li>
  <li>Characters are no longer damaged by damage shields when using throwing 
  weapons</li>
  <li><b>Atol's Spectral Shackles has had its casting difficulty reduced</b></li>
  <li>Made some changes to Nature's Recovery to make it more stackable</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Visual Changes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Wolves and warders should no longer appear to be very small</li>
  <li>Characters no longer lose their hair or beard when their illusions wear 
  off</li>
  <li>Weapons should now appear properly (sometimes they wouldn't show up at 
  all) when a player zoned in</li>
  <li>Characters in wolf or bear form (or other races that aren't player races) 
  should no longer have parts of them tinted based on the armor the player was 
  wearing</li>
  <li>Bear form should now look correct to people that zoned in after the spell 
  was cast on them</li>
  <li>May have fixed the problem with extra mouse cursor showing in game</li>
  <li>Fixed a problem with NPCs, PCs and some objects not being visible in some 
  zones (Wakening Lands, Plane of Growth, Emerald Jungle and Swamp of No Hope)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Performance Changes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>More work on reducing zone times for Luclin city zones</li>
  <li>&quot;Hitch&quot; created when player characters enter a zone should be gone now</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug that could cause the client to crash in some cases where a 
  character tried to purchase an item from a vendor but didn't have enough money</li>
  <li><b>Characters with pets that zone (horses, familiars and warders) should 
  now be able to zone from North Qeynos to Qeynos Hills</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>New Features</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Holding shift while clicking the resolution in the options in game will 
  reduce the resolution. If you are already in 640x480 though, this does 
  nothing. Normal click increases the resolution as it always has and still 
  wraps back to 640 after the highest resolution your machine supports.</li>
  <li>Using 1280x1024 and 1600x1200 resolutions, the /wincolor command, and 
  getting the inventory window in fullview mode are now available to all 
  EverQuest players (these features were restricted only to Velious owners) </li>
</ul>
<p><b>PvP Changes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>It is no longer possible to bandage others of the opposing deity team on 
  Sullon Zek</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Alternative Advancement Abilities</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Lowered the reuse time on Rampage AA ability from 15 minutes to 10 minutes</li>
  <li>Rampage is now fixed. Previously was only hitting one target</li>
  <li>Mass Group Buff button should work properly when zoning</li>
  <li>Casting Reinforcement should now work on all buffs cast, not just those 
  cast on yourself</li>
  <li>The Discipline Duelist should now be doing the correct damage when using 
  Chaotic Stab</li>
  <li>LifeBurn should now reset properly after being interrupted</li>
  <li>Dire Charm should now reset properly after being interrupted</li>
  <li>Fixed the Quick Buff ability to work as described</li>
  <li>Leech Touch should refresh properly now</li>
  <li><b>Exodus and Nexus Gate now have a casting time of 1/10th of a second</b></li>
</ul>
<p>All I can say is that I am very, very, very happy with this patch. ;)&nbsp;

Well, I don't think anyone else has <S>spent</S> wasted 3 AA points in Quick Evacuation yet, so here are the details.<BR><BR>

It does not effect Alter Plane spells, Translocates, Personal Gates, Shadow Steps, or Group Portals.
<BR><BR>
It does affect all Evacuate spells (including Tishan's Relocation and Markar's Relocation), and the spells Evacuate, Abscond, and Decession.

<BR><BR>

It also changes the spell text from:

<UL><B>Cast Time: 9.0</B></UL>
to the fantastic...
<UL><B>Normal Cast Time: 9.0  Your Cast Time: 8.1</B></UL>

Unless you use Evacuate a lot (more than once an hour), don't waste 18 AA points for 4.5 second evacs, when you can spend 6 AA points and get an Instant (bugged: 1 second) cast time, in-zone Exodus skill, that doesn't take up a spell slot.</p>

<p>It seems that Absor has recently updated Verant's list of Luclin bugs and 
issues to be fixed.&nbsp; Hopefully these will all be completed within the next 
few weeks.</p>
<p><b>Issues Effecting Wizards:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2">Wizard pet buff spells do not appear to be functioning 
  properly</font></li>
  <li><font size="2">Familiars die when the wizard cast invisibility. When this 
  happens no harm comes to the wizard, but the plan it to have them remain when 
  the caster is invisible</font></li>
  <li><font size="2">Some spells (mostly 'bolt' spells) not displaying effects</font></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Issues Effecting Everyone:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2">Reducing loading and zoning times <i>(Note: we have a 
  possible improvement for this on the Test server as of 1-8-02 and hope to have 
  it fixed Live soon)</i></font></li>
  <li><font size="2">There is a very short pause for some players when other 
  players enter a zone <i>(Note: we have a possible fix for this on the Test 
  server as of 1-8-02 and hope to have it fixed Live soon)</i></font></li>
  <li><font size="2">Crashes occurring for some people when logging in</font></li>
  <li><font size="2">Some characters being 'stuck' if game crashed while playing 
  that character</font></li>
  <li><font size="2">Choppy, buggy, faint or flat sounds for some sound 
  configurations.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2">Some systems have mouse pointers which are being lost or 
  duplicated</font></li>
  <li><font size="2">Partial transparencied NPCs are still showing up half 
  invisible/behind things they're supposed to be in front of.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2">Luclin ports trying to take people that don't have Luclin 
  (or the Luclin portal stone fragment) and dumping them at the 'safe point' in 
  the zone</font></li>
  <li><font size="2">Slow framerate on some fast computers</font></li>
</ul>
<p>You can read the entire message
<a target="_blank" href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000449.html">
here</a>. </p>
<p>Also, a new bug that effects us was introduced with yesterday's patch.&nbsp;

      <p><img src="/home/purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="8">Spell System Enhancements:<br>
Included in today's patch were changes to the magical resistances of several high level creatures.
<UL>
<B>
<P>In addition to the melee changes mentioned above, we’ve also made some wide-ranging changes to the way the spell system works, or more accurately, the spell-resist system and how it works in regards to content, specifically content of a high level.</P>

<P>Through our testing we found that many higher level creatures, and especially those creatures that are above 60th level, were typically resisting magical damage to an extent far greater than they should have been. This lead to a couple of classes having their usefulness in these situations either negated or reduced to a pure utility role. As such we’ve made the following changes:</P>
<P>
NPCs now have less of a chance to resist any direct damage spell caused by casters above level 50. Super-high level NPCs have received a large reduction in the level-difference bonus they receive to their resists based upon the level of the attacking player character. We’ve increased the effectiveness of resist debuffs against a large number of higher level NPCs in regard to damage spells being cast upon them. We’ve also reduced the resistances on a wide range of NPCs, especially for NPCs in Velious. Finally, we’ve given our designers more control over the ability to customize any particular encounter. For example previously, if a designer didn’t want a creature to be mesmerisable, he had to give it high magic resistance. Now they can set that feature individually while keeping magic resists reasonable so they don’t take a bunch of classes out of the picture through the need for one feature.
</P>
<P>Players will now also receive messages when an NPC is immune to a particular type of spell, much like messages regarding mesmerization have always been sent. We can do this since the designers have direct control over the effectiveness of certain utility effects, while still allowing damage-causing spells to go through. As an example, NPCs that were always immune to melee-speed debuffs by virtue of the fact that they had a very high magic resistance will still be immune to those spells, but magic-based spells that cause damage or do some other effect that the designer didn’t necessarily want to rule out would now go through.</P>
<P>
Finally, to compensate for increased magical damage, some NPCs have received additional abilities and/or stats. This serves to keep the encounters at a similar level of difficulty while balancing the contribution of melee and casters, rather than engaging exclusively in the melee-heavy strategy of before.
</P>

      <p><img src="/home/purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="8">Trivial Loot Code 
        and Luclin :<br>
        A topic of large debate has been answered by Brad him self on the Trivial 
        Loot Code! 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><b>Hello all,</b> </p>
        <p><b>I wanted to update you all on our current thoughts regarding the 
          Trivial Loot Code as it relates to Shadows of Luclin zones.</b> </p>
        <p><b>As per my last couple of 'Ask Brads', we've made both an effort 
          to explain what the Trivial Loot Code does and why we were considering 
          it for all Luclin zones. I'd also mentioned, however, that if most players 
          appeared to be against its inclusion we'd not use it.</b> </p>
        <p><b>After talking with players, reading emails and feedback, and then 
          very recently running a poll, it is indeed apparent that the majority 
          of our playerbase does not feel that the Loot Code's advantages outweigh 
          its restrictions.</b> </p>
        <p><b>In fact, after polling over 200,000 players, most want the looting 
          system left alone, almost as many want us to explore a different solution 
          for bottom feeding and rampant farming, and a minority were in favor 
          of the Trivial Loot Code as it exists today in the Warrens and Stonebrunt 
          Mountains (the remainder either didn't have an opinion or were unfamiliar 
          with TLC).</b> </p>
        <p><b>Well, so be it <img src="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif" width="15" height="15"></b> 
        </p>
        <p><b>We will head back to our drawing boards and keep brainstorming on 
          this issue, but at this current time we do NOT intend on implementing 
          TLC for the zones in our upcoming expansion, the Shadows of Luclin.</b> 
        </p>
        <p><b>I do want to thank everyone for all the feedback and discussion 
          regarding this issue -- there was a lot of debate surrounding this issue, 
          and we've done our best to pay attention.</b> </p>

        McQuaid (Aradune) about the Tome of Ages quest while they were at the 
        Fan Faire - 
      <blockquote> "I asked him specifically about the Oracle quest and he said 
        that only 2 parts are active. The Torch quest and the pally quest. That's 
        it. I mentioned that someone posted that the full oracle quest had been 
        finished and you had to travel to lots of places including the Hole. He 
        shook his head and said, 'No, that quest is definitely not done'." </blockquote>
      So as we all expected, those items sent in last year that have been labeled 
      "Possible Hoax", are indeed a hoax.
