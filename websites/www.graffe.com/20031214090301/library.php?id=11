As with most wizards I have met, I like to push the limits of what I can do, and my quadding exploits have earned me many great rewards.  I quadded spectres from level 46-49 then moved on to Timorous Deep and Spirocs.  The spectre camp in the Ocean of Tears is rewarding in terms of xp and loot, but as with all new soloing spots there is a learning curve.  Fortunately the curve isn’t too bad with this camp, plus they are just a fun mob to kite.  There are spectres to quad in the Oasis zone as well, but I hated doing it there the few times I did because it was a more crowded zone and too often the quad would bug the younger players.  Lets face it, a level 12 player should get nervous seeing four red-conning, lifetapping spectres coming anywhere near.  The Ocean of Tears zone is better imho, so I offer this guide, but a lot of the info applies to both locations.<br><br>

If you are new to quadding, you should read the last section, Quadding Basics – An Introduction to Quadding first.  If quadding is like eating breakfast for you, then read on and ignore the quadding basics section.<br><br>

<u>Advanced Quadders:</u> You can take this camp in your thirties if you know what you are doing.  Some have quadded spectres successfully from as low as level 34, or even earlier.  Try at your own risk.</I><br><br>

<b><I>Background Information</i></b><br><br>

<b>The Ocean of Tears and Spectre Island:</b>  The Ocean of Tears zone, affiliated with the old world continent of Faydwer, is famous for its mythical and ancient creatures.  In an era where the moon and even the planes themselves are as accessible to all adventurers as the local food merchant, many a modern adventurer has still found his or her way into the Ocean of Tears and found it both fascinating and profitable.  Spectre Island, located in the western part of the Ocean of Tears (loc –1000, -7000), is a smallish jumble of rocks with a small, dark tower on top.  Wandering around the island you will see greater skeletons (level 10-11) and gargoyles (level 19-20).  The gargoyles and skeletons seem mystically tied to each other.  As one is killed, either a gargoyle or skeleton will instantly appear somewhere on the island.  The spectres float, stationary on the four sides of the dark tower on top of the island.<br><br>

<b>Spectres (level 33-37):</b>  Spectres are supernatural, ghostly apparitions, possibly remnants of beings that once traveled the world but now are long-dead.  To come close to them is to feel cold like a winter night.  Adorned only in shadowy, unsubstantial robes, they carry heavy scythes as their only physical weapon.  They can ‘touch’ you from a short distance with a cold-based lifetap that does up to 35 hit points of damage and they hit well with their scythes, doing up to 96 hit points maximum at melee range.  The offsetting good news is that you can stay far enough away to quad them and still avoid their lifetaps.  Plus they have below average amount of hit points for a mob of their level so are fairly quick to kill.  They spawn approximately every 10 minutes or so.  The regular, better quality scythes they drop sell for up to 13p each, bronze scythes sell for 3p each, research items, coin, and lesser gems all sell nicely as well.  Some spectres carry rusty scythes that garner a mere handful of gold and are better destroyed than carried to market.<br><br>

<b>Suggested Set-up:</b>  Print out a map of the Ocean of Tears from a fine site like EQ Atlas.  This will help you, especially since I am unsure of my directions.  You’ll have to take a boat to enter the OOT zone, accessible from either the East Freeport or Butcherblock Mountains docks.  Once you enter the Ocean of Tears zone, jump off the boat and cast lesser evacuate.  Try not to laugh at other adventurers on the boat who inquire of your safety.  The lesser evacuate spell will take you the docks on what is called the Island of the Sisters of Erollisi (aka Sister Island).  Boats heading between Antonica and Faydwer stop here briefly so adventurers who don’t have arcane means of intrazone transport can get to Sister Island without swimming extensively.  Swim south from these docks and a little east to the island with the goblins and the quest guy for the Oracle Robe.  Kill a goblin for fun if you want.  Go to the east side of this island and bind there.  This binding location gives you a suitably distant escape valve if you need it, plus convenience to your quadding location at the end of a hard-day’s grouping.  Yes I know I could just use lesser evacuate and be pretty close, but I am lazy so sue me.  From my preferred binding loc, go east, young wizard to the Spectre Island to get to work!  I preferred to swim over because its pretty close and that gave me a chance to increase my swimming skill, but that’s a personal choice.<br><br>

<b><i>Quadding Preparation</i></b><br><br>

You can avoid this paragraph if you don’t mind having your quad interrupted by greenies and don’t want extra loot.  I suggest clearing out all the gargoyles because they will agro you during your quad.  The skeletons will not bother you so keep them alive.  For each gargoyle you kill, either a skeleton or another gargoyle will appear.  Keep killing gargoyles until none are left and the island wanderers are all skeletons.  Note that the gargoyles will fight the skeletons if they encounter each other and the gargoyles usually win, so be vigilant and protect your friends the skeletons!  Clearing the island not only saves you grief during your quad but also will net you a fair amount of stackable gargoyle eyes that sell for 7-9 plat to vendors.  More loot is a good thing imho.<br><br>

Just before you begin quadding the spectres, cast levitate and steelskin on yourself.  Levitate will allow you to run across the island's jagged rocks without falling or becoming disoriented.  Steelskin will allow you to absorb any spectre's lifetaps you accidentally eat.  Don’t forget to stock up on the spell reagents - batwings and jaspers!  Both are available in the bazaar.  I recommend refreshing levitate often so you don't have to recast it in the middle of a quad.  And keeping steelskin memmed in case of emergency.<br><br>

<b><i>Quadding the Spectres</b></i><br><br>

<i>Pulling the Spectres:</i>  You’re ready to start!  Head up near the top of the island.  You can get pretty close to the spectres without aggroing them, in my experience.  If you have the Staff of Temperate Flux I suggest targeting one of the Spectres then heading around to the opposite side of the tower.  In this position you can flux the targeted one and pull either three or all four of the spectres.  Move it immediately after you flux so you don’t eat a bunch of lifetaps.   Circle out and way around, staying well ahead of the spectres, and hit F9 to get an overview and see if you have all four.  If one or two are left by the tower return, pull, and repeat until you have all four. <br><br> 

<i>Rounding-up/Snaring Spectres:</i>  Get them tightly knotted together by your preferred method, circling them or weaving around in switchbacks.  Due to the island’s rockiness, it is possible to lose sight of the spectres as they go up and down among the rocky ledges and dips.  Staff of Temperate Flux helps you keep track of their targetability.  You will get a feel for how far you must stay to avoid their lifetaps.  Steelskin is nice to have up while you are learning the ropes.  Snare them once you have them tightly wound.  They hardly ever resist but if they do, you will need to snare the resister, round them up again and resnare.  Note that the spectres don’t move as fast as you do at normal speed so you don’t really have to snare them, but your quad will go faster if you slow them and even faster if you have your runspeed modified and they are snared.<br><br>

<i>Quadding Path: </i> There are two paths to quad the spectres and I have done them both.  One is to go back and forth across the island’s top where the topography is flatter.  The other is to circle the island, down by the water or partly up the side.  I prefer the latter because I found it more reliable in terms of being able to see my pull.  The Staff of Temperate Flux is nice here again because you can keep track of the targetability of your spectre pull.  Don’t try and quad the spectres over the water, because they just sink in and become untargetable.  If all goes well, once you learn the ropes, you should not need to resnare and the spectres should be dead in seven or eight casts of Circle of Force.  <br><br>

Loot up and enjoy!  If you are not an evil race, you can lesser evacuate or run/swim to the Sister Island to sell and get back to the spectres before the next spawn happens. <br><br> 

<b><u><i>Quadding Basics – An Introduction to Quadding:</b></u></i><br><br>

Welcome to the art of soloing multiple mobs as a wizard.  The first wizards who tried fighting multiple mobs must be thanked for their creativity and gustiness.  Going against statements like “Wizards are not a soloing class”, these pioneers proved that not only can wizards solo, but also they can solo the socks off of most other classes.  You will need a few tools to be able to quad mobs.  <br><br>
]
First and foremost, you need the research-only, level 34 spell Circle of Force.  This spell hits four mobs at the same time with area of effect direct damage spell.  The mobs have to be close together for it to work.  Circle of Force is research-only from the Runes of Banding, Catalyst and Concussion.  You can usually purchase the spell or necessary runes in the bazaar or kindly ask a fellow wizard if he can research it for you.  You did remember to work on your research, didn’t you?  Later, you can purchase or loot upgrades to this spell called Pillar or Frost (level 51), Pillar of Lightning (level 54) and Pillar of Flame (level 57).<br><br>

Next you will need the vendor-bought level 29 spell Bonds of Force.  Its available in the Library Mechanamagica in Ak’anon, the Tower of the Crimson Hands in the Erudin Palace, the Academy of Arcane Science in Freeport West, in Gukta, and in the Tower of the Spurned in the Neriak Commons.  Later you can purchase or loot Atol’s Spectral Shackles, a level 51 upgrade to Bonds of Force.<br><br>

Other items are needed as well in most cases.  You will need something to artificially increase your runspeed.  These include Journeyman’s Boots, Traveler’s Boots, or the Spirit of Wolf spell, available from shaman players in 1-, 5- and 10-dose potions.  Later you can get an AA that will permanently increase your runspeed.  Its also nice to have the Staff of Temperate Flux, a wizard-only item that is useful because it can quickly pull mobs and it works from your inventory.  This item is available via quest from the Temple of Solusek Ro.  Some wizards use their snare to pull (the Druid method) or they use a small direct damage spell.<br><br>

Finally, quadders get used to using the F9 key a lot while they are on the run, being chased by angry mobs.  Hitting F9 gives you an overview of yourself and your pull so you can see how many mobs you have in your quad and alerts you to other dangers.  Using this view tells you if you have to deal with adds or go find more mobs to fill your quad.<br><br>
