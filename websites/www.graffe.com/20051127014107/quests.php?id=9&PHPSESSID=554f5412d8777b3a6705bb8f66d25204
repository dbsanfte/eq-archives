      <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This quest 
      originates by talking to Vilissia within the Temple of Solusek Ro.</font><p>
      <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Vilissia says 
      'The Acumen Mask, as its name suggests, confers to its wearer certain 
      powers of insight and knowledge.<br>
      <br>
       Vilissia says 'I can make for you an Acumen Mask, but you will need to 
      bring me the proper components. I will need a Glowing Mask from a Skeletal 
      Monk in the Caverns of Guk, A Patch of Shadow from our mortal enemies the 
      Shadowed Men, a Darkbone Skull from a Darkbone Skeleton in the Estate of 
      Unrest and a Bonechipped Mask from a Goblin Headmaster in the Ocean of 
      Tears. </font></p>
      <hr noshade="noshade">
      <p align="left">
      <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Patch of 
      Shadow- this is dropped by Shadowmen (roughly level 25 -30), the place I 
      hunted them to get it was in west commons in the corner of the zone wall, 
      if you follow the right zone wall from Kithicor when facing outwards. you 
      will only see their name and the weapons they carry because they are 
      transparent. (Get this item last. All Shadowmen items are NO RENT which 
      means they will dissapear from your inventory once you log out. -Graffë) 
      Also, be sure you have done the 'Optional Patch' to Everquest so that the 
      Temple of Solusek Ro zone can load. If you have not patched, you cannot go 
      in the Temple.</font></p>
      <p align="left">
      <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Darkbone 
      Skull- found off of a GREATER darkbone skeleton (roughly level 27-28) in 
      Unrest. Note- I went around blasting normals for an hour then killed a 
      greater in a train and it had it :P (Many of these spawn near the 
      bloodpool and the Ghost in the basement. - Graffë)</font></p>
      <p align="left">
      <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Glowing mask- 
      this is found in Upper Guk, NOT Unrest. If you go towards the main lower 
      guk zone there is the place that you cross a plank (it is also filled with 
      Heart Spiders), jump in the water and search around for a hidden room. 
      Within that room you will find Tempus, a Dark Elf Necromancer (roughly 
      level 25 -26). The Skeleton Monk (roughly level 24-25) with the mask will 
      be next to him (if you attack the monk, the necro and his pet will join 
      in). I have been told by some that the Necro will not join but he will 
      attempt to heal the Skeletal Monk. This all depends on your level. (note:Glowing 
      Mask has been found upon the Scryer in Upper Guk and did work as a 
      component for the quest - submit by Kyal) (If you cross the wooden plank 
      in the Spider room (see
      <a href="http://www.graffe.com/graffe1.0/maps/_upper_guk_full.jpg" target="_blank">
      map</a>), look to your left and you will see a ladder that leads to a 
      ledge and another below that leads from the ledge to the water. Swim to 
      the very bottom there and follow the wall to the right, you will find the 
      room up in an 'air pocket' there. - Graffë)</font></p>
      <p align="left">
      <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bonechipped 
      Mask- This is dropped by the Goblin Headmaster (roughly level 24-25) on 
      the Isle Goblin island in the Ocean of Tears. This is the same island the 
      Oracle is on (known to some as the Oracle Island). If you still don't know 
      where this is, keep following the pier on the Sisters' island and swim out 
      into the ocean until you see the island. The Headmaster spawns in front of 
      a small hut and drops the mask fairly often (2 out of 6 times was my 
      experience). Verant was furthermore merciful - he spawns every 5 to 10 
      minutes. He has approximately 900hp. The shamans that spawn near him go 
      down easily, it might be a good idea to take them out first. (Follow the 
      water's edge around the Goblin island until you see a stone ruin. There is 
      a Goblin hut near that ruin and the Headmaster spawns in front of that 
      hut. -Graffë)</font></p>
