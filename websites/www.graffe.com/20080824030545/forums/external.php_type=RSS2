<br />

<br />
It's very rare that you find yourself cheering on the most vivacious, outrageous, dangerous, and sensuous of criminals. <br />
<br />
Carmen Sandiego took us through The USA, Europe, The World, Space, and Time itself. <br />
<br />
I've played most of the games growing up. It was fun and educational. <br />
<br />
I remember both the game shows and the Fox Cartoon, featuring the most annoying AI ever.<br />
<br />
[media]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2jpE1kPnzk[/media]<br />
(love that theme song)<br />
<br />
Taking this in another direction, nowadays I realize just how dead sexy Carmen really is. I remember her dossier read that she loves spicy foods and has a taste for Fine jewelery. You can't argue with that. Tall; long, dark brown hair; crimson clothing in an almost Film Noir detective style, revealing nothing and maintaining the Feminine Mystique while she lures us to catch her in a cat and mouse game where the truth is that she cannot be had, only chased, and chase the Femme Fatale we did! <br />
<br />
Maybe I'm reading too much into this, but damn, that's sexy.<br />
<br />
Despite her classiness (Take note, Ladies!), <br />
she <br />
stole <br />
EVERYTHING!<br />
She does her own stunts, even! <br />
<br />
For example, Look at the cartoon series....SHE TRIED TO STEAL THE STATUE OF FREAKING LIBERTY! She JUMPS off and flies away in a freaking jetpack better than most Tribes players and rocketman combined!<br />
<br />
Another point: brilliant opening: a strange crime &#8211; suddenly, from the dark nature to a celebration &#8211; we are confused. The chorus sings amidst Chinese new year as we realize we are in a glorious game of cat and mouse as Carmen Sandiego is standing triumphant on a rooftop, stealing what looks like an oni, she jumps away and throws a clue to the young detectives, enticing them to pursue her. <br />
<br />
Later, at the statue of liberty scene, she's seen expecting them, her hands on her hips as she grins and tips her hat at them, archs her back and jumps off the building, jet-packing away to continue the chase.<br />
<br />
The games were also great. I usually got my coffee in the office to stand upright, but otherwise I still want the goddamned machine fixed and have all vending abominations like it destroyed. I also learned early on the need to avoid Charges of False Arrest. <br />
<br />
Carmen Sandiego is a Sexy Badass who reminds us how important History is.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Why is it illegal (in Canada, and I think some US states too) to show payroll deductions <b>that the employer must make</b> on a person's paystub?<br />
<br />
People do NOT know how much they are taxed.  The employer portion is invisible.  When you negotiate a $40,000 job, it does not cost the employer $40,000.  It costs him much more.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In the United States, you pay:<br />
<br />
- social security: 6.2% + 6.2%<br />
- medicare tax: 1.45% + 1.45%<br />
- unemployment taxes, which is too complicated to address here<br />
<br />
Let us assume you get paid $15/hour for 2,000 hours a year, or earn a $30,000 annual salary.  Your TRUE salary is actually $32,295 because the company pays taxes on your behalf.  (An argument may be made that if they didn't have to pay it to you, but that is not valid because a direct tax does not shift the income graph left or right, but rather up and down.)<br />
<br />
Now, on your $32,295 salary, $4,590 is withheld as payroll taxes and it constitutes 14.2% of your income.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In Canada, you pay:<br />
<br />
- Canadian pension plan: 4.95% + 4.95%<br />
- employment insurance: 1.73% + 1.73(1.4)%<br />
<br />
On $30,000 in income, the employer withholds: $2,211.60 so your real salary is $32,211.60, similar to the United States.  That translates into a payroll tax of 13.1%.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is taken right of the top and rarely even mentioned when people talk about income tax rates.  Why?  Why are people so ignorant of how much they are taxed?  And is it right for the government to keep people in the dark by forbidding companies from telling people straight up how much they have to remit to the government?<br />
<br />
Or have you ever had a paystub that clearly indicated how much was remitted to the government, including the employer's portion?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Note: In Canada the CPP is almost equivalent to SS.  The rates are 4.95% in Canada, 6.2% in the US, with the maximum in Canada to be $40,000 and in the United States $97,500.  This is a much higher tax in the US.  <br />
<br />
Employment insurance only goes on the first $40,000 in Canada; after that it stops.  <br />
<br />
Essentially, if you make more than $40,000 a year in Canada, there are no more payroll taxes.  In 2007, the maximum payroll tax in Canada was $1,989.90 (CPP) + $720 (EI) = $2,709.90. (employee side deduction)<br />
<br />
In the US, it is $6,045 for Social Security with no limit on Medicare and I don't even include employment insurance.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is bullshit.  At the very least we need some disclosure.  Full disclosure.</div>

				Warner Bros. has confirmed long-running rumors that it will reboot the Superman movie franchise. <br />
<br />
Jeff Robinov, Warner Bros. Pictures Group President, tells The Wall Street Journal that the Man of Steel will be reintroduced on the big screen without regard to 2006’s Superman Returns. <br />
<br />
“Superman didn’t quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to,” Robinov says. “It didn’t position the character the way he needed to be positioned. ... Had Superman worked in 2006, we would have had a movie for Christmas of this year or 2009.” <br />
<br />
There’s no mention whether Superman Returns director Bryan Singer will be part of the reboot. Earlier this week, Variety’s Anne Thompson reported “that it is a priority at the studio to find the right direction and if Bryan Singer is willing to do that, fine, but if he gets in the way, he may not stay on the project.” <br />
<br />
Taking a page from Marvel, Warner Bros. has reversed its earlier position of using the now-stalled Justice League of America as a launching pad for other DC properties. Instead, it will focus on solo features to build toward a multicharacter film. <br />
<br />
“Along those lines, we have been developing every DC character that we own,” Robinov says. <br />
<br />
That may sound less like a “strategy” and more like a mad cash-grab. Something else that might not sit right with some fans is Robinov’s determination to explore the darker side of super-heroes: “We’re going to try to go dark to the extent that the characters allow it.” <br />
<br />
According to The Journal, Warner Bros. plans to release four comic-book movies in the next three years: the third Batman installment, the Superman reboot, and two focusing on other DC Comics characters. (It’s unclear whether Watchmen is included in that count.) Likely candidates include Green Arrow/Super Max, Green Lantern, Captain Marvel and, perhaps, Jonah Hex. <br />
<br />
As Variety reported over the weekend, Warner Bros. is expected to roll out its strategy for its DC Comics movie properties sometime within the next month.

				Seeing Invaders!, digital artist Douglas Edric Stanley's Space Invaders attacks New York's Twin Towers art installation, is very effective in eliciting an immediate emotional response. That makes it a successful work of art, even if reaction to such confrontational themes are rarely positive.<br />
<br />
Spending more time absorbing and, of course, playing Invaders! gives one a better perspective on what Stanley was aiming for. Invaders! is a two-player motion controlled spin on classic Space Invaders gameplay. Your best tactic, swinging your arms from side-to-side to fire a spread of bullets from your off screen cannon, is tiring. And futile.<br />
<br />
The towers will always fall, along with dozens of of its anonymous inhabitants.<br />
<br />
No matter how quickly you'll attack the air with movement, the alien invaders will always cause enough destruction to the World Trade Center towers to make them fall. In addition to raining down bullets, suicide UFOs will occasionally crash into the towers. You'll always fail, as clearing a screen full of invaders will simply be followed by a freshly restocked swarm.<br />
<br />
The Invaders! installation features a video loop that runs alongside the playable game. This video features scenes from the films Taxi Driver, Independence Day, Air Force One and Die Hard &#8212; all of which are American made films with a xenophobic streak &#8212; interspersed with stills of George W. Bush in his flight suit and John Wayne pointing a gun at the screen. Peppered in are brief clips of people playing Invaders! with a ticker listing &quot;hi&quot; and &quot;lo&quot; scores in red, white and blue text at the bottom of the screen.<br />
<br />
The artist's statement describes Invaders! as &quot;an articulated and critical commentary about the current war strategy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Invaders! may be unsettling, with its blending of archaic gameplay and modern day catastrophe, but it's also an impressive accomplishment in that it delivers complex messages via simple means. Despite its perceived insensitivity, Stanley's ability to use video games as a medium of artistic expression will likely be an important step in the form being taken seriously (by people who take things seriously).

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Fall semester started Thursday for me. I know, I don't know why they picked Thursday. Met two of my four professors and already know and love one of those four (not included in the two I've met). Good, positive impressions so far. This semester might just turn out pretty good... assuming my archaeology class is indeed interesting.<br />
<br />
Good luck to everyone juggling school and life and having to do fun things like worry about financial aid.<br />
<br />
Yes, feel free to bitch about something too. For example, the freshmen. :D</div>

GRAFTON, Wis. -- A woman has been arrested for failing to return two books to the Grafton Library.<br />
<br />
Woman Arrested For Not Returning Books To Library<br />
<br />
Heidi Dalibor was arrested after she failed to return the books, &quot;Angels and Demons&quot; and &quot;White Oleander&quot;, last year.<br />
<br />
&#8220;I said, what could they possibly do? They can&#8217;t arrest me for this&#8230; I was wrong,&#8221; Dalibor said.<br />
<br />
Dalibor did not respond to four notices from the library, two phone calls and two letters. The library forwarded the case to police, who issued a citation for Dalibor's failure to return the materials or pay the fine. The citation included a court date, which Dalibor admits she ignored.<br />
<br />
With arrest warrant in hand, police showed up at Dalibor&#8217;s door and led her away in handcuffs.<br />
<br />
While the police have been criticized for going so far, the police chief said they simply followed the law.<br />
<br />
&#8220;None of this would have been necessary if she followed the agreement and returned the books,&#8221; said Grafton Police Chief Charles Wenten.<br />
<br />
Dalibor paid her $170 fine and was released.<br />
<br />
&#8220;I completely take responsibility for not paying my fine on time and not going to my court date,&#8221; Dalibor said.<br />
<br />
Still, she isn&#8217;t planning on returning the books.<br />
<br />
&#8220;I still have the books and I don&#8217;t plan to return them because they&#8217;re paid for now,&#8221; Dalibor said.</div>

Re: Fundraising<br />
<br />
My friends, you have probably noticed that over the past few weeks, I have been criticized relentlessly by my opponent and his camp.<br />
<br />
Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to speak with you directly, hopefully to set the record straight - as well as encourage you to contribute to my campaign in order to fight these scurrilous lies.<br />
<br />
If I seem to falter in clearly stating what I stand for today, stood for in the past, or will stand for tomorrow, that&#8217;s because I was a <b>POW</b>.<br />
<br />
I have been ridiculed because I don&#8217;t remember how many homes I own. But given the treatment I endured as a <b>POW</b>, is it not understandable that some memories will be faint and not easily called to mind?<br />
<br />
My friends, the important thing to remember in this race is not whether Czechoslovakia is still a country, but the challenges facing our nation &#8211; challenges that can best be met by someone who has served their country as a <b>POW</b>.<br />
<br />
I am certain that even the people in Iraq, the Heartland of the Arab World &#8211; Sunni, Shi&#8217;ia, whatever &#8211; agree that only a former <b>POW</b> would have the foreign policy credentials necessary to bring stability to the middle part of &#8211; wherever it is these people live.<br />
<br />
We all know that my opponent, Barack <u><b>HUSSEIN</b></u> O'Bama, is anxious to end this Noble Cause and slink away in utter defeat. And I ask you, as patriotic Americans: Where will the <b>POW</b>s <i>of the next generation come from, <u>if we abandon our efforts to create them now</u>? Who will run for the presidency on the <b><u>POW</u></b><u> platform in future</u></i>?<br />
<br />
There are now stories in the news, my friends, about my abandonment of my first wife and our children. My friends, allow me to remind you that I was a <b>POW</b>. How many nights did I spend dreaming of coming home to my beautiful bride, only to return and face the reality of a woman who just wasn&#8217;t what I&#8217;d been dreaming of while I was a<b> POW</b>?<br />
<br />
Had I not earned, by virtue of having been a <b>POW</b>, the right to live out the rest of my shattered life with a younger, prettier multi-millionairess?<br />
<br />
I have also been wrongfully taken to task because I may have plagiarized someone else&#8217;s <b>POW</b> story and recounted it as my own experience. We <b>POW</b>s will often do that, in a spirit of solidarity. So what&#8217;s the harm? Why is everyone tryin&#8217; to make something of it &#8211; I mean, Jesus, can&#8217;t you just let it go already?<br />
<br />
Now they&#8217;re on my wife&#8217;s back about this Mother Theresa story &#8211; so she can&#8217;t remember shit either, like how we wound up adopting a kid &#8211; BIG FUCKIN&#8217; DEAL!!! She&#8217;s the God-damned wife of a <b>POW</b>, and that affects her memory, too! Wanna make somethin&#8217; of it, my friends?<br />
<br />
It seems to me, my friends, that everyone is just pilin&#8217; on &#8211; &#8220;Oh, yeah, let&#8217;s ALL beat up on the <b>POW</b> guy, like he didn&#8217;t take enough abuse being a<b> POW</b>. Let&#8217;s get &#8216;im.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Even a hippie has-been like Jackson Browne and that Mike Myers freak are comin&#8217; after me now. No fuckin&#8217; respect for a <b>POW</b> &#8211; this is what the world has come to, thanks to those <b>commie Democrats</b> <i><b>who have been runnin&#8217; this country into the ground for the past eight years</b></i>!<br />
<br />
Well, THIS is one <b>POW</b> who isn&#8217;t going to take it anymore, my so-called friends.<br />
<br />
SO PUT UP AND SHUT UP!!!<br />
<br />
Send your money to my campaign RIGHT NOW, or <b><i><u>I will draft every one of your sorry asses, and send you to Iraq for the next hundred God-damned years!</u></i></b><br />
<br />
GOT IT?<br />
<br />
Your Friend,<br />
John McCain, <b>P.P.O.W</b>©<br />
