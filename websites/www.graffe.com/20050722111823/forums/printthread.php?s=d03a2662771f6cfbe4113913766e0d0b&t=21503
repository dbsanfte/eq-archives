I completely agree.<br />
<br />
But Arnold is not representative of the Republican Party in pretty much any way. Why the hell are they pretending that he represents the face of their party? Arnold is a small-government, pro social liberties semi-libertarian - as opposed to the current Republican party, which is staunchly big-government and anti social liberties.<br />

I couldn't agree more. Laura Bush is much more congenial, but at the same time far less willing to take strong stances of her own. I'm not sure that's a good thing.<br />

Why would this convention give any more of a bounce? We already know that the reason the Democratic convention did not give one is because there are so few swing voters, I doubt the Republican one will give even as much of a bounce - after all, everyone already knows where Bush stands on all of the issues, why will hearing him say so change their minds?</div>

My political views fall in line with his for the most part (I'm that semi-libertarian wing of the party) and he's been a pleasent breath of fresh air in the Republican camp. I never thought he'd turn out this well, I was a bit worried he'd be a disaster as govenor, but he's been about a billion times better than I could have ever imagined.<br />

McCain is getting on my nerves slowly, though. Tonight was just a symptom of it. I'm not sure what's going on there, but he's become much more annoying the last year than I ever found him before.</div>
