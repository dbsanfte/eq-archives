A different team is making the multiplayer, a studio that tends to work on multiplayer versions and dlc packs for Call of Duty and Halo. <br />

<br />
Battleborn beta April 13-18. Xone/PS4. This is the first person shooter moba being made by Gearbox. The gaming community in general has been pretty negative about this ever since it got announced, but I've been waiting for someone to mix these particular genres and might give it a shot out of curiosity. The beta that is. Not paying $60 for a moba.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I actually forgot all about this, until I started seeing ads every time I went to Youtube. Thought about rolling it into the previous thread, but it's enough of its own thing that I went ahead and made a new one.<br />
<br />
Upon the completion of Starcraft 2's incredibly long development cycle and the conclusion to the story they started telling in Wings of Liberty, Blizzard announced they would continue to support the game with story DLC mission packs. The first they announced was dubbed Nova Covert Ops and is about the Terran Ghost Nova. I think they are selling it for $21, but if you pre-ordered it you got it for $15. It's basically a mini-campaign of three packs spread out across the year with three missions in each.<br />
<br />
At the time I sort of thought they might use this as a vehicle of telling the story from the canned action game from decades ago, but it looks like it has an all new story that takes place after Legacy of the Void. Tell me if you have heard this one before: Superspy loses memory, goes on a journey to retrace her steps and uncover a mystery. Also the zerg are running amok and no one knows why, and a new Terran faction has formed to oppose the New Dominion, which is being led by Mengsk's seemingly benevolent son. It might seem generic, but it's framed in a reasonably interesting manner. I genuinely want to see what happens next, despite seeing countless stories like this already.<br />
<br />
My main takeaway after playing the first pack is that I sort of think they should just have waited and released it all at once. It's a short experience, and the story doesn't really benefit from the long wait between packs. The levels are very good though, and the campaign itself is set up like a mini sized version of what you got in the others. You find upgrades on missions that let you deck Nova out in new equipment, or mix and match different abilities for your units. There are also plenty of in-engine cutscenes, though a few of the other features are paired down. No walking around and talking to npcs on your ship, for example. It's solid overall. It's just so, so short. <br />
<br />
At this rate it's also going to be overpriced. They do some nice things with the missions, each usually having multiple segments with interesting mechanics present within. It almost reminded me of some of the great user made campaigns I played in the original StarCraft. But then it's over, and you remember how slow they are at producing content. It's too early to judge, but from what I played I would say this more closely falls into the $10-$15 camp, rather than the $15-21 one.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Over the past several months there have been several rumblings coming from Microsoft about support for the PC platform. Or rather, I should say that their eternal and constant claims of support for the PC platform have actually shown evidence towards being true for a change. Several Xbox games are getting PC versions now, often with day-and-date releases with their console versions. Except Microsoft doesn't seem capable of learning from their mistakes, and are creating an abomination that may be worse than Games for Windows Live ever was.<br />
<br />
So here's the basic rundown: in order to play a game published by Microsoft on PC, you have to have Windows 10 and use their store. More than being another push for Windows 10, and more than being a push for using their particular marketplace, this is a move to control how you actually are able to access the game. The Windows 10 store doesn't use the same format PC games have been using for years, and instead uses something called the Universal Windows Platform (UWP). This is part of their initiative to link their entire family of devices (PC, console, smartphones) together in the same ecosystem. As a means of playing console games on your PC, this might be acceptable, but as support for &quot;PC gaming&quot;, it's kind of appalling.<br />
<br />
So what's the problem? UWP takes away a lot of the freedom and control an advanced PC user generally expects and takes for granted. It does this by preventing access to the game files themselves. This means no modding and no user-side fixes or tweaks. It also means slower updates and limited third party support, as the inverse is also true and developers have to take a singular path of certification through Microsoft before being accepted. This leads to things that may or may not be fixed eventually, no SLI/Crossfire, vsync issues, etc. Like any closed ecosystem, the upside is that the programs you launch are less likely to harm your entire computer, and the theory that Microsoft vetting for the products means they have a standard of quality.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/why-pc-games-should-never-become-universal-apps/1/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC Gamer - Why Pc Games Should Never Become Universal Apps</a><br />
<br />
I'm still going to give them the benefit of the doubt, but they need to do better. And more importantly, they need to be challenged, lest they push too far. Microsoft hasn't been shy about restricting features in the past.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>There isn't enough information yet to justify a thread, but I thought you guys should get some hint of this stuff if you happen to stay current with this forum but not the industry at large: both Microsoft and Sony are working on significant updates to their current consoles that will be released during this console generation.<br />
<br />
In Microsoft's case, they declared their intentions but have no hard facts yet on what form it will take. They are coming from a position where they no longer have the top console and so seek to consolidate their console and PC presence. On the PC side that means UWP, on the console side that means being able to upgrade your hardware. I've thought for awhile now that having a modular console where you can swap out the parts yourself would be cool. It hasn't been done up until now partly because it increases the chance at piracy. It will be interesting to see what Microsoft eventually does.<br />
<br />
As for Sony, theirs seems to be an open secret. It almost seems like a controlled leak if it weren't how catastrophic this might be for current sales. They seem to simply be making a more powerful version of the PS4 to launch at the same price point. Dubbed the PS4k by fans due to its support for 4k resolutions on televisions. The timing is interesting, because it's right when Sony has been making headway into their own VR solution. It's possible the current PS4 just isn't powerful enough for a smooth experience. This might also hopefully mean 60fps in more games (looking at you Final Fantasy).<br />
<br />
So I guess the takeaway, and the reason why I created this thread, was to warn people about making any new console purchases until we know more. Especially a PS4.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>We've had a couple of delays, but April is still a pretty big month. Though as I mentioned last month, the Oculus just rifted (edit: ha, freudian slip; correction: arrived) and the HTC Vive will be releasing in a few days, so that will distract a bit from conventional titles. Not for long though, I wager.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's a tough call, but I'm going to say that the biggest game this month is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVBFjrH-kIc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Dark Souls III</b></a>. This series took a niche developer to a reasonably mainstream level of success. The previous game went without the creator and lead director of the series (as he worked on Bloodborne instead), but he's back for this one. He has since gone on to become the president of the company, so future games in the series may diverge more dramatically. For this entry, I've mostly seen talk of them expanding enemy behavior and weapon capabilities/movesets. <br />
<br />
<br />
The other big game this month is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU17_kd-e4w" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Quantum Break</b></a>. I'm unsure if the general gaming community cares about this as much as I do, but as far as I'm concerned it's one of Microsoft's biggest new games. Made by the same people as Max Payne and Alan Wake, it's basically a third person cover-based shooter with time powers. Announced during their Tv, Tv, Tv Dark Ages, the game was supposed to have a concurrent TV show. What they ended up with is more of a mini-series that plays out in between major chapters in the game. It sounds like at the end of an episode you get a simple choice that will then affect the next level you play, though I don't know how far they go with this.<br />
<br />
While it's one of Microsoft's big Xbox exclusives, due to their recent Windows 10 pushes it is also coming out on PC. Though not only do you need to be running Windows 10, you need to run the game from their own Windows store. It occurs to me that I forgot to make a thread on this, but needless to say this is better than nothing but is not a great option. There are problems with this stuff, and the entire thing just stinks of Vista and Games for Windows Live all over again.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's not all, the other consoles are getting a big exclusive each this month as well. The PS4 is getting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Mjz1RTfkU" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Ratchet and Clank</b></a>, an updated re-imagining of their first game. This is likely being made to tie-in with their upcoming movie (origin story stuff), but honestly if you aren't a kid the story doesn't matter anyway. You play these for the pretty visuals and the solid action gameplay. You are a furry space critter with a robot pal. You shoot silly aliens with space guns. The end.<br />
<br />
The Wii U is meanwhile finally getting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htMRhXPzYhY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Star Fox Zero</b></a>. People are being hard on this game, but I don't think it looks that bad. This entire series seems better for newcomers than veterans, as a similar thing happened with Star Fox 64. As a rails shooter, the gameplay doesn't change, so is most interesting when it's new to you. This entry is trying a few new things, but largely resembles the old games. I did think the gamepad integration looked bad, until they announced that because of it there will actually be a co-op mode where one player flies the ship, and another controls the turret.<br />
<br />
Finally, we are finally getting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTR_10W6Ejk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> <b>Bravely Second: End Layer</b></a> for the 3DS. Pretty sure I mentioned Europe got this already, though I haven't been following it closely enough to see what people thought of it. All anyone seems to want to talk about is being outraged by the localization changes. For anyone not aware, Bravely Second is the sequel to Bravely Default, an experimental project by Square Enix in modernizing classic rpg tropes that have gone out of fashion. The new game has a new cast and new classes.<br />
<br />
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px"><b>Spoiler</b> for <i>one of the new classes</i>: <input type="button" value="Show" style="width:45px;font-size:10px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onClick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != 'inline') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'inline'; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none';  this.value = 'Show'; }">
</div>
<div class="alt2" style="margin: 0px; padding: 6px; border: 1px inset;">
<div style="display: none;">
<br />
Put in a tag for people who want to be surprised, but I saw a video of a new &quot;cat&quot; class that I an hereby calling the Catmancer. It seems to be a mage class that uses cats to cast spells and attack. I got a laugh out of that.<br />
 
</div>
</div>
</div><br />
<br />
<br />
Not much exclusive to the PC this month, as far as I can tell. As always, the lack of a retail presence and the ability to just officially release a game at the press of the button makes anticipating upcoming releases tough. You tend to hear about things afterwards as people discover and start playing them, rather than be hyped up for something coming soon by the marketing machine. Here's what I've seen so far though:<br />
<br />
I've gone on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxANFhzfmYQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Danganronpa</b></a> soap box several times by now. The PC port of the first game was successful, and so now that second game is getting ported too. I won't go into too much details for fear of spoilers, but the sequel was better in some ways and worse in others. It does a few very clever things in defying expectations though.<br />
<br />
We might also get the next <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boG0qvGhpmY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Banner Saga</b></a> game this month, though I haven't seen any pre-release info on it. If you don't remember, this series is a nordic inspired turn-based strategy game with an old Bluth film aesthetic. The previous game was actually a little grueling, but is still a solid recommendation. They already have a solid frame work in place, so just need to make new content for the sequel.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen much about it, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWteWul9cBE" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Battlefleet Gothic: Armada</b></a> is due this month. This is a spaceship strategy game set in the Warhammer 40k universe. While more than a few have questioned if that is a thing Warhammer fans actually want, it nevertheless looks interesting for fans of space strategy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: I wanted to include a couple embedded trailers, but fell down the Youtube rabbit hole. I don't want to embed all of these into the same thread, so instead made hyperlinks to Youtube on every bolded game title mentioned above. I think I've done this once before, and just like last time, I can't promise I will do this every month. <br />
<br />
<br />
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px"><b>Spoiler</b> for <i>April releases</i>: <input type="button" value="Show" style="width:45px;font-size:10px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onClick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != 'inline') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'inline'; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none';  this.value = 'Show'; }">
