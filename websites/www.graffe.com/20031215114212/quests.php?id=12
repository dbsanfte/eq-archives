  <p>This quest is given by a Dark Elf named Dyth X`Teria in the Kunark lands 

    of 'The Overthere'. He can be found in the docktown at +3137.13, +2266.10, 

    -49.97. He is inside a small stone building. The end result is the level 39 

    spell, Concussion.</p>

  <hr noshade>

  <p align="left"><b>You say, 'hail Dyth X`Teria' </b> </p>

  <p>Dyth X`Teria appears to be the local master of wizadry. His garb clearly 

    comes from the dark city of Neriak it has an emblem of a black sun. Speak!! 

    I am dispatched from Neriak to this land by order of the king. I shall research 

    [new spells] and aid the adventuring wizards. My knowledge of wizardry is 

    offered to all in hopes of gaining information of Kunark. </p>

  <p><b>You say, 'What new spells?'</b></p>

  <p>Dyth X`Teria says 'Within this lost land could lay the knowledge of extinct 

    civilizations. I am ordered to seek this knowledge for the empire of Neriak. 

    So far all I have discovered is a way to harness a spell of my own design. 

    I call it, [Brain Bite]. </p>

  <p> <b>You say, 'what is brain bite?' </b> </p>

  <p>Dyth X`Teria says 'If you wish to own a copy of MY spell, Brain Bite. I would 

    be glad to give you one. All I ask is that you [gather a few souls] for me. 

  </p>

  <p><b>You say, 'I will gather a few souls' </b> </p>

  <p>Dyth X`Teria reveals three ornate bottles. While I finished my research of 

    Brain Bite, I encountered three [interlopers] who wished to steal my spell. 

    I had the Dragoon garrison track them down and dispatch them. Unfortunately, 

    I forgot to instruct them to trap their souls with these bottles. Do you want 

    to [take the bottles] and finish the job. </p>

  <p><b>You say, 'who interlopers' </b> </p>

  <p>Dyth X`Teria says 'The garrison report was sloppy to say the least. They 

    informed me that Hampton was slain near ruins within a jungle infested with 

    raptors. Mardon was slain within an ancient city found deep in a jungle. Ryla 

    was slain in a hidden fortress guarded by fierce armored wolves who walked 

    on their hind legs. </p>

  <p><b>You say, 'I will take the bottles.' </b> </p>

  <p>Dyth X`Teria says 'The bottles also require a gem. You will fetch me the 

    three gems and I will prepare the bottles and give them to you to finish the 

    job. I need an onyx, a peridot and a star rose quartz. </p>

  <p>So far, this is all of the info that I have found out myself or has been 
  submitted:</p>

  <ul>

    <li>The beings that need to be found are called "a human skeleton".</li>

    <li>To get the souls, do not kill the skeletons but try to hand them the 
    correct bottle (use Identify to find out which bottle is which).</li>

    <li>Some race/diety combinations are KoS (kill on sight) to the skeletons. 
    If you are KoS to the skeletons, you will need someone to charm them while 
    you hand them the correct bottle (charming can be done by an enchanter or a 
    level 49+ necromancer with Cajole Undead). Once you hand the skeleton the 
    bottle, the skeleton will vanish and in your inventory will be a new bottle 
    called "Bottle of Swirling Smoke".
    <p> <ul>

        <li><b>Hampton</b>: Found in the ruined city within Trakanon's Teeth. 
        Location is +270, -3800 (zone into TT from EJ and simply follow the left 
        zone wall the whole way). You do not need an enchanter on this leg of 
        the quest. If the 'a human skeleton' is not at the spawn point given, 
        wait for it to spawn. Someone may have killed it.</li>

      </ul>

      <p> </p>

      <p> <ul>

        <li><b>Mardon</b>: Found in The City of Mist. Mardon is a level 40-45 
        wizard and is aggro to everyone. The location of Mardon is +136.00, 
        -641.00, +76.97. This is upon the second floor of Mist and requires a 
        key (or a high level rogue with lockpick) to enter the locked chamber on 
        the first floor if you take the long way. Take a look at 
        <a href="city_of_mist.jpg?PHPSESSID=aeffdf63a783ed38893c90339f6274d0" target="_blank">
        this map</a> created for the easiest and safest path to the 'a human 
        skeleton' without the need for a rogue. Another way is to set up camp 
        near the waterfall/river and then have someone who can sense undead try 
        to target the human skeleton when it spawns up in the corner tower room. 
        A human skeleton in City of Mist has many place holders. Ranging from 
        Plague Bone Skeletons to Fog Golems. Once they successfully target the 
        human skeleton, have them swim down into the water underneath and then 
        taunt it. Taunting from this distance will work since there is no z-axis 
        (vertical) check.</li>

      </ul>

        <li><b>Ryla</b>: Found in 
        <a href="karnors_castle3.jpg?PHPSESSID=aeffdf63a783ed38893c90339f6274d0" target="_blank">
        Karnor's Castle</a>. <b>** WARNING **</b> Be careful what you kill here! 
        Killing mobs that effect Venril Sathir will ruin your chances of 
        finishing the quest! Most large Drolvargs (guards) are apprehensive and 
        will not attack unless provoked. The smaller, Drolvarg Sentry's have the 
        consider message of 'scowl' and can be killed without fear of ruining 
        your faction. Enter the castle and go over the second bridge. Turn left 
        and enter the courtyard. Go up the curved staircase. You'll come across 
        a Spectral Caller, a Sentry and a pet. Go straight to the rail and turn 
        right. Continue (East) to first door on your right, then go downstairs 
        and across the room to the door. Go straight (East) to the end, turn 
        right and go short way to the opening on your right. Turn right and go 
        to second cell on the right. Voila! For an interesting way to get this 
        bottle with a very low level rogue, click 
        <a href="rogue_ryla.htm?PHPSESSID=aeffdf63a783ed38893c90339f6274d0">here</a>.</li>

  <p align="left">Once you have all three bottled souls, return to Dyth X`Teria 
  in The Overthere outpost. Handing these three bottles to Dyth will result in 
  this:</p>

  <p align="left">Dyth X`Teria says 'Only three souls shall get you my 
  knowledge, wizard. <br>

    Dyth X`Teria empties the bottles smoke into a very large glass urn filled 
  with similar swirling smoke. You think you hear the cries of a thousand 
  tortured souls. He then closes the urn and hands you a scroll. Here is your 
  reward. It will blast a foes brain and hopefully they may forget their hatred. </p>

            Mana: 25 <br>
            Casting time: 2.0 <br>
            Effect: The spell seems to work as a wizard's form of 'evade'. It puts 

      the caster on the bottom of the mob's hate list. A good example would be 

      is when you're in a group and you overburn on the first half of the mob's 

      hit points and you agro'ed the crap out of the mob. Simply cast this spell 

      once or twice on the mob and the mob will turn to your tank or who ever 

      next on his hate list.</font><p> </td>
