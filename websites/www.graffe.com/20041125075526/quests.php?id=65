<HR>
Rexx Frostweaver says, "To ensure your worthiness you must continue to refine your prayer shawl. Speak with my wife Betti regarding the embroidered shawl and listen carefully to her words. Hurry now, there seems to be a sense of urgency about." 
<HR>
<b>You say to Betti Frostweaver, "What embroidered prayer shawl?" </b>
<HR>
Betti Frostweaver says, "It will be an honor to assist you in fashioning an embroidered shawl. It is a very demanding product and I can see from the look in your eyes that you desire to burn your sewing kit in our furnace, but if you persevere, your efforts will be richly rewarded. When you are ready you must carefully weave a spool of sacred Coldain thread. Take the thread, this pattern, and the silk shawl and carefully embroider the pattern. The result will be most exquisite. Please show me if you manage to create one."

<b>You say, "What sacred coldain thread?" </b>
<HR>
Betti Frostweaver says, "Take a woven frost giant beard, two siren’s hairs, two manticore manes and two drakkel dire wolf whiskers, and combine them in a sewing kit. The resulting thread will enhance your shawl’s power when embroidered in a special pattern." 
<HR>
Woven Frost Giant Beards can be found from various frost giants in Iceclad, Great Divide, Eastern Wastes, and in Kael(though not from the Storm Giants).<BR>
Siren Hairs are found off various Sirens in Cobalt Scar (loch of siren hair does NOT combine). <BR>
Manticore Manes can be found rarely from manticores in East Wastes. <BR>
Drakkel Dire Wolf Whiskers are found from <b>Drakkel</b> dire wolves NOT the normal dire wolves found in Iceclad and Eastern Wastes.
