<HR>
Fleshweaver T'soma says 'Ah you must be the one sent to assist me. Good. I have need of flesh for my spellwork. I wish to summon them myself! Get me three samples of flesh from these new Luggald beings. Put the samples in this Fleshthread Satchel so that they don't decay.' 
<HR>
You recieve a 4 slot container Fleshthread Satchel. 
<HR>
Journey to Dulak , as you enter Dulak from Gunthak, keep along the left wall till you find a hidden wall / secret passage into some caverns. Luggald Flesh (No Drop) is random. Seems to drop more commonly by the waterfall / temple looking area. Combine 3 pieces of Luggald Flesh and return it to Fleshweaver T'soma . 
<HR>
Fleshweaver T'soma says 'Hmm. You seem more capable than my other assistants. I have another [task] to ask of you.' 
<HR>
<b>You say ' What task? '</b>
<HR>
Fleshweaver T'soma says 'We first learned of the Luggalds through our agents on Broken Skull Rock. It appears that Innoruuk intended these servants only for the trolls. We shall see about that! Go retrieve three samples of Fecund Luggald flesh. You will need to get the flesh of those in the Crypt of Nadox this time. Here. Make sure to put them in this Fleshwoven Bag.' 
<HR>
You recieve another 4 slot container Fleshwoven Bag. 
<HR>
Head for the Crypt of Nadox, just before you get to the Undead Troll area, there is a room filled with Luggald Initiates, and Luggald Abomination, the Fecund Luggald Flesh is pretty rare, it can come from abominations or initiates. Combine the 3 pieces of Fecund Luggald Flesh and return to see Fleshweaver T'soma. 
<HR>
Fleshweaver T'soma says 'Ah, yes. These are fantastic examples. No doubt, they will ensure the success of our attempt. Now Quickly, go speak with my assistant T'so. She's prepared the ritual of summoning on the shores of Toxxulia forest. It should be far enough away if anything . . .occurs.' 
<HR>
Head for Tox forest, Assistant T'so can be found to the very north of the water, loc is roughly pos 2000 pos 1500. 
<HR>
Assistant T'so says 'You're late! Never mind. Prepare yourself. I do not trust these magics T'soma has constructed. 
<HR>
This Triggers a Giant Skeleton called Fleshless Servant. I would say its level 60, Harm Touches, Max melee of 511, occasional Rampage, Slowable with Shackle of Spirit. Beat him down and receive the item, Fleshless Heart (No Drop). Hailing T'so again will trigger another Giant Skeleton. So be careful not to go out in a blaze of harm touch. Take Your Fleshless Heart back to Fleshweaver T'soma. 
<HR>
Fleshweaver T'soma says 'So. You've come back. I hope, for your sake, you haven't returned empty handed.' 
<HR>
Turn in your Fleshless Heart. 
<HR>
Fleshweaver T'soma says 'Apparently our ignorance exceeded our luck. Ah well. I'm sure the Prince of Hate will find some other punishment for our folly. Well, since you too chance his anger I suppose you deserve a reward. Here, take this . . .though I'm not sure how much use it will be against a god.'
