Something to know before starting: <br>
One common misconception of hunting specters in Oasis is that they will life tap you. I can verify that they will not. The specters in the Feerott will life tap you though, so they aren’t as highly recommended. <br>
 <br>
Items/buffs needed: <br>
Staff of Temperate Flux (recommended, not necessary) <br>
JBoots/SoW potions <br>
Levitate <br>
KEI (recommended, not necessary) <br>
 <br>
Why hunt here: <br>
There is super fast experience and lots of platinum. <br>
The experience up to level 48 is amazing. At 48 there is about one light blue per quad and each level after that there is 1 more light blue. You can stay through 49, but I would move on.  <br>
I came at 44, but I wish I came earlier. <br>
 <br>
To test if you are of high enough level to quad kite here, pull one specter, and attempt to single quad it using CoF. This way, if you lose control, you can kill it with your single target DD, or at least you only have one specter to deal with, rather than a fleet. <br>
 <br>
Camp layout: <br>
This camp was made to be quadded. In the middle of the Oasis of Marr is a square island. At each corner of the square there is a specter. These 4 are your first quad. After those have been quadded, there are four more waiting for you in the tower. There is 1 in the center of the tower, on the first floor, and three more in the top floor of the tower. These four are going to be your second quad. <br>
 <br>
Now its time to quad: <br>
First bind yourself in the gypsy camp. This will make it easy for you to gate when you need to sell. <br>
Next med up to full, I recommend keeping levitate up and just sit over the water around the island. This way you don’t get all the aggro from the yard trash. While quadding, only the undead will attack you, but if you sit, the orcs will come after you too. If you run out of mana and are sitting to regain some and get aggroed, just kill the mob that is on you, re-slow the specters, and continue the kite.  <br>
Use your JBoots/SoW potions now, and make sure you are levitated. Before you go, shout to the newbies what you are doing, this causes less panic, and less shouts of “SPECTRES LOOSE!” 
Now run over to the first set of specters. They have an extremely small agro range, so you can get pretty close. TFlux each of the specters on the corners of the island and take them to the beach. (If you don’t have SoTF, nuke one and run by the rest to grab them.) 
With the four specters following you, head south to the beach. There is a nice open area where you can kite them here. You will notice how nice and slow they are compared to other mobs of this level, such as Spirocs. <br>
Once you have them slowed, steer clear of newbie groups and quad normally. I’ve actually had level 10 attack a specter during one of my quads and somehow he hit it. He didn’t last long. Besides that one time, they never left following me. <br>
 <br>
Once you’ve finished this first set, med up for a little while and go do the second. This one is slightly trickier to pull.  <br>
First, go into the third F9 view and move the view so you can see the specter that is in the first floor. TFlux it, and quickly go back to the first F9 view. Look up to see the other three that are in the tower. You will probably only be able to see their scythes.  <br>
Click the first one you see, then TFlux it. Circle the building TFluxing until they are following you. Stay moving because they will appear on top of you. If this happens, keep moving, and get away. Don’t gate, just resume the quad as normal. It is rare that this happens. <br>
Also, I don’t recommend the second set if you don’t have the SoTF. <br>
 <br>
Looting: <br>
Once you have slain the four specters, its time for my favorite part, the looting. Most specters drop a Globe of Fear, and a type of scythe, plus 3-5 plat. You want to keep the plain scythes, which sell for 10pp, and the bronze scythes 2pp, but the rusty scythes sell for 1gp, so don’t bother. The Globes of Fear sell for about 8gp, and I just leave them. Sometimes they drop runes which are nice, and sell for about 1-2pp if you don’t need them, and assorted gems ranging from 2-12pp per. <br>
The least amount of plat I have received in one quad here was 2pp, and the most was about 70pp. It is common to get about 25pp per quad. <br>
 <br>
Other stuff: <br>
So there you go, that’s how you quad-kite specters in Oasis. For a little extra money and experience, you can kill a level 40 mummy that terrifies the newbies named Arthikus. Careful though, he nukes and has a pet. Also, killing Sand Giants can be good for plat making. Great plat, great exp, great fun. Go kill some specters. <br>
