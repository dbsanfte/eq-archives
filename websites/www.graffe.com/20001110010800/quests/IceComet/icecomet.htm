  <p><font size="2">Let me say a few things before you read any further into this 
    quest. I have done this in two ways so I don't ruin the quest for anybody. 
    If you wish only to see the text within the book &quot;The Wheel of Tarton&quot; 
    given by Sulgar, click on 'Riddle'. If you wish to see the complete spoiler, 
    click on 'Spoiler'. If you get confused with what rods you have in your inventory, 
    you can use the identify spell on them to confirm. Good luck! - Graff&euml;<br>

  <p><font size="2">The Ice Comet Rune Quest starts by talking to Sulgar within 
    Everfrost. To find Sulgar, zone out of Blackburrow and head for the North 
    wall (loc +3033, -2393). He is standing next to two Barbarians. <i>If you 
    cannot interact with him, petition a GM to correct your beta-neutral faction. 
    If the GM will not help you, Merloc Kole of The Rathe says that all parts 
    of the Tishans Kilt Quest will up your beta-neutral faction.</i> Also, you 
    can try asking about 'Tarton Wheel' (leaving off the apostropy and the s win 
    'Tarton' and see if that helps) Once you have the rods, go back to Sulgar 
    and ask him for the chest <i>(Be sure to get the chest last for it is a NO 
    RENT item. Once you log out, the chest and everything in it will dissapear)</i> 
    which you need to combine the rods. Upon a successful combining of the rods, 
    you make two items. One is the Staff of the Wheel and the other is the Star 
    of Eyes. Either of these items you can keep (many use the staff for it's intelligence 
    bonus) or return both to Sulgar in trade for the runes.</font></p>

  <p><font size="2">This list gives the complete location of each rod that needs 
    to be found for the quest.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">1. Azia- In Erud's crossing on the deep part of the ocean 
    floor past the shipwreck infested with undead, location -1162, +2340 (one 
    user suggested levitating to find the coordinates first, then diving for it). 
    Use the best of your shields, load your fades, shadow steps and gates. Acquiring 
    this rod can get ugly. Seems that 'Killer Sharks' (level 40) inhabit this 
    area and make it very difficult to acquire the rods. Some say the sharks see 
    through invisible and some say they cannot. - <b>you have been warned</b> 
    - For even more help on this rod, I suggest looking at this <a href="erud_rod/azia.html" target="_blank">walkthru</a> 
    and also reading this <a href="Azia.zip">text file</a>.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">2. Beza- In Everfrost, within the underwater caves, it is 
    in the "house" all the way back and right in the cave, where three Ice boned 
    skeletons guard it in the center of the room. To find the hole in the ice 
    that leads to the underwater cave, goto +2420, -4060. You may or may not need 
    enduring breath for this swim depending on your swimming skill. Jump in the 
    water and swim North. Once you hit dry land inside the cave, keep right the 
    whole way until you reach the &quot;house&quot;. (mob info correction by Talisin 
    Sa`Lidar)</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">3. Caza- Lake Rathe, Underneath the first island you see is 
    an underwater tunnel leading to a stone tower, its on the top floor of the 
    tower (need enduring breath for this one). This is guarded by water goblins 
    that may attack unprovoked. Be careful for some say they can see through invisiblitly 
    also. - you have been warned - </font></p>
  <p><font size="2">4. Dena- Dagnor's Cauldron, right outside the entrance to 
    Kedge Keep. If you face with your back to Kedge Keep, it is directly diagonal 
    left, in a corner. Loc -890, -740.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">5. Ena- Lower Guk in the Reanimated hand room. This one is 
    the only one you need a group for, unless you are brave and kamakaze it. Warning: 
    depending on how your video card / colors are set up, the floor may be the 
    same color as the rod in this room and it makes it very hard to find with 
    the Hand and the dar beating on you. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2">6. Fana- Oasis is correct but the tower is underwater next 
    to the above ground tower, this one is on the top floor of the tower as well. 
    This is guarded by water goblins that may attack unprovoked. Be careful for 
    some say they can see through invisiblitly also. - you have been warned - 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2">7. Geza- Highpass Hold is correct, it is in the water near 
    the waterfall closest to the Tiger's Roar Inn, there are two waterfalls there, 
    the rod is in front of the one closest to the Inn.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">8. Heda- Erudin is wrong, it is within the Qeynos Aqueducts, 
    in the shark pit there. Some High Elves with the wrong faction may have to 
    deal with an NPC by the name of Riggin Vix, in which they may be KoS to.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">9. Izah- Neriak is correct, but it is in the water in front 
    of the bar called "The Blind Fish". The bar has four glass windows that are 
    underwater and the rod spawns right in front of those windows. (If you do 
    not know Neriak or are not welcomed there, I suggest creating a newbie Dark 
    Elf to get familiar with the waterway area, the guards, and the location of 
    the rod before attempting to grab this one. There are MANY guards that patrol 
    the bridge area but you will be safe in the water - Graff&euml;)</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">10. Jaka- It is in Unrest but not near a mob that drops dwarven 
    armor. It is in the water outside to the right of the mansion. Near where 
    the the Gnome Spelunker is. Instead of going into the tunnel that leads to 
    the Spelunker, there is a very shallow tunnel that is to the right. Within 
    that tunnel lies the rod.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2"> The Runes of Frost and Astral are NO DROP items from the 
    quest as is the scroll they make.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">Statistics on the Star of Eyes: It is a jewel that can cast 
    unlimited identify spell.<br>
    Statistics on the Staff of the Wheel are found in the picture at the top of 
    this page.</font></p>
