  <p align="center">This quest is for the key to gain access to Vex Thal. It 
  covers many of the zones in Luclin. 

  </p>

  <hr noshade>

      <p>The first part of this quest is in the ruins of Akheva. From the 
      entrance go straight through the first intersection, then right, down the 
      ramp (as if you were going to The Itraer Vius), and then left. At the 
      other end of the hall from the Itraer Vius, there is a large room with a 
      sacrificial alter at the back. </p>
  <p>Kill the monsters and sacrificial remains will spawn, which are the place 
  holder for what you are looking for - a shimmering presence.</p>
  <p>You will need a summoned wisp (lvl 4 mage spell) and an essence emerald 
  (made by a high level necromancer) for the next part.</p>
  <p>A shimmering presence's voice invades your mind. <br>
  'Shadows can not exist without light. Bring me a wisp stone so that my balance 
  can be righted by their soft glow.</p>
  <p>..:: Give the shimmering present the wisp stone. </p>
  <p>The presence will de-spawn and Spirit of Akelha `Ra will appear in its 
  place.</p>
  <p>You say, 'Hail, The Spirit of Akelha`Ra'<br>
  <br>
  The Spirit of Akelha`Ra 's hollow eyes look up at you. You have the distinct 
  impression that she can see right into the darkest shadows of your soul. She 
  opens her mouth to speak but the sounds you hear come from inside your mind. 
  'Greetings mortal, thank you for releasing me from my [tormented prison]. <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'what tormented prison'<br>
  <br>
  The Spirit of Akelha`Ra appears to be fading in and out of existence as you 
  speak to her. The spirit's voice fills your mind. 'I am Akelha`Ra, once high 
  priestess of Luclin and leader of the Akheva. This form you see before you now 
  is a fading remnant of my former existence. The storm was the cause of my 
  imprisonment in the world of undying [spirits]. <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'what spirit'<br>
  <br>
  The Spirit of Akelha`Ra says 'We Akheva are immortal entities placed in this 
  plane by the mistrees of shadow. We are her most perfect creation. Death has 
  no meaning to us, as even in death we find rebirth through the power of the 
  mistress. My imprisonment was caused by my seperation from the power of the 
  mistress by [Atenha`Ra]. It was she who sent the storm to destroy me and all 
  that followed me. '<br>
  <br>
  You say, 'who is atenha ra'<br>
  <br>
  The Spirit of Akelha`Ra says 'It is more then a little ironic that Atenha`Ra 
  is a reflection of myself. An entity created from my own consciousness, a 
  reflection of a shadow. She now holds the seat of grand power in [Vex Thal], 
  and I have not the power to gain entry to the city, let alone face her. You 
  must find my scepter that was lost in the storm to gain entry to Vex Thal. The 
  scepter has likely lost much of it's power from being shattered. Once it is 
  reassembled you will need to merge a Orb of Luclinite with a source of 
  celestial power inside the scepter. The spirits whisper that the emperor of 
  the Shissar holds the power to manipulate such energy. Be weary of him, he is 
  heralded as the slayer of gods, the defiler of realities. '<br>
  <br>
  You say, 'what Vex Thal'<br>
  <br>
  The Spirit of Akelha`Ra says 'Vex Thal is the sacred home of the Akheva. The 
  place where Luclin's power directly touches this world...ungh... I can not 
  summon the frame of my scepter in my current weakened state. I need a soul to 
  regain my pow...' As she speaks you can see her slowly fade out of existence. 
  You wonder how long her spirit will stay with this world. She seems entirely 
  unable to speak to you now, and can only muster the strength to point at the 
  ground at Gemdiver 's feet. Gemdiver reaches down a picks up a small emerald 
  off the ground, but it disappears silently into the shadows. Akelha`ra looks 
  as if she is trying to speak again. '<br>
  <br>
  This points to a Emerald Essence. Hand it in to collect the Scepter Frame that 
  will allow to reassemble the Scepter.<br>
  <br>
  You say, 'what frame of your scepter'<br>
  <br>
  The Spirit of Akelha`Ra opens her mouth to speak, but the voice in your head 
  is no longer audible. You reach forward to touch the fading shadow of a 
  creature and draw back in horror as your hand disrupts the spirit before you. 
  She evaporates into the shadows once more.</p>
  <p>The frame you receive is a 10-slot container. Inside this container you 
  must place 10 lucid shards as described obtained as described below:</p>
  <hr align="left" width="200" noShade>
  <p>Akheva shard (Dax) -  Xi Vius, Shadow Reavers, Roudy Rubble, and Shade 
  Golems,</p>
  <p>Fungus Grove shard (Dat) - Shik'Nar Warrior/Soldier/Royal Guard</p>
  <p>Grey shard (Kel) - Sun Revenants by the lake in corner</p>
  <p>Scarlet Desert shard (Set) - Sun Reavers on top of the plateau</p>
  <p>The Ssra shard (Vin) - Skeletons in the basement (try pbae for these)</p>
  <p>The Seru shard (Kelara) - Legionaires of the Hand - located in the walls 
  which surround the city and at the zone in</p>
  <p>The Deep shard (Raf) - Thought Leeches and Horrors</p>
  <p>The Maiden Eye shard (Tak) - The rarest, dropped by Goranga rares (prophet, 
  seer, chieftain, etc)</p>
  <p>The Dawnshroud shard (Lor) - Rockhoppers in the cave<br>
  <br>
  Acrylia shard (Ved) - Grimling Skullcrackers, you can find them by the gate 
  most of the time.<br>
 </p>
  <hr align="left" width="200" noShade>
  <p>Combining the ten shards inside your frame will yield a reassembled scepter 
  which is a 2-slot container. Place an orb of luclinite (dropped by most Luclin 
  bosses) and a planes rift (dropped by Emperor Ssraeshza) inside, and combine. 
  Congratulations you have completed your Scepter of the Shadows, and can enter 
  Vex Thal.</p>
