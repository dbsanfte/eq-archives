However, there are still two reasons you might want to do this quest. First, it will improve your PoP charm, and second, the reward item is an indoor usable insta-click item.</p>
                                                                                
<p>The quest comes from Grimror Plaguebringer, an Ogre who roams near the front
of the Plane of Disease. When you talk to him, the following conversation ensues:</p>
                                                                                
<b>You say, 'Hail, Grimror Plaguebringer'</b><br>
Grimror Plaguebringer says 'Grimror no have time ta talk. Gots stuffs ta do.'<Br>
<b>You say, 'What stuffs?'</b><BR>
Grimror Plaguebringer says 'I wuz sent here by Zulort to, err. . . To gadder some alchemy type stuffs. Him have big plan, and need me to travel lots.'<BR>

<b>You say, 'What big plans?'</b><BR>
Grimror Plaguebringer says 'You gonna help Grimror or no?'<BR>
<b>You say, 'I will help Grimror'</b><BR>
Grimror Plaguebringer says 'Dat good! Grimror been getting compon ents for dayz
now and Grimror still not finushed. You gonna get dem tings fur me?'<BR>
<b>You say, 'What tings?'</b><BR>
Grimror Plaguebringer says 'Grimror need bile, dat stuff es strong here! But Grimror keent seem to git eet all. Bile comz from da leetle bugs. Keel little bugs, and geeve Grimror dere leetel bodiez and Grimror give yuuz anyting dat yuuz want. Dere on four leetel buggiez dat Grimror still neez, two uf dem come from da fliez, one comez from da wurmiez, and one comez from the moss-skeeterz. Yuuz bring Grimror dere lavas and Grimror geeve yuuz, and yuuz freends, anyting yuuz want.'<BR>

<P>The information he gives about the items dropping from flies and mosquitos is incorrect. The mobs you need are all worms, specifically, the four mobs are sengian, harrion, scaevian, and generian larva. They each drop a different larva flesh which is used for the quest.</p>
                                                                                
PH for Harrion larva = a malarian larva (not larvae like all the others, spawns
near zone in with the flies)<BR>
PH for Generian larva = a planarian larva (again just larva, spawns east of castle, east of river near pusling camps)<BR>
PH for Scaevian larva = a Tsetsian Pupa (just pupa, not pupal, spawns east of generian)<BR>
PH for Sengian larva = a blarian larva (near Scaevian/Generian)<BR>
                                                                                
<p>Once you have all four larva flesh pieces, take them back to Grimror and turn them in to him. The pieces can be multiquested. The entire group will get a flag for Crypt of Decay (and the corresponding improvement in their PoP charm), and the last person to turn in a flesh will receive <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=9294">a Bangle of Disease Warding</a>.</p>
