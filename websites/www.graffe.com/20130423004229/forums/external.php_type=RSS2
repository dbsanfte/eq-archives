			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I'm surprised that nobody has made a thread about this yet, especially considering the MMO cross-over, and the general lack of sci-fi on TV.<br />
<br />
I watched the two-part pilot last night and was pleasantly surprised. Though I believe this project may turn out to be too ambitious (and costly) for SyFy, unless they scale the production value way back.<br />
<br />
The game, on the other hand, has been getting pretty mediocre reviews. That's unfortunate because it starts (chronologically) before the series and may provide a better introduction into its world. In particular, the Arkfall and the different alien races aren't really properly explained in the pilot, imo.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else watched the beginning of the series and/or tried the game?</div>

<br />
Anything other than a simple desktop that she can recognize puts her into panic attack freak out mode. How do I turn off the starting tile screen and make Win8 just startup in plain old Desktop mode, ala what Windows7 looks like? The closer I can get it to behave like Win7 the easier my life will be.<br />
<br />
I dont own anything with Win8 and have limited time figuring out how to reconfigure the machine on my own. Point me in a direction to reconfigure it (I looked at it for a couple minutes and I couldnt figure out how to even get to the control panel... omg my initial impression is that it is TERRIBLE).</div>

			Looks like there are more troubled waters at ABC's Splash. On Thursday, April 18 -- two days after Katherine Webb quit the show because of an injury -- Baywatch alum Nicole Eggert back-flopped into the pool and was rushed to the hospital, TMZ reports.<br />
<br />
Sources tell the site that Eggert, 41, was attempting to complete a complicated high-dive involving multiple back-flips. However, something went wrong mid-air, and she ended up crashing hard into the pool, back-first. According to TMZ, on-site EMTs pulled her out of the water and took her to a nearby ER to be examined.<br />
<br />
The actress doesn't seem to have been seriously injured in the fall, but doctors reportedly wanted to monitor her condition to ensure that there were no hidden internal injuries. She was released from the hospital after a few hours.<br />
<br />
&quot;The ER is always fun,&quot; she tweeted later.<br />
<br />
Eggert is not the first celebrity to be hurt on the show. Webb left the competition earlier this week because of a back injury, Chuy Bravo bowed out after fracturing his heel during practice, and Rory Bushfield has been diving with a ruptured eardrum -- against doctor recommendations.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>It seems the top reason to even watch this show is for the accidents.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>A co-worker gave me a movie to watch, in his defense he himself hadnt watched it yet. I started it and was caught in a mix of disbelief between a rediculously stupid story, terrible acting and sheer pointlessness (the intro to the film even goes so far as to start off explaining how pointless a movie can be). The films directors really didnt have a way to end the movie, so they attempted to kill off the audience, but unfortunately one person was left alive so the movie had to continue ... and meander pointlessly. <br />
<br />
My vote for the single worst move I've ever (mostly) seen is : <br />
<br />
Rubber.<br />

<br />
Its one of the worst train-wrecks in slow motion captured on film I've ever believed possible. You cannot believe how bad it is... how stupid it is... and when you think it cannot get worse, it does! It takes &quot;terrible&quot; to a whole new meaning. After venting to my co-worker about it, I forced him to watch it, this was our conversation last night:<br />

<br />
<br />
The world could be heading for a major economic crisis as stock markets inflate an investment bubble in fossil fuels to the tune of trillions of dollars, according to leading economists.<br />
<br />
&quot;The financial crisis has shown what happens when risks accumulate unnoticed,&quot; said Lord (Nicholas) Stern, a professor at the London School of Economics. He said the risk was &quot;very big indeed&quot; and that almost all investors and regulators were failing to address it.<br />
<br />
The so-called &quot;carbon bubble&quot; is the result of an over-valuation of oil, coal and gas reserves held by fossil fuel companies. According to a report published on Friday, at least two-thirds of these reserves will have to remain underground if the world is to meet existing internationally agreed targets to avoid the threshold for &quot;dangerous&quot; climate change. If the agreements hold, these reserves will be in effect unburnable and so worthless – leading to massive market losses. But the stock markets are betting on countries' inaction on climate change.<br />
<br />
The stark report is by Stern and the thinktank Carbon Tracker. Their warning is supported by organisations including HSBC, Citi, Standard and Poor's and the International Energy Agency. The Bank of England has also recognised that a collapse in the value of oil, gas and coal assets as nations tackle global warming is a potential systemic risk to the economy, with London being particularly at risk owing to its huge listings of coal.<br />
<br />
Stern said that far from reducing efforts to develop fossil fuels, the top 200 companies spent $674bn (£441bn) in 2012 to find and exploit even more new resources, a sum equivalent to 1% of global GDP, which could end up as &quot;stranded&quot; or valueless assets. Stern's landmark 2006 report on the economic impact of climate change – commissioned by the then chancellor, Gordon Brown – concluded that spending 1% of GDP would pay for a transition to a clean and sustainable economy.<br />
<br />
The world's governments have agreed to restrict the global temperature rise to 2C, beyond which the impacts become severe and unpredictable. But Stern said the investors clearly did not believe action to curb climate change was going to be taken. &quot;They can't believe that and also believe that the markets are sensibly valued now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They only believe environmental regulation when they see it,&quot; said James Leaton, from Carbon Tracker and a former PwC consultant. He said short-termism in financial markets was the other major reason for the carbon bubble. &quot;Analysts say you should ride the train until just before it goes off the cliff. Each thinks they are smart enough to get off in time, but not everyone can get out of the door at the same time. That is why you get bubbles and crashes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul Spedding, an oil and gas analyst at HSBC, said: &quot;The scale of 'listed' unburnable carbon revealed in this report is astonishing. This report makes it clear that 'business as usual' is not a viable option for the fossil fuel industry in the long term. [The market] is assuming it will get early warning, but my worry is that things often happen suddenly in the oil and gas sector.&quot;<br />
<br />
HSBC warned that 40-60% of the market capitalisation of oil and gas companies was at risk from the carbon bubble, with the top 200 fossil fuel companies alone having a current value of $4tn, along with $1.5tn debt.<br />
<br />
Lord McFall, who chaired the Commons Treasury select committee for a decade, said: &quot;Despite its devastating scale, the banking crisis was at its heart an avoidable crisis: the threat of significant carbon writedown has the unmistakable characteristics of the same endemic problems.&quot;<br />
<br />
The report calculates that the world's currently indicated fossil fuel reserves equate to 2,860bn tonnes of carbon dioxide, but that just 31% could be burned for an 80% chance of keeping below a 2C temperature rise. For a 50% chance of 2C or less, just 38% could be burned.<br />
<br />
Carbon capture and storage technology, which buries emissions underground, can play a role in the future, but even an optimistic scenario which sees 3,800 commercial projects worldwide would allow only an extra 4% of fossil fuel reserves to be burned. There are currently no commercial projects up and running. The normally conservative International Energy Agency has also concluded that a major part of fossil fuel reserves is unburnable.<br />
<br />
Citi bank warned investors in Australia's vast coal industry that little could be done to avoid the future loss of value in the face of action on climate change. &quot;If the unburnable carbon scenario does occur, it is difficult to see how the value of fossil fuel reserves can be maintained, so we see few options for risk mitigation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ratings agencies have expressed concerns, with Standard and Poor's concluding that the risk could lead to the downgrading of the credit ratings of oil companies within a few years.<br />
<br />
Steven Oman, senior vice-president at Moody's, said: &quot;It behoves us as investors and as a society to know the true cost of something so that intelligent and constructive policy and investment decisions can be made. Too often the true costs are treated as unquantifiable or even ignored.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jens Peers, who manages €4bn (£3bn) for Mirova, part of €300bn asset managers Natixis, said: &quot;It is shocking to see the report's numbers, as they are worse than people realise. The risk is massive, but a lot of asset managers think they have a lot of time. I think they are wrong.&quot; He said a key moment will come in 2015, the date when the world's governments have pledged to strike a global deal to limit carbon emissions. But he said that fund managers need to move now. If they wait till 2015, &quot;it will be too late for them to take action.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pension funds are also concerned. &quot;Every pension fund manager needs to ask themselves have we incorporated climate change and carbon risk into our investment strategy? If the answer is no, they need to start to now,&quot; said Howard Pearce, head of pension fund management at the Environment Agency, which holds £2bn in assets.<br />
<br />
Stern and Leaton both point to China as evidence that carbon cuts are likely to be delivered. China's leaders have said its coal use will peak in the next five years, said Leaton, but this has not been priced in. &quot;I don't know why the market does not believe China,&quot; he said. &quot;When it says it is going to do something, it usually does.&quot; He said the US and Australia were banking on selling coal to China but that this &quot;doesn't add up&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jeremy Grantham, a billionaire fund manager who oversees $106bn of assets, said his company was on the verge of pulling out of all coal and unconventional fossil fuels, such as oil from tar sands. &quot;The probability of them running into trouble is too high for me to take that risk as an investor.&quot; He said: &quot;If we mean to burn all the coal and any appreciable percentage of the tar sands, or other unconventional oil and gas then we're cooked. [There are] terrible consequences that we will lay at the door of our grandchildren.&quot;

Thomas Herndon, Excel sleuth.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Most Ph.D. students spend their days reading esoteric books and stressing out about the tenure-track job market. Thomas Herndon, a 28-year-old economics grad student at UMass Amherst, just used part of his spring semester to shake the intellectual foundation of the global austerity movement.<br />
 <br />
Herndon became instantly famous in nerdy economics circles this week as the lead author of a recent paper, &quot;Does High Public Debt Consistently Stifle Economic Growth? A Critique of Reinhart and Rogoff,&quot; that took aim at a massively influential study by two Harvard professors named Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff.  Herndon found some hidden errors in Reinhart and Rogoff's data set, then calmly took the entire study out back and slaughtered it. Herndon's takedown — which first appeared in a Mike Konczal post that crashed its host site with traffic — was an immediate sensation. It was cited by prominent anti-austerians like Paul Krugman, spoken about by incoming Bank of England governor Mark Carney, and mentioned on CNBC and several other news outlets as proof that the pro-austerity movement is based, at least in part, on bogus math.<br />
 <br />
We spoke to Herndon about his crazy week, and how he's planning to celebrate his epic wonk takedown.<br />
 <br />
<br />
&quot;This week has been quite the week,&quot; Herndon told us in a phone call from UMass Amherst's campus. &quot;Honestly, I was not expecting at all the kind of attention it has received.&quot;<br />
 <br />
<br />
Herndon, who did his undergraduate study at Evergreen State College, first started looking into Reinhart and Rogoff's work as part of an assignment for an econometrics course that involved replicating the data work behind a well-known study. Herndon chose Reinhart and Rogoff's 2010 paper, &quot;Growth in a Time of Debt,&quot; in part, because it has been one of the most politically influential economic papers of the last decade. It claims, among other things, that countries whose debt exceeds 90 percent of their annual GDP experience slower growth than countries with lower debt loads — a figure that has been cited by people like Paul Ryan and Tim Geithner to justify slashing government spending and implementing other austerity measures on struggling economies.<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
Before he turned in his report, Herndon repeatedly e-mailed Reinhart and Rogoff to get their data set, so he could compare it to his own work. But because he was a lowly graduate student asking favors of some of the most respected economists in the world, he got no reply, until one afternoon, when he was sitting on his girlfriend's couch.<br />
 <br />
<br />
&quot;I checked my e-mail, and saw that I had received a reply from Carmen Reinhart,&quot; he says. &quot;She said she didn't have time to look into my query, but that here was the data, and I should feel free to publish whatever results I found.&quot;<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Herndon pulled up an Excel spreadsheet containing Reinhart's data and quickly spotted something that looked odd.<br />
 <br />
<br />
&quot;I clicked on cell L51, and saw that they had only averaged rows 30 through 44, instead of rows 30 through 49.&quot;<br />
 <br />
<br />
What Herndon had discovered was that by making a sloppy computing error, Reinhart and Rogoff had forgotten to include a critical piece of data about countries with high debt-to-GDP ratios that would have affected their overall calculations. They had also excluded data from Canada, New Zealand, and Australia — all countries that experienced solid growth during periods of high debt and would thus undercut their thesis that high debt forestalls growth.<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
Herndon was stunned. As a graduate student, he'd just found serious problems in a famous economic study — the academic equivalent of a D-league basketball player dunking on LeBron James. &quot;They say seeing is believing, but I almost didn’t believe my eyes,&quot; he says. &quot;I had to ask my girlfriend — who's a Ph.D. student in sociology — to double-check it. And she said, 'I don't think you're seeing things, Thomas.'&quot;<br />
 <br />
<br />
The mistakes Herndon found were so big, in fact, that even Herndon's professors didn't believe him at first. As Reuters reported earlier:<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;At first, I didn't believe him. I thought, 'OK he's a student, he's got to be wrong. These are eminent economists and he's a graduate student,'&quot; [UMass Amherst professor Robert] Pollin said. &quot;So we pushed him and pushed him and pushed him, and after about a month of pushing him I said, 'Goddamn it, he's right.'&quot;<br />
 <br />
<br />
After consulting his professors, Herndon signed two of them — Pollin and department chair Michael Ash — on as co-authors, and the three of them quickly put together a paper outlining their findings. The paper cut to the core of a debate that has been dividing economists and politicians for decades. Fans of austerity believe that governments should cut spending in order to grow their economies, while anti-austerians believe that government spending in times of economic duress can create growth and reduce unemployment, even if it increases debt in the short term. What Herndon et al. were claiming, in essence, was that the pro-austerity movement was relying on bogus information.<br />
 <br />
<br />
When Herndon and his professors published their study, the reaction was nearly immediate. After Konczal's blog post went viral, Reinhart and Rogoff — who got a fawning New York Times profile when their book was released — were forced to admit their embarrassing error (although they still defended the basic findings of their survey). And today, another UMass Amherst professor, Arindrajit Dube, followed up on Herndon's paper with additional proof that there were serious theoretical and causal problems (as opposed to just sloppy Excel work) in the Reinhart-Rogoff study. Observers have been raising serious questions about what Herndon's work means for the future of austerity politics, and Reinhart and Rogoff's respectability as scholars.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Herndon says he isn't implying that Reinhart and Rogoff intentionally skewed their data to support a pro-austerity finding, and simply reported the errors.<br />
 <br />
<br />
&quot;I don’t want to sound the alarm and call for anyone’s jobs,&quot; he says. &quot;I didn’t do this to be punitive or malicious.&quot;<br />
 <br />
<br />
With Reinhart and Rogoff's once-authoritative work now under serious question, there's no question that the austerity movement has been dealt a major blow. But Herndon's finding won't likely stop politicians from trying to reduce the deficit. The global march for austerity began before Reinhart and Rogoff's work was published, and will continue as long as there are people who believe that governments can shrink their way to prosperity.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Still, Herndon holds out hope. He calls austerity policies in the United Kingdom and elsewhere &quot;counterproductive,&quot; and implies that part of why he took up the study of Reinhart and Rogoff's study was to question the benefits of current economic policy. &quot;I have social motivations,&quot; he says. &quot;I care deeply about how policy affects people.&quot;<br />
 <br />
<br />
Now that he's left his mark, Herndon says he's coping with the effects of academic celebrity — getting a new publicity head shot taken, receiving kudos from his professors and colleagues, handling interview requests. He says he's gotten extensions on some of his papers in order to handle his quasi-fame, but that he hasn't been popping Champagne yet in celebration.<br />
 <br />
<br />
&quot;I’m going to celebrate this weekend,&quot; he says. &quot;But for now, I have a really gnarly problem set.&quot;<br />
 <br />

<br />
The basic idea is that Ubisoft is making a stand-alone DLC for Far Cry 3 that reskins the game to give it an 80's Sci-fi aesthetic. They extended this to a brilliant marketing scheme whereby each promotional video is spoofing the 80's. The promotional clips all suffer from poor video quality and the kind of scan lines you would see in a VHS recording. I particularly love how the game takes place in the &quot;future&quot; world of 2007. Brilliant.<br />
