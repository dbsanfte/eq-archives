<br><br><hr>
<p>Greetings and Salutations! This is Izzuan Frozensoul, Erudite Wizard and Master of the Three Forces of Chaos...yes I say three for do we not control three mighty forces of destructive chaos? At any rate, I'll get into those later, but for now let this suffice...Fire, the Great Destroyer; Ice, the Mighty Slayer; and pure sheer mana, taking the form most often of Lightning. 

<p>Through the control and manipulation of these great forces of chaos, the wizard immolates his foes, locks them within icey tombs, or cooks them like a piece of toast left too long upon the stove. But great care must be taken when manipulating these forces, for as many of the ancestors of our craft learned, when unbalanced this triad of power will devour the aspiring wizard, instead of his enemies. 

<p>The first thing we must consider is race. Out of the races upon Norrath, there are some that are adept at practicing The Craft, and fewer still that truly belong TO The Craft. I will only be going over the important foreighn races, for surely all know that in all things arcane Erudites are indeed superior, and in The Craft Frogloks are less than worth mentioning.

<p><b>I) Humans:</b><br>
Human beings are your traditional jack of all trades master of none. the ancestors of my own fine race, they deserve some respect for the simple fact that with all of the other superior races around they have still managed to adapt and change, keeping up with all other races. They have sub-standard intellegence, all though physically they are more capable than most other wizarding races. Even with that, minor, benefit the continuation of Humankinds wizarding schools should be monitored closely, and if it looks like they begin to advance too rapidly they should be shut down immediately.

<p><b>II) Teir'Dal:</b><br>
Far surpassing human beings, the Teir'Dal are indeed a powerfull race. They are quick and agile, they are sly and cunning as well as dangerous as a rudely awakened Council Member, which is to say deadly my friends. Of any opposing race I could hope our dear beloved country could oppose, I am most happy that it is the Teir'Dal nation. For only their wizards truly begin to compare with our own. Even more amazing is the fact that they spurn their wizards, as if they were an unsightly growth. It is most fascinating, and I recommend that it be watched very carefully. For if they were ever to make amends, and their society fully embrace The Craft much would be at risk.

<p><b>III) High Elves:</b><br>
The lighter skinned cousins of the Teir'Dal. As noble as a paladin, as heroic as a warrior, and as skilled as an Erudite. Yes, they are a Mighty race. But their wizardly worship of Tunare is perplexing. Tunare directly opposes the Lord Ro, who as we all know, is not only the "supposed patron of wizardry" but allo frowns upon Ice, the very domain of the Frozen One, E'Ci. Very perplexing indeed. All in all, not a terribly bad race to be...if your forced into it. of course, if I had not been blessed and been an Erudite, I would have hoped to have been a Teir'Dal...

<p><b>IV) Gnomes:</b><br>
Ah..the Gnomes. Knee high, and smellin of axle grease and old socks, you might not think much about these short wizened creatures. But do not be deceived! Gnomes are even more crafty than a Teir'Dal, if that is indeed possible. The gnomes have repositories of Arcane lore that stretch back to long before the beginnings of my race were made my the Twins Marr.  I did much studying there before certain events forced my immediate retreat from Ak'Annon on a permanent basis. Gnomes are hardy, and their tough, and their size allows them to get into places I could never even dream of. but, this same size allso makes a dangerous problem. To an ogre they are a snack, and to a dragon they are an easily eaten morsel.
<br><br><hr><br>
<p><b>Of the Gods:</b><br>
In this Treatise, I will speak of three gods, specifically the gods that any erudite Wizard worth anything will know of by heart, and make donations and homage to on a regular basis. But be Forewarned: You must balance this triad just like you do the triad of power, for any one of these may strip you of your power at a time when you need it most for your insolence of excluding any of them from your worship. 

<p><b>I) Solusek Ro, The Prince of Flames:</b><br>
The "patron god of wizardry", and god representing the First Force of Chaos: Fire. He is a mighty god, and his power was enough to drive the mountains into the sky, enough to drive the elves from the very continent of Tunaria now known as Antonica. He is a wise choice, but not neccessarily the best. His followers seek power, and they do not care who gets hurt in their way. Friends, family, doesnt matter. If you get in their way, or if they think you are getting in their way, then you WILL be removed. And Solusek WILL burn you, for you cannot handle fire without getting burned at least once. But all it takes is one burn for it to be fatal. Pay Homage to the Burning Lord, but do not worship him exclusively, for that path will only end in darkness and destruction.

<p><b>II) Prexus, The Ocean Lord</b><br>
Ahh, the Lord of The Seas. Without his blessing, no trade would make it to our shores, and would not all life on this planet end, for do not all waters flow to and from the seas themselves? If he were to remove his blessing from the wizards, E'Ci would not be able to do nearly as much, for there would be no water to freeze. But verily be warned, Prexus is another enemy of Solusek's, and you must balance them carefully lest you anger one, or both, of them. while Solusek could scorch the world into an uninhabitable wasteland, Prexus could drown us all, making life nearly impossible for all save us, who are used to living from the sea itself.

<p><b>III) Quellulious, The Tranquil</b><br>
Now we come to the Deity that I worship. The Tranquil. She seems weak, she seems passive and harmless. She looks like a small child. But as any wizard knows, looks are usually very deceiving. The Tranquil brings peace of mind, she brings stability to the Chaos. For as wizards, we are the eye of the storm, we are the calm in the middle of the fury. we must be able to keep cool at all times, we must be able to focus on the task at hand. And further more, to any and everyone who accuses The Tranquil of being a non combatant, to any who accuse the True Goddess of Knowledge of being a mistake to worship, let me reveal a few secrets. The Tranquil allows you to follow your own inner path to power. Solusek requires you to follow his flaming footsteps, and more often than not those shoes are a good bit too large to fill. The Tranquil asks only that you do what you will. She asks that you follow the path that feels right to you. She asks that you find peace inside of yourself, and with that peace she gives you power that not even the Burning Prince can equal. 

<p>In closing, I say only this:
<p>The gods and races on this world are varied and vast. The lands we walk become ever the more perilous every day that we trod them, and I wish only that you take the Tranquil's blessings, The Burning Lords strength, and The Oceanlords wisdom with you wherever you may travel. Good day, and may your tomes never be locked or missing.</td></tr></table></body></html>
