This statement is true in location only. With the new group bonuses it is far better exp to make a group of 2-3 necros, and fill the rest of the spots with wizards and mages, sit on our horses and nuke as the necros pull non-stop. In an average group you can get 4 AA per hour, 6 AA in a good group, which is about 2-3x what you would get from quadding.</td></tr></table></body></html>
