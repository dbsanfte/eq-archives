          the reason for the lack of updates. I have not been able to read any 
          e-mail since Wednesday, but I should be able to do a few updates come 
          Monday. Right now, I'm updating via a telnet session and handwriting 
          the html about 200 miles from home on the folk's computer (rudimentary 
          as heck.. but I had to say hello and Merry Christmas to you all). I 
          really apologize for the extreme lack of updates but I hope you all 
          understand my computer problems at this time. Thank you all and be sure 
          to put in some EQ time for me... I'm going into withdrawals.</p>

          <img src="purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="9">Well, I'm not dead.... 
          but my home computer is. Really odd thing happened. Sunday I was in 
          game and zoning through Neriak Commons when my girlfriend was printing 
          to the printer connected to my computer (small lan at home). I crashed 
          to my desktop and eqgame.exe would not restart for the life of it. I 
          deleted eqgame.exe and repatched (which will download a brand new eqgame.exe). 
          Still nothing. Tried all kinds of things.. finally formatted. No luck 
          either... now it's hardware I figure. Vid card - nope. Sound card - 
          nope. Lan card 1 - nope. Land card 2 - nope. Ram - nope. Get a new processor 
          - &quot;This motherboard cannot handle the power requirements this Pentium 
          class processor requires&quot; (mb is only four months old I might add). 
          Gotta love smart mb's though. Now I'm looking for someone that has the 
          motherboard I am after and it is in very high demand right now so it 
          looks like I have a few days until I may have one.</p>

          this yet.. there is a pretty funny cartoon on EverCrest. Have a look

          Povar sent in this <a href="../screenpics/Grimfeather.jpg" target="_blank">screenpic</a> 
          of GrimFeather. If you don't know who GrimFeather is, he's a rare spawn 
          Griffon that roams North Karana. He is fast and he hits rather quick 
          also.. I know first hand. A while back a friend and guildmate of mine, 
          Uther, needed a portal to North Karana. I said no problem and took him 
          there. When we arrived, I asked what he was up to. He said he was after 
          GrimFeather with a friend of his (that had just died to Grim before 
          we portaled in). I asked if he wanted help looking for him and he said 
          sure. I fired off my Jboots and headed to the tallest hill near the 
          spires. Got on top of the hill and cast Magnify on myself. Searched 
          the plains and found GrimFeather off in the distance. Ran over to him 
          and fired off my Staff of Temperate Flux. He took the bait and I started 
          running for the spires. Gsay'd &quot;Got him. Pulling to spires.. INC!&quot;. 
          Then a few of these hit my screen, &quot;GrimFeather claws you for 83 
          points of damage - You are stunned! - You are stunned!&quot;. Followed 
          by me saying &quot;Owiee.&quot; and then finally &quot;Returning to 
          homepoint&quot;. Moral of the story - Wizards should not be big game 
          pullers.<br>
          By the way... thanks for the pic Finny!</p>

        <p><img src="purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="9">Endymion of Xegony 
          wrote a rant article that is a reply/addition to the Plane of Fear article 
          found on EQ Casters Realm written by Kalyn of Xegony. Click <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/editorials/pof.asp" target="_blank">here</a> 
          to read the article from EQC then read below for Endymion's response:<br>
          Endymion<i> - &quot;Okay admitted this is biased since I'm a wizard 
          but I wanted to say one other thing about making Fear so hideous. When 
          you have a zone with risks like this people don't want to do them. That 
          means that Paladins (well them less than others since there's 2 billion 
          fetid fiends in the zone), Druids, Necromancers, Wizards (funny, 3 classes 
          verant doesn't seem to like...), and Rangers, are out of luck. If I 
          was an Enchanter or Magician I could have been on a few dozen Hate runs 
          since it came out. On the other hand, unlike the nightly Hate runs, 
          I've only been on 2 fear runs, not to mention that (sorry another wiz 
          gripe) the Frightfingers are so few in number and far and away that 
          they're often not pulled before everyone goes to bed.</i></p>
        <p><i>Another question to Verant on caster armor: Planes armor has been 
          shown to be the greatest armor in the game, all the thorny vine armor 
          is the best for a ranger to wear, all the valorium is best for a paladin 
          (minus red dragonscale), etc. So my question is, why does more than 
          half the caster armor have ridiculously pathetic stats? The froglok 
          skin mask is better than the cryosilk veil! An easy wizard quest item 
          (runescale cloak) is FAR superior to the pathetic Cryosilk Cloak. I 
          wouldn't even mind if the darn things were +7 to 2 useless stats, but 
          they give negligable mana, worthless resistances, negligable ac, VERY 
          little int (1 or 2), and only 1 or 2 to another useless stat.</i></p>
        <p><i>Oh and long as I'm ranting, wizards got the shaft in the class specific 
          gloves... enchanters got higher int from their gloves and a huge bonus 
          to their other prime stat, charisma. Magicians got mor int than wizards. 
          Wizards got a very small bonus to stamina.</i></p>
        <p><i>Well while this turned into a fear, its equipment, and how it relates 
          to wizards rant, I just want to say this: <br>
          -There's a reason noone wants to go to fear, but will go to hate which 
          should be equally difficult. Wake up Verant. <br>
          -How many level 50 Necros, Enchanters, Magicians, and Clerics do you 
          see playing their characters still? How many Druids and Wizards never 
          touch their 50s anymore and started new characters (myself with a Paladin)? 
          <br>
          -Endymion Lunarmyst, the Ranting Level 50 Wizard, Xegony&quot;</i><br>
          Thanks Endymion. If anyone has things to voice, you can do so on the 
          <a href="http://www.vestris.com/db-cgi/vac/agnes?GrafferantAgnes+GrafferantAgnesHTML">Rant

          Hello everyone, this is Cypren. A lot of you have written me recently 
          with questions on Specialization and Research (especially research practice), 
          and I’ve not answered them individually because I’ve been working on 
          a FAQ that will hopefully explain these two topics in greater detail. 
          I’m hoping to have it posted by the end of the week, so if you have 
          sent in a question on either of these topics (or were planning to) please 
          hang in there, the answers will be coming. Thanks!<br>

          been dragging my feet, throwing the idea around to a couple friends 
          about creating t-shirts to help pay for the site and it's ever-growing 
          needs. It seems a good friend, Keiote, got tired of me saying &quot;Man, 
          they won't sell&quot; so he posted to the message board today to force 
          me to do so. I dislike being a charity case, so I figured at least with 
          the t-shirts everyone would benefeit from them. I created a small page 
          with a quick sample of an idea I had for a slogan on the shirt. I just 
          need to know if there is enough of you out there that are interested 
          in the t-shirts and if it is worth the effort to have some created. 
          If you can do me a favor, check out the shirt and submit on the poll, 
          it would give me some feedback so I can move forward with it or scrap 
          the idea. Thanks a bunch!</p>

          <img src="purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="9">With the recent upgrade 
          to Paw, I have received a few interesting pics of items from within. 
          Many are finding 'Tan Split Paw Skins' that look like spells not yet 
          scribed. These are merely parchments that the inhabitants of Split Paw 
          have written the accounts of their takeover on. Here is a <a href="../screenpics/pawdocuments/fear_not_my_brethren.jpg" target="_blank">screenpic</a> 
          of what it looks like if you are able to read Gnoll. Thanks to Eantos 
          of Xegony for sending in the pics. (I have lots.. no need to send more 
          of them ::smile::)</p>
        <p><img src="purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="9">Rarely will I post 
          to this site concerning dealings that happen to me as a player or to 
          my friends, but I wish to take a second to say that there is a person 
          on my server of Xegony that should rot in his own greed. I logged on 
          yesterday to find one of our best role-players, Gamgan, in our guildsay 
          half-in and half-out of character. It is very, very rare for Gamgan 
          (our mercenary Troll) to be out of character and if you know him, you 
          will know what I mean. I knew something was terribly wrong and wished 
          to know what happened. It seems a friend of our guild, named Faunas 
          - a cleric, had been camping a mob in High Hold for more than seven 
          hours during her quest for the Testament of Vanear. Finally, the mob 
          shows up and a person that I will leave unnamed comes out from invisibility 
          and kill steals it from under her nose (just to clarify, this unnamed 
          person is not a wizard). This is not the first time this person has 
          kill stole from others on the server so I don't feel bad writing about 
          it. I wish to leave this person unnamed for I know there is one thing 
          worse than anything I could ever do unto them.... and that is a little 
          thing called 'karma'. Faunas is a very well liked person on Xegony and 
          for this to happen to her is simply not right. For the unnamed kill 
          stealer, remember one thing... the people you kill steal from are not 
          merely characters. They are people. People with feelings... and you 
          just made one of the best people on Xegony severely discouraged. May 
          karma knock on your door sometime soon. If you wish to read more on 
          the subject, you can head over to the <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/board.asp?brd=5030" target="_blank">EQVault's 
          Xegony board</a>. There is quite the list going on the subject there. 
          I'll leave you to find it for yourself only because there is some language 
          and some 'paybacks' that I do not condone. </p>

          <img src="purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="9">Did anybody catch GZ's 
          comment on the aggrivation level of mobs to us when we hit for partial 
          damage? I got a kick out of his reply so I'll post it here:<br>
          <font color="#FFFFFF">?:</font> Why are NPC aggro values calculated 
          on potential damage vs. actual inflicted damage? It severely limits 
          our abilities to cast multiple times on "red" cons past the 1.2 or 5 
          level limit when getting many resists. <br>
          <font color="#FFFFFF">GZ:</font> MOBS always look at potential damage 
          - even vs. warrior types. Which would you shoot first in Quake - the 
          guy with the BFG or the guy with the machine gun? Obviously the guy 
          who can kill you the quickest. :) </p>
