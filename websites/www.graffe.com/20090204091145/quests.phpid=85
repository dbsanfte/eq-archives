<HR>
<b>You say, 'hail Svekk Fangbinder' </b>
<HR>
Svekk Fangbinder says 'Greetings, Korteal. I am Svekk, a humble servant of Wenglawks. It is my job to keep track of the supplies here. I also sell mundane wares.
<HR>
<b>You say, 'what supplies?'</b>
<HR>
Svekk Fangbinder says 'We have all kinds of supplies! Normally we deliver them to the giants who live outside Kael. 
<HR>
<b>You say, 'what giants?' </b>
<HR>
Svekk Fangbinder says 'There are several encampments in the eastern wastes that barter for supplies with us monthly. The great divide also has a small outpost of Kromrif who strive to beat the Coldain back into their city of Thurgadin and of course the outposts in the wakening lands. Our last batch of deliveries did not reach their intended targets. The runners have not been heard from since they were dispatched either. 
<HR>
<b>You say, 'what abut Great Divide' </b>
<HR>
Svekk Fangbinder says 'If you wish to deliver supplies to the warriors in the great divide that is wonderful. One small problem arises. I do not know you Dark elf. I would not trust you as far as I could throw a dragon. If you pay for the supplies and deliver them the men at the fortress will surely repay you. A pack of basic supplies only costs a meager five hundred gold pieces. If you choose to purchase the supplies and deliver them take them to a man named Bekerak Coldbones at the outpost.
<HR>
Give 500gp to him and he will give you a sack of supplies. Take the sack to Bekerak Coldbines who is at the giant fort in the Great Divide.
<HR>
Then Bekerak will complian that the supplies are too little and ask you to give a note to Svekk.
<HR>
After you submit the note to Svekk, he will give you a voucher and ask you to find a Klezendian Crystal which is dropped randomly by Orc Miners withinn Crytal Caverns.
<HR>
Hand in both the voucher and the crystal to Svekk
<HR>
Svekk Fangbinder says 'Did you travel to the crystal caverns to get that crystal Korteal? You are quite brave for a Dark elf. I have the other supplies ready for your trip, they are quite heavy but I think you will get by.
<HR>
Svekk will then give you a large sack of supplies to take back to Bekerak in The Great Divide.
<HR>
Bekerak Coldbones says 'I am in your debt Dark elf. These supplies will help our effort to destroy the Coldain. I wish I had more to give then what I do.' Bekerak pulls a strange looking totem on a string from one of his pockets and hands it to you. 'May Lord Rallos smile upon you Korteal.'
