Loremaster Borannin says, "Incredible! Never before has an outlander been skilled and determined enough to craft our sacred rune. You are now worthy of the Dain’s most perilous task. You should seek an audience with the Dain immediately. Show him your Runed Prayer Shawl; he will give you the task that has been prepared for you. If the Dain is away show your Shawl to Chamberlain Krystorf and he will call for him."

Dain Frostweaver IV says, "Ah Korteal. I was hoping to see you. We require your skilled hand. The Armory is overtaxed preparing armor for the war that we are preparing to wage on the Giants of Zek. We need you to help by creating some Field Plate for a mission that is near to execution. Go see Loremaster Solstrin in the Hall of Ancestors, give him these orders. He holds the lore recorded on how to make the field plate."

Loremaster Solstrin says, "So, the Dain needs your assistance with the Field Plate. The Dain must trust you a great deal to impart the wisdom of our armor creation to you. Here are the tomes. The first details how to make the basic armor, the other details how to begin [working with gemstones]. If the Dain is asking you for them you should place them in an [Issue Kit]. May Brell guide your hand friend, good luck to you."

<HR>
Loremaster Solstrin says, "Aye, gems are placed within the armor. Brell is pleased with this fusion of ore and gem. The combination produces a sturdy piece of armor. You will need some Etching Tools to work with the gems. If you ask Meg Tucter for a set, she should have some lying about."
<HR>
<b>You say, "What about the issue kit?"</b>
<HR>
Loremaster Solstrin says, "The Standard Issue Kit is what we issue to soldiers at the beginning of their mission. I have this empty one here. Before I give it to you, could you show me your Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl? I would like to see how skilled you are.'
<HR>

Take the kit to the General, he had to drudge forward without any armor. His [mission] must be a success if we hope to successfully defend Thurgadin against the Giants."

<HR>
Dain Frostreaver IV says, "After General Bragmur has equipped the armor you have created for him, give him these orders. He is a skilled diplomat and will need to reach the pirate Gnomes. We must enter into a pact with them. We will supply them with the velium that they need to build their silly gadgets, and they will take their ship back to Antonica and call for reinforcements from our ancestors. We hope they will accept this pact, after all Brell has been known to align himself with Bristlebane whom the Gnomes of Iceclad follow. You may be an important [factor] in their success"

Avatar of Below's voice echoes through the area. "The efforts to help the Coldain and bring them together with the gnomes of Iceclad is quite impressive.

Avatar of Below holds the shawl up close to one eye to look at the rune sewn into it. He smiles to himself and then drops it to the ground and places one hand on it. A bright blue glow starts to emanate in the snow, then there is a sudden flash! The Avatar has dissipated. All that is left behind is the Shawl lying in the snow, shimmering with a new power. Verdandi slowly bends down to pick it up, and is infused with a blessing from Brell.
