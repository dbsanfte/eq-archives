Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen says 'Who dares to address me while I am clearly busy reviewing my daily research. I sure hope this is important Korteal, I do not have time to waste on just any initate of House Spurned. Not a single day goes by that I do not come face to face with cannon fodder that is not even worthy of a headstone in our burial grounds. If you wish to [prove yourself] then I might be in a generous mood. '

<HR>
Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen says 'I must admit this is not the first time I have heard someone say that nor will it be the last, however I am wiling to give you a chance. First thing we will need to do is get some clothes in your back if you wish to survive for any amount of time. If you are a young Wizard, Enchanter or Magician of House Spurned then I will present you with a [mystical sewing kit]. ' 
<HR>
<b>You say, 'what mystical sewing kit?' </b>
<HR>
Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen says 'The Mystical Sewing kit that I have created is one that is able to fashion a material used for crafting clothes worn by all Initates of House Spurned. All that is required are Cloaks worn by Lightwalkers that plague our Forest to this very day. If you are to take my task and seek vegenence on this inferior group of Arcane lightwalkers you will pride your house along with gathering one of the [key ingredients] for your armor. I have heard rumor that they have tried to generate some kind of magic from a source shrouded by our forest. ' 
<HR>
<b>You say, 'what key ingredients?' </b>
<HR>
Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen says 'You will be given different combination recipes for whichever armor piece you wish to craft. You will combine the specific items in the Mystical Sewing Kit that I will give to you when you are ready. After you have combined the correct items in your sewing kit you will fashion together a Bloodstained Cloth of the Spurned. At that time you will put the pattern that I will give you for each armor piece you request in the loom along with this cloth to craft your Armor piece. I will also suggest that you craft your Breastplate last due to the difficulty of obtaining the items. Do you [understand] the instructions I have given you? ' 
<HR>
<b>You say, 'I understand' </b>
<HR>
Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen says 'Very well Korteal, here is your Mystical sewing kit. I have the patterns and recipes necessary to craft Spurned Initiate [Skullcaps], [Bracers], [Sandals], [Sleeves], [Trousers], [Gloves} and [Robes]. When you feel you are ready to gather the items necessary to craft your armor simply tell me which piece you want to craft. The items that you will need to collect will mostly be found in the Forest but some will be here in town. As I said before seek out the Arcane Lightwalkers to collect the cloaks that you will need to make the armor materials. I look forward to seeing what you will make of this opportunity. '

Bring me the Prayer beads of all 3 Orc Chieftans. These Orc Chieftans are the heads of each Orc camps and will be heavily guarded so I would suggest bringing any friends you have made that are somewhat proficient on the battlefield to assist you. They have caused my house many problems and it is time that they are put to rest. You have come to far to fail me now Korteal. I hope to see you soon, alive that is. '
