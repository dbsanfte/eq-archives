    Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: Just south of the chessboard isle in Timorous 
    Deep is the Raptor Isles. There are two; widely known as large and small 
    (due to their size naturally). They are very close to each other. The 
    easiest way into TD is to go to Firiona Vie (or Overthere) and talk to the 
    Translocator. He will pop you into the Timorous Deep zone and you can 
    levitate, SoW and hike it to the isles. Assuming they are not camped you 
    have your choice of the two isles.<br>
    <br>
    Small- Easier to "break" as the sets of mobs are farther apart from 
    eachother. There are a total of seven mobs for this island. Four on the 
    "beach" side make set#1. Two on the north side of the island + 1 spare from 
    large island make set#2. This is acceptable and xpected to pull this 
    straggler across the water to the small isle. He is on the northern part of 
    the large isle and is all by himself. Simply pull one set of mobs, wrap and 
    kite. Then you have a good 12 mins. to use that side of the island to med. 
    All raptors are on a 12 min. timer. Get in the habit of timing them and be 
    ready for the next spawn. If you spend the time breaking the spawn up you 
    don't wan to get caught off-guard by another set spawning while you're 
    kiting the other half of the island. Downside of this isle is you need 
    levitate at all times to grab the straggler and you only get seven (7) 
    spawns (as opposed to "large" where you get eight ( for the same mana 
    output).<br>
    <br>
    Large- Harder to break as the mobs aren't as separate. You need to get four 
    and exactly four in your first pull to break the spawn. I don't have any 
    good advice here except to be careful and scope out your pull before you do 
    it. Levitate and use the water to your advantage. Try to kite in a tight 
    area on one side of the island. Then you've got your 5-6 mins. to do the 
    other side. Once the spawn is broken up you will be quadding every few 
    minutes and should see some excellent XP!<br>
    <br>
    NOTE: Careful when pulling Dinus, he's got a lot more HP than the others and 
    you might need to sit-med-nuke a few times to finish him off. This has 
    caused problems a few times as it screws up the timing of the spawns if you 
    take too long to kill him. If you see Dinus up you are best to wait till you 
    are full mana before pulling the whole quad so you can finish him quickly 
    after the first three go down. This will keep the spawning/killing times 
    consistent.<br>
    <br>
    Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: Raptors are probably the best XP anywhere from 
    54-58. Even after 58 with KEI you can hold both islands and still make darn 
    good XP. With a little practice you can kite right on the isles, and with 
    KEI you'll be right back at full for the next spawn. Finding an isle open 
    can be tough though, I would recommend binding here and checking the spawn 
    when you log in, then asking the person to send you a tell when they leave. 
    Seems to work pretty well.</span><ul>
