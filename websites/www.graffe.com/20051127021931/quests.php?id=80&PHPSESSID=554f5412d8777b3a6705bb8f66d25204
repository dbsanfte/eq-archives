  <p align="left">This quest starts out in North Qeynos inside the Crow's 
  Tavern. Once inside, speak to the Erudite librarian named Umvera Dekash:</p>

  <hr noshade>

      </div>

  <p><b>You say</b>, 'hail Umvera Dekash' </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Umvera Dekash says</b> 'What, Graffe ? Do I look like a merchant to 
    you? Just because all these merchants are in my library, it doesn't mean 
    that I am one. If you are interested in something other than spell scrolls, 
    then, we can talk. </p>
    <p><b>You say</b>, 'I am interested' </p>
    <p><b>Umvera Dekash says</b> 'Ah, so you do have half a wit about you! Very 
    well. As you can clearly see, I am the librarian here. I keep track of all 
    of the mystic tomes that enter this divine building. I also take care of all 
    of the purchasing. Have you something to offer? </p>
    <p><b>You say</b>, 'I have something to offer' </p>
    <p><b>Umvera Dekash says</b> 'Excellent! You have no idea how difficult it 
    is to get good help these days. Do you think you would have the time to 
    gather some information for me? </p>
    <p><b>You say</b>, 'I think I will have the time to help you gather 
    information' </p>
    <p><b>Umvera Dekash says</b> 'Even better! Well, it has been some time since 
    the Tesch Val gnolls moved in on the Split Paw. That being said, we still 
    know little to nothing of their origins. If you can bring me back the four 
    scrolls that our diviners speak of, I believe I can reward you well. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The scrolls he wants are four different LORE Tanned Split Paw Skins, which 
  are dropped randomly off Gnolls in Infected Paw and look like actual scrolls, 
  not spells. Each skin/scroll can be identified and each has a number from 1 
  through 4 that will appear near the beginning of the identify message. Being 
  that they are LORE, you cannot have two of one scroll so that should narrow 
  things down for you as well. </p>
  <p>After you have each of the four scrolls, head back to North Qeynos and 
  visit Umvera Dekash again in the Crow's Tavern. Hand him the scrolls and in 
  turn, will give you a book of the translated split paw skins. Umvera will then 
  inform you that you need to have the book bound by Jheron Felkis.</p>
  <p>Jheron Felkis can be found in East Freeport at &quot;Velith &amp; Bardo's Imported 
  Goods&quot; upstairs in the first room. Give the book to Jheron and it will rewrite 
  itself into a series of letters written by the Ishva Verishe Val called &quot;A Paw 
  Book&quot;. Take this new book back to Umvera in North Qeynos and he will give you 
  a sealed letter to take to Durkis Battlemore.</p>
  <p>You can find Durkis in the Butcherblock Mountains inside a hut near Kaladim, 
  on he path from the docks. Give Durkis the sealed letter and he will give you 
  a set of Gem Inlaid Gauntlets..</p>
