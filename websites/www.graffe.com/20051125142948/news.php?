*** Depths of Darkhollow*** <BR>
<BR>
Many of the single group attainable rewards from the Depths of Darkhollow expansion have received significant upgrades. This includes more than 1,000 items from all over the expansion. Also, to allow players who have deleted items a chance to get them again, the rewards you get for completing a mission the first time are now given to you whenever you complete the mission and do not already have the reward. <BR>
We've also made many tuning changes to the DoD missions to provide a smoother ramp up in difficulty over the course of the expansion. In general, earlier missions are now a bit easier and missions further into the expansion are now a bit more challenging, particularly the hard level missions. <BR>
<BR>
*** New Monster Missions *** <BR>
<BR>
- A gnollish zealot has been spotted near the bridge in South Karana. He speaks of the rift within Paw and the final whereabouts of the son of Ishva Mal. Perhaps there is still hope for the prisoners within. <BR>
- The Solusek Mining Company has begun recruiting clockwork pilots for a special mission. Report to Clockwork Commander Widgetsworth in Lavastorm for further details. <BR>
<BR>
*** Spells *** <BR>
<BR>
- Several of the abilities used by NPCs in the Demi-Plane of Blood have been modified. <BR>
- The Enchanter spell Apathy of the Nihil has been replaced with Dreary Deeds, an upgrade to Forlorn Deeds. <BR>
- E`ci's Frosty Breath and Glacier Breath are now much harder to resist. <BR>
- Blood of the Spire is now a more potent mana preservation focus. <BR>
- Ravenous Hunger has been changed. It is now named "Ravenous Sloth" and is a 40% duration extender on the spell "Lingering Sloth". <BR>
- The Aura of Arcanum line of spells should now have the correct spell description. <BR>
<BR>
*** Items *** <BR>
<BR>
- Pumpkin lovers rejoice! Pumpkin items now stack. <BR>
- The spell Servant of Marr now properly requires Ink of the Companion. <BR>
- Some of the ores that did not stack before now stack. This is from a list provided by the community. <BR>
- The drop rate on Shards of Dark Matter has been increased. The high-end Gates of Discord bosses will now drop at least one of them every time they are killed. <BR>
- The weight on all versions of the Mask of Horror for the Halloween event has been decreased. <BR>
- Ensorcelled Great Sword of the Night should now proc correctly for players at level 55 and greater who can wield the sword. The Greatsword is also more visually imposing. <BR>
- All none/none flagged containers in the game are now flagged as all/all. This should fix some issues with containers not showing up in varied item searches in the bazaar and item point vendors. <BR>
- Some of the "Last Blood" augmentations now have stronger focus effects. <BR>
- Darkhollow Constitutional will now return a normal cork, not the dissolving kind. <BR>
- Statuette of the Tranquil is now called "Amice of the Tranquil" and is a shoulder slot item. The AC has been increased and the avoidance has been replaced with accuracy. <BR>
- Woven Shadow Shroud is now called "Woven Shadow Stone" and is a range slot item. The item now has points in backstab damage. <BR>
- Razorsharp Shortsword is now not usable by berserkers. <BR>

- Azure Slippers of the Diplomat have lost their attack bonus and have received a +2 to mana regen. <BR>
- Eulogy, the Bloodthirsty Blade now has higher hit points. <BR>
- Bard instruments will drop less frequently in the Demi-Plane of Blood and a maximum of once per kill. <BR>
- The Insidious Hooded Cloak now has its specialization modifier set to alteration instead of conjuration. <BR>
- The Ancient Werewolf Skull evolving item now has augmentation slots at each stage in evolution. <BR>
- The Sharpshooting VI spell effect on Soulseeker, Death's Sigh is now worn instead of combat. <BR>
- The Polished Chitin War Horn now has an augment slot. <BR>
- Ancient Cudgel of Slaughter now has resistance modifiers. <BR>
- Though it is still magnetic, a magnetic metal brick will no longer stick to your hands. <BR>
<BR>
*** Missions, Tasks & Quests *** <BR>
<BR>
- Adjusted the experience reward for monster missions to better reflect the amount of effort the mission requires. Missions that could be finished very quickly are now worth less experience and missions that are taking longer to complete are now worth more experience. <BR>
- High Seas Rogues have regained the ability to evade! <BR>
- All Drachnid Hive level 65 missions should now give out the appropriate one time rewards. <BR>
- Artisan Dosan Vis’Moor, Vivian Selgan, and Gart Okken should now be accepting items for the tasks that they give. <BR>

<BR>
*** UI *** <BR>
<BR>
- The GuildManagement window has a new tab "Information", which contains the MOTD fields, as well as two new fields for Guild web URL and Guild channel specification. These new fields are changeable by the Guild leader only. <BR>

<BR>

- The Knight of the Dread Sun will now make his appearance more often. <BR>
- Fixed an issue in Dreadspire that could cause some of the residents of the crypt to aggro through the roof. <BR>
- Ogres will now be able to get the thread for their cultural armor without having to fight off guards. <BR>

</td><td class=menuhead nowrap>November 14th, 2005</td></tr><tr><td class=menudata colspan=2>
<div id="main201" style="display:none;">
<br><ul>I got an email, with this information in it...<BR>
<BR>
<B>What were the thoughts behind the decision to retune the Depths of Darkhollow items?</B><BR>
<BR>
After DoD launched, we saw a lot of feedback from players that non-raid loot rewards weren’t appropriate for the difficulty of the content.  Carefully evaluating the cases players brought up led us to audit the model that has been used for itemization for several expansions now.<BR>
<BR>
The old itemization model was based around the top end single group gear being roughly 50% of the stats of top end raid level gear.  This worked fine when it was first implemented, but as stats have increased, so too has the gap between raiders and non-raiders.  Since content is tuned with player power in mind, this has caused a growing gap in the difficulty of expansion zones, in turn leading to the problems players have been reporting. <BR>
<BR>
After a lot of evaluation on the potential impact, we decided to change the itemization model to bring single group gear closer to the level of raid attainable gear.  Beyond providing more tangible upgrades in the expansion, this change should also have a number of positive effects on the game as a whole and is something we will continue to use when making items in the future.<BR>
<BR>
<B>How many items did you change?</B><BR>
<BR>
These changes affect roughly 1000 items from the Depths of Darkhollow expansion.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Does this retuning involve anything other than changing the items?</B><BR>
<BR>
Yes.  In addition to looking at many of the expansion items, we also took a look at the difficulty of the zones and missions and made adjustments to provide a smoother progression of difficulty through the expansion.  In many cases, lower level missions early in the expansion became a bit easier and higher level missions that are further into the expansion became a bit harder.<BR>
<BR>
<B>If we have previously done a DoD mission and deleted the one-time completion reward, will we be able to get it again after it is upgraded?</B><BR>
<BR>
Yes.  We changed the way the mission reward mechanic works so when you complete a mission it will now give you the completion reward again if you don't already have that item anywhere on your character (including in the bank).  This will allow players who have previously done the missions to return to those missions and get the items again.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Could you give a few examples of items that are being upgraded?</B><BR>
<BR>
Here are a few examples of items from different parts of the expansion.  They are fairly representative of the overall changes we are making.<BR>

*** Headliners ***<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*** New Default UI Skin ***<BR>
<BR>
- We have updated the default UI skin with new art and icons! This is the same artwork that has been on display on our Escape to Norrath server (www.escapetonorrath.com) and our test server. For those of you that prefer to use the old default UI Skin, you can type /loadskin default_old in your chat window and it will allow you to use the old default UI.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*** Events and Seasonal Festivities ***<BR>
<BR>
- Zigan Ribshard in the Plane of Knowledge has a few friends he’d like you to meet. Speak with him for more information regarding seasonal festivities.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Community Summit Related Items:<BR>
<BR>
- There is a new filter option on the guild bank to narrow your search.<BR>

- Added Stun and Strikethrough filters/color selectors.<BR>
- Players now have an option in the options window to determine whether or not they want other players to see them with their helm. "Show My Helm" <BR>
- EverQuest now uses the system mouse. While in windowed mode you can freely move the mouse around as you can with any other application running in a window.<BR>

<BR>
- Raid invites can now be done across zones via "/raidinvite name"<BR>
- Bandaging other players will appear to give a healing effect again.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*** Audio Triggers ***<BR>
<BR>
Audio triggers are sound effects that are played when certain patterns appear in the chat window. You can make audio triggers to play any sound you want when something you want to be sure not to miss appears in the chat window. This might be /tells from specific friends, certain buffs fading, or any other event you can think of that has a text message associated with it. The window used to configure your Audio Triggers can be accessed via the EQ button -> Actions -> Audio Triggers.<BR>
<BR>
There are a couple key ideas that make up Audio Triggers. <BR>
<BR>
Audio Triggers are a collection of text patterns associated with a sound effect. The window shows a list of all active audio triggers. They are sorted by priority so that the first pattern that matches text in the chat window will be the one and only sound that is played. This allows patterns to be made, for example, "tells you" and "yourbuddy tells you" that may have different sound effects. The "Move Up" and "Move Down" commands allow you to control which patterns will be tested first. <BR>
<BR>
Creating a new trigger is a simple matter of typing text in the "Pattern" field, selecting a sound in the "Sound" control, and pressing "Create". <BR>
<BR>
The other controls include:<BR>
<BR>
* Apply - changes the sound selected for the current pattern. Note that changing a pattern requires a new pattern to be made.<BR>
* Play - plays the currently selected sound again.<BR>
* Delete - delete the currently selected trigger.<BR>
<BR>
Trigger Sets<BR>
<BR>
Trigger Sets are similar to choosing a UI skin. Each trigger set represents a set of patterns associated with sounds that is stored on a per-character basis. You can switch trigger sets by selecting the drop-down control and selecting among the listed options. Unless you have installed custom Audio Trigger sets, you will only see the "default" entry. <BR>
<BR>
Each trigger set is stored as a folder in the AudioTrigger folder in your EverQuest directory which can contain .wav files unique to that trigger set. The goal here is to provide a way for the player community to create and share their own Audio Trigger sets that people find useful for different classes or play styles, much like they have done for custom UI skins. <BR>
<BR>
An example of a useful trigger set may be a set of patterns <BR>
There are many possibilities. Due to the differences in play styles, there is no way to predict what settings people might prefer so the default settings are empty. We encourage players to discover and share ways to make this a fun part of their gameplay. <BR>
<BR>
Notes on customizing Audio Triggers:<BR>
<BR>
* Any .wav files found in the folder .\AudioTriggers\shared will be made available to all Audio Trigger sets in the Sound selection control. You will probably want to put most of your custom sounds in this folder, unless you are making custom Audio Trigger sets.<BR>
* Creating a new Audio Trigger set is similar to making a new UI skin. It's not complicated but it's not built into the UI. Create a folder in .\AudioTriggers\NewTriggerSetName and put any .wav files specific to this trigger set in there, and you will be able to start using the new trigger set the next time the program is started.<BR>
* User settings for each Audio Trigger set can be found in .\userdata\AT_TriggerSetName_CharacterName_ServerN ame.ini. You can copy these files to other characters as needed. You will probably want to include a sample of this if you make an Audio Trigger set that you plan to share because this is what contains all the details on each specific trigger pattern and sound.<BR>
<BR>
The above instructions are available in-game via the help button on the audio triggers window. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<br><ul>SOE Summit<BR>
<BR>
Here are my comments on the actual summit roundtables.<BR>
<BR>
The overall focus of the last summit was basically on the game itself; Where it has come from and where it is going.<BR>
<BR>
We started with a tour of the offices and saw where the new cubicles where the devs will now serve their penance.<BR>
<BR>
We initially spent some time with the marketing people talking about the differences between buying the boxed version in stores and getting it via digital download and a few other things. Some things that came up were:<BR>
<BR>
A lot of people get very annoyed with the continual popup, especially if they have preordered the game from a store already. A number of suggestions were offered and most of them had to do with how to turn the popup off (don't bug me anymore button, code from preorder, etc).<BR>
<BR>
Some time was spent talking about Platinum edition which is currently out of print but a new one is scheduled.<BR>
<BR>
A suggestion to allow just the selling of keys online for the various to accomodate people who already have the media and just want to get a new account or update an old one. This is already done mostly with the new expansions since they are digital already.<BR>
<BR>
Better distribution of some kind for Escape to Norrath somehow, especially since the download size is fairly large for some people (300 meg).<BR>
<BR>
Next, the discussion turned to the game itself and progression in it, from the lowest levels to the highest. A lot of this discussion basically focused on the varying playstyles people have in the game and differing opinions on what people consider fun. It was emphasized pretty strongly that their main intention is to try and make sure the game is fun because, afterall, it is a game. There was a lot of discussion about the varying power levels of players at the higher ends of the game and what that means when it comes to content. Even content that is focused at level 70 may not mean that just being level 70 is enough to do it, you may further need gear/AA to progress in it and there was some discussion on how to balance this.<BR>
<BR>
There was some talk about the LFG and how some people wanted to see the number of AA other people have. Some people thought it was a good idea, others didn't. Some were more in between and suggestions that instead of the number perhaps a 'range' could be given. And still other people wanted a way to block that information if it was going to be included. There was quite a range of opinions on most topics.<BR>
<BR>
There was a lot of discussion about how to integrate new players into the game and what has been done already to facilitate this at the lower levels. The new Escape to Norrath is part of this, as are the new tutorial and having everyone together in PoK instead of the sparsely populated low level zones outside the cities. Which brought up some discussion about how the cities themselves are underutilized and nobody really goes to them unless they have to.<BR>
<BR>
LDoNs were brought up and it was pointed out that at the lower levels, you basically are outleveling the points accumulation needed to buy anything level appropriate at the levels you are doing them. Zajeer said he plans to reevaluate costs and points at the lower levels to try and fix this problem.<BR>
<BR>
There was a lot of dicussion about downtime and how to fix it. The main problem is, EQ doesn't really have a state that says you are in combat or not in combat. So there has to be some way to make sure you aren't abusing the out of combat regen to help with a fight you are in (such as sitting out of range of AE and such to get your mana back faster or the like). There were lots of ideas thrown around, but nothing that really solved the overall problem and they are continuing to look at ways to solve it.<BR>
<BR>
The class reenvisionment was brought up, and they said it is approximately 70% complete and that it is still ongoing.<BR>
<BR>
Next, we talked about the current expansion, Depths of Darkhollow.<BR>
<BR>
The current state of itemization in DoD was brought up, which has been a pretty hot topic since it was released and there was a lot of discussion on just this. Zajeer stated his general principles towards itemization. You should get the same level of items for the same level of difficulty, so even if it is a new expansion, you shouldn't expect to gain better rewards for not doing anything harder than in a previous expansion. The items you get for first completing the progression missions shouldn't be as good as the chest items because everyone gets one. There was a lot of talk about the fact that a number of missions are harder than they should be for the level of itemization they have. Zajeer said he intended to take a look at both difficulty and the items over the next few weeks and make adjustments as necessary. <BR>
<BR>
Experience gain for both shrouds and evolving/intelligent items was discussed. Rytan said he thought the current experience gain for shrouds was lower than he had planned, so he will be taking a look at that. Zajeer said the evolving items should take about 10 hours of experience perlevel. Some types of experience gain was not going towards leveling them (such as raids). Intelligent items should take a bit longer to level (but they have few overall levels), as he stated he wanted you to have more experience with the items and what they say at each level.<BR>
<BR>
There was some talk about how to balance out monster missions with normal missions, including itemization, xp gain, and failure conditions. Specific problems with some current missions were also talked about.<BR>
<BR>
We then moved on to open discussion.<BR>
<BR>
The first topic was thrown out by Craig Knapp, producer of EQ, and it was a discussion about the death penalty. There were a wide variety of opinions on it and what changes could be made to it. One thing that came up was how much worse the death penalty was at lower levels compared to what it is at the high end, and there was a lot of discussion into how that could be addressed.<BR>
<BR>
Cheating in EQ, especially with regards to Macroquest, was brought up, and there was talk about plans to do something about it. Grumbuk stated they had a good handle on cheating and how to detect it but they are waiting til they have as close to a 100% solution as they can because they don't want to ban people who aren't cheating inadvertantly. They pay close attention to current cheats and exploits and try to do everything they can to stop them, and this will continue. People also pressed for some statistics to be made public about suspensions and bannings.<BR>
<BR>
Another thing that came up is the plan to start using the windows mouse instead of the one in game. This means you won't have to alt tab out to release your mouse anymore but can switch from desktop to EQ and back on the fly. It will also have the advantage that it shouldn't suffer from lag unless your whole system is.<BR>
<BR>
Grumbuk also mentioned that he is adding in the ability to trigger sound cues from text. Basically, you should be able to have a sound triggered from anything that goes to your log file via simple text matching. You should be able to use your own sound files for these as well. A lot of people will appreciate this with the new abilities that were introduced in DoD. Some said they might even turn sound on for the first time in 5 years.<BR>
<BR>
All in all, it was a good day of discussions. We ran over schedule every single time and the discussions on these continued during breaks and lunch. I'll post other comments as well as some pictures when I have a chance to write them up.<BR>
