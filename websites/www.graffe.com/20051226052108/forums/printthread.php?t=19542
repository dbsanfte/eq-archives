<font size="5"><b>Auction Houses</b></font><br />
This is the way an in-game auction system should be done, period.  It's simple to use, creative, informative, and best of all, doesn't require you to park yourself AFK overnight or stop playing.  Here's auction house basics...<br />
<br />
<i>Creating an Auction...</i><br />
WoW uses an auction-based system.  Think eBay!  You set a minimum bid, and optionally a buyout price (Buy It Now! - must be higher than the minimum bid - allows instant purchase for a higher price).  After those options are configured you then move over to the duration option which ties in with the deposit cost.  Basically, the higher the value of the item and the longer you have it up for auction, the more expensive it is to keep it there.  Regardless, deposit is returned at the end of the auction.  All active auctions are shown in the auction tab, allowing you to sort by bid, name, bidder name, and the time it closes in.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.graffe.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=45&amp;stc=1" border="0" alt="" /><br />
<br />
<i>Bidding and Searching...</i><br />
The search / bid screen is very flexible and easy to use.  You can search for item level ranges, quality, the name, the type... pretty much everything under the sun!  You can even restrict the search to items only you can use.  The number in parenthesis is the "buy it now" price, no one has bid on any of these items at this time.  Also note the search search limiters on the left portion of the window.  You can actually select multiple options simply by clicking on more.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.graffe.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=44&amp;stc=1" border="0" alt="" /><br />
<br />
When you win an auction (or someone buys your item) the item (along with the deposit) is sent to you via the mail system.  The letter informs you that you won an auction or that an item was sold, you then simply take the item out like you normally would.  Unfortunately I don't have a screenshot of either (I sold something earlier but didn't get one!), it's very nice though.<br />
<br />
All in all I think the auction system is a wonderful addition to WoW and makes selling items so much less of a hassle.<br />
<br />
<font size="5"><b>Talent System</b></font><br />
Wow is all I can say.  I had very high hopes for the system, and anyone who saw it during alpha is no doubt impressed at the overhaul.  Below are some teasers, think Diablo 2 skill trees... but not anywhere near as lame. ;)  This is true character customization!  Talents range anywhere from bonuses on existing spells to unlocking brand new abilities to further enhance your character.  Here's a few screenshots of both Warrior and Mage talents (not the background!)... enjoy!<br />

Only had one suggestion for auctions (a la FFXI) and that is to give sellers a summary of like the last 10 auction sale prices for their item when they are setting prices.  As it is now, I have no idea whatsoever to put anything for sale up and I'm way too lazy to start bugging people for price checks :p</div>

Why the fuck do you even care? I don't agree with trading real money for imaginary things because its fucking stupid, plus for me at least the fun is in the acquisition of those imaginary things not just having them. I figure the same people who buy this stuff are the people who use cheat codes in single player games, I don't understand them, but being actively out to "keep the likes of them" from doing it I also don't understand.<br />
<br />
Secondly, how exactly do you propose this system would work? You can't magically distinguish between "sending an item through the mail that was paid for with cash over ebay" and "sending an item through the mail for any other fucking reason".</div>

I think you are angry at the wrong person there.  Frog talk is not really clear but I think what he was asking is whether the fact that using the ingame delivery system will discourage Yantis types.  Personally, I do not see how that is the case.  <br />
<br />
Things like "Bind on Pickup" are what discourages Yantis.  Of course, you might have seen something in frogs post  I did not, Lan.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I think you are angry at the wrong person there.  Frog talk is not really clear but I think what he was asking is whether the fact that using the ingame delivery system will discourage Yantis types.  Personally, I do not see how that is the case.  <br />
<br />
Things like "Bind on Pickup" are what discourages Yantis.  Of course, you might have seen something in frogs post  I did not, Lan.</div>
