			British airlines 'face multiple toxic air claims'<br />
<br />
By Jim Reed <br />
Reporter, Victoria Derbyshire programme<br />
<br />
<br />
8 June 2015<br />
<br />
 From the section Business<br />
 Seventeen former and serving cabin crew are planning legal action against British airlines saying they have been poisoned by contaminated cabin air. <br />
<br />
The cases are funded by the Unite union which represents 20,000 flight staff. <br />
<br />
Workers believe they have fallen sick after breathing in fumes mixed with engine oil and other toxic chemicals.<br />
<br />
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) says incidents of smoke or fumes on planes are rare and there is no evidence of long-term health effects.<br />
<br />
Oxygen masks<br />
<br />
The Unite union, which is calling for a public inquiry into contaminated cabin air, has recently opened a dedicated legal unit to record and process claims from its membership. <br />
<br />
<br />
Its lawyers are now working on 17 &quot;definite&quot; individual personal injury claims against British airlines in the civil courts, although these are still at an early stage.<br />
<br />
Uncensored safety reports submitted to the CAA, and obtained by the Victoria Derbyshire programme, show that between April 2014 and May 2015 there were 251 separate incidents of fumes or smoke inside a large passenger jet operated by a British airline.<br />
<br />
The BBC has, where possible, chosen not to include cases which could be blamed on an internal fault like a broken toilet or air conditioning system. <br />
<br />
The statistics do not include international airlines, such as Lufthansa and Ryanair, even when travelling in British airspace.<br />
<br />
An illness was reported in 104 of the 251 cases, and on at least 28 of those flights oxygen was administered.<br />
<br />
The programme has also seen first-hand testimony from a pilot working for a major UK airline who believes he was affected by toxic fumes while landing at Birmingham Airport in 2014.<br />
<br />
&quot;Almost instantly myself and the captain became very unwell and decided it was bad enough to place our oxygen masks on,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We didn't declare a mayday - mostly due to not being able to think of the words needed to say - and ended up auto-landing the plane and simply briefing, 'Whoever is alive or conscious, pull back the thrust levels after touchdown.' It was that serious.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Around half the air on board most modern commercial jets is drawn through the engines. <br />
<br />
Campaigners say when a fault occurs in the engine seals, a cocktail of potentially poisonous gases can reach the cabin. This includes TCP, an organophosphate known to be dangerous to human health in high enough quantities. <br />
<br />
It is repeated exposure to such fume events - combined with long-term, low-level exposure to chemicals - which some cabin crew believe has damaged their long-term health.<br />
<br />
The problems are said to affect the central nervous system and brain.<br />
<br />
The CAA says there is no evidence that chemicals appear at high enough concentrations to cause harm.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Lawyers and campaigners are closely watching a series of inquests which could influence the outcome of a much larger number of civil cases.<br />
<br />
Pilot Richard Westgate died in December 2012, aged 43, after complaining of long-term health problems. <br />
<br />
<b>Last February, the coroner in the inquest into his death wrote to British Airways and the CAA saying that examinations of Mr Westgate's body &quot;disclosed symptoms consistent with exposure to organophosphate compounds in aircraft cabin air&quot;.</b><br />
<br />
Airplane cockpit<br />
He asked them to take &quot;urgent action to prevent future deaths&quot;. <br />
<br />
Both organisations have since replied to the coroner implying he overstepped the mark and had relied on &quot;selective and contentious evidence&quot;. <br />
<br />
<b>A second inquest is due to open into the case of 34-year-old Matthew Bass who died suddenly in January 2014 after suffering unexplained health problems. <br />
<br />
His family says a specialist post-mortem examination found high levels of toxins in his nervous system linked to organophosphates.</b><br />
<br />
British Airways said in a statement: &quot;We would not operate an aircraft if we believed it posed a health or safety risk to our customers or crew.<br />
<br />
&quot;There has been substantial research into questions around cabin air quality over the last few years. In summary, the research has found no evidence that exposure to potential chemicals in the cabin causes long-term ill health&quot;. <br />
<br />
Airbus and Boeing both maintain cabin air is safe to breathe.<br />
<br />
'Nocebo effect'<br />
<br />
In 2013, an independent group of scientists, the Committee on Toxicity, looked at the evidence of long-term health effects for the government. <br />
<br />
It could not establish a link between contaminated cabin air and ill health. <br />
<br />
&quot;The levels [of harmful chemicals in planes] were as low or even lower than those in the home or the workplace,&quot; said Prof Alan Boobis, current chairman of the committee.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can't be sure what the levels are in fume events, which are very rare, but we do have some information which would indicate that even in those circumstances levels are probably below those which would affect health in humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
The committee believes one explanation could be the so-called &quot;nocebo&quot; effect, a psychological condition where exposure to a harmless substance can lead to nausea, fatigue and other medical symptoms.<br />
<br />
line<br />
Recorded incidents<br />
<br />
The following table shows extracts of some of the most critical safety reports submitted by crew to the CAA.<br />
<br />
<br />
Date Airplane Title Details <br />
12/08/2014 Boeing 767-300 Mayday declared and aircraft returned due to acrid fumes on flight deck. Decision taken to return to departure airport. Fireman on entry stated acrid smell was obvious and strong. Captain made a PA informing customers we would be returning to departure airport due to a technical problem, but he didn't want to give them too much information on the incident... Heathrow. <br />
<br />
13/08/2014 Airbus A320 Fumes in the flight deck caused flight crew illness. Two crew members donned portable oxygen as a safety precaution. Cabin crew members suffered stinging eyes, burning on the inside of the nose and a strong metallic taste in the mouth. Crew members attended hospital for the effects of the fumes. <br />
<br />
02/11/2014 Boeing 777-200 Fumes in passenger cabin during cruise. Strong smell of gas in cabin around door area. Had previously felt sick whilst in bunk rest. I got severe headache and pain in sinus. Earlier two other flight crew had both felt nauseous and another had bad headache. <br />
<br />
29/02/2015 Boeing 747 Fumes in cabin. Eleven of the cabin crew became unwell during the flight with symptoms of light headedness, nausea and sea sickness. Oxygen administered.  During the cruise, SCCM ['Senior Cabin Crew Member] informed the Captain that a number of cabin crew were feeling unwell... One cabin crew member subsequently collapsed and was administered first aid and oxygen... A general view of incapacitation during flight for all operating crew members needs to be undertaken to ensure the existing processes remain relevant. <br />
<br />
19/04/2015 Airbus A321 Flight crew and cabin crew illness due to fumes in the flight deck and cabin. On return sector, fumes entered flight deck from unknown origin. Both crew suffered to some degree with headaches, stinging eyes, and debilitation. One crew member remained on portable O2, which helped massively. <br />
<br />

			A man whose Greenwood Village home was destroyed by police in a barricade situation is angry, claiming police used excessive force to get the job done.<br />
<br />
&quot;My house has been destroyed by a paramilitary unit,&quot; owner Leo Lech said Friday. &quot;We'll have to basically doze it down to the foundation.&quot;<br />
<br />
The home, at 4219 S. Alton St., has been condemned, Lech said.<br />
<br />
Lech also fears that he'll be left alone to deal with the damage and aftermath.<br />
<br />
His nightmare began Wednesday when Lech's 25-year-old son, who lives in the home and rents from his father, called and told him police had cordoned off the property and he couldn't get in.<br />
<br />
On Thursday morning, his son called back.<br />
<br />
&quot;He said: 'The house is totaled!' &quot; Lech recalled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought, they broke down the door, or fired tear gas through a window,&quot; Lech said. &quot;When he showed me the pictures, I was just aghast — unbelievable!
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>Seriously wtf,  They blew up someone's house for a shoplifter?   One would think in this case they would have to ask permission to total a structure over one suspect... And the cops claim they are not responsible yet the SWAT team had to decide &quot;Hey guys I bet it would be really awesome to rip this place apart.&quot;</div>

			All video games are stupid, of course. That whole thing of, 'you're not really shooting terrorists or winning the World Cup, you're just pressing buttons' is patronizing and simplistic but every now and again you come across a game that has so little emotional connection to who you are that you end up standing there, gazing at the screen and saying &quot;I'm just pressing buttons and my life has no meaning,&quot; to a slightly bemused PR person.<br />
<br />
Music games are often about pressing buttons according to visual cues, which is probably why the whole genre collapsed a few years ago. That and the ferocious greed of Activision, which insisted on publishing way too many of these games.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>As everyone knows, exercising blows a squadron of dicks over time. It feels good, you know you should do it, but the only way to make it is through brutal habit to wit, it becomes boring as hell and people rightfully abandon it in favor of dying early in life.<br />
<br />
However, in one of my most brilliant ideas of all-time it occurs to me that I can combine sex and masturbation in place of a cardio routine and perhaps even a weight lifting routine with body weights perhaps.<br />
<br />
This seems like a tremendously brilliant and obvious thing to do at the time however I am completely unable to locate any useful information on routines etc. or even analysis on various positions' effectiveness. <br />
<br />
So, does anyone have any reference material on this subject. I feel like this is an opportunity to export the revolution and get America fit but I cannot find shit related to this that is not incredibly unspecific.<br />
<br />
I also wish I could find some sex toys that were very amenable to having additional weight added to them for upper body workouts type exercise. Despite the sex industry's tremendously fast iteration and tremendous coverage of usages, this seems like a completely missed out category that could transform the first world and make Wal-Mart a better place to visit.<br />
<br />
Also, I think it would be nice for a product to advertise itself as &quot;Fuck Your Way to Better Health&quot; in true American fuck yeah fashion.<br />
<br />
Clothing for weight training that I had in mind were things like this: <br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/ZFOsports®-40LBS-ADJUSTABLE-WEIGHTED-VEST/dp/B002P60ZZC/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/ZFOsports®-40L...dp/B002P60ZZC/</a><br />
<br />
Obviously the main goal here though is to finally realize a childhood dream to train like Goku.<br />

Starting this thread early, as there are often reveals and leaks before E3 starts, as well as to act as a (small) resource/guide to what you can expect. I'll start off with a summary of the press events, followed by what I think we might actually see at these events. <br />

</div><b>Bethesda</b><br />
<br />
<ul><li style="">Fallout 4 - Just announced. I'm expecting gameplay + a release date for this year. Maybe spring.</li><li style="">Doom - Announced last year (I think?). We are due some gameplay. Previously only Quakecon attendees were allowed to see it.</li><li style="">Dishonored 2 - Hasn't been announced. Maybe it will be?</li><li style="">BattleCry - Their moba. If it still exists I would expect to see something from it.</li><li style="">They will probably mention Elder Scrolls mmo for consoles, if not here, at Microsoft or Sony's event.</li><li style="">Bethesda has started publishing more games from other studios (The Evil Within from last year, for example). Maybe we will get another new thing like that.</li></ul><br />
<br />
<b>Microsoft</b><br />
<br />
I expect Microsoft to go very heavy on exclusive games this year in an attempt to make up lost ground with the PS4.<br />
<br />
<ul><li style="">Halo 5: Guardians - This will make or break Microsoft. Sony's got nothing to compete, but 343 studios has had some rocky history with the franchise lately. If they don't deliver fans will be pissed. What little I've seen looks good though.</li><li style="">Gears of War - Microsoft previously had new studio Black Tusk working on a new IP, but they eventually bought out the Gears of War franchise from Epic, and tasked them with making a new game. Expect to get the first glimpse of it this year.</li><li style="">Forza Motorsport 6 - Because they always have Forza.</li><li style="">Crackdown 3 - They announced it awhile back but to my knowledge haven't shown it yet.</li><li style="">Rise of the Tomb Raider - This is their big third party &quot;exclusive&quot;. They are going to push this hard, as this holiday the PS4 will not have it, or a reasonable competitor. I have reservations. It's going to be a December title. Almost nothing comes out in December. This means it is being rushed specifically to exploit this weakness of Sony's and make up lost ground. Could go either way.</li><li style="">They might mention Fable Legends, the F2P co-op Fable spinoff that they have previously shown.</li><li style="">I do not think they will mention Hololens. It's possible, but it seems like such a shot in the dark. I think it's too early, it's not even a product yet, just an idea of a product.</li><li style="">More Killer Instinct seasons?</li><li style="">Battletoads - Not the hottest property in my opinion, but fans have been asking for it, and Microsoft delivered on Killer Instinct. I could see it happening.</li><li style="">Lastly, I expect the new Call of Duty at Microsoft's event. People are theorizing it will be at Sony's because that is where the user base is now, but I think they will stick with Microsoft.<br />
</li></ul><br />
<br />
<b>EA</b><br />
<br />
I sort of wonder if this might be the year of Star Wars. I think they will hope to capitalize on brewing Star Wars movie hype and show off a few of their other Star Wars titles in development.<br />
<br />
<ul><li style="">Star Wars: Battlefront - This one is a given. They teased it last year, and showed off the hype trailer a month or so ago. I'm expecting this to get the biggest push out of everything they show.</li><li style="">Visceral's Star Wars game - Written by Amy Hennig (Uncharted), and possibly using assets from the defunct 1313. We know they have been working on this, I think it's time to show it.</li><li style="">Unannounced Star Wars game - Their exclusivity deal with Disney only mentions Dice and Visceral, but they might tease us with what could come later.</li><li style="">Need for Speed - They took a break. Now they are making another one.</li><li style="">Mirror's Edge - We are probably due a closer look at this.</li><li style="">Last year they barely showed anything. They might show more from some of the stuff they teased.</li><li style="">Maybe Mass Effect. I think it might still be too early, especially if they can just let Star Wars carry the show this year.<br />
</li></ul><br />
<br />
<b>Ubisoft</b><br />
<br />
<ul><li style="">Assassin's Creed - Because they insist on making one every year.</li><li style="">Rainbow Six: Siege - This is probably their big game for this year. When they first showed it, it already looked pretty far along.</li><li style="">The Division - It's been a long time coming, but it's coming, and they should probably prove that. 2016.</li><li style="">Surprise - They like surprises. Maybe a new Splinter Cell? Maybe that new &quot;Hero&quot; IP that got semi leaked?<br />
</li></ul><br />
<br />
<b>Sony</b><br />
<br />
Sony seems to be in a bad place this year. Everything we know about either came out early this year, or has been delayed to next year. I expect them to lean very heavily on third parties.<br />
<br />
<ul><li style="">Uncharted - It comes out next year, but as their biggest first party game they will probably mention it.</li><li style="">Ratchet and Clank - Also delayed to 2016, but they haven't shown anything at all (to my knowledge) of it, so might as well get on that.</li><li style="">Bloodborne Expansion - They hinted that new Bloodborne DLC is in the works. I could see them using new content for this as a way to stretch their presence in first party releases.</li><li style="">Uncharted Collection for PS4 - Another easy way to stretch their catalogue while waiting for new stuff to start getting made.</li><li style="">Guerrilla Games IP - The Killzone guys. We know they have been making a new IP, but they haven't shown it yet.</li><li style="">New God of War maybe?</li><li style="">Instead of Call of Duty, I expect Sony and Activision to double down on Destiny. There will be another big expansion this holiday and I expect them to show it.</li><li style="">I also expect Sony to very heavily promote Battlefront. Both companies are going to push this hard to carry holiday sales this year. It's going to be a big game.</li><li style="">Sony's VR solution, Morpheus, may get a retail bundle and pricing announced. Rumor is they are the closest to release out of all the various VR options.<br />
</li></ul><br />
<br />
<b>Nintendo</b><br />
<br />
<br />
Instead of having a press conference last year, Nintendo had a scheduled online steaming &quot;event&quot;. I thought it was the best show of last year, so look forward to what they do this year, though I have little idea on what to actually be excited about.<br />
They have already come out and said NO Zelda, and NO NX (their next console). This implies to me that they must have something else of value to show. (I always thought Zelda looked early)<br />
<br />
<ul><li style="">Star Fox - Teased previously, not really shown yet. Might be their biggest game, but I'm skeptical. I like the series, but it's going to take a lot to make any real impact.</li><li style="">Yoshi's Wooly World - They've shown a lot of this. It's got to be close to release. Their holiday game?</li><li style="">Xenoblade Chronicles - Still not out. Shouldn't be much longer.</li><li style="">Shin Megami/Fire Emblem crossover - They finally showed this a few months ago. Should be a pretty big jrpg.</li><li style="">Fire Emblem if - The new 3DS Fire Emblem that was recently announced.</li><li style="">Mario Maker - Should be due soon.</li><li style="">Devil's Third - Does this really still exist?</li><li style="">Metroid - I say this every year.<br />
</li></ul><br />
<br />
<b>Square Enix</b><br />
<br />
Like Bethesda, the idea is they wouldn't have their own press conference if they didn't have a lot of stuff to show off. I sort of feel like they have been inching towards this with their E3 coverage from last year, so am not expecting anything earth shattering, but between Square-Enix and Eidos, they should have a lot of stuff.<br />
<ul><li style="">Eidos</li><li style="">Tomb Raider - Extended look from what you get at the Microsoft event.</li><li style="">New Deux Ex, already announced. Show gameplay.</li><li style="">Just Cause 3, already announced. Show gameplay.</li><li style="">Possibly a new Hitman.</li><li style="">SE likes to experiment with turning Eidos properties into F2P and mmo style games. Triad Wars for example, the Sleeping Dogs spinoff, hasn't been shown yet.</li><li style="">Small chance at Legacy of Kain/Soul Reaver revival. <br />
<br />
Square Enix</li><li style="">Dragon Quest - They have a few of these in the works, they could show one. The two off the top of my head are a Dynasty Warriors style game, and a Theaterhythm game.</li><li style="">Bravely Default Sequel - They have been promoting this a lot in Japan. Could be worth a mention and a trailer.</li><li style="">Star Ocean - A new one of these was recently announced. They could start promoting it.</li><li style="">Final Fantasy 15 - I think they have said they will not show it at E3 this year. It's got to be close to done though.</li><li style="">Kingdom Hearts 3 - I will be surprised if they show this. I think it's too early still. Maybe a trailer though.</li><li style="">Final Fantasy Type 0 PC port<br />
</li></ul><br />
<br />
<b>PC Gaming</b><br />
<br />
At 3 hours, I think this one has the biggest potential for being a flop. It's the first time they have had a PC press conference for E3, but it isn't the first time something similar has been tried elsewhere. Still, if you are a PC stalwart, there will surely be a few things you find interesting.<br />
<br />
I don't know exactly what they might be showing, so I'll list what these companies are known for. This is the guest list from what I understand:<br />
<ul><li style="">Day[9] - Starcraft 2 commentator. Will be hosting.</li><li style="">Blizzard Entertainment - They have their own event, so instead of new announcements, I expect them to talk about stuff we already know about. That shooter they are making, for example.</li><li style="">Microsoft Studios - Windows 10 and DX12 talk. Maybe Fable Legends. Maybe Halo collection. (I hope)</li><li style="">Bohemia Interactive - They make ARMA 3, so something similar I guess?</li><li style="">Paradox Interactive - They make a lot of smaller PC titles. Wiki suggests something called Hollowpoint, previously announced, which I've never heard of.</li><li style="">Obsidian Entertainment - Big rpg guys. I don't know what they could show. They just released Pillars of Eternity.</li><li style="">Tripwire Interactive - Killing Floor 2, most likely. Very popular with the PC shooter crowd.</li><li style="">ArenaNet - I don't follow Guild Wars 2 lately. New expansion? Guild Wars 3? Dunno.</li><li style="">The Creative Assembly - Total War Warhammer. I forgot to tell you guys this got announced. I'm sorry.</li><li style="">Frictional Games - Known for horror cult classic Amnesia. Working on something called Soma? Not familiar.</li><li style="">Frontier Developments - Elite Dangerous</li><li style="">SCS Software - Blank Truck Simulator</li><li style="">Splash Damage - Dirty Bomb. Team based shooter from the people who made Brink.</li><li style="">Square Enix - Maybe ports they didn't have time to show in their own event, or that tech demo from the last big PC conference.</li><li style="">Cloud Imperium Games - Star Citizen</li><li style="">Devolver Digital - They make a lot of solid indie games, so something like that.</li><li style="">A few developers were called out by name, though I only remember one off the top of my head, and don't know what they might present.<br />
</li></ul><br />
<br />
<b>Other</b><br />
<br />
Games that don't fall into the Umbrella above, but that we may still see in some capacity:<br />
<br />
Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain - Releases this year. Probably at Microsoft or Sony's event. (Sony has less to show, so I'm betting on them)<br />
XCOM 2 - Just announced.<br />
Mad Max - Confirmed to be shown. Open world Mad Max game made by Just Cause developer (I think).<br />
Lego Dimensions - Lego's take on Skylanders and Infinity toy/video game crossovers. They just announced a lot of the various properties that will be present. Back to the Future, Dr Who, Scooby Doo, etc.<br />
Battleborn - 2K's shooter/moba hybrid, from Gearbox. <br />
Disney Infinity 3.0 - Did someone say Star Wars? I think someone said Star Wars. Star Waaarrrss.<br />
Guitar Hero/Rock Band - Both announced recently. <br />
Persona - Atlus will probably show the rhythm game spinoff, but everyone (not so) secretly hopes for Persona 5.<br />
<br />
And many more that I am too tired to possibly remember. Dang forum tried to eat this thread while I was typing it. It took too long to type and I got a little carried away. If there are readability issues, please let me know.</div>

			Nuclear weapons tests: Ministry of Defence admits it irradiated civilians in the Cold War<br />
<br />
3:35, 23 May 2015  <br />
By Susie Boniface <br />
  <br />
<br />
Thousands of non-military staff suffered effects of the blasts and later had their health studied by government, with increased risk of cancer and heart disease<br />
<br />
The Ministry of Defence has admitted *thousands of civilian staff were irradiated in nuclear weapons tests during the Cold War.<br />
<br />
But is still denies that veterans of the nuclear tests, which began in 1952 when Britain exploded its first device, were harmed.<br />
<br />
A newly uncovered government study details the death and cancer rates of 174,541 people who were exposed to radiation at nuclear facilities.<br />
<br />
Of those, 64,909 were employed by the MoD in non-military roles such as maintaining nuclear submarines and weapons.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is more than three times as many people as were affected by Britain’s nuclear bomb tests on Christmas Island in the 1950s – veterans who are also subject to government studies, and have had their NHS records flagged by the MoD.<br />
<br />
The study of civilians shows higher doses increased the risk of thyroid, lung and rectal cancers, leukaemia and heart disease.<br />
<br />
<b> <i>Yet while test veterans suffer the same cancers and have fathered children with 10 times the normal rate of birth defects, the Government spent millions fighting negligence claims</i> </b>.<br />
<br />
<br />
The 2009 study was found by Steve Clifford, 52, of Fleckney, Leics, as he searched for evidence that his dad Graham, 76, was *irradiated while serving as a cook on Christmas Island during 1957 bomb tests.<br />
<br />
Steve, who survived an adult form of leukaemia when he was four and now has chronic pain with bony growths on his shoulders, said: “What’s truly eye-popping is their logic that *civilians can be irradiated and get cancer but radiation just bounces off the armed forces without doing any damage.”<br />
<br />
The obscure study he discovered was carried out by government statisticians in 2009.<br />
<br />
It details 174,541 people who recorded a radiation dose at a number of organisations with nuclear facilities – power stations, scientific institutions, and the Atomic Weapons Establishment.<br />
<br />
But by far the most – 64,909, or 37 per cent – were employed by the MoD.<br />
<br />
They are thought to have been civilians supporting military work, such as operating and maintaining nuclear submarines and weapons, as well as a handful of military dentists and radiologists.<br />
<br />
The tests saw 22,000 troops, many on National Service, were ordered to watch dozens of atomic and hydrogen blasts, and live among the toxic fallout for up to a year afterwards.<br />
<br />
On their return they developed cancer and rare medical conditions, their wives had three times the normal rate of miscarriage and their children suffered deformities.<br />
<br />
The MoD said civilians with a recorded dose would be eligible for a compensation scheme.<br />
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>note I said while ago, the &quot;official safe doses etc&quot;  are a load of bollocks.<br />
This is why, as they can't have folk claiming compensation or the Public realizing how many cancer cases are linked to the fact we're STILL getting fallout from those insane above ground bomb tests!<br />
And lot of the &quot;official line&quot; for those was complete balls, be it the very first test (where fallout did spread across populated areas), to the first British bomb test (where they said the fallout wasn't that bad...BULLSHIT! was a re-do of USA's 5th bomb detonation and that was dirtier than hellfire)<br />
<br />
blech, can't find link, study showed fallout coming down from Stratosphere was 40% higher than expected.<br />
individually the risk is smaller, globally, the death toll cannot be anything other than enormous<br />
and I'll trust Sahkarov over the &quot;system&quot; on this!</div>

			NEW YORK –  Caitlyn Jenner excitedly wrote on Twitter “What the hell am I going to wear?” when it was announced that the reality star was to be honored at next month’s ESPY’s with the Arthur Ashe Award for Courage.  <br />
<br />
Caitlyn is the new female identity of former Olympic gold-medal winner Bruce Jenner, which was revealed Monday<br />
<br />
But now some are crying foul over ESPN’s decision to choose Jenner, 65, instead of Mount St. Joseph basketball player Lauren Hill, who courageously battled brain cancer while staying on the university team. The 19-year-old lost her fight against cancer on April 10.<br />
<br />
Several fans took to twitter to vent their frustration.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
But Hill wasn't the only overlooked candidate people were mad about. Iraq veteran Noah Galloway, who lost most of an arm and a leg fighting, but still competes in extreme sports and almost won this season's &quot;Dancing With the Stars,&quot; also had hundreds of tweets from fans irate over Jenner's choice.<br />
<br />
ESPN would only say to FOX411 of their decision-making process that “many people are discussed every year,” and that &quot;there is no such thing as a runner-up.&quot; They also provided a written statement which said Jenner was chosen &quot;to help move forward a constructive dialogue about progress and acceptance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mount St. Joseph University women's basketball coach Dan Benjamin told FOX411 his vote definitely would have been for Lauren.<br />
<br />
“I can only speak for the journey I went on with Lauren. I cannot speak to anyone else’s. Of course, I want Lauren to get the award,&quot; Benjamin said.<br />
<br />
But award or no award, Coach Benjamin is focused on carrying on Hill’s mission.<br />
<br />
“In Lauren’s words, if we can get closer to solving cancer, that would be the greatest award,&quot; he said. &quot;We’re biased here. We want to focus on Lauren’s mission to raise money and find a cure for DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma) through the charity she supported TheCureStartsNow.org.”<br />
<br />
As for those who are angry about ESPN's choice, Benjamin takes it in stride.<br />
<br />
“The best part of our country is the freedom of speech,&quot; he said. &quot;It’s more important to maintain her mission.”<br />
<br />
The Cure Starts Now foundation concurred: &quot;THIS is the greatest award that we could give to #LaurenHill. Today her most important legacy continues with the $4.5 million in new cancer research grant requests we have received this week alone (we have $2.7m to spend). For that, we hope that people continue to send donations to her tribute fund so that we can continue her mission to help other children battling cancer. This far surpasses any plaque or title that could be given to her.&quot;

			Dear American Consumer,<br />
<br />
This is The Wall Street Journal. We’re writing to ask if something is bothering you.<br />
<br />
The sun shined in April and you didn’t spend much money. The Commerce Department here in Washington says your spending didn’t increase at all adjusted for inflation last month compared to March. You appear to have mostly stayed home and watched television in December, January and February as well. We thought you would be out of your winter doldrums by now, but we don’t see much evidence that this is the case.<br />
<br />
You have been saving more too. You socked away 5.6% of your income in April after taxes, even more than in March. This saving is not like you. What’s up?<br />
<br />
We know you experienced a terrible shock when Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008 and your employer responded by firing you. We know stock prices collapsed and that was shocking too. We also know you shouldn’t have taken out that large second mortgage during the housing boom to fix up your kitchen with granite countertops.  You’ve been working very hard to pay off this debt and we admire your fortitude. But these shocks seem like a long time ago to us in a newsroom. Is that still what’s holding you back?<br />
<br />
Do you know the American economy is counting on you? We can’t count on the rest of the world to spend money on our stuff. The rest of the world is in an even worse mood than you are. You should feel lucky you’re not a Greek consumer. And China, well they’re truly struggling there just to reach the very modest goal of 7% growth.<br />
<br />
The Federal Reserve is counting on you too. Fed officials want to start raising the cost of your borrowing because they worry they’ve been giving you a free ride for too long with zero interest rates. We listen to Fed officials all of the time here at The Wall Street Journal, and they just can’t figure you out.<br />
<br />
Please let us know the problem. You can reach us at any of the emails below. (Editor’s Note: <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/06/03/grand-central-readers-sound-off-about-consumer-spending-sluggishness/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">We asked, you answered</a>.)<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />

			Readers reacted strongly to Tuesday’s Grand Central commentary, a tongue-in-cheek and ironic letter to American consumers asking why their spending had slowed in recent months.<br />
<br />
Household spending is a real puzzle at this moment. After growing slowly for much of the recovery, consumer spending appeared to be picking up early this year. It rose 3.4% in January from a year earlier, after adjusting for inflation, the fastest pace of the expansion. It seemed to be set to rise at a quicker clip in the coming months, thanks in large part to the recent decline in gasoline prices. Instead, spending slowed through April, a development that is puzzling economists. Why did spending slow early this year when households appeared, finally, to have some wind at their backs?<br />
<br />
We asked readers to respond. Here is a summation of what they said:<br />
<br />
A number commented on the tone of the commentary. While a small number found the tone to be clever, many found it offensive. Some said the item showed this reporter is arrogant, elitist and out of touch with the challenges faced by many Americans. That spoke to a broader mistrust that many respondents expressed toward a wide array of American institutions, including the Federal Reserve, banks, the media, corporations and the Obama Administration. Moreover many expressed a lack of conviction that the U.S. expansion would last, or that it was spreading prosperity beyond America’s elites.  Others described serious continuing financial burdens related to high debts, a rising cost of living, health care costs, and a lack of wage growth.<br />
<br />
The item was signed The Wall Street Journal’s Central Banks team. It was conceived and written only by this reporter.<br />
<br />
“Interest rates may be zero,” said reader Thomas Eckenrode, “but I know many people with credit card debt of $10,000 paying 15%.” He added student debt is an even bigger burden for his family.<br />
<br />
“Simply put the middle class is debt ridden and struggling,” said reader Nate York. “Many people are hunkering down instead of casually spending.”<br />
<br />
In a twist, car dealers Tuesday reported sales in May hit a 10-year high. That might be the first concrete sign of an actual pickup in spending this year. Judging solely from the responses of Wall Street Journal readers, however, you should not expect a big spending rebound. They say a deep undercurrent of mistrust and economic strain still holds back many Americans, regardless of what the numbers say.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So a very-higher-up's machine starts failing.<br />
<br />
Motherboard errors. (CMOS battery is bad, fails to register RAM the same each boot, sometimes fails to register keyboard or NIC, etc etc)<br />
<br />
Fine, it's 3 years old and under constant and heavy use. Pity that it's a four hour drive one way to get on site from here (and we're the closest site with IT personnel) but fine, that's what UPS and/or FedEx are for.<br />
<br />
I limp said person's machine along for the weekend, with an older backup machine so said person can work from home if needed for most things, and image and ship a replacement, after all, why send a tech to West Bumfuck Podunksville if we can just have the thing shipped here and have them stop out in the metro area, right?<br />
<br />
User has some proprietary apps.<br />
<br />
User has not had an on-site IT person for 3 years.<br />
<br />
Okay, fine, I track down the purchase orders for the licensing from LOOOONG before I started with the company and once the new machine arrives, I begin the installation process.<br />
<br />
One of these things includes installing Toad for Oracle.<br />
<br />
Now, this program (especially on a 64 bit machine) is a clusterfuck on the best of days.<br />
<br />
The installation process reads as follows:<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			Paraphrased to protect the helpful:<br />
<br />
Install the 64 bit client driver for 11g.<br />
<br />
Install the 32 bit version located at \\server\share\ribbit  These two don't seem to conflict so far.<br />
<br />
The installer checks the length of the %path% variable and it can only be 1023 bytes, so since the 32 bit version expands all variables (%windir% becomes &quot;C:\Windows\System32) you will need to cut portions of your path variable at random until it's under the limit, ensuring that the Oracle home location can be fully included. It's kind of a crap shoot.<br />
<br />
Once that's all done, fire up Toad and ensure it points to the correct Oracle Home (32 bit) client.

			The default included with the install is pretty old.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>add several more steps.<br />
<br />
Now, once I've gotten through that, I discover that I do not have ANY CONN STRINGS.<br />
<br />
So, okay, I get directed to one of the database admins on the oracle team.<br />
<br />
No response.<br />
<br />
Old machine is dead, so I can't exactly go digging around for .ora files.<br />
<br />
So the person whose machine is dead starts e-mailing people.<br />
<br />
Previously mentioned database admin FINALLY (after a day and change from first contact) responds with the following:<br />
<br />

			The latest tnsnames file should be in TFS

	</div>
</div>MOTHERFUCKER, IF I HAD ACCESS TO TO OUR TEAM FOUNDATION SERVER INSTANCE, DON'T YOU THINK I WOULD HAVE FUCKING LOOKED THERE?!?!?!<br />
<br />
THANK YOU VERY FUCKING MUCH, DEEPAK CHANDRAKUNT (not the real name) FOR ALL OF THAT I COULD HAVE ASKED SANTA CLAUS TO TAKE OFF FROM HIS GROTTO IN JALANDHAR AND SHOUT:<br />
<br />
ON DAVINDER!!!<br />
<br />
ON BALJEET SINGH!!!!<br />
<br />
AND MAYBE I MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN A FUCKING ORA FILE DROPPED DOWN THE CHIMNEY OF THE BUILDING FROM A PRINTOUT SPAT FROM AN ANCIENT HP LASERJET 5 AND IF I WAS LUCKY, IT MIGHT NOT HAVE CLOGGED UP THE HVAC AND OVERHEATED THE SERVER ROOM.<br />
<br />
Oooorrrr you could have just attached it to an e-mail since you know where it is.<br />
<br />
THANKS FOR COMING OUT.<br />
<br />
SO HAPPY YOU'RE IN YOUR OWN LITTLE FUCKING WORLD OVER THERE ON THE WEST COAST.</div>
