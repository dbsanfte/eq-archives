And the distinct UI -- though based on the unsuccessful Zune media player -- looked as if it would stand out from the crowd of mobile devices that have largely copied the iPhone UI, such as Google's Android, RIM's touch-oriented BlackBerry Storm, and Palm's WebOS.<br />
<br />
But that was just the lipstick. Now, in Microsoft's in-depth demo this week at the Mobile Beat conference, there's no mistaking the big pig behind the gloss. Seeing the UI in action across several tasks, not just in a highly controlled presentation, shows how awkward and unsophisticated it is -- I had the same feeling you get when you got a movie based on a great trailer, only to discover that all the good stuff was in the trailer and the rest of the movie was a mess. A pig, in fact.<br />
<br />
And it's not just the UI: Under the hood, Windows Phone 7 rests on creakingly old technology that the main competitors have all moved past.<br />
<br />
I was appalled, flummoxed, and stupefied by what I saw and the answers to the questions from the 15 or so developers in the audience. Also, it should be noted that minuscule attendance and the utter lack of passion in the room spoke volumes about Windows Phone 7's ultimate fate as well. By comparison, about five times as many people attended a session on WebOS.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is this: Windows Phone 7 is a pale imitation of the 2007-era iPhone. It's as if Microsoft decided in summer 2007 to copy the iPhone and has shut its developers in a bunker ever since, so they don't realize that several years have passed, that the iPhone has advanced, and that competitors such as Google Android and Palm WebOS have also pushed the needle forward. Microsoft is stuck in 2007, with a smartphone OS whose feature checklist might match that era's iPhone but whose fit and finish would look like a Pinto next to a Maserati.</div>
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div> Very disappointing. The UI looked gorgeous in the demo, and a UI that wasn't an apps-in-folders centric-model would have been great, if only for the &quot;opening up the possibilities for future development&quot; sense.</div>

			The Westboro Baptist Church congregation, famed for picketing the funerals of American soldiers and Twitter, has decided it's going to picket Comic-Con, too.<br />
<br />
The controversial church is lead by Fred Phelps, a man so crazy he makes an argument between Gary Busey and Mike Tyson, over whose turn it is to spoon with Barney the dinosaur, look like a normal conversation.<br />
<br />
The wrath of Phelp's church has fallen on Comic-Con after it decided that comic book fans' obsession of Batman and the Green Lantern is tantamount to worshiping false idols.<br />
<br />
The church issued this statement on its website: <br />
<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			<blockquote>Are you kidding?! [That is actually how it starts] If these people would spend even some of the energy that they spend on these comic books, reading the Bible, well no high hopes here.<br />
<br />
They have turned comic book characters into idols, and worship them they do!<br />
<br />
Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made: And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself: therefore forgive them not.<br />
<br />
It is time to put away the silly vanities and turn to God like you mean it. The destruction of this nation is imminent - so start calling on Batman and Superman now, see if they can pull you from the mess that you have created with all your silly idolatry.</blockquote>
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div> Harsh, completely off-the-wall, grammatically unconventional -- we can't wait to see what the cosplay crowd at Comic-Con will have to say in response.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Excellent. More of the same, yet so much annoying stuff removed.<br />
I completed it (70 stars, Peach saved, horraay!) with my 8-year old a couple of days ago.<br />
<br />
Pros: 2nd player has a lot more effect on the world, it's a lot more fun playing that role.<br />
Between-level spaceship cleaned up a lot, easier to access and get extra 1UP's than SMG1<br />
<br />
Cons: None, really. SMG1 refined. Highly recommended, best Mario platformer ever.<br />
If there are any cons, it is that it feels easier to get to princess Peach this time around, despite the fact that you need 70 stars instead of 60 in SMG1.</div>

			A Vineland woman made up not one but two dramatic stories to cover up the theft of a laptop computer, authorities said.<br />
<br />
Sara Blasse, 23, was in a Vineland Hospital Saturday when she told police that her arm was broken after she was thrown to the ground by a carjacker.<br />
<br />
Later she told police that she broke her arm in a car crash. She added that she was having sex with the driver, a male prostitute, when the car careered into a tree in Chesilhurst.<br />
<br />
Neither story held up. But the truth was nearly as outrageous.<br />
<br />
Authorities said Blasse and her boyfriend, Henry Goode Jr., 27, stole a laptop computer from a car early Saturday morning.<br />
<br />
The laptop's owner spotted the theft and called police. Goode, driving Blasse's Kia Sorrento, eluded police but crashed the car into a tree at Atlantic and Sherman Avenues in Chesilhurst. The impact broke Blasse's arm, said Jason Laughlin, spokesman for the Camden County Prosecutor's office.<br />
<br />
To cover up the crash, Goode and Blasse tried to torch the car. When they failed to ignite the gas tank, Goode and Blasse fled in different directions, Laughlin said.<br />
<br />
Goode broke into a South Jersey Gas facility in Winslow and allegedly stole one of the company's vans, driving it through a fence. He abandoned the van in Atlantic County where he tried to light it on fire. Again he failed. He fled to his home in nearby Newtownville, Laughlin said.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Blasse called Goode's brother to take her to a hospital. Instead he took her to his home, where her parents collected her and drove her to South Jersey Healthcare Regional Medical Center in Vineland. It was there she spun the carjacking and male prostitute stories for police, Laughlin said.<br />
<br />
Goode was arrested at his home Wednesday. The stolen laptop was returned to its owner, Laughlin said.<br />
<br />
Blasse and Goode were charged with aggravated arson, burglary, two counts of theft and related counts. Blasse was released on bail and Goode is being held at the Camden County Jail.

			Tinkerbell is getting ready to take flight at Disney in &quot;Tink,&quot; a live-action romantic comedy that has Elizabeth Banks attached to star and Adam Shankman, Jennifer Gibgot and McG guiding the pic's flightplan to the bigscreen as producers.<br />
<br />
Concept for the project, for which the deals are being wrapped up, plays with the mischievous nature of the Tinkerbell character. It was developed by Banks with Max Handelman, who co-runs the thesp's production shingle, Brownstone Prods., and Matt Smith of Offspring Entertainment. Offspring, the shingle run by Shankman and Gibgot, is based on the Disney lot. McG and Mary Viola will produce through their Wonderland Entertainment banner.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth Wright Shapiro, who helped develop the project, along with McG, will write the script.<br />
<br />
Credit Smith for getting so many filmmakers aflutter over &quot;Tink.&quot;<br />
<br />
The development exec initially worked with Banks and Handelman on the project while at Wonderland and continued to champion the pic after moving to Offspring.<br />
<br />
Shapiro and Banks have collaborated on projects in the past. They include &quot;Keiko,&quot; to which Banks is attached to direct. Shapiro will write and star in the pic. Scribe is also set to guest star in FX's &quot;The League&quot; and appear in Ruben Fleischer's &quot;30 Minutes or Less.&quot; Ted Hope and Anne Carrey's This Is That will produce &quot;Keiko.&quot; <br />
<br />
Scribe also penned &quot;Allies With Benefits,&quot; which Scott Free is set to produce. <br />
<br />
Project is the latest from Banks' shingle to land a home at a studio. <br />
<br />
Banks' Brownstone shingle most recently produced Disney's sci-fi thriller &quot;The Surrogates,&quot; with Mandeville Films. It also has &quot;Forever 21&quot; at DreamWorks and &quot;Pitch Perfect,&quot; at Universal.<br />
<br />
Banks stars in Paul Haggis' &quot;The Next Three Days,&quot; opposite Russell Crowe, and &quot;The Details,&quot; with Tobey Maguire. She is filming the comedy &quot;My Idiot Brother&quot; and will continue to guest on NBC's &quot;30 Rock.&quot;<br />
<br />
She is repped by UTA and Untitled Entertainment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tink&quot; becomes the second high-profile pic Offspring has set up in days, following a workplace laffer starring Zac Efron that it will produce at Warner Bros. and Efron's production shingle, Ninjas Runnin' Wild. It has &quot;Step Up 3D&quot; and &quot;Going the Distance&quot; bowing from Disney and New Line in August.

			An Iranian scientist who said he was kidnapped by the CIA has said he was subjected to extreme mental and physical torture by the Americans.<br />
<br />
Shahram Amiri, who has flown from the US to Tehran, also denied being heavily involved in Iran's nuclear programme.<br />
<br />
He disappeared last year and resurfaced this week in the Pakistani embassy in Washington asking to be repatriated.<br />
<br />
The US said he had been in the country &quot;of his own free will&quot; and denied he was tortured.<br />

<br />
Wearing a beige suit, a smiling Mr Amiri was greeted at Tehran's international airport early on Thursday morning by his tearful son and wife, along with other family members and Deputy Foreign Minister Hassan Qashqavi.<br />
<br />
Speaking at a news conference afterwards, he repeated his earlier claims that he had been abducted by US agents while undertaking the Hajj pilgrimage in the Saudi Arabian city of Medina.<br />
<br />
Mr Amiri said he was placed under intense pressure by his interrogators to co-operate in the first months following his alleged kidnapping.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was under the harshest mental and physical torture,&quot; he said, adding that Israeli agents had been present during the interrogations and that the CIA had offered him $50m (£32.8m) to remain in the US.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Americans wanted me to say that I defected to America of my own will to use me for revealing some false information about Iran's nuclear work. But with God's will, I resisted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr Amiri offered no evidence, but said he would eventually.<br />

He also denied he had been heavily involved in Iran's nuclear programme, saying he was a &quot;simple researcher who was working at a university&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not involved in any confidential jobs. I had no classified information.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had nothing to do with the Natanz and Fordo sites,&quot; he said, referring to Iran's two uranium enrichment plants.<br />
<br />
Unconfirmed reports that he worked for Iran's atomic energy organisation were &quot;a tool the US government brought up for political pressure&quot;.<br />
<br />
Mr Qashqavi thanked the scientist for his &quot;resistance to pressure&quot;.<br />
<br />
He rejected suggestions that Mr Amiri's return was linked to a possible deal to release three US hikers who have been detained in Iran since 2009.<br />
'Breakdown'<br />
<br />
In the US, unnamed officials and security sources said that Mr Amiri defected and was put into a programme similar to a witness-protection scheme.<br />
<br />
Later, he apparently became concerned for family members he had left behind, had a breakdown and decided to return to Iran, US reports claim.<br />

A US official told the BBC: &quot;He provided useful information to the United States. The Iranians now have him. In terms of win-loss, it's not even a close call.&quot;<br />
<br />
The official said Mr Amiri was not held in the US against his will, had lived there freely and had chosen freely to return to Iran. <br />
<br />
In its online edition, The Washington Post newspaper quoted unnamed officials saying Mr Amiri had been working for the CIA for more than a year and was paid $5m (£3.3m).<br />
<br />
In June, the Iranian government announced that it had handed evidence to the US that the scientist had been abducted.<br />
<br />
It came shortly after Mr Amiri appeared in two videos posted on the internet giving conflicting stories about how he had arrived in the US.<br />
<br />
He said in the first that he had been kidnapped by CIA and Saudi agents while on a pilgrimage. In the second message, he said he had gone to the US to improve his education and was living freely in Arizona.<br />
<br />
In a third message posted on the internet later that month, Mr Amiri said he had escaped from US custody and was on the run in Virginia.<br />
<br />
In an interview with Iranian state Press TV before he left the US, Mr Amiri said he was in Medina when three men in a van posing as fellow pilgrims offered him a ride.<br />
<br />
&quot;As I sat down, the man in back held a gun toward me and told me to keep quiet,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;They took me to a secret place and injected me, and when I woke up I saw myself in a huge airplane,&quot; and was taken to the US.<br />
<br />
The US state department repeatedly denied it had kidnapped him, but never said that he was not in the country.<br />
<br />
However on Tuesday, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton acknowledged publicly for the first time that the scientist was indeed in the US.

Due to our pro-torture stance under Cheney/Bush there is no way to repudiate this. The fact we haven't 100% closed Guantanamo also leaves Obama complicit. I'd say I 75% believe this man's statement.</div>

Does this sound familiar to anyone?<br />
<br />
Right now our site does this huge &quot;Loading&quot; animation on each postback which I hate and which I'm trying to get replaced.  Just changing the cursor would be ideal IMHO.<br />
<br />
I've seen code that will display the hourglass, but that's not what I'm looking for - I want an actual AJAX &quot;loading&quot; animation next to the mouse pointer.<br />

Help?</div>

		<hr />
		
			The Georgia Guidestones is a large granite monument in Elbert County, Georgia, USA. A message comprising ten guides is inscribed on the structure in eight modern languages, and a shorter message is inscribed at the top of the structure in four ancient languages' scripts: Babylonian, Classical Greek, Sanskrit, and Egyptian hieroglyphs.<br />
<br />
The structure is sometimes referred to as an &quot;American Stonehenge.&quot;[1] The monument is almost 20 feet (6.1 m) tall if the buried support stones are included, exactly 18 feet (5.5 m) otherwise[2], and made from six granite slabs weighing more than 240,000 pounds (110,000 kg) in all.[3] One slab stands in the center, with four arranged around it. A capstone lies on top of the five slabs, which are astronomically aligned. An additional stone tablet, which is set in the ground a short distance to the west of the structure, provides some notes on the history and purpose of the Guidestones.<br />
<br />
In June 1979, an unknown person or persons under the pseudonym R. C. Christian hired Elberton Granite Finishing Company to build the structure.[3] One popular hypothesis is that the patron's pseudonym may be a tribute to the legendary 14th-century founder of Rosicrucianism, Christian Rosenkreuz.[3]<br />
<br />
[edit] Inscriptions<br />
A message consisting of a set of ten guidelines or principles is engraved on the Georgia Guidestones in eight different languages, one language on each face of the four large upright stones. Moving clockwise around the structure from due north, these languages are: English, Spanish, Swahili, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese, and Russian.<br />
<br />
1.Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.<br />
2.Guide reproduction wisely - improving fitness and diversity.<br />
3.Unite humanity with a living new language.<br />
4.Rule passion - faith - tradition - and all things with tempered reason.<br />
5.Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts.<br />
6.Let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a world court.<br />
7.Avoid petty laws and useless officials.<br />
8.Balance personal rights with social duties.<br />
9.Prize truth - beauty - love - seeking harmony with the infinite.<br />
10.Be not a cancer on the earth - Leave room for nature - Leave room for nature.[4]<br />
[edit] Explanatory tablet<br />
 <br />
The explanatory tablet, immediately west of the edifice.A few feet to the west of the artifact, an additional granite ledger has been set level with the ground. This tablet identifies the structure and the languages used on it, lists various facts about the size, weight, and astronomical features of the stones, the date it was installed, and the sponsors of the project. It also speaks of a time capsule buried under the tablet, but the positions on the stone reserved for filling in the dates on which the capsule was buried and is to be opened are missing, so it is not clear whether the time capsule was ever put in place. Each side of the tablet is perpendicular to one of the cardinal directions, and is inscribed so that the northern edge is the &quot;top&quot; of the inscription.<br />
<br />
The complete text of the explanatory tablet is detailed below. The accompanying image shows the overall layout. The tablet is somewhat inconsistent with respect to punctuation, and also misspells &quot;pseudonym&quot;. The original spelling, punctuation, and line breaks in the text have been preserved in the transcription which follows.<br />
<br />
At the center of each tablet edge is a small circle, each containing a letter representing the appropriate compass direction (N, S, E, W).<br />
<br />
At the top center of the tablet is written:<br />
<br />
The Georgia Guidestones<br />
Center cluster erected March 22, 1980<br />
<br />
Immediately below this is the outline of a square, inside which is written:<br />
<br />
Let these be guidestones to an Age of Reason<br />
<br />
Around the edges of the square are written the names of four ancient languages, one per edge. Starting from the top and proceeding clockwise, they are:<br />
<br />
Babylonian cuneiform<br />
Classical Greek<br />
Sanskrit<br />
Egyptian hieroglyphics<br />
On the left side of the tablet is the following column of text:<br />
<br />
Astronomic Features<br />
1. channel through stone<br />
indicates celestial pole.<br />
2. horizontal slot indicates<br />
annual travel of sun.<br />
3. sunbeam through capstone<br />
marks noontime throughout<br />
the year<br />
<br />
Author: R.C. Christian<br />
(a pseudonyn) [sic]<br />
<br />
Sponsors: A small group<br />
of Americans who seek<br />
the Age of Reason<br />
<br />
Time Capsule<br />
Placed six feet below this spot<br />
On<br />
To Be Opened on<br />
<br />
The words appear as shown under the time capsule heading; no dates are engraved.<br />
<br />
[edit] Physical data<br />

Below the two columns of text is written the caption:<br />
<br />
GUIDESTONE LANGUAGES<br />
<br />
The names of eight modern languages are inscribed along the long edges of the projecting rectangles, one per edge. Starting from due north and moving clockwise around so that the upper edge of the northeast rectangle is listed first, they are:<br />
<br />
English<br />
Spanish<br />
Swahili<br />
Hindi<br />
Hebrew<br />
Arabic<br />
Chinese<br />
Russian<br />
At the bottom center of the tablet is the following text:<br />
<br />
Additional information available at Elberton Granite Museum &amp; Exhibit<br />
College Avenue<br />
Elberton, Georgia<br />
<br />
[edit] Astronomical features<br />
The four outer stones are oriented to mark the limits of the 18.6 year lunar declination cycle.[2] The center column features a hole through which the North Star can be seen regardless of time, as well as a slot that is aligned with the Sun's solstices and equinoxes. A 7/8&quot; aperture in the capstone allows a ray of sun to pass through at noon each day, shining a beam on the center stone indicating the day of the year.[3]<br />
<br />
[edit] Location<br />
34°13&#8242;55&#8243;N 82°53&#8242;40&#8243;W&#65279; / &#65279;34.231984°N 82.894506°W&#65279; / 34.231984; -82.894506<br />
<br />
The Georgia Guidestones are located on a hilltop in Elbert County, Georgia, approximately 90 miles (140 km) east of Atlanta, 45 miles (72 km) from Athens, and 9 miles (14 km) north of the center of Elberton. The stones are standing on a rise a short distance to the east of Georgia Highway 77 (Hartwell Highway), and are visible from that road. Small signs beside the highway indicate the turnoff for the Guidestones, which is identified by a street sign as &quot;Guidestones Rd.&quot; It is located on the highest point in Elbert County.<br />
<br />
[edit] Ownership<br />
Elbert County owns the Georgia Guidestones site. Robert C. Christian deeded the five acres to the county immediately upon purchase from Wayne Mullenix.[2] According to the Georgia Mountain Travel Association's detailed history: &quot;The Georgia Guidestones are located on the farm of Mildred and Wayne Mullenix...&quot;[5] The Elbert County land registration system shows what appears to be the Guidestones as County land purchased on October 1, 1979. [6][7]<br />
<br />
The monument was unveiled in March 1980, with the presence of 100 people.[8] Another account specifies the 22nd of March and said 400 people attended.[2][3]<br />
<br />
[edit] Reactions<br />
In his article, &quot;Decoding the Georgia Guidestones&quot;, Van Smith identifies three potential candidates as the true identity of R.C. Christian (Joe H. Fendley Sr., Dr. Francis Merchant, and Ted Turner). In the end, Smith concludes that Ted Turner is the most likely candidate for being R.C. Christian, stating, &quot;Our investigation into the identity of Robert C. Christian has uncovered highly persuasive yet circumstantial evidence linking Robert Edward “Ted” Turner to the very center of the Georgia Guidestones originators. This evidence is so strong that we believe Ted Turner probably was R.C. Christian. At the very least, Turner probably knows who R.C. Christian is.&quot; [2]<br />
<br />
Yoko Ono and others have praised the inscribed messages as &quot;a stirring call to rational thinking&quot;, while opponents have labeled them as the &quot;Ten Commandments of the Antichrist&quot;.[3]<br />
<br />
The Guidestones have become a subject of interest for conspiracy theorists. One of them, an activist named Mark Dice, demanded that the Guidestones &quot;be smashed into a million pieces, and then the rubble used for a construction project&quot;,[9] claiming that the Guidestones are of &quot;a deep Satanic origin,&quot; and that R. C. Christian, belongs to &quot;a Luciferian secret society&quot; related to the New World Order.[3] At the unveiling of the monument, a local minister proclaimed that he believed the monument was &quot;for sun worshipers, for cult worship and for devil worship&quot;.[8]<br />
<br />
Another popular conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones, in his 2008 documentary 'Endgame: Elite's Blueprint For Global Enslavement' highlights &quot;the message of the mysterious Georgia Guidestones, purportedly built by representatives of a secret society called the Rosicrucian Order, which call for a global religion, world courts, and for population levels to be maintained at around 500 million, over a 5.5 billion reduction from current levels. The stones infer that humans are a cancer upon the earth and should be culled in order to maintain balance with nature.&quot;[10]<br />
<br />
Researcher Van Smith claims to have uncovered numerological messages encoded within the proportions of the various Georgia Guidestones components that link the monument to the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world which opened in Dubai over thirty years after the Georgia Guidestones were designed. Smith presents evidence demonstrating that the opening date of the tower, the death of Dubai's emir, Sheik Maktoum bin Rashid al Maktoum, and the exact height of the Burj Khalifa can all be deduced directly from the proportions of the granite slabs.[11]<br />
<br />
In 2008, the stones were defaced with polyurethane paint and graffiti with slogans such as &quot;Death to the new world order.&quot;[12] Wired magazine called the defacement &quot;the first serious act of vandalism in the Guidestones' history&quot;.[3] More recently, in an apparent attempt to topple the monument, a large notch was cut from the top of the English language Guidestone near the 8&quot; long, 1&#8541;&quot; thick stainless steel dowel pin used to secure that slab to the capstone.[2]<br />
<br />
As of November 14, 2009 (2009 -11-14)[update], the stones bear a variety of graffiti. Elbert County is funding ongoing repair and has installed two video surveillance cameras at the site.[2]<br />

</div> interestingly weird. it must have cost a hell of a lot to build since it's solid granite. (1979, before water or other more exotic cutting methods were used. granite's one tough bitch, so rather expensive to carve.)<br />
so either there's some genuine weirdness out there or someone created a brilliant practical joke that may last millenia!<br />
<br />
hm, if I win the lottery, I will make a granite d20, 50' high inscribed with fertlity symbols, and any odd word I can find from &quot;Tsathoggua&quot; to &quot;Torcer&quot;! :grinyes:</div>
