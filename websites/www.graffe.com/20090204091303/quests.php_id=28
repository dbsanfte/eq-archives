    wizard armor quests. Shana Liskia gives out the quest and can be found in 
    the caster's guild in West Freeport.</font></p>

    <p><font size="2">You say, 'I am ready to begin'<br>
    <br>
    Shana Liskia says 'Very well. Here you are Gemdiver, in this box you will 
    combine specific component recipes as I mentioned before. When you are ready 
    to attempt a specific piece you must tell me what piece you [want] to craft. 
    For example if you had intent on crafting a cap you would say, [I want to 
    craft a cap]. I can offer you the recipes for Arcane Scientists [Caps], 
    [Bracers], [Sleeves], [Sandals], [Trousers], [Gloves] and [Robes]. I must 
    also suggest that you attempt your robe last due to the difficult nature of 
    collecting the correct components.'</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" color="#CC99FF">.:: You receive a enchanted sewing kit. 
    All items are combined first in this kit, then in the loom which is located 
    next to Shana ::.</font><font size="2"><br>

    You say, 'I want to craft a cap'<br>
    <br>
    Shana Liskia says 'A cap will keep you safe from any attackers as well as 
    the elements. To create your cap material you will need to combine 2 Woven 
    Spider Silks, 1 Snake Fang, 1 Chunk of Meat and a Cloth Cap in your assembly 
    kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a loom along with 
    this mold to fashion your very own Arcane Scientists Cap.'</font></p>

    Shana Liskia says 'I have a trinket that was given to me by my mother a long 
    time ago. Before she died I told her I would always keep it close to me. 
    Recently, some militia officers came in to our academy and confiscated 
    anything that appeared to be valuable. Fearing for my life I did not fight 
    to keep the necklace my mother gave me. The officer that took it was named 
    Teridsan. If you should find him you have my permission to kill him if 
    that's what it takes to get my necklace back. Return to me when you have my 
    necklace along with 2 Lion Teeth.'</font></p>
