If you are interested in acquiring Tishan's Kilt, you must take a Shadowed Ball from our mortal enemies the Shadowed Men and bring it to Trankia in the Everfrost Mountains.
<HR>
Trankia is in Everfrost (loc is about +3030 by -2395).
<HR>
Giving Trankia the shadowed ball will result in her talking to you.
<HR>
Trankia says 'You must be another one from Vilissia. I will tell you what I tell all the others – you must help me [avenge] my [brother] before I will help you attain Tishan's Kilt. 
<HR>
At this point, she gives you your first of two notes as well, basically it says a reminder of your deed.
<HR>
<b>You say, 'How can I avenge your brother?'</b>
<HR>
Trankia says 'My brother was part of a raiding party that adventured into the Caverns of Guk. Somewhere within he was betrayed and left for dead by the dastardly brother of Karg IceBear – Martar. I want you to find me what remains of my brothers body and bring it back to me. I am told that he died within a mine shaft. 
<HR>
The mine shaft is more a section of Upper Guk that is a little like a maze. The exact location of the mob you are looking for is +1420 by +340, a Froglok called a Shinta Warrior. There are two other Froglok warriors next to him who will aggro to you as well. The Shinta seems to always drop a barbarian head.
<HR>
After you give the head to Trankia -
<HR>
Trankia says 'Oh Wulfthan, look what has become of you. I told you that you should not have trusted Martar. - as a final service, I want you to kill Martar IceBear for me. He is known to roam these parts. Bring me the Warthread Kilt that he wears and my two reminder notes, and I will give to you Tishan's Kilt. 
<HR>
You get your second note at this point in time as well.
<HR>
Find and kill Martar IceBear in Permafrost.
<HR>
Now take the kilt, and the two notes you previously obtained to Trankia, and she will give you Tishan's kilt.
