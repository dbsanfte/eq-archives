This boat is just one of many quaddable areas in Dulak's Harbor.  I like it because its fun and different, plus has nice loot.  Mobs are blue to lvl 58 and they drop sheilds, harpoons and axes worth around 4 pp plus or minus.  Plus research pages, various meats and, most importantly, gems such as sapphires, star rubys, peridots, diamonds and blue diamonds.  Usually I have gotten one gem per boat clearing.  Mobs commonly drop 5-6 plat.  Destroy the shivs you get they are worthless.  Also you get the odd quest item (Deepwater emblem, Dandolak Insignia, and Xoomix Quarterstaff have dropped for me).

Enter the boat and take an immediate right.  Your safe spot is along this side of the deck between the entry ramp and the anchor that is laying down on the deck.  Med here, go afk here, camp here, etc.<br><br>

<b>Preparation</b><br><br>

From the safe spot looking out towards the boat you will see a guy on the opposite side, two guys by a rockpile and a fourth guy will be behind the mast.  Go around the mast, target the guy near the mast then head back to your safe spot.  Move towards the prow along the side of the boat just past the anchor that is lying there and face the rockpile mobs, keeping them both in your targetable field of view while keeping the one behind the mast targeted.  Now you're ready to start the quad.<br><br>

<b>Snaring</b><br><br>

Cast snare on the mob you have targeted (the one you can't see behind the mast) and if snare holds immediately target the farthest rockpile mob and cast snare upon refresh.  If snare holds target the closest rockpile mob and cast snare upon refresh.  The trick here is to make sure you don't have to waste time turning and you can snare three mobs without moving.  As soon as the last snare cast is over turn right and run towards the prow.  Often you are doing this just as the mast mob arrives and gives you a whack or two.  Turn and run towards the mast, targeting the final mob while you are running if you can. Otherwise stop by the mast. Snare him.<br><br>

**If snare is resisted on any one mob then you need to run towards the prow and circle back towards the mast veering around any mobs by a moderate distance.  You can just get enough distance to root without injury if you run to where the steps on your right begin.  There is a mob there but he wont aggro if you dont climb the steps.  If root is resisted run back towards the prow and try again.  The other mobs standing around wont aggro so long as you give them a moderate berth.  You'll get a feel for what you can get away with after a couple of tries.**<br><br>

<b>Quadding</b><br><br>

Once all four are snared you bunch them up by running around the mast or the rockpile.  I do this in first person watching where the mobs are out of the corner of my screen.  Be sure to resnare once the mobs are rebunched.<br><br>

The quad route is between the prow side of the rockpile and the base of the stairs on the far side from the boat entrance.  Give the other mobs a moderate distance.  Basically don't run right up to them and yu'll be fine.  The quad is a straight back and forth.  I like to circle to my left after completing each pillar cast for the next run.<br><br>

<b>Cleaning Up the Rest of the Boat</b><br><br>

Once you have those mobs cleared the next quad will be easier for you.  One mob on either stair, plus one near the cabin, plus grab one from the upper deck.  Quad them just like the first four.  You can flux these mobs, encircle and snare them all at once.  Just run between the prow and about halfway up the stair to get distance for the snare.<br><br>  

The final 'quad' is the three left up on the upper deck.  Its trickier because the space is so small up there and you dont want to bring them down because the first quad will be respawning sometime during this quad.  The deck is small up there but a quad is doable without focus.  Quad route up there is between the upper step of the near stairs and the opposite diagonal corner.<br><br>

<b>Notes:</b>  Captain Rockbelly spawns on the rockpile, far side of the boat from the entrance side.  He is not any tougher than the other mobs so include him in your quadding just like any other stiff.  He drops some melee gear including a rare tunic with Regen II as its effect.<br><br>

<b>P.S.</b> I am assuming the reader knows the basics of quadding.  Like have snare and root memmed, know your quadding damage spells, and have the run speed 3 AA or use SOW potions so you can run.  Also you should have the Staff of Temperate Flux (for 'fluxing' mobs).</td></tr></table></body></html>
