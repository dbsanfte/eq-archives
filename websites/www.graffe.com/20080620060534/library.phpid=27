purchased Reflect thinking it was nothing but a goof off spell. I'll admit, when 
I first got it I didn't understand its potential at all; I thought it would be 
useless in the majority of situations including PvP... was I wrong.

Reflect rocks if you enjoy pulling (which I do a lot of in LDoN) for example.<br>
<br>
For those of you that don't know Reflect is a new L58 LDoN spell and can be 
purchased in the Everfrost area for 510 adventure points. Reflect does what its 
name suggests, it has a chance to reflect a spell back at the original caster (DDs 
do less damage on a reflect). It works strictly on player-castable spells. This 
means that if an NPC is casting Ice Spear of Solist on a Wizard with reflect up 
that spell has a chance of being sent back at him. However, if the NPC is 
casting a non-player spell (such as Deathtouch) it will not work. A successfully 
reflected spell WILL NOT affect the original target in any way.<br>
<br>
From my tests Reflect will send back ANY type (nuke, debuff, pbae, targetable ae, 
etc.) of spell provided it meets the following criteria...<br>
<br>
1. It is a player-castable spell.<br>
2. It can be resisted (ie. no tash / malo).<br>
<br>
Some examples of Reflect in action...<br>
<br>
<b>Damage Over Time Spells</b> <br>
Yes, Reflect will send DoTs back at the caster and at full strength. You will 
even get the damage messages each tick...<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<b>Snares and Roots</b> <br>
Reflect can send snares and roots back at the target! This also means that YOU 
avoid them! Take note that reflections can be resisted.<br>

<br>
<br>
<b>Theft of Thought Series</b> <br>
You can reflect Theft of Thought and the like, but not manasieve (it is 
unresistable). On a successful Theft of Thought reflection the original target 
of the spell will gain mana and the original caster of the sieve will lose it.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<b>Mesmerization Spells</b> <br>
YES!!! Reflect WILL reflect mez spells RIGHT BACK at the Enchanter!! <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<b>Slows</b><br>
Though unlikely this will be cast on you, slows CAN be reflected back.<br>
<br>
<img src="http://www.tritonguild.com/rombus/reflect/slow.gif" border="0" alt width="256" height="27">
<br>
<br>
<b>PBAE / Targetable AEs</b> <br>
Gravity Flux and other AEs can be reflected. This includes PBAEs.<br>
<br>
<img src="http://www.tritonguild.com/rombus/reflect/gflux.gif" border="0" alt width="328" height="79">
<br>
<br>
<b>Stuns</b> <br>
Stuns can be reflected as well.<br>
<br>
<img src="http://www.tritonguild.com/rombus/reflect/stuns.gif" border="0" alt width="374" height="53">
<br>
<br>
(that's a nuke with a stun component... I tested it with a Cleric though and 
pure stun spells will indeed be reflected)<br>
<br>
Now, what Reflect cannot do...<br>
<br>
<b>Harmtouch</b> <br>
Sadly HT cannot be reflected. Woe is me~<br>
<br>
<img src="http://www.tritonguild.com/rombus/reflect/harmtouch.gif" border="0" alt width="377" height="66">
<br>
<br>
Dispell also cannot be reflected, though I was unable to EVER dispell Reflect, 
so that's good.<br>
<br>
Reflections of damage or duration spells will not receive a focus enhancement.<br>
<br>
So there you have it, some preliminary tests on Reflect. Spells that were deemed 
unreflectable were tested at least 8 times before I gave up. Reflecting a life 
tap WILL result in you gaining life as well.<br>
<br>
To be tested...<br>
<br>
1. Player-castable procs.<br>
2. Bard songs.<br>
<br>
Feel free to contribute, make suggestions for my tests, or ask questions.

Hope this was interesting to some of you; I am certainly enjoying this spell.</font></p></td></tr></table></body></html>
