Aid Grimel says 'Thank you for offering to help Korteal. Take this breastplate and clean it with a diluted acid wash to get all of the debris out of it. Brew the wash by combining acid and a three celestial essence's. Once the armor is cleaned, coat it with hurricane temper. Finally add two black diamonds of nightmare to the breastplate. This should provide adequate protection for our next journey.' 
<HR>
Turn in the finished Breastplate for a Leather Signet (Do not throw away the Leather Signet) and the following text:
<HR>
Aid Grimel smiles. 'What a wonderful job! Councilman Taldarius shall wear this on our next adventure, I am sure he will find it more protective than his old one. Take this signet as a token of my gratitude. If you are not too busy I have another task, do you have any brewing skill?'

Part 2: Brewing. 
<HR>
Skill Requirement: Between 218 Brewing and 224 Brewing. 
<HR>
Flag Requirement: Terris Thule. 
<HR>
Grimel will give you a portable Brew Barrel with 4 slots in it, as well as 1 Fermenting Dust. You will need to ask him twice for more Fermenting Dust, and will be making a Portable Drink. 
<HR>
Original text: 
<HR>
<b>You say, 'I have skill in brewing' </b>
<HR>
Aid Grimel says 'I bet you could make a wicked brew! However I am forced to drink a refreshing drink while out adventuring. I do have this powder that will give the best drinks quite a bite though. Mix the powder in with two Kaladim Constitutionals and a flask of pure water. If you need more dust just ask for it! Put three twice brewed constitutionals and the signet in this drink barrel. As hard as drink barrels are to get these days, you need to return it to me along with the drink you create with it' 
<HR>
(Aside: And yes, you CAN combine normal brewing combines in it! Only up to 4 slots though. It is unknown if this was intended or not.) 
<HR>
Turn in the Portable Drink and Portable Brew Barrel to receive a Clay Signet and the following text:
<HR>
Aid Grimel gulps down a Twice Brewed Kaladim Constitutional and Burps loudly! 'Ahhhh that was refreshing! That should hold me over for quite some time. I see you are quite deft of hand, perhaps you would care to put your jewel craft skills to the test?'

Part 3: Jewelcraft. 
<HR>
Skill requirement: Between 177 skill and 225 Jewelcraft skill. (220 Raw skill assumed) 
<HR>
Flag requirement: Saryrn. 
<HR>
At this point, Grimel will give you Etching Dust and ask that you make him a new ring from the previous signet. You will need to head to Velious to gather some velium bars that are needed, and will also need to head to Eastern Wastes, locate Tain Hammerfrost, and do his quest in order to procure a Coldain Smithy Hammer. After combining, you will get a rather tempting Velium Blue Diamond Ring with Enduring Breath on it to hand in--and NOT have returned--for a Wooden Signet and some experience. 
<HR>
Original text: 
<HR>
<b>You say, 'I would like to put my jewel craft skills to the test.' </b>
<HR>
Aid Grimel says 'My hand was crushed when I used it to deflect a blow from a War Boar that was headed towards Taldarius's back. For some time afterwards my hand was crippled but Brell saw to it I regained full use of it. The ring I used to wear was damaged beyond repair and my hand was never steady enough to etch a new one. If you would make me a new one by combing a mounted blue diamond, the etching dust and etching tools in a jewelry kit. Then take the faceted gem and combine it with a bar of pure enchanted velium and my signet. I have no idea how the pure bars are made. You may want to seek the help of the ice dwarves.' 
<HR>
Go to Thurgadin, hail Meg Tucker with the appropriate trigger text for a clarifying response. 
<HR>
<b>You say, 'what bar of pure enchanted velium' </b>
<HR>
Meg Tucter says 'Wow that is an odd request Korteal. Very rarely do we make an item that requires a pure bar of metal. Pure enchanted velium bars are made by combing three enchanted velium bars in a forge along with a coldain velium temper, pure water and a Coldain smithy hammer. Tis quite expensive but it enables the crafter to obtain pure working materials.' 
<HR>
Meg also gives you the Etching tools. 
<HR>
You say, 'I need a set of Etching Tools' 
Meg Tucter says 'Oh, really? There are not many that work in faceting gems. I am surprised to see your interest. You can have this old set of mine. If you are working with Royal Velium and want to give it to someone else, you can use these etching tools and your jewelers kit to engrave the piece for them. Be careful though, because once the armor is engraved you cannot remove it and it will be useless to the Dain. There is no need to return the tools, Talem recently made me a new sturdy set. Brell bless him.' 
<HR>
And when you finally hand in the ring, the text Grimel gives is: 
<HR>
Aid Grimel grins. 'Quite a nice ring you have made for me Iustus. May it serve me as well as my old ring. Here take this signet. We seem to be finishing the tasks on my list at a nice pace. Tell me when you are ready to use some clay.'

Part 4: Pottery. 
<HR>
Skill requirement: Between 200 and 250 Pottery. (220 Pottery assumed.) 
<HR>
Flag requirement: Pack of Notes from Vallon Zek 
<HR>
Now Grimel will give you an urn pattern and ask you to make a Sacred Urn and fill it up with Sacred Water--to replace one that was destroyed in the Plane of War--and to cap it with your signet from the Jewelcrafting part of the quest. Pretty straightforward. After making the, start heading over to the Plane of Valor and camping "the knights in the tents in Valor" as Khoren puts it for Sacred Water. After filling up the Urn with Water and your signet, combine for the Filled Sacred Urn and turn it in for the REALLY promising Metal Signet. 
<HR>
Original text: 
<HR>
<b>You say, 'I am ready to use some clay.' </b>
<HR>
Aid Grimel says 'On our last tome gathering expedition a stray arrow in the Plane of War struck our urn filled with sacred water. It was quite a waste of sacred water! Three large enchanted blocks of clay, three lacquered opals, a vial of purified mana, a ceramic lining, sculpting tools and the urn pattern should make an unfired urn. The urn is so large you will need to fire it with three divine crystalline glazes. Once you have the urn it needs to be filled with three sacred waters and the signet as a cap.'

Part 5: Tailoring. 
<HR>
Skill requirement: < 250 Tailoring 
<HR>
Flag requirement: Solusek Ro / Plane of Fire 
<HR>
After the grueling work of finding different components, the item Grimel wants you to make in Tailoring...is surprisingly simple--with the only risky step being the final combine. All it is essentially is a Robe of Eternal Fire with two extra, (relatively) easy to get components: A Vial of Purified Mana and your previous Signet. However, the success rate on the robe may drive you nuts. 
<HR>
Original text: 
<HR>
<b>You say, 'I am skilled with the needle' </b>

Aid Grimel says 'I appreciate the help Demorgoth. I need a new tunic made for Councilman Taldarius. Last trip through the Plane of Disease, one of those flies spit mucus on him and it dripped through his armor seams! The result was a gooey mess that ate away all the leather underneath. It was a blessing he was wearing something under all that metal! Combine three firesilk swatches, a vial of purified mana, an emblem of fire, a firestrand curing agent, a tunic pattern and the signet. Bring it to me when you have completed it.'

Flag requirement: Rallos Zek

Finally, the last monster. Baking. This was one of the most annoying recipes for folks to figure out. So when you make it, thank the people who spent the months combining and researching and just smashing their heads against their monitors figuring it out for you. Combine three of the Bristlebane Party Platters and your signet in the Satchel he gives you.

Aid Grimel says 'When we adventure in the Planes there is only one meal that keeps us in top fighting shape. It is called a Bristlebane's Party Platter. Unfortunately the platter is awkward and not easy to adventure with so you need to place them in this satchel. I know not how to make the Platter, a rather nice female Halfling cleric always used to deliver them to us but I heard she was crushed by a Regrua while hunting for a rare component in the Plane of Water. Brell bless her soul! Combine three of the platters and the signet inside the satchel.'

The LAST Step 
Skill requirement: None! 
<HR>
Flag requirement: None (but you NEED access to Elemental Planes in order to do this step) 
<HR>
Following Grimel's advice, hailing the councilman gives a quest similar to Secrets of the Planes: Go fetch a Hope Stone! This step has been verified to NOT be MQable. The councilman will reject items that are turned in to him one at a time. Turn in the signet and the Hope Stone, and you will receive a disgustingly droolworthy earring.
