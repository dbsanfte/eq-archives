    Minimum level: 58<br>
    Maximum level: 61<br>
    Zone Name: Western Wastes<br>
    Camp Area/Loc: Entire Zone<br>
    Mob List(HP): Brontotheriums (Blue to 61, Mint to 62), Glaciar Mastodons 
    (Blue to 61, Mint to 62)<br>
    Availability (1-&gt;10): 9<br>
    Loot Ranking (1-&gt;10): 4 <br>
    Diff.Ranking (1-&gt;10): 7 <br>
    Faction Affected: No faction hits<br>
    <br>
    Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: Have Run 3. These are pretty much your last 
    hurrah at quadding in pre-pop zones. The mobs are not social, so if you are 
    resist or crit too much of a difference in HP some will turn while the 
    others still chase you. You can generally just make a loop until the 
    unturned mob or mobs join back in (they have insane regen) and then nuke 
    them all turned at once.<br>
    <br>
    Velium hounds are harder to spot, but if you see several of them up there is 
    no reason they would not be quaddable similarly.<br>
    <br>
    If you get a velium hound add and you are not sowed, it WILL be faster than 
    you. Run far enough that your quad does not beat on you (4 of these mobs 
    hitting you is unpleasant briefly), then root and snare the dog. Abandon 
    quad if necessary, but unless you are marginal on mana, it should not really 
    be necessary. If you are sowed you can outrun the dog, but they are fast 
    enough that you will have to generate a lot of distance from your quad to do 
    so. Better generally to take the hits and root/snare them, kill them, and 
    resume your quad.<br>

    NOTES:</span><ul>
      <li><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;Mastodon 
      Furs can be worthwhile for tailoring or selling, as can Velium Hound Furs.</span></li>
      <li><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Rare resists, 
      but the mobs are not social; Primarly risk is Velium Hound adds.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Verdana">*Note from Gemdiver: 
    Quadding in WW is extremely hard. Do not attempt it if you are KoS to Claws 
    of Veeshan do not attempt this zone. Watch out for the giant ice crawlers as 
    they will agro you, however they don't see invis. Honestly unless you're 
    collecting fur for tailoring I cannot imagine a reason you would want to 
    quad here other than to prove that you can.</span></font><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana"><br>
