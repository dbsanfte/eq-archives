    <p>
    *Note: The difference between orange and red is not based on difficulty. Red 
    denotes that its very hard but you'll get lots of exp if you can handle it. 
    Yellow suggests either the monsters are so hard you'll die too much for it 
    to be worth while, or it is very hard but even if you do survive you won't 
    get exp. In other words: Avoid yellow exp spots. Blue Experience spots offer 
    the fastest experience, however they are usually the most crowded. <b>

    <font color="#3366FF"><b>L. Faydark</b> - Brownies, this is how I did 58-60. 
    2 brownies spawn every 16 minutes. The exp is slow, but incredibly easy. I 
    could spend 30 seconds nuking, then go read my email or do things around the 
    house. This is certainly a place to check out because its never camped. You 
    can mark this down as one of Gem's favorites. </font><br>
    <font color="#FF0000"><b>Maidens Eye </b>- Quad toilers up on the zonewall. Toilers are DB till you hit 
    lvl62. Drops centi weapons but not the longsword I think, also drops a 
    casterwearable sleeve and condensated shadow(for fletching, easily sell for 
    10pp each or more on my server)</font><br>

    <font color="#FF9900"><b>Timorous Deep </b>- Quadding raptors , Pretty easy kills most of the time and 
    good exp. You can also do the raptors starting at 51, KEI would make it 
    almost trivial these days. I had to drag them to the table and med kit 
    sometimes but was doable. But, the agro range is alot larger at lower levels 
    so you'll need to be very careful.</font><br>

    <font color="#FF0000"><b>Dawnshroud Peaks</b> - Those mean rockhopper guys at the cave. Go in from 
    Netherbian, take a left, cave at the zone edge there will be 2 outside, and 
    more inside... blue at 55. In order to quadkite, you'll have to invis and go 
    inside to lure out 2, then grab the front 2. Apparently if the boss is 
    killed (or some other trigger), some cavemen guys will spawn instead at that 
    cave, until their boss is killed, then the rockhoppers are back.</font><br>
    Tenenborus Forest : 
    Vampires! There are several camps of these throughout the zone, don't mess 
    with the castle until your high level and buffed thats not a quad area.

    cast only when they get in melee range, impossible to quad them now. The 
    only things not quaddable in that zone are guardian wurms, the chromadrac 
    type mobs and Talendor. All mobs run the same speed, you can mix and match 
    mob types(drakes, wurms, etc) you can even pull a named in a quad. Easy 
    way to make some cash and get your 51-59 spells while getting some xp.

    <p>60+ Note: For leveling 
    60-65, a large factor for where you exp is based off of your equipment. If 
    you are well equipped the lvl 62-65 mobs could work for you 60-65. 
    Conversely if you have a low mana pool you might want to do 60-62 mobs 
    through 65. Basically, any of these exp spots will get you to 65, the harder 
    it is the faster exp you will get. Also note: For solo'in in Planes of Power 
    you should get buffs before heading to your spot, specifically KEI (lasts 
    longer than VoQ). </p>
