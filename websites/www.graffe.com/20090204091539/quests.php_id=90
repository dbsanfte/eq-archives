<HR>
Leramas Feston says 'I hope your first teachings have taught you well, ____. It is time for your next lesson. The accumulation of knowledge requires exploration and study. If you explore the cave system in the Plane of Disease, you may eventually discover a foul being by the name of Rallius Rattican. You are to bring me his head, along with your Beginner Stealth Manual. Once done, we may proceed with your next lesson.'
<HR>
He is found in the rat caves which are along the left zone wall as you zone in. When you enter the caves and go a bit inside, you will come to a big open hall with a tunnel in front and a tunnel to the left. Basically, take the tunnel in front and go ahead all the way and you will get to him. Before you do you will come to a few more open areas.<BR><BR>
Rallius is found in a big open area on top of a platform surrounded by 4 guards.
Straight up melee mob, max hit for about 500, goes down quick. The problem you will have is that additional guards spawn during the fight.

Hand Leramas Feston  the <a href="http://www.graffe.com/quests.php?id=88">Beginner Stealth Manual</a>, as well as the head of Rallicus Rattican, and he will give you the Intermediate Stealth Manual
