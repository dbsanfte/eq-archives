    <p><strong>FT - Flowing Thought</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
    FT items stack. If you have 2 items with FT1 on each, then you have FT2. 
    Likewise, FT2 + FT4 = FT6.<br>
    FT from items is capped at 15. Not 18, not 25. (base standing mana regen at 
    level 65 is 3, not 1, leading some to believe that the FT cap had increased 
    - it has not) Mana regen from worn items counts toward the FT cap, 
    regardless of whether it's explicitly called FT.<br>
    <br>
    <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>HORSES/Lizards</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
    While on a horse/lizard and not moving and with auto-attack off, you get 
    sitting mana regen without sit aggro. You also get that sitting mana regen 
    while casting (yes, even using clicky items). Until recently, you used to be 
    able to use mounts without having the new models on. This would give you the 
    benefits of a mount without having to deal with the 
    speed/acceleration/deceleration issues of riding a mount. Since a recent 
    patch, this is no longer the case - if you wish to gain the benefit of 
    mounted mana regen, you must have at least your race (and base race if 
    applicable) and Horse models on, and deal with horse/lizard speed/accel/deceleration 
    issues. The one current exception is using skeleton illusion (which is a new 
    model), which allows you to use a mount with models off as long as the 
    illusion is up. This is most likely an oversight by Sony and will probably 
    be dealt with soon, so enjoy it while you can.<br>

    <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>FOCUS ITEMS</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
    Focus items with different categories of effects DO stack. Focus items with 
    the same category of effect DON'T stack.<br>
    For example, if you have a mana preservation focus item and an improved 
    damage item (2 different categories of effects), they will BOTH activate 
    when you cast a nuke.<br>
    If you have a general mana preservation item and an item with nuke-specific 
    mana preservation (both preservation category items), they will NOT stack. 
    When you cast a nuke, whichever item has the greater savings will activate. 
    When you cast a non-nuke, the general MP item will activate.<br>

    <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>CRITS</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
    Innate crits and AA crits are 2 separate and independent entities. Innate 
    crits will always hit 2% of the time, for a random amount of damage up to 
    ~155% of regular damage. You will begin to get innate crits at level 12. 
    Rumor has it that raising a stat will increase the number of innate crits 
    you get. While this may be true, no stat has ever been found to conclusively 
    influence crits (although anecdotal evidence abounds for everything from Dex 
    to Cha to Sta). You will also get innate crits on partial resists that can 
    make you look bad (You deliver a critical blast! (5)). AA crit information 
    follows:<br>
    <br>
    <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>SCF - Spell Casting Fury</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> 
    (costs 2, 4 and 6 points - 12 total)<br>
    SCF1 gives you AA crits of 133% dmg, and you get them 2% of the time<br>
    SCF2 increases your AA crits to 166% dmg and you get them 4% of the time.<br>
    SCF3 increases your AA crits to double dmg and you get them 7% of the time.<br>
    Innate crits will make you look bad a total of 2% of the time.<br>
    <br>
    <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>SCFM - Spell Casting Fury Mastery</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> 
    (costs 3, 6, and 9 points - 18 total)<br>
    SCFM (at any level) does not increase the amount of damage your AA crits 
    will do.<br>
    SCFM1 will make you AA crit a total of 9% of the time<br>
    SCFM2 will make you AA crit a total of 11% of the time<br>
    SCFM3 will make you AA crit a total of 14% of the time<br>
    Innate crits will continue to make you look bad a total of 2% of the time.<br>
    <br>
    <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>FOMM - Fury of Magic Mastery</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> 
    (costs 2, 4 and 6 points - 12 total)<br>
    FOMM (at any level) does not increase the amount of damage your AA crits 
    will do.<br>
    FOMM1 will make you AA crit a total of 16% of the time<br>
    FOMM2 will make you AA crit a total of 18% of the time<br>
    FOMM3 will make you AA crit a total of 20% of the time<br>
    Innate crits will still continue to make you look bad a total of 2% of the 
    time.<br>
    <br>
    <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>SCM - Spell Casting Mastery</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> 
    (costs 2, 4 and 6 points - 12 total)<br>
    SCM will give you a FLAT mana reduction on EVERY spell cast. <br>
    SCM1 will save you 2% of the mana cost on each spell you cast.<br>
    SCM2 will save you 5% of the mana cost on each spell you cast.<br>
    SCM3 will save you 10% of the mana cost on each spell you cast.<br>
    <br>
    Sony's description of SCM says it gives you an increased chance of 
    specialization activating on each spell cast (i.e. you will get variable 
    mana cost depending on whether a specialization roll is successful) -
    <!--EZCODE LINK START-->
    <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm28.showMessage?topicID=23.topic">
    extensive player testing</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> says this is incorrect. 
    For the actual operation of SCM, please see the first line under the &quot;SCM&quot; 
    heading. Also,
    <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>SCM savings are in addition to any mana 
    savings derived from Specialization</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. 
    Specialization at 200 (in Evocation, for us) gives 10% mana savings (on 
    Evocation spells) and 50 specialization (in everything else) gives 2.5% mana 
    savings (on everything else). Specialization is also a flat mana reduction 
    on every spell cast.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>MB - Manaburn (not Mannaburn)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
    MB was changed just prior to PoP release. It still completely drains your 
    manapool, and delivers a significant amount of unresistable damage, however: 
    the multiplier on it seems to be lower than before (lower avg. MB dmg), the 
    maximum damage is now capped at 9462, AA crits no longer affect MB - you can 
    however, land an innate crit MB, and MB now leaves a dot-like counter on the 
    mob for 1 minute. While this counter exists, the mob may not be hit by 
    another MB. While MB was always only &quot;situationally useful&quot;, it is generally 
    accepted that the number of situations in which it is useful is now much 
    smaller.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>AA PATHS</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> 
    (HIGHLY, HIGHLY DEBATED - there is NO &quot;best&quot; path, but here are some general 
    recommendations)<br>
    (6 AAs in General are assumed, and are usually 2 of: RunSpeed3, Regen3, or 
    Metabolism3 (if you have/plan on getting a mount))<br>
    <br>
    In general, get to 65, then do AAs.<br>
    <br>
    If you do NOT want to level to 65 (for whatever reason), HoD (lvl 62) is 
    your best bet as your first AA skill.<br>
    Generally, it is accepted that SCM1-3 are your next best AAs, with the AA 
    flappies (<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2758&source=Live">Improved</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> 
    and
    <!--EZCODE LINK START-->
    <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3264&source=Live">Allegiant</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> 
    - click names for stats) running neck and neck with SCM.<br>
    At this point, play style becomes a major factor. Exodus and Nexus Gate are 
    invaluable for grouping/soloing. SCF1-3 are great &quot;fun-factor&quot; AAs to get, 
    and can greatly increase the enjoyment of playing your wizard. A well-timed 
    crit can also turn the tide of a battle in your favour, even with just SCF2. 
    It should be noted however, that over a long period of time, SCF1 and 2 
    combined increase your long-term damage by a whopping 2.7%, while SCF3 alone 
    increases your long-term damage by an additional 4.3% (for a total of 7% 
    extra damage). Translation: SCF is only a significant boost to damage output 
    at SCF3 - prior to that, it is mostly eye candy.<br>
    Spell Casting Subtlety (1-3) is a highly recommended AA skill if you often 
    face targets where aggro rather than mana is your limiting factor.<br>
    Quick Damage is recommended if you encounter situations where you need high 
    DPS and aggro and mana are not a factor. AA skills beyond the above-listed 
    are generally acquired afterwards. Please note that play-styles vary 
    greatly, and your optimal AA path may differ significantly from another's.<br>
