 </font><p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2"><b>Warning: </b>
    There is 0 room for error. If you get too close to a mob you will take in 
    the ballpark of 2000-3000 dmg assuming you aren't stunned. Do not even think 
    of coming anyway near this camp unless you've been quadding for a long time 
    and know everything backwards and forwards. Do not attempt this exp camp if 
    the Guardian of Doomfire is spawned. </font></p>
    <p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2">Set up camp on the tables 
    near where the Guardian of Doomfire spawns. You can get there by running 
    invised through the Field of Gib along the zone wall and timing your running 
    through the castle where GoD spawns. NOTE: All monsters guarding the castle 
    and inside see invis and are lvl 65+. The doomfire guards you will be kiting 
    are all red cons to 65 and very very mean. Respawn time is about 17 minutes.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2"><b>Strategy 1: Group 
    Quadding: </b>This is best for those who have less than 6k or so mana or 
    have any shred of doubt in their abilities. One quadder pulls the quad in 
    circles around the tables. He snares all four and brings them down to 90% hp 
    at which point the rest of the group begins casting pillars. It is important 
    that the puller keep agro at all times so the quad doesn't split. There are 
    2 doomfires in each of the huts along with 5 in various corners and along 
    the wall. A fast group should be able to clear all 9 and pull additional 
    quads from the inner castle. NOTE: While no casters spawn in the tables 
    area, clerics, wizards, and enchanters spawn inside the castle. You can 
    chain pillar of frost/lightning here. Lightning won't hit as often but since 
    you have more people the increased dps allows you to kill faster and mana 
    isint as large a concern. </font></p>
    <p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2"><b>Strategy 2: Solo 
    Quadding: </b>This is it. The Kefka of Quadding. If you can solo the tables 
    then you have quadded the hardest spot in the game. Congratulations you are 
    a master wizard. Pick up some buffs before heading out here. I'd suggest KEI 
    (it lasts longer) along with Po9 and SoE (who would have thought druids had 
    a use besides firewood!). While you can do this with just Run3 I highly 
    reccomend the SoW/SoE. It will make your life much easier if you don't have 
    a bard-speed horse. Pull 4 of the 5 outside guards. </font></p>
    <p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2">I'd suggest pulling with 
    snare. You have about a 50/50 chance of it resisting. If it resists run down 
    to the other end of the area, chain clicking temp flux on it as you go 
    (every bit of debuff helps). Repeat until you have 4 snared. Use Pillar of 
    Frost only unless you are over 7k mana in which case you can throw in some 
    Pillars of Lightning. Make sure to use Harvest of Druzzil early on - it will 
    repop before the fight is over. </font></p>
    <p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2">Once those 4 are dead 
    med/harvest up as fast as you can. Once FM repeat the process on the four 
    guards inside huts. The targetting is a little tricky, I'd suggest getting a 
    target on 1 with an eye of tallon/zomm, then casting snare to pull him. 
    After that you can pull him through the huts and time your snares to agro 
    the others. You should finish with about 10 minutes before the first 4 
    respawn. You can either kill the 1 remaining guard in the area or just wait 
    for respawns. You will get about 14% of an AA per kill (56% per quad). Enjoy 
    the experience, you worked for it.</font></p>
