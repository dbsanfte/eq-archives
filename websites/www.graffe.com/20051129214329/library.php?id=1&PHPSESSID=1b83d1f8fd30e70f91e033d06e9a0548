Hopefully, after reading this many of you that have a negative outlook on our class, will realize the potential we have within ourselves.

       <P>We all enjoy the idea of signing onto RPG's to live out our fantasies of being a Sorcerer Supreme or a Paladin of the Church or a Mystical Shaman from a barbaric tribe. We sign on to a game built around a company's expectation or in the least around the visions of the people who created the game with our own expectations of how things should be. This is true no matter what class or race or game we play.</p>
 	<P>When something is said by the designers it is said with the knowledge of how things were put together, how the numbers are truly crunched, and the intricacies or nuances that might affect what they are actually saying. As the player or consumer we take what is said at face value, with no real knowledge presented before us. Our views are based on, once again, our predetermined vision that we have in our heads. Sometimes the designers will find flaws or variances between what their vision is and what the players' vision is and make adjustments to reach a common ground. The bottom line is that not everyone will be happy with how the "vision" ends up. And even more so a great deal of the players may never realize the full potential of the character they have chosen because not all the strengths and weaknesses are obvious to everyone and yet to others it is quite clear.</p>
 	<P>Let me discuss my favorite class and the banner that draws 90% of the people who play it to throw caution to the wind and roll up this character: The Wizard! Master of Magical Damage. The question is whether or not this title is in fact true or an outdated moniker that Verant placed upon the class while writing up flowery descriptions to place in the manual, on the net, and on the box.</p>
 	<P>The arguments will be long and hard but it is quite evident that a Wizard, in the right hands, is not only the Master of Magical Damage but of damage period. Cinius, where is your head? you're saying! This guys on crack! Quite simply put: not every class will excel to the best of their abilities in every situation. That's why Warriors, the best melee damage and damage-absorbing class are unequaled in their profession, until it comes to soloing. That's why it's possible for a Wizard to fall behind in the damage curve in an extended single MoB fight (although I have out damaged all the melee classes in situations like these contrary to what some people have experienced).</p>
 	<P>Let me give a number for everyone to crunch or mull over, 4270, give up yet? That's the damage Super Nova would do to 5 MoB's. Oh, but Cin that's the level 49 Suicide spell. Speaking of which let's go to the readers and get some comments (names will be withheld for obvious reasons).</p>
 
 <P>Great for taking out a lot of lower level mobs beating on you, but cast this in a place like Lguk and you're pretty much dead...</p>
 
 <P>AWESOME SUICIDE SPELL</p>
 
 <P>So go get it, cast it and die like the rest of the AE castors</p>
 
 <P>I have yet to see practical use for this spell or any other PB spell... last thing a wiz wants to go is piss off a lot of mobs already attacking him. Cast it on greens for fun</p>
 
 <P>The chance that you will have use for an AE spell is so low (except in dungeons or similar places) that it is often not worth buying, much less keeping memorized</p>
 
 <P>Killing Greens makes this spell useful? AE spells are nearly useless.</p>
 
 <P>This is a great way to get lots of attention from mobs. Like most AOE spells, far more dangerous to you than any monsters.</p>
 
 	<P>Yes Super Nova is level 49 but there are comparable lower level spells too. Level 34 you get ThunderClap which in the same situation does 1160 points of damage. Cast force can do 505 points in the same situation.</p>
 	<P>So explain to me what the trend is here. Is it Fear? Is it a lack of experience? Have you been hesitant to use the AE line because of what you've read instead of trying it out for yourself? What's the excuse? Easy enough to say that Wizards are the Masters of Magical damage unequaled even by the deadly DOT's. Here is another case where the players' perceptions of Verant's description are not matching.</p> 
 	<P>Area of Effect spells are the most deadly and damaging spells in the game and therefor some of the hardest to learn to use effectively. Players end up either hating them or loving them.  One thing we have to do is learn to play our class. If you're so worried about deaths that you're unwilling to expand your use of the class do not blame Verant for a label that is more than deserved. A lot of people do not play Bards or do not play good Bards because of the inability to twist songs with any skill or in the case of bad Bards they just don't twist. Enchanters are no different. An Enchanter has to know what spells to use for different situations and they have a lot of spells to choose from and only have the same 8 slots that we do so they better choose carefully. Everyone knows a bad Enchanter or a bad Cleric can get the whole party killed. It takes finesse to play almost any class. If you're having problems or your not satisfied with a class try another one.</p>
 	<P>If a person has a problem with charming and mezzing and stunning then they probably won't enjoy playing their Enchanter. If a person has problems adapting and effectively using AE's then they're always gonna be a victim of the grass is greener and not enjoy playing their Wizard. By all means compare our damage to other classes but don't pick just 1 spell or 1 spell line. We get the most mana efficient spell in the game at level 34 but just because some people don't use it it's not used for comparing damage against other classes.</p>
 	<P>It's time the world of Norrath had a wake up call. Get out of the rut that the majority of players have built for our class and change the game. But above all stop whining and start asking questions. Any other class that comes to a Wizard board and sees someone posting they "get resisted by blues so bad they have to get their exp from high greens" (a gross exaggeration) then of course in game that other class is not gonna want a Wizard grouping with them. Some people are digging their own graves get ready to lie in it. I for one will be at the pinnacle of my game quite frankly kicking ass.</p>
 	<P>This is where I'll close. Originally I had planned on making an AE editorial on how to effectively use them however this turned another direction in light of some recent postings. So I'll get to work on an AE Tutorial with some tips on the where, when, and how. I'll be talking with some of the other celebrities on the boards in order to give you as complete of a Tutorial as I can. I can lead you to the Power, but I can't force you to drink.</p>
 <P>These are my opinions. If you have any questions comments or complaints please address them to me since Graffe's mailbox is full enough keeping up with the news on the site.</p>
