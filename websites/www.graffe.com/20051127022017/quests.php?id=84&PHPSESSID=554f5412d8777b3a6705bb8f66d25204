<HR>
Nilham the Chef says 'That was a nasty cat. I dun think it was after us, though. I think it just smelled the fresh chunk of wooly rhino jerky I had. It didn't do anythin' but knock us over. I guess that's what it likes, walrus. After it knocked us over it slipped away towards the bridge island like a ghostly mist. I'm thinkin I saw a glimmer in its maw while it was runnin off.'
<HR>
Get two Coldwater Barracuda Livers from coldwater barracudas in the bay in Cobalt Scars. 
<HR>
Turn the livers into a named otter, Qarrgy Scallopgobble in Cobalt Scar, who is in the shell house closest to the tower. 
<HR>
Qarrgy Scallopgobbler slams a knife into the various livers and squeezes out all of their various goos and juices. Eventually he seperates a bit of it and pours it into a protective bladder. "Excellent work. This good catch. Here, you have sack of ooze. Its good for burning things off or etching metals. Thank you for your help.'
<HR>
You now have a bladder of acidic ooze. 
<HR>
Go to Wakening Lands, and forage sap. This will have to be done by a forager and multi-quested with you because the sap is a no drop item.
<HR>
Go to Thurgadin and give the sap and ooze to Pythic Urson. He is in the bar in the back area next to the mines. Get bottle of Dissolving Liquid in return. 
<HR>
Go to Great Divide. Give the bottle of dissolving liquid to the Gnomish Deserter, who is at the very top of the mountain in the middle (the one that has the wurm tunnels). Get the Locked Rum Box. 
<HR>
Go to Eastern Wastes. Kill wooly rhinos until you get four "fresh" chunks of rhino meat, the regular wooly rhino meat will not do.
<HR>
While in Eastern Wastes, go ahead and kill Dire Wolves, too. You need 1 High Quality Dire Wolf Pelt.
<HR>
Go to Wakening Lands. On the south shore of the lake in the center is a level 60 mist panther. Give the 4 chunks of fresh rhino meat to the panther and you'll get a broken golden key in return. 
<HR>
Go to the gnoll village by the Tower of Frozen Shadow in Iceclad Ocean. Give the snowfang gnoll named 'Errgriz' in one of the tents the High Quality Dire Wolf Pelt. You'll get earmuffs/head covering in return. 
<HR>
Go to Sojan the Sleepless in the Southernmost igloo in the gnome pirate village in Iceclad. Give him the earmuffs, and get fine metal chain in return. Give Sojan the fine metal chain and the broken golden key to get the rum box key. 
<HR>
Go to the Captain in the igloo to the North. Give him the rum box and key to get a bottle of Captain Nalot's Triple Strength Rum.
<HR>
Go to the docks on the same island. Give the rum to Nelet Durzit who is on the docks there to receive the Rough Silver Chain in return.
