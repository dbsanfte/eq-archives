An excellent quadding spot for wizzies and just a stone's throw away from where many of us started quadding on the spectres.  The only prerequisites here is some sort of speed buff (SOW potions, RUN3, jboots all work fine), in case you agro Quag Maelstrom.  Quag's not a hard kill, but he casts manasieve and will drain you dry unless you have a high magic resist.  Since he doesn't drop anything of use to us, it's best to leave him alone.  Also, the respawn rate for the cyclops is so high, you'll rarely run out of targets even with multiple quadders on the isle.

Ok, if you start on the docks at the Erollisi Island, face away from the huts (toward where the Oracle of K'Arnon spawns) and turn right.  On the second island (where the druid ring is) you'll find swarms of Seafury Cyclops.  They range from about L39-L43, hit rather hard, and have around 4500 hps.  They have no resistances to speak of, so once you hit 51 and get pillar of frost, you're all set.  I used Atol's Spectral Shackles to pull/snare.

Setup your camp near the water.  The clops never come down that far, so you can med/afk in peace between pulls.  I'd bind on the tip of land that juts out toward the spectre isle, near the druid ring, so you can abscond back to the erollisi isle to sell your loot and gate back.  It's also very helpful to keep Levitation up, in case you need to make a getaway over the water when you agro Quag (and you will once in a while, so don't panic when you do).

Run up the hill and start pulling the clops with Atols.  When you have 4, run them down to the waterline and round them up.  Resnare.  Then just jog along the beach casting your most powerful pillar.  The clops have a very small agro radius, so it's easy to avoid adds once you get the know the spot.

The best part?  The place is quiet and outdoors, so you can use jboots or sow potions to get your AA's for Run3 in just a few hours (or less) and then rack up XP and cash at a very healthy pace.  Since the spawn rate is high, you're only limited by your regen rate in terms of how fast you can level -- get KEI, Po9, SD in PoK whenever you can.  The loot is all gems, cash, and assorted components.  This is nice because you don't get weighted down.  You should gather at least 200-300pp per hour in gems, if not more -- these are the 80pp+ gems, mithril amulets, etc.  Destroy the cyclops parts -- they don't stack and their selling value isn't worth the weight you'll carry around.
