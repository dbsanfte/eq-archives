The prod drops from the Chancellor of Di'Zok (approx level 40) in the Sarnak compound in the Lake of Ill Omen, and is dropable. 
<HR>
The fang drops from Xalgoz (approx level 40), the boss of Kaesora, located deep in its ruins.

Dugroz is out in the swamp by the frog city. His loc is neg 250, neg 1800.<BR>
Handing Dugroz the prod and the fang results in "Key to Charasis", which is the key to the Howling Stones.</td></tr></table></body></html>
