I rather enjoy it. It is silly, gimmicky, a rip-off of &quot;tiny tower&quot; and a genuine WASTE of time, but it has its perks.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to unlock as much of the additional scenes as possible by delivering the major characters to the floor they're supposed to go to. So far I've only figured out the following: <br />
<br />
<br />
Toydarian to Toydarian toys<br />
A New Hope Leia and Luke to the Extending Bridge<br />
A New Hope Leia to the Interrogation room <br />
Jar Jar Binks to Mos Espa Cafe<br />
<br />
<br />
Has anyoen figured out where to deliver Lando Calrisian? or C3PO?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>GW2 is the best MMO right now.  The event system is the best quest system out there.  The combat is fantastic.  I can crank all the graphics in all the games and in that light, GW2's are the best.  It's not the best for immersion because of how easy it is to bounce from zone to zone and how kinda disjointed all the dungeons are.  I'd give immersion to TSW probably.  WoW is really just a shadow of an MMO now.  I'd rather play 5 other games than that one.  <br />
<br />
The big problem with GW2 is that the end game is repetitious as all hell.  It would take a month or two of solid farming to make your ascended armor.  By then you would have done all the content about 25 times each.  I love the new fractals and you cannot beat a game that changes every two weeks.  <br />
<br />
I fucking double dog dare you miscreants to argue with me!  I weel crushee you!</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Really fucking disgusted and fed up....<br />
<br />
On facebook, friend who's become rather bitter twat, commented on ex-girlfriend of mine, calling her a &quot;horror&quot;, as he had done previously....<br />
<br />
To explain, the lass in question I've known since we were oh 4? I think maybe even younger, she was a neighbour so I'd known her well a long time.<br />
She was never pretty, but I always liked her, call me weird but to me &quot;liking&quot; is more important, especially in a romantic relationship 'cause lets be honest, yer genitals/biology and loneliness are very large part of most relationships and that's why they end in tears 'cause they ain't really solid.<br />
Caring and liking the other person is, IMHO, much more important than usual &quot;attraction&quot;.<br />
Takes time to get to know and like a person and &quot;true love for life at first meeting&quot; is incredibly rare, though it does happen, not something I expect though as it's usually biological/tastes not &quot;true love&quot;, in reality, as said.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Brienne of Tarth&quot; thread was kind of resonant to me, as this gal was 6' 3&quot;, very athletic build and she'd once KO's the biggest guy in school with one right hook :p<br />
But no wonder she decked him, the shit that poor lass got all her life was outrageous, just cause she wasn't pretty and had large scar on her face from bad accident as a kid (she was on her skateboard and went face first into a lamp post, ugh)<br />
<br />
I was one of few people who ever treated her kindly. WTF is the matter with people?!<br />
She is a Human BEING you fucking CUNT BASTARDS out there who ridiculed her, and a very nice person at that.<br />
So what if she's big, doesn't make me feel less of a man. has no bearing. Duh!<br />
<br />
Anyway we went out together few years after I got this illness as we met up again (she had moved away a short distance)<br />
 yeah I love voluptuous gals, big boobs, redheads etc :p but that's just my <i>tastes</i>, it's not about WHO I LOVE.<br />
<br />
it was obvious no man had ever gently loved her rather than just fuck her when drunk or to do it as a &quot;trophy/meaness&quot; (as in, boasting they'd &quot;shagged an ugly gal&quot;), no one had shown her how to make <i>love</i><br />
<br />
anyway this once best mate of mine back then, and recently again derided her.<br />
I don't know if that's why she ended things back then, cause the crap she got from folk was vile and she had serious problems because of it, or 'cause, to be blunt, I couldn't get erections but that's because of the testosterone issues those shithead docs had ignored.<br />
Did she take that as a sign of her not being desirable? <br />
I really cared about her, and loved pleasuring her, even if I couldn't  &quot;perform&quot;<br />
<br />
I was very happy to walk with her in my arm, to care about her. I would have been very happy to spend rest of my life with her.<br />
Why are people such shitheads?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Looks like there was never a thread made for this movie. Anyways, JFC this movie is depressing; probably the best drama that I've ever seen, and sensational acting all around (aside from Jay Baruschel aka Danger and Hillary Swank's ludicrous accent). It managed to leave me more depressed than the ending of The Moon is a Harsh Mistress (the book). I had to watch a comedy after viewing Million Dollar Baby. Clint Eastwood's acting was the best out of any of his movies to date, and considering the length of his career that is notable. I think what made this so devastating was how relatable the ending was; sure, there are worse tragedies, but most are so estranged that it is difficult to empathize with to the same degree as what occurs in this film. Definitely watch this if you have for some reason not done so already, but go into it with high spirits before hand.<br />
<br />
I do have one quibble with the film though<br />
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px"><b>Spoiler</b> for <i>FILM</i>: <input type="button" value="Show" style="width:45px;font-size:10px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onClick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != 'inline') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'inline'; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none';  this.value = 'Show'; }">
</div>
<div class="alt2" style="margin: 0px; padding: 6px; border: 1px inset;">
<div style="display: none;">
<br />
There's no way in hell that that woman is not DQ'd way earlier in the fight; even in fucking Pride (RIP) or UFC she would have been DQ'd way earlier, and the refs and everyone else knows she does that shit from her previous fights, so they know what to look for.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>The right wing is now an expert at mocking the left wing for always &quot;playing the ____ card,&quot; but in reality the false victimization narrative is generally a toll of the right wing.  From the false &quot;War on Christmas&quot; narrative to today's example, the &quot;Six Year Old Boy Suspended for 'Sexual Harassment' for Kissing His Girlfriend&quot; narrative: <br />
<a href="http://www.krdo.com/news/six-year-old-suspended-for-sexual-harassment/-/417220/23403144/-/ndefbbz/-/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.krdo.com/news/six-year-ol...z/-/index.html</a><br />
<a href="http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/news/canoncity-local-news/ci_24702103/mother-girl-involved-kissing-discipline-speaks-out" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/...ine-speaks-out</a><br />
 <br />
Now, in this case, a couple of little boys in the First Grade were harassing a little girl in their class, claiming her as their &quot;girl friend,&quot; not allowing her to play with other children, and engaging in unwanted touching behavior including kissing.  The teacher gave the boys a warning, and one of them stopped bothering the girl, but the other boy kept on insisting that the girl was his girl friend, and continued to corner her, sneak up on her, and touch or kiss her.  He was given an in-school suspension for kissing the girl on the cheek by surprise, but then after all that he leaned over and kissed her hand during a class exercise and was suspended for sexual harassment for two days.<br />
 <br />
That should have been the end of it, his parents should have instructed him in no uncertain terms to keep his lips to himself at school, but instead his mother did what all craven right-wing weaklings do, she ran shrieking to the &quot;conservative&quot; press, which dutifully repeated everything she had to say without fact checking, headlining their original story &quot;Boy, Six, Suspended for 'Sexual Harassment.'&quot; The headline has been changed on the first article to reflect the fact that the school's record of the incident does not contain the term &quot;sexual harassment&quot; at all.  What the boy was suspended for was for repeated violation of the school's &quot;No Unwanted Touching Rule.&quot;  The mother of the boy claimed in the original article that the girl was actually the boy's girlfriend and the kissing was mutual, but then the girl's mother spoke up in the second article I linked to say that the attention was one-sided and the boy was actually sneaking up on the girl repeatedly, and the school's Principal was quoted saying that there had been a series of warnings and much lighter punishments before the harsher penalty of suspension was levied.  <br />
 <br />
So here we have a false victimization narrative, shopped to the right-wing-controlled media, and dutifully rubber-stamped because it fits a narrative that the right wing fucking LOVES to bandy about, the &quot;PC gone mad&quot; bullshit.</div>

Husband and wife Michael and Nova Smith claim say they had no choice but to call 911 after managers were not helping them when their No. 2 and No. 4 orders from McDonald's were served without potatoes on the side.<br />
<br />
“It’s a meal,” said Nova. “Just like you should get fries with your hamburger, we should have got our hash browns with our breakfast sandwiches.”<br />
<br />
Nova says managers refused to give back her money after she confronted them, prompting her to toss food in their direction.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that was out of frustration which I probably shouldn't have done, but I did. Fighting over $2 of hash browns is ridiculous. It is ridiculous to have to fight that hard just to get customer service,&quot; said Nova.<br />
<br />
Michael then dialed 911 and went behind the counter to argue with the manager.<br />
<br />
“I just was barely able to hold myself back,” said Michael. “And if not for the 911 call operator calling me back, I probably would have went berserk on him.”

</div>I can just imagine how the headline would have read if Smith had &quot;gone berserk&quot; on the McDonalds manager:  &quot;McDonalds Manager Beats Aggressive Fatty into a Pulp.&quot;</div>
