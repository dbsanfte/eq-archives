  Seek out Euzan Jurek in Sanctus Seru and tell him that Torsten sent you. He 
  will give you a false report and instruct you to head to the Consillium and 
  replace a real file inside a file cabinet with the fake one. You'll need a 
  rogue to help you out with this. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Microsoft Sans Serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
  rogue must sneak to the cabinet and give it to him (he is located in the 
  Consillium of the Heart). He will get back an old set of records. Note once 
  you give the false report a guard spawns, at which point you can exodus the 
  rogue if you're with him, die, fight or whatever you wish.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Microsoft Sans Serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;Take 
  the report back to Euzan and give it to him along with your first earring and 
  you will be awarded with the Etched Earring of Veracity along with the 
  beginning of the third quest.</font><font color="white" size="2" face="Microsoft Sans Serif"><br>
