</head><body><table width=90% align=center><tr><td class=textbody><center><h1>Root Comparison</h1><br>by Merloc Kole</center><br>Spells: Root, Instill, Elnerick's Entombment of Ice, Immobilize, Paralyzing Earth, Fetter, Greater Fetter
<br><br>
Range: 200 (all spells have the same range)
<br><br>
Fizzle Adjustment: Root and Instill have 25 fizzle adjustment (bad) all others have 0 fizzle adjustment, this is compared to Alteration for all spells except EEoI which checks Evocation to determine chances of fizzling a spell.  I'm not sure if they will actually fizzle more, because level also plays a factor in fizzle rate.
<br><br>
Skill Check: Alteration for all except EEoI which checks Evocation.
<br><br>
Regaining Concentration: Based on your level vs. spell level. Every time you are hit, there's a chance you will lose your concentration.  So the faster you cast, the fewer times you will get hit... but more importantly, the lower the level of the spell, the less likely you will lose concentration.
<br><br>
Cast Time: Root is 2.0, Instill and PE are 2.5, EEoI is 5.0, all others are 1.75.  This is not really important unless you are kiting and the mob chasing you runs very fast and will hit you.
<br><br>
Duration: Root 48 seconds, Instill 96 seconds, EEoI 24 seconds, Immobilize 60 seconds, Paralyzing Earth, Fetter and Greater Fetter last 3 minutes.  Duration is mainly important when you use root to park / control mobs, although the EEoI duration is short enough to cause problems in other situations.
<br><br>
Resist: All spells check Magic for resist, except EEoI which checks Cold.
<br><br>
Resist Adjustment: EEoI gets a -10 bonus against Cold resist, and Greater Fetter gets a -30 against magic, all others have 
a 0 resist bonus.
<br><br>
Duration Formula: Immobilize and PE use duration formula 8, EEoI uses duration formula 6, and all others use duration formula 2.  The duration formulae are not known, but from my experience, the formulae have several different factors: baic break check (determines how often and what chance a root will break on any given tick), nuke break check (determines chance a root will break when the target is nuked), resist check (which resist the break checks are done against).  The basic break check formula is affected by level of the caster vs. level of the spell.  In my experience formula 2 has a higher chance of failing the basic break check than the other two, and formula 6 checks cold instead of magic, but other than that, they are all the same. The main factor is caster level vs spell level vs mob level.
<br><br>
Damage: The only spell that does damage is EEoI, and it's not really effecient enough to make up for slow casting time and mana cost.
<br><br>
Mana cost: Root 30, Instill 60, EEoI 225, Immobilize 80, PE 100, Fetter 75, Greater Fetter 140.
<br><br>
Conclusion: Root is the best spell to use in almost any situation.  Instill and Immobilize should never be used unless you are at a low level and don't have access to higher spells.  EEoI should only be used against mobs who are weak to Cold and Resist Magic, and you want to hold them so you can cast snare on them a few times, the slow cast time and short duration do not make it useful for root/nuke or mob control. PE should only be used (for the same reasons as Fetter) if you don't have access to Fetter or Greater Fetter.  Fetter should only be used over root if you need the extra 0.25 seconds of casting time, or you are doing mob control.  Greater Fetter should be used over root and Fetter only against mobs with high magic resistance.

Remember, you get bonuses to regain concentration, resist checks, and fizzle checks for lower level spells.
