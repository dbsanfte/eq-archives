<br>
There’s really only one choice for religion if you’re a wizard:  Solusek Ro, the Burning Prince. He is the patron god of Wizards in the same way that Rallos Zek is the patron god of Warriors, Innoruuk is the patron god of Dark Elves, and Quellious is the patron goddess of playing with Barbies. Five of the six Wizard races can worship the Great Lord (the only exception being the Frogloks, who, as a new race, have no roleplaying depth at all), and the only other class that can follow Him is the Bard. Wizards have the ability to Imbue only one type of holy stone:  the Fire Opal, sacred gem of Solusek Ro. The Temple of Solusek Ro is the home to some of our greatest quests, including our epic weapon and the Staff of Temperate Flux, and is guarded by an all-Wizard Seeker squadron of Seekers and Keepers. The other deities show no such magnanimity towards Wizards:  most of them only help out their chosen few - and in most cases, these few are the Clerics, Druids, Necromancers, Paladins, and Shadow Knights who specifically worship them. Why worship a diety who cares nothing for your class? <br>
<br>
Solusek Ro is generally regarded as the God of Fire, Power, and Arcane Knowledge. His actions over the centuries have generally reinforced this view:  he certainly enjoys fire and magma, especially when used in an offensive manner (as does any good Wizard); and he has constructed a Temple where his servants, devoted to the pursuit of Power, share valuable knowledge with those who prove their worth. <br>
<br>
The other deities generally have messages that are shockingly removed from the job description of a Wizard. Wizards are supposed to be the diehard seekers of power and knowledge at all costs, caring nothing for objects and actions that do not help them attain their goal. Instead, these other dieties clog this spartan and straightforward purpose with excess baggage, such as “Save the bunnies!” “Violence isn’t the answer!” and “Puss is sexy!” Not only are most of these messages totally unrelated to the goal of acquiring magical power, they’re downright unwizardly. Wizards want to blow stuff up and get a bigger spellbook, not protect the rainforests. <br>
<br>
Thankfully, that’s exactly Solusek Ro’s philosophy:  blow up anyone who disagrees with you while you actively search for power. His actions over the course of Norrath’s history reflects this mentality. It was the Great Lord Solusek Ro who destroyed the ancient Elven empire on Tunaria (now called Antonica). Tunare’s children had built a sprawling realm in the forests and plains of the southeast of the continent, with outposts that encompassed almost every part of the landmass. Great marble cities did the High Elves build, and the Wood Elven tree-cities dotted the gargantuan Eldar Forest in which they lived. But these Elves, servants of the impotent demigoddess Tunare as they were, drew the wrath of the Great Lord. He drove the peaks of the Serpent’s Spine mountains upwards into the vault of heaven, and brought the Sun’s power down on the Elven lands. The entire empire, with all its Druids and arcane casters (including, presumably, many Wizards), as well as their goddess Tunare, fought against Solusek Ro’s punishment. But to no avail. Their land, once green and vibrant and filled with life, is now the Desert of Ro:  three territories of endless rock and sand, inhabited only by venomous spiders and snakes, the undead, and groups of orcs and sand giants. All of Tunare’s creations were forced to flee from what had been their home for centuries, to eke out a new life for themselves on the continent of Faydwer. Such is the punishment of those who draw the ire of the Burning Prince. <br>
<br>
Solusek Ro has also been implicated in the destruction of the ancient Gnomish city of Klik’Anon, and travelers from His Tower report that he is currently devising a means to turn all of Norrath into a flaming wasteland, with endless pools of lava and a sky choked with ash, with brimstone falling from the heavens rather than rain. The thought of such a world might make you ecstatic and choked up with glee. That’s entirely natural - you’re a Wizard, after all. <br>
<br>
As you can most likely see, Solusek Ro’s philosophies match perfectly those of the Wizard class, but if you’re still not convinced there are other perks. Solusek Ro’s repertoire of deity-specific items consists of only two items, but both of these are definitely among the best available for a Wizard at the point in time you can get them (unlike some other gods:  you’ll be lucky if you even catch a glance of their equipment!). The Imbued Platinum Fire Rings are undoubtedly the best input-reward rings in the game for a young wizard (arguably, for a Wizard all the way up into his 50’s):  combined, they give you +16 INT, +90 Mana, +20 HP, and +8 Fire Resistance. They do have the side effect of nuking your Strength by 16 points, but this really isn’t a big deal as long as you travel light and teleport to banks whenever you get full. And best of all, they require only three ingredients:  an enchanted platinum bar (have an Enchanter enchant a normal platinum bar), an imbued fire opal (have a Wizard with Imbue Fire Opal imbue a normal fire opal), and a willing jeweler. There really isn’t any competition to this as far as the other deities are concerned, especially considering you’ll never get your fingers on a single scrap of their armor unless you have platinum pouring out of all your orifices. <br>
<br>
Solusek Ro also wins, hands down, in the faction department. Some Agnostics will try to win you over to the path of godlessness with the “We have better faction!” argument. <br>
THEY’RE LYING. <br>
Agnostic faction is absolutely identical to Solusek Ro faction, with only two exceptions:  Solusites are amiably in the Temple of Solusek Ro, and KOS in the Plane of Growth. The Plane of Growth is Tunare’s plane:  a completely useless crapheap filled with nature-loving hippies. If you’re a Dark Elf, you’ll be KOS in the Plane of Growth no matter what you do, so there’s no reason not to worship Solusek Ro! <br>
The other major argument that the misinformed make against Solusek Ro is that worshiping some other god will get you liked more in your home city.
THEY’RE ALSO LYING. <br>
The Wizard guilds in your home city will like you no matter what god you pick - about the only people who care are the Clerics, and who needs them! For Dark Elves, worshiping Solusek Ro over Innoruuk will get you accepted into parts of many cities that would otherwise beat the grape juice out of you. For Erudites and Gnomes, worshiping Solusek Ro over other, more goody-two-shoes gods will get you accepted with open arms into Neriak and the evil outpost on Kunark, invaluable tools for the intrepid adventurer - and all while keeping your ties to good and neutral cities intact! <br>
<br>
So, a message to all you individuals thinking about making a Wizard - only one god is the God of Wizardry. That god is Solusek Ro, the Burning Prince, Lord of Fire, Keeper of Knowledge, Seeker of Power, and all-around badass.</tr></td></table></body></html>
