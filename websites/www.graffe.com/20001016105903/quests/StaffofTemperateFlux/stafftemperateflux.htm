  <p>This quest is initiated by speaking to Gardern in the Temple of Solusek Ro. 

    He issues this quest along with the Weeping Wand. For the Staff of Temperate 

    Flux, he asks you for a Heart of Fire from an Inferno Goblin Wizard from Solusek's 

    caves, a Heart of Frost from a Goblin Wizard in Permafrost, a Rod of Bone 

    from Stone Skeletons in Lake Rathe, and finally a Staff of Ro. <br>

  <p><b>Heart of Fire</b> - In Solusek A, I was near the Solusek's Champion when 

    a wizard spawned that had this. The hearts are semi rare. Wizards and Shamans 

    share spawning points so by killing shamans you increase your chances of finding 

    a wizard with one of these. It also helps to do an OOC that you're looking 

    for a heart of fire.</p>

  <p><b>Heart of Frost</b> - In Permafrost, I did an OOC that I was looking for 

    a heart of frost, someone found one on a wizard that spawned in the Preacher's 

    room. I wasn't there long, got very lucky. I was told a few things about this 

    from a very trusted guildmate, she found the heart of frost on more than just 

    wizards (being a 50 Bard, she would go in and kill all the npc's that weren't 

    camped for fun). Apparently, wizards have them much more frequent but hearts 

    can be found on anything. I know first hand that, the best place to find wizards 

    is while camping for the preacher. I was unlucky that the preacher was camped, 

    but lucky that a person there was kind enough to let me loot the heart. I 

    also know, first hand, that my heart was found on a frost goblin wizard.</p>

  <p><b>The Rod of Bone</b> - is found on Stone Skeletons that sit inside an eerily 

    lit tower on the shore of Lake Rathe. I got to this tower by entering Lake 

    Rathe from South Karana and I swam keeping the zone wall on my left side. 

    I should note that this Tower is located on a high shore that you'll find 

    shortly after passing the zone entrance to Rathe Mtns. A solo aviak guard 

    spawns on a perch on this highland. Many 20-24 people camp that as it easy 

    exp. (I know first hand) so be careful. The stone skeletons, to the best of 

    my knowledge, are magicians who conjure earth pets. Two of them with pets 

    con'ed green to me at 35. They were green but high enough to aggro me when 

    I cast on one of them. I had a wizard with me and we needed to kill 3 sets 

    to get 2 rods... not too shabby.</p>

  <p><b>The Staff of Ro</b> - is obtained in Solusek's Temple. Romar Sunto tells 

    you he will give you a Darkwood Staff, also known as a Staff of Ro, if you 

    bring him a Lambent Stone. Lambent Stones are found on Sand Giants, Hill Giants, 

    and Griffins.</p>

  <p><b>A Few Notes</b> - I wouldn't trade this staff for anything, if I could. 

    <br>

    1) It lowers a mob's fire/cold resistances by 6 each. Very nice while soloing 

    or being in a group without someone who can lower fire or cold defenses. 6 

    points is enough to notice a difference. With this stick I've had fewer full 

    resists and fewer partial resists (of all mobs within my ability to hit, of 

    course). <br>

    2) It also makes a great pulling device because it aggro's without damage. 

    <br>

    3) The effect cannot be multiplied and doesn't stack with other fire/cold 

    debuffs. As a debuff, it helps all in your group, not just you. <br>

    4) It can be resisted, but is rather pointless since you can just click away 

    until it takes effect. <br>

    5) When kiting, it is a great distance-judging device, since you can click 

    it on the run. </p>
