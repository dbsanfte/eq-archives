			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Making a new thread on it because it isn't supposed to come out for another year, so probably doesn't belong in the 2013 thread. I'm pretty excited about it though! It looks like it took all the parts I liked best about Bastion and making them better, while also throwing in cool new things. It's got a bit of a strategy mechanic mixed in with the action rpg gameplay. You can pause and queue actions, which use up a limited resource when then refills during normal combat.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Starting the thread early, as preloading apparently went live today! This is good news for anyone like me who has a slow broadband connection. At 15 gigs it's going to take me a couple days.<br />
<br />
Why so big? I think it might be because of all the PC exclusive visual options and texture packs. I was told the texture pack would be a separate download, but I think it might be included in the PC version by default. <a href="http://irrationalgames.com/insider/pc-specifications-for-bioshock-infinite-announced/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">They are promising to have made a much better PC port this time.</a><br />
<br />
If you pre-ordered the game during the last few months, you were supposed to get access to some kind of browser puzzle game that would teach you about the factions in the main game, but I apparently didn't get a code for it. And if you pre-order from Amazon, they send you a kindle ebook hyping up the game, which I think is supposed to be a series of fictional diaries and logs detailing the background plot of the game.<br />
<br />
Several sites are also giving free codes for X-Com: Enemy Unknown if you pre-order, which is crazy to me.<br />
<br />
They also have a Season Pass, apparently there will be three DLC content packs, although I am not sure if the specifics have been detailed yet.</div>

They had an all day launch day party streaming from a few locations in the world, featuring multiplayer matches and such. I didn't end up watching any of it, because I apparently didn't have the game as pre-loaded as I thought I did. I wasn't sure if I would be able to play tonight at all. Game is now listed as &quot;optimal&quot; for me in the downloader, but there is still a gig to go. Will it let me play the campaign? Judging by my past luck with midnight launches, I will say no. :p</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I have to first apologize for being disingenuous. I don't believe they can't be art as much as I believe there are things that keep most of them from being art. I also need to apologize because this topic bores me to tears and I made a thread on it anyway. :p<br />
<br />
The principal problem is the fact that they are first and foremost a product. Games are made to be enjoyed, because most people do not want to spend money on something that makes them feel anything but good. It's the same human failing that ensures the hero will always be incredibly beautiful, and why there is often pushback when the main character is someone the audience dislikes.<br />
<br />
So for example, in the anime Neon Genesis Evangelion, the main character is a whiny little good-for-nothing shit. He also represents the viewer. Audiences like a main character they can relate to while also feeling good about themselves through association. While they can relate to someone with negative qualities, it's usually a very hard sell to convince them to do so, because most people consume entertainment to feel good. But art does more than make you feel good, it makes you feel bad too, it makes you feel any range of emotions the artist wants you to feel. <br />
<br />
So getting back to my main point, most video games are made to be products. They are often changed radically during prototyping in order to better appeal to their chosen audience. A game that fails to do this is often ridiculed a great deal at best. Can Mass Effect 3 really be art if customers can demand the ending be changed because they didn't like it? <br />
<br />
Another example occurred to me while playing Tomb Raider. Sometime last year there was a lot of controversy over a scene in which Lara is groped by a murderer, the representative being interviewed implied that the scene showed how desperate Lara's growth as a character had to be. That at the threat of rape she was forced to kill for the first time.<br />
<br />
People went ballistic. They were outraged at the very idea of such a thing being in a video game. Some were offended at the portrayal of women. Others thought such a thing should never be addressed in a video game in the first place. I always thought this was strange, as although I despise the subject matter myself, I don't see how anyone can take the medium seriously if you need to use baby gloves while handling serious issues. Can something be art if it is unable to address something that might make the player feel bad? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course there are always exceptions, even ignoring indie games which for the most part aren't constrained with the same limitations of needing to be profitable to exist.<br />
<br />
I was explaining the plot to Metal Gear Solid 2 to someone the other day, when it occurred to me that maybe a video game can be art just by making the player uncomfortable and by refusing to give them what they expect. Players wanted to play as Solid Snake but could not, and this denial in itself was a metaphor for the plot as revealed later in the game. That by controlling the information a person has access to, you control what they do. It wasn't just the player character that the game implied had been controlled, but the players themselves. <br />
<br />
Spec Ops: The Line is another example of a game that can be considered art through the act of deception. The game is basically a modern military first person shooter that cleverly criticizes the reason why most people play modern military first person shooters.<br />
<br />
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px"><b>Spoiler</b> for <i>Spec Ops spoilers</i>: <input type="button" value="Show" style="width:45px;font-size:10px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onClick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != 'inline') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'inline'; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none';  this.value = 'Show'; }">
</div>
<div class="alt2" style="margin: 0px; padding: 6px; border: 1px inset;">
<div style="display: none;">
<br />
By the end of Spec Ops: The Line, you realize that much of the horrible things that occur only happened because your character got caught up in a wish fulfillment fantasy in which they were a hero. <br />
 
</div>
</div>
</div><br />
<br />
<br />
I had a great example a week ago when I first started putting these thoughts together, but I've lost it now. I was impressed because the gameplay itself was art. Not the story or the world, the way you actually play the game. Burn me for forgetting it.<br />
<br />
Anyway in conclusion, art is not constrained by the whims of the people who consume it, and most video games are.</div>

<br />
&quot;Torment: Tides of Numenera is a game set in the world of Monte Cook’s new tabletop RPG setting, Numenera. Torment continues the thematic legacy of Planescape: Torment, a critically acclaimed role-playing game from 1999 that's considered by many to be a hallmark for storytelling in computer RPGs. With Torment, we're striving to create a rich role-playing experience that explores similar deep, personal themes. Here's the scoop:<br />
<br />
    Torment is a single-player, isometric role-playing game.<br />
    You will play a single, specific character, though you will encounter optional NPC companions you may choose to include in your party.<br />
    The story-driven game will have a rich dialogue system and approach similar to that of Planescape: Torment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Loads more on the kickstarter page. It is already funded, that only took 6 hours.<br />
<br />
The title of the game indicates that it is set in the same world (different time?) of the last kickstarter. <br />

<br />
A year or two ago I was playing an online RPG of sorts.  It was free, but had daily limits on the amount of turns you could take.  If you've played Legend of the Green Dragon, you have the right idea.  <br />
<br />
This game had various cities you could travel to, and had dungeons and such you could go through.  Not exactly 'explore', as it was just a matter of one room detailed in text leading to another room detailed in text, but it was still fun.  There were stats for your characters, <font color="#FF0000">Strength</font>, <font color="#008000">Dexterity</font>, <font color="#0000FF">Intelligence</font>, etc.  As your stats went up, your character level did too.  <br />
<br />
The most defining part of the game was the cards - you built a deck out of them and those determined your attacks and what not.  What cards you could use was determined by your stats -for instance, swords might require a mix of Strength and Dexterity, while axes might be pure strength but more of it.  You got cards from doing dungeons and quests.  You could also attack other players, pitting your deck against theirs.  <br />
<br />
I'm fairly certain the game's name started with an 'E', but don't quote me on that.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I don't suppose there's a shot anyone knows what I'm talking about and can point me in the right direction?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>March is the month where publishers lose their minds. So desperate to get as far away from Call of Duty as possible, while also getting good numbers at the end of the fiscal year, they all release their games all at once. The number of releases is staggering, arguably as much as the rest of the year combined.<br />
<br />
The two biggest games this month, in my mind, are Bioshock Infinite and the Tomb Raider reboot. Bioshock being a long time in coming, and arguably one of the sure things this year. Tomb Raider is going to be more divisive. It marks a shift towards more action and less puzzles (the puzzles being completely optional). Some people are going to love it, and some are going to hate it. It seems to be poised to be a nominee for &quot;game of the year&quot; all the same.<br />
<br />
But this is a great month for exclusives as well: God of War and Gears of War both get a new game for the PS3 and 360 respectively. Amusingly enough, both are also prequels, with Gears of War focusing on the series side characters during the initial invasion, and God of War taking place 10 years before the first game. Supposedly they are going to attempt to paint Kratos as a more human character this time. Ascension will also be notable for being the first God of War with multiplayer. It almost seems to be the point of the game, rather than just a gimmick tacked on.<br />
<br />
PCs have a big month as well. Starcraft 2: Heart of the Swarm, the new Sim City, and the Resident Evil 6 port are all due this month. And while it is technically multiplatform, Metro: Last Light will definitely be best on PC (if it actually comes out this month that is).<br />
<br />
On the Nintendo front, the Wii in the US is getting Pandora's Tower, one of the titles in the fan PR campaign &quot;operation rainfall&quot; that Europe got a year ago. It will be the last title that fans petitioned to be brought over actually, so that makes operation rainfall a complete success. That's notable in and of itself, is it not? <br />
<br />
The Wii U gets a GTA for kids in the form of Lego City Undercover. I'm as sick of Lego games as anyone else, but I'm optimistic for this one, I think it looks good.<br />
<br />
The 3DS also has several titles coming out this month. Most notable Luigi's Mansion, followed by a Pokemon spinoff and a Castlevania game. The latter could be either amazing or mediocre, going to wait and see on that one.<br />
<br />
And finally, as always download only titles are hard to track and I will post as I hear about them, but Darkstalkers is due an HD remake/port for XBLA and PSN this month, supposedly.<br />
<br />
Games not mentioned: Army of Two, Lost Planet 3, Naruto Fighter 3, MLB The Show, Atelier Ayesha, Monster Hunter 3 Wii U port, Dead or Alive 5 vita port<br />
<br />
P.S. Wii U getting several ports, including Aliens Colonial Marines. :evil:<br />
