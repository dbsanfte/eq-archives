      <blockquote>
        <p>You say, 'hail The Dragon Sage'<br>
        The Dragon Sage appears to fade in and out. The ghostly figure seems to 
        stare through you, as though he is not aware of your presence. 'Do you 
        know who I am?', he asks, as if he is inquiring for his own benefit. </p>
        <p>You say, 'who are you?'<br>
        The Dragon Sage begins to smile. 'It has come back to me, just now', he 
        says. 'I am the Dragon Sage. I lived in the once great elven city of 
        Takish Hiz, where I studied the dragons of Norrath.' The figure appears 
        to be concentrating on something in the distance. His image begins to 
        fade as he says, 'If I am among the world of the living again, then 
        Norrath must be in great danger.' </p>
        <p>You say, 'what danger?'<br>
        The Dragon Sage says 'Thousands of years ago, Veeshan, the Mother of All 
        Wurms, made her mark upon the face of a young world called Norrath. She 
        struck the planet with her godly might, laying her claim to the world, 
        and created the beings known as dragons. This began the Age of Scale.
        </p>
        <p>You say, 'what is the age of scale?'<br>
        The Dragon Sage says 'The Age of Scale was the time when dragons ruled 
        supreme. They controlled the lands, the sea, and the sky for some 3000 
        years. That was when other gods took notice. </p>
        <p>You say, 'what other gods?'<br>
        The Dragon Sage says 'Tunare, the Mother of All, Prexus, the Oceanlord 
        and Brell Serilis, the Duke of Below formed a pact in response to 
        Veeshan's claim to Norrath. The elves, the dwarves, and the aquatic 
        kedge were all created to help keep the dragons in check. Rallos Zek, 
        the Warlord, learned of this pact and created the giants. This began the 
        Elder Age. </p>
        <p>You say, 'what is the elder age?'<br>
        The Dragon Sage says 'The Elder Age was the time of the first humanoid 
        races, the oldest on Norrath, next to the dragons. The elves prospered, 
        while the giants struggled to survive. The giants on the frozen 
        continent of Velious were in constant skirmishes with the dragons. It 
        was at this point that the observations began. </p>
        <p>You say, 'what observations?'<br>
        The Dragon Sage says 'The giants, smarter than expected, began watching 
        and observing the habits of the dragons. They paid close attention to 
        the things the dragons avoided... certain plants and watering holes. It 
        was determined that a particular type of plant, when mixed with other 
        reagents, was deadly to the dragons. The giants adapted their technique 
        to specifically harm Yelinak's brood in order to give them an advantage. 
        The ancient Kromzek King, Porlos, used this to aid in his battle with 
        Hsagra, Yelinak's mate. Porlos killed Hsagra, forever bringing Yelinak's 
        vengeance upon his family. Thus began the eternal war between the giants 
        and the dragons. </p>
        <p>You say, 'what plant?'<br>
        The Dragon Sage says 'The name of the plant eludes me at this time, for 
        my thoughts have grown cold through the ages. The findings of the giants 
        were written in a book of lore by some of our sages. You should seek out 
        one of the giant's Tomekeepers. If you find a Tomekeeper, ask him about 
        the herb that harms dragons. Perhaps if you give him this trinket he 
        will assist you. Maybe they will remember my tired soul.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>You receive a coin called a Giant Loyalist Token. At this point take the 
  coin to Tomekeeper Bjordnessin in Wakening Lands Northeast corner (+665, <br>
  -4586) and hand it to him.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Tomekeeper Bjordnessin says 'Amazing! Simply Amazing! The legends must be 
    true! This item was said to have been given to the Dragon Sage as a sign of 
    friendship and trust, but I have always considered it to be legend. The 
    discovery of this artifact will work wonders for my status! I have 
    discovered a legend! Oh... oh yes. You sought information on that herb. Take 
    this back to the sage. Maybe he can decipher it. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Tomekeeper gives you the Giant Scalebound Tome that you need to take back 
  to the dragon sage in Western Wastes.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Dragon Sage takes the guide and immediately begins to scan through 
    it. He then says, 'Ah... Ah yes... According to this book, the dragonbane 
    herb grows only in one place, deep inside the lair of the sirens. If my 
    memory serves me properly one of the creatures there is very fond of its 
    flavor. I will also need the blood of a dragon, but not just any dragon. The 
    blood must come from a beast of Lord Yelinak's bloodline. Please go now and 
    see if you can find this herb and the dragon blood. No time to waste, child. 
    You will need to take this box to contain and combine the herbs and dragon 
    blood in. Once you have accomplished this, please return the box to me. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>You now have in your posession an Ornate Reagent Box. You will use this box 
  to combine both the herb and the blood. The herb is called a 'Dragonbane Herb' 
  and drops in Sirens Grotto off of random mobs that frequent the water areas. 
  One has definitely been dropped from a seahorse.</p>
  <p>The blood is called
  <a onclick="MM_openBrWindow('dragon_blood.jpg','dragonblood','width=330,height=145')" href="javascript:;">
  Dragon Blood</a> and is found on Myga in Western Wastes. Myga looks like 
  Yelinak and wanders all over the zone. It would be wise to bring a tracker. 
  Killing Myga will lower your Claws of Veeshan faction.</p>
  <p>Once you have both items, put them in the Ornate Reagent Box and hit 
  combine. Once combined, the box will turn into a Sealed Reagent Box. Hand this 
  sealed box over to The Dragon Sage to receive your Porlos' Fury spell -</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Dragon Sage says 'Ahhh! With the knowledge that I have gained from 
    the Giant Scalebound Tome and these reagents, I can finish my research and 
    create a most powerful spell for you! If successful, I will call it the 
    Porlos' Fury spell. It will cause near fatal wounds to any dragon or dragon 
    kin in Lord Yelinak's bloodline. Take this and study it. The magiks 
    contained within will aid you in your fight. The Dragon Sage hands you the 
    scroll and says, 'You will need a reagent to channel the magical energies 
    through to enhance the power of the spell. Two peridots will be required to 
    cast this spell. I wish you good fortune in your fight.' </p>
