		<div>A month into GoD, EverQuest has come to a crossroads.<br />
<br />
As the game progresses further along, more difficult encounters must be designed in order to keep players feeling challenged as they accumulate better gear.  In GoD, as with other expansions, this has been achieved through increasing the damage output of mobs.  In order to compensate, a group must increase its ability to heal.  With one class drastically superior in healing power, this leaves us with a serious problem; both now, and as EverQuest continues to grow.<br />
<br />
Before you say it, yes, I know- clerics have always been the superior healers.  My question is- why?  For a long time, there has been equity in tanking (although once again, as single group encounters in GoD start to require defensive, this is no longer as true as it once was); for almost every single group encounter pre-GoD, there was no reason to choose a warrior over a paladin, or a shadow knight over a warrior.  There is equity in slowing; while shamans have a slightly superior slow, there is no major difference between having a beastlord slower, an enchanter slower, or a shaman slower.  There is equity in DPS; a few classes sit at the top, trading places based on circumstances, and there are a few other classes below who have secondary abilities to compensate.  In GoD, most specifically anything from Sewers 1 on up, you are <i>required</i> to have a cleric healer, in addition to a secondary healer.  As you progress upwards, this changes from one cleric healer and one other healer to two cleric healers.<br />
<br />
What I am about to say violates nearly every urge in my mind which rails against the idea, but I truly think it is best for the future of EverQuest.<br />
<br />
Druids need to become nearly as good at healing as clerics are currently.<br />
<br />
For the sake of the future of EverQuest, the cleric dominance over the healing spot in groups needs to be broken.  They should be the best healers; but the gap is much too large now.  A warriors advantage over a paladin or shadow knight is 5% extra damage mitigation and a few hundred hit points.  The difference between the two top slowing classes is 75% vs. 70%.  Let's now compare the difference between clerics and druids, as the two top healing classes.<br />
<br />
<u>Large Scale Healing</u><br />
Clerics: <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=13&amp;source=Live" target="_blank">Complete Healing</a>, 7500hp, 400 mana, 10 sec cast time<br />
Druids: <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3232&amp;source=Live" target="_blank">Karana's Renewal</a>, 4680hp, 600 mana, 10 sec cast time, limited to 75% of a targets total health.<br />
<br />
<u>Blast Healing</u><br />
Clerics: <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4880&amp;source=Live" target="_blank">Holy Light</a>, 3750hp, 650 mana, 3.75 cast time<br />
Druids:  <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4883&amp;source=Live" target="_blank">Sylvan Infusion</a>, 2100hp, 550 mana, 3.75 cast time<br />
<br />
In addition to these basic building blocks of healing, clerics also get regen heals (best of which is <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4882&amp;source=Live" target="_blank">Holy Light</a>), group heals (<a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3471&amp;source=Live" target="_blank">Word of Replenishment</a>), and a plethora of AA heals, including Divine Arbitration and Celestial Renewal.  I should not have to struggle to make my case that cleric healing is drastically more powerful than druid healing.<br />
<br />
The question is, if we increase druids healing power, how do we compensate for the other abilities druids have in regards to cleric balance?<br />
<br />
Well, the abilities they have aren't drastically different in terms of balance.  They both have damage shields, although a clerics is less efficient.  They both have root; druids additionally get snare.  Druids DPS is superior to cleric DPS, although with hammers, this isn't as much as a difference as it once was.  Druids also have resist buffs and debuffs.  I would make the case here that no secondary abilities need to be altered in order to maintain relative balance.<br />
<br />
Druids should be given better heals, or have their current series improved.  A good target would be for druid healing to be 85-90% of what a clerics is.  Clerics should maintain superior HP buffs, in addition to a wider diversity of healing.  Druids should never get group heals or short duration regen heals; however, <b>they should be able to substitute for a cleric as the primary healer for a group</b>.  As EverQuest becomes more challenging and requires more healing power, it cannot continue to have clerics be the overwhelmingly predominant healing force.</div>

		<div>Makes total sense to me.  When I play my cleric, my head spins from the offers for groups, raids, rezzes, buffs, whatever.  Having druids close to the same healing, is completely fine with me.  I agree it should just be a few heals that are upgraded for the druids, they don't need the group heals, etc.  I really don't think it would cause a problem for clerics not being able to find groups either.  Plenty of people would still take a cleric over a druid, on most occassions, given the chance, and I noticed druids are becoming less useful in the high end game.<br />

		<div>honestly, if you have a cleric and something like a ranger, or a wizard.. What good is a druid?  I find myself asking this question when I am forming groups in LDoN.. Having said that, I think that increasing Druid power is a good thing, to a degree.. I like the whole 75% thing.. if you wanted to maintain something like that, I'd agree with it completely... but giving Druids CH, would just be wrong on many levels.. unless you plan to give clerics invis, snare, sow, etc.  Right now, Druids are on the bottom of the barrel for me for plain grouping.. they have uses in raids, and I think its their versatility.. they can play spam/back-up healer, evac'er, nuker, and have some buffage and determinals to use.. where as the cleric is basically hit the CH button when the Chain comes to you.. unless you have an unreasonable amount of cleric power, even then, who knows.. <br />
<br />
someone once said &quot;you can never have too many clerics&quot; and I argued, well, yes you can.. too many clerics can be a very big problem.. eventually they run out of things to do.. Druid can too in theroy, I think maybe the only class that doesn't is probably wizards, and maybe rogues or something, I don't really know, but the fact a million wizards could in theory go kick somethings ass really easy vs. Cleric's ability to heal themselves to death brings up something in raids.. I think thats one thing they have to keep in mind.. Druids are kind of in between that.. They have many more spaces, and are pretty decent DPS, so its almost like you can really never have too many of them.. <br />
<br />
/ooc off<br />
<br />
Damn it, druids suck, they need to burn and go live in a tree, they need no buffage at all they should be the PC equivilent of A large snake</div>

</div> Take a enchanter instead then or a bard. Both would offer better pulling and damage.<br />
<br />
To Claud, DPS with hammer is ~35 to 40dps with Time hammer, exactly how is that close to druid DPS? Druids are also superior for buffing (Try giving someone Virtue if they can get PoTC...).<br />
<br />
All you done with your change is make clerics useless outside the extreme top where a druid can not cut it, in every other place would a druid bring more damage if nothing else then through their DS! Everything a cleric got is defensive AA, if you want to equal the playing field in healing then you better believe it that clerics will need a serious damage bumpage to be able to bring something else then healing. A druid brings PoTC, DS that is unresistable, free clicky dots, charm (though of limited use these days), nukes on two resists and debuffs. Cleric brings (offensive vice) resistable DS that need to be landed on EVERY mob (want to take a guess how usefull that is on 30 sec mobs?), mediocre nukes on anything live, a crappy hammer (a buffed shaman pet do more damage then a cleric meleeing!), poofy the 6dps pet hammer. Clerics also completly lack the utility in form of sow, levitate, EB, invis etc. <br />
<br />
So tell me again why bother to bring a cleric vs a druid after the change?</div>

Well, I don't agree with your basis assumption as my personal experience differ from it.<br />
<br />
You do not need a cleric in sewer DZs, I have done sewer groups with pal/rng/dru/rog/shm/twinkench(me) without any fatalities, twinkie even pulled without problems.<br />
<br />
Guild also has started to do Ikkinz trials with one cleric as sole healer. Not SM yet, but I am confident we will in near future, TS and TF both completed with one cleric and other servers report one cleric + paladin can heal SM - so the argument that several clerics are needed doesn't really hold water, unless you go in with undergeared tanks in which case I believe it is perfectly okay to require several healers for content designed for a higher level of gear/aa/spells/whatever.<br />
<br />
What I do miss, however, is more classes able to perform some sort of ressurection since you can't bind outside the trials and have to wait for DA or BDA to come up, or bring a pal/nec/2ndclr as secondary rezzer. This ability shouldn't be cheap though, and some farming of components could be required for druids to get this ability - then give invis to clerics as well, Gods know they need it for naked runs to zones where we wipe.<br />

/agree on the shaman easy to replace bit<br />
<br />
No mobs really 'require' slow especially as you can't slow the nameds, so basically shamans contribute slow on trash (which you can kill without, if you can kill boss), they do contribute some dot-damage (but burst is what these fights are about) and malos/(inia) - but a druid for Hand of Ro, bard for HoS, mage for Mala/(sinia) or enchanter for tash works just as well and contribute manaregen for the group as a whole, partly offsetting the higher mana expenditure on unslowed (or only 50% slowed in the case of bard).</div>

- when an expansion is new, clerics are greatly in demand for healing and res<br />
- as an expansion ages and tanks gain 2k+hp, cleric importance greatly wanes<br />
<br />
When PoP came out it was a shock how hard mobs hit. I suspect noone ever thought we'd get to the point a (good) druid could be main healer in PoFire.<br />
Ditto with LDoN hards once tanks and support classes aug'd up.<br />
<br />
GoD will go that way too, mark my words.<br />
<br />
Healing (and res) is pretty much all clerics have. If you remove that from them (by sharing it around too much) you have to improve their dps or utility someway else. Yeah clerics will always be in demand for raids but it's both a stressful and boring job. Some clerics love being 'needed' for raids but I think most just do it out of duty (and to get the loot).</div>

I have heard theres a bard class but i have better thing to do than wait 2 years for one to be LFG.<br />
<br />
However thats irrelevent, you said my options where druid or cleric, not driud +enc/bard or cleric. Idealy No class should be &quot;required&quot; to do something in EQ, there should always be options. There is for DPS, there is for tanking, there is for almost everything, except healing on cirtain mobs.</div>

		<div>Why have Clerics always been the superior healers by a bit?  Probably because it's the only thing we do.  Yeah, sure, we have nukes and &quot;cool&quot; hammers... but ever try to nuke with a Cleric?  I rarely have one mem'd because it's just pointless.  Soloing with hammers?  Good for a laugh, but that's about it.<br />

No, sorry.  Druids should be <b>at the very most</b> around 65-70% of what a Cleric is.  They're already hovering around 45-50% as is (they're also about 45-50% of a Wizard in terms of nuking... sometimes higher).  You need to remember that Druids don't just heal.  They can nuke well, they can dot well, they can solo very well... three things a Cleric cannot do well at all.  In standard group situations a Druid should be able to substitute for a Cleric.  In most cases they can.  In raid / difficult group situations (ie. Ikkinz trials) they should be secondary healers only.  Druids need some slight buffs in regards to healing, but nothing major.<br />
<br />
You bring up CH.  Well, while the Druid CH could stand to be upped, it's rather pointless these days.  Ask most Druids how often they cast CH since GoD... hell, ask most Clerics.  I rarely use it, I'm mostly using Holy Light / Holy Elixir for heals instead.  CH is just too slow.<br />
<br />
Shaman on the other hand, they need some work in the healing department.</div>

		<div>I just PL'ed the hell out of my cleric for exactly this reason.  Very well said.<br />
<br />
It's a source of confusion why we accept near parity for ourselves (versus mages, necros, rogues) in our primary skill while we rail against parity for clerics (versus druids, shamans) in theirs.  If we accept mages, necros and rogues as our partners in high DPS, why should clerics not have partners in healing?<br />
<br />
It'd be a pleasant change to see people say &quot;mages, necros and rogues should be 65-70% of a wizard in DPS.&quot; Personally, I think parity is a pain in my white Irish ass, and is designed to make the game easier to play solo...a tend the dev team tries to reverse, half-heartedly and only when a full moon is out.  Clerics are *supposed* to be masters at healing, the same as we're *supposed* to be masters at spellcasting.  That's why the less pure classes have pets, lich, sneak, dot, heal, all the stuff we don't.<br />
<br />
But that ship sailed long ago, and I don't like that we left clerics behind.</div>

		<div>Plain and simple, Shamans and druids need a heal upgrade.<br />
Find something unique to do with their heals though.<br />
Clerics have the big number, straight out heals. They should have them at the lowest mana cost and/or the fastest casting time.<br />
<br />
Give shamans a reverse canni heal.<br />
Sucks away from their mana bar as though it were a dot, and have it add to tank health for as long as that lasts. And allow other spells to be cast while that one is in effect. WIthout looking at the numbers, Let's say 700 health per tick for 350 mana per tick. Give it a 10 tick duration with a near-zero casting cost, and bam. Suddenly the heals a shaman has, which can be used on top of that, are more useful. Even VoQ wouldn't help the shaman much here. You'd have to time it right, and if you needed to, you could canni.<br />
<br />
You'd have a shaman who's feeding his/her magickal power into the spirit world, to provide healing for someone else.<br />
They'd have to code it so it couldn't be used on self, but *shrug*<br />
<br />
Give druids a self-stunning heal. If the druid was the main healer, this would limit the amount of DoT casting they'd be able to do, at least a bit. Give them a full CH just like that of a cleric, with the addition of a 5 or 10 second stun afterwards, rather like our harvest spell. Now they have a choice, heal like a cleric, losing most of your other class benefits, or perform your normal old duties.<br />
Voile! Something that almost slightly resembles balance, just a little.<br />
<br />
Clerics would still be preferred. Shamans have to worry about mana in a major way under this system. If they don't keep an eye on it. *stomp* it's a wipe.<br />
This gives you the ability to take another class as an effective healer, without removing clerics from the lineup. The other healing classes will now have the choice to either heal effectively, or operate within their normal roles.<br />
<br />
Lemme know what you think, I'm just running off at the mouth here.</div>

		<div>If this change were to go in the druids should have to make a choice much like specialization.Top druid nukes and the proposed heals couldn't be scribed in the same spell book or some similar method to seperate them.It would be a good idea to allow the spells to be erased so they could change back if they desired, similar to specialization.Since they would have to get new copies of the spell it would be diffucult to swap them out at a whim.</div>

with the gloves and ID4, and I never use them (in fact I dont even equip the top hammer any more, getting a really nice primary to replace it so I dont have to cast it at start up).<br />
<br />
LoL just looked at my megalo, I not even wear the ornate gloves any more (reduces best cleric nuke mana cost), cause the nukes is so usless heh... <br />
<br />
Clerics heal and heal only (and rez) and thats it. Other classes do everything else better then they do. <br />
<br />
And playing a cleric on raids is mind numbingly boring.<br />
<br />
Clerics dont even have self invisible heh... <br />
<br />
I dont know where some of the higher trials pop bodies at but I never use DA, I can invisible run the cleric to the sewers from the nat port in (if the invisible is cast by someone with max DIV skill - which I think makes the invisible last longer but cant prove it), or use invisible potions also just in case it goes down. DA and DB just take to long to refreash.<br />
<br />
Druids get ports also that none has mentioned.<br />
<br />
If clerics did not heal the best they would be usless cept for rez.</div>
