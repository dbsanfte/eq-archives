        Day*** </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today's 
        patch includes the announced code-updates to use technology included with 
        DirectX 7. You MUST have DirectX 7 or higher installed in order to play 
        EverQuest. Please refer to <a href="%3Cfont%20size=%222%22%20face=%22Verdana,%20Arial,%20Helvetica,%20sans-serif%22%3Ehttp://everquest.station.sony.com/f_requirements.shtml%3C/font%3E" target="_blank">http://everquest.station.sony.com/f_requirements.shtml</a> 
        prior to contacting technical support for procedures prior to contacting 
        technical support.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today's 
        patch also includes the new "Sound Engine" that we've been speaking about 
        for some time. The new sound engine supports additional EAX features and 
        should address the concerns of SBLive users that have been posted in the 
        past.</font></p>

        *Movelog for Povar and Tarew Marr* </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        /movelog window will be opened for Povar and Tarew Marr on Saturday 11/18 
        and Sunday 11/19 from 6PM PST (GMT-8) to Midnight. All players wishing 
        to have all of their characters moved (on a per-account basis) from those 
        servers to the new split-server should execute "/movelog yes" during the 
        windows.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        physical character move will take place next week on Tuesday or Wednesday. 
        Please check the scheduled downtime page of www.everquest.com for a firm 
        time when it is decided. Remember that corpses will not follow you to 
        the new server, so anyone deciding to move will want to be sure that all 
        corpses are looted prior to the time of the actual move. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
        this patch features new /movelog logic to eliminate problems with people 
        being left behind, players should not count on customer-service intervention 
        after the physical move if they were unable to execute the command during 
        the window. You will need to be present and execute the command in order 
        to move.</font></p>

        Changes* </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pixie 
          Strike: Made it less resistible by reducing the secondary resist. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Song of 
          Twilight: Increased duration. Made less resistible by removing the secondary 
          resist. Allowed it to be cast at any time of day. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fixed 
          the effect on the Necromancer Epic Quest Item. The effect was checking 
          resist on each tick instead of running full course. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Increased 
          the duration of the effect on the Enchanter Epic Quest Item. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fixed 
          the "Modulating Rod" so that it can be used by the appropriate races.

          Pact and Divine Intervention spells will now stack appropriately with 
          other spells that have similar effects.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Modified 
          the "Jonathan's" line of songs to remove the "skin" effect in order 
          to allow bards to use them more effectively in combat. In addition, 
          we made them "Self Only" spells rather than "Single Target" spells in 
          order to allow bards to remain in combat while singing them.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*General 
        Fixes/Changes* </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fixed

          of the River" quest should now work correctly. </font></li>

          all known problems with the class-specific epic quests. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Implemented 
          some new race-specific quests for Iksar. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Positively 
          modified most Epic Quest Items. Please check your items to see your 
          changes. Note: Not all changes will be evident by looking at the item. 
          </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fixed 
          the NPC bosses in the Plane of Sky that were not dropping the correct 
          loot. </font></li>

        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Repaired 
          the Forager Bag. It was causing people to lose weight when placing items 
          in the bag. It is supposed to have a weight reduction component, but 
          was not supposed to cause weight loss. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Taunt: 
          Increased effectiveness above level 50. Previously, creatures above 
          level 50 could not be taunted by means of the taunt skill. Now, most 
          creatures below the character's level can now be successfully taunted. 
          As a note, the chance to taunt a creature above 50th level is smaller 
          than that of a creature below 50th.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*Client Enhancements*</font></p>

          can now set custom text colors while in game. /usercolor: Usage "/usercolor

          as indicated in the EQCLIENT.INI file, and R, G, and B are red, green

        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OPT files 
          in your EverQuest directory now have a number after the character name 
          indicating the server number. As such, you will now be able to have 
          characters of the same name on two separate servers with different custom

        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The eqlog.txt

          key mappings have been greatly enhanced. You can now set two keys, a 
          primary and an alternate, for each function in game. In addition, things 
          that were previously not customizable can now be set to a key of your 
          preference. Left-click on the key identifier to set the primary key, 
          right-click to set the secondary. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Added 
          the /note command. /note will append the following text to a file called
