jesus, I just finished it. There are still some anthologies that I'll need to get, but from book 1 to the end of something like 42 issues later, this is definitely one of the best &quot;mini series&quot; I've read in a very long time. <br />
<br />
I'm especially glad that I got to it before the movies are officially announced (apparantly the trailers hit comic-con in July).<br />
<br />
This is an amazing series, and better even more-so that it is over. These series that one doesn't have to sit stuck to month after month are truly better than their alternative. <br />
<br />
Great art and great story.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So, I got one of these as a sort of late Christmas gift surprise.<br />
<br />
I just took it out and started using it after ordering and receiving the Otterbox  that goes to it.<br />
<br />
word of advice. If you go with one of these tablets, choose the imitator's case, as opposed to the otter. The screen lacks a top cover at the very top where the Samsung logo is on the screen. It is something to do with the IR  sensor, but the other brands (like the unicorn), don't have the gap. Fwiw, the Otterbox should be okay for me, at least immediately.<br />
<br />
This is a strange tablet. <br />
<br />
First off, the screen resolution is gorgeous. I am one of those people who eye candy never falls short on, and the demo videos it came with gave me eyegasms, as well as watching a handful of movies on it (gravity was wonderful).<br />
<br />
The tab (s) is also available in a 10.1&quot; version as well. For whatever reason, the number of peripherals available for the 8.4 do not number the plethora available for the 10.1. And here I thought consumers were more interested in the smaller versions of tablets as a whole. <br />
<br />
This was a little upsetting after receiving it, as I am sort of a dork for proprietary peripherals, and tend to collect them like pokemon. I was looking forward to the keyboard that is sold only in korea. It is ridiculously priced to get over hree, so I guess I'll have to go with a third party.<br />
<br />
I don't have any experience with rooting android devices, but I was thinking of doing it with this tablet as a first timer. It came loaded with a whole bunch of stuff I never would have considered using, but because so much if it was tied to free trials, I started running game it anyway; part of me thinking that there was something I might be missing <br />
<br />
(Gotta shampoo my smelly dog - I'll come back to this kater).</div>

			Melted plastic trash on beaches can sometimes mix with sediment, basaltic lava fragments and organic debris (such as shells) to produce a new type of rock material, new research shows.<br />
<br />
The new material, dubbed plastiglomerate, will forever remain in Earth's rock record, and in the future may serve as a geological marker for humankind's impact on the planet, researchers say.<br />
<br />
Plastic pollution is a worldwide problem affecting every waterway, sea and ocean in the world, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. First produced in the 1950s, plastic doesn't break down easily and is estimated to persist in the environment for hundreds to thousands of years. Plastic debris is also lightweight, allowing it to avoid being buried and becoming a part of the permanent geological record.

		<hr />
		
			Couples who wanted to skip the pomp and circumstance of a wedding and get married at the Duval, Clay or Baker county courthouses will no longer have that option in the new year.<br />
<br />
These counties' decision to end the long-standing tradition of courthouse wedding ceremonies is due, at least in part, to the continued debate over same-sex marriage in Florida against the backdrop of conservative Christianity. U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle could rule any day and make gay marriage legal across the state.<br />
<br />
If same-sex marriage is allowed, Duval Clerk of Courts Ronnie Fussell, Clay Clerk Tara Green and Baker Clerk Stacie Harvey will have no choice but to issue marriage licenses to gay couples. But to avoid performing ceremonies for them, these clerks have decided to end all courthouse weddings.<br />
<br />
The clerks said multiple factors contributed to the decision to end courthouse weddings, with gay marriage being just one of them. And they now said the new policies will take effect no matter what the courts decide about gay marriage.<br />
<br />
Fussell says the decision came after a series of discussion with members of his staff who currently officiate wedding ceremonies. None of them, including Fussell, felt comfortable doing gay weddings so they decided to end the practice all together, he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was decided as a team, as an office, this would be what we do so that there wouldn't be any discrimination,&quot; Fussell said. &quot;The easiest way is to not do them at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Equality Florida co-founder and chief executive Nadine Smith was shocked to hear that certain counties would stop allowing courthouse wedding because of the possibility that gay couples would want to use the service.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it would be outrageous for clerks to change the rules simply because gay couples are getting married,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Smith, an advocate for gay and lesbian rights, predicted the policy change would backfire and be characterized as spiteful and mean.<br />
<br />
There were 1,911 wedding ceremonies performed at the Duval County Courthouse in 2013, compared to 6,342 marriage licenses issued. About 330 Clay County couples are married at its courthouse each year, and Baker averages about 30.<br />
<br />
Clerks of courts in Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties in the Panhandle also made similar announcements that they were ending courthouse ceremonies.<br />
<br />
Nassau County Clerk of Courts John Crawford has not responded to a request about any changes there.<br />
<br />
The clerks of courts in St. Johns and Putnam counties said they will continue to offer courthouse weddings, even if gay marriage becomes legal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything will remain the same,&quot; said George Lareau, St. Johns County's chief deputy clerk of courts.<br />
<br />
Putnam County Clerk of Courts Tim Smith said he will allow individual members of his staff who feel uncomfortable with gay marriage to decline to perform those ceremonies, but no one has said they will take him up on the offer.<br />
<br />
&quot;They still can have a marriage ceremony here, and one of our staff will not be in an uncomfortable position if that is their belief,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Fussell, a former Jacksonville City Council president, attends a Southern Baptist church and said he has considered how to handle the conflict between his personal views and professional duties that gay marriage created. He said he believes lesbians and gays should be defended and protected, but not allowed to marry.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe marriage is between a man and a woman,&quot; he said. &quot;Personally it would go against my beliefs to perform a ceremony that is other than that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Only through Friday, couples can get married at the Duval County courthouse for $30 in addition to the $93.50 fee for a marriage license.<br />
<br />
Last Valentine's Day, Fussell personally officiated a mass wedding for 12 couples in the courthouse rotunda. He waived the ceremony fee, and local businesses gave each bride flowers and a cupcake reception.<br />
<br />
With the possibility that he would be forced to include gay couples who wanted to participate this year, he and his staff decided there will be no weddings under the dome or in the &quot;wedding arbor&quot; room that is most often used for these ceremonies.<br />
<br />
Residents of Baker, Clay and Duval counties who want to avoid usual wedding expenses will now have to find a minister or notary to perform the ceremony after they pick up their marriage license, but a place other than the courthouse.<br />
<br />
Baker Clerk Harvey said the decision is as much about logistics as it is personal conviction. The room where weddings are performed each year will now be used as space for people filling out paperwork related to domestic violence injunctions.<br />
<br />
&quot;I needed the space and our county we're in the Bible Belt,&quot; she said. &quot;... If we're made by the law to issue a gay marriage license (we will) do that, but we are not mandated to marry couples in our courthouse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harvey said there are members of her staff who would be uncomfortable performing same-sex weddings and she did not want to force them. She said she doesn't feel comfortable performing weddings at all, gay or straight, and hasn't officiated a ceremony in years.<br />
<br />
Justin Horan, general counsel for the Clay County clerk of courts, said the debate over gay marriage accelerated discussions on whether to end courthouse weddings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really it just expedited our evaluation on whether to continue to offer marriage ceremonies,&quot; he said. &quot;We had been talking about it for several months now.&quot;<br />
<br />
In addition to ending weddings, the Clay courthouse will no longer allow residents applying for passports to take their photos there. Once a new web-based system launches, people also won't be able to purchase foreclosed properties at the courthouse.<br />
<br />
&quot;We felt that it was appropriate for us to focus on other services that the clerk offers,&quot; Horan said.

			The United States has vetoed a United Nations Security Council draft resolution on Palestinian statehood that demanded Israel withdraw from the occupied territories.<br />
<br />
Even without the U.S. veto, the measure would have fallen one vote short of the nine it needed among the council's 15 members in order to pass.<br />
<br />
U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power explained the veto by saying Israeli-Palestinian peace can only come from &quot;hard choices and compromises&quot; and that the resolution would not move the sides closer to a two-state solution.<br />
<br />
&quot;We voted against this resolution not because we are indifferent to the daily hardships or the security threats endured by Palestinians and Israelis. But because we know that those hardships will not cease and those threats will not subside until the parties reach a comprehensive settlement achieved through negotiations,” said Power.<br />
<br />
Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian representative at the U.N., criticized the council and said it is not fulfilling its responsibilities.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Security Council has once again failed to uphold its charter duties to address these crises and to meaningfully contribute to a peaceful and lasting solution in accordance with its own resolutions,&quot; said Mansour.<br />
<br />
The draft would have given Israel until the end of 2017 to pull out of the West Bank and Gaza back to the pre-1967 war borders. It also called for Israel and the Palestinians to reach a peace deal within one year.<br />
<br />
The French News Agency quoted a Hamas spokesman criticizing Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, saying the push for a Security Council resolution was a &quot;unilateral decision&quot; and that he has &quot;taken the Palestinian decision-making process hostage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu praised the vote Wednesday, thanking the United States, Australia, Rwanda and Nigeria. The U.S. and Australia voted against the measure, while Rwanda and Nigeria were two of the five countries that abstained.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>The break is almost over and a new year of video game releases begins. Don't worry if you are like me and still have catching up to do, there are a couple of notable titles this month but the year doesn't really get heated for another month or two. <br />
<br />
I would say the biggest game this month is probably <b>Dying Light</b>. It's an open world zombie game from the people who made Zombie Island. They've been hyping it for awhile. During the day the zombies are weak and you have to contend with other humans. At night the zombies get super strong and you mostly either try to hide or run away. Pretty sure this is one of the games that has been delayed from 2014. As I recall, Zombie Island was a bit of a buggy mess, so I would be cautious with this one. Hopefully the extra time they took paid off. It is nevertheless the only major new release this month.<br />
<br />
The ports are really starting to add up lately, and the biggest one this month is probably <b>Saints Row IV</b> for the PS4 and Xone. It comes with a stand alone expansion that you can also buy on multiple platforms, including PC and PS3/360. The PC version of <b>Grand Theft Auto 5</b> is also due this month, as is a <b>Resident Evil</b> remake, and the updated versions of the classic Lucasarts adventure game <b>Grim Fandango</b>. I've played Grim Fandango. It's solid, but I never understood the overwhelming amount of love that game gets from its fans.<br />
<br />
The PS3 and Vita get a few Japanese games this month, including the newest <b>Atelier</b> jrpg for PS3 and a port of the previous one on Vita. I also want to make special mention of <b>Brandish</b>. I don't know what this is exactly, but I've seen a small amount of excitement among jrpg fans for it. I want to mention it mostly because it's actually a PSP game that finally got localized. I just find this amusing for some reason. Probably because I refuse to resurrect the PSP section of these threads for it. :p<br />
<br />
Finally, I'm a sucker for good trailers and saw this while googling the various indie titles that are supposed to come out soon. <b>Life is Strange</b> is an episodic adventure game made by the people who made Remember Me. I wouldn't expect much game here, but it might be fun for people who are into interactive movies. I'm intrigued, at the very least.<br />

			The end of an era closes. We say a fond farewell to Star Wars. The wookiees will be missed and bounty hunters will be sad. But take heart young Jedi, for these last few days you can seal in carbonite the entire Dark Horse digital library of Star Wars. Get every comic, every panel, every battle in perfect digital format in your collection. Access via the cloud city when ever you want. Many of these comics may never see the force again, or print. Get 20 years of Star Wars comic history at a once in a lifetime price.<br />
<br />
All Star Wars comics purchased by 1/1/2015 will remain in your collection.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>Apparently Disney is pulling the license so they can give it to Marvel or something?  Not really sure.  But hey, if you got $300 laying around, here ya go!<br />
<br />
*edit* Looking around their site, looks like you can get individual issues for 50% off if you already have some of them.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>saw quite few folk quoting the impact if just &quot;dropped&quot; (using Earth's gravity for acceleration only after a mild &quot;push&quot;) would be 100 tons of TNT equivalent<br />
felt that was a bit off, so did some calculations<br />
<br />
assume a rod 7 metres long by 0.5 metres wide as your &quot;telegraph pole equivalent&quot; <br />
thing is, USA &quot;utility pole&quot; and UK &quot;Telegraph pole&quot; aren't the same thing, USA ones tend to be larger, UK has standards (at least, rough ones for BT and electrical grid poles), USA doesn't far as I know?<br />
<br />
actual size of a UK &quot;telegraph pole&quot; goes from 24' to 30' long and 5&quot; to 10&quot; inch diameter at the top and half that again thicker that at base say about 8&quot; to 15&quot;.<br />
American utility poles tend to be 40' long from what I read?<br />
<br />
I think you'd really want to make it squatter as thin/long as telegraph pole would be likely end up breaking through atmosphere stress?<br />
an 8 metres telegraph pole in UK goes from about 21 to 15 cm diameter bottom to top<br />
thus I went with a rod 8 metres long and 0.5 metres thick, squatter and less likely to break and within reasonable dimensions. <br />
Sound ok? or you think it should be bigger along lines of USA?<br />
<br />
Going with my &quot;UK small portion&quot; size :p<br />
so, it's mass would be <br />
cylinder 800cms x 50 cms = approx 1,570,800 cm3 (for simplicity's sake)<br />
<br />
tungsten density approx. 19 gm/cm3<br />
<br />
thus total weight of &quot;rod&quot; = 29,845,200 gms <br />
call it 30 tons, 30,000kg. pine wood goes from about .3 to .5 density, and telegraph poles typically weigh around 500kg, so that seems reasonable?<br />
<br />
<br />
1/2 mass x velocity squared = kinetic energy of impact.<br />
<br />
Assuming impact speed of approx. 20,000 mph, since you can calculate a perfect re-entry that's almost impossible otherwise, density/small cross section so little loss of speed on impact.<br />
and little if any loss of mass due to tungsten's incredibly high melting point.<br />
Earth's escape velocity is 25,000+ mph so impact at 20,000 mph from orbital drop seems plausible?<br />
<br />
thus speed in metres per second = 8940 metres per second, call it 9000 metres per second, again for simplicity.<br />
<br />
thus kinetic energy = 1,215,000,000,000 Joules<br />
4 gigajoules = 1 ton of TNT equivalent<br />
<br />
Thus final energy of around 300 tons of TNT equivalent<br />
if you used a larger rod based on USA utility pole kind of thing, of course you'd get more energy.<br />
though getting a 30+ ton rod up into space is no trivial thing at the moment (<font color="#FF0000">*</font>)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
not bad from a simple rod of metal with no acceleration/rockets etc beyond that to push it into being brought down by Earth's own gravity!<br />
<br />
thank God for web based calculator's me old brains ain't up to that shit no more :p<br />
so are my figures off? :)<br />
<br />
<br />
(<font color="#FF0000">*</font>)<br />
which is one beef I have with an alternative time line history book I was reading, no WAY Stalin could have thousands of such weapons in orbit in 1950s even with advanced tech thanks to computers etc from an accidental time travel event (&quot;Stalin's Hammer&quot; by John Birmingham)<br />
<br />
it just increased level of tech knowledge a couple of decades and imperfectly at that especially in Stalin's case as Beria tortured to death all the crew of the British warship of 2023AD they got their hands on, so they have <i>knowledge </i>but little <i>understanding </i>.<br />
<br />
it did not made it possible to orbit tens of thousands of tons of metal rods and <i>not be noticed </i> doing so especially since the West DID get the &quot;understanding&quot; and vastly more tech thanks to much of a &quot;time displaced&quot;  U.N. military task fleet joining willingly!! even now to orbit that much material would be a huge task<br />
imagine <i>some </i>1980/90s levels of tech in 1950s West, and 70s in Russia but with huge problems thanks to Stalin's crap.</div>
