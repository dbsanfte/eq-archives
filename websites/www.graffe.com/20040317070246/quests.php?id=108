  <tr>
    <td width="547"> <p>This is the third of four Sewer trials given by the 
    High Priest in Barindu. Please note you need to have hailed the High Priest 
    before starting this mission. However you can still receive the flag as long 
    as the expedition leader has completed the previous trials.</p>
    <p>You need to clear up to Alej Leraji who is trapped under a piece of 
    stone. Pretty straight forward dungeon crawl. You can invis/lull past parts 
    if you want, but I would reccomend clearing. The room before him is filled 
    with ghosts that see invis but you can IVU through it if you want. </p>
    <p>There is a portion of the map underwater east of the water wheel and 
    north of the first room after zone in. I would highly recommend staying on 
    dry land at the edge of the water and pulling up to there. </p>
    <p>Once you hail Alej he'll ask you for his tools which are scattered around 
    the zone, this spawns 3 rooms (B, C, and D on the map). I would run from 
    Alej to the Water Wheel room first. Kill the mobs there and eventually 
    you'll get an emote saying you find some tools. Then evacuate to the zone in 
    and kill the golems there until you get a second emote. Finally run over to 
    the Cocoon room and get the final tools. There is a timer for this part but 
    I'm not sure how long it is. I would guess thirty minutes.</p>
    <p>Once you have all three tools run back to Alej and hail him to 
    complete the trial. </p>
