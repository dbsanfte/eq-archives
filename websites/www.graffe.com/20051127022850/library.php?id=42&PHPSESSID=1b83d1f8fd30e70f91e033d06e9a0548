    <b>39-48, Butcher Block Mountains</b></font><br>

    Zone Name: Butcher Block Mountains<br>
    Camp Name: Den & Friends<br>
    Mob List: Den IronBlade, +2 other dwarven females and a male dwarf fishing 
    along the coast.<br>
    Availability (1->10): 4 <br>

    females, Guards decreased if you kill the fishing dwarf as well.<br>
    <br>
    Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: This is an awesome camp, great money, and awesome 
    XP. Now granted, when I did this camp from 44-48, there was no KEI in the 
    game, so perhaps now its faster elsewhere, but without KEI, you can med up 
    to full just in time for these guys to repop. I imagine with KEI you could 
    quad these dwarves, then go quad the dwarves up by the docs as well, and 
    still get back before a re-pop. The money here is excellent and really, do 
    you even want dwarf faction? Heck no.</span><ul>
      <li><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Often camped, 
      but not so much anymore as people don't want to ruin faction.</span></li>
      <li><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Amazing plat 
      making possibilities. Each dwarf drops 1-2pp in coins, and items worth 
      between 3-15pp, and there is a druid vendor right near where you kite 
      them. Can easily make several hundred plat an hour here.[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]<br>
