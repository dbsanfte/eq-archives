    Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: This is a great quadding spot, as it is nearly 
    never camped. It is a great alternative to the usually camped Cobalt Scar, 
    but is slightly more challenging. The biggest warning is to try to avoid 
    most Sarnaks, which are plentiful here. They are typically SoW’ed and can 
    provide some difficulty there. The best area to pull and rest is the burned 
    out area down the hill from the nest. None of the hornets see invis 
    (skeletons and gorillas do though). It can be a challenge to get a hang of 
    where the good mobs spawn and you might have to mix in some gorillas and 
    skeletons. They are pretty safe to add in though some of the higher-level 
    ones have more HP than the hornets and will require a finishing off nuke. 
    The Scoriae hornets also have a lot of HP and will require the same. <br>
    <br>
    NOTE: Reminder that sometimes the Sarnaks are SoWed here. To make sure one 
    isn't *don't* pull it while it's standing still but look at it walk.</span><p>
