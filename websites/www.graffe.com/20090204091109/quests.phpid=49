  <p align="left">This is one of the many collection quests done from the Plane 
  of Knowledge. Before starting it you must have a Collector's Box which you can 
  get from Merri, also in PoK. This quest is given by Lohie Cantare.</p>

  <br>
  Lohie Cantare says 'Greetings, _______. Have you come to see my exhibit? I am 
  honored but also sad to say it is incomplete. Mine will be the finest 
  presentation of musical history you will find, once I finish assembling my 
  display. If you have some free time, perhaps you could help me collect some 
  still missing [pieces]?'<br>
  <br>
  <b>You say, 'What pieces?'</b><br>
  <br>
  Lohie Cantare says 'I need you to bring me a Minotaur Horn, Tambourine of 
  Rituals, Orcish Lute of Singing, and a Stretched Skin Drum. If you could find 
  these for me, I would be most overjoyed. You will need to get a Collector's 
  Box from [Merri] to keep them in. Close the box up tightly and return it to me 
  once you have placed the instruments inside. Hurry back and we shall have a 
  grand festival!'</font></p>

  <p><font size="2"><i><font color="#CCBBFF">.:: You can find the horns on 
  Minotaurs either in Beholder or Steamfont. A Ry`Gorr Minstrel drops the Orcish 
  Lute. He can be found at the orc fort in Eastern Wastes ::.</font></i><br>
