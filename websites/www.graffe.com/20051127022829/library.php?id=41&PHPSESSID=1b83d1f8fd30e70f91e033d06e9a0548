    <br>
    Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: There are 4 spectres on the island on each 
    corner. Just grab levitate and tflux them and run around in circles. Once 
    they are snared you can quad them on the island, but if you are nervous just 
    run them to the south shore and quad there. I have never had a spectre agro 
    someone else during a pull and it impresses the hell out of some people.<br>
    <br>
    There are four (4) more spectres in the tower, one (1) on the bottom and 
    three (3) up top. You can target and pull the spectres up top through the 
    walls, since you can see them sticking out through the walls. Just tflux 
    them and keep running. Mostly light blue to 49, but before that its all dark 
    blue.<br>
    <br>
    Two (2) quads per 15 minute respawn, can sell/buy bandages at gypsies or the 
    inn depending if you are evil and good. Oasis is a fun zone too. If you get 
    bored you can slay a Sand Giant for some pp. Nice camp![if !supportLineBreakNewLine]<br>
