<br><ul>Test Server Update - December 20, 2005<BR>
<BR>
 These items are currently on the Test Server.  We expect these will be going to Live Servers in Upcoming Live Updates, but can not guarantee they will be in the next Live Update.  Please feel free to log onto Test and check them out! <BR>
 <BR>
*** Events ***<BR>
 <BR>
- The planar projection for defeating Mithaniel Marr was not rewarding the correct character flags.  This has been fixed.<BR>
 <BR>
*** Tradeskills ***<BR>
 <BR>
– Planar Fletching Kits are now tradeable.<BR>
- Changed Othmir Short Beer to use a bottle instead of a Cask.<BR>
 <BR>
*** Spells ***<BR>
 <BR>
- Increased the duration and lowered the mana cost of Talisman of the Tribunal.<BR>
- The Test of Efficiency spell should no longer conflict with Peace of the Disciple or Grace of the Order.<BR>
 <BR>
*** AAs ***<BR>
 <BR>
- Gift of Mana will no longer be used up when casting a 0 mana spell after it has triggered on you.<BR>
- Gift of Mana should now have a chance to trigger on heals other than just instant heals, including heal over time and percent healing spells.<BR>
<B>- The way that the wizard AA Mana Burn works has been modified.  The new version will use a maximum of 3000 mana instead of draining your whole pool and will do 4 damage for every point of mana spent.  This is a raw channeling of magical energy that cannot be focused, and will not crit.  The ability is unresistable by normal creatures, but certain extremely powerful creatures may be immune to the effects.  Like the original version, once a Mana Burn ability has affected a target, no other mana burn abilities will be able to affect that target for the next minute.  Upgraded versions of the ability, Mana Blast and Mana Blaze, are available at level 65 and level 70 and use a maximum of 6000 and 9000 mana respectively.  The original Mana Burn ability has been refunded and can be repurchased by Wizards interested in the new version. </b><BR><br><br>-Qaman</ul></div>

~ Holiday Festival ~<BR>
<BR>
M.C. Tinkerton needs help repairing his Clockwork Party Machine in time to celebrate 3199! The party machine's dance gyroscopes, firework cannons and party favor dispensers are fully functional, but the most important piece, the machine's primary party motivator, was stolen at the zero hour. M.C. Tinkerton seeks adventurers to steal back the primary party motivator from the Dark Mistletoe giants, a grouchy clan of frost giant nomads in the Great Divide. Seek out M.C. Tinkerton in the Plane of Knowledge for further details. <BR>
<BR>
~ New Arena ~<BR>
<BR>
A new arena zone is now available off of Lake Rathe!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*** Tradeskill ***<BR>
<BR>
- Shield of Maelin now uses the proper quill.<BR>
- The following LDoN spell research recipes have been disabled: Death's Despair, Instinctual Panic, Eidolon Bellow, Soulless Panic, Angstlich's Echo of Terror, Jitterskin, Unholy Bellow, Shadow Bellow, Call of the Muse, Guidance. <BR>
- Jar of Clockwork Grease is now made with a Small Grease Jar in a toolbox. A Small Grease Jar is made the same way a clay jar is, except that you use a Small Grease Jar Sketch. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*** Events, Missions <BR>
<BR>
- Additional text has been added to "Investigate a Disappearance" that should help clear up a confusing spot late in the task.<BR>
- Soulseeker, Death's Sigh can no longer drop more than once per kill.<BR>
- The Mask of the Hidden quest in the Ascent now resets properly after 1 hour of inactivity. <BR>
- Monster Mission experience now properly takes into account hell level modifiers. These modifiers smooth out the experience curve to lessen the impact of the old hell levels (30, 35, 40, and 45). Inclusion of these modifiers in the monster experience will cause you to gain more experience than before during hell levels, essentially returning it to a normal level, but you will gain slightly less experience than before when you are not on a hell level. <BR>
- Within Monster Missions, you will now find Shards of Wisdom that will impart upon you the experiences of the creature you inhabit at the time. Looting one of these shards will grant the experience to your main character upon successful completion of the mission.<BR>
- Aid Fimli in the Plane of Knowledge will now offer to trade you a Cloak of Lesser Pernicity for a Cloak of Greater Pernicity. This is for players who wish to have the original cloak instead of the new, attunable cloak. <BR>
- Clockwork Commander Cogswain has outfitted his clockwork models with upgraded weaponry for the War Machines monster mission that begins in Lavastorm. He only has a limited supply of Clockwork Models in commission, so be careful with them. <BR>
- Farsoth Mal has regained some of his power deep within the Lair of Splitpaw. Defeating him may prove a bigger challenge than before!<BR>
- Dinner invitations to Dreadspire Keep are now flame-resistant and reusable.<BR>
- The Performer event will now respawn properly after a failure.<BR>
- The respawn time on many NPCs in the Demiplane of Blood has been significantly increased.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*** Items ***<BR>
<BR>
- Archaeologist Flottwit has uncovered a cache of older Darkhollow items and is currently searching the bazaar for some of the newer items for comparison. If you have a Depths of Darkhollow item that changed from tradeable to no trade with the last patch and you'd prefer to have the old tradeable item instead, give the no trade version to Flottwit and he'll give you the old tradeable item in return. Flottwit will only be around until the next patch. <BR>
- Heartlight is now no-drop, poof-on-death, and no-rent.<BR>
- The mixing bowl and oven now identify Rockhopper eggs more clearly. <BR>
- The Cultural Charms should now be tradeable on Firiona Vie. <BR>
- Sporali Battle Hammer of Spirits and Daybreak, Bringer of Light have had their proc chances modified.<BR>
- Vule's Frozen Heart and Frozen Heart Shards now have +30 atk, +3 accuracy, and reduced weight.<BR>
- The hitpoint and mana values on the following items have been increased: Ring of Dark Mists, Dark Void Shoulders, Jagged Coral Choker, and Pristine Illsalin Stonecraft Mask. <BR>
- Some of the Depths of Darkhollow hp/mana augmentations were increased too much in the last patch and have been reverted to their old values.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*** NPC ***<BR>
<BR>
- Hatchet the Torturer will now always leave a corpse when slain. <BR>
- Nitram Anizok has become interested in some of the clockwork that are near the Plane of Innovation entrance. He will now wander from his workshop and explore the entry to the plane for a few minutes before returning to his workshop.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*** Titles ***<BR>
<BR>
- Corrected an issue that prevented server-based suffixes for the Cazic Thule server from being displayed properly. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*** Spells ***<BR>
<BR>
- Renamed "Zombie Malaise" to "Wurine Guard" and "Wurine Guard" to "Zombie Malaise". This is to correct an inconsistency in the naming. <BR>
- Corrected the spelling of "Thief" in the description for the spell Enduring Vision.<BR>
- Capitalized "Eyes" in the spell Thief's Eyes.<BR>
- Fixed issues with the Aura of Arcanum spells to allow better stacking with other resist buffs.<BR>
- Summon Companion will now summon a pet even when you have Steadfast Servant up.<BR>
- Field of Vision spells will now stay persistent through zoning.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*** AAs ***<BR>
<BR>
- Gift of Mana will no longer trigger on any spell that costs no mana to cast.<BR>
- The monk AA Eye Gouge is now more effective and will stack better with other attack debuffs.<BR>
- The magician AA Elemental Agility should now properly cause your pet to be hit less often.<BR>
- Guardian of Ro ranks 2 and 3 will now properly increase the damage that your Guardian of Ro does.<BR>
- Attempting to use Living Shield before the cool down is finished should no longer result in an error message.<BR>
- When Bards use the Origin ability it can now be interrupted by ducking.<BR>
- AA's should no longer vanish from your AA list until you zone.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*** UI ***<BR>
<BR>
- A bug where the UI could not be reloaded more than a few times has been fixed.<BR>
- The 'Skills' option on the EQ menu has been moved down into the player information sub-menu.<BR>
- Added new EQType label "Target of Target Name", type 135, at the request of the UI community.<BR>
- Added optional "CloseButton" button to the Story Window at the request of the UI community. The default UI doesn't have this button, but if UI creators want it they can add one now.<BR>
- The UI XML parser has been slightly optimized, slower computers may notice a slight decrease in load times.<BR>
- Through a change to defaults.ini, the way the Evolving Item XP Transfer window opens should no longer obscure parts of the window. <BR>
- A Bazaar Search UI bug where the All Effects filter would no longer bring up weapons with combat effects has been fixed.<BR>
- The bandolier window is now persistent across a zone change.<BR>
- Hotkeys in the hotbar as well as in the actions window will remain useable when you exit a monster mission.<BR>
- It is no longer possible to get 2 group leaders in the same group in the raid window.<BR>
- In the Bard Songs Window, all icons should now appear the same size and not overlap each other.<BR>

*** Depths of Darkhollow*** <BR>
<BR>
Many of the single group attainable rewards from the Depths of Darkhollow expansion have received significant upgrades. This includes more than 1,000 items from all over the expansion. Also, to allow players who have deleted items a chance to get them again, the rewards you get for completing a mission the first time are now given to you whenever you complete the mission and do not already have the reward. <BR>
We've also made many tuning changes to the DoD missions to provide a smoother ramp up in difficulty over the course of the expansion. In general, earlier missions are now a bit easier and missions further into the expansion are now a bit more challenging, particularly the hard level missions. <BR>
<BR>
*** New Monster Missions *** <BR>
<BR>
- A gnollish zealot has been spotted near the bridge in South Karana. He speaks of the rift within Paw and the final whereabouts of the son of Ishva Mal. Perhaps there is still hope for the prisoners within. <BR>
- The Solusek Mining Company has begun recruiting clockwork pilots for a special mission. Report to Clockwork Commander Widgetsworth in Lavastorm for further details. <BR>
<BR>
*** Spells *** <BR>
<BR>

- Ravenous Hunger has been changed. It is now named "Ravenous Sloth" and is a 40% duration extender on the spell "Lingering Sloth". <BR>

<BR>
*** Items *** <BR>
<BR>

- The weight on all versions of the Mask of Horror for the Halloween event has been decreased. <BR>
- Ensorcelled Great Sword of the Night should now proc correctly for players at level 55 and greater who can wield the sword. The Greatsword is also more visually imposing. <BR>
- All none/none flagged containers in the game are now flagged as all/all. This should fix some issues with containers not showing up in varied item searches in the bazaar and item point vendors. <BR>
- Some of the "Last Blood" augmentations now have stronger focus effects. <BR>
- Darkhollow Constitutional will now return a normal cork, not the dissolving kind. <BR>
- Statuette of the Tranquil is now called "Amice of the Tranquil" and is a shoulder slot item. The AC has been increased and the avoidance has been replaced with accuracy. <BR>
- Woven Shadow Shroud is now called "Woven Shadow Stone" and is a range slot item. The item now has points in backstab damage. <BR>
- Razorsharp Shortsword is now not usable by berserkers. <BR>
- Dragon Scale Tiara is now named "Dragon Scale Eyepatch" <BR>

- Bard instruments will drop less frequently in the Demi-Plane of Blood and a maximum of once per kill. <BR>
- The Insidious Hooded Cloak now has its specialization modifier set to alteration instead of conjuration. <BR>

- The Sharpshooting VI spell effect on Soulseeker, Death's Sigh is now worn instead of combat. <BR>
- The Polished Chitin War Horn now has an augment slot. <BR>
- Ancient Cudgel of Slaughter now has resistance modifiers. <BR>
- Though it is still magnetic, a magnetic metal brick will no longer stick to your hands. <BR>
<BR>
*** Missions, Tasks & Quests *** <BR>
<BR>
- Adjusted the experience reward for monster missions to better reflect the amount of effort the mission requires. Missions that could be finished very quickly are now worth less experience and missions that are taking longer to complete are now worth more experience. <BR>
- High Seas Rogues have regained the ability to evade! <BR>
- All Drachnid Hive level 65 missions should now give out the appropriate one time rewards. <BR>
- Artisan Dosan Vis’Moor, Vivian Selgan, and Gart Okken should now be accepting items for the tasks that they give. <BR>
- Additional text has been added to the "Investigate a Disappearance" task that begins in Freeport that should help clear up a confusing spot late in the task. <BR>
- Aid Fimli in the Plane of Knowledge will now reward you with a cloak of lesser pernicity that matches the stats of the original cloak of greater pernicity. In addition the cloak of greater pernicity has been changed to be no drop. <BR>
- The Misty for You quest now works properly. <BR>
<BR>
*** UI *** <BR>
<BR>
- The GuildManagement window has a new tab "Information", which contains the MOTD fields, as well as two new fields for Guild web URL and Guild channel specification. These new fields are changeable by the Guild leader only. <BR>

- The Knight of the Dread Sun will now make his appearance more often. <BR>
- Fixed an issue in Dreadspire that could cause some of the residents of the crypt to aggro through the roof. <BR>
- Ogres will now be able to get the thread for their cultural armor without having to fight off guards. <BR>

<div id="main207" style="display:none;">
<br><ul>I got an email, with this information in it...<BR>
<BR>
<B>What were the thoughts behind the decision to retune the Depths of Darkhollow items?</B><BR>
<BR>
After DoD launched, we saw a lot of feedback from players that non-raid loot rewards weren’t appropriate for the difficulty of the content.  Carefully evaluating the cases players brought up led us to audit the model that has been used for itemization for several expansions now.<BR>
<BR>
The old itemization model was based around the top end single group gear being roughly 50% of the stats of top end raid level gear.  This worked fine when it was first implemented, but as stats have increased, so too has the gap between raiders and non-raiders.  Since content is tuned with player power in mind, this has caused a growing gap in the difficulty of expansion zones, in turn leading to the problems players have been reporting. <BR>
<BR>
After a lot of evaluation on the potential impact, we decided to change the itemization model to bring single group gear closer to the level of raid attainable gear.  Beyond providing more tangible upgrades in the expansion, this change should also have a number of positive effects on the game as a whole and is something we will continue to use when making items in the future.<BR>
<BR>
<B>How many items did you change?</B><BR>
<BR>
These changes affect roughly 1000 items from the Depths of Darkhollow expansion.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Does this retuning involve anything other than changing the items?</B><BR>
<BR>
Yes.  In addition to looking at many of the expansion items, we also took a look at the difficulty of the zones and missions and made adjustments to provide a smoother progression of difficulty through the expansion.  In many cases, lower level missions early in the expansion became a bit easier and higher level missions that are further into the expansion became a bit harder.<BR>
<BR>
<B>If we have previously done a DoD mission and deleted the one-time completion reward, will we be able to get it again after it is upgraded?</B><BR>
<BR>
Yes.  We changed the way the mission reward mechanic works so when you complete a mission it will now give you the completion reward again if you don't already have that item anywhere on your character (including in the bank).  This will allow players who have previously done the missions to return to those missions and get the items again.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Could you give a few examples of items that are being upgraded?</B><BR>
<BR>
Here are a few examples of items from different parts of the expansion.  They are fairly representative of the overall changes we are making.<BR>
