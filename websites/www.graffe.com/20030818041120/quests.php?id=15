  <font color="#CCCCCC">The Ice Comet Rune Quest starts by talking to Sulgar 
  within Everfrost. To find Sulgar, zone out of Blackburrow and head for the 
  North wall (loc +3033, -2393). He is standing next to two Barbarians. <i>If 
  you cannot interact with him, petition a GM to correct your beta-neutral 
  faction. If the GM will not help you, Merloc Kole of The Rathe says that all 
  parts of the Tishans Kilt Quest will up your beta-neutral faction.</i> </font>
  <p><font color="#CCCCCC">Also, you can try asking about 'Tarton Wheel' 
  (leaving off the apostrophe and the s in 'Tarton' and see if that helps) Once 
  you have the rods, go back to Sulgar and ask him for the chest <i>(Be sure to 
  get the chest last for it is a NO RENT item. Once you log out, the chest and 
  everything in it will disappear)</i> which you need to combine the rods. Upon 
  a successful combining of the rods, you make two items. One is the Staff of 
  the Wheel and the other is the </font>
  <a onclick="MM_openBrWindow('../../equipment/miscellaneous/star_of_eyes.jpg','starofeyes','width=330,height=145')" href="javascript:;">
  <font color="#CCCCCC">Star of Eyes</font></a><font color="#CCCCCC">. Either of 
  these items you can keep (many use the staff for it's intelligence bonus) or 
  return both to Sulgar in trade for the runes.</font></p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;The staffs can be found at the following locations.</p>
  <p>1. Azia- In Erud's crossing on the deep part of the ocean floor past the 
  shipwreck infested with undead, location -1162, +2340 (one user suggested 
  levitating to find the coordinates first, then diving for it). Use the best of 
  your shields, load your fades, shadow steps and gates. Acquiring this rod can 
  get ugly. Seems that 'Killer Sharks' (level 40) inhabit this area and make it 
  very difficult to acquire the rods. Some say the sharks see through invisible 
  and some say they cannot. - <b>you have been warned</b> - For even more help 
  on this rod, I suggest looking at this
  <a href="http://www.graffe.com/graffe1.0/quests/IceComet/erud_rod/azia.html" target="_blank">
  walkthru</a> and also reading this
  <a href="http://www.graffe.com/graffe1.0/quests/IceComet/Azia.zip">text file</a>.</p>
  <p>2. Beza- In Everfrost, within the underwater caves, it is in the &quot;house&quot; 
  all the way back and right in the cave, where three Ice boned skeletons guard 
  it in the center of the room. To find the hole in the ice that leads to the 
  underwater cave, goto +2420, -4060. You may or may not need enduring breath 
  for this swim depending on your swimming skill. Jump in the water and swim 
  North. Once you hit dry land inside the cave, keep right the whole way until 
  you reach the &quot;house&quot;. (mob info correction by Talisin Sa`Lidar)</p>
  <p>3. Caza- Lake Rathe, Underneath the first island you see is an underwater 
  tunnel leading to a stone tower, its on the top floor of the tower (need 
  enduring breath for this one). This is guarded by water goblins that may 
  attack unprovoked. Be careful for some say they can see through invisiblitly 
  also. - you have been warned - </p>
  <p>4. Dena- Dagnor's Cauldron, right outside the entrance to Kedge Keep. If 
  you face with your back to Kedge Keep, it is directly diagonal left, in a 
  corner. Loc -890, -740.</p>
  <p>5. Ena- Lower Guk in the Reanimated hand room. This one is the only one you 
  need a group for, unless you are brave and kamakaze it. Warning: depending on 
  how your video card / colors are set up, the floor may be the same color as 
  the rod in this room and it makes it very hard to find with the Hand and the 
  dar beating on you. </p>
  <p>6. Fana- Oasis is correct but the tower is underwater next to the above 
  ground tower, this one is on the top floor of the tower as well. This is 
  guarded by water goblins that may attack unprovoked. Be careful for some say 
  they can see through invisiblitly also. - you have been warned - </p>
  <p>7. Geza- Highpass Hold is correct, it is in the water near the waterfall 
  closest to the Tiger's Roar Inn, there are two waterfalls there, the rod is in 
  front of the one closest to the Inn.</p>
  <p>8. Heda- Erudin is wrong, it is within the Qeynos Aqueducts, in the shark 
  pit there. Some High Elves with the wrong faction may have to deal with an NPC 
  by the name of Riggin Vix, in which they may be KoS to.</p>
  <p>9. Izah- Neriak is correct, but it is in the water in front of the bar 
  called &quot;The Blind Fish&quot;. The bar has four glass windows that are underwater 
  and the rod spawns right in front of those windows. (If you do not know Neriak 
  or are not welcomed there, I suggest creating a newbie Dark Elf to get 
  familiar with the waterway area, the guards, and the location of the rod 
  before attempting to grab this one. There are MANY guards that patrol the 
  bridge area but you will be safe in the water - Graffë)</p>
  <p>10. Jaka- It is in Unrest but not near a mob that drops dwarven armor. It 
  is in the water outside to the right of the mansion. Near where the the Gnome 
  Spelunker is. Instead of going into the tunnel that leads to the Spelunker, 
  there is a very shallow tunnel that is to the right. Within that tunnel lies 
  the rod.</p>
  <p>The Runes of Frost and Astral are NO DROP items from the quest as is the 
  scroll they make.</p>
  <p>Statistics on the Star of Eyes: It is a jewel that can cast unlimited 
  identify spell.<br>
