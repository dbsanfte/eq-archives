<p align="center"><b>This is for Evil Aligned Races<br>
  </b></p>
<p>This quest is given by a Dark Elf named Dyth X`Teria in the Kunark lands of 
  'The Overthere'. He can be found in the docktown at +3137.13, +2266.10, -49.97. 
  He is inside a small stone building. The end result is the level 39 spell, Concussion.</p>
<hr noshade>
<p align="left">You say, 'hail Dyth X`Teria' </p>
<p>Dyth X`Teria appears to be the local master of wizadry. His garb clearly comes 
  from the dark city of Neriak it has an emblem of a black sun. Speak!! I am dispatched 
  from Neriak to this land by order of the king. I shall research [new spells] 
  and aid the adventuring wizards. My knowledge of wizardry is offered to all 
  in hopes of gaining information of Kunark. </p>
<p>You say, 'What new spells?'</p>
<p>Dyth X`Teria says 'Within this lost land could lay the knowledge of extinct 
  civilizations. I am ordered to seek this knowledge for the empire of Neriak. 
  So far all I have discovered is a way to harness a spell of my own design. I 
  call it, [Brain Bite]. </p>
<p> You say, 'what is brain bite?' </p>
<p>Dyth X`Teria says 'If you wish to own a copy of MY spell, Brain Bite. I would 
  be glad to give you one. All I ask is that you [gather a few souls] for me. 
</p>
<p>You say, 'I will gather a few souls' </p>
<p>Dyth X`Teria reveals three ornate bottles. While I finished my research of 
  Brain Bite, I encountered three [interlopers] who wished to steal my spell. 
  I had the Dragoon garrison track them down and dispatch them. Unfortunately, 
  I forgot to instruct them to trap their souls with these bottles. Do you want 
  to [take the bottles] and finish the job. </p>
<p>You say, 'who interlopers' </p>
<p>Dyth X`Teria says 'The garrison report was sloppy to say the least. They informed 
  me that Hampton was slain near ruins within a jungle infested with raptors. 
  Mardon was slain within an ancient city found deep in a jungle. Ryla was slain 
  in a hidden fortress guarded by fierce armored wolves who walked on their hind 
  legs. </p>
<p>You say, 'I will take the bottles.' </p>
<p>Dyth X`Teria says 'The bottles also require a gem. You will fetch me the three 
  gems and I will prepare the bottles and give them to you to finish the job. 
  I need an onyx, a peridot and a star rose quartz. </p>
<p align="center"><a href="#popdown" onClick="MM_showHideLayers('spoiler','','show');MM_showHideLayers('riddle','','hide')"><img src="spoiler.gif" width="130" height="27" border="0"></a></p>
<p>So far, this is all of the info that I have found out myself or has been submitted:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The beings that need to be found are called &quot;a human skeleton&quot;.</li>
  <li>To get the souls, do not kill the skeletons but try to hand them the correct 
    bottle (use Identify to find out which bottle is which).</li>
  <li>Some race/diety combinations are KoS (kill on sight) to the skeletons. If 
    you are KoS to the skeletons, you will need someone to charm them while you 
    hand them the correct bottle (charming can be done by an enchanter or a level 
    49+ necromancer with Cajole Undead). Once you hand the skeleton the bottle, 
    the skeleton will vanish and in your inventory will be a new bottle called 
    &quot;Bottle of Swirling Smoke&quot;. 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Hampton</b>: Found in the ruined city within Trakanon's Teeth. Location 
        is +270, -3800 (zone into TT from EJ and simply follow the left zone wall 
        the whole way). You do not need an enchanter on this leg of the quest. 
        If the 'a human skeleton' is not at the spawn point given, wait for it 
        to spawn. Someone may have killed it.</li>
      <li><b>Mardon</b>: Found in The City of Mist. Mardon is a level 40-45 wizard 
        and is aggro to everyone. The location of Mardon is +136.00, -641.00, 
        +76.97. This is upon the second floor of Mist and requires a key (or a 
        high level rogue with lockpick) to enter the locked chamber on the first 
        floor if you take the long way. Take a look at <a href="city_of_mist.jpg" target="_blank">this 
        map</a> created for the easiest and safest path to the 'a human skeleton' 
        without the need for a rogue. Another way is to set up camp near the waterfall/river 
        and then have someone who can sense undead try to target the human skeleton 
        when it spawns up in the corner tower room. A human skeleton in City of 
        Mist has many place holders. Ranging from Plague Bone Skeletons to Fog 
        Golems. Once they successfully target the human skeleton, have them swim 
        down into the water underneath and then taunt it. Taunting from this distance 
        will work since there is no z-axis (vertical) check.</li>
      <li><b>Ryla</b>: Found in <a href="karnors_castle3.jpg" target="_blank">Karnor's 
        Castle</a>. <b>** WARNING **</b> Be careful what you kill here! Killing 
        mobs that effect Venril Sathir will ruin your chances of finishing the 
        quest! Most large Drolvargs (guards) are apprehensive and will not attack 
        unless provoked. The smaller, Drolvarg Sentry's have the consider message 
        of 'scowl' and can be killed without fear of ruining your faction. Enter 
        the castle and go over the second bridge. Turn left and enter the courtyard. 
        Go up the curved staircase. You'll come across a Spectral Caller, a Sentry 
        and a pet. Go straight to the rail and turn right. Continue (East) to 
        first door on your right, then go downstairs and across the room to the 
        door. Go straight (East) to the end, turn right and go short way to the 
        opening on your right. Turn right and go to second cell on the right. 
        Voila! For an interesting way to get this bottle with a very low level 
        rogue, click <a href="rogue_ryla.htm">here</a>.</li>
    </ul>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Once you have all three bottled souls, return to Dyth X`Teria 
  in The Overthere outpost. Handing these three bottles to Dyth will result in 
  this:</p>
<p align="left">Dyth X`Teria says 'Only three souls shall get you my knowledge, 
  wizard. <br>
  Dyth X`Teria empties the bottles smoke into a very large glass urn filled with 
  similar swirling smoke. You think you hear the cries of a thousand tortured 
  souls. He then closes the urn and hands you a scroll. Here is your reward. It 
  will blast a foes brain and hopefully they may forget their hatred. </p>
<p align="left">Your faction standing with VenrilSathir got better</p>
