<HR>
Go to Loremaster Borannin, located in the Temple of Lore in Thurgadin. The temple is at -320, 720. To get there, when you enter Thurgadin and come in past the guarded walls and reach the city itself, turn left. Go past the bank, and when the path forks take the left branch down the slope. The impressive building with pillars all the way at the back is the Temple. Borannin is inside on the stage and off to one side. 
<HR>
<b>You say, "I wish to perform duties for the crown." </b>
<HR>
Loremaster Borannin says "Those eager to prove their loyalty to the Dain may do so by completing tasks that I have been commissioned to assign. If you wish to begin your service, return to me with four toes of our enemy, the Kromrif."
<HR>
Give Loremaster Borannin: 4 Frost Giant Toes <BR>
The toes drop off of any Frost Giants in Iceclad, East Wastes, Kael Drakkel, or Great Divide. You could also try buying them, since they are not No Drop.
<HR>
Loremaster Borannin says, "Ahh, well done! On behalf of the Dain I thank you for making a dent in the number of our sworn enemy. Please accept this as a token of our appreciation. It is trivial, I know, but if you are as loyal as you claim to be, it will increase in power over time. It just so happens I have a [task] to further demonstrate your loyalty, Verdandi."

<b>Second Shawl: Kromrif Heads </b>
<HR>
<b>You say, "what task?" </b>
<HR>
Loremaster Borannin says, "Every year the Dain replaces the trophies in his trophy room. There is a reward given for the best new trophy obtained. I intend to win this year and I will upgrade your prayer shawl for assisting me. Fill this box with ten Kromrif heads and bring me the combined contents along with the burlap shawl. I will submit the best one for the Dain's consideration."
[Receive: Preservationist's Box]
<HR>
Go get ten kromrif heads and put them in the box. Hit the combine button to make it into a "Preserved Kromrif Heads" and give it to Borannin. <BR>
The heads generally drop off of the same giants that drop the toes, with the exception that they do not drop in Kael. These are not No Drop so you can buy them also. 
<HR>
WARNING: The combined box of Preserved Kromrif Heads is NO RENT! If you combine the heads in the box and then camp (or go LD for more than half an hour) you will LOSE it. I recommend waiting to do the combine until you are standing right in front of Borannin, and *immediately* handing it to him. 
<HR>
Give to Borannin: Preserved Kromrif Heads & Burlap Coldain Prayer Shawl
<HR>
"Loremaster Borannin says, "Ahh, some fine specimens indeed, Verdandi. I will have the best of these mounted at once, wish me luck in the contest! Here is the Cloth Prayer Shawl of our people. Before I forget, the council has issued yet another [chore] for you to complete."
