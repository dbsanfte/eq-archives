  <p align="left">Go to Lcea Katta who lives in Katta Castellum and ask her 
  &quot;what arx key.&quot; She'll give you a jewel box and tell you to find Elnerick 
  Augustleaf. (Yes that's where we get the spell from).</p>
  <p align="left">Find Elnerick, also in the same zone and say &quot;I serve Katta.&quot; 
  He will ask you to get him four shards from Praesertums in Sanctus Seru. </p>
  <p align="left">This bit is a little tricky, they are fairly tough and you'll 
  certainly need to bring a small raid force with you. Kill the head of each 
  Praesertum and collect a shard from each. Return to Katta Castellum and give 
  Elnerick your four shards. </p>
  <p align="left">He will give you the Arx key which is needed to gain access to 
  Seru's room in addition to a seal. Put the seal and your runed earring in the 
  jewel box from Lcea and hand it back to her. She will give you the Signet 
  Earring of Veracity and the start of the last part of this quest.<font color="white" size="2" face="Microsoft Sans Serif"><br>
