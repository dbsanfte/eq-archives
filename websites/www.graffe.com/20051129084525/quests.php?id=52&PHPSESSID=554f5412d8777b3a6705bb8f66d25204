Acomar Lothwol says, 'The use of magic can be a taxing ordeal on the body, and quite often may leave you in a weakened state. Fortunately, I happen to know of a rather rejuvenating meal that will grant new power to your condition. If you are not familiar with the recipe for [Hobgoblin Surprise], I can tell you. What you must do is bring me some as well as your Planar Traveler's Manual. I hope you won't be long, for I am beginning to get quite hungry.'

<b>You say 'What hobgoblin surprise?". </b>
<HR>
Acomar Lothwol says, "Don't be put off by the name, it's actually quite tasty. To make Hobgoblin Surprise, get a pie tin, some bread, add some hobgoblin meat and brown gravy. Cook it in the oven and enjoy the results. Mmm mmm, it waters my mouth just thinking about it." 
<HR>
Hand in the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/recipe.html?recipe=2845">Hobgoblin Surprise</a> and your <a href="http://www.graffe.com/quests.php?id=30">Planar Traveler's Manual</a> to Acomar. 
<HR>
Acomar Lothwol says 'How delicious! You have done well here, I can't remember how long it's been since I've tasted a meal so fine. Take this book, it will certainly help you in your use of the magical arts. When you are ready, Cadelid Etord will give you your next lesson, so be sure to speak to him. Do not lose your book or else he may not appreciate you coming to class unprepared.'
