      Erud, Founder of Erudin, have been compiled in this place by myself for 
      the knowledge of all.</p>

      <h4 align="left">Journal Excerpt One</h4>
      <p align="left">The company with which I travel has reached the settlement 
      of Freeport, little more than a collection of tents and wooden huts 
      guarded by ruffians and crawling with brigands and men of a most 
      scrupulous nature. Despite the filth and seediness of the settlement, I 
      must admit there are wonders to be found here unlike any I have laid eyes 
      on in all of Antonica. Tradesman peddle these strange wares gathered from 
      across the Ocean of Tears on a continent said to be filled with lush 
      forests and strange humanoids, some of which are fairly hospitable to 
      visiting foreigners. I can only assume that we humans are as strange to 
      them as they are to us. My companions and I will attempt to charter 
      passage on one of the trading vessels as soon as we have secured the 
      necessary provisions for the journey.</p>
      <h4 align="left">Journal Excerpt Two</h4>
      <p align="left">Never have I dreamt of a body of water so vast as the 
      Ocean of Tears, although my home city of Qeynos rests against the western 
      coast of Antonica I have never voyaged upon ship for such great distances 
      and so far from any visible coastline. The traders that we have purchased 
      passage from recount tales of several islands that have been visible in 
      the distance through the ocean mist and fog. They spoke of an island of 
      elven women that slay any man who sets foot on their sacred shores, of 
      goblins that live in the shallows and underwater caverns, and of one-eyed 
      giants that hunt sharks like our fishermen hutn fish. There are even tales 
      of lost ships that haunt the ocean, manned by crews of the dead. How much 
      truth there is to any of the tales is questionable but if anything, they 
      make for entertaining stories to pass the time at sea.</p>
      <h4 align="left">Journal Excerpt Three</h4>
      <p align="left">The ship that carries my companions and I has docked on 
      the shore of a region called the Butcherblock Mountains. Apparently this 
      is the homeland of the Dwarves, a race of short, stocky, gruff, and hairy 
      people with a fondness for battle and beer. I'm afraid afraid I have not 
      much in common with these dwarven folk but the warriors of my company seem 
      to have taken a liking to them. There are none among us who speak their 
      language but a few of the dwarves that reside near the docks have learned 
      enough of our human tongue to answer basic questions we have presented to 
      them, and beneath their gruff and rugged mannerisms they seem to possess a 
      great deal of patience.</p>
      <h4 align="left">Journal Excerpt Four</h4>
      <p align="left">The dwarves have been kind enough to invite us to their 
      home city of Kaladim, a rather stuffy and cramped subterranean city built 
      into one of the taller mountains of the Butcherblock range. The most 
      impressive sight so far has been the enormous statue has has been carved 
      into the very side of the mountain. Apparently it is the visage of a great 
      dwarven king. Some of our company has taken a liking to the strong brews 
      of the Dwarves. I fear it may be the time to move on before their minds 
      get dulled by the intoxicating substances, and the oppressiveness of being 
      constantly surrounded by stone and the clatter of the mines echoing 
      through out the caverns is wearing on my sanity.</p>
      <h4 align="left">Journal Excerpt Five</h4>
      <p align="left">My company has left the dwarven capital of Kaladim and now 
      journeys into the deep forests of Faydark, home of the elves. We have had 
      the fortune of hiring a scout and translator for our journey into the 
      lands of the elves. It seems this odd individual, Tolsarian, is a 
      Half-Elf, I had heard of a union between an elf and human but have never 
      before actually the opportunity to meet one. I found Tolsarian to be a 
      very intelligent individual and he possessed a vast knowledge of the 
      Faydarks and its many inhabitants. Tolsarian spoke little however of his 
      heritage, he spoke of the humans and elves as if neither were his people, 
      and I sensed a deep sadness in his demeanor. Tolsarian's spirits did seem 
      to lift a bit when we reached the tree city of the wood elves, the 
      Fier'Dal I believe it was that Tolsarian called them, and were greeted by 
      an elven maiden that appeared before us as if she had stepped forth from 
      the very bark of a tree before us.</p>
      <h4 align="left">Journal Excerpt Six</h4>
      <p align="left">I've found my stay in the tree city of Kelethin much more 
      pleasing than my stay in the stifling halls of Kaladim. Some of my company 
      do not agree with my pleasure, they find the wine of the elves to be far 
      less enjoyable than the rich bres of the dwarves. These drunkards in my 
      company have such simple minds to base so much of their enjoyment off the 
      imbibing of intoxicating beverages. These Fier'Dal are a strange people, 
      even stranger to me than the dwarves. The dwarves are blunt of speech and 
      manner and their simple ways are easy for even the weakest minded of my 
      companions to understand. The Fier'Dal however are puzzling. I have no 
      doubt they are an intelligent people but they are uninterested in 
      scholastics and conventional knowledge. Instead these aptly named Wood 
      Elves are frivolous and mysterious, spending all their time sneaking about 
      the forests, caring for its wild beasts, and singing and dancing in their 
      tree top city. Their history and lore seems to be told mostly in folklore 
      and poetry, though they have a written language, which according to 
      Tolsarian, is shared with their relatives the High Elves. They are 
      however, a good people, and there is wisdom in their poetry and song.</p>
      <h4 align="left">Journal Excerpt Seven</h4>
      <p align="left">Our friend Tolsarian has led us from Kelethin deeper into 
      the Faydark to the High Elf, or Koada'Dal as they are called in their own 
      tongue, city of Felwithe. I must say compared to the tree city of Kelethin, 
      Felwithe is indeed a splended sight to behold. It's white walls and 
      palaces soaring high above the canopy of the forest. I am surprised to 
      find the Koada'Dal are much taller than their Fier'Dal relatives, their 
      complexion is much paler and their hair and eyes the colors of the stars 
      and skies instead of the earth and trees. We received a far less 
      hospitable welcome to the city of the High Elves than we had received in 
      Kelethin. The guards at the cities gate questioned Tolsarian for quite 
      some time and looked over each member of my company thoroughly before 
      admitting us within the outer walls. Once inside the city proper it became 
      apparent that while the Feir'Dal are wise, the Koada'Dal are the 
      intelligent branch of the elven family. I have beheld wonders in this city 
      beyond any I have imagined. In the northern quarter of the city is a tower 
      where the elven sorcerers study and store their magical tomes. If only I 
      could gain admittance to the tower and browse the texts myself.</p>
      <h4 align="left">Journal Excerpt Eight</h4>
      <p align="left">A member of my company has acquired a set of High Elven 
      tomes that he claims have come from the tower of the Keepers of the Art, 
      the name the Koada'Dal sorcerers have given to themselves. He has not 
      mentioned how the books came to be in his possession and I dare not ask 
      until we are far beyond the gates of this city. Tolsarian has agreed to 
      take us through the Faydark to the borders of the Steamfont Mountains, 
      home of the Gnomes, creatures of a distant relation to the dwarves of the 
      Butcherblock. I do not look forward to another stay in a subterranean city 
      but from what I heard of the gnomes, the discomfort may be rewarded with 
      knowledge pertaining to my interests. I am also eager to be away from the 
      condescending nature of the Koada'Dal, despite the magnificence of their 
      city and the wonders they possess. Some of my company find my reaction to 
      the demeanor of the high elves to be amusing but I do not share in their 
      humor.</p>
      <h4 align="left">Journal Excerpt Nine</h4>
      <p align="left">The Steamfont Mountains are unlike any mountain range I 
      have beheld. Great geysers jettison steam and scalding water into the air 
      and mist and fog blankets the ground and sky. Tolsarian has left our 
      company for the time being and will await our return at a small elven 
      outpost in the Faydark not far from the borders of Steamfont. I have begun 
      research to decipher the texts that were acquired in Felwithe but fear 
      that what few tomes I have brought with me on the journey are not 
      sufficient for proper study and I will not likely make much progress with 
      the elven texts until I am able to return to my study in Qeynos.</p>
      <h4 align="left">Journal Excerpt Ten</h4>
      <p align="left">My company and I have arrived and been welcomed in the 
      Gnomish city of Ak'Anon, and I must say, of all the things I have seen on 
      this journey the city of the gnomes is the most perplexing. The gnomes 
      seem to be equally adept at creating material marvels as well as magical 
      ones. There are contraptions here far more mechanically complex than those 
      built by any culture on Norrath, including the advanced human society from 
      which I hail. Unlike the high elves of Felwithe, the gnomes are eager to 
      show my companions and I the marvels they have created, and are far more 
      curious about our past, stories, and belongings than any other peoples we 
      have encountered here in Faydwer. I believe the gnomes attitude toward my 
      company will allow me to inquire about their magical practices and perhaps 
      even view the tomes they have catalogued in their sorcerers academy, the 
      Library Mechanamagica. </p>
      <h4 align="left">Journal Excerpt Eleven</h4>
      <p align="left">A gnome magician of the Eldrich Collective, the name given 
      to their arcant order, has allowed me entry to the Library Mechanamagica 
      and given me quick instruction on the basics of the gnome language. In 
      exchange for allowing the Eldrich Colletive to examine the elven tomes I 
      acquired in Felwithe they are giving me several copies of gnomish arcane 
      books containing theories and practical applications of the magical arts. 
      I am grateful that my journey has led me to the gnomish city despite my 
      original apprehension and assumption that they would be more similar to 
      their distant relatives the dwarves. It is apparent that the gnomes are 
      highly civilized and extremely intelligent, bit O fear tjeu are a bit too 
      trusting of outsiders and that congenial trait may one day cause them to 
      suffer. In a few days time my company and I shall once again meet up with 
      the half-breed Tolsarian and he shall escort us back through the Faydark 
      and Butcherblock Mountains to the docks so that we may charter passage on 
      a ship back to Antonica. That should give the dunkards among my companions 
      sufficient time to recover from their consumption of Gnomish Spirits. From 
      Freeport we shall charter another ship to carry us around the coastline of 
      Antonica and back to our homes in Qeynos. I am eager to return to my study 
      and learn all I can of these elven and gnomish arcane tomes I have 
      acquired.<br>
