  <p>Once again, go find Loremaster Borannin in the Thurgadin library (-303.00, 
    812.00).</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>You say, 'hail Loremaster Borannin'</p>
    <p>Loremaster Borannin says 'Greetings, Kenju , please be seated and hear 
      the Grand Historian, he is among the wisest of our people.</p>
    <p>You say, 'whats brewing'</p>
    <p>Loremaster Borannin says 'Ahh yes, good to see you again Kenju . I wish 
      it were under better circumstances that we meet today. For some time now 
      we have sent teams of our finest rogues to gather intelligence for the Dain. 
      Tanik Greskil is one of our best. He was recently sent into the heart of 
      Kael Drakkel on a very important mission and has not returned. He is now 
      long overdue, and fearing the worst, our wise council has asked me to dispatch 
      a rescue party to determine what has become of him and return him to safety. 
      I have decided to give you this opportunity to build upon the trust you 
      have earned from the council. Will you accept this mission? <br>
    </p>
    <p>You say, 'I accept the mission'</p>
    <p>Loremaster Borannin says 'The council will be pleased to hear of your acceptance, 
      Kenju . Scour the regions surrounding the city of the Giants. Discover what 
      happened to Tanik and, if possible, return him to Thurgadin. If you are 
      successful, remember to hand me your woven shawl. We seem to be running 
      low on them, but I must say Mordin has never had so much help in the kitchen. 
      Anyway, I will eagerly await word of your findings. Good luck, and may Brell 
      protect you.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Tanik can be found, Feign Death at the entrance to Kael Drakkal in<br>
    Eastern Wastes&#133; where you fall for 10,000 dmg&#133; </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>You say, 'hail Tanik Greskil'</p>
    <p>Tanik Greskil says 'Outlander! Thank Brell you've found me! I am the last 
      surviving member of my unit. Our mission was somehow compromised, the bloody 
      Kromrif knew just where to find us... I can't imagine how they knew. I was 
      barely able to escape with my life and wandered into a trap here. I am badly 
      hurt and need your help. </p>
    <p>You say, 'i will help'</p>
    <p>Tanik Greskil says 'Quickly, give me a <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('../../../equipment/miscellaneous/vial_of_velium_vapors.jpg','vialofveliumvapors','width=330,height=145')">vial 
      of Veluim Vapors</a> so I can return home, I am in desperate need of some 
      attention from our clerics. </p>
    <p>You say, 'what is velium vapors'</p>
    <p>Tanik Greskil says 'Drat! Are you telling me you don't have one with you? 
      Run back to Thurgadin at once and speak with Frundle, she can make you one. 
      I will do what I can to stay alive. I may need to move about a bit to keep 
      from being discovered. Hurry now outlander, you're my only hope. </p>
    <p>You say, 'hail Frundle Frenkler'</p>
    <p>You say, 'what velium vapors'</p>
    <p>Frundle Frenkler says 'Ahh, you come seeking my family recipe? After all 
      you've done for our people it's the least I can do. First you must fashion 
      a velium vial, then combine the vial with two small pieces of velium in 
      this jar. That's all there is to it. Please keep the recipe a secret. </p>
    <p><br>
      You say, 'what velium vial?'</p>
    <p>Frundle Frenkler says 'I'm no potter mind you, but if I remember correctly 
      it's a small brick of velium, three crystalline silks, and two glass shards. 
      Then you'll have to finish up by firing it in a kiln with a high quality 
      firing sheet. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The vial is trivial at lower skill than 130.</p>
  <p>Small piece of velium and small block of velium can be looted on Ry'Gorr 
    Minors in Crystal Caverns</p>
  <p>Crystalline Silk can be found on spiders in the same zone. So basicly, <br>
    Up to here, it's rather easy.</p>
  <p>Do not camp the spot where Tanik Greskil is&#133; because i did it, and got 
    <br>
    A message: You have been ambushed by frost giants! And two Komriff Death Squad 
    will spawn, and try to kill you. Which was the case for me.</p>
  <p>When you get Tanik Greskil to spawn again&#133; just hand him the vial</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Tanik Greskil says 'Thank you,Rassal . I shall be eternally grateful to 
      you. Should you ever require my assistance I pledge to you my aid. Please 
      deliver this to Borannin, it is imperative that he deliver this to the Dain 
      at once. Farewell for now outlander... </p>
    <p>You gain experience!!</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Then head back to Thurgadin and hand Boradinn the note and your old shawl, 
    for the new shawl.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> Loremaster Borannin says 'Words cannot express our gratitude for your 
      deeds outlander, you have saved a hero of our people from certain death. 
      Please accept this, the Fur-lined shawl, as a token of our sincere appreciation. 
      You are indeed among the most highly regarded Humans to set foot in Thurgadin. 
      The next time we meet be sure to ask me how to further advance your reputation 
      with the coldain. </p>
    <p>Your faction standing with Coldain got better<br>
      Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better<br>
      Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse<br>
      Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse<br>
      You gain experience!!</p>
