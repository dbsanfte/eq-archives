			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>This is it, the month with the most major new releases in the year. Please bear with me as I try to highlight, well, everything. :o<br />
<br />
The three biggest games this month are undoubtedly <b>Battlefield 4</b>, <b>Assassins Creed IV</b>, and <b>Batman: Arkham Origins</b>. All are known quantities, and everyone reading this likely already has an idea whether or not one of these is something they would be interested in. I am personally wary of franchise fatigue with the latter two. Batman is also getting sidescrolling beat-em up spinoffs on the Vita and 3DS. Rounding out the multiplatform games is a new <b>Lego</b> game (Marvel themed) and a new <b>Skylanders</b> game.<br />
<br />
The <b>PS3</b> continues it's end of generation domination a month before &quot;next&quot; next gen launches. <b>Beyond: Two Souls</b> is the big one, the next cinematic styled game from David Cage starring Ellen Page. This title has had several ups and downs ever since they announced it, cross your fingers if you are into this sort of thing. The platform is also getting a new budget adventure game in the style of Ico called <b>Rain</b>. You play as a boy (and possibly girl) spirit in a dreary world that is always raining. Objects, player characters, and enemies, can only be seen by the rain falling on where they are. Finally, a sequel to the original Disgaea is coming out, this time finally with a new HD art style. <b>Disgaea D2: A Brighter Darkness</b>.<br />
<br />
The <b>Wii U</b> has another decent month. The physical re-release of <b>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</b> comes out, if you didn't already download it last month, as well as a Sonic game with a fair amount of hype with a similar world platforming style as Mario Galaxy's. <b>Sonic: Lost World</b>, which is also getting a 3DS version.<br />
<br />
The <b>3DS</b> is getting an even bigger selection this month. <b>Pokemon X/Y</b> being the biggest, but it is also getting a new <b>Rune Factory</b>, a new <b>Etrian Odyssey</b>, and a new <b>Phoenix Wright</b> game.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So, here is a game I only tried out because I've heard it mentioned in several podcasts this week and I don't have access to Hearthstone. It's pretty fun and I wasted almost all of yesterday playing it. <br />
<br />
What it is: A turn based strategy rpg that you can play for free in your browser. Instead of being stat based, all the gear you equip gives you a different combination of cards to play in your deck. Each turn, you or the AI picks a card to play and that's how you perform all your actions. There are cards for attacking and moving, as well as various utility and buffs. It's a good system, although ideally I would have liked a little more planned strategy and rpg growth. It's just as luck based as you would expect in any card game where you don't draw the thing you want. I've had rounds where a character didn't get any attack cards at all.<br />
<br />
The thing I find most charming about it, and the reason why I tried it, is because of the tabletop rpg aesthetic. The playing field is a decorated mat on a table, the player characters and enemies are paper cutout figurines, etc. When you start an adventure module you open up an illustrated book detailing the story, but keep in mind the game is combat only. It isn't a fully fledged rpg.<br />
<br />
It also has multiplayer, which I wasn't going to try before the game encouraged me to do so by offering a reward if I do. It was pretty interesting. All players are more or less made equal, and the strategy at play outmatched the campaign if you like really tense matches.<br />
<br />
Having said all that, there a few things that I sense should be better, but you excuse it because it's free. Being free to play there are also microtransactions. This is completely sensible and they don't detract from the experience. You can buy new paper figurine art, you can get bonus loot in every chest, you can get bonus dungeons, etc. But everything you get for free, as far as I've played, is all you really need. The game also gives you free in game currency to get you to try the various optional features. I will say though, that if you do decide they deserve some of your money, that the prices for things are way too high. The most I would pay for something like this is $10, but $10 is the minimum buy in for currency, and the current package deal is $25.<br />
<br />
If you want more details you can read <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/09/17/wot-i-think-card-hunter/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this article</a>, although do keep in mind that they way oversell the thing. It is very fun, but no where near as nuanced or amazing as the writer makes you think it is after you read that.<br />

<br />
Steam Family Sharing allows close friends and family members to play one another's games while earning their own Steam achievements and saving their own game progress to the Steam cloud. It's all enabled by authorizing a shared computer.<br />
Request access...<br />
Sign up for the beta today<br />
<br />
Steam Family Sharing will soon be available in beta for a limited number of Steam users. To express your interest in beta participation, join the Family Sharing group.<br />
<br />
See a family member's installed game that you want to play? Send them a request to authorize the computer. Once authorized, the lender's library of Steam games become available for others on the machine to access, download and play.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Frequently Asked Questions<br />
I want to try this! How can I join the Family Sharing Beta?</b><br />
<br />
To express interest in beta participation, join the Family Sharing Group on the Steam community. The Family Sharing beta will begin in mid-September, when a thousand Steam accounts from this group will be granted access to share their Steam libraries. You’ll know you’ve been selected when you receive an email from Steam inviting you to try out the new feature.<br />
<br />
<b>How do I enable Family Sharing on my computer?</b><br />
<br />
Family Sharing is enabled in one of two ways: You can either locally enable sharing in Account Settings, with Family Sharing &amp; Devices, or remotely respond to a user’s Steam request to share your previously installed games via email.<br />
<br />
<b>Is there a limit to the number of devices I can authorize to share my Library?</b><br />
<br />
Yes. A Steam account may authorize Family Sharing on up to 10 devices at a given time.<br />
<br />
<b>Can I share specific games, or do I have to share my whole library?</b><br />
<br />
Libraries are shared and borrowed in their entirety.<br />
<br />
<b>Can all Steam games be shared with friends and family?</b><br />
<br />
No, due to technical limitations, some Steam games may be unavailable for sharing. For example, titles that require an additional third-party key, account, or subscription in order to play cannot be shared between accounts.<br />
<br />
<b>Can a friend and I share a library and both play at the same time?</b><br />
<br />
No, a shared library may only be accessed by one user at a time.<br />
<br />
<b>When I authorize a device to lend my library to others, do I limit my own ability to access and play my games?</b><br />
<br />
As the lender, you may always access and play your games at any time. If you decide to start playing when a friend is already playing one of your games, he/she will be given a few minutes to either purchase the game or quit playing.<br />
<br />
<b>Sometimes the games I’ve borrowed are unavailable for me to play. Why?</b><br />
<br />
Borrowed games are only available on devices that have been authorized by the lender. Borrowed games will be unavailable on even an authorized device when the lender’s library is currently in use on another computer.<br />
<br />
<b>Who owns and can access the DLC and in-game content associated with a borrowed title?</b><br />
<br />
A borrower will have access to the lender’s DLC, but borrowers may not purchase DLC for a base game they don't own. Any player may purchase, trade, earn, or otherwise acquire in-game content while playing a game, but in-game items cannot be shared between accounts. These items remain the property of the account that purchased or acquired them, whether borrowing or lending the base game.<br />
<br />
<b>Can region-restricted content be shared across regions?</b><br />
<br />
No, any region restrictions will remain in place when lending or borrowing content.<br />
<br />
<b>Will I be punished for any cheating or fraud conducted by other users while playing my games?</b><br />
<br />
Your Family Sharing privileges may be revoked if your library is used by borrowers to conduct cheating or fraud. We recommend you only authorize familiar computers you know to be secure.</div>
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>Seems like an idea I mentioned to Dale a few years ago, except for the whole &quot;only one user can access a library at a time&quot; limitation.<br />
It would make more sense if it were limited per-game.</div>
