<br />
My record is up now on bandcamp. Listening / streaming from the site itself is FREE, and downloads may be purchased in multiple formats for just $7 (or more). I made 3 sales yesterday, and I am hoping to beat that today. My goal is to make enough money from the bandcamp site downloads to pay for a limited edition pressing of the record on vinyl, by Christmas.<br />
<br />
If you have been following my musical journey over the last year or so, and have enjoyed my music, I recommend buying the complete record and burning it to disk. Rock n roll just sounds better in the car, or coming through a good stereo.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading!<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote class="blogcontent restore">*Completed the Operation Final Fury (Kha'ak) plot.<br />
-Had more problems with the captain-level battle, than I did the final battle!<br />
-Of course now my combat rank is Militant, up from Veteran.  Sigh.<br />
<br />
*Added chip plex to Circle of Labor and upgraded my ore/sil plex in Tkr's Deprivation to a full chip fab with 8 or 9 chip plants and a few other &quot;Hmm, I need those&quot; factories.<br />
-Still running from Barren Shores, Light Water<br />
-Just under 43k chips left to finish the last part of the Hub.<br />
-Even added a couple Chokaro using the Supply software.  My complexes are pulling in over 10 million an hour.  I can spare the cash.<br />
<br />
*Even though my Pirate rep must be pretty darn good right now, what with the Fuel/Weed plex in Avarice, I still get one- or two-off stupid pirates attacking my stations.  It seems like those f'ers bypass the shields and get right to hull damage, because by the time I notice (10, 15 minutes or less) the station's at 5% hull or less.<br />
And it's STILL hard to repair.<br />
<br />
*Upgraded my 'plex in Legend's Home to include a few more resource products to fill voids in the neighboring sectors.<br />
<br />
*Did a LOT of station build missions in Boron and Teladi territory<br />
<br />
*Set up a half dozen new wide-spanning LTs running Springblossoms.<br />
-I'll probably buy another half dozen and start getting a few UTs up and running again.</blockquote>

-Took 8-10 reloads for that part.<br />
<br />
*Completed the New Home plot.<br />
-Twisted Skies rocks.<br />
-Ended up reloading 7 or 8 times before I realized that the sector I was jumping into, with just the Ship Debris, was the right one.<br />
<br />
*60k microchips left to finish the Hub plot.  Gonna be a while.  I didn't do any new station construction for it.<br />
<br />
*Keep getting Pirates attacking my Avarice complex.  <br />
-It's rather annoying, because I don't get timely warnings about it and when I jump in, or when my in-sector patrols finally realize wtf is happening, the station they'd targeted has taken a buttload of damage - which I can't repair unless I use my repair laser.  Painful.<br />
<br />
*The mission tracking for this game really stinks.  Some missions instantly update you as to what to do.  Others, you actually need to check the mission window to find out, instead of a popup at the bottom.</blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote class="blogcontent restore">*Finished the second set of Hub gates.<br />
-Left my connection between Ore Belt and CBSE.<br />
-Second connection now goes between Barren Shores and Priest Refuge.<br />
-Teladianium delivery took me less than 24 hours, what with Teladianium foundries in Presidents' End, Trinity Sanctum, and one or two other places.<br />
-Ore took 2 full days and I never experienced a shortage<br />
-Nvidium I found a portion via war drops; the rest through some annoyed mobile mining.  I still don't have the knack of that.<br />
-Crystals took 3 and a half days.  I ended up buying a good portion of them with traders, since I couldn't figure out via either of the Complex calculators how to NOT make them a zero-sum product.  Ended up spending 480+ million on that.<br />
-Set up a <u><a href="http://www.altanetworks.com/x3/x3tcocc.html?factories=xtlf,Boron,L,2;bfcl,Boron,L,2;bgf,Boron,L,2;sim,Teladi,L,1,56;sim,Teladi,L,2,38;sim,Teladi,L,1,40;sim,Teladi,L,1,36;sim,Teladi,L,1,32;sim,Teladi,L,1,30;spp,Boron,XL,1,239&amp;race=2&amp;sector=99" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Silicon Wafer complex in Barren Shores</a></u> high off the ecliptic.  Will probably end up building a companion complex in either Cho's Defeat, Depths of Silence, Elena's Fortune, or Rhonkar's Trial.<br />
<br />
*Started and finished the Treasure Hunt plot.<br />
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px"><b>Spoiler</b> for <i>treasure hunt</i>: <input type="button" value="Show" style="width:45px;font-size:10px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onClick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != 'inline') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'inline'; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none';  this.value = 'Show'; }">
</div>
<div class="alt2" style="margin: 0px; padding: 6px; border: 1px inset;">
<div style="display: none;">
<br />
The step that has you go into X347 I initially figured &quot;whoa really? cake&quot; until the 25 drones appeared.  And me without missiles.  So I reloaded and filled up on Mosquitoes.  4 each from range = easy pops.<br />
The step that takes you into X101 though sucked.  I entered and, right at the gate is a J, a K, 6 Q, and more fighters than would fit in one radar screen.  So I hauled ass east, way OOS, and picked off the little fighters one by one, then ended up finding the target.<br />
Was scared for a few minutes after the final step because all Teladi and NMMC were red to me until I realized my FoF settings were borked from the one attack. 
</div>
</div>
</div><br />
<br />
*Picked up another Mammoth and 10 Mistral SF for storage/shuttling.<br />
<br />
*My unjoined &quot;complex&quot; of Wheat Farm, Cahoona Bakery, and SPP in Argon Prime is great for ST training, which I've been using to spread love and joy - okay, economic monopoly - throughout the eastern sectors.<br />
-I really need to get a few more into the central sectors also as well as focus some build station missions in the SE.<br />
<br />
*I finally realized why my sat/shield complex in Antigone Memorial  had a Soja Husk surplus - because I never -built- the frigging ASat factory!  So I finally delivered that and now there's even more traffic into the sector :)<br />
-I will probably be adding 2-3 more, as well as a NavSat, and maybe a few 1mj/5mj factories, depending on if the Complex Builder says I have room.<br />
-Then again, I have ore and silicon mines sitting and selling and with no CAG/CLS running product, so I might be able to swing that.<br />
-Also, it topped 1.5B credits, yes B for Billion, and I'd been frustrated with the CAG settings re: the secondary &quot;off shore&quot; account, and finally figured that out.  So now it steadily dumps credits into that account.<br />
<br />
*My spaceweed/fuel complex in Avarice is rocking the traffic lanes.  I might put another in the far SE US to try to drive economic rebuilding there.<br />
-It has made over 500M in 3 days.<br />
<br />
*Been hoarding Marines.<br />
-Outfitted all my TLs with Cargo Life Support, and all my M6 and M7, and pulled a bunch of my TPs out of CBSE, so that I can keep training them without overflow.<br />
<br />
*The only new major ship I &quot;absconded with&quot; was a Shrike, which I jumped to the Yaki SY in Senator's Badlands, until the Yaki took care of the &quot;recovery team&quot;.<br />
<br />
*Trying to figure out how best to sell goods that I collect via battles.  I keep weapons/needed goods, but when I end up with a couple thousand extra Carbo Cake, for example, I send my Mammoth3 up to Asteroid Belt, then use a couple Chokaro to &quot;Remote Best Sell.&quot;  I haven't figured out how to use CLS to sell these better as my current method is a lot of micromanagement.<br />
<br />
At this point, I can definitely say I've gotten my money's worth from the game - even if I'd paid full retail price!</blockquote>

-Sadly, the Xenon force that rolled in was just a few Ls and an M, followed by a single Q... the Skiron, Thresher, Aquilo, Heavy Centaur Prototype were a bit overkill.<br />
-Also, the Q kept going after my Elephant, so I hopped OOS and the fight was over instantly in my favor.  Yay.<br />
-I was hoping the Hub had better storage, but it's just like having an Equipment Dock in my own sector. :(  Is there any way, other than dozens of Mistral SFs with full cargo holds, that I can get a very very good storage station/area?<br />
<br />
*Ended up losing 6+ hours, a complex in the Unknown Sector at the far SE, and over 50k Teladianium delivery because I didn't get any messages that the rest of my TLs got squashed by a marauding pack of Xenon, so I went back to just after the unlock.<br />
-Chose to link Ore Belt and CBSE due to the upcoming 450k Ore delivery.  Ended up moving all of my unused TS to Rhonkar's Trial so that it'd be easier to upgrade and set them all for CLS use.<br />
-The Super Shipyards can hold over 400 ships of M3-M5, TS, TM, and TP class.  Man that was a laggy window.<br />
-I looked but couldn't find a better way to control groups of a specific type of ship than the default menus.  I ended up having to manually send dozens of traders all across the map, instead of &quot;Broadcast - TS - etc&quot;.  The most granular option is &quot;TS/TP&quot;.<br />
<br />
*Got to watch the Boron go apeshit on the Paranid in Contorted Dominion, and gathered about 400 units in various missiles.<br />
-Half tempted to set up a few more Chokaro and set them to &quot;Collect wares&quot; but then there's all the micromanagement of finding them somewhere to store it...<br />
<br />
*Been doing a lot more shipyard purchasing; ended up getting three Pleco with a good selection of marines.<br />
-Averaging about 15 new/used ships a session.  Up to 531 ships.<br />
-Today's unreturned abandoned ship haul included a Heavy Nemesis, Tiger, Dragon, Katana, Gannet, Ares, and a Heavy Centaur.<br />
-The Terrans are much less angry about me blowing up their single police ship; the Split really, -really- hate it when I do.<br />
-Saw the funniest thing.  One of my shipyard purchases - a Caiman SF - ended up going through Nyana's Hideout and got attacked by a wandering pack of Xenon (Q, a few Ls) and somehow ended up getting halfway across the sector to dock safely at a station with just under 50% hull!<br />
<br />
*New complex in Trinity Sanctum is feeding the Telad very nicely, if slowly, so I added a foundry to my complex in Presidents' End.<br />
-Was thinking of putting another Telad complex in Spring of Belief, because the stations down there are Telad dry too.<br />
-Also need to configure an Ore complex in Ore Belt and also to beef up my complex in PE with some ore mines.<br />
<br />
*I think I've finally figured out how to successfully start a CLS/CAG trader.  Still a lot of intricacies with them, though.<br />
-Tried setting one to sell off the extra Tractor beams I have - almost 100 - but I can't choose any Equipment Docks or Trading stations to take them.  Ended up shutting off the TB factory.<br />
<br />
*About 50% of my Mistrals have been replaced by Chokaros, which I've set to 3-jump overlapping areas, starting with Kingdom's End.<br />
-Unfortunately, my &quot;trade dominion&quot; only covers the quadrant east of Family Whi, and north of Senator's Badlands, and the Terran areas, so the south central, south eastern, and north western areas have really floundered.  Woops.</blockquote>

Very little is known of his early life, though some have speculated that he is in fact, a ‘walk in” from another time or dimension.<br />
<br />
Jones says he spent part of the 70&#8242;s and most of the 80&#8242;s studying with the best Guru’s on Americas West Coast where he dabbled in Scientology, spent a weekend locked in a hotel ballroom with Werner Erhard, and slept through “possibly hundreds” of sermons at the Crystal Cathedral in Orange County, CA.<br />
<br />
Tzakapotek Jones is the founder of the Church of Entertainment Hedonism; a non-religious cult based on the satirization of dead celebrities (also known as “celebritards”) the number “5&#8243; (or “X”) and <i>water</i>. Jones is the author of several works, including “Keys: An Occult History”, “Thee Apokotheria Esoteria”, numerous songs and poems, and the “Dark Faery: Bumblebee” series of children’s books.<br />
<br />
Jones was ordained by the Universal Life Church of Modesto California in 2002, holds a Doctorate in Universal Metaphysics, a Masters Degree in Solar Magick and an Associates Degree in Horticultural Science.  He is currently pursuing a Bachelors Degree in Physics and Philosophy, but progress is slow, as he is a complete slack-ass.<br />
<br />
Tzakapotek Jones writes and advocates for the “New Discordians for World War 5&#8243;, The “John X-Land Died for Your Sins Society” and The Penultimate Group.</blockquote>

And it's not that I'm even remotely interested in these girls - to be perfectly honest they may as well be a separate species to me as far as I'm concerned.  But wow, not that I'm complaining but it's amazing what a woman will change to keep her man from doing the whole midlife trade younger thing.  I'm thinking of maybe planning on getting a sports car in a few years ;)<br />
<br />
The other main point I've picked up from this summer term at Creighton?  At some point in my late 20s I decided that all college kids were clueless mouth-breathing morons who couldn't tell their asses from their elbows.  Except for me when I was in college, of course.<br />
<br />
I was wrong; there are some smart cookies wandering about.  Good for them.</blockquote>

You put a bunch of flowers somewhere and guess what's going to show up?  You do realize that some people (not me, thankfully) are frigging allergic to bee stings and will die for wont of a bacon cheeseburger?<br />
<br />
I'm sure it was some landscaper who submitted the article to <i>Drive-Through Windows Quarterly Magazine </i>and all, but certainly someone had to stop and think &quot;uh, won't a bunch of flowers at the same level as your typical sedan window and maybe 12 inches away going to attract bees&quot;?<br />
<br />
Sometimes I wonder if I'm the only human on the planet who's still capable of rational thought.</blockquote>

But I went in there today for a very simple request - I need two rolls of pennies for my vacation bible school class tonight.  There is no front desk, just some personal banker schmuck fresh out of college.  I tell him what I need and he tells me to go to the equivalent of a drive-through shoot complete with a tube, but inside the doggone lobby.<br />
<br />
I imagine the actual tellers live in caves under the bank or something.  Who knows.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, he was like &quot;just enter your account number, blah blah blah&quot;.  WTF I just want a roll of pennies.  &quot;Well we need your account number so we can track overages and things, so our tellers don't come up short&quot;.  Short a fucking DOLLAR?  I do not have an account with you guys.  You're a bank, I just want to exchange currency from one form to another.  Isn't that what banks do?????<br />
<br />
So now I have to rush to a freaking grocery store on my way to church to get a roll of pennies.  If Centris wants to be so insular that you have to have an open account to get fricking pennies then they shouldn't have access to any of my tax dollars for anything at all, up to and including deposit insurance on the accounts the do carry.</blockquote>

<br />
I feel like my heart is being ripped out. If I'm not good enough to do the basics of what I want to do then I just don't have anything left in life. I won't be able to continue school, financially or academically. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure what I'm going to do with my life then. I don't have the knowledge, certification, or skills to support myself, or pay back the debt I've already accrued...I can't even take care of myself. There's not much I'm good at anymore, and I look like a stupid idiot and a washed up loser no matter where I go. I don't have a place or a person to go back to, I just don't have anything left. I had to be on my own, and I guess I'm not good enough.</blockquote>
