Whizbang's Handbook for Young Wizards<br />
(Translated from the Gnomish)<br />
<br />
By Whizbang Dustyboots<br />
(Edition 1.05)<br />
<br />
I sit today in my hidden office in Ak'Anon's Library Mechanamagica, where once Meldrath the Malignant taught necromancy, now hidden by the Eldritch Collective by a simple (but effective) illusion. I have stocked the dusty shelves -- empty since Meldrath's departure -- with tomes I have collected: the Wizard Compilation of Graffë M'yrddin, the Necrognomicon of Morty Undercrypt and the latest edition of the Tinkering Compendium as edited by Kredal Cookiegnomie and Kritta Didymus, along with my Golden Gnomey award bookend. All of these books have been enlightening, and helped make me the gnome I am today, and it seemed to me that it was time to pass on what little I have learned on my travels through Norrath, Luclin and even the Planes of Power.<br />
<br />
(Note: Those of you who come to read my advice and take it in the spirit in which it is offered may skip the next paragraph, which is something of a regrettable necessity, as we live in a world -- or worlds -- where blowhards would challenge the credentials of any who would dare give advice to help others.)<br />
<br />
I am Whizbang Dustyboots, gnomish sorcerer of the third rank, Baron of the Dragonscale Hills, a Master of the Eldritch Collective and wielder of the Staff of the Four. I am the scourge of the Teir'Dal, death incarnate to the Kromzek and Kromriff, and I have brought low the dragons of Kunark. I carry the Flaming Sword of Xuzl at my hip, wear the Robe of Icicles upon my back and bear trophies wrested from the Accursed Temple of Cazic-Thule itself, whose name is dreadful to all who hear it. I have passed through the Halls of Testing and my footsteps have echoed in the corridors of the gods themselves. I have been bestowed some of the highest honors, both religious and military, by the Coldain dwarves, been given a title of nobility by the humans of Qeynos and my hand has laid low the very gods themselves. None can deny that I am one of the greatest linguists and explorers this age has seen. In my presence, the wise take heed and fools perish.<br />
<br />
Whew. I sure hope you all skipped that. It makes me feel a little icky to have to do that, but I don't really want to argue credentials when it comes to this advice again.<br />
<br />
This is intended to simply be a primer to the craft for young wizards, and not a complete guide -- Graffe's Wizard Compilation is the far superior resource for that. My only intent is to help young wizards get off on the right foot with the following advice and hints about their possible futures -- the Alternate Advancement abilities, for example, aren't something one needs to worry about until much later in life, but let's be honest: They're interesting to talk about and read about.<br />
<br />
And for those who are unhappy with the unabashed pro-gnomish bias of this document, I promise to use as many small words as possible.<br />
<br />
Without further ado, the Handbook for Young Wizards:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A WIZARD IS BORN<br />
<br />
a.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Race - When Solusek Ro, the god of wizardry, gave four staffs to his greatest wizardly worshippers in a recent age, two of them were humans (Arantir Karondor and Demunir Scry), one was Koad'Dal (Sylen Tyrn), and the last was gnomish (Gabstik Firepot). In our present age, the most famous (or more accurately, notorious) wizard is the Erudite Al'Kabor. Although it was the gnomish wizard, Ognit Eznertob, who first reopened access to Luclin (with help from the hapless Al'Kabor, who managed to strand himself there by leaping into the breach before Ognit's spells could be finalized), which had been cut off since the beginning of the Combine Empire civil war, it was the Teir'Dal sorcerers of the Tower of the Spurned who rent the boundaries of space and time asunder, allowing wizards to travel to and from that distance world with impunity.<br />
<br />
Even a child knows that great sorcerers have come from Ak'Anon, where exploration and discovery are core elements of our culture (indeed, rumors of our astronomers putting together a great firework to enable direct travel to Luclin resurface from time to time), but it is not alone in this honor. The high elves of the garden city of Felwithe work to reconstruct the awesome magics of Takish'Hiz, now lost beneath the Desert of Ro, although many of the original magics the elves created are used every day by wizards. The bustling (if unhygienic) cities of Freeport and Qeynos have produced teeming numbers of wizards, all the more ambitious for the brief lifespan those of their species are granted. The marble halls of the Erudin Palace -- and Al'Kabor's floating laboratory hovering above their justly famous library -- echo to the sounds of the wizardry of the Order of the Crimson Hands. Even the dim and deadly streets of Neriak, where the alleys issue forth both moans of pleasure and desperate pleadings for mercy, have been home to some of the greatest wizards of this age. (Do not be confused: While I am the sworn enemy of the dark elves, and am attacked without hesitation should my invisibility spells be penetrated, my contacts in the Leatherfoot Deputies have hinted at ambitious plans to assault Neriak in the coming decades, and I have been doing my part by collecting intelligence to be used in formulating such stratagems.)<br />
<br />
In short, while gnomes are clearly the greatest of all races on Norrath, any of the wizardly races can rise to comparable greatness, although they each have their own advantages, some of which will especially help younger wizards, but all of which balance out well before the time they earn the title of sorcerer. (Read your manual on basics like dark elf ultravision and other basic facts about races, please, as that information is beyond the intended scope of this guide.) Choose whichever race you like.<br />
<br />
b.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Religion<br />
<br />
i.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Roughly a third of wizards worship no deity. Our power draws upon the primal energies of the universe, not from the gods (although a few have inspired spells) and thus there is no overwhelming need to be anything other than agnostic. Agnosticism will allow you to avoid some of the religious strife that mars Norrath, but otherwise offers no real advantages.<br />
<br />
(I myself follow this path, having found the doctrines of the various organized religions too restricting in my restless youth, a fact that deeply concerns my wife, an itinerant high priestess of Brell Serilis.)<br />
<br />
ii.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp About another third of wizards follow the aforementioned Solusek Ro, the Burning Prince. His faith places an importance on power, particularly the unrestrained use thereof. Not only did he previously destroy the elvish homelands on Tunaria (now Antonica), reports from explorers of the Planes of Power say that he is even now working on a creature with which he intends to destroy Norrath utterly. Some of you may find this oddly charming for some reason.<br />
<br />
Worshippers of Solusek Ro can memorize and cast the rare Imbue Fire Opal spell (sold by the mysterious Zordak Ragefire, who moves through Nagafen's Lair freely) and wear jewelry using imbued fire opals as well as carry idols and golden idols decorated with them. These items greatly add to the intelligence and fire resistance of their users, although not beyond that which other wizards can obtain with other items. From a faction standpoint, worshippers of Solusek Ro are almost identical to agnostics, although they're KOS on the Plane of Growth and start off amiable in the Temple of Solusek Ro.<br />
<br />
(While the rapacious nature of Solusek Ro would be enough to alienate me by itself, his destruction of the Eldarr Forest by raising up the Lavastorm Mountains also dealt a fatal blow to the city of my forefathers, Klik'Anon, where only a hardy mining company now represents the gnomes who once lived there, before the coming of the kobolds, goblins and the dragon, Lord Nagafen. Worship the god who callously destroyed the city of  father's birth? I think not.)<br />
<br />
iii.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A final third of wizards worship deities that others of their race follow, including Brell Serilis, Tunare, Innoruuk, Karana and others.<br />
<br />
Most of these gods and goddesses have no real effect on the wizarding lives of those wizards who worship them, although Innoruuk has imbued sapphire items that compare favorably to Solusek Ro's, with Bertoxxulous lagging behind in third place with his imbued black sapphire items. Tunare also has a quest for devout evokers who visit the Plane of Growth. Wizards who worship Karana have their own quest that begins in the Jaggedpine Forest as well.<br />
<br />
(Neither listening to the sermons of Iony Gredlong as a child, nor the sometimes agitated concerns of my wife over the state of my soul were able to do what a somewhat tipsy discussion with Captain Njall of Thurgadin over the course of a long evening and many bottles was able to do: As I mellow with age, I find myself hoping that when I earn my final rest, Brell will find a seat for me at his table, despite the religious indifference of my youth. On a mission lately completed for the Coldain dwarves, I was exhorted to pray to Brell, and those prayers were answered in a most literal fashion, with a scrap of paper replete with divine guidance materializing before my very eyes. Conversion, I am told, is impossible for one of my age, but I remain optimistic.)<br />
<br />
c.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Starting Stats - The most common choice when allocating starting points is to dump as many as possible into Intelligence. While not required, this gives a young wizard as much innate mana as possible, and also helps spell-casting skills go up more quickly. After that, the remaining points can be placed anywhere, but the biggest advantages can be found in Strength, Stamina, Agility and Charisma, with Strength and Stamina being the overwhelmingly popular choices here. Dexterity is close to useless (well, there are rumors it makes us get critical hits with your innate crit skill, but this hasn't been definitively proven by any means) and Wisdom has no effect whatsoever, and points simply should not be placed there. Note that whatever your starting statistics, it is fairly easy to get any "bad" statistics up later on, especially Intelligence, which is one of the easiest statistics to raise in the game. No matter how badly someone may tell you that you "screwed up" your points allocation at the beginning, it really isn't that big of a deal.<br />
<br />
d.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Server Choice - It's unfortunate but true that this makes a difference for a young wizard. If you have no particular ties to a server, strongly consider making your new wizard on the youngest server possible. Fewer high end melee weapons will have trickled down into the hands of newbie melee types, and you won't have the humbling (to put it mildly) experience of having a warrior hit as hard as you do, without spending any mana. Things get better no matter what later on, but you'll likely want to group at least part of the time for most of your career, and being in a more balanced environment helps. While I don't play PVP, I'm told that wizards are also quite fearsome on the Zek servers, although know what you're getting into there.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp THE WIZARDING LIFE<br />
<br />
a.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Newbie Quests - At the time of this writing, all of the wizarding races but Erudites have newbie armor quests available in their home towns. While it is certainly possible to be twinked with better items, it's a rare young wizard who has better gear in all the available slots. At the very least, look into the quests for the slots where your gear is lacking. And gnomish wizards should think twice before turning down their initiate spellbooks, which are exceptionally nice items for the level, and which young wizards will likely carry well into their journeyman years. Erudites (and Qeynos native humans) should consider doing the Servant's Staff and Gloves of the Gatecaller quests in Erudin, although neither results in a spectacular item.<br />
<br />
b.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Melee - You're not a melee combatant, and if you forget that, you won't be any sort of combatant for long. Having said that, everyone runs out of mana sometime, and this is especially true of younger wizards. At those times, it's better to be able to hit your foe with SOMETHING than with nothing. Wizards have three main combat skills in which they can train: one handed blunt, two handed blunt and piercing. I strongly advice against the two handed route: Given the small amount of combat practice most young wizards receive, you'll likely only be really skilled with one form of combat (to the extent that wizards are ever skilled in combat). If you learn two handed blunt as your primary weapon skill, the time will come when you WILL want to equip two separate somethings in your primary and secondary hands. That will mean your primary hand then is holding a weapon that's NOT two handed blunt and you've just put yourself at a disadvantage. (And before you ask, no, there really aren't any two handed staffs that are better than having two separate items in each of your hands. Strange but true.) So, really, it's a question in my mind of whether you want to specialize in one handed blunt weapons or piercing weapons. Personally, I prefer a staff (all of the great staffs I'll outline below are one handed staffs) to a dagger, but it's really just a matter of preference. (It should also be noted that it's impossible to build up one's Defense and Dodge skills without having faced combat -- and it's better to learn these skills early on, when one has a chance of living through the lessons. Since you only can train in Dodge at level 22, you'll occasionally have to ignore conventional wisdom -- insert your own wry comment about conventional wisdom here -- and participate in melee comment even after it would inarguably be more efficient to sit down and meditate your mana back.)<br />
<br />
c.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Spellcasting Skills<br />
<br />
i.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The vast majority of your skills, and all of your basic spellcasting skills have a cap of (level x 5) + 5. Thus, at first level, your Evocation skill caps at 10. While it is somewhat tedious to practice your skills, especially at first, it is always worth maxing them out at each level, as soon as possible. (I myself used to fish while doing this, in order to make it less boring.) Your spells will fizzle less, and in combat, that can mean the difference between life and death. You ought to do this all the way through your career, but doing it to 100 at a minimum is probably sufficient for most skills.<br />
<br />
ii.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Do NOT ignore Conjuration. It's true, for 28 levels, this skill is nearly useless. But at level 29, you gain the ability to cast Minor Familiar, and it, like all its later cousins, is a giant mana hog and difficult to cast. Many wizards who neglected their Conjuration skill until they could cast the level 49 familiar (the first that helps the wizard regenerate mana faster) find themselves fizzling away whole bars of mana before being able to conjure up their familiar. While the level 29 familiar is only of minimal use, you will, without question, want the level 49, 54 and 60 familiars to be available. So put in that time with Halo of Light and Eye of Zomm (or Eye of Tallon or Flaming Sword of Xuzl) and get this skill up!<br />
<br />
iii.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At level 20, you get the ability to specialize in one spellcasting skill, which means you will use a great deal less mana casting spells of that sort and these spells have much less chance of fizzling. Specialize in Evocation, period. And remember to put a point in all of your Specialization skills and then cast Evocation spells until Specialize: Evocation goes over 51. The amount of mana you save in the long run will be huge.<br />
<br />
d.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Fine Art of Nuking<br />
<br />
i.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The craft of wizardry comes down to balancing two factors: mana usage and agro. Learn to do as much damage as you can without using too much mana or gaining too much agro, and you'll be on the way to becoming a great wizard.<br />
<br />
ii.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When soloing, it's quite simple: You get all the agro, so use as much mana as you need to live through it.<br />
<br />
iii.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When grouping -- and wizards make excellent group members, especially once they get Lesser Evacuate -- your goal is to (normally) let the tanks have agro, while you wait for your foe to be sufficiently distracted by them, and then cut loose. Done right, you can do a substantial amount of damage, and save the healers a great deal of mana.<br />
<br />
iv.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A simple rule of thumb is not to nuke in groups until 50 percent of the damage has been done to the target. Like most rules of thumb, this is a guideline to help you learn your craft. In time, you'll learn to be able to nuke much, much earlier (I typically begin when the target is at 80 percent health), but 50 percent is a good place to start learning.<br />
<br />
v.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You will screw up on the point above -- even at advanced levels and with years of experience under your belt. That's OK, you'll learn. Later on, you'll be able to quest the Concussion spell, which removes roughly the amount of agro you'd get for doing 300 points of damage with a nuke. In the meantime, if you screw up, DON'T take off running. You're an easier target to hit while running (seriously -- that big dress-wearing back is pretty easy to smack) and your tanks will have to work a lot harder to smack whatever's trying to kill you. Learn the discipline of standing there and taking your lumps for a moment before the tanks re-acquire agro.<br />
<br />
vi.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Make it a point to group as much as possible. It's easy to solo as a wizard, but you will absolutely not have the skills needed to be good in a group without grouping, especially the ability to know what other classes are capable of. You'll also find it harder to get a group when you want it if you don't have people around who've enjoyed grouping with you in the past -- this, of course, can become a vicious circle with the wizard in question soloing more, and making the problem even worse for later on; grouping early and often is the best solution to head off the problem here. When grouping, also take care to use roughly the same amount of mana as the healers in your group, assuming a group of roughly equal abilities and equipment, so as to keep needed meditation times roughly equal for the group. Also remember to keep a reserve of mana available whenever possible: bad things happen even to good wizards, and you'll want to be prepared.<br />
<br />
vii.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Don't go for the kill shot. This may seem counter-intuitive because, hey, who doesn't like seeing their name displayed as the great slayer of the monster? However, when a melee hits something with a sword, they're almost always ready to hit something with that sword again moments later, and if they do far more damage than is needed for the killing blow, it doesn't make a difference. For wizards, every bit of damage you do costs mana, and a kill shot almost invariably means some mana was spent on damage that more than killed your foe -- and was thus wasted and is unavailable for you to use on the next target. Just nuke until the foe is running (if you're in an environment where they do), and then sit down and meditate. When soloing, save mana by having a smaller secondary nuke memorized, with which one can use a smaller amount of mana to finish off an opponent.<br />
<br />
viii.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Use the right nuke for the right situation: Wizards have the ability to cast spells that use ice, fire and lightning to cause damage. A spell that does more damage but is less effective (or totally ineffective) against a given opponent is not the spell you want -- get used to swapping out spells based on the resistances of your opponents. There is a current mania for erasing older spells from one's spellbook, but always, always, always keep at least one high level spell of each type available. Certain nukes also have other effects, notably the ability to force a foe backwards or to simply interrupt their spells: To this day, Draught of Jiva remains one of my favorite spells, even though it is of limited utility in the Planes of Power.<br />
<br />
ix.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Fast damage is more important than big damage. Again, it is hard to compete with the visceral thrill of firing off a spell for enormous damage -- especially when greeted with a critical blast that causes jaws to drop in wonder -- but your goal is normally to demolish your enemy as quickly and safely as possible, not to show off. There will be times (especially once you've joined the ranks of the channelers) where memorizing a faster spell that does less damage per blast makes more sense than memorizing a beloved spell that can level mountains with a single incantation. Be open to this and don't resist adjusting as circumstances merit. (And, of course, there are also times where doing all your damage in one or two big shots is also important -- it all balances out.)<br />
<br />
x.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Wizards also have a limited proficiency with bolt spells, although it's not pursued beyond the apprentice years. These can do more damage than your direct damage spells, but the line of sight issues and attempting to fire upon a moving target complicate things slightly.<br />
<br />
xi.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Don't neglect your other spells: A nuke may be more viscerally pleasing than a stun spell, or simply using a root or one of our two area of effect snares to control your enemies, but it can make all the difference and doing so effectively and with assurance is the mark of a great wizard.<br />
<br />
xii.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Raiding for a wizard is very similar to their grouping role and we're one of the few caster classes who can say that. We're also one of the few where we have a greater effect in greater numbers, as opposed to classes that buff or debuff, where one or two can handle the entire load of an average raid just fine. You will be able to do tremendous amounts of damage on raids, where the targets typically have many more hit points than in experience groups, and once a main tank has acquired agro they (hopefully) will be very hard to taunt a foe off of. Situational spells like Hsagra's Wrath (Giant Bane) and Porlos' Fury (Dragon Bane) can be used in raids, and our 51+ Tears spells are fantastic in them as well (I cannot rave highly enough about how well Tears of Druzzil works in the Kael Drakkel arena, for instance, although I acknowledge that many wizards find them sometimes problematic in other milieu). Even on the least wizard-friendly servers, raiding guilds are always looking for wizards. Excel in this field, and you'll see as much of the game as you care to.<br />
<br />
e.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Dungeons - A class with the ability to root, snare, kill stuff FAST when there's an emergency, evacuate everyone to the safe spot when things go very wrong, and at worst bring back someone to rez the group after a wipe-out is tailor made for dungeons. Spend as much time in them as possible. The rewards, in terms of skills (it is quite impossible to learn what you're capable of when you never push yourself), experience and loot, are unbeatable. (It is also an unfortunate wizard who has never explored the haunted libraries of Kaesora, climbed the Tower of Frozen Shadows, plumbed the depths of the Crystal Caverns or explored the ruins of Lower Guk. But again, I skirt the boundaries of what document's intended purpose -- perhaps I will write a travelogue of "must see" locations visited in my travels one day as a companion volume to this one. Certainly I want the chance to wax eloquent about the pleasures of hunting willowisps amidst the tropical breezes of Erud's Crossing in my 12th season some day.)<br />
<br />
f.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Quad-Kiting - It's not one of my specialties (I prefer to single kite, honestly), but Bicrius has posted what is the premier guide for this style of soloing over at Graffe's Wizard Compilation. (<a href="http://www.Graffe.com/" target="_blank">www.Graffe.com/</a> and click on Forums and then Library.) Many wizards have used quadding as their way to lots of good soloing experience and a decent bit of change as well. Just remember that you're not playing a solo game and show other players the same courtesy you'd like themselves if you were in their shoes. Note that there is also a (much) more advanced variant open to those with the gear, mana and intestinal fortitude: swarm kiting. Utilizing SoW (or a fast horse), an Extended Range focus item and probably the epic staff's effect, wizards can round up a whole BUNCH of stuff, run to maximum range, and start firing pillar spells into it, racing off when they get too close (without Extended Range to give a moment's more casting time, this is close to impossible). Forget about snare, since you'll need the mana. As I said, I'm a single kiter, and this is far beyond my ability, but for advanced quadders, it's something to consider trying out.<br />
<br />
g.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp AoE Groups - They became wildly popular during the Luclin era, and the art of grouping one or two wizards, one or two enchanters, a healer and others together to lay waste to enemies in vast numbers became quite controversial at the same time. The basics: AoE grouping is possible (although more difficult) at a fairly low level (the second floor of the Tower of Frozen Shadows is a good place to learn) using the Point Blank AoE spells that radiate out of the casting wizard's body, hitting all available targets. Enchanters keep the foes locked down (hopefully) with an AoE stun, and everyone cycles their spells until their foes are dead. This becomes a practicality when a wizard is in their mid-50s and gets their second Jyll's AoE spell and is able to cycle these two spells back to back cheaply and quickly. As a rule, you want a hunting area that has as many similar targets as possible so they all die at once, although this isn't a strict necessity. Note that jerks have managed to give these groups a black eye with much of the public, including GMs. If you get into a conflict over what areas to pull, I strongly advise you to figure out a way to work it out before GMs show up, as you will almost certainly lose at that point, rightly or wrongly. Play nicely, and you can rake in lots of XP (although not nearly as much as the urban legends like to say) and what's more important, it's a LOT of fun. AoE tactics also work in some raids -- you haven't lived until you've burned down the Chardok Prince's retinue this way, for instance.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp PHAT LEWT<br />
<br />
a.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Three Staffs of Power<br />
<br />
i.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Staff of the Wheel - Seek out Sulgar in the Everfrost Peaks to begin this 10 part quest, which will take you all over the old world to complete and get your swimming skill up quite a bit. No combat is required for this quest, although some of the portions of Tarton's wheel are in quite dangerous environments. Nevertheless, this quest can be completed as early as level 20 by brave (and lucky) wizards and I myself completed this staff at level 31. This one handed staff has 10 intelligence among other characteristics, and many wizards bear it until they complete their epic quest for the Staff of the Four. Completing this quest is a rite of passage, and it signifies to many wizards that you are a serious member of their community -- most will be happy to give you advice along the way, in fact.<br />
<br />
ii.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Staff of Temperate Flux - Seek out Gardern in the Temple of Solusek Ro to begin this quest. It's difficult to explain what's so great about this staff, considered by many wizards to be their most prized possession, so take this on faith: While having an instant click effect (that works from inventory) that debuffs a foe by 6 points in fire and cold resistance doesn't seem like much, you will use this staff every day of your wizarding career once you have it. It's a range finder, a means to pull, and more. The quest is more difficult than the Staff of the Wheel quest, but much shorter. Many wizards manage to solo much of it outside the Solusek's Eye portion, although the quest is also a suitable challenge for a wizard's group in their 30s.<br />
<br />
iii.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Staff of the Four - Seek out Solomen in the Temple of Solusek Ro to begin this most important of quests. Wizards are blessed with an epic that retains its usefulness for all but the most elite of wizards (although the new level 63 spell Force Shield may end up diminishing its value somewhat). The quest is deceptively simple: Of the four great wizards blessed by Solusek Ro I mentioned earlier, only Arantir still lives. The other three wizards are dead, and their staffs are scattered. If you can recover them, and give them to Arantir, he will bundle them all together for delivery to Solomen, a historian of magic in the Temple of Solusek Ro, who will gift you with this amazing staff. Of course, none of the three staffs are ones you'll be able to retrieve solo, and while one is a guaranteed drop, the other two can sometimes frustrate and confound wizards trying to get them to drop. It's worth it, though: Not only does the staff have fantastic stats, its effect is a free 800 point rune (damage absorber) that also causes the wizard to regenerate mana 3 points more per tic (6 seconds) than otherwise.<br />
<br />
b.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Intelligence and Mana Items - You have no power that is not derived from your mana, and it's thus your most precious resource. There are lots of good mana calculators out there, but here are some simple rules: Below level 30, you probably want +mana items, not +INT items. After level 30, try to get to 200 Intelligence. After level 50, try to get to 255 Intelligence. After level 61, try to keep your Intelligence maxed out at whatever your level's cap is.<br />
<br />
c.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Focus Items - A relatively recent addition to the game, it's impossible to overstate the value of focus items to casters. For wizards, that especially means Improved Damage, Spell Casting Haste, Mana Preservation and Extended Range items. Load up on these as soon as you can, and try and stay current on them as you outgrow your older items (something that becomes difficult after you outgrow the level II foci). There are a series of relatively simple quests in the Plane of Knowledge for level II foci that I cannot recommend highly enough to young wizards, especially as most of the items required are droppable items from the old world, making them fairly easy to trade and obtain. After level 60, Improved Damage is harder to find, and for the most part is split into three Anger effects, one covering magic, fire and ice damage. In return for this inconvenience, they have a bigger modifier than Improved Damage items, so it balances out on the whole. Note that magicians have the ability to summon a whole line of focus items, although they're no rent -- make friends with them! Ask for their ring (spell haste), bracelet (improved damage) and earring (mana preservation) foci.<br />
<br />
d.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Crucible of Escape - Created by high level potters, this item (which can be used from inventory) has the same casting time and effect as Lesser Evacuate -- whisk your group to the "safe spot" in the zone and wipe all agro. This will save your life many, many times and even make travel easier when going certain places. Well worth the investment. If you're not using this from inventory, and are swapping it out, the Di'zok Escape Staff from Chardok actually casts a little bit faster, although you'll need to be in your late 50s for it to work. Personally, I think it's worth making room for in your main inventory slots for the crucible, but I've never been one to carry around more than four large bags at a time.<br />
<br />
e.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Journeyman's Boots - For a kiting wizard especially (and sooner or later, almost every wizard kites some), these boots are fantastic. They provide an instant click buff to make the user run 35 percent faster than normal (the same increase as a level 9 shaman's Spirit of Wolf buff), which is more than sufficient for most kiting, especially when using the level 29 or 51 Area of Effect snare spells as well. The Ancient Cyclops in the Southern Desert of Ro can be soloed by a wizard in their late 30s, although young wizards are advised to not bother scribing their fire spells for use on him, as he's totally immune. And prepare for a long, long, long wait on this camp. A slightly inferior (1.5 second casting time) alternative can be purchased from the gnomes of the Solusek Mining Company in Solusek's Eye, as well.<br />
<br />
f.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Right Click Nukes - For whatever reason, these are extremely rare in EverQuest. The most popular and best-known is Solist's Icy Wand. It's an exceptionally rare drop in Kurn's Tower, and often goes for truly ridiculous prices. It lets a wizard chain cast their level 8 nuke (useable at level 12) free of mana. This stops being very useful in the early 30s, but until then, it's pretty nice. Other right click nukes are the Vermillion Orb and Robe of Torrefecation, dropped by Velketor the Sorcerer in Velious. Both are no drop items you'll need a high level raid to get, but both can help considerably in cutting the amount of mana used by a wizard, as these can supplement bigger cast spells. There are a handful of other such items in the game, but they are either of very limited (or no) use, are insanely rare, or no longer drop. One of these limited use items is the Red Ceramic Band, made by high level potters and usually available for a small sum in the Bazaar: It's a right-clickable ring (that can be used from inventory) that does 6 points of damage with a 3 second casting time. If one doesn't yet have the Staff of Temperate Flux (which is attainable a little later than level 20, which is when the ring is useable), this ring can be used to cover some of the same functions the staff is useful for.<br />
<br />
g.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A Horse - Expensive, yes. A luxury, yes. An immense help, yes, yes, yes! Horses allow you to cast spells without effectively standing up, meaning that you're meditating the whole time (yes, even during casting) and that when you're done casting, your don't sit back down, meaning you don't attract any extra agro. Unless you only quad-kite (as some wizards do), at some point you'll group or raid outdoors, where horses can be used (this includes the Planes of Power). The ability to meditate without sitting down is a huge advantage, and it's difficult to imagine hunting successfully in, say, the Accursed Temple of Cazic-Thule, without one. Once you start fighting in these environments after level 51 or so, seriously consider purchasing a horse, even if it's the slowest old nag in the Bazaar's stable.<br />
<br />
h.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Flowing Thought Items - These items let you regenerate more mana per tic than usual, up to a total of +15 mana from worn items. Very few of these items are droppable, and most come from extremely high level zones. Nevertheless, they're very useful to have, and most wizards collect as many as they can, with the quested Earring of Solstice typically being the first acquired.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ALTERNATE ADVANCEMENT ABILITIES<br />
<br />
a.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Improved Natural Run Speed 3 - This effectively replaces jboots (33 percent improvement in run speed) and will save your life countless times. It's also a requirement to get into many AoE groups. I recommend doing this before level 55.<br />
<br />
b.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Harvest of Druzzil - In your 30s, you get the Harvest spell, which lets you draw mana out of the air every 10 minutes, and leaves you stunned for a brief period. This PoP AA skill, which you can unlock without having purchased any other AAs, works off its own hotkey button, draws in even more mana, and doesn't stun the wizard at all. This is quite simply a must-have if you're of the appropriate level.<br />
<br />
c.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Archetype Abilities - Those who have them love Spell Casting Mastery 3, Spell Casting Fury 3 and Spell Casting Subtlety 3. All are excellent paths on the road to obtaining the title of Master, with the extra crits (Spell Casting Fury) and major mana savings (Spell Casting Mastery) being the two most popular by far.<br />
<br />
d.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Class Abilities - While Strong Root is a big dud, Exodus, Improved Familiar and Nexus Gate are all quite popular. Exodus and Nexus Gate are instant casting, which will save your group (in the case of Exodus) or just you (in the case of Nexus Gate) many a time. Improved Familiar requires no mana to summon a familiar (a green drake) that has even more benefits than the already astoundingly good Greater Familiar.<br />
<br />
e.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Manaburn - First off, take all the stories about how this was abused with a grain of salt. When it was "fixed," the servers weren't flooded with new bard, warrior and paladin epics, which says it all, really. But while this was once a useful tool (in addition to being ripe for abuse), it's now more or less useless. Average damage from a full tank of mana is about 7,000 points of damage, irresistible, for 1 point of agro. And that sounds pretty good until you realize that it's about the same as three and a half Sunstrikes or four Ice Spears. Granted, it's irresistible, but on the other hand, it's also all of your mana. You also get very bad return on spending 12 AA points to get to Mental Clarity 3, where you can see much more help for your mana pool spending those points on, say, Spell Casting Mastery 3 instead. This is a niche ability now, and one unlikely to be very popular outside of PVP.<br />
<br />
f.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Call of Xuzl - Quite simply, this Planes of Power AA is a toy, but it's a GREAT toy. You can summon 2 (or 3 or 4) swords into existence for 45 seconds for no mana. You'll need line of sight (the ability will mysteriously fail otherwise with no message as to why), but otherwise, it's more or less free damage. Having said that, it's not MUCH damage, so don't buy this ability for that reason. On the other hand, it gets cheaper as you level up (the levels cost 3, 2 and 1 point respectively), so if you're inclined to play with toys, this is one that's hard to pass up.<br />
<br />
There it is; that's this edition of my primer for young wizards. For more detailed advice, visit <a href="http://www.Graffe.com/" target="_blank">www.Graffe.com/</a> and ask the wizards on the forum there for more detailed advice -- that's how I got my start, after all. Also feel free to contact me with questions in game, and I may well end up updating this document to cover areas that I missed. But experience is always the best teacher, so go out there and learn. Happy hunting!<br />

	<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" ><br /> &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quote:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr&gt;how exactly do you exactly do mana burn ect after u get the aa pts is there something u type in to trigger it or what? [/quote]<br />
<br />
when u have an aa skill that is activated, such as mana burn or improved familiar, you high light that aa kill in the window then there is a button called "hotkey". if you click this button u will get an icon of a square that will have a label of the name of whatever aa skill you just made a hotkey of. you can then place it in ur hotkey bank.<br />
<br />
there is also another way you can start aa skills. if you have the mana burn aa skill and type in "/alt activate 226" you will begin to cast mana burn. this is useful if you want to make a message in say raid chat that you are mana burning a target.<br />
<br />
theres a whole list of the various /alt activate commands on the &lt;a href="http://pub149.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showMessage?topicID=121.topic" target="top"&gt;dr00ds grove&lt;/a&gt;.<br />
<br />
hope i explained it well, im kinda sleepy but yet i cant fall asleep, sigh. <br /></font></p>
