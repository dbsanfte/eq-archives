<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">You say, 'Hail, Fienne Silverleaf' <br>
</font></b> <br>
Fienne Silverleaf nods briskly at you. 'You are welcome here. Have you had a 
chance to observe the [wildlife] yet?' <br>
<br>
<b><font color="#FFFFFF">You say, 'What wildlife?' </font></b> <br>
<br>
Fienne Silverleaf says 'There is a myriad of strange new creatures in this land, 
and all are quite interesting. There is one in particular that I cannot seem to 
decipher. I cannot ascertain what sort of creature they are precisely, we have 
been calling them stonemites. It is most disconcerting to a scientist such as 
myself. If you could catch me a few [specimens] it would be most appreciated.'
<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF"><b>You say, 'What specimens?' </b></font> <br>
<br>
Fienne Silverleaf says 'That is actually the majority of my problem. They have 
the most peculiar makeup. I have been unable to capture any alive, and their 
structure is very delicate. If you could continue attempting to get the pieces 
intact, it would be VERY helpful. I believe with the legs, shell, meat, and eye 
I should have enough material to make an astute analysis. I have a lovely string 
of pearls for your trouble.' <br>
<br>
<font color="#CCBBFF">
<i>.:: Intact stomemite shell, legs, eye and meat are a moderately rare drop off 
<br>
any stonemite in the zone. Make sure all four items are indeed &quot;intact&quot; before<br>
you 
hand them in, because non-intact parts also drop and are very similar to the 
intact parts.</i> ::.<br>
</font>
<br>
Fienne Silverleaf says 'Wonderful! I should be able to garner quite a bit of 
information with these specimens. Here are those pearls I mentioned.' <br>
