				COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -- A Colorado Springs family is part of one of the strangest cases in medical history.<br />
<br />
Dr. Paul Grabb, a pediatric brain surgeon, said he was surprised when he discovered a small foot growing inside the brain of 3-day-old Sam Esquibel.<br />
<br />
&quot;The foot literally popped out of the brain,&quot; Grabb told TheDenverChannel Wednesday.<br />
<br />
The appendage threatened the newborn's life.<br />
<br />
When Grabb performed the life-saving surgery at Memorial Hospital for Children in Colorado Springs, he was in for another surprise: he also found what appeared to be parts of an intestine in the folds of the infant's tiny brain, in addition to another developing foot, hand and thigh.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.thedenverchannel.com/health/18297954/detail.html#" target="_blank">Click here for a photo of the foot.</a> <b><i>Warning: graphic content.</i></b> <br />
<br />
&quot;I've never seen anything like it before,&quot; Grabb told the Colorado Springs Gazette. &quot;It looked like the breach delivery of a baby coming out of the brain.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam was delivered on Oct. 1, within hours of an ultrasound that showed what appeared to be a tumor developing in the brain of the fetus. Three days later, Grabb performed the surgery to remove it.<br />
<br />
The reason for the strange growth was not clear at first. It was thought to be a teratoma -- a congenital brain tumor composed of foreign tissue such as muscle, hair or teeth -- or a fetus in fetu, which is a developmental abnormality in which a fetal twin begins to form within the other.<br />
<br />
Grabb, the only pediatric brain surgeon in southern Colorado, said that the formal pathology report identified the mass as a teratoma because of how perfectly formed the structure was but there is a fine line between that and the fetus in fetu.<br />
<br />
&quot;So it's unclear if a fetal twin began to form within another,&quot; Grabb said.<br />
<br />
Grabb said he sees a teratoma once every few years but it doesn't compare to Sam's. Teratoma tumors do not usually grow as complex as a foot.<br />
<br />
&quot;You show those pictures to the most experienced pediatric neurosurgeons in the world, and they've never seen anything like it,&quot; Grabb told the Gazette. &quot;This is completely abnormal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grabb said neurologically, Sam is expected to do well. Sam's brain tumor can come back so he will be monitoring that in the months and years to come.<br />
<br />
<b>Mom Says Baby A Miracle</b><br />
<br />
Sam's mom, Tiffnie, told TheDenverChannel on Wednesday that her son is doing well but that she didn't want to appear on camera because she doesn't want to exploit her child and make him appear like a freak in the eyes of the world.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is our baby,&quot; Tiffnie explained, in tears.<br />
<br />
She said when she first talked to the Gazette, she thought the story would only appear in the small-town paper. But it has circled the globe and she is getting calls from national and international media outlets.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am so overwhelmed right now ... We've been bombarded with calls,&quot; Tiffnie said.<br />
<br />
DenverChannel.com Reporter Jane Slater held the infant with the baby blue eyes and round face and said &quot;he is the cutest baby I've ever seen.&quot; Sam's at a healthy weight -- as evidenced by his pudgy arms and legs -- which explains why family members call him the &quot;Michelin Man,&quot; Slater said.<br />
<br />
He was alert and happy, with a barely visible inch-long scar which stretched from his hairline to the top of his cheek.<br />
<br />
Sam is still recovering from the surgery and shows weakness on one side of his body and some trouble with higher-level eye functions. He is already undergoing rehabilitation.<br />
<br />
Tiffnie had said that her pregnancy was easy and there were no signs of complications until the ultrasound on Oct. 1. She and her husband had given up on the idea of having any children after years of trying and then Sam was conceived. Tiffnie said she doesn't mind driving to the hospital every week or month for Sam's MRI and blood checks, considering that he is healthy and happy.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a miracle,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, Grabb wonders about the possibilities for medical science.<br />
<br />
&quot;How does the body form complete extremities? Who is to say we can't grow a heart, leg or foot?&quot; Grabb asked the Denver Post earlier. &quot;This could show a window of what's possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's always impressive to see these sorts of things but it's not as unsual as you would think,&quot; said Dr. Rich Gustafson, with Cherry Creek Pediatrics. &quot;Teratomas can be found in abdomens or other parts of the body ... what made this case so unusual is how perfectly formed the foot was and being in the skull as well. Usually, it's a totally safe and benign tumor. Often, it gets picked up in adulthood but now with ultrasound, you're actually picking more up as they are getting fetal ultrasounds.&quot;

<br />
When I got out of the Navy I worked for the VA and helped vets get their benefits going.  I met a Navy vet who had some learning disabilities (he was medically discharged due to them).  His name was Luke and he was stoked that I was a Navy vet and would come talk to me all the time.  ALL THE TIME.  Being a little slow, he would start off a conversation the same way everytime.  How are you?  Hows your wife?  How are your dogs?  He remembered the names and everything.  He is the nicest guy you could ever meet.<br />
<br />
I was a CMIS major at the time and as I delved more and more into my core classes, the more and more I realized that the corporate world was all about money.  I thought I wanted to be all about the money.  I wanted that lifestyle.  Instead of taking it easy I felt I should manage precisely everything in my life.  I scheduled everything.  I read articles I didnt care about, watched TV shows I didnt care about.  I was very successful at internships at Monsanto to such a degree that I had a job waiting for me.  In a cubicle.  Living that life.  I realized that my patience with anything got shorter and shorter.  I hated my classes and it showed in my everyday life.  I was rude, cold and felt that if anything occured in my life without a specific purpose, it was a waste of time.  <br />
<br />
Luke came up to me about a year ago and started off, &quot;Hey man, how are you...&quot; and I replied, &quot;Luke, youre wasting my time.  Do you have something you want?&quot;  I might as well slapped him in the face.  I told my wife later that day I felt extremely fucking guilty for doing this.  She replied all you care about is money and how much youre gonna make and what you will do with it.  You act like that with everyone.  <br />
<br />
A couple months ago, I noticed I had blisters on my hand.  Then on the other hand.  Then they got to the point where my hands were always bloody and blistered.  A dermetologist asked me if I was stressed.  I didnt think I was.  Then I had trouble sleeping.  Then I really just started avoiding people.  Then I realized what I was doing.  <br />
<br />
I hate everything about what I go to school for.  I hate the corporate life and all that comes with it.  I hate money and I hate obsessing over it.  I hated my life.<br />
<br />
I decided to change everything.  It weighed on me hard on what to do with school.  Im 8 classes away from graduating.  8 classes away from starting off at 60K a year.  I had tears in my eyes because I was scared as I walked to the counselors office to change my major.  Then fate intervened.<br />
<br />
Outside the building was Luke, and he had finally made into a 4 year university.  He saw me and said, &quot;Hey man, how you doing? How is your wife and your dogs?&quot;  He remembered all their names.  If it wasnt a sign I was doing the right thing, then I dont know what is.  I felt guilty for so long for being rude to this guy when he has problems.  I walked into the counselors office with a smile and a coke, really.  I was thirsty.<br />
<br />
Now Im doing something I love.  My school has started a program to get a biology degree with a wildlife ceritification that the government recognizes.  So now Im a bio major, with an environmental science minor and business minor.  I love animals, I think most know that.  I cant wait to just make a living, spending time with things that really interest me.  If you go to wildlife.org you can see all the options available to me when Im done.  I feel like the sky is the limit.<br />
<br />
I have been pondering this move for the last week.  During this time, I began sleeping again, my hands have cleared up and Im generally the cheery guy I was.  <br />
<br />
Im happy!</div>

<br />
Warren, one of the most powerful religious leaders in the nation, has championed issues such as calling for the reduction of global poverty, human rights abuses, and the AIDS epidemic.<br />
<br />
But the founder of the Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California, has also adhered to socially conservative stances &#8212; including his opposition to gay marriage and abortion rights that puts him at odds with many in the Democratic Party, especially the party's most liberal wing.<br />

</div>I'm surprised no one has pointed out that in Obama's calculated move to the center, and direct courting of the Right, he's essentially just thrown the entire Progressive movement and Gay Rights community under the bus with his cabinet picks and inauguration pastor.  <br />

Do you guys have any idea whom you've elected? :p</div>

			<hr />
			
				<b>C</b> would be <b>Judaism</b> - it's old and restrictive, but most of the world is familiar with its laws and respects them. The catch is, you can't convert into it - you're either into it from the start, or you will think that it's insanity. Also, when things go wrong, many people are willing to blame the problems of the world on it.<br />
<br />
<b>Java</b> would be <b>Fundamentalist Christianity</b> - it's theoretically based on C, but it voids so many of the old laws that it doesn't feel like the original at all. Instead, it adds its own set of rigid rules, which its followers believe to be far superior to the original. Not only are they certain that it's the best language in the world, but they're willing to burn those who disagree at the stake.<br />
<br />
<b>PHP</b> would be <b>Cafeteria Christianity</b> - Fights with Java for the web market. It draws a few concepts from C and Java, but only those that it really likes. Maybe it's not as coherent as other languages, but at least it leaves you with much more freedom and ostensibly keeps the core idea of the whole thing. Also, the whole concept of &quot;goto hell&quot; was abandoned.<br />
<b><br />
C++</b> would be <b>Islam</b> - It takes C and not only keeps all its laws, but adds a very complex new set of laws on top of it. It's so versatile that it can be used to be the foundation of anything, from great atrocities to beautiful works of art. Its followers are convinced that it is the ultimate universal language, and may be angered by those who disagree. Also, if you insult it or its founder, you'll probably be threatened with death by more radical followers.<br />
<b><br />
C#</b> would be <b>Mormonism</b> - At first glance, it's the same as Java, but at a closer look you realize that it's controlled by a single corporation (which many Java followers believe to be evil), and that many theological concepts are quite different. You suspect that it'd probably be nice, if only all the followers of Java wouldn't discriminate so much against you for following it.<br />
<b><br />
Lisp</b> would be <b>Zen Buddhism</b> - There is no syntax, there is no centralization of dogma, there are no deities to worship. The entire universe is there at your reach - if only you are enlightened enough to grasp it. Some say that it's not a language at all; others say that it's the only language that makes sense.<br />
<b><br />
Haskell</b> would be <b>Taoism</b> - It is so different from other languages that many people don't understand how can anyone use it to produce anything useful. Its followers believe that it's the true path to wisdom, but that wisdom is beyond the grasp of most mortals.<br />
<br />
<b>Erlang </b>would be <b>Hinduism</b> - It's another strange language that doesn't look like it could be used for anything, but unlike most other modern languages, it's built around the concept of multiple simultaneous deities.<br />
<br />
<b>Perl</b> would be <b>Voodoo</b> - An incomprehensible series of arcane incantations that involve the blood of goats and permanently corrupt your soul. Often used when your boss requires you to do an urgent task at 21:00 on friday night.<br />
<br />
<b>Lua</b> would be <b>Wicca</b> - A pantheistic language that can easily be adapted for different cultures and locations. Its code is very liberal, and allows for the use of techniques that might be described as magical by those used to more traditional languages. It has a strong connection to the moon.<br />
<br />
<b>Ruby </b>would be <b>Neo-Paganism</b> - A mixture of different languages and ideas that was beaten together into something that might be identified as a language. Its adherents are growing fast, and although most people look at them suspiciously, they are mostly well-meaning people with no intention of harming anyone.<br />
<br />
<b>Python</b> would be <b>Humanism</b>: It's simple, unrestrictive, and all you need to follow it is common sense. Many of the followers claim to feel relieved from all the burden imposed by other languages, and that they have rediscovered the joy of programming. There are some who say that it is a form of pseudo-code.<br />
<br />
<b>COBOL</b> would be <b>Ancient Paganism</b> - There was once a time when it ruled over a vast region and was important, but nowadays it's almost dead, for the good of us all. Although many were scarred by the rituals demanded by its deities, there are some who insist on keeping it alive even today.<br />
<br />
<b>APL</b> would be <b>Scientology</b> - There are many people who claim to follow it, but you've always suspected that it's a huge and elaborate prank that got out of control.<br />
<br />
<b>LOLCODE</b> would be <b>Pastafarianism</b> - An esoteric, Internet-born belief that nobody really takes seriously, despite all the efforts to develop and spread it.<br />
<br />
<b>Visual Basic</b> would be <b>Satanism </b>- Except that you don't REALLY need to sell your soul to be a Satanist...

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I read a study on agoraphobia recently and was fascinated by it. Most of you know that I enjoy writing, despite my lack of skill in the art, so I decided to write a few short stories about a guy with Agoraphobia. This is still a bit rough but here is the first one called, &quot;Bulbous&quot;. It is just a fun little exercise that I thought I would share.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Everything appears as though it always has been. The bike is in the center giving it the most honest shape. That has always surprised me considering that my only experience of it is through two panes of glass. The color was still charcoal gray. The chain was still missing and strewn on the faded blue floor of the deck. It is hard to make out, but it looks to be in the exact same position that it has been for the last few months. I have mused that the chain nearly resembles a menacing snake. Thank the lord that it hasn't moved in a while or else I might be convinced that it is indeed a cobra imitating a bike chain and waiting for me to crack the door, being the perfect opportunity to strike.<br />
<br />
If it wasn't the bike, then what was that noise? It sounded like three quick knocks in close succession. It would have been relieving to just see the bike tipped over. Although, then what would have cause it to fall?<br />
<br />
The small, red gas can is still on top of the cooler. It is, as usual, turned to the side a bit so that it and the cooler are not resting in a parallel fashion. I am sure that the observed position is not that of optic distortion. The can and the cooler are farther from the center of the image, making them appear out of correct shape. Yet, the change is minimal. I know from past experience what similar gas cans and coolers look like. I have wondered for a while now what caused them to not be resting a more aesthetically pleasing manner. It didn't bother me much these days because they clearly weren't a threat to my safety. <br />
<br />
Although, that could be my eventual undoing. What if they were placed there in a hurry by an eventual arson when I wasn't looking? He would certainly know that window of opportunity for secrecy would be slim. He would have to place the cooler and gas out front as quickly as possible and then scurry away before I could observe his activities and call the authority. Then, later down the road when I am in a lull of security, he would return to torch my house with me still being inside. It is a genius plan, but I am already prepared for it. <br />
<br />
No, the source of the noise is not the cooler or the gas can. I don't see the form of a mask villain anywhere.<br />
<br />
The white railing and overhang look normal despite their slowly changing color betrays the need for a good wash. They don't appear to be falling down or anything. They are a little harder to see because the glass isn't perfect enough for an accurate picture. I don't think that the intent by the manufacturers was to create a completely optical sound product. Most people just needed the general gist. Unfortunately, it is that complacent attitude that leads people toward an early demise. I refuse to be one of those people. I am smarter than that. They are sheep unwilling to take a peek into the woods for the pack of wolves hiding in the shadows.<br />
<br />
Everything else that I can see can only be described as fuzzy. I often wish that there wasn't another door between me and the outside world. Yet, I know that it is a necessity for extra protection. I am just glad that there is a large window through which that I can keep a lookout.<br />
<br />
There appears to be what I can only guess to be an arm of a chair. For a few weeks, I thought it was a bench and then later a part of an artist easel, but I have resigned to the idea that it is most likely a chair. It's position hasn't changed. It seems as though it always does. <br />
<br />
I think there is also another cooler out there next to a trash bag, but I can't be sure. I have looked at it for hours but have not gotten any closer to a definitive answer. There is still only about an inch of it in view.<br />
<br />
If everything is the way it always has been, then the noise must be more nefarious in nature. <br />
<br />
Could it be a killer waiting to break down my door when I turn around?<br />
<br />
What if it was the front foundation of my house buckling before it crashed down on top of my head?<br />
<br />
I know that it could be John. He doesn't come storming in to his apartment until he gets off work after five. I know that it can't be muffin, his dog, romping around outside because he is always tucked away safely in John's place until he gets home. <br />
<br />
What could it be?<br />
<br />
Will it finally be the end of Greg Sandford? Am I finally going to join the rest of my family in heaven or hell, if they even exist?<br />
<br />
Wait. I saw something! It was only for a split second. Damn you, Greg, for not paying closer attention. That could have been your opportunity to come up with a plan.<br />
<br />
There it was again! Again, it was to the bottom left of my vision close to the ground. I could have sworn it looked hairy. Is it some sort of a beast trying to claw it's way into my house? It looks a bit cold outside. Maybe it is someone laying on the porch wearing a toboggan with a ball on the top that I see people wearing on TV. Although, that would be strange attire for a crazed psychopath to be wearing before he gutted me. Then again, who am I to judge what the crazy wear. That is what makes them essentially insane, right?<br />
<br />
I guess that I better be starting to say my prayers because this is clearly the end. I didn't expect to go out this way. I wish that it was more graceful though. My heart is beating out of my chest and I may have bruises underneath my eye from pressing it hardly against the hole. The coroner will be baffled by the small, circular bruise around my eye. Oh well. It is not like I will have to worry about my vanity in such a situation.<br />
<br />
I can see it clearly now. It is certainly not a hat and it looks too small to be a menacing beast. What spawn of Satan is attacking me? Oddly enough, it seems to be bouncing up and down  and is curved slightly. The hair seems more what someone would describe as fuzzy as opposed to hairy. Could it be that I am being tortured by a fuzzy demon spawn?<br />
<br />
It disappeared again! When will it just stop torturing my emotions and get it over with? What did I do to deserve this? Had I no lived a pious enough life?<br />
<br />
This horrendous event is starting to take it's toll on me. My shirt is drenched with sweat and my head is beginning to ache more strongly. If this goes on much longer, the demon will have no choice to spare me. Even the ruler of the underworld himself would not want someone in such a condition. If only he would come here and negotiate my surrender. Then I wouldn't have to endure this torment any longer.<br />
<br />
There it is!<br />
<br />
I can see it clearly now.<br />
<br />
Thank god that It is just a squirrel.</div>

The watch was discovered by scientists making a documentary, reports ananova.com website.<br />
<br />
The out-of-time piece of jewellery was pressed into the soil covering one of the coffins.<br />
<br />
The watch is stopped at 10:06, and there is the word “Swiss” on its back.<br />
<br />
Work at the archaeological site has been suspended and experts from Beijing have been called in to help solve this mystery, which appears to belong in a sci-fi flick.</div>

&quot;We found the lost river on the anniverary of my first wife! Ah, I miss her cooking, but not her tongue, I am though, missing the sweet body of my third wife on this long voyage, but she doesn't like crocodiles much.<br />
<br />
My long suspicions of a hidden tributory river proved true, but it fed into the Koggo river from an underwater <br />
<br />
passage, which is why I could never find the blasted thing.<br />
The sorceror who leads this group had an ancient map of bronze tablets, and using the sorceror's magic, we flew over the cliff that seperated these rivers.<br />
<br />
It was not a tributory, but a massive river all of it's own! It's deep in a winding canyon of massive cliffs.<br />
many strange and terrible beasts are here, some familiar, but larger than usual as well.<br />
<br />
I have seen dragonflies long as aman's arm, but not as long AS a man, before!<br />
<br />
Oddly, we came across a hut and canoe, long abandoned...which is strange, surely floods would have swept the canoe <br />
<br />
away?<br />
We have seen no other sign of people, as yet.<br />

We continue on....&quot;

updated 5:34 p.m. PT, Tues., Dec. 16, 2008<br />
<br />
EASTON, Pa. - The father of 3-year-old Adolf Hitler Campbell, whose request for a birthday cake with the child's full name on it was rejected by a New Jersey supermarket, is asking for a little tolerance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heath Campbell and his wife, Deborah, are upset not only with the decision made by the nearby ShopRite, but also with an outpouring of angry Internet postings in response to a local newspaper article about the cake.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heath Campbell, who is 35, said in an interview Tuesday that people should look forward, not back, and accept change.<br />
&quot;They need to accept a name. A name's a name. The kid isn't going to grow up and do what (Hitler) did,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
<br />
After ShopRite refused the request for the cake as inappropriate, the Campbells got a cake decorated at a Wal-Mart in Pennsylvania, Deborah Campbell said.<br />
<br />
<br />
About 12 people attended the birthday party on Sunday, according to Heath Campbell.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Campbells' other two children also have unusual names: JoyceLynn Aryan Nation Campbell turns 2 in a few months and Honszlynn Hinler Jeannie Campbell will be 1 in April.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heath Campbell said he named his son after Adolf Hitler because he liked the name and because &quot;no one else in the world would have that name.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Campbell said his ancestors are German and that he has lived all his life in Hunterdon County, New Jersey, which is across the Delaware River from Easton.<br />
