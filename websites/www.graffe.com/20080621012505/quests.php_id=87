Zauvudd Gigoth says 'This is good. One of the most important aspects to your battle readiness is your strong willpower and bravery. Years ago I discovered a particular concoction that will very readily put your willpower to the test. Unfortunately I ran out not too long ago and I am in need of some more [Planar Blood Brew]. If you can make some more for my students, it would certainly look favorably upon you in your future teachings. Bring me some along with your Planar Traveler's Manual.'
