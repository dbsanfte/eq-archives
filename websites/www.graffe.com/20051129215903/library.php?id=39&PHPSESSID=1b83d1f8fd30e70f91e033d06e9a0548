    Minimum Level: 34<br>
    Maximum Level: 43<br>
    Zone Name: Iceclad<br>
    Camp Area/LOC: By the Eastern Wastes Dragon Bridge<br>
    Mob List (HP): Dire Wolves, Snow Dervishes<br>
    Availability (1->10): 9 (I’ve only "competed" for quads once)<br>
    Loot Ranking (1->10): 1<br>
    Diff.Ranking (1->10): 2 (easy quadding, only real problem is pulling if 
    you've got bad giant faction)<br>
    Faction Affected: None<br>
    <br>
    Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: I learned to quad here, and made it my home from 
    35 to 42. The southwestern side of the EW Bridge island is fairly flat and 
    free of trees, which lets you learn how to wrap pretty well. Just don't get 
    spoiled on the vast, wide-open spaces! There are some nice ice floes way 
    down south you can sit and med on (and practice your fishing, too.) Just 
    don't annoy any turtles you see spinning around down there.<br>
    <br>
    You may have difficulty with your first few pulls if you've already 
    tarnished your giant faction; roaming Frost Giant Scouts will force you to 
    weave and bob as you try to snag that fourth Dire Wolf. JBoots or some form 
    of SoW a must. Just remember that safety is just over that bridge!<br>
    <br>
    Beware of the Dire Wolf Stalker, a higher-level wolf than the others that 
    can throw off your quad, and a pack of Kromrif tracking wolves (who appear 
    by the bridge when someone's doing the eighth shawl quest), which will be 
    very, very red to you.<br>
