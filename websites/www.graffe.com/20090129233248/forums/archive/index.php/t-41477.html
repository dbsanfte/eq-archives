<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Axxl 01</div><div class="date">June 21st, 2006, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been thinking about playing this game for a while.  But before I consider  diving into another online game, I've been reading various opinions about the game on various boards.  So to flesh out some lingering questions I have about the game, I decided to ask here since I remember reading some people have played (or still play).<br />
<br />
 - The game seems to require long periods of real life commitment to achieve anything substantial.  That is, a casual player of a few hours a day (at best) would have nothing to show for it after a period of time while a &quot;lifer&quot; could achieve something eventually.  Is this true or just a biased reading on my part (since using EverQuest as a guide, I am still stuck in the Kunark era)?<br />
<br />
 - The battles raging between ships appear far and few between with players either zerg rushing massive fleets or fleeing at any signs of trouble as the normal course of action.  Reading about parts of the universe under attack for real time months on end with no end in sight seems almost boring.  Or are these huge corporations or guilds or whatever a group of collected players are called just in constant little battles with no epic battles and thus no loss of battleships and other large vessels?<br />
<br />
 - While the game has been out for three to four years (seems to be since 2003 or so), would a new player even have an option to succeed eventually or similar to starting EverQuest today and playing a forever catch-up?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, I would consider this false.  Eve uses an offline training system.  Even when you are off-line your character is gaining skills.  The only thing you actually gain by playing more than another person would be money.  Unless you are planning on flying a carrier or dreadnaught it isnt too difficult to obtain a ship to use.<br />

<br />
This really depends on a bunch of factors.  First would be which type corp your in.  If you join a smaller strike force type mercenary corp than battles will be anywhere from 1vs1 to 20vs20, these smaller battles will try to disrupt mining operations or alliance logistics.  If you join a bigger alliance that controls space, this is where you will see more large fleet engagements, either invading space or defending it.  Another option would be joining a pirate outfit...these guys are usually 10 people fleets causing havoc to players or corps.<br />
<br />
Another factor would be where you are based out of.  Some systems are shit holes that are pirate havens, it wouldnt be hard to find small, fast fights here.  Other systems may be contested, these are the fights that may seem long and boring.<br />

You can definetly catch up to me in certain skills.  I have been playing for 2 years now, but all of my skill points are spread among different skills...some I never even use.  I may have more points than you ever will, but I can never have more points than possible for you in a specific skill, they are capped.  You could join the game now and with in 1 month be an important part of a fleet by using smaller faster ships to tackle and pin down larger ships for the rest of your fleet to kill.</div></div><hr />

The average player according to the EVE people has played for 7-months.  You can train 24/7 too which helps. Plus, we're training skills that take weeks to complete while you're finishing multiple skill levels in a day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been playing for a few months.  Mainly I just putz around in secure space doing missions or mining.  I'm not a big PVP person (yes, Eve probably isn't exactly the game for me) but I've been having fun anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't yet, but I'm planning on downloading it soon to give it a go.  As things currently stand though I'm still going on training skills for at least another 2 weeks yet (probably could have been done 5 weeks ago if I hadn't kept training up other things) so I don't need to plan things further than those yet.<br />
I think Zed uses it though so he can comment further.<br />

<br />
About 3 1/2 months so far myself.  But a month of that was me just training Frigate 5 between the time my trial expired and when I signed up for a full account.  I'm not big on PvP either, but I'm having fun in Empire, and will for at least the conceivable future.  PvP will always be there for me to try out when I finally feel like it.<br />
<br />
 That is, a casual player of a few hours a day (at best) would have nothing to show for it after a period of time while a &quot;lifer&quot; could achieve something eventually<br />
<br />
Quite the opposite.  I play at most for 3 hours a day, usually only for 1 or 2.  A skill taking say 1 day to complete trains during the time you play, then continues training while you are offline (as has been said above).  So the next day you log in and swap it to something else.<br />
Time online gives you money, and even with a really minimal playing time when I started out I managed to clear enough to cover buying ships, weapons etc.  But I just hit the jackpot on Monday and had a tech II implant drop which I got to flog for a fairly obscene figure.<br />
<br />
Plus, joining a corporation (a guild) changes the game entirely.  Money comes in much much faster and you'll learn about the game a whole lot quicker.  Apparently anyway, I'm planning to, but the guild I was applying for just got into a war.<br />
<br />
You won't ever really catch an established long term player.  But you can compete with them in certain areas.  Whereas they could fly say, frigates from all 4 races, you can focus on just one races frigates and achieve an equal level of skill to them in using those frigates.<br />
<br />
Its the sort of thing that goes both ways.  A person starting now will have a lot more stuff trained in 6 months than someone who started 2 years ago would have had trained after their first 6 months due to game changes since.<br />
But the person who started 2 years ago will get more training 'points' in that 6 months than you did as they likely maxed out their learning skills already (they help you train faster) and are using a good set of implants (boost your stats, which help you train faster).<br />
<br />
Oh, and one final piece of advice.  When starting out, try to spread your stats as evenly as possible.  And as a general rule, you don't want a high charisma, so don't put points in it.  You'll probably still regret your choices a few months after you start, but at least you won't be too badly off.<br />
<br />
Beyond that, grab the 2 week trial.  And make sure you have at least 2-3 hours to play the first time you log in as the tutorial takes ages.  When the tutorial gets to the chat channels.  Join 'Graffe'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zedd</div><div class="date">June 21st, 2006, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use Evemon and it roxors!!! When it works... :(<br />
<br />
Currently Evemon is having some issues with not being able to synch you character info.  Anyway, it's a great program that tracks your progress for you.<br />
<br />
Want to fly a heavy assault ship?  Evemon will tell you what skills you need to train up to fly it, and how long it will take including a date and time when you're finished and able to fly / use whatever.  It will show you how much faster you can learn based on adding implants, lets you see the entire skill tree system so you can plan out what you'd like to do.<br />
<br />
A lot of great answers have been given already so I'll just add my two isk. :)<br />
<br />
Eve has a STEEP learning curve.  Even for those of us that have been mmo'ing for ages.  However, like every other game and interface, once you get the hang of it - it's a piece of cake.  And CCP is probably one of the best in the biz currently.  They *listen* to the player base but they sure as hell don't cater to them ~ always.  Whining and bitching from players that think they know what they want or think they know what’s best for a game have ruined more games than I care to think about.  That said they're a great company that really seems committed to a long and successful game experience for you and I. :)<br />
<br />
Like any game with pvp, eve is chock full of tards whose mommies and daddies didn't hold them when they were wee little shitbirds.  So expect to be griefed the first time you wander into low security space.  In this game they refer to themselves as &quot;pirates&quot; and they're role-playing.  Avoid places where you can be griefed and you won't have any problems.  There is plenty to do in EVE in high security (safe) space to keep you occupied while your skills improve.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I feel safer / at home in zero security space.  No Concord (guard npcs) to save you in 0 sec space, but life is,,, simpler really.  I'm a member of one of the more powerful corporations in the southern region of the Eve universe, which is also the founding member of one of the most powerful alliances and lately coalition of alliances in the game's recent history.  My day to day playing consists of lots of boring shit with nothing happening or massive fleet battles against our enemies in our efforts to take their territory systems away from them and utterly destroy them, their alliance, and its member corporations.  We're winning too.  The politics in eve are pretty complex to say the least... :)<br />
<br />
Eve is fucking awesome if you have the time to power game, but few of us do.  Eve is still fucking awesome because you can walk away from the game for about 30 days, which is about how long it takes to max our the cruiser ship skill and then come back and have access to a completely new and powerful ship type (elite cruisers).  To me, that's really cool because even though I can't log in every day, I know that I'm progressing towards goals. <br />
<br />
For me, eve is about fighting a good fight (war) against a bitter enemy, a holy war to advance the cause and further the interests of my corporation and alliance.  To hundreds if not thousands of other players, it's about doing missions (quests) or even mining for hours at a time gathering minerals, making items and getting filthy rich off their fellow pilots.<br />
<br />
&quot;We embrace this fire.  It is, who we are.  A fiery clash of faiths awaits us all.  Our destiny must spawn havoc in the name of preserving future life.  Do not weep for us, or fear the path that we've chosen.  What we do now, we do for the survival of our species.  We will rescue us from ourselves.  It shall come to pass that the fire in the depth of our souls returns those who would defy us to the hell from whence they came.  For there can be no other destiny, but our own.&quot; - e3 2006 &quot;No Other Destiny Trailer&quot;<br />
<br />
It really is a “at your own pace” kind of game.  You don't feel harried to keep up with the corp, and get left behind because you can't raid zone X.  You'll have no trouble finding other new players to explore and learn with, and most likely die with a few times. :)<br />

You can see the different races in EVE.  I am Amarr, in the movie, the second ship shown after the &quot;Amarr&quot; female's face is my primary ship the Apocalypse battleship.  The Amarr are a race of religious zealots, their ships all have religious names and they think themselves to be be the chosen race of god.  They enslaved the minmitar race for generations (Bae is a filthy minmitar I think).<br />
<br />
The four races are what's evolved after we were cut off from Earth eon's ago.  I forget which, but either the gallente or the caldari are descendants of the french, so don't be suprised if you're fighting and suddenly your character just gives up...  I keed I keeed!  :evil:<br />

Yep.  I must say though, if you ever get stuck, there is a &quot;Help&quot; channel that amazingly is full of friendly people who will answer your questions with something other than 'stfu noob'.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gallente are the ones descended from the French.  Amarr are just bitter because we beat them back, despite being smaller.<br />
Well, that and because the Gallente are liberal porn kings which never really sits well with a religious faction. <br />
<br />
Also, Dmitry went Amarr, so they must be the gnomes of Eve.  ;)</div></div><hr />

It's an MMO like no other, that's for sure.  EVE is setup for both uber casual play, and uber hardcore play.  If you only have an hour, you can log in, pick up a mission, and go.  Or, you can go kill rats in belts.  <br />
<br />
If you have longer, you can clear out complexes (think dungeons) either solo, or create a gang to do it.  I'm in Lysandor's corp atm, and we don't do a whole lot of corp things, so haven't seen much of that aspect of the game.<br />
<br />
Heck, this game allows you to be many different things.  Pirate, Bounty Hunter, Trader, Smuggler, Fighter, Miner, and Industrialist, just to name a few.  The missions range from security to PR.<br />
<br />
The fact that everyone plays on the same server is also cool, and, adds a deep sense of community to the player base.</div></div><hr />

About Eve, I've personally not done any great ship battles or 0.0 space stuff, but I've found it a very casual friendly game (well once you figure out how it works). Missions are setup to last 30 or so minutes and the offline training means your never getting behind.</div></div><hr />

I've recently been accepted to a corporation in a large southern alliance, and have a feeling that the game is only just beginning. I may never have as many skillpoints as players who have been in the game since release, but while that even now strikes me as a somewhat broken system, there are some excellent mechanisms in place to balance it out. Maybe you won't win any e-peen competitions with the four-year-old characters, but they still can't train above the fifth rank in any skill, or fly more than one ship at a time. And you can always gloat about how they have to pay ten times as much money to replace their clones when they die.</div></div><hr />

So is bae, donis and the others.  The problem with being at war and living in 0.0 space is that you constantly need to be watching local or a coalition / alliance channel for hostile traffic info.  So I might see you in graffe but I can't always chat unless I'm sitting at a gate camp and listening to teamspeak for hostiles.<br />

 <br />
?!?!!  Ok I've heard about this and it reminds me of hauling cargo in Earth &amp; Beyond (something I LOVED to do) but how does it work in EVE?  I wouldn't dare take a freighter into low sec or 0.0  but if you can haul cargo around in empire space, I'd dearly love to know how it's done.  I can't do it with Zed because of all the war targets that would wtfpwn me as soon as I tried, but I can do it with Kirnahnan (my noob alt).<br />

 <br />
I prefer life in 0.0  You know who will kill you, you know who your friends are.  Things can be difficult, like moving ships and equipment down to 0.0 but that's what alliance escort runs are for.  We just did a run the other night with not 1 but 3 freighters and only about 8 in the escort fleet.  Scary shit.  And more than once we had to safe spot the freighters and chase off pirates and other idiots that got a little to interested in what we were doing. <br />
 <br />
I really love the fluidity of 0.0 life.  The politics are so fascinating, nothing is certain and only the most powerful flourish.  This can be tedious at times but you really feel like you acomplish something when your corp / alliance can hold 3 regions of space.<br />

Buy, pick a system, use the map to make sure you're not going into &lt;.5 space, and set your destination.<br />
<br />
Part of the problem is some of the better-profitting commodities are quickly snapped up by folks with bigger-than-Iteron-class ships... I watched one day as all of a certain component disappeared in gluts of 30k+ units, and then subsequently all of the &quot;buy&quot; orders were filled an hour or so later, completely gutting that market.</div></div><hr />

The items and profit margins vary depending on which faction's space you're in, but off the top of my head there are Protein Delicacies, Reports, and (my personal favorite) Livestock. Just search the market for those items, there will be plenty of buy and sell orders avilable. Find a product with a good profit margin and a 2-5 jump round trip, and there you go.<br />
<br />
It's not terribly profitable (I used an Iteron V with about 18k m3 in capacity, and made about a million per round trip of livestock), but as I said before, you hardly have to pay attention to do it.<br />

OMG who?!<br />

I'm in Shinra, founding member of the Lotka Volterra alliance. Our coalition is comprised of Lotka Volterra -V- Knights of the Southern Cross, E.R.A, Ghost (which is disbanding I hear) as well as a few others.<br />

Of course, realize that Ayralin's setup here - an Iteron mark V industrial - with a vastly increased cargo area - will take you at least 40 days to train for skills, not to mention tens of millions of ISK to pick up the cargo expanders.<br />
<br />

So yummy and gooey!  Big Blue assembled a 60+ member fleet to attack us when we ran a gank squad up to their space a few weeks ago.  We jumped into their home system - BWF, killed a few of them, then all of a sudden here comes their fleet.  We scatter like so many foxes in the hen house,  They call me primary target, I get away, they jump their entire fleet on top of me at a planet and I crash to desktop. :(<br />
<br />
They bubbled their gates and waited for me for hours LOL.  I was banned from their new channels by name.  For some reason I became the the focus of their h8.  :evil:<br />
<br />
As for the hauling, I guess I'll train my alt account up to fly a freighter and run him around empire space making some isk's.  I just bought 100 shares in a  shinra investment project so that return will be nice as well.  :)<br />

I liked it... no I loved it but I just never had the time to do the basic research to figure out what direction I wanted to go in the game.  I was sort of listless really, and I don't think I ended up flying with someone else one time.  Still, my toon was around long enough to grab most of the starter skills that help the other skills level up faster so she'll be in good shape.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh, my exact same issues with Eve since beta.  I've been rather   schizophrenic with my skills because I never knew what I wanted to do, and I still don't LOL.  For example, I fly my race's battleship, but I've trained up for the Raven, a caldari battleship.  I started working towards covert ops, interceptors, then dreadnoughts and then started trying to improve my gunnery skills LOL.  So at the moment, I am training covert ops ships (fast ships built on frigate platforms that can cloak.  I'll be in it by tomorrow morning.  From there I guess I'll improve my skills in that and depending on which covert ship I settle on (I can fly ever race's frigates and cruisers) I'll work up my gunnery skills to tech two level (better weapons).  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I got that listless feeling too, and it's why I quit like 2 or 3 times since beta LOL.  I spent something like two years alone, in empire space tooling around  shooting at NPCs, since the whole pvp thing repulsed me.  I guess I [wrongly] associated pvp with jerks and griefers but I've found that's not the case if I limit my pvp interactions to &quot;war targets&quot; lol...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
During those two years, I never grouped with another player - ever.  It was so lonely and boring!  So I hope you guys will make sure to fly together, I'll drag my weakling noob alt to fly with you if I can, since bringing Zed to empire would me getting my ass shot at and you guys blown up if you group with me lol.<br />

You can still be to some extent.  It just takes much much longer, but at least it offers variation.<br />

At least for now and the shortterm future yes.  It is rumored that this may possibly change with the upcoming expansion path, but nothing has been announced at this point so I wouldn't worry.  <br />
Starting out you wouldn't have any problems anyway as your faction standing with everyone is neutral.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
EQ around PoP did not take forever to 'catch up'. People who'd played just 2 or 3 months around then could easily jump into raid guilds and get stacked up. On Stromm, one guild went from Level 1 to POF in 3 months. If anything, EQ had a catch-up effect, much like real-world economies. Once one group struggles to raise the bar, everyone else catches up to them fairly quickly - everyone knows how to get there...</div></div><hr />

I re-started this past week and I'm happy I did.<br />
<br />
Yah my main issue with this was similar to yours.  In EQ there's pretty much a linear direction you can take if you choose to do so.  Not quite so much in Eve, it feels a lot more open-ended in the early parts.  Plus my understanding is that starting off there isn't as much to do as there is later on.  It's a game that lends itself to patience, because there will be times when all you do is program in a destination and set the autopilot, then check back in in 20 minutes to see if you're in the destination system yet.<br />
<br />
Plus it's a game that works best if you can use outside resources and do research, I'm finding.  Trying to guess at what loadout works based on what ship you can fly and what you can afford is tough, especially if you don't have a target to shoot for.  &quot;Do I want to fly a fast frigate with massive long-range firepower and harass at range?&quot;   &quot;Do I want to transport tribbles from X to Y and make major cash?&quot;  &quot;Do I want to mine stuff?  Do research?&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm JUST starting to get my head around some of this to get me a good direction.  Luckily I've been concentrating in large part on Learning skills, which will cut down on training time when I do decide where I want to go.<br />
<br />
Nice thing is that unlike EQ where you're in a particular archetype, in EVE you can change up your loadout, or more reasonably just buy another ship and train the skills you need for that one.  Want a drone ship and an assault gunship?  Not a problem if you have the time to train and can afford 'em.</div></div><hr />

I have to say, the learning curve hasn't been as bad as I was expecting. Of course, I'm not out of the tutorial yet, but I think I have a good handle on how things work. It's an interesting game. Reminds me a bit of Privateer.</div></div><hr />

Back when many of us started (Beta and just after) it was pretty hard, because the interface wasn't very user friendly, nor were the servers very stable.  Things are better now, the tutorials are outstanding so perhaps that's a dated assessment of the game.<br />
<br />
For anyone that's ready to try 0.0 life etc, I would recommend looking up an alliance called &quot;The Big Blue&quot;.  They run a pvp university and from what I hear they do a really great job of introducing pilots to 0.0 life.<br />
<br />
Be warned:  If you enter Big Blue space, you are a legal target for all of those who come up to Big Blue territory looking to hunt, my alliance included.  I will never fire on another graffe member, but I cannot stop my corpmates from doing the same.<br />
<br />
As always, pay attention to your local chats, and stay the heck out of .4 and lower space until you know exactly what you're getting into.  Do NOT ever buy a ship or item off of escrow without first looking up the system it's in including the route you need to take to get there.  If a deal is too good to be true, then it is.  You'd be suprised how many unsuspecting people purchase an item or ship for a &quot;steal&quot; only to find pirates waiting for them outside the station it's located.<br />

Theres really no limit to how much you can be scammed for.  Check and recheck everything.  Not everything is a scam, but theres a lot that is.<br />
Not just escrow either, even when using the regular market, make sure to check the location of the station you're purchasing from, you really want to minimise unwanted trips into .4 and below.<br />
<br />
Actually, thinking about corps, just be careful when joining any corp set up to train newbies, some pirate and mercenary corps make a habit of war deccing them looking for easy kills.  Obviously not an issue if you're joining a pvp training corp tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zedd</div><div class="date">July 1st, 2006, 10:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye.  There are very few &quot;pirate&quot; and mercenary corps with any shred of honor, so watch yourselves.  MC is definately the ideal mercenary corp though, but you have to have literally millions of skill points to even apply to them, let alone the experience they expect out of their pilots.<br />
<br />
I was very impressed with the way they handled their contract against Big Blue.  Rather than run willy nilly through Big Blue space killing and destroying everything in their path, they went in, destroyed their capitol shipyards and maybe a few other things.  After they'd done that, their contract was fullfilled and they immediately ceased fire on Blue and turned to protecting Blue's systems from anyone that might have tried to take advantage of Blue's weakened position.  I find that remarkable.<br />

Smuggling (against Concord and the 4 empires) is in its infancy in Eve, with only one skill towards it and that supposedly doesn't work all that great.  Smuggling through an alliance's space is more a matter of just blockade running and not getting caught; alliances in 0.0 can't make things illegal to them, except maybe for hanging out in &quot;their&quot; areas.<br />
<br />
Frigates -&gt; Cruisers -&gt; Battlecruisers -&gt; Battleships -&gt; (Drone) Carriers -&gt; Dreadnoughts -&gt; Titans<br />
<br />
The first three have Tech2 counterparts that are stronger and tougher.<br />
<br />
There are also &quot;industrial&quot; ships for hauling large amounts of stuff and Freighters for huge amounts of stuff.</div></div><hr />

You can smuggle but it's not very profitable afaik.  Players buy contraband to trade to their agents who will request the items occasionally as part payment for a reward.  Alliances can't make items illegal so there's no contraband market in 0.0.<br />
<br />
I would stick with your frigate until you have decent skills and then upgrade to cruiser.  I wouldn't go into destroyers at all since they're a dead-end unless you want to fly an interdictor down the road.  Still, put destroyers off and jump into a cruiser next.  You'll be happy that you did.</div></div><hr />

I trained them up, and honestly, it wasn't worthwhile.  It does make all level 1 missions a complete cakewalk, but you shouldn't be struggling with those anyway with maybe 1 exception.<br />
Beyond that, you can put like 8 guns on which is good for a laugh (and not something you can do on anything else for quite a while), but you'll probably max out at 6 because of skill limitations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Axxl 01</div><div class="date">July 4th, 2006, 06:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yesterday, I did something I have not done in a long time.  I spent the &quot;whole&quot; day playing one game.  :eek:   I was sucked into the Eve universe and was having a good time.  So many options with so little time to accomplish everything.  Perhaps it was the newness of it all, but to others, I ~wasted~ a day of my vacation.<br />
<br />
The EveMon(intor) is a very handy tool for those not logged into the game continuously.  I would have quickly lost track of when I was to advance another skill.  And for the skills, I like how everyone does not start with the same template and advance from there.  Add the difficulties of switching templates is a nice twist - possible, but always with its negative effects.  So much for having vanilla players.<br />
<br />
I have stumbled across a few glitches while playing.  After getting a mission to destroy four groups of pirates, one group was intermingled with another group.  Collecting my bounty upon them all, the mission never would update itself of being complete upon each task.  Returning to the agent gained my rewards all the same for completing the mission.<br />
<br />
Minor graphical glitches: during warp drive, I have exhausted blue flames, yellow flames, and no flames.  Good thing collision detection is not available or warp drive would have splattered me upon a few planets.  And the few times I have warped past a star, instead of being this huge ball of fusion, it was only a bright planet in size.  Again, minor notes but nothing game breaking.<br />
<br />
I do like how incentives to finish quickly rewards me with either more money or an item or two.  Of course, the item might be something I can not use right now, if ever.  While I have not advanced to the higher ships (currently with a frigate), I like the various pros and cons involving each ship among its class.  Do I want higher armor and slower speed or the opposite?  Can I afford this ship, much less the insurance?  Oh, the clone and insurance idea is a nice touch.<br />
<br />
Perhaps there are continuous waves of brand new players to a multiple player online world, but casually listening to the newbie channel revealed too many players thinking they have to mine asteroids to gain money.  Once the tutorial set me upon my own in the universe, I was doing hunt and destroy missions for agents, pulling in large amounts of cash.  I guess all those years of Dark Age and EverQuest made me think outside the box.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading.</div></div><hr />

And good on you for skipping mining.  Its a lot more fun and better money to run missions when you start out- plus its a quick way to get a full set of free +1 implants from storyline rewards.<br />
<br />
edit- speaking of mining.  I think I'm now about 24 hours away from getting my refining efficiency to basically 100% on all the ore that I've been mining.  Still going to take a bit of a hit on station tax, but my rep is ok so that won't be too bad.  Not refining any of the ore I've mined for like 6 solid weeks while getting my skill up is about to pay off.</div></div><hr />

Lately I've been training my learning skills while trying to decide what direction to take my character.<br />
<br />
Since smuggling isn't really implemented right now, what other options are there for a Han Solo-type independant operator? Mining so far seems to be a lot less profitable than running missions, but what about high-risk mining in low-sec areas? I gather that's where the better resources are. Can you turn a decent profit by, say, outfitting a destroyer or a cruiser with a mix of mining gear and weapons and sleazing into these more dangerous areas to get the goods and get out? Or is mining only really profitable with dedicated mining ships that gather the stuff in large bulk? It seems like a destroyer might be good for this. They're faster than cruisers, have a decent capacity, and could mount a nice mix of mining lasers and turrets.<br />
<br />
Also, what are 0.0 sectors like for solo players? Is it attack on sight if you're not part of the corp that runs the system?<br />
<br />
Also, I downloaded the EVEMon program (and that is a slick piece of software), and I see under navigation skills something called 'Jump Drive Operation.' What's a jump drive?</div></div><hr />

Jump Drives are used in ships that are too big to fit through the stargates, like the titans (and I think motherships?)<br />
<br />
It creates its own wormhole and jumps through it to the destination.</div></div><hr />

After that, it's a continual process of discovering more and more options available to you. The nice thing about the skill training system is that you can't really make a mistake. There's no limit to the number of skills you can train, and the initial ranks all train so quickly that you can't really train the 'wrong' skill.<br />
<br />
One thing I will say is look into insurance for your ship and upgrading your clone. I haven't been jumped by anyone yet, but it looks to me that if you don't cover your ass this game could potentially have the harshest death penalty I've ever seen.</div></div><hr />

This game sounds really interesting, but it also sounds very complex.  Is it something that takes long to get into?<br />
Xisrene is right.  The tutorial gets you on your feet, but I'd recommend visiting the eve forums to fill in some of the blanks, or keep the Help channel up and running.  Both have been invaluable to me, along with Evemon and that loadout java program.  <br />
<br />
What I like about it is that it's not super complex to understand, but if you dive under the surface it's as amazingly complex as you want to keep up with.  Take the simple art of shooting another ship, for instance.<br />
<br />
A) Fly at the ship and once you're locked and in range hit the &quot;shoot stuff&quot; button.<br />
B) Recognize that firing systems run off of trigonometry and vectors.  Delve into the stuff that Air Force fighter pilots know to maximize your firepower, then add turrent rotation rates into the mix.<br />
<br />
As far as Han Solo stuff goes, I'm nowhere near capable of pulling something like this off yet, but there are tons of cargo transport jobs out there for someone who wanted to do so, but you're not going to be flying a Millenium Falcon to do it, more like a huge, slow freighter.  I suspect you'd need to run serious caravans with all kinds of protection to haul the really profitable ones through 0.0 space... just guessing though since I'm a rookie too.<br />

Well according to the CEO of my Corp (BTW - all Graffies can join us, look for Otakudyne!) those missions are mostly scams..they get you to pay a huge fee to get the job and the client basically makes it impossible to do. But others with more recent experience might disagree.</div></div><hr />

I really enjoy how a person can customize their avatar based upon their chosen skills.  Obviously at the early stages the avatar is very vanilla with nothing special from any other fresh recruit into the game.  But the diversity given is quite staggering.  While I have not dived into any player versus player action, the missions as a whole have been pretty interesting.  Though perhaps either a fluke or poor planning upon my part, occasionally a mission seems to be given on what you have in your inventory.  Example - I was given a mission to destroy a pirate headquarters.  The pirates and their base were overall quite simple to destroy - the mission was a success.  Yet there was this lone pirate flying nearby that I felt needed to be removed.  As this pirate bombarded me with missiles from afar, I was barely able to scratch its armor.  Realizing I was over my head, I attempted to escape but alas watched my ship explode, leaving me as a pod.<br />
<br />
Reviewing my mistakes, I thought that since the last few missions I succeeded rewarded me with missiles, the missions were boosted to take into account me using those same missiles.  But alas, I was unskilled but learned a valuble lesson.  Again, I could be wrong, but the game did seem to link together aspects of your avatar and inventory for determining mission strengths.<br />
<br />
The market aspect is a mixed bag with me at the moment.  I like the wide selections available, yet it seems the spread of prices is exagerated just to push someone on a tight budget to a certain station.  While money seems quite easy to obtain in this game, I do not want to get too wild and just ~throw~ money away either.  It does get me to see other aspects of the universe though.  Oh, like the skills, it seems the makers of this game really thought out the numerous items available.  A pirate transporter was destroyed, dropping two cargo containers.  One contained my mission requirements - militants, and the other contained Marines.  I thought about making them into popsicles, but alas, somewhat being a slave trader at the moment by leaving them in one of my cargo holds upon a station for a future sale.  :p <br />
<br />
I like how the various npcs that you performed successful missions will after a while send e-mails mentioning they have something for sale and if interested; or if I happen to have some item they can buy from me - a nice touch to make the gaming world more alive.  Oh, is there a way to see how much I am going to be charged for something before I buy it from a npc?  So far I have been making a profit when I turn around and resell the items, but for future knowledge...<br />
<br />
EveMON is a gem - I like how you can build plan queues for future studies.  Oh, while I like how offline learning continues, perhaps I am dense, but why is offline learning limited to one character?<br />

You should be able to check your Journal after you are offered something, what something costs and what you will recieve should all be listed.<br />

At the moment I dont beleive there is much use for these.  I'm pretty sure though that they will be very useful when Kali comes out.  I think you will need those skills for the COSMOS constellations, salvaging wrecks, and complex gates.</div></div><hr />

If I'm offered something it's normally a consumer good.  I open up my market dialog and scroll down to the consumer goods tab and click it.<br />
<br />
Next I click the Details button, which gives me the entire market for buyers and sellers in your region.<br />
<br />
Next I sort buyers based on price (or sellers if I have some 'bring me electronics' mission) and check to see if it's worth it to jump a few to get a good price.  Oftentimes, especially since we're early in the game without a ton of demands on our time, it is.<br />

Break out the handy dandy in-game calculator and figure out what your profit will be.  Viola!</div></div><hr />

&quot;Kali&quot; the next expansion for the game?<br />

This game continues to amaze me.  I was idling a moment when I got an e-mail within the game.  A &quot;secret&quot; agent needed me for an important mission.  Then I was sent into the lowest rating space I have visited to this day - 0.4 rating.

<br />
To be fair when I run into low sec space usually nobody is around.  But I click on the location and choose doc asap, and make sure I have a destination before leaving the station I'm at.  The only person whos ever seen me in low sec space only saw me because the game froze for a min...  they didn't shoot me ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zedd</div><div class="date">July 8th, 2006, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Insta's (aka bookmarks) are your friend.  It's tedious but you can make them on your own.  An &#8220;insta&#8221; is a bookmark that lands you right on top of a station so that you can instantly dock, or a stargate so that you can instantly jump to the next system.  These are vital for lowsec and 0.0 space.  Slow-boating to a gate or a station will get you killed.<br />
<br />
I&#8217;ve never bought bookmarks off the escrow market, and I&#8217;ve heard many a tale of pilots being scammed out of their isk for worthless bookmarks so buyer beware.  I got mine from my corp, any corp competent enough to live in 0.0 space will most certainly have bookmarks you can copy.<br />
<br />
To make your own, pick your destination like a stargate.  Set your auto pilot and warp to the gate.  As soon as you come out of warp and you hear &#8220;approaching stargate&#8221; disengage your autopilot, and you&#8217;ll continue to approach the gate.  Left click the gate you&#8217;re approaching &#8211; this will put a square around the gate.  Then double click just below that square and you&#8217;ll then be headed past the gate while still being aligned to it.  Once you&#8217;ve passed the gate, stop your ship at exactly 15km from the gate.  You&#8217;ll know the distance because the gate should still be targeted in your overview.  Once you&#8217;re at 15km, open the People and Places window and select places, then click the add bookmark button at the bottom of the window.  You can label it whatever you&#8217;d like but usually people label it as Gate XYZ.546 or something like Konora Gate ---&gt; XYZ.546 gate.  <br />
<br />
The reason for the second example is that Insta&#8217;s only work if you approach them from the alignment they were saved in.  Yet another reason why Eve is so complex and realistic.  For example if there are five gates in a system, then there would be a different bookmark from each gate to whatever.  Not to mention one for each station, or safe spot.<br />
<br />
Also, what are 0.0 sectors like for solo players? Is it attack on sight if you're not part of the corp that runs the system?<br />
<br />
Certain death.  This is unfortunate for players who are genuinely neutral or just curious about a system or even just &#8220;seeing&#8221; 0.0 space.  It is attack on sight, and if the pilot who&#8217;s alliance holds sovereignty for that system doesn&#8217;t attack you, their enemies who are lurking around looking for locals to kill most certainly will.  Non aggression pacts and positive standings (which would tell other pilots you&#8217;re friendly) are rarely given to individuals, but some alliances do permit smaller corps to move out their regions and hunt / live in those areas.  Each region of Eve is different, as well as each alliance&#8217;s policies. <br />
<br />
If you find yourself in that situation, run like hell if you can, and don&#8217;t bother squawking in local.  There&#8217;s a saying, &#8220;If it aien&#8217;t blue; its goo.  If its red; its dead.&#8221;  Allies will show as blue stars and or backgrounds on your overview, enemies red and neutrals as you normally see other pilots in empire.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jump Drives are used in ships that are too big to fit through the stargates, like the titans (and I think motherships?)<br />
<br />
It creates its own wormhole and jumps through it to the destination.<br />
<br />
Also dreadnoughts and carriers.  A recon pilot uses a device to set up a cynosaural field, which the capitol ship pilot uses to jump to.  Only the capitol ship itself can jump through its portal, but I think I read somewhere that an entire fleet can follow a Titan through it&#8217;s jump portal.<br />

While I was not worried about any potential combat, when I realized I was in &quot;enemy&quot; territory.....One can also find a fair bit of information about what is going down in a solar system by messing around with the map. Look at the route you are being asked to take and mess with the different types of info available. You should be able to find info about the number of pilots in space, ships blown up and pods blown up in the last hour and 24 hours.

Most 0.0 region alliances maintain a traffic intel channel where pilots report sightings of hostile and neutral pilots in their regions and in the lowsec systems that connect to our areas of 0.0 space.

  At one point I decided I wanted to hang out in 0.0 space.  So I found myself a nice 0.1 system, bought some ammo BPs and set myself up a base of operations.  2 jumps away (both 0.0) I would mine ochre for Zydrine and Nocx, and the rest of the minerals I would mine in &quot;my&quot; system (except for Megacyte, I had to buy that).  I had good ratting there and in the next two systems and I had secure cans anchored in safe spots to drop off loot and store ammo so I wouldn't have to keep jumping back and forth.<br />

Ratting normally, at least with the people I hang around with, refers to killing NPC (pi)rat(es).<br />

Eventually, they logged off to avoid us snooping them out.  Otherwise, the system was locked down.  We even podded a friendly when some ASCN guy entered on auto-pilot.

On the universe map, the connection lines between systems are colored blue, purple, and red.  Do the colors represent danger levels?<br />
<br />
I have read two different paths for skilling up.  One involves boosting intelligence and memory to the highest levels then raising other skills.  Another involves raising everything pretty uniformed.  I am following the first path while my brother (who sworn off MMO until Eve) is following the second path.  Any comments or suggestions - perhaps a different path?<br />
<br />
At what point and with what type of ship would people recommend to use before visiting 0.0 space?  I doubt my frigate would survive long...<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Macfudd</div><div class="date">July 13th, 2006, 12:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I know, the connection lines themselves don't have any particular relevence, the colour of the stars themselves do depending on what criteria you've chosen to display.<br />
<br />
Grindel just bumped an old Eve Online thread, as far as I know thats still the best way to go about training up if you're determined to just concentrate solely on learning skills.<br />
Training 1 point in everything uniformly will certainly take your brother longer to finish all his training, but it would make any extra skills he trained during that time likely go faster (particularly ship skills, perception is way down on the recommended list).  And as the first few points only take like 40 minutes you won't be gaining much time by saving them till later.<br />
<br />
Its probably better to go visit 0.0 early on rather than later.  Go before you have to worry about things like implants etc.  Just insure the frigate, make sure your clone is up to date and see how far you get, or even just take a shuttle.  <br />
Its not usually something you can just 'visit' tho, just about everything is claimed by various corps who don't look well on random visitors.</div></div><hr />

I haven't seen any that role-play except when it's a convenient reason to attack.<br />
<br />
  A griefer is someone with superior skill points, firepower, and/or numbers who specifically target the [I](very) much weaker and newer toons.  Griefers generally avoid the major pipes to 0.0 due to whom (BOB, CHIMP, SA, 5, LV, RA, and etc.) they may accidentally catch in their trap.  Plus, a griefer wont be found in most of Alliances claimed 0.0 space.  At least Snig and those like them will venture into Alliances claimed space to ply their trade.  Those are the pirate corps - the others that I described are mostly full of griefers.</div></div><hr />

I think one of the reasons a lot of people term pirates as 'griefers' is because they have not actually met an actual pirate.<br />
<br />
The one time I was blown up by a player I was gate-ganked going into a .4 system.  No warning, no message, just web, warp block, boom.  Then I was podded.<br />
<br />
If I'd been ransomed, I'd have tried to pay.  Instead, I was ganked.<br />

Hence, griefer.</div></div><hr />

On the universe map, the connection lines between systems are colored blue, purple, and red.  Do the colors represent danger levels?<br />
<br />
<br />
The connection lines represent if the jump is just between system, constellations, or regions. The danger levels are fully represented by the security level of the system itself.<br />
<br />

I have read two different paths for skilling up.  One involves boosting intelligence and memory to the highest levels then raising other skills.  Another involves raising everything pretty uniformed.  I am following the first path while my brother (who sworn off MMO until Eve) is following the second path.  Any comments or suggestions - perhaps a different path?<br />
<br />
My plan, when I began playing, was to raise all of the learning skills as quickly as I can, while raising other skills when I couldnt' stand to wait. Flipping back and forth took longer than the 57 odd days to raise all the learning skills, but it kept the fun in.<br />
<br />
If you really wanna powergame it, raise them all immediately, and get a set of implants (+3 or better, or whatever you can afford), to raise attributes further, and grit your teeth through the boredom laden bits. I found I couldn't do that, and just had to skill up some other stuff just to keep the interest.<br />
<br />
<br />
At what point and with what type of ship would people recommend to use before visiting 0.0 space?  I doubt my frigate would survive long...<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
A frigate is pretty ill suited for 0.0, since it can't kill any of the belt rats, is a poor miner of the more lucrative ores. My first venture into 0.0 (Venal region) was in a cruiser I'd outfitted for mining with my old corp, but I went out to meet corpmates. The big thing about 0.0 is that you have to have allies to watch your back and help each other out. If you were to take a short excursion out, solo, I'd suggest battleship, and also learn the ins and outs of the 0.0 choke point you're going to use, what bookmarks you'll need, and who, if anyone, claims that space. And get insurance, and be prepared to lose what you're flying, too. That cruiser I took to my first 0.0 mining ops was ganked 2 jumps away from the op by an enemy gank squad, and I hadda hoof it back to Empire space in a newbie ship. :)<br />

<br />
<br />
One of the best points I've seen presented is how pirates are necessary to keep the market alive. If no one ever lost their ships, new ones wouldn't need made, minerals wouldn't be necessary, miners would be broke, etc.<br />
<br />
Players with -10 security ratings who sit at 0.4 gates in Ravens to podkill newbies, however, are not pirates, regardless of whether they claim to be &quot;roleplaying.&quot;<br />

<br />
Raising your learning skills should be the number one priority as soon as you've secured the skills to fly the basic craft for your playstyle - frigates for missions, a hauler for commerce, etc. Memory and Intelligence are the primary and secondary attributes for getting the tier 1 learning skills up quickly. The tier 2 learning skills have the attribute they raise as the primary with memory as the secondary.<br />
<br />
With my latest alt, I used the trial period to get to the full +10 memory from skills, and I plan to get all the other attributes (even charisma) to +9 before I start training anything &quot;useful.&quot;<br />
<br />
At what point and with what type of ship would people recommend to use before visiting 0.0 space? I doubt my frigate would survive long...<br />
<br />
If you are very, very skilled in the right ways, a battlecruiser can be used for ratting in 0.0, but a battleship would be better. If you're a mining/industrial character, I would suggest going into 0.0 space with friends, or not at all. If you can't fly or can't afford the ORE mining barges (Retriever, Covetor, etc.) an Exequror cruiser or Brutix battlecruiser (both Gallente) can make a nice mining ship.<br />
<br />
It's been mentioned earlier in the thread, but this seems a good place to give props to The Big Blue alliance. They run a self-proclaimed &quot;carebear haven&quot; for miners and ratters in a half-dozen system slice of 0.0 accessed through the Oijanen system. It's a great way to get your feet wet in the ways of 0.0 life. They have two public channels: IPSNews for security updates and links to the rules they enforce, and IPSPublic for general chat.<br />
<br />
They've been having a hard time recently; while Mercenary Coalition carried out an efficient and disciplined war, TBB was torn up pretty good, and still aren't really back on their feet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what I've seen of it, for a lot of PvPers (including pirates, griefers, and alliance gank squads), it's all about thier yang of PvP, and the yin of Empire &quot;safe space&quot; activity - mining, trading and industrial activity (which has it's own PvP aspect to it), gets the derisive sneer from most guns up PvP pilots.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm definitely someone who has played Eve under the &quot;pirate&quot; label and found that it suits me perfectly. It is roleplay however. I don't pirate people IRL :grinno: <br />
<br />
Sometimes I wonder if those who liberally attach the label of &quot;greifer&quot; to a pirate fail to understand the essense of roleplay and see that it actually adds to the depth of the Eve experience.<br />
<br />
First off, I'm not meaning to attack you specifically, or anything. I just want to generally rant a bit about the duality of Eve's gameplay. Don't take this personally.<br />
<br />
This topic, of piracy, PvP, &quot;0.0 vs empire&quot;, is the single reason that I have not played Eve continuously from beta. It's not to do with tactics, but attitude.<br />
<br />
One can send me &quot;Yarr, die Gallente scum!&quot; as many times as they want, and it won't change the fact that, for all the enjoyment the pirater gets out of catching me,  I'm not having fun being caught. I say this, agnostic of the tactic used - gate sniping, belt hopping, gate camping 0.0 chokepoints, or high sec suicide ganks. It's perfectly valid that people have fun doing that, but let's not fool ourselves into thinking that that reconciles the frustration of the gankee. And there is frustration - one spends a lot more time in Eve skilling up and financing thier ships than one does picking up powerups in Quake - that's why we value our ships and pods so much in Eve, as we should. <br />
<br />
Some players recognize that, and stick to ganking only war decced targets, or alliance enemies, or ransom low sec commerce; in thier way, they make an honest effort to accomodate the other player who they recognize as not wanting to be involved in thier style of fun. God bless 'em, their kind is few and far between in the Eve universe, and I treasure thier restraint.<br />
<br />
Some people fail to empathize. They do what they do with no regard as to how thier fun affects the fun of the guy at the other keyboard - and if one reviews the Crime and Punishment forums at eve-online.com, sometimes it's just to get the smack emails and smack talk in local from the victim. That's the classic definition of a griefer in just about any MMORPG - a player who actively seeks to disrupt the play of other players in the game. The fact that Eve tolerates this behavoir doesn't change that definition; it just makes Eve a griefer tolerant game. <br />
<br />
And for that reason, I have cancelled my Eve account twice since I first started playing in 2003. Not because I was ganked, but because I recognized the attitude of a large proportion of my fellow players was that they didn't give a damn about how I liked to play the game. The most irritating protests I hear are those that go on about how, if I'm not interested in shooty-shooty PvP, perhaps I should stay in high sec or otherwise use the many methods whereby one can avoid the pirates and PvPers, but then followup with, if I spend all my time in high sec, I'm not playing the game right! Well, which is it?? I'd say, and I'll hear all kinds of answers and justifications as to what Eve really is, but ultimately, it's about how I'm not participating in thier game. I saw this in Phoenix Alliance (which is why I left and formed my own corp), and the official forums give me reason to believe that this is not a unique attitude.<br />
<br />
So, frankly, if I get no consideration from the PvPers as to how I want to play, they can hardly expect me to be obliging and head off into a warzone for them to take potshots at me. That's only common sense, to my mind. Were CCP to say to us tomorrow, &quot;All pilots 6 months and older must move out to 0.4 systems or lower&quot;, you wouldn't get an exodus to low sec and 0.0 - you'd get mass cancellation of accounts. For a certainty, I can probably say I'd cancel mine. It wouldn't be the game I want to play anymore.<br />
<br />
But in any case; feel free to play the pirate, I say, more power to ya. It can be fun, and lucrative. Just don't fool yourself into thinking that you can justify to those who don't want to participate that they should be having fun, if they truly aren't.<br />
<br />
Sorry if it's long winded, but it's been boiling around in my brain lately, and I had to get it off my chest. Nor is it meant to be any attack on you specifically,  Goanad,  just a statement of my position. Perhaps I need to set a long training skill and take a break from it.<br />

<br />
  A griefer is someone with superior skill points, firepower, and/or numbers who specifically target the [I](very) much weaker and newer toons.  Griefers generally avoid the major pipes to 0.0 due to whom (BOB, CHIMP, SA, 5, LV, RA, and etc.) they may accidentally catch in their trap.  Plus, a griefer wont be found in most of Alliances claimed 0.0 space.  At least Snig and those like them will venture into Alliances claimed space to ply their trade.  Those are the pirate corps - the others that I described are mostly full of griefers.<br />
<br />
I love attacking alliances. The big problem however, is that the ones worth attacking have their soft underbellies situated dozens of jumps from the borders of 0,0 and empire. LV and ASCN in particular are this way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The one time I was blown up by a player I was gate-ganked going into a .4 system.  No warning, no message, just web, warp block, boom.  Then I was podded.<br />
<br />
If I'd been ransomed, I'd have tried to pay.  Instead, I was ganked.<br />
<br />
Hence, griefer.<br />
<br />
Unless you are in a big group of BS's tanking the sentries, ransoming is kind of difficult in that scenario because those sentries do hurt! :) Even then some of the more notorious pirate corps would rather blow up your ship for the chance at good modules or cargo versus a long drawn out convo regarding ransom that most of the time results in the ransomed person going ..i.. at the pirate and hence being turned into goo a couple seconds later.</div></div><hr />

No warning, no nothing. Just blow me up with 2 shots and blow up the pod in one. That's a griefer and only a griefer would bother to defend such crap. In no way does it add to the Eve experience in a positive way. Now, a true pirate corp is a different thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
How does a &quot;true pirating corp&quot; proceed differently? Keep in mind my former remarks about how ransoming by alot of pirates is viewed as passe and just something that not every situation permits OR something which is even widely accepted by those being ransomed, who, as I point out, are more inclined to disbelieve that the pirate will actually honor the ransom and hence aren't likely to respond favorably to a request for a ransom in the first place. I personally have seen it both ways. I've actually had people before I even got through their shields plead in local for a ransom. If I'm not tanking sentries and I have no reason to suspect that they are trying to &quot;buy time&quot; until their backup arrives, I'll play ball and offer a ransom.</div></div><hr />

I certainly understand your point. I respect people who understand AND accept as valid that non-consensual pvp occurs in .4 and lower and because of that they choose to play in .5 and higher. I dont agree with those who demean people because they choose to be in .5 and higher in npc corps. <br />
<br />
TBH, I think you are letting what others say bother you too much. People will, in my experience, think what they want to think and will do so irregardless of anything. Ignore them and play the game in .5 and higher and have fun!</div></div><hr />

I was given a mission by a level one agent to take out this murderer and his or her comrades.  As I approach their last known position and while coming out of warp drive, I see the four targets noted upon my location pull down screen.  Of course they see me because I notice all four lock upon my frigate.

So I return to a nearby base to retrieve a newbie ship so I can collect any remaining cargo contained gear.  Again as I approach the container, the enemy seems to fly towards me from being a good distance off, and before I can react, their goes my ship again.  Before my destruction, the game classified three of the enemies as deadly and the fourth as high.<br />

Sometimes lvl 1 missions can be challenging for a frigate, depending on the individual mission. Difficulty varies quite a bit. Try some modules that will either increase your shields, armor, or resists on one or the other. Also, look for opportunities to determine the range of the battle by fitting an MWD. And lastly, it's not a sin to ask for another person to help finish a particularly tough mission.</div></div><hr />

Scanner, probe, or else you can see which direction they are lining up to warp and just warp to whatever celestial object is in line.  Unless they warp to safe spot, than youll need a probe or scanner.<br />

Obviously it would not be found on the market so would I have to find it as cargo treasure from a pirate? Or are there lawless places in the universe where one could purchase such illegal goods?<br />
<br />
Different empires define different products as contraband. For example, slaves might be perfectly legal to fly around with in Amarr territories, but illegal in Gallente space. Products will be sold (and usually bought) in any region where they are legal.</div></div><hr />

Yet these same corporations have agents that offer goods at a reduced price before hitting the market and that costs you loyalty points. Thus any offer I get from an agent I should refuse to save these points.<br />
<br />
Still being a newbie to the game, I am a bit baffled why an agent would want me to track down some contraband, run the risk of delivery, then loose almost all my loyalty to that agent for some ISKs.  I would think I should be gaining loyalty by putting my ass on the line instead of turning the agent into the proper authorities...<br />

<br />
&quot;Loyalty points&quot; are kind of a confusing term in that regard. Your standing with the agent is a better reflection of how much they like you, while loyalty points are a currency that lets you access bigger and better items the more you save.</div></div><hr />

Just curious. I've been playing lil bit of cat and mouse with alot of different groups rolling through Catch lately. I've been jumping my carriers(2 of them) around to various points in that region looking for a good hunting area. Yesterdday I ran into The Establishments Nyx Mothership one system over from me. They jumped into &quot;my&quot; system after a bit and wanted a fight but I wasn't interested as there is no way to really &quot;pin down&quot; a Mothership with its EW immunity. Also various Shinra groups were prowling about all day. <br />

On a sidenote I saw some LV tore up by DDI who have ties to Axiom alliance. Personally I salivate at the possibility of LV showing Axiom whose the real deal on the  block!</div></div><hr />

I guess I should preface my response by saying that after I left ASCN(8 months and rising to level of director in 2nd largest corp there), I pirated a bit but then joined Adeptus Gatticus right as they joined LV. I moved alot of my stuff to 9-98, deep in LV territory and frankly found that for my gaming(pvp) interests and playtime, LV was just too damn good for what I liked best(ie, a target rich &quot;local defense type&quot;--i dont want to have to make 10 to 12 jumps nightly with low playtime to get pvp-- environment without it devolving into blobbing). So I regretfully left ADG. They and LV as a whole are good ppl. <br />
<br />
My main character is Davlin Lotze. AFAIK, the Nyx is very easily trackable by studying the EST's killboard. They move around  between less than a half dozen systems. Your comment about pwning their carrier explains why they weren't hot for what honestly was my approaches made recently towards them regarding becoming a member of EST :) They are very capable corp and somewhat innovative with the way in which they use capital ships in Eve. That was and is attractive to me. Conventional Gate camping and boring POS warfare are exactly the opposite 8-(.</div></div><hr />

Lowbie mining? Any 0.9 or 1.0 system - you won't be bothered by NPC pirates there. For NPC pirate hunting, I'd suggest start at asteroid belts in 0.8 systems and work your way down as the comfort level increases. <br />

I like having multiple characters because it makes things a lot more interesting (namely mining).  It also opens up the possibility of soloing 10/10 complexes in 0.0 eventually...  10/10s require either a large group of people, or a dreadnought to tank.  I'm still a long way from being there, but its nice to consider the possibility of taking just 1 or 2 other people and clearing a 10/10 in a night... (For reference, clearing a 10/10 complex generally nets around 1 bil isk in loot, the only hard part is being allowed to use your alliances 10/10, which isnt that big a deal in the south, but if you look in the north there are only a handful of 10/10 complexes.)</div></div><hr />

POS's orbit (well not really but ya) moons and mine them for rare minerals used in the production of Tech II items.  They have very very deadly defense systems, and the Large pos's that are configured correctly are said to be able to pop a dreadnought in one volley.  They also have a force field around them that makes anything inside of them invulnerable to attack or being targeted.  You can literally sit inside the bubble and flip a bird at an enemy pilot.<br />
<br />
Begun the Pos wars have.  Kill them we must.  <br />

<br />
<br />
This is a pic of a POS blowing up which by the way takes about 2 real life days to completely destroy.  First attack is to destroy the tower shields (not the bubble I mentioned earlier).  After that, it goes into a reinforced mode for a set number of hours and once it comes out, you can go back and attack it's structure.  If the pos owner can get to it, he can refuel it, and repair the damage, if not, the force field comes down during the second battle, usually about 1/2 way into structure before it's finally destroyed.  Someone else can dig up the total hitpoints of a large pos tower, and how much damage a dreadnought does with each volley.<br />

BMs = bookmarks.  Good BMs will put you within jump range when you warp from gate to gate.<br />
<br />
RA = Red Alliance.  They're the evil Russians who exploit, break and/or bend every rule possible to hold onto their 0.0 space.<br />
<br />
Pipes = The route to, from and between 0.0 regions.  Most regions only have one or two pipes from empire out to deep space.<br />
<br />
NBSI = Not Blue Shoot It.  When your corp/alliance has a non-aggression pact or alliance with other corps/alliances they appear as blue on the in-game overview.<br />

Did that help clear things up?</div></div><hr />

To actually install a jump clone into an NPC station requires a standing of 8 and a corp standing of 8.<br />
<br />
Also, I recomend around 10m SPs before venturing out into 0.0 and focused on something like combat.<br />

Also, Melc, I'll be heading to empire soon and sitting there for a week or so, so if you want help moving I can grab a mammoth near your area and haul and you can just scout for me</div></div><hr />

This brings up a good question I have been meaning to ask.  My effective standing with my navy agent is 9.8, but my standing with navy is only 3.2 and that's with connections skills.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Axxl 01</div><div class="date">July 27th, 2006, 07:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow - this game continues to amaze me!  I was doing some missions for a military agent and was receiving simple ammo and missile rewards for quickly completing the missions.  Normally I do not dwell upon these rewards in case of a mishap so I would not feel a sense of loss for something I never had.  Anyway,  I was given a mission to fly a few zones away and destroy a bunch of drones.  I saw another item being offered and again without really thinking about it, accepted, completed, and obtained my latest reward - a frigate ship!<br />
<br />
Yes, I am currently flying a combat frigate ship.  But to be boosted from 2000 lead charges to an _actual_ ship... *dances*.<br />
<br />
Hey - I'm still a newbie in the game and want to enjoy my moment in the light.  :p <br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Different note - is it possible to transfer items to a player?  I obtained a book that my brother could use.  Since we both use the same computer for playing,  we can not both be online simultaneously.  I heard something about using the market, but I want to specifically give this to him before another could &quot;buy&quot; it before switching accounts.  Any information would be appreciated on how to go about this task, if possible.<br />
<br />

<br />
Do agents normally offer missions where you slowly but surely become enemies with the three other &quot;races&quot;?  While I am not an enemy of the state, I am not exactly going to make their Christmas card list either.<br />
<br />
Hmmm, a game where faction and actual skill improvements mean and present something noticable again (listening EverQuest?)...</div></div><hr />

Hopefully my Caldarian Merlin will remain small enough and remain out of someone's target hairs to just bounce and roll off these bigger combat ships as I casually burn past them towards a jump gate, continuing being the little newbie that I am...</div></div><hr />

<br />
GoonSwarm: &quot;Oh, please don't throw me into the briar patch, er Syndicate, brer BoB&quot;<br />
<br />
BoB have stated that they want GoonSwarm eradicated - gone from the game completely. This is going to tie up considerable amounts of BoB's resources, leaving them less able to react to...other threats. And the moment that they take their eyes off the goons, the goons declare victory (because they survived).<br />
<br />
What BoB should have said is something like &quot;We are going to punish GoonSwarm for their actions&quot; - leaving it vague. That way, if things start going pear-shaped for them, they just declare &quot;Mission Accomplished!&quot; and get the hell out of Dodge.</div></div><hr />
