<br><br>
<b>56 to 62</b><br><br>
Invis up and go straight to the Pyramid and instead of going to the east wall to enter Ssrea, go to the west wall.  The quads will work nicely as long as you keep close to the pyramid wall.  So your first breaking quad will be the golems there.  There is only 1 on the west wall, but for sport you can pull the north side and south side golems as well.
<br><br>  
After the west Golem is removed, the shissar that act like they are dead are easy.  There are basically 2 sets of Shissar on the SW corner and WNW corner.  Getting used to these 2 spots can take a little time but when you get the hang of it, on the SW corner you can AE snare 2 off the bat and on the WNW corner you can get 3 in the first shot, getting the rest is easy.  
For the Shissar I recommend snaring them on the pull as they run fast.
There are 2 major dangers here:
<br><br>
1.  You will normally not get any adds unless you get too close to the circling set of hills that surrounds Ssrea.  roaming mobs stay away from the temple.
<br><br>
2.  Occasionally a named will pop, I normally sweep them up in the quad then solo them after the other 3 have died.
<br><br>
<b>62 to 65</b>
<br><br>
In the NW corner, there is a pond surrounded by Sun Revnants.  These are also an easy quad, but there are 3 traps around the pond you have to get used to.  Each one will pop up some form of rockfiend.</td></tr></table></body></html>
