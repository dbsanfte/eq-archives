However, completing it will improve your PoP charm without needing to kill Grummus. Note that this quest does not replace the Grummus flag for the purpose of progression in the PoP storyline.

Talk to Grimror Plaguebringer, a wandering ogre in Plane of Disease. Hail him and he'll say "Grimror no have time ta talk. Gots stuffs ta do."

<b>Ask him "What stuffs?"</b>

"I wuz sent here by Zulort to, err. . . To gadder some alchemy type stuffs. Him have big plan, and need me to travel lots."

<b>Ask "What big plan?"</b>

"Me not tell you dat! Grimror keep secrets secret. You gonna help Grimror or no?"

<b>Say "I will help Grimror"</b>

"Dat good! Grimror been getting compon ents for dayz now and Grimror still not finushed. You gonna get dem tings fur me?"

<b>Ask "What about dem tings"</b>

"Grimror need bile, dat stuff es strong here! But Grimror keent seem to git eet all. Bile comz from da leetle bugs. Keel little bugs, and geeve Grimror dere leetel bodiez and Grimror give yuuz anyting dat yuuz want. Dere on four leetel buggiez dat Grimror still neez, two uf dem come from da fliez, one comez from da wurmiez, and one comez from the moss-skeeterz. Yuuz bring Grimror dere lavas and Grimror geeve yuuz, and yuuz freends, anyting yuuz want."

You need four things, all from larvae (not sure why he says they come from flies, that seems to be incorrect)

<b>Sengian larva flesh
Scaevian larva flesh
Generian larva flesh
Harrion larva flesh</b>

These drop off of the matching larvas. They have placeholders as follows:

PH for Harrion larva = a malarian larva (note larva, not larvae, spawns near zone in, off to the right)
PH for Generian larva = a planarian larva (again just larva, spawns east of castle east of river near pussling camps)
PH for Scaevian larva = a Tsetsian Pupa (just pupa, not pupal, spawns a bit east of generian)
PH for Sengian larva = a Blarian larva? (spawns in the same general area as Generian/Scaevian)

Once you have all four, turn them in to Grimror, and your group will get flagged for access to Crypt of Decay. Talk to the dwarf in Plane of Tranquility to upgrade your charm based on this flag. You will also get a <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=9294">Bangle of Disease Warding</a>.
