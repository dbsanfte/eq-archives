  <p align="center">This quest is given by Despondo, the wizard trainer, in Firona 

    Vie (-4000, 2619.50) and this is indeed for the level 39 spell, Concussion.

      </div>

  <p align="left"><b>You say, "Hail Despondo." </b> </p>

  <p align="left">Despondo looks a bit troubled. "Welcome, Welcome adventurer, 

    I am the wizard tutor Despondo although few need tutorage around here. It 

    would seem that this is no place for a student of any sorts. The lands of 

    Kunark are quite deadly." </p>

  <p align="left"><b>You say, "Whats wrong?" </b> </p>

  <p align="left">Despondo says "I was bound to this post by General Veredeth. 

    I came to find the lost souls of my friends, but am needed here. I must find 

    a fellow wizard to [rescue their souls]" </p>

  <p align="left"><b>You say, "I will rescue their souls." </b> </p>

  <p align="left">Despondo says "You will need the [three bottles of entrapment]. 

    if you can find their remains in Kunark they you will give the bottles to 

    the body and their soul shall enter. Return all three bottles and I shall 

    give you the wizard spell [Brain Bite]" </p>

  <p align="left"><b>You say, "Where are the three bottles of entrapment?" </b> </p>

  <p align="left">Despondo says "I will need three gems to prepare the bottles. 

    I am afraid I left my currency within the Freeport Vault. You will have to 

    get the gems I need: a peridot, an onyx and a star rose quartz then I will 

    give you the bottles." </p>

  <p align="left"><b>You say, "What is Brain Bite?" </b> </p>

  <p align="left">Despondo says "Brain Bite is a concussion spell created by my 

    former friends whose souls are now lost to Kunark. The blow to the inner brain 

    of an enraged foe may just cause the loss of memory and lower their rage. 

    If you want a copy you have to [rescue their souls].</p>

  <p align="left"><b>You say 'Where are their souls' </b> </p>

  <p align="left">Despondo says 'I have had visions of their sourroundings. (nice 

    Verant typo). Hampton is in a forest of trees which rain oranges. Ryla fell 

    within a great fortress of armored dog men. Mardon met his fate high in a 

    palace above the jungle leaves.</p>

  <p align="left">When I gave him the gems I got 3 seperate bottles of entrapment. 

    Identifying them, They are labeled Morden Hampton and Ryla. </p>

  <p align="center"> </p>

  <p align="center"> </p>

  <ul>

    <li>The beings that need to be found are called "a human skeleton".</li>

    <li>To get the souls, do not kill the skeletons but hand them the correct 

      bottle (use Identify to find out which bottle is which).</li>

    <li>Some race/diety combinations are KoS (kill on sight) to the skeletons. 

      If you are KoS to the skeletons, you will need someone to charm them while 

      you hand them the correct bottle (charming can be done by an enchanter or 

      a level 49+ necromancer with Cajole Undead). Once you hand the skeleton 

      the bottle, the skeleton will vanish and in your inventory will be a new 

      bottle called "Bottle of Swirling Smoke". <br>

      <br>

      <ul>

        <li><b>Hampton</b>: This is the easiest soul to get. Hampton is found 

          in the ruined city within Trakanon's Teeth. Location is +270, -3800. 

          Hampton cons indifferent to most light races but be sure to con Hampton 

          regardless. If you are KoS to him, get an enchanter to charm him while 

          you hand him the correct bottle. <br>

          <br>

        </li>

      </ul>

      <ul>

        <li><b>Ryla</b>: Ryla's soul is in a jail cell in <a href="karnors_castle3.jpg?PHPSESSID=28303db0c7fccdd05786ff9cbc4d3312" target="_blank">Karnor's 

          Castle</a>. The 'a human skeleton' for Ryla's soul cons indifferent 

          to most light races but be sure to con Ryla regardless. If you are KoS 

          to him, get an enchanter to charm him while you hand him the correct 

          bottle. Check <a href="karnors_castle.jpg?PHPSESSID=28303db0c7fccdd05786ff9cbc4d3312" target="_blank">this map</a> 
          for the quickest, easiest, safest path to get to Ryla's skeleton. Before 

          you do anything ask a druid/ranger in the zone if they see 'a human 

          skeleton' in their tracking list. If the human skeleton is not on track, 

          just hang out in the zone and he will spawn eventually (he spawns for 

          approx 20mins and then despawns for 20mins). If or when the human skeleton 

          is up, continue with the following steps: 

          <blockquote> 
            <p>With the path indicated on the map, you will only encounter around 

              2-3 mobs on the way to the cell. </p>

          </blockquote>

          <ol>

            <li>Buff up to the max. Cast all your buffs (example: manaskin, shield 

              of the magi, resistant skin, elemental armor) get SoW from the nearest 

              druid and then ask a cleric in the zone to cast symbol, resolution/heroism, 

              shield of words on you. Do not cast levitate, levitate limits the 

              height of your gravity flux and you will not make it over the wall. 

              Do not get a magic resist buff or you will resist your own Gravity 

              Flux.</li>

            <li>When you're ready to some beatings, head towards the Gravity Flux 

              point on the map, and gravity flux yourself. Try to land on the 

              target (marked on map). Make sure you don't panic when you get two 

              mobs hitting you. Just relax and root them both, recast Manaskin/Diamondskin 

              and move on. </li>

            <li>Now when you get to the Prison area, there will be about 6 mobs 

              in the room (one in each cell); once again do not panic. Ignore 

              everything in the room and go in the cell where the human skeleton 

              is (see map). </li>

            <li>Hand her the RYLA bottle and run back out the way you came. Jump 

              over the rail into the moat and swim towards the ledge where you 

              gravity fluxed yourself. </li>

            <li>Cast Gate to safely get out of the zone without training anyone.</li>

          </ol>

        </li>

        <p><b>Mardon</b>: Found in The City of Mist. Mardon is a level 40-45 wizard 

          and is aggro to everyone. The location of Mardon is +136.00, -641.00, 

          +76.97 upon the second floor. To retrieve Mardon's soul, you will need 

          a lvl 45+ enchanter companion to charm it. Take a look at <a href="city_of_mist.jpg?PHPSESSID=28303db0c7fccdd05786ff9cbc4d3312" target="_blank">this 

          map</a> created for the easiest and safest path to the 'a human skeleton'. 

          A human skeleton in City of Mist has many place holders. Ranging from 

          Plague Bone Skeletons to Fog Golems. Just keep re-doing the following 

          steps until you get the 'a human skeleton' spawn instead of one of the 

          place holders. Same routine on this one:<br>

          <br>
        Bayler has an excellent guide for this part which can be found
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.graffe.com/library.php?id=22">here</a>.<br>

        </p>

        <ol>

          <li>Get as many buffs as you can so that you will last long enough to 

            complete the job. </li>

          <li>Once you're ready, walk in front of the gate and stand on the Gravity 

            Flux position (marked on the map). Gravity Flux your self and try 

            to land on the marked position on the map (2nd floor ledge). </li>

          <li>Once you get up, follow the path into the room indicated on the 

            map (rooting every mob you encounter on the path). </li>

          <li>Step inside the room to aggro the spawns inside.</li>

          <li> Once you're sure you aggro'd the mobs inside, run back out the 

            way you came and jump into the moat and get on the bridge. </li>

          <li>Stand still before the bridge and wait for the human skeleton, and 

            what ever you agro'd to warp on top of you. </li>

          <li>Have your enchanter partner Entrance all the mobs and CHARM the 

            'a human skeleton' npc. </li>

          <li>Hand over the correct bottle (use identify on the bottle) to the 

            'a human skeleton' while he's charmed to get Mardon's soul. </li>

        </ol>

      </blockquote>

    </li>

  </ul>

  <p>Another way is to set up camp near the waterfall/river and then have someone 

    who can sense undead try to target the human skeleton when it spawns up in 

    the corner tower room. Once they successfully target the human skeleton, have 

    them swim down into the water underneath and then taunt it. Taunting from 

    this distance will work since there is no z-axis (vertical) check.</p>

  <p>Once you have all 3 bottle of swirling smoke. Head back to Despondo in Firiona 

    Vie and hand all 3 bottles at the same time. Despondo will award you a 'Scroll 

    of Brain Bite' (no-drop) for retrieving all 3 lost wizard's souls. Congratulations!</p>

  <p>Some general Info before/while doing the quest: </p>

  <ol>

    <li> Buy a lot of Peridots (for manaskin/diamondskin)</li>

    <li>Check the map and memorize the path.</li>

    <li>Do not panic, be brave and just follow the instructions. </li>

    <li>Grab a lvl 45+ enchanter friend to help you with Mardon's soul. </li>

    <li>Get everything ready before attempting to get the souls (ie. Have the 

      RIGHT bottle ready to give to the skeleton) </li>

    <li>Make sure you have are fully buffed and SoW'ed. Better safe than sorry. 

    </li>

    <li>Do not hesitate to re-cast manaskin/diamondskin on your way to the human 

      skeleton.</li>

            Casting time: 2.0 <br>
            Effect: The spell seems to work as a wizard's form of 'evade'. It puts 

      the caster on the bottom of the mob's hate list. A good example would be 

      is when you're in a group and you overburn on the first half of the mob's 

      hit points and you agro'ed the crap out of the mob. Simply cast this spell 

      once or twice on the mob and the mob will turn to your tank or who ever
