				 Celebrating &#8220;30 Delicious Years,&#8221; The Cheesecake Factory is serving up several sweet initiatives throughout 2008. <br />
<br />
To kick-off the anniversary celebration and in commemoration of National Cheesecake Day on July 30th, 2008, The Cheesecake Factory restaurants will offer every delicious slice of its more than 30 varieties of cheesecake with a dollop of nostalgia by featuring all cheesecakes at $1.50 per slice, limit one per guest, dine in only, on that day&#8212;as they were when the restaurant first opened in 1978. <br />
<br />
In addition, a special, limited edition cheesecake, the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake, will be introduced on July 30th with $0.25 from the sale of each slice sold this year benefiting the national hunger-relief organization, America&#8217;s Second Harvest &#8211; The Nation&#8217;s Food Bank Network. Additional activities will be announced throughout the year.

				 SAO PAULO (Reuters) - An 11-year-old boy is enjoying a flash of fame in Brazil after biting a pitbull that attacked him as he played in his uncle's back yard, local media reported on Thursday.<br />
ADVERTISEMENT<br />
<br />
Gabriel Almeida, who lives on the outskirts of Belo Horizonte in the state of Minas Gerais, broke a canine tooth when he bit into the dog's neck to fend off an attack. Since then, he has been pampered in the studios of several TV stations, where he has been recounting his ordeal.<br />
<br />
&quot;I grabbed him by the neck and bit,&quot; he told O Globo newspaper. &quot;It's no big deal. It's better to lose a tooth than to lose your life.&quot;<br />
<br />
He was freed when bystanders pulled the dog off him and needed four stitches in his arm.<br />

<br />
NPR finally put a bullet in the Bryant Park Project last Friday, which was probably inevitable, given that they created a Web-centric alternative to their Morning Edition juggernaut and then were SHOCKED to discover radio stations didn't want to switch away from one of the most popular NPR shows and financially support the start-up.<br />
<br />
In any case, that leaves me looking for an hour or so daily news round-up that doesn't make me want to claw my eyes out. (Day to Day is pretty good, but then Slate's movie guy comes on and I want to commit a murder-suicide.)<br />
<br />
Anyone got a podcast like that? One that, like the BPP, that has actually heard of the Internet and talks about things that people under 50 care about would be ideal.</div>

				For most people, the idea of being judged insane and held in a 1950s asylum is the stuff of nightmares. But to be locked up when you are sane would be regarded as an appalling injustice. <br />
<br />
And yet a BBC investigation has revealed that nearly 50 women were locked in an isolation ward in a mental asylum in Surrey - not because they had a mental illness - but because they carried typhoid and were deemed a public health risk. <br />
<br />
They were held at Long Grove Hospital - a mental asylum in Surrey - which started admitting carriers of typhoid as early as 1907 and continued through the 1940s and 1950s. Once admitted, those women never left. <br />
<br />
One former nurse says that many of those women - admitted sane - deteriorated mentally, driven mad by the conditions they lived in. Others remained in full possession of their senses, despite enduring conditions such as solitary isolation. <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Typhoid fever <br />
<br />
It was 1992 when Long Grove finally closed. <br />
<br />
Forgotten women <br />
<br />
Medical archives - although sketchy - are held at the Surrey History Centre in Woking and historians working there discovered two tattered volumes in the derelict ruins of the old Long Grove building.<br />
<br />
Those records tell some of the story of the women who were held in the asylum; as do the nurses who cared for them. <br />
<br />
Jeannie Kennett started working at Long Grove in 1955. <br />
<br />
&quot;They are somebody's loved ones or somebody's mother or sister...everybody had forgotten about them,&quot; she says of her patients. <br />
<br />
&quot;They were just locked away.&quot; <br />
<br />
Typhoid generation <br />
<br />
 <br />
Typhoid carrier Rosina Bryans was held for 60 years <br />
<br />
Until the early 1950s, and the advent of antibiotic treatments, typhoid was a killer. One in five victims died of the disease. <br />
<br />
A typhoid carrier was someone recovering from typhoid fever; but who continued to secrete the bacterium in their faeces. <br />
<br />
The investigation has identified 43 women who were isolated as typhoid carriers in Long Grove. <br />
<br />
All the women came from the London area and on average between 1944 and 1957 three new carriers entered the unit every year. <br />
<br />
This is on a par with the total number of female typhoid carriers produced by the general population of London at that time. <br />
<br />
Jeanie Kennet was a ward manager when Long Grove was closed in 1992.   Twenty-six female typhoid carriers are strictly isolated. Most of them are however so deteriorated mentally that the restriction on their activities which results from their segregation is not likely to be felt by them as hardship. <br />
<br />
Annual report 1956 <br />
<br />
Life for the patients was tough. &quot;It was completely fenced in, and a gate that could only be opened with a key. All doors were locked,&quot; she says. <br />
<br />
&quot;They were seen as objects. And it was your duty to do the basics for them. It was prison-like. Everything was lock and key - everything.&quot; <br />
<br />
Former Ward sister May Heffernan described how members of staff refused to go inside the isolation ward and were made to scrub up carefully to prevent infection. <br />
<br />
&quot;When you entered the building, the first thing you did was put on a surgical gown, we also at times wore masks,&quot; she says. <br />
<br />
&quot;And when you flushed the toilet it was actually boiling water that flushed the toilets.&quot; <br />
<br />
 <br />
Two volumes of medical records were found in the ruins of Long Grove  <br />
<br />
Deterioration <br />
<br />
Aside from the indignity of being locked up for carrying a disease, many of those who worked at Long Grove believed their charges were far from mentally ill, at least at the beginning of their isolation. <br />
<br />
An inspection report from 1956 states that the women were &quot;so deteriorated mentally that the restriction on their activities … is not likely to be felt by them as hardship&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mrs Davies was a lovely lady. She was totally compos mentis, she knew every day - she had an excellent memory,&quot; says Jeanie Kennett, who nursed the women for more than 40 years. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 Mrs Davies was a lovely lady. She was totally compos mentis, she knew every day - she had an excellent memory <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Jeanie Kennett<br />
<br />
 <br />
&quot;She would have survived in the outside world; I don't think she was ever given that chance. <br />
<br />
&quot;She was there because she was a carrier and the outside world was frightened of these people.&quot; <br />
<br />
Using the death certificates of women who died on the ward, the lives of those in isolation can start to be pieced together. <br />
<br />
Mary Brooks came from Kensington and was a teacher. Ada Thompson was a cashier and a spinster. Many of the women were married and had children. <br />
<br />
Silent isolation <br />
<br />
With the discovery of antibiotics the number of typhoid carriers began to decline and in 1972 the isolation unit closed and most of the patients were transferred to other open wards in the hospital. <br />
<br />
  <br />
 I felt we should have allowed these people to die with dignity <br />
<br />
May Heffernan <br />
But two patients - Jennie French and Elizabeth Driver - were never cured. <br />
<br />
&quot;Both of those ladies were assigned a bedroom each and there they had to remain - they were not allowed to associate with the other ladies,&quot; says Ms Kennett. <br />
<br />
Elizabeth Driver was lucid and fully aware of her situation. <br />
<br />
&quot;She was just one person in a small room,&quot; says Kennett <br />
<br />
&quot;She had the daily paper when all the residents had finished with it, and she had a small television and that was her spice of life. <br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't see anyone come to see her.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mrs Driver lived like that for five or six years. <br />
<br />
60 years of solitude<br />
<br />
<br />
In 1992 when Long Grove closed Ms Heffernan was responsible for transferring the last surviving carriers to other mental hospitals - including one woman, Rosina Bryans, who was locked up for 60 years. <br />
<br />
&quot;All she ever knew was the inside to that hospital and the people that worked there,&quot; Ms Heffernan says. <br />
<br />
 DEATHS CHRONICLED <br />
Mary Brooks died on 20th October 1944<br />
Deduction - Emma Munnings died on the 7th May 1949 <br />
&quot;It wasn't a nice thing to do to these people - because they'd lived all of their life inside this place - and knew all of the people around them - and then suddenly they were moved about like parcels to another department. <br />
<br />
&quot;I felt we should have allowed these people to die with dignity.&quot; <br />
<br />
The Department of Health told the BBC that there is not, and never has been, &quot;a policy of incarcerating&quot; anyone, in this context. <br />
<br />
But at best these were women with mental health problems locked away in isolation - many for life. At worst, they were sane when they entered - and were driven mad by their incarceration. <br />
<br />

				During a Q&amp;A panel at the San Diego Comic-Con, Prince of Persia creator Jordan Mechner revealed that he is working on a followup to Karateka, the first video game he developed.<br />
<br />
Published in 1984 when Mechner was attending Yale University, Karateka featured impressive fluid animation that laid the groundwork for his influential 1989 game Prince of Persia.<br />
<br />
&quot;There actually is a plan to bring back Karateka,&quot; the designer said. &quot;It's a project I'm going to be involved in. I can safely say it's not going to be in the way you expect.&quot;<br />
<br />
Asked by Gamasutra whether the project is indeed a video game, Mechner confirmed that it is.<br />
<br />
Responding to a separate question about the original Karateka, Mechner recounted how he and one of the game's other programmers pulled off one of gaming's stranger Easter eggs.<br />
<br />
&quot;The programmer doing copy protection for the game figured out that by messing with the bit table, the whole game could be played upside down, which is really hard to do,&quot; he explained. &quot;We thought it would be hilarious if we burned the flipped version of the game to the other side of the disk.<br />
<br />
&quot;We figured of all the people who buy the game, a couple of them would accidentally put the floppy in upside down,&quot; he continued. &quot;That way, when that person calls tech support, that tech support rep would once in blue moon have the sublime joy of saying, 'Well sir, you put the disk in upside down,' and that person would think for the rest of their life that's how software works.&quot;<br />
<br />
As it turned out, brass at publisher Broderbund was receptive to the idea: &quot;We went do the president of Broderbund to propose this, and we didn't think they'd go for it, because it would require an assembly line change to actually burn the game onto both sides of the disk, which adds however many cents. So we went in, and he said, 'Sure. Do it.'&quot;

</div>I don't even remember being able to put 5.25 disks in upside down.</div>

				THat is what I am saying!  He had no taste at all to run things.  Once someone says mean things to him or questions him he gets indignant and mad and quit.  That plus I think he really underestimated how much time it would take.  <br />
<br />
Believe it or not, I warned him.  We needed someone popular with a brain in his head but I worried about his thin skin.  <br />
<br />
Pretty happy with Voca so far, she does not seem to let things bother her so much - she also trys to deal with me when I bother her.  Once Cam decided he did not want to be king here, I think he felt no choice but to leave - shame really, lots of people enjoyed his &quot;I know that celebrity&quot; or :I have an expensive stereo&quot; posts.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I picked this up on BD the other night, and... I can't really find the words to describe how awe inspiring this whole thing is. If you haven't seen the series, I highly recommend it. The whole connectedness of our world really sinks in, and you can't help but appreciate how vast and beautiful this planet is. It makes me want to travel a lot more than I have in the past, and I'm not exactly a little travelled person to begin with. Two thumbs up!</div>

But then the reality of your day-to-day life prevented you from fulfilling this dream. Don't let this happen again. Although you might not be able to leave on your great adventure today, setting a plan in motion takes time. It's a mistake to think you can't do it just because you didn't pull it off last time.</i><br />

As Logical and scientific-minded as others say I am, I still love Astrology, Tarot, Blood types, numerology, and such things.</div>
