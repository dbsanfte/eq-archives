Beer and lager should only be available either in cans or Red Plastic Solo Cups.  And pub that uses glass mugs would be shut down permanently at the first Glassing.  And Glassing should be a crime with a penalty of no less than 10 years' imprisonment.<br />

			<div class="message">Some stats and figures from my line of work and area.<br />
<br />
80 to 90% of all domestic violence is committed by men against women. When you look at repeat high risk cases, that figure rises to 95% or so.<br />
<br />
80%+ of robberies are committed by men. <br />
<br />
90% of knife crime committed by men. <br />
<br />
95% of gun crime committed by men. <br />
<br />
Murders - of the 8 homicides last year in my area, 100% committed by men. <br />
<br />
Even when you drill down to the 'lesser' violent crimes (Assault with injury etc.), you are still looking at an 75%+ rate of male suspects. <br />
<br />
Violence is predominantly a crime committed by men - and outside of DV, generally against men as well. Young men in particular make up the majority of victims and offenders for these crimes.</div>

folk have tried to do exactly that and I'm all for it! (banning the use of glass containers)<br />
but..you get this same basic problem/excuse coming up:<br />
those who genuinely enjoy a drink, especially of whisky and some other things, hate plastic glasses, doesn't taste as good out of them (seriously, it doesn't)<br />
So, many retailers/pubs were against it, but others supported it...and thus never got passed as a by-law<br />
<br />
best mate was a bouncer, some bastard bottled a fella and my pal got big slice up back of his head from bits flying everywhere.<br />
<br />
lot of the violence though occurs when folk leave, or when folk are sitting aorund drinking in parks etc (hence one reaosn they brought in anti-drinking-in-public laws)<br />
Buckfast bottles are notoriously thick and heavy, can easily cave your skull in never mind slash, indeed, it's so well known the necks of the bottles are that strong, they smash the bottle, leaving them with a neck of ragged glass they then plunge poor sods with. <br />
Cops and others been demanding for years that shit gets sold in plastic bottles, but hey, money talks....<br />

			Why I investigated Buckfast wine <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A BBC Scotland investigation into Buckfast Tonic Wine has uncovered new evidence about links between the drink and violence.<br />
<br />
It has led to calls for the monks who produce Buckfast to make it available in plastic bottles rather than glass.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
By Kenneth Macdonald <br />
Special correspondent, BBC Scotland <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Buckfast tasting at Harvey Nichols<br />
 <br />
This investigation had no agenda.<br />
<br />
Rather than start from the standpoint that this humble tonic wine was a &quot;bad thing&quot;, we simply wanted to find out why it had acquired a reputation, particularly in the central belt, as Scotland's &quot;commotion lotion&quot;. <br />
<br />
What became clear was that Buckfast is a cultural phenomenon with an impact far greater than its tiny share of the Scottish drinks market would suggest. <br />
<br />
We asked Strathclyde Police about the drink using the Freedom Of Information Act. <br />
<br />
They told us that Buckfast was mentioned in more than 5,000 crime reports over the last three years. <br />
<br />
That works out as an average of about three offences a day. <br />
<br />
More worryingly one in 10 of those offences was a violent one.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Buckfast was mentioned in more than 5,000 crime reports<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Buckfast 'in 5,000 crime reports'<br />
<br />
Freedom of Information request<br />
 <br />
<br />
I spoke to Supt Bob Hamilton of Strathclyde Police's violence reduction unit, who says the figures show there is an association with violence. <br />
<br />
&quot;The figures are fairly clear that Buckfast is mentioned in a number of crime reports,&quot; he says. <br />
<br />
&quot;Over the period requested the Buckfast bottle was used 114 times as a weapon.&quot; <br />
<br />
This echoes a study carried out in 2007 at Polmont Young Offenders Institution. <br />
<br />
It found that of those offenders who had been drinking immediately before their offence, more than 40% had been drinking Buckfast. <br />
<br />
The man who conducted that research, Alasdair Forsyth, says the findings were remarkable. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is a product, a brand which unusually for any product, is always trumpeting how few units they sell, that they sell less than half of 1% of all the alcohol in Scotland,&quot; he says.<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Chris Henery had to get 34 stitches in his head after being hit by a bottle<br />
 <br />
<br />
&quot;So it begs the question why should it be that 43% of violent offences, or offences involving alcohol and young offenders should be that one product.&quot; <br />
<br />
Buckfast's distribution company, J Chandler &amp; Co, denies there is any causal link between crime and the wine. <br />
<br />
But there are further concerns over its packaging. <br />
<br />
Buckfast comes in a glass bottle. And the worry is that its association with violence might mean that the bottle is available as a weapon. <br />
<br />
Chris Henery was travelling on a bus when he was confronted by a young man with a bottle of Buckfast. <br />
<br />
&quot;He starts sort of hitting it … off of the cushion of the seat,&quot; Chris told me. <br />
<br />
&quot;And I'm just kind of tensing up, like he's right in my way and I can't get by him basically. And then he just smashes the bottle off one of the green poles. <br />
<br />
&quot;And that's when he hit me there. I didn't really feel it at the time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then I turned round,&quot; he said, &quot;and that's when I noticed the blood. I thought it was my nose because I couldn't really feel anything.<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Jim Wilson said plastic bottles could be trialled if the government paid for it<br />
 <br />
<br />
&quot;It's not my nose and I just kind of felt that whole bit of my head just hanging off.&quot; <br />
<br />
Three years on, Chris thinks Buckfast could adopt a simple solution. <br />
<br />
&quot;If it was in a plastic bottle at the time then the guys wouldn't have a weapon on them and I probably wouldn't have 34 stitches in my head,&quot; he says. <br />
<br />
But Jim Wilson, the spokesman for J Chandler &amp; Co, says the company will be sticking with glass because the cost of changing to plastic would be &quot;horrendous&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;We have said to the government if they think it's such a major problem … you fund it and we'll be happy to put a product in a trial and if it works, then we'll put all our sizes into it,&quot; he says. <br />
<br />
&quot;They probably take the first thing to hand. It so happens if it's a Buckfast bottle, it's a Buckfast bottle. <br />
<br />
&quot;It could be a whisky bottle, it could be a gin bottle, it could be any kind of bottle as long as it's handy.&quot; <br />

			Why are girls fighting like boys? <br />

By Tom Geoghegan <br />
BBC News Magazine <br />
<br />
<br />
The sight of two girls having a post-pub fight still has the power to shock, although it often happens between men. Why are women doing it and why are we so offended by it?<br />
 <br />
<br />
&quot;I've beaten a boy up with a stiletto high heel and left him unconscious,&quot; says one 17-year-old.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I got locked up last year for putting a woman in a coma and she nearly died because I tried to throw her in front of a car,&quot; says another. &quot;Then in October I got out from a sentence for nearly running a woman over.&quot;<br />
 <br />

<br />
<br />
Mean Girls is on Radio 1Xtra on Wednesday 8 May at 1500 BST<br />
<br />
Or catch up at the station website<br />
 <br />
That these words are uttered by teenage girls is somehow more shocking than if they were said by young men.<br />
 According to the annual statistics of the Youth Justice Board, the number of violent offences committed by girls aged 10 to 17 has nearly doubled in three years.<br />
 <br />
In 2002/3, there were 8,702 girls convicted of violence against another person, a figure that rose to 15,525 in 2005/6. During that period the number committed by boys rose 50% to 39,136.<br />
 <br />
There have been some high-profile examples. In 2005, there was widespread disgust during the trial of four youths who kicked to death a barman on London's South Bank.<br />
 <br />
The court was told that Chelsea O'Mahoney, 15 at the time, had filmed the attack on her phone and delivered the last kick &quot;like a football&quot; to Mr Morley's head.<br />
 <br />
The following year Claire Marsh, 18, became one of the youngest women to be convicted of rape, after pinning down another woman and encouraging a gang to participate in the assault in west London.<br />
 <br />
In a scrap <br />
<br />
These reports still jolt society in a post-feminist age, partly because they are so rare and partly because women are not expected to be aggressive.<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It took years for women to be allowed to box<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
For a group of teenage girls in south London aged 16 to 18, interviewed by Radio 1Xtra, violence is a part of everyday life.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Girl on girl fighting, scrapping, it's become the norm now,&quot; says one. <br />
<br />
It's usually based on territory, they say, and happens between their all-female group and other groups of girls from different estates, often preceded by verbal sparring, rumour and gossip.<br />
 <br />
They usually just use fists, but have known bottles, knives and even pieces of wood to be brandished. Binge drinking and drugs are the main reasons they give for getting physical.<br />
 <br />
One teenager with 20 violent offences to her name says: &quot;It's only when I've had a drink and I think I'm on top of the world and I think I can take on everybody. I know I shouldn't but I can't help myself when I've had a drink.&quot;<br />
 <br />
A police report last week suggests that the number of women arrested for being drunk and disorderly has increased by more than 50% in parts of the UK in the past five years.<br />
 <br />
Offenders at New Hall female prison in West Yorkshire say they used to get into fights to impress older boys. And one talks about the adrenaline release of fighting: &quot;Even when I get hit myself I get a rush from it.&quot;<br />
 <br />
'No shame' <br />
<br />
But Victim Support says the main underlying reason for this aggression is people growing up in violent homes or suffering abuse at the hands of a partner. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Even when I get hit myself I get a rush from it<br />

Teenage girl<br />
 <br />
<br />
A study by criminologist Susan Batchelor, of the University of Glasgow contradicts previous thinking that unlike in men, for women it's a spontaneous lack of control for which they afterwards felt ashamed.<br />
 <br />
Her report suggests female displays of aggression have a function within a group.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Such violence was considered deeply meaningful; it served to maintain group solidarity, reinforce friendships, affirm allegiances, and enhance personal status within the group.&quot;<br />
 <br />
The peer group always plays a large part in it, says consultant clinical psychologist Elie Godsi, author of Violence and Society: Making Sense of Madness and Badness.<br />
 <br />
&quot;There's a lot more of a 'ladette' culture where young women are aping and mimicking the traditional behaviour young men engage in.<br />
 <br />
&quot;So there's a small element of that, although I wouldn't put too much [importance] on it.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Many young people feel alienated from their family and community, he says, so the peer group plays a big part in gang culture, causing behaviour that the individual on her own would not contemplate.<br />
 <br />
But it's important to remember that overall, women only commit 10% of violent crimes, he says.<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It's not all scratches and pulling hair<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
They are innately less aggressive, whether by nature or nurture, which is why society reacts so strongly to it.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Women are defined in terms of relationships - as mothers, daughters, wives - and men are defined as individuals, in terms of achievements or work status or what they do, rather than how they relate to each other.<br />
 <br />
&quot;So violent women are perceived in far worst terms and it takes more for them to be violent.<br />
 <br />
&quot;But you only have to look at how Myra Hindley was treated as an icon. A lot more men are far more violent than her and given far lighter sentences. Generally we perceive women who don't fit into traditional roles in extreme terms.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Mr Godsi believes the increase in female violence merely reflects the general rise in violence since the mid-80s.<br />
 <br />
And the reasons for it - more destructive households and more alcohol abuse - are not peculiar to women. <br />
<br />
So we shouldn't necessarily be looking for reasons behind female aggression, he says, but asking why society as a whole seems to be tacitly encouraging violence. <br />

Those figures are actual figures for 2011/12 for one area in London, based on last years performance data. <br />
<br />
Whilst there is certainly evidence to suggest that reporting of DV committed by women against men is under reported, levels of DV by men against women continues to be under reported significantly. Your article says 75%, we've seen levels between 80% to 90%. Theres not much difference there. Where violence that requires medical attention and / or a fatality occurs men are absolutely the most significant offender. <br />
<br />
(NB we are one of the few areas in the country that has a specialist support service for male victims of DV, so you would expect that our figures would show a slightly higher proportion of male victims given we have a support service available and advertise it).<br />
<br />
N.B. all data is from publicly available sources.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">On a rounder note re violence, current thinking about reducing violence is to treat it as a public health issue, rather than a criminal justice issue. Some of the largest reductions in violence (Boston, Cincinatti, Strathclyde in Glasgow, Cardiff) have been achieved through using a public health approach to the issue that treats violence as a symptom of something else. <br />
<br />
The something else is often employment or housing, but can also be mental health issues. Depression in young men manifests as violence and rage in most cases, and over one third of young men have an untreated mental health issue when they enter the criminal justice system in the UK for example.</blockquote>

			80 to 90% of all domestic violence is committed by men against women. When you look at repeat high risk cases, that figure rises to 95% or so.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>Can you provide a citation for this?  I have seen otherwise.  What I've seen is that domestic violence rates are remarkably similar between men and women, the difference is that male on female DV is more severe on average.<br />
