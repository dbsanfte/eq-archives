        I take a moment to introduce myself. My name is Graff&euml; M'yrddin and 
        I am a Dark Elf Wizard in the Norrath lands of Xegony. During the beginning 
        of Everquest, I searched and waited for a 'Wizard-only' website. Time 
        passed and nothing arose. So I decided to take matters into my own hands 
        and create this site for us, mana throwing individuals. Feel free to send

The patch is in but the servers are still down. There really isn't any 
        huge changes to anything that effects the wizard class, but here are some 
        things that relate to us -</p>
      <ul>
        <li>/assist changed and improved. It should be much more reliable now. 
          It also will target whatever the assisted person has targeted. The assisted 
          person does not need to have auto-attack on for /assist to work.</li>
        <li>Translocate now has the proper spell gem.</li>

April Fools!  The site isn't going anywhere.  With that long post this morning, I was slammed with e-mails that just made me feel so awful.  So many heart-wrenching stories and thank you's.  Even though it was a joke, there was a small bit of seriousness to it.  That's probably why it got so many people.  Yes, you can count me in as one of the discouraged wizards.  Yes, I created a monk.  But even with this, I wouldn't go anywhere.  I still have faith that the wizard class can be all we've ever hoped it can be.  It's just going to take a tad bit more patience with Verant... and possibly a large amount of explosives.</p>

        After reading Graffe's post, I am sorry to say that I cannot really blame 
        him. Please don't let this discourage your from playing your wizard. Really, 
        if you enjoy the class, more power to you, but... If you don't enjoy the 
        long med times, and relatively weak power output, etc., maybe you should 
        try out another class, after all, this game is for one thing, fun. Leveling, 
        old world uber raids, and teleportation are pretty much all wizards are 
        good for, and none of these is really much fun.<BR>

        post something like this in the news, but I have pretty much quit playing 
        EQ since I got my epic, and lost interest in the game. Of all people, 
        Graffe is the last one I thought would give up on the class. Leaving the 
        game is one thing, but quitting the class is another... Some of you might 
        disagree, or have some words of inspiration, if you do, please send them 
        our way, maybe we will be able to find the light again. 8(</p>

      <p><img src="/home/purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="8">Another Wizard 
        Retires:<br>
        This morning I was sitting in my office, tying my shoes and reading the 
        forums here. I found a thread that asked how many people have retired 
        their wizard. I wanted to post to it but I was hesitant (besides I was 
        running late). So while I was riding my motorcyle to work I was thinking 
        about things. I don't know if I should feel ashamed about it but I do 
        think you all should know.. mainly because it is going to directly effect 
        all of you. Here it goes.. I no longer play a wizard. I haven't for some 
        time. I was so close to deleting Graffe but I just couldn't do it. He's 
        still on my account but there he sits.. collecting dust. What made me 
        do it, you ask? Well, I got sick of Verant's inept ability to help out 
        struggling class. Time and time again we were told &quot;you are fine&quot;, 
        &quot;we won't be adjusting the balance of wizards&quot;, &quot;wizards 
        are whiners&quot;. The final capper was the recent update to the class 
        description found on Verant's site. What a kick in the face. Then the 
        'Bane' spells... *laf*. Whoopiee.. a new nuke that will do nothing but 
        be an uber-taunt. Not to mention both spells are level 60. Wizards are 
        THE ONLY true caster in the game and we get no bonus to our mana pool, 
        our mana to damage ratio is weak, and we can't use our 'power' unless 
        we want a quick ride back out our bind point. So I hope someone at Verant 
        reads this.. I've been patient far too long. Wizards are a dying breed... 
        and one more just died. All is not gone though. I created a monk and I 
        love the class (I actually created a bard too). But.. the reason I am 
        writing this is because I think the site here is going to be put on the 
        side and not getting the attention it used to. The reason? I can only 
        back a class that I enjoy.. so I decided to create a monk dedicated site. 
        <a href="../monk/index.htm" target="_blank">Donstep's Dojo</a>. Sorry 
        everyone... I tried to hold out for as long as I could.</p>

        Today's Patch (sheesh was it long..) is finally done and here are some 
        things that pertain to us as wizards -</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A new teleportation spell has been added to the game for both Druids 
          and Wizards. These are self-only gate spells to the Dreadlands. These 
          spells should be available on the more exclusive spell vendors in Norrath.</li>
        <li>Increased the drop rate on some Kunark spells to coincide with the 
          narrowing of the creatures carrying those spells as the game evolves.</li>
        <li>Wizards now have access to a new type of spell that only works on 
          certain types of target. Generically called 'bane' spells, a few are 
          now available in the game. May your quest for such spells be successful</li>
        <li>Added /showspelleffects. Using this toggle ('on' or 'off') a player 
          can turn on or off the display of particle effects for spells. This 
          will only affect spells, not world effects like waterfalls or weapon 
          particle effects.  This should allow you to turn off many of the effects 
          that hamper rendering performance, inducing effects of spells, while 
          still being able to see some of the awesome effects, like those on certain 
          paladin weapons...</li>
        <li>The spell slot number will now show up in front of the spell name 
          when you press Alt to cast a spell using the Alt-Spell Number method.</li>
        <li>We're now sending hitpoint updates to the casters of direct damage 
          spells no matter how far away they are when the spell lands. This will 
          allow those casters that try to stand as far back as possible to get 
          updates even when their range indicates that the messages should be 
          surpressed.</li>

        The report that the human skeleton had been moved to an easier location

        location due to numerous things such as aggroing a player, killing that 
        player, and then not returning to it's spawn location. This could have 
        very well been what happened in this instance. So for all of you thinking

        Pandur sent word that the human skeleton in the City of Mist has been 
        moved to an more accessable location. Here's more - 
      <blockquote> "Just wanted to let you know that the human skelleton in CoM 
        was moved down to the first level. I completed the quest after the last 
        patch. A enc friend wanted to pull the skelleton from the 2nd floor, but 
        found it just right of the bridge beside a golem that you can see when 
        you head to the gate. It was absolutly no problem for a level 54 to pull 
        it single to the entrance and charm it. Like before you can hear it casting 
        when you stand at the bridge if it is up. The TT and KC skellis are still 
        at their old locations. Seems like it is much easier now for us wizards 
        to get this really usefull spell." </blockquote>

        Tomorrow:<br>
        Okay.. not a huge patch, just one that should correct an bug in our epic 
        quest. On the Network Status page, Verant gives the following information 
        - 
      <blockquote> "All servers will have the Plane of Fear zone down on Tuesday, 
        March 20th, at 3AM PST, for a quick patch. Estimated downtime is 30 minutes. 
        <p> -The EverQuest Operations Team 
      </blockquote>
      The reason for this patch? Well, that little change to our epic quest that 
      went in with the last patch got miffed the day after. Here's what Ester 
      said concerning a fellow wizard's, Linxs, post on the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum3/HTML/007512.html" target="_blank">Bug 
      Board</a> - 
      <blockquote> "We will look into it today. We will try it on test and if 
        it works there I'll go to a live server and try it. Thank you for all 
        the informaion, you guys made this much easier to figure out!" </blockquote>
      Now if you want to go keep tabs on all of the happenings with the quest 
      in this department, stay tuned to <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm5.showMessage?topicID=1064.topic">this

      some spells in your pack that you'd like to trade for others, bring them 
      along.

        Todays patch message is in, and these are the items that directly effect 
        us as wizards -</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed a bug that allowed exploitation of the period of time between 
          character control being established and loading of character faction 
          tables.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed the Dagger of Frost. Its special item flags were improperly 
          removed in the last patch.</li>
        <li>Rewards for former &quot;boss npcs&quot; have been moved down to underlings 
          that are roughly as powerful as the old bosses were. <i>(Cazic's Skin 
          for our epic quest should now drop on lower mobs..).</i></li>
        <li> 
          <p>As part of the Plane updates, we've made several adjustments to Epic 
            quests for a number of classes. Previously, questers of many classes 
            were put in direct competition with regular non-questing adventurers 
            for a few coveted spawns. In these cases, a new step has been added 
            to separate the &quot;Epic Encounter&quot; NPCs from the &quot;Epic 
            Quest&quot; NPCs. For those who are mid-quest, all quest requirements 
            have remained the same. In other words, if you turn the same items 
            into the same NPC, the same reward applies. What has changed is that 
            some components may be in a different location from where you expect 
            them. It is recommended that you check with the last NPC in line or 
            other adventurers to find where you need to go next.</p>

        Bug:<br>
        Just a warning so as to not waste some peridots - 
      <blockquote> "just the other day, i had the pleasure of grouping with a 
        very high level druid. he had the spell protection of the glades (potg), 
        which has several effects, one of which is a mana regen. when i first 
        grouped with him, i had manaskin in effect. he then cast potg on the group. 
        the 2 spells stacked. later as the fighting wore on and my manaskin spell 
        expired, i tried to renew the spell with another cast, only to receive 
        the message "your spell did not hold". at first i thought i was hallucinating, 
        then i cast again and noticed that not only did i use up mana, but the 
        spell component, a peridot, had been consumed. i sent a bug report in 
        and i hope that this will be fixed soon. a few patches ago, i believe 
        this sort of incident had been fixed, letting casters save mana and components. 
        but as this is not yet so, i just wish to let all other wizards know of 
        this occurrence as it can be quite expensive for us.

      This has been forwarded onto Verant in hopes of getting it resolved.

        I just wanted to say thank you to everyone that stopped by Xegony on Thursday 
        for the belated birthday party that was held for me. So many people <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('../screenpics/graffe_bday_01a.jpg','graffebday01','width=660,height=500')">showed 
        up</a>, I was amazed. All weekend I was continually getting tells from 
        people logging onto Xegony from other servers and saying hello. You guys 
        are great.. it really meant a lot to me. Trust me, I lost the 'happiness' 
        that comes with birthdays quite a few years ago.. but you all brought 
        that back this year. I think the funniest thing was at about 4pm I got 
        a tell from a guide wishing me a happy birthday and also (in a joking 
        manner) wanted me to get some of you to stop making characters named 'Hapybdaygraff', 
        'Grafferules', and the such.. Hahaha! I guess the guides/GM's finally 
        gave up on rejecting the names because quite a few showed up at the party. 
        Apprentice guide Taylon and guide Parala stopped by and dropped off some 
        more birthday cake.. thanks guys! Also, I found out there is no faction 
        hit for <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('../screenpics/graffe_bday_01b.jpg','graffebday02','width=660,height=500')">killing

        II:<br>
        Ailwyn of Veeshan sent in an e-mail eariler this week stating that the 
        wizard Al'Kabor visited his server. Here's more from Ailwyn -<br>
      </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>&quot;..many wizards on the Veeshan server had the pleasure to meet 
          Al'Kabor. He came stating he wanted a component for his research. I 
          tried a Frost Crystal but he said he did not need that component anymore. 
          He stated he needed something from a big creature that dwelled around 
          the area. We figured he wanted something off a yeti so we went to find 
          what he wanted. Twiddle, a 46 wizard, managed to find what Al'Kabor 
          wanted. He wanted a Frosty Datura, a flower, off of a Yeti. Al'Kabor 
          rewarded Twiddle with Journal 1, spell: Inferno of Al'Kabor, and 500pp. 
          I talked with Al'Kabor some and he gave me Journal 2&quot;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Being that Ailwyn received the second journal from Al'Kabor, this rounded 
        out the collection of journals found on this site (#2 had always been 
        missing). If you want to check out what Joural II says, you can visit 
        the page just created for all of the Al'Kabor info.</p>

        The name of the second zone mentioned in the previous news is actually 
        called Stonebrunt Mountains. From what Brad said, it will be added a bit 
        later this year. Here is a link to his post concerning the new zones on 
        the Official Sony Forums -

      <p><img src="/home/purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="8">New Zone Pics:<br>
        Last night Graffe mentioned a new zone called Warrens was loaded onto 
        the Test Server. This morning I logged onto the Test Server and had a 
        look around as well as took some pictures. Warren's seems to be a low 
        to medium dungeon inhabited by kobolds. The zone is located off of Tox 
        Forest. Here are some sample pictures -</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="../screenpics/warren01.jpg" target="_blank">Warrens Kobold 
          Den</a></li>
        <li><a href="../screenpics/warren02.jpg" target="_blank">Warrens Hall</a></li>
        <li><a href="../screenpics/warren03.jpg" target="_blank">Warrens Throne</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Besides the Warren Zone, there is supposedly one more zone rumored to 
        be going in called something like the Ridge Plains. However, I'm not sure 
        on the correct name.</p>
