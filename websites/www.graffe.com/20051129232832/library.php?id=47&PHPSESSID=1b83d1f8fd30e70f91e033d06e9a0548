    Minimum Level: 51<br>
    Maximum Level: 53<br>
    Zone Name: The Dreadlands<br>
    Camp Area/LOC: South Side of Karnors Castle<br>
    Mob List (HP): Drovlargs (Rager, Ravishings),Cockatrice (Petrafier)<br>
    Availability (1-&gt;10): 8 (no shortage of mobs in DL sometimes)<br>
    Loot Ranking (1-&gt;10): 6 (about 4pp / doggie)<br>
    Diff.Ranking (1-&gt;10): 4<br>
    Faction Affected: Pack of Tomar decreased<br>
    <br>
    Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: You need Pillar of Frost (level 51) and SOW to 
    quad the Drovlargs. Pull them from the southeast ruins area and quad them 
    along the south side of KC. There is hardly anyone along the south side. In 
    case of problems, such as a spider &quot;add&quot;, you can zone into KC to clear 
    aggro. With KEI, you can get serious non-stop XP quadding the doggies, and 
    you also impress the lower levels when you run by with four angry Drovlargs 
    behind you. It helps to have the tflux for pulling. This is a great spot for 
    someone to go 100% AA to pick up three easy points for Runspeed3. Once you 
    hit 51, get your spells, go 100% AA, and start quadding your first 3 AA's.<br>
    <br>
    Keep your wizzy familiar up and do not turn anon or roleplay on. I made 
    about 600pp+ a night between loot drops and TL requests.<br>
    <br>
    Rager Drovlargs are light blue at about 53. At that point only the 
    Ravishings are DB and they are few and far between.</span><p>
