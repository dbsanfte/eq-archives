 <p>Deep in the bottom of the mines in Thurgadin resides a Coldain drawf 
  named Normon Stonetooth. You can reach him by going into the mines invis, 
  taking first right, going down a ladder, then hopping over three sections of 
  rail, then entering a large room, taking a left, then a right. He's behind a 
  large chunk of crystals. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>You say</b>, 'hail Normon Stonetooth' <br>
    Normon Stonetooth seems to ignore your greeting, peering at the stone in 
    front of him intently as if reading some invisible text. After a long while 
    he sighs deeply and says, 'Somethin I kin help ye with, whoever you are?'
    </p>
    <p><b>You say</b>, 'who are you talking to?' <br>
    Normon Stonetooth speaks as he continues staring at the stone, 'I mine. So 
    they call me a miner. Name's Normon, Normon Stonetooth, Normon the 
    miner..,Did I say I mine?' </p>
    <p><b>You say</b>, 'what do you mine?' <br>
    Normon Stonetooth says 'Well I look fer Velium acourse. But ye know, I pull 
    very little of it out o the mundane rock these days. Sometimes I hear it 
    whisperin to me. The stone, the Velium, everything down here talks to each 
    other. If ye're lucky enough they tell ya secrets. That be why I listen more 
    these days than pull Velium. </p>
    <p><b>You say</b>, 'what secrets?' <br>
    Normon Stonetooth snickers and says, ' Now iffn I told ye that it wouldn't 
    be a secret no more now would it? No, I cant tell ya what they tells me, but 
    I kin help ya ta listen. But first ye'll need ta do me a favor heheh.' </p>
    <p><b>You say</b>, 'What favor?'<br>
    Normon Stonetooth says 'Ahh, well me pick is a bit dull, don't cut like it 
    should. Up in the city proper ye kin find a weapons smith named Hakon. Take 
    me pick axe and and tell him Stonetooth sent ye. Then give it to him, wait 
    fer him ta sharpen it, an bring it back to me. Then I'll help ya ta listen 
    to the stone.' </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Hakon is in a weapon shop near the bank in Thurgadim. Give Hakon the Pick 
  Axe and "a small piece of velium" (these are the stackable kind from Crystal 
  Caverns, dropped off orc miners).</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Hakon Brightsteel says</b> 'Excellent! I'll get ta work now.' Hakon 
    whistles an unfamiliar tune as he repairs and sharpens the pick axe. 'Here 
    ye are Zeldan . Watch that old Stonetooth, he's a few steins short of a keg, 
    if ye know what I mean' </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>You get the pick back plus the following faction adjustments: Coldain 
  (better), DainFrostreaverIV (better), Kromzek (worse), and Kromrif (worse). Go 
  back into the mines and return the pick axe to Normon. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Normon Stonetooth says</b> 'Ahhhh, good work Tashia. Now ta speak with 
    the stone ye need somethin ta focus on. Use this piece o Velium as yer 
    focus. Ta speak the language o the stone ye need ta slow down like the 
    stone. Rock looks like it don't move but it does, just real slow. So place 
    yer focus on the stones ye wish ta speak with and get yerself real slow, 
    both yer body an yer noggin. Then if yer quiet enough ye might hear 'em. An 
    that's what's to it. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>You receive an item in return called a
  <a onclick="MM_openBrWindow('velium_focus.jpg','veliumfocusstat','width=330,height=145')" href="javascript:;">
  Velium Focus</a>. You then bring this Velium Focus item to Phenocryst, a named 
  geonid in Wakening Land at -3210, -397 inside a maze of caves. You can hail 
  him and such, the geonids conning indifferent to everybody as far as I can 
  tell. <i>It's very important to note that although geonids con indifferent or 
  amiable, goo does not and if you get any of it on you and a geonid is close 
  by, it'll aggro the geonid. No idea why this is, it doesn't make any sense, 
  but it's the case.</i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>You say</b>, hail Phenocryst. <br>
    Phenocryst speaks with a soundless voice, as if you are hearing your own 
    thoughts. 'We sense you are attempting communication with us but do not 
    understand what it is you are trying to convey. We are eager to know more. 
    Perhaps there is one who knows the language of the stone and will speak with 
    us' </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Hand Phenocryst the Velium Focus. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Phenocryst speaks to you from within your mind, 'You know the stone! This 
    is wonderful! The fullfillment of the prophecy is now one step closer. The 
    most ancient of the stone tells us that one not of stone will come forth and 
    act as our harbringer of asscention. We believe you to be our harbringer. 
    Please help us!' </p>
    <p><b>You say</b>, 'how can I help you?'<br>
    Phenocryst speaks from within your mind as well as conveys a sense of joy 
    empathically. 'It is said that the harbringer will find all of our people 
    and unite them. When we join we will know all of our experiences and perhaps 
    then be aware of how to proceed with the next step in our asscention. We 
    implore you to find others like us and make them aware of us. You know the 
    language of the stone and can tell them. We await your return with proof 
    that you have spoken to them." </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now you have to go to Crystal Caverns. If you invis up and head down into 
  the caverns, you'll pass through an orc area, then a dwarf area, then a 
  tentacle terror and spiders area, and finally there's a long stretch of tunnel 
  leading up to a zone out point. That long stretch of tunnel is filled with 
  geonids and they con the same as the ones in Wakening Land. Give one of them 
  the focus (any one, doesn't matter, you don't have to hail them or anything) 
  and you'll get it back with the following message: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A geonid seems as if it doesn't recognize you as anything of importance. 
    You attempt to speak with the geonid through your velium focus but all you 
    are able to hear is the same though over and over.., Eat. You have gained no 
    knowledge from these creatures but you notice your focus has been altered 
    slightly.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The description on the focus doesn't change, but it is altered. Take it 
  back to Phenocryst in Wakening Land and give it to him. The following will 
  happen:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Phenocryst sends it's thoughts to you, a feeling of disappointment washes 
    over you, 'It seems the others are not aware of themselves yet. We are 
    alone..So many questions yet we can find no answers. We have been given a 
    very special gift but without direction we are lost. We must find who has 
    made us aware of ourselves and why it has done so.' </p>
    <p>You say to Phenocryst, "Find what?" <br>
    Phenocryst says in the form of thoughts, 'We must call to it. We must make 
    ourselves heard past these rocks though. A menhir must be constructed to 
    amplify our voice. The stones we will need are not found in this area 
    though. We hear whispers of stones far away that have the ability to channel 
    and amplify our thoughts. We ask you to gather these stones for us 
    harbinger." </p>
    <p>You say to Phenocryst, "I will gather these stones for you." <br>
    Phenocryst's thoughts flood your mind, 'Thank you Harbinger. We need 3 
    crystals. One of Beryl, one of Stibnite, and one of the purest Iron. These 
    minerals will only be found deep within the earth where the geology is 
    relatively stable. This Focus will aid you in finding the right crystals. 
    Return it to me with the 3 crystals and we will construct our Menhir. Please 
    hurry Harbinger, our prophecy awaits. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Phenocryst gives you an item for telling him you'll gather the stones. It's 
  a magic, lore, no drop
  <a onclick="MM_openBrWindow('elbaite_focus.jpg','elbaitefocus','width=330,height=145')" href="javascript:;">
  Elbaite Focus</a> that has 5 charges of Identify. It looks like a fire 
  emerald. </p>
  <p><b>The stibnite crystal </b>is found in The Great Divide. If you enter the 
  wurm caves in the center of that zone from the south, go up to the first 
  right, go in and take the next right, you'll be in a room with two spawn 
  points for wurms and there's a patch of blue crystal at the back of the room. 
  The stibnite is behind the crystals and looks like a bag on the floor. It 
  spawns every 1-2 hours or so I think. The description of the item is "<a onclick="MM_openBrWindow('bent_metallic_crystal.jpg','bentmetalliccrystalstats','width=330,height=145')" href="javascript:;">Bent 
  Metallic Crystal</a>". It weights 20.0, is magic, lore, and no drop. When you 
  identify it, it identifies as "Stibnite for the Menhir". To identify an item 
  using the Elbaite Focus, target yourself, pick up the item and right click it 
  on the Elbaite Focus in your inventory. It won't change the description of the 
  item, it'll just tell you what it is in your chat window. </p>
  <p><b>The Beryl crystal </b>is in Split Paw. This crystal spawns deep in Paw 
  behind one of the stone pillars near the entrance of the underwater tunnel 
  leading to the Ishva area (+690, -17). The item is called a
  <a onclick="MM_openBrWindow('reddish_crystal.jpg','reddishcrystalstats','width=330,height=145')" href="javascript:;">
  Reddish Crystal</a> and it's also magic, lore, and no drop. It weighs 10.0. It 
  identifies as "Beryl for the Menhir". </p>
  <p><b>The crystal of purest iron</b> is in Burning Woods. It's sitting on the 
  bottom edge of the crashed meteor (+842, -1179) near Slixin Klex and it looks 
  like a bag on the ground. It's item description is "<a onclick="MM_openBrWindow('heavy_metallic_crystal.jpg','heavymetalliccrystalsstats','width=330,height=145')" href="javascript:;">Heavy 
  Metallic Crystal</a>" and is magic, lore, and no drop. It weighs 14.0. </p>
  <p>Take these three crystals and the Elbaite Focus back to Wakening Lands to 
  Phenocryst and you're ready for the next step. Get 1-2 parties of 50+ players 
  and bring 'em with you. Due to the dragon that spawns in Wakening Land near 
  the dragon portal, you might want to approach from skyshrine. If you're going 
  along the wall from skyshrine towards the caves, you want to gather your 
  troops at the second cave entrance along the wall. Phenocryst is closest to 
  that entrance. Get to know the path between you and him at this point so 
  you're familiar with how to get out in a hurry. At this point, all the geonids 
  should con amiable to you. Finishing the Velium Focus section achieves this 
  faction adjustment. Make sure you have a ranger in your party of friends. 
  You're going to have to track down some triggered MOBs and fight them. You 
  submit the items to Phenocryst. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Phenocryst makes no sound but it's voice fills your mind. 'We have always 
    held our memories within the earth and stone but only recently have we 
    become aware of them. We do not know what happened or who gave us this 
    wonderful gift but we can now access those memories and are aware of it's 
    storage. With that knowledge has come questions and desires. When the 
    prophecy comes to be then we will have our answers and fulfill our desires.'
    </p>
    <p>Phenocryst 's familiar thoughts flood into your mind again, 'You truly 
    are the Harbinger, take this Focus as a mark of your friendship with us. Now 
    we can construct the Menhir, we need ..,..,the stones speak.., There is a 
    problem. Ones of flesh are coming, the large ones, 3 of them. They must not 
    disturb us while we construct the Menhir! Please stop them Harbinger! bring 
    us proof of their distruction along with your Focus and then we will begin 
    the calling. Our asscention is at hand!'</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>You lose the focus and the three crystals and in return gain another focus 
  item with the description "Azurite Focus". It's a magic, lore, no drop item 
  weighing 0.5. </p>
  <p>Now head outside and start tracking. After a few minutes, two "accolyte of 
  Zek" giants will show up on track. A minute later or so, a Bloodpriest Loukond 
  will show up on tracker as well. You'll have to run out and pull the accolytes 
  to you once you track them. If they are snared, they still run quite fast. 
  These giants con blue at 52 and are quite magic resistant. Make sure you pull 
  these, they're almost more important than the Bloodpriest. They get attacked 
  by the various mercenaries in the zone sometimes and get killed before you can 
  do the job. If you have to pull mercenaries with the accolytes, do. After 
  killing both accolytes, loot them. Each one has a medalion that has the 
  description, "Holy Symbol of Zek", which is magic, no drop, and weighs 2.0. 
  After the accolytes are done, go out and get the Bloodpriest. Bloodpriest 
  Loukond should eventually walk up to the cave entrance and stand outside it if 
  nobody pulls it. After a minute of standing outside the cave, he depops, which 
  is why you have to do the accolytes first (they pop first) then the 
  bloodpriest (he'll get to the cave probably if you can't find him, the 
  accolytes might not). The bloodpriest cons blue at 52 and is just as magic 
  resistant. He drops a third and final medalion with the same description. You 
  must get all three medalions in order to for this part to prove fruitful. When 
  you kill the giants, you take the following faction hits: Kromzek (worse), 
  Kromrif (worse), KingTormax (worse), and ClawsofVeeshan (better). The giants 
  never enter the caves to attack the geonids or anything. Everything will 
  happen outside the caves and the giants won't aggro the dragon if it's up 
  either. The Bloodpriest Loukond is also not to be confused with Priest Bjek, 
  another giant who wanders in the area sometimes who is red at 52 and not 
  related to this quest. </p>
  <p>Now. Take your Azurite Focus and the three medalions to Phenocryst. Submit 
  them to Phenocryst. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Phenocryst 's thoughts become your own, a feeling of joy overwhelms you, 
    'Because of you we can at last speak with our maker. We were once given a 
    gift, and we ask that you accept this gift from us now so that we may come 
    closer to that which we owe our sentience to. Now..,we must construct the 
    Menhir..' </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>You lose the Azurite Focus and medalions and get the following item in 
  return, which is, it seems, the reward for this quest.</p>

    </div>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="center"> </p>
  <p align="left">Then then geonids, led by Phenocryst, start walking around, 
  through the halls and such. When this happens, you see the following message:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Phenocryst begins to resonate. All the stones about you begin to 
    resonate seemingly at its command. The Geonids all begin moving, all to 
    construct the Menhir." </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>At this point, all of the surrounding genoids as well as Phenocryst embark 
  on a journey through the caverns and out into the forest area of Wakening 
  Lands. The go about 300 yards out and down the hill and combine into one large 
  genoid called the
  <a onclick="MM_openBrWindow('menhir.jpg','menhir','width=660,height=500')" href="javascript:;">
  Menhir</a>. After about 20 seconds, the Menhir starts to emote some noises and 
  warns you that it is about to explode. I suggest doing so for the end result 
  is the Menhir imploding and setting off the AE of Supernova. <i>It's very 
  important to note that although geonids con indifferent or amiable, goo does 
  not and if you get any of it on you and a geonid is close by, it'll aggro the 
  geonid. No idea why this is, it doesn't make any sense, but it's the case.</i> 
  Also, enchanters can skip a huge chunk of this quest by casting Collaboration 
  on Phenocryst and starting from the point where to say to him "I will gather 
  these stones for you". The Velium Focus half gives you the faction to be able 
  to tell that to Phenocryst. Provided an enchanter MAKES him amiable, they 
  don't have to bother with the first half</p>
