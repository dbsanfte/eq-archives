  <p align="left"><b>You say, 'Hail, Hrelic Reista'<br>
  <br>
  </b> Hrelic Reista glances over from his books for a moment. 'Greetings. Have 
  you come to the realm of the tranquil to study as I have? The chaotic energy 
  of lightning has caught my interest of late. I've been trying to understand 
  the magics that further refine my control of lightning and [thunder].<b><br>
  <br>
  You say, 'what thunder?'<br>
  <br>
  </b> Hrelic Reista says 'The sages of Knowledge have been able to create 
  useful powers by translating some of the ancient scripts found in the planes. 
  I've been doing further research into the Draught of Thunder spell. I believe 
  I can refine the power of the thunder and lightning into a bolt of pure 
  destructive energy. I hear rumors that the giants of Torden have acute control 
  of thunder and lightning. If you bring me one of their lightning spheres and a 
  copy of the Draught of Thunder scroll I may be able to weave them into a new 
  spell.'</p>

  <p align="left"><font color="#CCBBFF"><i>.:: The draught of thunder scroll can 
  be obtained either by handing in spectral parchments in the library or for 
  about 1k platinum in bazaar. The lightning spheres are dropped by monsters inside Bastion of Thunder ::.</i><b><br>

            <p>Notes: This spell is much like the Draught of Thunder spell, 
            however there is no stun component. Like draught of thunder, this 
            spell also has a -50 MR lure built in.</p>
