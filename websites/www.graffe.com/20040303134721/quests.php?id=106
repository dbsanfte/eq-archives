  <tr>
    <td width="547"> <p>This is the first of four Sewer trials given by the 
    High Priest in Barindu. Please note you need to have hailed the High Priest 
    before starting this mission. The quest is fairly straight forward. </p>
    <p>From zone-in, move east through the first room until you get to the 2nd 
    room near Ansharu. You can bypass much of the room's monsters by hugging the 
    walls overlooking the middle. Except for the ghosts and slimes, nothing sees 
    invis. Once you've hailed Ansharu continue moving south to the Stonemite 
    Room. </p>
    <p>In the Stonemite room there are nine stonemites in the middle. I would 
    pull from the southeast corner of the room. You'll need to be out of the 
    water in able to cast on them - I'd suggest standing on the pipe close by. 
    Single pull and kill 8 of the 9. Then med to full. Kill the 9th when you're 
    ready and an Ancient will spawn. </p>
    <p>He hits for over 1000 so I'd certainly recommend bringing a patcher of 
    some kind. Head back to Ansharu and hail him and you should get a flag. Then 
    you can exit the zone and go back to the High Priest for entrance to the 
    second trial.</p>
