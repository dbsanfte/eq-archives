Jagged Pine Armor Quest - Boots<br>
------------------------------------<br>
<br>
You say, 'I wish to acquire boots' <br>
<br>
Cheyloh Greenwood says 'Then you shall endeavor to earn such a gift. I will guide and aid you where I can, as will Lerian Wyndrunner, whom you may find in Surefall Glade -- but it is you who will ultimately prove yourself worthy of this item and the sacred oath that is tied to it -- the oath of the guardian of nature. You must venture out into the world and procure several items that you will eventually return to me. The items I require are two Polished Jade Plates from the Potameid Guardians of the Hatchling River. Our rangers have reported much of our recently stolen jade ornaments to be in the possession of the Potameides -- the jade items likely came into their possession after they killed the poachers who raid our fort here on occasion. Lerian will guide you to acquire the second item if you approach and inquire to him about the Mithril Fern Boots.'' <br>
<br>
Lerian Wyndrunner is in Surefall Glades, off to the right after leaving the bear caves via the false wall behind the druid guild. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what mithril fern boots?' <br>
<br>
Lerian Wyndrunner says 'Cheyloh has caught the attentions of yet another druid seeking to prove themselves worthy of nature’s gifts. If she has placed her trust and faith in you with this, one of our most sacred of tests and equipment, then I shall guide and aid you in parallel to her faith, my friend. I will need you to seek out and return to me some Shadowjade Fern Seeds, two Shadowjade Fern Leaves, all of which you can forage from the Jaggedpine forest, and a Jaggedpine Panther Hide. To obtain this hide, you will seek out one known as Fitorrin Bladespur. The citizens of Qeynos have reported that he has taken a ship to Odus. As he is a criminal, Erudin may have already disposed of him, but that is unlikely for Fitorrin is well informed and education on the ways of the world for one of such a debased profession as he. It would be wise to search the forest of Toxxulia for his whereabouts.'' <br>
<br>
Fitorrin in Tox can be found on the Paineel side of the zone. He is immune to root and snare, but only has around 2k hps and green to lvl 60. You will need to hand Leiran the jaggedpine panther hide, 2 shadowjade fern leaves and 2 shadowjade seeds. You will receive a no drop hide in return.<br>
<br>
Leiran tells you to go to Sol b and get blackened mithril boots, no drop druid only that drops off of a kobold guardian. The kobold guardian spawns in the king area, he's light blue to 60 and a shadowknight. When you have the boots, combine them with the hide Lerian gave you in a large sewing kit for mithril fern boots (5ac, 10hp, 10mana), this wasn't trivial at 165 skill in tailoring. <br>
<br>
<br>
To get the polished jade plates drop off the potameid guardians. These are green at 60 for the most part, immune to root, snare and slow. The plates are a rare drop. Handing Cheyloh the mithril fern boots and the polished jade plates gives you: <br>

Jagged Pine Armor Quest - Bracer<br>
---------------------------------------<br>
<br>
You say, 'I wish to acquire a bracer' <br>
<br>
Cheyloh Greenwood says 'Then you shall work to obtain that which you desire, my friend. Nature's gifts are not given without justification and you must prove yourself worthy of this most sacred of our items. I will ask that you venture out into the wilds and procure the Polished Jade Blossoms and the Bracer of Braided Pine and return them to me. The Jade Blossoms are not traditional flora -- they are of the jade stones carved by our artisans and blessed by our elders. You will likely find them in the Potameid Caves, where many of our recently lost charms have turned up as of late. The Potameid Temptresses use the blossoms as charms around their necks, from what the scouts have gathered. To acquire the bracer, you must seek out Lerian Wyndrunner, who currently resides in the Surefall Glade, and seek his guidance.'' <br>
<br>
You say, 'what is the bracer of braided pine?' <br>
<br>
Lerian Wyndrunner says 'This is an item that you will need to work hard to obtain, my friend, but I shall guide you through this task -- if you can appeal to the world that you have dedicated your life to and receive her acceptance and gifts. I will need two specific items from you to create that which Cheyloh has requested of you. Those items are the Black Rawhide Bracer and the [Braids of Pine]. The rangers of the Jaggedpine Treefolk have informed me that Ryleen Bladespur, one of the poachers to have recently infested our forest, has made her way to South Karana to sell much of her stolen wears within the underground market of Norrath. Seek her out and you will find the bracer.'' <br>
<br>
You say, 'what are braids of pine?' <br>
<br>
Lerian Wyndrunner says 'This item you will need to make on your own by carefully weaving strands of Shadowjade Moss, Jaggedpine Needles, and Potameid Braids into one delicate strand. The forest will offer the Shadowjade Moss and Jaggedpine Needles to you if she deems you worthy of her gifts. The braids, however, you must take from the Potameid Wildlings of the Hatchling River. Be sure that your mastery in the ways of tailoring are in the forefront of your mind when you attempt this feat, for anything less will result in the destruction of these delicate materials.'' <br>
<br>
Ryleen Bladespur is roughly the same as the two previous Bladespurs, and can be found in South Karana, south-west of the aviak village. <br>
<br>
The braids seem to be a very rare drop.<br>

Jagged Pine Armor Quest - Circlet<br>
-------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
You say, 'I wish to acquire a circlet' <br>
<br>
Cheyloh Greenwood nods softly, 'Then you shall endeavor to earn them, my friend. Nature will provide to you what it is you provide to her -- if you protect her, she shall in-turn offer shelter and provide to you. I shall aid you, as is my duty here, but you must set out on your own before my aid can be granted. There are two items you must seek; a Polished Jade Tear that resides in the clutches of Lameriae the Alluring, a powerful Potameid Temptress who seduced and killed on of the Blackguard's most cunning of thieves and hunters. It is said that she holds the tear, which was given to her by the entranced Blackguard before he drowned to death. The second item you must retrieve for me is a Shadowjade Circlet that Jhaya Wyndrunner in Surefall Glade will aid you to acquire -- all you need to do approach and ask her.' <br>
<br>
Jhaya Wyndrunner is on the the side of the druid's guild opposite to her brother Lerian in surefall glade. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what shadowjade circlet?' <br>
<br>
Jhaya Wyndrunner says 'I see that Cheyloh has been keeping herself quite busy with the recent opening of our lands to Qeynos, and I am pleased to know that our brethren of the world beyond the Jaggedpine have an interest in our ways. I will aid you to create the circlet, but I must ask that you brave the wilds and turmoil of this world to retrieve two items that I will then weave into the circlet for you. The items I need are a Shadowjade Weave, which you will make with your own hands by weaving two Shadowjade Vines and two strands of Shadowjade Moss together -- both components you may find by foraging through the Jaggedpine forest. Be sure that your mastery of tailoring is up to par when attempting this feat, for the components are delicate and will be destroyed in the hands of the inexperienced. The second item I am in need of is a [Blackened Mithril Chain].'' <br>
<br>
You say, 'what blackened mithril chain?' <br>
<br>
Jhaya Wyndrunner says 'The artisans of Qeynos have provided a wonderful counterpart to our natural, although nearly depleted resource that was once used when making this line of our sacred armor. Unfortunately, the one who last attempted to retrieve the chain was killed in Lavastorm by one of the poachers, who seek the Blackened Mithril for their own reasons -- likely to steal our recipe and sell the corrupted versions of these treasured items on the underground market of Norrath. In any case, we have heard that the chain was sold to one appropriately named Nyuae the Cruel -- a Teir'Dal enchantress. What her motives are, I am unsure of, but we do know that she has taken refuge in the Ocean of Tears. Retrieve the Blackened Mithril Chain and return it to me with the Shadowjade Weave.'' <br>
<br>
Nyuae the Cruel is in the ocean of tears on the dinosaur island. She's also light blue to 60, a necromancer and immune to root/snare. <br>
<br>
The shadowjade weave requires 2 shadowjade moss and 2 shadowjade fern leaves combined in a large sewing kit, not trivial at 165 skill. Handing the shadowjade weave and blackened mithril chain to Jhaya results in a;<br>

Jagged Pine Armor Quest - Gloves<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
<br>
You say, 'I wish to acquire gloves' <br>
<br>
Cheyloh Greenwood says 'A most wise choice, friend. You must continue to uphold the sacred duties that you have pledged your existence to and thus gain nature's recognition and full acceptance to fulfill this task. The items I am in need of so that I might properly weave the gloves are Polished Jade Studs and Forest Woven Gloves. The Polished Jade Studs you will find in the Potameid Caves, where much of our sacred jade ornaments have found their way by the fates of the thieves and poachers who infest this land and frequently raid our homes. Our scouts believe the Potameid Matriarchs to hold the jade studs, and I would heed their advice to discourage any unnecessary danger to you. The Forest Woven Gloves will require further aid from a member of the Jaggedpine to obtain. Seek out my beloved, Lerian in the Surefall Glade and inquire to him about the gloves. He will know who has sent you and the full details of the task before you.'' <br>
<br>
You say, 'what are forest woven gloves?' <br>
<br>
Lerian Wyndrunner says 'The gloves you seek to acquire will take much patience and perseverance on your behalf to be successful in obtaining. I can guide you as to who and what you must seek and give you the proper instructions to fulfill your part before I can give the final touch to creating the Forest Woven Gloves. The task you must fulfill before returning to me to complete the final process in the item's creation is to use your own mastery in the ways of tailoring to create the Blackened Mithril Netted Gloves. There are two components for this item -- one is the Tattered Panther Hide Gloves, which you will likely find upon a renegade poacher known as Theoris Bladespur, who the scouts of the Glade have informed me currently resides in South Karana. The second item is the [Blackened Mithril Netting].'' <br>
<br>
<br>
You say, 'what is blackened mithril netting?' <br>
<br>
Lerian Wyndrunner says 'This material is new to the creation of the gloves, as the resource we had once used grows dangerously scarce. I have spoken with the craftsman of Qeynos and they have given me the knowledge of the Blackened Mithril, which can be found in the clutches of the kobold king's guard who resides in Solusek's Eye. The artisans of Qeynos say that the Blackened Mithril is light and its ability to hold an enchantment is unsurpassed by anything they have yet to find on Antonica, making it suitable for our intentions of creating this item. Once you have successfully made the Blackened Mithril Netted Gloves, you will need to return them to me with the Shadowjade Moss and Shadowjade Fern Leaves, both of which you can safely procure in the Jaggedpine, if the forest will allow you take of it.'' <br>
<br>
The blackened mithril netting drops off a kobold advisor, also in the king area of solb. the advisor is a light blue to 60 shaman. He's either immune to changes in run speed or so resistant as to make little difference. <br>
<br>
Theoris Bladespur is roughly the same lvl/difficulty as Fitorrin, and spawns in East Karana at the bandit camp by the druid ring.<br>
<br>
 Combining the blackened mithril netting and tattered panther hide gloves in a large sewing kit results in Blackened mithril netted gloves, and isn't trivial at 165. <br>
<br>
Handing the blackened mithril netted gloves, 1 shadow jade fern leaf, and 1 shadowjade moss to Lerian results in;<br>

Jagged Pine Armor Quest - Leggings<br>
--------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
You say, 'I wish to acquire leggings' <br>
<br>
Cheyloh Greenwood says 'Very well, Aldreaath. There are two components that you will need to return to me; [Polished Jade Acorns] and [Moss-Threaded Rawhide Leggings]. But procuring those items will not be easy, and I can guarantee that you will plunge yourself into danger. However, you should not fear this for we must often selflessly endanger ourselves to fulfill our ultimate goals -- the protection of the natural world. Through these endeavors, your success will be rewarded by nature's recognition and she shall grant to you the gifts you will need to complete this task before you.'' <br>
<br>
You say, 'what polished jade acorns?' <br>
<br>
Cheyloh Greenwood says 'Every piece of the Armor of the Pine requires a special stone. These stones have been carved into different shapes by our artisans, and each one blessed by our elder warders of the pine. Unfortunately, the introduction of the poachers with the creation of the passageway between the forest and the den of Black burrow has brought us to a loss for these sacred items. The Blackguard family and their henchmen have raided our fort several times, stealing our materials to be sold illegally within the underground market of Norrath. However, the poachers are very limited in their knowledge of this area and our ranger scouts have informed us that [Myraephe the Pure] killed the one who stole the specific stones we need.'' <br>
<br>
You say, 'who is Myraephe the pure?' <br>
<br>
Cheyloh Greenwood says 'The Hatchling River -- a beautiful waterway jealously protected by the nymph spirits known as Potameides, fuels the lifeblood of this forest. These naiads are beautiful creatures, who at one time were benevolent to us until the development of great cultures and the construction of great cities destroyed much of the nymph kind. The Potameides felt the loss of their sisters and became hostile to all mortals alike, viewing our presence as a threat to their very existence. Myraephe is one of the ancient Potameides and our scouts have said that recently, she wears a necklace made of Polished Stone Acorns. Seek Myraede and retrieve the acorns as you will, my friend -- and know neither regret nor sorrow for your actions as their intentions have been influenced by the threat of the Unkempt Wood to the east. The Potameid spirit will return to protect the river its spirit is bound to, so long as the river itself does not become corrupt.'' <br>
<br>
You say, 'what are moss threaded rawhide leggings?' <br>
<br>
Lerian Wyndrunner says 'Aaaahh. . . I see that you have chosen to embark on the sacred path of the Jaggedpine. No doubt my dearest Cheyloh has sent you, and if she has placed her trust in you and given you the sacred knowledge to embark on this ancient quest, then my services are at your disposal in this cause, my friend. To create the Moss Threaded Rawhide Leggings, you will need to obtain the [needed components] that I will work with to make the leggings.'' <br>
<br>
You say, 'what are the needed components?' <br>
<br>
Lerian Wyndrunner says 'The recipe for the Moss Threaded Rawhide Leggings is very specific, and the materials that I am about to describe to you must be exact for the creation of the Leggings of the Pine to be properly completed. From you, I will need a pair of Ruined Rawhide Leggings and a [Spool of Moss Thread]. The ruined leggings you will likely find in the Shrine of Brell Serilis, located beneath our forest. When the gnolls first arrived in the Jaggedpine, they raided our fort several times and although no lives have yet to be lost specifically to their talons, something of which I give praise and thanks to The Rainkeeper for daily, the gnolls have stolen our supplies from time to time.'' <br>
You say, 'what is a spool of moss thread?' <br>
Lerian Wyndrunner says 'This item you will need to use your own hands, patience, and devotion to the natural world to create. A mastery of the skill of weaving -- tailoring -- is very important when attempting to handle such a feat. The items that you must weave to make this enchanted thread are the Shadowjade Moss and Threads of the Hatchling. The Shadowjade Moss you will find as a gift from the Jaggedpine for your services to her. If you search carefully and with selfless patience, she will grant you a perfect specimen suitable for the creation of this item. The Threads of the Hatchling you must acquire from the Potameid Bewilders in the caves located off the Hatchling River. May The Rainkeeper guide you in your quest, my friend, and I look forward to your return.'' <br>
<br>
Myraephe the Pure is found in the river near the poacher camp. She is light blue to 60, and immune to root/snare. <br>
<br>
The ruined rawhide leggings drop off of a Darkpaw Mystic in the darkpaw cave in Jaggedpine Forest. <br>

Jagged Pine Armor Quest - Sleeves<br>
---------------------------------------<br>
<br>
You say, 'I wish to acquire sleeves' <br>
<br>
Cheyloh Greenwood says 'If that is your wish, my friend. You will need to seek out two items and return them to me. In the depths of the Potameid caves located off of the Hatchling River, you will find the Potameid Protectors. Our ranger scouts have found many of our sacred jade ornaments scattered throughout the possession of the Potameides. Reports stating that the protectors to hold the Polished Jade Leaves, which you must acquire for the sleeves, have been delivered by our scouts. The second item that you must return to me are the Shark Tooth Sleeves. Seek out Lerian Wyndrunner in Surefall Glade and he will guide you in that task.'' <br>
<br>
You say, 'what are shark tooth sleeves?' <br>
<br>
Lerian Wyndrunner says 'You seek to prove yourself upon the ancient and sacred path of the Jaggedpine, I see. You will need to procure two specific items for me so that I might make one of the components that you will need to produce the sleeves. Yes, my, friend, you will be making the final product with your own hands and patience, as is the ultimate test of this path -- to prove that you are willing and able to earn these items on your own accord. The items I need to make the Reinforced Rawhide Sleeves are a Shark Rib from one of the great behemoths of Kedge, and a Flayed Panther Hide. The hide you will find upon one of the poachers that have taken it upon themselves to establish an outpost in our forest. The one you will find to have such hide within their possession is Yranik Blackguard.' <br>
<br>
Handing Lerian the shark rib and the flayed panther hide results in: <br>
<br>
Reinforced Rawhide Sleeves. 6ac, 10hp. <br>
<br>
Lerian Wyndrunner says ''inspects the rib and the hide, checking for imperfections that might disable him from completing his work. Satisfied with the quality of the components, Lerian places the rib in the center of the hide, which is draped over his arm. He then begins to speak softly in an ancient, druidic tongue that is foreign to your ears and knowledge. As he speaks, the black fur of the hide seems to pierce the cartilage shark rib, binding it in-place. The rest of the hide folds back, wrapping itself around the druid's arm. Lerian then completes his chant and removes the Reinforced Rawhide Sleeves from his arm and offers it to Aldreaath, 'There is [more that you must do], my friend, before this task is complete.'' <br>

<br>
You say, 'what more must I do?' <br>
<br>
Lerian Wyndrunner says 'Return to Kedge and find two Discarded Shark Teeth. These teeth you will likely find at the bottom of the oceanic ruins and need not interfere with the corrupted, coerced slaves of Phinagel to acquire the teeth. Yes, we know of Phinagel and the gruesome legend that surrounds him -- remember, he is indeed very old and his 'accomplishments' with the Kedge race happened long before the Jaggedpine borders were sealed off. We are not entirely ignorant to the outside world -- it is just the modern times that have become a bit of a mystery. Once you have acquired the teeth, you will need to sew them onto the reinforced sleeves that I have just given you. Be sure you hold a master's eye in the art of tailoring when attempting this feat, for the thread is very thin and will break at the touch of an armature's attempt.'' <br>

Poacher's Heads Quest<br>
-------------------------------<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Randel Stormwind' <br>
<br>
Randel Stormwind says 'Well met, Scytalle. This has been a very stressful time for many of us and some of us have been kind of edgy lately. We've lived here for generations and in relative seclusion and we enjoyed a simple life for the most part. Unfortunately, this was not to last and the sudden [change] has left many on edge.' <br>
<br>
You say, 'what change' <br>
<br>
Randel Stormwind says 'There are a lot of people that resent the outsiders and view their presence as corrupting our way of life. It's more then just the new guards and the sudden influx of people though. This is sort of a long story that begins when my grandfather was just a lad. It was during the rule of Antonius III that public [access] to the Jaggedpine Forest [was restricted].' <br>
<br>
You say, 'why was access restricted' <br>
<br>
Randel Stormwind says 'The Protectors of the Pine became concerned when adventurers began wandering through Jaggedpine Forest and into the Unkempt Wood. Most that did were never heard from ever again. The residents of Surefall feared retaliation from the Unkempt for those trespassing into their territory and Antonius smartly reasoned that if Surefall Glade were to be taken, Qeynos would surely be next. So he declared Jaggedpine Forest and all points eastward off limits. So it was just our ancestors that dwelled on the [Throne of Karana's Fury].' <br>
<br>
You say, 'what throne of karanas fury' <br>
<br>
Randel Stormwind says 'Yes, that was what this place was called until recently but I'll get to that part in a minute. We who acted as stewards were allowed to come and go as we pleased through Surefall Glade. For the longest time things were peaceful. Sure, we had problems with the odd [poacher] here or there but for the most part it was peaceful. However, trouble began when an [outsider] snuck through Surefall Glade and entered the Unkempt Wood.' <br>
<br>
You say, 'what poacher' <br>
<br>
Randel Stormwind says 'Yes poachers often sneak in and mindlessly kill our sacred bears for their skins. Often they'll kill a mother bear and leave their cubs for dead. If I am able, I'll take the cub and raise it. If I do my job well, I'm able to release the bear back into the wild once it is old enough to fend for itself. There is one [group] of poachers I'm particularly worried about though.' <br>
<br>
You say, 'what group' <br>
<br>
Randel Stormwind says 'They are a pair of ne'er-do-well couples that have been terrorizing the animals recently, killing and maiming every creature they happen across. It's their sick idea of sport. They need to be stopped. They call themselves the [Pirates of the Pine].' <br>
<br>
You say, 'what pirates of the pine' <br>
<br>
Randel Stormwind says 'They are a bunch of good for nothing lowlives! I would stop them myself but sadly, I lack skill with a weapon. You on the other hand, look like you can handle yourself pretty well. If you are able to bring these four to justice, return to me with proof. You will be justly compensated for your efforts.' <br>
<br>
Hand him 4 heads from Poacher camp at -700 -1300... they drop off rare spawned named respectively. <br>
<br>
Head of Elishia Blackguard <br>
Head of Reynold Blackguard <br>
Head of Vaurien Sticklebush <br>
Head of Zed Sticklebush <br>

Randel Stormwind says 'Great Karana's blessing!! I see justice by your hand is both swift and eternal. I would never have had the skill nor the heart to carry out these miscreant's punishment the way you have. I'm glad to call you a friend and not an enemy. Well, I did promise just compensation for your efforts and I'm true to my word. Please take this ring as a token of my gratitude.' <br>

Jeremy's Letter Quest<br>
----------------------------<br>

Jeremy Leafrunner by the camp fire will eventually ask you to deliver a letter to his grandmother if you follow his dialogue options. He gives you a letter to take to Elishia Leafrunner in Felwithe. She can be found in the second Felwithe zone, in the part with the caster guilds. Delivering the message gets the following faction adjustments. <br>
<br>
+Keepers of the Art <br>
+King Tearis Thex <br>

Qeynos Badge of Nobility Quest<br>
-------------------------------------------<br>
*******************************************************************<br>
NOTE: You must have completed the first 4 Qeynos Badges to be able to continue with this quest.<br>
*******************************************************************<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Sergeant Caelin' <br>
<br>
Sergeant Caelin says 'Hail. You have nothing to fear from the gnolls. My men and I have been sent from Qeynos to help defend Fort Jaggedpine should those worthless curs make the mistake of assuming this will be a place of easy plunder. I've fought and slain scores of gnolls in my time. Were I not bound to my post here I would go forth and drive them from their dark cave to the north myself. However, I can offer you a [bounty], should you choose to take such a mission upon yourself.' <br>
<br>
You say, 'what bounty' <br>
<br>
Sergeant Caelin says 'If you choose to go and fight against the gnolls, I shall offer a bounty for every gnoll canine that you return to me. You look a bit more adventurous then many of those that live in this settlement. They seem a bit [docile].' <br>
<br>
You say, 'who is docile' <br>
<br>
Sergeant Caelin says 'Perhaps it comes from living in harmony with nature for an extended period of time but they are more concerned with trading food recipes and doing arts and crafts. I have offered to give them some basic training in the arts of war but they seem to have no interest. This is a dangerous world in which we live and failure to acknowledge that has meant the downfall of many a society. I won't let this happen on my watch, provided my [men] are on their toes.' <br>
<br>
You say, 'What men' <br>
<br>
Sergeant Caelin says 'Guard Bossamir is a model soldier and a good man. I'm happy to have him watching my back. That Finewine character however, he is not worth the cost of the sword he wields! All he does is whine and complain. He was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and his family enrolled him in the guard to teach him some discipline but I've had no luck with him. He hasn't even turned in a [shift report] for weeks. Captain Tillin will bust me down to private if I don't deliver those soon.' <br>
<br>
***Kills Gnolls and turn in Gnolls fangs otherwise Sergeant Caelin will just say &quot;you have not proved yourself worth to our cause&quot;. You need to be at least amiable to him. when you are...*** <br>
<br>
You say, 'what shift report' <br>
<br>
Sergeant Caelin says 'You have been helpful in our defense efforts. However, I can not be too careful about whom I trust with carrying this information. If you truly consider yourself an ally to Qeynos then no doubt you have assisted the city in its defense before. Show me your Qeynos Badge of Honor and I'll know I can trust you fully. I'll place my mark upon it should anyone question your authority to do this service for me.' <br>
<br>
***hand him your Qeynos badge of Honor and you will receive &quot;Marked Qeynos Badge of Honor&quot; in return along with &quot;A warning note/report&quot; to give to Guard Finewine. Sorry I don't have the dialogue for that but trust me*** <br>
<br>
*to your right and within eye site is Guard Finewine. He is standing by the other house back entrance* <br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Guard Finewine' <br>
<br>
Guard Finewine says 'Yeah. Hi. Lovely place this. Humid, dark, wild animals all over the place, man eating plants, snakes and bugs finding their way into my armor and biting me where a man ought not be bit. And if [Bossamir] is right, we're soon to be cut down by ravaging gnolls. Why-oh-why did I get assigned to this job? Why wasn't I assigned to Qeynos where a man can get a decent meal and sleep in a nice bed at night? Oh I'm sorry. Did I say that out loud?' <br>
<br>
You say, 'What Bossamir' <br>
<br>
Guard Finewine says 'Hmm. . . Yeah, I have this tendency to prattle on when I'm completely miserable. According to what my colleague Bossamir has heard, these gnolls may be tougher then we thought. But that would be par for the course anyway with the way my pitiful life is going. Woe is me. The people in this backward settlement hate me, Sergeant Caelin hates me and I assume Kane hates me too because he sent me to the armpit of Antonica on a suicide mission.' <br>
<br>
*gave him the Warning letter/note* <br>
<br>
Guard Finewine says 'So he wants to send me to jail simply because I'm not filling out some silly reports? How can I be expected to think in such a decrepit state? Maybe you could help me. If I had a meal worthy of someone of my breeding then maybe I could think. Bring me something elegant, I don't want anything dull and pedestrian. I don't know what I want though. Do you have any suggestions?' <br>
<br>
Guard Finewine wants some dryad, Potameid pate first before he will part with the report. Finewine then says he wants panther pate and will give you a no drop brandy for the dryad/Potameid pate. <br>
<br>
--Dryad, Potameid pate <br>
-First you need Dryad meat (which will lower your faction with Dryads and they are everywhere in this zone) or Potameid meat (trivial 151) <br>
-foraged plant shoots <br>
-brandy <br>
-spices <br>
-combine in an oven or spit which will result in a +4 wisdom banquet meal for the dryad recipe and +4 intelligence banquet meal for the Potameid recipe. <br>
<br>
---panther pate <br>
-no drop panther liver from JP panthers <br>
-foraged plant shoots <br>
-no drop brandy from guard (see above) <br>
-spices <br>
-combine in an oven or spit <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Hand him the panther pate and you'll receive the shift report. Hand the report to Caelin and you'll receive the Book of Reports. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Now run over to Qeynos and hand the book of reports to Captain Tillin, and he will in turn hand you back a new set of Orders. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Hand the orders to Sergeant Caelin back in Jaggedpine and you'll receive the Writ of Execution and a two Slot Container. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Now you must kill Barducks Darkpaw and then combine his head as well as the writ of execution in the container. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Hand this completed container to Caelin with your Marked Qeynos Badge of Honor and you'll receive the Qeynos Badge of Nobility.<br>

Gale Weaver (Karana only) Quest<br>
---------------------------------------<br>
<br>
This quest starts in Jagged Pine Forest, and is given by Annous Pineshadow, a white robed human near one of the camp fires, once you've attained Ally faction with the Jagged Pine Folk. <br>
<br>
The Gale Weaver <br>
You say, 'Hail, Annous Pineshadow' <br>
<br>
Annous Pineshadow closes his eyes and gives a deep bow of his head in formal greetings, 'Good day to you, Orolmy. I am Annous Pineshadow, high priest of The Rainkeeper and ambassador of Qeynos. It has been a [long] time since I last set foot within the Jaggedpine, and although not surprised, I am amazed and awestruck at the untouched purity of these sacred grounds. It is very much a relief to know that the forest has been sparred the taint of the venomous world that has become Norrath.' <br>
<br>
You say, 'How long has it been?' <br>
<br>
Annous Pineshadow gives a gentle chuckle as he conjures his most fond of memories, 'Sixty years -- give or take. This is the place of my birth and my home. When I had come of age, I ventured to Qeynos to learn the ways of the priest, finding myself lost in the ways of the druid. I adore the nature that Karana sustains, but I had always felt myself more suited for the path of preservation and servitude of the faith. When his majesty, Antonious III sealed the Jaggedpine, I was among those who were asked to remain behind in Qeynos. Only the druids and rangers of Karana remained in the Jaggedpine -- it was important to preserve only the bare minimum and we understood the need. We also did not wish to have our culture be entirely cut off and those who remained outside of the forest's confines were there to continue the faith and [sacred ways] of The Rainkeeper.' <br>
<br>
You say, 'What sacred ways do you speak of?' <br>
<br>
Annous Pineshadow says 'There are hundreds of different rites, ceremonies, prayers, and rituals that are performed in one's devotion to The Rainkeeper. Many of these can be as simple as the performance of a duty, as a druid would protect their forest, while some may be as complex and consuming as a several day ceremony to usher in the changing seasons. Aaaah. . . but there is truly so much that in the time that's left for me here could not give proper justice for in my explanations -- nor do I believe that you would truly understand them by simply listening. You must [have the faith in your heart] and you must truly wish to uphold the ways of the Rainkeeper and do so to truly understand.'' <br>
<br>
You say, 'I have faith in my heart.' <br>
<br>
Annous Pineshadow says 'I would not dare challenge that, my friend, but is your faith strong enough to withstand the greatest of consequences -- even the sacrifice of your own life in remaining true to that faith? Aaaah. . . but such is a question that cannot be merely asked and simply answered in words. One truly does not discover one's self until they are faces with the reality of such tests of faith. Perhaps, if [you are willing], I might guide you on a path that may lead to the discovery of such answers.'' <br>
<br>
You say, 'I am willing to test my faith.' <br>
<br>
Annous Pineshadow says 'Excellent, child. I am pleased to know that you are willing to go so far as to test your faith -- but do so not to me, or to anyone other than yourself and The Rainkeeper, else you shall find only a hollow shadow of the answers you seek, and a great void of disappointment. If you prove successful in your own eyes by completing this task, then you shall be among The Rainkeeper's sacred order of priests -- The Gale Weavers. Druids and Clerics alike make up this order, for our dedication is mutual in strength and our ultimate duties to The Rainkeeper are parallel. The first journey that you must embark on will result in the acquisition of the [Azure Idol of Karana] -- an ancient item that each of The Gale Weavers possess.'' <br>
<br>
You say, 'What is an Azure Idol of Karana?' <br>
<br>
Annous Pineshadow says 'When the order was first founded by the Hierophant known as Tanirun Galeweaver, he bestowed upon all of his brethren a sacred idol carved by his own hands. It is said that when Tanirun blessed the Shrine of Karana with his gift of the storm, that the remaining essence of Karana's witness was divided among the idols. In the passing times, the idols were handed down when an old member passed beyond into the Eye of Karana's Storm and a new member was inducted in their predecessor's memory and honor. You will seek one of these idols -- one that at present has no owner and was stolen by the bandit raiders and return it to me. The man who possesses the idol is one known as Drayen Blackguard -- a member of the dreaded Blackguard family that has taken recent residence in the forest. You shall find him in the mountains of Rathe if our scouts are correct.'' <br>
<br>
Find and kill Drayen Blackguard at the bandit camp in Rathe Mountains and loot (immune to changes in run speed): Azure Idol of Karana. <br>
<br>
You give the Azure Idol of Karana to Annous Pineshadow <br>
<br>
Annous Pineshadow says 'Marvelously done, my friend. The idol's return by your hand bodes well indeed toward the success of your quest. Now, it shall remain without a hand to possess it -- but in time, perhaps, it may find a suitable possessor in you. If [you wish to prove yourself worthy] of the idol and further prove your faith as notable enough to belong to the sacred order of The Gale Weavers, then speak your pledge and your test shall continue.'' <br>
<br>
Your faction standing with Residents of Jaggedpine got better. <br>
Your faction standing with Jaggedpine Treefolk got better. <br>
Your faction standing with Protectors of Pine got better. <br>
Your faction standing with Guards of Qeynos got better. <br>
You gain experience!! <br>
<br>
You say, 'I wish to prove myself worthy' <br>
<br>
Annous Pineshadow says 'Then your endeavor shall continue, my child. Take this scroll -- to you now it holds no meaning but in due time you shall understand. Keep the scroll close to you until you have sought and successfully acquired the [Dormant Crystal Sphere] and [The Rainkeeper's Writ].' <br>
<br>
You receive: Ancient White Scroll. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What is a dormant crystal sphere?' <br>
<br>
Annous Pineshadow says 'There are several magical spheres throughout Norrath but this sphere is [unique to The Rainkeeper]. <br>
It is said that when Karana blessed this area with his first storm in acceptance of the nomadic tribe that would settle here, that the droplets of rain left upon the pines and blades of grass was gathered by one of these nomads and stored in a plain clay jar that was then buried as a symbol of their own gratitude toward the storm. Nearly a century later when Karana's Shrine and the Throne of Karana's Thunder were near completion, one known as Tanirun Galeweaver found the jar. The water was still inside, preserved by means unexplainable through simple reason. It is said that Tanirun poured the water into his own hands and wove a spell, sealing the wind within the orb of this ancient rain that was now crystallized by Tanirun's spell.'' <br>
<br>
You say, 'How is it unique to the Rainkeeper?' <br>
<br>
Annous Pineshadow says 'Tanirun's orb was used to make the first symbol that to this day is wielded by the members of the sacred order. His effects were duplicated by the first order and each bore an orb identical to Tanirun's. These orbs, as the idols, were passed down from member to member. As with the idol, we held an orb that had no bearer. However, before the Jaggedpine was sealed, the orb disappeared. We are not certain as to how or why, but we do know that if it lies within the hands of one who is not of Karana's faithful priests, it shall become dormant until awoken. I have heard rumors, distant whispers upon the wind and storm that the orb lies within the depths of Solusek's Eye -- nestled in the hands of a giant known as Neiroth the Tyrant. Find this ancient giant and retrieve the orb from him.'' <br>
<br>
Find and kill Neiroth, a named Fire Giant in the room people describe as the Lord Nagafen 'prep' room. and loot: Dormant Crystal Sphere. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What can you tell me of the Rainkeeper's Writ?' <br>
<br>
Annous Pineshadow says ''When the order of The Gale Weavers was established, Tanirun and his brethren of the order constructed a sacred writ similar to a spell, but it cannot be invoked at the priest's whim. Like the storm, it is chaos. When the words are spoken, the elements of the storm will come as they wish, when they wish. This writ was used to conjure the essence of the storm into the orbs, creating the mirror of a sky where a storm rages eternally. The writ was lost to us sometime before the Jaggedpine was sealed. One known as Naundruar, a former high priest of our order, took the writ. He was furious, enraged that the order had been asked to divide and leave our sacred homeland. None are ultimately certain what horrible fate befell him, for his hatred toward Qeynos had infected his being like an incurable disease. In the southern plain of Karana you will find the remnants of this once great priest and with him, you shall find the writ.''' <br>
<br>
Find and kill Sir Nandruar (not Naundruar as described) a Giant Skeleton in South Karana and loot: The Rainkeeper's Writ. <br>
<br>
You hand The Rainkeeper's Writ to Annous Pineshadow <br>
You hand Dormant Crystal Sphere to Annous Pineshadow <br>
You hand Ancient White Scroll to Annous Pineshadow <br>
<br>
Annous Pineshadow says 'You have done well, my child. The ancient scroll has impressed upon it a small mirror of your faith. As it was with you through your travels, the runes have changed to reflect your own heart and what lies within it. I have woven for you the Orb of the Gale -- your Orb of the Gale, but do not think that your journey ends here. It is still hollow -- the winds are dormant and the clouds lie in wait. Their lifeblood is missing, and you must seek it. To do this, you must venture to the realm where the Gale thrives -- the Plane of Sky. There are ethereal creatures known as Gale Weavers that dwell there. You must extinguish their temporary tangible form and from that, take the essence of the Gale that they have woven. Do not feel remorse for destroying these planar creatures, for you do not truly destroy them. Once you have obtained the Essence of the Gale, place it into the orb and seal it, creating the Orb of the Gale that must be returned to me.'' <br>

<br>
Combine the Essence of the Gale in the container (no other items required): <br>
You have fashioned the items together to create something new! <br>
<br>
[ Orb of the Gale ] <br>
<br>
You give Orb of the Gale to Annous Pineshadow. <br>
<br>
Annous Pineshadow says 'You astound me, my child. Well done indeed, and I am very pleased to know that you have been successful in these endeavors. It is an honor to bestow upon you this, our sacred symbol, and welcome you into the order of The Gale Weavers. Bear it proudly, but do not flaunt pride. Keep your sacred duties to The Rainkeeper first and foremost in your thoughts and actions -- the Gale Weaver shall guide you when you need guidance most, and it shall protect you when your time for failure has not yet come. The idol shall remain with me, where I shall bury it at the Shrine of Karana in honor of your coming into our ranks. When the time comes for you to pass beyond, it shall be unearthed by another who has taken my place as high priest of our order, for I will likely have passed into the Eye of Karana's Storm before your final day.'' <br>
