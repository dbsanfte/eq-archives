I mean now minstrels an bards get the AE mez......We keep sitting back saying we are balanced and the other similarly &quot;balanced&quot; classes keep complaining and making it unbalanced.<br>
<br>
I dont see how two of the three song classes can have an AE mez and that be called balanced.<br>
We all have the same armor....we have the same skill points to spend. <br>

Minstrels get Stun and Mez<br>

We can't and shouldn't compare Skalds, Bards and Minstrels. Skalds are on the same &quot;class template&quot; as Thanes, Champions and Paladins.<br>
<br>
I have a big post patch concern though. While I see the resistances going live as a good thing (CC in general = bad for the game), I think the way it is implemented, it actually don't hurt primary crowd controlling class that much in RvR, but destroys &quot;secondary&quot; CC like skalds. A good melee, with a few levels of determination and magic avoidance, and a few spirit resistance items (I am not even counting big RA expenses or a great anti spirit gear) can easily reduce by 50% the duration of a control spell. Useless against a 1min20 &quot;primary&quot; mez (yeah so I am only paralyzed for 40 secs, geez ...), but it has the potential to seriously weaken our 30 secs timer very short duration shout ... <br>

<br>
Skalds have a dmg add chant, skalds can chant AND swing a sword without having to swap out an instrument.<br>
<br>
Skalds get a &quot;ghetto mez&quot; that is a single-target 30sec hold.<br>
<br>
The other realms' song classes are just that, song classes. They hold instruments and sing and chant and support groups by helping their tanks and by controlling crowds of enemies. Skalds can go toe-to-toe (mostly) in melee with a Thane's abilities (like I said, mostly).<br>
<br>
Asking for an AE mez for Skalds I think is a bit outrageous. Its not what Skalds are good at, and its not their primary function. Skalds are group supporters that support from inside the middle of the melee, not fragile instrument players. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/uclapperoth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Clapperoth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Contributor</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/2/02 12:09:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=221.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bah</span><hr size=1> Agreed, we don't need AoE Mez.

Why is this not unballancing? because our mez is only 29secs in duration, therefore you would still want the healer to do all the mezzes, plus if you stand back and just try to mez, you are effectively taking a good dmg dealer out a fight. <p><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="http://users.iol.it/okandrea/EreNi.gif"></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/ufenrisfil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>fenrisfil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Contributor</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/4/02 1:34:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=221.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bah</span><hr size=1> I have to say, I do not believe the minstrel was ever the secondary crowd controller for albion. The main two CC'rs were Sorceror and Cleric. Minstrels were just annoying in one on one situations when they stunned you. <br>
<br>
Now of course they may be, but it was as much of a suprise to them and albion as it was to everyone else that they were called the secondary CC'ers under Clerics.<br>
<br>
Bards are the primary CC'r for hibernia. But outside of midgard you'd be hard pushed to to really notice a &quot;primary&quot; CC'er. In Midgard we all know about and rely on healers. In Albion and Hibernia CC is more spread out. If Skalds are not the secondary CC'rs of midgard then you'd have to say Spiritmasters do that job but they have a casted pb ae mez and a casted mez, where as we get an insta-mez. So really it's a fairly close run thing and considering minstrels beat sorcerers out as being considered the secondary CC class when they only had an insta stun and single target mez it's fair enough to suggest that skalds could become the secondary CC class in midgard in similar fashion.<br>
<br>
Anyone seen the numbers of skalds running around midgard on mordred? Compare that to the numbers that make it into the top 20 realm point earners. There are two (at time of writting) one at 12 and one at 20. Seems the myth that we are all powerful is being exposed as fake, and with other classes like minstrels that were also well balanced being given unneccisary boosts maybe it's about time we had a little tweaking.<br>
<br>
Okay, I do believe bards needed some defensive help, but I always thought insta ae mez would be over powering, especially as Shamans were told that only true clerical classes (Healers, Clerics, Druids) would have instants. Shaman did get an insta disease, but that is about as much use as bicycle with no wheels (not really a get of jail free spell is it). I always pressumed it was because of them not being a true clerical class they didn't get a proper instant, being stuck as a non-hybrid, non-clerical class. Bards now seem to be a true Clerical class *as well* as a hybrid class (having weapon skills). This leaves me a little bitter. More for shaman then skalds though as I saw them as being close to bards then skalds.<br>
<br>
Minstrels are closer to skalds then bards are (speaking from having played all 3 (though only to 10 in the case of bards and minstrels)). I was already bitter about SoS being cheaper and a hell of a lot more effective then FoG, so them getting ae mez annoys me even more. If we take realm skills as part of class balance rather then a seperate thing it seems they have recieved double compensation for the non-assasin stealth nerf. Pretty typical of mythic, they always seem to overcompensate. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=ashval>Ashval</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Participant</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/9/02 6:18:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=221.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bah</span><hr size=1> The catch is that a Skald is a very poor tank though you will not normaly see this until you reach your mid 40s <p>Ashval 4X Kobald Skald -- Iseult</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=gladton>Gladton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Participant</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/15/02 6:02:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=221.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bah</span><hr size=1> Bad tanks?<br>
<br>
Here's a short story explaining the true power of Skalds.<br>
<br>
<br>
One day in Emain Macha near Albion milegate a fight vs a <br>
cleric began.<br>
<br>
I started by double DD'ing him and he instant mezzed me, he<br>
moved away, stunned me and started smiting (standard cleric<br>
tactic(tm)). <br>
<br>
When I got free I started singing the spirit song (+46% vs <br>
spirit now) and moved towards him. When I got there I changed <br>
to damage song, double DD'ed him again and wacked him hard <br>
with my twohanded sword.<br>
<br>
After awhile my hitpoints had dropped very low so I put down<br>
my sword, waited two seconds and used First Aid. That had<br>
been enough to win the fight but suddenly his hitpoints<br>
increased even though I knew his instant(s) were gone. I turned<br>
around and saw a second cleric healing him. I then used my<br>
mez and disabled that cleric and continued the fight. But<br>
the cleric was now fully healed so the fight took longer<br>
than my mez. After a few smites from the second cleric, I had<br>
to use my Ignore Pain and it looked like I would win over<br>
the first cleric anyway. But things just wouldn't go my<br>
way because his 8 friends were now charging towards me from<br>
behind and I had to run away.<br>
<br>
All ten tried to catch me and it shouldn't be too hard<br>
because it takes 10 seconds for my speed to kick in. But I<br>
was lucky and could mez their minstrel. Another tried to<br>
sprint towards me but a snare stopped him. The rest couldn't<br>
catch me before my speed kicked in and I was gone.<br>
<br>
No one died but the moral of the story was that without buffs<br>
a skald solo'ed two clerics and when things looked grim<br>
managed to survive to fight another day. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/uhaulreaper.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HaulReaper</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/17/02 8:55:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=221.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bah</span><hr size=1> fenrisfil sors and minstrals are the main crowd control.  Nobody wants a healer to do it for 2 reasons.<br>
1) range is way short and not long duration<br>
2) dont want a support class getting strait argo from that<br>
<br>
Minstrals can keep something mezed alot longer then a cleric can.<br>
<br>
The only real time I use my mez is to give myself a group bonus or incase of a bad pull.<br>
<br>
Bards can melee OK, try using the battle bard temp.  Bards and mistrals peek at a higher level then skalds do, thats when thier skill fix themselves out.  <br>
<br>
One thing I am STILL trying to figure out is why the MAGIC realm has an endurance song usable in combat and the melee realm does not have it?<br>
The get the same PoM we get from the healers with thier Mentalist's. Albion gets a power song from the minstrals.  Neither us nor alb gets an end song.  Unless you take a friar only vs of this into account.  A power/end song at level 40 would be very nice.  If the kept the same amount of health it gives, and added power/end to the mix calling it something like complete recovery that would fix the higher end health chants as well.  The single target mez is ok, dont really have any complants there.   A few more health points would be very nice, right now when I open in combat I can pull argo if I want to with a combo.  2 DD's and a style usally gives me argo unless there is someone 5+ levels higher or a death hitter.  Just a note for the new skalds the players weapons are alot better then the dropped ones.  I love my War cleaver, thier is nothing like running into battle with a giant butcher knife! <p>Haul<br>

I would also not complain if you said that was always the case. However Mythic stated that the reason for the boost to minstrels was because the Clerics CC was nerfed and that the Clerics were the primary CCers. So it is not me that has the misconception it is Mythic themselves.<br>
<br>
For some reason they forgot about sorcerors, though I suspect it was a case of selective memory. <br>
<br>
I think the truth was they needed an excuse to cover their bungled efforts at balance and saying Clerics were the primary CC class and that nerfing them really took from the realms crowd control was the excuse that fit well enough for them (if no one else). <br>
<br>
