<br>
Bugs: <br>
Damage Adder missing pulses: <br>
We lose our damage add about 1 time in 10 rounds. We believe this is due to the duration of the songs being set at 5 seconds and a pulse is 6 seconds. It leaves a window of 1 second that if you hit or lag in the least, you lose the damage add for that round. This also happens with the Song of Travel line of spells. Increasing our song duration to at lest the same length as a pulse (6 seconds) seems like it would fix the problem. 8 second duration would definitly cover the bug and also be to short to allow twisting (which is not a feature we want) <br>
<br>
Damage Adder Stacking: <br>
The sum of our damage add stacked with the one from a Runemaster or Shaman is equal or less than the solo value of our damage add. Why bother with stacking code if the result is inferior? <br>
<br>
Resist Chant Spam: <br>
We cannot toggle the spam generated by this song line with the options currently available in chat. It is extremely annoying to see the constant barrage of the song effecting and then wearing off. <br>
<br>
Snare not getting aggro: <br>
Casting at a distance will sometimes allow you to cast snare on a mob, and it uses power and endurance, but the mob does not get snared, nor do you get aggro from the mob. If you move closer and try to cast, the timer has been reset and you have to wait until the spell recycles. When this happens, you do not receive a resist message. <br>
<br>
Speed Song and Spindelhalla entrance: <br>
You cannot enter Spindelhalla when using the speed song. You get an out of bounds message. Turning it off or ‘W’alking is the only known way to access Spin <br>
____________________________________________________ <br>
<br>
Issues: <br>
Realm Ability - Fury of the Gods: <br>
This skill is disppointing to say the least as our unique Realm Ability. It is the same concept as the Cleric's Bunker of Faith in reverse. Whereas the Cleric RA reduces group damage taken by 50% for 30 seconds, Fury of the Gods increases group damage for 30 seconds. Here is where the analogy falls short though. Fury of the Gods does not increase damage enough to warrant the purchase of this ability. It does not increase it to the same degree as a Cleric can reduce it. It also is rather costly for a skill (Compared to the Clerics 10 point RA). Consider dropping the cost of this skill to 10 points and increasing the damage in direct relation to the Cleric's ability to reduce it, or dropping the cost to 10 points and recycling it every 15 minutes. I do not like using a comparison like I have above, but it is the closest ability that matches. It does need to be tuned, otherwise it truly will be unique, as only a Skald who did not research the ability would purchase it. Also, keep in mind, since the damage adder dropping bug has not been fixed (still!), we lose our damage adder from this ability as well. Makes for a pretty useless RA. <br>
<br>
Song of Rest needs a boost in power: <br>
At higher levels, the rate of regeneration on this song makes it pointless to use except when soloing. In the 30's it is mildly useful, and at it's highest level it can be compared to putting a mini Band-Aid on a chest wound. Can we up the regen rate a bit? <br>
<br>
Spell Sound Effects: <br>
We love the spell effects, can we now get rid of the laser sound effects and give something more appropriate? It has been requested that the shouts actually sound like shouts, and that the songs sound like songs. Currently it sounds like those cheap ray guns you get at Wal-mart, that you are secretly happy about when they get broken. <br>
<br>
Combining/Tweaking Resist Songs: <br>
Review of resist songs and a request for the possibility to group them in some fashion to cut down on the number of spells. Maybe in sets of 2, cutting down the 6 spells to 3, or combining Songs and splitting between Skalds and another class. <br>
<br>
Access our lower level Snare shouts: <br>
Review of snare and it's power/endurance usage. It uses way to much at the higher levels for only an increase in time. Alternately, allow us to load up our older snare spell line so we can choose which of them we would use. <br>
<br>
Epic Armor Stats: <br>
Currently our Epic Armor is very heavy on Str and Con and light on Charisma. It would be nice if our armor would reflect our stats in their normal way, ie. Char/Str/Con, like our progresion does. <br>
<br>
Epic Armor look: <br>
There have been numerous mentions of dissatisfaction with the look of the Skald’s Epic Armor. If it would be at all possible, could we have a look that is not a copy of another realms’ armor? (But thank you for removing the Albion Grail.) <br>
<br>
Battlesong items <br>
Through numerous tests by numerous Skalds we have finally agreed that Battlesong items do nothing, or if it does do something, then the effect is unnoticable or effects something that we do not use. A review of the Battlesong items needs to be made, and a decision whether the activate them as a functional item or change existing Battlesong items to a stat that would benefit the Skalds. <br>
____________________________________________________ <br>
<br>
Requests: Defensive (If balance requires) <br>
Evade II - Given at a high level, as the last class in the game to receive it. <br>
<br>
HP Boost - A review of our current HP and possible upscaling to give us longer life in battle. <br>
<br>
Medium Shields - Non-trainable, but available so we have more reason to use a 1-handed weapon and shield. <br>
<br>
Requests: Songs (If balance requires) <br>
These are just some song additions that have been thrown around to help with a variety of things from multi-skalds in a group to defense: <br>
<br>
Song of Haste - A chant spell to whip a group into a battle frenzy. Adds to attack speed. <br>
<br>
Song of Protection - A chant to increase armor class. <br>
<br>
Song of Evasion - A chant to increase evasion ability. <br>
<br>
Song of Endurance - At level 50, add endurance and/or power regen to the rest spell. Make it non-combat only. <br>
<br>
____________________________________________________________ <br>
<br>
During the compilation of the report, an interesting topic came up. What exactly is a Skald? Is it a Light Tank, Support Class, or a combination of the two? <br>
According to the polling I did, the bulk of the Skalds believe themselves to be a combination of Suuport class and Light Tank. I agree with this assessment as the Skald is designed, and this report reflects the view of a Skald as a combination. <br>
If this is not the concept Mythic had in mind for the Skald class, then I have 2 other TL reports prepared to cover 'Skald as a Support Class' and 'Skald as a Light Tank'. <br>

One thing which is not a skald specific one, but interesting.<br>

Why crafters are not able to quick repair their own equipement ?<br>

<br>
Pls take out if <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ballance requires</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> on &quot;Requests: Defensive&quot; and possibly for chants which in my mind is open for debate.<br>
<br>
Also, pls ask for a reduction on the recast timer for mez (I wrote a small description if you agree which needs to be put into good english):<br>
- The Skald is the only &quot;bard&quot; like character that does not get AE mez. This could be countered by drastically reducing the recast time on single target mez and unaltering its duration to max 29 seconds.<br>
This would allow the skald to help out in big battles where Healers where not available. Obviously, if a healer was available this would be of no use as the duration is too short and it would effectively take out a light tank from the frey to try and fill in for mez duty.<br>
Therefore we can conclude that this would have no effect on ballancing the realms. <p><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="http://users.iol.it/okandrea/EreNi.gif"></CENTER></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/ueregil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eregil</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://users.iol.it/okandrea/Eregil.gif" BORDER=0> at: 7/5/02 8:38:39 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/ujaliawolfsdottir.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jalia Wolfsdottir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Contributor</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/9/02 8:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=226.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: July Skald Report</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Requests: Songs (If balance requires) <br>

<br>
I mentioned this last time and you didn't take it to heart then, and aparently haven't again. You NEED to take this kind of language out of the reports. Saying &quot;These are just some ideas we had...&quot; IMMEDIATELY lets the developers know that they don't have to pay attention to it. If you don't feel strongly enough about the suggestions to present them as anything more than ideas that have been kicked around, then why on earth should they?<br>
<br>
Furthermore, resubmitting the same report isn't going to make the developers say, &quot;oops, we forgot to address these issues&quot;. It's more likely going to make them say, &quot;didn't I read this same report last month? What's the matter, didn't they have time to write a new report?&quot; Even if it is the same information, restate it with phrases like, &quot;As I stated last month...&quot; and, &quot;This still hasn't been adressed despite being reported several times in the past...&quot; <br>
<br>
Don't be petty and make personal attacks, but don't let them off the hook! It's their responsibility to fix bugs, and they have to know it's a priority for us.  <p><img src="

<br>
The Skald class IMHO and that of a bunch of Skalds is that our class is essentially balanced at this current time. Some are hinting that the Skald is overpowered and needs tuning down even (Which is not needed).<br>
<br>
I purposly put that statement in so that if anything changes in the future we have at our disposal a list of items that can be used to rebalance the Skald class.<br>
<br>
Any of the items that are listed under those titles would tilt us out of balance for the most part, requiring a tuning in the opposite direction.<br>
<br>
Would the benefit of getting some of those skills at this time outweigh the detriment to our class when things that we currently have are changed or taken away?<br>
<br>
We have a fun class right now, that has some issues, but by far, we definitly have a good balance between our magic side and our melee side.<br>
<br>
As for reusing the report, well, they asked us for a report and since there was no changes whatsoever from the last month to our class, the same report worked.<br>
<br>
Bugs are listed on the report as a reminder only, all bugs I receive are sent directly by email to the actual developer who is in charge of the area the bug is in (ie, damage dropping goes to the spell guy), their listing on the report is merely for the general public to see them and as a small reminder to the devs I have spoken to.  Believe me, They get quite a few emails from me as it is.<br>
<br>
I hope that explained why the report is like it is, but I have to keep in mind always our Balance in relation to our own realm and that of the other realms when asking for anything.<br>

This is our fundamental disagreement in a nutshell. You're putting far to much responsibility on yourself. I'll list my assumptions here, so any incorrect ones can be corrected:<br>
<br>
1. You're not employed by Mythic.<br>
2. You're a volunteer.<br>
3. You don't have any meetings with the Camelot Live team.<br>
4. Aside from any personal relationships you've been able to develop, you don't get any more explanation about why things are done than the rest of us do.<br>
<br>
I've never seen a job description for a class team leader, but from what is generally understood, it is NOT your job to balance the Skald class. It is not your job to consider the implications to game-wide balance of suggestions the Skald community makes.<br>
<br>
What IS your job, is to gather the opinions of the community at large and present them, to the developers. It then becomes THEIR job to sort through the suggestions and separate the good from the bad. Frankly, I don't believe you, or any of us, know enough about Mythic's plans to make the kind of judgements you're apparently taking upon yourself.<br>
<br>
Don't go trying to do their job for them by editorializing. It will only serve to make you crazy.<br>
<br>
Lastly...<br>

If that statement (&quot;These are some ideas we threw around...&quot;) weren't there, the list is still at our disposal. Nothing is gained by including that statment in the report, but the report is most definitely weakened by having it in there. <p><img src="

We do have a lot more contact with the Live team now than ever before. Any email I send regardless if they know me personally or not is met with a response and an explanation pretty quickly.<br>
<br>
We also are privy to upcoming changes (Not all, but we do get information about what is coming more often now) so that does color how we look at things.<br>
<br>
For example, Hypothetical situation here:<br>
<br>
Skalds are being looked at closely to determine if they are balanced or overpowered. Tests are run and live data examined to check the rate of levelling and RP totals for skalds across all servers.  I would know that this is currently being done.<br>
<br>
They ask for a TL report, I post a report filled with requests for things to add to the class.  Nothing in the report mentions toning down anything, only adding things to a class that is already being examined as being too powerful.  <br>
<br>
How can I as TL of that class ask for the changes knowing that we are already considered more than we should be by the developers?<br>
<br>
Again, This is a hypothetical situation, I am not saying that is currently being discussed.<br>
<br>
We are, as TLs, supposed to take balance of the realm and other realms into consideration when making requests.  Some of us actually do that, some tend to be a little more biased.<br>
<br>
The Skald is important to me personally. It is the only class I ever loved, and the only class that fits me as a player.  I have been championing the Skald class since it was created in beta, and always have only the best interests of the class a a whole at heart.   I am alo unbiased enough to see the effect of the Skald in relation to other classes. If I honestly was convinced we were overpowered, I would ask for things to be changed as well as if we were considered underpowered.<br>
<br>
As it is, my personal opinions of changes are not reflected in the TL reports, because an item or 2 in that lower category are things I want us to have too.  And there are things in the topmost categories that I just disagree with personally, but the bulk of the Skalds believe in it, so it is there.<br>
<br>
Mythic really does do a good job for the most part with the game (There is a lot more going on in the background than people realize) but one thing they tend to not do so good is tune classes.  They eventually correct what they wanted to correct, but they tend to overdo it (Anyone in beta can tell you about the famous drum incident, the 1/2 DD damage shout, casting times on all chants, etc)<br>
<br>
I am just trying to make sure that as we are tuned, it is done evenly and at the appopriate times.  <br>
<br>
Please also keep in mind, the TL reports are more for you guys than for them. Many of the items in he TL reports are taken directly to the developers, even those items listed under that disclaimer topic header.<br>
<br>
Phew, I hope I made sense.  Basically all I wanted to say is I am passionate about the class, but the TL reports and the items that I take directly to the devs do not neccesarily reflect my personal feelings.  This is the Skald class, not the Rosey class, I am merely a player who cares deeply about it's progress.<br>

We just don't agree on how I am going about it, because:<br>

1. You (as in not just you but everyone) can't know for sure what I have going on in the background and things I have been told that I am not allowed to repeat.<br>

I don't think anyone is questioning your dedication or passion you devote to our class and I honestly think that we really have one of the best TL available. Basically, you do a fantastic job!<br>
<br>
What struck me from your reply was this:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Skalds are being looked at closely to determine if they are balanced or overpowered.

<br>
So this is how they balance classes? If some class has a lot of RPs then they get the nerf axe? How about accounting for the quality of the player that plays that character? What about the groups they are in for leveling?<br>
<br>
I made a Runemaster, for example, and after 12 hours played he is lvl18 (would have been much faster than that if we had a healer with us). Is this because RM are Uber? No, its because I am in a good guild and we all help each other out.<br>
<br>
But how does Mythic account for this? In their logs it will show that I levelled very fast so lets nerf RMs now?<br>
<br>
Balancing realms is actually very easy IMHO, set out on a piece of paper all the skills/styles/spells available to all realms. Then give the same things to all the realms, but just divide them up so that you can maintain class diversity. That way, every realm would be equal in what they could do and no one could bitch about the other classes.<br>
<br>
Sadly this is not the case as, for example, my enchanter at lvl44 will be able to give a 10dps dmg adder to tanks and pet, any class in Midgard that can do that?<br>
<br>
Its sad to see how Mythic does things. They have made a really good game and now they make every effort to destroy it.<br>
<br>
The next frontier for them now is the server population imbalance and adding content to stop the draining of cancelled accounts. IMO, this will be their final chance to stop this bleeding. If they fail patch 1.52 and they don't address population problems on servers it will mark their final doom. Then we can be all passionate as we want about our class, but it will make no difference as there will be no one left to play.<br>
<br>

After playing a toon on Albion/Merlin a while, I have come to the conclusion that Mythic obviously put way more effort and resources into the development of that realm. The level of detail, number of NPC's, and the general layout is quite well developed. After all, the name of the game is Dark Age of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Camelot</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> not Dark Age of Midgard or Hibernia. I would imagine that Mythic developed the Albion realm first, which would explain why there is so much there to offer the new player. <br>
<br>
There are very few servers that are balanced in population. Merlin seems to very close in balance. Relics are traded back and forth regularly and Hibernia is the realm with the highest rps. As I play my Sorc there, I have to smile when I see in the guild chat the same comments about the Mids that I have been accustomed to seeing against the Albs on Galahad. <br>
<br>
The only solution to the population imbalance I can see is to simply set a cap disallowing any new players from joining a realm that has  some arbitrary percentage of population higher than either of the other two realms. There are enough servers where they can easily implement this solution. <p><b>__________________________________________<br>

Realm ability:  Mastery of the Arcane<br>

Except to 1% resist increase to resist songs every 2 levels<br>
It supposed to effect Run Fast, but will not allow you to exceed the 106% max speed.<br>
<br>
This realm ability, like all other abilities should allow you to exceed the traditional caps, or be removed from Skalds ability all together, being effectively worthless.<br>
<br>
Song Pulsing:<br>
I have noticed in addition to the damage song pulsing and not taking effect on swings on occasion, but the run fast song will do this as well.  This will give you this speed up / slow down effect.<br>

<br>
I'd like to add a couple things:<br>
<br>
1) Skalds need more songs. On Mordred, there's at least 3-5 skalds in any group. With so many, there's not enough songs for each to play. You got damage chant and regen..and that's it. Some sort of power, end regen, af, hp, melee resists, or haste would be nice. Or any of the million other things listed on various sites. Just so everyone is playing something that benefits the group.<br>
<br>
2) Skald 25 epic. For  our 25 epic you get a chestpiece. But there are two one time drops in Musp and one in Skona Ravine that are *better* then the 25 epic. It's like, Hi, here's your useless epic. Can we maybe change the 25 epic to something that will last longer? Like maybe boots or a nice belt? I would give an O-face for that nice resist belt Little Star drops. Around 20-33ish this is what you have available as quests/OTDs for chain armor:<br>
<br>
4 chestplates (hrodrik, charred skeleton commander, askfroaa, 25 epic chest)<br>
1 legs (laesar)<br>
1 arms (wurm lord +18 str)<br>
1 helm (cerus)<br>
1 hands from level 20 epic, nice hands, 4% crush resist<br>

Basically the only thing you don't have around that level are some nice chain boots or some magic items like belt. There are nice cloaks, bracers, jewels, necklaces, and rings at that level.<br>
<br>
As someone who comes from a PVP server(Mordred), I have to tell you 90% of my equipment is OTDs and epics. Not many can afford player made goods, and there aren't many player made goods to be had (yet anyway).<br>
<br>
3) Skald 30 epic. That cloak. The stats suck. Bad. Fire resist? Gee, I don't have enough of that from my Cerus Helm, Fire Cloak, and Wurm Lord sleeves. Heck at mid 20s I was way capped in fire resist. Be nice if we changed the stats on this to something more useful, and included charisma and maybe parry or weapon spec.<br>

Review of snare and it's power/endurance usage. It uses way to much at the higher levels for only an increase in time. Alternately, allow us to load up our older snare spell line so we can choose which of them we would use. <br>
------<br>
<br>
I'd like to see the same modification for our run speed songs. Basically, If you have one group with 43 song speed and one group with second best speed song (or worse), you'll often end up to everyone going to healer speed or waiting for the lower level skald's group to catch up everytime.<br>
