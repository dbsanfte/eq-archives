<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Dropped Pulses:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Damage Adder and Speed Song (and Regen song, but hard to see this one) are dropping pulses on a regular basis.  Recently a change went in to possibly correct this issue, but it did not fix it.  <br>
<br>
It is not uncommon to miss 2 Adders during a single battle.  Speed song drops as well, though it happens more frequently when there are 2 Skalds in a group both running the Speed Chant.  <br>
<br>
Initially I thought the changes had worked for Wardens and Paladins, but after speaking with them, all the chants are dropping pulses.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Speed Song/Combat:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
When any member of a Skald's party is attacked, the Speed Song is dropping for every member in the group.  This bug crept in since v1.50 went in, and needs to be addressed.  Prior to v1.50 only the person in active combat had the Speed song drop.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Misfires of Damage Shouts:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
On occasion if you cast a Damage Shout on a mob from the outer fringes or the range (Which is very small BTW) you will see the spell effect, get a message that it has been cast, but the mob takes no damage. Since the range of the Damage shouts are so small, there is no reason why we would be out of range of a resist message. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Long Term Issues Not Addressed</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Stacking of Damage Adder:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Currently the Skald's Damage Adder value is halved and the stacked Adder is appended to the Skald DA.  THis results in a total Damage Add equal to or less than the Skald's Damage Add alone.  The Skald's Damage Adder should not be halved, but the stacked Adder should be, which will result in an actual benefit of stacking the Damage Adders.  Otherwise, why have stacking available at all?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Damage Adder Radius:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The Damage Adder radius needs to be increased to 1500 minimum to allow a Skald's group to spread out more.  700 Range on a group chant only lends itself to AoE damage/CC.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Fury of the Gods:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
This unique RA grants us with a 30 second once every 30 minutes Damage Adder at the cost of 14 RSP.  This seriously needs a review.  At the minimum, it should be changed to a 1 minute every 15 minute Damage Adder at a cost of 10 RSP.  Even then, it would be considered an iffy proposition, but at least it could be a justified purchase.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Song of Rest:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
What can I say about a Chant that at level 50 give 12HP back every sitting pulse?  Nothing nice, I assure you.  This chant is the bane of every class that gets it.  Consider a total review of it for the Skald's and the other classes that receive it. (Bards,Minstrels)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Power/Endurance:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Like other Shout classes, we pay the price for our shouts doubly.  Consider dropping substantially (or remove) the Endurance requirement for the shouts for all shout classes.  What was originally put in as a means of limiting damage is no longer needed due to the changes to the game to limit damage in other ways.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Requests</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The Skald's are not considered a tank.  They are considered backup melee and support, yet we receive few tool that actually lend itself to support of a group.  In that vein, these are the requests for changes/additions to the Skald class to give them the option of actually supporting their group.  Also, please keep in mind, Skald's cannot twist their chants, so any chant playing will be playing alone, unless they are grouped with another Skald.  All of these items do not need to be added/changed, but are presented here as some ideas that can quicken the process.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Rally Chant:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
This is a proposed new chant to be added to our BS spec. This chant will have the effect of Haste on a Skald's party. This would also not help a solo Skald, but would contribute to a Skald's value in a group.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Resist songs:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The current value of the resist songs and the levels they are attained at are not an issue. The fact that they have to be split into 6 different chants is. Combine these into 3 sets of 2 <br>
resists at a minimum or preferably 2 sets of 3 as was done for another support melee class. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Damage Shield Chant:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The ability to reflect a little damage back to the attacker. Would be a group friendly spell.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>New Song of Actual Rest:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
An Out of Combat rest chant with more Health regen per pulse than the current Song of Rest, plus Regen of Power and Regen of Endurance. The out of combat version will not effect a solo Skald except in less downtime between battles. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Commentary</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Skalds are a good class, quickly losing it's way amongst a myriad of changes/additions to the game.  The Skald class is by no means broken, but with the substantial changes going on around them in Midgard and against them in Hibernia/Albion, their duty to their group is becoming less important and needs to be looked at before they fall too far behind the curve.<br>
<br>
The bulk of the Skalds want our bugs fixed, the long term issues addressed (even if the answer is 'not gonna happen', and our requests at least considered.  I have had numerous conversations with Skalds, and they truly do not want to be an 'uber' class that so many people think they want to be.  I doubt any class in DAoC wants that for themselves, because it takes away the fun from playing this game as much as being too underpowered.<br>
<br>
I ask anyone wishing to find out more about Skalds and their feelings about their class to visit our Team Skald discussion website at <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald">pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and see the real people playing the class and how they feel.  I think most people would be suprised.<br>

There are a lot of dark runies out there with better damage adds than us.  The optimal stacking solution is to take the highest damage add plus 1/2 of the lower one.  We don't want to nerf the 10dps dark runie damage adds.<br>
<br>
Just getting the dropped pulses fixed and the speed dropping for the whole group issue fixed - my god that would make me so happy.  I hate chasing runners only to lose speed completely.<br>
<br>
Does dropped speed and missing pulses affect bards/minstrels?  I ask because I am never able to stay even with them if I chase, SoS excluded.  Do I understand correctly that bards can twist speed/end regen, and can thus sprint longer? <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------

<br>
With regards to speed song and bards...this has been an ongoing issue.  The run song on bard drops when bard is simply targeted. Some reason Mythic things 'targeting' and 'in combat' are same things.<br>
<br>
With respects to the question about bards 'twisting' endo and speed song.  Yes, it is possible to do this.  In rvr to do this is a rarity.  As stated above, your speed song drops when targeted.  As a bard, you are THE number one target for enemiesl; therefore you speed songs drops.  Takes several seconds for it to pulse back up.   Last thing you want to do is draw attention to yourself.  If you have not played a bard, you don't realize what is involved in twisting.  You have to equipe weapon first, hit song...let pulse...hit other instrument...nother key for song x2 to get song going...let pulse...rinse and repeat.  This plays havoc on wrists.  and if oyu are doing this you can't; mezz, heal, lull, sprint around in cicles so you don't die.<br>
<br>
I was excited about coming and playing skald because:<br>
1) Castabe endo from Shamies.  OMG I am in heaven here.  I can play speed AND have endo without having to 'twist' songs or have two bards in group.<br>
2) I dont' have to equipe any type of instrument for songs!  I love this!!!!<br>
3) I can tank<br>
4) I can tank <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Bard also has same issue of healing song being very poor.  Only diffrence is bard has to equipe lute to do so. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=breeanamlf>Breeana MLF</A> at: 11/21/02 10:53:40 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kjeld>Kjeld</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Fervent</span><br>  Posts: 159<br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/21/02 10:54:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=407.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hmmm</span><hr size=1> It's a great report, and I wholeheartedly agree with the contents of this post.<br>
<br>
That's just me, but I liked the tone and content of last month's report better than this one. I am sorry to say that, but with Mythic ever more than other MMORPG running company, only the most noisy squeaky wheels will ever have a hope to get some grease (that is, unrequested changes 6 months too late, but heh, better that than no attention at all). All of this because Mythic is a small company, which seems to genuinely lack manpower. They throw band aids at the most obvious blood gushing wounds, and they have no time to do anything but ignore itchings.<br>
<br>
I am not saying that your post should be harsh, agressive or exagerated, or inflamatory, but to show signs of the fact it is simply a scandal that some ***bugs*** are on your list since what ? 6 months ? close to one year ? and that it is really getting on our nerves (along with the mantra of 90% of the player base &quot;skalds are fine, mythic, please, don't even spend one second of your time to fix any bugs pertaining to them, while my thane/cabalist/cleric/crazed lycanthic still sucks in RvR&quot; which is really getting on my nerves even more than Mythic's apathy concerning our class <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).<br>
<br>
My opinion is that you should not even ask for any things that will boost the skald class with anything *new* (even if many of us, including me, find that some of them are justified : additional songs, endurance/power regen, evade 2+, additional spec points, bigger and speccable shields and the like). <br>
<br>
I think many here will disagree with me, however I think the mindset of both Mythic and the community will not change soon in regards to skalds. <br>
<br>
Heck it took a lot of time, a whole lot of time for players to realize archer classes where way &quot;overnerfed&quot;. While they were clearly overpowered, there was a string of constant nerfing, that should have stopped at some point of balance but kept going on, because people were still perceiving archers as overpowered at the time they were brought into line. <br>
On the other hand, assassin classes were massively underpowered and not finished at all at release time, and Mythic kept giving them powerful abilities after another abilities, contradicting themselves sometimes (giving more spec points to make up for the need to spec in more skills, and at the same time pruning redundant skills like climb), and with a slew of extra powers just as a (conscious or not) apology for not putting in promised disguise, locked doors in relic keeps, and the like ...<br>
Same situation here. They should have stopped at some point ... but the class was still perceived as lacking (esp in PvE), so they added quite a bit more goodies (like overpowered RA's) before stopping - too late. Now they (and we) have to live with a class with no natural &quot;predator&quot; in RvR.<br>
<br>
This constatation is a bit harsh, and I think many will disagree with it, however, on the basis of those exemples, I feel that convincing mythic and the community that skalds are not what they are believed will be a lost battle at this time. The community will never stop to ask for skald nerfs until it will be obvious that the class has been gimped to oblivion. So maybe a more pragmatic approch, with less &quot;it will be nice to have&quot; things (that they will never give us) and at the same time a more agressive focus about your excellent first two chapters &quot;bugs&quot; and &quot;long standing issues&quot;.<br>
<br>
IMHO - and it's only my opinion, you should have  insteadthem to fix our (censored) (deleted) (insert words inappropriate for a TL here) (censored) bugs, or even start to acknowledge them while showing our community is *very* tired of those missing pulses and schizophrenic random speed drops, and strongly ask them the reasoning behind some faulty design decisions (who smell like spreadsheet errors for me) : namely, why do our (and minstrel's, who happen to be on the same table) damage shouts are twice as much power/endurance consuming at a per damage point basis than any other instacast DD in the game (wielded by BOTH melee hybrids, and support classes -btw this is my pet peeve, and I'd really like to see this on the report), why is the damage song of wardens and skald the only group song/pulsing/castable ability with a 700 range (they even fixed paladin's dmg add range up to 1500 ...) ... and what the heck are we supposed to do with the &quot;song of rest&quot;  and &quot;fury of the gods&quot; ?<br>
<br>
Keep it simple. Keep it on the core focuses, don't ask for spec points and additional songs they will never, ever give to us. I think a skald with a dependable speed song, a consistent damage add that will encompass the whole group in most common situations, works every time and stacks well with shm/run abilities, and an halved cost on shouts (it's not asking for an overpowering thing, or asking that the &quot;endurance usage penalty&quot; that every hybrids face should be removed - it's asking to simply bring our shouts up to par with all others in the game. How scandalous is it ?), will be quite a bit be more useful to the group that it is now. Focusing on the urgency of those simple fixes should imho be a top priority.<br>
<br>
Your post and your involvment is great. I hope you'll take my post the right way, it is not a criticism of your work, but my perception of the whole thing, and hopefully constructive feedback. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kjeld>Kjeld</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Fervent</span><br>  Posts: 160<br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/21/02 11:03:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=407.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hmmm</span><hr size=1> 3) I can tank<br>

If you believe that, you'll be sorely disappointed. It is very true that Skalds have a much better melee damage output than bards, however, they barely tank better then bards. <br>
<br>
Same hp table as bards <br>
Low parry skill because of the 1.5* per level. &quot;Flavor of the months&quot; skald template have parry &lt;10. <br>
No shield (you have to go 2H weapons to do damage anyway).<br>
Chain armor, but you can't buff AF/con like bards do.<br>
<br>
Skalds have no use of instruments and can wield big mean weapons, so they will definitely have more fun engaging in melee combat than bards. But if you intend to &quot;tank&quot; in the strict sense of the word (ie : be the target of a tough monster or player enemy), you'd better reroll immediately to a shield warrior/armsman/merc/champion.<br>

The Warden carryover was from the DA chants.<br>
<br>
As for the tone of this report, I went back to a lighter tone this time around for 2 reasons:<br>
<br>
1. The last (more aggresive report) did nothing different from the ones before it<br>
2. Someone new is reading the TL reports and I felt a gentler introduction would be a better way to go.  <br>
<br>
I have no qualms about going back to the way the last report was worded and will do that if it is necessary.  I don't expect anything to get changed prior to SI release, asnd we have to write a TL report after each patch, so I would expect to see any hopeful changes in 1.56 where I will be hitting the hardest on a 1 to 1 basis in getting some things addressed.  <br>
<br>
I am hoping that at least our bugs will get addressed before 1.56, but with 12 days till the release of SI (and US Thankgiving holiday right in the middle of it) I somehow doubt it.<br>
<br>
But at least they have the info in their hands, right?<br>

With those additional informations, then I have to agree with you and withdraw my comments. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

My comments assumed nothing had changed at all. I honestly don't have high hopes, but with SI release pressure and the &quot;class report staff&quot; change, your stance makes a lot of sence.<br>

<br>
While I do withdraw my comment about the tone of the post, I still think you should point to their attention the hard facts (numbers) about our (and minstrel's) DD shouts cousting twice as much as any other DD shouts in the game. <br>
<br>
Asking for them to remove or lower endurance usage on our shouts will (imho) get us nowhere, because it is pretty much a design decision they took to balance hybrids with the &quot;pure&quot; melee classes. <br>
<br>
Asking them &quot;vaguely&quot; to review the costs of our shouts because we feel they are too costly, won't do any good either (&quot;skalds are fine&quot; (tm), why review the cost of their shouts).<br>
<br>
However, pointing out, with hard numbers (no need to parse, those number are on the herald <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), a discrepancy between the skalds and the rest of the classes, both &quot;music/support&quot; (bards) and &quot;melee support/hybrid&quot; (thane, champion) concerning DD shout costs is definitely valid, and it is a question Mythic can NOT dodge or brush off that easily.<br>
<br>
If we can get our shouts to be brought up to par with the rest of the world - halving their cost - it will solve one of the big skald issues without involving anything else than a &quot;bug&quot; fix.<br>

<br>
Some of the new mechanisms to lower our damage but don't effect tanks are resists.  How many times have you blown your power/endurance for nothing because the target had a high body resist?  Body type is pretty common, and most of us hybrids are of that type, so in just that one case, our damage is already, noticbly lessened.<br>
<br>
The changes the RAs also set us apart from tanks, and supposedly there will be something else for Warriors at least that will put them even futher from us (and yay! for Warriors, finally)<br>
<br>
We also don't get benefits of our magic side in a few things which limits our damage, ie. no crits for our shouts, castable acuity buffs mean nothing to us.<br>
<br>
All in all, I think it is time to roll back the endurance requirement for casting because it would help the hybrids keep current in the damage output, not overpower them.  But that is just my opinion, and you know what they say about those <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
However, there are some issues that I would like to address : the dmg adder stacking, the resist chants and the medium shields ability.<br>
<br>
What Ororo7 said about the damage adder is perfectly right. The only way for the stacking of dmg add song and dmg add spell to work in all possible situations is to add the best one with half of the lesser one.<br>
<br>
Imagine you are a big fat troll that has a knack for cooking hibernians. If he wants to cook together a firbolg and a celt, but doesnt have room to put the firbolg and celt together in the pot, he will have 2 solutions:<br>
1) cut the celt in half: he will get more food than if he had only the firbolg cooked<br>
2) cut the firbolg in half : he will get more than the celt in his cooking pot<br>
<br>
Now, if he wants to cook a celt together with a lurikeen, he has two solutions :<br>
1) cut the lurikeen in half: he will get more food than if he had only cooked the celt <br>
2) cut the celt in half : will be tasty (lurikeen meat is more tasty, the more the better) but it will produce less food than if he had only cooked a celt : that is because the celt is more than two times bigger than the lurikeen. The same goes for the dmg adder stacking.<br>
<br>
Now, if you don't understand the stacking of dmg adders with this explanation, try cooking more hibernians, they are tasty. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
There is an issue about resist chants that you don't speak about, it is the spamming. I play my skald on the european servers which are a few versions behind so perhaps the problem has been resolved recently ? I never use these songs because of the #@!$#&amp;% spam.<br>
 <br>
Last thing I want to speak about is the medium shields issue. That is really something that could help the defensive skald without changing the concept of the class, as Evade II, more hit points or shields specialisation would. I really think you should ask for medium shields in the report. <br>

Even asking for speccable shields will not really help, because we'd still be stuck with 1.5 spec points/level.<br>
<br>
Asking for something which won't benefit us at all is imho counterproductive. If we really want to have more defensive abilties, we should ask for evade II or more spec points. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=407.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=407.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=407.topic&index=12><img src=http://www.stuckathome.com/skalded/images/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=407.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.threadControl?topicID=407.topic><img src=http://www.stuckathome.com/skalded/images/closethread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=407.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=407.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub36.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="teamskaldfrm1">General Discussion<option value="teamskaldfrm6">Bug Forum<option value="teamskaldfrm5">Test Planning<option value="teamskaldfrm4">Logs and Test Results<option value="teamskaldfrm7">Wish List<option value="teamskaldfrm9">Equipment Discussions<option value="teamskaldfrm10">RvR Discussions<option value="teamskaldfrm11">PvE Discussions<option value="teamskaldfrm12">Quest Discussions<option value="teamskaldfrm13">Informational Lists, Etc.<option value="teamskaldfrm8">Moderator Discussions</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald>Team Skald</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1>General Discussion</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br> <!-- #EndEditable -->
