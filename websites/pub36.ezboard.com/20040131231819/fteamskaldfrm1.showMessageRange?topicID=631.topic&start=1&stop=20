----------------------------------------- <br>
Skald Report - Post 1.62 <br>
<br>
Overview <br>
<br>
Skalds suffer from the lack of definition for their class. The result of this is that the Skald has watched their damage output scale downward as changes in the game are implemented, and their group support abilities overshadowed by other classes within the realm. Currently the perception is that the class has become little more than a speed dealer for RvR. This is a far cry from the original Skald which was able to front-load damage to make a difference in battles. All damage dealing/group abilities have remained unchanged since the game was released while the game itself has changed drastically. <br>
<br>
Concerns <br>
<br>
Damage Adder range and DPS <br>
Given that the Damage Adder was considered the primary in-battle group ability of the Skald, it would stand to reason that it would also be a worthy chant. With it's current 700 range and the bug with dropping pulses, it has become less valuable. The Skald DA at the very least, needs to have the bugs fixed and the range increased to 1500. Increasing the DPS would be very well received too. The Skald's unique RA is also another DA, which further lends the impression that DA is suposed to be the Skald's domain. Also note that this chant is also available to Wardens and Paladins, and in both cases, this song is not their "first choice" in battle (in fact, they are rarely used in RvR groups with only one Warden/Paladin), which is a good indicator by itself of the perceived valuability of this song, yet it is our top combat support song ... a bit weak if we were to be categorized as a "support" class, thus explaining our lower melee performances. <br>
<br>
Direct Damage Shouts <br>
The Skald has two DD shouts, the War<xxx> line and the Battle <xxx> line. Both DD shouts are on seperate 20 second timers, both are body resist, and both have 700 range. The spell resist situation is such that the determining factor in whether a spell lands or is resisted is based on the Spell level vs Target as opposed to Spec level vs Target. Since the War<xxx> line of DD shouts caps out at level 34, the chance of landing the spell successfully is rather low. These shouts are duplicates of the Minstrel's shouts (which are on 15 second timers) and the Bard's single shout (Same as our lines, except combined into a single shout, 10 second recast). Also note that skalds who wish to follow the "offensive" skald route (50 weapon) will have to rely on a level 26 Battle xxx shout, which, with the lower level damage add, considerably weaken the "battlesong" source of damage for that kind of spec. But even for a 46/44/17 skald (or a 50 BS skald), the low level on the second shout is an hindrance. <br>
<br>
Skald Defense <br>
Chain, evade I, 1.5 spec points, parry (but with the low number of spec points, 1-17 tops in parry score unless we want to gimp ourselves), unspeccable small shield, low Dex and Qui which don't raise with level, no spell or innate ability that directly add to our defense or hits (whether buffs, armor chants, abs buffs, BT or ablatives ...) This is the worst defensive skill set among the classes that are required to go to melee to be effective (remember the range on shouts and damage add, plus a Skald is supposed to melee after all) : most melee hybrids, among other magical abilities (from Paladin AF buff and chant to Thane's or Champion's Str/Con buffs), can benefit from 2.0 spec and speccable shield; Minstrels have better evade with same armor type and benefit from ablative song; Wardens have scale, can spec parry, and has the huge advantage of the PBT; Friars, light tanks and assassin classes have, among other things (light tanks huge hp tables, Friar's various buffs including absorption), high to very high evades scores to more than make up for lighter armor types. On paper, Skalds have a bit better direct melee defense than Bards and healing classes ... but those classes are effective and useful at range, and not required to melee to fulfill their roles. <br>
<br>
Group offerings <br>
The other support/melee classes among the realms offer a lot more to the group than the Skald, either within or outside of battle. A single Skald within an RvR group can supply the means to transport the group to battle, which is truly the only thing we excel at. During the battle the Skald can provide their DA chant if the members of the group stay close together (allowing them to be AoE suceptable). If you have a second Skald in the group you can add one of the single resist chants. We can use our Mez ability on a single target in close range(700) and we can use our DDs to interrupt, although at 700, melee is just as useful and has less downsides. The Skald is only considered needed in RvR for their speed. <br>
<br>
Specline Issues <br>
<br>
Battlesongs- This specline is required for the Skald to do their damage and bring what group ability they have to a group. It is the primary Spec line to spend points on. It does need to be looked at as the return on investment on the defacto Spec line is not up to snuff. Typical Skald Spec is 46 so that the Skald may receive the final Damage Adder Chant. <br>
<br>
Weapon - Like all Midgardians, we have 3 weapon Specs to choose from. This is usually the second thing for a Skald to raise since they have to raise Battlesongs to be effective. Typical Skald Spec is 44 so that the Skald may receive the level 44 weapon style. <br>
<br>
Parry - The only Speccable means of defense for the Skald is relegated to getting the leftover Spec points. A typical Skald will end up with a Parry of 17. <br>
<br>
We would like to also note that an alternative specialization template is gaining popularity : 50 weapon (almost always axe for the 50 style), 43 BS, leftover in parry. This spec line basically throws away most of the benefits of the Battlesong line, with the exception of speed 5 (notably : the "strong" battleshout is effectively destroyed, and the damage add song is a substandard one). However, the fact that some Skalds still decide to go this route to scrap a few more points of weapon damage is a testament to both Skald woes in melee combat and to the poor state of the battlesong line. <br>
<br>
New Issues <br>
<br>
Melee defense fixes - While the fix is a nice one for the general health of the game, like many changes that were done in the past year, it just scales down even more the Skald compared to most melee classes. <br>
<br>
Resist rates - A current problem expressed by most casters, it both affects Skald damage output (shouts) and CC. <br>
<br>
Damage Adder changes - With Patch 1.58, Damage Adders were changed to prevent the usage of the spell for power-levelling. This effected a Skald's DA spell in a negative manner, although the Skalds DA could not be used outside of a group, and therefore not as a levelling tool. This change also effect our unique realm ability, Fury of the Gods. <br>
<br>
Other Issues <br>
<br>
-The value of +Battlesong items <br>
-6 single resist chants <br>
-Fury of the Gods Realm ability <br>
-Design of Skald Epic armor <br>
<br>
Item Problems <br>
<br>
Skalds can not spec in shields but have access to 2 handed weapons. The offensive bonus granted by a two handed weapon is much more significant than the chances to defend with an unspecced small shield. So skalds use two handed weapons 99% of the time, keeping a fast one hander for specific situations only (essentially, dealing with PBT). <br>
Yet, a significant number of "Skald" weapons (weapons with Charisma and/or Battlesongs) are one handed, and there are also Charisma/Battlesongs small shields. <br>
It is nice that a few of those situationals items exists ... But 3 known one handers and one small shield in the epic dungeon vs 2 two handers that I can think of ... it is not appropriate with the real use of those weapons. <br>
<br>
+ Battlesongs bonus. <br>
This issue is just an eternal source of misunderstanding, which sometimes just breeds ill feelings. To sum the issue up : yes, it works, but no, it isn't worth it. <br>
We know that it does something (has a small impact on shout damage), and as such, we understand that it should be put on some RNG and hand made item. However, please understand that, with the limited total number of imbue points all over a skald body, +battlesong bonus is so low a priority that it is not commonly found on any template. As en exemple, maxing out charisma add WAY more damage to shouts than maxing battlesongs. As such, we kindly request you to keep +battlesong bonus out of "epic" hand made loot, and high level, high end loot and quest rewards. <br>

I for one, have stopped using my skald in rvr, preferring toplay my shaman, who is needed for that end regen buff and AE dots.  My skald is now relegated to defence and/or crafting armor for the more useful savages and hunters.  <br>

I cant even suggest more improvements to the class than what we already have suggested.  <br>

Please, please, please put some more in about our lame class RA. I will help out with any testing we need to do. I did some half ass testing with it on pendragon. I have also made a few posts about it on the boards here. <br>
<br>
It's an RA that, best case, will add 600-700 Group damage in 30 seconds period if there are 5 melee types. That's so freaking lame <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I listed the RA under Other Issues so it will be on there and I can bring that up seperate from the actual TL report.  I just couldn't put it in the upper section in place of some of the things we have under concerns.  Our base ability needs to be addressed first before the RA IMHO, though I totally agree with you on FotG, it's a very poor ability at a huge cost.<br>

I'm sure someone else is supposed to report on styles, but more attention really should be brought to the idiocy that is Midgard weapon styles.<br>

Yeah, it's changed.  We have a standardized template for reports now.  That's why it looks different and has a different feel.  It's the same for all Class reports.  It should highlight our issues without making suggestions.  Show them an issue with the report, then when it's identified and acknowledged, work on a solution.<br>

Subject:  Skalds, cooper please read.  <br>
  <br>
<br>
Cooper are skalds going to get looked at anytime soon? <br>
Frankly, calling this patch a class balance patch without even feeling the need to reassess, or even take a look at the skald class, is extremely disappointing. <br>
<br>
what is our role? <br>
“support class&quot; is the key here! Skalds have very little support. Taxi service? <br>
<br>
Our class is bad!! most of the changes to other classes have steadily marginalized our abilities (the so-called &quot;passive nerf&quot;). <br>
<br>
1.62 continues this trend as far as I can see. Other classes that have under-performed will get some improvements, which once again downgrades our place in the endgame food chain. <br>
<br>
- Increases to the melee damage of other classes makes skald damage less valuable to benefit a group. <br>
- Increases to the support abilities of other classes highlights the lesser effect of our own. <br>
<br>
Most importantly: <br>
<br>
- Improvements to the defensive ability of all melee classes highlights how low our defence is, while reducing once again our overall damage (i.e. we will not really parry much more than we did, but more of our own blows will fail to reach their target). This last one is the largest downward effect I can see i this patch. <br>
<br>
No longer will I have buffs or end regen, not high enough on the damage ladder. No longer will i really stand a chance vs the enemy...which means even with numbers we'll still prolly be the only mids to die. <br>
<br>
Right now we are a taxi with only 700 range stun/mez, dd and fair/poor melee. 700 range mean 1500(800+ to us) range mez/stun. Eats us up!! And our heal is a joke. If we are supposed to support we need support skills. <br>
<br>

Yes it is because all skalds know what is wrong with us, But now a year has went by with it not being addressed. When is it skalds turn? other than some minor improvements we have not seen much. we have gone from primary tanks to substandard support we need a little looking at Please!!!<br>
