<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Bugs</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Dropped Pulses:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Damage Adder and Speed Song (and Regen song, but hard to see this one) are dropping pulses on a regular basis.  Recently a change went in to possibly correct this issue, but it did not fix it.  It is not uncommon to miss 2 Adders during a single battle.  Speed song drops as well, though it happens more frequently when there are 2 Skalds in a group both running the Speed Chant.  Initially I thought the changes had worked for Wardens and Paladins, but after speaking with them, all the chants are still dropping pulses.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Speed Song/Combat:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
When any member of a Skald's party is attacked, the Speed Song is dropping for every member in the group.  This bug crept in since v1.50 went in, and needs to be addressed.  Prior to v1.50 only the person in active combat had the Speed song drop.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Misfires of Damage Shouts:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
On occasion if you cast a Damage Shout on a mob from the outer fringes or the range (Which is very small BTW) you will see the spell effect, get a message that it has been cast, but the mob takes no damage. Since the range of the Damage shouts are so small, there is no reason why we would be out of range of a resist message. <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Long Term Issues Not Addressed</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Stacking of Damage Adder:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Currently the Skald's Damage Adder value is halved and the stacked Adder is appended to the Skald DA.  This results in a total Damage Add equal to or less than the Skald's Damage Add alone.  The way that the stacking should be handled is that the lower value Damage Adder should be halved and added to the higher value Damage Adder, which will result in an actual benefit of stacking the Damage Adders.  Otherwise, why have stacking available at all?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Damage Adder Radius:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The Damage Adder radius needs to be increased to 1500 minimum to allow a Skald's group to spread out more.  700 Range on a group chant only lends itself to AoE damage/CC. I am stressing this needs to be done, 700 is just too short for a group chant.  It was increased as a fix for the Paladins, but left at 700 for Skalds/Wardens.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Fury of the Gods:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
This unique RA grants us with a 30 second once every 30 minutes Damage Adder at the cost of 14 RSP.  This seriously needs a review.  At the minimum, it should be changed to a 1 minute every 15 minute Damage Adder at a cost of 10 RSP.  Even then, it would be considered an iffy proposition, but at least it could be a justified purchase.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Song of Rest:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
What can I say about a Chant that at level 50 give 12HP back every sitting pulse?  Nothing nice, I assure you.  This chant is the bane of every class that gets it.  Consider a total review of it for the Skald's and the other classes that receive it.  (Bards,Minstrels)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Power/Endurance:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Like other Shout classes, we pay the price for our shouts doubly.  Consider dropping substantially (or remove) the Endurance requirement for the shouts for all shout classes.  What was originally put in as a means of limiting damage is no longer needed due to the changes to the game to limit damage in other ways.<br>
<br>
A review of the Power cost for the shouts is in order.  Why does the Skald (and Minstrel) pay up to 2x the cost or power per damage over any other insta cast in the game?<br>
<br>
Examples are:<br>
Champion DD, 3.87 Damage per PP<br>
Bard DD, 4.07 Damage per PP<br>
Thane DD, 3.08 Damage per PP<br>
Skald/Mistrel DD at 2.07 Damage per PP on one shout, 2.17 Damage per PP on the other one.  <br>
<br>
And then we have to pay a severe endurance penalty as well?<br>
-----------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Requests</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The Skald's are not considered a tank.  They are considered backup melee and support, yet we receive few tools that actually lend itself to support of a group.  In that vein, these are the requests for changes/additions to the Skald class to give them the option of actually supporting their group.  <br>
<br>
Also, please keep in mind, Skald's cannot twist their chants (and don't want to), so any chant playing will be playing alone, unless they are grouped with another Skald.  All of these items do not need to be added/changed, but are presented here as some ideas that can quicken the process.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Rally Chant: </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
This is a proposed new chant to be added to our BS spec. This chant will have the effect of Haste on a Skald's party. This would also not help a solo Skald, but would contribute to a Skald's value in a group.  It would be a lesser value than a Healer's Celerity, but available if a Healer was not.  The same way that a Healer/Runie can fill in with a lesser Speed song when a Skald is not around.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Resist songs:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The current value of the resist songs and the levels they are attained at are not an issue. The fact that they have to be split into 6 different chants is. Combine these into 3 sets of 2 resists at a minimum or preferably 2 sets of 3 as was done for another support melee class. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Damage Shield Chant:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The ability to reflect a little damage back to the attacker. Would be a group friendly spell.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>New Song of Actual Rest:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
An Out of Combat rest chant with more Health regen per pulse than the current Song of Rest, plus Regen of Power and Regen of Endurance. The out of combat version will not effect a solo Skald except in less downtime between battles. <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>RA Changes</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Mastery of the Arcane:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Please remove Mastery of the Arcane from our choices of Realm Abilities. Since Skalds receive no benefit that is known from this spell, it just confuses people.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Dodger:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Please add Dodger to our Realm Ability choices.  This will enable a Skald to make their Evade more effective if they choose to do so.  <br>
------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Fluff</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Sounds:<br>
Can we have some new sounds for the casting of our spells?  The laser beam sounds just are not very fitting.  Throwing in an animation sequence for shouts and chants would be nice as well.  Currently we fire a laser and the effects just appear.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Skald Epic Design</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A redesign of at least the breastplate for the Skald Epic would be nice.  It was a copy from the Minstrel's originally (right down to the chalice on the belt) and it would be nice to have something that was different from them. (Not that we hate Minstrels or anything like that &lt;wink&gt; )<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Commentary</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Skalds are a good class, quickly losing it's way amongst a myriad of changes/additions to the game.  The Skald class is by no means broken, but with the substantial changes going on around them in Midgard and against them in Hibernia/Albion, their duty to their group is becoming less important and needs to be looked at before they fall too far behind the curve.<br>
<br>
The bulk of the Skalds want our bugs fixed, the long term issues addressed (even if the answer is 'not gonna happen'), and our requests at least considered.  I have had numerous conversations with Skalds, and they truly do not want to be an 'uber' class that so many people think they want to be.  I doubt any class in DAoC wants that for themselves, because it takes away the fun from playing this game as much as being too underpowered.<br>
<br>
I ask anyone wishing to find out more about Skalds and their feelings about their class to visit our Team Skald discussion website at <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald">pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> and see the real people playing the class and how they feel.  I think most people would be suprised.<br>

<br>
Ok, so now we know that +bs items ”do” make a difference. Kind of. Unless one is already 50+ in battlesongs. Epic armor one will get when one is 50. Standard 46 bs template and rank 4 (213k) will get a skald there without items does he want it or not.<br>
<br>
At the very least, ask them to turn that +5 bs into +5 parry.<br>
<br>
And while they’re at it, +13 cha instead of +13str on leggings would make more sense too.<br>

<br>
Great work, thanks for representing the interests of the community.<br>
<br>
I don't know how the general Skald community feels but has anyone ever suggested that Skald's be given the ability to use Spear styles?<br>
<br>
How difficult would it be for Mythic to add this style to Skalds repetoire? Considering that we gain no benefit from 1hdr / shield combo, except in base percentage.<br>
<br>
The Addition of the spear style to Skalds would allow for greater flexibility in the class as well as present the realm with another class that can use that particular weapon style.<br>
<br>
Don't know how feasible this would be or how the Skald community would view this. So just putting it out here for future consideration and discussion.<br>

I still like my skald for the most part (its a decent class; some better, some worse).<br>

However, I gotta vent and say I dont think that our bugs and reasonable requests will ever be addressed.<br>

<br>
I consider the skald's role to be more about melee than support, given that this IS Midgard, after all.  And I envision the skald literally bellowing throughout a battle, urging their consorts to greater feats of valor and putting fear in the hearts of the Enemy!<br>
<br>
That said: wouldn't it be great, AND make sense, to give the skald a short-range PBAOE Mezz?  <br>
<br>
The skald throws out a mighty curse about how his companions are gunna tear off the opposing side's limbs, and whammo - they freeze in fear for a good 10 seconds. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
A pipe dream maybe, but to me it is more easy to sell a sensible idea like this one than a damage reflection chant.  <br>

I really like the idea of the ralley chant.  Not very often you come across a healer with a decent celerity so it would be good if we got a chant that would help fix that.  Also like the idea of combining resists.  Really stupid to have 6 of them when you can only play one song at a time and they're only really going to be used when you have a group of 3 or more skalds.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jikkle>Jikkle</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.vgmuseum.com/rips/snes/Boo.gif" BORDER=0> at: 12/12/02 2:23:58 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fenrisfil>fenrisfil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Contributor</span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/11/02 7:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=408.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.fenrisweb.demon.co.uk/DSC00028.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New idea for BS</span><hr size=1> Hey I'm back it seems <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Well I read the report on the info bits forum, but just thought I'd pop in here to comment.<br>
<br>
I'm glad your keeping going on this despite the apparent lack of acknowledgement from Mythic. Especially with a couple of other team leads moving on to the new classes.<br>
<br>
As usual the report was excellent. The only thing I would comment on is about the dmg add stacking problem. I know exactly what the problem is, so I understand it fine,  but I'm not sure your description may make it clear to mythic personal (pressuming they don't already know the problem, and if they do I'm shocked they've not done anything about it).<br>
<br>
I would suggest mentioning the more specific situation where the dmg stacking code works against midgards set up. I.E. When the shaman or runemasters damage add is less then half of the skalds one (which except for max dark spec runemasters this is almost always the case).<br>
<br>
Because Albions single target dmg adds are baseline they will never face this problem (unless some lowbie wiz/the decides to buff a higher level group) and because Wardens always favour the bubble chant to the dmg chant Hibernians don't tend to come across it. This makes this very much a Midgard problem and something I hope is in the runemaster and shaman reports as well as your own (mental note to check that).<br>
<br>
Anyway, I know you want to keep the sections brief, but I think it's worth clarifying the dmg stacking thing a bit (well mentioning that a single target dmg add of less then 1/2 the group chant will reduce overall dmg anyway).<br>
<br>
The rest of the report was perfect. I just wish Mythic would take notice of these problems. They could at least sort out FoG's. They've tweeked other realm skills so it's about time they looked at ours. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=frali>Frali</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/12/02 11:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=408.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Skald Report as posted - Read closely!</span><hr size=1> Overall its a great report. I can't help feeling we are politely asking for very very little with a subservient mentality when as someone pointed out we've had no work since day 1. This is a substantial point in my opinion and one very under used in your report.<br>
<br>
This is not to say we should be whiny or even haughty about asking for the simple things granted to most everyone else. Nor should we refrain from asking for things that make sense such as reduction in timers, radius increases or bug fixes, I just think we can do so without coming off quite so subservient.<br>

That way for the 2 or 3 times per fight the pulse seems to miss I still have a damage add or so I can just keep run speed up the whole time in rvr and get to chasing folks down as they flee. I think the report is excellent, but I dont think our unique realm ability needs tweaking. It should be removed and we should be given something much better. Midgard accross the board got very unimaginative and altogether crappy unique realm abilities. Compare minstrel and skald ra's and you just want to get sick. SOS has many uses for breaking mile gate standoffs, relic taking and other stuff. Our damage add at 7 dps (once its been cut in half) has very little effect on anything. The resist chants being combined would be great the only one I think I have ever run is matter for those darn cabbie dots during keep taking. Also, would be nice to have a job during keep taking as our damage add is completely useless on door and our regen song is well... <p>&quot;May the light of Tyr's glory guide your way.&quot;</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fenrisfil>fenrisfil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Contributor</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/21/02 8:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=408.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.fenrisweb.demon.co.uk/DSC00028.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Skald Report as posted - Read closely!</span><hr size=1> Worst thing with SoS is they got their clearly more useful and effective ability for almost half the cost of our one (theirs is 8rsp to our 14rsp cost).<br>
<br>
I still think they should have given several either/or ability choices to classes that are shared between realms. This would have allowed for personal customisation rather then just defining each class further with a skill only that class had. That would soon sort out the better realm skills and no one could complain about fixing the weaker ones.<br>
<br>
For example: Minstrels, Skalds and Bards would all get to choose to buy *one of* SoS, FoG, and the Bards uber healing chant. Of course that'd mean all Skalds and Bards would have SoS as well as Minstrels, which would make it obvious to Mythic that the other two are just not up to par. They could then nerf SoS and/or boost the others and no one could really complain (providing those with SoS got a RS respec if it got nerfed).<br>
<br>
Once all three are up to par you'd have a lot more individuality per character rather then having all members of each class (well certain classes anyway, and I feel we are one of those) being virtual duplicates.<br>
<br>
As well as the class clone syndrome the current set up makes it hard to fix poor realm abilities because it's seen as loving/nerfing towards specific classes rather then to a broken/gimped ability. At the moment Skalds are still falsely considered overpowered and that will unfortunatly mean we will probably never get the fixes we need. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nattfari>Nattfari</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Participant</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/26/02 1:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=408.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Skald Report as posted - Read closely!</span><hr size=1> Very nice report as usually.

One question though, have you given up on the plus Battlesongs items issue? I am still seeing items dropped, especially lower level ones, that have a +1-2 to BS on them. I remember you saying a while back that you had reams of data and were not able to ascertain whether or not +BS makes any difference in DD damage, effectiveness, etc. Perhaps I missed a post in here somewhere? <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;"><!--EZCODE LIST START--><ul><li><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Orobolis - 50 Skald</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></li><li>Muddy Waters - 35 Berzerker</li><li>WarpField - 33 Spiritmaster</li><li>Pylon - 10 Hunter</li><li>Bitwise Operator - 27 Shaman</li><li>Piralith - 11 Bonedancer</li><li>Schleprock - 5 Savage<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong></li><li>Piralith - 22 Wizard</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></li><li>Phantasmic - 1 Necromancer</li><li>Zedda - 3 Reaver</li><li>Tiramond - 6 Friar<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong></li><li>Warpfield - 25 Enchanter</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></li><li>Piralith - 6 Eldritch</li><li>Pinenut - 10 Valewalker</li></ul><!--EZCODE LIST END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>So many alts, so little time.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=roseannelottsa>Roseanne Lottsa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Skald TL</span><br>  Posts: 291<br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/10/03 4:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=408.topic&index=20>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Skald Report as posted - Read closely!</span><hr size=1> Yeah, I did post it somewhere around here, damned if I can find it again tho.<br>
<br>
What it boils down to is this:<br>
<br>
If you don't go the typical Skald route and bring your songs to 46 (say you left it at 39 and loaded it into Parry instead) you would have a lot of varience in the damage your shouts do.  Now if you load on BS items in this instance, it pretty much flattens the variance (though you obviously don't get the higher songs).<br>
<br>
So in effect BS is working as they intended it to, it's the fact that no one ever specs low in BS to see that it works (diminishing returns at the high level makes it even harder to see)<br>
<br>
So in effect, the BS items are not broken, it is the fact that we have no reason to not spec high in BS that is the problem.<br>
<br>
I hope I explained that right.  I did a bunch of tests with a Skald that was not close to high BS to determine this once and for all.<br>
