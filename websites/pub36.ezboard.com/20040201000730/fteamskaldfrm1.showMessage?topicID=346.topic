<br>
So, I wanted to do the same for the skald class. Why ? Because it appears that one of the main reasons Mythic isn't too worried abour fixing our class bugs and issues is because the general feeling of the players base is that skalds are overpowered, and part of this sentiment come from :<br>
1) the fact that skalds have been, at some point and during a long time, a somewhat overpowered class, even if a lot of modifications to the game since this summer have considerably changed the whole class balance.<br>
2) but especially, because there is a lot of misconceptions about what can skalds really do. <br>
<br>
It's time to explain what can skald really do, instead of what they are rumored to do.<br>
<br>
This is a work in progress, all feedback, additional data (particularly about skald melee issues) and comments are welcome.<br>
<br>
It's also not a whine, or a demonstration that the class is underpowered, a cry for fixes or a cry to nerf other classes. I understand that some classes have worse problems than us. But it's our job to clarify things.<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Common skald Misconceptions, by Dargaard, Hand of Bragi, proud member of &quot;Les Gardiens d'Heimdall&quot;<br>
<br>
-------<br>
Q: Skalds are a viking class. They are the &quot;melee&quot; musician class, and thus shouldn't have as much support power as minstrels and bards. They fight as well as a tank and benefit fully from powerful songs. Skalds are warrior with speed and CC !<br>
-------<br>
<br>
Skalds melee abilities are decent, but nothing stellar, and the fact that skalds can hold their own in direct battles relies heavily on the full use of their &quot;spellcasting&quot; abilities more than their pure meleeing prowess (damage add, shouts, &quot;kiting&quot; tactics). But, however overpowered it is, the fact than a PBAE caster with mastery of concentration can defeat a melee class at melee range (I know, I know ...) doesn't make the caster a melee class with powerfull staff skull-cracking abilities. Comparatively, it's the same problem with skalds. Skald real *melee* performances are often exaggerated because most people on the &quot;receiving end&quot; are victims of the combination of skald melee and skald magic. Skald depend heavily on their chant abilities to fight effectively at melee range.<br>
<br>
The most common belief is that skalds, originating from the viking base class (like warrior, thanes and berzerkers), have a built in, distinct advantage in melee above other classes, and that their melee ability is comparable to that of other tank classes.<br>
<br>
This is wrong, surprisingly enough. Skalds have the same hp table as healers, and I have seen skald &quot;weapon skill&quot; parsed at only 8% above that of an assassin with same specs/level/stats/equipment. Fully shaman-buffed skalds can hardly break 1400ies in weapon skill, while warriors and zerkers can go up to 1700-1800ish in similar circumstances.<br>
<br>
As far as damage and hit points tables are concerned, skalds are closer to a rogue than to a fighter type.<br>
<br>
( - note : Gisborne, as you pointed out the 8% figure, do you have logs still available to add to that ? need more input here. The 1400/1800 figures I found in some threads are somewhat vague too, need more input)<br>
<br>
A typical skald will have between 42 and 46 in weapon skill at level 50. 50 weapon templates do exist, but please note that they are subject to debate, as they leave battlesong at 43 or below, thus sacrificing two extremely important, class defining songs.<br>
<br>
Skald have the ability to use 2 handed weapons (like *every* &quot;fighter hybrid&quot; - champs, paladins, thanes, but as an advantage above &quot;support hybrids&quot; - bards, minstels, wardens). Skalds do hit &quot;hard&quot; but, they use generally slow weapons, and have, because of race and class statistics progression, usually very low quickness (unless the occasional kobold skald).<br>
<br>
Skalds can spec in parry, but the 1.5* points per level means that common skald templates leave parry at 1 to 17, depending on the template. Skalds have Evade I. They can only use small shields, and don't spec in shields.<br>
<br>
Skalds are not used as tanks in PvE at higher levels at all. Even berzerkers and high level shadowblades with dodger are preferred to them.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, while a skald with the help of his songs can do well in battle, at least offensively, the &quot;warrior with speed and mez&quot; caricature is off mark. People, especially bards and minstels, aren't aware of the fact that our damage and hp tables are that low, and are actualy extremely close to theirs.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
Q: But Skalds are a music class and add so much to the group, like bards do !<br>
-------<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, skalds have neither a power regeneration song, nor an endurance regeneration song.<br>
Hit points regeneration song is a joke. The level 50 song (no one spec to that level) can heal 120hp per minute of COMPLETE, SITTING REST. Playing the song in combat will regenerate 40ish points per minute (yes, minute).<br>
This song is marginally useful to reduce solo downtime, but in group situations with a good puller and steady pulls, the group members will rarely be completely out of combat (it takes a lot of time to revert from &quot;combat state&quot; to &quot;rest state&quot;), thus making the song nearly useless.<br>
<br>
Note that bards and minstrels face the same problem. Skald song is NOT THE SAME as the paladin heal chant, which works much, much better.<br>
<br>
The really common song that binds those 3 classes together is the speed song. Besides that, skalds don't offer as much utility. <br>
However, we shall note that skalds, while they have much less songs to perform, don't need to use instruments, which is a nice compensation, and tends to prove Skalds were meant to be more of an hybrid fighter than a &quot;music&quot; support class.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
Q: What about the dreaded damage add song ?<br>
-------<br>
<br>
Apart from speed song, the damage add song is the only really useful group song skalds can maintain. Skald top damage add song is 7dps (elementalist baseline damage add dps is 10). I'd say a bit more than half of the skalds have that level of spec, the others use a weaker song. This damage add is comparable to paladin's and warden's damage add. Note that in RvR situations, wardens and paladins use it only rarely, because they have better alternatives (PBT, endurance ...). This song is a lower priority to them, and hardly considered as class defining.<br>
In RvR situations, the skald has a though choice to make between switching to damage add and keeping speed on. Although speed will be canceled most of the fight, it is often a good idea to keep it up as much as possible. So damage add won't always be up.<br>
Please note than switching songs use up power and endurance.<br>
<br>
But the worst feature of the damage add song is the extremely small group range. A range of 700 is not a problem in PvE, but in RvR, odds is that most of your meleers will not be encompassed in the damage add range (700 range is approximately the range at which you the &quot;Saracen Gryphon Knight&quot; message above the enemy head). <br>
In many, many, many instances, during a typical RvR encounter, the skald will only benefit himself for the song, not his allies. <br>
Remember, it's not often a very good idea for a skald to charge along with other melee classes. On top the inherent risk and the fact the skalds doesn't simply have the defensive skill set needed to charge brashly into battle, the fact that heavy and especially light tanks have earned (rightfully) many useful tools to be able to effectively charge their enemies despite crowd control and offensive spells (charge, cheap IP, cheap purge, determination) makes it increasingly difficult for skalds to &quot;follow&quot; their tank brethren into battle. <br>
Thus, it means that the skald, pushed more and more towards the backlines because of the recent patches, will find it increasingly diffcult to provide his class defining ability, the damage add, to the pure melees of his group.<br>
<br>
Also note that the damage add has been bugged for months, with damage add &quot;pulses&quot; missing randomly, and still not fixed<br>
<br>
------<br>
Q: Skalds can melee extremely well and use their songs in battle. It's basically free damage on top of meleeing.<br>
------<br>
Aye. But note that songs and shouts use up a LOT of endurance, which drastically reduces the number of styles and sprinting time. There's a tradeoff here, too.<br>
It's a problem common to other hybrids.<br>
<br>
------<br>
Q: Skald shouts are overpowered ! Skalds get 2 shouts, and my champion only one. I'd trade my stupid lightning spell for your shouts any day. Skalds shout are better than minstrel's and bard's shout.<br>
------<br>
<br>
Here are some numbers. Please note I am assuming the skald has access to the better damage shout spells. Remember that skalds that try to max their weaponskill won't have access to the best &quot;primary&quot; shout and use considerably weaker version. However, the other classes are facing the same problems, so it evens out.<br>
<br>
Skald :<br>
Primary shout (battle howl) : 114dmg, 55 power, 700 range, 20s recast, body, insta<br>
Secondary shout (battle howl) : 89dmg, 41 power, 700 range, 20s recast, body, insta<br>
<br>
Thane :<br>
Insta lightning (toothgnasher): 114dmg, 37 power, 1500 range, 20s recast, energy, insta<br>
Insta PBAE : 69dmg, 41 power, 200 PBAE range, 20s recast, energy, insta<br>
Castable DD : 151dmg, 31 power, 1500 range, 20s recast, body, 3s casting time<br>
<br>
Champion :<br>
DD shout : 128dmg, 33 power, 1500 range, 15s recast, body, insta<br>
STR/CON debuff :-73 Str/Con, 323 power, 1000 range, 20s recast, body, insta<br>
<br>
Bard :<br>
DD shout : 114dmg, 28 power, 700 range, 10s recast, body, insta<br>
<br>
Minstrel :<br>
Primary shout (cacophony) : 114dmg, 55 power, 700 range, 15s recast, body, insta<br>
Secondary shout (dischordant) : 92dmg, 43 power, 700 range, 15s recast, body, insta<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok, what do these numbers tell us ?<br>
First, that skalds shout are nice, no doubt about it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   However, there are many, many people who falsely assume that skald shouts are something &quot;special&quot;. What those numbers are proving is that skald's insta DD abilities are at best in line, at worse weaker than similar classes abilities.<br>
<br>
Let's compare with minstrels. Well the comparison is quite simple, the shouts are almost the same, the difference is the recast timer 15s for minstrel, 20 secs for skald. Minstrel wins.<br>
<br>
Bards. Skald have an advantage, frontloading. It's a nice advantage, however it's the only one. Bard shout has the same damage, half of the cost and half fo the recast of skald's primary shout. In terms of dps and efficiency, bard wins, hands down.<br>
<br>
Champion. 1500 range vs 700. That's a world of difference. It means champions can interrupt casters from afar. Priceless. Any skald interrupt spell is at 700 range. It's not much, but champion's shout can be used on keep walls, during standoffs ... A bit more damaging, a bit cheaper, 15 s recast ... Technically, skalds have the advantage, but don't forget that the inst con debuff count as a frontloaded &quot;damage&quot; spells (con -&gt; hp lost). Not sure who the winner is here ...<br>
<br>
Thanes. Thane's insta DD is exactly the copy paste of skald primary shout, with 2 major difference, 1500 range (see : champion), and a more favorable resistance type (most enemies prioritize body over energy ...). The insta PBAE shout is a bit worse than our secondary shout, but not THAT much. And there is the Mjollnir, and the castable DD. Another conclusion we can draw is that it is not enough. Those numbers show well enough why our brethren suffer that much in RvR. However, as far as our comparaison in running, Thane wins, but as the DD caster/melee hybrid, not by a high enough margin. But it's not because skalds are overpowered (the comparison with alb/hib shouts prove it), but because thane damaging ability is gimped.<br>
<br>
Another interesting element in those comparisons is that skald (and minstrel's) shouts are vastly overpriced, compared to every other classes. Unfortunately, those prices are paid in both power, and a commensurate expense of endurance. And endurance is king ...<br>
<br>
------<br>
Q: Speed make skalds almost invulnerable in RvR !<br>
------<br>
Using a shout, attacking, beeing attacked in melee or range, be on the receiving end of any offensive spell or ability break speed, and it takes 6+ seconds to kick in again, assuming no one hits you or casts on you during this time.<br>
One of the biggest skald nerfs (all classes with speed are concerned) was to make the speed song break for all people in group when ONE of the group members meets one of the aforementioned conditions (duh).<br>
<br>
Note that some people make the confusion with an ability that allow minstrels to make their groups run at full speed, without suffering for a similar song cancelation, and an immunity to movement impairing/crowd control spells.<br>
This is a realm ability, called &quot;speed of sound&quot;, not an inherent property of the speed song, and only albion ministrels have access to that ability.<br>
<br>
------<br>
Q: But despite its shortcomings, speed is one of the most vital and valuable abilities in RvR. You shouldn't whine, just because you have it.<br>
------<br>
Aye. The speed song is great. Please note that there are a lot of &quot;support&quot; abilities that are vital to a realm : buffs, endurance regen, power regen, ressurections, heals ... Does it means that the classes that have those nice support abilitites should have no fun and useful other abilities and be gimped in all other aspects of their characters ? There is one thing that skalds are fearing above all, slipping slowly but surely into mediocrity to end up as glorified taxis. Hasteners are static npcs. Not skalds.<br>
<br>
------<br>
Q: Skalds can solo in RvR.<br>
------<br>
True, to a certain extent. However you should see an assassin class in action to really speak about &quot;solo&quot; RvR.<br>
The ability to solo as a skald come basically from two reasons : speed and the fact skalds can/could defeat many opponents on 1vs1 with the use of so called &quot;kiting&quot; (DD,DD, mez, DD, DD, snare ...).<br>
Speed is a boon when traveling in the frontiers, no doubt about that.<br>
However, realm abilities, particularly purge and mez, the &quot;spell&quot; patch which introduced spell resistances, love to some hybrids, more crowd control spells overall, and the recent fixes to melee classes have added an impressive array of abilities that can counter easily this tactic. During the 6+ first months or so, the skalds have earned a terrific and fearsome reputation of more or less unbeatable soloists in RvR, but those days are gone. Too bad most of the playerbase doesn't realize it ye.<br>
It's the opinion of many skalds that it is completely OK. But those &quot;nerfs&quot;, direct of indirect, have also significatively impacted skald's effectiveness in groups, and that's what skalds find unacceptable.<br>
<br>
------<br>
Q: But at least, they can run away.<br>
------<br>
I think any class that is well known for its ability to flee from battle at mach 5 should be considered on the &quot;to improve&quot; list <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
------<br>
Q: A melee class with crowd control shouldn't complain !!!<br>
------<br>
Skald mez is wonderful, powerful and class defining ability. I won't deny that. But like always with things related to skalds, many people incorrectly believe that it is more powerful than it really is.<br>
Skald mez is a 700 range shout. 90% of other crowd control spells, root, stun and mez, including AE and insta versions are 1500 range.<br>
Skald maximum mez duration is 29 seconds, minus level difference and resistance (levels 50 who don't have body resistance maxed and close to max are rare ...).<br>
Skald mez has a 30 seconds refresh timer, which is triggered even if the mez is resisted or fails altogether because the opponent has more powerful mez or the 1 min immunity.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
Q : skalds have stun !<br>
-----<br>
Skalds don't have stun. The persistant rumor is caused by the inappropriate name of the first mez spell in the line. But it's definitely a mez, not a shout.<br>
<br>
------<br>
Q: What's this fury of the gods skald specific RA<br>
------<br>
Bwahahahahaha !<br>
<br>
<br>
------<br>
Q: But skalds are kicking my butt in Thidranki ! I have a level 12 skald and he kicks ass, I don't understand what you guys are complaining about. A skald ganked me while I was exping in the Gorge. Skalds are owning people on the Dreds !<br>
------<br>
<br>
Look at the larger picture. With no disrepect to the people playing in the level based battlegrounds, and the PvP servers, and while I wholeheartedly agree that the &quot;skald&quot; experience should be great fun all along a character's life, true class balance should be primarily considered at level 50, with epic armors and high level equipment, and a minimal amount of RA's because it is at this state that everyone will finally end up.<br>
<br>
The difference between 1.5x and 2.0x classes is much less at the lower levels than at the higher levels. The &quot;half-dings&quot; between level 40 and 50 are especially important. <br>
<br>
Besides, some of the skills &quot;mature&quot; early, some much later. The most blatant exemple is the shield spec, which admittedly comes into its own at level 42 with the slam style. Some skills scale up well, some don't.<br>
<br>
RA's make a lot of difference too. How can a thidranki character with 2 realm skill points counter the infamous DD,DD,mez routine ? But on the other hand, take a character with increased resistances, purge (especially with the &quot;cheap&quot; purge for melees), ignore pain ... now, there are plenty of counters.<br>
<br>
Equipement. Contrary to lower level people, level 50s always run (or should run) with maxed body resistance, which reduces mez timer and DD shout damage a lot.<br>
<br>
Basically, skalds peak early in their career, and are extremely effective at battleground levels. It doesn't mean the situation is the same at level 50.<br>
<br>
About skald &quot;ganking&quot; in the gorge : the level difference is the number one factor. You are not dying in the gorge because your opponent is a skald/hunter/whatever, but because you are grey to him.<br>
<br>
RvR dynamics in a full PvP environment, with the possibility to gank every gray possible (which, admittedly, skalds do extremely well, more so than most of the classes), are quite a bit different than the more &quot;high levels only&quot;, more grouped/organized consensual RvR dynamics in the regular servers. There is a lot to say, and I hope 'dred players can add useful comments to this page, but I'll stop talking something I don't know about <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Just wanted to make one point : the fact than a class is excellent on the dred's doesn't necessarily mean it is the same on the classical servers.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
You skalds have no right to complains. You are fine and balanced. We thanes/warriors/hunters/(insert class here) need love, not you.<br>
-----<br>
<br>
Of course ! Some classes have it much worse than skalds. Of course, you need help ! it would be stupid to say warriors and thanes are fine, because they aren't.<br>
Does it mean every valid and legitimate issues have to be shot down ? It's up to mythic to prioritize fixes, it's up to each class TL and community to voice their rightful concerns. Not the same.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
Last but not least : You can say what you want, skalds are overpowered !!!<br>
-----<br>
<br>
Do enemy realms consider us so much of a threat they single us out on a battlefield to kill us or disable us at top priority, like we do for instrument or robe users ? No <br>
<br>
Do entire keep taking raids of hibs and albs give up their siege in disgust because 2 skalds managed to sneak up inside and made the keep unassaultable short of a force thrice as big with GTAE and a throng of assassins ? No <br>
<br>
Can a single skald change the outcome of a 2, 3+ group battle (ala AE &quot;I win&quot; mez button) ? No <br>
<br>
Can a skald with the right mix of spec and RA kill a full group with almost no risk for himself ? No <br>
<br>
/sarcasm off<br>
<br>
What makes a class &quot;overpowered&quot; is mainly a problem of perception. <br>
I have heard thanes and warriors say that skalds are overpowered, because a thane attacked by an infiltrator is dead meat the second assassin's poison lands, while a skald has a very good chance of escaping, with snare, mez, and speed. However, what, exactly here is overpowered ? The fact than a skald can flee from an assassin, or the fact that an assassin can melee down two melee classes ? This is not a &quot;nerf assassin&quot; or assassin bash post, it's just an illustration of the general consensus about the skald class. Because skalds are good at surviving if they play carefully, they are deemed overpowered. IT's certainly great, but overpowered ?<br>
<br>
What is the role of the skald in a siege ? in a keep defense ? Some say skalds are overpowered because they can solo in RvR. Assassins can solo extremely well in RvR. Better than skalds. Skalds add utility and a tactical advantage to their group because of their speed song. But assassins add utility a tactical advantage to their group and because of their scouting and anti-enemy stealther counter measures. Then assassins are extremely useful in keep taking and defenses, removing archers and enemy casters inside, etc ... while a skald is useless in those circumstances.<br>
<br>
The skald truely shine in small group engagements, in 2vs2 or smallish &quot;gank groups&quot;. At these scales, their limited mez and honorable melee can make a difference. However, in large scale engagements, like in a busy &quot;milegate&quot; standoff, it's pretty well known that it's AE crowd control spells (it's even better with range), and AE damage spells.<br>
<br>
Are skalds overpowered ? In a game world where stealth, AE ranged insta mezzes, stuns, 500+ damage nukes, 1000+ damage PBAE's, (pulsating) bladeturns spells that don't need line fo sight do exist, I'd say *no*.<br>

<br>
Skald melee does not actually rely much on the damage add. <br>
<br>
&gt; Skalds have the same hp table as healers<br>
<br>
Skalds seem to be in comparable HP tables with paladins (and thanes?) Healer HP is actualy better than ours.<br>
<br>
&gt; note that songs and shouts use up a LOT of endurance<br>

Songs do not use up alot of endurance. Its just shouts that do.<br>
<br>

Quite correct but should read: ”mez, not a s stun”<br>

Q : skalds have stun !<br>
-----<br>
Skalds don't have stun. The persistant rumor is caused by the inappropriate name of the first mez spell in the line. But it's definitely a mez, not a shout.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Skalds are one of the few melee classes that have no easy access to a medium or long duration stun.  Assassins have it through evade styles AND CD, rangers through evade, LW users a level 50 style positional, hunters positional, friars positional, any shield spec users through shield styles or through block reactionary styles.  We CAN use a block reaction style, but without shield spec and with small shields, that's not something anyone considers appropriate to even try.<br>
<br>
<br>
*as to skalds owning in RvR*<br>
Skalds often beat their opponets because the opponent try in vain to flee.  Those that turn and fight however find that a skald's hit points and defense is woefully less than other tanks.<br>

<br>
Primarily, it's a single opponent like an assassin that you can mez (if he doesn't have purge) and he doesn't get off a poison/stun before you do it. If you get a dot, half the time you're dead anyway and if he stuns you, you can't run anywhere. Any pure tank can be outrun if you get the mez off and a sprint started before they purge long enough for you to get your speed song to kick back in. I've only ever successfully outrun a caster with cc abilities if I was never in danger from them in the first place because I was too far away. <br>
<br>
Even a group can be run from if you have a large enough lead time, but not always. I was in Pennine a few days back and saw a group of hibs. I had probably a good 1000-1500 range distance ahead of them and I hit sprint as well. They had a bard, sprinted as well and got in range for (I assume an instant since running shouldn't have allowed cast time) a mez. I got mezzed, they caught me, stunned me, nuked me to death in 3-4 shots.<br>
<br>
So I'd say that our ability to run away is by no means a defining ability so much as it just means we get lucky in running more often.<br>

We can pick easy kills and stay away from the hard kills and if we risk a hard kill we can run easy.  For the most part I love to gank solo casters and lower cons of any type.  I have killed a pure tank or 2 rare though and I need IP most of the time, champs just do tons of dmg compared to me and if I try to run they can stun me for 9 seconds with a style, bad news lol.  But this is solo... <br>
<br>
We are suppose to be group friendly but the only song groups get any help from is speed!  If you run damage song there is no doubt that 1/2 your group will be out if its range during any combat.  700 range is MUCH to low for a group chant! even though it is the worst dmg add other than the gimpy shammy one in the game.  Only people that dont know what they are talking about ask a skald to play song of rest it does nothing in combat and is a joke out of combat also.  Skalds are in no way a support class unless you put everything on speed, yeah it has 1500 range nice ability and excelent for rvr group and solo alike.<br>
<br>
But I see things getting worse and skalds continue to get labeled as powerful, and a class such as the minstrel who is in every way on par with us getting labeled as gimped.  I have made a new charcter that I will level rather than get mad about it.  Skalds are just avrage damage dealers and I dont find that good enough when I get hit for 400's from tanks and 500+ from casters with stun... it is getting old.  heh I even used IP on an inf only to still have him kill me with 1/2 his life... how sad it is to actually hit once every 5.5 seconds for 300 dmg with dmg add on.  My friend was a 48 zerker thought he would make a skald was tired of getting killed and having no ranged attack... lvled to 50 on his skald went back to his zerker after 2 weeks was tired of not killing! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/urufustb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rufustb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Participant</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#ff0000>(10/21/02 12:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=346.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Skalds</span><hr size=1> It does really bother me that we are considered uber and minstrels gimps.
