 Alas, If only They hadn't added ezboard.com to the list of sites blocked by the firewall at the place I am currently working...<br>
<br>
 However, let it be known that I am in the planning stages of the greatest adventure Norrath has ever seen...<br>
<br>
 It shall be called...<br>
<br>
 Ashborne's Pub Crawl of the Known World<br>
<br>
 <br>
 I have a dream.<br>
 Imagine a posse of Norrath's hardest drinkers. In one play session, they consume one stack of alcohol in every bar in the Known World...<br>
<br>
 This feat will take some planning, as there are bars tucked away where you least expect them (eg: bottom of Runnyeye so I hear), and the faction work to be able to get rat-arsed in the evil cities may be *very* tricky, if not impossible. <br>
<br>
 This grand event is in the research stage at the moment. Stay tuned!<br>

With Ezmeres gone to a new realm to follow the dreams of a highlander named Grymwyll, Grymstout tries to enjoy his retirement in Kaladim's hearty halls.  As old as Grymstout feels for a dwarf, a flame of adventure still kindles his heart.  He looks to his mithril two hander and ponders the possibilities of wielding it again...<br>
<br>
He misses arguing with Sir Rafferty... he misses smiting evil with his sword along with his friend, Jhasmyn...<br>
<br>
He hears  the Menage is no more, but perhaps there are other kinships to discover...<br>
<br>
These thoughts circle Grymstout's head like a nauseating aura of esctasy and nostalgia as the dwarf quaffs another pint from in Irontoe's Eats.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Bah! I muss be drunk!,&quot; the stoutly warrior murmers.<br>

It was a cold night in permafrost. I could hear the rumblings of the dragon that lay deep within. I a deep desire to slay this beast overwhelmed my heart. I was able to overcome my desire to charge in there and single handedly take on this magnificent yet dangerous beast. It was a gruelling wait. I nearly lost all my energy as I blessed each and everyone of those waiting their shot at this dragon. The night grew weary, and yet that calling in my heart would not subside. <br>
<br>
Finally, after much discussion we were allowed to join forces in battle! It was a sight to be seen. Clearly that dragon was no match for us. My sword rung true and fast. Time seemed to stand still as I fought this vile beast. Until finally she collapsed and the words echoed in my mind. You have slain Lady Vox! I felt more experienced from this battle. My glorious deed was rewarded with a book which will lead me to a glorious sword. I think I am ready to take out Nagafen too.<br>
<br>
So... in summary, I went on a Vox raid, I got the killing blow, and the exp, and my pally book!

Moste fortunately for Grymwyll Trawthekeeperr, he dwelled inside the Cornwall station house,which be west o' Caer Witrin, and much southernly o' Camylot's stately streets.<br>
<br>
The Ceannard-mith smirked smoothely, as his lips touched his tankard once more and ale tyckled hys tongue before being swiftly swallowed.  The foam o' the formidable drink filled the young fyghter with its barley'd blyss.<br>
<br>
And although Grymwyll drank alone, he was content and myrthful in his sort o' waye.  He recollected with grete glee and inner laughter o' his fyrst nyght as guildmaster for the Order o' the Auld Code.<br>
<br>
Twas a nyghte that leaderschyp was given'd to him by goodely Sir Voltare, who hath whole-heartedly realized he could no longer leade.  And 'twas the Cu Mor Glas a Bas, he, hymselven who quothe to Grymwyll that he schulde taketh Voltare's offer.<br>
<br>
And so it was te be.  Grymwyll, that nyghte had te decide between his friends Rygore, and Kwinth, or his guild to giveth his blayde and trawthe to, that eventful evening.<br>
<br>
Ye wit, poor Grym had the choice o' stayin' within Albion's borders and ridding the ryalm o' its evils wit' Rygore and Kwinth, or to move with others o' the Order to the frontier-lands where 'twas rumoured that the Norse wouldst run amok... Albion caught in unawares.<br>
<br>
Grymwyll, pondered the matter deeply, and finally tolde hys dear friend, Rygore, that he would leave for the frontier and protect his ryalm, despite his inexperience.  <br>
<br>
Rygore understood ful welle, and bid his friend hapness and luck. And so Grymwyll rode rigorously through the Campcorentin Forest, the Salisbury Plains, and the Hills o' Camylot until he passed through the border keepe o' Sauvage.  Here his was given'd a note o' instruction o' where te meet the rest o' his kin. <br>
<br>
And so he ran fully along the path.... and when the poor lad reached a stretch that was neither here nor there, he was shot unexpectedly by a stealthly archer in the forest.  There he lie, suren'd te meete his maker.  <br>
<br>
But by the wyll o' the almyghty, his kin grew worried for their new, inexperienced leader, and went forth. And soon enough they saw Grymwyll, mortally wounded. There be a friar amongst the party and with her powers so divine, Grymwyll somehow was cured.<br>
<br>
The party lead Grymwyll te a keep nearby, where they were to meet more and more defenders o' Albion, but the Norse ne'er cayme, nor was the sniper found..but that be the fyrst nyghte o' ryalm war-fare Grymwyll be in, and the be also the fyrst nyghte o' his reign as Ceannard-mith.<br>
<br>
A few moon hath passed sithen that nyghte o' misadventure, and Grymwyll grows steadily in poise and experience.<br>

One thing you could always count on from the zerg was the complete heartlessness of the Cerebrates and their overlords. it always ultimately led to their demise. He took a sip of stim tea and grimaced.<br>
&quot;The only thing that makes them dangerous is their damned numbers&quot;, he grumbled to himself,&quot; are there enough of us out here to stop the swarm?&quot;<br>
<br>
A hunk of zerg flesh ,shredded by the shrapnel of a siege tank shell, slapped into the command camera, obstructing his view. he reached for the microphone to call a tech to fix it, but changed his mind, this battle was well in hand, he motioned for Johe to take over and got up with a labored grunt.<br>
&quot;Getting old&quot;, he grumbled, but we don't get to die until all evil is destroyed , right Jaxohn!?&quot; , he slapped the slight man on the shoulder, and glanced again at those strangely pointed ears.<br>
&quot;Right sir!&quot; Johe said with mock excitement.<br>
&quot;I still say you're a slave driver without a soul though.&quot; he added with an evil smirk.<br>
&quot;heh right&quot; Rafferty chuckled,&quot; I'll be in my ready room, call if the Protoss show up.&quot;<br>
<br>
He limped toward the door, a trophy of a battle long forgotten.<br>
It slid open silently and he    couldn't resist the urge to make a creaking noise from his throat. Johe chuckled at the old paladin, as he sent in a wave of Wraiths in for the kill.<br>
&quot;Panfsara, I'm home&quot; Rafferty said whimsically as he walked over to his desk. He sat down with a creak, that he felt more than heard. He opened the drawer,  pulled out a ancient gourd that truly looked out of place in the metallic confines of his ready room. The cork came out with a &quot;ploop&quot; and Rafferty smiled at the sound.<br>
&quot;Thanks Ash&quot; , he chuckled.<br>
he raised the gourd in a salute to the empty room, seeing faces that were not there.<br>
&quot;Ah Dwarven ale!&quot; he sighed,&quot; good to know the little buggers are good for something eh sir Ezmeres?&quot;<br>
He smiled at the reply that never came, and slowly nodded off to a place where Rygore's slap on the back was worse than a beating from a cyclops, where you could never be sure why Hyppi was standing behind the lady Paax, to hide his habit or because of the view, where Dalewin, Happy( the good Doctor), and Wolfie were never too far away to help, where a banana and it's offspring could empty a cave of bears in record time, where the lady Calinish could brighten the spirits of even an undead froglok with an accented &quot;good on ya mate&quot; , where ole Iron Nuts could drop a snow couger with his breath, and where , no matter how lost you got, Pops could find you as long as you stood still.<br>
He woke with a start, but was careful not to spill a drop.<br>
&quot;Sir the Praetor Fenix has started his landing cycle and will be ready to meet in 15 minutes.&quot;<br>
He leaned forward to speak into the intercom.<br>
&quot;I'll be ready in ten&quot; he said but kept his finger on the send button.<br>
&quot;and Johe.... thanks.&quot;<br>
He slowly stood and looked at the ceiling.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well big guy, I took the oath, and I'm glad I did, I'll go anywhere, any time to thwart evil, and with your help, I'll not rest until it's all gone. But as usual I have a few requests,&quot; he smiled a wry smile,&quot; Next time please try to send me somewhere where there is rain. and if at all possible, perhaps you could send me where we will be together again&quot;<br>
<br>
He bent over and hit the button on the intercom.<br>
&quot;Johe, I'm going to be a bit late, cover for me.&quot;<br>
&quot;Sure thing&quot; the intercom croacked, as Rafferty limped to the bathroom to take a shower.<br>
