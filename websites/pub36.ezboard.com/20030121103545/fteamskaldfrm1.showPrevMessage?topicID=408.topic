Enjoy,<br>

Mance<br>
<br>
<br>
I thought I would put down my findings on sword/axe/hammer with the 2h savage in mind. I did this analysis in preparation for my savage. If you are a lightweight and can't read technical writings exceeding a few paragraphs, go to another thread, you will only be frustrated by this. <br>
<br>
First off, throw out the block chains. You won't use them. <br>
<br>
1. Parry chains analysis. Both axe and hammer have a 2 move series with moderate stun on a lvl 4, lvl 8 style with identical bonuses. THe axe chain has a slow, while the hammer chain has a bleed. The axe chain stuns off the 2nd move, and the hammer chain stuns off the first move. They are pretty much a wash. Sword has the parry chain come in much higher at lvl 21, and it is a 3 move chain. The central weakness to it is that the middle move, Rush, has no attack bonus, and this means your odds of landing the last move are low. For this reason sword loses out. Now hammer has an additional parry based style called Lambast <br>
<br>
39 Lambast [MLLM] bleeding where I used the form <br>
<br>
Lvl Stylename [attack defense fatigue damage] side effects. Note Ill use capital letters to denote bonuses, and lower case to denote penalties. <br>
<br>
This is superior than the 2 move chains from axe or hammer. Where it is superior is the fact that it is a single, low fatigue move with a low defensive bonus. This kind of move bootstraps itself...if you land it, then your odds of parrying go up from the low defensive bonus. There are not many midgard styles that do that. <br>
<br>
AXE: 4 Cleave [M-LM] slow -&gt; 8 Thrym's strength [M-MM] stun <br>
<br>
HAMMER: 4 Crushing blow [M-LM] stun -&gt; 8 Slam [M-MM] bleeding <br>
<br>
So for this reason Hammer wins the best parry chain award. <br>
<br>
2. Anytime chains. Here I will pick the best forks of the chains <br>
<br>
AXE: 10 Pillager [L-HM]slow -&gt; Plunderer [M-MM] hinder <br>
<br>
HAMMER: 10 Ruiner [L-MH] -&gt; Crumble [M-MH] <br>
<br>
SWORD: 10 Assalt [M-MM] -&gt; Ice Storm [M-MH] <br>
<br>
Of these 3 chains, sword wins the battle because the opening move is medium hit bonus. Anytime styles matter because they are the default backup when you cue up styles. There are a few other interesting backups <br>
<br>
AXE: 12 Hoarfrost [LMM-] detaunt <br>
HAMMER: 6 Placate [-MM-] detaunt <br>
SWORD: 34 Polar Rift [L-HM] <br>
<br>
OF these, I like the hoarfrost. It has a better chance of landing, and when it does, your defensive bonus goes up and you then have a better chance of landing a parry chain. WOuld I use these instead of the anytime chain in the default cue? Yes for axe, no for hammer, and no for sword. For axe, the high fatigue on pillager will make it a drain, and you might as well use a medium fatigue style which forces things towards a parry. With hammer, the medium fatigue makes the anytime chain good, and sword has that nice medium hit bonus anytime. Of the 3, I think swords wins the anytime battle with its nice chain...I would rather have an anytime land more (medium hit bonus) than to do more damage. <br>
<br>
3. Positionals. All chains have positional styles. The most valuable are frontal, followed by rear, then side. It is easiest to pull off a frontal style, and many times a chase happens where you can do rear styles, but side styles are a pain to land and usually require a stunned/mezzed foe to pull off. Here they are in summary <br>
<br>
AXE <br>
Front: 29 Havoc [LlMH] -&gt; 50 Tyr's Fury [H-MH] bleed <br>
Rear: 15 Evernight [M-LM] bleed -&gt; 44 Artic Rift [M-LH] <br>
Side: 39 Glacial Movement [MlMM] slowed <br>
<br>
HAMMER <br>
Rear: 29 Conquer[-hLH]hinder -&gt; 44 Sledgehammer [H-MH] <br>
Side: 12 Frost Hammer [M-MH] hinder <br>
<br>
SWORD <br>
Rear: 50 Ragnarok [MlMM] slowed <br>
Side: 8 Northern lights[L-MM] slowed-&gt; 15 Aurora [M-MM] hinder <br>
<br>
Commentary: Axe is the clear winner here in my mind. First off that front chain is big. Sure you take a low defensive penalty on Havoc, but its a frontal style, and Tyrs fury is going to punch through and hit hard. The rear chain is also solid, with medium hit bonuses, low endurance cost, and medium high damage. Hammer's rear chain is so so. The conquer style puts a high defensive penalty on you with no hit bonus, but the 2nd move sledghammer is nice. I am not to impressed with Ragnarok, since you are taking a low defensive penalty to achieve medium damage...unless that slowing is uber, it isn't worth it. <br>
<br>
4. Taunt styles- I put this section last. Many people will default taunt styles, particularly provoke in RvR. For a class which lives or dies off of defensive skills such as evade and parry, I think it is unwise to deliberately hamstring yourself by imposing a penalty on these skills by overuse of taunt. Taunt is mainly useful for PvE and getting agg reliably. Here is how they stand <br>
<br>
AXE: 6 Plague [MmML] taunt <br>
HAMMER: 15 Provoke [MmLL} taunt <br>
SWORD: 6 Draw Cut [-mML] taunt <br>
<br>
All three of these impose a medium defense penalty. THis means you parry and evade less. They all have low damage multiples. Endurance usage is best for provoke, and the sword lacks the medium attack bonus the others do. Provoke is the clear winner from its low endurance cost. <br>
<br>
So to summarize on the RvR styles, <br>
<br>
Axe: clear winner in positionals, OK parry chain, average taunt, pretty bad anytimes. <br>
<br>
Hammer: clear winner on parry, ok rear positional, clear winner on taunt, average anytime. <br>
<br>
Sword: Clear winner on anytimes, bad parry, average positional, bad taunt. <br>
<br>
You can probably substitute the havoc chain for the anytime style on axe and do just fine. You will take more damage doing so, but dish out more damage. I would go either hammer or axe depending upon whether you wanted better positionals or better parry. <br>
<br>
There also is a 'how high you will climb the weapon tree' decision. Axe is certainly worthy of a 50 spec, since the Tyr's Fury style is good. But hammer's 50th move is the 3rd part in a block chain, something you will not be doing as a savage. 44 hammer is all you need for styles in the hammer line (gets you the 2nd move in the rear positional chain) <br>
<br>
<br>
ARMOR TYPE CONSIDERATIONS <br>
<br>
Slash is neutral to all albion armor types. It does extra damage to hibernian scale users, and less damage to hibernian reinforced and leather users. So you are only penalized against bards, blademasters, rangers and nightshades. <br>
<br>
Crush is at the extremes for enemy realms. You do extra damage verses: Armsmen, paladins, friars, infiltrators, bards, blademasters, rangers, and nightshades. This is essentially the heavy armored albs and most of the enemy sneaky types. <br>
<br>
You are penalized against clerics, mercenaries, minstrels, scouts, champs, druids, heroes and wardens. <br>
<br>
So in the slash verses hammer armor type, you need to ask yourself: is being neutral to everything the most important, or do I have a real need to do extra damage against particular class types? For instance if you wanted to go after enemy tanks, then probably slash is your best bet. But if you wanted to do MEGA damage to all asns, then hammer is the clear winner, or if there are a ton of Alb armsmen/paladins on your server, then hammer is the winner. <br>
<br>
Resummarizing: <br>
<br>
Axe: strong positionals with favorable armor. <br>
Hammer: nice parry with big bonuses/penalties on armor. <br>

Of course, I don't like to do a lot of thinking, maintaining a lot of push buttons making sure I pressed them at the right time, switching between quickbars a lot, etc. Lambast/Provoke provides me with a simple set of styles to use in nearly every situation. Having those two, a stick macro, my two DD's, compell, mezz, damage add, FA2 and IP on the same bar serves my simple play style quite well. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Orobolis - 50 Skald</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

Just put Slam on a different quickbar and switch over when you land CB. Getting to land 2 reactionaries rather than just 1 is a big difference.<br>

<br>
Why would you not use the block styles...ack nevermind, because you don't use a shield as a savage (duh!).<br>
<br>
However, as a general comment. The Hammer Block Change of Revenge and ...are increadible.  The bonus damage on Revenge alone is nearly 100% for my Hammer Warrior, which I then just sound react to the follow up stun style which also does over 80% additional damage.<br>
<br>
Lambast is a tremendous style (IMHO).  The only problem I run into is that I use Revenge backed up by Provoke exclusively as a warrior to get the stun style in. I certainly COULD go to Lambast backed by Provoke as a Savage, and probably would.  The Lambast style damage is terrific, better than 60% (actually well better), and styled damage on provoke for my warrior at least is at 60% increase (albeit while taking a small defensive hit).  IMHO CB is just too low a bonus and too much of an end hog (even with end regen) as you are swinging so fast as a savage.. <br>
<br>
I absolutely agree btw on not using the hammer style at 50.  It takes way too long on my warrior at this point to chain all three.  The impact is nice, long-dura ASR, but the net effect is just not that impressive. Most fights are too short, and you block too infrequently.  Its nice for PVE soloing-but what are you PVE'ing at 50 too often that you dont have an ASR from a caster OR since you're a savage couldn't ASR with savagery anyway.<br>
<br>
The axe style Havoc is also very much an 'anytime' really.  Sure you cant use it from behind, so you use your positionals, but I'll tell you, in dueling with a 50 axe warrior, Havoc, due to its higher to hit bonuses and high damage (not a ton higher than provoke but still higher), followed by Tyr's Fury, was just one butt-kicker.<br>
<br>
The ONLY reason to go to 50 in hammer is to up your total spec-level as high as you can, which will affect damage slightly, and your chance to hit, some.<br>

One of the main reasons I don't play my zerker that much anymore was because I didn't like managing the two and three style chains. The Lambast/Provoke serves me very well. With that combination, I get the benefit of two styles both having high damage, low endurance cost and medium bonus to hit. All I have to do is, /stick, press my DD's, and then the #2 &amp; 3 keys for my styles, wash rinse repeat. Granted I am not the RvR terror that you or Mance might be, but I think I am still doing some good out there. After all, I still win more against Alb/Hibs that they do against me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;"><!--EZCODE LIST START--><ul><li><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Orobolis - 50 Skald</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></li><li>Muddy Waters - 35 Berzerker</li><li>WarpField - 35 Spiritmaster</li><li>Pylon - 15 Hunter</li><li>Bitwise Operator - 27 Shaman</li><li>Piralith - 20 Bonedancer</li><li>Schleprock - 6 Savage<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong></li><li>Piralith - 22 Wizard</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></li><li>Phantasmic - 1 Necromancer</li><li>Zedda - 3 Reaver</li><li>Tiramond - 6 Friar<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong></li><li>Warpfield - 25 Enchanter</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></li><li>Piralith - 6 Eldritch</li><li>Pinenut - 12 Valewalker</li></ul><!--EZCODE LIST END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>So many alts, so little time.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=429.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=429.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=429.topic&index=7><img src=http://www.stuckathome.com/skalded/images/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=429.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.threadControl?topicID=429.topic><img src=http://www.stuckathome.com/skalded/images/closethread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=429.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=429.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub36.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="teamskaldfrm1">General Discussion<option value="teamskaldfrm6">Bug Forum<option value="teamskaldfrm5">Test Planning<option value="teamskaldfrm4">Logs and Test Results<option value="teamskaldfrm7">Wish List<option value="teamskaldfrm9">Equipment Discussions<option value="teamskaldfrm10">RvR Discussions<option value="teamskaldfrm11">PvE Discussions<option value="teamskaldfrm12">Quest Discussions<option value="teamskaldfrm13">Informational Lists, Etc.<option value="teamskaldfrm8">Moderator Discussions</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald>Team Skald</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1>General Discussion</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br> <!-- #EndEditable -->
