Danarin's Raid Quest<br>
--------------------------<br>
<br>
This is one of 4 or 5 quests which results in a key for entry into the castle area of Acrylia Caverns. It is designed for a group of about 10 Level 40 players. <br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Scout Danarin' <br>
<br>
Scout Danarin says 'Hello, welcome to the front lines of our war against the bastard grimlings. As I'm sure you know, we Vah Shir shun violence, but with this enemy there is no other way. Let me know if you'd like to see some action. <br>
<br>
You say, 'I would like to see some action .' <br>
<br>
Scout Danarin smiles, 'I can escort you to a camp rich with enemies. With my help you can take possession of their camp. They'll try desperately to reclaim their lost territory and, if we're lucky, an officer will show up. You'll want to bring about ten soldiers as powerful as me. When you're all here and ready for battle, give me a marbled Acrylia sphere. <br>
<br>
The sphere can be bought at the merchant in one of the huts in the Val Shir outpost. Handing him the sphere will have him respawn with weapons, and lead you to the camp. He will pause briefly then tell you &quot;my next words mark the start..&quot; <br>
<br>
You Must keep Scout Danarin Alive in order to complete the quest. After the initial attack, you'll need to fight off one or two waves of grimlings before the Grimling Officer will appear. Be warned that the Grimling Officer is stronger than the others and cannot be Stunned, Mesmerized or the like. <br>
<br>
Excellent quest for a group of high 50s, or 10 level 40s.<br>

General's Challenge Quest<br>
--------------------------------<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, General Staginar' <br>
<br>
General Staginar says 'Greetings. Are you here to serve in the war against the Grimling horde? <br>
<br>
You say, 'I will serve in the war' <br>
<br>
General Staginar says 'As you probably know, we've been battling the grunts for nearly a generation now. They have proven to be a challenging opponent. We've inflicted great casualties upon their kind in this war, yet somehow, they seem to grow even more numerous. Barring some miracle, they will become a serious threat to Shar Vahl very soon. One remaining strategy has a chance of bringing us victory, but none have met the requirements for its implementation. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What requirements?' <br>
<br>
General Staginar says 'Our intelligence has provided us with some information about the enemy. They blindly follow a being they refer to as 'the master'. Our high spiritists have sensed a powerful presence from the caverns beyond our mines, but only those who possess a special key can venture there. None who have obtained the key and ventured into the caverns have been seen alive again. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What special key?' <br>
<br>
General Staginar says 'The grimling high commander holds half of a magical acrylia obelisk that will transport the wielder to their master's stronghold. I have slain the high commander who held the other half of the obelisk and I have the knowledge of it's construction. I will only give it to one who has proven to be a powerful soldier, for nothing less would stand a chance against the enemy ruler. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What high commander' <br>
<br>
General Staginar says 'The grimling high commander will only appear if their compound to the north is overrun. There are two encampments near the compound that will need to be invaded as well in order to secure the area. It is a very complex mission and I will only authorize you to lead it if you have demonstrated competence. Serve our people by successfully completing the lesser raids here in the forest. Bring me the Golden Medal of the Shar Vahl as proof of your prowess, or, if you are already at least as powerful as I am, there is another test that will give me confidence in your abilities. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What test' <br>
<br>
General Staginar says 'If you are less experienced than I am, performing this task will gain you nothing. With that in mind, take this box and venture through the mines and into the caverns. Combine in it Gooplart's tooth, Gizgargank's scalp, Grikplag's skull, Gnildaria's eye, Gnerpokkel's heart, Gilgaplank's toes, the husk of the summoned burrower, and the shackles of a Vah Shir captive. Return to me with the Box of the Hero of Shar Vahl and I will send a team of our veterans to escort you into battle. <br>
<br>
You get a Box of the General's Challenge (7 slot container) <br>
<br>
This is the &quot;short circuit&quot; quest, for higher level players who do not wish to complete the series of raids which comprise the Grimling War in Grimling Forest. By retrieving these items from the named Grimlings inside Acrylia you prove your strength in return for continuing to the portion of the quest which takes up in Acrylia Caverns<br>

Husman's Raid Quest<br>
---------------------------<br>
<br>
This is one of 4 or 5 quests which result in a key for entry into the Castle area of Acryllia Caverns. <br>
<br>
Scout Husman asks you for 6 people of about his level. To wipe out a grimling camp nearby. <br>
<br>
Purchase a polished Acrylia Sphere from the nearby shopkeeper to start the quest. <br>
<br>
The scout will march straight out and assault a camp of grimlings. It's your job to keep him alive during the initial camp take and the follow up waves of grimlings. There are about 5 Grimlings in the camp, and the waves consist of 4 or 5 grimlings a piece. <br>
<br>
Eventually a Grimling officer will appear (who is much stronger than the Grimlings). Kill him to receive a medallion from Scout Husman. <br>
<br>
You Must keep Scout Husman alive in order to finish the quest. <br>
<br>
Suggested force is about 6 level 40s or 2 or 3 high level 50s. As a 57 enchanter, the officer proved annoying since he could not be mesmerized.<br>
