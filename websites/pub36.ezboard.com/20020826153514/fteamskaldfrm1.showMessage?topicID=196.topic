I hope we don't. Right now, most people love their Skalds and think they're eminently playable in both PvE and RvR. There are some things a Skald doesn't do well, but, uhm...not many.<br><br>The second we 'get something' from a patch, all the DAoC players who consider their classes inferior to Skalds (that's 98% of them) will consider it a personal insult that Skalds got improvements and they didn't. After some thought, they'll conclude that Smite Clerics have been nerfed hard enough -- now it's SKALDS who are ruining the game for everyone...<br><br>Here's how I imagine things playing out.<br><br>* * *<br><br>T=0: Patch 1.51G is announced. &quot;Because of the recent improvements to classes that are comparable to Skalds, the highest-level Skald damage-add chant has been improved by 10% to maintain class parity.&quot;<br><br>T+5 minutes: Hell breaks loose on the IGN Dev's Round Table. &quot;SKALDS BOOSTED INSTEAD OF MY AUG HEALER? WTF?!?&quot; &quot;SKALDS ARE IMMORTAL DEATH GODS NOW!&quot; and &quot;I JUST DELETED ALL MY CHARACTERS ON EVERY SERVER TO ROLL 64 SKALDS!&quot; are just a few sample topics.<br><br>T+1 day: Patch 1.51H is announced. &quot;In order to balance the 10% increase to the Skald damage-add chant, the Skald insta-mez timer has been increased to 5 minutes.&quot;<br><br>T+1 day, 5 minutes: Chaos continues on the Round Table. Most popular topic: &quot;LONE PENDRAGON SKALD OWNZ GROUP OF EIGHT WITH UBER CHANT -- DIDN'T EVEN MEZ!&quot;<br><br>T+2 days: Patch 1.51I is announced. &quot;The Skald damage-add chant was overpowering because it was 'always on' with no associated cost. Skalds were outperforming pure melees with higher weapon specs. The chant has been changed to a shout which lasts for sixty seconds, and is on a ten-minute timer.&quot;<br><br>T+3 days: Ralph Nader announces that he'll run for President in 2004 on a &quot;Nerf Skalds Plz!&quot; platform.<br><br>T+7 days: Patch 1.51YY is released. Nobody's any happier.<br><br>T+14 days: Patch 1.52D is announced. &quot;It has come to our attention that the new Skald damage-add shout is stackable with the healing chant; this was never intended. To compensate for the ability to regenerate in battle, the Skald snare has been removed. The combination of two insta-cast CC spells is overwhelming to other tanks.&quot;<br><br>T+28 days: Mythic pisses off everyone in the game by accidentally removing the 35% RvR damage bonus for melee attacks only. Before they can restore the bonus, someone posts the fateful topic: &quot;SKALDS BALANCED NOW! THANK YOU, MYTHIC!&quot; The 35% RvR damage bonus is not reinstated for Skalds.<br><br>T+56 days: Patch 1.666D is announced. &quot;To balance the Skald's insta-mez and damage-add shouts, Skalds may now spec no higher than 1/2 in their weapon. This will free up points to spec in multiple weapons, increasing the Skald's flexibility (his strong suit) in battle.&quot;<br><br>T+112 days: When a mysterious bug results in the accidental deletion of the entire Cabalist class from the game, Mythic announces that all existing Skalds will be converted to Cabalists to maintain realm balance.<br><br>T+168 days: Mythic announces that it is rerolling as Verant for tax reasons.<br><br>* * *<br><br>To be fair, I think Mythic does a pretty good job in most cases, but they DO listen to players who demand nerfs. Right now I'm just thankful that we're off the radar.<br><br>EDIT: I'm just talking about requests for substantial, class-empowering improvements. I think Roseanne's TL reports are appropriately understated and excellent. Although I confess that I don't want my shouts to sound like real shouts -- my Skald's not an angry kind of guy. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/udaocobserver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DAoC Observer</A> at: 6/18/02 7:46:57 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/uquiver6.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quiver6</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Participant</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/19/02 1:03:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=196.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.noggy.org/dkbanner%20(1).jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why we shouldn't ask the Devs for class improvements</span><hr size=1> Come on, you know it would be cool if you heard a &quot;HAY&quot; and you target takes damage....   and a &quot;Hurraa&quot;, for the other DD would be kewl as hell.<br><br>Other then that you are right, I love my skald and find hm very blanced...

The powers that be view phrases like, &quot;if balance requires,&quot; or, &quot;if balance allows&quot; as signs that they don't need to pay attention to the suggestions such phrases are attached to. And why should they? They've got dozens of TL reports to read and address, why should they spend time reading requests that we've already said are not required?<br><br>I would propose simply stating our requests without modifying them with conciliatory phraseology. Instead of saying &quot;This is what we want, if balance allows,&quot; say, &quot;This is what we want.&quot; Leave it up to Mythic to determine if it's feasible within the balance structure. We still probably won't get anything, but at least our suggestions won't be immediatley back-burnered. <p><img src="http://users.rcn.com/jmaclear/rilee_sig.gif" height=170 width=408 alt="Rilee MacLear"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/uvahn666.showPublicProfile?language=EN>vahn666</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://rpgvahn.multimania.com/gundam.gif " BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Member</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/19/02 12:13:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=196.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://camelot.rpglore.com/GFILES/UserPic86393_14226.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why we shouldn't ask the Devs for class improvements</span><hr size=1> ok here what im gonna tell (BTW i cahnge my mind not long ago on this):<br><br>Midgard is Midgard,other realm are other realm......Other realm get more regen song yeah thats true............did you try and melee a ministrel or did he just stun-mez and run you?Did you try to melee a bard also,or did he just dies from a heart attack before you got to him?

As far as I can tell, Realm dominance is dependent almost entirely on server population. On my server, Albion has more peeps, but Midgard is unquestionably dominant. So I guess I have a different perspective on that.<br><br>Every realm can compile a list of things that the other realms get and they don't. And every realm can compile a list of its advantages, too. As for Midgard:<br><br>There is no melee hybrid anywhere that can hold a candle to a Skald. If there was, it would be a Thane. Our primary healing class gets very powerful crowd control and a power regen buff in the same line. Our music class doesn't have to switch instruments or wear a big &quot;Kill Me!&quot; lute into combat. Runemasters are incredibly overloaded with utility spells and abilities, they're like Swiss Army Wizards, and I can not imagine why anyone would play an Eldritch if a Runemaster were available. The superiority of Left Axe provides a distinct advantage to all our dual-wielding classes. Just about every Midgard class can wield 2-handers without even speccing in them; in most other realms, 2-handed weapons are limited to fighter-types and even then they require a long-term spec commitment. In particular, no other realm's Assassins can switch between 1-handers and 2-handers as the situation requires. Damn near everyone in Midgard wears chain. And so on, and so on...<br><br>Look, the myth of Realm Gimpedness is just a myth. I'm sorry, but there it is. It's a paranoid fantasy. Nothing else. The only realm that can possibly complain about essential imbalance is Hibernia, and that's because their Assassin and two of their three tanks are very, very weak. But the third is awesome, so there you go.<br><br>There is only one thing that can really 'gimp' a realm, and that's server population imbalance, and nobody has ever suggested a workable solution for THAT problem. So...I guess I DO feel that we should try to be happy with our incredibly fun and useful class, and at least hold the paranoia down to a minimum.<br><br>Just my take on things, though, not trying to start a war. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/uevldor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Evldor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/19/02 3:26:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=196.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why we shouldn't ask the Devs for class improvements</span><hr size=1> I would be happy if they just fixed the missing.<br><br><br>Evldor Shortbus<br>32 Skald<br>Merlin <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/uquiver6.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quiver6</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Participant</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/19/02 9:53:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=196.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.noggy.org/dkbanner%20(1).jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why we shouldn't ask the Devs for class improvements</span><hr size=1> Now I never said Midguard is Gimped, coming from Hib, I know that there is a lot of things that Midgurd has going for it.

Actually most of midgards classes got screwed with realm skills<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=196.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=196.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=196.topic&index=10><img src=http://www.stuckathome.com/skalded/images/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=196.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.threadControl?topicID=196.topic><img src=http://www.stuckathome.com/skalded/images/closethread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=196.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=196.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub36.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="teamskaldfrm1">General Discussion<option value="teamskaldfrm6">Bug Forum - General<option value="teamskaldfrm7">Wish List<option value="teamskaldfrm9">Equipment Discussions<option value="teamskaldfrm10">RvR Discussions<option value="teamskaldfrm11">PvE Discussions<option value="teamskaldfrm12">Quest Discussions<option value="teamskaldfrm3">Miscellaneous Discussions<option value="teamskaldfrm4">Logs and Test Results<option value="teamskaldfrm5">Test Planning<option value="teamskaldfrm8">Moderator Discussions<option value="teamskaldfrm13">Informational Lists, Etc.</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald>Team Skald</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1>General Discussion</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br> <!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr></table><!-- Footer with Goldbar and Copyright Note --><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td background="images/gold.gif"><img src="images/gold.gif" width="69" height="22"></td></tr><tr align="center"><td><br><font color="#FF9900">Thank you friend Elko, for the web site design.
