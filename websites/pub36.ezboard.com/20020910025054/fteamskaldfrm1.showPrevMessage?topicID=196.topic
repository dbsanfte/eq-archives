I heard origionally it stacked, but now can't seem to find info on it (still looking so may edit).<br>
<br>
[THAT EDIT - Seems it doesn't stack, however I haven't seen any info on if it is capped off like the speed songs, so it could well be double speed even with sprint included before the multiplier.]<br>
<br>
However what comes to mind is 1) The skald speed could well be flicking on and off because of various factors (being attacked in any form or having a group member attacked nearby), having two skalds in the group (there is a lag time when you get out of range of another skald I've found before your chant kicks in), 2) The skald didn't have the top speed song, and 3) The Minstrel chant says it doubles speed, so maybe that x2 (pressuming it doesn't stack with the normal speed chant) is applied after sprint so sprint is at double speed too (and not capped by this roof of course too).<br>
<br>
What I do know is you just need to bat an eye over to the Alb Rogue forum (vnb/classes) to see that minstrels consider SoS to be their primary realm skill, and a must get. Very different to our FoG skill that no one wants. The other thing is how they are talking about it's effect for relic carriers.<br>
<br>
Think about it, they get the relic, they could have a group of 8 minstrels, and nothing could stop them for 4 minutes of pure high speed running. You can't catch them because as soon as you fire a dd or anything you will lose your speed, you can't mez/stun/snare them, and by the time a high damage nuker has cast their spell they will be out of range.<br>
<br>
Tad too much really. Fortunatly this all seems to be speculation at the moment because relics haven't moved much recently (since DF was introduced infact), but I can see it becomming a problem. Certainly the combination of that and siege bolt going to alb seems very much to give albion a sway in their favour for RvR.<br>
<br>
Oh yes and <br>
<br>
SoS = 10 rsp<br>
FoG = 14 rsp<br>
<br>
How the frag did mythic come to the conclusion FoG was more powerful then SoS???<br>

I hate it when people list off all the skills a minstrel has and then concludes that they are uber based on that. Yes, minstrels are a powerful class. However, perhaps you should take a moment to think why there are 1/2 as many minstrels as skalds even though there are more albions than mids.<br>

Could it be because Skalds is one of the few good RvR classes in<br>
midgard (skald, runemaster, shadowblade) while in Albion they spread<br>
their number out among (Cleric, Scout, Minstrel, Friar, Armsman,<br>

You can always tell when someone's making a relic play because they start taking your forts. So if Albion's going for a relic, you play it smart and station a team at the Albion mile gate. If the Albs make off with the relic it's a safe bet that they'll burn their SoS to get away from the relic fort, so you just lie in wait at the mile gate and listen for your teammates at the relic keep to tell you what happened. If they burned away and no one could stop them, then the minstrels used SoS and won't have it when you gank them at their mile fort and take back your relic.<br>
<br>
Can't get any simpler. SoS does not make a minstrel god. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/ueregil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eregil</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://users.iol.it/okandrea/Eregil.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/10/02 11:25:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=171.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://users.iol.it/okandrea/ereliz.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Minstrel RA SoS really is nasty</span><hr size=1> Ok let me tell you what I would do:<br>
<br>
1) Burn 2/3 SoS to get out of relic keep<br>
2) If anyone is chasing they will soon slow down as they try casting on you. The moment the Skald casts snare he is slowed for 10seconds, enought time for the group to dissapear.<br>
3) Take a different route home than the usual zone boundry, not too hard.<br>
4) when you are about to aproach the Albion MG let the ones that burned SoS run to the doors and open them, assuming doors need to be opened as most have been broken down already.<br>
5) the others follow and cast SoS when they meet a force at the MG.<br>
6) run to your PK, in total safety.<br>
7) gate over and the game is finished<br>
<br>
p.s. you may not even need to do step 1 as if there were still defenders around either the main relic force killed them or are in their persuit.<br>
<br>
Can't get much simpler than that, but it should not take a skald to tell you all this! <p><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="http://users.iol.it/okandrea/EreNi.gif"></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/ugisborne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>gisborne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/10/02 4:19:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=171.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Minstrel RA SoS really is nasty</span><hr size=1> I agree this can be abused.

<br>
Look out for excess water in the new expansion to show off the new fx, I think mastery of water will become more popular as there may be large amounts of water travel.<br>
<br>
However of note, something most people don't know, if you swim diagonally (so go forward and left/right at the same time) you swim faster then someone swimming straight (your also gonna make it harder for an assasin in the water to backstab you as they'll need to strafe). <br>
<br>
Whatever I probably won't get the skill.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's funny to hear skalds whine about minstrels and minstrels whine about skalds. 2 uber classes whining about the other uber class, lol. &quot;<br>
<br>
Always makes me laugh to see people whining about people &quot;whining&quot;. Especially as the person making the comments about the &quot;whining&quot; usually has no reason to even be on the board, thus making them comming from a more whiney stand point then a genuinely constructive one. But there you go. Neither of those classes are uber. Unless of course you define uber as &quot;works well&quot; in which case you'd probably have everyone in the game playing at Spiritmaster and Shaman capability before your happy. Sheesh.<br>
<br>
Simple lesson for you - Skalds, Minstrels, Bards are all covetous of each others classes, because they all appear at first glance similar, yet end up very different. Each of the classes would love to keep their own strengths and have the other ones strengths too. Now that would be uber, but it isn't going to happen. It's just a natural human thing to feel. A lot of people take up one class thinking they will play more like one of the others.<br>
<br>
And it peeves me off how on a Skald board there are clearly so many non skalds here just to whine. That is sad<br>
<br>
&quot;SoS does not increase run speed more than the top run song does! Please, get the facts straight before you whine about something. &quot;<br>
<br>
Do you have proof of that? I mean have you raced two minstrels one using the top song and the other using the realm ability, and with both sprinting too? Since your calling minstrels uber as well as skalds (and neither are uber, just some whingers claim they are) I'd suspect not. So please learn the difference between a &quot;fact&quot; and an &quot;opinion&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;You can always tell when someone's making a relic play because they start taking your forts.&quot;<br>
<br>
WRONG. Since Darkness Falls you can't tell a relic raid anymore by when they &quot;start taking your forts&quot;, you only know when they've taken at least half of your forts.  Quite regularly a realm will come in and take around 3 forts before heading back to find a df group.<br>
<br>
Okay now a point on minstrels. Minstrels are a flexible and strong class, but they are also complex and hard to play. If you list their abilities off, of course they sound uber, but they easy thing to miss (especially if you've never played one) is they can't use all their abilities at once. If they are stealthed they can't sing, or charm. If they have a pet they can't stealth (pulsing effect), or sing (because the charm is a vocal song itself), until recently they couldn't fight either as they had to use a flute to charm. Finally if they have the drums out for the normal speed song, they can't fight, have a pet or stealth. <br>
<br>
You need to be very sneaky and tactical to use a minstrel well. *That* and that alone is why minstrels are fewer then skalds. As much as I love skalds, it has to be said it is a very straight forward class.<br>
<br>
However the general power of skalds and minstrels is TOTALLY IRRELEVENT, when the only issue that this thread is about is the SoS song. And you only need to read minstrel forums to see that EVERY MINSTREL IN THE GAME wants this ability. So if that is not an uber ability, I do not know what is.<br>
<br>
The speed of it is fairly irrelevent too, the uberness is in the fact it is total mez/stun/snare resistance (okay you can't attack, but you can't be frozen) for your entier group for 30 seconds. Even without the speed that'd be uber, especially as it only costs 10 rsp, the *same* as a simple purge, and 4 points cheaper then the skald realm skill which is a fairly weak dmg add.<br>
<br>
I am wondering if you can even use this after you've been stuned/mezed/rooted to get out of it. That is something that you really shouldn't be able to do (especially stun/mezed) but I suspect you can.<br>
<br>
I actually think they set the price before they added the mez/stun/snare protection. As it stands at the moment I'd start by swapping the cost of SoS and FoG, then improve the damage for FoG and put a limiter like has been suggested to stop multiple SoS abuse. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/ukjeld.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kjeld</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/12/02 9:09:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=171.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Realm abilities</span><hr size=1> IMHO, Realm Abilities shouldn't be part of class balance, and taken into account in that regard. Class should be balanced without needing to spend a single realm ability point, and it shouldn't require you to take so and so realm ability to fix a weak hole in your class. Realm Abilities shoud be &quot;nice to have&quot; abilities, that actively or passively add to your global efficiency without beeing class defining by themselves. <br>
If you add realm abilities that have a non trivial influence on how you play your class in RvR, give it to everyone, which is the case with, for exemple, purge and ignore pain.<br>
<br>
What I hate with RA is that some classes have been given killer, must have abilities and the others junk. If you are weighing whether you are going to take your class specific abiltiy or another one (serenity, purge, mastery of pain, anything), it means Mythic are right on the target. <br>
If you are taking at top priority your &quot;must abosolutely have&quot; class ability (like SoS), it's wrong. If you'll never admit openly you took by lack of information your class ability and discretly respec it, pretending it never happened, it's wrong. Unfortunately, it's the case with Fury of the Gods.<br>
<br>
It has nothing to do with the relative strength of Minstrels and Skalds. <br>

It's something I've been hassling mythic about since RA's came out (not got any response). It seems to me there are three parts of each class, the class itself, spice abilitys (3 were added to the game and then they seem to have been abandoned), and realm abilities and they should all be balananced indervidually as seperate entities. There are too many &quot;make up for weakness&quot; realm abilities (like a lot of the pure tanks ones). <br>
<br>
The worst realm ability for me is the war cry AE taunt one. How can they possibly say that a clearly PvE only ability should be a reward for collecting up points for doing RvR. I thought the whole point of RA's was to reward you in RvR for doing RvR. The they made it very expensive and have expensive pre-reqs. That beats the fast swim one hands down imho (at least you only have to waste 1 pt on it to try it out). A pb ae taunt should have been a warrior (and similar) ability in their basic skills from day one.<br>
<br>
But anyway, that's off the skaldic topic so I'll stop ranting.<br>
<br>
Realm abilities seem to have been rushed in without proper planning, and in such a way that making changes will be difficult (we've already seen people get bonus points by purchasing abilities that then became more expensive, while others have been forced to respec or loose points because what they spent points on became cheaper). In the case of FoG, seeing as no one has it (since respec) that wouldn't be so much of an issue. Younger minstrels would be up in arms if SoS was made more expensive though (as the older ones would have it for the old price), so maybe decreasing costs is better then increasing (at least until you run out of re-specs, which basically means to me they need to do all the RA changes *at once* for minimal complication).  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/ugisborne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>gisborne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/12/02 12:03:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=171.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Realm abilities</span><hr size=1> Unfortunately, they are using realm abilities to balance classes.

I guess I shouldn't come here and whine about skalds whining, since I only play a lvl 40.5 skald. I guess I shouldn't whine about minstrels whining either (<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=30841821&replies=126">vnboards.ign.com/message....eplies=126</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END-->   pages 3+, my name is Esoa_of_Hatred), because I only play a lvl 50 minstrel. Geez. <br>
<br>
As for skalds/minstrels being uber, I was exaggerating. They are, however, much much better than many other classes and clearly in the top 5. All classes, like it or not, should be reasonably equal. That doesn't mean that some won't be better, it means that there won't be the huge gap between classes like skalds/minstrels/clerics and classes like spiritmasters/cabalists/shaman.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think that all 3 realms should get this ability. I think a lot of realm abilities need to be looked at because they are overpriced and underpowered, or the other way around. Albion certainly got much better RA's than the other realms, and SoS is certainly better than the skald RA (cheaper too). It clearly has issues. However, I think it should stay as long as the exploit possibilities are fixed.<br>

WRONG. Since Darkness Falls you can't tell a relic raid anymore by when they &quot;start taking your forts&quot;, you only know when they've taken at least half of your forts. Quite regularly a realm will come in and take around 3 forts before heading back to find a df group.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->No, you're wrong. If they take three forts they're going to DF. If they take five forts you'd better get your ass to the frontier to defend your relics. Nuff said.<br>

Speed = invincibility and everyone knows it. And everyone seems to have this blindness about the possibility of a relic raiding group having, gasp, more than one Minstrel with SoS. Hard to imagine how that will ever happen, granting that only 99% of all Minstrels are likely to buy that ability, isn't it?<br>
<br>
Every 'counter' to SoS I've ever heard of involves the Minstrel having already burned their SoS. Well, that doesn't cut much water if there are two Minstrels involved and they alternate their timers intelligently. Three, and the only way you will kill them is by burning their ISPs to the ground in the middle of a raid.<br>
<br>
And, IMHO, arson is not a viable counter for most players.<br>
<br>
I've heard a lot of Minstrels say, &quot;Well, if SoS were interruptible or counterable, it wouldn't be good for anything!&quot; True enough. That whole RA is flawed beyond repair. Shouldn't ever have existed, can't work in any form.<br>
<br>
Eventually, it will be nerfed so that it WILL be interruptable, or it'll only increase group speed by 50%, or...whatever, and then all the Minstrels who bought it will be rightfully pissed that their primary RA is suddenly useless.<br>
<br>
Incredible lack of foresight, shouldn't ever have made it out of test. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=171.topic&start=21&stop=21>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=171.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=171.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=171.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.stuckathome.com/skalded/images/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=171.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.threadControl?topicID=171.topic><img src=http://www.stuckathome.com/skalded/images/closethread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=171.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=171.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub36.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="teamskaldfrm1">General Discussion<option value="teamskaldfrm6">Bug Forum - General<option value="teamskaldfrm4">Logs and Test Results<option value="teamskaldfrm7">Wish List<option value="teamskaldfrm9">Equipment Discussions<option value="teamskaldfrm10">RvR Discussions<option value="teamskaldfrm11">PvE Discussions<option value="teamskaldfrm12">Quest Discussions<option value="teamskaldfrm13">Informational Lists, Etc.<option value="teamskaldfrm3">Miscellaneous Discussions<option value="teamskaldfrm5">Test Planning<option value="teamskaldfrm8">Moderator Discussions</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald>Team Skald</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1>General Discussion</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br> <!-- #EndEditable -->
