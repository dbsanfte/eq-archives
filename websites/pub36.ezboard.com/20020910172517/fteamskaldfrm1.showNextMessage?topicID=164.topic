<br>
This is the start of a guide containing all we know about the various Realm Abilities. Right now - I don't know a lot, so this probably contains a lot of garbage. The friars have done a lot of testing, so I have used some of their data. Please give me your comments<br>
<br>
Augmented Strength<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability that increases your strength by 6 each level. Cost per level is 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. Level 3 is required for Mastery of Arms.<br>
<br>
Testing<br>
At level 50, a skald should have over 100 strength (unbuffed). Can someone do tests (or does someone already know) on how much an increase of strength by 6 points will add to damage (styled and unstyled damage.)<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
Strength is the damage determining stat for the Skald. At a cost of 1 point, level 1 in Augmented Strength seems like a no-brainer. Further levels depend on how much an increase in damage you will see. Mastery of Arms is reported to be a poor investment, so increasing Augmented Strength to level three is not necessary for that ability.<br>
<br>
Augmented Dexterity<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability that increases your dexterity by 6 each level. Cost per level is 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. Level 2 is required for Mastery of Blocking, Mastery of Parrying, Mastery of Pain. <br>
<br>
Testing<br>
Dexterity does not go up with level for the Skald, so at level 50, a skald should have around 35-50 dexterity (unbuffed).<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
Dexterity affects your chance to block and parry. In general, I would favor adding to my damage, so this one seems a lower priority to me. If you favor increasing your defense, this may be a viable choice to level 2 where you can move to Master of Parrying. Increasing this ability to level 2, will allow Mastery of Pain, though. This allows an offensive increase. I like Mastery of Pain, so am planning to take this to level 2.<br>
<br>
Augmented Constitution<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability that increases your constitution by 6 each level. Cost per level is 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. Level 3 is required for Avoid Pain, Armor of Faith, Second Wind. <br>
<br>
Testing<br>
At level 50, it is reported that you get about 20 points per level of this skill by friars. Skalds?<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
I still prefer increasing damage to added defense.<br>
<br>
Augmented Quickness<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability that increases your quickness by 6 each level. Cost per level is 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. <br>
<br>
Testing<br>
Quickness does not go up with level for the Skald, so at level 50, a skald should have around 35-50 quickness (unbuffed). Can someone do tests (or does someone already know) on how much an increase of quickness by 6 points will reduce the time to swing a weapon, and how the damage is affected?<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
Quickness has an effect on evade ability, and how fast you swing your weapon. My previous readings on this indicate this is not too useful, because the style damage is reduced when your attack speed is increased, resulting in nearly the same damage.<br>
<br>
Augmented Acuity<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability that increases your charisma by 6 each level. Cost per level is 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. Level 2 is required for Serenity, Mastery of the Arcane.<br>
<br>
Testing<br>
From pub36.ezboard.com/fteamsk...D=10.topic We see the total damage (both shouts) increases 29.6 at Acuity level 4.<br>
Can we find out how much more power you get with 6 points in charisma?<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
The above analysis is at or near level 50 (highest level shouts.) The total damage increase is 29.6 every 20 seconds. This might mean about 60 extra damage per fight - say 15 at level 1. This seems pretty good for just one point - maybe not worth two though. I believe you will get a little more power, also. Finally, you need level 2 to get Serenity (tests are needed), and Mastery of the Arcane (useless at this time.)<br>
<br>
Long Wind<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability: Your character can sprint for a longer period of time than normal. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. <br>
<br>
Testing<br>
Friar test show 20 seconds of sprinting with no Long wind. 25 at level 1, 35 at level 2, 54 at long wind 3.<br>
Another person said: I have Longwind II and Tireless II and I can run forever. I think others have said this is not true, though.<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
Don't think I will spend here.<br>
<br>
Tireless<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability: Your character regenerates endurance in combat. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. <br>
<br>
Testing<br>
One person: &quot;I have tireless 2, in combat it regens slightly, I get about 1 extra styled attack than I used to. From absolutely no endurance...13 seconds sitting down gets me a full green bar.&quot;<br>
<br>
Another: &quot;Tireless, even as low as at level 1 is priceless. The amount regenerated is not huge, but the real advantage of the skill is that its allow you to regenerate stamina (albeit at a slow rate) in circumstances when you normally don't regenerate AT ALL, namely fighting and especially running. So when travelling, running all over Briefine and Emain, you slowly refresh your stamina pool, almost reducing to zero (with purity of mind and heals available) the time you have to spend sitting, in an environment when you are vulnerable to stealth attacks and need moving quickly.&quot;<br>
<br>
Another: I ran from huginfel to Yggdra gate at Warrior speed and had only regained half my endurance.. thats close to a 5min run.<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
<br>
Regeneration<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability: Your hit points regenerate faster than normal. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. <br>
<br>
Testing<br>
Reports say it reduces time to regenerate by about 10% per level. Only works while sitting.<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
Since it only works while sitting, not a help in combat. Not worth it.<br>
<br>
Serenity<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability: Your spell points regenerate faster than normal. Requires Augmented Acuity level 2. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. <br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
I need testing. If it works like Regeneration, probably not worth it.<br>
<br>
Toughness<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability: Increases maximum hit points by 3% per level of this ability. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. <br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
Am I right that a Skald at level 50 has about 1000 hit points? If so, this would give you 30 more hit points at level 50. Not really too good I think.<br>
<br>
Mastery of Water<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability: Increases swim speed by 3% per level of this ability. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. <br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
I have seen a friend use it (he bought it when Mythic said they were going to wipe the abilities) to great effect in the BGs where people are crossing the moat. I don?t think it is very useful in real RvR though.<br>
<br>
Avoidance of Magic<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability: Increases resistance to all damage types of magic by 3% per level of this ability. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. <br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
I need some testing here.<br>
<br>
Lifter<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability: 20% additional maximum carrying capacity per level. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. <br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. Maybe if you need to carry ram parts.<br>
<br>
Veil Recovery<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability: Reduces duration of resurrection sickness by 10% per level. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. <br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
This seems pretty worthless. At ten points, you can reduce the duration of rez sickness by 30%, or get purge and reduce it to zero every 30 minutes (with other bonuses.)<br>
<br>
Mastery of Blocking<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability: Increases chance to block by 3% per level. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. Requires: Augmented Dexterity at level 2. <br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
Does not seem to me as good as Mastery of Parrying. You can parry with a one-handed or two-handed weapon, plus you can spec parrying.<br>
<br>
Mastery of Parrying<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability: Increases chance to parry by 3% per level. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. Requires: Augmented Dexterity at level 2. <br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
You can parry with a one-handed or two-handed weapon, plus you can spec parrying. Generally, I do not like defensive abilities, because you are always attacking in a fight, but not always getting hit. I like this better than Mastery of Blocking, but not as much as offensive abilities.<br>
<br>
Mastery of Pain<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability: Increases chance to critical with melee attacks by 5% per level. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. Requires: Augmented Dexterity at level 2. <br>
<br>
Testing<br>
How much does a critical hit add to a styled swing against a yellow in RvR at level 50?<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
As an educated guess, say that critical hits add 40% to your damage for that swing. Then, your overall damage will increase 2% per point in this skill. The first skill point costs 5, because you need Augmented Dexterity at level 2. I am liking this skill to at least level 3.<br>
<br>
Mastery of Arms<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability: Additional 3% per level attack speed with melee weapons. Please note that the minimum allowed combat attack timer is 1.5 seconds - this ability will not allow you to go below this hard cap. It will, however, reduce the attack speed of slower weapons, which do more damage per hit. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. Requires: Augmented Strength at level 3. <br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
I have heard that the damage a weapon does in styles is reduced as you increase the speed, but not the base damage. This results in a small amount of damage increase, but until I hear otherwise, I am not going to invest in this one.<br>
<br>
Mastery of the Arcane<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability: Your buff spells will be 3% more effective per level of this ability. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. Requires: Augmented Acuity at level 2. <br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
This is said to result in a small run speed increase but not affect any other of our buffs. Not worth it.<br>
<br>
First Aid<br>
<br>
Description<br>
<br>
An active ability on a 15 minute timer: Self heal that heals approximately 30% hit points per level gained in the ability. It cannot be used in combat. Please note that this ability will heal a different amount of hit points based on what class your character is. Cost per level is: 3, 6, 10. Required for Ignore Pain.<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
The 15-minute timer is not too bad, but it cannot be used in combat. However, if you mez and drop out of combat, you can use it. This makes it nice for a Skald.  If you solo a lot, a great way to reduce downtime. Somewhat useful when rezzed in RvR. Finally, it is the prerequisite to Ignore Pain, so it gets points to level 2.<br>
<br>
Avoid Pain<br>
<br>
Description<br>
An active abiltity on a 15 minute timer: 60 second boost to physical damage absorption, 10% per level per level of this ability. Cost per level is: 3, 6, 10. Requires: Augmented Constitution at level 3. <br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
<br>
<br>
I need testing on this one.<br>
<br>
Armor of Faith<br>
<br>
Description<br>
An active abiltity on a 15 minute timer: 60 second 150 boost to armor factor. Cost per level is: 3, 6, 10. Requires: Augmented Constitution at level 3. <br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
I have heard this skill is broken and worthless at this time.<br>
<br>
Second Wind<br>
<br>
Description<br>
An active abiltity on a 15 minute timer: Completely restores your character's endurance. Cost is 10. Requires: Augmented Constitution at level 3. <br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
15 minutes is not too bad a timer. Completely restoring endurance could save me many times. Expensive, though, because you need to spend 10 points on Augmented Constitution first. I am thinking about this one.<br>
<br>
Ignore Pain<br>
<br>
Description<br>
An active abiltity on a 30 minute timer: Self heal that heals all your hit points (I guess the web site has been wrong on this), and can be used in combat. Cost: 14. Requires: First Aid at level 2. <br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
This is a nice-looking skill. The 30-minute timer is long and the cost is high, but what a get-out-of-jail card. I am strongly considering this one.<br>
<br>
Rain of Fire, Rain of Ice, Rain of Annihilation<br>
<br>
Description<br>
An active abiltity on a 15 minute timer: Adds a 10% per level heat/cold/spirit damage-add to non-magical attacks. Cost per level is: 3, 6, 10. <br>
<br>
Testing<br>
How long does it last?<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
Need testing.<br>
<br>
The Empty Mind<br>
<br>
Description<br>
An active abiltity on a 30 minute timer: 10% per level boost to all magic resistances for 60 seconds. Cost per level is: 6, 10, 14. <br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
I am not sure about this one. I think 10% boost for 2 minutes an hour is not enough to spend 6 points on.<br>
<br>
Mystic Crystal Lore<br>
<br>
Description<br>
An active abiltity on a 5 minute timer: Self-only boost to power, not usable in combat. Cost per level is: 3, 6, 10. Required for Raging Power.<br>
<br>
Testing<br>
It is reported that the first level adds about 20% to your power. One report says the second level adds 70%.<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
The 5-minute timer is not too bad. Getting your power from 0% to 20% can really cut your downtime. (Power regenerates the slowest when below 50%.) This one looks like a possibility.<br>
<br>
Raging Power<br>
<br>
Description<br>
An active abiltity on a 30 minute timer: Full power heal, usable in combat. Cost is 10. Requires: Mystic Crystal Lore at level 2. <br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
Not sure how important this is for a Skald. Our DD spells are on a timer. Resetting our power to 100% is nice, but won't turn a fight. I don?t think that I will be taking this one.<br>
<br>
Purge<br>
<br>
Description<br>
An active abiltity on a 30 minute timer: Dispel all negative spell effects from your character, such as rez sickness, DOTs, poisons, mesmerization, stun, etc. Cost is 10. <br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
Some don't like it and have not bought it. &quot;Except for a healer there is no use for any other class to use Purge since what is the use of being the only one not mezzed against a whole group? it might be ok for solo rvr but most of us except stealther are doing more group related rvr then head to head, right?&quot;<br>
Others have bought it and like it. <br>
<br>
Others have it and like it. &quot;Many times when our battleline gets pushed through, and we have to retreat, I have been mezzed. As the large wave approaches, I purge and continue running away! If I hadn't had purge, I'd have died 3 times the last time I went RvRing...&quot;<br>
My thoughts: Great get out of jail card. I think this one eventually should get points.<br>
<br>
Fury of the Gods<br>
<br>
Description<br>
An active abiltity on a 30 minute timer: A group damage-add spell that lasts for 30 seconds and stacks on top of other damage-add effects. This ability is percent-based, so its damage goes up with the user's level. Does not stack with Triple Wield or Rain of Fire/Ice/Annihilation. Cost is 14. <br>
<br>
Testing<br>
How much damage does it add?<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
In 30 seconds, you can swing maybe 7 times? If you miss three of those, you and your group might get 4 hits. On those 4 hits, you get an adder, but lose Rain of Fire/Ice/Annihilation bonuses. I don't know how much damage it adds, but at a cost of 14 and a 30-minute timer - unless it adds a bundle - forget this skill.<br>

<br>
The biggest thing I think you are missing on is First Aid. You say this is basically useless because it can not be used during a fight but, you forget something important: skalds can mez.<br>
<br>
What you do is mez you target, drop out of combat, cast first aid and reinitiate combat after 29 seconds are up <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
All seem so incredibly fond of Purge. I am not and I can tell you why:<br>
<br>
Except for a healer there is no use for any other class to use Purge since what is the use of being the only one not mezzed against a whole group? it might be ok for solo rvr but most of us except stealther are doing more group related rvr then head to head, right?<br>
<br>
Well I would be dead in a second if all other group members would still be mezzed or even if we would be three against the rest of the group you would hardly have a chance.<br>
<br>
Group Purge is the coolest Realm Skill ever..only brownie point is that Hib is the only realm to get it..<br>
<br>
I would actually rather go with Determination if we would have that skill..but we Skalds don't..<br>

On the uber dmg add, the not stacking with tripple wield won't effect us off the pvp server (how many blademasters do you usually group with?), and the rain of abilitys, being on similar timers are not a problem either, you just don't use the rain of's at the same time. Probably a good idea to let people your grouping with know you have the ability so they don't use their rains (unless they have the top level I guess) until your chant is used up.<br>
<br>
I'm waiting for info but was thinking of respeccing for the dmg chant when I get to 14 rsp. As it is at the moment will probably just go for purge instead (just been fixed on pen so you don't loose the mez protection timer). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=elerinn>Elerinn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/6/02 10:43:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=162.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Why purge is good</span><hr size=1> Many times when our battleline gets pushed through, and we have to retreat, I have been mezzed.

Well why not let FoG let us continue fighting despite sleep spells. So it'd always act basically like a root. The minstrel can move but not fight, we can fight but not move. Also lower the cost to 10 like the minstrels. I'd still rather have SoS but it'd be a good improvement for FoG, and maybe make it an option for later if not a primary target (like SoS is for minstrels). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/ucalahad.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Calahad</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/9/02 3:10:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=162.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FoG idea</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Something not reflected here is that Ignore Pain will be changed back to a full in-combat heal, but it'll const 14 points and have no prereq's.

Tireless, even as low as at level 1 is priceless. The amount regenerated is not huge, but the real advantage of the skill is that its allow you to regenerate stamina (albeit at a slow rate) in circumstances when you normally don't regenerate AT ALL, namely fighting and especially running. So when travelling, running all over Briefine and Emain, you slowly refresh your stamina pool, almost reducing to zero (with purity of mind and heals available) the time you have to spend sitting, in an environment when you are vulnerable to stealth attacks and need moving wuickly.<br>
<br>
Not parsed Serenity or anything, but at level 1, my &quot;gut feeling&quot; is that it helps quite a bit reducing downtime. The extra amount of time between the time I am at full health and the time I am at full power after a PvE fight seems reduced. Not tested scientifically, so take with a grain of salt, but I like it.<br>
