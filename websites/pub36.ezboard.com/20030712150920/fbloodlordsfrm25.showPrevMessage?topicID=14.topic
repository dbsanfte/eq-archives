Be forewarned, it's pretty damn long, but gets real good<br>
<br>
IC<br>
<br>
Maladwen pondered the matters at hand. He had a lead as to who/ where the leader of the dragoons who crashed his wedding was. He had recently kidnapped, tortured, and interrogated one of the knights involved. They were a major now. The man had given far more information than he had intended to. Maladwen ended up learning that the lead dragoon's name was Arkaniom S'Rhenvoux, a now colonel of the Neriak garrison. This was just the evidence he needed. <br>
<br>
He ran over to the king's royal chambers and bowed respectfully. &quot;M'lord, I have evidence that a neriak citizen murdered an entire band of Feir'Dal civilians. I would like your permission to invade Neriak, to justify this assault on our civilians.&quot; The king and the council all discussed this matter and the king replied to him. <br>
<br>
&quot;Now general, I know what happened to you hurt you, very much. But we can't start a war with Neriak over it. I forbid the invasion.&quot; Maladwen left the council with great haste, anger seeping over him. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Back in Maladwen's Quarters- <br>
<br>
Maladwen planned how he could exploit the colonel into one of his plans. Finally an idea came to the young elf. He called in his best assasins. In mere moments, Rynehart, Dreadin, Wufang, and Tonker all came to his office. <br>
<br>
&quot;My, loyal soldiers,&quot; he told them, specifically eyeing Rynehart. &quot;We have a problem. Therefore you are to take this message to Colonel S'Rhenvoux in Neriak. I know you can do it.&quot; He hands Tonker, the small gnome wizard, a piece of rolled up parchment. They bow respectfully and leave the office. <br>
<br>
Naturally, rynehart opens the letter and reads it. It read: <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Colonel, your game is up. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Rynehart scratched his head as a second notice came out. It was an assignment, they were to sabotage the garrison...child's play. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Deep in the foul, dark corrupted city of Neriak, the assasins were all exactly where they should be. Wufang, the paladin, quickly charged through the city gate, and towards the commons of Neriak. All the guards quickly charged him, tailing him closely. He took a rear turn when he reached the Indigo Brotherhood. Suddenly he had half the Neriak Guard on him. Quickly Wufang ran back towards Nektulos Forest, where he would dash towards the Commons where no Teir'Dal was allowed to harm a Human citizen. As he raced again past the gate, Rynehart, Dreadin, and Tonker moved toward the targeted garrison, who was ordered to remain to guard the city. <br>
<br>
Rynehart had the hardest job. Quickly, he moved past the wretchid Foreign Quarter. He then snuck past the few guards left in the commons into the Third GAte, the most heavily defended fortification other than High Keep in Antonica. Rynehart knew that this would give him the rep he's always wanted. He set the small tinkered dynamite down on the wall near the two guards, then climbed the gate and proceeded to the station. There, just near the water was the target, this was going to be easy. Gently and hesitantly, he placed another converted firework on the door. He pulled out some flint and steel and quickly lit. He pinned the letter to the nearest wall and ran back to the gate, not caring if he was noticed. He ran through the gate and lit the other explosive, it would happen soon. He felt the guards attacking him as he ran towards Tonker and Dreadin. <br>
<br>
The Gnome saw Rynehart coming with many guards behind him. Suddenly two loud explosions were heard as Rynehart continued to run, sweat now pouring down his face. He made it to Tonker barely as Dreadin, the master thrower, continued to toss shurikens and such at the guards. Tonker began conjuring his spell. Crackling was heard, and Rynehart collapsed. They looked around and realized they were in North Karana. <br>
<br>
&quot;Tonker you old dog!&quot; Rynehart said happily. He looked around and saw Dreadin writing the letter to Maladwen. <br>
&quot;The colonel will be on him soon, we must warn him,&quot; Dreadin replied. He finished and gave it to Tonker to give to Maladwen. <br>
<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
After returning from a long, and successful hunt in Nagafen's Lair, Colonel S'Rhenvoux saw it necessary to return and check up on his garrison. The night had been long and joyful for him, crushing Solosek and Greater Kobolds and sending them back to their makers. He had made well over five-hundred platinum that night, and intended to put it to good use, perhaps some better armor... <br>
<br>
He politely bowed before the guard at the rock, just near the entrance to the charred Lavastorm Mountains. The cool wind picked up and he quickly tugged on his coat to keep him warm. His beautiful swords hung loose on his sides clattering as he walked, his plated uniform shimmering in the little light there was in such a dark place. He walked calmly to what is known as The Newbie Log, and sat down, counting his coins and loot from the night. He could hear cracking and small tiny footsteps from just behind him. At the blink of an eye he spun, his sword drawn and quickly through the back of the pathetic beast known as a Fire Beetle. He lifted it on his blade and stared into the eyes of the dying creature, it seemed as though it was begging for its life, fear pulsating through its body. The dark figure brought it closer to his face and looked at the thing's squinting eyes. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hmm, a few more silver it seems,&quot; he said quietly to the creature. He used his gloved hand and popped out one of the eyes. It glowed in his hand as he placed it gently in his pouch. The thing by now had stopped its horrendous squealing, obviously realizing it should save its strength. Finally, the evil man let it drop off his blade on the ground, where it lie on its back dead. <br>
<br>
&quot;Disgusting creatures they are,&quot; he said again before nonchalantly walking in the general direction of Neriak. He had Maiden's Fancy on his mind, and wondered if Dragoon X'Lottl's daughter was at work tonight...or that ugh of an ogre Spice. He shrugged off the thought and repsectfully bowed before the two guards on duty. At this time it was Sergeant T'Vo and Dragoon J'lexer. He handed them some gold coin for their services and went into the city, the people seemed distraught, very strange for such a grand city. <br>
<br>
Arkaniom continued, his purpose was known. The people seemed to have been mourning losses, as if the colonel had time, or the feelings, to care. Through the Foreign Quarter he continued. An ogre cut him off, just as he was nearing the entrance to the Commons of Neriak. <br>
<br>
&quot;Wudz yooz likes to buy mez itemz? No shinier dingz outzides Oduz!&quot; the ogre said trying to make a deal with the already tired colonel. He looked at the fat varment and growled. <br>
<br>
&quot;If I wanted to buy something, I would've asked,&quot; he grabbed him by the throat. &quot;Wouldn't I have?&quot; Quickly, to save his own throat, he nodded and apologized. <br>
<br>
&quot;Mez sorry zir, won't happen again, mez promise!&quot; the ogre ran back to his little shop where he remained the rest of the night. The colonel was pleased at how he handled such a meddling ogre. Thus he continued. He approached the Commons, and unlike before, many guards stood watch out just past the Priest of Discord. Arkaniom avoided the missionaries preachings and continued forth to examine why these guards were here. It was louder than usual, that much was certain. Not even his footsteps were heard as he rounded down the corner just past the water. He went forth and asked one of the many guards on look out a question. <br>
<br>
&quot;Why the commotion this night lieutenant?&quot; he asked. The lieutenant (obviously newly promoted from how he moved and his excitement) bowed respectfull, stood, saluted and spoke, <br>
<br>
&quot;M'lord, four men broke into Neriak this eve. One of which was a Paladin that barely escaped to the Eastern Commonlands, therefore we could not chase him without threat of war. The others seemed to be rogues, they came here with explosives, obviously tinkered from a gnome. They sabotaged your garrison, and the entrance to the Third Gate.&quot; The colonel was shocked. The garrisons of Neriak usually had better defenses than this. He could feel his anger coming over him like flames through brush. He ran quickly to the Third Gate to confirm this rumor. No guards attempted to stop him, as he must see what has happened. Concern came over his face, and great worry. Worry for his men, worry for himself, worry for anyone else who could've been cought in a blast such as this. <br>
<br>
He reached the Third Gate of Neriak, as he called, The Militaristc Side of Teir'Dal. He saw the steaming remains of the grand gate set there to keep out invaders, and any bothersome outsiders that tried to enter this half. Two charred corpses lay next to each other, both in crisped guard armor. The colonel's face turned red with rage as he continued, and ran to his garrison. Sure enough, not far from the Lodge of the Dead, near the water, his entire station of troops was burnt to the ground. Nothing remained but ash, and some pieces of skeletons that would most definantley be donated to the Lodge of the Dead. Selonia Punox personally came to try to comfort him. She spoke to him telling him it wasn't his fault. <br>
<br>
&quot;Blasted woman! Did I say it was my fault?! NO!&quot; he noticed the note pinned to the wall and questioningly walked over to it and took it. He read over it, but couldn't figure out what it meant. <br>
<br>
&quot;Who is..Maladwen?&quot; he asked Selonia. She thought for a moment. <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh yes, he is the general of the garrison of Kelethin,&quot; she replied, obviously not knowing who he was other than a general. <br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; Arkaniom said. &quot;No, he's also something else, the name sounds ever so familiar...&quot; he drifted off in memory. Suddenly, he remembered! Maladwen was the name of the man who's fiancee they murdered so long ago, simply because he bought land from Queen Christhonex, that the Indigo Brotherhood didn't agree with. He knew now he had to do what he should've done very long ago. <br>
<br>
&quot;Selonia, get my crew together, we ride again, with a new target,&quot; he said, marching back to his private quarters. His helmet stayed at his side the entire night, he had nightmares of Maladwen, and the possibilities. But soon, soon, he'd have his revenge on him for murdering innocent Teir'Dal. Soon... <br>
<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
A wall of flames emerged orm the grass in North Karana. Fear and confusion passed through the dragoon's mind, almost instantly. He was soon surrounded by a ring of fire. Naturally, the heat was nearly unbearable. Sweat began running down his face, fear filled his heart. He reached down for his sword, and found nothing. He looked around for his weapon, then looked down. He realized he was in his long underwear. He still looked around, wondering why this was happening. <br>
<br>
&quot;S'Rhenvoux!&quot; a voice cried out. It boomed across the land, and continuesly echoed. The voice seemed somewhat familiar. &quot;S'Rhenvoux you know why you're here!&quot; it spoke again. He stepped back, his legs shaking with surprise. <br>
<br>
&quot;don't act like you don't know what this is about! Your sins are going to pay you back colonel!&quot; He gasped as an Elven figure emerged from the fire wall. It came out wearing a royal wedding uniform. His long red cape and eivil grin made him all the more eerie. The Feir'Dal drew his Elven Etched Sword, the elecate design prooved he was a general. The uniform was not in nearly good condition however. It had blood, dirt, and grass stains all over it. S'Rhenvoux took yet another glance at the sword, and realized there was blood all over the steel, with a long piece of flesh hanging from the tip. <br>
<br>
&quot;Innoruuk tells me his is excited to meet you S'Rhenvoux,&quot; the Elf said. The Teir'Dal colonel was beginning to panic. <br>
<br>
&quot;W-Who are you? What makes you think you can attack a dragoon, no, a colonel of Neriak and expect to live more than 60 years?&quot; Arkaniom responded to the dark figures. <br>
<br>
&quot;How did you expect to murder my fiancee and live more than 100?&quot; it replied. He lifted his face, to show that of a younger Elf, around 264. His grin so incredibley evil it could cause fear in anyone. &quot;You brought this upon yourself colonel!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Who are you elf?&quot; the dragoon demanded. The anonymous Elf smirked. &quot;Why, it's me, Maladwen, General Shadowlurker. 31st season Blood Lord, Leader of an Army, Fiancee to a murdered woman. And now, I shall have my revenge Colonel Arkaniom S'Rhenvoux!&quot; with this last comment, he lifted his sword and lunged at Arkaniom, and swiftly drawing another. The off-guard dragoon dodged the attack, and kicked Maladwen in the shin, tripping him. It was at this time that Arkaniom found his sword sticking out of the ground, as though a cross. He grabbed it and began parrying the rogue's attacks. <br>
<br>
After an eternity of combat, Maladwen slashed downward at the head of his foe. He barely managed to parry this one, and there the blades stood on each other, like a wheel stuck in the stubborn mud. Maladwen moved his face closer to Arkaniom's. Sweat poured from both their faces to the excessive heat emerging from the walls. Maladwen spoke to him. <br>
<br>
&quot;Arkaniom,&quot; he said. S'Rhenvoux got closer to him. &quot;What do you want you fiend?&quot; At that same instant, Maladwen's face transformed into that of a hidious man's with a long nose, chin, and an evil grin. He suddenly grew to an enormous size, it turned out to be Innoruuk himself. <br>
<br>
&quot;You're damned colonel!&quot; he let out a hidious laughter that no man, not even the worst, should have to hear. He used his gravity fluxing spell and sent him high into the air. Finally, he flew back down towards the ground. He tried hard to scream but couldn't. He hit the ground.... <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Arkaniom awoke after hitting his floor. He was sweating like a mule. He looked around, to see his slave staring at him. <br>
<br>
&quot;What? Have you never seen a man with a bad dream before?&quot; he asked the slave girl, who quickly ran out the door in fear of her master. He walked over to the windowsill and looked outside, still sweating. He quickly began cursing all across Neriak in their common tongue. <br>
<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
The colonel's most trusted soldier, Velil, bursted into the room. He looked confused, and worried. <br>
<br>
&quot;Mi'lord,&quot; he said. S'Rhenvoux held his hand up, silencing him. He looked down breathing heavily, still afraid of that dream. It constantly played back in his head, constantly every minute or so. He finally turned around to see his young apprentice, concern filling his eyes. <br>
<br>
&quot;Velil, round up the group, we ride again,&quot; the dragoon said. The young man nearly rejoiced with excitement. <br>
<br>
&quot;Very good sir,&quot; he said. He bowed respectfully and made his way out of the room quickly. He walked down the hall of S'Rhenvou'x Private Mansion. All the whle he is thinking of how they will punish this man, Shadowlurker. <br>
<br>
He tipped his helm to the guards just outside the front door, and left through the gate. He ran quickly to Dragoon X'Lott's home and knocked loudly on the door. A...ruckus could be heard from inside, something Velil had no interest in, but had to get the message to him. He knocked on the door, his frustration was very apparent. He knocked for the third time. From behind the door he heard a voice. <br>
<br>
&quot;What in blood hell?&quot; The door opened, and there stood X'Lottl, wearing only a towel. He growled at Velil. <br>
<br>
&quot;What do you want Velil? Can you not see that I am VERY busy?&quot; he said as a younger female Teir'Dal came from behind and wrapped her arms around him, massaging his chest. <br>
<br>
&quot;A thousand apologies sir, but you have an urgent message from S'Rhenvoux,&quot; Velil said, trying to ignore the naked woman behind X'Lottl, just trying to be gentleman like. The famous dragoon raised an eyebrow at Velil, questioningly. Hesitantly, the young guard drew a letter from hsi pouch, and handed it to X'Lottl. He read over it quickly and an evil grin grew over his face. He said to Velil, &quot;Well, it seems we're getting back together, thank you Velil.&quot; With that he turned and slammed the door on him. Only four more dragoons to contact. <br>
<br>
Velil's next stop was the Western Commonland. He ran through Eastern with no problems. He paid his toll to Valon, and continued towards the inn. He walked and heard many yells for help, so he drew his jagged Berserker Sword, just to be ready. He then saw an Elf come running from the inn covered in blood, and shivering, obviously sick. <br>
<br>
Right behind him came a Teir'Dal, wearing skeletal-looking plate armor. He wielded a large halberd. he grabbed the Elf by the back of the neck and whispered. <br>
<br>
&quot;Now don't you EVER Expect mercy from a true Neriak Dragoon!&quot; With this he kicked the man onto his back and rammed his weapon down into his stomach, causing a disturbing bubbling noise. With one last breath, the Elf died. <br>
<br>
&quot;Puny Elf,&quot; he said in Teir'Dal. The Dark Elf turned and wiped the dripping blood from his armor. <br>
<br>
&quot;What was that all about mi'lord?&quot; Velil asked. The dragoon nodded. &quot;He came near me and threatened me. So I slit his throat with my dirk,&quot; he looks down at a wound in ihs arm. &quot;The bastard put up a willful fight though.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Dragoon Zytl, I should've known where I find death I find you. How are you my old friend?&quot; Velil was excited to be talking with one of the more active dragoons. He drew his note from his pouch and handed it to Zytl. He quickly read over it. <br>
<br>
&quot;This is an official order?&quot; he asked, somewhat confused. <br>
<br>
&quot;Aye it is sir, the entire group is getting back together to finish off Shadowlurker,&quot; Velil responded. This seemed to have cought Zytl's attention. <br>
<br>
&quot;Lord Shadowlurker? Of the Legions of Bristlebane? Master of the many lands in Karana?&quot; Zytl said. <br>
<br>
&quot;He has accomplished much since his little fiasco in the Foreign Quarter,&quot; Velil said. Zytl let out a sigh. <br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you old friend, we will ride again soon,&quot; Zytl said and bowed respectfully. He twirled his halberd and proceeded towards Neriak to see his old friend Arkaniom S'Rhenvoux. <br>
<br>
<br>
Velil's last destination was the Danak Shipyards in Overthere. There was a great many dragoons residing there, still under Arkaniom's command. The note was given to the general, which requested J'Vai and V'Lor. The general quickly complied. Velil then remembered there was one more man S'rhenvoux specifically stated that he wanted. Therefore one of the many helpful wizards in the area teleported him to Nektulos Forest. The setting was familiar of course. He looked around, Nektulos seemed strangely cold, and the wind seemd ever more frequen. <br>
<br>
Velil proceeded towards Neriak, and his stop was Foreign Quarter. He passed down the first slope in the caverns known as Neriak. He then continued past the two guards on duty and opened the door to the meeting place of the Inner Dreadguard. There stood the man he needed, the one who would make this all a reality. A loyal member of the The Dead, and brilliant strategist, he could not be matched by anyone within the Teir'Dal army, or in Neriak at least. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hail Divn L'Crit,&quot; the young apprentice said. The soldier turned around and saluted. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hail Velil X'Lanoth,&quot; L'Crit said in return. They saluted and Velil drew the letter from his pouch. He handed it to Divn. He read over it quickly, his eyes scanning the words through his uniformed helm. His heavy breathing seemed very loud through the compact helmet. <br>
<br>
&quot;So, S'Rhenvoux pisses off a general and expects me to save his hide?&quot; Divn said in response to the letter. Velil was shocked. <br>
<br>
&quot;Mi'lord L'Crit, that is not it at all! You were there when we destroyed his wedding!&quot; Velil could not believe his ears. Divn was one of the greatest fanatics of revenge and supporters against Kelethin. Velil awaited Divn's response impatiently. <br>
<br>
&quot;One man's foolishness will not be another's demise, I refuse the offer,&quot; he said. Velil was less than pleased, but still saluted respectfully and left. He returned to S'Rhenvoux's mansion. Velil found him in the slave quarters, training with his Elven and Ogre slaves. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ehem,&quot; Velil attempted to get Arkaniom's attention. He turned, sweating from rigourus training. <br>
<br>
&quot;Your report corporal,&quot; S'Rhenvoux said to him, wiping the sweat from his face. Velil bowed and spoke. <br>
<br>
&quot;Mi'lord, all the dragoons are pleased to serve you.&quot; S'Rhenvoux smiled. &quot;Excellent!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;However,&quot; Velil started. S'Rhenvoux hated howevers. Velil continued: <br>
<br>
&quot;However, Sir L'Crit refuses to assist you on your attack. Nothing will sway him he says.&quot; S'Rhenvoux was now steaming mad. <br>
<br>
&quot;The fool will pay,&quot; he said, and with that, he approached the door, opened it, walked out, and slammed it behind him, knocking a large jar of water off the shelf. <br>
<br>

S'Rhenvoux approached Divn L'Crit's quarters quickly, his rage is very apparent. The fact that someone DARED to refuse him was almost too much to handle. Though only a colonel, Divn was more of a guard, couldn't even truly call himself a dragoon! It was of no matter, arkaniom was a fool to think L'Crit was still a man. Death will come swiftly to that, that boy. <br>
<br>
He reached the hut with L'Crit in it and kicked the door open. With a loud CRASH the door opened, broke, and fell to the floor. Quickly, all the guards on the inside drew their swords and stood ready. They were surprised to see it was infact Colonel S'Rhenvoux. They bowed to him then got back into a fighting stance. L'Crit knew exactly what this was about. <br>
<br>
&quot;Sheath your swords men, no need for you to get involved in this,&quot; he said. They all glared at S'Rhenvoux, desiring to jump him, but knew it was a bad idea. Divn stepped forward to confront S'Rhenvoux. <br>
<br>
&quot;So, you DARE defy me L'Crit?&quot; Arkaniom said to the fearless guard. Arkaniom had more fear than L'Crit did, knowing he could be bested very easily. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes I dare defy you! You intend to get the entire group of the BEST dragoons killed becuase you're having nightmares?&quot; <br>
<br>
L'Crit was in no mood to tolerate someone of the likes of the colonel. He was impatient, rude, and self serving. He eyed his sword sheathed and hanging from the wall. If he attempted he had only seconds before the battle would begin. <br>
<br>
S'Rhenvoux noticed Divn's attention to the steel sword hanging from the wall. He drew his own Enchanted Teir'Dal Long Sword and watched for Divn's move. In the blink of an eye he ran and unsheathed the sword. It was at this moment all the guards from inside the building charged the colonel. <br>
<br>
Battle cries yelled in Teir'Dal and cursings toward S'Rhenvoux were heard. He lifted his sword and met another. He looked to see it was a lowly 20th season member of The Dead, an easy opponent to do away with. He tripped him and rammed the edge of his sword through his chest, the sound of torn flesh and cracked ribs could be heard, a most disturbing sound. He then turned and met his sword with a staff made of fine steel. <br>
<br>
&quot;Someone, help me! Treason!&quot; S'Rhenvoux yelled. <br>
<br>
Many guards from outside came into the small hut and began to join the fray. It was hard to tell who was on what side. They fought with ferociousness not commonly seen against a brother Teir'Dal of honor. <br>
<br>
Divn fought off a plenty amount of guards before turning his attention to see S'Rhenvoux slay yet another guard. He charged him, full force, his hate swelling from inside. He tackled the colonel, taking him to the ground with a mighty shove. The armor made a skidding sound across the ground as they made it outside the hut. Divn raised his fine steel sword and waited for the relentless Dark Elf to attack. And attack he did. <br>
<br>
He swung with strength not commonly seen in Teir'Dal. Divn tried to block with his own sword, but it merely fell out of his hand due to the force. He retreated slightly as the evil S'Rhenvoux approached slowly, intimidatingly. One of L'Crit's loyal guards threw him a shield and bronze sword. Not the best selection, but it'll do. <br>
<br>
L'Crit twirled his long sword and ran at Arkaniom, who was ready to take the attack. He swung, but met merely his sword. He bashed him in the helmet with his round shield, then back handed him. S'Rhenvoux returned this with slit to the man's arm. L'Crit let out a loud yell, as many guards surrounded the two of them, cheering on one or the other. <br>
<br>
S'Rhenvoux tosses his sword from one hand to the other and spoke, &quot;Oh I'm going to enjoy ripping your heart from your chest Divn.&quot; With that he lunged at his foe, aiming for the chest. Divn dropped his sword and grabbed Arkaniom's arm. With a grin that could even be seen through his helmet, he snapped his arm backward, dislocating it. <br>
<br>
&quot;Curse you! You! You foul bastard!&quot; unable to stop himself from cursing he looked down at his arm, seeing the tendons ripping as the bone stuck nearly out of his uniformed dragoon armor. &quot;I will pay you back for this Divn!!!&quot; S'Rhenvoux could not keep his rage intact. His sword dropped to the ground, his conciouseness spinning out of control. Divn fell on his back, coughing blood out of his helm. <br>
<br>
Suddenly a loud humming was heard, and blue lights emitted. Arkaniom felt his health restoring as his arm nearly completely healed. He felt it again, the energy restoring him greatly. Curses were heard among the watching Teir'Dal and they turned to see a cleric of innoruuk. Without even a second thought, they all jumped and slew the man for interfering with a duel. They looked back to see S'Rhenvoux gripping Divn's throat. He ripped his helm off. The medium aged Teir'Dal merely spit in the enraged colonel's face, then kneed him in the stomach, not doing much good except moving him into a vulnerable position. He then smashed him in the face with the butt of his sword. <br>
<br>
&quot;So you think you can take my life do you Divn?&quot; S'Rhenvoux muttered. He was holding his now nearly broken jaw after that blow. Divn lunged grabbing him in a head lock. Now he was ready to deliver the killing blow. Suddenly, without warning, Arkaniom drew a concealed dagger from his boot and jabbed Divn in the stomach. Again, and again, and again, until the man let go, coughing blood as it oozed out and dripped down his lips. He squinted and swallowed, falling back on the ground. He rolled over and stood on his knee, fear filling his heart. He knew he was going to die, but how he went was the question. He lookd at Arkaniom and tried to focus. He finally conjured up a spell and shot it at him. The colonel stood shivering. He vomitted lightly, his stomach cramped from disease. <br>
<br>
L'Crit saw the apparent weakness in his foe's eyes and moved in quickly. He casted another spell, the loud hum was heard all throughout the city. He pointed at S'Rhenvoux as he felt poison seep into him. His joints began freezing as extreme pain was brought into his limbs. He tried to attack L'Crit but simply couldn't. L'Crit used this time to conjure yet another spell. This one sucked the life from the suffering colonel, giving it to L'Crit. <br>
<br>
&quot;Fool, you dare attack a member of The Dead and Inner Dreadguard? You are a fool Arkaniom, you have always been a fool, now you will die a fool!&quot; Divn let out a hideous laughter as he began one more spell. Green skulls emitted around him, then moved towards S'Rhenvoux. He felt fear deep in his heart. He ran off down the streets of the Foreign Quarter, not looking back, just running. Divn walked slowly after him, laughing evilly at his opponent. As he rounded a corner, he felt a punch to his right jaw from a form of metal. He flew on his back and looked up to see S'Rhenvoux standing in front of him. <br>
<br>
With an evil grin on his face, Arkaniom looked down. He drew his dirk given to him upon promotion to dragoon and raised high above the shadow knight. &quot;Now my old friend,&quot; he said. &quot;you will die.&quot; With a loud desperate yell from Divn, the dirk was brought down on Divn's throat. A blood bubble emitted in his mouth. With one last breath, he closed his eyes, and died. Arkaniom wiped the blood from his gauntlets and silvered breastplate. He looked at the crowd, who was in utter shock. <br>
<br>
&quot;Let your death be a warning to all who dare oppose the Neriak Dragoons,&quot; he said, trying to think of something original. He collapsed in exhaustion as he heard much applause from the crowd. Velil was the first to attempt to help him up, then soon everyone else helped him rise to his feet. They escorted him back to his mansion in the Commons of Neriak. <br>
<br>
Velil bowed respectfully before his lord and spoke, &quot;M'lord we are still lacking one dragoon for this party, your advice m'lord?&quot; S'Rhenvoux looked at him. &quot;Go grab V'Tai from the bridge,&quot; he said. &quot;He'll do nicely, the fool.&quot; With that, Velil clicked his heels and left, searching for Dragoon V'Tai. <br>
