I've been trying to think of what I would like to do as a skald and came up with at least a role, even if not a perfect way to accomplish it.<br>
<br>
Currently, I see a lot of complaints about tanks running off and killing and not defending their casters/healers. This is a common problem, but if the tanks don't run off and kill, then the enemies come to us, surround us and kill us anyway. So, what if skalds were turned into the protect class? Basically, give us an enhanced guard/intercept that doesn't increase our own defense (block/parry) but allows us to defend another better. If our damage add range was increased to 1500 and our dd ranges increased (though not necessary for this role), we could stay back, stick/af/whatever the healer/caster, guard and intercept for them and protect them from incoming attacks. Not necessarily the most exciting role and perhaps it does lend more to the support idea, but I think it'd make us a lot more useful than the essential taxi to a fight and then either die very quickly or not do anything at all.<br>
<br>
Just a thought.. feel free to flame, support or come up with a more interesting solution.<br>

Not that we have tons of points to spread around on it but I'd like the option personally and a medium shield would be nice too : )<br>
<br>
As for me I do my best to defend healers but without guard all we really are is an annoyance to a full tank like an armsman. Currently I ussually hunt casters and or annoy the hell out of them to buy time for the rest of the group. As a skald though I'm beginning to feel like less of a useful class and more of taxi.<br>

<br>
If we try the run to the back of the enemy party and kill the casters I usaly end up being the main target for nukes but I may get one or two befor I die.  <br>
<br>
The funny thing is the other day I was eating at the comp so I afed my healer when they started a fight I just keep af on my healer and half the tanks that came after him must of used auto target and go me instead of him lol<br>
<br>
One other thing is try to good old look like a shaman or healer trick.  If you are hammer spec use your 1h and small shield.  If you are lucky they will target you and not your healer so the rest of the group can live while to do your duty as a skald and die for the rest of the group. <p>Icebane<br>

Dont get me wrong I love my kobbie but once the taxiing is done I feel like a leech in RvR. I get owned by just about everyone it seems nowadays, the final straw being a 1 on 1 vs a fire wiz. <br>
<br>
We cross paths in emain and I spot him first, I stick on him swing and dd, he faces me and starts to cast so I dd again, he tries again and I mez, it's resisted, now i'm rooted for 1min+. As he starts to make distance I snare him but he's made enough range and in comes the first bolt, I start to close and the 2nd arrives taking me to a sliver of health and crawl speed, I hit FA2 (no IP yet) and might as well not have bothered because the next nuke toasts me. <br>
<br>
I cant remember if I got 2 or 3 swings in but I was using a 99% arcanium great axe, landed both dd's and never got him past 50%. If I cant kill casters just what use do I have? <br>
<br>
As for big battles, I now normally stand at the back and pick off players with &gt; 40% damage because thats the only ones I have a chance of killing. A pretty sad state of affairs imo. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nattfari>Nattfari</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Participant</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/28/02 6:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=413.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Skald's role</span><hr size=1> I look at my skald as a melee class with support skills rather than a support class with melee skills.  I almost exclusively run with guild groups in RvR which means we know our jobs pretty well and usually do pretty good in RvR.  My primary job is to kill casters and bards/minstrels.<br>
<br>
I would love to see more attention paid to our melee side rather than the support one which is usually done.  A shield spec would be nice, it would make 1h/shield a viable option, and also more spec points so that our defenses could be raised somewhat.  Regarding the shield spec, scouts get it (a rogue class) but skalds don't (a viking class).  Doesnt make sense in my book really <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
We are most often compared to bards and minstrels.  Bards are naturalist class (compairable to Midgard's seer class) and minstrels are a rogue class.  Skalds are a viking class and as such should rather be compaired to paladins and wardens.  I know that wardens are a naturalist class like the bard, but they are more melee oriented and as such closer to the skald.<br>
<br>
Im not saying I want my skald to become a pure tank with support skills.  But we are of the melee class in Midgard, and I would like to have the melee skills to show for that.<br>
<br>
As to when trying to peel tanks off my casters or healers, I try to snare the tank and tell the caster or healer to run.  Usually it works so that the tank is slowed enough for his intended victim to land a stun or nuke him.  A guard/intercept option would not be viable in my opinion without a shield spec.<br>

Supposely cause of the 'chanting' thing. What kills me is that out of all those classes only the paladin gets to spec in shield and they get 2x lvl skill points while all others in that line ie. wardens and skalds are only 1.5x lvl in skill points. Realistically I think minstrels are our equal in alb but Mythic doesn't like to compare them cause then they would have to explain stealth castable mezzes and a pet while no other class in that line gets anything like that.<br>
It's just insulting to have spent so much time lvl'ing up in the 'melee' realm only to be owned by your equilvalent class of the 'middle of the road' realm at melee.<br>

I don't know, I don't care anymore. I have stopped bothered, tired of beeing killed by casters in melee range (on my server, Hibernia dominates so much I think it is not even funny anymore even for them). I am not RvR ing anymore (I have won what ? maybe 2000 rps in the last month). It is that bad. The classes are poorly balanced, the realms are poorly balanced, and the promised game mechanics to help the &quot;underdog&quot; realms on server that are outrageously dominated by one realm have still not put in place. There is a limit to human beings's masochists, and when I have no fun anymore playing a flawed (in my opinion) class in an &quot;ever-losing environment&quot;, it's time to say &quot;stop&quot;. And I don't want to level to 50 with another character again, and anyway I am not a bandwagon jumper who switches to the realm/class of the month.<br>
<br>
I am having fun with my champion alt in thidranki, who *can* actually fight things, and looking forward for some nice PvE discoveries in Shrouded Isles, while waiting for AC2 (/rude MS billing system) and SWG. My RvR experience as a skald is finished. And it was not a positive one. Maybe the class was not for me, or I was not fit for the class, I don't know. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=digitalbathe>Digital Bathe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Participant</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/30/02 5:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=413.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Skald's Role</span><hr size=1> I've always seen a Skald as a &quot;better&quot; version of the Ministral and Bard i.e. we don't have to use instruments to make our songs better.  I also think of us as a half-tank because we can deal some decent damage (in PvE apparently) and solo yellows as far as I know so far...level 23.  Once I started RvR in BG1 I started to despise being a Skald.  You can't do crap. You can't kill casters or melees, u try running after someone when they r snared and they outrun u (please God tell me what the fuck is up with that), and never able to run away from battle since usually you never have stamina after a fight.  One way Mythic or whatever could make Skalds better is by not allowing some of their GOD DAMN songs (chants) to be interupted in combat. If i was a Skald and I was hit i wouldnt stop chanting my barbaric words, I would keep on chanting them. While a Ministral or a Bard would be screwed cuz it is...song meaning getting hit could screw their train of thought.  Anotehr thing Mythic can do is make the DD ran further out, 700 is total bullshit. Even soloing lvl 23 stuff i hate having to wait so god damn long to do DDs on them after snare pulling them.<br>
<br>
Another Question, Whatever happened to Midgard? I remember when I first got the game everyone hated Midgard because they were to strong...Now Midgard is the weakest, lease played Realm of all the servers. WTF is up with that shit is not equal at all.  On the server I play on Albions terrorize our realm along with BG1 in MASS numbers.  Hibs r not far behind with a few less in the fountier but more in bg1.  Mythic needs to rethink this entire &quot;equality&quot; in the Realms.<br>
<br>
O how I cant wait for Shadowbane to come out...full PvP with dynamic fortresses and such.<br>
<br>
Yeah overall why would anyone play as a Skald other then the speed song, damage song, and heal song. Overall I might just quit cuz now that I know what RvR has I hate it and nothing to look forward to.<br>

I remember the time I killed an orange con caster and an orange con ranger, solo. The time I killed a yellow wizard solo 2x in a row after I got rooted both times. I remember the time I killed a yellow con champ in 2 hits + 2DDs. I remember racking up 15k RPs in 3-4 hours, 2 days in a row thanks in part to my speed. I remember killing that 50 warden with only my DD shouts, never landing a hit once while he used FA1 and I used nothing.<br>
<br>
For everyone that kills in RvR, someone dies. You can't go running around expecting to always be on the winning end. Some days are good, some days are bad. The only reason I'm frustrated with RvR at the moment is because I can't get a hold of the jewelry I need to make my SC gear. <br>
<br>
I personally think Midgard is as strong or stronger than Hibernia. On Percival (my server) Midgard own 5/6 relics. We owned 6/6 for a couple weeks, and have had 5/6 for a month.<br>
<br>
I can't believe some of you expect to be able to beat paladins...they don't have speed. They don't have insta mez. They don't have snare. Those are highly useful RvR tools. Paladins SHOULD destroy us. <br>

<br>
I dont  know how your server is but on mine if you see any kind of hib caster you better run.  <br>
 quick cast stun nuke nuke = dead skald<br>
<br>
if you see any tank with a shield run <br>
  swing swing shield stun swing = dead skald<br>
<br>
if you get hit by a stealth run <br>
  you are lucky to hit them onec with evade 5 <br>
<br>
Now dont get me wrong there is still plenty of times you win in RvR but the days of runing around solo and geting any kills is gone while every other class in the game has got improvements the skalds have been left behind.  In a big battle your only job is to take some hits while your casters kill everyone.  <br>
<br>
A couple ways to fix this is shield spec, more spec points, and some range on our DD's<br>
<br>
If myth dosent give us something soon im parking my TAXI in the garage and leveling a Bonedancer.  I dont play a skald to get everyone to the fight and then sit around and watch everyone else take part in the killing and that is what skalds are comeing to.  <p>Icebane<br>

<br>
If you get quick cast stunned your doing it all wrong.<br>
<br>
1-  You NEVER melee a caster face to face or you deserved to get rooted and stunned and blasted away.<br>
<br>
2.  You ALWAYS stay out of their front arc.<br>
<br>
3.  If your idea of rvring with a skald is /stick and watching rp's come in...you shoulda been a zerker.<br>
<br>
Skald is a casters worst nightmare if played properly.<br>
<br>
Oh and...<br>
<br>
4.  Never style your first hit, it's just BT anyhow.<br>
<br>
5.  Lil trick -  come in behind break BT, 2 dd's, stun...  evernight... he /faces ... you step THROUGH HIS frontal arc because your NOT a rookie any longer... and you arctic rift.  1,000 rp's and the caster didn't even see you... (diff styles i'm sure for sword/hammer)<br>
<br>
Please please don't /stick and complain, your not a main tank, you have tools that need to be used, and tactics to accompany them. <p>&lt;center&gt;<br>

I learned this little trick recently after noticing that's what all the infiltrators were doing to me!  I relish the opportunity of meeting casters 1 on 1 in the frontier now.<br>
<br>
Skald speed is almost as good as stealth if you know the routes with good tree/brush cover and can swivel the camera to keep an eye on your target as they run down the path.  I love bursting out of the trees at a caster, 2 DD's, 1 mez, then evernight/artic rift and they're either dead or will be in one more hit.  By the time the data packets catch up to them from the lag, you've already chopped them to pieces. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kjeld>Kjeld</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Fervent</span><br>  Posts: 172<br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/4/02 4:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=413.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hmm</span><hr size=1> I personally think Midgard is as strong or stronger than Hibernia. On Percival (my server) Midgard own 5/6 relics. We owned 6/6 for a couple weeks, and have had 5/6 for a month.<br>
-----<br>
<br>
This sum up the complaints I have about DAOC. You are happy and have fun because you are in one of the rare servers when midgard actually has the upper hand.<br>
<br>
End game is RvR. When you are in a server where you are thoroughly dominated, out manned, out gunned, and zerged to death, end game is not fun. If only the &quot;one hib dead for one mid dead&quot; ratio was true, I could have fun.<br>
<br>
When the game is not fun, it's time to move on.<br>
<br>
As for the skald class :<br>
The ones having fun with it seem to be the gank group veterans, who have lived in emain and the gorge for the past 6 months, who have dependable groups, buckets of RPs and know every tree in the golf course. To this kind of single, &quot;elite&quot; group, the skald is a great asset, one of the most powerful class in the game.<br>
<br>
80% of the skalds lack either the time, the dedication to be part of those elite gank squads regular, or simply, like me, don't simply like a RvR that consists of small group vs. small group engagments. Of course this a great way to play the game, it requires a degree of skill that I admire and envy, and in some nice battle, the adrenaline rush is worth everything. However, what I bought DAOC for was not the guerilla warfare in the gorge, however fun it maybe for a skilled skald, but I envisioned a game with large scale battles, armies, epic sieges. I can bet many of the &quot;elite&quot; skalds on the boards despise and dislike the &quot;zerg&quot;, and to an extent I do agree with them, because this part of the game is not fun the way it is.<br>
However, I still want(ed) to be a part of this kind of RvR'ing. I wanted to experience large scale engagments. I dreamed about colorful keep assault.<br>
I am one of those &quot;looking for group&quot; skalds in the large zerg forces, that don't have a permanent of semi permanent &quot;gank squad&quot; like the one that earns the big realm points on my servers. I see nothing wrong with me lagging in power  behind those skalds (though I really would like some token RPs for the dozens of hours spent attacking or defending keeps ...).<br>
However, for the skald class ... this is really day and night. The skald shine as much in small group engagments as it flatly suck in large scale battles and keep sieging/defense.<br>
After a thorough reflexion, I think I have chosen the wrong class, for my playstyle, goals, and habits. Which is pretty ironic, because I originally thought skalds, as a &quot;support&quot; class, would only grow better the more people with them in their group of raid.<br>
I sincerely wish I had chosen a caster with some degree of AE damage dealing ability, or a shaman, or assassin, or something that could matter when behind the walls of a keep.<br>
<br>
This is just what I wanted to say about the skald class. With the feedback and experience of 1 year of playing, it is pretty obvious some classes are better suited for certain playstyle, and at the time (2 weeks after release) I chose my class, I did pick wrong. This is not the fault of the class itself, only mine, though I wonder how, with my limited experience and knowledge of the game, I would have known better at this time.<br>
<br>
However, there still one thing the skald community or rosey should strive for. <br>
Make the class useful (not overpowerful. Simply useful) in the various aspects of RvR, for both &quot;new&quot; and &quot;experienced&quot; skalds alike. Never like the class sink completely into this pigeonhole. The one trick pony. The fact that the skald shines as a part of the elite small group battles shouldn't mask the fact that, for the newer skald, or for the skald that want to take part in a more large scale battle- and keep-oriented RvR, life can suck, badly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dane@teamskald>Dane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Fervent</span><br>  Posts: 101<br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/5/02 3:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=413.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Role</span><hr size=1> PvE: Obvious.  Damage add, runspeed, support damage, light tank (red and below is tolerable, even purps fully geared at 50...but mana spongy), great puller, good peeler with mezz. <br>
<br>
RvR:<br>
Premeir caster killer.  As someone mentioned, it's pretty easy, you just get &quot;out of view&quot; to them when they cast...even with /face if you time it right, you can kill them without getting hit in many cases.  You can also mezz one caster, and do the dancing with another...2 caster neutralized basically in seconds.  Hell, while you're killing the mezzd one, snare some archer and screw up his bow shot, and prep him for the chasedown that will follow....<br>
<br>
Assassin killer: When assassins pop, bang on them with DDs and 2H from behind or side.  They cant evade, and they take insane damage from 2H, especially you hammer skalds.  You can hang with them if they turn to fight.  Doing this to, say, a polermsman, would be less successfull...or worse, a paladin :/<br>
And if they are hitting your healer or a mage...just mezz peel.  Your healer or mage is instantly free to cast.  Ever try to kill an enemey before they kill RM or SM pal?  Yeah, mezz makes you one of the better peelers in midgard.<br>
<br>
Only counter to SOS and other runspeed classes.  That bard getting away?  Who's gonna stop him?  YOU!  Chase him down and teach him a lesson.  Minstrel SOS?  Tail him..wait..............snare and kill.  He blew SOS and still gave you RPs...always nice.  With endurance regen it's even easier to chasedown.  Good at killing bards...OK at killing minstrels.<br>
<br>
Archer killer.  Snare as you approach...then commence killing as per usual.  Have you ever been killed by an archer when you weren't preoccupied with someone else?  I haven't that I can recall...<br>
<br>
So you don't excel at taking out tank hybrids and tanks, but you do just fine vs everyone else.  You have no equal vs mages, that alone is a nice benefit to a group.  Sure, the occassional MOC can screw you up, but your IP screws with them just as readily.<br>
<br>
We DO need stackable and dual resist chants IMO, currently, the are next to useless.<br>
<br>
<br>
In ANY large scale battle, you are also the premeir sweeper.  You are the leader in the chasedowns, those easiest of easy RPs that you get on 10 fleeing enemies.<br>
<br>
In any standoff, where say the enemy is assembled near your keep, but starts to move off to a non-defended one.....speed/sprint up to them, snare a mage at 1500, B-line back to your keep.  They aren't going to leave that snared mage behind ususally...they only half trickle off....do it again....get your skald buddy next to you to do the same...at some point you can be soley responsible for halting an organzined tactical enemy retreat, and for spreading their force out as your force comes in for the kill.<br>
<br>
That's just a few off the top of my head.<br>

<br>
I like to think I kinda go &quot;berzerk&quot; in the big fights.  I dd everyone and their mother, snare, mez everyone I can.  I run around smacken tanks and casters.<br>
<br>
When I get /stuck on by a main tank I usually have end regen so I just take off... he turns around...so... I turn around and beat on him some more.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Keep defense you have to put some thought into your &quot;fun time.&quot;  Here is one to try that you'll get a kick out of:<br>
<br>
1- first you need your enter exit macro<br>
<br>
2- helps to have a healer shmn knowing your gonna do it<br>
<br>
3- OK... so you hit exit and CHAAAAAAARRGGGGEE outside !  STICK first caster sitting down you see and get the &quot;skald crit shot in.&quot;<br>
<br>
4- oh yeah... btw... when you pop outside hit your macro again before charge, that way at the &quot;end for your charge&quot; you instantly teleport back inside.  With skald speed going I can get to almost the middle/bottom of the hill wack some wizard and dd him twice before I'm instantly popped back inside. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Another thing is... learn how to build those catapults, they can be very fun while you wait to do the traditional chase them down kinda rvr.<br>
<br>
Me and the tanks in my group usually the zerk throw up trebs like nobodies business in keep defense, on the merchant keeps. <p>&lt;center&gt;<br>
