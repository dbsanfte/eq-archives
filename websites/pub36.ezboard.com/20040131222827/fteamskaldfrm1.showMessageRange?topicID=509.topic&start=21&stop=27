Parry is still reported to be sub-par in RvR as a defense.  Bugs vs groups is still being reported by the warrior TL, they have all the relevant test data already.  Being that parry is a full 1/3 of our available spec lines, we really need a boost where parry is concerened.<br>
<br>
2. Chant of Blood - group damage add - is currently our ONLY RvR combat group support.  The range and cap at 7dps renders it useless in a group, and is primarily a solo damage add in terms of usefulness.  Thanes get a higher DPS damage add, helaers get a higher DPS damage add, Runemasters have Dark spec to get a higher damage add (the most common nuker template), that can also be cast on others.  The damage add ONLY affects other melees in the group.  All of these things stack up to make our combat support song, ineffective at boosting a groups chance in RvR, making it harder for people to justify having skalds in RvR groups.<br>
<br>
Suggest 1500 or 2000 range<br>
Suggest raising to 10 or 11 DPS at the top end, scaling down from there.<br>
<br>
3. Suggest adding a second melee song to be played either when everyone already has damage add via an RM, OR, when you have two skalds in a group.  One skald-only syndrome in groups is common.<br>
<br>
4. Consider adding some other melee boost, a self haste buff for instance, to keep us in line with being a better melee than minstrels, and on close to our closest fighters, thanes and champions.<br>
<br>
That's all I see that needs fixing.<br>
<br>
Thanks Roseanne!<br>

It would make perfect sense for us as a light tank/music class to have some higher evade than the beefy warrior.<br>
<br>
I love the idea of something to add to our keep effectiveness, as well, but i am very deeply concerned with our defensive issues. Parry is simply not enough, and evade would be a good supplement. With a 40weapon/25parry/46song template and dodger2, skalds could look forward to a nearly 50% melee avoidance defense. (30% parry, 20% evade)<br>
<br>

Because with the limited (1.5) number of specs points, a majority of us has let parry slide to a very low score because it was useless. Even if they fix parry and give all parrying classes a respec (which is doubtful, considering they didn't to it for shield users), it will just increase the gap with the &quot;real&quot; melee hybrids (those with 2.0 spec) and the skalds. Our parry will be slightly better, sure, but theirs will be a lot better too.<br>
Just imagine a LW hero with a parry fix ...<br>
I'd really prefer a skald specific tweak.<br>

<br>
1. Raise the weapon skill multiplier a little, so it would be higher than 900-1000 at lvl 50, but less than a true melee class. This will also improve our defense ability.<br>
<br>
2. Change the DD damage type from body to energy. That way you won't get max resist on every devoted and non-devoted RvR enemy player, AND it would fit the spell animation better.<br>
<br>
3. Change the range of DD to 1500, or better, add a castable AE spell at 47 Battlesongs skill, and/or a castable long range spell at 50. That will give the skald something to do in keep raid/defense as all hybrid class can and should, and give a good reason to spec higher in battlesongs.<br>
Adding this AND the weaponskill will balance the class, giving it much more spec choices, like a 50 weapon spec &quot;melee&quot; skald, 50 BS spec &quot;support&quot; skald or a balanced &quot;true hybrid&quot; skald.<br>
<br>
4. Change the mezz type to energy/matter. It needs to be on a different resist type than the healer mezz.<br>
<br>
5. Change the damage add range to 1500.<br>
<br>
6. Give a reason for the Skald to use items with +BS skill and raise it beyond 50, by adding mezz duration and increasing the DD min/max damage linearly for each point (and correct me if it's already that way, although my tests show that it's not).<br>
<br>
7. Change the FoG RA to something useful, or AT LEAST multiply the DPS it adds by 5 (35 DPS) and raise the duration to 60 seconds, so it would worth the 14 points it consumes. Still, RAs like BoF will be better, since they affect the whole group, not just the melee classes. Another possibility for FoG is to add 5 DPS for each member in the group, so it would be useless for soloing, but excellent for big groups.<br>
Another suggestion is a stackable 60 seconds 15% boost to all-spell resists and 25% chance to absorb 50% of a bolt's damage. A Skald who buys this expensive ability will have less chance to die in 5 seconds when going for the caster in RvR (1 melee hit and 2-3 nukes of 400 dmg), and maintain his role as a caster killer <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
8. Add determination to the Skald's RA list. I personally would like to see the &quot;general concept&quot; of a skald as a more simple, heavier melee class than Albion's Minstrel or Hibernia's Bard, but that's just me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
9. Change MotArcane so it would be useful - could be nice if it will add some DPS to our damage add for example. That might make our 7 dps chant more useful for RvR groups.<br>
<br>
10. Add MoMagery and Wild Power to our RA list, thus making our DD more efficient, and giving more spec options for Skalds higher in the RR tree.<br>
<br>
11. Add Dodger to our RA list, and Evade II to our skills.<br>
<br>
12. Add a castable self buff. My suggestion is a stackable 10% boost to block chance and 50% chance to proc a self haste/3 sec stun after a successul block. That will give a reason to use 1h weapon and shield. A skald cannot spec in shields anyway, so this &quot;buff&quot; will compensate that.<br>
<br>
So! To sum it all up, most of the suggestions here are not for powering up the Skald, but to give this class better spec options, both in specline and RAs. A Skald with ALL the listed abilities WILL be quite powerful, but will be able to get them all only at a high RL, since he simply can't buy them all.<br>
<br>
Ooops... forgot to mention the missing spell pulse fix!<br>
<br>
That's it for now,<br>

Its virtually impossible to kill a Minstrel with a 1 handed weapon while they are running the new AA chant.  You simply do not do enough dmg quick enough.<br>
<br>
In order to get by the AA chant you absolutely HAVE to use a 2 hander to get a significant amt of damage above the absorption per hit cap.  Does anyone know if the new AA chant stacks with PBT....cause if it does, you've got a group that is pretty much immune to melee damage.<br>
<br>
To counter this, Skalds are gonna need more dmg output and preferably in a &quot;magic&quot; form so that it bypasses AA and PBT.<br>

I think that the class needs some things to bring it back in line with the majority of other classes out there but it is not completely gimped as some express.  What I would like to see<br>
<br>
1)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Song of Rest fixed ----  Finally done so nothing here <br>
2)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Power of DDs  ---- Again resolved with latest patch<br>
3)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Access to Dodger RA ---- Skald defense needs help and this is a easy one to implement<br>
4)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Access to Determination RA ---- Mez/stun is a killer and as one of the few classes on the front line we need something other than just purge to counteract this<br>
5)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Range of DDs to 1500 ---- Keep defense and keep assaults are an exercise in futility now.  Extra range is not overpowering and would increases our abilities<br>
6)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Range of Damage add up to 1500 ---- This is in line with other chant classes and would make it more group friendly <br>
7)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Amount of Damage add up to 10 DPS ---- Per our special RA this is our class defining ability, it needs to be the best in the realm and online with other realms<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Dropped pulses ---- This lowers our overall run speed and damage add as it drops when you need it<br>
9)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Combine resist chants into 2 songs ---- I never use this unless there are 3 skalds in a group, even then it is pot luck on which one to chose.  Make sure that it is being stacked correctly with other buffs.<br>
10)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp New Melee oriented song ---- we need something else to do.  To be honest I am not crazy about the reflective chant; just don’t see how it can be explained within our abilities.  What I would like to see is a melee resist chant that goes over normal cap.  It would make us better and more useful in combat but mages would still be able to target it.  The levels may need to be adjusted so that they are not overpowering but I think this would be comparable to the new song minstrels got.<br>
<br>
Name: Bragi’s defense<br>
Target: Group<br>
Description: Melee resist song <br>
Range: 1500<br>
Cast: Instant (pulse)<br>
Duration: 6 seconds<br>
Refresh Timer: 6 seconds<br>
Levels <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 16 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp +3% to Thrust, Crush and Slash Resist<br>
26&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp +7% to Thrust, Crush and Slash Resist <br>
36&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp +10% to Thrust, Crush and Slash Resist<br>
46&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp +15% to Thrust, Crush and Slash Resist<br>
<br>
Overall I think this would give us some nice utility and make us more than speed bots.  We would have 2 (3 if you count the spell resist chants) chants for combat, have some roles with keep battles and beef up or defense.  We would also get a small offense improvement with the increased range on our DDs.  <br>
