A little confusing at first, but here are some quick notes; <br>
<br>
1. The CITY is laid out in four quarters.<br>
2. There are 3 overhead walkways, the North and South ones are short and the EASTERN one is long.<br>
3. All of the &quot; zone/book ports &quot; are on the outer edges, SE, East and NE areas.<br>
4. The DRUID Ring/Circle of Knowledge is at the NW corner of the Northern section or LIBRARY quarter.<br>
5. Two BANKS, one in the SE corner of the LIBRARY (northern area) quarter and there is a Gnome in one of the wooden buildings (forgot to write his name down).<br>
6. Yes, there is a Soulbinder.<br>

You say, 'Hail, Seer Mal Nae`Shi'<br>

Seer Mal Nae`Shi snaps from her meditation, now aware of your presence.  'Greetings traveler, I am Mal Nae`Shi.  I have come here to heighten my awareness through meditation, much can be learned through a brief exploration of one's self... Assuming there is something there to learn.  While reaching inner peace is a journey each spirit must undertake on its own, I can begin your enlightenment with a short [guided meditation], which will aid your memory, when you are seated and ready.<br>

You have to be seated when you reply &quot;what guided meditation&quot; for her to tell you the flags.<br>

Many have struggled for a long time to find their reward. Some are not even aware of what is it they are looking for, but will know it when they see it. Would you care to [help] me out? It will only take a moment.'<br>
<br>
You say, 'I will help you'<br>
<br>
Willamina says 'How wonderful! To pass the time I enjoy sitting under the trees and sewing together luscious fabrics. But now it seems my old sewing needles have all broke or gone dull, and I require a new supply. Bolcen Tendag has promised to purchase and deliver some for me, but he has not yet arrived and I worry about him. If you could locate him and ask him <br>
<br>
Go to Bolcen<br>
<br>
You say, 'I have come for the needles'<br>
<br>
Bolcen Tendag says 'I feel just terrible that I haven't been to see Willamina yet. Due to my illness I barely have the energy to stand. If you could aid me in some way, I would greatly appreciate it. Mirao Frostpouch might have an elixir that would help me feel better. Please seek him out and ask for it.'<br>
<br>
Hike further on to Mirao in the neutral part of town<br>
<br>
You say, 'I have come for the elixir'<br>
<br>
Mirao Frostpouch says 'That poor lad, he's always catching ill this time of year. Unfortunately I am out of the medicine he needs right now. Perhaps if you could obtain the key ingredient I am missing, I could brew up a batch for you to take to him. I have heard Cador recently came into possession of some black lava powder. If you can convince him to give you some, bring it to me right away!'<br>
<br>
Hike onwards to Cador's place in the good part of town. near plane of tranquility zone<br>
<br>
You say, 'do you have any black lava powder?'<br>
<br>
Oracle Cador says 'You are most astute. I do have a stock of black lava powder with me, but I will only share it with those who prove themselves worthy. Onirelin Gali is currently in possession of an artifact I need to better commune with the spirits. Please recover it for me.'<br>
<br>
Go to Onirelin<br>
<br>
You say, 'I have come for the artifact'<br>
<br>
Onirelin Gali pauses for a moment and continues, 'I am aware of that which Cador desires. Be wary of his ways for they are not always as they appear. Nevertheless, if he thinks this artifact will bring him greater peace, he may have it for a price. Certainly I have no use for it but what do I get in return? I'll tell you. Narik and I used to be good friends, until he became jealous of my relationship with his former companion Elisha. During our fight, he marched off with one of my finest jewels, and I believe still has it. Find him and ask for my jewel back. If you bring it to me, Cador may get want he wants as well.'<br>
<br>
Then back over to the neutral part of town to Arch Mage Narik<br>
<br>
You say, 'I have come for the jewel'<br>
<br>
Arch Mage Narik slams his book shut. 'So, the snake has legs after all! Tell Onirelin if he wants this back, he can come here himself and kiss my. . ., no wait. I have a better idea.' He draws closer and whispers, 'Did Onirelin tell you why I took this jewel? I did it in response to him taking my ladylove, Elisha Dirtyshoes. We were to be married until she ran off with him. However, she also ran off with my engagement ring I gave to her. It is quite valuable to me, and I would be most happy to have it back. If you can procure it from her, I'll give Onirelin his jewel back. He's suffered long enough, I think.' <br>
<br>
You say, 'can I have the ring'<br>
<br>
Elisha Dirtyshoes sighs and says, 'Tis a painful memory, for sure. My love for Narik fell once I met Onirelin, but my love for him was not reciprocated. Now I am left with no one to share my life, with only this ring as a reminder. Narik may have it back if he desires it, but then I shall be left truly alone. Boiron Ston once held a door open for me, such a handsome dwarf he is. If he could only find more time to spend with me, giving up this ring would be no problem at all. Do you think he likes me? Could you ask him and find out?' <br>
<br>
You say, 'do you like elisha dirtyshoes?'<br>
<br>
Boiron Ston says 'Aye, she's a pretty lass. And I am aware of her feelings toward me. I haven't had the courage to approach her though. My family standard has recently disappeared, and no dwarf is the same when their standard is in jeopardy. Seek out Caden Zharik and demand my standard back, I believe he may have lifted it from me.'<br>
<br>
Arrrgh.. where did I sign up to be the local constable....the dang gnome is up in the inner ring outsideon a ledge..<br>
<br>
You say, 'I have come for the standard'<br>
<br>
Caden Zharik turns white with fear. 'Ah, so he sent you to rough me up, did he? Fine, but you should know you couldn't hurt me any worse than Agrakath Theric would! I'm in a bit of trouble you see, I owe Agrakath some money I haven't got. So I stole the standard to pay him off. If you could please find him and have him somehow erase my debt, I would gladly give the standard back.'<br>
<br>
You say, 'I have come to erase the debt'<br>
<br>
Agrakath Theric grins and says, 'So, that weasel Caden has sent you to settle his debt? And you actually agreed to this endeavor? Ha ha, very well! I shall transfer the responsibility of what Caden owes me to your shoulders. I have a simple job for you. Somewhere in the library there lies a book I have been searching for, but it has eluded me for quite some time. I believe it can be found somewhere in the upper levels. You are to venture into Myrist and seek out a tome titled History of Evils: The Age of Scale, and bring it to me. Do this one task for me and your debt shall be relinquished.'<br>
<br>
Ok... one book.... in a library. Took me a bit to find it - but it's on the bottom shelf located at neg 100 pos 1000 (it's about a 30 minute respawn give or take). Book will spawn here, about halfway stuck in bookcase. {History of Evils: The Age of Scale}<br>
<br>
Agrakath Theric eyes go wide with surprise as you hand over the book. 'Very impressive for one of your abilities. Here, take this note to Caden. He is absolved of his debt to me at this time.'<br>
<br>

Caden Zharik eyes go wide with relief. 'Oh thank you thank you! Here, take the standard. And do apologize to Boiron for me. It shall never happen again. Again, thank you!'<br>
<br>
You gain party experience!!<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Boiron Ston seems to perk up. 'Ah, 'tis a beauty, is it not? I thank you for its safe return. Perhaps I shall go and visit Elisha after all. Please take this letter to her, so she may be ready for me when I arrive.'<br>
<br>
You gain party experience!!<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
Elisha Dirtyshoes reads the letter and says, 'Oh happy day! Boiron will be visiting me soon. You may take Narik's ring back to him now. If you'll excuse me, I have some cleaning up to do.'<br>
<br>
You gain party experience!!<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
Arch Mage Narik says 'This is truly excellent. You have done well recovering this for me. You may take Onirelin's jewel and also tell him never to set foot near me again. Leave me now, I have much work to do.'<br>
<br>
You gain party experience!!<br>
----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Onirelin Gali says 'How did you get this away from Narik? Oh never mind, I'm just happy to have it back. I shall give you what Cador desires now, keep it secure and deliver it to him.'<br>
<br>
You gain party experience!! <br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>

You gain party experience!!<br>
----------------------------------------------------------<br>

Mirao Frostpouch takes the powder and quickly dashes it into a boiling cauldron. He then stirs it and pours the concoction into a small bottle. 'Here you go, this should make poor Bolcen feel much better. Hurry now, he's waiting.'<br>
<br>

Bolcen Tendag says 'Oh thank you so much.' He drinks from the bottle, then reaches in his pocket and produces a set of needles. 'I believe this is what Willamina is in need of. Please take these to her and give her my best.'<br>
<br>
You gain party experience!! <br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
Willamina takes the needles and smiles. 'Thank you so much, kind stranger. I can't tell you how much you have really helped by doing this for me. It's funny, you know. The entire city seems to be in a happier mood today. I can't quite put my finger on it, but everyone seems to have uplifted spirits. Oh well, thank you again. I have something you may find to be of use to you, if you would be interested. Remember, knowledge is the key to life.'<br>

At one of the pools you will find Tratlan Jowyr and Wicas Adaolath.<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Tratlan Jowyr' <br>
<br>
Tratlan Jowyr looks deeply into the pool in front of him, 'Well darn it! I still can't see anything in this blasted [pool], can you Wicas?'<br>
<br>
Wicas Adaolath says 'Nothing at all. Do you think that he led us astray?' <br>
<br>
You say, 'What pool?' <br>
<br>
Tratlan Jowyr glances up at you like he just noticed your presence, 'This pool. There is supposed to be strong [magic] in it.' <br>
<br>
You say, 'What magic?' <br>
<br>
Tratlan Jowyr says 'Scrying magic. These pools can supposedly glance into all of the knowledge past, present, and future.' <br>
<br>
Wicas Adaolath says 'I think we should just do what [Tarerd] wants us to do.' <br>
<br>
You say, 'Who tarerd?' <br>
<br>
Wicas Adaolath says 'Tarerd is the one who told us about these pools. He wanted us to kill some sort of lizards for him, but we have neither the time nor energy for such adventures. Perhaps you can get some information about the pools from him.'<br>
<br>
Tarerd Gahar is at another nearby pool. <br>
<br>
Hail, Tarerd Gahar' <br>
<br>
Tarerd Gahar says 'I'm sorry Syfoo, I have neither the time nor the patience to chat right now.' <br>
<br>
You say, 'What pool?' <br>
<br>
Tarerd Gahar says 'Oh Tatlan and Wicas sent you did they? I'll tell you what I told them, nothing is free. If you want to know about the pools then I need something [from you] first.'<br>
<br>
You say, 'What from me?' <br>
<br>
Tarerd Gahar says 'I'm sure it'll be easy for an adventurer as you. I am working on a potion, and I cannot currently travel to gather my last component. If you could bring me the blood of a Sarnak I'd be willing to share what I know.'<br>
<br>
Sarnak blood is of course a random drop from nearly any sarnak, you can probably find one at a merchant for sale. <br>
<br>
When you have it give it to Tarerd Gahar. <br>
<br>
Tarerd Gahar says 'Ahh this is exactly what I was looking for. All the information I've gathered from these pools has come from Myrist. Thiran will give you the book I used as a reference. Give him this note so he knows I sent you'<br>
<br>
Thiran is a Vicar he’s on the first basement floor of the basement (go down one lvl when you enter. <br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Vicar Thiran' <br>
<br>
Vicar Thiran says 'A dark day to you, Syfoo. New Tanaan has opened its arms to all of Norrath's travelers and scholars alike -- though still I doubt most are worthy of our infinite and unsurpassed knowledge. In any case, we all must uphold the laws of our city, else we become as debased and pathetic as the secular, warring cultures of the material universe. You will find that, despite the medium of our birth or the shadow of faith in our hearts, we are all equally tolerant of each being to approach us. Though I myself am no stranger to the duties of a mentor, I do not think that at this juncture, I would provide any useful assistance to any not of the many clergies associated with the pantheon. If you do indeed serve one of the gods of Nature and Influence, then my services may not prove a waste of our collective time. Search my inventory at your will, and purchase what you wish should you find anything of use to you at this point in your life of service.'<br>
<br>
Give him the note: <br>
<br>
Vicar Thiran quickly reads the note, and says 'Tarerd wants me to give you that book? I thought he wanted me to keep it secret. Well no matter.' Thiran rummages through the books in front of him. 'Well this is unfortunate. It looks like I loaned my friend the incorrect book. I'm not sure where he's gone off to, here is the book he was looking for. If you happen to run into Jeren Manri anywhere, he'll probably exchange this book for the book on the scrying pools.'<br>
<br>
Thiran gives you a book “Goblins and their religion”. This is of course the only clue to where Jeren Manri is, can you guess where?<br>
<br>
Jeren Manri is in the Temple of Droga. His loc is 473.95, 1747, -252. <br>
<br>
He is in a very tiny room with fake walls on each end. <br>
<br>
Hail, Jeren Manri' <br>
<br>
Jeren Manri says 'Shhh, be quiet! The goblins may hear you.' <br>
<br>
Give him the book that Thiran gave you: <br>
<br>
Jeren Manri says 'Oh! Thank you, I assume this means that Thiran sent you. I ran off with the incorrect book without thinking to check. Would you be kind enough to return this to him?'<br>
<br>
You actually do not return it to Thiran, the book has 5 charges of bind sight, but don’t panic, that’s not the end.<br>
<br>
 Go back to the very first guy you talked to, Tratlan Jowyr back in Plane of Knowledge, Good Side. Give him the book:<br>
<br>
Tratlan Jowyr leafs quickly through the book. 'Thank you, it will take quite some time to go through all the information here. Here is a little something for your troubles.'<br>
<br>
You gain party experience!!<br>
<br>
YOU RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING ITEM:<br>
<br>

Ramos Jerwan says 'Good day, traveler. Many curious people about these recent days, all inquiring in their thirst for knowledge and personal advancement. Well, if you lead the humble life of a fisherman, or break from the squalls of battle for some peace and quiet at a river or sea shore, then you have come to the right man. All the supplies any fisherman needs may be purchased at my shop, though if for some reason I do not possess that which you are seeking, perhaps my comrade, Daeld, will. Or have you come perhaps to help me with my studies?'<br>
<br>
<br>
You say, 'what studies?'<br>
<br>
<br>
Ramos Jerwan says 'It's quite simple really. I'm interested in studying some aquatic specimens from around the planes. Your responsibility would be to collect some parts for me. Care to take up your fishing rod and give me a hand with that?'<br>
<br>
<br>
You say, 'I will give you a hand'<br>
<br>
<br>
Ramos Jerwan says 'There are some particularly interesting cichlid swimming about in the Plane of Nightmare. I also hear the discus in the Plane of Valor are quite plentiful. I need you to bring me two sets of bones from each for study. You do know how to extract them, yes? If not, I believe the lovely Peras Glickon may have something that can instruct you. Best of luck, lad.'<br>

<br>
You must first complete the Willamina's Needles quest. Then equip the planar traveler's manual and hail Winon. <br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Winon Glahar' <br>
<br>
Winon Glahar says 'Good day, Sharel. I see your curiosity of the planes is growing, as you have obtained a manual on planar travel. It is good to see young adventurers interested in planar exploration, but there is one aspect of discovery you must always be prepared for, the struggle for survival. There are very dangerous places to be seen and experienced out there, and it would behoove you to be ready to face what challenges may come. With my help, I can teach you the basics of planar stealth and reflexes if you are [willing to learn].'<br>
<br>
You say, 'I am willing to learn' <br>
<br>
Winon Glahar says 'This is good. Through your trials of planar travel shall your knowledge of stealth techniques grow, and the more you learn, the more you shall produce. In order to prove your newfound knowledge, your first lesson will be to create a special [planar stein] of particular design. Once you have acquired this stein, you must give it to me along with your Planar Traveler's Manual. Once done, new lessons may be opened up to you.' <br>
<br>
You say, 'what planar stein' <br>
<br>
Winon Glahar says 'To fashion the stein I seek, you must acquire a Block of Tanaan Clay, a Ceramic Lining Sketch, Tainted Planar Essence, a Water Flask, and some Sculpting Tools. Use these items in a pottery wheel to create your base model to work from. Crush some Valor Crystals together with some Glaze Lacquer in a glaze mortar to make Crystalline Valor Glaze. You must then take a Lacquered Peridot, the Crystalline Valor Glaze, a High Quality Firing Sheet, and the base model stein and merge them in a kiln to put the finishing touches on your work. I hope to see you bring me a handsome-looking stein soon. Good luck!'<br>
<br>
Make the stein and hand in both stein and manual to receive your Beginner Magic Manual (for instructions on how to make the planar steins go here)<br>

Some hint to quests, information etc.  Thought people would enjoy what we're finding out there.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Guardian Asirav'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Guardian Asirav says 'Welcome to the Selia district of [New Tanaan].  Be sure to help us to keep it clean!'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
You say, 'what new tanaan'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Guardian Asirav says 'New Tanaan is a haven for knowledge and those who seek it, and exists outside of all normal physical and political boundaries.  If you are [looking] for something, you've come to the right place.  A magically enforced peace exists throughout the city.  No one is able to wield a weapon or cast harmful magic here, making crime almost non-existent.  The city is divided into several sections -- [Kartis], the dark district; [Tanaan], the neutral district; [Selia], the light district; [Jeral] Abbey, the trade plaza; and of course [Myrist], the Great Library.'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
You say, 'what looking'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Guardian Asirav says 'Everyone in this city seems to be on a mission of some kind.  I heard recently there are some who are searching for new [armor].  Perhaps you are also looking for something in particular?  If you can't find it at the [bank], then hopefully by using the [portals], you can find what you seek much faster.'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
You say, 'what armor'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Guardian Asirav says 'Every guild master you will find in this city is looking for certain sets of armor.  When you meet up with one, be sure to ask them what kind of armor they are looking for.  Perhaps you could even help them out with finding it?'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
You say, 'what kartis'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Guardian Asirav says 'Kartis is the dark district in the western part of the city, easily identifiable by its dead trees, dim lanterns, and grimy, rundown buildings that are cracked and crumbling from wear.  Ogres, trolls, iksar, and dark elves come to study in Kartis, and if you look around you will find portals to Neriak, Grobb, Oggok, Paineel, Cabilis, and the Overthere.'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
You say, 'what tanaan'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Guardian Asirav says 'Tanaan is the neutral district in the southern part of the city that contains many guild trainers and shops.  Here you will find members of just about any race pursuing their own fields of study in the never-ending quest for knowledge. This area of the city contains portals to Freeport, Qeynos, Ak'Anon, Shar Vahl, Firiona Vie, the Great Divide, and the Nexus.  You can also find the portal to the Plane of Tranquility here as well.'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
You say, 'what selia'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Guardian Asirav says 'Selia is the light district in the eastern part of the city, recognizable by its pristine buildings, relaxing reflecting pools, and lush vegetation.  Many high elves, wood elves, erudites, and halflings come to Selia to meditate or read books they checked out from the Library. The portals to Felwithe, Kelethin, Kaladim, Rivervale, Halas, and Erudin can be found here too.'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
You say, 'what myrist'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Guardian Asirav says 'The Great Library stands proudly at New Tanaan's center, and houses tomes of lore written throughout the times.  There are many legends of knowledge contained within its walls, including secrets of magic and histories of Norrath.  All races are welcome to browse the information stored within the Library, for knowledge is a tool to be shared.  The [council] also conducts their business from a meeting hall on the Library's top floor.'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
You say, 'what council'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Guardian Asirav says 'The current council is composed of delegates from each district in New Tanaan, chosen for their leadership, fairness, and deep love of the accumulation of knowledge.  Grand Librarian Maelin Starpyre leads the council, which also includes Councilman Taldarius, Councilwoman Kerasha, and Councilman Srethix.'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Hierophant Trilawyth gives a stern study of Andaris before him, 'Greetings, traveler, and welcome to the district of Tanaan. We are a people of neutrality -- free of the blinding leash of the light and unhindered by the taint of the shadow's corruption. Should you choose to respect our ways and wishes, then you are welcome among us -- however, be prepared for questions regarding your presence. We are wary, but only as our way of life is delicate in its balance. If you wish to return to Norrath, I would suggest that you venture to the district of Selia, for some of the destinations that our devises of teleportation would lead you might be inhospitable to those who walk in the light, so to speak.'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Bennder says out of character, 'We are lower than Mystics? '<br>

 <br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Assassin Rysarieul'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Assassin Rysarieul gives a very graceful bow, flawlessly mimicking the movement of a well-trained prince. 'Welcome to Selia, traveler. The light that thrives here embraces you warmly, though I see that within you the light has yet to truly become one with your convictions and spirit. But this is nothing that cannot be remedied in time and with discipline and patience, friend. In the mean time, while you search for the path that beckons to you, feel at ease in our midst for we are quite eager to have you among us. The people of Selia have come together in hopes of lending their knowledge and ways to your own ventures and endeavors, should you have need or wish of our guidance, of course. If by chance you are a master of the shadows -- an ear to its secrets and hidden eye to the deception it houses -- then I am more than suited to be your mentor in such skills as you find progression through your trials upon Norrath.'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Virtuoso Zoama'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Virtuoso Zoama smiles softly and gives a gentle nod of her head in warm recognition of Spiritual before her. 'The light of Selia shines brightly upon your arrival, my friend. Many of us have spent many long years waiting for the opportunity for one such as yourself to grace our presence, for the true challenge in mentorship lies with those who have yet to truly embrace the philosophies and virtues that we hold sacred and dear. Do not be frightened by this, for we will force nothing upon you -- only show you the path that may unlock the purity of the goodly virtues that you already possess. I would be more than pleased to aid you myself, but the constraints that the council has placed upon all of New Tanaan's adepts allows for us to teach only those who follow the same profession as we did in our past upon Norrath. If you are of the bardic practices, then we are indeed in luck. If not, then search further through our district and you will surely find one who is suitable to train you.'<br>

Gammle Hecht says 'Good day Spiritual.  I don't mean to be curt but I have much work to do to be ready for my museum display, and there is not much time left.

 <br>
<br>
Alexis Dubbani says 'Why hello there, Spiritual.  I'm so glad you could take the time to see my exhibit.  I am a collector of [books], and I seek many more volumes of strange and wonderful texts.  Perhaps I could hire your services to help me find some more?'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
You say, 'what books'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Alexis Dubbani says 'I am still looking for the following.  Please locate a Black Tome with Silver Runes, Tome of the Eternal, Codex of the Warrior, and a Book of Inspiration.  Please store them inside a Collector's Box you can get from [Merri] for safekeeping.  After you find all the books, be sure to close the box and return it to me.  I appreciate your help.'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Curator Merri'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Curator Merri beams a smile as you approach. 'Welcome Spiritual.  This building will be the site of New Tanaan's greatest museum ever.  I realize it looks a bit empty now, but just imagine how beautiful it will look after we fill it with rare and exotic treasures from all over.  It's a very exciting time, no?  Of course, we still need to obtain a few more [artifacts].'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
You say, 'what artifacts'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Curator Merri says 'Each of the people you see working here has their own exhibit to build and maintain.  If you speak to them, they can tell you about which items they are looking for to add to their collection.  Any items you collect will need to be placed inside one of my storage containers.  If you [need a Collector's Box] at any time, just ask me.  Also know I could use some help in retrieving some [special items] for my own exhibit.'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
You say, 'what special items'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Curator Merri says 'My display will showcase the many interesting religious idols and artifacts from Norrath's history.  Most of my gallery is complete, but I still need a few more items.  I am looking for a Forlorn Totem of Rolfron Zek, Idol of Woven Grass, Coldain Fetish, and a Petrified Totem.  Once you have these holy artifacts, close them up inside a Collector's Box and return it to me.  Good luck.'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Lohie Cantare'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Lohie Cantare says 'Greetings, Spiritual.  Have you come to see my exhibit?  I am honored but also sad to say it is incomplete.  Mine will be the finest presentation of musical history you will find, once I finish assembling my display.  If you have some free time, perhaps you could help me collect some still missing [pieces]?'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
You say, 'what pieces'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Lohie Cantare says 'I need you to bring me a Minotaur Horn, Tambourine of Rituals, Orcish Lute of Singing, and a Stretched Skin Drum.  If you could find these for me, I would be most overjoyed.  You will need to get a Collector's Box from [Merri] to keep them in.  Close the box up tightly and return it to me once you have placed the instruments inside.  Hurry back and we shall have a grand festival!'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Renni Stone'<br>

Renni Stone says 'Har har, Spiritual!  I see yer curious mind has brought ye to what will be the most fabulous and fascinating museum display of them all, the geological exhibit.  Behold the [rocks] of Norrath!  I'd be most delighted to show them to ye, eh, but I'm afraid it's not quite ready yet, you see.  Some pieces of my collection have gone missing and I haven't gone to get replacements yet.'<br>

Renni Stone says 'Eh, let's see.  I'm missing a Whirling Crystal, A Scarlet Stone, Icy Geoduck, and A Pulsating Rock.  Might ye have these on ye?  If ye do, go and get a Collector's Box from [Merri], and put them inside.  Close the box and bring it to me.  The display will be most grand if ye do!'<br>

Drelynn Beaufax says 'A fine day to you, Spiritual.  The exhibit you will see here soon will likely be the most valuable of them all.  My display will house some of the most precious and rare gemstones you will ever find.  It is too sad there are still spaces missing in my display box, if I could only find a few more [gems] to fill them out.'<br>

You say, 'what gems'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Drelynn Beaufax says 'To make the exhibit truly stand out, I would need to add a Blackened Sapphire, Greenscale Emerald, Shimmering Velium Ruby, and a Hope Diamond.  Could I perhaps procure these from you?  Visit [Merri] and get a Collector's Box from her.  Carefully place the gems inside and close it up.  Once you return this to me, I can pay you for your services.'<br>

Holly Longtail says 'Hello, Spiritual.  The preservation of ancestors is a time-honored tradition.  It's a task one must handle with painstaking care and precision.  Please do not fret for the lives of these specimens.  They live in the eternal realm of beauty now.  I have quite a large collection of stuffed animals ready to go, but many of them have sustained injuries in their capture.  In fact, I wouldn't mind some help to collect some [replacement parts] from creatures around the world.'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
You say, 'what replacement parts'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Holly Longtail says 'Grab a Collector's Box from [Merri] before you go.  You need to recover an Undead Froglok Tongue, Cockatrice Beak, High Quality Cougarskin, and a Tiny Rockhopper Eye.  Seal the box tightly and return it to me.  If the contents are in sufficient and usable condition, I may have a reward for you.'<br>

Tratlan Jowyr says 'Scrying magic.  These pools can supposedly glance into all of the knowledge past, present, and future.'<br>

You say, 'Hail, Sage Xelrin'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Sage Xelrin says 'Greetings Spiritual.  I assume you are here to ask about my research?  I imagine that word has spread of my groundbreaking approach to spell creation.  Well I am always willing to enlighten those that choose to learn.  As not to bog you down with too many details, my theory is simple. [Continue]'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
You say, 'continue'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Sage Xelrin says 'Well the idea is rather basic.  As I am sure you know, there are many magical artifacts in the world with effects that we have not mastered.  It is my conjecture that some of the magic may be extracted from these items in order to further our magical repertoire.  Even in the case where an object has a spell that we already have access to, I believe the binding used to tie the magic to the object could be useful as well. [Continue]'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
You say, 'continue'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Sage Xelrin says 'By using this box created in cooperation with the [other sages] in Knowledge, you will be able to either extract a magical scroll or the binding used to hold the magic to the object.  Those elements will be the basis for my research.  Just bring anything you manage to extract for me.'<br>

Sage Xelrin chuckles. 'Well my associates are working on their own theories for the creation of new magic.  I am sure that their projects are no where near advanced as mine, but even their primitive research could prove a boon in my own work.  If you happen to come across any of their research feel free to show it to my assistants, they will know the best manner in which to process it.  Bring reseach from Balic to Bolcen, and Gunyth's research to Acomar.  Thank you for your assistance.'<br>

Mystic Abomin says 'The mystics of New Tanaan embrace your presence among us most kindly -- regard us as friend and mentor, should you need our guidance. We have offered our services to the shamans of Norrath that venture in our city. Though our guidance is that of spells native to your world, the mystic scribes in this city may hold some convenience for we do not hold the prejudice of the material world's citizens. Beyond these familiar scrolls, I may be able to aid you further should you bring me a fledgling arcane item from the planes. You will know of that which I speak if and when you stumble upon such a rare and seemingly mundane item. Do not be fooled by its plain appearance -- the primordial essence of pure magic resides in these arcane relics and I can be the key to unlock them to the shamanistic powers.'<br>

Councilman Taldarius regards you, and grins.  'Greetings, Waalee.  I am Councilman Taldarius, mighty Paladin of Mithaniel Marr and Guardian of the City of Tanaan!  If you cannot find what you are looking for here in the Myrist library, I most certainly can add it to my list of things to look for in the Planes.  Unfortunately, I am quite busy at the moment, planning my next trip to the Elemental Planes.  I believe my aid may have some tasks he could use help with.  That is, if you are skilled enough.'<br>

 <br>
<br>
Aid Fimli says 'Wonderful! If you would gather the following; a bundle of superconductive wires, sillicorrosive grease, a gold tipped boar horn and a shard of pure energy, then take them to my uncle Sanfyrd in Ak'Anon.  I would really appreciate being able to get back to my work uninterrupted.'<br>

Aid Grimel says 'Greetings and Salutations Tsukune! I am Grimel, aid to the mighty paladin Councilman Taldarius.  In between his duties to the city, Taldarius and I spend most of our time in the Planes cleansing evil.  Even now I am preparing for battle.  Taldarius intends to go further into the Planes than ever before on our next trip and I am working on gathering the special supplies we need.  If you are willing to help I may have some use for your skills if you are a master of trades and have traveled in the Planes.'<br>

Vicar Thiran says 'A dark day to you, Dallaan. New Tanaan has opened its arms to all of Norrath's travelers and scholars alike -- though still I doubt most are worthy of our infinite and unsurpassed knowledge. In any case, we all must uphold the laws of our city, else we become as debased and pathetic as the secular, warring cultures of the material universe. You will find that, despite the medium of our birth or the shadow of faith in our hearts, we are all equally tolerant of each being to approach us. Though I myself am no stranger to the duties of a mentor, I do not think that at this juncture, I would provide any useful assistance to any not of the many clergies associated with the pantheon. If you do indeed serve one of the gods of Nature and Influence, then my services may not prove a waste of our collective time. Search my inventory at your will, and purchase what you wish should you find anything of use to you at this point in your life of service.'<br>

Illusionist Lobaen says 'Good day to you, Bkmill. Despite your purpose among us in New Tanaan, know that we bear no ill will toward any for mere distinctions of race or religious preference. We are all equals -- children of the gods and children of the earth alike. It has been a very long time since I have been among adventurers, and I admit that this is truly an experience I have not craved. The nymphs were persecuted in our day, though not through intended force, but in the expansion of your cultures and the erection of great elven and human cities. Aaah, but I do dwell on matters of the past. What is done is done. Now, I exist to aid you should you wish it, friend. I have adopted the mortal art of enchantment and what knowledge I have of it is yours should it be of use.'<br>

Cavalier Ethigom says 'Greetings to you, Estnato, and welcome to New Tanaan. The adepts that call this place home have graciously stepped forward to offer their aid to all of Norrath's travelers that enter our domain. Do not fear those here whom upon your world would be foe -- there is neither judgment nor prejudice among us. In my mortal years, I served Karana as a knight. New Tanaan called to me in my latter years and I accepted the invitation. Ever since, I have grown beyond my  mortal power as a crusader of my deity and the spells that Norrath had enabled me to possess are no longer needed. I have scribed them from memory upon new parchment and are at the disposal of any paladin who may find use of them.'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Cavalier Aodus says 'Hail to you, traveler. New Tanaan greets you warmly as a friend. All of this plane's adepts have eagerly come forward with much of their past knowledge of the world that had borne them. Though we are here, above the mortal quarrels of Norrath and exist only for mutual knowledge and enlightenment, we have maintained our past in memory. Many of us have chosen to scribe what we remember of our past in offering to the adventurers who have come before us. As a knight of Quellious, I have maintained all of my former training in faith and the blade, though now I may only present to you the tangible spells that any paladin may wield if not presently, then in time.'<br>

Wanderer Astobin says 'Greetings traveler. I am Wanderer Astobin, warden of nature and guardian of Tunare's most blessed and sacred of treasures -- life and balance. I have pledged my existence to upholding this vow and even here, that vow remains. Though I no longer carry my scimitar or scout the wilds of the world as one of its many guardians, my pledge shall remain whole through my guidance of others whose pledge is akin to mine. If you are a druid -- your deity matters not -- then allow me to guide you if I may. What spells I have scribed are for you to search through and purchase should you find them worthy of your abilities. If through your travels in the outer planes you discover incorporeal items seemingly of an arcane nature, do not disregard them. I am well-trained in the ways and manner of planar magic and will be more than willing to turn these fledgling arcane items into tangible spells suited for those of druidic vows.'<br>

Primalist Uliag says 'Hail to you, Tarrtarr. I will strive to aid you where I can -- as is my pledge to this city with our recent roll among the history of the primal soldiers. Unfortunately, my wisdom is bound solely to the world of beasts and spirits. If you believe that my knowledge would be of use to you, friend, then do not hesitate in searching my inventory. All that is here will likely come of use to you in some point or another throughout your existence in these dangerous times.'<br>

 <br>
<br>
Wisdomseeker Raulin says 'Hail adventurous traveler! I have been researching the druidic heritages of various Norrathian cultures and have made some interesting finds here in the great library.  Feel free to borrow the books I have found if you like. The sorcery of the library will return the books to their proper places when you are through with them.'<br>

Wanderer Kedrisan says 'Hail, Spiritual and good day to thee. The halls of New Tanaan are open to any being of intelligence and self-empowered will that wishes to walk among its halls and libraries, so dinnae be frightened by my seemingly nonconformist presence here. Like my fellow citizens, I have pledged my knowledge to any visitor that has any need or wish of me, though I fear I may only be of use to the druids of the material world. If you believe that I could provide anything of use to you, then do not hesitate to browse my inventory. All of the spells there were penned by my own hand and my stock is always plentiful.'<br>

It is so rare in this time of turmoil that so many beings of diverse and even opposing cultures and philosophies may come together without fear or hate of one another. Aaah, the bliss of balance -- and what an irony it is that all my life I strove for it upon the primal world and it is within the cosmos that I find it. I ramble, forgive me, friend. If you are a druid yourself and seek guidance in the ways of furthering your abilities as a warden of nature, then perhaps my inventory might hold something of use to you. Go on, then, and search as you will. Do not hesitate to purchase anything that catches your eye.'<br>

Yeah, yeah, I'm sure you're thinking that's silly and all, but how many people do you know of that can say they've broken out of the Eternal Prison, let alone in? 'None', right? So, we were all ready to go in when I got word that something else needed re-appropriating all quick like. I told Gilor to wait until I got back, but no. He had to run off, eager as always and as patient as a gust of wind. Now, I think he's in trouble.'<br>

I'd like to check on him, but if he isn't in there, I'm liable to get myself in trouble. I think I'd be much better off staying here and waiting for him. If you want to go look for him, I'd be quite grateful. I doubt you have the skills to get far in there.

If you can't find him, be on the lookout for anything that resembles a small bottle. He's got a way with rodents; so if you see some little pest carrying a bottle of some sort, grab him! It will most likely be a message for me. Bring it back immediately. It won't be of any use to you anyway, since you can't read our code. Be quick and good luck!'<br>

While he may have superior strength, his coordination is most inferior.  He's dropped many a gear on my toes, but I know he means well.

Elder Gelok says 'You see, this windmill is more than it seems.  It's quite a splendid device! It produces energy by converting the wind that rotates the blades into a power that supercharges the windmill's transcentrifugal axles.  In simple terms, what it does is creates a portal into the [Plane of Innovation].  What a wonderful place that is! A virtual dream-land for any gnome!'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
You say, 'what plane of innovation'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Elder Gelok says 'Oh, it is such an amazing place!  I ultimately desire to travel there to learn of advanced mechanics.  Alas, this windmill requires constant upkeep due the constant surge of power that it propels. The gears are constantly getting sandy and the axles lose their grease almost daily.  I'm often in need of [new parts] and that's where Drogguk's assistance would currently be handy, but I simply cannot sacrifice his current duties at this time. Pity, pity.'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
You say, 'what new parts'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Elder Gelok says 'Well, Drogguk used to travel through the portal to acquire items for me from the salvage yard. The last time he went through in search of parts he came back [badly wounded] and that's saying quite a lot! I was quite alarmed, but the elders nursed him to health with amazing haste. I simply cannot imagine placing him in such jeopardy again. He was lucky to return at all by the look of him then!'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
You say, 'what badly wounded'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Elder Gelok says 'Aye, you can still see some of the scars about his body.  He stumbled out of the portal that day, bloody and spouting on about shiny men trying to tear him apart.  He said they were speaking of research the whole time.  Frightful stuff, really.  Well, you look adventurous enough.  Why don't you go collect some supplies for me?  I fear that Drogguk would not be able to manage another trip to collect the [supplies] I require to maintain this place.'<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
You say, 'what supplies'<br>

Elder Gelok says 'Size 12 sprockets are always greatly needed.  Any Silicorrosive Grease you find would be a huge help as well.  You can never have too much Silicorrosive grease laying around.  Also, tri-platinum foil and mini-gyro shields would be good for something or another.  Micro-ceramic sleeves are a nice find as well.  Got all that?  Now, reach around up there in the area of the transcentrifugal axle that isn't working.  You'll either be badly wounded or transported to the Plane of Innovation. Take care!'<br>

Shera Banneth says 'My husband was Suili Banneth.  He was a foul drunk of the worst sorts, never an 'onest day o' work in his life.  Well I found a man worth my time so a lil hemlock in Suili's ale at night an he dinna wake up.  I guess his family was upset aboot tha, so they petitioned ta sen' me 'ere.'<br>

You say, 'Hail, Shaldyn Thunderhoof'<br>
<br>
Shaldyn Thunderhoof looks up at you with a curious gleam in his eyes. 'Ahh, a visitor.  Is there something you need or are you here for a story?'<br>
<br>
You say, 'I am here for a story'<br>
<br>
Shaldyn Thunderhoof says 'Well I'll tell you my story then.  I was once a master fletcher, my arrows flew straighter and farther than any made before and any that have come since.  I was a master of my craft; a bowman with a quiver of my arrows and one of my bows could drop a griffon at 20 paces with a single shot.  One day a [ranger] came with a special order, one that I couldn't let pass.'<br>
<br>
You say, 'what ranger'<br>
<br>
Shaldyn Thunderhoof says 'His name was Rhionn Leafsblade, I believe he resides here with me as well.  He wanted a magical arrow, a single arrow able to pierce even the strongest mithril breastplate.  I had done work with Rhionn before, and believed him an honorable man, and the [challenge] was not one that I could pass up.'<br>
<br>
You say, 'what challenge'<br>
<br>
Shaldyn Thunderhoof smiles.  'The arrow of course.  Mundane materials would not have been sufficient to hold the enchantments necessary to get this bow to perform as he requested.  I had Rhionn gather the materials I needed, the claw of a black drake, feathers from the Spiroc Lord, and a dracolich bone for the shaft.  I had no idea what he would [use it for].<br>
<br>
You say, 'what use it for'<br>
<br>
Shaldyn Thunderhoof says 'He used it for murder.  Cold blooded murder.  In my trade sect we were held responsible for the actions of our weapons.  When the sect council found what my arrow was used for, they sent me before the Tribunal.  I was found guilty for assisting in the murder of an innocent, and now I am here.'<br>
