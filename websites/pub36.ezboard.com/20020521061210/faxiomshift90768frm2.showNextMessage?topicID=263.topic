I personally hate to think of all the factors involved and what's what, but some things are for sure. also, its REALLY hard to compare caster defensive numbers to a tank class' same numbers... there are a lot of differences... saying that all lvl 60 characters are capped at 700ac when tanking a froglok krup knight because of those numbers is jumping to conclusions.<br><br>remember, ac isn't just another separate stat, it's a number that's a compilation of your defensive skill/armors/stats(agi) that is supposed to tell you how good your overall defense is. that's why leveling and building defensive skill will increase your ac, more agi can increase your ac, and any armor with ac points on it will increase your total armor class.<br><br>>>If this is true, then the only difference between a level 60, 700 AC wizard tanking an normal xp mob vs a level 60 warrior with 1400 AC is the HP difference and the defensive skills.>><br><br>there is a difference because the soft cap for the warrior is 1200ac(?) on that first mob. even if both characters were soft capped at 700ac it's still just that, a soft cap - and the additional 700ac past the soft cap should give SOME results however small ;) but these results do give me the impression that maybe some casters AC is possibly soft(hard?) capped a lot lower than warrior's AC for the same mobs.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/uglayde.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glayde</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Casual Poster</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#330000>(1/2/02 9:13:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/faxiomshift90768frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=222.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The effect of AC</span><hr size=1> Moo.<br><br>I'm sure the info of these tests would be useful if fighting guk frogs and low blues in velks was practical.<br><br>Those mobs are by no means indicitive of most normal grinding mobs. and certainly not of raid level mobs.<br><br>Tanks should still push AC to the max, with some regards to hps.<br><br>Everyone else should push hps and mana for raids.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/uiumunorn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>IumunoRN</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Power Poster</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#330000>(1/2/02 5:57:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/faxiomshift90768frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=222.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The effect of AC</span><hr size=1> Glayde, I posted this because these results seem to indicate that there's a point where AC has no more effect depending on the level of the mob, which is what would seem to be logical. What's more the test I posted was against a krup knight in Sebilis, not guk, a level  49-51 mob. It is indicative of a regular xp mob, though not a raid mob.<br><br>I was also finding interesting the possibility that AC doesn't mean jack for anyone beyond 700. While this does not sound logical, it wouldn't be impossible even if from casual observation everyone seem to agree that AC is important.

VI even said that agi helped with dodge while logs showed that the chances to dodge something are entirely skill based.<br><br>What I find disturbing with these parsed results is that the possiblity exist that there's no effect from AC at all beyond 700.

Back in early Beta Verant had AC listed as a blank stat.  They are now displayed as X/1000.  When this was done, they made a statement that AC was actually 2 factors, Hit Avoidance and Damage Mitigation.  Thus by combining them you could actually acheive scores over 1000, which was actually the cap for the individual components of AC.  I personally think that Verant just got lazy when it came to stat generation for gear and fixed the damage mitigation to a set percentage for everything.

AC seem to work the same for all classes considering results are consistent for an enchanter, a cleric, and a warrior, 3 classes with a wide difference in defense skill cap.  the soft cap seem to be 700 again for a level 60 character against:<br><br>a level 45ish mob in velketor labyrinth<br>a level 50ish mob in Sebilis<br>a level 60 mist panther in Wakening lands.<br><br>We can't jump to conclusion because  the mist panther is notorious for havign a really low max damage for a level 60 mob, BUT the fact is the results are consistent with 3 different mobs and 3 different classes. The only big jump obsered in any test was from 600 AC to 700 AC. going from 700 AC to 1400 AC is reducing damage taken against these mobs by 33%. Far less than I would have expected.<br><br>So I wouldn't conclude the following YET, but before getting more data I would say that HPS are far more important for survivability  than AC (not for efficiency though), and to a lesser extent defensive skills too because they give a guaranteed miss but they don't seem to negate a large amount of the attacks (10-15% for a level 60 warrior).<br><br>So it COULD be that the idea that casters and rangers die so fast because of their low AC is a myth. Much lesser hit points and to a lesser extent defensive skills would be the overwhelming determining factor.<br><br>You can see the full discussion at:<br><br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=9&t=006280">forums.castersrealm.com/c...9&t=006280</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br><br><br><br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/uiumunorn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>IumunoRN</A> at: 1/2/02 6:40:02 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/umournsong1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mournsong1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Power Poster</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#330000>(1/3/02 10:16:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/faxiomshift90768frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=222.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> AC  vs HPs</span><hr size=1> I've been in the tiny minority about this ever since level 20..I think AC is less important than most folks believe.  The most dramatic improvements in survivability and efficiency have always come for Folli when he's gotten a nice increase in HP gear, and I've never really noticed much difference in similar improvements in Folli's AC, even when having to serve as the tank for a XP group.  I guess I'm gratified to see that the numbers above tend to support my intuition or experience.  <br><br>More AC is probably always better then less.  But there is often a choice in gear between raw AC and HPs, and I think people often tilt the balance too much in favor of AC at the expense of hit points (and some other stats).  Raids vs. efficient grinding, and tanks vs other melees vs casters also affect this balance, of course.

When my Attack rating hits higher numbers, I am far more efficient and significant landing hits.  <br><br>My theory on this is as follows.<br><br>Attack rating / Armor Class = modifier on the combat table being used by the individual or mob.  Therefor, as soon as your attack rating breaks the AC of the mob you are no longer penalized and may actually gain a bonus on the combat table damage result.  I believe the penalties to be more drastic than the bonusses only based on the changes I see to my damage when buffing classes leave or enter the group.  in most raid environments my attack rating hits about 1320, almost 180pts higher than when I have no buffs that increase attack.  <br><br>The flip side to this is that monsters will gain the same bonus against anything with an AC lower than their attack rating.  If a  froglock in L Guk has an attack of 800, going higher than 800 AC will provide diminishing returns.  This can be tested by taking the same tank against a  lot of different types of mobs and parcing the data.
