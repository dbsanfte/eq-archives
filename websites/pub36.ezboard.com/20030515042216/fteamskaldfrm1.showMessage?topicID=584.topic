<br>
Well, guess what. it goes farther then that.  much much farther.<br>
<br>
Per what i was told by guildies who tested it already here is what we know.<br>
<br>
shammy has 20 conc points<br>
to cast full end regen on whole group (just YOUR group). costs 8 of those points.<br>
<br>
so assume you have fg of players.  12 conc points need to be spread on them.  All of this, is based off the lvl 2 or 3 (i was unclear on that point) end regen.  It takes all you conc to cast lvl 5.<br>
<br>
what does this mean?  means not every one in the group will get spec buffs.  It means selected people will get some form of end regen.  This means, unlike hibs/albs mids will no longer be able to perma sprint.  which means no means of escape, which means no means of fast relic runs.<br>
<br>
This means when you bust relic out of relic keep....they gonna beat you to the mmg or rvr dungeon if you both start at the same time.  It means when they bust the relic out, they gonna leave you in the dust like a honda civic from the early 80s vs a vette.<br>
<br>
Also, this means that with the new buff system they implemented, mids are going to be even further disadvantaged in straight up combat.<br>
<br>
I am a RR 6l4 skald.  fully buffed i have 414 str after the buff patch went in, prior to that, i was 360 str fully buffed.  alb and hib hybrids, tanks and light tanks were all similiarly effected.<br>
<br>
Now consider, our groups are going to be less buffed.  there will be no fully buffed group if they don't have buff bot tucked away somewhere that can do spec buffs.  This means that just based on conc capacity ALONE, mid groups are going to be at a significant melee disadvantage.  they won't have much end regen and htey won't be fully buffed.<br>
<br>
Casters will also be effected as they won't have piety and they won't have some of the nicer buffs, like str/con (will have to sacrafice so they can get dex after all).<br>
<br>
So here is what we see.<br>
<br>
enemy tank type assaliants will us harder and have higher con then we will because they have better chances of being fully buffed.<br>
<br>
Enemy casters will nuker harder (acuity buffs) and have more HPs and in alb cases AF then our casters.<br>
<br>
So in BOTH cases, we are facing opponents who outmatch us based on their buffs.<br>
<br>
Skalds will be especially hurt.  they have low defense, so they will have to sacrafice str buffs to get str/con buffs.  that zerker or savage will get the end buff over you.....so now you can't even chase down runners anymore (especially twisting bards, who you only caught because they might lose a pulse).<br>
<br>
And finally, alb/hibs are much much more likely to have high level, as in end 4 or 5 end regen then your fellow tanks are.  Which means they can sprint during the fight and style endlessly....while you can't. enemy casters will sprint away from you if you instas aren't up or they have immunity.<br>
<br>
<br>
So if i may make a suggestion, as this patch progresses, it behooves the entire midgard community to protest it, kicking and screaming the entire way....because if we don't stop it. RvR is going to be miserable soon. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://bellsouthpwp.net/d/o/donatea/x/sig-auren.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gnagrakk>Gnagrakk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Contributor</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#ff0000>(4/23/03 1:08:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=584.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: why the shammy nerf hurts Skalds.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>fully buffed i have 414 str after the buff patch went in, prior to that, i was 360 str fully buffed<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Our shamans won't sheepishly acknowledge the nerf, and change their buffing habits.<br>
The problem is that the &quot;live&quot; (non bot) shammies were speccing augmentation, because the spec was worth it (remember : shaman mend spec is abysmal, and shamans were arguably one the worse classes in the game before getting end, and that's why they, and not skalds, got the endurance regen in the first place. The way end regen is actually might be overpowered, the shaman class definitely is not). <br>
<br>
I can guarantee you that &quot;castrating&quot; the aug spec this way will make the few shaman that will be left respec the hell out of the aug spec, and try to find a modicum of RvR effectiveness by speccing cave (and probably a bit of mending, even if the spec is laughable).<br>
<br>
It won't be only changing the number of buffs that a shaman can give. Like all nerf of this magnitude, it is going to change the demographics of the shaman class, and it is at this time my primary concern. Albion took a lot, a whole lot of time to recover from the heavy handed smite nerf, when their primary buffing/healing/rezzing class vanished from the battlefield ... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aurensirramalot>AurenSirRamAlot</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/Auren/fullsize/shield.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Contributor</span><br>  Posts: 83<br> <font color=#ff0000>(4/23/03 3:19:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=584.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well</span><hr size=1> Wow, 15 points in strength at creation, plus aug strength 4?

15 points at creation<br>
aug str II<br>
Troll<br>
+75 from items (well actually cause i am still wearing my old gear its more like +93 because a lot of my stuff has str on it and they still haven't explained exactly how new caps work with overcapped stats and high RR)<br>
realm rank 6L4 plus new buff system yields those tasty numbers.<br>
<br>
yes, i can provide screenshots of my fully buffed self...if you really want me too.<br>
<br>
And yes, my damage per swing has shot through the roof since that patch.<br>
<br>
Since patch i got the TG 5.0 sec lifetap hammer.  Recent example (when i was close to fully buffed, 390 str) i hit a druid 3 times as they ran away from me with conquer, each hit was for 490-496.  i got two crits of 85 and 96 in  there too.<br>
<br>
That buff patch really borked the damage output of people with high realm rank and good buffs.  And no, my buffs come from actual players, not PK bots.<br>
<br>
Example. <br>
<br>
Today i was in a group with Kingfisher, lvl 50 zerker on Igraine.  we were both buffed with the exact same buffs, from the same shammies. he has 22k fewer Rps then me.<br>
<br>
we went after a hero named Kreon.  He zerked and smacked him, I hit him from behind and dropped my DDs. Think King got good crit off, i critted for total damage for 440 + DDs + whatever the damage add was from King's and mine attack. Kreon dropped.  should be noted I killed his druid right before that with the help of an RM, so am pretty sure he was unbuffed.<br>
<br>
Point being, he basically got 2 shot by buffed opponents when he was unbuffed.  yes its possible he had not been fully healed after his group got inchored, But when i hit stick, his health bar was pretty much full.<br>
<br>
and that's what midgard has to look forward too if this patch goes in as is.   Because unless you are fighting the warder and brehon army, the other guy is gonna hit you like a mack truck.<br>
<br>
<br>
Should also be noted my buffed hps went up about 127 since that patch. I can easily break 2k hits now.  Matter of fact, we had a full aug shammy come to tg for part of our raid not so long ago and i am pretty sure i broke 2050 hps after the buffs all sorted out.  I only have aug con 2.  Unbuffed i have 1468 cap hits.  that patch goobered some stuff<br>

One thing I disagree with (and I may be wrong) is that we will have a disadvantage chasing people.  Yes alb, hib groups will move faster b/c mid groups wont have ALL group members on end regen anymore (I think shammys might not end buff casters) OR we will all be end buffed and move as fast as alb/hib but will not be as well buffed.  However, chasing runners shouldnt be too bad.  Twisting bards will be yeah, but most dont know how to twist very well from what Ive seen.  Albs wont be able to flee unless the minstrel and pally are stuck to each other.  Well, I suppose you're right but that one facet isnt quite that dire; we're still screwed though.<br>
<br>
Hmmmm.... seems Mythic to have addressed &quot;overpowered&quot; (yeah right) zerkers and castable end all at once while also making the skald indispensible to a group.  Yay, Im still a taxi.  I fear in response to this Mids will protest and then we will be given a chantable end regen in Mid.  This will likely go to skalds and we'll be labelled as support and fixed all at once.  I fear for the future to be perfectly honest.<br>

buffers get 20 buff slots which is completely different from conc pool.  My shaman (37 aug spec) never gets to fill 20 buff slots because I run out of conc before I hit 20.  Now my shaman is only level 47 but I already had to pick and choose which buffs to put on people and now it is even worse.  Now I have to choose who gets end plus who gets buffs that are left over. <p>Panth</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whorde>whorde</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Contributor</span><br>  Posts: 95<br> <font color=#ff0000>(4/23/03 11:57:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=584.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well</span><hr size=1> i'm going to have to call BS on your numbers.  the only way you can get numbers like that is if the last patch negated the cap from items.  my skald caps str with items at 198 and buffs to 347 if i remember correctly.  you would need to make up 67 points.  15 from creation leaves 52.  aug str 5 leaves 22.<br>

switch in a belt of the dread glow and different ring, adding 20 to str.  As i said, the buff patch borked things.<br>
<br>
Sadly, not sure how to embed my excel file which i generated after testing before patch and post patch.<br>
<br>
But it does have some nifty curves that show you the different aug level buffs and their effectiveness.<br>
<br>
and the sudden change post patch.  I hesitate to call it entirely accurate also, because it shows an exponential increase in benefit from higher and higher levels of aug con and str. but the benefit from aug acuity seems linear.  Which makes no sense.  In any event. as near as i can tell. they aren't even sure what they changed with the buff patch. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://bellsouthpwp.net/d/o/donatea/x/sig-auren.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=amstellight>Amstel Light</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Contributor</span><br>  Posts: 75<br> <font color=#ff0000>(4/23/03 2:08:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=584.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well</span><hr size=1> Are you figuring Lifter into that amount?<br>

Maybe my toon is bugged.   <br>
<br>
I have noticed other display bugs from previous patch till now.  for instance, i have 50 rc runie.  i got a red piety buff that put me at 260 piety.  i then zoned into a dungeon, buffs dropped.  but when i got rebuffed with the same piety buff, it was 307...but my damage on my spells didn't seem different.<br>
<br>
and my rm, a dorf with a beard occasionally shows up with a skull for a face, instead of a face..<br>
<br>
I do know that when we had all 3 str relics i hit cap damage.  I do know that even after we lost all three str relics, when i am fully buffed, i hit cap damage still or very very close to it (BOF excepted) and that NEVER happened before the patch.  And that isn't a display bug or anything similiar.  <br>
<br>
Before patch i would hit druids for maybe 300 damage IF i was lucky.  I hit several lvl 50 druids in SC armor last night for over 400 a pop.<br>
<br>
Out of boredom this week i have dueled couple different zerkers, hunters, a thane, high aug healer and a savage.<br>
<br>
the savage...ehh heh that was just ugly. we won't go there.<br>
the zerkers i won bout 40% of the duels regarless of whether they zerked.<br>
thane beat me (he was shield), healer did really good against me, but waited too long to insta cc me, and i got rear chain off.  hunters as usual depends on how many arrows they get in me, tho Rza, a hunter on our server, beat me in straight melee with no buffs no pet and no bow.<br>
<br>
i repeated the duels with 2 of the zerkers when we were both buffed by same shammy.  I am significantly higher RR.<br>
I won ever duel then.<br>
<br>
To me, thats a indicator that maybe the buff patch borked something. I shouldn't as a skald be able to be a buffed zerker in a duel simply because i'm higher RR (we didn't use active RAs either).<br>
<br>
<br>
none of this addresses the major problem of having our shammies shafted tho. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://bellsouthpwp.net/d/o/donatea/x/sig-auren.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aurensirramalot>AurenSirRamAlot</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/Auren/fullsize/shield.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Contributor</span><br>  Posts: 91<br> <font color=#ff0000>(4/29/03 11:27:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=584.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: why the shammy nerf hurts Skalds.</span><hr size=1> Found out why my str was so out of control with buffs from that guys shammy.<br>
<br>
It has mastery of arcane 4.<br>
<br>
IIRC, that means his best buffs (red ones) will be 12% more effective and that stacks with the increased effectiveness of my realm rank.  Not sure if it stacks before or after it takes effect.<br>
<br>
IE say buff increases str by 90, but RR makes it 100 effective.  does that make it 112 or 110.8? <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://bellsouthpwp.net/d/o/donatea/x/sig-auren.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=johannas98>Johannas 98</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Participant</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#ff0000>(4/30/03 12:47:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=584.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: why the shammy nerf hurts Skalds.</span><hr size=1> Ummm end 4 takes 4 conc points per person full group of 8, that's 32 conc points out of 20 possible. <p>Johannas - 50 Armsman - Guinevere<br>
