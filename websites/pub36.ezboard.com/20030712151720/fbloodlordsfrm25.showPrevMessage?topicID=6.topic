<br>
<br>
The night was cold and damp. A large yellow moon hung over the field like a giant lantern hung in an over-sized tent, casting strange shadows over everything and making the dark places seem alive with un-seen forces.<br>
<br>
Phynix stood silent as she looked out over the blood soaked field. There had been a monstrous war here today, and the stench of blood and death invaded her nose. She could see the bodies of hundreds of dead men strewn across the once lush and beautiful field.<br>
<br>
Her sharp eyes searched her surroundings carefully to make sure she was safe. Phynix didn't hear or see anything so she slowly stood and moved out onto the field. with quiet feet and careful hands she began searching the nearest corpses for any coins that they may still carry. One good thing came of war...it out coin in the pockets of the poor people willing to come out here. Her family had died in a fire a few years ago, so she had been forced to take care of herself ever since. <br>
<br>
She came quickly to her feet as she heard a noise behind her and to the left. She saw a young man sitting astride a horse partially covered in shadow, looking straight at her. She couldn't see him clearly, but he could see her every move. She saw his heavy cloak blow in the breeze, she saw his horse's nostrils flare and it's mighty foot paw the earth impatiently. She saw a glimmer as the ring on the man's left hand caught a glint from moonlight.<br>
<br>
The young man studied her silently. She was very small, maybe 5 foot tall at most, and slender of build. She wore brown leather pants and a woolen tunic. Her long auburn colored hair blew gently in the breeze, almost like the silken curls held life of their own. Her eyes were alert and quick, her mouth was parted slightly and everytime she exhaled a slight poof of mist would shoot out. Her tiny fists were clenched at her sides as she hesitated.<br>
<br>
The yound man on the horse made a motion and a soldier came out of the bushes on her right. He held a sword out towards her and she knew that he meant to kill her. He motioned for her to come to him. Phynix backed away a step. The man with the sword ran towards her with an angry cry on his lips and swinging his sword like a wild man. Phynix stood silently and watched him come. When he was within distance she quickly lifted her leg and kicked him straight in the teeth, snapping his head back violently and ending his pitiful life. <br>
<br>
The man on the horse then moved. knowing she couldn't take down a horse to get to him, phynix turned and fled. She jumped over bodies and tripped over weapons lying in the blood soaked grass. She could hear him gaining on her, the sound of the horse's hooves as they pounded the earth behind her.<br>
<br>
Phynix cried out as he brought his sword hilt down on the back of her head. She sank to her knees and gasped for air. She looked up to her stars but they were too blurry to see anymore. She sank forward to her hands, then lifted one and looked at the mud and blood caked there. The man brought his sword down on her again. This time Phynix fell forward limply. Her last thought as she faded into gracious darkness was....I must survive.....<br>
