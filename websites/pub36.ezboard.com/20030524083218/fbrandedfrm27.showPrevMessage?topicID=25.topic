RALLIC PACK QUEST<br>
---------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Rallic Aristos' <br>
<br>
Rallic Aristos says 'Well met Daias ! I am Rallic Aristos, Governor of trade and economy here in Katta Castellum. I know it sounds like a lot of parchment pushing and coin counting but maintaining good trade relations with the various Houses of Shadow Haven and the haggling Vah Shir of Shar Vahl is not as easy at it may sound. Then there is the issue of the [acrylia mines] in the Tenebrous Mountains. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what acrylia mines?' <br>
<br>
Rallic Aristos says 'The Tenebrous Mountains are rich with veins of the valuable acrylia ore. Unfortunately the mines were dug and controlled by a tribe of savage grimlings from the forests to the south. Negotiations have been attempted with the grimlings but to no avail. Several of the other governors and I have been developing a [plan] to take the mines or establish mines of our own. In either case the mines will have to be defended from attacks by the grimlings unless when placed in that predicament they finally resort to trade negotiations. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what plan?' <br>
<br>
Rallic Aristos says 'The full plans are not at my disposal but one of my concerns that may be instrumental in our success is the acquisition of grimling documents carried by a grimling courier who is seen frequently running from the forest to the mines. If one of the Validus Custodus attempts to obtain the runners pouch the grimlings will surely retaliate, if adventurers like yourselves obtained it however and quietly delivered it to me we may be able to move forward with our plans. <br>
<br>
The grimling runner is found on the southern side of the zone. He drops a pack (LORE) which you turn into Rallic Aristos in Katta. <br>
<br>
He gives you back a pattern. You then combine the Rallic Pattern (LORE), a shade silk thread (2 shadeling silks combined), a shade silk cord (3 shade silk threads combined), and a Perfect owlbear pelt (drops off higher level Owlbears) in a sewing kit to receive your Rallic Pack<br>

Amulet of the Grey Waste Quest<br>
---------------------------------<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Drenic Garrison' <br>
<br>
Drenic Garrison says 'Greetings! I am Drenic Garrison, Governor of Science here in Katta Castellum. I am currently involved in several scientific endeavors with the other governors and am in need of assistance supplying my researchers with the proper [materials and samples] for their studies. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what materials and samples?' <br>
<br>
Drenic Garrison says 'The Magus Conlegium are assisting with some studies on the physiology of the Vampyres of the Coterie of the Eternal Night and are in need of [ash and blood] samples. Maralicis Dilsm our Governor of Health is assisting in research on [counteragents] to the venom and diseases native to Luclin. Finally, there have been reports from the agents of Erikal Wolfeye that there is a civilization of [snake people] that live on the furthest reaches of the light side of Luclin in a region devoid of atmosphere. <br>
<br>
You say, 'snake people?' <br>
<br>
Drenic Garrison says 'To the west beyond the Twilight Sea is an airless <br>
grey region between the light and dark sides of Luclin. Some time ago our  scouts cooperating with powerful members of the Magus Conlegium attempted to chart the expanses of the barren treacherous region. During this excursion the scouts and magi encountered a small group of strange snake like men. The magi detected no magical aid that was allowing the creatures to move freely in the airless void without danger of suffocation. When approached the snake men quickly fled. We wish to know how these creatures survive in such conditions. If they prove to be a hostile species then we will have to resort to examining their [anatomy].<br>
<br>
You say, 'what anatomy?' <br>
<br>
Drenic Garrison says 'I wish to examine the lungs or whatever breathing <br>
organs these creature have. It would not be prudent to hunt and kill a <br>
living member of this species and society we know practically nothing about but there are several undead snake men in the region as well. I will require three such organs however to perform the proper experiments. <br>
<br>
The snakes are Shissar Stalkers. They occasionally drop an organ. Bring back three for your reward. Found in the the Grey. <br>

Bring ya fish scales as there is no air in this zone.<br>

Shield of Bane Warding Quest<br>
--------------------------------<br>
<br>
This is not a soloable quest.  You will need help in several spots to complete this quest.  The initial gathering of items could be done solo.<br>
<br>
Go to Katta Castellum<br>
<br>
Go up to the top of the castle to the main building and walk out on to the red carpet on the first floor turn left and go to Loc (neg 234, pos 161) last door on your right, you will find a NPC named Roshawna Rhorer.<br>
<br>
Hail, Roshawna Rhorer<br>
<br>
A pleasure to speak with you! You appear to be a foreigner to Katta Castellum as well. <br>
I hope your reasons for visiting this noble city are more leisurely than my own. <br>
In addition to my normal duties as a Shar Vahl Emissary to Katta Castellum there is the issue of the [Tormented Vah Shir] in Tenebrous Mountains that must be dealt with. <br>
<br>
What tormented Vah Shir? <br>
<br>
Recently the skeletons of Vah Shir have been spotted wandering the Tenebrous Mountains ferociously and blindly attacking the living.<br>
<br>
<br>
There are legends among my people that speak of Vah Shir warriors that were murdered dishonorably in their sleep by a traitor allied with [dark spirits]. <br>
The spirits of these murdered warriors become trapped in their decaying mortal shells for often many years before they are driven mad by the despair, rage, and torturous experience.<br>
<br>
When this negative spirit energy becomes strong enough the corpses rise and attempt to slaughter all that crosses their path in their state of eternal rage. <br>
Spirits tormented in such a manner must be assisted so that they may finally find peace in death. <br>
Will you [help the souls] find peace?<br>
<br>
What dark spirits? <br>
<br>
Not all spirits that can be called upon by those who are in touch with the spirit realms are of good intentions.<br>
<br>
There are spirits who seek to destroy and corrupt. These dark spirits are best avoided and kept from manifesting their influence on the mortal realms. Unfortunately the foolish or the weak willed are tempted by their promises of power.<br>
<br>
Most who deal with the dark spirits are shortly driven mad by the spirits influence or destroyed by the very powers they were promised.<br>
<br>
There are tales however of powerful shaman capable of harnessing and controlling the dark spirits and their evil powers of corruption. These wicked traitors to the Vah Shir teachings are called [Rakshasa]. <br>
<br>
Who Rakshasa? <br>
<br>
Like I said the Rakshasa are spoken of only in old tales. <br>
Whether they truly existed or not cannot be proven for sure and the elder spiritualist insist they are nothing more than creatures of fiction.<br>
<br>
<br>
If there truly is a Rakshasa alive today it would be a powerful creature indeed. <br>
They are said to no longer have a physical body of their own, having traded it to a powerful evil spirit so that it may enter the mortal realm in exchange for dark gifts. <br>
Because the Rakshasa no longer has a physical body of its own it must take the forms of other creatures and can not be destroyed with conventional weapons. <br>
<br>
I will help the souls <br>
<br>
The only way for a tormented undead Vah Shir to be put to rest is to destroy its body and take its skull to Shar Vahl where our spiritualists can perform a ritual to cleanse and free the imprisoned spirit.<br>
<br>
Fill this chest with skulls and return it to me and I will make the preparations for it to be sent to Shar Vahl.<br>
<br>
The spiritualists there have just recently received word of the situation and will be prepared to perform the proper rituals when the time comes. <br>
<br>
You receive a Runed Iron Bound Chest (8 Slot)<br>
<br>
<br>
You need 8 Tormented Vah Shir Skulls.<br>
<br>
Skulls: Just turn right when you leave the Katta zone line and go to Loc (neg 1265, pos 1774) (Yes clerics you can use sense undead to target them) also the LOC given is a spawn area but all in that area from the back of the tree by the rocks to just in front where the hill starts to slop they can spawn so keep your eyes open. The second spawn area is at pos 303, neg 85.<br>
<br>
Spawn times on the PH are every 6 min. The Mobs do roam so if you miss the pop just wait 30 min and it will reset.<br>
<br>
The 1st Camp is a nice safe camp, no roamers only problem is that sometimes the mobs get stuck in the wall or the tree that is close by and they will despawn. (This was /petitioned and /bug)<br>
<br>
The 2nd Camp is not so nice, it’s out toward the middle of the zone and seems to be the Grand Central Station of the place, you will get lots of green agro at this camp, but if the other one is camped it beats not doing the quest at all.<br>
<br>
Once you get your 8 skulls put them in the Runed Iron Bound Chest, and combine them the chest becomes a Sealed Runed Iron Bound Chest, return it back to Roshwana in Katta.<br>
<br>
Now hand the Sealed Runed Iron Bound Chest to Roshawna Rhorer back in Katta.<br>
<br>
Roshawna Rhorer purrs an incantation and waves her claws back and forth over the chest.<br>
<br>
The runes inscribed on the chest and iron bands begin to softly glow with a golden light. <br>
<br>
'You have done a great service for these poor souls. <br>
I have sent for a courier to come for the chest of skulls but he is quite late in his arrival.<br>
<br>
<br>
I will keep it safe until the courier arrives. <br>
<br>
Your faction standing with Guardians of Shar Vahl got better. <br>
You gain experience!!<br>
<br>
(A Vah Shir courier) <br>
Sorry for the delay mistress, I ran into a spot of trouble on the way here. <br>
I am prepared to deliver your crate to the spiritualists back home.<br>
<br>
 (Roshawna Rhorer) <br>
I hope your journey back to Shar Vahl is less eventful. <br>
Please make haste the spiritualists must receive this crate as soon as possible. <br>
<br>
(A Vah Shir courier) <br>
A Vah Shir courier tucks the crate of skulls under his arm and nods to Roshawna. <br>
Suddenly the courier begins to shake, his fur stands on end, and his eyes glaze over expressionlessly.<br>
<br>
<br>
The courier runs for the gates of Katta Castellum with an otherworldly howl echoing in his wake. <br>
<br>
(Roshawna Rhorer) <br>
Stop him! Stop the courier! <br>
An evil spirit has possessed him! <br>
He must not escape with those skulls! <br>
Catch him and bring back that crate of skulls!<br>
<br>
You must kill the courier in the main great hall.  Otherwise the skeletons will get stuck in the walls.<br>
<br>
&gt;Kill the Vah Shir Courier. (You probably don’t like cats anyway)<br>
<br>
<br>
A Vah Shir courier has been slain by<br>
<br>
<br>
A Vah Shir Cou's corpse slams the crate of skulls against the ground with unnatural force as he falls jarring it open.<br>
<br>
Loot the corpse.<br>
<br>
<br>
With his dying breath the possessed courier mutters a dark incantation and the skulls burst from the chest sprouting new skeletal forms.<br>
<br>
(At this point 8 Reanimated Vah Shir’s will spawn, you have to kill them, you will need a group for this or at least a melee with a chanter or bard and a healer, the Skellys con light blue to level 56.)<br>
<br>
Combine the skulls in the chest and hand them back to Roshawna Rhorer.  <br>
<br>
(Roshawna Rhorer) <br>
It appears this situation is much more dire than we had first presumed. <br>
It would be unsafe to send this crate within the walls of Shar Vahl should another innocent be possessed and the tormented Vah Shir be resurrected once more.<br>
<br>
<br>
I shall scribe a note explaining the occurrences for you to deliver along with the crate to Spiritualist Roleko at the Vah Shir outpost in Grimling Forest.<br>
<br>
Your faction standing with Guardians of Shar Vahl got better. <br>
You gain party experience!!<br>
<br>
<br>
Now head over to the Grimling Forest to Loc (neg 730, neg1000) and you will find Spiritist Roleko. He is easy to find once you zone over from Hollowshade Moor as you exit the cave to your right just down the hill is a Vah Shir Outpost, just go in the gate and turn to your left he’s standing by a big rock at the foot of the hill.<br>
<br>
&gt;Hail Spiritist Roleko<br>
<br>
(Spiritist Roleko)<br>
<br>
Greetings Traveler. If it is rest you seek then I’m sure you may rest safely within the walls of this outpost. As the sentries keep watch for physical danger I commune with the spirits of this territory to watch for less noticeable threats.<br>
<br>
<br>
(You hand Spiritist Roleko the box and the note) <br>

(Spiritist Roleko)<br>
It was wise of Roshawna to send you to me instead of risk bringing something so tainted by the dark spirits within the walls of Shar Vahl.<br>
<br>
<br>
I shall begin the ritual immediately.<br>
<br>
What is that?! Look! There is a Grimling heading this way followed by what appear to be Grimling undead.<br>
<br>
Defend me while I perform the ritual.<br>
<br>
(Kill a possessed Grimling, loot its head (Yeah the greasy smelly ugly thing on his shoulders). Kill 3 Reanimated Grimling Skeletons, loot the skulls from them... give the stuff you just looted to Spiritist Roleko.<br>
<br>
Give me the head of that grimling and the skulls of those undead!<br>
<br>
Your faction standing with Dar Khura got better. <br>
You gain party experience!!<br>
<br>
(Spiritist Roleko) <br>
I am grateful for your assistance. <br>
I will be able to complete the rest of the ritual without danger the spirits in the skulls have been calmed.<br>
<br>
Please take this report of occurrences to Spiritist Cholsa in Shar Vahl.<br>
<br>
Your faction standing with Dar Khura got better.<br>
<br>
Run to Shar Vahl to do a turn in to a &quot; Spiritist Cholsa&quot; the text is incorrect in game, you are looking for Scribe Cholsa, (I will use the correct name from here on) she is in the shammy guild in Shar Vahl with the other spiritualists. Enter the Palace and turn right take the stairs going down, open the first door and turn right, open the door on your right and enter the room she is on the right hand side at Loc (pos 80, pos 145).<br>
<br>
Hand the report to Spiritualist Cholsa (Scribe Cholsa)<br>
<br>
(Scribe Cholsa) <br>
So it seems there is more truth to the legends of the Rakshasa than is commonly believed. <br>
I recall much of the tales of the wicked shaman who sold their souls and bodies to the dark spirits. <br>
There is a ritual that must be performed to force the Rakshasa to fully materialize in our realm so that it may be slain.<br>
<br>
I will write down the instructions for the ritual but the [components] I'm afraid may be difficult to obtain.<br>
<br>
Your faction standing with Dar Khura got better. <br>
You gain experience!! <br>
<br>
&gt;What is components?<br>
<br>
(Scribe Cholsa)<br>
The legends instruct that the ritual requires an Amulet of Golden Rays crafted by a worshiper of the sun, Charcoal that burns with a Black Flame, and the Brain of a creature that can Leech the Thoughts of others.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you manage to procure these items please take them with the instructions I have provided to Spiritualist Roleko at the Grimling Forest Outpost. <br>
<br>
The Rakshasa shall be summoned and slain there away from the citizens of Shar Vahl.<br>
<br>
Ok now we are off to find 3 more items, it does not matter what order you do them.<br>
<br>
The Amulet of Golden Rays come from deep in the Scarlet Desert, at Loc (pos 570, neg 740), it is a rare spawn off of the Burning Priest he has a PH every 32 minutes but the upside here is that the Revenants are awesome exp. You can not kite these mobs, you’re going to have to get melee here for this. (The Burning Priest is a Cleric he will Complete Heal)<br>
<br>
Black Flame Charcoal comes from the Umbrous Toilers in ME, it is a rare drop.<br>
<br>
Thought Leech Brain from a Thought Leech in the Thought Leech Cave in Mons Letalis, a rare drop. The LOC for the Thought Leech cave is Loc (neg 1029, pos 36).<br>
<br>
Now run your little feet back to Spiritist Roleko in the Vah Shir outpost in the Grimling Forest <br>
at Loc (neg 730, neg1000) and hand him your 4 items. (Thought Leech Brain, Black Flame Charcoal, Amulet of Golden Rays &amp; Rakshasa Materialization Ritual)<br>
<br>
(Spiritist Roleko) <br>
Scribe Cholsa prepares the ritual components according to the ritual instructions. <br>
<br>
'I will need to maintain my concentration to keep the Rakshasa from escaping back into the spirit realm. <br>
If you kill him while he is materialized he will be slain and his body will remain material. <br>
Bring me the head of the Rakshasa when he is slain.'<br>
<br>
Your faction standing with Dar Khura got better. (Like we really care) <br>
<br>
(Rakshasa Karwoaro) <br>
Haha haha. You cannot defeat that which is not of this realm of existence! <br>
I shall slay your feeble meat shells for your audacity of summoning me here! <br>
<br>
Rakshasa will spawn he is approximately level 51, he is a shaman of course, and unstunnable, and unsnareable , but he can be slowed. Loot his head and give it to Spiritualist Roleko “after” you kill him (just put that “after” in there for those of you thinking that he’s just going to hand it to you) for the shield.<br>
<br>
Rakshasa Karwoaro has been slain by<br>
Your faction standing with Order of Autarkic Umbrage got worse. <br>
Your faction standing with Coterie of the Eternal Night got worse. <br>
Your faction standing with Valdanov Zevfeer got worse. <br>
Your faction standing with Akheva got better. <br>
Your faction standing with Shak Dratha got better. <br>
You gain party experience!! <br>
<br>
Rakshasa Karwo says 'I shall have my revenge! I swear it!!<br>
<br>
Give the head to Spiritualist Roleko<br>
<br>
(Spiritist Roleko) <br>
The threat of the Rakshasa appears to be eliminated. <br>
You have the gratitude of the Dar Khura for your bravery and assistance. <br>
Let us be wary however, the Rakshasa gained his power by allying with dark spirits that may not be indifferent to the Rakshasas death. <br>

Rowle Shieldson says 'Sure'n this one came from Norrath, eh Tack? One wonders if'n a bottle o' one on o' the finer things in life might be in our future, if we were to ask politely? <br>
<br>
Tack Shieldson says 'Yar, Rowle. So whadda ye say? We stand around drinkin' water on duty all day, and that ain't no life fer a dwarf. Now we bin hearin' bout all these new ales and suchnot comin' up from Norrath. Ye think ye might be so kind as to share a pint and raise our spirits? <br>

Rowle Shieldson says 'That'd be great! By Brell, a short beer or a honey mead'd be a nice change from? <br>
<br>
Tack Shieldson says, 'Shhhhhh!!' He runs over and kicks Rowle in the kneecap and chuckles under his beard in your direction. Speaking under his breath to Rowle, 'Don' be such an idjit, now this lad came all the way from Norrath, why not try some of the fabled ales we'd heard our pappy's talkin' of?' <br>
<br>
(Subtlety is not the strength of the dwarven race) <br>

Rowle Shieldson catches on slowly, 'ahhh, roight! Good show, Tack! D'ye think 'e would go te that kinda trouble fer us?' <br>

My thanks to ye in advance.<br>
<br>
You are rewarded with positive faction in Katta and negative faction in Seru. Would assume there is a similiar Quest in Seru for the opposite faction.<br>

Acrylia Phosphate Quest -or- Phosphorous Torch Quest<br>

<br>
You say, 'Hail, Triblix Tikbok' <br>

Triblix Tikbok says 'Pleasure to meet ya! Have you come to the Illuminarium Industria to gaggle about or have you come looking for [some work]? <br>
<br>
You say, 'I have come looking for some work' <br>
<br>
Triblix Tikbok says 'Well in that case I sure could use the assistance of a powerful Barbarian such as yourself. You see my job here is to construct the lighting for Katta Castellum and I'm always in need of more supplies. I need a fresh supply of [zelniak oil] for the standard city street lanterns and a fresh supply of [acrylia phosphate] to construct more phosphorous lanterns and torches. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what acrylia phosphate' <br>
<br>
Triblix Tikbok says 'Acrylia Phosphate is an uncommon mineral deposit containing the same mineral compound that provides acrylia ore with its self luminescence. The acrylia phosphate also burns very well and at extremely high temperatures for very long periods of time. I will trade with you for every four piles of acrylia phosphate you can supply to me.<br>
<br>
This is a strange reward.  If you are not fighting vampires, it is an almost useless weapon.  But if you are fighting Vampires (Coterie) you have a fairly decent weapon.<br>
