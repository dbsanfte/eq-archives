Much more information and testing is needed at several places. Please give me your comments. Comments from other players are listed separately from my own analysis.<br>
<br>
Since I first wrote this guide, I have leveled my skald from 35 to 50, and RvRed a little. I also paid close attention to testing work that has been done and posted on the boards. As a result, there are some significant changes to this write-up.<br>
<br>
Increasing damage<br>
The most significant change is that I no longer advocate the damage adding abilities. This is liable to be highly controversial, so here are my reasons. Before I start, let me admit that I think Skalds should strive to increase damage whenever possible. Skalds hit hard, and front-load a lot of damage, but can not take hits all that well. I would rather increase damage than anything else, all other things being equal. However, that is the problem - they are not.<br>
<br>
A skald derives his damage from normal weapon damage, weapon style damage, the damage add chant, and the DD spells. The ratio of these three probably varies with player and situation. I did no studies, but let's approximate the ratios as 25% weapon damage, 25% style damage, 20% damage add, 30% DD shout. Each of the damage adding abilities only affects one or two of these areas.<br>
<br>
For example: take Augmented Acuity.  A 6 point increase in charisma, results in the shout DD increasing by about 2.5%. Shouts are only about 30% of your total damage, so your total damage increases by about 0.75%. Compare that to a defensive skill: If you put a point in toughness, you get a total hit point increase of 3%.<br>
<br>
In my mind (even though I prefer adding to your offense) a 3% increase in total hits is better than a 0.75% increase in total damage.<br>
<br>
Augmented Strength<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability that increases your strength by 6 each level. Cost per level is 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. Level 3 is required for Mastery of Arms.<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
Can someone run tests to determine the effect of strength on weapon damage and weapon style damage? Until I get that information, we can not look at this RA. Probably good to add 1 here, because strength is the damage determining stat for a skald.<br>
<br>
Augmented Dexterity<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability that increases your dexterity by 6 each level. Cost per level is 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. Level 2 is required for Mastery of Blocking, Mastery of Parrying, Mastery of Pain.<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
Dexterity affects your chance to block and parry. If you have 17 or more into parry, this may be a viable choice to take to level 2 where you can move to Master of Parrying, and also Mastery of Pain.<br>
<br>
Augmented Constitution<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability that increases your constitution by 6 each level. Cost per level is 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. Level 3 is required for Avoid Pain, Armor of Faith, Second Wind.<br>
<br>
Testing<br>
At level 50, it is reported that you get about 20 points per level of this skill by friars. A level 50 skald confirms that figure.<br>
<br>
Comments<br>
&quot;Wasted point. Would have been better off putting it in Toughness. And Toughness is a wasted point.&quot;<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
I don't think this is a wasted point. My 50 skald's unbuffed hitpoints are close to 1300. A 20 point increase is 1.5% (buffed increase will be less - need to test.) for one point. Not the first priority - but a point seems a sure thing.<br>
<br>
Augmented Quickness<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability that increases your quickness by 6 each level. Cost per level is 1, 3, 6, 10, 14.<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
From the hunter FAQ: &quot;... it takes 5 points of QUI for an exactly 1% reduction off the weapon's delay.&quot; Augmented quickness will give you approximately 1.2% reduction in delay, which increases your weapon's damage 1.2% It does not increase your weapon style damage, though, because that is figured as a constant DPS adder. The increase in total damage for 1 level in augmented quickness is then: 1.2% * 25% = 0.3%. increase in overall damage. A 0.3% increase is probably not worth it.<br>
<br>
Quickness has an effect on evade ability, though, so possibly it could get a point late in my career.<br>
<br>
Augmented Acuity<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability that increases your charisma by 6 each level. Cost per level is 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. Level 2 is required for Serenity, Mastery of the Arcane.<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
Based on the work by Roseanne (<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm13.showMessage?topicID=10.topic)">pub36.ezboard.com/fteamsk...=10.topic)</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> I approximate the DD increase as 2.5% for a 6 point increase in charisma. The increase in total damage for 1 level in Augmented Acuity is then: 2.5% * 30% = 0.75% increase in overall damage.<br>
<br>
A 0.75% increase in overall damage for one point is pretty good later in the realm rank tree. Probably put one point here.<br>
<br>
Long Wind<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability: Your character can sprint for a longer period of time than normal. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14.<br>
<br>
Testing<br>
Friar test show 20 seconds of sprinting with no Long wind. 25 at level 1, 35 at level 2, 54 at long wind 3.<br>
Another person said: I have Longwind II and Tireless II and I can run forever. I think others have said this is not true, though.<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
Don't think I will spend here.<br>
<br>
Tireless<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability: Your character regenerates endurance in combat. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14.<br>
<br>
Comments<br>
&quot;I have tireless 2, in combat it regens slightly, I get about 1 extra styled attack than I used to. From absolutely no endurance...13 seconds sitting down gets me a full green bar.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Tireless, even as low as at level 1 is priceless. The amount regenerated is not huge, but the real advantage of the skill is that its allow you to regenerate stamina (albeit at a slow rate) in circumstances when you normally don't regenerate AT ALL, namely fighting and especially running. So when travelling, running all over Briefine and Emain, you slowly refresh your stamina pool, almost reducing to zero (with purity of mind and heals available) the time you have to spend sitting, in an environment when you are vulnerable to stealth attacks and need moving quickly.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I ran from huginfel to Yggdra gate at Warrior speed and had only regained half my endurance.. thats close to a 5min run.&quot;<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
I think a point here could help skalds. When it's time to get out of dodge, sprint away until your speed song kicks in and then let your end regenerate on the run. If you travel with a shaman all the time then forget it, and use their buff. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Regeneration<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability: Your hit points regenerate faster than normal. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14.<br>
<br>
Testing<br>
Reports say it reduces time to regenerate by about 10% per level. Only works while sitting.<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
Since it only works while sitting, not a help in combat. Not worth it.<br>
<br>
Serenity<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability: Your spell points regenerate faster than normal. Requires Augmented Acuity level 2. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14.<br>
<br>
Comments<br>
&quot;I originally had Serenity II and it was great and helped alot. Though when I got MCL the use of Serenity was pretty non-existent. With just one level of MCL I rarely run out of power.&quot;<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
Probably not worth it.<br>
<br>
Toughness<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability: Increases maximum hit points by 3% per level of this ability. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14.<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
I go against the grain on this one. A 3% increase in overall damage rocks for only one point. This is a no brainer.<br>
<br>
Mastery of Water<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability: Increases swim speed by 3% per level of this ability. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14.<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
I have seen a friend use it (he bought it when Mythic said they were going to wipe the abilities) to great effect in the BGs where people are crossing the moat. I don?t think it is very useful in real RvR though.<br>
<br>
Avoidance of Magic<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability: Increases resistance to all damage types of magic by 3% per level of this ability. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14.<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
This appears to work with mezzes. I believe that magic resistance might be one of those doubly-important stats. It might increase the chance for an outright resist, and also reduce the effect for those spells that stick (this should be tested.) <br>
<br>
There are 6 different magic resistances, and they are all increased 3%. To me, this is a no brainer. If 60% of your damage comes from magic, this reduces your overall damage by 1.8% - maybe 3.6% if resistances count twice.<br>
<br>
Lifter<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability: 20% additional maximum carrying capacity per level. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14.<br>
<br>
Comments<br>
&quot;I know of a low 40ish troll thane who could carry an entire ram by himself with lifter 1. What needs to be tested : can a level 50 skald with a typical strength attribute be able to do the same thing with lifter 1. If the answer is yes, this ability is definitely worthwhile. Good RA for craftmen too.&quot;<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
I don't think so. Maybe if you need to carry ram parts.<br>
<br>
Veil Recovery<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability: Reduces duration of resurrection sickness by 10% per level. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14.<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
This seems pretty worthless. At ten points, you can reduce the duration of rez sickness by 30%, or get purge and reduce it to zero every 30 minutes (with other bonuses.)<br>
<br>
Mastery of Blocking<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability: Increases chance to block by 3% per level. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. Requires: Augmented Dexterity at level 2.<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
Does not seem to me as good as Mastery of Parrying. You can parry with a one-handed or two-handed weapon, plus you can spec parrying.<br>
<br>
Mastery of Parrying<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability: Increases chance to parry by 3% per level. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. Requires: Augmented Dexterity at level 2.<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
You can parry with a one-handed or two-handed weapon, plus you can spec parrying. If you take 40% of your damage from melee, and you spec parry to 17, then your chance to parry moves from 13% to 16%, and your overall damage is reduced 0.40 * (1- .84/.87) = 1.4% a pretty good reduction for one point.<br>
<br>
Mastery of Pain<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability: Increases chance to critical with melee attacks by 5% per level. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. Requires: Augmented Dexterity at level 2.<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
Increases chance to critical with melee attacks by 5% per level. I have heard that critical hits range from 1-50% of weapon damage, but am unsure if this means total weapon damage, or unstyled weapon damage. Let's assume that it is total. The increase in total damage for 1 level in Mastery of Pain is then: 5% * ((1% + 50%) / 2) * 50% = 0.75% increase in overall damage.<br>
<br>
That is not all that good, and it's worse if the critical damage is not effected by styles.<br>
<br>
Mastery of Arms<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability: Additional 3% per level attack speed with melee weapons. Please note that the minimum allowed combat attack timer is 1.5 seconds - this ability will not allow you to go below this hard cap. It will, however, reduce the attack speed of slower weapons, which do more damage per hit. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. Requires: Augmented Strength at level 3.<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
As was the case with Augmented Quickness, the weapon style damage is not increased. The increase in total damage for 1 level in Mastery of Arms is then: 3% * 25% = 0.75%. increase in overall damage.<br>
<br>
Not as good as the defensive stats.<br>
<br>
Mastery of the Arcane<br>
<br>
Description<br>
A passive ability: Your buff spells will be 3% more effective per level of this ability. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. Requires: Augmented Acuity at level 2.<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
This is said to result in a small run speed increase but not affect any other of our buffs. Not worth it.<br>
<br>
First Aid<br>
<br>
Description<br>
<br>
An active ability on a 15 minute timer: Self heal that heals approximately 30% hit points per level gained in the ability. It cannot be used in combat. Please note that this ability will heal a different amount of hit points based on what class your character is. Cost per level is: 3, 6, 10. Required for Ignore Pain.<br>
<br>
Comments<br>
&quot;I get around 200 healing with FA 1 ... Not too bad at all. Maybe not completely worth it by itself, but definitely a good prerequ for ignore pain.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;LOVE IT! Even @ level 1, I got about 400 HP restored, unbuffed, @ level 2, it's more like 800 Unbuffed... Can't wait to get Ignore Pain...&quot;<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
The 15-minute timer is not too bad, but it cannot be used in combat. However, if you leave combat, it is a very short time before you can use it even while being hit. Also, if you mez and drop out of combat, you can use it. This makes it nice for a Skald. If you solo a lot, a great way to reduce downtime. Somewhat useful when rezzed in RvR. Finally, it is the prerequisite to Ignore Pain, so it gets points to level 2.<br>
<br>
Avoid Pain<br>
<br>
Description<br>
An active abiltity on a 15 minute timer: 60 second boost to physical damage absorption, 10% per level per level of this ability. Cost per level is: 3, 6, 10. Requires: Augmented Constitution at level 3.<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
<br>
I need testing on this one. Absorption is supposed to reduce the chance you are hit - not the damage you take when you are hit.<br>
<br>
Armor of Faith<br>
<br>
Description<br>
An active abiltity on a 15 minute timer: 60 second 150 boost to armor factor. Cost per level is: 3, 6, 10. Requires: Augmented Constitution at level 3.<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
I have heard this skill is broken and worthless at this time.<br>
<br>
Second Wind<br>
<br>
Description<br>
An active abiltity on a 15 minute timer: Completely restores your character's endurance. Cost is 10. Requires: Augmented Constitution at level 3.<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
15 minutes is not too bad a timer. Completely restoring endurance could save me many times. Expensive, though, because you need to spend 10 points on Augmented Constitution first. I am thinking about this one.<br>
<br>
Ignore Pain<br>
<br>
Description<br>
An active abiltity on a 30 minute timer: Self heal that heals all your hit points (I guess the web site has been wrong on this), and can be used in combat. Cost: 14. Requires: First Aid at level 2.<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
This is a nice-looking skill. The 30-minute timer is long and the cost is high, but what a get-out-of-jail card. The realm ability to get second (after purge.)<br>
<br>
Rain of Fire, Rain of Ice, Rain of Annihilation<br>
<br>
Description<br>
An active abiltity on a 15 minute timer: Adds a 10% per level heat/cold/spirit damage-add to non-magical attacks for 60 seconds. Cost per level is: 3, 6, 10.<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
Despite the documentation, these do not actually add 10% damage, but rather appears to be a constant DPS add. For a 50 Warden, damage add was about 13 with a 4.0 speed weapon. The three &quot;Rains&quot; do not appear to stack with each other.<br>
<br>
Not worth it.<br>
<br>
The Empty Mind<br>
<br>
Description<br>
An active abiltity on a 30 minute timer: 10% per level boost to all magic resistances for 60 seconds. Cost per level is: 6, 10, 14.<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
I am not sure about this one. I think 10% boost for 2 minutes an hour is not enough to spend 6 points on.<br>
<br>
Mystic Crystal Lore<br>
<br>
Description<br>
An active abiltity on a 5 minute timer: Self-only boost to power, not usable in combat. Cost per level is: 3, 6, 10. Required for Raging Power.<br>
<br>
Comments<br>
It is reported that the first level adds about 20% to your power. One report says the second level adds 70%. Comments from users are uniformly very positive. Most say that it should be the first points spent.<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
The 5-minute timer is not too bad. Getting your power from 0% to 20% can really cut your downtime. (Power regenerates the slowest when below 50%.) This one looks like a possibility.<br>
<br>
I have seen one person that says forget this one and use totems instead. I will look into that.<br>
<br>
Raging Power<br>
<br>
Description<br>
An active abiltity on a 30 minute timer: Full power heal, usable in combat. Cost is 10. Requires: Mystic Crystal Lore at level 2.<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
Not sure how important this is for a Skald. Our DD spells are on a timer. Resetting our power to 100% is nice, but won't turn a fight. I don't think that I will be taking this one.<br>
<br>
Purge<br>

An active abiltity on a 30 minute timer: Dispel all negative spell effects from your character, such as rez sickness, DOTs, poisons, mesmerization, stun, etc. Cost is 10.<br>
<br>
Comments<br>
&quot;Except for a healer there is no use for any other class to use Purge since what is the use of being the only one not mezzed against a whole group? it might be ok for solo rvr but most of us except stealther are doing more group related rvr then head to head, right?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Many times when our battleline gets pushed through, and we have to retreat, I have been mezzed. As the large wave approaches, I purge and continue running away! If I hadn't had purge, I'd have died 3 times the last time I went RvRing...&quot; &quot;Everytime I see purge criticized, it always come down to the CC argument (BUT what if I am the only one un-mezzed ? BUT what if I get mezzed againt ?). Yes purge is primarily a tool against crowd control, but not only. It can get rid of all negative effects. Not a skald issue, but caster and archers complaining about nearsight ? purge away. Nasty cabalist AA AE-DoT ? purge. New 1.51 patch &quot;uber&quot;-DoTs ? purge. Poisoned by a rogue, slowly dying ? purge. Rezzed on the battlefield, battle still rages, you can't do anything due to rez effects ? purge. Champion think he can duel you and dumps a stack of debuffs on your head ? purge. Diseased, can't run, trouble to be healed ? purge. Rogue, LW champ, shield melee slammed you with their long duration stuns ? purge.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sure the timer is a bit long, but it is one of the most versatile &quot;get out of the jail free&quot; AA. 30 minutes may seem a bit much, but it takes that long to release, get back to Svasud and wait for the Gothis ...&quot;<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
Some don't like it and have not bought it. Others have bought it and like it. My thoughts: the first realm ability you should get.<br>

Description<br>
An active abiltity on a 30 minute timer: A group damage-add spell that lasts for 30 seconds and stacks on top of other damage-add effects. This ability is percent-based, so its damage goes up with the user's level. Does not stack with Triple Wield or Rain of Fire/Ice/Annihilation. Cost is 14.<br>
<br>
Testing<br>
How much damage does it add?<br>
<br>
Comments<br>
&quot;I did try our Unique realm ability at the first time it came out and lets just say if it only cost 3 points, I would still not waste the 3 points.. heck I probably wouldn't waste 1 point on it. It lasts very short of time and can only be used every 30 minutes. When i used it with my 2hd sword it did about as much damage as my regular damage add for maybe 4 swings which added up to about 100 damage at level 41 (something like that).&quot;<br>

For this guide I assume that the skald takes 60% of his damage from spells, and 40% from melee. I also assume that he deals his damage as follows: 25% weapon damage, 25% style damage, 20% damage add, 30% DD shout.<br>

<br>
Your point that each offensive RA only affects one type of attack is a good one. If 3% more hit points keeps you alive 3% longer, then that's 3% more offense you can use (in theory).<br>
<br>
One complication, though, is that offense is &quot;chunky&quot; and hit points are not. For example, if MoP gets you an extra crit once in a while, the value of that single crit will likely be more damage points than the 3% increase in hit points from toughness. Some fights that crit will make the difference, and others it won't matter.<br>
<br>
The 3% extra hit points, though, seem to only come into play if you are lucky enough to take a hit within that 3% window. If you are being hit for 300 a shot and you get +30 hit points, most of the time you won't live any longer; the same number of shots will still kill you unless the last one (before you die) happens to be just over your former hit points but less than your new total.  Of course, for those times that you live for one more shot, you likely get another attack in return, so maybe it's a moot point.<br>
<br>
Regardless, even if offense = defense, then it seems better to gather up several of the 1-point offense &amp; defense RA's before getting the second level of any of them. That second 3% of hit points costs 1% per realm point, and you can get MoP, Aug Acuity and something else for the same investment.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, it's all very complex; these are just my ponderings of the moment.   :-)   Thanks for your detailed analysis!<br>

No - hit points are chunky too. Let's say you are in a fight and down to 15% health with your opponent at 90%. Things are looking bad. You get hit and die.<br>
<br>
If you had 20 more hit point, you would have lived one more swing. Maybe nothing would happen - maybe your mez would recycle. Maybe a realm mate would heal you or stun your opponent. My point is not that 20 hit points is so wonderful, but that the effect is &quot;chunky&quot; also.

Good point. With all this chunkiness, we should petition for a &quot;salsa&quot; RA and be done with it. :-)<br>
<br>
As for &quot;you hit a lot more than you get hit,&quot; I'm struggling with this assertion as well. At first my reaction was &quot;well, I'm always attacking, but only sometimes is someone fighting back.&quot; But then I realized the opposite is also true -- sometimes I am simply being attacked, because I am stunned or rooted, fighting multiple opponents, caught by a stealther, etc.<br>
<br>
Especially when hit points are a &quot;universal&quot; defense and offensive RA's are split (melee/spell), the defensive bonus seems to be at least as good as more offense. After all (as mbolme points out), just as with a few extra hit points, most of the time that extra crit or few points of DD make no difference. Occasionally you will get lucky and get the kill one hit earlier, just as with more hit points you will occasionally live one hit longer.<br>
<br>
I welcome more discussion on the superiority of offense vs. defense, because the closer I look the less obvious it seems. I can certainly see how offense can be more &quot;fun&quot; and visible, in the form of crits and extra damage that you can see as it happens -- but in terms of math, I don't yet see how offense is inherently better.<br>

Yes but it is not always *you* . Us &quot;overpowered&quot; skalds are rarely the first targets. Our enemies tries to disable healers/runies/spiritmasters first, they are the prime targets, not us. A typical melee class attacks more than he is hit imho.<br>
<br>
However, this is not the real problem with defensive skills in RvR.<br>
<br>
Parry only work on frontal attacks. In your standard confused RvR melee (not in duels of course), attacks come from the flanks and the rear as often as from the front.<br>

Maybe - I'm not convinced, though. It seems to me that melee's big complaint is that they are hit more than they hit. Hence, the price reduction for purge and ignore pain and the need for melee balance. Skalds do get to pick their targets more, so maybe they do have an edge. If so, though, my guess it that it is a smaller edge than you might think.<br>

Good point on parry. I am often able to work it so I am one-on-one in melee, but if not, there is a penalty to parry and block. (Not toughness or Aug Con, though.) I will have to decide how much the penalty should be. In addition, I need to penalize parry and block because they do not work on magical attacks. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kjeld>Kjeld</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Fervent</span><br>  Posts: 128<br> <font color=#ff0000>(10/24/02 12:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=366.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hmm</span><hr size=1> Maybe - I'm not convinced, though.

What I mean is &quot;beeing on the receiving end of a melee attack, sucessful or not&quot;. <br>
<br>
The price reduction for purge and IP aim was more about reducing melee vulnerability to magical attack imho.<br>
<br>
I'll try to explain my math a little better.<br>
<br>
Imagine a 8 vs 8 group, with, in both group, 4 melee class and 4 casters. Assuming any enemy meleer will have an equal chance of attacking any opponent, regardless of his class and that there is no 2vs1 battle, you will be attacking someone (caster or melee, regardless) in melee 100% of the time (of course), but there is only 50% chance you'll be attacked by an enemy melee class initally.<br>
<br>
Well, my example is oversimplified , but the fact is melees attack targets are spread between meleers and casters. A melee is still attacking everytime, yet he is not always the victim of another's melee attack.<br>
<br>
----<br>
Mathematically impossible. :P For every person hitting someone in RvR, there is a person being hit.<br>
----<br>
Not accurate : for every melee hitting someone in RvR, there is a melee OR caster being hit<br>
<br>
Remember, parry help you avoid *melee* attack only. *weapon skill* help you hit anyone, melee or magician.<br>
<br>
Parry only work when you are facing the enemy attacking you. Your have a penalty on your parry skill when attacking by multiple opponents. You have a penalty on your parry skill when your opponent use a 2 handed weapon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=moztli>Moztli</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Participant</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#ff0000>(10/24/02 12:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=366.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmm</span><hr size=1> I completely concur that parry, blocking, and even the magic resistance boost are situational defenses.

I think we have come to agreement then. My assumption is that you get 60% of your damage through magic and 40% through melee. This means you are getting hit roughly 1/2 as much as you are hitting. However, you are still taking about a point of damage for every point you dish out.<br>
<br>
Here is my rewritten analysis on parry:<br>
<br>
Analysis<br>
You can parry with a one-handed or two-handed weapon, plus you can spec parrying. If you take 40% of your damage from melee, you need to adjust parry to account for that. However, parry needs to be adjusted further, because the chance to parry is halved against two-handed weapons, divided by the number of opponents attacking you, and is ineffective when meleed from behind. I am going to adjust by 0.67 (say 2/3 melee are two-handed) * .75 (multiple opponent adjustment) = 50%. If you spec parry to 17, then your chance to parry moves from 13% to 16%, and your overall damage is reduced 0.50 (parry adjust) * 0.40 (melee adjust) * (1- .84/.87) = 0.7%.<br>

<br>
marginally worthwhile<br>
<br>

Mastery of Parrying - defense?  get at rank 10<br>
Avoid Pain - get at rank 9<br>
<br>
useful<br>
<br>
Augmented Dexterity - prereq for mastery of pain<br>
Augmented Constitution - get 1 pt<br>
Long Wind - get 1 pt or shamans wont let you in group<br>
Toughness - get 1 point<br>
Avoidance of Magic - 1 or 2 points mandatory, more no good<br>
Lifter - get 1 point<br>
Mastery of Pain - get this after purge / IP, it's good<br>
First Aid - need for IP, good in and of it'sself<br>
<br>
uber<br>
<br>
Ignore Pain - do over hohoho!<br>
Mystic Crystal Lore - this is a skald's best first 3 pts spent<br>
<br>
better than uber<br>
<br>
Purge - like a supp RM, there are a lot of things you need to be doing in a fight which can directly determine the outcome.  you cannot be mezd.  if you know how to play your skald, you not being mezd increases your group's chance to live dramatically.  EVERY SKALD SHOULD HAVE THIS.  if you do not think this RA is mandatory, then you do not understand how to play your skald to it's maximum effectiveness.  <br>
<br>
<br>
ok, that's it.  %s i dont view as particularly credible when judging if something is useful or not.  use the RAs.  see if they're good or if they suck.  then you can judge what is really valuable.<br>

<br>
this is how nearly all rvr encounters begin.  either you sneak up on the bad guys and aoe mez them or they do it to you.<br>
<br>
now say you have one of the rare RvR healers who actually has enough rps for both perfect recovery (which they get before purge) and purge, so the healer purges the mez.  as soon as the healer starts to cast anything, what is going to happen?  all 8 enemies go right for the healer.<br>
<br>
how do you get 8 enemies off your healer?  personally i mez one, snare one, attack one caster, and interrupt another caster with DDs.  or two casters with DDs.  the instant you interrupt them i have never once found a caster who keeps nuking your healer, they always turn to you.<br>
<br>
so i can quite easily get 4 or maybe 5 attackers off the healer.  <br>
<br>
other than a healer, a skald has more ability to turn the tide of an encounter than any other character in the game.  a skald can stop 5.  champions can stop 3, bards can stop 4, minstrels can stop 4, skalds can stop 5.<br>
<br>

A couple disagreements, though:<br>
<br>
worse than worthless:<br>
<br>
Augmented Quickness: No - I have seen pretty conclusive tests that it raises it. Do you have logs that show otherwise? If not, I move this up to: marginally worthwhile<br>
<br>
useful<br>
<br>
Augmented Dexterity: Here is where the % that I have looked at tell the tale I think. MoP just isn't that good. Move down to marginally worthwhile<br>
Augmented Constitution: I say get two points.<br>
Toughness: I say get two points<br>
Avoidance of Magic: I say get two points<br>
Lifter: I could maybe see this - why do you like it?<br>
Mastery of Pain: Why do you think this is good? Only adds a very small % to your damage and requires Aug Dex. Move down to marginally worthwhile.<br>
<br>
uber<br>
<br>
Mystic Crystal Lore: Not sure on this - I have to try the bounty items first.<br>
<br>
as you can see, we are very close. I look forward to your comments on my differences. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whorde>whorde</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Contributor</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#ff0000>(10/27/02 12:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=366.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Skald Realm Abilities</span><hr size=1> gisborne -<br>
<br>
rvr much?  i'm almost rank 6,2 and that's with mainly leveling alts the last 2 months.  the scenerio i describe is what happens not only routinely, but constantly.  75% of your fights will be against inexperienced rvr opponents who will react in extremely predictable ways.  if you play your skald well you WILL routinely turn losses into wins - IF you're not mezd.  purge is priority #3 for a skald behind mcl1 and fa1 which are your main downtime reducers while you're still little enough to be exping.<br>
<br>
everyone goes on and on and on about 30 minutes being sooooo long a timer.  that's crap.  i use my active RAs on average every other fight.  there is a lot of downtime in rvr, that's just how it is.  <br>
<br>
people get confused because it is tear your hair frustrating when your active RAs are down and you need them, then you see it print on your screen &quot;you cannot use this ability for 58 more seconds&quot; and you shout obscenities at your monitor.  that is what everyone remembers about them.  it does not burn in your memory how for the 8 millionth time you purged the stun from that stupid cleric or hib caster and proceeded to whup their ass.<br>
<br>
mbolme -<br>
<br>
as in another post here of logs, as a skald you're very rarely going to sit and pound away on someone.  unless they've got bof lol.  the rest of the time you're either getting your ass kicked or you and your 2 zerker buddies are destroying everyting in your path.  your optimal #age over the long run is irrelevant when you're getting at most 2 hits on any particular target.<br>
<br>
aug quickness lowers your damage per swing.  i'ts not like celerity.  i dont care if by the 3rd swing im' getting it 1/10th of a second faster than i would with less quickness, cuz the vast majority of the people i attack are dead before then.  either that or i'm going to die and it really doesn't matter if i get in a third swing or not they're going to live.  i need to kill them absolutely as quickly as possible so i can move on to the next target.  which means as strong a second swing as possible.  a lighter swing sooner is not as good  of course we're only talking about hundredths of a second here with 1 pt of aug quick.  regardless, there are SO MANY things that are better than this that i do not see any conceivable way to justify spending points on it.<br>
<br>
aug dex, and then mop, are a very similar idea.  if i got aug str instead, then yes i would do for sure like 5 more points of damage per swing.  every time.  but i'm only getting 2 swings.  on the other hand, mop gives me a 5% chance of getting a critical hit, which on a caster can be up to 400+ damage.  the question you have to ask yourself is which is better - 10 more damage for sure, or the potential for 400+ more damage, hence kililng the caster on the second swing before he has time to qc root on you?  my opinion is that 10 more damage is not going to kill the caster.  ever.  hence, regardless of whether it's better over time or not, to me it is useless.  mastery of pain on the other hand WILL trigger periodically and give you a 2 shot kill where you had none before, getting you out of being rooted and thereby giving you a huge advantage over where you would have been otherwise.  a sure thing which does not help you is NOT better than a gamble which might.<br>
<br>
toughness and aug con 2 each would burn 6 points.  there are better things to spend 6 points on than extra hits.  like buying a shaman who can buff you to cap anyway.  toughness and aug con do NOT raise your cap.  better to spend 3 of those points on avoid magic 2 and random extras like say tireless 1 or something like that.  if you were rank 8 or 9 and had points to burn that is.<br>
<br>
as for lifter, unless you're a gimp you're going to need a ram for your rvr activities once in a while.  lifter also helps to keep champions and infiltrators from rooting you.  nothing is worse than being forced to waste purge on a friggin str debuff just so you can move.<br>
<br>
as i said in a previous post, #s are not the be all and end all of what is good.  i dont care what's 0.25% &quot;better&quot; in an infinite sample size, i only care what is best in the 2 to 10 seconds of actual combat that transpire before either myself or my opponent are dead.  what helps me secure the most rps in that time frame is what matters.  keeping mobile (and alive, hence IP) and doing the most damage possible in the given amount of time ar what is most important.<br>
<br>
i'm really sleepy, hopefully i didn't miss anything or come across sounding like an imbecile.<br>

Ambushing is the easiest way to assure victory, and when you are all running along /stuck on one person in a tight little cluster, you are dogmeat for an AE spell.<br>
<br>
I've seen a group get shredded by 3 casters who had a GTAE parked on the road, and a group run over it.<br>
<br>
Or a bard wizzing around with run5, coming out of no where, and hitting the instant win button on your group all /stuck on the skald running to some keep.<br>
<br>
In the BG's however, you usually don't see this. But, you do see ambushing on a smaller scale. <p><link rel="stylesheet" href="http://home.mindspring.com/~matthewshears/linked/fontbehavior.css"

Back to the main topic, I have read that you can only crit 1-50% in RvR. Is this true? If so, MoP suddenly looks pretty crappy.<br>

I agree with Phleet about Aug Quickness - worthless for anyone but Rogues and maybe Berserkers - see Dodger and reduced draw times for archers (which means much more damage since their bowshots are always normal attacks).  Adding 6 Quickness will drop your swing time down by 1% which isn't much when you're swinging a 5.3 sec delay weapon.<br>
<br>
Aug Strength 1 might be worth a point once you've bought your active RA's - FA2, IP, Purge and maybe MCL1 - but, imo, Master of Pain is far more important.  Sure, you don't always crit, but the crits can be huge.<br>
