<br>
I have to say, this is not up to your usual data collection efficiency.  This small of a population could be argued as a statistical variation and not really indicative of a real effect.  Roseanne has said she is taking reams of data and still hasnt produced a definitive result (or reported one anyhow).  That in itself would lend one to argue perhaps the variance is greater than the difference.  So, I would not judge this without some more testing... say, 100-200 trials.  <br>
<br>
If one supports the argument that BS increases damage .3% (I blieve you made that statement) the statistical average should be around 1.5 points per 100 damage (for +5).   3 points over 200 is not very resolvable without significant sampling to be certain.  You commented to me once about stating facts without data.  Well, the same applies to insufficient data, too.  But, before you go off on me, I think overall you do a lot for the understanding of the game and skalds in specific.
