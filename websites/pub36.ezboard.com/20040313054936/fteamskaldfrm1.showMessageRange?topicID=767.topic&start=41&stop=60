Obviously your argument is so weak that you have to harp on that single thing.<br>
<br>
&quot;This contradicts your earlier comments that a skald was comparable damage to a warrior.&quot;<br>
<br>
ROFL. Nothing I said was even related. <br>
<br>
&quot;Your contention seems to be that a skald has greater survivability because minst are a greater threat and therefore skalds survive longer because they aren't targeted to be killed. Well, that's not how rvr works really. it usually goes &quot;easy kill, important kill, tough kill&quot; in that order. Skald falls under easy kill. Minst falls under important/tough, primarily because most classes can't get a grip on them once they have used their RAs or if they are under the influence of Mezz reduction/immunity timers.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wow. Well I have to say your understanding of RvR and priorities is a bit out of whack. First off, a good player in RvR will understand that there are three classifications of targets: Priority or Important targets (Any caster, any healer), rogues and tanks. Priority targets are not killed first because they are the easiest to kill, although that is a factor. They are killed first because left unchecked they can singlehandedly destroy a group. Minstrels are in a different boat because of SoS. If they are mezzed and not purging, they are lower priority than any healer or caster. If they are unmezzed they are very high priority. Skalds are very low priority because they are a hybrid tank and not as easy to take down as any caster and tougher to take down than a healer (only because if you are on a skald rather than a healer, you have a healer free to heal the skald, while if on a healer, you have one less person distributing heals. <br>
<br>
&quot;for the record i have a RR6l4 Skald and partial ownership of a rr8l2 minst.&quot; <br>
<br>
WOW PARTIAL OWENERSHIP? Whooptidoo....<br>
<br>
&quot;So i've seen it from both sides and i can guarentee you my minst lives far longer then my skald 99% of the time, primarily because i can do my job without being right in the front line area, which is not feasible for a skald to be effective, they must wade in.&quot;<br>
<br>
A minstrel will live longer against retards, but that is all I will give you. Since alot of the people, surprisingly enough, are not COMPLETE morons, I am usually among the last to die. Even some of the worst groups have decent target selection. My group gets rid of minstrels fairly quickly.<br>
<br>
&quot;A minst can maintain a 1000 unit buffer to most of the dangerous combat while at the same time reducing the ranged threat to them while on the move (mezz and kite). Mezz may not stick after the inital cast, but it DOES interrupt, and thats all you need to survive a ranged caster and interrupt healers at a distance, just run around and spam cast it on them, you've done your entire team an invaluable service while maintaining a posture that allows you to live through most if not all fights.&quot;<br>
<br>
It is decent useful as an interrupt, but if you have a decent sorcerer in your group and you are using your mez, you are doing your group a disservice. Nothing changes a battle more than having a cleric or friar rez a sorcerer mid-battle and having the sorcerer get off another mez. A minstrel that is giving everyone immunity timers would piss me off if I were a sorcerer. In fact when I was a newbie minstrel I got chewed out by one of the better sorcerers I have met for doing the exact thing you are trying to convince me is the way to play a minstrel. Anyway, it is useful if your sorcerer sucks, but otherwise isn't a big help.<br>
<br>
&quot;To say the AE mezz is inconsequential is horribly inaccurate, a well played minst can lock down entire armies of ranged attackers with it and cause healers a constant headache.&quot;<br>
<br>
A Minstrel standing in one place and spamming the 5 second cast AE mez is a newbie minstrel and makes me laugh IRL.<br>
<br>
&quot;Skald has 1 timered range interrupt at 1500 units, other then that they have to close to a min. 700 to continue to interrupt casters, then its a timer.&quot;<br>
<br>
A good Skald spaces out his interrupts s othat one is always up. Guess that isn't something you have figured out yet. No problem, you will learn.<br>
<br>
&quot;Minst are designed to be survivable support classes, tho it may be true that skalds and minst both die a lot in close combat with heavy tanks, a minst has the optiont to do his job without being in that situation where a skald doesn't.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, you have somewhat of a point, but again, I would argue that a minstrel in a good group with a good sorc is better served using his DDs and stun to interrupt and helping tanks on an /assisted target.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your selective use of stun is your choice, however that doesn't mean that other uses for it don't make it a very powerful tool, for instance using Stun on Pbaer who is about to nail your CCed realmmates can save them a substantial amount of damage.&quot; <br>
<br>
I never disqualified using stun in such a way. However, skald mez is superior to stun in that situation. If he MOC's stun won't last long enough. In any case, I don't usually run into problems with pbaers. They are generally dead or mezzed before we have problems with them. Guess we are coming from different perspectives here. =)<br>
<br>
&quot;there are quite a fewer other uses for stun, to be honest, your better off using mezz on the move to stop most runners (except those with immunity) because then when you close to combat and engage, you can stun mid combat with no timer concern if the fight becomes too tough.&quot;<br>
<br>
Stun is better in my opinion if you have a good caster in your group that pays attention and can take out the runner without much effort.<br>
<br>
&quot;This would be true if the snare didn't break upon next damage to the target.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mez breakd on damage too. Don't see your point here pal.<br>
<br>
&quot;very very rarely when you are chasing somebody through an active battle field will you land a snare that really sticks for more then a couple of seconds with the tons of AE being thrown around and people trying to take a shot at the target as its running past.&quot;<br>
<br>
Unless I am around a bunch of other groups, we don't really use AEs and people generally are not all on different targets. I guess I am used to more discipline than that. When surrounded by people that know what they are doing the snare is very very usefuk.<br>
<br>
&quot;Additionally, bleed styles, dots and some pulsing effects can break snare.&quot;<br>
<br>
For many purposes the snare only needs to interrupt or snare the person for a few seconds. Long duration snare isnt' what makes it great. It is the fact that it is a shout, has good range and lasts a decent amount of time. Even if it breaks, I have several extra seconds to catch them. <br>
<br>
&quot;Once you've snared and had it broken, you've given the target in question root immunity, which means should they get away from you (like say you get cced or otherwise stopped) the next caster they go after has no CC option to stop them unless they try to mezz (sm)&quot;<br>
<br>
Again different perspectives here I guess. Root immunity is a problem with the snare, but in a good group everyone has to rely on cross-ccing. I don't find it to be a problem and our shammy, who is largely responsible for rooting people off casters hasn't complained. I think it is really a matter of experience and being selective in your use of it. A lot of people, yourself included I imagine, probably spam snare for the sole purpose of interrupting as soon as the timer is up. Well, with selective use of snare, it can be so much more. I do my best not to use it JUST for interrupts except in emergencies.<br>
<br>
&quot;From a skill set perspective, skald snare is incredibly inferior to prevent flight, both in its casted form and its styled form.&quot;<br>
<br>
LOL!! What does that have to do with the discussion? Prevent Flight is a great ability. So? The fact that prevent Flight exists doesnt' have a bearing on whether Skalds are a good class or not.<br>
<br>
&quot;A low stealth high weapon/instrument minst is very very capable of taking down people in 1 round of combat (casters)&quot;<br>
<br>
Bull. Absolute bull. You show me a caster that goes down from 350ish dmg in shouts and &gt;200 melee dmg and I show you a level 40 caster. God, don't be an idiot.<br>
<br>
&quot;Minst and skald are on identical weaponskill tables, the myth that skalds have higher weaponskill was perpetuated by people comparing low str minst chars to Trolls skalds. it's simply not true.&quot;<br>
<br>
Talking out of your ass here buddy. You can't show me any documentation on this at all. I wouldn't doubt it, but again, you are making it up.<br>
<br>
&quot;A minst with an Anchor (slow 1 hand weapon) will do very good damage per strike vs cloth casters, add in their DDs and mastery of pain II (aug str one helps also) and they can approach close to 430 with an opening blow + 300 from DDs, that's enough to take out an unbuffed caster.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rofl. 430? If they have like 0 melee or body resists AND if you are buffed AND if you crit AND if they aren't buffed. Sounds like a LOT has to go right for that to happen. In reality you will never take down a level 50 caster with decent gear in one round of combat even if you are buffed and they aren't. You are dwelling into the realm of the ridiculous here. Get back to reality. People run buffed and almost always have capped resists. If they don't, they aren't really worth using as an example of RvR prowess.<br>
<br>
&quot;Should they perfect crit on the attack or get a positional off, that damage goes up quite a bit.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Plus they can stun said caster and beat on them a couple more times with the positional of their choice without worrying about the first shot breaking their mezz and the caster qc ccing them or lifetapping them.&quot;<br>
<br>
Uh huh. Again. A minstrel will never kill as fast as an equally skilled or equipped Skald. Never. My minstrel had the best gear in the game and never came close to the 500+ NON CRIT attacks I issue out to casters regularly on my skald.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wish i had my other computer up, i'd throw up the screenie of minst hitting mana eld for 419, 189 139 (dds) then hitting for 560. The mana eld lived because he got an insta from his druid. Clearly there is a crit in there (mana eld took shot), but the point is, minst can do = damage to skald if they low spec stealth, which they don't NEED in rvr. Skald can only spec for max damage if they gimp their BS song a bit.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lol. You are desribing an ideal situation. That is a once in a lifetime hit for a minstrel. Two obvious crits. I sincerely doubt that caster had capped resists. SINCERELY. Post the screenie though I would love to see that because I think you are fibbing. =p In any case, you are posting your most ideal situation wheras that is normal to see from a good Skald. That is the difference, your best example of minstrel pwnage is like average for my skald. As for gimping BS line for max damage, I used to be 50 Sword spec and hit for 700+ routinely on casters. However, I do much more average damage now as a 50 BS Skald than I ever did as 50 Sword. You don't know what you are talking about here guy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Refer to my comment about tying up everyone in the back areas with chain mezzes. compare how many people a skald can tie up compared to a minst then.&quot;<br>
<br>
I suppose a Minstrel can &quot;tie up&quot; more people than a Skald, but this isn't a debate about how well Skalds CC versus Minstrels. I said they had better survivability. You made it into a minstrel versus skald debate. Anyway, while the minstrel is back their &quot;tying people up&quot; a Skald is inflicting damage. It is my believe after playing both classes (and not pretending someone else's minstrel is mine) that it is more benficial to have some CC, a lot of damage than a lot of gimpy CC and subpar damage. <br>
<br>
a minst + Pally interaction is greater then any duo in mid.<br>
<br>
WHAT? Dude, can you interject with any more non-sequitors? Are you serious? I know your argument is weak, but at least stay on topic.<br>
<br>
&quot;IE a minst + pally = Damage add, AF buff, Ablative, heal + extras&quot;<br>
<br>
How does this relate to Skalds being a viable class in RvR that doesn't need help?<br>
<br>
&quot;+ minst get insta Stun, castable AE mezz which interrupts.&quot;<br>
<br>
How does this relate to Skalds being a viable class in RvR that doesn't need help?<br>
<br>
&quot;That's ignoring the SOS, BOF aspect entirely. Granted Pally can't get ring of tears, but its a minor issue&quot;<br>
<br>
How does this relate to Skalds being a viable class in RvR that doesn't need help?<br>
<br>
&quot;skald has no favorable duo in mid...cept maybe the RM but thats questionable.&quot;<br>
<br>
A good cave aug shammy/skald duo will be very effective? I have killed full groups with minstrels AND palies included with that duo. Anyway, who cares? Duos are fun, but they aren't the be all and end all of RvR.<br>
<br>
&quot;You must balance classes around how they interact with other classes in their own realm otherwise you can't balance ever. To see the extremes of why ignoring class duo/group combinations, look at the dreds and see what happens when you put a necro + animist in a keep situation. Sure, solo they may not make a vastly overpowered combination, but combined, they can defeat Dozens.&quot;<br>
<br>
WHO CARES? God. Those two classes are not even in the same realm and Mythic has explicitly said they don't care abotu class balance issues as they relate to the dreds. Could you use a more idiotic example?<br>
<br>
&quot;How does that apply to your comment you ask? you are taking it as a 1 v 1 and you beat minst. well for starters, you never know what the other guys spec is, he could be 50 inst/50 stealth for all you know, its not a controlled thing. but you expand it to a group setting and suddenly the minst increases in power exponetially while a skald has exactly the same benefits solo, in a group or in an army.&quot;<br>
<br>
You were the one who said a minstrel could kill a skald solo. That was a stupid comment and now you are trying to cover it up. Sorry, not working. While your comment has some merit, I don't believe that Minstrels are ever really more beneficial than Skalds. In a poor group with poor players they might be, but I think the addition of a sing class that can do very good damage is much more benefical than a second rate CC class with mediocre damage.<br>
<br>
&quot;Additionally, you are comparing a class to class where you put a minst specifically in their worst element, that is close combat 1 v 1 vs a skalds strongest case, 1 v 1. you allow that minst to kite and start the combat from range, suddenly things change. it becomes an entirely different battle.&quot;<br>
<br>
What ever happened to the &quot;cold hard fact&quot; that a Minstrel could beat a Skald solo? Tell you what, grab your misntrel, copy him to Pend and duel my skald. If you beat him I'll give you a plat.  Uh huh. Thought so...<br>
<br>
&quot;Not sure where you've been the last couple of months. But a significant number of servers have a severe skalds shortage. Your defination of &quot;decent group&quot; = exceptional group ona great many servers. your little half-assed insult about my skill level was abit uncalled for, but its clear you feel that fighting 8 v8 and winning is somehow realm combat, so i assume you don't really get the big picture very well.&quot;<br>
<br>
I am not just an 8v8 guy, but I do find your opinions naive at best and you are obviously someone that is drawing hsi conclusions with the zerg mentality in mind. I think that you are going to get a better idea of class balance in smaller group settings. You are probably one of those people who calls everyone that puts together decent groups and plays well, elitist when they don't add you to their groups, no? And there are no shortage of Skalds on my server or any that I have played on.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have a feeling frontiers is gonna make you miserable&quot;<br>
<br>
No I am sure I will have fun. <br>
<br>
&quot;What server is your skald on again? &quot;<br>
<br>
Try reading my sig. <br>
<br>
&quot;out of 210 logged fights between the minst i use and an equal rank skald, i won 188 of them. of those that i lost, he used IP or AoF and AP.<br>
<br>
I'm far from out of my mind, i'm just not a crap minst. Which is apparently all you've experienced either as a player or as an attacker.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
HA! You just rescinded your claim above, now you are going back to it? Bro, Minstrels are a joke 1 vs 1 and I have fought some good ones. A good skald will never lose to a minstrel unless he does everything wrong, or everything goes wrong for him. 210 huh? Thats a lot of fights. I would be interested in seeing those &quot;logs.&quot; Post them somewhere on the forum.  All 210 &quot;logged&quot; fights. I have a feeling you are being dishonest again. =(<br>
<br>
&quot;yes, i hit 5l4 prior to dinging 50, predominately solo. And i suck. completely and utterly suck, beyond belief! Matter of fact, i have a lifetime IRS of 1500+ including suiciding on keeps and playing on one of the most underpopulated mid realms across all servers!!&quot;<br>
<br>
1500 is impressive? Hell, mine is like 2300 and I am embarassed by it (too many suicides). I average 4500ish now and still solo a good 40K a week of the 200ish I usually get. And I play on THE most underpopulated mid realm in DAoC. Thnx for playing though.<br>
<br>
&quot;maybe, just maybe, its possible that you aren't seeing the overall grand scheme of things very clearly. maybe its possible you are wrong(what are the odds?!). Maybe its possible that all those RR6+ skalds running around saying &quot;hey, this is unbalanced and needs work&quot; are not all clueless newbie whiners.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sorry, but there are a few people out there that I know for a fact are great skalds. All of them are happy with the class and have a nice laugh at the expense of those of you moaning about skald imbalance. In my opinion, the skald is a very strong class that is on the verge of being overpowered if given much help.<br>
<br>
&quot;do you ONLY run in guild groups?&quot;<br>
<br>
No, we let other people in our &quot;guild groups&quot; =p I also solo and duo extensively.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you refuse certain classes from your group because they aren't optimal?&quot;<br>
<br>
I/We refuse players we don't know and trust. Not really a class thing. I am sure we would run with a good Shadowblade if we knew one that was decent in a group.<br>
<br>
&quot;if you answered both those questions as yes, you probably don't belong in a discussion on class balance, since you aren't with the program when it comes to game balance.&quot;<br>
<br>
So much for that =(<br>
<br>
&quot;Perhaps, the best indicator you're an idiot out of the last 3 posts you've made.&quot;<br>
<br>
OH NO YOU CALLED ME A NAME!!!! What were you saying above about credibility? <br>
<br>
&quot;- 1 minst with ring in a 3fg force means every other minst can grab a red con pet. magnifying their projected force potential my significant amounts, especially if they can get ranged nuking pets or pets with a CC/debuff ability&quot;<br>
<br>
You are making a mountain out of a molehill. I am sure it would help things, but most minstrels do not bother with pets, even those that are really good at twisting. Not because they don't want to twist, but because a red con pet resists charm to the point it is more of a nuisance than anything. The fact that you said red con made me chuckle a little though.<br>
<br>
&quot;- 2 minst with ring can provide runie like stacking ablative to an entire force. timed correctly, this means every single strike in a 1 v 1 encounter will lose at least 60 damage from ablative.&quot;<br>
<br>
And everyone can have bladeturn, blah blah. It is already happening on my server and it isn't a big deal at all. And ablative at level 50 Instruments is 70 dmg. These are helpful but not battle changing factors. I think that the speed issue with the croc ring is a much bigger advanatge for Albs given the rarity of real minstrels.<br>
<br>
&quot;- 2 bards means entire force has end regen + speed, regardless if the bards are in two seperate groups or not.&quot;<br>
<br>
Good, they can be on equal footing with Mid and Alb now, both of whom usually have end regen for everyone.<br>
<br>
Again, it isnt' that big of a deal. It won't change the face of RvR. It is a neat little trick that will help the clueless newbie zergers out a bit. They need it. Good for them.<br>
<br>
&quot;I realize you categorize yourself as being &quot;good&quot; because you run in a group of 8 and therefore it somehow requires more skill (cough).&quot;<br>
<br>
Eh. It does actually. You are responsible for your actions, you can't hide in a zerg where your screwups go unoticed. Sorry, I do have to say that running with 8 and killing 30 people takes a lot more skill than killing 30 with 30. If you disagree with that, you are sadder than I had previously thought.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sadly, what that normally means is that you ran around an held off fighting the majority of the fights you COULD engage (because the otherside was a bunch of clueless zerging noobs right?) until you found fights you could win, usually fights you either outnumber or you come up on people from the side, thus gaining initial contact advantage which immediately decreases the &quot;skill required&quot; to win simply because your enemy is disadvantaged from the get go.&quot;<br>
<br>
Um. Well, I dunno what a lot of the 8v8 people do on your server, but it is standard practice for us to engage larger numbers. We don't run from anything unless they significantly outnumber us. Not sure how that is different from any other rvr engagement. It is pretty common for us to kill 3 or 4 groups. We have killed up to 50 or so in the open field, but that was a special battle with special circumstances. In any case, we don't bring 8 because we want to fight only other 8v8 groups (although those can be a lot of fun). We bring 8 because anything more isn't enough of a challenge. I know the concept of &quot;challenge&quot; is foreign to many people in DAoC, but I actually like to fight when the odds are stacked against me.<br>
<br>
&quot;The sad fact of the matter is that tho the skald performes moderately well in single group combat in combat situations where they are advantaged from the start, when you go head to head with groups where the fight is even or they start with the advantage you provide no significant bonus to your group. When you go against multiple enemy groups, the rest of your REALM'S force, gains an insignifcant advantage from you being there.&quot;<br>
<br>
Really. News to me. I do very well in large battles, so do several skalds I fight with a lot. Again, I think your perspective is clouded with your own limitations. I only wish you wouldn't try and force the idea on others that they suck.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Essentially, once the need for speed ends, IE combat is entered, the skald is a sub-par performer. I could explain why in greater detail, tho after writing this little novel it occured to me that i could explain the complete works of shakesphere and you'd nod your head slowly and then go something like &quot;I'm L33t!&quot; and flex.&quot; <br>
<br>
I am sorry, but I have to disagree. While they are not as effective as tanks with determination, Skalds have a lot of potential to be high achievers in RvR.  Among Hybrids I would put us behind maybe only the friar, paly and a very well played Reaver. That puts us in the middle. I am fine with that. I don't need more help to perform well and I don't believe Mythic needs to give Skalds any more help that takes them out of the middle and closer to the top. Maybe you are upset that you can't do the things with your skald that others can. Maybe you are angry with me because I am an &quot;elitist&quot; and trying to rain on your &quot;Boo Hoo Skalds suck&quot; parade. I am not certain. It is obvious your arguments are not very strong in that you made this into a Skald versus Minstrel debate rather than looking at a Skald based only on its own merits. Minstrels are a strong class and it is a difficult case for me to say Skalds are more effective, but I make the case because that is my experience from playing both classes to a high realm rank and with a lot of skill. I personally believe that a well played skald can surpass the minstrel in effectiveness. Maybe that doesn't hold true if players are not as skilled, I don't know. Maybe your average minstrel player is better than your average Skald player. I can simply say that I call them like I see them and all these Skald player whining is silly. Skalds are in a better place than MANY classes in DAoC and I don't want them to be overpowered.<br>

&quot;Skald has 1 timered range interrupt at 1500 units, other then that they have to close to a min. 700 to continue to interrupt casters, then its a timer.&quot;<br>
<br>
A good Skald spaces out his interrupts s othat one is always up. Guess that isn't something you have figured out yet. No problem, you will learn.<br>
<br>
======<br>
Nothing i can say could demonstrate why you shouldn't be in this discussion better then your own words. between the standing still and mezzing comment and the spreading out your interrupts (which only works if you are goin against one guy, as opposed to an array of opponents), i'm not sure you have a solid grasp as to just what exactly i'm referring too.<br>
<br>
&quot;What ever happened to the &quot;cold hard fact&quot; that a Minstrel could beat a Skald solo?&quot;<br>
<br>
I never said it was a head to head melee fight.  Which seems to be where you are getting stuck.  I said they could beat a skald solo.  Reading comprehension apparently cons +++ to you.  The same goes for the discussion i posed on balance, which you apparently didn't recognize as a related topic to skald improvements.  Camparisons between interactions between the various classes in a realm are a very valid concern when it  comes to realm balance, which is the whole purpose of balancing a skald or any other class in the first place.  The explanation of why it was bad to ignore that balance issue was the animist/necro combination.  Listen close, it was designed to show what happens when class interactions between teammates can lead to overpowered results....which must be taken into consideration when doing realm balance.<br>
<br>
&quot;And ablative at level 50 Instruments is 70 dmg. These are helpful but not battle changing factors.&quot;<br>
<br>
maybe not, but stacking ablative + bof+ af chant + spec AF buff + bubble....suddenly it becomes a big deal when your pair of assisting tanks do a grand total of 45 damage in 3 rounds of combat.<br>
<br>
&quot;Among Hybrids I would put us behind maybe only the friar, paly and a very well played Reaver.&quot;  <br>
<br>
champ?  or more accurately, of the hybrids, what did you leave out in that list?<br>
<br>
Hybrids to choose from:<br>
Friar<br>
Pally<br>
Reaver<br>
Champ<br>
Valewalker<br>
Thane<br>
Skald<br>
<br>
You left out champ from your list of toons that can defeat all but the hugely buffed skald (DD+ Str/con debuff with possible crit).  Aside from that, the only hybrid left for the skald to be ahead of is the the thane and the valewalker....I'm guessing you don't have too many good VWs on your server...brief check of the server stats shows you don't have any possible opponets over RR6 on Bed as Vws.  So i'll chalk that omission up to just not ever running into one.<br>
<br>
<br>
I could go back and point to point your commentary, out of respect for rosie, am just gonna let it die after commenting on those couple issues.<br>
<br>
As for partial ownership of the minst.  I play the minst, they play a druid on a different server. I play when he is deployed overseas.  The reason he let me use his account to make the minst is because i wanted to play with some friends in alb on that server, and he had a lvl 8 minst there with 5 plat on it already i could use to help me level it up.  not sure how exactly you feel thats a big deal.  <br>
<br>
as for the slew of personal insults strewn through your commentary.  i've played with quite a bit of success through 6 different classes, in all three realms, past Realm Rank 6.  apparently i'm doing something correctly.<br>
<br>
For the record, mid igraine worse off then Bed with relation to population, and even worse off if you consider the population that the opposing realms have.<br>
Mid population<br>
 Rank Server      Realm       population<br>
  12  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Bedevere &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Midgard &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp      970 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
  13&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   Igraine &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp     Midgard &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp      881<br>
Hib population<br>
   8&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp    Igraine      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hibernia &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp    1,267<br>
  10&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   Bedevere &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   Hibernia &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp    1,132 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Alb population<br>
   5&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp    Igraine &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp      Albion &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp         1,742<br>
   7&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp    Bedevere &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   Albion &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp         1,555 <br>
<br>
So as you can see, not only does igraine have fewer mids then bedevere, but they face more opponents. tends to have a bit of an effect on IRS.  Combine those facts with the fact i led a large number of relic raids where i had to be allowed to die at certain points, and it makes sense for my irs to be where it is.<br>

<br>
I have a solid understanding that you are being difficult for the sake of being difficult. Spreading out your interrupts is easy to do to 2 and even 3 people. I do it ALL the time. A minstrel spamming AE mez in one spot (they do have to stay stationary for the AE mez) is both a huge target and is excercising utter carelessness. Doing that can really screw up the CC for a group.<br>
<br>
&quot;I never said it was a head to head melee fight. Which seems to be where you are getting stuck. I said they could beat a skald solo. Reading comprehension apparently cons +++ to you.&quot;<br>
<br>
They could beat a skald solo, but only a really crappy one. Honestly, I think your objectivity on this is tainted from having a sucky skald, or playing a sucky skald (not sure which applies). A minstrel could do every single thing right (Get jump from stealth, DD, DD, Mez, DD, DD, melee, Stun, melee and DD till the skald is dead or SOME variation of that) and still have a very small chance of winning against a good skald. The fact that you said minstrel melee came even close to Skald melee shows that you haven't the slightest idea what you are talking about. It isn't close. <br>
<br>
&quot;The same goes for the discussion i posed on balance, which you apparently didn't recognize as a related topic to skald improvements.&quot;<br>
<br>
No, you started posting things TOTALLY unrelated to skald balance in general. Who cares if certain classes are a better duo or not? By your logic if a Healer Savage duo was inferior to a Cleric Paly duo (need to pretend here) that means that Healers have balance issues. Well, no. None of those classes have balance issues. One just might be a better pairing than another because of the way abilities are distributed for the different realms. I recognized what you were doing and saw it as straying from the topic at hand. Minstrels and Skalds are classes with very different roles.<br>
<br>
&quot;Talking about realm balance Camparisons between interactions between the various classes in a realm are a very valid concern when it comes to realm balance, which is the whole purpose of balancing a skald or any other class in the first place.&quot;<br>
<br>
Really. Well, skalds must be fine then because aside from SoS, a good Mid group doesn't lose very often to an equally skilled Alb group. SoS throws things out of whack, but that is a realm balance problem which is being addressed currently by Mythic. Any nerf to SoS will not be a nerf to minstrels, it will be a nerf to Alb realm abilities. Bad logic though if you are intent on winning the argument. That is actually helping my logic because in the grand scheme of things I think Skalds are balanced in the big picture. I would rather have an extra tank in my group than a mediocre CCer.<br>
<br>
&quot;The explanation of why it was bad to ignore that balance issue was the animist/necro combination. Listen close, it was designed to show what happens when class interactions between teammates can lead to overpowered results....which must be taken into consideration when doing realm balance.&quot;<br>
<br>
That is a keep siege it has very little to do with the big picture. I can't think of another duo that is blatantly overpowered. And honestly in a keep siege, if you get wiped by a necro and animist, it just makes you stupid, not them overpowered. That is something easily solved with a few good rogues willing to take one for the team. Don't lecture me about anything on the dreds, I have played there for well over a million RPs. Your example is a friggin joke.<br>
<br>
&quot;maybe not, but stacking ablative + bof+ af chant + spec AF buff + bubble....suddenly it becomes a big deal when your pair of assisting tanks do a grand total of 45 damage in 3 rounds of combat.&quot;<br>
<br>
WHY IS THIS A SKALD BALANCE ISSUE? Jesus Christ. You keep bringing up this off the wall garbage that belongs in a realm balance situation, which in this case is moot. Throw all those abilities into the ring and Mid still comes out on top. I have yet to see a fight albs have won due to ablative and AF buffs. BoF? Maybe if they have superior numbers and also use SoS. Midgard, RAs notwithstanding is somewhat overpowered. This is currently balanced out with the Alb RAs that basically give them a huge advantage once every 30 mins. But speaking as someone who has a collective 10 million or so RPs, 5 of which I earned in Mid I am a pretty good judge and can look at Midgard objectively. As a realm, we are fine. I agree that Skalds are not a SUPER class. They are pretty good..decent, which is what I have been saying. Whether or not you agree with me that Minstrels are a better class I could give a rat's ass. You cannot argue with me that one of mid's building block classes needs improvement. It throws everything out of whack and Mythic does look at things from a big picture. I would be very surprised to see them improve skalds in a BIG way. Small things like the resists, yes. <br>
<br>
So basically you turned this into a Skald verus minstrel argument then FINALLY came back and shot yourself in the foot making it into a Skald balance issue, which indirectly makes it a Midgard balance issue.<br>
<br>
&quot;Among Hybrids I would put us behind maybe only the friar, paly and a very well played Reaver.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;champ? or more accurately, of the hybrids, what did you leave out in that list?<br>

Skald<br>

So i'll chalk that omission up to just not ever running into one.&quot;<br>
<br>
Champs are good 1 vs 1, but I don't find them to be on the level of Skalds in terms of total utility, nor total combat effectiveness. This isn't a 1 vs 1 debate (although, I have fought a number of Champions and beaten every single one). I gave palies the nod, but I beat palies 1 vs 1, especially as a 50 BS skald. As for Valewalker, I have played on a number of servers and seen what they can do. One of my better friends in-game plays one on Mordred. They are good if played bya very skilled player, but still lacking tremendously. They are in just a slightly better position than Thanes, although I think Thanes can be pretty useful in groups with high shield spec. <br>
<br>
&quot;As for partial ownership of the minst. I play the minst, they play a druid on a different server. I play when he is deployed overseas. The reason he let me use his account to make the minst is because i wanted to play with some friends in alb on that server, and he had a lvl 8 minst there with 5 plat on it already i could use to help me level it up. not sure how exactly you feel thats a big deal.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't think it is a big deal. Thats the point. <br>
<br>
&quot;as for the slew of personal insults strewn through your commentary. i've played with quite a bit of success through 6 different classes, in all three realms, past Realm Rank 6. apparently i'm doing something correctly.&quot;<br>
<br>
Uh huh.<br>
<br>
&quot;For the record, mid igraine worse off then Bed with relation to population, and even worse off if you consider the population that the opposing realms have.&quot;<br>
<br>
I can concede that, but when the /level 30 was established Mid/BEd was in the worst situation. Hadn't checked since then.<br>
<br>
I may have been rude this debate, but I find the crybaby routine extremely distasteful when the class is in a good place right now compared to a lot of others. You posted a whole wad of BS and as soon as I called you on it, you conveniently left it behind. The 200 logged fights with the minstrel and Skald, the 500+ melee damage, etc etc. I appreciate people who can have an honest discussion, let it get a little intense yet not feel the need to make things up. That is what you did. You made it up. And that pretty much sums up the majority of what you had to say. You made some good and valid points, but negated them entirely with lies.<br>
<br>
Bad luck to you in your quest to get Skalds improved. I honestly hope it doesn't happen. I like a challenge. I like where Midgard is realm balance-wise. I feel that any significant changes to Skalds would overpower the class and the realm and could possibly lead to undue nerfs to associated classes like the Savage and Healer.<br>
<br>
I am open to honest discussions on the subject, but abhore conversations that dwel into riduclousness because of dishonesty and careless inventions of the imagination. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kyldrik>kyldrik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Participant</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/24/03 10:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=767.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.binary-vision.com/stalvalr/images/uploaded/ACF48C.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ok</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I like where Midgard is realm balance-wise.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

You must be kidding. &quot;<br>
<br>
Why? Without Realm abilities midgard groups clearly outperform their other realm counterparts. We have the best CC class in the game, combined with our primary healing class, very good tank classes in the Warrior and Savage (with a zerker thrown in the mix for Prevent Flight + the Left Axe/2H combo) and the best overall caster class in the game (SM) that has great survivability for a caster (Pet intercept + MoC lifetap) and two very powerful specilization options depending on how you wish to constuct your group. <br>
<br>
Alb and hib groups have their strong points as well, but without RAs they are not on the same level as Mid groups. In the end, the realms are balanced group and class-wise because RAs give an advantage every 30 mins or so. Without them, Midgard is clearly superior.<br>
<br>
After playing with godly Healers I can't see anyone thinking Midgard is hurting as a realm. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=singdemsong>Singdemsong</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://camelot.dragonzones.com/sig/ns.jpg " BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Participant</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/31/03 4:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=767.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://camelot.dragonzones.com/sig/ns.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> &quot;godly Healers&quot;<br>

Healers are not godly, but they are required for Mids to be effective in rvr.<br>

Healers are not godly, but they are required for Mids to be effective in rvr.<br>
<br>

<br>
Bards would be a great class if they didn't get mowed down 3x as fast as any Healer due to the instrument making them stick out like a sore thumb at range. <br>
<br>
A well played Healer can be godly. No other class in the game can effect the outcome of a battle more than an extremely well played Healer. This isn't up for debate. They are far more powerful than bards in all but two respects, that being the insta amnesia and end regen. However the end regen is really a mixed blessing unless you have two bards. I know that as a Skald I often keep my speed on in a battle so they can kite. That is only an option with two bards. Healers are far and away a better class. Their healing with 30 Mending is twice as good a bard could conceivably have, they have an identical AE mez (or close to it) as well as 4 forms of insta CC available thus increasing their own survivability as well as allowing for a nice spell (AE insta stun) to lead into battle with, 3 different forms of CC overall, buffs, power regen. Come on...<br>
<br>
I mean, I am pretty biased myself, but hearing someone try to tell me a bard is even close to as powerful as a Healer is an outright joke. I have played both classes. It isn't even close. Healers are the most powerful class in DAoC. Their presence alone allows Midgard to put together superior 8v8 groups despite having an inferior selection of classes overall.  <p>Sligg - 51 - Skald *Bedevere*<br>

Bards bring more to a table than Healers.  This is not to say healers suck, rather that Bards bring more group friendly abilities to a group than a healer.

I didn't say anything about spec choices. There are several ways to go for Healers, all viable. With 30 Mend, 44 Pac a Healer gets very nice heals and very good CC options.<br>

If you are going to get snide and rude, I will as well. If you believe that a Bard brings more to a group than a healer you are out of your mind (I would go further, but I don't want to hurt your feelings). I know you are trying to make midgard out to be this hurting realm and all, but it is quite simple. My argument is that a very good Healer can change a battle a lot more than a very good bard can. It isn't that complicated. With the Healer you have a combination of the game's best overall crowd control (that is not a debatable point) with Midgard's primary heal class. The fact that you get the best AE mez and spread heal with your normal, fotm Healer spec is testament enough to the advantage you get with a Healer. Put two healers in a group that know their class and you have two formidable healers (bard heals are mediocre at best) with crowd control support (bard CC is the worst of the primary CC classes in the game). Bards bring some different things to a group, but they don't have the potential to dominate the way Healers do. Spreadheal + best CC in the game beats anything a bard can throw at you.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Is the perfect rez intimidating to you? Not sure why you have such a hard on for healers. Have you used a level 50 healer in rvr? &quot;<br>
<br>
Rofl. Is that a joke? Yes I have &quot;used&quot; a level 50 Healer in RvR. I have also RvR'd with some of the best Healers DAoC has to offer. They will tell you themselves that Healers are the most dominating class in the game and make ever yother support class in the game a joke by comparison. It isn't a &quot;hard-on,&quot; it is reality. In my experience, RvRing as a Mid is only challenging when facing hordes of Albs or Hibs at once. 8 versus 40 is winnable as a Mid group, not because their tank classes are superior, but because two or three good healers can keep people healed and CC'd long enough to pick people apart 1 by 1. Now a good Hib or Alb group that blows all their uber RA's can beat a good Mid group, but those are few and far between. No one can rip apart a zerg like a Midgard gank group and that is due entirely to healers being so powerful in the right hands. And I hear there aren't many &quot;right hands&quot; in Nordic Steel &lt;snicker&gt;.<br>
<br>
Please don't try and get condescending with me, I have played both classes and am approaching this objectively. I have no reason to say the things I say other than the fact that they are accurate and true. My main characters are all Mids, I just see things how they are. After 11ish million RPs in all 3 realms, I have a pretty good idea of how things play out.<br>

You must play against some of the worst enemies in the game.<br>
<br>
healers are just as susceptible to interrupts as any other non QC class.  you interrupt all three, they have 1 15 second moc window a piece, at best.<br>
<br>
you won't have Everyone CCed, especially in an 8 v 40 fight.  between purge and people moving around, you can't CC and heal at the same time, especially with a caster Ae nuking  you a bard hitting you with amensia or a minst spam mezzing you.  seeing as you haven't experienced this, and didn't understand the minst concept earlier, i'm inclined to believe you haven't played against very hard opponents.<br>
<br>
Sure, you could blow those instas you have tucked away.  but that only does so much.  Healers are very killable, at least a bard can provide his own end and kite people better.  healer is just a PF target when they try to kite<br>
<br>
  as for having 11 mil rps, there was a zerker on igraine who has over 2 mill. he got them from owning an account in both realms and farming.  Fighting against a bunch of clueless noobs isn';t much different. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://bellsouthpwp.net/d/o/donatea/x/sig-auren.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=singdemsong>Singdemsong</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://camelot.dragonzones.com/sig/ns.jpg " BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Participant</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/3/04 6:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=767.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://camelot.dragonzones.com/sig/ns.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Slig, you obviously have little to any experience with a healer.<br>

<br>
I am not trying to make midgard out to be anything.  You made a stupid statement in this thread (that healers are godly) and I called you on it.  You appear to have something against healers for no justifiable reason.<br>
<br>
Healers do not have the best overall crowd control.  Bards mez is longer duration, sorc mez is longer range, duration and radius.  Bards also have instant amnesia to interrupt healers.    <br>
<br>
What happens when a healer mezzes a group of hibs that have a druid?  Group purge is the answer.  Guess what happens then?  All those pets and hibs have the healer targeted.  <br>
<br>
This doesnt happen when a bard mezzes Mids or Albs.  As such, Bards are more effective at crowd control.  Not only are bards the best mezzers in the game, they provide buffs, adequate heals, speed, and endurance regen.  Sure the heals may not be as good, but they are a lot better than the speed or endurance that your godly healer provides the group.<br>
<br>
Regarding your comment about my guild, we have some of the best healers on our server.  I know what a good healer is capable of doing.  <br>

<br>
I think the point you are missing is that the number of group abilities a class brings to a group doesn't mean it brings **more** to a group. The CC contribution alone of a Healer is more important than a BArd's CC + mediocre Healing. Add in the fact that a Healer is a FAR superior healer even with 30 Mend and your argument falls apart.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I am not trying to make midgard out to be anything. You made a stupid statement in this thread (that healers are godly) and I called you on it. You appear to have something against healers for no justifiable reason.&quot;<br>
<br>
Against them? Are you completely out of your mind? I think the class is incredible. That is because I have actually seen good players playing them. Hell, you have some good healers in your realm that put any bard on the server to shame. Nsane comes to mind.<br>
<br>
&quot;Healers do not have the best overall crowd control. Bards mez is longer duration, sorc mez is longer range, duration and radius. Bards also have instant amnesia to interrupt healers.&quot;<br>
<br>
Healers get insta stun to open a battle, 3 additional forms of  insta  CC that are useful in mid battle (not on intial CC), single target root (overlooked, but VITAL), castable single and AE stun. Sorry, but if you are going to try and tell me bards have better CC than Healers, you are a bigger idiot than your post lets on. Insta Amnesia is nice, but insta stun is better. And Bard mez is longer by 5 seconds rofl. Which translates into about 1 second on a full det tank. Sorry, doesn't fly. I can buy the comparison to sorcerers, who might be equivalent in pure CC, but suffer from survivability as well as the range issue not being a big factor when groups are cloing at speed 6 with insta stun ready. But bards? Pffft. It isn't close. Again, I have played both classes. Healers are much more powerful to play.<br>
<br>
&quot;What happens when a healer mezzes a group of hibs that have a druid? Group purge is the answer. Guess what happens then? All those pets and hibs have the healer targeted.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lol. That has nothing to do with a &quot;bard&quot; being better than a Healer. That is a realm ability balance issue, which as I have stated before, allows Hib and Alb to compete with Mid groups. That isn't an issue in a bard versus healer discussion. In any case, any hib group running with multiple pets is like Christmas. <br>
<br>
&quot;This doesnt happen when a bard mezzes Mids or Albs. As such, Bards are more effective at crowd control.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rofl nice logic partner.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not only are bards the best mezzers in the game, they provide buffs, adequate heals, speed, and endurance regen. Sure the heals may not be as good, but they are a lot better than the speed or endurance that your godly healer provides the group.&quot;<br>

<br>
Nothing is fact? Everything is laced with stupidity and ignorance? You are arguing that bards are superior to Healers. Do you understand how stupid that sounds? Healers make Midgard gank groups the deadliest groups you can assemble in DAoC (though good Alb gank groups can compete with them once every 30 mins). The fact that you have your primary CC class and primary CC class combined eliminates a ton of problems experienced by both hibs and Albs in group construction. You have the two most important roles in a group (healing and CC) combined. Now put 2-3 healers in a group and you have a ton of CC and a ton of heals, you cannot do that in other realms without hurting your group offensively. If you put 2 healers and a Shammy in a group  you can effectivelly do the job of 2 druids and 2 bards (though not quite as easily) without having to use 4 spots. That is huge. As someone who has seen it from both sides extensively, including playing the classes in question extensively, I can say that Mids have it easy when it comes to putting groups together.<br>
<br>

Lol. My Skald sucks? Grats on having half the lifetime IRS score of my skald with slightly more RPs, despite me playing a grand total of about 5 months on him. Seriously, grats. Honestly, do you really want to go this route with me? It won't bode well for you at all. From what I understand from many of your opponents, you are barely adequate and that is being kind. <br>

Or are they the same people who came to my server and couldnt hack it so they rerolled to hib and/or alb? Maybe you could ask them in study hall or send them an instant message!&quot;<br>
<br>
No, I just know your guild is kind of a laughing stock despite being one of the oldest and higher RP totalling guilds on Igraine. BD puts you guys to shame.<br>
<br>
 &quot;P.S. not sure where you are getting your &quot;lifetime&quot; IRS information, but it is not from the Herald. If you are using total deaths and realm points, you dont have a higher &quot;lifetime&quot; IRS than me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pffft. First, that information is very easy to calculate. There are many IRC programs that do it for you. The Herald exports more information than it displays. Second, my lifetime IRS is accurate. Yours is actually inflated because your character is older than the number of total deaths. So your 1K IRS is based on probably only about 2/3 of your deaths, which makes it even a bit funnier. You barely average 1 kill per death as it is.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not that it matters much to me because we play on different servers, but it is funny that you keep track of that sort of information.&quot;<br>
<br>
Keeping track of it is a matter of typing !estats Sing Igraine<br>
<br>
&quot;I also think it is funny seeing you talk about &quot;godly&quot; healers when you had 30 deaths in rvr with zero realm points last week. Maybe they were on vacation! Good thing the &quot;godly&quot; healers showed back up to help you win a couple of fights this week.&quot;<br>
<br>
My character was inactive until 2 days ago when I made one trip to Emain for around 10K RPs. I was on vacation for 14 days, so that kind of throws your argument out the window doesn't it? pffft.<br>
<br>
I told you not to head down this path. It won't bode well for you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=singdemsong>Singdemsong</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://camelot.dragonzones.com/sig/ns.jpg " BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Participant</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/5/04 3:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=767.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://camelot.dragonzones.com/sig/ns.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Still more stupidity from you Slig.<br>
<br>
For your information, I havent used my character for two years, he was cancelled for a time.  Guess your fancy little program didnt share that info with you.<br>
<br>
Regarding lifetime IRS, let me introduce you to my little friend called math.  The Herald started measuring deaths after my character was made, but if you take my total deaths and divide them by my currents rps (as you mention in your thread) it is much higher than the 1K IRS you mention.  I know division is tricky, but try a calculator.  Better yet, Ill do the math for you.<br>
<br>
2,409,706 realm points/ 898= 2683.  Sure that is inflated some, but even rps are inflated now compared to what they used to be.  Furthermore, it doesnt do much to compare IRS from one server to another because of the population imbalances.<br>
<br>
I doubt you know anything about my guild unless you play on Igraine.  Regarding BD, they try to get love on vnboards, but strike out.  They even started some stupid thread about who is the best guild in Midgard...guess what your friends didnt win.  I am happy you hold them in high regard though, being how smart you are and all.  I also know they are from your server, so maybe you have a love child with one of them.  I really dont care.  If you want to make this a NS vs. BD thread go ahead, it will just give me more laughs.   <br>
<br>
For your information, my guild is far from old.  It is the youngest one in the top 5 by far.  We also have the most rps on the server even though Mid is largely outnumbered by Hibs and Albs. <br>
<br>
Whats the excuse for your guild?  Hippo something?  Probably any guild that I can find listed on the Herald is better than your guild.  <br>
<br>
Interesting that when your character was inactive you had 30 deaths in rvr with zero realm points.  Maybe you just let your hib and alb friends farm it for rps when you are on vacation?  Or maybe you just suck? <br>
<br>
Get back to IRC you tool.<br>

<br>
I made RR2 before hitting 30. It was hard, but I did it. Why? Because speed is speed. It may not have been the fastest thing out there, but I was willing to go out and do it. Was I a speed bump in the fight? Yes. I knew I would be. But you know, I wouldnt have done it any different. I still got invited into groups, and in RVR, that is all that matters (at least to me).<br>
<br>
The class has a few good features to it, speed being our most sought after item. Im a taxi cab. I accept that fact, and I live with it. If I didnt like it, I would play something else.<br>
<br>
Recently (that being within the last 3 months), I have noticed a marked difference in our survivablity. The 15 second timers did help alot. In RVR, I can now blast casters and healers a little more often, and usually at the right times. The slight bump in HP has actually been a boon for me. Sure, it can be taken out in one hit or spell, but its one more hit I can survive now.<br>
<br>
We have problems. I wont say our class is perfect. We arent on par with Minstrels or Bards. But you know, we arent exactly on par with any one class. We dont have a realm equivalent out there, if you think about it. We arent rogue based (thus eliminating Minsts and Bards). None of the other fighter based classes have the spec lines we do. So, we are a class unto ourselves. Unique, and only to Midgard. Its hard to really cry for balance when we are a class of our own. We have nothing to compare to.<br>
<br>
And with that in mind, for what we can do and what we have, I have to say that we are a solid class with some nagging issues. The pulse drops, the RA's. Those are our worst issues. Lets fix those before worrying about anything else right now.<br>
<br>
One thing at a time brings greater results in the long run than everything at once, which could end up being nerfed.<br>
<br>
(I know people may not agree with it, but I figure I would put my thoughts up anyway. I enjoy my skald, and prolly forever will. Im here for fun, not for the ub3r ph4t l00t or mega-RP's) <p>Bays Endruhms<br>

This forum is to talk about skalds and skalds only.  When I see new posts here I keep checking them thinking there will be a useful discussion about skalds.<br>
<br>
Stara's comment about battlemaster is good.  I chose warlord for the siegemaster ability, but realistically that's the only ability in the warlord line with high or unique usefulness.  Not that the other skills are worthless, just seem to scale less effectively than other skills.<br>
<br>
And Sojouner...sigh.  I assume they designed this as some sort of &quot;transportation assistance&quot; or something.  I freely admit I have not played it or used it, but again the scale of usefulness seems extremely low.   If our choices of RAs are an issue worth mentioning in a report, then our choices of MLs also are. <p>Clapperoth Liefarg<br>

<br>
this thread is a great example of that.<br>
<br>
people think that changes made to skalds recently had some real impact.  the fact is that there was two changes only that made real impacts, and that was the lessening of the power cost and the timer of our DDs.  the 50 songs spec doing a lot more damage, as was claimed, isn't true.  the extra 60 life doesn't matter.  all that matters is the 15 second timers and lower costs so we aren't oop every single fight.  skalds are not overpowerd.  we're not even close to a minstrel.  and due to the changes we will never be.  if they had given us the faster DDs from last changes, AND shield spec, AND 2.0 points instead of 1.5, AND an overpowered RA like sos, AND an instant stun in addition to our instant mez, then we would be almost as overpowered like minstrels.  but not quite.  but some people just dont get that, as they really dont know what minstrels can or should do despite having a rank 6 minstrel.<br>
<br>
there are people here still harping about switching mastery of block for dodger.  the truth is that this does nothing substantial for skalds except make us better duelers.  and then only if you're rank 9 or above, as you need to buy purge, IP, AP3, (7,2) MoPain 2, (8,0) tough2, avoid magic 2 (8,<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> before you buy dodger.  we're already the best duelers in midgard.  and we can beat most other classes in the other realms with the notable exception of high rank minstrels.  what good does it do to make rank 9 skalds better duelers?  no good.  you're not rank 9 and neither am i.<br>
<br>
which brings us to minstrels.  the claim was made in this thread that skalds are superior in some way to minstrels, backed up with the claim that the person had a high rank skald and minstrel.  the fact is that this person doesn't know what's going on despite his ranks.  skalds have worse group support abilities, by a huge factor, than a minstrel, and at high rank skalds can't beat a minstrel one on one either.  my skald obliterates minstrels, just as all skalds do, if they're rank 4 or below.  it's a joke.  but at rank 7 it's not a joke.  and the rank 10 minstrel on my server tears me apart.  that mastery of block that everyone thinks is such ass?  well if you have mob3 like that minstrel does you block, and you block quite a bit.  it can be accurately stated that a skald is a superior assist train member, but if a minstrel was part of an assist train they would be playing poorly anyway so that is an invalid argument.  much like a skald is being played poorly if they are part of an assist train, but that is getting off track.<br>
<br>
there are a lot of people with a lot of ideas in this forum, and in all forums.  the problem is that not all of those ideas are equally vaild.  everyone is not equal, and that is not fair, but that's just how it is.<br>
<br>
hopefully the &quot;style review&quot;, whatever that is and whenever that happens, will give us a new LW type spec in midgard.  maybe even for all original mid melees.  the one i posted in the styles review would be good starting point.  i would probably even bother to play my skald for more than just farming sariloc if they would make a legitimate change like that. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.paradoxguild.com/images/phlsig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=767.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=767.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=767.topic&start=61&stop=78>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=767.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=767.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=767.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.stuckathome.com/skalded/images/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=767.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.threadControl?topicID=767.topic><img src=http://www.stuckathome.com/skalded/images/closethread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=767.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=767.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub36.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="teamskaldfrm1">General Discussion<option value="teamskaldfrm6">Bug Forum<option value="teamskaldfrm5">Test Planning<option value="teamskaldfrm4">Logs and Test Results<option value="teamskaldfrm7">Wish List<option value="teamskaldfrm9">Equipment Discussions<option value="teamskaldfrm10">RvR Discussions<option value="teamskaldfrm11">PvE Discussions<option value="teamskaldfrm12">Quest Discussions<option value="teamskaldfrm13">Informational Lists, Etc.<option value="teamskaldfrm8">Moderator Discussions</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald>Team Skald</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1>General Discussion</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br> <!-- #EndEditable -->
