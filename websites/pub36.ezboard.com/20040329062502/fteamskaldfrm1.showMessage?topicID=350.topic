<br>
______________________<br>
Bugs <br>
<br>
Damage Adder bug still exists. Perhaps upping the Duration/Frequency of all our songs to 6/6 instead of 5/5 (Like was done for the other chant classes) would fix our problem as well? Not sure why ours was changed to a different Duration/Frequency from the other classes since prior to that change, they were the same. <br>
<br>
Misfires of Damage Shouts - On occasion if you cast a Damage Shout on a mob from the outer fringes or the range (Which is very small BTW) you will see the spell effect, get a message that it has been cast, but the mob takes no damage. Since the range of the Damage shouts are so small, there is no reason why we would be out of range of a resist message. <br>
<br>
Speed Song drops when not in battle - This has been reported frequently since patch 1.50 went in. If any member of a Skald's group gets put into combat mode, the song drops for everyone in the group. This happens on a random basis, but pretty frequently. Since this was not mentioned in the patch notes as a change, we are assuming it is a bug and needs to be corrected. <br>
<br>
<br>
Requests: <br>
Perception, not fact, is causing a great injustice to the Skald class. We have become DAoC's equivalent of an EQ Druid. Everyone knows someone who plays one and how perfect as a class we are, yet cannot back it up with actual and factual data. Well the tally is in and the Skald players are just tired of putting up with it. <br>
Skalds, at release, were one of the stronger classes because of a number of issues within the game itself. Slowly but surely the Skald class has been brought down to it's current level by changes to the game environment itself (resists, armor changes, RAs). Now the Skald performs in the middle of the road as far as RvR goes. We are neither the best RvR class, nor the worst. This is a good thing, but this also leaves us in a bad position. Our class lacks the flavor of most classes and we have become a one trick pony. With our damage output being average, our range on shouts low, and our defenses few we have only our speed to rely on. <br>
<br>
I want to point out that the Skalds at large do not want changes to the Skald class that will make us the Uber class that people like to think we are, instead the loudest voices from the Skald community are asking for on thing: <br>
The Skalds want our class to be what our class is supposed to be, support melee. <br>
<br>
We have at our disposal only the Speed Song/Damage Song/Resist songs to add to our groups. Since Speed is usable only outside combat, we can only use it to get the troops to the fight. The damage song, while nice, has a very limited range which lends a Skald group open to AoE spells because we all have to stay very close together to have the effect of our Damage chant. The resist songs (without spam finally, and thank you) are broken into 6 separate chants, and therefore, don't get used very much. <br>
So these requests are being asked for by the Skald community to make us group friendly and allow us to do our jobs for our realm, and support the group. <br>
<br>
1. Song of Rest - This song is valuable, and only mildly so, to a solo Skald, and really only at lower level PvE. Something needs to be done about it to make it actually worthwhile to be used as a group friendly spell. Either the effect of the spell needs to be a pulsed heal (like a Paladin's) or it needs to be an out of combat spell with more Health regen per pulse, plus regen of Power and regen of Endurance. The out of combat version will not effect a solo Skald except in less downtime between battles. <br>
<br>
2. Damage Adder - This song needs it's range increased to a distance of 1500 minimum. Anything less than that just puts a Skald's entire group at risk. Since we are supposed to be group-friendly, 700 is a mightily group-unfriendly value. The fact that it's strongest value is 7.0 dps per second also needs to be reviewed. <br>
<br>
3. Resist songs - The current value of the resist songs and the levels they are attained at are not an issue. The fact that they have to be split into 6 different chants is. Combine these into 3 sets of 2 resists at a minimum or preferably 2 sets of 3 as was done for another support melee class. <br>
<br>
4. Rally Chant - This is a proposed new chant to be added to our BS spec. This chant will have the effect of Haste on a Skald's party. This would also not help a solo Skald, but would contribute to a Skald's value in a group. <br>
or<br>
4a. Damage Shield Chant - The ability to reflect a little damage back to the attacker. Would be a group friendly spell.<br>
<br>
5. Evade II or Boost in Spec points - Adding more Spec points per level would allow a Skald to raise his Parry defenses, or with Evade II, we could keep the current spec at 1.5 per level and yet get a needed boost to our defensive ability. Since the typical Skald specs 46 BS, 44 weapon, 17 parry and the variations from that are minimal, Evade II would compliment our lack of speccing choices, or if an increase to 1.7 points per level would allow use to raise our Parry since any deviation from an almost full BS spec would create a character that would not be much use to their party. <br>
<br>
6. Fury of the Gods Realm ability needs a complete overhaul. The return on investment is just not there. We have to spend 14 to get a skill that for 30 seconds every 30 minutes give us another damage chant. Somehow we think we could have gotten something a little better as our unique realm ability. If we are stuck with Fury of the Gods as our ability then the changes to it need to be as follows: 30 second duration/Double damage of it's current value/15 minute reuse time/10 skill points. Then at least we could see a return on an investment. Otherwise it's time to go back to the drawing board with our RA and come up with one that will compliment, not waste, our unique ability. <br>
<br>
7. Damage adder stacking needs to be reviewed for the Skald class. Our Damage adder (at its current levels) does not need to be cut in half before being added to the stacking effect. All this does is result in a sometime minor, but mostly lower overall effect of a damage chant. We cannot believe the intent of the stacking was to give us the same damage value as before the stacking. If this is the case, then why are we bothering with stacking them in the first place? <br>
<br>
In Closing: <br>
The Skald class is not everything it is made out to be. Because we can run away from a battle does not make us a powerful class. It's time that the issues stated by the Skalds at large are addressed and not passed over because of a false impression that there is nothing wrong with the class. <br>
Many classes need some work, but that does not mean the Skald class should be ignored. With all the changes to the game mechanisms, it is time that adjustments were made to the Skald class so they could benefit their realm in a more proactive way. <br>
<br>
If you want to peruse some of the general thoughts from Skalds, I am including links to 2 threads of interest: <br>

In my opinion it should be more seriously proposed (at a 1.7x scale, not 2.0 - I don't need my skald to be a thane with speed). <p>Clapperoth Liefarg<BR>

<br>
Some of you may remember my strong participation to this board a few months back before I cancelled my DAoC accounts.<br>
<br>
I had been asking strongly that we come out of the shell we created ourselfs because most people feared nerfs to our supposedly &quot;Uber&quot; class. Well, I see that in the end you did take heed and very well stated so in the introduction to your post Rosey.<br>
<br>
Skalds may have been a balanced class when I started playing them at release, but with time it became apparent that this was not the case as all other classes were overtaking us in ALL areas patch after patch.<br>
<br>
I no longer play DAoC as I have moved into a space MMORPG which I am enjoying very much right now so I will not waste time reiterating why we need to be looked at as a class but, if you are interested, use the search feature on the board for posts made my Eregil and you will see what I was saying months ago.<br>
<br>
Good luck all with this death mule. <p><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="http://users.libero.it/okandrea/EreNi.gif"></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/uroseannelottsa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Roseanne Lottsa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Skald TL</span><br>  Posts: 271<br> <font color=#ff0000>(10/8/02 12:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=350.topic&index=7>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Great Report</span><hr size=1> Hiya Eregil!<br>

I would have liked to see you propose making +BS items work like stealth, except with maybe a cap of lvl/5, but maybe there are problems with that I dont see.  Not a criticism just was wondering.<br>

They ARE useless. Why can't we have +parry on our epic armor and epic quest items?<br>
<br>
Perhaps that doesn't belong in this report, as it seems to be focused on our abilities rather than the stuff that was in the last several reports. Please don't forget that this is an issue though.<br>

<br>
One thing I thought I saw mentioned on a thread here was the short range of Skald Chants, useful in PvE, but less useful in RvR where people spread out more, to use a polite phrase.<br>
<br>
In recent patches Paladins got their Chants range increased, surely Skald Chants should be of equal range?<br>

All the other classes have gotin improvements but skalds have been left in the dust.  After takeing 5 mounths off from the game I came back a few days ago to see nothing has changed for skalds other than the fact that all the other classes have got better.  Just tonite I was at mile gate in emain when I was shot by a scout for almost 500 then back stabed by a infitrator for 620 can anyone tell me how we are supost to compeat with crap like this???? <p>Icebane

As a support melee class we really provide little support in keep defense, and a little more during keep taking (dmg add helps wacking on doors heh).<br>
  Improving the rest song would help to a degree, resist chants being combined ala Pali a smoche.  What would really improve a skald's role, and what I'd like to see would be along the lines of a better ranged aoe mezz like minstrels/bards so we could at least target a door and mezz those near.  (While i am thinking of mezz, weren't all mezzers supposed to get a remove mezz?)  Even a resurection would improve a skald's role in keep taking/defense.  With keep taking and defending being a such an important part of the game, one would believe a support class should play a much larger role. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=drgenocide>DrGenocide</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Participant</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#ff0000>(10/25/02 9:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=350.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Great Report</span><hr size=1> Clapperoth said it best.<br>
<br>
Some of us see the Skald as a Melee with support skills NOT a Support melee character.  If we wanted to be Support melee we can play minstrels.  Skalds are not minstrels.  Look at all the things minstrels can do, all the things Bards can do.  The reason we were designed with less options was because we were intended to be more melee.  I am certain that Mythic thought Thanes and Skalds to be sufficient in melee ability.  They both have fallen into this horrible hole by which they are not evaluated as a Tankable character class.  In the case of Thanes, Clerics can do more better and have more hps.  Hell, properly specced they out melee a Thane.  We are another of these classes.  If we were so powerful as people believe, we would tear through whole groups of even con.  At best, we might be able to take on a pair of low hps characters assuming mez goes off and no purge.  Purge was a huge nerf to skalds.  Mythic wake up, new options are opening for us all each day (AC2, SWG, SB, Horizons, City of Heroes)... respond to your player base or prepare to feel it in your pocketbook.  I personally thought Skalds were overpowered and Finally made one, now at level 37 I have a long battle to take an even con mob.  My armsman friend can take red con mobs and still have 2x remaining hps I have.  And I do the whole, DD DD Strike MEZ, wait wait, Strike Secondary strike DD DD, Continue til mob dies thing all the time.  Yes, I dont always pick the best mobs to fight, but a yellow con should be possible.  My armsman friend can walk (Shield specced and 1 hand weapon) is 5 levels lower than me and on can solo 3 of the same mobs and end up in the same condition I come to in ONE mob.  He blocks the hell out of them and I have MoParry2 MoBlocking2 MoPain2 AugDex2 Tirelessness, he has Tirelessness, Longwind, Mastery of Water, AugStr1.  So, what is the deal... we can not solo well, we dont group well (taxi service available).  Skalds can RUN well... that is about it.   <br>
