Im looking into it because the log file s somewhat disturbing to read. i will be sorting it out with the officers but it is confusing that gaid is a naked elf in the SS.<br>
<br>
I need to speak with him. I dont want EE grouping with darks at all. <p><html>

I have posted the following on the chivalric order website and also emailed their address, regarding this problem<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Dear Chivalric order<br>
<br>
I am sorry for the delay in responding to you about this matter (I also intend to post to your EZboard about this)<br>
<br>
I have read the logs and screenshots provided and also talked to gaidyn regarding this incident. I have warned him about how his actions can affect the guild but I have taken no other action. The screen shot provided shows gaidyn to be naked and also their is nothing to indicate he is grouped just that the ogre/troll is in shot. my caster friends in the guild have stated that the spell isn't being cast on him but the person who took the SS.<br>
<br>
Also as of the last guild meeting having checked our laws we have no formal law against teaming with darks. however we feel it is against the spirit of the guild and on that lvl we have informed everyone that please try NOTto group with darks as much as possible<br>
<br>
As much as the log of what happened paints gaidyn as an aggressor I can not reconcile that with the conflicting SS provided of gaidyn being naked. I do not see how a naked elf in range to someone whose got gear plus whatever else spells etc, could be a legitimate threat.<br>
<br>
If you have any further comments or queries please do not hesitate to contact me at Elvenempire@bigpond.com<br>

<br>
While we look forward to good guild relations, I cannot, in good faith, include Gaidyn in that statement.<br>
<br>
I will be submitting his name for our KOS list because of this incident. I had hoped that your response would be more protective of your guild's reputation. Additionally, any EE seen grouped with (for xp or for pvp) will become KOS at that instant, per our guild rules (viewable by clicking above.)<br>
<br>
I have viewed your fellow guildmates' comments that a log can be falsified and that the screen shot shows what it does. I was insulted to have our guild - one built on HONOR and CHIVALRY to be slandered in this manner. <br>
<br>
We will work guild-wide to get more accurate screenshots of Gaidyn at his &quot;finest&quot;.<br>

<br>
I am trying to keep the reputation of my guild. I can see that my post will not have pleased the offended parties. The infomation you provided me with to make a judgement on this case was contradictory in nature. I ask you to ask yourself. would any law abiding court rule the man guilty on the evdanced you provided being that it contradicted itself (SS paints a diff picture to the log). on the basis of whats been show to me i can not take much action but to remind him of his tenents as a member of the empire.<br>
<br>
Now i understnd why he is placed on the KOS list from your point of view. If you wish me to do more as guild leader of the empire you must provided me with compelling and convincing evidence. Your guild is based around chivalry and the like. that means you will not slander a person or judge him without the full facts being tabled as evidanced does it not? because i do not have these fact (you say you have more screen shots, i wish to see them). My major Q with the SS provided was the fact that he was naked (no gear/weaps) but you log says he is slashin the person for damage. As far as i know u dont slash in hand to hand combat u punch?<br>
<br>
I am sorry buffime is offended by my ruling as it is atm (i see you posted the same msg to our ezboard) but when you guys make judgements on your own members, would you convict and punish a person based on what was sent to me?<br>
<br>
I saw no slander in the comments made regarding this topic on my board, if they were taken as such i apologise on behalf of the empire. but the fact is logs can be falsified easily. everything else that was said were pretty much digs at me (1/2 the posts on that topic were by former members)<br>
<br>
I really do wish to work this grievance out between our guilds as i have enjoyed interacting with your guild so far and i wsh it to continue. if you have any more SS of that situation please do not hesitate to forward them to me at Elvenempire@bigpond.com. ! other bit of info if you could provide it to when doin this, is the races of the chivalric order involved (this would help any case u wish to make)<br>
<br>
if their have been other incidents please again contact me, im not an unreasonable person there was just not enuff information given to me to warrent greater punishment.<br>
<br>
my final satement is a query regarding your post. i have been known to leave heaps of words out of statements i make accident so would you be able to clarfy something for me.<br>
<br>
quoting your post:<br>
&quot;I will be submitting his name for our KOS list because of this incident. I had hoped that your response would be more protective of your guild's reputation. Additionally, any EE seen grouped with (for xp or for pvp) will become KOS at that instant, per our guild rules (viewable by clicking above.)&quot;<br>
<br>
Can you pleaseexplain this - any ee seen or grouped with becomes KOS? this mean as soon as u see an EE member their KOS, if CO is grouped with EE the whole goup is KOS?<br>
<br>
i just want this clear in my head is all. no agressive tones or anythng i just dont want a missed word (like i did in my original email/post) to become a bane to us both.<br>
<br>
my ruling was based not by believeing a guild member over someone else but on lack of corroborating evidance. im no lawyer but i feel if something like this happens in my guld a fair trial is to be held. i will reopen the case if provided with more evidence to corroborate the log (im sure u agre the SS doesnt atm)<br>
<br>
i do not ever intend to slander your guild i try to be honourable myself and as such i am trying to do the honurable thing in working this out<br>

<br>
thanks for the feedback. i wandered over to their boards and this has been sorted out, i talk to some of the admin for their guild in game and relations are very good between us. we dont have a bad name at this tme and i intend to keep it that way. <br>
<br>
the SS does not show anything though. i never accused her of lieing in any rsponse ive send as guild leader. i basically said &quot;i run judgments base on a court for a conviction i need convincing evidence. the log that was emailed to m is in direct conflict with the SS. as a result i couldnt take much action beyond warning the person.&quot; the accepted that and ive asked them if they have any further trouble to take it up with me personally and we will work it out.<br>
<br>
im on good terms with most of them so we should be cool in that regard.<br>
<br>
it is dissapointing to see so many high end guilds goin into the shitorium of cross teaming. its probably a necessary evil at higher lvls but it is agaist the concept of the server and i just plan have a grudge again em <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
