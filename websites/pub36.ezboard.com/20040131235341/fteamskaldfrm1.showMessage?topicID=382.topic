<br>
I spec 47 axe 46 song 5 parry.<br>
<br>
I did not have logs turned on =( so you need to look at the screens I scrolled for each on and took a shot.  I was buffed by lvl 28 aug blue con shammy buffs with my bot fixen.  <br>
<br>
Was a bard,ranger,shade all running in the gorge I mezed the ranger and attacked the bard asap.  Bard died in 3 hits the ranger mez came off he stealthed moved back shot at me and when I got to him and started to melee you can see the inf jump in.  I killed all 3 the bard released and came back with a warden just as the inf died thats why you see me attack her a second time.  Anyways true rvr dmg, buffed that is. Shammy was parked in a wooded area and in the dmg add you see is not mine is is a 3dps one from the shammy.<br>
<br>
I was using a 2hand 16.5dps 5.3spd 99%qual cleaver<br>
<br>
Here is the link of the shots.<br>

<br>
Most of the info shows how armor can change what we do.  Most of hib tanks and healers have scale and the dmg is very nice.  The other class in Hib have very nice resist to slash, later that day I fought a 50 blade master named Combat I think he was rez sick did very poor dmg but I was hitting him for like 220 (-160) ouch.  I am curious how hammers do vs hibs in general.  Often I hit anyone in scale form 350-450 damage styled depends on resist to slash and what style dmg is buffed or not.<br>
<br>
I looked up who was there except superior who must have /anon status.  He was yellow con I hit him for similar dmg to katelynn the one hit I got was not in the screen I took. =/ I go thee info from the herald copy paste here.<br>

<br>
She did not get of an insta or an attack because she died in 3 hits and she tried to run from me.  Bards never melee me why would they?<br>
<br>
Ok you assume much dont you?<br>
<br>
All that time... well I 3shot the bard that tried to run from me, took some time since I had to snare her and run her down.  By the time she died I ran back for the ranger but his mez was just going away and he restealth and the shade restealthed I got shot by the ranger after that from max range I ran over to him and I hit him too, so no pa I dont know what to tell you the guy tried to help before I killed the ranger.  WTF do you think this all took place standing still?  <br>
<br>
Thats my normal damage to scale... not &quot;unnaturally high&quot; lol.  you do know that scale is volunerable to slash right?  I hit that warden just as hard yep I dont have a screen maybe I will get some later so you can make up an excuse as to why I can't really do it.

3 hits=10 seconds or so.<br>
<br>
I can tell you why she would not run. She's got a group, that's why. What do you think single target insta-mez is for? Is it that hard to /face, insta-mez, heal heal heal, back off, let the ranger/nightshade have their way with you? Insta means instant, and 3 attacks are not instant or anywhere close to that.<br>

gisborne you just keep posting w/o reading what I said. She did try to run.  Her grp was not with her they were moving at bard speed I mezed one snared the other and she was in front she was alone but grp was spread out how can they help her? <br>
<br>
But you know everything right?  Even though you were not there...  I was just showing damage.  I dont care if you think its not realistic.  <br>
<br>
you guys talk about rude, I made a post about damage one of you says its unatural with quotes like I am some sort of lier or faking it, when indeed it is normal,  the other says they were afk idiots then goes on to say good job in the most insulting way possible.  I took the screens because I was excited that I did that.   My post was to explain what had happened, as well I stated that armor resist were a big factor in the dmg done, I even asked what crush dmg was doing to scale.  Yet, this is directed mostly at gisborne, you decide to make fun of it.  Well I think he is jealous and I am glad it is hard for you to believe, makes it all the better.  On top of that I have a feeling he cant do anything like that himself, all the talk about the hibs being stupid I would love to see an example of how you are qualified to be the judge.  <br>
<br>
And mr know it all insta mez is on a timer maybe it wasnt up?  This will be my last post here, I dont care to have this conversation.  I dont even know why I got flammed I guess I cant brag at all im my posts, my mistake.  I killed 3 yellows 2 were 50 one 49 I think thats pretty good myself, little did I know they were all idiots with crappy armor.  Sorry I came here to post my trash.  I guess thats not real rvr dmg either so ignore this post they must all be fake or &quot;unatural&quot; dmg.  <p>Pranzer GoldenHeart 50 Skald</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gisborne>gisborne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Fervent</span><br>  Posts: 169<br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/4/02 8:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=382.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Sigh</span><hr size=1> And it's not possible for your opponents to have misplayed?

maybe this is all I need to say to shut you up.  ok my opponents suck and have bad armor, what else hmm... yeah it was pure chance and luck, oh yeah the bard was probably auto running and afk too.  was a once in a life time thing ya know it will probably never happen again.  they just decided they would let me win that time.  the truth is I suck at this game and this is my first kill in 3 months.<br>

&quot;Was she afk?&quot;<br>
<br>
Legitimate question considering bards have 2 insta-mezes, she's in a group, and she never did anything but keep running....like she was afk.<br>
<br>
&quot;Can't be helped if your opponents are not on their toes....good job taking advantage of that to get some RP and a nice story to tell.&quot;<br>
<br>
Means that your opponent's non-perfect play doesn't take anything away from your victory. Good job.<br>
<br>
&quot;All I'm saying is that your opponents screwed up, but you are trying to defend them like they were helpless to your uberness and had no chance.&quot;<br>
<br>
What's offensive or unclear about this? Your opponents DID screw up. Sure, maybe she didn't have her instas up. But where's the PA from the assassin? Why didn't she turn to fight, since she had no chance to run away? A couple hits could have made the difference, not to mention that would have let the nightshade in on the fight immediately. You are getting all defensive about this. How else do you expect to win 1 vs. 3?<br>
<br>
&quot;And it's not possible for your opponents to have misplayed? No, that would be too damaging to your ego I guess. &quot;<br>
<br>
Responding to your flames quoted above.<br>
<br>
&quot;all that stuff is a personal attack, dont mind me if I get defensive&quot;<br>
<br>
No, only the last post I made was a personal attack. In response to your personal attack. Suggesting that the opponents have crappy armor or misplayed doesn't take anything away from your victory, but you seem to think so. That's your problem. <br>
<br>
&quot;you are a rude sob&quot;<br>
<br>
Hmm, another personal attack. Sorry if you didn't get the &quot;You are so freaking uber you rule!&quot; type messages you were hoping for.<br>
<br>
&quot;much of this is your opnion&quot;<br>
<br>
Of course it is. You see, I like to look at situations and see WHY things happened the way they did. I looked at your post the same way I looked at how weapon damage increases with spec, or how str affects weapon damage, or how +BS affects DD damage. Some people like to just gaze at the results and some inquire further to understand why the results are the way they are.<br>
<br>
&quot;And since you really were not there I doubt you can call anyone a bad player from looking at dmg logs.&quot;<br>
<br>
No. I can however, legitimately suggest that they (the hibs) are. If I were to show you logs where I never used any DD's wouldn't you wonder why I didn't? What about if I showed you logs where all I did was Plague, and never got off a Havoc or Evernight? <br>
<br>
<br>
Calm down man, you are taking everything the wrong way (except my last post which was meant as you understood it).<br>

Anytime anyone can take out 3 yellows regardless of the circumstances is nice work!!<br>
<br>
I do think however, this is not a common thing.  Enjoy it b/c it doesnt happen often.  You definitely had luck on your side to win, but that doesnt mean it wasnt well-played; anytime someone wins against 3 yellows = luck + well played.  Any other combination just doesnt work.<br>

They are to convinced of all the spoon fed bullshit from the vault boards, and therefor will attack anything differing from the norm ie..their 15k rp's and low lvl logs.<br>

Nice logs though, show's what a good skald can do to some pos toy makers.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Over the past few days I paid close attention to all scale dmg and it always fell in the range of 320-450 per hit.

Welcome to the &quot;I have been flamed by Gisborne&quot; board.  He has picked on all of us at one time or another.  <br>
<br>
In his defence- he does do great studies (few exceptions withstanding) and usually knows something of what he speaks.  On the other hand, he has way too much time on his hands and if his point differs from yours, will go to great lengths to show his disapproval.  Dont take it personal, I had to learn that too.<br>
<br>
Great work and grats on a successful rvr.  I cannot say the same.  My best rvr was 1 on 1 with a firbolg.  I kited him with dd/mez then he IPed.  So I ran.

In fact his questions about never getting above a 50% crit got me thinking as well and has had me looking at crit logs to see for myself.  Again I don’t dispute facts but it is the sarcastic way he says them that I find offensive.  About the bard being afk with her group leading them through the gorge, running around in circles afk, is just not a legitimate question.  It was clear in my post she tried to escape.  Check the logs again she was worth no rp, from that I would assume she had just died in rvr not exp and most likely used them trying to stay alive then, also maybe she was specked songs and heal maybe she was not a melee bard.  I killed her 3 other times that day she never once hit me.  Assassins miss pa all the time, ask one, it is hard to line up if the person you are fighting is moving and in combat with /stick.  That ranger did a heck of a lot of dmg to me with the bow because mez went off and he shot me from far.  I used IP to stay alive.  They did not suck that badly.  There are legitimate answers to your questions.  I just don’t like the sarcasm involved in all his posts.  Anywho no big deal I will find better logs for axe dmg in rvr.  <p>Pranzer GoldenHeart 50 Skald</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nattfari>Nattfari</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/11/02 2:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=382.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> running bards</span><hr size=1> Actually bards try to run away from me alot.
