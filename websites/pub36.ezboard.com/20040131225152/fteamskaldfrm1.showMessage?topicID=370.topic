<br>
All these logs come from group RvR, mostly keep taking and defense. I edited the logs to exclude non-player information so all the results are vs. other players. <br>
<br>
I am lvl 46, with 36+3 axe/46+1 song/8+5 parry. None of my stats are capped, but I was buffed a good portion of the time.<br>
<br>
Total DD damage: 5338 (-1869)/42 hits vs. 23 opponents<br>
Average resist rate: 26%<br>
Average Battle Howl damage: 143 (-49)/21 hits<br>
Average War Bellow damage: 111 (-40)/21 hits<br>
Total casts: 45<br>
Total outright resists: 3<br>
Highest resist rate: 44%<br>
Lowest resist rate: 0%<br>
<br>
<br>
I tried to analyze the melee damage in the parser but I guess they are just too hard to parse. When I compared the results of the parser vs. the actual logs they often didn't corelate so I ended up just going through the logs manually.<br>
<br>
Total opponents: 22<br>
Total number of attacks: 47<br>
Total number of hits: 30<br>
Total number of misses: 8<br>
Total number of opponent blocks: 5<br>
Total number of opponent evades: 2<br>
Total fumbles: 2<br>
Total crits: 4<br>
Number of successful Plagues executed: 9<br>
Number of successful Havocs executed: 3<br>
Number of times Damage Add hit: 14 (47%)<br>
Average damage/hit: 146 (-35)....or 146 (-29) see below<br>
Average resist rate, melee: 19% or 17% see below<br>
Average damage/DA: 45<br>
% increase of DA to damage, assuming 15% crit rate and 47% DA usage: 13%<br>
Average crit damage (actual): 86<br>
Total melee damage, including DA and crits: 5354<br>
<br>
<br>
There were some damage results that were funky. One was an intercept, so I hit the guy for 1 (+23409872) or something like that so I just zero'd out the (+) but left in the 1 damage. Another was a hit for 346 (-291) vs. someone with a shield and who I hit for just 100 or so the previous hits. I adjusted the (-) so that it was consistent with the two other hits vs. her but left the big damage in. For the average resist rate the first result is with the full (-) and the second one is with the adjusted (-).<br>
<br>
I used the parser at the following site for the DD results:<br>

In fact, it was worse because it's so old. RvR is hard to parse, apparently.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Total DD damage vs. Total melee damage (including crits and DA): 5338 vs. 5354<br>
<br>
These are within 1% of each other. I would consider this to be about the expected result considering the nature of group RvR. You often get in only one hit before your opponent dies and you spend some time moving between targets, allowing the DD's to partially recycle. This makes the instant DD's a lot more valuable than they first appear. I would expect DD damage to be proportionately lower for solo RvR since the fights are extended.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; DD resists rate vs. slash resist rate: 26% vs. 17%<br>
<br>
As expected, DD resists are higher because they can be raised with buffs. However, the conditions under which these logs were taken were more conducive to buffing since opposing groups had more time to prepare (keep assault/defense vs. just running around). I would say that the gap between DD and slash resists shown here is about as wide as it would get. So unlike some people here, I don't see DD resists as being much of a problem. <br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; DD outright resist rate: 7%<br>
<br>
This is a lot lower than I expected. It's also lower than proponents of the 50 axe template would like us to believe. <br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;% increase of DA to damage, assuming 15% crit rate and 47% DA usage: 13%<br>
<br>
My DA usage was lower than it could have been. I forgot a lot, due to my RvR inexperience. Even so, I can see that the 46 DA is more useful than increasing weapon spec another couple points. The 5 dps add would only have increased my damage by 9%, or a difference of 4%. So by getting the 46 DA I gain 4% damage vs. just 2% damage when I'm lvl 50. Of course, when I'm 50 my damage will be higher so the relative effect of the DA will be lower....but I won't be doing 2x as much damage. These results are for me alone, neglecting the effect on my group. It's pretty clear to me that going only 44 rather than 46 songs is a mistake.<br>

What is up with this? I think that something in RvR is bugged. I've seen several instances now of killing blows doing vastly more damage than other attacks. I saw it on Mance's screenshot vs. the caster he posted here and I've seen it on at least 2 other occasions.<br>
<br>
Also notice that even though I /stuck Kiedra, she was still &quot;too far away to attack&quot; on one occasion, causing me to not perform a style. This happens ALL the time in RvR. Unless you are face to face trading blows, even the slightest moving around causes &quot;too far away&quot;, &quot;not in view&quot;, etc. That's a big reason why I landed so few styles. The other is that I was ooe some of the time.<br>

Plague style %: 23%<br>

<br>
Wow, these are a LOT lower than in PvE. I don't think I had quickness buffs for any of these, and even if I did it wouldn't be nearly enough to drop the style % so low. Interesting.<br>
<br>
<br>
Just some food for thought.<br>

<br>
On your example : are you sure your target didn't have  a short duration Absorb buff (like the grossly overpowered bunker of faith) ?<br>
<br>
The bug with stick and style landing, which makes room for lame strafing, is extremely annoying and should be fixed asap.<br>
<br>
I am not surprised by the fact half of the damage come from the shouts. <br>
However you are doing apparently the same RvR the majority (I think) of skalds do, big battles, keep sieges, and zerg hordes.<br>
The most vocal defenders of the 50 weapon spec (gimped or not - I am not here to start a debate or take part in said debate) seem to be either skalds that had an early headstart in realm ranks when RA's went live, and thus can manage to solo, and/or skalds that play with regular and efficient &quot;gank groups&quot;. I pretty much understand how the way their melee and song damage is shared differently. Those are different playstyles, and a wholly different RvR.<br>

I had made a suggestion for a new type of spell that I WISH they would consider.  It would not be given to the Skald class, but would be in each realm.<br>
<br>
I mentioned a Transmute spell.  Basically the idea was if a person has this buff cast on them, their damage type would change for the duration of the buff (random or static) so what would happen is that for xx number of seconds/minutes a Skald's damage (for example) would no longer be Body but Spirit, and so on.<br>
<br>
I thought it would add a lot to the RvR tactics and keep all the classes front top loading the resists that are shared by so many classes.<br>
<br>
Would sure make it interesting, huh?<br>

i do a lot more damage than gis does with my hammer , more like ~200 to ~325 on bards and such, so it might have some impact on the #s.<br>

is the parser intelligent enough to exclude melee damage to casters?  damage to casters really throws things off.<br>

at say 90% use that would be about:<br>

50% spell damage<br>
20% DA at 47% use<br>
30% Melee + crits<br>

<br>
50% DD damage<br>
7% DA damage at 47% usage<br>
43% weapon and crit damage<br>
<br>
I should point out that I did not include procs in this analysis. Mainly cause I forgot, but also because not all weapons have procs making the data more generally useful....ok I forgot <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
Total procs: 2<br>
Total proc damage: 148 (-4<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

With the resists, it's important to remember that the 26% body resist doesn't come all from items and such. It's people who have buffs that improve their body resist. Actually, considering there is only a 9% gap in body/slash resist people might have higher slash than body resist w/o buffs. When SC comes out, more people will presumably have max resist in body/slash. However, that is not going to change the number of people who have body resist buffs while fighting. I think that this 9% gap will remain about the same when SC comes out. Thus people who claim our DD's much less useful due to the resists are....exaggerating.<br>
<br>
As I pointed out, someone who does solo would have a different ratio of DD damage/melee damage. I'm not so sure that a well-honed gank group would be that different though, since it probably includes some CC and lots of people attacking one player...in other words you get one hit in before he dies.<br>
<br>
I included all melee hits in the logs. That's why my melee damage may appear to be low. Not only did I not get styles off over half the time, but there were also several hits where BoF or similar was used. I included them becaue it wasn't my goal to see how much damage I could do vs. non-BoF'd people, but to see how much melee damage I averaged overall in RvR scenarios. Some of those scenarios included, and should include, groups using BoF.<br>

Your low weapon spec and level and only using a 25% bonus ( is it?) axe gimp your melee dmg.<br>
<br>
If your going to not use high end styles, player crafted weapons, and suffer from the hinderance of your lvl, then of course your better off doing dd dmg.<br>
<br>
If you think your spec is good for your play style then you've found the right one for you, thats all that matters. <p>&lt;center&gt;<br>

<br>
I was using a Screaming Ghastly Axe, which is as good as an Arcanium War Cleaver at lvl 46.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Your low weapon spec and level and only using a 25% bonus ( is it?) axe gimp your melee dmg.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes. I'm not lvl 50 as I stated before. The axe, and the low weapon spec are all consequenses of that. You really expect me to have max weapon spec at lvl 46? I'd truly be a gimp then. As I already stated the axe is as good as an Arcanium War Cleaver at lvl 46. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;If you think your spec is good for your play style then you've found the right one for you, thats all that matters.&quot;<br>
<br>
My spec is called the &quot;I'm only lvl 46&quot; spec. I thought that was very clear from the beginning of this thread.<br>

<br>
You shouldn't jump to very many conclusions based on your logs since your only lvl 46.  Despite what Mythic says, levels are king in RvR.<br>
<br>
Your logs etc are good info, but aren't really any indication of what you'll be doing at lvl 50 with maxxed stats, epic armor, better weapons, and a boat load more skill points. <p>&lt;center&gt;<br>
