Old schoolers remember what that was like.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I was wandering around Odin's for nearly an hour solo and unbuffed, and hadn't seen another person out there.  /sigh.  After a while of camping the amg I saw several feet coming through... so first instinct was to run and hide.  So I ran to the side of the mg and they ran through without seeing me.  It was three of them, 2 clerics (one RR6 the other RR4), and a wizard (RR2) who I'd never seen before.  Out of boredom of not finding anyone else to fight I decided to at least kill one of them before dying and get some rps for my time.<br>
<br>
I ran up behind them, and mez the RR4 cleric.  Woot.. it actually stuck.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Woot.. he didn't purge it.  The RR6 cleric who was leading ran about 15 ft further before she realized what was happening.  I jumped on the wizard, and managed to drop him in about 5 swings and two sets of DDs.. It was quite a bit of luck in that I resisted the clerics stun, and the wizard (ice) was actually a blue con (lvl 44) and had very little body resist and I was outdamaging her heals.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
After that I started to run away to savor my victory and get away alive.. but for some reason I went back to finish the fight.  I guess I was feeling suicidal; or afraid of the boredom of not finding another soul out in OG for the next hour.. still unsure.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I burn an endurance totem and run back to fight the two clerics.  The RR6 lands a stun on me which I immediately purged and in turn mezzed her.  Woot.. a second mez stuck.  Woot she didn't purge.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   At that time I start on the RR4 cleric.. Woot.. ZERO body resists!!!  I force him to use his instants.  Still no BoF.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Unfortunately the RR6 cleric became unmezzed before I could finish him off and she started smiting me and healing the other cleric.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I burned IP and stayed on the RR4 cleric, while interrupting the RR6 cleric with mez/snare/dd/dd.  She had burned her instants, and had started to rest to get power... I might actually get a second kill on the RR4.  I get him to around 5% life when she stands up to heal him.. I switch to her for one swing to ensure interrupting her, and then switch back to the RR4 for the killing blow.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   At this point I'm elated at my two kills and 1600 rps.<br>
<br>
For some reason the cleric decided to mez me at this time, burned MCL and rezzed the ice wizzie... who was kind enough to pbae me.  I thanked him with a swing of my axe and dropped him a second time.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   After that it was me and cleric, her with no instants, me with no end.  After a couple ablative procs I finished her off about another min later for another 1000 rps and with 30% life left.<br>

Ran into a trio of Hibs at the Albion Milegate who were watching the other way, a blademaster, eldrich and enchanter.  I mezzed the eldrich, took out the enchanter quickly while they were still surprised, then mezzed the blademaster and killed the eldrich.  I would almost have thought the eldrich was afk from it's low activity, but it seemed to try and cast a couple times.<br>
<br>
We've all had good experiences with casters though, so while this was a nice combination of events (surprise, plus mez working well) the real fun was that I hit FA II and downed an end potion just in time for the blademaster to come out of mez and engage me.  It was a medium length battle but I was able to beat him without using IP (he was of low realm rank and I'm RR6).  I camped the bodies for a few mins, and since they didn't release I went in search of their rezzer and found him (a bard, standing for some reason in the middle of the road) and did my job.<br>
<br>
Soloing for me has been exciting the last few weeks, but then I haven't done it in awhile so part of that is stretching mental muscles I haven't used in awhile.  I die often enough, but I've had some good victories.<br>
<br>
In groups, well...If I'm in a good group and successfully /assist the main melee damage dealer I do well, but otherwise I run into one of the old skald problems:  I often drive, so I'm the first one targeted by the enemy, and go down quickly.  Anyone in that situation generally does, but it's sometimes an instantanous thing. <p>Clapperoth Liefarg&lt;BR&gt;<br>

With some of the new tactics of stun first and mez second this has been even worse on skalds I have seen many trying to fight on the fringe of battles now get mezed after being stuned. More and more we seem to be taxi’s to the fights, but once their we are fodder not getting heals. Quote “effective tanks need my heals” seems to be the healer catch for skalds and fighting on the fringe of battle because of less buffs from shaman of the same mind set does not help also. <br>
<br>
Now unlike the 2 above I don’t run solo, I don’t have a pocket buffer or healer I can use one account only, so I don’t travel alone, with scouts new skills it is hard not to run into a archer waiting to pick a fight. 2 times I was killed after 1.62 by scouts.  The scout seems to get better and better while hunters get worse and worse. <br>
<br>
In large battles skalds who fall are often passed over for tanks for rezes first and when resed often I get the cheep rez now instead of one where I can fight back without rest. I have gone to carrying potions to make up for my short comings and proc’s on throw away weaponds that have more range then my normal spells, which is very disheartening.<br>
<br>
In the last; day long battle I fought in, I spend well over 1 plat in proc’s and potions to supplement what I use to get from the groups I was in and add some spells at range so I felt I was adding to the fight. <br>
<br>
I think unless the &quot;powers that be&quot; fix my class I will move games to Planetside or SWG I just don’t like the monthly changes of our class system and the building of new toons because of it.  free 30 or no free 30<br>

If I am to just pick a few of those moments, some good and some bad, this is what I can come up with.<br>
<br>
Logged on at hib gate in Odin's one night and saw an unstealthed NS standing there in a corner. Of course I was unbuffed at the moment but I had IP up and would get the jump so I decided to go for it. Thought I'd start off with a DD, DD, Assault and then snare and run like the kobold I am but one DD was resisted, the assault missed and the snare didnt land. Doh!<br>
Tried with a mez but that one didn't seem to stick either. So there I was, fighting the best I could with a NS. Managed to get him to about 70% at least even tho I blew IP. Felt kinda nice after that. Took me a week or so before I even thought about logging on again.. Not because I lost but because it felt it was no way that I ever could beat a (hopefully) buffed NS in face up melee..<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I think the fondest memory I have of 'lil Gnishy was when he and the old and slow berserker Serion was roaming Odin's and jumped and killed four albs at AG. I beleive there were two tanks there, one cleric and some caster. We had both used up our IP and FA. He also blew his Purge in that battle. It was one of those battles when you feel like your certain to die a hundered times but manage to make it and take them all out instead.<br>
We met in RL a few days later and talked about that incident. Turned out we both had a hard time coming out of that trip afterwards.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Of course he did his 600+ swings on the poor things while I was swinging away at some 150's but still.. It was a night to remember.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anyway, today I canceled my account after playing Gnish for a year and a half. It feels kinda strange but since I have lost interest in playing there is no point in paying Mythic any money either. I will of course be watching the progress of the game and of the skald class and hopefully one day return.<br>
Rosie, you do good! The skald community is lucky to have a TL like yourself!<br>

But you were both extremely lucky that your enemies did not have Purge up.  The second story, where you landed the second mez, means 20 seconds passed before the other two were aware that you were killing one?<br>
<br>
As a RR6 skald, I faced a RR2 blademaster.  It was a group on group battle.  I have no doubt we were both fully buffed.  In the 30 seconds it took him to kill my healer, I was free to dd/dd/axe him from behind (he was mez immune).  I had 4 misses due to evade, and landed 2 axe blows for 200 (-100).  When he turned to face me, he ripped me apart in less than 10 seconds.<br>
<br>
Against any Friar 1-on-1, if I do anything besides run away, I am dead.  Friars kill fast.  And they evade most swings.<br>
<br>
The worst RvR happens again and again.  It happened last night just past MMG.  We exit MMG with a group of 8, and a group of Hibs swoop down.  Our healer mezzes, they group purge and mez most of us (or they win CC off the bat).  The MoC PBAoE enchanter rushes up.  I purge mez, and I am promptly stunned as I try and back off from death.  3 casts of pbaoe later, 600x3, less than 5 seconds, and 6 of us are dead.  The cast time on a fully buffed caster is now less than 2 seconds now that stat caps from buffs can shoot above 300.  You might say he is done for 30 minutes.  Well, sure, but it takes 15 minutes to get back, and they have 3 chanters per group, so they can kill us again and again all night.<br>
<br>
When we run with 3 skalds, which is rare but happens, none of us run Dam Add.  Most perceive it as worthless.  We run speed and 2 resist songs.<br>
<br>
If I can not argue for light tank status, i.e. enough melee skill to hit a R2 BM from behind or enough to matter in a battle, then at least give me some support tools that make a difference.  Once a battle starts, none of our songs matter.  I would trade all songs except speed for the ablative chant.<br>
<br>
I still do not get why Minstrels were gven climb walls and ablative.  They must have been in need of a population boost?  On most servers, are Albs starting to just rip off door3 of a relic keep?<br>

edit:  Gnish made a good point.  I was leaving mpk alone, to join my guild who were all at mmg.  I know the risks, but had purge/IP up.  As I was running at speed, an arrow hits and slows me down.  Knowing the dangers of facing any scout/inf/ns/ranger as a skald, I ignore the arrow and start to sprint to try and get away, but somehow the scout lands a stun on me.  I am forced to purge the stun as he lays into me.  I purge without hesitation, buffed to 1800 hps, and I /face and mez.  Mez lands but he purges, so we fight.  He evades one swing, and about to die I use up IP.  He continues the onslaught so fast I can not try to snare and run.  I am dead, he is at 90% health.  I am not asking to win fights.  But given roughly 3500 hps, I would like to have had him down below 90%.  Even with capped stats and capped buffs, I have trouble hitting equal rank classes with evade.<br>
<br>
I would like to be able to melee an evade class, use IP and purge while they use nothing, and get them down more than 90% (do more than 10% damage).<br>
<br>
I have plenty of examples where I use mez/snare/sprint/end potion to successfully run away.  So yeah, I can often escape, which is something I guess.  Then I get to spend 30 minutes of RvR without IP/Purge, and lately I rely on IP as my in-battle way of living long enough to get RPs, because healers can't afford to heal me over savages/zerkers/warr unless they use/have spread heal.  They do give me the post battle rez, but by then one already might have missed 3k and that leaves a real bad feeling in your tummy.  Hey man, nice long fight, whew I think we all made 5k (cough, yeah, except me, but hey I'll bring you to the next fight, at least I have speed and you need me in your grp alive long enough to make the next fight).<br>
<br>
When I /assist the savage, and the enemy fails to cc us, then I get to see some great 2h axe damage (the savage tore through the enemy bubble).  That can be fun.  It's only casters who get hurt by me though.<br>
<br>
I still love playing a skald, because I am needed for speed, so at least I get a group.  And I can always follow if I don't get a group.  I may be getting ineffective in battle, but getting to battle is a plus. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ororo7>Ororo7</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0> at: 6/19/03 3:44 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=roimma@teamskald>Roimma</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Participant</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/19/03 8:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=640.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RvR experiences of Skalds</span><hr size=1> I play pendragon...so my expierences are probalby different from most peoples. Most the time by the time I actually get to the frontier I've missed all the action, and I just end up camping AMG in emain waiting for a few who come back to try again.<br>
<br>
Defending DC a little bit ago was a fun expierence. There were about four of us defending against 1.5-2 groups. There were two infs running around the inside of the keep who kept on killing me or the casters(I'm only level 45). The bots would come down and rez us, we'd find and kill them. I just remember the first time the SB tried to attack me I was standing in front of one of the climb points, he attacked me, and I parried the blow. He jumped down and restealthed. It was great time trying to defend against them, even though our efforts failed.<br>
<br>
Other RvR expierence I had recently was I was fighting in DF(DF was open to everyone) and I was fighting a tempter, pretty close battle but I was going to win, when a minstrel popped up and insta stunned me. The minstrel realized I was going to die if he left the tempter, so he killed the tmpter for me. Then I mezzed him(revenge...sort of), sat and rested. Then we hugged and he whent on his way. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Roimma - the cutest kobold skald on pendragon ^_^</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kjeld>Kjeld</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Fervent</span><br>  Posts: 323<br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/20/03 8:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=640.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Well</span><hr size=1> My most embarassing experience was me, plus one level 50 (low RR) bonedancer, plus 2 level 40ish bonedancers (aye, PK leftover groups are often weird). I think we were vaguely buffed with low baselines by a low level bot. The 4 of us, plus the army of pets, against 1 (one) hero, RR8 I think ?, the top hero of our server. Apparently, he was unbuffed (no buff spam at death).<br>
He attacked us, we were not surprised.<br>
I wont give you a full recount of the battle, but he killed, one by one, the three bonedancers - and suppr BD are not really easy to kill. I finally killed him with one sliver of health left, with both FA, MCL, and IP used (he, of course, used moose and IP). Almost the whole time, I had the opportunity to use positionals to help my dps. <br>
Of course, all of us badly messed up, there were tons of things we could have done better, but my dps was pretty sad on this one <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
My experiences with alb groups is very bad since the sorcerer love patch. Unless my group manages to completely surprise the opposing group, my chances to interrupt the sorcerer casting mez-bolt has changed from fair to very low.<br>
<br>
I have had fun recently on keep sieges, and one time on bledmeer keep defense, but in each and every instance, I had a siege weapon. My cash is running low, and frankyl, I really envy classes that can make a difference in those situations for &quot;free&quot;.<br>
<br>
General RvR gank group, it's either very good or very bad, depending if I am invited by friends in exclusive gank groups, or doing pickup with the left out at pk. I seem to rarely make a difference (in fact, the one making a difference is consistently the healer, or sometimes the shaman, if he happens to have ichor). My added value often comes form my regular panning of camera to notice archers or casters hidden at the fringes of the battle. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=clapperoth>Clapperoth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Contributor</span><br>  Posts: 87<br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/20/03 12:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=640.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well</span><hr size=1> &lt;&lt;---also doesn't have a buffbot.

Running solo was not a guarantee of a win by any means, but it was much easier to get around enemy frontier solo at that stage, and there weren’t any 1 on 1 fights I avoided.  I am 6L1 and have IP, Purge, the standard passive RAs, incompletely SC’d armor—possibly to be completed soon <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  –100% PC/SC sword and so forth.<br>
<br>
At the time I recall a number of fun RvR experiences.  Once at HMG in OG, I was running to suicide and a celt Bard and Champ duo came running through at the same time.  I waved, and kept going, but saw them turn and come after me.  On the other side of HMG, I mezzed Champ, and Bard for some reason started running from me—maybe was a bot duo played by 1 person, but both were RR5 at the time and I was probably RR4.  Champ did not purge, and I snared Bard and followed him DD’ing and hitting him in the back until he dropped…maybe he thought he’d survive until Champ broke free, or thought he would get a burst of speed in and get out of range, dunno.  Then I turn to Champ, he fights back.  Toe to toe fight, I am out of endo after getting some back with a bounty potion after Bard dropped.  I use some snare to buy time and so forth, I had high parry spec at time and no IP, but finally dropped him, got about 1800 rps from that little battle.<br>
<br>
Another fun spot was the zone wall going from Beno toward Pennine, there frequently would be a stealther right along rim of zone as I ran through, usually would drop them if they were just sitting there waiting for me to go past.  FS was a huge amount of fun, often would find people running along road to ambush, had some good fights.  Also, Alb dungeon HoC was a great spot, could have some fun and usually drop someone even if a group would come through, occasionally more if I waited until they were on a mob!<br>
<br>
Now with respec to include IP/Purge, lesser parry, game changes, I rarely solo by choice…there are classes I used to be able to have long fights with that slap me down regardless of what I do.  Players of most classes with a name I recognize, unfortunately, are encounters I avoid many times, whereas I jump in on any class with a new name in hopes they don’t know what they’re doing.  This can be a mistake. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So most of my RvR is in groups now, and most of my groups are with guild or friends I have played with for a year or more and so I can’t comment on whether group invites come a skald's way very much these days.  However, I am usually /assisting in order to have much impact aside from interrupting or dropping someone with a sliver of health left.  If I get caught alone while others are working elsewhere, I am an easy target because my defense has become laughable versus so many classes who /evade and /parry me like hell while I am standing there waiting for another miss with my 2H.  With 202 Cha and 46 BS, my DDs have still continually declined in effectiveness.<br>
<br>
My favorite thing in group RvR early in my career was the use of speed to get into the enemy backfield and take out casters.  Now, I don’t for two reasons:  1)  speed is interrupted by so many things now—I imagine if a Hib inside Hibernia kills a water beetle, a skald somewhere has his speed interrupted; 2)  even with maxed magic resists, multiple casters mean I interrupt one and the others kill me—they don’t even have to get melee on me anymore.  I also used to be able to run quickly to the back of a pack and then pull an enemy who would /stick me back to our tanks.  Now, I die before I get close to help.  <br>
<br>
I used to use speed to run down and finish an enemy fleeing a group encounter.  Now, if I don’t have help, this is typically a poor decision.   I used to hit and crit well with my melee solo vs. rogues (MoPain II, was III at one point)…now they hit too hard and too often for an unbuffed skald, especially, to do much good.  Purge and IP are down, odds are poor.  <br>
<br>
What I miss most, perhaps, is being a priority target…it was fun running with a great healer or two who would key on me as I was hit by 2 or 3 opponents and being one of the last to stand.  Now, when I am one of the last standing, I believe it is because they know they can leave me ‘til last because I am less of a threat than most other classes.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I miss being able to get on a target hitting our healer/caster and actually giving him a reason to turn around and deal with me before killing my teammate.  I miss kiting.  I miss…<br>
<br>
Well, sorry this wasn’t all RvR stories as requested, but I’ve never posted much here and thought I'd share.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Hope we get more reason to play our class soon.<br>

If I could recall far enough back I could probably hoist out the good experiences. At this time I really can't recall. <br>
<br>
I'm level 50, RR5 *not that it truly matters any longer*, I'm not here to whine about disparity or changes. However, to look at current RvR experiences. Invited to a group, sure...as they call for a taxi. Each of us apparently plays a role, and this is the skalds only role at this time. My previous role was to target casters...you know those folks wearing those funny robes. Now when I do, I run up *and besides from dying before much happens* it's &quot;you miss&quot;....4-5 times in a row. It's a humbling experience. <br>
<br>
Another role besides speed, and  perhaps attempting to take out a caster, is to finish off someone before they can hit IP. While our RM's or SM's or a beserker or thane is smacking away, I can use a DD for a rapid finish while assisting.<br>
<br>
I'm left as last to kill as the skald above me indicates. And yes it's because I'm no longer a threat to much of anyone unless they stub their toe on me. I'm just a &quot;hybrid tank&quot;, and in groups settings *which I try to remain in* I'm someone to throw themselves at the masses so another player can actually remain upright and do some slaying. <br>
<br>
Any actual damage I do is mostly thru DD's anymore and we all know how that is. Sad really, to play a skald was an honorable thing. Your skald in the group had to get you safely from Point A to Point B. I took pride in being able to know my way around the frontiers, at a young level. That ability is something I still have.<br>
<br>
Perhaps as a skald I just need to refigure out what my roll is. I still know my way across those snowy hills of Midgards vaste wasteland, the green lush grasses of Hibernia, and Albions sloping, winding trails, I just don't travel them as much as I use to. I dare not, I can not, I might be slain by someone blue to me. /sighing heavy heartedly <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~mhenry00/sojou250.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
