If there is one thing I hope, it is that the experience of being a member of the mighty Menage, gave you as much pleasure as it did myself. Also I hope you all come away with an appreciation of what true family a guild should always be. Unlike Maglor, I feel that I will never again be able to join a guild in any game, unless it is as perfect as ours was.<br>
<br>
As most of you know I was away for a long time due to some difficult RL things. When I returned I felt like the spark had gone out of Norrath, As it did so many years ago on a small island north of France, when the old ways gave in to the new. It has become painfully obvious to me that norrath, aye not even Qeynos, needs me anymore. And if there is one thing a paladin needs, besides Karanas rain on his face, it's to be needed.<br>
<br>
I have heard much of a realm that may be in need of a paladin of the old ways, and have decided to travel there and see if this is in fact true. And perhaps even rebuild a Steel Menage there.<br>
If the Norrathian Menage is to survive, it will require leadership, I have instructed my squire Johe to stay behind and hand over this leadership to whoever feels they may be such a leader, and then he is to follopw me into the mysts.<br>
<br>
Know this, I have never appreciated, and respected, nay, loved, a ragtag group of adventurers as I have each and every one of you, the trully impossible concept that is the Steel Menage was made a reality because of you all.<br>
But now a thunderhead has formed on the horizon, and I somehow know that I must follow it to my new calling.<br>
<br>
The mighty Karana bless and keep you all.<br>
In the near future, before I leave the confines of Norrath once and for all, I will call out to you all one last time, and I pray you will come and accept the few belongings I have so they can be used against evil in my absense. For I must undertake this quest with nothing but my wits. <p>Rafferty Thunderheart
Paladin of the mighty Karana

Though Ah know ye not yet in person, Ah styll feel the vigour o' pryde in mae 'eart an' the wetness o' tears on mae cheek an' mae chin.  Welle sayde sir Rafferty!<br>
<br>
Ah am Grymwyll, an' in case ye may, er may nay woot (know) Ah am the 'umble paladin who took in Ezmeres when 'e transcended realms an' found 'is way into Albion. <br>
<br>
(but the same person who played Ez, Grymstout, Aertemis and etc...)<br>
<br>
Let mae juste sayeth that ye are entirely ryghte that all goode things must endeth.  Ah know from lore an' per'aps 'istory that even the epic myghte o' Arthur's Rounde Table cayme te end, an' all that is left in Camelot is a shadow o' its former glory.<br>
<br>
Greede, selfishness, an' thus the corruptibility o' the 'uman ( er elven, er any sentient creature) soul spawns an' lives either in ful force or in the shadows o' e'ery civilization or society that exists.  Therefore it is up te us te constantly fyghte this corruptibility by strivin' inwardly te become as ful o' virtue as conceivably possible.<br>
<br>
Nay one man nor woman can fyghte the battle o' our secret demons insyde by ourselves.  Thus we look te 'ave friends and build a network o' support when we are nay as morally strong as we liketh.<br>
<br>
(ooc) I guess what I am driving at, Tim, is if you do decide to play DAoC it would make me most honoured if you were to join Grymwyll and Ezmeres on the Percival server in the realm of Albion.  Grymwyll is in a young small guild ( only 10 strong) who looks to become more involved ( eventually) in raids and RVR... the guild, The Order of the Old Code, is headed by Voltare Dumonde who would have fit in the &quot;Menage&quot; mentality had he played EQ on the Brell server.  <br>
Voltare chaired our first guild meeting last night in which out of the meeting the guild decided that in order to become a force and fight the evil that is in and out of the borders of Albion, The Order of the Old Code must have not one or two strike teams, but several.  As this was agreed by everyone in the guild, Voltare promoted each of the members as officers of the guild and blessed us with the ability to invite recruits into the guild...of course these recruits  are only initiates for a certain length of time before the officers give a vote on whether or not the member is &quot;old code&quot; material.<br>
<br>
Since I am not one who is a powerleveller, nor one who builds an army in one or two days, I feel as though those of you who are interested in the Steel Menage to play DAoC have a most open invitation to join Grymwyll in building as &quot;Menage&quot; strike force! <br>
<br>
The Old Code needs virtuous and selfless folk who enjoy roleplaying so to Tim, (and others of course) I give a call to arms!  Ye fayte o' Albion rests upon thee!<br>

<br>
&quot;Friends...I have found the way...followed the essence of Ezmeres across the dream-sea...found a portal into Albion...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Im going after him now...dont know if this will be a one way trip or not...but I'm leaving a trail for you to follow if you so wish...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Do not underestimate the danger...its not an easy crossing...it means forsaking everything you own, both materially and spiritually... Karana can no longer hear me in this void, and all my powers are useless....  It will be the same for those who follow...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The elementals and magick I have sought mastery over for so long will be beyond my reach... I must rely purely on the force of my own will from this point onward...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;...but I believe the sacrifice will not be in vain. Ezmeres would not have made this journey lightly...I believe Albion needs us...<br>
<br>
&quot;...I go now into that realm...through the unstable portal that connects both Albion and Norrath...it will only stay open for one lunar month, until the next new moon...when it closes, I will be unable to travel between the two planes, and must choose where to make my home...&quot;<br>

 I have thoroughly enjoyed my time in the Steel Menage, and my thanks go out to Rafferty and his squire Johe for inviting me into the fold almost 2 years ago...<br>
 As you said, all good things must come to an end. In my mind, no guild will ever compare to us...however, I have high hope for our future on DAoC in the realm of Albion on the Percival server.<br>
 There is indeed a thunderhead on the horizon. A new challenge awaits us all, I think. <br>

  Im going in! <br>

I am wittled down to the core by my arduous journey, but I am still a proud paladin, and I will pull myself up by my boot straps as I have so many times before. It certainly seems that the Britons need my help, and I am proud to provide it as best I can. I am in a Reality known as Percival, Unfortionately Johe was misdirected during his crossing and landed up in an alternate reality known as Igraine. He was quick to make a wizard friend however who informed me of this through what means, I do not know. No word as to Zigzigs fate, but I am sure the lummox will surface. Due to the strange linguistics of this place the locals insist on spelling my name Raffertty, and from what I here Johe has run into the same problem, apparrently he is now known as Jhohe. Please look me or him up should you get the chance.<br>

Always yours Truthfully, and still following Karana's wisdom although he prefers to be nameless here...<br>

 A rough crossing indeed. And one that changes you, in subtle ways that I have yet to grasp a full understanding.<br>
<br>
 I arrived, disoriented, almost unable to move and speak, in the grounds of a Tower named Lethantis...a place where sorcery was regularly woven, I was later to discover, and where the veil between worlds was thin enough to let me through... <br>
<br>
 I collapsed amongst the trees, struggling for breath in the alien air... I may have perished there if not for the aid of a kind passerby - he was a young man, tall and thin, with pure white hair tied back in a ponytail. He saw my distress and helped me to my feet, guiding me toward the nearby tower...<br>
<br>
 The mages of Lethantis took me in at this stanger's behest, and nursed me back to health...perhaps more out of scientific curiosity than compassion...<br>
<br>
 Anyway, within the week, I had regained my senses enough to speak and walk, and even affect a few minor magics under the tution of the curious mages.<br>
<br>
 Here is where my greatest pain lies. Every night I tried to commune with the source of my power, to draw strength from the elemental force of the Stormbringer, Karana... yet to no avail. I could not summon a candle flame, let alone an Elemental.<br>
<br>
 Whether this was due to my lack of faith, or the barrier of the void between worlds, I know not...Karana could not hear me, and I could not reach him. I was almost powerless...<br>
<br>
 Yet I had my Will. The power of 45 seasons of Magecraft still burned in my mind. I found I could move small objects with concentrated thought...that I could make minor manipulations of the essence of this realm through Willpower alone...<br>
<br>
 The mages of Lethantis guided me down this path they called Sorcery...and began my training there as an Apprentice.<br>
<br>
 I was soon to meet Ezmeres, and Grymwyll, and later become an Initiate of the Order of the Old Code...<br>
<br>
 But still I need to find and thank the young man who saved me on my first night in Albion...I remember him saying his name was Slainthe...a squire in the service of Lord Adribard...<br>
<br>
 If you see him, tell him I am grateful.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
/OOC<br>
 Ashborne can be found near Lethantis in the Campacorentin Forest. He's currently a 6th level Sorcerer.<br>
 Ive created a few other characters to play around with, including an Avalonian fighter named Slainthe that I plan to make into a Paladin. <br>
 Slainthe may become my main character here, depending on which I enjoy playing the most...so look out for both these guys on your travels in Albion!<br>

I'm sure that there is more than one person in this family (we may not be a guild anymore but family goes on) snickering at your ability to get lost even with a compass <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
I tried DAOC for a while but it just did'nt hold my interest since at that time only a few of the family had migrated over and they were spread out between several servers. I would'nt mind joining up now that more of you are playing (on a rp server no less) but my time is very constrained due to the fact that I'm also in school now. You may see me in the future though when I free up some time. I'll probably be playing a sneak rather than a ranger. I know Palidens and thieves should'nt get along But... you can always think of me as a sneaky scout with a very bad attitude.<br>

My heart and my pride bubble with joy knowing that you have made it to Albion!  <br>
<br>
I'll fill you in on the going-ons as far as Miggs, myself, the Cu Mor Glas a Bhais (Rygore) and Grymwyll.<br>
<br>
Grymwyll found a home (perhaps only temporarily) in a guild called the Order of the Old Code.  It can be found on <br>
<br>
http: // home.wi.rr.com/oldcode<br>
<br>
He has attained the 20th season of experience and seeks to get only stronger.<br>
<br>
Rygore is a little more inexperienced (but still going strong) at lvl 16..he too is in the Order, but he may be higher now as he has found an online friend who is power leveling him like mad!<br>
<br>
Ezmeres is lvl 9<br>
Miggs is around that lvl too.<br>
<br>
And Slainthe is around lvl 7-10 last I remember and is also in the Order, which has a juste leader in Voltare and some nice officers ( Grymwyll somehow being one of the officers), but there lacks a unity that was prevalent in the hey-day of the Menage. Rygore and I try to clog the guild chat channel with meaningless roleplaying conversation, but have met limited feedback with the others.<br>
<br>
In otherwords, I can't wait to see you two online!  We can perhaps discuss starting a new guild, try to give a direction for the Old Code (which has a potential for being a decent guild) or just roleplay and have a laugh, which is the most important issue. Regardless of guild, and level differences or similarities!<br>

 Bad news guys... Due to time and financial constraints I have had to cancel my DAoC account at the end of the free month... <br>
<br>
 If any of you still have active EQ accounts, you can drop by and catch me online either as Ashborne (45mage) or my new pet Kitaine (9th Vah Shir Warrior).<br>
<br>
 It was a tough choice... Alas, I have a group of RL friends from my college days that play EQ on a Monday night on the Torvonnilous server... and they bought me Shadows of Luclin as a birthday present to convince me not to leave them (the bastards <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).<br>
<br>
 Please dont think that I value the friendship of Ezmeres, Rygore, Raff and Bristin any the less for this.... that is just not the case. <br>
<br>
 Until I have time/money enough to play 2 online games (which may happen if my agent gets her arse in gear) I will have to bid the realm of Albion farewell for the moment.<br>
<br>
 In the meantime I expect to read tales of high adventure and see screenshots of you lot charging the barbarian hordes (either here or email them to me).<br>

 Heh heh... I guess Slainthe fell by the wayside after sharing a few drinks with Ash one fateful night....<br>
<br>
 Speaking of dreams, Ash just *has* to reach level 52 and scribe this Summon: Booze spell I have sat in the bank. He also has to find some way of getting his sister Mordanna's soul back from the Plaguebringer...<br>
<br>
 After that he will retire...  and fulfil his final dream of opening a Tiki bar on the dock in Oasis.<br>

I was just wondering if you use your e-mails that were given  out for &quot;Menage&quot; use?  I've been trying to get ahold of you two to see when you are actually online.  I'd like to add you to my friends list as I don't know what characters you'll be playing or their names ( I know one is Raffertty).
