If you take Xenadrine RFA-1, remember it has lots of caffeine in it (200mg per 2 capsules---so like a 12oz mt dew is 55mg).  Xenadrine is the newest, popular fat buring product.  &quot;Rapid Fat Loss Catalyst&quot;<br>
Basically, you start off with one capsule 2x a day and work up to 2 at 2x a day.  Wow I r jumpy plopplopplop fizz fizz ayayayayay blip weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!<br>

Dunno if these work or not yet as I started them while finally getting back to doing cardio with my weights and eating less of the junk food fats.

<br>
Eat lots of Brocolli, celery, other good unrefined carbos.<br>
<br>
This means give up refined sugar in any form and you just might have to give up convenience foods. So, start cooking your meals.<br>
<br>
Stick with a diet that has about 30 fat, 30 protein, 40 carbos and you will be fine I bet. <br>
<br>
Hold the potatoes to a minimum even if you work out 2 hours a day, you cannot overcome them if you eat a lot.<br>
<br>
I dont call this dieting, but more a reasonable plan for   workout program. <br>
<br>
I trained for and competed in the sport of Triathlon for 5 years. The first year didnt use the advice above and I stayed around 190 even though I worked out about 2 hours a day, 5 days a week. This included runs of 10 miles which consumed over 1000 calories.<br>
<br>
When I figured out what was going on and changed diet, I dropped to 172, 10 percent body fat and knocked 28 minutes off my best time from the year before and that was on just the first race of the season! <br>
<br>
Main thing is the sugar and refined carbos were just killing the whole metabolism and caused real problems with energy. After changing, I had tons of energy and began to see real improvements in weight lifting, endurance, and most important attitude. <br>
<br>
Nice thing is you can adjust it for the amount of exercise you do. When training I was eating 4000 calories a day, when not training around 2200 a day.<br>
<br>
I mention all of this, because I recently started back on this way of eating and it is hard to adjust! I want my potato chips, candy etc!!! But the results can be seen in as little as 10 days and the cravings go away within 3 weeks.<br>

<br>
For me it was eliminating soda/sugared fruit juice.  Now I drink a lot of tea (no sugar in it).  I think Asudad is right about the refined sugars.  I still eat plenty of carbs, but not sugar as much.  My parents are doing this thing where they eat 20g of carbs per day or less.  I think it's a bit crazy, because they say they can't eat tomato, orange juice, etc.  They even get concerned over carrots and broccoli and stuff.  Apparently they can &quot;subtract&quot; out grams of carbs if they are listed under dietary fiber or something, but I still think it's a bit crazy.   I think there are different types of carbs, and that the carbs in fruits and vegetables as sugar are not the problem.  But apparently even those sugars cause the body to produce insulin which they say (from reading these books) causes fats and so on to be stored in the body instead of ignored, and that it also causes these sugars to be stored as fats.  When I visit them, I eat the way they do (it's easier and they really make a lot of good meat-based meals hehe), and I find myself a bit low on energy... I wonder if it's really good to so totally reduce one's carb intake.  But my mom has lost 20 lbs in like 6 weeks, and my dad something like 25 or 30, so whatever works, I guess.  And she just got a cholesterol/etc test back and went from high cholesterol a few months ago, to right in the middle of the listed &quot;normal&quot; range.  It's working like their book said it would, so I guess my skepticism is somewhat diminished.  But I'm not sure they would be so bad off drinking orange juice, or eating tomatos, and I'm hoping they're getting enough nutrition... beef isn't known for its high vitamin content, hehe.<br>
<br>
I guess what works for me is no soda, no sugared fruit thingees, and beer is a &quot;treat&quot; rather than a nightly thing (/cry).  I miss beer the most.  But it saves money to avoid it, too. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Yes Burdusk the insulin sounds like the problem. In fact my dad got the age related diabetes because of his sugar intake. I dont think I want to have that happen.<br>

I love carrots and carrot juice which you are not suppose to have, but I draw the line there and seem to be doing well. I love V-8 juice also!<br>

Of course should a bunch of us want to get together for Mudslides or a few beers..............well you wont have to ask twice.<br>
<br>
Hehe, didnt want to sound like this is a lecture. The thread just happen to strike a cord in me since I have recently started working out again. <br>
<br>
The only advice I could possibly give is dont pay the god awful prices for the supplements they advertise. Did you know that a $10 can of brewers yeast has 15 times more amino acids and such per serving than a $50 bottle of some mix? You can mix 2 tablespoons in a glass of orange juice and a can lasts about 3 weeks. Sure it doesnt taste good at first but like beer you begin to like it.<br>
<br>
My nephew was spending $200 a month on supplements till I showed him the list of nutrients in brewers yeast btw. He now spends about $15 a month. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/uhoredor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Horedor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Casanova in a Kilt</span><br>  Posts: 144<br> <font color=#330000>(3/20/02 4:18:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/faxiomshift90768frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=308.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> Fanyen, if you want to see a fat japanese woman, or any woman, just marry her.<br>

Nah didnt think you were overweight or anything. I just happen to be thinking how a lot of the Named diets out there really play havoc with a persons body, leaving them no better off. Especially the supplements people are lead to buy because they think they help. Just good eating and working out it the real answer. Hold a sec,,,,pizza delivery at the door.. Ok where was I?<br>
<br>
I am on a mission to get back into good condition so it has been on my mind for a while. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/ugaggrog.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gaggrog</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Disciple of GWAR</span><br>  Posts: 1381<br> <font color=#330000>(3/21/02 2:08:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/faxiomshift90768frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=308.topic&index=14>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> you can start by activating asudad and playing more<br>
it will help exercise your fingers<br>
then when we wipe on some silly Aktar AoE group idea, you'll have time to exercise between cr/med time<br>
<br>
this also allows Aktar to play more too<br>

I was the one who introduced Aktar to the joys of AOE. Hey Aktar, run into that room, cast pillar of frost and see what happens to the mobs! Was fun to watch.<br>

Yeah would love to be playing again, but still have a number of things up in the air. Maybe in April. I dont think my account expires till the first of MAy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/ugaggrog.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gaggrog</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Disciple of GWAR</span><br>  Posts: 1382<br> <font color=#330000>(3/21/02 2:38:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/faxiomshift90768frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=308.topic&index=16>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> well hurry up den<br>
