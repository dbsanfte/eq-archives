This village was not unlike any other, except maybe that this tale originated there. The women worked the fields and tended the children while the men did other, more dangerous work. Most did the hunting and trapping, but this tale is not about them. This tale is about a boy, his Father's legacy and the blade known as “Nai-Toge”. <br>  It was early in the mourning and the boy was still asleep, the sun not yet dawned. His mother lay next to him. She would often join him in his bed because her husband, his Father, Yashoku, was at times away during the chill hours of night. The night before had been one such night. Soon they woke to find Yashoku making ready breakfast. The boy was not aware that his Father had been absent. Though he was aware of the newly wrapped bandage around his Father's waste and the stain of blood that soaked it. <br>  “Papa, what happened?” asked the boy <br>  “A scratch and it hurts, Shin-Kai.” <br>  He replied preventing his son from poking the wound. His Mother held Shin-Kai and took him to his bath while the food was readied. Shin-Kai washed himself as he did countless times before but this time he was interrupted. His Father slid back the paper door and sat next to the bath. His head was bowed and his face was concerned. Shin-Kai said nothing for he thought he was in trouble and wanted to first find what his father knew or did not know. His father sighed and began to speak with a soft caring voice. It was odd to Shin-Kai his Father was usually very stern with him, especially if he was caught for misbehaving.<br> “Shin-Kai today is seven years past your birth. I was that age when my Uncle began my studies. It is time we began yours.” And with that he rose, patted Shin-Kai on the head and left him to bathe. Shin-Kai was confused, very confused. Studies are for children of nobility and money. The Shinogi family had neither. <br>  “Papa?” Shin-Kai said inquiringly. “What…” He stopped there as his Mother gestured with a nod that now was not the time. Things were certainly odd. His Mother, Hitohana, kept watching him and ate very little. She sat quietly as did his Father and she seemed sad and worried. She would smile at Shin-Kai when he would look at her, but would then quickly avert her eyes. He saw that she struggled with tears that swelled in her eyes. His Father, on the other hand, sat proud and ate his fill. After breakfast was finished and the table cleaned Shin-Kai’s Father went outside. He was sitting quietly and Shin-Kai sat next to him. After a long silence his Father spoke. <br>  “There is balance in everything, Shin-Kai, between the Sun and the Moon, the Earth and the Sky, the Mind and the Body, …Life and Death. Keeping the balance of things is a difficult task. And is one I will teach you. A Man in his life must learn many things. To be strong, to love, to make life…”<br>  He said with a slight grin as he nudged Shin-Kai. But then his eyes wondered and the grin left his face as if he thought of something in the past, something dark and forgotten. <br>  “…And to take it.” He rose from the ground and took a deep breath. Shin-Kai stood too and looked at his Father with a strange look.<br>  “First things first.” He laughed “I will teach you, with time, my profession Son. And that of your Grandfather and his Father.”<br>  “You will teach me to Farm?” Shin-Kai said with very little interest. <br>  “No, a Man has many duties. Yes, farming is one of mine and I do it with joy. But, I have other duties as well. Some you will learn of with time. For now you need not cloud your mind with them, I need your concentration. Now let us begin!” <br>  That day was the start of years of training in the martial arts known as Ninjitsu, the art of stealth. Shin-Kai caught on very well and his Father was proud. Shin-Kai learned many forms of martial arts and many more ways than that to wield a weapon. He watched as Shin-Kai progressed much faster then even he as a child did. Soon Shin-Kai grew to be young man all the time training under the watchful eye of his aging Father.  There was little more Yashoku could teach Shin-Kai, but the last lesson was still to come. <br>  One day Shin-Kai came home to find an odd dressed man standing on the porch. He was dressed in bright red and was accompanied by a Samurai. His Father was there and stood waiting for Shin-Kai. The man wanted little more then to meet Shin-Kai. After they stood and talked some the man asked about Shin-Kai’s training and how well it was coming along. <br>  “There is only one lesson he has still to learn.” Yashoku replied. <br>  “Ah, very well. I had not suspected he would be ready at such a young age, Yashoku. There is much of you in him.” The man said. “I hope that only he understands why things are done as they are, Yashoku. You have been our treasured secret and…”<br>  “Let us eat, Hitohana has prepared something special for your visit.” Yashoku interrupted showing them the way in. Shin-Kai was more confused by this event then any other in his life. Why was his Father so important? Who was this man and why was Shin-Kai’s training of any interest to him? <br>After dinner Hitohana made off with the dishes and had Shin-Kai accompany her. All the while Yashoku and the man talked at the table. They made their voices low and Shin-Kai, with his superb hearing, could not pick up the words. At length the man said his thanks, bowed and left with his guard. <br>The sun was setting when Shin-Kai returned he found his father alone at the low table and in front of him was a wood box. Very long was it and very old. It ran the length of a man’s arm and was bound shut with a black wrap. Shin-Kai came and sat beside his father. <br>  “In this box lies my duty, Shin-Kai. And it the duty of my Father and his.” He told him as he slid the wrap off of the box. “There are many decisions a Man makes and many he does not. In this box is a question and to it you must answer.” With that Yashoku lifted the box and handed it to Shin-Kai. As Shin-Kai lifted its lid, his hands trembled. There were so many questions to be answered. In the box was his answer but more so was there the question. In the box was Nai-Toge, the Dead-Thorn. It lay on a bed of black silk, sleathed. Ivory was its handle and stained black as night, on either side was two intertwining flower stems covered in thorns. Its hilt capped with a single rose cut of ebony stone. The setting sun’s light poured in through a window as Shin-Kai took it from the box and slowly withdrew it. Its blade was like ice, cold and reflective. It was silver with a tint of shade and the light danced across it. Shin-Kai looked up to his Father that was bowed before him.<br>“I give you Nai-Toge, the Dead-Thorn. My Father’s Father before him took it from the dead hand of a Shogun after he had taken his own life. The Shogun lost a Great War against his brother and was dishonored. To honor his Shogun Master your Great Grandfather, a Samurai, using this blade, took his life as well. The blade was taken by a mistress from the chambers and given to my Father by his mother. My Father then took Nai-Toge and turned it on the Brother of the Dead Shogun seeking vengeance. Many years did he fight and very talented did he become. Till his match was met by the Samurai warrior Hitogoroshi. They fought in the rain under the moon and many tales of the battle are still told. Some say that my Father had beaten Hitogoroshi and that he begged for his life. But in the shadow there was an assassin with an arrow of poison. They say that my Father took the arrow in his back, dropped his blade and died under the Samurai’s sword. When his body was found so was Nai-Toge. Again it was brought home to honor our family. I have since used its edge to keep the balance of life and death as the Shogun sees fit. It was my tool as I was the Shogun’s. I am the Ninja, Master of the shadows. I ask you now, Shin-Kai. Will you learn what it is to keep the balance?”<br>  Shin-Kai was speechless. He fell to his knees and placing Nai-Toge before Yashoku he bowed to the floor. The room fell into darkness as the sun set beyond the mountains in the west. His mother watched from behind a half-opened door as her tears fell from her face. Yashoku stood proud. He had only one more lesson to teach Shin-Kai and that was of the value of life… and of death.<br><br>End, Part One, Story of Shin-Kai<br><br>Shin-Kai Shinogi<br>ORDER of the BLACK ROSE <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/ushinkaiobr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shin Kai OBR</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10> at: 4/2/01 6:20:38 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#460000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/ushinkaiobr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shin Kai OBR</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#9C0000>(4/2/01 8:18:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fsbobrfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.eqrogue.com/images/shin-kai1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Story of Shin-Kai</span><hr size=1> Story of Shin-Kai <br><br>Part Two:<br>“The Cutting of the Flower”<br><br>Days passed and Shin-Kai thought of many things, but mostly he thought of his Mother. His Father, Yashoku, said little if anything about his dark profession around to Shin-Kai and never around Hitohana. For a while things were back to the way they were before he had known of Nai-Toge and the legacy. It was like waking from a dream, knowing of it but having no real memory of it. Shin-Kai kept up his studies and waited for the last lesson to present itself. Long did Shin-Kai wait and Yashoku showed no intention of teaching it. Shin-Kai grew restless.<br>Winter came and the ground became cold and hard. The nights were terribly long and Shin-Kai often watched his father leave during the night. Yashoku was not aware Shin-Kai knew of his absence and left more often then he had ever. One night when Yashoku was making his way down the beaten path that lead away to the forest he heard something behind towards the house. He stopped, though he did not turn, and then went on his way with great speed. He was deep with in the forest in the foothills of the mountains when again he heard sounds behind him. This time he was sure someone was hunting him. He traveled on as if he knew nothing of his pursuer and then with lightning quick speed he disappeared into the night. He climbed a tree and hid, motionless. Soon a dark figured leapt out of the darkness and into the moonlight that came down upon the path. It crouched and inspected the track that Yashoku had made in his haste. Then it stopped rose to its feet. The Hunter had lost the track and Yashoku waited. Soon the Hunter moved ahead very cautiously for he knew now that he was no longer the only one hunting. <br>As he wondered beneath the tree that hid Yashoku he stopped, crouched very low. His hands were upon the ground and his knees bent high. He made no move. Yashoku reached to his side for Nai-Toge, but it was not there. Remembering that Nai-Toge now belong to Shin-Kai, he took hold the handle of his long blade that was bound to his back. He did not dare withdraw its blade. Instead he leapt into the cold air and fell towards his pursuer, the flapping of his loose fitting tunic sounded like an Owl in the night. The figure beneath him reached under his cloak. Shhhk! Yashoku let loose his blade and held it high above his head as speed through the air. Just as he struck his target rolled to one side and jumped to his feet. Yashoku, in one continuous move, rolled towards his enemy and kicked him square in the chest knocking him several feet into the air and then to the ground again. Yashoku stood, paused for a moment as his target stumbled to his knees, and then charged with his blade at his side. The target stood and reached to the darkness of his cloak. Just as Yashoku swung his blade up to strike the neck it was countered and held with the blade of his enemy. Seeing the other blade shine darkened silver, he jumped back and let down his guard. For the blade were Nai-Toge and its wielder Shin-Kai. <br>“Foolish Child!” Yashoku hissed with rage. “I could have killed you!”<br>“Father…” Shin-Kai uttered in fear.<br>“You know not what you do! Why do you follow me?!” Yashoku demanded!<br>“I…I was only curious. I was going to turn back at the river ford, but…” Shin-Kai exclaimed<br>“But, what?!” Yashoku interrupted.<br>“There were three others in the wood to the south where you left your track. Headed back to the west to the fields.” Shin-Kai replied with haste. “I thought you should know. They did not spy me and so I kept on your path to tell you.” <br>His Father looked at him with confusion, but then his eyes narrowed. Then a sudden wash of panic came over his face. He looked deep into Shin-Kai’s eyes.<br>“Hitohana!” He shouted and leaving Shin-Kai standing there, he fled back the way he had come with tremendous urgency.<br>“Mother?” Shin-Kai questioned himself. “Mother…” He whispered to himself, realizing what his Father meant and quickly he followed behind him.<br>When Shin-Kai neared his home he saw his Father hunched near a tree that lay at the perimeter of the yard. As he approached he saw that his Father was weeping. <br>“Father…” Shin-Kai said<br>“Shhh” Yashoku replied sniffling away his tears.<br>Shin-Kai could not understand why he was crying the house was dark and quiet the way he had left it. No one had been there since he left that was clear. But before he could say anything Yashoku stood and threw down his cloak. He no longer was worried about his cover. Shin-Kai was relieved. Finally his Father saw that no one had been there as Shin-Kai could clearly see. He followed his Father to the path that led to the entry. As they walked Yashoku took in each hand his daggers. Shin-Kai stopped and raising his eyes from his Fathers daggers to the front door he stood speechless. As he stood under the moon his Father entered the dark house. Moments passed, though it felt like eternity. Shin-Kai knew the question but did not yet have the answer. It came too soon and sudden and startled him. It pierced the air as Yashoku cried into the night “HITOHANA!!!!!!”<br>His mother, Hitohana, was dead and he rushed to the side of his Father. Yashoku was knelt down beside Hitohana’s lifeless body. Her throat had been cut and her eyes were open looking into the darkness. He was whispering in her ear, as he held her. He said everything that he would have said had she still been alive. He loved her a great deal and wept uncontrollably. Shin-Kai could not move. His heart was pounding his breath was heavy. He stood there some time before his Father looked upon him in the darkness.<br>“Shin-Kai…” Yashoku sniffled. <br>And like a switch his Fathers voice sent him to the floor crying. His Father came to him and said words to comfort him. When Shin-Kai had regained his composure his Father asked for Nai-Toge. Shin-Kai looked up to him with surprise, confusion and grief.<br>“Someone came looking for me, Shin-Kai. Not…your Moth…Not Hitohana” He began to weep. “They did not find me and so they must look. I need you now, Son, to be strong. I need you to look outside and tell me what you see.” With that Yashoku took from his son Nai-Toge and sent him outside. <br>Shin-Kai could barely walk his knees were weak and his breath short. He made his way to the porch and stood in the moonlight. It was like a dream. Nothing moved and the sounds were gone. He looked across the shadows of the yard and nearby forest but saw nothing. <br>“Father…Father, I see nothing.” Shin-Kai said at last. “Father?”<br>He made his way back into the darkness. Again the air was pierced. Shin-Kai screamed as he found his Father upon the floor. In Shin-Kai’s absence, Yashoku took Nai-Toge and slid it deep into his gut, opening his liver. He was still breathing and Shin-Kai held him. <br>“I am dead without Hitohana.” He uttered. “She is gone now because of me, because I am…was the ninja known as Shadetree. You, Shin-Kai, are my Son and Shadeseed you are known to be, though you know it not.” Gasping as he began to choke on the blood that was bubbling in his throat. “Go now, Shadeseed. Leave your home for the lands to the west of the mountains…you are marked.” He cried and buckled under the pain.<br>“Father!” Shin-Kai gasped. “I have yet one more lesson to learn, remember?!”<br>“Heh, you thought the lesson was how to take life. It was not. The lesson, Shin-Kai, was to learn to watch life leave. With my passing I will have taught you all I can… Forget us not Shin-Kai and forget not Nai-Toge. It was all I had of my Father and all you will take of me…” Yashoku coughed.<br>Nai-Toge lay on the floor in the pooled blood of Shin-Kai’s parents. So sharp was its blade that no blood clung to. Shin-Kai held his Father that held his Mother and waited. His Father said no more and only looked into the distant eyes of Hitohana. A peaceful smile crossed Yashoku's lips as his last breath danced away into the cold air of the winter night and Shin-Kai wept.<br><br>End, Story of Shin-Kai <br><br>Shin-Kai Shinogi<br>ORDER of the BLACK ROSE<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub36.ezboard.com/fsbobrfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=58.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub36.ezboard.com/fsbobrfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=58.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fsbobrfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.eqrogue.com/Icons/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fsbobrfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=58.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fsbobrfrm1.threadControl?topicID=58.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fsbobrfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=58.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fsbobrfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=58.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub36.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="sbobrfrm1">Visitors<option value="sbobrfrm2">Rogues Den<option value="sbobrfrm3">The Tavern<option value="sbobrfrm4">The Alley<option value="sbobrfrm5">The City Gate<option value="sbobrfrm6">The Back Room</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#9C0000>- </font><a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bsbobr>SBOBR</a><font color=#9C0000> - </font><a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fsbobrfrm1>Visitors</a> <font color=#9C0000> - </font><a href="http://orderoftheblackrose.net">Order of the Black Rose</a><font color=#9C0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM SOCIETY AD SCRIPT --><SCRIPT LANGUAGE="javascript" TYPE="text/javascript" src="http://www.ezboard.com/bravenet/ads08/ads.txt"></script><noscript><div align="center"><iframe src="http://www.ezboard.com/bravenet/ads/eznoscript1.htm" frameborder="0" scrolling="No" width="756" height="117" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" style="border-width:1px; border-color:000000; border-style:solid;"></iframe></div></noscript><!-- END BOTTOM SOCIETY AD SCRIPT --></CENTER><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
