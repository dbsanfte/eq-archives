The guy spent 5 minutes to actually answer to the skald report. He did more communication about skald issues than the entire team in the past 2 years.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
Given the changes to DAOC over time, I don't think it's unreasonable to ask that we look at increasing the range, lowering the time, or adding a higher level shout to this line. We'll look into what makes the most sense here. <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Good thing. Having played quite a bit with the champion class, shorter recasts and higher ranges will help a lot. A lot. This would be good and welcomed changes.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
The range on the DA seems very low and really limits the utility of this chant. We are looking into changing this (and other song/chant ranges) to make them more viable in RvR. <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
Good, but it has always, for me, been a given. It will fix a glaring imbalance.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
We're not planning on adding anything specific to this line at this time, with the exception of the above mentioned changes. <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
Fair enough. We don't want to boost defense, we don't want to boost BS. Okay.<br>
<br>
But answering to demands out of context is not adressing the skald report. The report boils down to one question. It could be summed up in one sentence. this sentence is &quot;Why do skalds have inadequate melee and substandard support ?&quot;. If he isn't answering this question, stating they don't want to add new songs or boost skald survivability is useless. He is perfectly in his rights to say it will be a bad idea to help skald by increasing defense or by adding a new song. Fine. But the general issue should be adressed, and if he is going to rebutt our propositions, might as well make propositions about ways to put back skalds into balance.<br>
<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
This is common for many classes and not specific to the skald. With the recent block/parry changes, players should explore the options of making trade offs to raise parry if they want more in the area of melee defense. <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
Shrug. I hope he doesn't mean for us to &quot;explore&quot; the enemy frontier alone and groupless because we didn't spec 43 in BS, right <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Seriously, how many logs will be enough to point out there is a problem with skald damage output (compared to their defense and support) with the current specs (high BS and/or high weapons). ? Do we need to decrease our damage still more ?<br>
<br>
And he is just missing the point. This is not &quot;common to many classes&quot;, not to this extent. Only skalds and wardens can spec defensively and only have 1.5x to do this.<br>
Every single melee or hybrid class put the leftover points in parry. Every one. The issue is that there just is more leftovers with 2.0 than 1.5. AND those classes can spec shields. The return on investment for points spent in shield is MUCH better than the points spent in parry.<br>
Having to choose between 50 weapon spec and the best songs are already a choice that skalds are forced to do with their meager skill points allotement, unlike all other melee hybrids. Now are we supposed to spare points who don't have to fix our defensive issues ?<br>
<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
Alternate templates are a good thing. We don't want there to be one single &quot;best&quot; template, so we'd look at this as a positive. <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
Fair enough, but he is missing the point. The point is that this template has been essentially a reaction of skald players caused by 1) The poor scalability and return of investment of the BS spec at the higher (43+) levels (relying on a level 35 and low 40ies spells aven when 50 BS specced ?!?!?) and 2) The poor melee performances of the skald, which triggered the need to spec 50 in weapon to close part of the gap with other melee classes, throwing part of our group supporting, class defining abilities down the drain in the process.<br>
This spec is a testament to the skald imbalances at higher levels, and the general weakness of our BS line, once you have gotten the last taxi spell in the line.<br>
This is what the guy should adress - not congratulating himself about the variety of different and colorfull specs.<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
This is a change that affected all DAs. <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
Sure, but which other class has no other song or ability to fall back to when playing DA's become inadequate ? Which other class has, by default, the damage add as a class defining ability ?<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
As far as the realm abilities, we'll be reviewing all the underperformers at some point in time, but have no plans to adjust the skald's specifically. <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
There is one point I do agree with him : RA's are a general balance issue, not a skald specific issue. I am perfectly comfortable with the idea of not giving FoG priority over the other numerous underpowered RA's.<br>
<br>
However, what frightens me to no ends is that he is wording the whole thing in a way that tends to show the whole thing is not a priority, nor really acknowledged as a big problem by Mythic, and frankly I am appalled. So, there was a desesperate need to destroy the three-realm war because shaman end spell was SO overpowered, yet, they tell us that nothing will be done in the near future to some crap like BoF+faith healing in the realm where overcap AF and ablative songs are available ?<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
This helps skald defense as well. While it makes it more difficult for everyone to attack targets with such defenses, it has no affect regarding skalds and &quot;softer&quot; targets. <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
Nonsense. This is missing the point.<br>
First, everyone knows and is aware of the fact that one point spent in shield spec give you more than one point spent in parry, and among the defensive triad, parry is the redheaded stepchild. This fix helped shield users first, then heavy parry users (light tanks especially, or some hybrids like LW champs), then, at the very bottom, the low parry hybrids (skalds, wardens ...).<br>
Secondly, like always, skalds don't exist in a vacuum. General, game wide boosts have large scale effects. Throwing a small bone at skalds doesn't cut in when most other classes that go toe to toe with them got much more !<br>
<br>
And what exactly does that comment about soft target means ? Mages are not going to hit back skalds with their staff so that the skald will have an opportunity to parry them ? Are we suddenly able to deflect fireballs with our 2 haders ?<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
We are reworking the resist system and are paying special attention to the effect of the block/parry fix on CC resist rates. <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
Good.<br>
However, skald resist issues predate the last patch ... If the parry/block rework is fixed relative to CC spells, we are just been set back to the exact same status quo as before ...<br>
Other Issues <br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
Nice report. Feel free to keep pushing the defensive issue. But right now, we really want to proceed with caution when evaluating any changes to the classes defense. <br>
----------------------------------------------------------- <br>
<br>
That's just it. This kind of comment mirrors exactly skald's number one concern.<br>
What does he say here ? He says &quot;We have worked hard to rework the game systems, and we are now very happy with the balance we achieved, between attack and defense, and about the duration of battles. We have reached a satisfying state, so we are not going to toy much with individual defenses now&quot;.<br>
The most important part of the TL report - which is not adressed at all in this rebuttal - is that we feel that we were left out, forgotten in a long and thorough balancing process, and now that the balancing is essentially done ... it's more like &quot;though luck guys, we are over and it is too late now, but we'll make sure we won't forget you in future changes&quot;.<br>
This is why the last comment is the most disappointing of them all.<br>
<br>
To sum up, he just dodges the main issues :<br>
- Both melee and support are not up to par. An answer is needed about the definition/role of out class<br>
- Class left out of all of the game and balance changes since day 1<br>

<br>
'A good offense is the best defense'<br>
<br>
They'll improve the Battlesongs, wich are our classdefining abilities. They'll agreed to give us 1500 raidus + 'something else' (reduced timers?<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). This is fine by me and MUCH better then being given Shield-Spec which would turn us into singing Thanes. <br>
<br>
2 Songs at a time is never going to happen! How are you supposed to sing two songs at a time?<br>
<br>
Dmg-Song is so much underrated! If you hit for 200 dmg and 40 are added by our song - that's 20% more dmg! People are spending tons of platinum for MP weapons which will give them much less bang for the bucks. 3 melee fighter in your group-&gt;120 dmg per hit, which means roughly a fourth 1 hand melee.<br>
<br>
I would like to see one of the following:<br>
<br>
Skald changes 1:<br>
Shout reuse timer 15 sec.<br>
Stun Shout<br>
Mezz/Stun on a different res than the healer mezz <br>
Dmg Add SLIGHTLY increased<br>
Dmg Add radius increased<br>
<br>
Skald changes 2:<br>
Shout reuse timer 15 sec.<br>
Self Haste Buff<br>
Mezz/Stun on a different res than the healer mezz<br>
Dmg Add SLIGHTLY increased<br>
Dmg Add radius increased<br>
Evade 2<br>
<br>
<br>
Of course, the RAs need a complete overhaul and I think they know this, but they won't do it in the next few weeks. Imho BoF and BAoD ruined much fun in RvR so they should change those fast.<br>

This spec line basically throws away most of the benefits of the Battlesong line, with the exception of speed 5 (notably : the &quot;strong&quot; battleshout is effectively destroyed, and the damage add song is a substandard one). However, the fact that some Skalds still decide to go this route to scrape a few more points of weapon damage is a testament to both Skald woes in melee combat and to the poor state of the battlesong line. <br>

<br>
******* HE TOTALLY CONTRADICTS HIMSELF HERE *******  What i see roseanne saying is that theres only one decent spec and the alternate spec really isnt viable and we might as well roll a thane!

<br>
Yes this is a good point.  A Skalds defense is balanced against its parrying ability but cant be speced high while the other classes included in this list have other factors contributing to their defensive abilitys.<br>
<br>
The only other classes that fall into this category are :<br>
<br>
Friar - Leather + Evade 5 + high AF buff + parry<br>
Valewalker -  Evade 4 + AF buff + absorb buff (basicly plate -2% abs thats neutral to everything) + parry<br>
Warden - Scale + 6 sec pulseing bladeturn (read 100% melee absorb every 6 seconds) + parry<br>
Savage - Studded + Evade 4 + advanced evade + self shout buffs + parry<br>
Minstrel (although not a parry class) - Chain armour + evade 2 + high dex/qui + absorb chant<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We should clearly have either higher evade or some type of self buff or a group effect defensive chant.  Some of these classes even have the option not to a melee and just fill a support role while a Skald must always melee.<br>
<br>

In your communication with TL person why don't you ask them to run a query to see what the percentage of Skalds over RR 2 or 3 (across all servers) that have the Skald class specific RA. <br>
<br>
In fact they should do that with all Class specific RA's just to get an idea of what is useful and what isn't.<br>

Basically make songs a &quot;toggle switch&quot;.  Click once to turn them on, click again to turn them off (like today), but allow you to have any two &quot;on&quot; at the same time.  Have them go in FIFO order.<br>
<br>
Lets say you click on damage add, and run speed in that order, and keep those going.  Then you run into some nuker group, and you click on a resist chant.  This would turn &quot;off&quot; the &quot;first&quot; song you turned on - in this case the damage add, and turn &quot;on&quot; the resist song - leaving the run song and the resist song on.<br>
<br>
I don't think it would be impossible to do, but I acknowledge that given my perception of Mythic's opinion of skalds (which seems to not at all be consistent with most of the people actually playing skalds) that they're unlikely to do any major change.<br>
<br>
If the question was related to the role-playing aspects of singing 2 songs at the same time I'm not really sure how to respond since so many other classes have so many abilities that can be done at the same time - including skalds. (ie we can sing a song, and do all sorts of shouts while we're singing)<br>
<br>
Personally - I'd like to see them implement something along these lines at the very least:<br>
<br>
reduce timer on shouts to 15 sec<br>
stun shout (as minstrel)<br>
group song radius increased<br>

<br>
the issue or concern is that style lines are horrible for the skald.  stun is the only thing in this game which matters.  we have no castable stun.  we cannot get slam as we cannot spec shield.  we cannot use the weapon styles to stun as they are based off block (which you can only do with shield spec, brilliant choice there) and we cannot spec shield.<br>
<br>
i have made the attempt to draw up an entire new weapon line for skalds, it is on the front page of our forum.  please forward it to mythic.<br>
<br>
what i find most offensive is that beserkers were nerfed because they had an overpowering anytime style they could spam.  skalds on the other hand are not buffed despite the fact that 90% of the time skalds spam an underpowered anytime style. <br>

whoever wrote that reply does not understand game mechanics, please quote me on that.  parry is based on dexterity, which skalds dont have.  specing in parry is based on having 2.0 spec points, which skalds dont have.  parry reactionary styles cause bleed, which makes it so a skald then cannot mez his target even if the low spec mez DOES stick.  what is the point of skalds even having parry again?  i seem to have missed it.<br>
<br>
the recent changes to block/parry were an incredible nerf to skalds.  we cannot compete any longer on ANY level with an enemy melee.  they ALL have the points to spec defense, be it shield or parry.  we cannot without making our already weak class completely useless, and of course we cannot spec shield AT ALL.<br>

again, whoever wrote the response simply doesn't get it.  skalds have a unique line.  it's called battlesongs.  IT IS A PROBLEM IF PEOPLE ARE NOT SPECING IN IT FOR ANY REASON OTHER THAN 1 CHANT THAT BEING RUN SPEED.<br>
<br>
a class with a unique ability line should WANT to spec in it.  if people are specing out of their unique ability line that is BAD.<br>
<br>
i guess i'm not sure why i even care.  i shelved my shaman 15 months ago to wait for it to stop sucking.  it is still shelved.  i read the descriptions when i made my first character, shaman was described as the magical version of what friars are today.  instead, i got a buffbot.  well, after 15 months of playing my skald and watching him get nerfed worse and worse every patch, i finally gave up and cancelled all my accounts.  with a week left on my last account before the cancel goes through, i would really like mythic to do something to convince me i should re-activate.  but i dont see that happening.<br>

<br>
My feedback to their feedback.  <br>
<br>
Yes low parry is common to many classes in the game who have OTHER valid means of defense such as shield.  How many other classes that don't get shield spec get parry spec and just how many spec points do they get?<br>
<br>
Skalds have to have BS lev 43  for speed as it stands now or we lose our main purpose in RVR.  If we spec high parry and low weapon we are pretty much useless once combat begins.  Maybe throw a single target mez (likely resisted) and timered as to be ludicrously far apart for a single target that is as weak as it is.   If we spec high weapon and low parry we can at least harass some casters/support if we can get to them. <br>
<br>
Fact is our defensive potential &lt; minstrel, friar, warden, and possibly even bard now since the bard changes (not sure as I've seen no testing)  And our offensive output is not sufficiently high to compensate nor do we bring anything unique except 200% + movement speed to our groups. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aurensirramalot>AurenSirRamAlot</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/Auren/fullsize/shield.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Fervent</span><br>  Posts: 120<br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/9/03 2:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=655.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One person's opinion for fixing skalds</span><hr size=1> 2 Songs at a time is never going to happen!

I find it encouraging that Mythic is at least talking about throwing us a bone instead of ignoring us all together.  Also they didn't completly close the door on the defense issue. <br>
<br>
Revamping the DD and DA is not a hudge deal, but anything helps.  I think from an RvR group support point of view the possibility of getting the resist chants beefed up could be a great thing.  With the lack of Healers spec'd high in AUG Mid. is hurting for resists.  If we could get this boiled down to 2 sets of 3 resists RvR groups everywhere would rejoyce. <p>Blackmouth, <br>

So basically it comes down to they aren't going to change our defensive capabilities, Battlesongs line (address the lack of effectiveness of two skalds in a rvr group) or our RVR survivability.  Basically he could have just answered the whole report with the following:<br>

<br>
I agree with Phleet that they need to define the role of the skald and then implement changes to reflect that role.  Also on the second thing Phleet commented on there is something interesting from the hero feedback (also mention of this in the scout report feedback as well).<br>
<br>
- Mythic is in the process of a &quot;comprehensive&quot; style line review which will hopefully eliminate glaring weaknesses or problems with specific weapon lines or styles.<br>
<br>
Maybe .. just maybe will will finally look into Mid weapon styles and make some changes for the better.  Don't hold your breath though all <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Basically if no change to defense/survivability is coming then make us 100% offensive:<br>
<br>
-Self haste buff exactly like Wardens with a 38% topping around 47 BS<br>
-Endurance reduction buff like wardens/frairs<br>
-Mezz changed to 11 second Stun<br>
-DA increased and range increased<br>
-Shout timers reduced to 15 sec<br>
-Shout spell levels increased as well as damage<br>
<br>
Then we will be almost right back where we were as far as frontloading damage with shouts, haste/end reduction DA improvement.  Our defense would still suck but at least we would be able to do some damage before getting blasted/slam/CC'd to death. <p>Panth</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sojourntreslok>Sojourn Treslok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Participant</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/9/03 3:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=655.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One person's opinion for fixing skalds</span><hr size=1> Well where to begin, first Rosey, nice report btw, and on to the nitty gritty.How about a focus here.<br>

<br>
Almost a good point, however, the &quot;if they want more in the area of melee defense&quot;. Not sure we are talking &quot;more&quot; we are talking any. We have been relegated to the primary issue of speed only. He/she sort of missed the point here. We get 1.5 spec. There aren't many &quot;trade-offs&quot; in fact exceedingly limited trade off that a skald can do and still be anything viable. The majority of those &quot;other&quot; classes have a higher 2.X spec line. We're addressing apples and Troll Skalds *edited just for Phleet /giggling* (not oranges since at least they are still FRUIT) here. <br>

Alternate templates are a good thing. We don't want there to be one single &quot;best&quot; template, so we'd look at this as a positive. <br>
<br>
And this comment really wins my icing on the cake award. Again we fall back to the same issues, it's the spec points. How are we to alternate and explore those alternate &quot;templates&quot; when 1. what we have to work with is much lower then even similiar classes. 2. we don't have the aforementioned increase in spec and have the ability to utilize a shield.<br>
<br>
Provide us what is needed to explore alternate templates then. At this point we don't have that option for goodness sake.<br>
<br>
Essentially I'm now extremely curious as to what other template options are allegedly viable? Define a skald. What are we? We aren't light tanks we've heard that...we are a &quot;hybrid&quot;...well there are anomalies among hybrids, and even genetic mutants. The skald community is not requesting to be the UBER char of the game, we humbly request that there are a few alterations done to make us once again a viable class to compete with.<br>

Most sales organizations will tell you is that a customer would rather hear bad news than no news.  I hope Mythic keeps up with doing this.<br>

As for the report, as has already been said, disappointing.<br>
<br>
I think it's great they may consider a change to our DA and our DDs.  They are the battle tools of our unique spec line, so of course we would like them to br useful.<br>
<br>
But as for defence, it's unfortunate that the replier both understood the problems with class changes, but doesn't get the specifics of a skald.<br>
<br>
He or she states that making changes to the defence of our class is a 'slippery slope'.  S/he is quite right.  If you increase the defence of one or several classes, one begins to slide down a long hill of having to change defence or offence for every other class.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately what s/he fails to see is that this has already happened, and that we are one of the &quot;other classes&quot; needing to be brought in line...not a new unique change that requires altering other classes.  The large increases to the defensive abilites of other classes have already taken place over the last year, and our point is not to start a new trend of this, but to be one of those classes brought into line to MEET those changes.<br>

We're at the bottom of the slippery slope, not the top. <p>Clapperoth Liefarg<br>

You guys might wanna keep an eye on the Shaman report.   The devs mentioned in their that they would most likely be increasing the Shaman DA.   Between the Runie and any Shaman increases, the skald DA just got that much less unique.<br>

I was hoping to read this report and find a reason to re-activate my accounts....but none so far. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=berdoon>Berdoon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Participant</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/10/03 7:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=655.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Feedback from our 1.62 Skald Report</span><hr size=1> I keep searching for words to communicate my extreme disappointment in Mythic's attitude towards Skalds and keep coming up short.  To continually ignore a classes shortcomings then dangle a small carrot ( increased range on chants/dd's ) is what I would term as &quot;Used Car Salesmanship&quot;.  Tell them the bare minimum it will take to get them to by off on another subscription term.  I am leveling a <br>
Spiritmaster, Warrior and Savage(in grave danger of the nerf bat, they are way too much fun) that I totally enjoy playing.<br>
<br>
Each and every time I take my Skald out to rvr, I grow less content.  Each and every time I pve with him his defense to  offense ratio is a more glaring downside to playing him.  Mostly I use him to pl my buffbot that I use to pl my other toons that I am enjoying so much more.<br>
<br>
Mythic's lackadaisical attitude towards this class, and so many other Midgard classes, is appalling.  It seems that they want a two realm war and are slowly phasing out Midgard as it is has the least aesthetic appeal and will require the most work to actually fix.  How many people know a Midgard class that actually buys it's class specific RA other than Shamans with Ichor ( which I see less and less of played Shaman's in the frontier ).<br>
<br>
They &quot;balanced&quot; Hibernia and Albion and nerf Midgard's definitive damage dealer that is based upon the realms mythos.  From the feed back that I see the only &quot;balancing&quot; Midgard will see is fluff, nothing to give us a competitive edge like the class specific RA's you see in Albion and Hibernia nor the class defining upward tweaks that Albion and Hibernia have seen in the recent past.<br>
<br>
Bottom line, Housing is way more important than Midgard.<br>
<br>
Once I have another level 50 toon my Skald will be a forge monkey and a door repair bot.<br>
