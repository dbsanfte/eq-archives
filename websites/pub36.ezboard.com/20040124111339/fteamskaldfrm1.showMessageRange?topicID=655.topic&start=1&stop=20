Skald Report - Post 1.62 <br>
<br>
Overview <br>
<br>
Skalds suffer from the lack of definition. The result of this is that the Skald has watched their damage output scale downward as changes in the game are implemented, and their group support abilities overshadowed by other classes within the realm. Currently the perception is that we have become little more than a speed dealer for RvR. This is a far cry from the original Skald which was able to front-load damage to make a difference in battles. All damage dealing/group abilities have remained unchanged since the game was released while the game itself has changed drastically. <br>
<br>
Concerns <br>
<br>
Damage Adder range and DPS <br>
Given that the Damage Adder was considered the primary in-battle group ability of the Skald, it would stand to reason that it would be a worthy chant. With it's 700 range and the pulse dropping bug, it has become less valuable. The Skald DA, at the very least, needs to have the bugs fixed and the range increased to 1500. Increasing the DPS would be well received too. Please note that this chant is also available to Wardens and Paladins, and in both cases, this song is not their "first choice" in battle (in fact, they are rarely used in RvR groups with only one Warden/Paladin), which is a good indicator by itself of the perceived valuability of this song, yet it is our top combat support song ... a bit weak if we were to be categorized as a "support" class, thus explaining our lower melee performances. <br>
<br>
Direct Damage Shouts <br>
Both the War<xxx> and the Battle <xxx> DD shouts are on seperate 20 second timers, are body resist, and have 700 range. Since spell success/resists are based on the Spell level vs Target as opposed to Spec level vs Target, and the War<xxx> line of DD shouts caps out at level 34, the chance of landing the spell successfully is rather low. These shouts are duplicates of the Minstrel's shouts (which are on 15 second timers) and the Bard's single shout (Same as our lines, except combined into a single shout, 10 second timer). Also note that Skalds who wish to follow the "offensive" Skald route (50 weapon) will have to rely on a level 26 Battle <xxx> shout, which, with the lower level damage add, considerably weaken the "battlesong" source of damage for that kind of spec. But even for a 46/44/17 Skald (or a 50 BS Skald), the low level on the second shout is a hindrance. <br>
<br>
Feedback<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
Given the changes to DAOC over time, I don't think it's unreasonable to ask that we look at increasing the range, lowering the time, or adding a higher level shout to this line. We'll look into what makes the most sense here. <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Skald Defense <br>
Chain, evade I, 1.5 spec points, parry, unspeccable small shield, low Dex and Qui which don't raise with level, and no spell or innate ability that directly add to our defense or hits. This is the worst defensive skill set among the classes that are required to go to melee to be effective. Most melee hybrids, among other magical abilities (Paladin AF buff and chant, Thane/Champion's Str/Con buffs), can benefit from 2.0 spec and speccable shield; Minstrels have better evade with same armor type and an ablative song; Wardens have scale, parry, and has the advantage of the PBT; Friars, light tanks and assassin classes have, among other things, high to very high evades scores to more than make up for lighter armor types. On paper, Skalds have a bit better direct melee defense than Bards and healing classes ... but those classes are effective and useful at range, and not required to melee to fulfill their roles. <br>
<br>
Feedback<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
This is a very slippery slope. At this time, we're not planning on adding any more defense to skalds, although we do want to keep a close eye on this aspect and understand the concerns. <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Group offerings <br>
The other support/melee classes among the realms offer a lot more to the group than the Skald, either within or outside of battle. A single Skald within an RvR group can supply the means to transport the group to battle, which is truly the only thing we excel at. During the battle the Skald can provide their DA chant if the members of the group stay close together (allowing them to be AoE suceptable). If you have a second Skald in the group you can add one of the single resist chants. We can use our Mez ability on a single target in close range(700) and we can use our DDs to interrupt, although at 700, melee is just as useful and has less downsides. The Skald is only considered needed in RvR for their speed. <br>
<br>
Feedback<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
The range on the DA seems very low and really limits the utility of this chant. We are looking into changing this (and other song/chant ranges) to make them more viable in RvR. <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Specline Issues <br>
<br>
Battlesongs- This specline is required for the Skald to do their damage and bring what group ability they have to a group. It is the primary Spec line to spend points on. It does need to be looked at as the return on investment on the defacto Spec line is not up to snuff. Typical Skald Spec is 46 so that the Skald may receive the final Damage Adder Chant. <br>
<br>
Feedback<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
We're not planning on adding anything specific to this line at this time, with the exception of the above mentioned changes. <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Weapon - Like all Midgardians, we have 3 weapon Specs to choose from. This is usually the second thing for a Skald to raise since they have to raise Battlesongs to be effective. Typical Skald Spec is 44 so that the Skald may receive the level 44 weapon style. <br>
<br>
Feedback<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
What is the issue or concern here? <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Parry - The only Speccable means of defense for the Skald is relegated to getting the leftover Spec points. A typical Skald will end up with a Parry of 17. <br>
<br>
Feedback<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
This is common for many classes and not specific to the skald. With the recent block/parry changes, players should explore the options of making trade offs to raise parry if they want more in the area of melee defense. <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
We would like to also note that an alternative specialization template is gaining popularity : 50 weapon (almost always axe for the 50 style), 43 BS, leftover in parry. This spec line basically throws away most of the benefits of the Battlesong line, with the exception of speed 5 (notably : the "strong" battleshout is effectively destroyed, and the damage add song is a substandard one). However, the fact that some Skalds still decide to go this route to scrape a few more points of weapon damage is a testament to both Skald woes in melee combat and to the poor state of the battlesong line. <br>
<br>
Feedback<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
Alternate templates are a good thing. We don't want there to be one single "best" template, so we'd look at this as a positive. <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
New Issues <br>
<br>
Damage Adder changes - With Patch 1.58, Damage Adders were changed to prevent the usage of the spell for power-levelling. This effected a Skald's DA spell in a negative manner, although the Skalds DA could not be used outside of a group, and therefore not as a levelling tool. This change also effect our unique realm ability, Fury of the Gods. <br>
<br>
Feedback<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
This is a change that affected all DAs. As far as the realm abilities, we'll be reviewing all the underperformers at some point in time, but have no plans to adjust the skald's specifically. <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Melee defense fixes - While the fix is a nice one for the general health of the game, like many changes that were done in the past year, it just scales down even more the Skald compared to most melee classes. <br>
<br>
Feedback<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
This helps skald defense as well. While it makes it more difficult for everyone to attack targets with such defenses, it has no affect regarding skalds and "softer" targets. <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Resist rates - A current problem expressed by most casters, it both affects Skald damage output (shouts) and CC. <br>
<br>
Feedback<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
We are reworking the resist system and are paying special attention to the effect of the block/parry fix on CC resist rates. <br>

<br>
Item Problems <br>
<br>
Skalds can not spec in shields but have access to 2 handed weapons. The offensive bonus granted by a two handed weapon is much more significant than the chances to defend with an unspecced small shield. So skalds use two handed weapons 99% of the time, keeping a fast one hander for specific situations only (essentially, dealing with PBT). <br>
Yet, a significant number of "Skald" weapons (weapons with Charisma and/or Battlesongs) are one handed, and there are also Charisma/Battlesongs small shields. <br>
It is nice that a few of those situationals items exists ... But 3 known one handers and one small shield in the epic dungeon vs 2 two handers that I can think of ... it is not appropriate with the real use of those weapons. <br>
<br>

<br>
+ Battlesongs bonus. <br>
This issue is just an eternal source of misunderstanding, which sometimes just breeds ill feelings. To sum the issue up : yes, it works, but no, it isn't worth it. <br>
We know that it does something (has a small impact on shout damage), and as such, we understand that it should be put on some RNG and hand made items. However, understand that, with the limited total number of imbue points all over a Skald body, +battlesong bonus is so low a priority that it is not commonly found on any template. As an exemple, maxing out charisma adds a lot more damage to shouts than maxing battlesongs. As such, we kindly request you to keep +battlesong bonus out of "epic" loot, high-level/high-end loot, and quest rewards. <br>

<br>
He completely missed the point you were trying to make...while many classes have some problems, only the skald has all of them in terms of melee/hybrid. Saying the parry fix is good for skalds makes me want to remind him that the other parry-only 1.5 classes have some advanced form of defense.

Chain, evade I, 1.5 spec points, parry, unspeccable small shield, low Dex and Qui which don't raise with level, and no spell or innate ability that directly add to our defense or hits. This is the worst defensive skill set among the classes that are required to go to melee to be effective. Most melee hybrids, among other magical abilities (Paladin AF buff and chant, Thane/Champion's Str/Con buffs), can benefit from 2.0 spec and speccable shield; Minstrels have better evade with same armor type and an ablative song; Wardens have scale, parry, and has the advantage of the PBT; Friars, light tanks and assassin classes have, among other things, high to very high evades scores to more than make up for lighter armor types. On paper, Skalds have a bit better direct melee defense than Bards and healing classes ... but those classes are effective and useful at range, and not required to melee to fulfill their roles. <br>

This helps skald defense as well. While it makes it more difficult for everyone to attack targets with such defenses, it has no affect regarding skalds and &quot;softer&quot; targets. <br>

Obviously they do not understand that its not casters hitting me with their staves that I'm worried about.  Any class that is hitting me with a weapon, save a rogue, has access to parry and/or, and in 99% of cases, has the ability to afford more in this ability. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=etherag>Etherag</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Participant</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/8/03 5:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=655.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: oh man..</span><hr size=1> Rosey,<br>

As always you report was very nice but this feedback…..Well it’s “disappointing” to put it politely.  The ONE area that I think the whole DAOC community can agree on is that skald defense is just bad and yet this feedback seems to miss that point completely.  <br>

This looks to me like someone who is not familiar with melee RvR and how skalds compare to other classes.  I could almost translate this to say “but you have speed and stun and mez to get out of a fight.  Nothing is wrong with you defense.”  If minstrel defense was considering lacking to the point they needed the ablative chant, how in the world could skalds (with the same base armor, less evade and lower dex) be considered a “slippery slope”?  Heck all I wanted was the dodger RA and evade 2.  Lines like<br>

This is common for many classes and not specific to the skald. With the recent block/parry changes, players should explore the options of making trade offs to raise parry if they want more in the area of melee defense. <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
just shows a lack of understanding about our spec options.  If you did “explore the options of making trade offs to raise parry” you would have such a gimp class that every one in DAOC would just pity you.<br>
<br>
As I read this the person responding will 1) raise or DA range, but will do it for wardens and paladins too (nice but does little to help our core issues) 2) look at shouts, this is the only positive thing I see in this message 3) Leave resists alone as he/she does not have the mandate to work on it (being handled by another group) 4) Leave the RA alone because he/she does not have the mandate to work on it.<br>
<br>
Last they STILL have not made a definitive statement on what/who skalds are expected to be.  Are we a support class?  Are we a hybrid?  Why do we have the worse support skill set in the game at the same time we have almost the weakest melee (Damage AND defense) and poor (700) range.<br>
<br>
Not sure who the feedback came from but to be honest it looks like they spent 15 min evaluating your report and 2600 entries in the official thread.  All I can say is that I am glad I am going to be gone most of the summer on work trips and vacation.  Maybe in September things will be better but I need the break with this kind of response.<br>
<br>
Keep up the good work and don’t let this be the final word.  Go over this person/teams head if you have to.  You have more patience than most saints as I think I would have given up months ago.<br>

What concerns me most is our value to a group once the battle has begun.  A DA fix could work in this area, if it did increase in range, did not skip pulses, and INCREASED its DPS for RvR battles.  But I would rather see a different chant given to skalds that would let them become more desireable in RvR groups.  Melee haste / end regen / Power regen could provide more value to having skalds in a group, and would not disturb other classes within the realm. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=t0a5t>t0a5t</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Participant</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/8/03 5:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=655.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> hmm</span><hr size=1> After reading the comments for the Skald and Thane reports, I'm glad patch 1.10 for Diablo 2: Lord of Destruction is out.

<br>
There is absolutely nothing overpowered about a skald with 2.0x and shield spec.  Nothing.  46 song, 44 weapon, 42 shield would be a standard spec and would fix the main problem with skalds, which is defense.<br>
<br>
There is a very limited bonus attached to 2h weapons.  The damage output is nice, sure, but the fact that we cant hit anything with such a low weaponskill versus typical shield or evade defenses really hurts us.  Furthermore, without determination on our realm ability list, even casters can mez/root us and then forget about us while they destroy our realmmates.  What targets are we to choose, and why should that class be unfortunate enough to be our only option?<br>
<br>
We -Need- something else to benefit our defense.  We have to have it.  Otherwise, we're just an idiot running around singing and reducing enemy shield conditions.<br>
<br>
Honestly, nobody plays a skald to deal damage or stay alive anymore.  Groups need speed from a skald, and little more.  I think that if skalds didnt have speed, they would have just as hard of a time finding an RvR group as an assassin would having a PvE group.  Why?  There is simply no reason to take bad melee and bad support over good melee.<br>
<br>
I see two routes to improve our defense:<br>
<br>
One - Add shield spec, and give us 2.0x spec.  This will give skalds the option to pick up a shield and make use of the multiple 1h skald weapons available, or two further boost their 2h abilities by beefing up parry.  This option gives the skald appropriate skills for the 'path' they have chosen, which is viking.<br>
<br>
Two - Add evade 2 or 3 to our ability list, and add dodger to our realm ability list.  Also suggest an increase to 1.75x for increased parry.  This option gives the skald a 'light tank' appearence, but fits a singing class nonetheless.<br>
<br>
If i dont see any changes coming for my skald, then what's the point of playing it?  I hate being a taxi.

Sadly they did not address the true problems of the skald. There is no versatility in our abilities or our spec, and our defense is truly sub par. The comments of possible change they did make are  obvious fixes and should be made along with addressing our true problems.<br>
<br>
The slippery slope they mention when addressing our defense concerns is most likely our brother class, the thane. Mythic is probably concerned about an outcry from thanes if they gave us 2.0 and shield spec. Unfortunately they are probably right about thanes being upset. It's too bad we can't be brought up to par simply because another class may complain about it on the vn boards. I don't think you should determine whether or not you fix a class based on what another class may whine about. If there is a problem fix it.  Don't use thanes as an excuse not to help skalds.<br>
<br>
Shield spec and 2.0 skill points would help skalds by giving them versatility in the way they can spec and it would give us needed utility in the form of guard and shield styles.  It would give skalds added defense that is speccable, gains from items and realm rank  and not <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">solely</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> reliable upon  stats  that never increases as we level(higher evade.)<br>

This is common for many classes and not specific to the skald. With the recent block/parry changes, players should explore the options of making trade offs to raise parry if they want more in the area of melee defense. <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The problem here is that there is no viable Skald spec with Parry over 25. With only 1.5 points and a spell line that simply can not be specced below 43, there isn't enough points left to get a meaningful defense *and* offense. And a high Parry rating serves no purpose on someone with a low weapon spec, as there simply is no point for said someone to go into melee range any more.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
Alternate templates are a good thing. We don't want there to be one single &quot;best&quot; template, so we'd look at this as a positive. <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Except this isn't an alternate template. ALL Skald templates are based on the &quot;Minimum 43 BS for the last speed, weapon spec as high as possible, leftover into parry&quot; paradigm. This is just the most extreme variant of it. It, however, shows that more and more skalds consider the BS line to be of limited value except for the speed song, and Parry to be useless ( as it doesn't bring any tangible benefit unless specced higher than most Skalds can afford to).<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
This is a change that affected all DAs. As far as the realm abilities, we'll be reviewing all the underperformers at some point in time, but have no plans to adjust the skald's specifically. <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Disappointing. Very disappointing. And not only from a Skald's point of view. There are some very ugly imbalances in the whole Class RAs system.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
This helps skald defense as well. While it makes it more difficult for everyone to attack targets with such defenses, it has no affect regarding skalds and &quot;softer&quot; targets. <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Except, again, Skalds do not have any significant way to spec defensively. So the change widened the gulf between us and &quot;real&quot; melee classes, and nothing more.<br>
<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
Nice report. Feel free to keep pushing the defensive issue. But right now, we really want to proceed with caution when evaluating any changes to the classes defense. <br>
----------------------------------------------------------- <br>
<br>
By this, I understand that you feel that you have boosted (game wide) defense enough in relation to offense for now. However, the defense concerns of the Skald class predate the general changes made to the game to lengthen combat. And they haven't really been solved, we still have a short life span compared to similar classes. This would be acceptable if our offense still worked as it used to, but this is no longer the case. So the concerns remain.<br>

Skalds have also suffered from little to no adjustments over the course of the last year or so and feel like an aged class.<br>
<br>
First of all, my Skald is incredibly 1 dimensional.  Why am I needed in any group??? Simple.. speed.  That is it, we are a one trick pony and once you get used to speed it is not fun and requires no skill to use.  Here is a summary of my experiences in PvE, RvR, and Duels with a Skald.<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
You are basically there only to help the group arrive at their destination quickly and then run battle chant.  We can kind of pull aggro from healers by saving our shouts, but that is a bit of a lost art now that we are resisted so much.  Pulling is not a great option as our snare slow the enemy rediculously when it sticks, and we can normally not survive extended time with aggro.  Battle chant is still flawed, suffers from bugs, and helps only marginally.  You really can't tank, you can't control aggro, and most do not good damage.  Having aggro is normally a mana drain to the healers due to our lack of defense and hp.<br>
<br>
RvR<br>
You are there for one reason... speed.  Multiple Skald groups used to do good front loaded damage by /assisting and opening up with shouts, but they are resisted and do such little damage in RvR they are no where near impactful anymore.  Once in battle if you remember you can switch to battle chant, which helps the group if they are not out of the short range or they do not get any of the missing pulses bug.  This requires both end and pow btw.  Melee is mildly effective, I normally use 1 hander and shield since Hib PBT is so prevalant and the ONLY chance we have to stun (sword spec) is off the block style Frost cut chain.  Due to our low defense, low hp, and high profile normal driver role (most af the Skald) we are often first to die.  Our main effectiveness is to hang back, find a caster and try to run in/flank and take them down.  We can not guard or protect healers as with our lack of defense and low hp we are mearly a speed bump on the road to the healer.  Our mez is also incredibly short duration, on a long timer, a major mana (some end drain), and barely noticeable to party members.  Snare and mez are often resisted and even with these cc methods Skalds have little to no chance at escape due to the length of reactivating Run Song.<br>
<br>
Duels/1on1<br>
I often open with 2 quick dds and a snare.  I then try to stay out of melee range as long as possible trying to regain DD timer.  Once in combat we are normally at a major defensive disadvantage.  2 hander is blocked/misses very often and/or nulified by PBT and 1 hander lacks the 110% damage of 2 hander.  Damage output is decent when combined with damage add but due to fairly low (40-44) weapon specs, style choices are fairly limited and often result in polar rift or main anytime style spammage.  As you begin to lose the fight, Skalds will often try to mez and then run or heal up with FA.  Then reopen with DDs and return to melee.<br>
<br>
Overall, I think Skalds are semi-effective but a very limited a dated class that I have absolutely no fun playing.  Here are some suggestions.<br>
<br>
Defense:<br>
Since the defense was uped, Skalds have suffer immensely.  Now Mythic rebutts that Skalds were also helped.. however that actually is incorrect.  The defense issue was compounded and more negative to Skalds because they A: Have limited spec points to invest in parry.  B: Can only use small shield which does not block multiple targets.  C: Do not have shield spec.  D: Have limited evade skills.  Skalds parry benefited slightly yes (this may even be debatable), while enemy's Parry, Shield, Evade, Advanced Evade, Guard, Intercept, and Large Shield blocking were all improved.  Skalds need shield spec and medium shield.  When this is coupled with the low hp of the Skald and the high cost of IP, their lifespan is very short.<br>
<br>
Beneficial Song Besides Run:<br>
Lets face it, Skald damage add is dated, boring, bugged, and was left behind in the times patches ago.  Skalds need some other group support to help in both RvR and PvE.  Personally I think a celerity song would be ideal as one option.  I also feel Skald's should have been the class to receive end regen.<br>
<br>
Review of Battle Song Line<br>
Not only has there never been a reason to take BS to 50, but most are even going lower than the final shouts which used to be our bread and butter.  We need higher damage, shorter timer, and high level (Less resisted) shouts.<br>
<br>
RA<br>
Fury of the Gods is a joke.  This RA needs a complete revamp.  <br>
<br>
This is one person's experience, not just as a Skald but from a multiple class point of view.  I'm not crying that Skald's suck, because they don't.  However, I am saying they are very little fun to play, offer very little in support, and feel like an outdated class.  I would like to see my Skald be fun or interesting to play again, but I don't see that happening anytime soon.  Best of luck with all your efforts Roseanne.<br>

<br>
Minstrel<br>
Can spec stealth<br>
Evade II<br>
9-sec instant stun @ lvl 40 songs<br>
AE Mezz<br>
70pt AA chant<br>
Can get dodger RA<br>
<br>
Paladin<br>
2.0x skill<br>
Plate armor<br>
Spec shield<br>
Combo resist chants<br>
AF resist chant<br>
Self AF buff<br>
<br>
Now lets consider that 100% of all other realms melee classes get 2x spec:<br>
<br>
Melee classes<br>
Blademaster - 2x<br>
Champion - 2x<br>
Hero - 2x<br>
Armsman - 2x<br>
Merc - 2x<br>
Paladin - 2x<br>
Reaver - 2x<br>
<br>
Only Midgard gets melee classes with 1.5x spec.  Savages, who get dual-wield for free with HtH, and Skalds that get, umm???<br>
<br>
Ok - now with that baseline, here's a few groups of suggestions on how to fix skalds:<br>
<br>
Plan A<br>
* 2x spec<br>
* Shield spec<br>
* Increase range on all group chants to 1500 or 2000<br>
<br>
This simultaneously improves skald offense and defense, as well as group support with access to shield slam.  I expect this would be the most controversial change - so I suspect the least likely to happen.<br>
<br>
Plan B<br>
* Combination resist chants - 3 resist types per chant, and add a melee resist chant (still not as good as AA aura or pbt - but better than nothing)  Combination resist chants at least on par with Paladin's. (paladin 3-resist chants add 10)<br>
* Add stun shout - as per minstrel<br>
* Improve damage on dd shouts or reduce reuse timer to 15 seconds (improving damage increases frontloading, reducing reuse timer helps damage output over time, so I suspect a more palatable change would be reducing the reuse timer)<br>
* give skalds evade 2<br>
* give skalds access to dodger RA<br>
* Increase range on all group chants to 1500 or 2000<br>
<br>
This would provide better class support, better damage output, and better survivability.  Paladins get combo resist chants so that seems reasonable.  A chant that added +10 or +15 to 3 resists might even be worth singing.  Reducing the reuse timer on shouts from 20 to 15 seconds would offer a small increase in total damage output.  Evade 2 and access to dodger might actually let skalds survive and have defenses on par with the Rogue-based Minstrel.  Adding a stun shout as per minstrel would help to improve the usefulness of the skalds battlesong line, and help skalds do one of their primary jobs - peeling melee's off of their casters.<br>
<br>
Plan C<br>
* Allow skalds to run 2 chants at the same time. <br>
* Combination resist chants - 3 resist types per chant, and add a melee resist chant (still not as good as AA aura or pbt - but better than nothing)  Combination resist chants at least on par with Paladin's. (paladin 3-resist chants add 10)<br>
* Add stun shout - as per minstrel<br>
* Increase range on all group chants to 1500 or 2000<br>
<br>
<br>
This would make the skald a much better support class, but wouldn't dramatically change skald survivability. (other than what resist chants would grant since having the ability to have 2 chants going would make it more likely that one of them could be resist)  This might make the skald approach the group supporting usefulness of minstrels or paladins. (although minstrel still far better due to SoS)<br>
<br>
And in general:<br>
FIX THE SKAL RA - its such a travesty it isn't even funny.  It costs more than BoF or SoS to buy and is so much less valuable its not even funny.  How about something like letting all a skalds chants go active for 30 seconds?  If they're too lazy to fix the skald RA, reduce its cost to something trivial like 3 points, or if that's even too much, put it on an incredibly short reuse timer.<br>
<br>
Just a few late night thoughts...<br>
