Bronus' Amulet Quest<br>
-------------------------<br>
<br>
You say, &quot;Hail, Nilibik Driogo&quot; <br>
<br>
Nilibik Driogo says &quot;Hello, you look like a battleworn traveler. Have you heard of the place where [grieg] resides? <br>
<br>
You say, &quot;grieg&quot; <br>
<br>
Nilibik Driogo says &quot;Aye, Grieg Veneficus. We do not know much about this madman, only where his [stronghold] is. One of my friends from the Eye was sent there to investigate it, but he has not returned. It has been quite some time and I am ver worried about him.&quot; <br>
<br>
You say, &quot;stronghold&quot; <br>
<br>
Nilibik Driogo says &quot;Grieg's End is what it has become to be known as. Some reports have come back that this place is cursed with foul visages. Any entering will surely loose their minds. I.. I would go but you see I am desperately busy here in the city doing..uh..many important things! You <br>
look like you could help, [will you travel] to Grieg's End and look for my friend? <br>
<br>
You say, &quot;will you travel&quot; <br>
<br>
Nilibik Driogo says 'Good, I am glad you would prove yourself useful to Seru. Look for Bronus, you should beware if he has lost his sanity for he is almost as powerful as myself.' <br>
<br>
Look for a naked gnome named Bronus in Greig's End. He drops a cracked amulet. <br>
<br>
Give Nilibik Driogo the &quot;cracked amulet&quot; and his response is: <br>
<br>
Nilibik Driogo speaks a small incantation as he pulls a branch from a nearby tree and ties it around the amulet 'I shall mourn him dearly, he was a good friend. This was the amulet that I had given him before he left to explore Grieg's End. I want you to have this for helping to find his lost soul. Go <br>
in peace my friend. <br>
<br>
You get the Nilibik's Yew Affixed Amulet<br>

Eye of Trust Quest<br>
---------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Examiner Malikin' <br>
<br>
Examiner Malikin says 'Good day to you. I hope that you are enjoying the sanctuary that this beautiful city of ours provides. We go through great efforts to keep this city not only clean, but extremely safe as well. Have you ever wondered about the lengths to which we have to work to maintain the safety of a city as fine as this? <br>
<br>
You say, 'to what lengths' <br>
<br>
Examiner Malikin says 'We have to work with great diligence and determination to maintain the security of this sanctum. There are elements that are set on defiling our work here. These antagonists seem to prefer attempts at corrupting people from within our ranks. Weak minds are inevitable, so corruption is unavoidable. That is why the Eye is necessary. We are not here to pry or spy on anyone. We simply maintain the security of our sanctum and weed out any unsavory elements. If you're interested in learning more about the Eye, I can assign you a simple task or two. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what is the eye' <br>
<br>
Examiner Malikin says 'The Eye keeps us informed of all that goes on beyond the walls. They are responsible for security and purity inside the walls as well. They also monitor the other three Praesertum. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what simple task' <br>
<br>
Examiner Malikin says 'Simple tasks go a great distance to establish trust. I may know of someone who can help you to establish yourself within the ranks of the Eye. If you are interested in performing a task of that nature I can get you started at this time. Would you like to begin? <br>
<br>
You say, 'I would like to begin' <br>
<br>
Examiner Malikin says 'Very well. Please, take this coin to Questioner Ontu. She will advise you on your next course of action. There is a decided lack of direction in this matter, for a member of the Eye should always be able to find people. This will be good practice for you. Take care. I hope to speak to you again soon. <br>
<br>
Questioner Ontu doesn't exist. The name is Percontorius Ontu and is 63+ Location is -132.31, -693.12, 87.13 notice the Z axis <br>
<br>
Hand the heavy coin to Percontorius Ontu. <br>
<br>
Percontorius Ontu touches the coin to the back of her hand and then looks up with a smile. 'Please take this back to it's source,' she says and nods. You feel the coin return to your hand. Your palm tingles slightly and then the sensation fades.<br>
<br>

You gain experience!! <br>
<br>
Hand the heavy coin back to Examiner Malikin <br>
<br>
Examiner Malikin says 'Good job! I'm glad that you have returned. I'm also very glad that you were able to see this task as what it was, a purpose to be fulfilled. I'm not sure that you understand, so please allow me to elaborate. The coin that I handed you has great value. That value is obvious in the fact that the coin is made of a precious metal and carries with it more weight than a standard coin. That said, you did not take the coin for your personal gain. You simply carried out your purpose. The fact that you can be trusted has earned you that coin. Do you understand the meaning of the task now? <br>
<br>
You say, 'I understand the meaning of the task' <br>
<br>
Examiner Malikin says 'Very good, for I have another task to offer you if you would like to continue. This one is a bit more complicated. I'm sure that you can handle it, but I need you to be sure as well. I need this to be a surprise. Do you think that you are prepared to handle an issue that will require both stealth and secrecy? <br>
<br>
You say, 'I am prepared' <br>
<br>
Examiner Malikin says 'Please take the coin that I have just given you and find my friend, Consis Sinsolus. He can often be found walking in one of the park areas. I'm beginning to believe that he has a mild infatuation with trees. Please take the coin that I have given you and slip it into my friend's left coat pocket. When you do so, please remove the coin that you will find in his pocket and bring it to me. Accomplish this task without error and I may have a special task for you. Take care not to get caught. I would prefer that the swap remain a surprise for him to discover on his own. <br>
<br>
Hand the heavy coin to Consis Sinsolus and get back Mark of the Hand I think. I used sneak for this part but not sure it's necessary.<br>
<br>
Your Location is 673.96, 774.32, 59.13 <br>
<br>
Hand the heavy coin to Consis and receive a Mark of the Hand. <br>
<br>
Consis Sinsolus turns to look at you for a moment, but does not appear to notice that you made the swap. <br>
<br>

You gain experience!! <br>
<br>
Hand the mark/coin of the hand to Examiner malikin. <br>
<br>
Examiner Malikin says 'Splendid job! You managed that task quite nicely. Please, keep the coin. The most important part of that task was the fact that you did not stop to question what was being asked of you. That sort of trust is commendable. The Eye is looking for people like you. We need people who display not only integrity, but trust. Trust in our purpose here and you will do well. Our means may seem a bit harsh at times, but we are here to protect our people from an enemy whose methods are without honor. It is one of those very attacks on our people that I will need your help with at this time. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what can I do to help with the attacks' <br>
<br>
Examiner Malikin says 'We have found evidence that there is a traitor within the ranks of one of the other Praesertum. We need you to help us remove this traitor and his contact in Katta Castellum. You will need to take this poison and pour it into our target's ear while he sleeps. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what is the name of the target' <br>
<br>
Examiner Malikin says 'The traitor's name is Ornis Tranum. You should be able to get into his house with little to no resistance. Just be sure to take care when entering and leaving the building. We do not need to bring attention to the Eye in this matter. Once you have poured the poison into Ornis' ear, he will be unable to move. Just place the coin that you took from Consis on Ornis' body and leave. Bring me the empty poison vial, so that I can be sure that no evidence was left behind. Once that is done, we can deal with his contact. <br>
<br>
I went invis and entered his house. then handed both the coin and poison to Ornis Tranum, but you can hand them in seperately and it still works. so this can get off if someone does part out of order.<br>
<br>
Ornis Tranum gasps suddenly and then falls still. <br>

Your faction standing with Nathyn Illuminious got worse <br>
<br>
I didn't get this loc sorry... after you kill him and go back and give the empty vial to Examiner Malikin. <br>
<br>
Examiner Malikin says 'Your worth to us is not going unnoticed. There are many people within the Eye that are very pleased with your progress. Finish this next task and we will have something for you. Your willingness to assist us with this most unpleasant task is a great display of allegiance. We are very excited about your future with us, but let's finish with this before we talk further. Take this poison and do with it as you did with Ornis. This time the target is a guard within Katta Castellum. His name is Erallic. Find him when he is asleep after a guard shift and kill him. Be sure to bring me the empty vial and be careful. They will have guards posted. Stealth is key in this matter. Take care. <br>
<br>
Sit at location 178.00, -1944.00, 31.13, that's where he will suddenly POP to. I was at his post and he suddenly POPPED to his bed. Hand him the poison.<br>
<br>
Legionnaire Erallic gasps silently for air and then falls completely still! No one seems to have heard you. <br>

We are extremely thankful for your dedication and efforts. Please Take this gift and watch for us to call upon your again in the near future.<br>
