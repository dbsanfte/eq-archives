As you can see, block and evade rates remained basically the same but the enemy simply hit more often when I used Sting. This led me to the conclusion that a defensive penalty only affected the enemy's to-hit chance, not your parry/evade/block chances or the damage/hit that the enemy does.<br>

<br>
Parry also has the side effect of disrupting any chain styles and burns your opponents endurance.<br>
<br>
That's just my take, it's all up to your personal play style and preferences.<br>

It's like saying you'd rather use a lower quality weapon with a proc even though your overall expected damage is lower, simply because if you get lucky and it procs a lot it has a big impact.<br>
<br>
Sure, that parry may save your life. But think of those fights where your opponent's health bar was almost empty as you died. Those are the ones you would have won with higher weapon spec. Also, keep in mind that just a parry saved your life it doesn't mean it was because you specced it higher. You might have parried anyway.<br>
<br>
If is recall correctly, I didn't say parry was a total waste. Just that parry above 17 was. Above 17, you are only getting 2 pts of parry for each point of weapon spec. Actually, I might even consider parry above 14 a waste since you get only 3 pts parry for a point of weapon spec. <br>
<br>

<br>
It's most certainly not flawed thinking, it can't be.  We're all making claims that can't currently be substantiated...but I'll put some more meat on that statement for you.<br>
<br>
Your analogy to crafted vs proc is incorrect and does nothing to show &quot;flawed thinking&quot; regardless of the fact that it was used as an analogy (!= identical).  The % chance to proc on a weapon doesn't increase, whereas parry does with spec.  The damage you parry is the same (based on opponent), but the parry rate increases with spec points, so no, your analogy between parry spec increase vs crafted/proc weapons is apples and oranges.  If you were to find a weapon that procs more often due to spec...maybe they'd track better as a comparison, but for now, they don't.  But it's not just that my bardish neighbor, it's even worse:<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
VS a caster that goes down in 3 hits = you won't use parry, you will benefit from higher weapon spec obviously.<br>
chances to role parry = 0<br>
3 hits of 3% more damage.<br>
<br>
VS an Assassin = with a 2H you might get 3 hits in, however, they attack around 2S delay WITH a duel wield attack thrown in much of the time (DW/CD can be parried), so you are getting a much greater # of parry chances vs swings to get that extra % on based on spec. He evades once.<br>
15 seconds/2 = 7+5 dual wield hits = 12 chances to parry (based on spec)<br>
2 hits you get +3% damage on.<br>
<br>
See how it depends on your opponent and their delay?  It also depend on how quick the fight is over, if they have bubble chant, their defensive skills and on and on.  If they block/parry 1/2 your attacks, your + weapon skill overall contribution can go down faster than parry contribution.  If you add in chains off parry, your dmg increase due to style bonuses also increases per spec in parry.  See where this is going?  That's right, it's just too complex to throw around statements like &quot;flawed&quot; when there is no basis for comparison.<br>
<br>
Why drag us through this?  Fact is, parry helps, some feel more than weapon spec up to X levels, some don't......so let folks post their opinions based on their experience.  I have seen no definitive proof from you to the contrary, and I expect, given the complexities and variables, that I won't....from you or anyone else (me too).  Sure, we can prove vs opponent A that one is better than the other on average, but I don't think either of us want to go through and plot out each class/race/spec/attribute/buff etc., etc. scenario.<br>

<br>
But here is a rough estimate of the numbers i had crunched before i erased the wrong disk to send skippy screenshots heh<br>
Lvl 45 at this point.  92 dex, 35 quick (heh) using Black Ice hammer.  Have a 7+5 parry spec<br>
<br>
Lvl 50 armsmen-epic armor.  Hammer and shield vs my 2h hammer.<br>
<br>
battle lasts for 3 minutes, duel setting.<br>
I evade 4 times<br>
I block 0 times (2h weapon out)<br>
I parry twice.<br>
I get jumped by stupid guard patrol at this point and die. ( i had him to 45% at this point and still had my First aid and MCL insta and mezz)<br>
<br>
Lvl 44 pali 2h hand sword- 2h hammer<br>
I parry 3 times, i evade once.<br>
my major DD hits for 224 (-27) on the first hit.<br>
<br>
lvl 43 merc Dual weild merc- 2h hammer<br>
I evade once, parry 1 time.  Killed him eventually he almost nickle and dimed me to death<br>
<br>
lvl 44 champ he had a sword i had 2h. <br>
he debuffed me. don't know if that hits dex or not, never looked. I parry 0, block 0, evade 0. beat him down with 60% health..almost all of it because of his debuffs.<br>
<br>
lvl 40 friar 2h staff thingy- my 2h hammer <br>
Parry 0 times<br>
evade 0 times<br>
Opponet died too fast, wasn't a duel. I killed him with 2 Hammer, 2DD.  He hit me once.<br>
<br>
lvl 47 bard banjo+weak ass weapon vs 2h ( he had a druid bot also at time, who healed him)<br>
I parry 9 times<br>
i evade 6 times<br>
i block 0 times. I eventually get mad and ask for help and buddy of mine PAs the stupid druid.<br>
<br>
lvl 49 hero<br>
I block 0 times<br>
evade once<br>
parry 0 times<br>
he hits me twice...he kills me with a shield charged weapon and a lifebane necklace proc...which apparently you can use while mezzed.<br>
<br>
lvl 41 armsmen- polearm<br>
No defensive moves done.  He lasted two DD cycles, only got two shots in at me.<br>
<br>
<br>
What do we learn from this?  Hmm i think a lot of the parry has to do with your ENEMY'S weapon spec. in the case of the bard, i know he gimped his weapon damage and therefore i think that aided me in parry him.  <br>
<br>
So i don't think parry is broken so much in RvR as  i think a lot of people just have high weapon spec vs your parry spec (heh bard had less weapon spec then my parry i think).<br>
<br>
compare it to mobs that parry a lot.  the insolationist camps in pennine for instance. Take on a merc or a pally there.  Its insane how much they parry you.  then take on a wizard....they don't parry at all.<br>
<br>
I think people comparing parry vs diff. mobs is fine and all, but we have to realize that some of these mobs may be inherantly weaker then others.<br>
<br>
Take the WW caves for instance.  the prags have virtually No defense.  then you fight the lunas...and they seem to have better defense.  But neither of them has defense compared to the grims.  <br>
<br>
caster mobs have different defense types then melee mobs. trows are caster mobs (or hybrids more accurately), Wyvrens are also hybrids.  but Undead Trolls warriors are NOT, they are melee mobs. compare your parry rate against them..i think you will see it fall through the floor.<br>
<br>
typically when i solo exp i try to find camps of mobs that are caster mobs, if you can single pull and interrupt them they never parry or block at bad times.  <br>
<br>
I think parry needs to be tested in a more applicable way.  Not to nitpick, but everyone i have seen do it so far hasn't hit all the variables i think are affecting the issue at once<br>
<br>

Parry 11, dex ~100. <br>

Enemy misses: 91 (12.9%)<br>
Player parries: 81 (11.5%)<br>
Player evades: 28 (4.0%)<br>
<br>
Doesn't look like there is a difference in parry rate between casting and normal mobs.<br>
<br>
<br>
In all seriousness, why am I the only one doing any testing in this discussion? All it is is people coming on making claims based on a couple fights and leaving me to test and disprove them. Therefore, I claim the following and will no longer run tests unless someone shows some real evidence to the contrary:<br>
<br>
1. Base parry rate increases 0.5% per point.<br>
2. Parry rate is 1/2 if opponent is using 2-handed weapon.<br>
3. Other than #2 an opponent only affects parry rate by their level.  Not by their weapon spec, not the quality of their weapon, not the speed of their weapon, or numerous other things one could come up with.<br>
4. Parry rate is affected by dex.<br>
5. Defensive penalties or bonuses on styles do not affect parry rate.<br>
<br>
By testing, I mean at a bare minimum 100 swings. Actually, if the result is controversial I would say 500 swings+.<br>
<br>

I was in Varu the other day at the same time your GM Drakonus was in Spin. He is spec'ed in hammer and I am spec'ed in sword. We were both at level 41.5 at the time and were both killing yellow cons. I was killing the WW Lords and he was working the crabs. The WW's are susceptible to my slask damage and the crabs are susceptible to his crush damage. He was doing damage in the neighborhood of 200+ with crits hitting at or over 300 while I was enjoying my 80-160 damage range. Other than the differences between our weapons, and the fact that he plays a troll skald vs. my human skald, I had spec'ed Battlesongs higher than my weapon, and he had Spec'ed his weapon higher than his Battlesongs. I have asked for his logs so that I can post the comparisons here.  <p><b>__________________________________________<br>

I apologize for the tardiness of them, but I am in the process of moving and launching a new project at work.  So, here it is…<br>
<br>
Well, I have to admit, it is time to eat some crow… But, half my logs for spind got turned off while I was taking them.  Something about jokes in guild chat…  These I will have to repeat since they were where I parried or blocked a large percentage of the blows.  There were witnesses, but I will not drag them in to this.  However, here are the numbers as I have them<br>
<br>
<br>
Spind (versus crabs and stingers)<br>
<br>
Attacks: 45<br>
Parries: 3    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (6.7%)<br>
Blocks: 4&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (8.9%)<br>
Evades: 2&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (4.4%)<br>
Misses: 2&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (4.4%)<br>
<br>
WW Dungeon and Skona guards<br>
<br>
Attacks: 38 (11 from guards)<br>
Parries: 5 (4 from guards)    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (13.2%)<br>
Blocks: 1 (0 from guards)    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (2.6%)<br>
Evades: 1 (0 from guards)    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (2.6%)<br>
Misses: 6  (3 from guards)    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (15.8%)<br>
<br>
DF (versus deamhaness and lillispawns)<br>
<br>
Lillispawns<br>
Attacks: 59<br>
Parries: 3    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (5.1%)<br>
Blocks: 5&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (8.5%)<br>
Evades: 1&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (1.7%)<br>
Misses: 26&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (44.1%)<br>
<br>
Deamhaness<br>
Attacks: 72<br>
Parries: 2    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (2.8%)<br>
Blocks: 8&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (11.1%)<br>
Evades: 4&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (5.4%)<br>
Misses: 15&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (20.8%)<br>
<br>
The interesting thing is to point out the relative differences in mobs to different defenses (parry/block).  This should be looked into to see if one could have preferential leveling areas based on active defense as opposed to just the passive armor and weapon.  WW guards parry a lot.  Deamhaness block a lot.  So one could decide to use S/S on deamhaness and 2H sword on just werewolves.<br>
