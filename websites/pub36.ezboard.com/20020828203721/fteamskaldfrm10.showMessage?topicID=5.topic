Here we go  <br><br>Ignore Pain - get it asap. 23 points after you put in the pre-req of first aid. This effectively doubles your hit points for most major encounters. The 30 minute timer is high, yes, but you don't always need it, and when you DO need it, there's nothing that can even compare. Those 250 point bounty point heals that you need to be out of combat for 3 seconds to use can't complete w/ a 1k insta heal.  <br><br>First aid - get it to level 2 as a pre-req for ignore pain. If they fix this so it becomes a 90% heal like it SAYS they will (right now it is still the 'old' version, and heals about 250 hps or so at lvl 2), then it might be worth getting lvl 3 on, as FA is on a 15 min timer, and you only need to turn off auto attack for about 4 seconds to use it, you do NOT need to be out of combat for 10 seconds like with a speed song kicking in. <br><br>Augmented Acuity - This is the best way to increase your damage output. Mastery of Pain DOES give you more crits, but crits are quite erratic and can be 7 extra damage or 100 extra damage. Higher charisma will give you consistently higher damage. Also, lvl 1 of this is the pre-req for mystic crystal lore, another great ability. <br><br>Purge - 10 points and worth getting. I would get this after ignore pain..... If you wait too long to purchase purge, you will never be able to save up 10 points before you get bored and spend them on cheaper things  Purge is truly invaluable when a sorc quickcast mezzes you for over 1 minute, or a solo smite cleric stuns you in preperation for the SMITE SMITE SMITE of doom.  <br><br>Mystic Crystal Lore - Only 3 points, I picked this up and really love it. Its on a 5 minute timer, and level 1 gives you about 25-30% of your power back. YUM. If there's a really long fight with lots of mezzing and healing, you can even use it more than once. The little power boost is great when you need those DDs shouts to finish someone off, or juts enough juice to mez/snare 1 more person. Pick this up after purge. <br><br>Long Wind - Probably worth getting the first level. Superior sprinting is a handy thing to have, specially with all those damn minstrels and their speed of sound BS realm ability.... gotta be able to run em down so you can kill them when SoS wears off  <br><br>Tireless - Level 1 worth getting just so you can regen endurance on the run. This means you no longer need to sit down after every fight, you can just move with your group and not have to sit down to get the ole green bar to fill up. Again, not a high priority, just falls under the 'nice to have' section. <br><br>These are the main realm abilities I have experience with, I really believe saving your first points for Ignore Pain / First aid 2 then purge will increase your survival rate in rvr a lot, both in small group conflicts and in 1 on 1 situations. Its importnat to get the spendy items first, as it takes FOREVER just to get 1 realm skill point at higher realm skill levels. <br><br>edit: <br>realm abilities really give you the option for flexability (purge/IP/MCL/most active timer based abiltiies) and for a more passive focus (extra str, extra chr, etc). With 100 realm skill points you can have it all, and the pasive abilities are very good to have, no doubt about that, but I really believe it is important to get the flexibility first, before focusing on pure damage output, because usually if you win a fight, well, you probably would have won doing a little less damage too..... but when you think back to those fights where a timer based ability totally changed the whole direciton of the fight.... like a full hp recharge, or just enough power to mez another add.... You really want to get that flexibility first, because you all NEED that stuff in situations where the battle is going to be really close. Hitting for 10 extra dmg per swing wont do much if you're mezzed or dead.  <br><br>Also - consider the bounty point totems and other charged items when rvring.... a full bar of endurance regen for 400 bps can give you enough juice to style down a few more albs/hibs or sprint away.... im just blabbing now  better sleep   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/uxumten.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xumten</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/6/02 8:12:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Skald Realm Abilities</span><hr size=1> What about serenity? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/uwhorde.showPublicProfile?language=EN>whorde</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/12/02 1:02:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Skald Realm Abilities</span><hr size=1> far and away best abilities:  ignore pain, purge, long wind 1<br><br>those will save your ass over and over and over and over again.<br><br>good stuff to buy for 1 point:<br><br>aug con 1<br>toughness 1<br>long wind 1<br>lifter 1 (if you rvr, helps a ton to carry siege parts)<br>avoid magic 1 (level 2 better but costs 3 more pts)<br><br>i want someone to confirm that tireless 1 regens end while running, i was told it only regen'd end while IN COMBAT only.<br><br> <p>[Chat] Delvis: gah phleet is always an annoying fuck no matter what character he's on it seems ...</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/ustyranpsalmsinger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Styran Psalmsinger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/13/02 4:38:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Skald Realm Abilities</span><hr size=1> I can confirm that it does...it's very slow but it does.

Right now - I don't know a lot, so this probably contains a lot of garbage. The friars have done a lot of testing, so I have used some of their data. Please give me your comments<br><br>Augmented Strength<br><br>Description<br>A passive ability that increases your strength by 6 each level. Cost per level is 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. Level 3 is required for Mastery of Arms.<br><br>Testing<br>At level 50, a skald should have over 100 strength (unbuffed). Can someone do tests (or does someone already know) on how much an increase of strength by 6 points will add to damage (styled and unstyled damage.)<br><br>Analysis<br>Strength is the damage determining stat for the Skald. At a cost of 1 point, level 1 in Augmented Strength seems like a no-brainer. Further levels depend on how much an increase in damage you will see. Mastery of Arms is reported to be a poor investment, so increasing Augmented Strength to level three is not necessary for that ability.<br><br>Augmented Dexterity<br><br>Description<br>A passive ability that increases your dexterity by 6 each level. Cost per level is 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. Level 2 is required for Mastery of Blocking, Mastery of Parrying, Mastery of Pain. <br><br>Testing<br>Dexterity does not go up with level for the Skald, so at level 50, a skald should have around 35-50 dexterity (unbuffed).<br><br>Analysis<br>Dexterity affects your chance to block and parry. In general, I would favor adding to my damage, so this one seems a lower priority to me. If you favor increasing your defense, this may be a viable choice to level 2 where you can move to Master of Parrying. Increasing this ability to level 2, will allow Mastery of Pain, though. This allows an offensive increase. I like Mastery of Pain, so am planning to take this to level 2.<br><br>Augmented Constitution<br><br>Description<br>A passive ability that increases your constitution by 6 each level. Cost per level is 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. Level 3 is required for Avoid Pain, Armor of Faith, Second Wind. <br><br>Testing<br>At level 50, it is reported that you get about 20 points per level of this skill by friars. Skalds?<br><br>Analysis<br>I still prefer increasing damage to added defense.<br><br>Augmented Quickness<br><br>Description<br>A passive ability that increases your quickness by 6 each level. Cost per level is 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. <br><br>Testing<br>Quickness does not go up with level for the Skald, so at level 50, a skald should have around 35-50 quickness (unbuffed). Can someone do tests (or does someone already know) on how much an increase of quickness by 6 points will reduce the time to swing a weapon, and how the damage is affected?<br><br>Analysis<br>Quickness has an effect on evade ability, and how fast you swing your weapon. My previous readings on this indicate this is not too useful, because the style damage is reduced when your attack speed is increased, resulting in nearly the same damage.<br><br>Augmented Acuity<br><br>Description<br>A passive ability that increases your charisma by 6 each level. Cost per level is 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. Level 2 is required for Serenity, Mastery of the Arcane.<br><br>Testing<br>From pub36.ezboard.com/fteamsk...D=10.topic We see the total damage (both shouts) increases 29.6 at Acuity level 4.<br>Can we find out how much more power you get with 6 points in charisma?<br><br>Analysis<br>The above analysis is at or near level 50 (highest level shouts.) The total damage increase is 29.6 every 20 seconds. This might mean about 60 extra damage per fight - say 15 at level 1. This seems pretty good for just one point - maybe not worth two though. I believe you will get a little more power, also. Finally, you need level 2 to get Serenity (tests are needed), and Mastery of the Arcane (useless at this time.)<br><br>Long Wind<br><br>Description<br>A passive ability: Your character can sprint for a longer period of time than normal. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. <br><br>Testing<br>Friar test show 20 seconds of sprinting with no Long wind. 25 at level 1, 35 at level 2, 54 at long wind 3.<br>Another person said: I have Longwind II and Tireless II and I can run forever. I think others have said this is not true, though.<br><br>Analysis<br>Don't think I will spend here.<br><br>Tireless<br><br>Description<br>A passive ability: Your character regenerates endurance in combat. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. <br><br>Testing<br>One person: &quot;I have tireless 2, in combat it regens slightly, I get about 1 extra styled attack than I used to. From absolutely no endurance...13 seconds sitting down gets me a full green bar.&quot;<br><br>Another: &quot;Tireless, even as low as at level 1 is priceless. The amount regenerated is not huge, but the real advantage of the skill is that its allow you to regenerate stamina (albeit at a slow rate) in circumstances when you normally don't regenerate AT ALL, namely fighting and especially running. So when travelling, running all over Briefine and Emain, you slowly refresh your stamina pool, almost reducing to zero (with purity of mind and heals available) the time you have to spend sitting, in an environment when you are vulnerable to stealth attacks and need moving quickly.&quot;<br><br>Another: I ran from huginfel to Yggdra gate at Warrior speed and had only regained half my endurance.. thats close to a 5min run.<br><br>Analysis<br><br>Regeneration<br><br>Description<br>A passive ability: Your hit points regenerate faster than normal. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. <br><br>Testing<br>Reports say it reduces time to regenerate by about 10% per level. Only works while sitting.<br><br>Analysis<br>Since it only works while sitting, not a help in combat. Not worth it.<br><br>Serenity<br><br>Description<br>A passive ability: Your spell points regenerate faster than normal. Requires Augmented Acuity level 2. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. <br><br>Analysis<br>I need testing. If it works like Regeneration, probably not worth it.<br><br>Toughness<br><br>Description<br>A passive ability: Increases maximum hit points by 3% per level of this ability. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. <br><br>Analysis<br>Am I right that a Skald at level 50 has about 1000 hit points? If so, this would give you 30 more hit points at level 50. Not really too good I think.<br><br>Mastery of Water<br><br>Description<br>A passive ability: Increases swim speed by 3% per level of this ability. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. <br><br>Analysis<br>I have seen a friend use it (he bought it when Mythic said they were going to wipe the abilities) to great effect in the BGs where people are crossing the moat. I don?t think it is very useful in real RvR though.<br><br>Avoidance of Magic<br><br>Description<br>A passive ability: Increases resistance to all damage types of magic by 3% per level of this ability. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. <br><br>Analysis<br>I need some testing here.<br><br>Lifter<br><br>Description<br>A passive ability: 20% additional maximum carrying capacity per level. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. <br><br>Analysis<br>Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. Maybe if you need to carry ram parts.<br><br>Veil Recovery<br><br>Description<br>A passive ability: Reduces duration of resurrection sickness by 10% per level. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. <br><br>Analysis<br>This seems pretty worthless. At ten points, you can reduce the duration of rez sickness by 30%, or get purge and reduce it to zero every 30 minutes (with other bonuses.)<br><br>Mastery of Blocking<br><br>Description<br>A passive ability: Increases chance to block by 3% per level. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. Requires: Augmented Dexterity at level 2. <br><br>Analysis<br>Does not seem to me as good as Mastery of Parrying. You can parry with a one-handed or two-handed weapon, plus you can spec parrying.<br><br>Mastery of Parrying<br><br>Description<br>A passive ability: Increases chance to parry by 3% per level. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. Requires: Augmented Dexterity at level 2. <br><br>Analysis<br>You can parry with a one-handed or two-handed weapon, plus you can spec parrying. Generally, I do not like defensive abilities, because you are always attacking in a fight, but not always getting hit. I like this better than Mastery of Blocking, but not as much as offensive abilities.<br><br>Mastery of Pain<br><br>Description<br>A passive ability: Increases chance to critical with melee attacks by 5% per level. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. Requires: Augmented Dexterity at level 2. <br><br>Testing<br>How much does a critical hit add to a styled swing against a yellow in RvR at level 50?<br><br>Analysis<br>As an educated guess, say that critical hits add 40% to your damage for that swing. Then, your overall damage will increase 2% per point in this skill. The first skill point costs 5, because you need Augmented Dexterity at level 2. I am liking this skill to at least level 3.<br><br>Mastery of Arms<br><br>Description<br>A passive ability: Additional 3% per level attack speed with melee weapons. Please note that the minimum allowed combat attack timer is 1.5 seconds - this ability will not allow you to go below this hard cap. It will, however, reduce the attack speed of slower weapons, which do more damage per hit. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. Requires: Augmented Strength at level 3. <br><br>Analysis<br>I have heard that the damage a weapon does in styles is reduced as you increase the speed, but not the base damage. This results in a small amount of damage increase, but until I hear otherwise, I am not going to invest in this one.<br><br>Mastery of the Arcane<br><br>Description<br>A passive ability: Your buff spells will be 3% more effective per level of this ability. Cost per level is: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14. Requires: Augmented Acuity at level 2. <br><br>Analysis<br>This is said to result in a small run speed increase but not affect any other of our buffs. Not worth it.<br><br>First Aid<br><br>Description<br><br>An active ability on a 15 minute timer: Self heal that heals approximately 30% hit points per level gained in the ability. It cannot be used in combat. Please note that this ability will heal a different amount of hit points based on what class your character is. Cost per level is: 3, 6, 10. Required for Ignore Pain.<br><br>Analysis<br>The 15-minute timer is not too bad, but it cannot be used in combat. However, if you mez and drop out of combat, you can use it. This makes it nice for a Skald. If you solo a lot, a great way to reduce downtime. Somewhat useful when rezzed in RvR. Finally, it is the prerequisite to Ignore Pain, so it gets points to level 2.<br><br>Avoid Pain<br><br>Description<br>An active abiltity on a 15 minute timer: 60 second boost to physical damage absorption, 10% per level per level of this ability. Cost per level is: 3, 6, 10. Requires: Augmented Constitution at level 3. <br><br>Analysis<br><br><br>I need testing on this one.<br><br>Armor of Faith<br><br>Description<br>An active abiltity on a 15 minute timer: 60 second 150 boost to armor factor. Cost per level is: 3, 6, 10. Requires: Augmented Constitution at level 3. <br><br>Analysis<br>I have heard this skill is broken and worthless at this time.<br><br>Second Wind<br><br>Description<br>An active abiltity on a 15 minute timer: Completely restores your character's endurance. Cost is 10. Requires: Augmented Constitution at level 3. <br><br>Analysis<br>15 minutes is not too bad a timer. Completely restoring endurance could save me many times. Expensive, though, because you need to spend 10 points on Augmented Constitution first. I am thinking about this one.<br><br>Ignore Pain<br><br>Description<br>An active abiltity on a 30 minute timer: Self heal that heals all your hit points (I guess the web site has been wrong on this), and can be used in combat. Cost: 14. Requires: First Aid at level 2. <br><br>Analysis<br>This is a nice-looking skill. The 30-minute timer is long and the cost is high, but what a get-out-of-jail card. I am strongly considering this one.<br><br>Rain of Fire, Rain of Ice, Rain of Annihilation<br><br>Description<br>An active abiltity on a 15 minute timer: Adds a 10% per level heat/cold/spirit damage-add to non-magical attacks. Cost per level is: 3, 6, 10. <br><br>Testing<br>How long does it last?<br><br>Analysis<br>Need testing.<br><br>The Empty Mind<br><br>Description<br>An active abiltity on a 30 minute timer: 10% per level boost to all magic resistances for 60 seconds. Cost per level is: 6, 10, 14. <br><br>Analysis<br>I am not sure about this one. I think 10% boost for 2 minutes an hour is not enough to spend 6 points on.<br><br>Mystic Crystal Lore<br><br>Description<br>An active abiltity on a 5 minute timer: Self-only boost to power, not usable in combat. Cost per level is: 3, 6, 10. Required for Raging Power.<br><br>Testing<br>It is reported that the first level adds about 20% to your power. One report says the second level adds 70%.<br><br>Analysis<br>The 5-minute timer is not too bad. Getting your power from 0% to 20% can really cut your downtime. (Power regenerates the slowest when below 50%.) This one looks like a possibility.<br><br>Raging Power<br><br>Description<br>An active abiltity on a 30 minute timer: Full power heal, usable in combat. Cost is 10. Requires: Mystic Crystal Lore at level 2. <br><br>Analysis<br>Not sure how important this is for a Skald. Our DD spells are on a timer. Resetting our power to 100% is nice, but won't turn a fight. I don?t think that I will be taking this one.<br><br>Purge<br><br>Description<br>An active abiltity on a 30 minute timer: Dispel all negative spell effects from your character, such as rez sickness, DOTs, poisons, mesmerization, stun, etc. Cost is 10. <br><br>Analysis<br>Some don't like it and have not bought it. &quot;Except for a healer there is no use for any other class to use Purge since what is the use of being the only one not mezzed against a whole group? it might be ok for solo rvr but most of us except stealther are doing more group related rvr then head to head, right?&quot;<br>Others have bought it and like it. <br><br>Others have it and like it. &quot;Many times when our battleline gets pushed through, and we have to retreat, I have been mezzed. As the large wave approaches, I purge and continue running away! If I hadn't had purge, I'd have died 3 times the last time I went RvRing...&quot;<br>My thoughts: Great get out of jail card. I think this one eventually should get points.<br><br>Fury of the Gods<br><br>Description<br>An active abiltity on a 30 minute timer: A group damage-add spell that lasts for 30 seconds and stacks on top of other damage-add effects. This ability is percent-based, so its damage goes up with the user's level. Does not stack with Triple Wield or Rain of Fire/Ice/Annihilation. Cost is 14. <br><br>Testing<br>How much damage does it add?<br><br>Analysis<br>In 30 seconds, you can swing maybe 7 times? If you miss three of those, you and your group might get 4 hits. On those 4 hits, you get an adder, but lose Rain of Fire/Ice/Annihilation bonuses. I don't know how much damage it adds, but at a cost of 14 and a 30-minute timer - unless it adds a bundle - forget this skill.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kilgour>Kilgour</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Contributor</span><br>  Posts: 55<br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/25/02 12:37:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Skald Realm Abilities</span><hr size=1> Nice analysis.

It was the first one I chose, and I use it nearly everytime I'm out in the frontier. Nothing better than when a caster mezzes the group, but you cast purge, turn and dd dd mez the caster.  It's a nice skill against minstrels. I also use it in PvE against rez sickness.<br><br>I also bought 2 acuities.  I'm really happy with the damage added to the dd, as I use them ALOT.
