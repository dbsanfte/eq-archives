I had just finished speaking with my guildmaster and obtaining my new spell scrolls as I had just reached a new plateau of understanding in the arts of enchantment and could now scribe these new, very powerful spells in my spell book.  At this moment I could say I may have been the happiest elf in all of Norrath.  I had adventured throughout most of Faydwer and was preparing to set sail to Antonica and meet the humans that reside in Freeport.  I spent most of my life alone, with no family, and few friends.  The only people I had ever really interacted with were the people I had met along my adventures, the Master Illusionists that had taught me for so many years, and my best friend Villalobo, he and I met at a young age, and for some reason just seemed to understand each other.  Although I had only just reached the age of 16 I felt that I was ready to embark upon this journey alone....I was wrong.  <br>
<br>
I made my way down the streets of Felwithe in my usual happy go lucky manner and set forth across the Faydark. Two days later I had reached Butcherblock mountains and the dock at which I would catch the Boat to Freeport.  Strangely enough I had never looked to my map on the entire journey to Butcherblock to find my way, it seemed as if I just new the way.  I had experienced things like this before while adventuring, and just figured that it is a gift that is given to all who study the magic that I study.  as I began to walk down the dock an overwhelming feeling of Deja Vu came over me, as exhilarating as it was it left me feeling a little shaken and I needed to take a seat.  The boat came, I boarded settled into my quarters and let the rhythm of the waves rock me to sleep.  <br>
<br>
I must have slept for over a day when suddenly the boat began to sway, a little at first but soon after began to rock violently.  People were running about screaming in terror, the warriors and other adventurers began to prepare themselves for combat.  I jumped up, slipped on my robe, and prepared for battle.  As I ran to the deck I saw quite possibly one of the most terrifying vile creatures I had ever seen, he stood as tall as a Giant, with a putrid yellow skin, and only one eye in the middle of his head.  I watched one dwarven paladin charge him and get hurled out to sea as if he were a fly.  The wizards and magicians began hurling powerful fire, and Ice spells at the creature slowing it down, but not quite stopping it.  I was frozen in terror, I could not move, I could not speak the words needed to recant the spells to help those who needed me. Suddenly it seemed like time stood still, and I was being lifted out of my body, next thing I new I was speaking, instilling light breezes in the minds of the magic users, and hasting the melee combatants.  I was casting my brand new spells with ease, knowing the words that I had just scribed not a week ago as if I had spoken them for years.  Suddenly some neighboring aqua goblins caught wind of the fray and decided they would try to rob the ship while it was under attack.  I found myself mesmerizing 4 and 5 goblins at a time while stopping occasional to evoke mind destroying spells on the Giant beast.  After what seemed like hours of fighting we brought the vile beast to death, and the rest of the people dispatched the goblins rather quickly.  Many of the combatants began to thank me and congratulate me on a job well done.  Exauhasted I made my back to my quarters to get some rest.<br>
<br>
I laid down and closed my eyes still not quite sure how I had performed the stunt earlier in the day, and began to drift off to sleep.  While sleeping I was haunted by a human shaped figure who stood just far enough away that I could not make out any distinct features.  He spoke to me in my dreams and explained that it was he, not I who began casting those spells earlier that day, and that the two of us were to embark upon a journey together to master the arts of enchantment.  I disagreed, claiming that I was responsible for the fighting, and telling him that I knew what I was doing, and did not need his help at all.  This seemed to upset him, yet he laughed.  His laugh grew from a small chuckle, to an unnerving cackle, and eventually into a hysterical screaming, the screaming grew louder, and louder until it seemed to drown out everything, even the thoughts in my head.  I cupped my hands over my ears but could not shut it out, it grew louder, and louder, until suddenly I found myself awake, sitting in my cabin upon the ship.  My hands were still cupped over my ears, and I felt an awful sense of dread, and pain.  I removed my hands from my ears to reveal small streams of blood, that had trickled from my ears, onto my hands, and down my sleeves.  What was wrong with me, was I loosing my mind, what was I to do, I would be in Freeport shortly and could not run around looking like this, talking to people inside my head, and bleeding all over the place, they would think I was some insane beggar and the Freeport Militia would surely lock me up in some cell somewhere and throw away the key.  <br>
<br>
Soon after we began to approach the dock to Freeport, I had washed myself up, and was trying not to think about the events that had transpired the previous evening.  We docked, I deboarded, and went to an inn to have a drink, and settle my nerves.  Upon entering East Freeport I noticed again that everything looked familiar, and it seemed as though this was not my first time here.  After having quite a few drinks I became drunk and was ready for bed.  <br>
<br>
I rented a room there in the inn, filled a wash basin full of water and set it on the fire to warm up to cleanse myself.  After washing up I laid down and again fell fast asleep.  I was again visited by the human, and again he began to speak.  He said that he and I were the same person, that he was a part of me, and I was a part of him.  I listened, not because I believed what he was saying, but because I was afraid of what might happen if I disagreed with him again.  I did not speak, I did not move, I just listened.  His voice grew softer, and more soothing, not quite as intimidating nor scary.  He told me that the next day I would travel to Qeynos and there I would find a hidden chest full of treasures that I could keep, and call my own.  <br>
<br>
I was awakened by the bright sunlight coming in through the window of my room, I gathered my things and set out to find a druid to teleport me to the Karanas, the run to Qeynos would take forever if I tried to make it all on foot.  I pulled together almost ten platinum to afford the teleport to North Karana and found a kind druid to teleport me.  Upon arriving in Karana and receiving wolf speed from the druid I began to run to Qeynos, as the man said.  When I arrived I followed his directions into the Aqueducts and after hours of wandering around felt a strong urge to swim through a tiny opening in one of the water tunnels.  I dove in, swam through the opening, and surfaced in a room with a chest in it.  When I opened it I was in awe, it had a new robe, new clothes, new jewelry, thousands of Platinum pieces, and lots of gems that I could practice my jewelcrafting with.  I took off my old senior apprentice robe and began outfitting myself with the new clothes.  Strangely enough after I put on all of the new items and gathered up all of the platinum pieces I felt a sense of calm come over me, as if I had found a piece of myself in that chest that had been hidden in there for years.  At the time I did not know it, but I had.<br>
