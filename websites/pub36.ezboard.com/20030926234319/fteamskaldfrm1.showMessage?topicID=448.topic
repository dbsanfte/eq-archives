&lt;skald rant on&gt;<br>
<br>
First, backround on me.  Skald #1 to 43rd level hammer spec Nimue.  Skald #2 to 50th level axe spec on MLF R4L1 atm and going up quickly.  Skalds are by my favorite class in the game, and I think I have a decent knowledge of them.  I also follow the teamskald board and this one daily.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't go as far as to say skalds are gimped, rather the class the game forgot.  Skalds used to be overpowered in the early life of this game, and because of that many non-skald players have developed a &quot;who care's&quot; attitude.<br>
<br>
Skalds don't need beefing-up per se, but they do need to be brought up to the current state of the game.  Common sense fixes such as making the range of our damage chant 1500, and combining the resist chants in some way are way overdue.  It's those things that matter to me and I feel most skald players more than anything else.  Make + to BS mean something or take it off items and replace it with something useful.  Our heal chant heals 12 hp per tick at 50 spec! That's near useless.  Pulses dropping.  All these are just COMMON SENSE fixes, some implimented in other classes, and others just long overdue.<br>
<br>
As far as an increase in melee damage, I don't know.  I think we do decent damage, but imo it is on the low side.  I understand we are hybrids and not supposed to be doing tank like melee damage.  Tough call on this one.<br>
<br>
Things I would like to see changed (notice how I say changed and not fixed) are as follows: End usage on spells either reduced or eliminated all together.  I once heard it was there as a way of limiting damage or something, but I have no real idea why spells use end as well as power, for any class.  Power usage for skalds is incredible as well, mabye a slight toning down of our mana usage would be a decent addition.  Resists are a major issue for many classes, but for skalds a high body resist can mean basically uselessness.  I don't have logs, but from my experience (and I'm sure many many many skalds will back me) I get resisted a lot. A lot by yellows, a lot by blues, and even some by green con players.  When not resisted, and again a high body resist isn't hard to get (items with +body are pretty common), damage delt with dd's is almost insignificant, and mez lasts long enough to not be useful but just annoying.  Do I have a change for this?  Nope.  Increasing dd damage and mez time seems kind of unreasonable, and changing the resists from what they currently are would be difficult and effect more then just skalds (which is what we're talking about).  My only even close to a suggestion is to take skalds dd's and put them on par with minstrel's, aka on a 15 sec timer and one of the final dd's does a bit more damage on the minstrel's side.  Without power comsumption decreases that would be a bad move anyway.  Tough call.<br>
<br>
Being a hybrid, and a melee hybrid at that, I swing my axe at thing a lot.  Which puts me up front.  Which means I get mezzed and rooted and stunned every fight.  Why don't skald's get determination?<br>
<br>
Defensively, I'm kinda divided.  I don't think we should get shield spec and I don't think we should get more spec points to dumb into parry.  Dodger seems pretty good to me, and evade II mabye, but I don't know how much of a difference that would make.  More hit points? Nah, I'm semi beefy, not as much as a warrior, but I think skalds are ok there.<br>
<br>
Realm abilities I am pretty passionate about.  I have seen group friendly RA's such as Speed of Sounds and Bunker of Faith win fights.  Lord knows our unique RA is crap, and I'm left wondering why mid as a whole doesn't have very many good unique RA's, and NO group friendly unique RA's.  I read one suggestion somewhere trolling these boards to make all similar classes share unique RA's, aka druids and clerics and healers would all have Perfect Recovery and Group Purge and Bunker of Faith.  Wuld be expensive to get a lot of unique RA's like that, and would take their uniqueness away, but mabye a good change.<br>
<br>
I know for a fact that the only person that Mythic and the Dev's listen to for feeback on classes are the team leads.  And I know for a fact that skalds are on the bottom of the priority for classes to be fixed/changed list (I have a friend that plays on pend exclusively and is on the &quot;in&quot; I guess you could say).  I will agree there are other classes out there that need more help then skalds, but I think we should be FAR from the bottom.  Kinda in the middle somewhere.  Rosie is a great team lead, she is way on top of things, and tests immedialty when a bug is suspected.  She has ideas and fixes for everything, and I get the feeling the skald community is pleased with her (as I am).  My only bit of criticism (constructive :-) ) is to be more vocal.  The enchanter team lead is screaming his head off about his class, and enchanters in my opinion need a little toning down.  But he's yelling none the less, and look where chanters are now.<br>
<br>
Well, inserting the usual disclaimers here (INSERTED), and please feedback away.  On a side not it was 5am when I wrote this, and I was running around emain so if you find errors gramitically etc /ignore.  I feel I have presented a balanced idea of where skalds stand today, and I hope the readers (j00!!!) can see that I'm not a powermongering player looking to make my class ub3r 7337 or something.<br>

The cause is the fact that the skald was &quot;overpowered&quot; in the early phases of the game. <br>
<br>
Well, that was before realm abilities, crowd control &quot;tone down&quot;, &quot;anti-twisting&quot; code, various damage add fixes and nerfs, snare fix/nerf, defensive skill fixes, the caster/resists patch, the &quot;melee&quot; patch, the pure tank boosts, the hybrid boosts during both caster and melee patch (where the skald was the only single &quot;hybrid&quot; class in the game that didn't get any bone ... check the notes if you don't believe me ....) ... but still. In the minds of some, the skald continue to be the tank mage with speed 5 it was at the early stages of beta. As long as this situation will last, no bugs will be corrected, ever.<br>
<br>
Personnaly, I don't want anything uber added to the skald. I'd be pleased if we get evade II, attack speed song, more range on shouts (my newer pet peeve : no class ever should be useless on keep walls) or anything, but I don't thing it is vital for our class. <br>
<br>
However, those bugs, those little issues that could/should be easy to figure out and correct (like the missing pulses, the power cost on our shouts, dmg add stacking, the song of rest-in-peace), are so annoying they are detrimental to the fun of playing the class. <br>
<br>
I feel more and more that we are like the bard in everquest. A class that was designed with a &quot;vision&quot; in mind by a designer who has since left or moved to other responsibilities, and is now forgotten by a live team that doesn't quite know what to do with us. I think Myhtic has no clue anymore about what skalds are supposed to be, what they are supposed to do, what role they are supposed to play. They can't sort out anymore which of the skald issues are design decisions, and which are bugs. <br>
So, as long as the player base will keep quiet about skalds and have their attention focused on other bitches, they will conveniently &quot;forget&quot; to take a look at the skald class. They will delay the day they'll have to take a look at the skald class and have to take real decisions about it until there will be months of 75 pages long threads on the VN boards, thane style. Because &quot;skalds are fine&quot; (tm)  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mbolme>mbolme</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Contributor</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/13/03 12:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=448.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I agree</span><hr size=1> I agree with the posters here. The skald isn't that far from being finished. A couple minor changes/additions, and we are back in business.<br>
<br>
&gt; making the range of our damage chant 1500, and combining the <br>
&gt; resist chants in some way are way overdue.<br>
<br>
Yep - wouldn't over-power us and it would make damage add useful in RvR. Why not?<br>
<br>
&gt; Lord knows our unique RA is crap<br>
<br>
Yes it is worthless - no class should have a class RA that is NEVER taken.<br>
<br>
&gt; more range on shouts (my newer pet peeve : no class ever should be useless on keep walls)<br>
<br>
Amen! It is so frustrating to see them and run up to the wall but almost always have them either out-of-range or out-of-view.<br>
<br>
&gt;  attack speed song<br>
<br>
That would be nice.<br>
<br>
&gt; Resists are a major issue for many classes, but for skalds a high <br>
&gt; body resist can mean basically uselessness.<br>
<br>
I think the damage type should be changed on mez (and maybe the DDs too). Skalds would be so much more useful if their Mez was not on the same immunity timer as the healers. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vivaxkithicor>Vivax Kithicor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Member</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/14/03 7:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=448.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I agree</span><hr size=1> The only &quot;fix&quot; for skalds I can remember in the past year has been the addition of &quot;Hasteners&quot; who lessen the added value of run speed a tiny bit.<br>

Great.<br>
<br>
On Guinevere the healer shortage has been alleviated a bit over the past 4 months, but now skalds are in the shortest supply versus server demand.<br>
<br>
As a skald who just returned from a 4-month afk session, I see nothing has changed to skalds.  We continue to sink in relative ability.<br>
