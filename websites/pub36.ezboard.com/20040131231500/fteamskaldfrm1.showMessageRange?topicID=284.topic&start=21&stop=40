<br>
The 46/44 template offer that +15dmg per swing... for all tanks in the group, lets' say there's 2 other tanks that virtually make 45 more dmg per swing. Add to that the +50 dmg granted by lvl 44 shot... wee... hey I'm fine with that front end damage.<br>

IMO the 46/44 (or 46/46 if you dont have pary) is much more group friendly.<br>

Everything I have said can be found on thousands of posts on the vault by little # crunchers like yourself.   Thousands of posts, hundreds of topics, all that came to conclusions that Mythic shares, Players share, # crunchers share, and I share.<br>
<br>
Trying to say well known game facts that have been clearly documented by hundreds of players and Mythic themselves are &quot;emotion&quot; is pretty stupid of you.<br>
<br>
Again you just don't get it.   Thats fine with me.  I made certain points up to FOUR times for you, but you still can't grasp a simple concept.<br>
<br>
This is no longer a debate.  This is just you and your cave troll #'s wasting the time of someone who obviously know's way more about the game mechanics than you do.<br>
<br>
Moving on now.<br>
<br>
&quot;IMO the 46/44 (or 46/46 if you dont have pary) is much more group friendly.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes Kluk you just may be right.   But I would ask you this.<br>
1:  How many hits with the 6sec pbt does your party miss?<br>
2:  THE BIG ONE... How many times do you fail to turn it on?<br>
3:  What is more important to your group... Killing a pbaoe'ing lurikeen or a bard, or a scout shooting your healer for 1k+?<br>
4:  Your mezd<br>
5:  Your tanks are mezd<br>
<br>
<br>
Of course if you can take care of all of this, and keep that song rolling, your doing just fine.   As for me, I find I forget to turn it on half the time so the extra spec points were just kind of a waste.  When I do remember to turn it on, it really seems to me the 35 does just fine.<br>
<br>
The little more group friendly skald is just fine though, if thats your gig.<br>

in reality, what mance hits for is generally about 250-350, probably around 450 on blues and casters.  that would be his average shot.  once in a while though he gets a nice crit in the 650+ range, and sometimes even a little higher.  <br>

I already said I &quot;normally&quot; hit for around 300's +50 pnt dmg add.  Can you not read?<br>
<br>
I frequently hit for 300's + dmg add + a crit, averaging 400-800 pnt hits.<br>
<br>
TWENTY-FIVE percent of the time I land a crit on top of a normal hit.  This isn't once in a blue moon you idiot.  1/4 of your shots with MoPx3 are crits.  Your normal chance for a crit is 10%, it goes up 5% per lvl of MoP.  (I could be totally wrong and it may be only 5% , which would lead your % chance to land a nice crit at 20% not 5%, which is still pretty damn frequently.)<br>
<br>
This isn't opinion.  These are game facts.  Your failure to already recognize them as game facts just proves your an idiot.  But I find it hard to believe you've ever had a problem with accomplishing that. <p><center>

<br>
Amusing that you still can't comprehend what you've read, what I'm asking for, nor what Mance has said.<br>
<br>
Mance says he likes 50 spec.  It forgoes parry and battlesong in favor of 50 axe, for the 50 axe style, and since he feels parry is worthless.  He also understands that crits do damage, and that R5 chracters have their damage caps raised so that they can get the full benefit from the 16.5 dps weapons.  He knows he gives up the last dmg add and DD, but feels he does more with 50 axe.  He also feels the 50 Axes style is way better than any other style we have access to, and his well worth getting 50 spec for.  He's also happy with his spec regardless of what we discuss.<br>
<br>
Does that about sum it up?  Maybe you should glance at the subject title.  What?  Threads have subjects?  I'm unsure why you think I don't understand his post....maybe you don't understand mine.  I'll summarize it like I did on the one above for you, because you seem to have special needs.<br>
<br>
1. What is the difference between 44 axe damage and 50 axe dmg when you add in items/ranks to get you over 50 with both? (note we don't care about MoP, nor R5, nor weapon quality, nor anything else really, it's a comparison with other variables held constant.)<br>
<br>
2. What's % of base damage does the 50 axe style do over the other axe styles?<br>
<br>
3.  Does this delta damage make up for the loss of the last damage add, the last DD, and the loss of both parry and parry chains? <br>
<br>
 Do you see anything in there about wanting to know how someone &quot;feels&quot; about their spec?  I've already said numerous times that I'm happy for anyone that's happy with their spec, Mance included.  So please dont' confuse your agenda with mine.  Don't you get it?  I HOPE 50 axes is as good as some people seem to think, I can respec to it any time, and for the slash bonus to hibs alone it might be worth getting Axe over Hammer.  But the question remains.  Technically what's the difference between 44 and 50 spec?  Why would you NOT want actualy log #'s over someone's emotional response?  I get ONE respec, I'm not about to waste it on a whim.  If you can't understand that, please refrain from &quot;contributing&quot;, if that's what you call it, to this post.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I posted my test logs to help others wondering the same thing.<br>

Why can't you just post logs or links to other threads, rather than get off topic and attempt to make this you against others?  You are MISSING THE POINT.  We want some data, not your exaggerated, off-topic opinon.  No on disagrees that you like your spec, get it?  We all know how Mastery of Pain works, and once again, that has NOTHING to do with helping people determine if 50 spec is right for them, over some lower weapon spec.  Your personal attacks and tantrums really don't have a place on a public board. <br>

<br>
Phleet - you are just a moron.  Mance isn't ranting and no one here is forcing anyone to choose a different spec, this fact Mance has pointed out too many times to recall.  If you like your spec better stick with it but don't tell others that another spec is gimped when you are totally clueless about it.<br>

The truth is probably that many specs are fine.  My belief in this comes from the fact that Im so tron over what to do with my repec.<br>
47/46/5<br>
   or<br>
50/43/2<br>
<br>
Parry?  I dont care.  Period.<br>
I would p'bly do more overall damage with 47/46 and my group would DEFINITELY do more damage as a whole.  BUT...  I just cant imagine going axe without getting that lvl 50 style....<br>
There are also other good specs too so just go with what works for you and stop the flames.  Please?<br>

You probably already considered this, but if not:<br>
<br>
If you're sure you want Axe, just not sure of how high, go ahead and respec if you don't feel like waiting or can't wait due to level (You lose it in two levels if you're 43 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   , BUT, leave song/parry low enough to allow you to go either way at some later time.<br>
<br>
i.e. For a level 50 they could stop at: 47 Axe 43 song<br>
Try it out, see if you miss the song/parry before deciding to hit 46 song, or the 50 Axe (I have it on pendragon like this, hammer though, so I'm testing it for myself).  My current character waited about 1 month after hitting 50 to spend all his points, I just liked keeping my options open until I was sure.<br>
<br>
Anyway, it's a nice middle ground if you have to or feel compelled to respec right away.  <br>

&gt;Surely I read every post in this thread. <br>
<br>
apparently not<br>
<br>
&gt;Mance has proven the spec with facts already.<br>
<br>
wrong again. mance has proven nothing as he has no facts.  the few statements he makes which are accidentally correct are irrelevant to the topic at hand.<br>
<br>
&gt;Not to mention I play by his side quite often and have witnessed his spec in action. <br>
<br>
irrelevant.  you have witnessed effectiveness, you have not in any way witnessed it's effectiveness relative to 44 or 46 weapon spec.<br>
<br>
&gt;Phleet - you are just a moron.<br>
<br>
nope, actually i'm quite intelligent.<br>
<br>
&gt;Mance isn't ranting <br>
<br>
wrong again, at least you're good at that.<br>
<br>
&gt;If you like your spec better stick with it but don't tell others that another spec is gimped when you are totally clueless about it.<br>
<br>
totally clueless about what?  about the fact that i'm level 50 and have done enough pve to gain another 9%?  or about the fact that i have 935,000 rps, 90% of which were gained in groups of 4 or smaller?  or the fact that between respec here and on pendragon i've had 4 specs?  please inform me of what i'm &quot;totally clueless&quot; about cuz i'm not seeing it.<br>

<br>
Dane had said I couldn't hit for this amount of damage consistently.  I layed out and showed him how a skald can hit that hard with Ra's, RR, weapon qual, and spec.  I'm not ranting, these are all facts.   Simple game mechanics that have been proven a thousand times and that mythic attests to.  Everyone knows about these, they aren't any form of secret.  Did this start out as the topic?  No, but Dane brought it up, so I included it in our discussion.<br>
<br>
Then I was attempting to show Dane other reasons why people go 50 spec is for the bonus gear they have, due to them not having to worry about +weapon items.  A point which I'm still not sure Dane has grasped.<br>
<br>
If you are going to talk about peoples templates be ready for a discussion from all angels as to why they chose that template.  <br>

I don't doubt that with RR5, 100% qual weaps, MoP III you hit like a truck.  What I'd like to see is someone perform the same tests that Dane did with 50 axe then we can compare the results.<br>
<br>
Everything I've seen indicates that raising weapon over 50 has diminishing returns for the amount of spec points unless the style is really uber.  I'd do the test but I'm not 50 yet.  I'd like to know if I'm missing anything since I have to use respec before I ding into 50. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

He's on to something.  Personally, I think this is WHY so many classes are broke rvr - tests are being done on MOBS, and those are the people being listened to by the devs.  The people fighting rvr are the ones that really understand whats happening, and anyone using a 25% weapon rvr (snicker) is going to get smoked.<br>
<br>
The people fighting in rvr know:<br>
<br>
-35% bonus beats anything that drop<br>
<br>
-thrust owns mid unless you scrape together every piece of thrust resist you can<br>
<br>
-shields are almost wholesale worthless - (even engauge hardly works anymore)<br>
<br>
-however bad shield is, parry is worse<br>
<br>
-50 weapon spec destroys opponents in a hurry<br>
<br>
My thane is lethal pvm.  He is dogchow pvp.  Defensive templates (barring shadowblades with evade, which actually has a chance of working rvr) get royally owned like an indentured servant in realm v.s. relm combat.  With the proliferation of body resists, skald spells are hitting for pathetic ammounts (ask misanthrope), so the only thing you really have going for you is some damage output in melee.<br>
<br>
You hit with your spells every 15 seconds.  You swing what.. 3-4 times in that ammount of time.  Where is your damage REALLY comming from?<br>
<br>
Your weapon.  For rvr, any specable defensive skills, (i.e. parry or shield) are a real waist of points.  Not even a 99% shield with 50 spec (as I have) will turn away more than one attack every 8 or so hours of heavy rvr.  It's not even very effective against arrows anymore.  Ignore parry/block for rvr - complete waist of points.  Good on a manslayer is NOT good on another player.  I can block a manslayer every other attack.  I have NEVER blocked or parried an infiltraitor that had endurance.  Mance is one of the few mid tanks actually making some killings.  I see all the rest of our servers 50 tanks sitting with me on the steps of gna crafting.  <br>
<br>
Perhaps, when you are done killing trollkarls, and ready to win some in rvr, you can listen to him. <p><p><img src="http://www.dethguild.com/images/messageboard/silvername.jpg"></p>

<br>
Great advice!  Thanks!<br>
<br>
Actually you hit the nail on the head.  I was 42 when /respec all went in and almost 44 now so I had to burn the respec; i just couldnt wait anymore so I switched to axe.  I am going to go to 47 weapon, 43 BS, 1 parry(hey i got that for free <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ).  I will run tests at that time and decide on how to finish speccing.  That was my plan and you saw the same thing so Im gonna do it.  Man I wish I was 49 or 50 when /respec came out!!!!<br>
<br>
BTW, in just 4 days with axe i see the following:<br>
<br>
IF ur a skald that likes ez play; ie spamming provoke and DDs, hammer is the way to go.  The low end is nice with decent damage.  Im getting more damage (slightly) with axe and some cool bleed effect but using end more quickly; yes i know evernight is low from rear but its not always so ez to get that position for various reasons (RvR is CHAOTIC).  Also Im noticing that im still getting negative adders onto dmg based on armor; I guess many hibbies have slash resist maxxed out.  But im getting negs against almost all mobs ive fought to.  <br>
<br>
Only 4 days so far tho so Im sure it'll improve with more experience. <p>Albron<BR>

I was even toying with going to a similar template (44 Axe though) just to see the difference of the styles and + on scale.  Maybe we can stir up enough fuss to get some good 50 axe style data (including the 50th style) and compare it to the last damage add and such.<br>

Seriously tho (yes I have a point):<br>
Those negative adders with axe vs. scale i posted about a few up wre small; ie 150(-5) so the slash resist was p'bly about 17% or 18% which really equals about 2% or 3% after scale modifier.<br>
