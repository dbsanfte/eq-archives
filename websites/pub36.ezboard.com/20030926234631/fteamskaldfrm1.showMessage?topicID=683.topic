<br>
Overview <br>
<br>
Based on the given definition of Skalds, that we are meant to be in the thick of battle, the Skald community has been able to refocus their testing and requests to fit this definition. As it stands now, our damage output is less than it should be given our lower HPs and lower defense abilities. Prior to SC and the armor changes our damage was consistent, but has declined markedly since. If Skalds are about damage, then several things will need to be looked into in order to take us from our Speed-Only role in RvR.<br>
<br>
Concerns <br>
<br>
Direct Damage Shouts <br>
I know that per the feedback to the last report, the Skald shout line will be looked into. I just want to reiterate this need. Some means of increasing the actual damage done or the amount of spell failures has to be implemented to make this set of DD shouts more effective. The lowering of the End Costs and Power in prior patches has helped, but it hasn't done enough to make up for the loss of damage due to resists and failures. <br>
<br>
Damage Adder range and DPS <br>
Given that the Damage Adder was considered the primary in-battle group ability of the Skald, it would stand to reason that it would be a worthy chant. With its 700 range and the pulse dropping bug, it has become less valuable. The Skald DA, at the very least, needs to have the bugs fixed and the range increased to 1500. Another idea to make the Skald chant more effective would be to allow the Skald DAs to stack with each other like they stack with Shaman & Runemaster DA. One chant at full strength and one at 1/2 strength. It would be unique and make better use of multiple Skalds in a group. Similar to Paladin Heal stacking and Warden Bubble stacking.<br>
<br>
<br>
Skald Defense <br>
As addressed in the prior report, the situation will be watched, but no changes are imminent. I do think that a review of Skald defense is an issue, because currently, Skalds are using RAs to even out their lack of defense. To have the HP of a Thane with their self buff, for example, Skalds must purchase several levels of the Aug. Con. RA and Toughness RA. That's just to even out the HP difference. To gain more Parry, we must spend points on Aug. Dex. RA and Mastery of Parrying just to have the Parry ability more functional because we lack the spec points to do it otherwise. Balancing via RAs is not a good idea, and makes a Skald spend their points on passive, rather than active abilities. Please consider this when reviewing Skalds.<br>
<br>
Group offerings<br>
The other support/melee classes among the realms offer a lot more to the group than the Skald, either within or outside of battle. A single Skald within an RvR group can supply the means to transport the group to battle, which is truly the only thing we excel at. The current perception (and pretty much accurate) is that Skalds bring speed, but not much else. Allowing the DA to stack as noted above would be a positive reason for more than just Speed, as would giving Skalds another group ability or adding a component to a current chant would allow more variety in their group offerings.<br>
<br>
Specline Issues <br>
<br>
Battlesongs- Per the last report, no in-depth changes will be done on this line at this time. I am requesting that the above changes (Stacked DA, new component to existing chant) be considered to allow the line we have no choice in speccing in to have more value. <br>
<br>
Weapon - The concern of the typical Skald spec in weapon to 44 is that there is no return on investment if we take our weapon to 50. We lose more utility/damage if we spec high in weapon than we gain from the higher weapon spec. This seems to be more of an issue with Midgard weapons styles than the Skald itself.<br>
<br>
Parry - The only Speccable means of defense for the Skald is relegated to getting the leftover Spec points. A typical Skald will end up with a Parry of 17. Since we need to Spec high in Battlesongs and Weapon just to be competitive, we have to use RAs to balance out this spec. Lowering either Battlesong or Weapon does not return worthy results, even with the current changes to Parry/Block.<br>
<br>
We would like to also note that an alternative specialization template is gaining popularity: 50 weapon (almost always axe for the 50 style), 43 BS, leftover in parry. This spec line basically throws away most of the benefits of the Battlesong line, with the exception of speed 5 (notably: the "strong" battleshout is effectively destroyed, and the damage add song is a substandard one). However, the fact that some Skalds still decide to go this route to scrape a few more points of weapon damage is a testament to both Skald woes in melee combat and to the poor state of the Battlesong line. I am putting this in again because it was misunderstood. There is very little variance in a Skald spec, because changing it return a less than competitive character. We do need more variety, we don't have that option.<br>
<br>
New Issues <br>
<br>
No changes since 1.62 report effected Skalds positively or negatively.<br>
<br>
Other Issues <br>
<br>
-6 single resist chants, why not 3 sets of 2?<br>
-Fury of the Gods Realm ability <br>
-Design of Skald Epic armor<br>
<br>
Item Problems <br>
<br>
No new problems since last report. Thank you for some of the +Battlesong changes though.<br>

I'm not sure how Mythic takes specific suggestions, but I'd like to list a few items for the BS line, and if you like them enough you can add them to the next report to Mythic.  Maybe if Mythic is given some specific suggestions they'll consider them.<br>
<br>
We are all in agreement that compared to chant/song classes in other realms, skalds offer very little in terms of support or group benefit.<br>
<br>
You mentioned &quot;Group Offerings&quot; as a major subject with skalds, and I'd love to see something new.  I'm not asking for all of these suggestions, but any one (or two) of these added to skalds would be a nice but not overpowering addition.<br>
<br>
*Group End shout - On a timer, would give a % of endurance to anyone within range in the group.  Since this could be on a timer, it would not be overpowered and would not replace the need for a shammy.<br>
<br>
*PBAOE debuff shout - A skald shouting at an enemy to weaken them would make sense for the class.  There could be str, con, magic, dex debuffs all on the same timer.  This isn't overpowering at all, and really would add some group benefit.<br>
<br>
*PBAOE snare - Replace our single target snare with a PBAOE snare.  Without a shield, our mez on the same magic type as healers and no effective stun weapon styles, skalds provide no defense to healers/casters.  Our only role is to assist the main tank in combat, and sometimes try to interrupt a caster in the back ranks.  Unfortunately leaving the main group of tanks will most likely make the skald an immediate target for every caster in the area which means a quick death, so we're usually pigeonholed into assisting.  Our snare is broken as soon as soon as anyone damages the target, so a single target snare is almost useless in RvR unless it is to chase down the lone bard or minstrel that got away.  In PvE, our snare is used to pull, but skalds are usually the last choice to pull because if a target is snared at long range, it takes forever for the mob to reach the group.  If our DD shout range gets increased, skalds will never pull with snare again...so we'll have a rarely used shout on our hands.<br>
<br>
*Haste shout or chant - I've seen this on so many posts I can't believe Mythic hasn't given this to skalds over the last two years.  This should have been put into the skald BS line when the game started.  Skalds are supposed to inspire their fellow Vikings in battle, and a group haste chant to put the vikings into a &quot;battle frenzy&quot; is only common sense.<br>

<br>
I think the report addresses a lot of the issues that are affecting skalds but it misses a main concern of mine and that is with end regen/sprint and RM or even healer speed, you don't really need a skald in the group at all.  Hasteners, end regen potions and the zerker TG necklace are a few of the other changes that make skalds less useful for their speed.  Why then, would anyone group a skald when they bring so little to a group? <br>
<br>
In addition to DD fixes, skalds need a haste or ablative chant to make them useful again in groups.    <br>
