Obviously your argument is so weak that you have to harp on that single thing.<br>
<br>
&quot;This contradicts your earlier comments that a skald was comparable damage to a warrior.&quot;<br>
<br>
ROFL. Nothing I said was even related. <br>
<br>
&quot;Your contention seems to be that a skald has greater survivability because minst are a greater threat and therefore skalds survive longer because they aren't targeted to be killed. Well, that's not how rvr works really. it usually goes &quot;easy kill, important kill, tough kill&quot; in that order. Skald falls under easy kill. Minst falls under important/tough, primarily because most classes can't get a grip on them once they have used their RAs or if they are under the influence of Mezz reduction/immunity timers.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wow. Well I have to say your understanding of RvR and priorities is a bit out of whack. First off, a good player in RvR will understand that there are three classifications of targets: Priority or Important targets (Any caster, any healer), rogues and tanks. Priority targets are not killed first because they are the easiest to kill, although that is a factor. They are killed first because left unchecked they can singlehandedly destroy a group. Minstrels are in a different boat because of SoS. If they are mezzed and not purging, they are lower priority than any healer or caster. If they are unmezzed they are very high priority. Skalds are very low priority because they are a hybrid tank and not as easy to take down as any caster and tougher to take down than a healer (only because if you are on a skald rather than a healer, you have a healer free to heal the skald, while if on a healer, you have one less person distributing heals. <br>
<br>
&quot;for the record i have a RR6l4 Skald and partial ownership of a rr8l2 minst.&quot; <br>
<br>
WOW PARTIAL OWENERSHIP? Whooptidoo....<br>
<br>
&quot;So i've seen it from both sides and i can guarentee you my minst lives far longer then my skald 99% of the time, primarily because i can do my job without being right in the front line area, which is not feasible for a skald to be effective, they must wade in.&quot;<br>
<br>
A minstrel will live longer against retards, but that is all I will give you. Since alot of the people, surprisingly enough, are not COMPLETE morons, I am usually among the last to die. Even some of the worst groups have decent target selection. My group gets rid of minstrels fairly quickly.<br>
<br>
&quot;A minst can maintain a 1000 unit buffer to most of the dangerous combat while at the same time reducing the ranged threat to them while on the move (mezz and kite). Mezz may not stick after the inital cast, but it DOES interrupt, and thats all you need to survive a ranged caster and interrupt healers at a distance, just run around and spam cast it on them, you've done your entire team an invaluable service while maintaining a posture that allows you to live through most if not all fights.&quot;<br>
<br>
It is decent useful as an interrupt, but if you have a decent sorcerer in your group and you are using your mez, you are doing your group a disservice. Nothing changes a battle more than having a cleric or friar rez a sorcerer mid-battle and having the sorcerer get off another mez. A minstrel that is giving everyone immunity timers would piss me off if I were a sorcerer. In fact when I was a newbie minstrel I got chewed out by one of the better sorcerers I have met for doing the exact thing you are trying to convince me is the way to play a minstrel. Anyway, it is useful if your sorcerer sucks, but otherwise isn't a big help.<br>
<br>
&quot;To say the AE mezz is inconsequential is horribly inaccurate, a well played minst can lock down entire armies of ranged attackers with it and cause healers a constant headache.&quot;<br>
<br>
A Minstrel standing in one place and spamming the 5 second cast AE mez is a newbie minstrel and makes me laugh IRL.<br>
<br>
&quot;Skald has 1 timered range interrupt at 1500 units, other then that they have to close to a min. 700 to continue to interrupt casters, then its a timer.&quot;<br>
<br>
A good Skald spaces out his interrupts s othat one is always up. Guess that isn't something you have figured out yet. No problem, you will learn.<br>
<br>
&quot;Minst are designed to be survivable support classes, tho it may be true that skalds and minst both die a lot in close combat with heavy tanks, a minst has the optiont to do his job without being in that situation where a skald doesn't.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, you have somewhat of a point, but again, I would argue that a minstrel in a good group with a good sorc is better served using his DDs and stun to interrupt and helping tanks on an /assisted target.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your selective use of stun is your choice, however that doesn't mean that other uses for it don't make it a very powerful tool, for instance using Stun on Pbaer who is about to nail your CCed realmmates can save them a substantial amount of damage.&quot; <br>
<br>
I never disqualified using stun in such a way. However, skald mez is superior to stun in that situation. If he MOC's stun won't last long enough. In any case, I don't usually run into problems with pbaers. They are generally dead or mezzed before we have problems with them. Guess we are coming from different perspectives here. =)<br>
<br>
&quot;there are quite a fewer other uses for stun, to be honest, your better off using mezz on the move to stop most runners (except those with immunity) because then when you close to combat and engage, you can stun mid combat with no timer concern if the fight becomes too tough.&quot;<br>
<br>
Stun is better in my opinion if you have a good caster in your group that pays attention and can take out the runner without much effort.<br>
<br>
&quot;This would be true if the snare didn't break upon next damage to the target.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mez breakd on damage too. Don't see your point here pal.<br>
<br>
&quot;very very rarely when you are chasing somebody through an active battle field will you land a snare that really sticks for more then a couple of seconds with the tons of AE being thrown around and people trying to take a shot at the target as its running past.&quot;<br>
<br>
Unless I am around a bunch of other groups, we don't really use AEs and people generally are not all on different targets. I guess I am used to more discipline than that. When surrounded by people that know what they are doing the snare is very very usefuk.<br>
<br>
&quot;Additionally, bleed styles, dots and some pulsing effects can break snare.&quot;<br>
<br>
For many purposes the snare only needs to interrupt or snare the person for a few seconds. Long duration snare isnt' what makes it great. It is the fact that it is a shout, has good range and lasts a decent amount of time. Even if it breaks, I have several extra seconds to catch them. <br>
<br>
&quot;Once you've snared and had it broken, you've given the target in question root immunity, which means should they get away from you (like say you get cced or otherwise stopped) the next caster they go after has no CC option to stop them unless they try to mezz (sm)&quot;<br>
<br>
Again different perspectives here I guess. Root immunity is a problem with the snare, but in a good group everyone has to rely on cross-ccing. I don't find it to be a problem and our shammy, who is largely responsible for rooting people off casters hasn't complained. I think it is really a matter of experience and being selective in your use of it. A lot of people, yourself included I imagine, probably spam snare for the sole purpose of interrupting as soon as the timer is up. Well, with selective use of snare, it can be so much more. I do my best not to use it JUST for interrupts except in emergencies.<br>
<br>
&quot;From a skill set perspective, skald snare is incredibly inferior to prevent flight, both in its casted form and its styled form.&quot;<br>
<br>
LOL!! What does that have to do with the discussion? Prevent Flight is a great ability. So? The fact that prevent Flight exists doesnt' have a bearing on whether Skalds are a good class or not.<br>
<br>
&quot;A low stealth high weapon/instrument minst is very very capable of taking down people in 1 round of combat (casters)&quot;<br>
<br>
Bull. Absolute bull. You show me a caster that goes down from 350ish dmg in shouts and &gt;200 melee dmg and I show you a level 40 caster. God, don't be an idiot.<br>
<br>
&quot;Minst and skald are on identical weaponskill tables, the myth that skalds have higher weaponskill was perpetuated by people comparing low str minst chars to Trolls skalds. it's simply not true.&quot;<br>
<br>
Talking out of your ass here buddy. You can't show me any documentation on this at all. I wouldn't doubt it, but again, you are making it up.<br>
<br>
&quot;A minst with an Anchor (slow 1 hand weapon) will do very good damage per strike vs cloth casters, add in their DDs and mastery of pain II (aug str one helps also) and they can approach close to 430 with an opening blow + 300 from DDs, that's enough to take out an unbuffed caster.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rofl. 430? If they have like 0 melee or body resists AND if you are buffed AND if you crit AND if they aren't buffed. Sounds like a LOT has to go right for that to happen. In reality you will never take down a level 50 caster with decent gear in one round of combat even if you are buffed and they aren't. You are dwelling into the realm of the ridiculous here. Get back to reality. People run buffed and almost always have capped resists. If they don't, they aren't really worth using as an example of RvR prowess.<br>
<br>
&quot;Should they perfect crit on the attack or get a positional off, that damage goes up quite a bit.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Plus they can stun said caster and beat on them a couple more times with the positional of their choice without worrying about the first shot breaking their mezz and the caster qc ccing them or lifetapping them.&quot;<br>
<br>
Uh huh. Again. A minstrel will never kill as fast as an equally skilled or equipped Skald. Never. My minstrel had the best gear in the game and never came close to the 500+ NON CRIT attacks I issue out to casters regularly on my skald.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wish i had my other computer up, i'd throw up the screenie of minst hitting mana eld for 419, 189 139 (dds) then hitting for 560. The mana eld lived because he got an insta from his druid. Clearly there is a crit in there (mana eld took shot), but the point is, minst can do = damage to skald if they low spec stealth, which they don't NEED in rvr. Skald can only spec for max damage if they gimp their BS song a bit.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lol. You are desribing an ideal situation. That is a once in a lifetime hit for a minstrel. Two obvious crits. I sincerely doubt that caster had capped resists. SINCERELY. Post the screenie though I would love to see that because I think you are fibbing. =p In any case, you are posting your most ideal situation wheras that is normal to see from a good Skald. That is the difference, your best example of minstrel pwnage is like average for my skald. As for gimping BS line for max damage, I used to be 50 Sword spec and hit for 700+ routinely on casters. However, I do much more average damage now as a 50 BS Skald than I ever did as 50 Sword. You don't know what you are talking about here guy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Refer to my comment about tying up everyone in the back areas with chain mezzes. compare how many people a skald can tie up compared to a minst then.&quot;<br>
<br>
I suppose a Minstrel can &quot;tie up&quot; more people than a Skald, but this isn't a debate about how well Skalds CC versus Minstrels. I said they had better survivability. You made it into a minstrel versus skald debate. Anyway, while the minstrel is back their &quot;tying people up&quot; a Skald is inflicting damage. It is my believe after playing both classes (and not pretending someone else's minstrel is mine) that it is more benficial to have some CC, a lot of damage than a lot of gimpy CC and subpar damage. <br>
<br>
a minst + Pally interaction is greater then any duo in mid.<br>
<br>
WHAT? Dude, can you interject with any more non-sequitors? Are you serious? I know your argument is weak, but at least stay on topic.<br>
<br>
&quot;IE a minst + pally = Damage add, AF buff, Ablative, heal + extras&quot;<br>
<br>
How does this relate to Skalds being a viable class in RvR that doesn't need help?<br>
<br>
&quot;+ minst get insta Stun, castable AE mezz which interrupts.&quot;<br>
<br>
How does this relate to Skalds being a viable class in RvR that doesn't need help?<br>
<br>
&quot;That's ignoring the SOS, BOF aspect entirely. Granted Pally can't get ring of tears, but its a minor issue&quot;<br>
<br>
How does this relate to Skalds being a viable class in RvR that doesn't need help?<br>
<br>
&quot;skald has no favorable duo in mid...cept maybe the RM but thats questionable.&quot;<br>
<br>
A good cave aug shammy/skald duo will be very effective? I have killed full groups with minstrels AND palies included with that duo. Anyway, who cares? Duos are fun, but they aren't the be all and end all of RvR.<br>
<br>
&quot;You must balance classes around how they interact with other classes in their own realm otherwise you can't balance ever. To see the extremes of why ignoring class duo/group combinations, look at the dreds and see what happens when you put a necro + animist in a keep situation. Sure, solo they may not make a vastly overpowered combination, but combined, they can defeat Dozens.&quot;<br>
<br>
WHO CARES? God. Those two classes are not even in the same realm and Mythic has explicitly said they don't care abotu class balance issues as they relate to the dreds. Could you use a more idiotic example?<br>
<br>
&quot;How does that apply to your comment you ask? you are taking it as a 1 v 1 and you beat minst. well for starters, you never know what the other guys spec is, he could be 50 inst/50 stealth for all you know, its not a controlled thing. but you expand it to a group setting and suddenly the minst increases in power exponetially while a skald has exactly the same benefits solo, in a group or in an army.&quot;<br>
<br>
You were the one who said a minstrel could kill a skald solo. That was a stupid comment and now you are trying to cover it up. Sorry, not working. While your comment has some merit, I don't believe that Minstrels are ever really more beneficial than Skalds. In a poor group with poor players they might be, but I think the addition of a sing class that can do very good damage is much more benefical than a second rate CC class with mediocre damage.<br>
<br>
&quot;Additionally, you are comparing a class to class where you put a minst specifically in their worst element, that is close combat 1 v 1 vs a skalds strongest case, 1 v 1. you allow that minst to kite and start the combat from range, suddenly things change. it becomes an entirely different battle.&quot;<br>
<br>
What ever happened to the &quot;cold hard fact&quot; that a Minstrel could beat a Skald solo? Tell you what, grab your misntrel, copy him to Pend and duel my skald. If you beat him I'll give you a plat.  Uh huh. Thought so...<br>
<br>
&quot;Not sure where you've been the last couple of months. But a significant number of servers have a severe skalds shortage. Your defination of &quot;decent group&quot; = exceptional group ona great many servers. your little half-assed insult about my skill level was abit uncalled for, but its clear you feel that fighting 8 v8 and winning is somehow realm combat, so i assume you don't really get the big picture very well.&quot;<br>
<br>
I am not just an 8v8 guy, but I do find your opinions naive at best and you are obviously someone that is drawing hsi conclusions with the zerg mentality in mind. I think that you are going to get a better idea of class balance in smaller group settings. You are probably one of those people who calls everyone that puts together decent groups and plays well, elitist when they don't add you to their groups, no? And there are no shortage of Skalds on my server or any that I have played on.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have a feeling frontiers is gonna make you miserable&quot;<br>
<br>
No I am sure I will have fun. <br>
<br>
&quot;What server is your skald on again? &quot;<br>
<br>
Try reading my sig. <br>
<br>
&quot;out of 210 logged fights between the minst i use and an equal rank skald, i won 188 of them. of those that i lost, he used IP or AoF and AP.<br>
<br>
I'm far from out of my mind, i'm just not a crap minst. Which is apparently all you've experienced either as a player or as an attacker.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
HA! You just rescinded your claim above, now you are going back to it? Bro, Minstrels are a joke 1 vs 1 and I have fought some good ones. A good skald will never lose to a minstrel unless he does everything wrong, or everything goes wrong for him. 210 huh? Thats a lot of fights. I would be interested in seeing those &quot;logs.&quot; Post them somewhere on the forum.  All 210 &quot;logged&quot; fights. I have a feeling you are being dishonest again. =(<br>
<br>
&quot;yes, i hit 5l4 prior to dinging 50, predominately solo. And i suck. completely and utterly suck, beyond belief! Matter of fact, i have a lifetime IRS of 1500+ including suiciding on keeps and playing on one of the most underpopulated mid realms across all servers!!&quot;<br>
<br>
1500 is impressive? Hell, mine is like 2300 and I am embarassed by it (too many suicides). I average 4500ish now and still solo a good 40K a week of the 200ish I usually get. And I play on THE most underpopulated mid realm in DAoC. Thnx for playing though.<br>
<br>
&quot;maybe, just maybe, its possible that you aren't seeing the overall grand scheme of things very clearly. maybe its possible you are wrong(what are the odds?!). Maybe its possible that all those RR6+ skalds running around saying &quot;hey, this is unbalanced and needs work&quot; are not all clueless newbie whiners.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sorry, but there are a few people out there that I know for a fact are great skalds. All of them are happy with the class and have a nice laugh at the expense of those of you moaning about skald imbalance. In my opinion, the skald is a very strong class that is on the verge of being overpowered if given much help.<br>
<br>
&quot;do you ONLY run in guild groups?&quot;<br>
<br>
No, we let other people in our &quot;guild groups&quot; =p I also solo and duo extensively.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you refuse certain classes from your group because they aren't optimal?&quot;<br>
<br>
I/We refuse players we don't know and trust. Not really a class thing. I am sure we would run with a good Shadowblade if we knew one that was decent in a group.<br>
<br>
&quot;if you answered both those questions as yes, you probably don't belong in a discussion on class balance, since you aren't with the program when it comes to game balance.&quot;<br>
<br>
So much for that =(<br>
<br>
&quot;Perhaps, the best indicator you're an idiot out of the last 3 posts you've made.&quot;<br>
<br>
OH NO YOU CALLED ME A NAME!!!! What were you saying above about credibility? <br>
<br>
&quot;- 1 minst with ring in a 3fg force means every other minst can grab a red con pet. magnifying their projected force potential my significant amounts, especially if they can get ranged nuking pets or pets with a CC/debuff ability&quot;<br>
<br>
You are making a mountain out of a molehill. I am sure it would help things, but most minstrels do not bother with pets, even those that are really good at twisting. Not because they don't want to twist, but because a red con pet resists charm to the point it is more of a nuisance than anything. The fact that you said red con made me chuckle a little though.<br>
<br>
&quot;- 2 minst with ring can provide runie like stacking ablative to an entire force. timed correctly, this means every single strike in a 1 v 1 encounter will lose at least 60 damage from ablative.&quot;<br>
<br>
And everyone can have bladeturn, blah blah. It is already happening on my server and it isn't a big deal at all. And ablative at level 50 Instruments is 70 dmg. These are helpful but not battle changing factors. I think that the speed issue with the croc ring is a much bigger advanatge for Albs given the rarity of real minstrels.<br>
<br>
&quot;- 2 bards means entire force has end regen + speed, regardless if the bards are in two seperate groups or not.&quot;<br>
<br>
Good, they can be on equal footing with Mid and Alb now, both of whom usually have end regen for everyone.<br>
<br>
Again, it isnt' that big of a deal. It won't change the face of RvR. It is a neat little trick that will help the clueless newbie zergers out a bit. They need it. Good for them.<br>
<br>
&quot;I realize you categorize yourself as being &quot;good&quot; because you run in a group of 8 and therefore it somehow requires more skill (cough).&quot;<br>
<br>
Eh. It does actually. You are responsible for your actions, you can't hide in a zerg where your screwups go unoticed. Sorry, I do have to say that running with 8 and killing 30 people takes a lot more skill than killing 30 with 30. If you disagree with that, you are sadder than I had previously thought.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sadly, what that normally means is that you ran around an held off fighting the majority of the fights you COULD engage (because the otherside was a bunch of clueless zerging noobs right?) until you found fights you could win, usually fights you either outnumber or you come up on people from the side, thus gaining initial contact advantage which immediately decreases the &quot;skill required&quot; to win simply because your enemy is disadvantaged from the get go.&quot;<br>
<br>
Um. Well, I dunno what a lot of the 8v8 people do on your server, but it is standard practice for us to engage larger numbers. We don't run from anything unless they significantly outnumber us. Not sure how that is different from any other rvr engagement. It is pretty common for us to kill 3 or 4 groups. We have killed up to 50 or so in the open field, but that was a special battle with special circumstances. In any case, we don't bring 8 because we want to fight only other 8v8 groups (although those can be a lot of fun). We bring 8 because anything more isn't enough of a challenge. I know the concept of &quot;challenge&quot; is foreign to many people in DAoC, but I actually like to fight when the odds are stacked against me.<br>
<br>
&quot;The sad fact of the matter is that tho the skald performes moderately well in single group combat in combat situations where they are advantaged from the start, when you go head to head with groups where the fight is even or they start with the advantage you provide no significant bonus to your group. When you go against multiple enemy groups, the rest of your REALM'S force, gains an insignifcant advantage from you being there.&quot;<br>
<br>
Really. News to me. I do very well in large battles, so do several skalds I fight with a lot. Again, I think your perspective is clouded with your own limitations. I only wish you wouldn't try and force the idea on others that they suck.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Essentially, once the need for speed ends, IE combat is entered, the skald is a sub-par performer. I could explain why in greater detail, tho after writing this little novel it occured to me that i could explain the complete works of shakesphere and you'd nod your head slowly and then go something like &quot;I'm L33t!&quot; and flex.&quot; <br>
<br>
I am sorry, but I have to disagree. While they are not as effective as tanks with determination, Skalds have a lot of potential to be high achievers in RvR.  Among Hybrids I would put us behind maybe only the friar, paly and a very well played Reaver. That puts us in the middle. I am fine with that. I don't need more help to perform well and I don't believe Mythic needs to give Skalds any more help that takes them out of the middle and closer to the top. Maybe you are upset that you can't do the things with your skald that others can. Maybe you are angry with me because I am an &quot;elitist&quot; and trying to rain on your &quot;Boo Hoo Skalds suck&quot; parade. I am not certain. It is obvious your arguments are not very strong in that you made this into a Skald versus Minstrel debate rather than looking at a Skald based only on its own merits. Minstrels are a strong class and it is a difficult case for me to say Skalds are more effective, but I make the case because that is my experience from playing both classes to a high realm rank and with a lot of skill. I personally believe that a well played skald can surpass the minstrel in effectiveness. Maybe that doesn't hold true if players are not as skilled, I don't know. Maybe your average minstrel player is better than your average Skald player. I can simply say that I call them like I see them and all these Skald player whining is silly. Skalds are in a better place than MANY classes in DAoC and I don't want them to be overpowered.<br>

&quot;Skald has 1 timered range interrupt at 1500 units, other then that they have to close to a min. 700 to continue to interrupt casters, then its a timer.&quot;<br>
<br>
A good Skald spaces out his interrupts s othat one is always up. Guess that isn't something you have figured out yet. No problem, you will learn.<br>
<br>
======<br>
Nothing i can say could demonstrate why you shouldn't be in this discussion better then your own words. between the standing still and mezzing comment and the spreading out your interrupts (which only works if you are goin against one guy, as opposed to an array of opponents), i'm not sure you have a solid grasp as to just what exactly i'm referring too.<br>
<br>
&quot;What ever happened to the &quot;cold hard fact&quot; that a Minstrel could beat a Skald solo?&quot;<br>
<br>
I never said it was a head to head melee fight.  Which seems to be where you are getting stuck.  I said they could beat a skald solo.  Reading comprehension apparently cons +++ to you.  The same goes for the discussion i posed on balance, which you apparently didn't recognize as a related topic to skald improvements.  Camparisons between interactions between the various classes in a realm are a very valid concern when it  comes to realm balance, which is the whole purpose of balancing a skald or any other class in the first place.  The explanation of why it was bad to ignore that balance issue was the animist/necro combination.  Listen close, it was designed to show what happens when class interactions between teammates can lead to overpowered results....which must be taken into consideration when doing realm balance.<br>
<br>
&quot;And ablative at level 50 Instruments is 70 dmg. These are helpful but not battle changing factors.&quot;<br>
<br>
maybe not, but stacking ablative + bof+ af chant + spec AF buff + bubble....suddenly it becomes a big deal when your pair of assisting tanks do a grand total of 45 damage in 3 rounds of combat.<br>
<br>
&quot;Among Hybrids I would put us behind maybe only the friar, paly and a very well played Reaver.&quot;  <br>
<br>
champ?  or more accurately, of the hybrids, what did you leave out in that list?<br>
<br>
Hybrids to choose from:<br>
Friar<br>
Pally<br>
Reaver<br>
Champ<br>
Valewalker<br>
Thane<br>
Skald<br>
<br>
You left out champ from your list of toons that can defeat all but the hugely buffed skald (DD+ Str/con debuff with possible crit).  Aside from that, the only hybrid left for the skald to be ahead of is the the thane and the valewalker....I'm guessing you don't have too many good VWs on your server...brief check of the server stats shows you don't have any possible opponets over RR6 on Bed as Vws.  So i'll chalk that omission up to just not ever running into one.<br>
<br>
<br>
I could go back and point to point your commentary, out of respect for rosie, am just gonna let it die after commenting on those couple issues.<br>
<br>
As for partial ownership of the minst.  I play the minst, they play a druid on a different server. I play when he is deployed overseas.  The reason he let me use his account to make the minst is because i wanted to play with some friends in alb on that server, and he had a lvl 8 minst there with 5 plat on it already i could use to help me level it up.  not sure how exactly you feel thats a big deal.  <br>
<br>
as for the slew of personal insults strewn through your commentary.  i've played with quite a bit of success through 6 different classes, in all three realms, past Realm Rank 6.  apparently i'm doing something correctly.<br>
<br>
For the record, mid igraine worse off then Bed with relation to population, and even worse off if you consider the population that the opposing realms have.<br>
Mid population<br>
 Rank Server      Realm       population<br>
  12  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Bedevere &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Midgard &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp      970 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
  13&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   Igraine &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp     Midgard &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp      881<br>
Hib population<br>
   8&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp    Igraine      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hibernia &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp    1,267<br>
  10&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   Bedevere &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   Hibernia &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp    1,132 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Alb population<br>
   5&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp    Igraine &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp      Albion &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp         1,742<br>
   7&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp    Bedevere &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   Albion &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp         1,555 <br>
<br>
So as you can see, not only does igraine have fewer mids then bedevere, but they face more opponents. tends to have a bit of an effect on IRS.  Combine those facts with the fact i led a large number of relic raids where i had to be allowed to die at certain points, and it makes sense for my irs to be where it is.<br>

<br>
I have a solid understanding that you are being difficult for the sake of being difficult. Spreading out your interrupts is easy to do to 2 and even 3 people. I do it ALL the time. A minstrel spamming AE mez in one spot (they do have to stay stationary for the AE mez) is both a huge target and is excercising utter carelessness. Doing that can really screw up the CC for a group.<br>
<br>
&quot;I never said it was a head to head melee fight. Which seems to be where you are getting stuck. I said they could beat a skald solo. Reading comprehension apparently cons +++ to you.&quot;<br>
<br>
They could beat a skald solo, but only a really crappy one. Honestly, I think your objectivity on this is tainted from having a sucky skald, or playing a sucky skald (not sure which applies). A minstrel could do every single thing right (Get jump from stealth, DD, DD, Mez, DD, DD, melee, Stun, melee and DD till the skald is dead or SOME variation of that) and still have a very small chance of winning against a good skald. The fact that you said minstrel melee came even close to Skald melee shows that you haven't the slightest idea what you are talking about. It isn't close. <br>
<br>
&quot;The same goes for the discussion i posed on balance, which you apparently didn't recognize as a related topic to skald improvements.&quot;<br>
<br>
No, you started posting things TOTALLY unrelated to skald balance in general. Who cares if certain classes are a better duo or not? By your logic if a Healer Savage duo was inferior to a Cleric Paly duo (need to pretend here) that means that Healers have balance issues. Well, no. None of those classes have balance issues. One just might be a better pairing than another because of the way abilities are distributed for the different realms. I recognized what you were doing and saw it as straying from the topic at hand. Minstrels and Skalds are classes with very different roles.<br>
<br>
&quot;Talking about realm balance Camparisons between interactions between the various classes in a realm are a very valid concern when it comes to realm balance, which is the whole purpose of balancing a skald or any other class in the first place.&quot;<br>
<br>
Really. Well, skalds must be fine then because aside from SoS, a good Mid group doesn't lose very often to an equally skilled Alb group. SoS throws things out of whack, but that is a realm balance problem which is being addressed currently by Mythic. Any nerf to SoS will not be a nerf to minstrels, it will be a nerf to Alb realm abilities. Bad logic though if you are intent on winning the argument. That is actually helping my logic because in the grand scheme of things I think Skalds are balanced in the big picture. I would rather have an extra tank in my group than a mediocre CCer.<br>
<br>
&quot;The explanation of why it was bad to ignore that balance issue was the animist/necro combination. Listen close, it was designed to show what happens when class interactions between teammates can lead to overpowered results....which must be taken into consideration when doing realm balance.&quot;<br>
<br>
That is a keep siege it has very little to do with the big picture. I can't think of another duo that is blatantly overpowered. And honestly in a keep siege, if you get wiped by a necro and animist, it just makes you stupid, not them overpowered. That is something easily solved with a few good rogues willing to take one for the team. Don't lecture me about anything on the dreds, I have played there for well over a million RPs. Your example is a friggin joke.<br>
<br>
&quot;maybe not, but stacking ablative + bof+ af chant + spec AF buff + bubble....suddenly it becomes a big deal when your pair of assisting tanks do a grand total of 45 damage in 3 rounds of combat.&quot;<br>
<br>
WHY IS THIS A SKALD BALANCE ISSUE? Jesus Christ. You keep bringing up this off the wall garbage that belongs in a realm balance situation, which in this case is moot. Throw all those abilities into the ring and Mid still comes out on top. I have yet to see a fight albs have won due to ablative and AF buffs. BoF? Maybe if they have superior numbers and also use SoS. Midgard, RAs notwithstanding is somewhat overpowered. This is currently balanced out with the Alb RAs that basically give them a huge advantage once every 30 mins. But speaking as someone who has a collective 10 million or so RPs, 5 of which I earned in Mid I am a pretty good judge and can look at Midgard objectively. As a realm, we are fine. I agree that Skalds are not a SUPER class. They are pretty good..decent, which is what I have been saying. Whether or not you agree with me that Minstrels are a better class I could give a rat's ass. You cannot argue with me that one of mid's building block classes needs improvement. It throws everything out of whack and Mythic does look at things from a big picture. I would be very surprised to see them improve skalds in a BIG way. Small things like the resists, yes. <br>
<br>
So basically you turned this into a Skald verus minstrel argument then FINALLY came back and shot yourself in the foot making it into a Skald balance issue, which indirectly makes it a Midgard balance issue.<br>
<br>
&quot;Among Hybrids I would put us behind maybe only the friar, paly and a very well played Reaver.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;champ? or more accurately, of the hybrids, what did you leave out in that list?<br>

Friar<br>

Reaver<br>
Champ<br>
Valewalker<br>

Skald<br>
<br>

So i'll chalk that omission up to just not ever running into one.&quot;<br>
<br>
Champs are good 1 vs 1, but I don't find them to be on the level of Skalds in terms of total utility, nor total combat effectiveness. This isn't a 1 vs 1 debate (although, I have fought a number of Champions and beaten every single one). I gave palies the nod, but I beat palies 1 vs 1, especially as a 50 BS skald. As for Valewalker, I have played on a number of servers and seen what they can do. One of my better friends in-game plays one on Mordred. They are good if played bya very skilled player, but still lacking tremendously. They are in just a slightly better position than Thanes, although I think Thanes can be pretty useful in groups with high shield spec. <br>
<br>
&quot;As for partial ownership of the minst. I play the minst, they play a druid on a different server. I play when he is deployed overseas. The reason he let me use his account to make the minst is because i wanted to play with some friends in alb on that server, and he had a lvl 8 minst there with 5 plat on it already i could use to help me level it up. not sure how exactly you feel thats a big deal.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't think it is a big deal. Thats the point. <br>
<br>
&quot;as for the slew of personal insults strewn through your commentary. i've played with quite a bit of success through 6 different classes, in all three realms, past Realm Rank 6. apparently i'm doing something correctly.&quot;<br>
<br>
Uh huh.<br>
<br>
&quot;For the record, mid igraine worse off then Bed with relation to population, and even worse off if you consider the population that the opposing realms have.&quot;<br>
<br>
I can concede that, but when the /level 30 was established Mid/BEd was in the worst situation. Hadn't checked since then.<br>
<br>
I may have been rude this debate, but I find the crybaby routine extremely distasteful when the class is in a good place right now compared to a lot of others. You posted a whole wad of BS and as soon as I called you on it, you conveniently left it behind. The 200 logged fights with the minstrel and Skald, the 500+ melee damage, etc etc. I appreciate people who can have an honest discussion, let it get a little intense yet not feel the need to make things up. That is what you did. You made it up. And that pretty much sums up the majority of what you had to say. You made some good and valid points, but negated them entirely with lies.<br>
<br>
Bad luck to you in your quest to get Skalds improved. I honestly hope it doesn't happen. I like a challenge. I like where Midgard is realm balance-wise. I feel that any significant changes to Skalds would overpower the class and the realm and could possibly lead to undue nerfs to associated classes like the Savage and Healer.<br>
<br>
I am open to honest discussions on the subject, but abhore conversations that dwel into riduclousness because of dishonesty and careless inventions of the imagination. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kyldrik>kyldrik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Participant</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/24/03 10:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=767.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.binary-vision.com/stalvalr/images/uploaded/ACF48C.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ok</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I like where Midgard is realm balance-wise.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

You must be kidding. &quot;<br>
<br>
Why? Without Realm abilities midgard groups clearly outperform their other realm counterparts. We have the best CC class in the game, combined with our primary healing class, very good tank classes in the Warrior and Savage (with a zerker thrown in the mix for Prevent Flight + the Left Axe/2H combo) and the best overall caster class in the game (SM) that has great survivability for a caster (Pet intercept + MoC lifetap) and two very powerful specilization options depending on how you wish to constuct your group. <br>
<br>
Alb and hib groups have their strong points as well, but without RAs they are not on the same level as Mid groups. In the end, the realms are balanced group and class-wise because RAs give an advantage every 30 mins or so. Without them, Midgard is clearly superior.<br>
<br>
