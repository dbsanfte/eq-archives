from Sanya Thomas    <br>
2003-09-15 17:03:33    <br>
  <br>
<br>
Lots of stuff here, gang. Read carefully, and test carefully! <br>
<br>
===================================<br>
<br>
<br>
Dark Age of Camelot<br>
<br>
1.65d Version Release Notes<br>
<br>
September 15, 2003<br>
<br>
<br>
===================================<br>
<br>
<br>
As noted on the Herald, this patch will bring change to the overall RvR experience in Camelot. Please note that we are not yet done with this patch.<br>
<br>
Here are a few of the significant changes in 1.65D that we're ready for you to check out on Pendragon. We'd like to thank our testers in advance:<br>
<br>
- We have changed the frontier keeps to provide variety in keep taking, as well as to shift the focus from a single door fight to a courtyard fight at many of the keeps. <br>
<br>
- We have implemented a login check to prevent attackers or defenders from &quot;camping&quot; a frontier or relic keep with alternate characters. <br>
<br>
- Based upon Team Lead and Player feedback, we have implemented many RvR-centric class and combat style changes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES<br>
<br>
- Fixed a bug that in some cases was causing increased resist rates for direct damage spells on epic (level 65+) monsters.<br>
<br>
- We now, by default, display RvR combat deaths in the color of the realm scoring the kill.<br>
<br>
Example: <br>
<br>
(green text)Midchar was just killed by Hibchar! <br>
(blue text)Albchar was just killed by Midchar! <br>
(red text) HibChar was just killed by Albion Keep Lord! <br>
<br>
- The realm ability Empty Mind was not functioning properly. It has been fixed, and the effects and costs have been lowered. Empty Mind now grants 5% resistance per level at a cost of 3, 6, and 10 for levels 1, 2, and 3, respectively. All players who had previously purchased this ability have had the ability removed and the cost refunded.<br>
<br>
- All SI classes should now show up under the proper categories in the LFG windows.<br>
<br>
- /gc autoremove account command is now active. This command allows you to autoremove all of a player's characters from your guild - including any alternates. Note that this command will fail in tota when attempted on a guild leader's account.<br>
<br>
- All possessive class titles in Midgard have been fixed.<br>
<br>
- All known spelling errors in spell text have been fixed.<br>
<br>
- Styles that must be performed from Stealth now correctly state this when delved.<br>
<br>
- Direct damage spells should now delve correctly.<br>
<br>
- Gaining the points necessary for more than one realm level will now award you the correct number of realm skill points.<br>
<br>
- Spell resists from realm abilities are now displayed and applied seperately to the character, which should reduce some of the extreme cases of very high<br>
resistances. <br>
<br>
- Previously, resist debuffs counted double versus resist buffs. This has been changed to make them count normally against item, buff, and racial resists.<br>
<br>
- The /hood command is now implemented. Players wearing hooded cloaks can switch between hood up and hood down with this command. Default for hooded cloaks is hood down. The /hood command will not currently save when quitting or zoning.<br>
<br>
- The amount of aggro generated by any damage add spells (damage adds or damage shields) has been reduced.<br>
<br>
- Fixed a bug where keys that were held down (such as Ground Target,Mouselook, etc) would not work in high framerate situations.<br>
<br>
- Fixed a bug where a key bound to 'Shift-' could fire when pressing just shift under certain situations and keybindings.<br>
<br>
- Added new slash commands, /rpfilteron and /rpfilteroff to enable and disable the RpFilter. This flag saves on zoning and logging.<br>
<br>
- Added the 'Stormcalling' spec line to the Player Market Query interface.<br>
<br>
- We have added a new channel to the system window, &quot;Resists Changed&quot; messages. Any time your resists change from equipping items or spells (including those cast by Animist turrets), the messages will be printed in this channel, which can now be toggled. You can toggle the colors and display of these prints by right-clicking on the system text window.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RVR KEEP CHANGES<br>
<br>
- We have introduced a new frontier keep layout at all frontier keeps except for Dum Crimthainn, Caer Erasleigh, and Nottmoor Faste, which will keep the old layout. This keep layout adds an interior door at the lord tower, and removes one of the doors at the gatehouse. Additionally, new doors have been added at each rampart into the lord tower. These new doors will only allow players from the realm that owns the keep to enter and exit the tower.<br>
<br>
- We have replaced the Battlegrounds keeps with the new frontier keep layout.<br>
<br>
- Outposts can now be claimed by a group leader for his guild with any full group of 8 players. Claiming will require confirmation of agreement by all group members.<br>
<br>
- The experience bonus near frontier keeps now matches that of dungeons. <br>
<br>
- When a frontier keep is claimed by your guild, with the guild and new frontier bonus, you will now get the highest experience bonus in the game when hunting around that keep.<br>
<br>
- Players who attempt to log in near a frontier keep or relic keep that is &quot;under attack&quot; or owned by an enemy realm will now be moved to a &quot;safe point&quot;. &quot;Under attack&quot; is defined as when the doors are actively taking damage or are completely broken open. The safe point for attackers is the portal keep of the enemy frontier they are in. The safe point for defenders is the border keep with the portal pad of the frontier they are defending.<br>
<br>
- Note that players who go linkdead near a frontier keep will, in a future patch, have a 10 minute &quot;window&quot; during which they can log back in without being moved to the safe point. <br>
<br>
<br>
CLASS UPDATES<br>
<br>
<br>
Thane<br>
<br>
- The power costs on all higher level Thane spells have been adjusted down.<br>
<br>
- The values on Thor's Vigor have been increased to be consistent with other spec buffs.<br>
<br>
- The radius of the Thunder Shout line has been increased to 300 and the damage adjusted upwards.<br>
<br>
- The radius of the Call Mjollnir line has been increased to 350 and the damage adjusted upwards.<br>
<br>
- Added the Mystic Crystal Lore ability to the list of Realm abilities Thanes can purchase.<br>
<br>
<br>
Skald<br>
<br>
- Increased the range of the Chant of the Brawl line to 1500.<br>
<br>
- Decreased the reuse timer on the Warcry and Battle Shout lines to 15 seconds.<br>
<br>
- Added a new shout in the Warcry and Battle Shout lines. War Howl is a new level 43 shout and Battle Roar is a new level 50 shout.<br>
<br>
- Skald base hit points have been raised.<br>
<br>
<br>
Minstrel<br>
<br>
- Added a new shout in the Dischordant Note and Lesser Cacophany lines. Discordant Howl is a new level 43 shout and Deafening Cacophany is a new level 50 shout.<br>
<br>
<br>
Savage<br>
<br>
- A bug in Savage's chances to triple or quad has been fixed. Savages should now triple more frequently than before, and quad less frequently than before. Note that Savage Damage Per Second remains the same.<br>
<br>
<br>
Theurgist<br>
<br>
- Increased range of Confusing Gust line to 1500. This is a bug fix.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sorcerer/Cabalist changes<br>
<br>
- Added a L50 baseline lifedrain in the Body Destruction list (Essence Devourer).<br>
<br>
<br>
Cabalist/Enchanter/Runemaster changes<br>
<br>
- The Diminish Immunities line in the Cabalist Vivification list, the Vex of Cold line in the Runemaster Runes of Destruction list, and the Amplify Heat<br>
line in the Enchanter Empowering line have been reduced from 15 to 8 seconds. These three lines debuff damage types the caster herself can cast, which makes the leeway provided by the increased &quot;teamwork&quot; duration the other resist debuff lines have unnecessary.<br>
<br>
<br>
Cabalist/Enchanter/Spiritmaster changes<br>
<br>
- The focus damage shield spell lines found in the Cabalist, Spiritmaster and Enchanter spell lists have been adjusted so that using them against monsters or players higher level than the =caster= has reduced effect. These spells have been used in exploitive ways that make certain encounters much easier than originally intended. Players will now have to use more conventional tactics to get past high-level encounter areas.<br>
<br>
<br>
Warden Changes<br>
<br>
- Increased range on Nature's Revenge chant to 1500.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
- The range on Stunning Flash line was raised to 1500.<br>

A Few concerns.  The change to ice storm for sword looks troubling.  Assault à Ice storm has been my bread and butter for years.  Polar Rift only works well if you have end regen and Baldur’s Fury is kind of week as it leaves a level 18 style as out highend style without Polar Rift<br>
<br>
Changes to Minstrels DDs.  I understand if they gave it to skalds they wanted to give it to Minstrels but man are these guys going to kill now.  I see many Minstrels respecing to 50 for both the highest ablative and the highest-level DD.  A good minstrel is now going to be the FOTM class for sure.<br>
<br>
I still hold out hope for a second in combat chant for Skalds and a change to the Resist setup to make it 3/2 or 2/3 instead of the single 6/1 configuration.<br>
<br>
Defense may still be a issue depending on how many HP we recived.<br>
<br>
I hope we get a respect so we have the option of trying the level 50 DD.<br>
<br>
GREAT WORK ROSEY and thanks for all the hard work.<br>

Now the evade chain is nice, but of dubious use to a skald, and the parry chain, the only one barely usable by a skald in PVE, is still crippled by the horrible rush style, and now there is not even sif's anymore to redeem this parody of a chain.<br>
How they manage to weaken a weak weapon spec is beyond me.<br>

As for the skald fixes. They at least heard our plight for skald survivability, and additional hps are a sensible answer. Also damage add range is nicer.<br>

Reduced timer on shouts is nice, but my secret hope was a range increase. I would trade the reduced timer for 1500 range in a heartbeat. But it is still nice.<br>

Our &quot;fix&quot; is more of a boon to the Minstrel Class(who also got a level 50 shout, and unlike a majority of the skalds will actually be able to use it).<br>
<br>
The 15 second DD refresh is nice, but were still talking about 95% of skalds refreshing a level 34 spell.<br>

<br>
Currently there is no Level 50 shout, its bugged and not be awarded properly, although I suspect it will delve for ~150damage.<br>
<br>
But with that being Said, 50 Battlesongs is still not as attractive as 50weapon. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.cogeco.ca/~bivan/laurelai2.jpg" style="height:203;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

I'm not worried about the fact that Minstrels also got a DD bump, it's not as though we see a lot of Minstrel/Skald duels, and we should win those kinds of fights anyway. <br>
<br>
I think it's crazy to say that Mythic cares more about Minstrels than Skalds -- they care about keeping subscribers and making money.  I'm sure our new DDs not being on Pendragon yet is somebody's screw up and in any case it doesn't affect anything other than our ability to test those DDs tonight.<br>
<br>
The higher damage, lower delay DD shouts should up our damage significantly. The higher range damage song will be helpful. More HP is a pretty nice bonus.<br>
<br>
All in all, I'm pretty excited by these changes. Not everything on the wish list, but a pretty significant bump from where I sit.<br>
<br>
I guess the sword style change is aimed at shadowblades, who didn't have an evade-based style if they specced sword. Doesn't help out us skalds though. The 50 hammer style change is nice -- no skald was ever going to get off the third style in a block-based chain. I still have to think about the Demolish change. <p>Gotter Dammerung - 50 skald<br />

Considering up to now we have had the basically the same damage and same power costs I think our new spells will be the same as theirs.  Here is what is reported<br>
<br>
lev 43 Power cost 28 dmg 111 <br>
<br>
lev 50 Power cont 33 dmg 128<br>
<br>
Now this may not seem great at first but if you look at it compared to our current status using the cookie cutter 46bs, 44 weapons and 17 parry spec its actually quite good with the reduction in timer.<br>
<br>
This is based on DEV damage not real damage for a 60 second period<br>
<br>
Current<br>
(89 + 114) [Current DDs] *3 [20 second recast time] = 609 damage or 10.15 DPS for 60 seconds<br>
<br>
New for 44 to 49 Battle songs spec<br>
(111 + 114) [New 43 spell] *4 [15 second recast timer] = 900 damage or 15dps for 60 seconds.  This is a 48% increase in our spell damage, very nice.<br>
<br>
New for 50 Battle songs spec<br>
(111 + 12<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  [Both new DD spells] *4 [15 second recast timer] = 956 damage or 15.93 DPS.  This is a 57% increase over our current limit but only a 6% boost over the 44DD spec.  Probably not worth it<br>
<br>
This does not take into account the added benefit of less resists due to spell level, which should be major as we are trading out a level 34 spell for a level 43.  Don’t think I will go to 50 unless something else is added into the mix to make either the higher DD worth it or another spell up there.  Currently all we would get is the better song of rest and %20 resists on 3 spells<br>
<br>
Disclaimer, none of this is tested but based upon the Minstrel DD reported specs.<br>

Removing the stun on thrym str? Probably because the stun duration was so low it didnt do anything but possibly trigger stun immunity timer.

<br>
Some possible specs I see now:<br>
<br>
50 weapon, 43 battlesongs, 2 parry (dwarf, norse)<br>
44 weapon, 46 battlesongs, 17 parry (kobold)<br>
50 battlesongs, 43 weapon, 2 parry (troll)<br>
<br>
Possible to go higher parry I suppose but I think most will want the weapon damage back.  Your only overcapping by 4 points with your basic + 11 weapon if your going 50 battlesongs which isnt a lot.  Only trolls probably have the strength to ignore that weapon skill loss. All depends on how much damage we see from 50 BS.<br>
<br>
Bit annoyed about Ice storm also thats a well used style by me.  Would of prefered to see Baldur's Fury become the evade style although some people are saying that Drawout+drawout = assault+icestorm so maybe not a problem really havnt done much sword testing.<br>
<br>
The damage adder range is very nice now I think it will be fine.  Easily big enough to use in a group vs group fight.<br>
<br>
FoG still crap as ever... &quot;style review&quot;.<br>
<br>
Hps increase is fine but I hope thats not it for defense...  50hps is one hit from a nature druid...  Makes toughness fractionaly better.  Still hopeing for evade 2.<br>
<br>
As with others im a little puzzled why Minstrels got it as well still I can see their spec above 44 (or 43 now) is a little lacking.  50 instruments and 43 weapon in the hands of a skilled minstrel is going to be...er... interesting 1v1.<br>
<br>
All id really like to see from here is something done with the resist chants (2 sets of 3 combined) which would help with realm balance to (lack of aug healers) and add a passable reason to have a second Skald in the group, a &quot;fixed&quot; or changed Fury of the Gods and evade 2 + dodger or some type of defensive self ability in the battlesong line and I'll be totaly happy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  . <br>
