Although Gaggrog knows pretty much what I listen too =p  Music to me is alot like art work and ladies, very fun to check it all out, I appreciate some of it, some of it I think is trash.  My music tastes vary quite a bit.  My most often listened to music is probably metal of different flavors.  I don't get into the super hard stuff, most death/black/speed metal bothers me, although there are exceptions.  Bands to fit into this realm that I listen to often would be Korn, Staind (mainly the first album, second one is poser crap =p), Slipnot, System of the Down, Project 86, Mudvayne, Deftones...  You kinda get the pattern if you are into that kind of stuff.  If it is fast, hard, has a tune, is original and some substance to it I usually like it.  Killing babies and pilaging stuff is not my idea of music and if it does not carry a tune or there is no &quot;musical&quot; talent behind the music I tend to move on.  I have listened to some form of hard rock/metal since I first started in on music, it has gone through cycles (I hated big hair bands, and the grunge movement made me sick).  I can usually stick to hard stuff and be happy though.<br>
<br>
A nasty habit I picked up (also very early into listening to music) was listeing to rap music (which turned me onto other stuff, will get to that).  Rap is cool.  I like some of the original stuff, not this cookie cutter bas ass OG crap.  I mean the stuff where you can tell the person is musically talented as well as a lyricist (sp?).  Spoken word with a good groove basically.  Call me petty but I also like the deep bass of the music.  It is almost tribal in nature and appeals to the primitive man in me I guess.  I also like the fact that most rappers are open and very cutting edge, they have changed the music industry in so many ways, from the very beginning of the whole movement.  I don't buy rap though, if I cannot hear it on the radio, MTV or download it, I don't listen to it anymore.  I have not bought a rap album since Highschool (1991 for the record).  Listen to contemporary urban radio stations and you know what I am listening to when it comes to rap.<br>
<br>
Rap back in the early 80's got me into other forms of music, the radio stations of the day played alternat stuff on nights and weekends.  Hence enters Reggae and Ska (ska is the father of Ragae, although I listened to Bob Marley and similar stuff well before I got into ska).  Ska also got me more interested in Punk.  Ska Punk hybrids was all I listened to in college, the music was new, different and had energy.  I still listen to a lot of it, but I got to old for the &quot;scene&quot; so now I am merely a spectator =p  I listened (and still do) to a lot of Reggae influenced music, probably one of the true music loves of my life and going back to it always seems to relax me and I enjoy it alot.  Ska (and the hybrids) are the more upbeat (kinda like a version of metal) forms of Reggae...  Punk is basically primal metal.  Basic riffs, rough lyrics...  If you know the music you probably agree to alot of similarities between Punk and Metal.<br>
<br>
Which gets me to the point, I am into all sorts of stuff.  The more the line is mixed the more fun it is to me.  I even bought the Gorilaz album (talk about a mix of music!) sometimes I am crazy with what I listen too....  Some times I just like the basics.  Radio even entertains me, and midwest radio is nothing special =p  Country is something I avoid, not that it is all bad, I really like some of it but growing up the way I did (countryfied homelife) I guess I just am rebelling still to this day =)  If it is not expressly noted above does not mean I don't listen to it (I love some dance/trance/house stuff, classical can be fun, old rock n roll can be cool)...  I am a man of very diverse music tastes.  Personally I own 500  cassette tapes (old school baby) nearly 700 cd's and even have a stock of records!  Music always has been big (I worked in a music store, indy store, for a while even).  If you ever visit my house I am sure we could find something we both could enjoy and listen to.<br>
<br>
And my ears and mind is always open...  let me know if you have any suggestions!  =)  <p><p><table width="500" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center" height="129">

Metallica on classic rock stations!?  Wtf!? =p) but what exactly is &quot;alternative&quot;?  Back in the late 80's and into the 90's alternative was a lable added onto bands like Depeche Mode and the Cure, basicly the bands that were not rock and roll (you know hair bands, metal, or classic style rock) or not rap, country...  Basicly they were an alternative to what was out there.<br>
<br>
Are you still listening to the 80's alternative or are you referring to something else?  Personally I kinda think of the alternative bands as developed into contemporary rock and roll.  Here in St. Louis it would be like the stuff that they play on the point (105.7).  I think bands like Weezer, Radiohead, Everclear and the such all would fit in that kind of grouping.<br>
<br>
I guess that is why music is so hard to classify these days...  The lines are so mixxed anymore.  Blink 182, punk, alternative or contemporary rock and roll?  Sum41, same deal...  even more so...  are they quasi hip hip?  When I worked at the music store this is the kind of stuff that began to come up, some things are easy to classify but others...  Who's to judge?  =p  Techno is even harder...  So many different flavors, styles and whatnot.  Start adding in re-mixes, compilations and the lines muddy even more.  Even country these days is going through it.  Dixie Chicks, country or pop rock?  Some things are easy to put in the bin, others...<br>
<br>
That is what I love about music more and more as I get older.  There is so much out there, it is ever changing and if you find one thing getting old or boring there is always something else out there!  Some people get so cornered into one flavor of music, if that is there style then more power to em...  But I am always happy to hear about people with diverse music tastes.  Kinda like books, movies and life in general... diversity is never a bad thing.<br>

Swansong was their own record label (the only band label that produced a platinum ablumn by another artist, I might add.  It was &quot;Bad Company&quot;)<br>
<br>
Need I say more?  Sure what the hell.  I enjoy most all rock from the 60s and 70s.  The 80s was mostly a loser with some notable exceptions such as Van Halen and the Police(though both started in the 70s).  The early 90s had a return to some good music, but Ive been less than impressed by most things released in the last few years.<br>
<br>
Apart from rock, I enjoy Blues, Jazz and Classical.  Rap has me looking for a barf bag.  Country I can tolerate if you give me a fifth of Jack first.<br>
