As she was carried she caught a glimpse of a dark castle...bright lights...she heard noises as if she were drifting through a fog. She could feel a change in temperature and light as she was carried down a long hall. Her sharp ears caught the sound of a squeak as a door opened, she heard whispers, then she felt herself fly through the air. All of her body landed heavily on her right wrist and her ribs crashed against something cold and hard. The poor girl found herself tumbling down what seemed like an eternity of cold stone stairs, finally landing heavily at the bottom, and with a loud crack her head hit the last step. She cried out and her thoughts swam...her voice echoed loudly...then all was dark again.<br>
<br>
She lay awake in the darkness for a long time listening to herself breathe. She opened her eyes but couldn't see anything at all, only pitch black. Lifting her swollen hand she waved it in front of her eyes and sighed when she still ould not see it. Taking a deep breath she tried to spek but found that her throat was dry and the sound wouldn't come. Her lips were parched and cracked, she must have been here awhile. Her thin stomach growled loudly, the sound bounced around the room almost like she has shouted....<br>
<br>
&quot;Is anyone out there?&quot; she shouted? No one answered. Phynix slowly crawled to her knees and felt the back of her head. A large bump screamed at her and she felt something sticky on her fingers, blood most likely. <br>
<br>
&quot;alright, have to find a way out of here,&quot; she said lightly. She got to her feet and stretched out her hands in front of her, then began to walk forward.<br>
<br>
&quot;There has to be walls somewhere...&quot; she grumbled. Just then her hands hit a wall. She cried out as her swollen right hand throbbed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now to follow it around...I fell down some stairs I think. They have to be around here somewhere.&quot; Phynix moved slowly with one hand on the wall at all times. it seemed like forever but finally her shin hit the bottom step. <br>
<br>
&quot;Found the steps,&quot; she said as she rubbed her sore shin. Getting on her hands and knees she began to climb the stairs one at a time feeling all along the way as she went. She couldn't afford to fall down them again. Once or twice she heard the patter of tiny feet on stone and slight squeaks in the darkness. Once her hand brushed something warm and furry. She jerked her hand back and had to force herself to continue. Eventually she realized she could partially see the stairs, a light from above was shining weakly into the room from a door. <br>
<br>
The door was a huge oaken thing with large steel bolts and bars in the window. She was in a dungeon, but why? Phynix tried to look out the window but she was too small to see over the edge and her hand hurt too much to climb up. She looked down at the bottom and saw the crack near the floor...maybe if she got down she could peek out through that... The girl sank to her knees and pressed her face against the cool stone of the floor and hard wood of the door. She could see a few torches burning high up on the walls, their light made strange shadows on the stone walls. Across the hall was another door like this one. Phynix looked closer and saw the fingers of a hand poking out from underneath the wood. they appeared slightly green and puffy...Phynix guessed that person was no longer looking for a way out of this place. A large black beetle scurried over one finger and hid under the palm of the green hand.<br>
<br>
In all her thoughts she hadn't noticed the footsteps that stopped in front of her door, or the sound of the key turning in the latch. The door slammed open and her nose exploded with the force of it. She cried out in pain and coughed as the blood tried to choke her. Blood bubbles puffed out of her mouth with every breath she took...she gasped and sank slowly to the earth. The last thing she felt were strong hands holding her head up, then nothing.<br>
