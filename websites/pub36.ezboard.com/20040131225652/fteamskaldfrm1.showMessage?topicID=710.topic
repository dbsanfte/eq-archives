<br>
today i was in df, quite a bit.  i found a rank 4 paladin fighting a berserker and his buffbot.  i got there after the paladin had killed the buffbot and had the berserker down to about 80%.  before we managed to kill the paladin, he killed the berserker.  i chalked this up to luck.  i'm rank 7 by the way.  the berserker is 10k short of rank 4.  eventually i get 3 shot killed by a rank 2 armsman.  401 + dot proc, 255 since i out of viewed him, 457, i mez and flee and the dot kills me.  /cheer<br>
<br>
so then i come back and mess around in DF a bit more.  over by the alb stairs there is a rank 5 shadowblade watching a rank 5 paladin.  supposedly there is a scout up on the stairs too.  eventually the paladin comes down.  i stand well back from the stairs.  finally the paladin comes to me ... i think he knew i had a shadow ... and we fight.  the shadowblade jumps in about round 3.  <br>
<br>
get parried.<br>
hit<br>
get parried<br>
get blocked<br>
get parried<br>
get parried<br>
get parried<br>
get shield slammed.<br>
<br>
i have my 2.8 1h hammer out so i get in a lot of futile attacks instead of the few i normally would have.<br>
<br>
i purge the slam and IP for 1100 or so of my 1432 hits.<br>
<br>
at this point i run around the corner since a wizard is coming down the stairs, he bolts me twice for about 550 total.  the paladin slams the shadowblade, i mez the paladin to get him off the SB and then attack the wizard.<br>
<br>
SB gets out of range but paladin is chasing since he purged, so i attack the wizard and he runs after the paladin who is chasing the SB.  through the arch into the room between the alb stiars and the alb side merchants.  i do about 40% damage to the wizard since i'm out of endurance, i think he's grouped with the paladin as he seems to be enjoying a long sprint time.<br>
<br>
in any case the shadowblade runs over onto the little ledge on the left and jumps off since he's safe from fall damage.  i die on the little ledge shortly thereafter still trying to kill the wizard.  the SB misses his second well lined up perf, and then chases the wizard around and eventually is killed.<br>
<br>
in the entire fight we (rank 7 skald and rank 5 shadowblade) didn't manage to do more than 25% damage to the paladin.<br>
<br>
good game mythic.  thanks for blindly refusing to give us shield spec and 2.0.  or any defense of ANY sort for that matter.  we really appreciate being a second rate class.<br>
<br>
there is absolutely NO justification for not giving skalds shield spec.  none.  other than incomprehensible stubborness on the part of mythic. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.paradoxguild.com/images/phlsig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elvana@teamskald>Elvana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Contributor</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#ff0000>(9/25/03 10:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=710.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: why are paladins so much bette than skalds?</span><hr size=1> There is some justification in it... <br>
<br>
1.  We already have one type of CC... DD,DD, insta-mez, ragnorak, slam, ragnorak, ragnorak DD, DD or similar would be extremly powerful in a 1v1 situation.<br>
<br>
2.  We have reasonably powerful insta-DDs that stack up to good damage over time... behind a shields defense and with 50 weapon now it would be very powerful<br>
<br>
3.  They want to keep the class as 2h as it adds variety<br>

4.  It would drasticaly alter the class<br>
<br>
5.  We have AoF and AP while every other shield class only has 1 of these abilities.  I know its a pain to be balanced by RAs but these seem to be a must buy for a Skald. <br>
<br>
<br>
Btw I dont think Paladins are that much better than Skalds and probably even less so after the 15 sec DD changes.  They are excellent in 1v1 and small group fights but put them in a group situation and they wont match our damage output.  If your getting 3 shot by an armsman he was either buff boted and well tweaked or you need to get better melee resist.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elvana@teamskald>Elvana</A> at: 9/25/03 10:14 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whorde>whorde</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Fervent</span><br>  Posts: 143<br> <font color=#ff0000>(9/26/03 12:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=710.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: why are paladins so much bette than skalds?</span><hr size=1> some things need to be refuted here:<br>

instant mez and DDs are both highly resisted.  both fully and in damage/duration reduction.  this is not a year ago when you were guaranteed 250+ damage on every target and them being forced to sit through a 29 second mez.  secondly, why ragnarok?  lots of hibs on your server?  none on mine.  my back positional has no to hit bonus and hence wiffs on mezd targets 1/3 to 1/2 of the time.  finally, every heard of a minstrel?  you know, that class with mez, aoe mez, AND STUN?<br>

behind 50 weapon you still have marginal damage from DDs which cannot be counted upon. DDs only count if they aren't resisted and that is NOT likely.<br>

<br>
i do not have ANY idea who told you that armor of faith or avoid pain were anywhere even on the HORIZON for 95% of skalds.  a must buy?  i'm rank 7 and i dont have them.  there's a good reason for that.  after you buy first aid 2, ignore pain, purge, avoidance of magic 2, long wind 1, toughness 1, augmented constitution 1, augmented dexterity 2, and mastery of pain 2 to 3, you're already rank 5,8 or higher.  to get even level 1 of both armor of faith and avoid pain you need what, rank 7,5?  do you really think any serious number of skalds are that high of rank?  or even close?  if every other shield class has only 1 then fine, take 1 away.  how about armor of faith since it is such a horrible waste of points.  they are a realistic option for only the most hard core rp farmers as is so that would be a huge boon to everyone else who plays the class.<br>
<br>
paladins, until the next patch, have higher life totals than skalds<br>
<br>
paladins have more spec points than skalds<br>
<br>
paladins have more, better abilities in their chants line than skalds<br>
<br>
paladins have shield spec, parry, and plate armor where skalds have no sheild spec, parry, and chain+evade1 to match paladin plate<br>
<br>
skalds not having shield spec and 2.0 is cannot be justified.  a six second mez on a 30 second timer does NOT make up for 2.0 and shield. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.paradoxguild.com/images/phlsig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=senjak27>Senjak27</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Participant</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#ff0000>(9/26/03 1:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=710.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: why are paladins so much bette than skalds?</span><hr size=1> &lt;&lt;skalds not having shield spec and 2.0 is cannot be justified. a six second mez on a 30 second timer does NOT make up for 2.0 and shield. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
You knew that skalds didnt have 2.0 and shield spec when you rolled one up... yet you still decided to go to the skald trainer.  You were happy for a while werent you?  A lot of old timer skalds fall into the same problem, once upon a time we had sooo much going for us, with non-designer resist suits we did great damage, both melee and through our shouts and we were guaranteed long mezzes and no purges.  Fantastic.  Was a great class.<br>
That is still the image of the class that Mythic should strive for, enhance out abiilities to what we had by giving us something to counter whatever it is that stopped us from doing all we did after this year or more of passive nerfs...<br>
Shield spec is NOT the answer.  Enhancing Battlesongs and a few tweaks here and there is, and these new stronger shouts on 15 second timers works great to that end.  Less being resisted, more damage on the second or both shouts however you spec... now all we need is combined resist chants and _one_ more thing to tweak.  Perhaps something as simple as longer duration on mez to counter resists, slight increase in damage for the same reason... maybe a haste (though that may make us too strong) or some other little thing.  A new chant.<br>
But not shield spec. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=svipdag@teamskald>Svipdag</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Contributor</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#ff0000>(9/26/03 2:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=710.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Paladins</span><hr size=1> What you are missing here, horde is, that Paladins are very, very hard to kill, but they don't do that much damage!<br>

for a skald:<br>

What I am good at is taking out casters solo.

<br>
a longer mez?  last night my mez stuck on the solo rank 5 armsman i found outside castle sauvage for 5, maybe 6 seconds.  so say you increase it by something huge, how about 50%.  now on your standard det tank you need to get off your healer your mez lasts a whole 8 seconds.  wooooo !!<br>
<br>
haste would make us too strong?  you mean like a friar just without all the other buffs and the good styles instead of our garbage?<br>
<br>
more damage on shouts?  you understand that minstrels would get it too dont you?  and to make a real difference, you'd have to again increase the damage by at least 50%.  that way the solo armsman in my original post who i DD's for 125(-125) would be hit for something more reasonable.  so how fair is that to the standard n00b with no buffbot who you then DD for 650 damage every 15 seconds?<br>
<br>
upping damage on DDs really doesn't work, because there is no way you can balance it between resistant targets and non-resistant targets.  upping mez duration is the same.  det tanks laugh at your 2 extra seconds, yet people with no resists are totally screwed while you sit with rest song on regaining half your life.<br>
<br>
i dont want to hear about a slight this, or maybe that.  you have ideas?  let's here them.  real ideas.  i'll give you an example -<br>
<br>
&quot;what i think mythic should do to help us with our DDs is to make us a new shout in battlesongs that mirrors the debuffs that casters get.  15%, 30%, and 50% body resist debuff.  put the 50% debuff at 50 battlesongs.  this would help with our mez duration, and help with our damage from shouts.  but it also could be resisted directly itself, and very few skalds will have the 50% debuff, so it would be impossible to overpower skalds with this change.&quot;<br>
<br>
if you want to argue against shield spec, i want REAL alternatives.  like that one.  not &quot;maybes&quot; and &quot;slightlies&quot;<br>
<br>
a skald should not have to run from a stealther.  or a champion.  or a scout.  or a paladin.  a skald is a MELEE HYBRID.  remember that.<br>

While agree with Whorde that the skald needs serious revamping, a full definition of melee hybrid should be considered.<br>
<br>
The way I see it there are 2 possible definitions to this.<br>
<br>
1.  A character who has the ability to fight and contribute some other support characteristic.<br>
<br>
2.  A character who can be defeated by any other hybrid in the game.<br>
<br>
Based on my playing experience with my skald, we fit the second definition.  I was beaten in rvr combat by every other class in the game.  While a lot of that was due to my inexperience, I still could not outtank a scout, reaver, or mage.  The mage had an uninteruptible cast and nuked me to death.  The scout hit me 2 times for some hellacious damage and I died.  That was my last experience with rvr and /canceled after.  The lgm armorer and rr3 I had was not worth the frustration of a semi unplayable rvr character.  I did very well in pve.  But this game has no real pve content and it became grind after grind.  <br>
<br>
The skald needs more work before it can be called finished. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sjofn>Sjofn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Participant</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#ff0000>(9/26/03 2:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=710.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Paladins pwned Skalds</span><hr size=1> Please God, do not give us shield spec.<br>

<br>
1. We already have one type of CC... DD,DD, insta-mez, ragnorak, slam, ragnorak, ragnorak DD, DD or similar would be extremly powerful in a 1v1 situation.&quot;<br>
<br>
Do you have something against skalds being powerful? Why must skalds always have to be the one that loses? Other classes can always wait out the mez and purge the stun. Im not going to kill anything with 2 sets of dd's. Can't do it now so how will that change with shield spec?<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;2. We have reasonably powerful insta-DDs that stack up to good damage over time... behind a shields defense and with 50 weapon now it would be very powerful&quot;<br>
<br>
Champs have an insta dd and debuffs, thanes have insta dd's, reavers have an insta lifetap and  pbaoe chants. Why is it overpowered for skalds and not them?<br>
<br>
&quot;3. They want to keep the class as 2h as it adds variety&quot;<br>
<br>
No, it removes variety. Less variety in skald specs. Less opportunity for guard in a group. <br>
<br>
&quot;4. It would drasticaly alter the class&quot;<br>
<br>
Hopefully. We might actually be mistaken for a viking class if we had  shield spec.<br>
<br>
&quot;5. We have AoF and AP while every other shield class only has 1 of these abilities. I know its a pain to be balanced by RAs but these seem to be a must buy for a Skald. &quot;<br>
<br>
It's not just a pain to be balanced by RA's, it's completely wrong. Anyway, I would not consider us balanced at the moment even with those RA's<br>
<br>
&quot;Btw I dont think Paladins are that much better than Skalds and probably even less so after the 15 sec DD changes. They are excellent in 1v1 and small group fights but put them in a group situation and they wont match our damage output.&quot;<br>
<br>
If you only measure dmg then yes pallies are below us in ability. If you look at the class as a whole you will see they are on another lvl above skalds completely. Their utility and survivability make them an extremely valuable class in rvr and pve. <br>
<br>
&quot;Please God, do not give us shield spec.<br>
<br>
Give us a new chant. Tweak our weaponskill. But don't give us shield spec. It would COMPLETELY change the class. And I want to play THIS class. Not some paladin wanna-be class. &quot;<br>

What I enjoy are the people who cling to something that will never, ever happen rather than thinking of reasonable solutions to what they THINK is a problem.<br>
<br>
You didn't ask what I or anyone else would like, you merely wailed for shield spec and 2.0 points. I think you would actually care what I would like. But I'll tell you anyway.<br>
<br>
I actually don't think skalds NEED anything beyond a few tweaks, some of which are coming in the next patch. And I know for DAMN sure we don't NEED 2x and shield spec. What would be NICE is something to add more flavour to the class and to help skalds stack better. I think our damage add chant could use a bump up in damage, since resists affect it now. I think having a self-haste buff would be keen. I think having one more group chant (my current pipe-dream is to have a weaker chant version of the end-reduction buff friars and wardens get) would be nice. And I would love to have our stupid RA made into something USEFUL rather than REDUNDANT.<br>
<br>
But like I said, I don't think we NEED anything. Maybe it's because I never solo. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loka@teamskald>Loka</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Participant</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#ff0000>(9/30/03 9:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=710.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stuff</span><hr size=1> Sjofn I couldent agree more. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hooliganfriar>hooliganfriar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Participant</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#ff0000>(9/30/03 9:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=710.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stuff</span><hr size=1> Great.
