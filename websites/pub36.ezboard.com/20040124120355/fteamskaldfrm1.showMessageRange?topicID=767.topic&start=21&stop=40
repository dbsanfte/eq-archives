My only concern is if the make them like padalin's and draw off power.  If it draws off power than you might as well not even bother changing them.  Skalds power usage is a lot more crucial than a padalin's so I hope they realize this when they look into our resist chants.<br>
<br>
I'm a little disappointed in our response to our defense.  I still feel skalds are a little fragile when taking damage and although I don't expect to have tank like defense I do hope they look into giving us a bigger boost than a hits increase.<br>
<br>
Let's hope with mythic's focus on the state of the game that they get rid of long standing bugs like the pulse dropping one.  If they make our resist chants viable and fix the pulse bug than I would pretty satisfied with the skald class despite my views on defense. <p>Jikkle-50-Skald-Troll-R4L6-KAY<br>

Need to have dropped pulses fixed; its ridiculous.  Why can't Mythic increase duration of chants to 8 seconds; so what if we can then twist.  Its not like we are pally and have many good chants to twist.<br>
<br>
Fix pulses and then I would hope to see FoG improved.  Combine resist chant to 2 or 3 chants without draining power (and match them on same line as shammy/healer such as heat/cold/matter).  OR keep resists as singles but allow them to FULLY stack on top of shammy/healer resists.  Drop Master of Block and give us access to Dodger and grant us evade 2 and Id be very, very happy. <p>Albron 50 Norse Skald<br>

We've been promised pie-in-the-sky results from the &quot;styles review&quot; for over a year.  We hear it's going to happen, then we hear it's going to happen, then we hear it's going to happen some more.  Over a year of it (I know this because I stopped playing my skald over a year ago when I first heard we were going to reap the largesse of the mythical Mythic styles review).  Why should we believe that something positive is suddenly going to spring into existence for Skalds that will amazingly balance out all of their problems?  Some may be hanging on Mythic's every word regarding this, but not all of us believe the company is going to/able to make it happen.  After this many months of unfulfilled promise, it's a little hard to believe the tale.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;We can keep an eye on this, but skalds seem to be doing a lot better in RvR then they were before the 1.65 changes.&quot; </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
When I was 6 years old and played football, I was not very good.  When I was 10 years old and played football, I seemed &quot;to be doing a lot better&quot; than I was before I turned 10.  Do you think that means I could compete with high school or college football players?<br>
Skalds' future value in RvR shouldn't be compared solely to their previous value in RvR.  It should be compared to all the other classes.  An improvement from 'poor' to 'ok' shouldn't really be the goal.  In any case, based on responses like this to previous reports it most likely translates to: &quot;We think you're fine despite your protestations--issue closed.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;This is a bug and an annoying one at that. Make sure it's on the bug forum so our QA folks can make sure it's in the bug tracker.&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
You've got to be kidding on this one.  The QA folks should have 2 years worth of data collected on this already.  Everyone that's ever played a skald has complained about this.  How many times does this need to be reported on every forum, and for how many years?  I think I've probably seen this mentioned on every board it could be mentioned on--I've even seen it on the IGN server boards.  This sounds a little like stonewalling.  If it can't be fixed, just tell us and we'll drop the subject.  Acting like you've never heard of the problem paints a much less attractive picture of Mythic.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot; 6 different resist chants is too many. This is on the list for us to address, perhaps by combining them down to 2 or 3 chants with 3 or 2 resist types.&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Skalds asked for this a long time ago.  It was then given to Paladins who <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>didn't</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> ask for it at the time.  I remember this vividly. We're still incredulous.<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;This is the case for many classes that choose to spend &quot;left over&quot; points in parry. Is this is just another way of talking about skald defense?&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
These 17 points of parry are the only &quot;defense&quot; a skald has, making them (defensively) one of the worst Warrior/Rogue classes in the game.  In high level RvR this can't even be considered a defense.  If that's how Mythic intends the class to be then case-closed.  If not, then somebody needs to look at our defensive abilities.  It does lend itself well to the current &quot;cookie cutter&quot; outlook for Skalds.  That may also be as intended by Mythic.<br>

&quot;We've been promised pie-in-the-sky results from the &quot;styles review&quot; for over a year. We hear it's going to happen, then we hear it's going to happen, then we hear it's going to happen some more. Over a year of it (I know this because I stopped playing my skald over a year ago when I first heard we were going to reap the largesse of the mythical Mythic styles review).

After this many months of unfulfilled promise, it's a little hard to believe the tale.&quot;<br>
<br>
The skald changes in 1.65 put skalds in a much better place than they were before. They are more effective and useful imo than Thanes, Champs and Minstrels (if you remove SoS from the equation, which is a realm issue more than a class issue) . Hanging on their every word? They made some pretty substantial changes for the class. The higher level shouts were a big deal. As a 50 BS skald I do a LOT more damage than I was doing previously. I am not expecting more Skald love because I don't think we need it.<br>
<br>
We aren't going to get better defense. That has been stated explicitly. Live with it. We will never have the weaponskill of a pure melee. Live with it. We are a a melee hybrid. With my shouts included I do a ton more damage than a Warrior. I may not survive as long, but I do a lot of damage.<br>
<br>
&quot;When I was 6 years old and played football, I was not very good. When I was 10 years old and played football, I seemed &quot;to be doing a lot better&quot; than I was before I turned 10. Do you think that means I could compete with high school or college football players?&quot;<br>
<br>
Stop whining. My Skald beats virtually every class in the game 1 vs 1. In group RvR, if I play my role correctly I can turn the tide more than any single tank. Your opinion about Skalds is probably reflective of your skill with one. You are trying to find a reason for why you suck at your class and of course it must be the class itself that is broken. Sure, skalds have some weaknesses, but so does every class. If played well, skalds are a very strong class.<br>
<br>
&quot;Skalds' future value in RvR shouldn't be compared solely to their previous value in RvR. It should be compared to all the other classes. An improvement from 'poor' to 'ok' shouldn't really be the goal. In any case, based on responses like this to previous reports it most likely translates to: &quot;We think you're fine despite your protestations--issue closed.&quot;&quot;<br>
<br>
Why shouldn't it? Skalds, previous to 1.65, were a decent class with some flaws that, if changed, would turn them into a good class. They changed spell resists and gave us a reason to keep damage song on. They gave us a few extra hps and I believe the class is where it needs to be. If you give skalds much more, they will be too powerful. I mean, what more do you want? You get speed, instant CC, instant DDs, decent melee damage, resist shouts, damage add, heal song (which is useful in non-combat situations). Now that the shouts are not overly resisted, I find myself doing close to 800 dmg on my first round of combat on soft targets.<br>
<br>
&quot;You've got to be kidding on this one. The QA folks should have 2 years worth of data collected on this already. Everyone that's ever played a skald has complained about this. How many times does this need to be reported on every forum, and for how many years?

<br>
Yeah the pulse dropping is annoying. No arguments here.<br>
<br>
&quot;Skalds asked for this a long time ago. It was then given to Paladins who didn't ask for it at the time. I remember this vividly. We're still incredulous.&quot;<br>
<br>
Give me a break. At the time those were added, Skalds were among the most powerful classes in the game (pre-SC'd armor, pre-realm abilities). People were still calling for nerfs to skalds at the time. SC and RAs hurt skalds a lot.<br>
<br>
&quot;These 17 points of parry are the only &quot;defense&quot; a skald has, making them (defensively) one of the worst Warrior/Rogue classes in the game. In high level RvR this can't even be considered a defense. If that's how Mythic intends the class to be then case-closed. If not, then somebody needs to look at our defensive abilities. It does lend itself well to the current &quot;cookie cutter&quot; outlook for Skalds. That may also be as intended by Mythic.&quot;<br>
<br>
Don't expect anything more. giving us more spec points means you will see Skalds running around with 50 sword, 50 Bsongs and utterly destroying people. Giving us speccable shield is a joke. We don't have the spec points to make it even close to useful without gimping our other, more important, spec lines. We are a melee hybrid. We are designed to be damage dealers with some utility, not defensive tanks. Everything is a trade-off in this game. Skalds don't get a lot of defense, nor tank RAs like determination, but they get a lot of things to help make up for it.<br>
<br>
I am getting tired of hearing the bitching and moaning about Skalds. They are a great class. Any improvements to them might overpower them. Now I do agree that FoG needs to be made into a RA on the level of BoF or SoS, but that is to balance Midgard and not Skalds. I always hear that Skalds wouldn't be chosen to be in groups if they didnt' have speed. Well, they do have speed. That isn't going to change. Skalds are less powerful in melee primarily because they have speed. It is a tradeoff. Honestly, just be happy that skalds are a viable class that are not just a second-rate tank that isn't picked period over pure melees like Thanes. They are a second rate tank that is necessary for a group to function properly. They get the added bonus of doing a lot of damage. <p>Sligg - 51 - Skald *Bedevere*<br>

Parry being our only means of defensive speccing does not return enough value to warrant losing offensive ability. This is probably an issue with most classes that have lower defense and the ability to spec Parry as well. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We can keep an eye on this, but skalds seem to be doing a lot better in RvR then they were before the 1.65 changes. <br>
<br>
======<br>
Thats because most of the hardcore gamers are busting through TOA, not because they fixed skalds.<br>
<br>
The parry issue really needs to be addressed, i parry more then most skalds i know because i have mastery of parry 2 and + 11 built into my suit, something i'd hazard a guess 90% of skalds don't do.<br>
<br>

I agree with almost everything you said even if I would have said it differently.  I DO make a difference in GvG conflicts and thanks to my contribution (and my 7 groupmates of course) we do usually win.  I would also agree that we are a pretty good class atm.<br>
<br>
However,<br>
<br>
1) skalds are NOT as useful as minstrels.  Champs and Thanes?  Definitely we are more usefull then they.  Minstrels are more usefull and IF played to their limit will outperform a skald played to the limit b/c of more tools.  AND SoS (just like your argument for skald speed) IS part of minstrel and does factor into comparison.<br>
2) Outdamaging a Warrior?  Hmmmm....maybe for intial strike or 2 but after that no.<br>
3) ALL classes NEED to keep asking for tweaks no matter how minor, including skalds.  FoG needs tweak.  Dropped pulses need to be fixed EVEN if it allows us to twist (this is not really that useful for skalds given the chants to pick from).  As for me I would like to see resists combined into 2 lines AND not drain pow/time or be single, not drain pow/time, and stack with seers (pbly the ;ast is too much).  I would love to see Master of Block striped from skalds and gives us access to dodger.  Do we NEED these things I would like?  No not urgently but they are minor requests which it is our job to ask for every report.<br>
<br>
Overall I agree with you that skalds are a pretty fair class atm and I am enjoying it.<br>

Some people cannot deal with it. I am sick of the moaning about Skalds. We are a great class. People like that guy piss me off to no end.<br>
<br>
&quot;1) skalds are NOT as useful as minstrels. Champs and Thanes? Definitely we are more usefull then they. Minstrels are more usefull and IF played to their limit will outperform a skald played to the limit b/c of more tools. AND SoS (just like your argument for skald speed) IS part of minstrel and does factor into comparison.&quot;<br>
<br>
I have played a Skald to RR7+ and Minstrel to RR6. I can say that other than SoS, Skalds are superior. They have better survivability, much better melee damage and all their abilities are shouts. The things minstrels have that are superior to Skalds are stealth, ablative chant, insta stun and an AE mez. In a group vs group setting the ablative chant, stealth and AE mez are almost non-factors. The one thing that you could argue that puts them on par is the insta stun. However, I think that is overrated as well. It lasts about 5-6 seconds with capped resists, which is decent, but gives immunity to people who would otherwise get shield slammed, which isn't affected by resists.  SoS puts them above skalds, but other than that 30 min RA, skalds have the upper hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;2) Outdamaging a Warrior? Hmmmm....maybe for intial strike or 2 but after that no.&quot;<br>
<br>
I guarantee that my skald does about the same dps as a good warrior and better dps than an average one if you include my shouts. Unquestioningly. I also have a RR5 Warrior. If I can get behind someone and chain Ragnoraks, then maybe it tips the scale a lot, but I won't be able to do that against a good player very often.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;3) ALL classes NEED to keep asking for tweaks no matter how minor, including skalds. FoG needs tweak.&quot;<br>
<br>
I noted FoG needed to be fixed, btu not for the sake of Skalds, but to give Midgard a battle changing RA. Skalds are the class to give it to.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dropped pulses need to be fixed EVEN if it allows us to twist (this is not really that useful for skalds given the chants to pick from).&quot;<br>
<br>
I agree, but this is a bug and should be treated as one. We can't allow it to sneak into class balance discussions. <br>
<br>
&quot;As for me I would like to see resists combined into 2 lines AND not drain pow/time or be single, not drain pow/time, and stack with seers (pbly the ;ast is too much).&quot;<br>
<br>
The last is too much. I don't know if I agree about the combination of resists, but I wouldn't protest. I think that is a midgard issue. They need to make Aug Healers more attractive to play (celerity shout PLEASE FOR GODS SAKE A CELERITY SHOUT), or give in and give the body/spirit/energy resists to SMs, or Thanes. Hib/Alb both have inherent advantages because they usually have better resists up.<br>
<br>
&quot;I would love to see Master of Block striped from skalds and gives us access to dodger. Do we NEED these things I would like? No not urgently but they are minor requests which it is our job to ask for every report.&quot;<br>
<br>
I wouldn't mind Dodger, but it is so inconsequential. I cannot see myself every buying dodger. For a skald with evade 1 it is pretty much a useless RA in RvR. I think focusing on these things too mcuh like they are going to really help out the class is foolhardy. A Skald with Dodger 2 will still dodge less than a hunter and you should read their boards about their crappy evade rates.<br>
<br>
&quot;Overall I agree with you that skalds are a pretty fair class atm and I am enjoying it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Good. I would say that Skalds are where they need to be and I am weary of us asking for much more and getting it. I would hate to be nerfed again (Ranger, Cleric, Minstrel (SC and RAs were a big nerf for minstrels, Shadowblade).<br>

=====<br>
how does a skald have better survivability?<br>
<br>
Ablative + evade + shield + dex makes for a passable defense against most MTs, you said that your skald outdamages a warrior earlier, well thats really an issue of over time. over time a warrior will last longer then a skald and will cause more end damage with a 1h/shield then a skald will.  Skalds eventually will run out of power and then you are just left with your weapon attacks, which are affected by your lowered weapon skill (you didn't say what the weaponskills were on your toons).  however, that being said.  a Main Tank with a shield equiped vs a minst has to contend with the lower per hit damage which means that their damage per hit is more significantly affected by ablative procs.   Compare that to a skald who will, in a moderately buffed state, take close to full damage over time from a main tank , simply because their defense is so poor they rarely evade/block/parry, and a main tanks is so high that they rarely out right miss.  as a result, the skald is less survivable in that instance then a minst is simply because they have no chant that helps their defense, only a moderately effective offensive chant which is subject to being completely nullified by block, parry, evade.  it doesn't equal out, a minst is more survivable then a skald is.<br>
<br>
compare next to keep sieges, a minst's ablative will allow them to contest most guards, absorbing substantial portions of the incoming damage, their ability to mezz while kiting also allows them greater effective survivability against medium to low guards, with about the same survivability vs lvl 8+ guards and relic guards.<br>
<br>
 a defensive stun and followup mezz ability gives them a far better escape mechanism then say a skald shout mezz + snare, which is only moderately useful at best.<br>
<br>
Now compare group viability between the two<br>
<br>
skald brings resist chants which overwrite shammy/healer resists<br>
skald brings a DA with  limited damage add ( a paltry 7 dps, if you spec that high, which many are chooosing not too)<br>
a skald brings speed, the rest song is more or less useless and you can't twist them.<br>
<br>
now look at minst <br>
<br>
Ingoring pets for the moment<br>
they have a power regen song<br>
ablative chant<br>
secondary CC<br>
speed<br>
<br>
<br>
Now compare the effectiveness of a skald and a minst using crocodile tears ring, which must now be accounted for in terms of balance because of the major advantage it gives albs.<br>
<br>
skald, minst both have same speed.  Draw.<br>
<br>
Skald has DA, wide area effect, only benefits classes who melee.<br>
<br>
minst has ablative, wide area effect, stacks with other effects similiar to how RM BT works, benefits ALL classes, regardless of spec. May or may not continue to benefit guards also, including keep lords.  Why this is major?  well you don't hit a lvl 10 keep lord all that hard, or a relic guard all that hard to start with, having 60-70 of that damage you did then absorbed by a realm effective ablative starts to really compound problems with keep sieges/relic raids.<br>
<br>
Rest song for skalds is bleh, hardly worth using, might be good for resting after an epic mob raid, if that.<br>
<br>
power regen song, effects everyone with a power pool, very nice for pallys, clerics, casters, doesn't do too shabby when linked in with necro power transfer either.  huge bonus for both pve and rvr.<br>
<br>
Skald resist chants, this will actually be HARMFUL to use with that ring.  it would overwrite a ton of other peoples shammy/healer buffs for a single/short duration series of pulses that skip.<br>
<br>
that's just one example of the disparity between artifacts for skalds/minst.<br>
<br>
we can debate other aspects of it all day. but the bottom line is the following<br>
<br>
skalds CAN obtain decent damage with great gear + buffs<br>
skalds are only moderately needed in rvr anymore (crocodile tears ring makes it so you need 1 skald for whole army now, further decreasing the reasons to group skalds)<br>
skalds&lt; minst in terms of survivability, you can argue this all you want, but there are no numbers to support that its any other case then this.  It's simply fact.<br>
Skalds &lt; minst in terms of group benefits<br>
Skald utility &lt; minst in both keep sieges and pve (climb walls, mezz etc etc)<br>
<br>
Skald shout being reduced to 15 second recast certainly was a nice change, but the fact that minst, in the common spec also got a lvl 50 dd at the same time could hardly be considered beneficial to the balance of the two classes. it remains a cold hard fact that the &quot;support based&quot; minst class can kick the crap out of the melee based combat class  (skald) if they are played by anyone with even a reasonable amount of talent.  add in pets to the matter, which IMHO you will see a LOT more of when more crocodile tears rings get out, and suddenly its not even close to balanced anymore. (CT ring will allow one-two minst to run speed for everyone, allowing the rest to get a nice pet)<br>
<br>
there are quite a few minor issues that if fixed would for the most part fix a lot of the problems skalds face, however when that report with those suggested fixes was submitted (1.61) it was essentially ignored. then months later we see the changes in the Warlord ML path, available to other classes, again returning us to teh status we've been in for going on 17 months, which is a class decreasing in usefullness.<br>
<br>
I think your assessment that people are whining about skalds is way off, i think you've gotten a inflated view of their effectiveness, that has thus skewed your analysis. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://bellsouthpwp.net/d/o/donatea/x/sig-auren.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ravensonghausakluif>Ravensong Hausakluif</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Participant</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/17/03 7:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=767.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Great Job!</span><hr size=1> Wow Sligg, thank you for the personal attacks.

<br>
I will boil it down to a short and simple comparison:<br>
<br>
You are operating under a different philosphy that I am. My argument that, aside from SoS, the skald is a better class than the minstrel is based on how I RvR:<br>
<br>
Either solo or in a well balanced group. That is pretty much 99% of what I do. <br>
<br>
I have played both classes to high realm ranks and have a pretty good idea of their strengths and weaknesses. I wish I didn't have to spend too much time on this because it isn't really part of my original argument other than a simple  side comment, but I guess I will go into it a bit.<br>
<br>
When I say survivability, I am not specifically speaking about pure defense. Minstrels might have an edge there, but not much of one if at all. Rather I am speaking about their status as a priority target because of SoS. Minstrels generally die quickly against good groups.<br>
<br>
Minstrel crowd control seems to be superior on the surface, but when you consider that in a good group a minstrel will only be mezzing in emergencies and generally late in the battle as most people will be mez immune, things begin to unravel. The instant stun sounds great, but as a minstrel I really didn't use it much except on tanks as a peeling tool because I wanted to wait for healers and casters to get melee slammed because it lasted a lot longer. I think the insta stun is really a way to stop runners and peel. Thats it. Otherwise it is a nuisance at best. The AE mez is inconsequential. I love it when a minstrel AE mezzes me. Doesn't last very long and makes me immune for most of the rest of the battle. A good minstrel in a good group won't bother. The single target mez is decent because you can move while casting it, but you brought up the &quot;stun, then mez&quot; method of CCing, but the problem is that with capped resists the minstrel cannot get off his mez on anyone with an instant spell of any kind. In all the time I played a skald I have never once had a minstrel stun then get off his mez without me interrupting it. As a minstrel that only worked against slow players. I like the skald toolset better because you get 3 different choices. The mez is helpful in some situations ONLY because it is a shout. If a minstrel doesn't get mezzed early on in a fight I mez him so they can't SoS. The instant snare is by far the most useful of the CC options because it has range, interrupts and lasts a long time. Another understated benefit of the skald is his ability to use snare styles. The minstrel has one snare style and it is in a chain off of their no &quot;to hit&quot; detaunt in the thrust line. Most minstrels use blades in the first place. Skalds have access to reasonably accessible snare styles in every weapon line, especially Hammer. I use sword, but I still have access to a side style snare which I get off more than you might guess and the one off the assault chain, which I use a lot. I personally have found that the skald skillset in this case is more applicable to fighting in groups and being good at it.<br>
<br>
Now, even if minstrels have an edge in the survivability line and you can argue that they are roughly equal in terms of CC, skalds make up for it with far superior damage. Minstrel damage even with higher weaponspec is mediocre at best. Skald melee damage is mediocre at worst and extremely good at best. You cannot find a minstrel that can take down a caster in one round of combat. You just can't do it. I do it routinely on my skald. Minstrels are terrible at taking down a solo target in the midst of a battle if they need to. Skalds are very capable of this and in playing a Skald this ability has dramatically changed the way I played the game from someone blindly assisting to someone that can keep 2-3 targets occupied while taking down a healer or caster that is causing trouble. <br>
<br>
I dunno. I just find it funny when skalds complain about minstrels being so much better when I have dueled dozens and never had one take me below 50% life in a 1 vs 1 fight. And beyond that they really don't bring much more to a group than a Skald. I think damage add is more important than ablative chant when you factor BoF into the equation. Otherwise they are both things that really won't change the outcome of battles. Power song is in the same boat as Heal song. Neither are useful in combat. So really what it boils down to is this in terms of group benefits that actually affect the outcome of a battle:<br>
<br>
Skalds: Damage add, resists, instant medium duration CC<br>
<br>
Minstrels: Ablative chant, castable medium duration CC<br>
<br>
I dunno. I think Skalds are pretty close to minstrels on that. The fact if the matter is that Minstrels are SUPPOSED to be a more group oriented class, but they don't have skalds beat by much. The resist chants are great if you have 2 skalds in a group. Aug Healers are extremely rare and it is nice to have a body or energy chant going.<br>
<br>
&quot;skalds CAN obtain decent damage with great gear + buffs<br>
skalds are only moderately needed in rvr anymore (crocodile tears ring makes it so you need 1 skald for whole army now, further decreasing the reasons to group skalds)&quot;<br>
<br>
What kind of garbage group would go anywhere without their own skald? Croc ring is nice, but I can't see any decent group leaving the portal keep depending on someone else for their speed. This might be nice for someone who likes to zerg their way around the frontier, but that isn't me, nor most decent players I know.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Skald shout being reduced to 15 second recast certainly was a nice change, but the fact that minst, in the common spec also got a lvl 50 dd at the same time could hardly be considered beneficial to the balance of the two classes. it remains a cold hard fact that the &quot;support based&quot; minst class can kick the crap out of the melee based combat class (skald) if they are played by anyone with even a reasonable amount of talent.&quot;<br>

You are out of your mind. Solo minstrels are easy RPs. If you as a skald have lost to a minstrel I have to question if you know what you are doing. They are not a challenge at all. The only skalds I beat solo on my minstrels were stupid ones with poor reflexes, which luckily for me, happened to be 95% of them. I am seriously laughing out loud hearing you say that a minstrel can kick the crap out of a skald.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think your assessment that people are whining about skalds is way off, i think you've gotten a inflated view of their effectiveness, that has thus skewed your analysis.&quot;<br>
<br>
The only thing that has inflated my view of skalds is my ability to play one well. I honestly look at those of you complaining and moaning about Skalds as people who probably don't play the class very well. There are some people who say &quot;The class is good, but there are a couple things that could be looked at.&quot; Fine, I can see that and agree to a point, but based on my experience with the class and about 7 million realm points worth of  other classes, I just don't see skalds as a class deserving of the negativity I see coming from its players. It is a good class. If the best you can do is take one sentence from a post I made and turn this thread into a &quot;WHAAAAAA MINSTRELS HAVE THIS AND WE DON'T&quot;, then I have to say your attitude about this is all wrong. Minstrels are flashier than Skalds, but most of it is fluff in real RvR. The fact that my skald does close to twice the amount of damage my minstrel did (both equipped with the best items in the game), is enough for me to say that all the fluff that minstrels doesn't make skalds a woefully inferior class.<br>
<br>
On a side note, the only thing the Croc Ring will be good for is zerging and if a zerg has speed the only thing it will do is speed them more quickly to places where we can farm them. <p>Sligg - 51 - Skald *Bedevere*<br>

My argument that, aside from SoS, the skald is a better class than the minstrel is based on how I RvR:<br>
<br>
Either solo or in a well balanced group. That is pretty much 99% of what I do. <br>
<br>
I have played both classes to high realm ranks and have a pretty good idea of their strengths and weaknesses. I wish I didn't have to spend too much time on this because it isn't really part of my original argument other than a simple side comment, but I guess I will go into it a bit.<br>
<br>
When I say survivability, I am not specifically speaking about pure defense. Minstrels might have an edge there, but not much of one if at all. Rather I am speaking about their status as a priority target because of SoS. Minstrels generally die quickly against good groups.<br>
================<br>
This contradicts your earlier comments that a skald was comparable damage to a warrior.<br>
<br>
Your contention seems to be that a skald has greater survivability because minst are a greater threat and therefore skalds survive longer because they aren't targeted to be killed.  Well, that's not how rvr works really.  it usually goes &quot;easy kill, important kill, tough  kill&quot; in that order.  Skald falls under easy kill.  Minst falls under important/tough, primarily because most classes can't get a grip on them once they have used their RAs or if they are under the influence of Mezz reduction/immunity timers.<br>
<br>
for the record i have a RR6l4 Skald and partial ownership of a rr8l2 minst.  So i've seen it from both sides and i can guarentee you my minst lives far longer then my skald 99% of the time, primarily because i can do my job without being right in the front line area, which is not feasible for a skald to be effective, they must wade in.  A minst can maintain a 1000 unit buffer to most of the dangerous combat while at the same time reducing the ranged threat to them while on the move (mezz and kite). Mezz may not stick after the inital cast, but it DOES interrupt, and thats all you need to survive a ranged caster and interrupt healers at a distance, just run around and spam cast it on them, you've done your entire team an invaluable service while maintaining a posture that allows you to live through most if not all fights.  To say the AE mezz is inconsequential is horribly inaccurate, a well played minst can lock down entire armies of ranged attackers with it and cause healers a constant headache.<br>
<br>
Skald has 1 timered range interrupt at 1500 units, other then that they have to close to a min. 700 to continue to interrupt casters, then its a timer.<br>
<br>
Minst are designed to be survivable support classes, tho it may be true that skalds and minst both die a lot in close combat with heavy tanks, a minst has the optiont to do his job without being in that situation where a skald doesn't.<br>
<br>
Your selective use of stun is your choice, however that doesn't mean that other uses for it don't make it a very powerful tool, for instance using Stun on Pbaer who is about to nail your CCed realmmates can save them a substantial amount of damage.  there are quite a fewer other uses for stun, to be honest, your better off using mezz on the move to stop most runners (except those with immunity) because then when you close to combat and engage, you can stun mid combat with no timer concern if the fight becomes too tough.<br>
================<br>
Regarding this comment <br>
&quot;he instant snare is by far the most useful of the CC options because it has range, interrupts and lasts a long time. Another understated benefit of the skald is his ability to use snare styles. The minstrel has one snare style and it is in a chain off of their no &quot;to hit&quot; detaunt in the thrust line. Most minstrels use blades in the first place. Skalds have access to reasonably accessible snare styles in every weapon line, especially Hammer. I use sword, but I still have access to a side style snare which I get off more than you might guess and the one off the assault chain, which I use a lot.&quot;<br>
<br>
====<br>
This would be true if the snare didn't break upon next damage to the target. very very rarely when you are chasing somebody through an active battle field will you land a snare that really sticks for more then a couple of seconds with the tons of AE being thrown around and people trying to take a shot at the target as its running past.  Additionally, bleed styles, dots and some pulsing effects can break snare.  Once you've snared and had it broken, you've given the target in question root immunity, which means should they get away from you (like say you get cced or otherwise stopped) the next caster they go after has no CC option to stop them unless they try to mezz (sm)<br>
<br>
From a skill set perspective, skald snare is incredibly inferior to prevent flight, both in its casted form and its styled form.<br>
<br>
This statement is also incorrect<br>
====<br>
Now, even if minstrels have an edge in the survivability line and you can argue that they are roughly equal in terms of CC, skalds make up for it with far superior damage. Minstrel damage even with higher weaponspec is mediocre at best. Skald melee damage is mediocre at worst and extremely good at best. You cannot find a minstrel that can take down a caster in one round of combat. You just can't do it.<br>
====<br>
<br>
A low stealth high weapon/instrument minst is very very capable of taking down people in 1 round of combat (casters)<br>
<br>
Minst and skald are on identical weaponskill tables, the myth that skalds have higher weaponskill was perpetuated by people comparing low str minst chars to Trolls skalds.  it's simply not true.<br>
<br>
A minst with an Anchor (slow 1 hand weapon) will do very good damage per strike vs cloth casters, add in their DDs and mastery of pain II (aug str one helps also) and they can approach close to 430 with an opening blow + 300 from DDs, that's enough to take out an unbuffed caster. Should they perfect crit on the attack or get a positional off, that damage goes up quite a bit.  Plus they can stun said caster and beat on them a couple more times with the positional of their choice without worrying about the first shot breaking their mezz and the caster qc ccing them or lifetapping them.<br>
<br>
Wish i had my other computer up, i'd throw up the screenie of minst hitting  mana eld for 419, 189 139 (dds) then hitting for 560.  The mana eld lived because he got an insta from his druid.  Clearly there is a crit in there (mana eld took shot), but the point is, minst can do = damage to skald if they low spec stealth, which they don't NEED in rvr.  Skald can only spec for max damage if they gimp their BS song a bit.<br>
<br>
<br>
======<br>
&quot;Skalds are very capable of this and in playing a Skald this ability has dramatically changed the way I played the game from someone blindly assisting to someone that can keep 2-3 targets occupied while taking down a healer or caster that is causing trouble''<br>
<br>
Refer to my comment about tying up everyone in the back areas with chain mezzes.  compare how many people a skald can tie up compared to a minst then.<br>
<br>
=====<br>
I dunno. I just find it funny when skalds complain about minstrels being so much better when I have dueled dozens and never had one take me below 50% life in a 1 vs 1 fight. And beyond that they really don't bring much more to a group than a Skald. I think damage add is more important than ablative chant when you factor BoF into the equation. Otherwise they are both things that really won't change the outcome of battles. Power song is in the same boat as Heal song. Neither are useful in combat. So really what it boils down to is this in terms of group benefits that actually affect the outcome of a battle:<br>
<br>
Skalds: Damage add, resists, instant medium duration CC<br>
<br>
Minstrels: Ablative chant, castable medium duration CC<br>
<br>
=====<br>
<br>
a minst + Pally interaction is greater then any duo in mid.<br>
<br>
IE a minst + pally = Damage add, AF buff, Ablative, heal + extras <br>
<br>
+ minst get insta Stun, castable AE mezz which interrupts.<br>
<br>
That's ignoring the SOS, BOF aspect entirely.  Granted Pally can't get ring of tears, but its a minor issue<br>
<br>
skald has no favorable duo in mid...cept maybe the RM but thats questionable.<br>
<br>
You must balance classes around how they interact with other classes in their own realm otherwise you can't balance ever.  To see the extremes of why ignoring class duo/group combinations, look at the dreds and see what happens when you put a necro + animist in a keep situation.  Sure, solo they may not make a vastly overpowered combination, but combined, they can defeat Dozens.<br>
<br>
How does that apply to your comment you ask?  you are taking it as a 1 v 1 and you beat minst.  well for starters, you never know what the other guys spec is, he could be 50 inst/50 stealth for all you know, its not a controlled thing.  but you expand it to a group setting and suddenly the minst increases in power exponetially while a skald has exactly the same benefits solo, in a group or in an army.  Additionally, you are comparing a class to class where you put a minst specifically in their worst element, that is close combat 1 v 1 vs a skalds strongest case, 1 v 1.  you allow that minst to kite and start the combat from range, suddenly things change. it becomes an entirely different battle.<br>
<br>
=======<br>
&quot;skalds CAN obtain decent damage with great gear + buffs<br>
skalds are only moderately needed in rvr anymore (crocodile tears ring makes it so you need 1 skald for whole army now, further decreasing the reasons to group skalds)&quot;<br>
<br>
What kind of garbage group would go anywhere without their own skald? Croc ring is nice, but I can't see any decent group leaving the portal keep depending on someone else for their speed. This might be nice for someone who likes to zerg their way around the frontier, but that isn't me, nor most decent players I know. <br>
<br>
==========<br>
Not sure where you've been the last couple of months. But a significant number of servers have a severe skalds shortage.  Your defination of &quot;decent group&quot; = exceptional group ona  great many servers. your little half-assed insult about my skill level was  abit uncalled for, but its clear you feel that fighting 8 v8 and winning is somehow realm combat, so i assume you don't really get the big picture very well.<br>
<br>
I have a feeling frontiers is gonna make you miserable<br>
<br>
&quot;&quot;Skald shout being reduced to 15 second recast certainly was a nice change, but the fact that minst, in the common spec also got a lvl 50 dd at the same time could hardly be considered beneficial to the balance of the two classes. it remains a cold hard fact that the &quot;support based&quot; minst class can kick the crap out of the melee based combat class (skald) if they are played by anyone with even a reasonable amount of talent.&quot;<br>
<br>
You are out of your mind. Solo minstrels are easy RPs. If you as a skald have lost to a minstrel I have to question if you know what you are doing. They are not a challenge at all. The only skalds I beat solo on my minstrels were stupid ones with poor reflexes, which luckily for me, happened to be 95% of them. I am seriously laughing out loud hearing you say that a minstrel can kick the crap out of a skald.&quot;<br>
<br>
What server is your skald on again? out of 210 logged fights between the minst i use and an equal rank skald, i won 188 of them.  of those that i lost, he used IP or AoF and AP.<br>
<br>
I'm far from out of my mind, i'm just not a crap minst. Which is apparently all you've experienced either as a player or as an attacker.<br>
<br>
====<br>
&quot;The only thing that has inflated my view of skalds is my ability to play one well. I honestly look at those of you complaining and moaning about Skalds as people who probably don't play the class very well.&quot;<br>
<br>
====<br>
yes, i hit 5l4 prior to dinging 50, predominately solo.  And i suck.  completely and utterly suck, beyond belief!  Matter of fact, i have a lifetime IRS of 1500+ including suiciding on keeps and playing on one of the most underpopulated mid realms across all servers!!<br>
<br>
maybe, just maybe, its possible that you aren't seeing the overall grand scheme of things very clearly. maybe its possible you are wrong(what are the odds?!).  Maybe its possible that all those RR6+ skalds running around saying &quot;hey, this is unbalanced and needs work&quot; are not all clueless newbie whiners.<br>
<br>
====<br>
It is a good class. If the best you can do is take one sentence from a post I made and turn this thread into a &quot;WHAAAAAA MINSTRELS HAVE THIS AND WE DON'T&quot;, then I have to say your attitude about this is all wrong. <br>
====<br>
<br>
one sentence? Maybe i've found the problem here, you can't count.  I quoted 9 sentences, including a runon that coulda been 2 sentences in my reply.  Speaking of attitudes, saying that everyone that has a problem with class performance is a whiner is close to the dumbest tact i've ever seen taken from a class discussion standpoint.  Do you honestly expect anyone to look at your arguements after that in an unbiased manner?<br>
<br>
let me ask, sorta get it out of the way<br>
<br>
do you ONLY run in guild groups?<br>
<br>
Do you refuse certain classes from your group because they aren't optimal?<br>
<br>
if you answered both those questions as yes, you probably don't belong in a discussion on class balance, since you aren't with the program when it comes to game balance.<br>
<br>
<br>
and finally, for everyone's reading pleasure, i'll just recopy this gem<br>
<br>
&quot;On a side note, the only thing the Croc Ring will be good for is zerging and if a zerg has speed the only thing it will do is speed them more quickly to places where we can farm them. &quot;<br>
<br>
perhaps, the best indicator you're an idiot out of the last 3 posts you've made.  <br>
<br>
let me just clarify for you, i'll space out the words<br>
<br>
- 1 minst with ring in a 3fg force means every other minst can grab a red con pet.  magnifying their projected force potential my significant amounts, especially if they can get ranged nuking pets or pets with a CC/debuff ability<br>
<br>
- 2 minst with ring can provide runie like stacking ablative to an entire force.  timed correctly, this means every single strike in a 1 v 1 encounter will lose at least 60 damage from ablative.<br>
<br>
- 2 bards means entire force has end regen + speed, regardless if the bards are in two seperate groups or not.<br>
<br>
I realize you categorize yourself as being &quot;good&quot; because you run in a group of 8 and therefore it somehow requires more skill (cough).  Sadly, what that normally means is that you ran around an held off fighting the majority of the fights you COULD engage (because the otherside was a bunch of clueless zerging noobs right?) until you found fights you could win, usually fights you either outnumber or you come up on people from the side, thus gaining initial contact advantage which immediately decreases the &quot;skill required&quot; to win simply because your enemy is disadvantaged from the get go.<br>
<br>
The sad fact of the matter is that tho the skald performes moderately well in single group combat in combat situations where they are advantaged from the start, when you go head to head with groups where the fight is even or they start with the advantage you provide no significant bonus to your group.  When you go against multiple enemy groups, the rest of your REALM'S force, gains an insignifcant advantage from you being there.<br>
<br>
<br>
Essentially, once the need for speed ends, IE combat is entered, the skald is a sub-par performer.  I could explain why in greater detail, tho after writing this little novel it occured to me that i could explain the complete works of shakesphere and you'd nod your head slowly and then go something like &quot;I'm L33t!&quot;  and flex. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://bellsouthpwp.net/d/o/donatea/x/sig-auren.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=roseannelottsa>Roseanne Lottsa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Skald TL</span><br>  Posts: 443<br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/21/03 5:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=767.topic&index=39>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Great Job!</span><hr size=1> C'mon guys, play nice.<br>

I disagree that dodger would be insignificant (especially if we could get evade 2).  Either way at high rr we could finally have some sort of viable defense with dodger without giving up our decent damage via 2H.<br>
<br>
I would also disagree with the minstrel side bar comments.  You can not under-estimate the power that a good minstrel twisting charm on a red con pet and ablative on you in a 1v1 fight.<br>
<br>
IMO a minstrel has a higher ceiling for effectiveness/power than a skald.  This does not make the skald bad, however.  Most people who play this game dont realize the power of multiple skalds.  IF you are on the /assist train and you get 2 or 3 skalds all on same target, its crazy.  That target (should ALWAYS be healing class/robed caster/musician) is dead before it can be healed with 4-6 DDs and three 2H weapon hits.  Thats at least (with 3 skalds) 900 DD damage and 500 weapon damage in 1-2 seconds.  Most robed casters are insta dead; healing classes/musicians soon will be as well.<br>
