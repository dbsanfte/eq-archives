Here's a new approach:<br><br>Should we take this patch's... style of content to signal that Mythic believes the game needs mere tiny tweaks?  Is the game, pre-expansion, just about &quot;perfected&quot; according to Mythic?<br>Mythic announced it reached 200,000 subscribers, so perhaps the company is listening to its sales reports as a description of its health.  I would warn Mythic to also diagnose the style of the typical player, as seen by levels achieved over time and the profile of the typical &quot;bill-changer&quot; (quitter or account seller).  By analyzing the typical categories of trends of gameplay durations, Mythic could get a much clearer measure of it future revenue stability.<br>In other words, Mythic has the data to prove what we, the heavy users, have been trying to say:  the game's revenue base is fragile, and forthcoming competitors are about to whack at that base with substantial hammers.<br>Is all lost for Mythic?  Of course not!  There should be a surviving niche for a &quot;limited PvP&quot; MMORPG.  But many substantial changes need to be made, and time is limited.

Mistakes and changes are invariably discovered during the second half of that process.  *Avoidable* mistakes, as simply choosing one trial &quot;live&quot; server would excuse the rest from the pain of double-changes.<br><br>Ah well, maybe for programming reasons it's much easier to make the sweeping changes to all live servers, and then the unexpected changes to those changes on all the live servers, than it is to test those patches on a live server in the beginning.

Then there won't be one test server.  Unless I'm missing something radically obvious, the optimal model is to have each live server take turns being the test server.
