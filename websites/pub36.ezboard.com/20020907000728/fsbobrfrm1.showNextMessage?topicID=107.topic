From alleyway to alleyway it sped without sound. Its cloak fluttered behind it as it ran across the lit cobblestone streets. Briefly in the light it could be seen that it was a man dressed in the color of night. Running, he held the hilt of his blade so that it would not hinder his movements nor make sound. Swiftly he disappeared into the shadows.<br><br>On the same cobblestone street there came others dressed in the same likeness. They stopped and danced around searching the area as if looking for the path taken by the first. Catching site of his direction via a splashed puddle, the others unsheathed their blades and hurried after him. <br><br>As the fleeing Rogue ran he took hold of his cloak and threw it to the ground. As he did a wind grabbed hold of it and gently it danced to the ground as the runner faded away into the darkness ahead. Again he entered a torch-lit street and stopped dead in his steps. Peering back into the darkness as he caught his breath.<br><br>Footsteps could be heard from beyond the shadows of the alley as his chasers neared. With a flash he dashed again into the alley and raced ahead. Entering the next street he took two small jumps and then with the third he flipped himself high into the air. His arms were extended out as were his legs in a pike form. The wind whistled as his body twisted slowly in the air. <br><br>He landed soundlessly on the shingles of a roof. There he ran and bounced from roof-top to roof-top until again he was unseen. Swallowed by the night leaving no trace to be found. <br><br>The others came at last to this spot and found the track to be lost. With much haste they combed the area and with the sound of approaching guards they too fled into the night. <br><br>As the moon gazed upon its self in the window of an old tavern on a forgotten side of town the lone rogue came running. Stopping to see if he had been fallowed he hastily checked his surroundings.<br><br>Seeing no one about he scaled the water drain on the side of the abandoned building and made his way to the window. Pushing it in, he climbed on to its ledge and peered into the darkness.

She had been injured, there were marks about her face an arms that could only have been left by someone with a hell of alot of weight behind their hit.  Finding what he was seeking, Shin-Kai proceeded to make a noise that sounded to any untrained ear the wind slipping through the shadowy streets at night, but Cajeline knew it as one of the stealth signals used by the Order of the Black Rose.  She slowly turned her head an made eye contact with the Rose in the window.  Her eyes widened immediatly and her head began to shake back and forth wildly.  It was obvious to Shin Kai that she was warning him of some danger that elluded his vision but not hers, but the realization was too late.<br><br>&quot;I've been finding many Roses in my garden as of late.&quot;  Agile though he was, Shin could not avoid the large hand of Sir Galimont crashing through the window glass and pulling the stunned rescuer through the window and throwing him to the floor inside.  Shin reached for his daggers as he stood up, but a swift kick to the midsection and the half-unsheathed Nai-Toge was sent flying to one side of the room and Shin to the other.  Sir Galimont touched the scar on his chest lightly with his fingers.  &quot;I'll destroy your whole lot for this injustice...&quot;<br><br>Springing to his feet with the quickness of a jungle cat, Shin-Kai dodged several more attacks from Galimont and slipped past his monstrous body.  In a move that resembled a cartwheel, Shin recovered Nai-Toge from its resting place on the floor and returned to his ready position, this time much more able to take the offensive.  But before he could...<br><br>&quot;I'm no fool, I'll not risk my throat again against an assassin's blade.  Galimont snapped his fingers and from the door next to him, in walked three men, not as big as Galimont but big nonetheless and weilding swords.  One had a rather large two handed sword while the other two had shorter swords and a small buckler.  Shin-Kai prepared his mind for the worst, but before anyone had made a move, one of the shield wearing combatants lurched over dead!<br><br>Dropping in from the shadows of the rafters above, Veish'Kav Vittarlius landed without noise.  &quot;Hey Cajeline, long time no see.&quot;  He said without reverting his gaze from the remaining three warriors.  &quot;Got yer letter by the way...&quot;<br><br>The air stood still and the silece of the night was deafening.  Soon the only noise that was heard was the scurrying of rats in the walls and after many tense seconds...a voice.  &quot;Did I miss the party?&quot; a figure said stepping in from the corner of the room, from where there was no entrance or exit save a small rat's hole...<br><br>Veish grinned as he recognized the voice all too well.  &quot;Takarae Taekmoor, was hoping you'd show up.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And here I am.&quot;  Started to cut the ropes from Cajeline, who had been all but forgotten still tied to a chair, but before he could, Galimont and his men charged, the fight was on!<br><br>(you continue)<br><br>EDIT: Fixed a typo <p><center>~<b>Takarae Taekmoor</b>~<BR><a href="http://www.eqrogue.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.eqrogue.com/main/pics/roseborder.jpg" border="0"></center></a> </p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/utakaraetaekmoor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Takarae Taekmoor</A> at: 4/30/01 7:19:54 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/uarctyc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arctyc</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 57<br> <font color=#9C0000>(4/27/01 8:07:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fsbobrfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=93.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Chapter 2</span><hr size=1> It was a quiet night in the tavern, Arctyc figured he had been out long enough searching, and decided to have an ale before getting a room.  <br><br>The bartender was a gruff man, and he had no success in convincing him to let a tale or two pay his stay.  Regretfully, he started to pull out his lining-pouch to pay when the entire room seemed to shudder.<br><br>&quot;What the hell was that?!&quot;, Arctyc exclaimed.<br><br>The bartender had an unusually tense expression now, and stammered, &quot;Oh, n-nothing!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, you won't mind then if I find out for myself, then, would you?&quot;, Arctyc intoned, flipping two gold coins across the counter to the man, at the same time rushing toward the stairs and making certain his rapier was loose in its sheath.<br><br>Arriving at the top of the stairs, Arctyc stopped as he rammed into a man who's frame nearly filled the entire hallway.  &quot;Bloody Half-Giant!&quot;, he murmured.<br><br>&quot;Ey', whot you think you'r doin'?&quot;, the large figure asked, but before waiting for an answer, he unhooked the mace from his belt and swung.

She asked them not to. Knowing it was a trap and hearing the call of Shin. She wondered if he did not hear her words.

But these were not the same men who took her down. Cajeline was taught to fight by the best hands. She could not only be a temptress but an assassin if she chose. With all her might she looked and in away no one had seen her look till now. Takarae’s eyes caught hers and one tear fell down her face.

It was a stand off. Neither side moved and it was dead silent. They stood waiting for someone to make a move.<br><br>He thought for a moment while he glared at his opponents. He understood why those rogues he had been following earlier that night were so careless. Why they had dropped that message stating payment was to be picked up in this room for some job or another. He thought how foolish of himself. It was too easy, way too easy. A trap and the he fell for it. <br><br>His eyes went from person to person in the room. Lord Galimont was very large and out matched Shin Kai easily in strength. The first thug was large enough and had his attention fixed on Veish. The second stood next to Lord Galimont and stared at Shin Kai with a threatening grin. <br><br>Then Shin Kai looked upon the Temptress bound in the chair. This was Shin Kai's first look at the Rogue Temptress. He was young amongst the members of the Rose and had not yet made her acquaintance. <br><br>She was simply beautiful. Though beaten badly and bruised her attractiveness was evident. A single tear fell from her eye as she looked upon Takarae with hopelessness. She was all the more inviting. Beautiful, young and helpless. Shin Kai couldn't help but aid her as he could. After all she was a Rose and most beautiful at that. <br><br>Her lips were quivering and she shook from head to toe. Takarae gave her a smile to comfort her as he worked at the ropes that held her. As he did she screamed, his smile seemingly bringing her back to reality. &quot;NOOOOOOOOOO!&quot; <br><br>Her scream broke the dead air and like a trigger set off the fight (insert Matrix Sound Track)! Lord Galimont and his men jumped across the room as did Shin Kai and Veish'Kav! <br><br>(You Continue)<br><br> <p><HTML><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="F8F8FF"><I>~ Shin-Kai Shinogi ~</I></FONT></B><BR><A HREF><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="+1"><A HREF="http://www.eqrogue.com">ORDER of the BLACK ROSE</A></FONT></B></CENTER></A><a href><MARQUEE direction="left" loop="infinite" width="100%><font size="+1"><nobr><I>"Never sleep.

An overhand swing nearly cut the still cloaked assassin in half, but it seemed just as the blade was about to strike, Veish stepped aside with ease. Hopping over the return swing and drawing his dagger at the same time, Veish dashed forward upon landing and drove the blade into the gullet of the stunned man with the sword.  Much to his credit, he staggered but a few steps before reassuming a fighting posture and rushing Veish again.<br><br>Accross the room, Shin-Kai Shinogi did not wait for Galimont to hit him first, Shin struck first.  He lept into the air, grabbing onto one of the rafter, spinning once around it to gain momentum before he drove a double footed kick to Galimont's head.  Galimont hit the ground with a thump and a grunt.  Landing noiselessly in a kneeling position, Shin-Kai too drew his dagger.  Nai-Toge seemed to shoot forth dragging Shin's arm behind it.  It found its mark and broke deep between the should-blades of the big man.  <br><br>Shin's careful eyes looked around.  Too his left he saw Takarae catch the buckler of the other fighter in the head, too distracted by untiing the ropes of the Rogue Temptress, Cajeline to avoid the blow.  Reeling only briefly Takarae spun, drawing his dagger and slit the throat of his attacker.

They all go down the stairs and out the alley back to safe house.<br><br>There they fix Cajeline up and let her rest. When she woke she told her tell of the night.<br><br>“I lured Galimont with a tale of my father being killed by rogues such as our selves, I was hurt from the guy in the bar. He hit me hard when he thought I was his average whore.  So when Galimont saw me, he thought I was a peasant girl from another land. He took me into his home let me bath. Gave me wine, which I did not drink. I was taken to his room for his pleasure which I didn’t abide I filled his glass full of the truth poison which in turn he spilled his guts to me.<br><br>Davon and his men were up to what we thought they were. They are to come into our city and take all the women and children and kill the men. They know the Order is here and wants them destroy them. He shall come in five moons from now. Galimont was his eyes and ears; He had many of us marked already. Those new to us were the ones we would have to use in order to get inside. I took his information, then I took my dagger, I cut the rose upon his chest, and with black ash I smeared it in. My mark was placed, I tore off the clothes he gave me, and underneath was that of rogue. I leaped from the window as always do but to my amazement I was not alone.<br><br>I got about 3 shadow steps from the house when a man entered my sight; he hit me hard and threw me back. I stood and I killed him with out thought. Trying to get out, I wasn’t sure which way to go. As I leaped over the gate there was more, they beat me to an inch of my life. Took me back to the house. Galimont woke in the morning.<br>They had me bound in a chair. He game down the stairs looked me in the face, rubbed his chest and smacked me harder then I have ever been hit in my life.”<br><br>There wasn’t a tear in Cajeline’s eyes and she wasn’t sure what her brother’s had thought of her, she wasn’t scared to go on, but she decide she was weak and wanted to go back to sleep.

She crept into the main house and looked around. Everyone just looked at her and said nothing.<br><br>Giving her new bandages, she sat in pain. Her story began again<br><br>“ He hit me like a rock you know, just thrusting my body to the floor. I looked at him in the face with no fear, no smirk crossed my face and I refused to let a tear drop, though the pain I felt like my body was broke. He asked me over and over why I had marked him. He said he knew of me, that I hit his man earlier that night. He thought it was brave of me to enter his home after his man was marked. He respected me for that, so he would not kill me as of yet.<br><br>He asked his men to take me to the alley house till he could set up a plan to get the rest of the order one by one. I was weak he had taken my clothes to make sure I wouldn’t run. There was a scroll near by and I wrote to warn you all. There was a boy I could hear playing outside and I begged him to go. The bard who sang his songs would make a payment he couldn’t refuse. The boy returned later that day and said he had given the letter, tossed his coins smiles and laughed. I didn’t know who he gave it to.<br><br>Galimont could be heard laughing out side of my door. He came in and given some clothes and tied me to the chair and gagged me and hit me again. He said Davon would be coming and he would take me and make me his, he would mark me and very one would know who I was and that I would never again be free and the Order would be no more.<br><br>The next thing I know I heard Shin and the window, I have never seen him but I knew the call, I couldn’t shout to him and with Galimont’s laughter Shin came flying through the window.<br><br>As much as I want this to be over I know Davon is surely to come. He must know I am still alive by now as some of his men where to meet Galimont in the morning.<br><br>I know I shouldn’t have marked him alone, but I was sure I was up for the job”<br><br>With all that said Cajeline was given some food, where she slowly ate, and the Order said nothing to her, just sat in silence<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#460000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/ushinkaiobr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shin Kai OBR</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 132<br> <font color=#9C0000>(5/3/01 3:08:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fsbobrfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=93.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.eqrogue.com/images/shin-kai1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Question for Tak</span><hr size=1> Did I kill Galimont?
