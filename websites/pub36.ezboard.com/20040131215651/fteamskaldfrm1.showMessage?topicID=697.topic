<br>
---<br>
<br>
oh how i wish there were no skald changes listed in those patch notes.  now i know that my favorite character will remain hopelessly gimped and worthless for at least the next 12, more likely 18 months.  so let us review the changes realistically shall we?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>- Increased the range of the Chant of the Brawl line to 1500.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
this chant does not do enough damage to be useful in rvr.  period.  it is more productive for your skald to keep run song on so that people who drop from combat mode during the course of the battle have speed to get back into combat.  worse this change has no impact on pve, as your group 99% of the time is already within 700 of you.  this change is totally meaningless for the vast majority of skalds.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>- Decreased the reuse timer on the Warcry and Battle Shout lines to 15 seconds.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
now we can DD for meaningless or zero damage more often.  however this does certainly improve our ability to solo for exp (if anyone can stomach that idea) and it also improves our dueling ability, especially vs minstrels.  this will help in making a duel with a minstrel who has any amount of ability to play his character not an auto-lose.  it has a VERY small possibility of helping in rvr, in that it is theoretically possible that you can interrupt casters during a battle more frequently.  the truth is however that a single interrupt on a single caster, when your opponents (such as reavers with pbae chant) can interrupt multiple casters, is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>not likely</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to have a significant impact on the outcome of the battle.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>- Added a new shout in the Warcry and Battle Shout lines. War Howl is a new level 43 shout and Battle Roar is a new level 50 shout.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
here we have one useful change.  now we have a 43 instead of a 34 DD.  that means fewer totally resisted shouts.  most skalds will have this, even those who spec 50 weapons so this is a notable change for them.  the 50 spec shout however is irrelevant.  no one who actually understands what a skald is supposed to do in rvr will choose this spec.  if skalds had 2.0 and shield this would be great though, it would allow a spec of 40ish weapon 50 songs 42 shield.  that is how a skald SHOULD look.  i would reactivate for six months immediately for that.  unfortunately it looks like it will never happen.<br>
<br>
the higher level DD (singular), when coupled with the lower recycle time, is a useful and appreciated change.  unfortunately this is not a SKALD change.  this was done to offset the change to minstrels.  anything skalds and minstrels both get is NOT a SKALD change.  in fact, the change to minstrels is actually a boon to them as it is useful already for them to spec to 50 for the highest AA chant.  on a side note, all damage chants were increased to 1500 range.  again, not a skald change.  so far the only skald change is to lower the DD timer to match that of an existing class we share little in common with.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>- Skald base hit points have been raised.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
this, all around, is the worst choice.  it is illogical to begin with.  skalds already have essentially the same life totals as all other melee hybrids.  skalds dont die any more quickly than any other melee hybrid with the same armor and resists.  in fact, from recent personal experience in rvr i find that skalds live longer than most.  facing one of the more competent 8 man hib groups in emain this recent weekend i was the last in my group to die not once, but both times we fought them.  first 5 v 8, second 7 v 8.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>i did not live due to my personal resourcefulness.  i lived because the enemy did not deem it necessary to take the time to kill me until i was the last man standing.  i am known on sight to the majority of the enemies on my server and am known to be a competent player.  still my experienced enemies did not view me as a worthwhile threat to neutralize until all other threats were gone.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  the biggest problem with this specific change is that it is MOST likely to be viewed by decision makers at mythic as a long term &quot;fix&quot; to skalds.  when in reality it has either very little, or no impact on our rvr experience.  and it fails logic.  we are not light tanks.  why push our hits toward those of light tanks?  it makes no sense.<br>
<br>
here is the real problem in a nutshell.  mythic has not given up on the idea that where wardens are the magical chant class, and paladins are the defensive chant class, so skalds should be the offensive chant class.  the offensive class template is dead.  gone.  until mythic accepts that, skalds will continue to be the gimpy, far below average, sorry excuse for a melee hybrid that they are today.<br>
<br>
where are the real fixes?<br>
<br>
why do we have such highly resisted shouts?  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>PARTLY FIXED /CHEER</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
where is our 2.0 and shield spec?  there is no logical fix to the skald other than this that will make any worthwhile difference.  swap our small shields for evade 4 or 5 is an interesting idea, but without a self dex/quick buff that would be ineffective.  worse, it would not be in character.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>not fixed</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
where is a reason to spec anything but 50 sword/axe 43 songs, or 44/46/17?  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>not fixed</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
why do we still have useless single resist chants?  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>not fixed</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
why is there still no reason to group a skald other than run speed?  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>not fixed</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
why is there nothing for a second skald in group to do that actually matters?  a thane, berserker, savage, warrior will fill that spot better.  meaning ANY other melee.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>not fixed</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
i am sad that on a day that could be so monumentous there is such a let down.  i WANT to play daoc.  i WANT to play my skald.  however after the last six months of playing a gimped character, which in the past had been a BALANCED character, i chose to not play either my skald or daoc any more.  past history has proven that changes in patch notes are never removed.  this one last time i am holding out hope that the past will not repeat itself.<br>
<br>
edit:<br>
<br>
long as i'm at it, how about those weapon changes eh?<br>
<br>
first off i know nothing about axe so i have no comment.<br>
<br>
demolish and frost hammer are both medium damage styles. adding demolish does nothing that a second frost hammer wouldn't do. nothing good that is. it does give your target stun immunity from worthwhile stuns like slam, and while you're at it you're more likely to wiff on demolish than on another frost hammer due to the lower chance to hit.<br>
<br>
the change to the level 50 style was good for warriors. and thanes i guess. but it's a hard call. warriors and thanes spec shield, and shield works much better and more often than parry which they normally dont spec. at least not high. the question here is: having it 3rd in a highly used chain still has the drawback of trying to land 3 styles in a row. but does that make it less useful than having it second in a style chain you're not going to use? for people like myself with my skald, i will never be able to spec to 50 hammer anyway so this is a moot point. add to that the 5 i can spec parry does not make the style particularly viable, neither does it's bleed effect which makes my target un-mezzable.<br>
<br>
WHERE IS MY TO HIT BONUS ON CONQUER?  <br>
<br>
taking away ice storm really screws over nearly all midgard melees who spec sword. making it evade reactionary helps shadowblades only off the top of my head. this should have been a change made only to shadowblade sword spec. this is a huge nerf for anyone who actually plays the game who is spec'd sword. assault does NO damage, so now if you need an anytime style you will sit and pound away with a 30% damage bonus.  or 35% for 5x the endurance with polar rift LOL.  i'm not counting those people of course who only have /stick /assist and back postional on their spellbar. but for them it is irrelevant anyway, so overall this does nothing for anyone but shadowblades and ONLY if it does more damage than hamstring.  i guess hunters can spec sword, but why they would over spear i cannot comprehend.  <br>
<br>
adding sifs to the new evade chain really is a wash.  sifs really wasn't used anyway, i can't recall ever landing rush when i was sword specd so i never had the opportunity to try it out.<br>
<br>
and then we have draw out.  ALL AGGRO STYLES SHOULD HAVE HAD TO HIT BONUSES FROM THE DAY THE GAME RELEASED.  the whole point of using an aggro style to start with is that when you need it, it is an EMERGENCY.  someone soft and squishy is dying.  if it wasn't, you wouldn't be needing it. is this a good change?  yes.<br>
<br>
ALL styles should have a to hit bonus.  the very short list of why i quit this game includes the dozens, if not hundreds, of times that my skald has wiffed with conquer on a mezd target.  styles that are not blocked by defense or bladeturn should hit EVERY TIME.<br>
<br>
skalds got screwed, and with styles not only skalds but all of midgard got screwed.  (and now for obligatory rant) when alb <br>
on the other hand gets a big serving of 7 second stun.   <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.paradoxguild.com/images/phlsig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whorde>whorde</A> at: 9/15/03 11:09 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gisborne>gisborne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Fervent</span><br>  Posts: 351<br> <font color=#ff0000>(9/15/03 11:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=697.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: patch changes = worst case scenario</span><hr size=1> I find it annoying that minstrels basically got the extra DD for free (since 50 spec also gives them the last ablative chant), while we have to sacrifice weapon spec for it. Minstrels were perfectly fine. So from Mythic's point of view, the extra DD's were not a Skald fix since adding them to Minstrels was not a Minstrel fix.<br>
<br>
Personally I was hoping for something different and more unique to the Skald (vs. Minstrels) such as an increase to the DPS of the damage add chant or a new spell in BS like self-haste or another chant. I also would have like to see an increase to the duration of the insta-mez.<br>

Where's the defense? Still worst defense ever.<br>

I can see their intentions though. Attempting to give more than two viable specs. <br>

THe 50 weapon 43 song..to focus on offensive melee.<br>
The inbetweens with medium DDs and medium melee offense and still suq defense.<br>
<br>
Then the all out DD spec by having 50 battlesongs. <br>
<br>
They are all offensive specs and offense is not what the majority of skalds complained about..was defense. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elvana@teamskald>Elvana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Contributor</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#ff0000>(9/16/03 6:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=697.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> Its certainly not going to solve every issue the Skald faces but its a start.

The hitpoint boost is really almost totaly insignificant.  Perhaps it will help survive one hit from a druid but no more.<br>

<br>
We didn't need 60 - 70 more hitpoints; we need more skill points to spec with.  Phleet wants 2 per level - I don't think that's realistic, but I fail to see why 1.75 is unreasonable.  Its obvious that Mythic views this class as less group utility oriented relative to the other song classes.  As such, we should be a stronger fighting class.  With that in mind, we should have sufficient points to spec into 50 BS, at least 44 weapons for the next to last style and a solid parry skill (at least a base of 25 or so).  Right now, we can't.  Taking 50 BS means just more weapon gimpage.  That final shout is some serious Minstrel love because many of them will spec Instruments to 50 anyway; for Skalds its garbage imo.  I do like the 43rd level DD shout and the reduced timer.  Those were good improvments and the increased DA range - despite what Phleet argues - is a solid enough change, but one that should have been made eons ago.<br>
<br>
Overall, I'm not impressed.  Still waiting for Mythic to wow me. <p>Jund Bloodaxe - 50th RR 5.8 Berserker - Palo<br>

<br>
As far as the increased range on the DD song goes, I'm surprised people are griping about it, since it was a requested change by many players.  It has been in many, many team lead reports over the past months. People asked for it, and we got it. <br>
<br>
My gut feeling is that they made the DD changes for the sake of Skalds, and then gave them to Minstrels because they have the same DD line we do.  I honestly don't see why it's a big deal. The changes make skalds more effective, people can disagree on how much.  I use my DDs several times in big fights, and now I'll get to use them 25% more, for more damage, with fewer resists.  I like that. <br>
<br>
I agree that more hit points was just a way of tossing us a bone. I'll take it, but I don't expect it to fix anything.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is that Mythic is going through its own process.  Giving us the same spec points as a Thane and the ability to spec shield is a huge change to the class.  Really, it makes us a different (much more powerful) class, and so they want to try other things first. <br>
<br>
The way I see it, the best direction to go in from this point is to play with these changes (which really are an improvement) and then if we are still getting beaten by people we should beat, come back here and write it up. <br>

They are a start, and yes, they adress, at least partly, some of the more pressing issues.<br>
<br>
Worthless DD, too low level, too often resisted -&gt; partly adressed, 15 s timer is nice, so is the new level 43 bellow. But yes, the 50 shout is a gift to minstrels, not skalds. Right. But I think the timers and the level 43 shout will help a lot.<br>
<br>
The damage add range is more of a &quot;bad design decision&quot; fix, but it was a long standing issue. Even if the game has evolved so much as to make a 7dps dmg add mostly pointless, it is still a fix that makes sense.<br>
<br>
More hp is one way to adress skald survivability. Not defense. Survivability. It was requested, and needed. I am disappointed that they didn't put ways to DEFEND ourselves effectively (whether passively or actively) instead, but it is a shot at adressing an issue.<br>
<br>
With more damage, more hp, less resists (due to higher level bellow) they are trying to adress one of the bigges skald gripe, ie the &quot;mudflation vs. the static skald&quot; effect that has plagued our existence since release.<br>
<br>
So I don't think this patch is bad. It tries to adress the most prevalent issues we have outlined, in the various reports.<br>
<br>
But the big problem we all have, I think, with this patch, is that the most important skald problem (which has been time after time outlined in the skald reports), ie our lack of definition, lack of role, lack of identity has been forgotten. The number one issue.<br>
<br>
Mythic is doing an &quot;honest&quot; job at dressing the symptoms, and I will not blame them for doing so. But not the causes, the roots of the skald plight.<br>
<br>
My big concern is that the couple of hps added and the slightly better shout dps will only last as long as the next generic melee or hybrid &quot;love&quot; patch, or the next game systems overhaul - even if they will tremendously help now.<br>
<br>
I believe what we all expected was an attempt to cure the roots of the skald malaise by strongly defining or redefining the purpose and the point of playing a skald. More spec points and shield (ie : putting us as a fully defined melee hybrid), a new valuable combat song, abilities usable at range ... that would have been a less timid step, and probably a more perennial one.<br>
<br>
So wait and see how this patch will help ... <p>---------<br>

Granted, if I have a Runey who can cast the damage add around, I'm stuck out, but that's not the case for me most of the time.  <br>

I guess resists chop into the damage our damage add does, but that's true of all magic damage in the game. <p>Gotter Dammerung - 50 skald</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gisborne>gisborne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Fervent</span><br>  Posts: 352<br> <font color=#ff0000>(9/16/03 1:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=697.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The other side</span><hr size=1> &quot;Why isn't our damage song helpful?

<br>
Your main weapon has a base value of 16.2 DPS. Then add in the bonus from 2H, your strength, the value of your opponent's armor, any haste you have, styles, etc. and your DPS is more like 60. 7 DPS is a 10-15% gain in damage. <p>Eka, lvl 50 skald Percival</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=emblurr@teamskald>Emblurr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Contributor</span><br>  Posts: 54<br> <font color=#ff0000>(9/16/03 4:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=697.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re:</span><hr size=1> BTW the best defense for me is....an af charge + avoid pain 2 + armour of faith 2..thats close to 900 AF and avoid pain 2 with it.

In brief testing, nothing serious.  <br>

40 DD, 20 of each.  the 46 song one was around 8% resist<br>
the 43 one was around 28%.  <br>

The minst getting the DD is a problem because they already were defensive enough to defeat a equal rr skald maybe 60% of the time time.<br>

So I decided to check the skald changes vs my char on the live servers. Well With my char on Pendragon that has same abilities as my live one the most insulting thing I saw was our base HP increase, hold onto your butts, it was a whopping whole 50 extra HPS!!!! To me that is insignificant, and an insult. But what do you all think, this is all I have checked so far, I am still waiting for the latest version of my char to copy over at the moment, will test more later. <p>Goatex - 50 Skald/LGM Alchemist - Percival<br>

It will probably be brought more than before at level 1 but 9 points for 10% resist every 30 mins is a joke.  I guess the change was more to stop hibs makeing 100% resist screenshots with baod on pendragon than to make the RA worthwhile.<br>
