--------------------------<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>     Bugs</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Damage Adder bug still exists.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Perhaps upping the Duration/Frequency of all our songs to 6/6 instead of 5/5 (Like was done for the other chant classes) would fix our problem as well? Not sure why ours was changed to a different Duration/Frequency from the other classes since prior to that change, they were the same.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Misfires of Damage Shouts</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - On occasion if you cast a Damage Shout on a mob from the outer fringes or the range (Which is very small BTW) you will see the spell effect, get a message that it has been cast, but the mob takes no damage. Since the range of the Damage shouts are so small, there is no reason why we would be out of range of a resist message.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Speed Song drops when not in battle</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - This has been reported frequently since patch 1.50 went in. If any member of a Skald's group gets put into combat mode, the song drops for everyone in the group. This happens on a random basis, but pretty frequently. Since this was not mentioned in the patch notes as a change, we are assuming it is a bug and needs to be corrected.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Requests:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Perception, not fact, is causing a great injustice to the Skald class. We have become DAoC's equivalent of an EQ Druid. Everyone knows someone who plays one and how perfect as a class we are, yet cannot back it up with actual and factual data. Well the tally is in and the Skald players are just tired of putting up with it.<br>
Skalds, at release, were one of the stronger classes because of a number of issues within the game itself. Slowly but surely the Skald class has been brought down to it's current level by changes to the game environment itself (resists, armor changes, RAs). Now the Skald performs in the middle of the road as far as RvR goes. We are neither the best RvR class, nor the worst. This is a good thing, but this also leaves us in a bad position. Our class lacks the flavor of most classes and we have become a one trick pony. With our damage output being average, our range on shouts low, and our defenses few we have only our speed to rely on. <br>
<br>
I want to point out that the Skalds at large do not want changes to the Skald class that will make us the Uber class that people like to think we are, instead the loudest voices from the Skald community are asking for on thing:<br>
The Skalds want our class to be what our class is supposed to be, support melee.<br>
<br>
We have at our disposal only the Speed Song/Damage Song/Resist songs to add to our groups. Since Speed is usable only outside combat, we can only use it to get the troops to the fight. The damage song, while nice, has a very limited range which lends a Skald group open to AoE spells because we all have to stay very close together to have the effect of our Damage chant. The resist songs (without spam finally, and thank you) are broken into 6 separate chants, and therefore, don't get used very much.<br>
So these requests are being asked for by the Skald community to make us group friendly and allow us to do our jobs for our realm, and support the group.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   1. Song of Rest</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - This song is valuable, and only mildly so, to a solo Skald, and really only at lower level PvE. Something needs to be done about it to make it actually worthwhile to be used as a group friendly spell. Either the effect of the spell needs to be a pulsed heal (like a Paladin's) or it needs to be an out of combat spell with more Health regen per pulse, plus regen of Power and regen of Endurance. The out of combat version will not effect a solo Skald except in less downtime between battles.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   2. Damage Adder</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - This song needs it's range increased to a distance of 1500 minimum. Anything less than that just puts a Skald's entire group at risk. Since we are supposed to be group-friendly, 700 is a mightily group-unfriendly value. The fact that it's strongest value is 7.0 dps per second also needs to be reviewed.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   3. Resist songs</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - The current value of the resist songs and the levels they are attained at are not an issue. The fact that they have to be split into 6 different chants is. Combine these into 3 sets of 2 resists at a minimum or preferably 2 sets of 3 as was done for another support melee class.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   4. Rally Chant</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - This is a proposed new chant to be added to our BS spec. This chant will have the effect of Haste on a Skald's party. This would also not help a solo Skald, but would contribute to a Skald's value in a group.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   5. Evade II</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - Adding more Spec points per level would allow a Skald to raise his Parry defenses but it could also be used in ways that could conceivably cause problems. By giving Skalds Evade II, we could keep the current spec at 1.5 per level and yet get a much needed boost to our defensive ability. Since the typical Skald specs 46 BS, 44 weapon, 17 parry and the variations from that are minimal, Evade II would compliment our lack of speccing choices.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   6. Fury of the Gods Realm ability</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> needs a complete overhaul. The return on investment is just not there. We have to spend 14 to get a skill that for 30 seconds every 30 minutes give us another damage chant. Somehow we think we could have gotten something a little better as our unique realm ability. If we are stuck with Fury of the Gods as our ability then the changes to it need to be as follows: 30 second duration/Double damage of it's current value/15 minute reuse time/10 skill points. Then at least we could see a return on an investment. Otherwise it's time to go back to the drawing board with our RA and come up with one that will compliment, not waste, our unique ability.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    7. Damage adder stacking </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> needs to be reviewed for the Skald class. Our Damage adder (at its current levels) does not need to be cut in half before being added to the stacking effect. All this does is result in a sometime minor, but mostly lower overall effect of a damage chant. We cannot believe the intent of the stacking was to give us the same damage value as before the stacking. If this is the case, then why are we bothering with stacking them in the first place?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   In Closing:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The Skald class is not everything it is made out to be. Because we can run away from a battle does not make us a powerful class. It's time that the issues stated by the Skalds at large are addressed and not passed over because of a false impression that there is nothing wrong with the class.<br>
Many classes need some work, but that does not mean the Skald class should be ignored. With all the changes to the game mechanisms, it is time that adjustments were made to the Skald class so they could benefit their realm in a more proactive way.<br>

I assume you meant 30 second duration and 15 **minute** reuse.<br>

Also,  liked better how you phrased it in another one of your posts.  It should be the opposite of Bunker Of Faith....so, its dmg adder should completely offset the absorption of BoF.<br>

<br>
And evade II is not out of line. It is not rocket science to figure out that skalds have the worst global defensive skill set of any class that needs to be in melee range to be effective, and are outclassed by a few purely support classes to boot.<br>
<br>
All pure tanks and hybrids classes that have 2.0 and a shield spec have en enormous advantage (esp, of course, pure tanks with tank hps) : armsmen, paladins, warriors, thanes, heroes. Some have better armors.<br>
<br>
Light tanks have decent evade, 2.0 skill points (-&gt; higher parry skill), much more hps. Mercs have the same armor type, bladesmasters and zerkers a worse armor type admittedly, but they still overall &quot;tank&quot; much better.<br>
<br>
Assassins have an incredible evade skill, often boosted by realm abilites and naturally high dex/quick, that makes them effectively good &quot;tanks&quot; despite their low armor types.<br>
<br>
Friars have a weaker armor types, but spells that can make up partly for this deficiency, buffs, decent evade and a bit of parry.<br>
<br>
Wardens have PBT, the most powerful defensive ability in the game.<br>
<br>
Skalds have minimal evade and parry, low dex/qui and a low hp table. A defensive skill set that is a shame for a &quot;support melee&quot; class. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/ukjeld.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kjeld</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Fervent</span><br>  Posts: 111<br> <font color=#ff0000>(10/4/02 5:02:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=347.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hehe</span><hr size=1> We have become DAoC's equivalent of an EQ Druid.

Look at the minstrel rest song. The bard rest song. All of these are the same as the skald song of rest....soloing downtime reduction aids. Sorry, that's the way it is and the way it was apparently intended. If you don't like it, at least don't call it &quot;fixing&quot; the Song of Rest because it's not broken.<br>

Too bad the role of the TL seems to be advocating a boost to the class beyond reasonable limits.

-----<br>
I don't undertand what do you mean, or what design document you are referring to. If they intended the Song of Rest to be a self only power, useful only in solo situations, they wouldn't have bothered to design it as a &quot;song&quot;. They would have made it as a self buff or such.<br>
<br>
From what I can tell from Mythic &quot;litterature&quot; about skalds, they are supposed to be warrior poets, using their songs to bolster their allies into battle -&gt; group friendly. <br>
<br>
Admittedly, the &quot;of rest&quot; part of the song's title hint at a song primarily designed for downtime, and not useful during a battle. <br>
<br>
However, no one at Mythic ever mentioned that it should be designed so only a low level solo skald could ever want to use it. Each quote strongly hints at *group friendly* abilities.<br>
<br>
I am fine if the song can't be used in combat, or with drastic diminishing returns, but it should be inproved so that there is a point to play it between battle in a group situation, at level 50. The &quot;point&quot; could be anything : double or triple the hp regeneration can be one thing. An &quot;out of combat only&quot; endurance regeneration component could be good too (it will only reduce downtime. End regeneration is really overpowered only in combat situation when it allows unlimited sprinting, styling ...).<br>
<br>
It doesn't have to be as uber as the shaman buffs or the paladin song. An out of combat only ability would be perfectly fine. As long as there is a POINT in singing that thing at all in groups. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/ukjeld.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kjeld</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Fervent</span><br>  Posts: 113<br> <font color=#ff0000>(10/4/02 5:37:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=347.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Gisborne</span><hr size=1> Don't take offense, but I still you are missing the point, about what skald wants, because of your past experience as an high level minstrel. Some kind of a bias.<br>
<br>
Skalds don't want to be minstrels.<br>
<br>
When the game came out, there seemed to be a definite and distinct repartition of the music classes.<br>
<br>
The minstrel would be the sneaky, witty type, with a bag full of tricks, able to hide, charm and befuddle enemies.<br>
The bard would be the most supportive to his realm mates, with superb crowd control, and various group friendly buffs and healing powers.<br>
Skald would be the fighting type, the warrior poet, with the less &quot;fluff&quot;, less brilliant crowd control, certainly less support, but beeing able to swing a blade efficiently.<br>
<br>
Many players have created skalds with those distinct images and archetypes in mind.<br>
<br>
To put it bluntly, skald melee ability suck. And it sucks bad. Not THAT bad, but, not counting &quot;magical&quot; powers, it is worse than any class whose primary role in battle is to swing a weapon at an enemy.<br>
<br>
We don't want to be minstrels. Cease comparing us to them, and drag us to their same level of melee ability.<br>
<br>
We don't want charm. We don't want a power regeneration song. We do want to have minstrel rest song improved, like ours. We don't want to be able to charm creatures, or be able to stealth. We don't want long range, area of effect crowd control.<br>
<br>
I won't comment your attack on Roseanne's work or objectivity ... <br>
Simply, I do agree that it seems that minstrels are not at this time a &quot;complete&quot;, healthy and fully working class. <br>
They seem to suffer actually from the same identity problem that skalds are facing : the nerf of their stealth abilities and the double edged &quot;gift&quot; of the 5s cast AE mez that they apparently didn't want have somewhat blurred the lines about what a minstrel is supposed to be.<br>
I might  be wrong, but it is my perception of the minstrel's situation, enlighten me if I am wrong, no flame please <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
But as I have said in the past about Thanes or Warriors, we are not here to advocate issues with the Minstrel class.<br>
<br>
Is evade X or song Y out of line ? Are Roseanne's demands exaggerated ? You have your opinion, I have mine, Mythic will judge (or disregard the report entirely because of their chronic lack of resources, as usual). <br>
But the fact is still there : skalds are facing an identity crisis. Maybe you are confortable with the way the class performs because you came to the class with the mindset of a minstrel. The problem is, most of us are more and more restless and unconfortable with the way our role evolves. I spend more time now kicking butts with my champion on the battlegrounds than with my skald. It's a pity if you think about that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/uroseannelottsa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Roseanne Lottsa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Skald TL</span><br>  Posts: 268<br> <font color=#ff0000>(10/4/02 6:36:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=347.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gisborne</span><hr size=1> Gisborne, <br>
<br>
Iam sorry you feel like I am advocating the class far beyond what I should be.  If you are following the threads like the ones I referenced in the report, you will see I am advocating what the Skald community wants, not what I want.<br>
<br>
We are not Minstrels, nor can we be compared to them.  The only thing we have in common with them is the run song and a couple of DDs.  We have things in common with Paladins, Champions, Wardens, and Thanes as well.<br>
<br>
I post what the community asks for. Scarlet (Minstrel TL) does the same.  <br>
<br>
I am a volunteer who gets absolutly zero perks for being a TL except the honor of deflecting flames when I put up a report or when something gets nerfed.<br>
<br>
Not only do I pay for my DAoC accounts, I also pay for this bulletin board system out of my own pocket or when someone places a donation (Thanks Ed <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
I do not appreciate the aside about how I conduct myself or about the TL program, because I can tell you, those guys bust their asses for the classes they represent, and though we don't always get along (I mean how can you get along with a Hibby after all?) they are not biased towards their classes.  They take their whole realm into consideration when they work on their reports, and the game as a whole as well.<br>
<br>
We are supposed to support our group.  We currently do that in an extremely limited way.  This report reflects that lack of fulfilling our role.  None of the suggestions would make the Skald class over-powered because it adds to the realm, not to the solo Skald.  If you disagree, then post your reasons, but know that I do not accept 'bad idea because xxx class has it worse' as a valid excuse.  It is just the inverse of the excuse that 'we should have this because xxxx class does'<br>

Oh, and Gisborne, your point about minstrel defense will be valid the day Skalds can charm red pets, recast mez, AE mez, stun and stealth. In the meantime ....<br>

<br>
&quot;All pure tanks and hybrids classes that have 2.0 and a shield spec have en enormous advantage (esp, of course, pure tanks with tank hps) : armsmen, paladins, warriors, thanes, heroes. Some have better armors.<br>
<br>
Light tanks have decent evade, 2.0 skill points (-&gt; higher parry skill), much more hps. Mercs have the same armor type, bladesmasters and zerkers a worse armor type admittedly, but they still overall &quot;tank&quot; much better.<br>
<br>
Assassins have an incredible evade skill, often boosted by realm abilites and naturally high dex/quick, that makes them effectively good &quot;tanks&quot; despite their low armor types.<br>
<br>
Friars have a weaker armor types, but spells that can make up partly for this deficiency, buffs, decent evade and a bit of parry.<br>
<br>
Wardens have PBT, the most powerful defensive ability in the game.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Skalds aren't any of those classes either, yet when I use minstrels to point out that skalds don't have the worst defense for a class that relies on melee to kill their targets everyone jumps on my case.<br>
<br>
Comparing the &quot;rest song&quot; of all three speed classes is valid, because they all are essentially the same. They ALL suck. They ALL are only useful for reducing downtime. Bards and minstrels are more of a support class than skalds, and less likely to solo, yet the skald song should be more &quot;support&quot; than theirs? <br>
<br>
The rest song is there to reduce downtime soloing. Why is it a song? Um, cause we sing songs? Why would it be a self-buff (as someone suggested) if we have no other buffs? <br>
<br>
<br>
As for my comments on the roles of TL's, I stand by them. The TL system, in my observation, is all about advocating your class at the expense of overall balance. By not having a Mid TL, Hib TL, Alb TL, and RvR TL Mythic made sure that the reports would be open for one-sided advocacy of individual classes. It's because of this system that we are seeing &quot;inflation&quot; of classes. Previously balanced classes are falling behind even though they haven't been nerfed.<br>
<br>
Now, within that system, I think that Rosey does a very good job. This report, relative to the majority of reports, is reasonable. That doesn't mean it's not open to criticism.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/ugisborne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>gisborne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Fervent</span><br>  Posts: 128<br> <font color=#ff0000>(10/5/02 4:31:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=347.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Skald report</span><hr size=1> I can't edit my post, but I wanted to add this.

We need to fill both roles.  Minstrels rest chant might be the same but they have the Pallys to use theirs.  In Midgard, it's what the skald has or nothing.    So in my opinion, they either need to give us the ablity to perform both roles or add a class to the realm.  This way we can have some advantage to having two skalds in a group.  <br>
<br>
I don't think anything asked for in this thread is out of line.  I would just like to see their reasons for not increasing the range of our chants.  That would be an extremely minor addition which is long overdue. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/umaximumstorage.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MaximumStorage</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Contributor</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#ff0000>(10/5/02 8:31:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=347.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> hmm</span><hr size=1> Personally if they made or gave us resist chants that were multi-resist and drained power like the paladins chants I would never use them. Power drain is bad and I don't see them giving us a non power-drain version. This is aside from the fact that the only time any resist chant is ever used is when you have 2-3 skalds in 1 group. If you are the only skald and you enter in melee w/o damage adder you are not effective. There is very rarely any situation 'outside' of a fight which would require using a resist chant. <br>
<br>
As far as the song of haste goes - healers got celerity short duration haste. Of course thats from aug line which means 1% of the healers actually have it but if they gave us haste it wouldnt stack with celerity or probably not with the conc based haste buff either which would just interfere with healer usefulness.<br>
<br>
Suggestions: Let current resist chants stack on top of healer/shaman group resist buffs but not go over the hard cap for resists. Currently the resist chants over-write the healer/shaman spells (if it gives a higher % resist) and when the chant is turned off their spells are gone. <br>
<br>
Second  suggestion: I am hoping for some area-effect chant which effects your enemies in battle. Instill fear in their hearts at the sound of your troops warcrys. Possible effects might include, causing effected enemies to miss more often(lower +to hit) or create defensive penalty to effected enemies (much like styles do when you use them) This is not something which exists in another realm it would be a nice class ability I think and something worth using beside dmg chant in battle if implemented correctly. Currently there is no other chant worth using please lets make one!<br>
<br>
Lastly:Picking realm abilities as a skald doesnt seem like there is anything to get besides a few which most everyone have deemed the only worthy choices. <br>
<br>
Acuity buff doesnt really increase the damage that much and remember that any dmg increase you get from charisma buffage is reduced by the targets body resist so you're really only getting a very small dmg increase making it very undesirably when you can spend these points on making  your melee better(god knows you need to). <br>
<br>
Serenity:good for leveling but post level 50 fights last on the order of say 30 seconds on average serentiy in RvR seems wasted when you regen all your power back on the portal pad.<br>
<br>
So what else can you really do to effect your battlesongs with realm skills your class defining attribute and its very lacking with ways to customize its skills. Perhaps add chance to critical hit for all speed classes instant DD(Access to Wild Power). Doesn't seem overpowering considering the low base dmg. <br>
<br>

<br>
I pretty much am on board with the report.  I wish it's tone was even nastier - but hey thats just me =)  <br>
<br>
I'm not sure I agree with Evade 2 over an increase in skill points though.  I would rather have more parry than Evade 2.  Seriously how much more do you really think thats going to help?  My SB has Evade 5 so far and I evade far less often that I would expect.   I also don't feel that this addresses the imbalance between the other support melee spec points vs. skalds.  Paladins can fully spec their Chant and either slash/crush or thrust if desired as well as drop 28 points into parry or shield.  If thats the standard for support melee then giving Skalds Evade II doensn't even come close!<br>
<br>
I'd also like to see a comparision of the other support melee classes and what they bring to the table for their groups vs. skald for their groups.  I don't think this report clearly defines the blatent differences in their faces enough for them to get the picture. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=squee>Squee</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Contributor</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#ff0000>(10/5/02 12:43:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=347.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Another point I forgot</span><hr size=1> What about adding something regarding the insane power consumption of our DD's Mez's Snares - and the fact that they all require endurance as well as a small amount of power to even turn on. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/uroseannelottsa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Roseanne Lottsa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Skald TL</span><br>  Posts: 269<br> <font color=#ff0000>(10/5/02 3:35:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=347.topic&index=18>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Another point I forgot</span><hr size=1> Squee, while I don't like the power/endurance usage, it is balanced against the other shout classes and to change it for use would take us out of alignment with them.

1. Song of Rest is simply not worth getting or useing. I don't care if they up the Minstrel and Bard's too, but our certainly needs work.<br>
<br>
2. Damage add radius - even fighting in Malm in a relatively small area I was being asked by some members if I had battle chant on. Radius increase for all our songs would be nice.<br>
<br>
3. resist songs - I'm not too worried about that, but at least it gives multiple skald groups something to do.<br>
<br>
4. Haste chant would be nice. Maybe in that gap where we have no songs for a few levels. Also have a more powerful one somewhere between 46 and 50 to give skalds a reason to spec BS above 46.<br>
<br>
5. The extra defence of Evade II would be nice. I wouldn't push too hard for this one though.<br>
<br>
6. Fury of the Gods sucks in its present form. I totally agree with this.<br>
<br>
7. I would put that as a bug and not a request. If they want stacking to halve a song/spell it should have the smaller one.
