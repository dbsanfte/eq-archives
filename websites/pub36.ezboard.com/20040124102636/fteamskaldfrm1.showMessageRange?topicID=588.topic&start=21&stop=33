<br>
Perhaps they knew it was due, and they are just accepting it. Am I happy it happened? Well, yes and no.<br>
<br>
Yes, because the Shadowzerks were a little stronger than intended. They were not meant to do the damage they are, and LA gave them a way to outmelee most classes. A majority of the reason the assassin class' melee was reduced was due to the fact that the Shadzerks were taking down tanks and what not. Even after that, Shadzerks were still taking down the light tanks with little to no problem.<br>
<br>
No, because the Zerks are being heavily affected by this, and it is one of thier defining features. I feel sorry for our brothers-in-arms.<br>
<br>
Now, what does this mean for the skald? Very little. LA is not one of our skills. It is not something we are known for. Why are we arguing about it when we have nothing to do with it?<br>
<br>
Now, does the Block/Parry thing hurt us abit? Well, in a matter of speaking, yes, it does. But it was a bug, and a bug in bad need of fixing. Bravo to Mythic for this one.<br>
<br>
And as for people cancelling, go ahead. If you feel the game is going to be lessened for you because this patch is going in, so be it. Me? Im just going to keep going on, and find other ways to take down those I have to. <br>
<br>
After all, whats victory without struggle?<br>

If you would just read what I said, it would clearly mark that I said the MAIN class (Zerks). SB's are not the main users of LA, altho with the recent FOTM's, it would make it seem so.<br>
<br>
But my point wasnt about the fact that people were arguing. My point was the fact that WE were arguing about it, and it has NO bearing on us as a class. <p>Bays Endruhms<br>

<br>
Right now, the LA does not affect skalds directly.  But the loss of end regen does.  When it goes live and the shamans cant buff everyone, only the tanks and casters will get shaman buffs.  Skalds, as support classses, will not get priority for anything.  So, we will be losing end buffs, and possibly the dual buffs.  That, my firends, will kill the skald.  We will be relegated to taxi more and more in the battlefield.  And I already dont like how my sklad plays in RvR.  Only way to survive is 1v1 or zerging.  And usually I die anyhow. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kortzdymundskyn>Kortz Dymundskyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Participant</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#ff0000>(4/28/03 1:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=588.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Patch killing skalds</span><hr size=1> Thank you Kilgour. <br>
<br>
That I can understand, and see how we Skalds are going to be hurt by the patch overall. I agree that since we have lower priority over some of the more warrior types (Zerks, Wars, Thanes), we wont be as effective in RVR (this almost sounds like an oxymoron) due to the fact we will be out of End much faster, and thus our sprint to escape and our ability to style will be just annoyances on the battlefield, not true meaningful ways of damage.<br>
<br>
However, we are the speed class in Midgard. As much as we hate to think of ourselves with only one purpose, and that being to ferry people about, it is sad to say that it is basically what we are. Until Mythic defines what we are supposed to be (fighting caster, casting fighter, support fighter, light tank), we are stuck with this role.<br>
<br>
I still think we should get the End Regen chant, IMO. Take it away from the Shaman, and give us a reason to actually support the classes of our realm. Something else to let us do our jobs of being a support class, if that is in fact what we are. Not only would we have a reason to be asked for, but the Shaman could concentrate more on the other buffs without having to worry about how many they have cast or conc left. This would also solve the whole range thing, as it would be a group chant, effective out to the range 1500 or what not. Just a thought....<br>
<br>
Oh yea, and can we have it fixed so that we stop showing up as healers in the Looking For (class type)? You know how annoying it is to get sent a tell to join a group, get where the group is, and then find out they thought you were a Healer, and not a Skald? <p>Bays Endruhms<br>

Shaman changes as of most recent patch as tested, Shaman end regen is now single line, if a shaman went 32 Aug they nolonger have end regen 3 as a single target and end regen 4 as a Group, instead they only have end regen 4, which takes 4 conc points to cast, that is a significant number (by Mythics own standards Shaman should be given a respec since their end was changed so drastically). We are only realm that has 1 form of end regen and ours takes conc, the other realms have atleast 2 and I don't think they take conc at all, we have least amount of classes available to us, etc..... <p>Johannas - 50 Armsman - Guinevere<br>

<br>
I play Euro server and come mid june the core of my guild will most likely let their accounts expire, I wont say it is all the fault of the nerfs but it is a significant reason. We all know LA/End needed a tweak but it's WHEN they did it not how that is causing the problems imo. Bad enough we see our counterparts/enemies getting better knowing that our patch is still weeks away, but no they need to slap us in the face by reducing the few effective classes we have. If this nerf had come in the middle of the Midgard patch it would have caused pain but we'd have seen our realm mates getting better to take up the slack and most likely it would have slipped through with significantly less trouble. Mythic are shooting themself in the foot giving people the reason they need to try SB/SWG/Planetside/Insert game here, why should they pay subs to play a class they are beginning to hate in the hope that their class love comes along eventually.<br>
<br>
And to keep this on topic, some weeks back in an attempt to maintain interest in the game 8 of us rolled the ubiquitous 'balanced group'. Mid levelling our skald delegate got a life and gave up playing, we carried on regardless all hitting 50 and heading to RVR knowing that 2 of the grp had 50 skalds(and 1 a L47) that could fill in with while our replacement was found. Because i'm the Pac healer I volunteered to run speed one weekend, I spent 4hours in the frontier with the group and the experience was painful. I was hitting people for 150's with Havoc (without Mopain 3 crits it would have been pointless even swinging), I was DD'ing for low/mid 100's, I was being hit back for 400+ on a lot of occasions and was almost always among the first to die. By the end of the night I was /stick taxi with little interest in fighting, I had left the game in frustration 3 times, I was &gt;||&lt; this close to deleting all my chars and nuking the game from my HD. This game is my relief after work, my relaxation, I shouldn't be paying good money for massive frustration and quite honestly very soon I wont be.....<br>
<br>
PS I have a 50 SB, he gathers dust because unbuffed without SC armour he isn't the all powerful LA killing machine people seem to think he is, in fact he's just a.n.other average char who only wins fights because he chooses them very very carefully.<br>
<br>
PPS My PAC Healer is actually fun, I have the real feeling that I DO something for my group, a feeling my skald hasn't had in a very very long time. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kjeld>Kjeld</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Fervent</span><br>  Posts: 292<br> <font color=#ff0000>(4/29/03 5:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=588.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Timing</span><hr size=1> I do agree about the terrible, terrible timing mistake Mythic is making.<br>
<br>
- They just finished albion love<br>
<br>
- There was terrible protesting, and general foaming at the mouth flames from hibs and albion ... so much that Mythic's producer felt compelled to write a producer letter to, basically, announce Mythic was going to comply with the whining.<br>
<br>
- They nerf midgard during hibernian love<br>
<br>
I am not contesting that these changes, though way, way to harsh, had to be made, to correct an imbalance. However, the way, the moment and the context makes Mythic look like they are basically giving up to the squeakiest wheel and the loudest whiners. <br>
<br>
It is extremely disturbing, as long known issues, for all realms and all classes, brought to them by mature players, testers, TLs, seem completely ignored. Yet, it takes a protest, mass threats of cancellations on some flame forums, and a lot of moaning to have them react to a (long standing, the LA bug was introduced what ? more than 6 months ago) bug.<br>
<br>
I do believe (I really hope, at least ) that Mythic doesn't have that kind of behavior, and that they are doing things on good reasons (and that there is a Midgard reassessment coming before this patch goes live). I really hope so. But the timing, the context of the changes make them really *look* like they did a botched attempt at damage control, and that the spilling of Midgard blood was aimed at appeasing the angry albs/hibs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=johannas98>Johannas 98</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Participant</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#ff0000>(5/1/03 11:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=588.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Timing</span><hr size=1> I know I been bitching alot, nice to see them undo some of the nerfage, and give some Mids some love too, but does anyone else find it a little disheartening that while they are moveing towards &quot;class balance&quot; they seem to be ignoreing us? <p>Johannas - 50 Armsman - Guinevere<br>

<br>
What makes me want to quit is not the nerfs, but the 1.62D where my summon SM got &quot;improved&quot; but is still gimp. 18 months of a 100% broken spec line and they can't even fix it up above 50% broken.<br>

They will probably most be going 50 mana, 20 sun, 4 ench from now on, which would get them the last focus shield and the last heat debuff (again) but.. but, it's a nerf - and it was aimed at enchanters. Enough to make me smile. <br>
<br>
Oh and Runemasters got quite some luving, now lets hope they swap the cold debuff with the matter one before every runie out there has respeced. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=johannas98>Johannas 98</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Participant</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#ff0000>(5/2/03 6:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=588.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> Yea, but they supposedly nerfed back styles (or atleast reduced it from 90 to 60 degrees) but they also commented that the back and side styles have the same bonus on them, so I don't know if you could call it a true nerf or not, since they did increase side styles. <p>Johannas - 50 Armsman - Guinevere<br>
