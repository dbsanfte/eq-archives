The Art of Dying<br>
<br>
Author: Ferralis &quot;Instadeath&quot; Wildwood ()   Organization: Kel'Daoine<br>
<br>
Recently I have been hearing reports of deaths occuring among the populace of Norrath. Not only do more and more deaths occur each day, but these are being accomplished in an extremely shoddy and amateurish fashion.<br>
<br>
After over a year of effort, constantly polishing my style, I have come up with a point system that I believe may help improve the quality of deaths in Norrath. The point system is primarily based on style, with higher scores indicating better performance. It is my aim to edify the general populace and perhaps point out a few style enhancements that may prove worthwhile.<br>
<br>
The point system starts out with a base of Zero (being the basic newbie death) and extends upwards. It is not a fixed system, so particularly noteworthy style issues may be allotted extra points. Remember to add or subtract all point scores that apply.<br>
<br>

...eventually finding the group, bringing the train: +20<br>
...bonus for killing every member of the party: +30<br>
<br>
As you can see, this is still very much a work in progress. Of course, discovering all the nuances involved in the art of dying will be the work of many years and may not be attainable at all, yet I have undertaken to make it my life's work. Many do not understand this subtle art yet and seem to see each death as a bad thing, not the opportunity for improvement and character development that it really is. My personal best score on this scale so far is 185.<br>
<br>
So, print this list out, all, and start working on your form! No more will death be reviled... soon, really good deaths will get the respect they deserve.<br>

<br>
So, I'm in the Hole with a raid as Dazahan, back around level 52 or so.  We'd been in Permafrost for a Vox raid or something recently, and I had a couple items to farm in there, so I was bound in Permafrost at the preacher room, and used to go run back and forth from there to the king room etc.<br>
<br>
So, we finish this Hole raid, and I'm TLing people out.  It's down to me and another wizard, and we're just up the halls from the tower with the wanderers and revenants.  We checked to make sure all were out, and had just said &quot;ok gating now&quot; and so forth.  He starts to gate, just as a revenant or something is coming up the hallway.  Its arms are outstretched, and it comes right up behind the other wizard (Kazath if you knew him).  It stops, and looks like it's gonna tap him on the shoulder, just as he disappears.  I was typing out some kind of warning (bad idea).  He's gone, and I'm staring at this wanderer.  &quot;Gate&quot; I think.  So, I gate.  Some kinda nasty necro dot lands on me having something to do with blood being boiled or somesuch.  My gate goes off.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whew!&quot; I think.  I get done zoning and I'm in Permafrost.  &quot;Ah, okay, I'll just sit this through and then start a little farming,&quot; I think.  &quot;/gu hey Kaz, that was really close, right as you gated, a revenant came up behind you and almost tapped you on the shoulder.. luckily I gated out as he dotted me.&quot;  We joke some more about it.  I look at my health.  Hmm, 50 percent.  Jeez, this dot works kinda fast, but I bet it's almost done.  Oh, I don't have any hp buffs on, that's probably why.<br>
<br>
A moment later, I'm at 30.  Uh oh.  /who<br>
<br>
[ANONYMOUS] Dazahan &lt;Silver Drakes&gt;<br>
There is 1 player in Permafrost.<br>
<br>
Hmm, no healers.<br>
<br>
Ok, well, maybe if I just stay sitting, I can beat this.<br>
<br>
/gu hehe, uh oh, this DOT is nasty... at 20.<br>
<br>
10...<br>
(lightbulb goes on, though too late)<br>
You begin to memorize Fay Gate.<br>
You have finished memorizing Fay Gate.<br>
/gu any clerics still on from the raid?  If so can I ask a big favor?<br>
(spell is grey still)<br>
You died.<br>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br>
Lightbulb #2 goes on while zoning... I had bandages on me, and had I thought of this at 50, I probably would have survived it.<br>
Had to drag a poor cleric all the way to permafrost.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Another fun Hole memory was a friend Bangor (a rogue) getting aggroed behind the raid, resulting in a train's worth of mobs on him.  At the time, that would have meant death for several people if not the (w)hole raid.  He was within sight of us, and realized he couldn't bring them.  He stopped, and waved goodbye just before dying.  Just the calm peaceful (pre-SoL face animations) look on his face as he was waving, just before getting splatted by a train, stuck in my mind as pretty hilarious.<br>

<br>
I was in the scryer room with my new DogDog - I'd been 49 for a while but hadn't had a chance to cast the pet before now so I was really enjoying watching it eat really green ice goblins.<br>
<br>
Anyway, it was about 3 AM and I was reminded by my wife that some of that sleep stuff would be a good thing.<br>
<br>
For whatever reason I decide to run out instead of gating out so I put DogDog on follow and then decide to see if he can path all the way to the zone.<br>
<br>
So I buff him and run to the zone.  DogDog picks up a few goblins so I just keep going.<br>
<br>
I'm standing at the Permafrost zone line, there's 3 or 4 super green ice goblins beating on me for, you know, 5 or 6 points at a time.  I keep hitting a /pet report health hotkey and although he's not close enough for me to get an answer I'm not getting &quot;You don't have a pet to command&quot; so I'm enjoying the thought of my loyal wolf pet chewing through half of perma to get to me.<br>
<br>
Suddenly I just fall over - I really should have paid attention to the super green ice goblins that oh so very slowly managed to send me back to my bind point...<br>

<br>
 I was playing my rogue, I think 47 at the time and was doing CR after a failed Vox raid. I had to recover a couple of corpses from the pits. So I am dragging the corpses out of them one after the other and manage to get past the tentacle terrors on top of the ledge over Vox without aggroing them, until there's only 2 corpses left. Then I aggro one by not moving past it fast enough, it hit me, I lose sneak and consequently aggro Vox. So I am running toward the entrance as fast as I can hoping to die as close as possible to the rock for an easier CR. But Vox isn't chasing me, she's casting, and I am past the rock when I am struck down by wrath. Down to half a bubble of health. I go down the ramp, and realize neither Vox nor the tentacle terrors are chasing me for some reason. I sit down, and start camping... and make it. <br>
<br>
I log back but I lost all buffs, so I run to the zone to get a sow to finish the CR. I only got 1 bub of health but I am pretty sure I don't need to sneak and hide to the zone. After all, aren't these goblins super green? Well they weren't green enough to avoid taking one bub of damage JUST before zoning. As I was loading I also realized I had a fungi tunic in my inventory and a few more hps would have allowed me to make it.
