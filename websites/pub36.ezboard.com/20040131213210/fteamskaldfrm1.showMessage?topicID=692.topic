<br>
1.62 - <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;This is a very slippery slope. At this time, we're not planning on adding any more defense to skalds, although we do want to keep a close eye on this aspect and understand the concerns&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
1.64 - <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Right now we're not going to focus on skald defense. We might look into where their hit points stand, but even if a change was made here, the difference in hit point tenths between classes would be fairly minor and won't have a big impact on skald survivability&quot; </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
1.64 - &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Parry - The only Speccable means of defense for the Skald is relegated to getting the leftover Spec points. A typical Skald will end up with a Parry of 17. Since we need to Spec high in Battlesongs and Weapon just to be competitive, we have to use RAs to balance out this spec. Lowering either Battlesong or Weapon does not return worthy results, even with the current changes to Parry/Block.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Feedback</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
--------------------------------------<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I am willing to be convinced further, but right now I am not sure that trading weapon spec for parry isn't a valid option for skalds. I do agree that battlesongs is something most will want to keep high. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
--------------------------------------&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
To summarise what I believe has been said is that the developers think that the amount of parry that could possibly be speced with evade 1 is a sufficient amount of defense with the other abilitys that can be used in a defensive nature in the Battlesong line to create a decent level of survivability for a melee focused class. Basicly this is just my thoughts on the issue (mostly old news to experienced Skalds).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Specing for defence (Parry) and Evade</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Looking at spec choice possibilitys I dont believe tradeing either Battlesongs or Weapon for Parry creates a suitable return as with other classes for the following reasons. Firstly a Skald must at least have 44 in Battlesongs due to the double stacking nature of the Skald direct damage shouts. Missing out on the level 44DD means a drop of 18 levels on the &quot;Battle&quot; DD line to a level 26DD which is a significant drop in damage and a significant rise in resist rates (id guess around 50%) which is considered unexceptable on a timed spell. This is a fairly significant problem. The only way to counter this and spec in an alternate way while retaining a reasonable level of damage is to spec to 50 in Sword or Axe (the level 50 Hammer style is unsuitable for Skalds). However this creates its own problem as most if not all groups a Skald is invited to will expect a Skald to have the Heavenly Song of Travel spell (204% movement speed increase gained at 43 Battlesongs) which means the Skald is forced into a 50 Weapon, 43 Battlesong and 2 parry spec.<br>
<br>
The level 44 Weapon style is also highly desirable especialy for Axe and Hammer being the second part of a back positional chain and most Skalds consider it a &quot;must have&quot;. On Sword its not as important being the third part of a parry chain but even then missing out on the weapon skill gained from this is a problem especialy on a class with fairly mediocre weapon skill (and the style is occasionaly nice to). A 50 Dwarf Skald with RR5, + 10 strength at creation, + 75 strength item bonus and + 15 Weapon item bonus will have 978 weapon skill with 39 Weapon and 1011 with 44 Weapon ( a 3.5% increase roughly). <br>
<br>
The following specs are possible under this theory:<br>
<br>
39 Weapon (978ws), 44 Battlesongs and 29 Parry <br>
(29*0.5+5 = 19.5% parry chance) <br>
44 Weapon (1011ws), 44 Battlesongs and 21 Parry<br>
(21*0.5+5 = 15.5% parry chance)<br>
49 Weapon (1043ws), 44 Battlesongs and 4 Parry (4*0.5+5=7% parry chance)<br>
50 Weapon (1049ws) , 43 Battlesongs and 2 Parry<br>
(2*0.5+5 = 6% parry chance)<br>
<br>
With the range of effect increase of the 7.5 dps Damage adder in 1.65 indicated in the TL feedback we may also see these specs more often:<br>
<br>
44 Weapon (1011ws), 46 Battlesongs and 17 Parry <br>
(17*0.5+5 = 13.5% parry chance)<br>
47 Weapon (1030ws), 46 Battlesongs and 5 Parry <br>
(5*0.5+5 = 7.5% parry chance)<br>
<br>
*Note this is based on the research of others indicateing one point of Parry under level 50 is equal to 0.5% chance to parry and that there is a base possibility of 5% parry chance.<br>
<br>
Looking at these examples a player going for 39 in Weapon must give up roughly 3.5% weapon skill for only a 4% increase in chance to parry. The importance of parry and weapon skill is debateable but most Skalds feel that the weapon skill is worth considerably more than the parry chance given that weapon skill will be part of damage calculation (and I belive the enemies chance to succesfully defend the attack) every time the Skald hits an enemy with their weapon. Thus you see Skald templates like the 49 Weapon, 44 Battlesongs and 4 Parry that choose to ignore the parry spec possible in favour of more weapon skill as its such a small increase.<br>
<br>
Another reason for this choice to ignore Parry is that a Skalds dexterity, a statistic used in the parry chance calculation, does not rise with a Skalds level meaning that most Trolls will still have 35 dex, most Norse and Dwarves will still have 50 dex and most Kobolds will still have 70 dex meaning with item bonuses a Skalds dexterity will be at a base of between 110-145 at level 50. Again as damage and health points are considered more important in RvR compared to the perception of a weak defense system the majority of Skalds will put 10 points in strength, 10 points in constitution and 10 points in charisma at creation. These two facters combined mean that a Skald will have low dexterity in the parry chance formula and low dexterity and quickness in the evade forumla.  This is more of an issue for Skalds than most other classes with 1.5 spec and parry (Friar, Valewalker, Savage and Warden) as we have no way to augument our defences through any type of self buff,  no baseline buffs for soloing, no way to act outside of a fight beyond a very minimal effect and no reason to spend points into dexterity at creation as the weapon types we can use are based on strength not dexterity or a mix of strength and dexterity and apart from Parry the only thing effected by dexterity for a Skald is evade 1 compared to the evade 3+ on some of the mentioned classes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Battlesong defensive abilities </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The &quot;defensive&quot; abilitys gained in the Battlesong line does little to help. The instant-single target mesmerise is fairly short duration (especialy when faceing high resist buffs and/or against anti-mesmerise/resist RAs and/or anti-mesmerise skills which is pretty common) and will often be automaticly resisted (which resets the recast timer) due to a mesmerise immunity from a Healers AOE mesmerise spell. The Snare is also of little help being of fairly low value (40%) and breaking on any damage.  Using it to escape from an opponent can often result in a high damage back positional attack or even a melee based stun or snare with a higher value then our own!  The resist chants are very difficult to use in an effective defensive manner given that they are 6 single line chants with one for each magic type so it is often very hard to have the correct magical type up for a certain spell being cast on you unless its a long battle against one enemy.  They tend to be used more in &quot;static&quot; situations such as a keep defense or siege where you know an enemy caster using a certain type magic of spell is present as a preventative measure or quickly switched on to fight a Hibernian or Albion PBAOE spell user.  Predicting other spell magic types in a &quot;fluid&quot; environment before they are cast is very very difficult.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Weapon defensive abilities</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The weapon styles gained by the Skald also do very little to help defensivly. Most of the inhibiting effects (stun or snare) that are useful defensivly tend to be from a parry or block reactional or positional which makes them very hard to use succesfully for the Skald or impractical in a face to face fight. They are also mostly of very short duration or high endurance cost.  The defensive bonuses in Skald weapon spec possibilitys are also either non existent or very lacking as well of being mainly of low to medium value. Perhaps this issue will be addressed in the style review though. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Other melee based hybrids defensive abilities</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Skalds would seem to be one of the least well equiped melee based hybrids in terms of defense for base or spec point defense:<br>
<br>
Skald (1.5 Spec points) - Chain armour (27%abs) + Evade 1 + Mesmerise shout + Parry + Resist chants<br>
Reaver (2.0 Spec points) - Chain armour (27%abs) + Evade 1 + DPS debuff shout + Large specable shield + Parry<br>
Paladin (2.0 spec points) - Plate armour (34%abs) + 56 AF self buff + 127 AF chant + Large specable shield + Endurance regeneration chant + Parry + resist chants<br>
Friar (1.5 Spec points) - Leather armour (10%abs) + 15% absorb self buff + 58 AF self buff + Evade 5 + Parry<br>
Valewalker (1.5 Spec points) - Cloth armour (0%abs) + 33%abs self buff + 250 AF self buff + Evade 4 + Parry<br>
Champion (2.0 Spec points) - Scale armour (26%abs) + str/con self buff + str/con debuff shout + dex/qui debuff shout + attack speed debuff shout + Evade 1 + Medium specable shield + Parry<br>
Thane (2.0 Spec points) - Chain armour (26%abs) + str/con buff + Medium specable shield + Parry<br>
Minstrel (1.5 spec points) - Chain armour (26%abs) + Evade 2 + Stun shout + Charmable pet + specable stealth + Ablative chant<br>
<br>
* Note some of these classes also get small unspecable shield<br>
<br>
The majority of these classes get either a high evade rate or medium/large specable shield as well as some other form of defense as part of their magical line. The Minstrel is the noteable exception lacking parry, high evade level or shield but gains a charmable pet, ablative chant, stun shout (rarely on an immunity timer due to Albions lack of AOE stun spells) and stealth in its spec lines.  Its a difficult class to compare given the fairly unique nature of its defensive abilitys but even then evade 2 and the dexterity gained while it levels is arguably as good as a Skalds evade 1 and small amount of parry modified by the Skalds low dexterity and quickness.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Realm abilities</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Although perhaps it should not be considered part of a classes ability the RAs available to a Skald are one of its few redeeming defensive features and are thus often used to balance out its lack of defensive base and speced abilitys.  Particuarly Avoid Pain and Armour of Faith are popular for the reason as it allows a Skald a better chance of surviving attention by an enemy melee.  The RAs focused on augumenting a Skalds base and speced abilitys however are not actually that popular.  Mastery of Parrying is rarely taken above one or two levels (and normaly at higher RR) due to the perception that Parry really doesnt help that much as it will still only be around a 25% parry chance at best (still modified by the low dexterity) and it only covers a frontal arc.  Mastery of Blocking is rarely if ever brought by Skalds due to the fact that small unspeced shield and a one handed weapon has a very niche use for a Skald (most will use two handed weapon exclusivly).  Really Dodger would seem a more appropriate RA for the Skald than Mastery of Blocking although it is not available.  Ignore Pain is more of a cure than a solution in most cases often being the only way a Skald will have a chance of beating a class with better defense as well as being hugely expensive when combined with its pre-requisites (23 points in total).  There are several other RAs that effect Skalds defense in a minor way but are not really major issues.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Conclusion</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
In conclusion the Skald lacks in defense. Its support abilites dont allow it to effectivly act outside of a fight (or rather it contributes very little by doing so) and the majority of other hybrids and certainly the melee based tank, assasin and even archer classes have far greater defensive ability.  Low dexterity and quickness combined with &quot;forced&quot; low speced defense, low baseline defense and medium health points leave the Skald as one of the most vulnerable melee focused classes in the game.  While it is possible to supplement a Skalds defense to an exceptable level through RAs this is not really a satisfactory solution as it means the Skald will fall behind in other areas meaning that there is still an imbalance.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Possible survival improvement suggestions:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
1. An absorb self buff:<br>
<br>
Level 5 - 1% absorb<br>
Level 15 - 2% absorb<br>
Level 25 - 3% absorb<br>
Level 35 - 4% absorb<br>
Level 45 - 5% absorb<br>
<br>
2. Additional spec points (1.7 allowing for more parry)<br>
3. An AF self buff<br>
4. Additional hitpoints<br>
5. Higher evade and access to Dodger (remove Mastery of Blocking)<br>
6. Some sort of self castable proc (ablative, HoT proc etc) <br>

<br>
In Example you mention the Minstrel but leave out their ablative chant.  That one skill raises the Minstrel defense above many other classes.  I also think you should add it a line for all the Melee/Hybrid classes.  Wardens with their PBT in example.  <br>
<br>
As most skalds agree we simply have the worst combination of natural skills/spec/spec points and RAs for any class expected to wade into melee combat.<br>

However any of the proposed fixes will do nothing to impact the effectiveness of a skald.<br>
<br>
Skalds and paladins are really the 2 classes which should be compared.  It is clear that they are the offensive and defensive variants of the same chanting class to come off the mythic drawing board.  Wardens are in the same line too, they got bubble, skalds got run speed, paladins got nothing since there are so many alb classes to spread the abilities out on.  Wardens being the &quot;magical&quot; version of the chanting melee have strayed so far from the initial concept it's not longer useful to directly compare them, so now it's just paladin vs skald, defensive vs offensive.<br>
<br>
In the beginning, skalds were very solid ... fun to play, and effective.  And in the beginning paladins weren't so great.  At least in RVR, PVE wise they have always been solid.  Then as months passed, everything about a skald was nerfed.  Damage from weapon, damage from shouts, crits in rvr capped at 50%, duration of mez, chance to land a mez, all have been nerfed.  Paladins on the other hand have had defensive abilities more or less fixed in RVR, to match that of PVE.  Then they were given endurance regen so they can slam forever, and better resist chants.  Not that they use them anyway, but they are in fact there.  A year ago, in a skald vs paladin fight it came down to this - could the skald kill the paladin before the skald ran out of endurance?  Now there is simply no comparison, a paladin will completely destroy a skald every time.  To compare current viable group support, paladins brings heal chant, end regen, and slam as utility to a group.  A skald brings .... a non-combat run speed buff, and ..... the ability to interrupt a caster on a 20 second timer !   Whooo hoo  !<br>
<br>
The concept of an offensive melee is gone from this game.  Skalds are gone, berserkers are gone, and soon savages will be added to the list.  Armsmen and Heros are gone, if you look at their specialized 2h specs.  That class type is dead.  It no longer fits with the mythic &quot;vision&quot; of a melee class.  Being &quot;offensive&quot; means you actually kill things, and that generates too much whining.  So what do we as skalds need to be adapted to the way things are currently?<br>
<br>
In my view, mind you I have 95 days played and 1.8 million realm points of experience to draw from, there are 3 possibilities which will actually impact the effectiveness of skalds:<br>
<br>
<br>
1)<br>
<br>
replace parry with evade 4 or 5<br>
<br>
2)<br>
<br>
2.0 and shield spec<br>
<br>
3)<br>
<br>
replace mez / snare / DDs with minstrel cast mez / stun / shorter DDs<br>
<br>
<br>
Personally, I think that 2.0 and shield spec is the most appropriate solution.  This would put us in line with thanes, champions, reavers (haha well not them, but they're overpowered so we shouldn't shoot for that anyway), paladins, basically all the other melee hybrids.  Along with putting us in line with our in-game peers, it would also have various other beneficial aspects:<br>
<br>
First, it would eliminate the fact that currently there are 2 cookie cutter skald variants.  The number of VIABLE alternatives with 2.0 and shield spec is at bare minimum 6.  Second, it would make the possibility of 50 battlesongs a reality ... thus giving mythic more of a reason to put something viable above 46 spec.  Currently there is no reason for them to do anything, as no one specs past 46.  Except me at 47, since I screwed up on my respec.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Also, suddenly a skald gains a ton of group support ability.  Shield spec brings slam, /guard, /engage to the table, all of which are big additions to support.<br>
<br>
For those of you concerned with being overpowered, you need to think about what that means.  Think about what actual overpowered classes do.  Compare skalds with shield spec to savages, and to reavers.  When you're done, you will realize that skalds with 2.0 and shields are solid.  Back to effective, just in a different way than we were a year and a half ago.  Certainly without a 400 damage 1h attack coupled with absorb and damage debuffs, and a pbae interrupt on a six second pulse.  That's just a tad better than our single target interrupts on 20 and 30 second timers, isn't it?<br>
<br>

<br>
while i'm at it:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I am willing to be convinced further, but right now I am not sure that trading weapon spec for parry isn't a valid option for skalds.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
obviously the person responding to the TLs is clueless, as this and numerous other responses in many other reports proves.  parry doesn't do anything.  it's based off dex, we have no dex.  it gives no group support like shield does.  it doesn't do damage to anything, meaning that in 90% of all situations it is useless.  and on top of that, skalds minimal damage output can only be further gimped by wasting points in parry.  there are REASONS that the favorite skald specs, all 2 of them, have 5 parry maximum.  quite frankly i find it highly insulting that he would come in here and claim that parry is in anyway viable.  he clearly doesn't play the game, and especially doesn't play a skald.  but again, finding him to be insulting puts me right in line with 50% of the rest of the classes which he's responded to in an insulting, condesending fashion.<br>
<br>
regarding skalds having more life - that is inappropriate.  my skald buffs to a cap of 2007 with only aug con 1, toughness 1, and 10 con at creation.  skalds having more than that is simply not appropriate.  we are not light tanks.<br>
<br>
regarding dodger - i find this to be infuriating.  skalds have no dex, and no quickness.  most skalds continue to have no quickness after spellcrafting.  skalds aren't given dex/quick spec buffs, as we have no defense to benefit from this.  with no dex and no quickness, dodger will make our currently non-functional evade into a higher level non-functional evade.  on top of that, balancing classes with RAs is NOT where we want to go.  that is a cop out solution.  yet for months people have been randomly pulling this out of their ass saying &quot;here how about this, maybe this would help!&quot;  if you simply stop to think about how it works and what skalds are it is crystal clear that dodger would not do ANYTHING for us.  other than, of course, give mythic an excuse to ignore us for another year.  every time i see this brought up it makes me want to tear out my hair.  DODGER IS NOT THE SOLUTION SO STOP BRINGING IT UP.<br>
<br>
and for the record, here are some nice little stats from palomides over the last 7 days:<br>

in the past, skalds would have had numbers like champions, or paladins.  even on a tiny (and dying) server like ours.  now, we're in line with reavers.  which are admittedly new so have a much smaller player base, but why there aren't more rvring i cannot understand.  i would speculate that on this server, with mainly mids to fight, the albs have little use for the pbae interrupt.  can't interrupt a savage.  the only similar class to ours that is doing worse numbers wise is thanes.  yet on that list, bards minstrels skalds and paladins are &quot;required&quot; rvr group classes.  bards minstrels and paladins have double or more the representation of the other &quot;required&quot; class, the skald.  where are the skalds?<br>
<br>
i know where one of them is.  one of those on the list is my skald, being played by my friend solo, picking off stragglers outside of ligen.<br>
<br>
he likes to tell me how he &quot;owned that solo bard&quot;<br>
<br>
which is an especially fair fight since we have all six relics<br>

I could see them increasing our points to 1.75 per level.  As for Parry, I completely agree with Phleet's assessment of it, but I feel it needs to be redesigned.  It should have styles and it should offer something comparable to Engage and Guard - not identical mind  you, just useful.  2H/Parry should be as viable as 1H/Shield.<br>

With respect to others opinions and whether it would actually make the class better I seriously doudt Mythic would ever add 2.0 and shield spec to the class.  Evade 3 has been stated as to much on a chain wearing class so evade 2 or some kind of magical ability (absorb buff etc) coming from the Battlesongs line seems the best hope for increased defense. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elvana@teamskald>Elvana</A> at: 9/12/03 6:53 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=narg@teamskald>Narg</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Participant</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#ff0000>(9/12/03 10:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=692.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> my 2c</span><hr size=1> Other thing is... if a skald spec's high defence (parry) style damage and weapon damage would be such that a skald will just be ignored.<br>

It would give skalds the option to spec defensively or offensively. No matter what, it would improve skalds defense by giving them more points to put in parry if they choose not to spec shield. It would add utility by giving skalds guard, engage and shield styles. Shield spec fits the viking base class style.<br>
<br>
<br>
 I know thanes feel threatened by skalds getting shield spec. If thats the case then only allow small shield for skalds. Maybe the shield spec line could be accessed only after lvl 30. That would encourage higher parry spec instead of going the shield route.<br>

As a Skald, I would love to get 2.0x spec points and put a ton of points in shield, but I think it's unlikely.<br>
<br>
Skalds are incredibly similar to Thanes.  We have the same HP, we wear the same armor, we're a melee hybrid with a spell-ish spec line.  Thanes get shield spec, medium shield, and 2.0x spec points.<br>
<br>
Clearly Mythic believes that Battlesongs is so much better than Stormcalling that the things Thanes get are needed to offset our advantage. I'm inclined to agree with them. Speed is one of the best utilities in the game.  It doesn't help us kill other players, but it's the primary reason I played a Skald. It can get you a group spot a lot of the time, and even when you're running around alone, faster is better.<br>
<br>
Hopefully some of the other Battlesongs stuff will get adjusted upward -- larger range for Damage Add, quicker refresh for our shouts, and maybe even a higher level damage shout as well.  <br>
<br>
I want Skalds to be as good a class as possible, but I don't see us getting shield spec and more spec points, as much as I'd like it. I think if we keep asking Roseanne for this, we'll just put her credibility at risk.<br>
<br>
I also get the sense that Mythic wants to hear more about the problems we face and fewer proposed solutions. Sometimes they ask for suggestions, but I get the feeling that in general they prefer to come up with the fixes. <p>Gotter Dammerung - 50 skald<br />

There's a (justified) worry that if a skald has the defensive and melee advantages that a thane does, then why would anyone play a thane?  After all a skald is just as good, and has speed to boot.<br>
<br>
If I worked for Mythic that would worry ME, but I take the attitude that this is Mythic's problem, not the player community's.  If they have not managed to make the thane class attractive enough to players then they should address that, but not at the expense of another class.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think we should NOT get shield spec and should get 1.75 spec pts.  Possible specs include 46 weapon, 46 BS, 23 Parry (I think, that's memory, not working out the math), which improves average skald weapon skill and defence without making them a copy of another melee class.  It hardly makes skalds overpowering, and also gives the class more spec options (maybe some will want to be pure melee, with higher weapon, maybe some really will spec parry higher and leave weapon at 44, etc.).<br>
<br>
In other words an improvement, but not going overboard and not changing the essential character of the existing class.  That seems a reasonable, even conservative, concept to me.  Oh well, I don't actually work for Mythic. <p>Clapperoth Liefarg<br>

<br>
So with that, here are my ideas:<br>
<br>
-Keep 1.5 spec points, we're built on this template, and it'll be damn hard to get out of it, my opinion lies in the fact that we need bolstering in what we have and not asking for more spec points.<br>
<br>
-Keep one insta DD shout, reduce the timer to 10 seconds, and ensure it goes high enough in the line to be able to land reliably on the enemy.<br>
<br>
-Replace one of our DD chants with a insta cast Damage over Time (DoT).  20 second duration, 20 second recast timer.  DoTs generally do more damage over their course than direct damage spells, so this will help PvE, and allow us to use hit and run tactics in RvR.<br>
<br>
-Keep the insta-mez spell, modify it's duration based on resists (but not Determination), so that it will last a decent amount of time on the enemy, suggest 40 to 45 second duration on it.<br>
<br>
-Keep the insta cast snare as is.  This lets any skald chase down an enemy without resorting to styles.<br>
<br>
-Change the resist chants to be triple resist, and stackable with shaman/healer buffs, ensuring that the bonus they provide is balanced.  We all know both healers and shaman don't spec high enough in either of their lines to get the best resist buffs, this lets us help the group keep parity with the other realms.<br>
<br>
-Increase the effectiveness of the Damage Add, make it in line with the rune master damage add (11.3 dps?).  If balancing issues arise, have it drain power while in effect.<br>
<br>
-Add in a pulsing PBAE AF-debuff chant (like the reaver).  This will help the group do more damage against the enemy, which I believe is the whole point behind the Skald.<br>
<br>
-Add in a pulsing PBAE DPS-debuff chant so that our enemies will hit our group for less.<br>
<br>
-Add in a self only castable DD Proc for the skald's weapon, this will help the skald's offense without resorting to weapon skill modification.<br>
<br>
-Add in a self only castable reactive proc for the skald that is a short (10-15 seconds?) boost to AF.  This will help with our defense, but requires us to be hit in order to be fired and will not work all the time.<br>
<br>
Yes, not all these changes are new ideas and some have been re-hashed from the SI classes, but this gives two very important things to the Skald:<br>
<br>
1) Choices... skalds now have a choice on what chant to play when the time occurs for combat<br>
<br>
2) Stacking... more than one skald in a group now brings so much more than before, the ability for each skald to play a different chant enhances the group twice as much as opposed to just being melee dps as we stand now.<br>
