<br>
Overview <br>
<br>
Based on the given definition of Skalds, that we are meant to be in the thick of battle, the Skald community has been able to refocus their testing and requests to fit this definition. As it stands now, our damage output is less than it should be given our lower HPs and lower defense abilities. Prior to SC and the armor changes our damage was consistent, but has declined markedly since. If Skalds are about damage, then several things will need to be looked into in order to take us from our Speed-Only role in RvR. <br>
<br>
Feedback<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
Skalds are offensive support, which doesn't necessarily just mean damage, but more that their role is to be in the thick of battle rather then orbiting on the outskirts like a bard for instance. <br>
--------------------------------------<br>
Concerns <br>
<br>
Direct Damage Shouts <br>
I know that per the feedback to the last report, the Skald shout line will be looked into. I just want to reiterate this need. Some means of increasing the actual damage done or the amount of spell failures has to be implemented to make this set of DD shouts more effective. The lowering of the End Costs and Power in prior patches has helped, but it hasn't done enough to make up for the loss of damage due to resists and failures. <br>
<br>
Feedback<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
We are looking into the recast timers and/or resist rates for 1.65. For the resist rates on the shouts, we may look into either adding higher level shouts or doing something with the existing ones so they are not resisted as often. <br>
--------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Damage Adder range and DPS <br>
Given that the Damage Adder was considered the primary in-battle group ability of the Skald, it would stand to reason that it would be a worthy chant. With its 700 range and the pulse dropping bug, it has become less valuable. The Skald DA, at the very least, needs to have the bugs fixed and the range increased to 1500. Another idea to make the Skald chant more effective would be to allow the Skald DAs to stack with each other like they stack with Shaman & Runemaster DA. One chant at full strength and one at 1/2 strength. It would be unique and make better use of multiple Skalds in a group. Similar to Paladin Heal stacking and Warden Bubble stacking. <br>
<br>
Feedback<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
We plan on normalizing the range on all DA chants. We want to stay away from more DA stacking. <br>
--------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Skald Defense <br>
As addressed in the prior report, the situation will be watched, but no changes are imminent. I do think that a review of Skald defense is an issue, because currently, Skalds are using RAs to even out their lack of defense. To have the HP of a Thane with their self buff, for example, Skalds must purchase several levels of the Aug. Con. RA and Toughness RA. That's just to even out the HP difference. To gain more Parry, we must spend points on Aug. Dex. RA and Mastery of Parrying just to have the Parry ability more functional because we lack the spec points to do it otherwise. Balancing via RAs is not a good idea, and makes a Skald spend their points on passive, rather than active abilities. Please consider this when reviewing Skalds. <br>
<br>
Feedback<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
Right now we're not going to focus on skald defense. We might look into where their hit points stand, but even if a change was made here, the difference in hit point tenths between classes would be fairly minor and won't have a big impact on skald survivability. <br>
--------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Group offerings <br>
The other support/melee classes among the realms offer a lot more to the group than the Skald, either within or outside of battle. A single Skald within an RvR group can supply the means to transport the group to battle, which is truly the only thing we excel at. The current perception (and pretty much accurate) is that Skalds bring speed, but not much else. Allowing the DA to stack as noted above would be a positive reason for more than just Speed, as would giving Skalds another group ability or adding a component to a current chant would allow more variety in their group offerings. <br>
<br>
Feedback<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
Speed and a DA are two useful group abilities.(when the DA range is upped) We're not currently exploring other avenues for skald group contribution. <br>
--------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Specline Issues <br>
<br>
Battlesongs- Per the last report, no in-depth changes will be done on this line at this time. I am requesting that the above changes (Stacked DA, new component to existing chant) be considered to allow the line we have no choice in speccing in to have more value. <br>
<br>
Feedback<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
Don't think this is the way to go. Perhaps we should look at this again after 1.65. <br>
--------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Weapon - The concern of the typical Skald spec in weapon to 44 is that there is no return on investment if we take our weapon to 50. We lose more utility/damage if we spec high in weapon than we gain from the higher weapon spec. This seems to be more of an issue with Midgard weapons styles than the Skald itself. <br>
<br>
Feedback<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
Is this something that the style review might address? In other words, do you think this is a style issue or an issue inherent with the skald? <br>
--------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Parry - The only Speccable means of defense for the Skald is relegated to getting the leftover Spec points. A typical Skald will end up with a Parry of 17. Since we need to Spec high in Battlesongs and Weapon just to be competitive, we have to use RAs to balance out this spec. Lowering either Battlesong or Weapon does not return worthy results, even with the current changes to Parry/Block. <br>
<br>
Feedback<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
I am willing to be convinced further, but right now I am not sure that trading weapon spec for parry isn't a valid option for skalds. I do agree that battlesongs is something most will want to keep high. <br>
--------------------------------------<br>
<br>
We would like to also note that an alternative specialization template is gaining popularity: 50 weapon (almost always axe for the 50 style), 43 BS, leftover in parry. This spec line basically throws away most of the benefits of the Battlesong line, with the exception of speed 5 (notably: the "strong" battleshout is effectively destroyed, and the damage add song is a substandard one). However, the fact that some Skalds still decide to go this route to scrape a few more points of weapon damage is a testament to both Skald woes in melee combat and to the poor state of the Battlesong line. I am putting this in again because it was misunderstood. There is very little variance in a Skald spec, because changing it return a less than competitive character. We do need more variety, we don't have that option. <br>
<br>
Feedback<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
We can discuss this further but if people want to get the level 50 style for damage, that's an okay decision to make. Depending on what, if anything, is done with the shouts may also make Battlesong more enticing. <br>
--------------------------------------<br>
<br>
New Issues <br>
<br>
No changes since 1.62 report effected Skalds positively or negatively. <br>
<br>
Other Issues <br>
<br>
-6 single resist chants, why not 3 sets of 2? <br>

Not sure when, but I definitely want to look into doing something about having 6 resist chants.<br>

Once again, it sounds as if the underlying problem we have from Mythic is that they a) have no clear definition of a skald and b) are not in the process of creating such a definition.<br>
<br>
This is a horribly disappointing reply.  As I'm reading it, his/her opinion of skalds is that they should be support oriented, but will gain no more support.  They should be in the thick of battle, but gain no more defence.  If they wish more defence, they should be happy to reduce their weapon spec (!!!!).  <br>
<br>
Our direct damage line will get a review in 1.65.  Great.  Seriously, this is great.  Our damage add range will be increased.  Great.  <br>
<br>
Nothing else, nothing at all.  Sigh.  My depression reading this is that it sounds as if the feedback comes from someone mystified that skalds are talking about melee issues, cocking his head quizzically at styles, spec or defence being brought up at all. <p>Clapperoth Liefarg<br>

<br>
Well, considering the average dex for any skald, parry is a questionable defense. Likewise, if we are about combat support, how can we help in combat if our weapon spec is lower than our parry?<br>
<br>
Im happy they will look into our Shouts and DA, and even the Resist chants, but they dont seem to realize that we, as a base combat class, lack in the basic combat skills. It just seems that we were almost a last thought kind of class, one that was thrown in so the Midgard realm had a speed class that wasnt a caster only.<br>
<br>
Its sad when a healer, 5 levels below you, can win a duel against you, and he isnt even wearing his resist gear or using spellcrafted weaponry... <p>Bays Endruhms<br>

Not a high RR skald with alot of passive/active RA's to make them more competative, but a lower RR skald, RR5 or less.  Let him run around in big boy RVR for a week with a pick up group and see how he fares, or even put him in a well balanced group just to make it obvious that we in no way as Skalds can stand up to the &quot;thick&quot; of battle.  <br>

When I play my shaman, to be quite honest, I usually let the Skald die rather than a real damage dealer so my group has a chance to survive.  It will usually use less power to rez him then it will to try to keep him alive.<br>

<br>
So, level a savage on another account, respec your skald to 46 songs and as high parry as you can get (so he will maybe avoid getting killed with lucky parry here and there), stick him on af, switch between speed and da and that's it. You will never ever need a skald again, in rvr or pve. Class playability? Rofl who cares about a bot class playability. <br>

Hasteners, end regen potions and the zerker TG necklace are a few of the other changes that make skalds less useful for their speed. Why then, would anyone group a skald when they bring so little to a group? &quot; ` Myia RR5 skald<br>
<br>
I think that Mythic has decided to neuter the skald and leave him the choir singing boy that he has become.  The comments by Myia sum it up.  Why would anyone group a skald.  They bring nothing to the table that a more useful Runie, end regen casting shaman, or potions cant cover alone.  That pretty much damns the class to oblivion.  And Mythic better read this.  They already lost my 12.95/mo and I know many of the fine skalds on this board also feel similarly.  They /canceled and it is sound like another mass migration to WoW, SWG, or return to the simple life of D2 (j/k).<br>

Right now we're not going to focus on skald defense. We might look into where their hit points stand, but even if a change was made here, the difference in hit point tenths between classes would be fairly minor and won't have a big impact on skald survivability. <br>

So what they are saying is you have crappy support, crappy defence, and crappy damage output...and you should deal with it.<br>

Sounds like the bard TL report feedback. Sad really.<br>
<br>
Two of the least fun classes to play in RvR are both being told you're fine when it's pretty obvious to everyone that they have gaping problems when comopared to most other classes perrformance.<br>
<br>
They told minstrels they were fine till everyone stopped playing them, and the remaining players spammed them with the minstrel petition.

Of course this might be a load of bull but I for one actually believe it.<br>
It feels that &quot;the skald remake&quot; has been within reach for months now and that with each patch Mythic snatched that carrot from right under our noses. Since they now have some new tools to play with regarding class and realmbalance maybe we are closer than ever?<br>

Than you throw in responses that totally throw out the window the feedback that the class community is giving you.  Such as the the comment about not being convinced that trading weapon skill for parry isn't a valid option.  Huh?  Do you need to interview every skald and have them tell you that parry sucks and isn't a worth trading weapon spec for.  Doesn't the spec (which Rosie mentioned for a reason) 50 wep, 43 bs, 2 parry that's becoming the popular skald spec tell you something about parry?  about the battlesong line?  Lines like your supposed to be in the thick of battle but your not supposed to deal damage is what also frustrates a community.  Did you know that Skalds only have one viable in combat chant?  That's it's low dps, buggy and still probably won't be played even with range increased.   That's what really irks people.<br>
<br>
Unless things are going on behind the scenes that I nobody knows about I'm not to hopeful about skald changes.  So DA range is increased but it's not really improved.  No increase in dps no stacking with other skalds dmg add.  Your group still won't notice weather you put it on or not.  Shout changes sound promising.  I hope they lower the recast timer which I think they'll do and hopefully they'll fix the resist rates on them.  It still leaves a the number 1 problem imo and that's skalds survivability.  I don't think our damage output (which for most is pretty low considering we use a slow 2h wep)  and our support/utility justify our almost 0 defense. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jikkle01>Jikkle01</A> at: 9/5/03 11:44 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#efe0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kjeld>Kjeld</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Team Skald Fervent</span><br>  Posts: 344<br> <font color=#ff0000>(9/7/03 4:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=689.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> bleh</span><hr size=1> Hmm this is a lackluster answer at best. The report was even more carefully worded, but the guy seems to miss the point entirely.<br>
<br>
This sums up everything : the original design document of the skald has been long lost, and no one has a clue about what to do with the class. Sorry to be harsh but RvR is brutal. RvR is 3l33t. RvR is all about maxxed out, spellcrafted characters. RvR is about competing with flavor of the month classes or group compositions. Watered down defense and poopy poor offense works when soloing werewolves, or toying around in the battlegrounds. The RvR is balanced around melee classes spellcrafted to the gills with tons of hps and good defense skill sets soaking the damage of real melee classes with maximized damage outputs. If you can't compete with the big boys  &quot;to be in the thick of battle rather then orbiting on the outskirts&quot; is pointless. It's like removing all range from mages, giving them a zero range single target DD ans say &quot;go, go to the thick of the battle&quot;. It doesn't make them melee classes.<br>
<br>
The answer about the parry skill tells how much he misses the point. He isn't conviced that removing weapon skill points to pump up parry won't help the skald ? Irrelevant. However you balance weapon and parry, you still only have 1.5 spec, poor evade, no shield, poor hps. Even the purely offensive hybrids have at least the luxury to put 2.0 spec points.<br>
<br>
The most ironic thing about the report is that they are upping damage add range ... and maybe they could be convinced to put shout range to 1500 (will be the best thing for skalds in ages if we conviced them to do that),as they didn't close the door on shout reevaluation. Ironically, it will just allow skalds more breathing room to actively avoid melees they are not fit for. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c2a2><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub36.ezboard.com/bteamskald.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xerofury>xerofury</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#ff0000>(9/17/03 10:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub36.ezboard.com/fteamskaldfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=689.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: bleh</span><hr size=1> I think the reason mythic doesnt know what to do with the Skald class is because the Skald class is so similuar to the Thane class.<br>
<br>
People say Skalds need 2.0 spec with med shield but think about that it would be a thane with speed... if skalds have that why make a thane ? minus the AE hammers which is really garbage anyway.<br>
<br>
I believe skalds would be balanced if they had a 2.0 spec, and maybe 1 - 2 things added to the BS line. we need more hps and maybe somthing similuar to the minstrels like a 5 -6 sec insta stun on like a 20 - 30 sec timer. i think that would give us alot of improvment  ( i think skalds should get to use spears so my kobie would own <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     ) <br>
