<p><strong>CC<br>
</strong>Crowd Control, your primary role as an enchanter.&nbsp; Refers to any methods
used to keep mobs from participating in a fight, through mezzing, charming, or even simple
rooting.</p>

<p><strong>Mez/Mezzing<br>
</strong>Using Mesmerize type spells to lock a mob up under a set duration stun that is
broken by damage.</p>

<p><strong>Slow<br>
</strong>Attack slows, the most effective debuffs in the game.</p>

<p><strong>Debuff<br>
</strong>Reducing the combat effectiveness of a mob, through slows, snares, AC drops, etc,
but typically reduces damage output of a mob.</p>

<p><strong>Buff<br>
</strong>Beneficial spells cast onto allies such as haste or mana regen.</p>

<p><strong>Crack<br>
</strong>Common name for mana regen spells, also known as Coffee, C1 (for Clarity) or C2
(Clarity 2)&nbsp; Usually stated &quot;crack me pls&quot; and will become quite annoying.</p>

<p><strong>Haste<br>
</strong>Buff that increases attack delay.&nbsp; Three types which stack:&nbsp; spell
haste (ours), item haste (such as Flowing Black Silk Sash), and song haste (from bards).</p>

<p><strong>TW<br>
</strong>Taiwaneese.&nbsp; Most common ESL on Nameless Server.</p>

<p><strong>ESL<br>
</strong>English Second Language.&nbsp; Players that do not speak English as natives, and
can be a bit difficult to communicate with.</p>

<p><strong>Tic<br>
</strong>6 seconds.&nbsp; The game clock runs spell durations on &quot;tics&quot; which
can be measured by bard song pulses, mana regen jumps, hp recooperation, and your little
blinking eyeball animation.</p>

<p><strong>Attack Tic/Round<br>
</strong>One cycle of the attack timer, measured by the delay of your weapon (divided by
10 is seconds) modified by haste effects.</p>

<p><strong>PB Stun<br>
</strong>Point Blank Stun.&nbsp; Area effect spell centered on caster (who is not
affected).</p>

<p><strong>AoE<br>
</strong>Area of Effect.&nbsp; Spell that covers an area centered on target (can affect
caster) has a 4-5 target limit.</p>

<p><strong>HP Shield<br>
</strong>Buff that stops &quot;x&quot; damage before fading.</p>

<p><strong>DS<br>
</strong>Damage Shield.&nbsp; Buff that does &quot;x&quot; damage to whatever hits the
recipient.</p>

<p><strong>Kamikaze<br>
</strong>Using animation to solo.&nbsp; Animation fights to the death and is
uncommandable... Mr. Kamikaze just seemed like the right name to me.&nbsp; Since my
earlier days of animation solo, I seemed to have coined the phrase &quot;Kamikaze
Solo&quot; now.</p>

<p><strong>Break<br>
</strong>Several meanings.&nbsp; One, to stop a mez effect with damage.&nbsp; &quot;Tank
broke mez&quot;&nbsp; Second is to kill mobs in a staggered order at their spawn point so
they don't all spawn at once.&nbsp; &quot;It was a good break on the Hands room!&quot;
&nbsp; Breaking a room isn't just killing the mobs one at a time so they spawn one at a
time (since they will spawn on a set timer... typically 6 minutes outdoors, 15 to 30
minutes in dungeons) but meaning you're going to have to move into a room with several
mobs, or pull several out of an area all at once--hence the need for an enchanter.
&nbsp; &quot;Cazic Thule Throne Room is a tough break for a 29 enchanter.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Throw<br>
</strong>To cast a spell.&nbsp; I use the word a lot... &quot;Then I throw tash on
it...&quot; and I also coin the word fire a lot.&nbsp; &quot;Fire in a dispel.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>DOT<br>
</strong>Damage Over Time.&nbsp; Does a certain amount of damage each tic, half if the mob
is mobile and not running.&nbsp; Slow source of damage but typically extremely mana
efficient.</p>

<p><strong>MROT<br>
</strong>Mana Regen Over Time.&nbsp; Gives mana back per tic, just like a DOT.</p>

<p><strong>DD/Nuke<br>
</strong>Direct Damage spell.&nbsp; You cast, damage occurs.</p>

<p><strong>Proc<br>
</strong>Process effect.&nbsp; Thusly named from old text-based RPGs that had a file
called &quot;process&quot; files up to run special effects.&nbsp; Procs are any effect
that occurs from an item, either by right clicking the item (like JBoots) or through a
random chance while attacking (like Short Sword of Ykesha).</p>

<p><strong>Reagent<br>
</strong>Spell components needed to cast, like Bat Wing for Levitate or Jasper for Rune
III.</p>

<p><strong>Con<br>
</strong>Consider.&nbsp; A yellow &quot;conning&quot; mob is 1-2 levels above your level
for example.</p>

<p><strong>Mob<br>
</strong>Any non-player character, but typically refers to a creature you fight for xp.
&nbsp; Comes from the old text-based RPGs, where NPC's were stored in .mob files.</p>

<p><strong>Bounce<br>
</strong>To have a spell resist, or be unable to land a spell.&nbsp; &quot;I bounced three
slows before giving up.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Chain-Nuke<br>
</strong>Throwing a secondary, weaker nuke in to fill the recast delay of your primary
nuke.</p>

<p><strong>Aggro/Hate List<br>
</strong>Priority of attacks for an NPC.&nbsp; Rooted mobs &quot;aggro&quot; the closest
player.&nbsp; Damage, heals, debuffs, etc all raise your standing on the &quot;hate
list&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Stunlock<br>
</strong>Chaining multiple stun effects together, rendering the target helpless.</p>

<p><strong>Mem/Memmed<br>
</strong>Devoting a spell slot to a particular spell.&nbsp; &quot;Had to keep Theft of
Thought memmed all the time because of the recast delay...&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Channel/Cast Through<br>
</strong>Regaining your concentration and continuing your spell cast despite the damage
you've taken.&nbsp; The higher your Channeling skill, and the lower level the spell is (in
relation to your level) the more likely you are to channel it.&nbsp; Channelling Root
(level 8) is much easier to channel than Dazzle (level 49).</p>

<p><strong>Mez-Medding<br>
</strong>Maintaining a mez-lock an a mob while meditating back up.&nbsp; After you get
mana regen spells, it's possible to meditate back much more mana that a mez uses, allowing
you to recover mana while the mob is under a mez induced stun.</p>

<p><strong>Tank<br>
</strong>Any melee class, but more specifically, Warriors, Shadow Knights, and
Paladins--all heavy AC classes.</p>

<p><strong>Caster<br>
</strong>Casters who get their mana pool based on Intelligence... Magicians, Necromancers,
Wizards, and Enchanters.</p>

<p><strong>Healer<br>
</strong>Casters who base mana pool on Wisdom (plus they have many heals).&nbsp; Cleric,
Druid, and Shaman.</p>

<p><strong>Papertank<br>
</strong>Tanks that don't exactly stand up to punishment as well as the plate wearing
cousins.&nbsp; Monks, Rogues, and Rangers.&nbsp; All three typically outdamage other
tanks, but trade that offensive power for defensive weakness (comparatively--they don't
melt... just not as hardy as a warrior).</p>

<p><strong>Flight Jockies<br>
</strong>Bards.&nbsp; They run around like helicopter pilots, thinking they can do pretty
much whatever they want and fill every role of the group.&nbsp; Well... they can.&nbsp; A
good bard can do so much... they just have that &quot;Top Gun&quot; Maverick attitude,
which is why I call them jockies.</p>

<p><strong>Darkness<br>
</strong>Necromancer darkness DOT, which includes a movement imparing effect.</p>

<p><strong>Snare<br>
</strong>Druids and rangers get a snare spell that impares movement.</p>

<p><strong>Tash/Tashing<br>
</strong>Lowering the Magic Resistance (MR) of a mob.&nbsp; Unresistable spell (cure
poison can remove) that casts quickly.</p>

<p><strong>PvP/PvE<br>
</strong>Player vs Player / Player vs Environment.&nbsp; PvP servers have spells work
differently, such as AoE spells having a chance to affect your own team, etc.&nbsp; Xornn
is on a PvE server, and as such this is a PvE guide.&nbsp; Dueling is not the realm of
this guide, though I'll leave this advice.&nbsp; Mez, Blind and Nuke are the only weapons
you need, and anyone that raises their MR even half heartedly will own you.</p>

<p><strong>Seek Radius<br>
</strong>Range a mob can tell you are around and will pursue you.&nbsp; If you mez a mob
and leave it's seek radius, it won't come after you unless you get too close again. (Seek
radii are typically very large.)</p>

<p><strong>Nerf<br>
</strong>From time to time, Verant changes the way something in the game works.&nbsp; When
the change is for the worse, it's called &quot;nerfing&quot;&nbsp; Whirl Till You Hurl and
Lull were heavily nerfed spells.</p>

<p><strong>PL/PLing<br>
</strong>PowerLeveling.&nbsp; Helping someone to kill mobs WAY too powerful for them in
order to level them faster.&nbsp; With low levels, easily accomplished with DS and heals
(or HP Shields), and at higher level with memory blurs to wipe the damage list.</p>

<p><strong>Blur/Blurred<br>
</strong>To clear the hate list.&nbsp; A blurred mob is one that has successfully been
wiped, clearing it's hate list off.</p>

<p><strong>Tank-Mezzing<br>
</strong>Used on unmezzable mobs often in planes.&nbsp; A tank fights the mob solo while a
healer keeps them alive.&nbsp; They have no aspirations of killing the mob, just keeping
it hitting them while another mob is killed.</p>

<p><strong>Add<br>
</strong>Called out when additional mobs add to a battle.&nbsp; Tanks have a
responsibility to call them out as the enchanter is often extremely occupied with
targetting, memming spells, and casting during battle.&nbsp; &quot;add&quot; called out in
group alerts the enchanter to get it under control.</p>

<p><strong>Rootparking<br>
</strong>Casting immobilization spells (Root, etc) on a mob and getting away from it,
leaving it unable to harm anyone.&nbsp; Used commonly by shamans and wizards, but also by
enchanters trying to crowd control a giant.
