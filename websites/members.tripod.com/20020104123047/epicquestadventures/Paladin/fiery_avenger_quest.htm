<p align="center"><font size="6" face="Verdana"><b>Fiery Avenger Quest</B></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>This is now a sub-quest for the
Fiery Defender Quest.&nbsp; This quest starts in Plane of Air but it is advised
that you get all the items needed before you go to the quest giver.</B></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The first two items you will
need are the Ghoulbane and the <a href="http://members.tripod.com/epicquestadventures/Paladin/soulfire_quest.htm">Soulfire</a>.&nbsp;
The Ghoulbane is dropped from the Froglok Shin Lord.&nbsp; This froglok is
located in Upper Guk.&nbsp; He is level 30 and can be killed with a
well-balanced full group of high 20s.&nbsp; The Ghoulbane is a rare drop so you
might have to kill him a few times before you get it.&nbsp; The <a href="http://members.tripod.com/epicquestadventures/Paladin/soulfire_quest.htm">Soulfire</a>
is gotten through the separate Zimel's Blade quest.</B></font></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now comes the hard part.&nbsp;
You have to recreate the Book of Scale.&nbsp; There are two parts of the book,
the torn, burnt book and the book of frost.&nbsp; The &quot;torn, burnt
book&quot; is dropped by Nagafen (Level 53 in Nagafen's Lair), Faydedar (Level
60 in Timorous Deep), Talendor (Level 60 in Skyfire Mountains), and
Severilous (Level 60 in Emerald Jungle.)&nbsp; The Book of Frost is dropped from
Lady Vox (Level 53 in Permafrost), Faydedar (Level 60 in Timorous Deep), and
Gorenaire (Level 60 in Dreadlands.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></B></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Takes the two parts of the Book
of Scale to the bartender at Blind Fish Tavern in Neriak.&nbsp; You must have
high enough faction to do this part of the quest.&nbsp; You can figure out that
you have high enough faction when the bartender responds to your hails.&nbsp;
Give the the two parts of the Book of Scale and 1000pp to the bartender and she
will give you the Book of Scale.</font></B></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">There is now a new way of
getting the book!&nbsp; You still must retrieve the burn book and the book of
frost from the dragons, but instead of having to get that Neriak Faction up, you
can give the books plus 1000pp to the human NPC, Rineval Talyas in North Qeynos.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></B></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now take the Book of Scale to
the Oracle in Ocean of Tears.&nbsp; The oracle is located directly straight out
from the docks at the Sister Isle.&nbsp; He and his guardian should be
indifferent to you unless you have killed him many times.&nbsp; Give the Book of
Scale to the Oracle and you will receive Miragul's Phylactery.&nbsp; Take the
Phylactery to the Everfrost Ice Caves.&nbsp; Here you will find the Lich of
Miragul roaming around.&nbsp; He is level 45 and aggressive to everyone so have
an enchanter come along to mesmerize him.&nbsp; Once mesmerized, give the Lich
the Phylactery.&nbsp; This will cause Miragul himself to spawn.&nbsp; Miragul is
a very hard necromancer.&nbsp; It would be best to take as many people as you
can.&nbsp; Around 3 groups of level 45-60 would be ideal.&nbsp; Get him to spawn
and then attack him.&nbsp; It takes a while to kill him because of his 300-400
lifetap spell.&nbsp; It's better to be safe than sorry because he does despawn
and if he does do that, you must do the entire Book of Scale part of the quest
over again.&nbsp; Miragul will drop Miragul's Head and Miragul's Robe.&nbsp;
These items drop every time.</font></B></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now you have all four items
needed.&nbsp; Take yourself and the items to Plane of Air and wait on the fourth
island aka the Pegasus Isle.&nbsp; Have a friend give Dirkog Steelhand, who is
in the quest room, 500 platinum.&nbsp; This will cause Inte Akera to
spawn.&nbsp; Give Inte the Soulfire and he will give you your first Blessing of
Nobility.&nbsp; Then give him the Ghoulbane for your second Blessing of
Sacrifice, and then give him both blessings and Miragul's Head and Miragul's
Robe for the Fiery Avenger.&nbsp; You must have good faction with Inte Akera who
is a Deepwater Knight.</font></B></p>
