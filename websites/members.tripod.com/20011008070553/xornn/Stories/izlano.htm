<p><em>The Runaway Animation<br>
December 21, 1999</em></p>
<font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">

<p></font><font size="3">Upon reaching the fifteenth rank I found myself hard pressed to
find a place where the denizens were challenging but not overwhelming, but since I
typically keep to myself I was finding it very difficult to find one. I went to North
Karana, Befallen, Lavastorm, and others, each of which was good, but not good enough since
I would either require a party to assist me, or would be swarmed, or both. </p>

<p>I then found the Oasis and finished my work towards the sixteenth rank (which seemed to
take an eternity). I thought highly of this place as, although dangerous in areas, I found
that I could compentently adminsiter my skills without too much difficulty. </p>

<p>With my newly acquired spells of the sixteenth rank I accompanied a collegue of mine on
a trip to Oggok (which didn't go as well as planned). After his business there was cut
short, I suggested we go to Upper Guk to see what it was like. He agreed and little stood
in our way through Innothule with the exception of a poor human paladin that attacked me,
being fooled by my dark elf illusion which I keep up for the vision. Poor fellow indeed.
Upon reaching Guk, my companion jokingly asked &quot;I wonder how long we will last in
there&quot;. I laughed, reassured him that since the guards out front were green to both
of us (myself an enchanter at the rank of sixteen, and he a mage at fourteen) we should be
allright inside, and so we went in. </p>

<p>There were froglok bodies everywhere. It seemed as though someone had cleared the place
out, so we looted a few of the corpses with the hopes that more frogloks would come, and
they did. All we found were weak compared to us, so I practised my new spells and we
defeated all with ease. A few actually gave us some needed experience with our abilities,
but mostly it was the same old thing we'd come to expect from such inferior creatures,
including the running. </p>

<p>One of the sentries, not particularly interested in fighting us, ran away quickly, my
animation in tow. Worried that the anumation may attract more denizens I followed. He had
attracted a single priest which didn't seem to tough, but tougher than the rest, so I
helped the animation to kill it, using the vast majority of my mana. This creature, too,
ran, just before dying and I thought little about it... that is until the warriors swarmed
in. </p>

<p>All around me were frogloks, obviously miffed at my presence in their homeland, and I
had no choice but to run. I ran across the rickety bridge that had lead me here in an
attempt to get closer to my companion who was meditating but instead lost my footing and
fell. Luckily I didn't fall into the water but instead landed on the ledge next to the
opening. Unfortunately it was too late... I cast colour flux to try to buy me time, but I
could not manage to get close enough to the opening. I pondered falling into the water to
evade these creatures, but before I could act my vision failed me, and I found myself
outside their lair. </p>

<p>My companion, upon witnessing my fall, sent his pet in and gated out, the air elemental
giving him the opportunity that I didn't have. We met back in front of Guk, and my only
words were &quot;Ok. So I won't bring a pet next time.&quot; </p>

<p>It is back to the Oasis for me, for a time. I must learn to use my abilities better
before I commit them to a place such as Guk.</font></p>
