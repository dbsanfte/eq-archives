circles lain down.</p>

<p><b>Tuesday,
February 12, 2002 - </B>Could I take longer breaks?&nbsp; Probably not.&nbsp;
There have been many small updates and fixes here and there in the site, just
nothing I felt inclined to post about.&nbsp; Today I put up the 18th Circle (56)
and went through to add in spells from Luclin's release.&nbsp; I have received
an overwhelming amount of e-mail over the holidays about the site, and it's
really been an honor to serve everyone with what I know about enchanting.&nbsp;
Here's a secret--the feedback is what has kept this site going for 2 whole
years.</p>

<p><strong>Wednesday, November 14, 2001 - </strong>17th Circle (55) is almost finished, I
just hit 56th level today so I've been kind of busy running around buying spells and
talking to a recruiting guild.</p>

<p><strong>Wednesday, November 7, 2001 - </strong>16th Circle (54) completed, beginning
work on 17th Circle, changed Tradeskills to Research for now, as I just don't have time to
get into Jeweling that much.</p>

<p><strong>Wednesday, October 31, 2001 - </strong>Added this news page so people can
actually see if something new has been posted.&nbsp; Finished the 15th Circle (53) and
began work on the 16th Circle.</p>

give a special thanks to Taeinea T'Pau (server unknown) for not only teaching me the
basics of enchanting, but inspiring me to create this guide and pass on my knowledge, also
Aaldin Dbrain of the Prexus server, who finally was able to get me to dust off the charm
spells and realize their full potential, and lastly to the members of the Caster's Realm
Enchanter Boards, where some of the best discussions of tactics and enchantment ever take
place.</h5>
