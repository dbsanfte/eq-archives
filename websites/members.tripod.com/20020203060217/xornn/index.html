<p align="center"><em>Welome to Xornn's Guide to Enchanting.&nbsp; Within this site I have
undertaken the task of providing you with one simple thing--everything I know about
Enchanting, and the best advice I can give to you on becoming a truly great enchanter.
&nbsp; This guide is always under construction, and I doubt I will ever finish it.&nbsp; I
have however added a news page so you can check if anything has changed since your last
visit.&nbsp; Please take a look around and feel free to e-mail me your thoughts and
questions, or also available is <a

Enchanter</a> board, where you can meet the whole enchanter community.&nbsp; (My posting
handle is Eugee.)</em></p>
