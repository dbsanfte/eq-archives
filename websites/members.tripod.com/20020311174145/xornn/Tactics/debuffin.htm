<p><em>&quot;Attack that one.&quot;&nbsp; Xornn pointed at an aviak passing by them.</em></p>

<p><em>Jakonis stripped away the birdman's resistance as it rushed him, and quickly his
enchanted animation was meleeing it.&nbsp; A blue glow swirled about the creature for a
moment and it's attacks became sluggish and predictable.&nbsp; Soon after the creature was
dead, and the apprentice's animation was in well-enough condition.&nbsp; He was beaming
with pride as he returned to his masters side, but quickly calmed his features as he stood
before Xornn.</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Why didn't you mesmerize it first?&quot; Xornn demanded.</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;There was no need, it's wasted mana for one spell the animation will be just
fine through,&quot; he answered calmly.</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Why an attack slow, why not our impressive arsenal of strength
debilitation?&quot; Xornn scolded.</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;While I could reduce the birdthing to a weakened shell of itself, it would
still be a hard fight for the animation; my attack slow gave my pet the best edge my mana
could afford me,&quot; Jakonis was thinking the words as he spoke, rather than quoting his
Master, and continued to answer Xornn's next question as well, &quot;there's no need for
further effects after the slow, it's all that was needed, and more is wasted mana.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>Xornn hid a smile badly.&nbsp; &quot;Nonsense!&nbsp; If you wish to afford your
animation the best edge, your powers of color stuns should have been used!&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>Jakonis smiled.&nbsp; Not a happy, young man's smile, but a darker, knowing smile
of someone in control of his world.&nbsp; &quot;Master, I couldn't let the animation have
all the fun, could I?&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>Xornn looked long and determined at his smiling apprentice, and his own cracking
smile faded slowly.&nbsp; Jakonis in turn began to look confused, wondering if he had
overstepped his bounds.&nbsp; &quot;That is all, Jakonis, I am finished.&quot;&nbsp; The
young enchanter looked shocked for a moment--Xornn had never called him anything but
apprentice, ever.&nbsp; Xornn suddenly reached out and clasped Jakonis by the arm and
hugged him.&nbsp; &quot;I've no more to teach you, brother.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>With that, he released his embrace and teleported--to wherever it is Xornn goes
when he's alone.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>I've talked at length about the merits of various debuffs in the spell lines, and they
will see specific mention in the Circles, but here, there is little to say. &nbsp;
Debuffing is one of the lowest priorities for an enchanter, and crowd control is the
ultimate debuffing already. 

<ul>
  <li>MR Debuff</li>
  <li>Attack Slow</li>
  <li>Stunlocking</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the three buffs worth casting in most situations, and a good enchanter will
find the mana to use them in a group.&nbsp; While other debuffs have their places, those
times are exceptions to be discovered, not spent in long discourse on this site.&nbsp; If
you've been following this guide in order, then you're ready now.&nbsp; There's nothing
else I'm going to tell you now that will change how an enchanter is mastered.&nbsp; The
Circles will contain specific information about spells available, advice on Tactics at
those levels, and other details not done justice by general description here in these
Tactics.&nbsp; Quests and Tradeskills will have nothing to do with leveling, added for the
sake of convenience and tips.&nbsp; Lastly is the Stories, which I invite you to submit to
when you have tales of your own to regale.</p>
