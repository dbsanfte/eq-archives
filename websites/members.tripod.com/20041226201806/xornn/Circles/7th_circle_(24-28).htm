<p><em>The high elf standing beside him was eerie; quiet, reclusive, and competent. &nbsp;
He rarely spoke, and when he did it was only quick mentions of facts that Loraax was quite
aware of, but could not find reason to tell the enchanter he shouldn't say it. &nbsp; The
halfling warrior pulled a bit of gummy muck from his blonde beard, and felt a hastening
magic envelop his reactions and muscles, and the world around him seemed to move in slow
motion suddenly.&nbsp; In long, overdrawn syllables, Xornn sat back down and said,
&quot;The fighters are hasted.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>Loraax shook his head with a sigh as the barbarian next to him concurred with the
enchanter.&nbsp; Master of the obvious.&nbsp; Then his attention was drawn by his true
calling, gnolls emerging from the cave entrance, deep in the plains of South Karana!
&nbsp; &quot;More gnolls to die by Rallos's fury!&quot; he screamed as the halfling
through a dagger across the grassy terrain.&nbsp; The blade missed, but drew the attention
of the doggish patrolmen who came charging.&nbsp; Before they reached them, one of the two
stopped dead in his tracks as bluish energy ensorcelled him.&nbsp; The other kept
charging, only to meet the sweeping pass of Loraax's mighty velium blade as it howled out
in pain.&nbsp; &quot;You should have run, dog...&quot; taunted the halfling, as Xornn
dropped the beast's movements to a crawling pace that Loraax found quite unsporting.</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Slowed, and the other is mezzed,&quot; reported the koada'dal, sitting back
down by his tree.</em></p>

<p><em>Master of the obvious, but at least competent.</em></p>

<hr>
<font face="arial, helvetica">

<p></font>Welcome, Disciples, to the Seventh Circle.&nbsp; I'll waste no time with social
bantery.&nbsp; You're here to see the spell upgrades I spoke of--behold:</p>

<p><strong>Alacrity - </strong><em>Upgrade to Quicken, capping at 40% by 36th. 115 mana
for up to an 11 minute duration.&nbsp; The mana cost may look disturbing, but the sheer
number of attacks this grants makes it all worth it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even at level 24th, your
pet (taking 2 swings every &quot;tic&quot; and kicking and bashing constantly) goes from
40 attacks to 50 attacks.&nbsp; Hitting for an average of 13 an attack, that's 130 damage
per minute of combat, that will last two or three fights.</em></p>

<p><strong>Beguile - </strong><em>Upgrade to Charm.&nbsp; Max level able to charm now is
35.&nbsp; Casting time of 3.5 seconds; Color Shift will be required to stun for recharming
now.</em></p>

<p><strong>Chaos Flux - </strong><em>Upgrade to Sanity Warp, 143 damage at 24th, capping
at 150 by 28th.&nbsp;&nbsp; 100 mana cost, 3.5 second casting time, and that horrid 8
second recast delay still.&nbsp; Compared to other Seventh Circle nukers, Enchanters are
beginning to fall behind in the mana:damage ratio still, but especially in the
damage:second department, as casting this spell repeatedly yields another 150 point bomb
11.5 seconds after the first lands.</em></p>

<p><strong>Enchant: Gold - </strong><em>Turn a gold bar into an enchanted one for
Jewelcrafting.</em></p>

<p><strong>Illusion: Earth Elemental - </strong><em>Raises your STR 10 and makes you Kill
on Sight to most guards (all elemental forms do).&nbsp; Also makes you Dubious in many
places, such as Runnyeye (not to the Evil Eyes, however). </em></p>

<p><strong>Illusion: Skeleton - </strong><em>Turns you into a skeleton (doesn't show your
name) and you have no special vision.&nbsp; Faction changes with </em>some<em> undead, and
you can walk around Befallen safely, nearly all mobs will be non-aggro.</em></p>

<p><strong>Invigor - </strong><em>Stamina regen, short duration.&nbsp; If you are
partnered with a tank, actually keep this spell memmed to renew their staminar bar during
long fights.&nbsp; Research spell with Velishoul's Tome pages 16 (faded) and 17, or obtain
from Cleric guild.</em></p>

<p><strong>Major Shielding - </strong><em>Upgrade to our self-only buff.&nbsp; +75HP,
+18AC, +14MR at 28th.&nbsp; 80 mana for a 45 minute duration.&nbsp; Keep on at all times.</em></p>

<p><strong>Rune II - </strong><em>Upgrade to Rune I, obviously, targetted HP buffer, stops
up to 71 damage at 24th, capping at 118 damage by 30th.&nbsp; Needs a 5 gold Bloodstone
for component, only use occasionally when buffing newbies, or dropping on the puller.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 gold becomes pretty trivial fast, and this spell will see a little use, but
not much.&nbsp; If you have a healer for the puller, don't bother.&nbsp; However, in solo
situations I often keep this spell buffed, as mana for a rune comes back a lot faster than
HP.</em></p>

<p><strong>Sagar's Animation - </strong><em>Upgrade to our animation, a scimitar and
shield now.&nbsp; You're back to using only 1 Tiny Dagger, and during my testing I saw
maximum damages of 16 to 26.&nbsp; Each pet spell rank, the lowest and highest max damage
typically increase by 2.&nbsp; This animation will Bash, Kick, and Double Attack almost
every round.&nbsp; Truly amazing damage machine now.</em></p>

<p><strong>Strip Enchantment - </strong><em>Upgrade to Cancel Magic.&nbsp; Very powerful
spell.&nbsp; Strips up to 4 buffs off your target, either a mob or group member.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Useful when fighting mobs with damage shields, or removing Charm from
one of your party members.&nbsp; Sometimes requires multiple castings.&nbsp; In PvP, lead
off with this spell to kill SoW and most other buffs anyone will have.&nbsp; This will
remove mezzes, so be careful with it.&nbsp; (Research spell with Tasarins Grimoire Page
390 left &amp; right.)</em></p>

<p><strong>Tepid Deeds - </strong><em>Upgrade to Languid Pace.&nbsp; Cuts mob attack speed
by 32% at level 24, capping at 50% by 60th.&nbsp; However, you receive the next upgrade at
44th, so at 43rd this spell is increasing the attack delay of the mob by 42%.&nbsp; Doing
a 38% slow debuff means that a mob swinging 40 times a minute will swing14 times now on a
4.14 second attack delay.&nbsp; Casting between swings becomes child's play, your pet
lasts much longer soloing, and the damage tanks take is drastically reduced, while you
calmly meditate in preperation for renewing Alacrity.&nbsp; Research spell with Velishouls
Tome pages 8 &amp; 9.</em></p>

<hr align="center">

<p>Taking a look back, you might notice something about these spells:&nbsp; Eight of the
twelve new spells are not only upgrades, but upgrades to spells we use commonly.&nbsp; The
Seventh Circle is an awesome transition.</p>

<p><strong>Buffing-Solo - </strong><em>You should have Breeze/Sympathetic Aura/Cloud/Major
Shielding (Strengthen optional), and Mr. Kamikaze should have Strengthen/Cloud/Alacrity.</em></p>

<p><strong>Buffing-Group - </strong><em>You need Breeze/Sympathetic Aura/Major Shielding,
Breeze on all casters, and Strengthen/Cloud passed out to tanks that need it.&nbsp; You
should have some really good CHA gear by now, and if not start getting it.&nbsp; Crowd
Control, Stun-Locking, and even Chase the Moon are CHA based, and Beguile is going to
start seeing some group usage by now if you haven't started already.</em></p>

<hr align="center">

<p><strong>Kamikaze-Solo - </strong><em>I'm going to lump Kamikaze-Root and Kamikaze-Stun
into one group now, since the only difference is whether to stun-root-nuke or
stun-stun-nuke.&nbsp; I prefer the latter to keep my pet healthy and keep me occupied
during the recast delay on our nuke at this rank, but as mobs begin hitting harder and
harder I started moving back to rooting later on.&nbsp; Tashani to pull, Tepid Deeds
replaces Languid Pace if you're Root-Nuking, and Chaos Flux replaces Sanity Warp.&nbsp; At
this point, you will be using the same spells I use in the Eighth Circle.&nbsp; If for
some reason my pet should die and I want out of the fight, I mez, sit down and memorize
Memory Blur.&nbsp; When using Kamikaze-Stun, I keep Alacrity here, and swap it out for
buffing.&nbsp; When I'm fighting a mob that can't be stunned, Color Shift is replaced with
Tepid Deeds and I switch to Kamikaze-Root.&nbsp; (I always have Color Flux memmed,
however, in case something else attacks me.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, I began combining them
slightly, by dropping Tashani to pull, Flux/Shift/Root, then Flux/Shift/Nuke repeatedly.
&nbsp; The reason for this is that I can leave my pet closer to the mob than myself, and
the mob swings at my pet during the gap in the lock rather than me.&nbsp; This helps keep
a fast-swinging mob from breaking out of the stun-lock as easily, and also makes switching
to Root-Kamikaze very easy.&nbsp; Spell Lineup:&nbsp; Choas Flux, Sanity Warp/Choke/Color
Shift, Color Flux, Root, Enthrall, Tepid Deeds, Tashani, Swap Slot</em></p>

<hr>

<p>A Word (or 319 words) on Chain-Nuking</p>

<p>From level 16 on, the enchanter has a primary nuke (Sanity Warp) as well as a secondary
&quot;fall-back&quot; nuke (Chaotic Feedback) which have some applications.&nbsp; First,
and most obvious, is a &quot;finisher&quot; nuke when the mob is <em>almost</em> dead, but
just won't quite die.&nbsp; Rather than firing off a full-strength blast, it is often more
advantageous to just fire in a downgrade nuke to take that last little sliver of health
out.</p>

<p>The second use is for a &quot;filler&quot; effect between recast delays.&nbsp; Example:
&nbsp;&nbsp; At 24th, you have Chaos Flux and Sanity Warp available for chain-nuking.
&nbsp; You are out for a lovely day of Kamikaze-Solo.&nbsp; You spot a lion that you feel
needs killed, and drop into battle mode.&nbsp; Tashan pull, Mr. Kamikaze step in, Languid
Pace, and you chuck in a Chaos Flux.&nbsp; As the lion rushes you a quick Root and you
step back.&nbsp; Another Chaos Flux cascades into the lion, and you're sitting there
waiting for that horrid 8 second recast delay to cycle.&nbsp; Meanwhile you hear some
sickening crunching noises coming from the direction of your pet, who is doing its best to
show off it's lack of defensive tactics.&nbsp; (Probably been watching its master's melee
tactic--take it on the chin.)</p>

<p>Casting a Sanity Warp during the recast allows you to do some positive damage,
shortening the fight, and keeping your pet alive.&nbsp; Now at level 20 to 33, this will
not be needed often, mainly because Color Flux, Color Shift and Chaos Flux are a perfect
match, as the pet not getting hit is great.&nbsp; However, by the time you hit 34th, Color
Shift is really hard pressed to cover Anarchy's casting time, so you almost have to switch
to Root-Nuke style of play, and at that point you will be very thankful for having
knowledge of how to chain nuke.</p>

<p>As always, I leave it to my students to recognize the proper time to chain-nuke.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Reverse-Kite-Partner - </strong><em>Chaos Flux replaces Sanity Warp, and you
should keep Alacrity on your pet.&nbsp; Outside of that there is no real change to this
technique.&nbsp; Spell Lineup:&nbsp; Chaos Flux, Choke, Color Flux, Root, Enthrall, Chase
the Moon, Tashani, Swap Slot.</em></p>

<p><strong>Charm-Solo - </strong><em>Beguile just allows you to charm bigger and badder
mobs now.&nbsp; Color Shift is needed over Color Flux (since Flux doesn't give enough time
to re-charm the mob).&nbsp; Chaos Flux replaces Sanity Warp, but other than that it's the
same tactics as the first.&nbsp; The great thing about Charm-Solo is that it's the same
method at level 12 as it is at 44th level.&nbsp; Spell Lineup:&nbsp; Chaos Flux, Color
Shift, Color Flux, Root, Enthrall/Mesmerize, Tepid Deeds, Tashani, Swap Slot (Because you
won't be very good at channeling Color Shift yet, it's recommended to put Beguile either
in the Chaos Flux or Swap (ususally latter) slot, so you can lead with Color Flux for the
recharm.).</em></p>

<p><strong>Group-Tactics - </strong><em>Your role in groups is clearly defined at this
point.&nbsp; After the buffing guidelines above, you have two real jobs:&nbsp; First, you
must do crowd control, of course.&nbsp; Then you either Tashani/Tepid Deeds (which has an </em>amazing<em>
impact on the fight), or if a single mob stun-lock when mana is surplused.&nbsp; Tepid
Deeds uses 100 mana, while stun-locking for two &quot;rounds&quot; uses 120 mana.&nbsp; It
is unlikely the stun-locking will go past two rounds (the mob will die by then) and the
tanks will have taken practically </em>no<em> damage.&nbsp; Spell Lineup: &nbsp;
Mesmerization, Color Shift or Beguile), Color Flux, Root, Enthrall, Tepid Deeds, Tashani,
Swap Slot (Beguile)</em></p>

<hr align="center">

<p>You've probably noticed that these Circles have become short and sweet facts and
recommendations, as opposed to long and drawn out explanations from earlier.&nbsp; The
reason for this is because you've now been shown basically every tool the enchanter has
from the Sixth Circle on.&nbsp; Now I'm just pointing out the upgrades to those tools and
letting you know which are good, and which are lemons.</p>

<p>You are only five levels from Clarity.&nbsp; Go seek knowledge and experience, young
master.&nbsp; I await you in the Eighth Circle...</p>
