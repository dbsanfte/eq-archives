<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Tread softly in the halls of House Azuviir, for
danger may await at every corner. This house only accepts the few dark
elf that wish to study and follow the path of the warrior and rogue into
their ranks. This house is devoted to role-playing dark elves as assassins
and merciless warriors. We shall strive to make known as a role-playing
group and not a group devoted to gaining wealth and power in the world
we call Norrath, nor are we crazed lunatics devoted to taking over the
world of Norrath. Hopefully we shall find dark elves that will further
aid our cause and make the dark elven race...a great race.<br><br>
<b>
We are, of course, proudly established on the role-playing server, Fennin Ro.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">Role-Playing:</FONT></B>

<P>This house will be strick role-playing, but new role-players are always
welcomed. Out of character talk (OOC) should only happen if you really
need to speak OOC, otherwise do not talk OOC. Talk of stats and any other
numbers in general will be greatly frowned upon and I will drop you from
the guild.

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3">Role-playing a
Dark Elf doesn't mean you have to be a pure evil being that kills
everything in sight. No, that is just a stereotype... Dark Elves
have are good in their own culture, but because of their beliefs
they are seen as this. Of course there are evil and good Dark
Elves, but to an outsider they are seen as evil. They have been
cast away from their Elven cousins because of their beliefs and
it seems that all races, other then the Troll and Ogres, hate
them. A Dark Elf is a noble race though, even if dedicated to so
called &quot;evil&quot; gods and thier militaristic ways. They
have some of the best clothes, armor, and weapons in all of
Norrath and their grasp on the magical arts is overwelming. They
have Ultravision as well, aquired from centuries living in the
underground city of Neriak, this allows Dark Elves to see in the
night. This is a plus for we can see our enemies with out them
seeing our torches.</font>

<P>If you are having some trouble or don't really have an idea of what
role-playing is, I suggest you visit <A HREF="http://www.norrathrp.com/rr/rr_guld/rog.html">this</A>
site, it will help you out very much.

<p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3"><strong>Houses:</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3">Dark Elves are a
very proud in nature, their heritage and House names being very
important in determining a station in life to them. Dark Elves
generally show respect only for other Houses with names
recognized as being notable. Each Drow in a House will take the
surname of the Houses that the Drow is affiliated with.<br>
<br>
At times, these Houses have been known to unite against common
enemies, and are very effective fighting as a unit. When this
happens, there is a negotiation period that is attended by each
Houses military and political leaders in the consortium. These
families meet and work the details of the alliance. It is not
uncommon to see the allied Houses forces mixed together down to
basic squad when battles are joined. It would be considered,
however, a complete travesty to break an alliance before the
agreed upon goals have been met, or without mutual agreement as
doing so would cost the disloyal House complete loss of name and
respect.<br>
<br>
If a member of a House fails his or her House, that member may
either be publicly executed, or cast out with the loss of the
House surname. Those who are extradited are never spoken of
again, and if it is found out that they have tried to make
contact with their House will generally be hunted down and
killed. It is highly unusual that any Dark Elven House would
accept any former member of any other House into their ranks.
Furthermore, it would be unheard of that an exorcised member
would be permitted to come back into the House as anything but a
slave, and even that only rarely.</font><font color="#FFFFFF"

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">House Funds:</FONT></B>

<P>Members are expected to donate a portion of their money to the house.
These funds will buy weapons, armor, and other things for the house when
it is needed. If we aquire enough money we will be purchasing a building
for our Noble House. In this building we will conduct various meetings,
store excess food and equipment and it will act as a safehaven for members.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">Raising In Rank:</FONT></B>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Members may challenge other members that are of
a higher rank than them, but only once every moth or two months. If the
challenger wins, then he/she will take the higher title and the loser will
take the lower title. There will be certain times when house Azuviir gathers
just for the reason of members challenging each other for higher rank.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">Player Killing:</FONT></B>

<P>In no way is role-playing randomly killing innocents. You may kill other
role-players, but it must be in a role-playing sense and not just random.
