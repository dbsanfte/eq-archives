First off, know this: if you took part in any raids on the Plane of Growth, kiss
the epic goodbye. Your faction will be toast to everyone who should be your
allies. You can walk through <span class="SpellE">PoG</span> totally unmolested
and even get a quest for a great chest armor piece, but never, EVER, kill
anything up there or be a part of a group that does.<o:p>

<span class="SpellE">Darkforest</span> (Level 55) in Burning Woods.&nbsp; He's
hidden in a grove of thick trees near to the <span class="SpellE">Skyfire</span>
zone and has been spotted at 3234, 2871.&nbsp; Use tracking to find <span class="GramE">him,</span>
and <span class="SpellE">invis</span> to get through the zone unmolested. Ask
him &quot;what action&quot; and he will give you a note. If he doesn't, then
your faction is too low. Faction can be built up fast by doing the muffin quest

She spawns around 1500,500, or south-west of the <span class="SpellE">Crushbone</span>

kill every pawn you see to make her spawn. Once she spawns, you better be <span class="GramE">SoWed</span>,

other dark elves in this zone. Give him the ring and he gives you a dark metal

-1500, -1000.&nbsp; The Corrupter will <span class="SpellE">depop</span> after
10 seconds if not attacked and the <span class="SpellE">Reavers</span> will
attack and kill all of the druids you just dealt with, so have a small army

Corrupted because his Enduring Breath spell wore off, so that’s a good reason
to pull up top. They have some powerful spells and can dish out a serious

Barracuda, until the Tainted spawns. Placeholders are on a 10 minute timer and
this will consume many boring hours. You can determine if the Tainted Barracuda
will spawn the Corrupted very easily. Exit the water. If it follows you onto
land, that Tainted WILL spawn the Corrupted. If it doesn't follow you, it won't
spawn the Corrupted, but you still have to kill it anyway. The Tainted that
comes on land is significantly tougher than the other barracudas and you will
need help, like a <span class="SpellE">necro</span> to fear kite. <o:p>

don't be fooled. He is level 60 and hits rapidly <span class="GramE">for 250

You really need an entire guild to take this bad boy out.&nbsp; He spawns in a
secret little oasis.&nbsp; Look at a <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/timorousdeepmap.html"><span style="COLOR: #bb3d2f">map</span></a>
