  <p>After Nexors first attempt at claiming the SoulFire was thwarted, Nexor vowed to return and finish the Quest that he began so long ago. Many Guildmates and friends gathered to help in the emminent Death of Sir Lucan. While our forces gathered near the wall, we sent in a Spy to find and guide the Paladin out of his den and to our waiting Forces. Dashka was successful at leading the Paladin out of the Hall and into the open. Nexor immediately engaged Sir Lucan in Battle.</p>

  <p>The fight raged on as we all used our talents to bring Sir Lucan to his knees.</p>

<p> A few more heated moments of Battle, and Sir Lucan breathes his last breath.....</p>
