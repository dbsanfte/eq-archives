it you want! Can't you see I am gathering reagents for my [master]? If I don't
get them for him quickly he might punish me.&nbsp;</b></font></p>

master?'&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Venenzi Oberzendi says 'You do
not know of my teacher? The great Kazen Fe'cae! I am one of his illustrious
apprentices! If you fancy yourself a necromancer, travel to Lake Rathetear and
tell Kazen you wish to study the dark arts.&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>You say, 'What reagents'&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Venenzi Oberzendi says 'My
master is working on some great project. He's always busy studying an old text
he found and murmuring something about following in the footsteps of Miragul.</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Her Master, Kazen Facae, is at location 340 -1600.&nbsp; He will ask you that you bring him Sir

dark arts'</b></font></p>

down, his eyes glowing with a soft red light. After a moment he begins to speak
though his lips do not move. 'You wish to study under me? Perhaps, if you prove
yourself to follow the twisted path. If you prove to be as coldhearted as I then
I will let you become my servant.'&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>You say, 'how can I prove
myself'&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Kazen Fecae says 'The wandering
'knight' Sir Edwin Motte recently slew one of my lesser servants. This foolish
knave travels from town to town pretending to be 'good.' Separate his head from
his body and return it to me so I may work my magics upon it. This fool will
become another plaything for me, even in death.&nbsp;</b></font></p>

4 places throughout Norrath.&nbsp; The first place is at the Docks in East
Freeport.&nbsp; He spawns fairly frequently in the inn.&nbsp; He is easiest to
catch here.&nbsp; He is part of a rotation with Tumpy, Groflah, and a barbarian
in leather.&nbsp; Just kill these guys if they are there and wait for Edwin to
spawn.&nbsp; Once he has spawned, kill him too.&nbsp; He is only level 33 and
should be easy to dispose of.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b> Bring the head back to Kazen for the Symbol
of the Apprentice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>&nbsp;Kazen Fecae says
'Excellent!' You watch Kazen hold the head by the hair and begin to cast a
spell. A flash of darkness centers around the head and the eyes of the dead
knight open, a terrible scream emanating from its lips. 'This poor fool here - I
think I will keep him in my bag from now on. You have done well, my new
apprentice. Take this symbol and know that you can do other tasks to advance
within my apprentice ranks.'&nbsp;</b></font></p>

advance?'&nbsp;</b></font></p>

without question. Tell my servant the name of any symbol he gives you and he
will instruct you. If I give you a symbol, speak its name to me so I may
instruct you.&nbsp;</b></font></p>

of the apprentice?'</b></font></p>

long way to go before I teach you the true secrets of life and death. Visit
Venenzi Oberendi in the Nektulos forest and show her the symbol. She is
collecting reagents for one of my experiments and is taking far too long. I do
not wish her dead, yet. I simply need the reagents soon. Retrieve the reagents
and give them to my assistant Emkel Kabae. I do not wish to handle them
myself.&nbsp;</b></font></p>

you serve my master as well now. I assume you are here to take the reagents from
me which I have gathered for him? I don't know if I like the idea of you gaining
the credit for my hard work here. I might consider giving you these reagents, if
only you do a small [task] for me.</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Venenzi Oberzendi looks down at
her robes and back at you. 'There is a certain dark elf magician who has decided
to wear the same fashion as I have on several occasions. I do not wish to attend
another social gathering in Neriak and look exactly the same as another woman.
Slay her and bring me her robe and I will give you my hard earned
reagents.&nbsp;</b></font></p>

is usually either Greater Faydark or East Commonlands.&nbsp; Buy a Flowing Black
Robe for about 200-300 platinum.&nbsp; They are almost always being sold.&nbsp;
Take the Flowing Black Robe back to Venenzi for some moss.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Venenzi Oberzendi says 'Thank
you, Seorn . I did not think you would track down Najena and slay her. I think
that I am going to return to my old life in Neriak. I am sick of the way Kazen
has been treating me. He never seems to teach me anything worthwhile. Don't
forget to give his lapdog that symbol with the reagents. I'm sure he will give
you a new one.</b></font></p>

insult his speech, or you may end up dead before you serve your purpose to the

royal family are allowed to partake of it. They live deep in Chardok. They are
hoarding what little of the precious herb there is. If you have an army,

You will need to get to the Overking Area.&nbsp; The herbalist spawns right in
front of the secret wall which leads to the Overking Area.&nbsp; He is easier to
kill than most other mobs with 18 people.&nbsp; The spawn time is approximately
1 hour and he has a placeholder.&nbsp; He doesn't always drop the
Manisi Herb, which is what you need from him so you might have to try this more
than once.&nbsp; Return to Ssessthrass and give him the Manisi Herb and the
Scaled Symbol of the Serpent for a Refined Manisi Herb.&nbsp; Now go back to
Emkel and give him the Refined Manisi Herb.&nbsp; You will get the Symbol of
Testing.</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Take the Symbol of Testing and
give it to Kazen.&nbsp; Immediately after, three mobs will spawn close by to the
East of Emkel on a little inlet.&nbsp; You can kill them with two groups of 50+.&nbsp; You will
need a few good clerics and tanks and they shouldn't cause any
trouble.&nbsp;&nbsp;The three mobs are Bone Golem, Failed Apprentice, and
Tormented Spirit.&nbsp; The Bone Golem and the Tormented Spirit were both level
55 and the Failed Apprentice was blue to a 53.&nbsp; The three mobs spawn one
after another right after the previous one dies (in the order listed
above).&nbsp; The Tormented Spirit drops the Symbol of Insanity.</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Loot the Symbol of Insanity and
take it to Drendico Metalbones in Timorous Deep.&nbsp; He is at the docks that
take you to the Overthere.&nbsp; If you turn right from the docks and climb onto
a stoney hill, you will see this little gnome wandering around 6485, 3829.&nbsp;
In return for the Symbol he will give you his journal and asks you to return to
him, Eye of Innoruuk, Blood of Cazic-Thule, and Cloak of Spiroc Feathers.</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana" size="3"><u>Reagents</u></font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>To get the Cloak of Spiroc
Feathers you will need to speak with Jzil Gsix.&nbsp; You asks for you to bring
him a Silver Disc, Spiroc Feathers, and a Black Silk Cape.&nbsp; The Silver Disc
is found off of mobs on the second isle.&nbsp; It is most commonly dropped off
of Azeracks, level 53&nbsp; monsters of the second isle.&nbsp; The Spiroc
Feathers are dropped from the Watchful Guardian on the 3rd Isle.&nbsp; They are
level 53-55.&nbsp; The final item, Black Silk Cape, is dropped by the boss of
the fourth island, Keeper of Souls.&nbsp; He is a level 60 mob that death
touches every 30 seconds.&nbsp; He can quad hit for 400 which is a real
nuisance.&nbsp; Bring along many of your friends to kill him.&nbsp; The cape
drops about 1 every 15 times (Drop rate changed as of 5/8.&nbsp; New drop rate
needed).&nbsp; Finally, take the three items to Jzil and he
will give you the Cloak of Spiroc Feathers.</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Eye of Innoruuk still drops from Innoruuk in Plane of Hate

that drop this Eye include Maestro of
Rancor, a Ashenbone Drake, Magi P' Tasa (Level 55), Master of Spite.&nbsp; Maestro of Rancor is a level 53 Follower of Innoruuk, Maestro of
Rancor.&nbsp; He can be found sitting at his piano.&nbsp; Be careful with this

me</font></a>.&nbsp; Ashenbone Drakes aren't too difficult to kill.&nbsp; They
must be meleed to death though because any casters casting on them must be right
next to it and this may cause the drake to attack the caster.&nbsp; They range from
level 51 to 53.</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The Blood of Cazic-Thule is
dropped off of Terror, one of the iron guardians guarding Cazic's temple in
Plane of Fear.&nbsp; He is level 60 and said to be the second hardest creature
in Plane of Fear.</b></font></p>

Princess 3 platinum and then clearing the 3rd island.&nbsp; (More accurate info
on this would be appreciated.)&nbsp; Give the Tome of Instruction to Gkzzallk.&nbsp;
