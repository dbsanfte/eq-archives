be found in Misty Thicket at approximately -250, -250.&nbsp; This is on the safe
side of the wall close to the entrance to the dangerous side where the two

first visit Braenar Swiftsong in South Karanas at -19 , +96.&nbsp; Asked him
&quot;what doll&quot; and he will give you a Solusek Mining Company
Invoice.&nbsp; Take the Invoice to Marfen Binkdirple and he will give you A
Mechanical Doll.&nbsp; Give this doll to Braenar's Daughter, Serra.&nbsp; She is
in the Estate of Unrest next to the Gnome Spelunker on the right on the
mansion.&nbsp; You will need a enchanter to mesmerize the spelunker or a group

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><b>Now to find page 25.&nbsp;
First talk to Kelkin Mekia, a female npc in South Karanas.&nbsp; She asks you to bring her 3 guts for 3
dragons.&nbsp; The first guts drops from Eldrig the Old.&nbsp; He is a rare
spawn drake in Skyfire Mountains.&nbsp; Its drops Chromodrac guts which are the
guts you&nbsp; need.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><b> The next guts are dropped from Nezekezena, a named
dragon level 51 in the Burning Woods.&nbsp; Reports indicate that if you go to
Nezekezena's spawn location (about -450, -2550 in Burning Wood) and kill
everything in sight, eventually Nez or his (her?) placeholders will start
spawning with a cycle time of 90 seconds. People have evidenced acquiring
Burning Embers at a rate of 1 or 2 in a few hours' time with this method.
Phurzikan and Nezekezna both spawn on this spot, and they are both strong;
sometimes Nez or Phurz will spawn two times in a row, so your group had better
be strong enough to take them.&nbsp; Nezekezena, if not killed when she spawns,
will wander sometimes along the east and south walls of the zone, so if you
can't find her near her spawn, look there. A tracker would definitely help.&nbsp;
The guts you need from her are red wurm guts.&nbsp; The best way to do this 
camp, is have someone in your guild with an extra computer bring a ranger to the 
zone.&nbsp; Then continually track for a week or so until you get it on track.<br>
<br>
The last guts are dropped from Blackwing in Rathe Mountains.&nbsp; This is a
level 35-40 dragon identical to the other drakes.&nbsp; To get him to spawn,
kill all lizards, drakes, etc. that are close to the sphinx.&nbsp; He will spawn
shortly.&nbsp; He has around 1400-1900 hitpoints. He drops huge onyx drake guts.</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><b>Take the three guts to Kelkin
Mekia and she will give you page 25.</b></font></p>

and Neck of the Mystical Lute</u></a></font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><b>Now for the final part.&nbsp;
You must get talk to Forpar Fizfla.&nbsp; You must complete three quests for
him.&nbsp; After each quest he will reward you will part of the  lute.&nbsp; He
can usually be found in the middle windmill.</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><b>The First Quest is for the Head
and Neck of the lute.&nbsp; Go to Vedico Windwisper in the Butcherblock
Mountains.&nbsp; She is on the docks.&nbsp; She asks that you bring the Alluring
Horn.&nbsp; This horn is dropped off of Quag Maelstrom.&nbsp; He is a level 45
mob in Ocean of Tears, only one zone away from Vedico.&nbsp; The following
information was cited by an anonymous person on Illia's Beastiary. He's
generally on the Seafury Cyclops island around -6000, 1000. He conned red to me
at 42 and he casts drain mana a lot, (which curiously did not appear to lower my
bardic mana bar at all). I was able to land a lot of Chants of Flame and
Curtailing Chants so his fire/magic resistances may not be that high. He didn't
hit me all that much, but if memory serves he was hitting me for around 100 or
120 per shot.&nbsp; He's generally seen wielding this odd weapon which looks
like a thin tree trunk skewering the alluring horn he carries, which tends to
make him stand out from the others. There are a good number of cyclopses on the
small island, so pulling Quag alone isn't easy. But sometimes he stomps over to
the shore by himself (to look in the water I guess). I don't know if he spawns
all the time, or if you have to trigger his spawn by talking to the disgruntled
elf at the BB docks. I went to talk to the elf first just in case, and by the
time I got to the island Quag was there, and didn't despawn over the several
hours I took to gauge the island and set up my offensive.</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><b>Bring the Alluring Horn to
Vedico and she will give you a note to give to give to Forpar.&nbsp; When you
give the note to Forpar he gives you another note of the 3 things he needs.</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><b>The first thing is called
Backbone of an Ancient Fisherman or Phinigel's Spine.&nbsp; It is found off of
the Phinigel Autropos in Kedge
Keep.&nbsp; The Phinigel
Autropos is a very hard level 50 Wizard.&nbsp; He can be taken out by around 2-3
groups that work well together.&nbsp; He enjoys dispelling people (usually your
enduring breath.)&nbsp; He is also very difficult to kill because he is guarded
by 6 guardians which can be hard to kill as well.&nbsp; (Level Needed)</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><b>The second thing is a Amalgym
Tentacle or Amalgym Tendril.&nbsp; These are 9/25 1h slashing weapons that drop
from Amalgym Warriors and Knights in Plane of Fear.&nbsp; They are both level
48-52 but the knights can heal, summon pets, and harmtouch.</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><b>The third thing is a Petrified
Skull of Lycanthrope or petrified werewolf skull.&nbsp; This is dropped from the
Drolvarg Warlord in Karnor's Castle.&nbsp; This is a level 51-54 Drolvarg who
spawns in the Warlord room.</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><b>Hand in the three items 
and the note to Forpar and he will give you the head and neck of the lute.</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><b>The first item is a Large Red
Dragon Scale.&nbsp; This is most commonly dropped by Lord Nagafen, a level 55 dragon in Nagafen's Lair but can also be found off of Zordakilicus
Ragefire in Solusek B,
or Talendor in Skyfire.&nbsp; There is also a mob in The Hole named Nortlav the
Scalekeeper.&nbsp; He is a level 51-55 Erudite that drops the Red Dragon Scale,
the Green Dragon Scale for the Warrior Epic, and the Large White Dragon
Scale.&nbsp; He hits for about 190 on average.&nbsp; He has a nasty harmtouch
that does around 1500 damage.&nbsp; He also uses harmtouch, and has a high magic
resist.&nbsp; Wizard spells Ice Comet and the Lure Line will stick.&nbsp;
Necromancer DoTs will also work.<br>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><b>Now find the Large White Dragon
Scale from Vox in Permafrost, Gorenaire in the Dreadlands, or Nortlav the

will offer to give you the strings to the lute as long as you bring him one
thing.&nbsp; Trakanon's Guts.&nbsp; These drop off of a clone of Trakanon.&nbsp;
He is exactly the same except he always drops the guts.&nbsp; To get him to
spawn, go to Trak's lair while he is not spawned.&nbsp; Give the body of the
lute to An Undead Bard which spawns about 18 hours after a normal Trakanon is 
killed. &nbsp; He will hand it back to you and then attack
you.&nbsp; He is level 55 monster.&nbsp; Once he is killed, the clone of Trakanon will spawn.&nbsp; Trakanon claws for 650, with a sickening melee range,
and his breath attack has been known to kill whole groups in minutes.&nbsp;
Reports say that the regular Trakanon doesn't drop the guts.&nbsp; You have to 
kill him this way but this has not yet been confirmed.&nbsp; Now give Forpar the 
Trakanon Guts, the Head and Neck of the Lute (One Item) and the Body of the Lute 
for Forpar's Mystical Lute.</font></b></p>
