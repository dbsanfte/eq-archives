<p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">For all the
Totemic Armor Quests, you will need one dufrenite gem.&nbsp; These can be
obtained five vendors located through out Norrath.&nbsp; In Halas, there is
Murtog MacYee &amp; Holana Oleary.&nbsp; In West Karanas, there is a barbarian
selling it in the Barbarian Village.&nbsp; In Grobb, there is a troll located in
front of the shaman guild and finally in Oggok the spell component vendor sells
dufrenite.&nbsp; Because dufrenite is very expensive and trolls and ogres
sometimes don't have the highest charisma, you might want to make an alternate
character, possibly a bard because of their high charisma, and give that
character the money to buy the dufrenite.&nbsp; This may take longer but it will
save you several hundred platinum.&nbsp; The dufrenite can cost anywhere from
155-185 platinum depending on how high your charisma is.&nbsp; They are a bit
more expensive than rubies.&nbsp; To get the dufrenite crushed, powdered, or
ground, hand them to one of the ogres in Lake Rathetear.&nbsp; These ogres are
right outside the Rathe Mountains zone and to the right a few steps.&nbsp; Make
sure you are giving the dufrenite to the right ogre because they each do
different things with it.</font></B></p>

you will need medium banded boots, one regular dufrenite gem, an Orc Chief's
Tongue, and Terror Spines.&nbsp; The Orc Chief's Tongue is dropped from the Orc
Chief in Lesser Faydark.&nbsp; He is level 19-22 and spawns in an orc camp at
the bottom of the zone at location -640, 1200.&nbsp; The spawn time is not too
tedious, around 7 minutes.&nbsp; But there are also four centurions, one legionnaire,
and one oracle that spawn at this camp.&nbsp; You can usually pull the the chief
and not aggro the others if you are no too low of a level (16 or under).&nbsp;
Be careful wandering brownie's such as brownie scouts and the name Whimsy
Larktwitter.&nbsp; Whimsy Larktwitter can be killed if you are ready for
her.&nbsp; The brownie scouts nuke very hard so if you are level 20-25 be very
careful about these.&nbsp; Also, if you plan to kite these orcs, do you kite
them near the ranger camp, or else the orc will die to the rangers and you won't
be able to loot them.&nbsp; The tongue is a uncommon drop and it takes most
people 1-2 hours to get it.&nbsp; The Terror Spines drop from Tentacle Terrors
in Najena.&nbsp; They are level 19-22 and spawn very close to the Lavastorm
zone.&nbsp; If you just go straight you will see them.&nbsp; They are easy to
solo and drop the terror spines often.&nbsp; The banded boots can be either
bought off of players for around 10 platinum or they can be made with the
blacksmithing skill.&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn in the boots, the dufrenite gem, the Orc
Chief's Tongue, and the Terror Spines for the Totemic Boots.</font></B></p>

carrion ghoul is unrest.&nbsp; They are level 20-25 but because of their spawn
points (throughout the Undead House), it is very difficult to pull them without
pulling a whole undead train.&nbsp; You might want a druid to harmony them for
you or a skilled monk with FD can try and pull them.&nbsp; The ghoul carrions
are semi-common.&nbsp; Note that these ghouls also rarely drop dufrenite used
for the Totemic Quests.&nbsp; The Charger Hoof Chips drop from Centaur Charges
in South Karana.&nbsp; They are level 25-30 and drop these very rarely.&nbsp;
Although is it mostly luck.&nbsp; You might get it the first time, or you might
get it the 20th time.&nbsp; Just be prepared to spend a lot of time camping
these.&nbsp; And a tracker would be very useful to track down the chargers for

<p>For the leggings you will need one medium banded leggings, one powdered
dufrenite, Permafrost Snowball, Bone Barbs. The Permafrost Snowball is found on
Goblin Wizards in (guess where), Permafrost. The Wizards are level 23-25 and
nuke hard. They are found most commonly in the flag room. You can get a group to
camp it with you and if the flag room is too easy for you, just pull from a
little bit deeper. Be warned that the Wizards can see invis. The Snowball is a
very rare drop off of these and it can take 20-40 times to get it. The Bone
Barbs are dropped commonly from a Bone Barbed Skeleton in either Unrest or Rathe
Mountains. They are level 26-28 and have a permanent damage shield on
themselves. They drop nice platinum for their level so they are usually camped
even though there isn’t an actual spawn point, you just might have trouble
finding one to kill. he banded leggings can be either bought off of players for
around 10 platinum or they can be made with the blacksmithing skill.</p>

<p>For the bracer you will need one medium banded bracer, one regular dufrenite,
Cauldron Shell, Bull Elephant Tooth. The Cauldron Shell are dropped from Aqua
Goblin Tidal Lords in Dagnor’s Cauldron. These are level 22-24. They swim to
and from the island in the middle of the water. It would be very helpful if you
found a tracker to help you find them. They are very easy to find once you have
a tracker and they drop the Shell commonly. The Bull Tooth drops off of Bull
Elephants in South Karanas which are level 20-24. They hit very hard for their
level and are a semi-rare spawn. The Tooth drops about once every 6 times and
they spawn close to the Shadowmen. The banded bracers can be either bought off
of players for around 5 platinum or they can be made with the blacksmithing
skill.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Helm</p>
</font></u><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">
<p>You say: What totemic helm?</p>
<p>Kyralynn says: (text needed)</p>
<p>For the helm you will need a Glacier Bear Pelt, and Ogreskin Chamois, one
medium banded helm, and one ground dufrenite. The Glacier Bear Pelt is dropped
from a Glacier Bear in the underwater caves in Everfrost. These caves aren’t
actually underwater but to get to them you must swim through the frozen river.
If you are coming from Halas and you hit the river, find a hole in the ice and
swim to the left. If you are like me and very cautious when underwater you may
want to have enduring breath. Once in the cave, you basically just have to wait.
The Glacier Bear is a rare spawn in the caves. Its placeholder is a skeleton
that walks clockwise around the caves. You will want to get a map because there
are some very high level NPCs that you will not want to run into such as Miragul.
Once you have the Glacier Bear, killing it is another matter. You can solo it at
level 34 with a pet but it is still pretty hard. You might want to have one
friend come and help you with it. If you have two level 34s then there shouldn’t
be any problem killing it. Loot the Glacier Bear Pelt from it. The Ogreskin
Chamois is dropped from a Lizard Page within Cazic Thule Temple. The pages are
level 20 and drop the Chamois rarely. They spawn most commonly in the maze area
but are also pulled if you hunt in the Throne Room. Just get into a group and
let the members know that you want the Chamois and you shouldn’t have any
trouble. The banded helm can be either bought off of players for around 15
platinum or they can be made with the blacksmithing skill.</p>

<p>You say: What totemic breastplate?</p>
<p>Kyralynn says: (text needed)</p>
<p>For the breastplate, you will need Lancer Swordfish Fin, Grizzlenot Bark, one
crushed Dufrenite, and one medium banded mail. The Lancer Swordfish Fin drops
from Lancer Swordfish within Kedge Keep. This is an all underwater dungeon so of
course you will need Enduring Breath. You can either tag along on a raid and
loot the Fin off of the Lancer’s that they kill or you can get a group
together and kill some on your own. They are level 28-32 and the Fin is a random
drop. You might get it on your first try or you might get it on your 40<sup>th</sup>
try. The Grizzlenot Bark drops off of the named treant Grizzlenot. This is a
very, very rare treant and only spawns once every 1-2 days. This part of the
quest will be very tedious because you will have to wait a long while to get the
Bark. Try and join a treant group. The nice thing about it is that treants are
good exp from level 28-32 so you will get some experience while waiting if you
get into the group. The medium banded mail can be either bought off of players
for around 15 platinum or they can be made with the blacksmithing skill.</font></B><font SIZE="1"></p>
