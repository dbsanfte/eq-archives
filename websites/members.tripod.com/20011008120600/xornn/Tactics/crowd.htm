<p><em>I'm sitting on the north side of a vast pyramid, deep inside the Temple of Cazic
Thule.&nbsp; I came here at the behest of a group of adventurers making claims of the
lizard men advancing on their party, and I had grouped with them in the past.&nbsp; Now
I'm regaining my magical energies from the last battle, a simple one that only required I
slow the lizard that came in.&nbsp; As the paladin gives out a battle cry, my attention is
drawn from my meditation and I rise to meet the incoming attackers.&nbsp; Looks to be
four, no five of them at once--certain doom for these adventurers, except I'm here.</em></p>

<p><em>Quickly I throw a spell of mesmerization over all of the foul things, catching all
but one of them.&nbsp; The paladin and rogue break one of them lose right away as they
fight, but that's of little importance to me.&nbsp; I'm paying attention to the one
charging me now, and a quick burst of color leaves the creature stunned before me as I
drop a longer lasting hypnosis over it.&nbsp; Then I return my attention to the last three
and recast my shorter duration, group control over them before charming one.&nbsp; I root
the other two to the ground and drop my powerful hypnosis over them, and my forced minion
attacks the lizard with the tanks, though it dies fast.&nbsp; Wasting no time I root the
one that charged me to the ground and send my charmed pet at it, and the tanks figure out
quickly which one I want dead next.</em></p>

<p><em>My charm breaks free and I quickly stun and recharm the lizard, just as the current
creature dies abruptly and the paladin roots the next mob for me--intuitive, I like that.
&nbsp; They launch a full assault on the creature and it dies fast, so quickly that I only
mesmerize the last lizard one more time during the fight.&nbsp; As charm breaks again I
stun it and mesmerize it, then resume my meditations calmly while they finish off the
lizard that patiently watched this whole scene.&nbsp; As it falls the healer calls out
that her mana is waning, and warn them of the same.&nbsp; The paladin eyes the last
lizard, my ally for most of the fight, and though his jaw is strong and his eyes are
stoic, I sense fear in his body, though placed in fear for his friends, not himself.
&nbsp; &quot;How long can you hold it?&quot; he asks me.</em></p>

<p><em>I give a curt glance at the lizard man.&nbsp; There is a bit of drool beginning to
leak from the side of its mouth, and I've already regained twice the mana needed to
mesmerize it.&nbsp; &quot;Forever, paladin... forever.&quot;</em></p>

<hr>

<p>There are five primary tools of crowd control; four are the bricks, and the fifth the
mortar.&nbsp; Your job is to play the role of the mason, building a fortress of safety
from the mobs around you, who will gladly end your life when you make a mistake.</p>

<p>So don't make a mistake.

<ul>
  <li>Single Mez</li>
  <li>AoE Mez</li>
  <li>Root</li>
  <li>Charm</li>
  <li>PB Stuns</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the tools you will hold your enemies at bay with, and the most important role
you have in just about any group you join.</p>

<p><strong>Single Mez<br>
</strong>This is quick, easy and safe.&nbsp; It's use is always conditional on good group
control, meaning use of /assist at all times by your group to stay on the same mob, so you
can worry about what <em>needs</em> controlled, as opposed to what isn't being damaged.
&nbsp; During a larger pull, single mezzing can be too slow to get the job done however,
especially when a non-tank is the target of those mobs.&nbsp; Of utmost importance is to
learn the timing of the single mez; know it's duration mentally, till you get nagging
feeling when it's about to break; keep a large analog clock on your desk that you can
glance at whenever a mez lands, giving you a &quot;landmark&quot; for when you need to
remez the mob.&nbsp; One mez spell will not overwrite another, so remember what has been
mezzed when.&nbsp; Whenever possible, mesmerize all of your mobs in a row, so that after
renewing one mez you can move on to the rest and track the timing easier, as well as
allowing you more uninterrupted medding time.</p>

<p><strong>AoE Mez<br>
</strong>When you need a large group of mobs locked down quickly, this is the spell to
cast, especially when your tanks are not the target of assault.&nbsp; A caster or healer
can go down very quickly to 3+ mobs, and this spell will have a much better chance of
saving them.&nbsp; Be warned that switching out of AoE Mez can be difficult and
frustrating, as you try to Root or Charm mobs under the effect before it wears off--but
it's better to be frustrated than dead--or even worse, without a healer and knowing you're
going to die.</p>

<p><strong>Root<br>
</strong>King of aggro-management, a rooted mob swings at the closest target, and this is
the best way to get a mob off of the wrong person, or to buy you time for a longer casting
spell when a PB stun won't cut it.</p>

<p><strong>Charm<br>
</strong>The dangerous, yet rewarding way out of a bad situation, not only stopping damage
to the group (duplicating mezzing) but using that damage upon your enemies (shortening the
need for CC considerably).&nbsp; The gamble is that random duration though.&nbsp; It's a
lot of mana to dump into a quick charm-break, but sometimes even an 18 second charm is 18
seconds you had to gather your wits or get some CC done, plus it's 6 attack tics that mob
was hurting the current target--which is a lot of damage, and 6 tics you would have to do
CC.&nbsp; Every tic a charmed mob is hitting something, that's a tic you won't have to
hold a mob still for.</p>

<p><strong>PB Stuns<br>
</strong>Every time you need to cast a spell and a mob doesn't agree with that idea, the
PB stun is what buys you the time to do so.&nbsp; Every time your healer is aggroed and
you need to stop it from hitting them <em>now</em>, a PB stun will stop it in 1 second.
&nbsp; If nothing else is working in a crowd control, due to bounces, bad pet control,
DOTs on the wrong mob, a PB stun is the spell that gives you time to think or cast, making
it the connecting spell for crowd control.</p>

<hr>

<p>So I've told you the tools... now what?&nbsp; It's simple really.&nbsp; You typically
use single mez when possible, as it's going to be the most reliable and mana-efficient.
&nbsp; If you must get several mobs mezzed <em>fast</em>, you use AoE mez and work on
switching when you can.&nbsp; If aggro is a problem, or a mob has been DOTed (or isn't
mezzable) Root is there to save the day.&nbsp; When trying to switch out of an AoE Mez
situation, or a DOTed mob, charm is a great way to turn the tables on a fight, and in the
middle of all this mez, you use PB stuns to keep people healthy while you work.</p>

<p>Learning crowd control is more about interpretation and reaction than planning.
&nbsp; The spells memorized are how you intend to control a fight, the spells cast during
the battle are purely dependent on the need.&nbsp; Learning to recognize what is needed
when is how you become a master.&nbsp; My only real advice to becoming a master of crowd
control is to practice.&nbsp; Go to a green conning camp that is no threat to you and try
to crowd control it.&nbsp; Open up with an AoE Mez, charm one, and try to kill the camp
off without running out of mana.&nbsp; It's good practice because the charmed mob will
kill about as quickly as a group would at that level, and you will have charm breaks to
deal with.&nbsp; When a mob hits you, you have to back the pet off after it's controlled,
giving you an understanding of what the magician has to deal with in group.&nbsp; Use your
current spells, not weaker ones that will suffice for the greens.&nbsp; The object isn't
to kill the camp, it's to manage your mana while doing it, to get a feel for how many is
too many, then push that limit.</p>

<p>Now try dropping a PB Stun amidst those mobs and doing it with 5 things aggro at once.
&nbsp; After that, move to a bigger camp.&nbsp; Get a partner with you when it becomes
dangerous, and keep practicing.&nbsp; You will reach a time where you look back at advice
I've given, and say, &quot;<em>That's</em> why Xornn said to try this!&quot;&nbsp; But
most important above all, beyond anything you read here... discover what works for
yourself.&nbsp; If you try my tactics repeatedly, and it's not working for you, change it!
&nbsp; Maybe your connection speed affects what you can pull off... maybe AoE mezzing just
isn't for you... maybe you'll never cast charm in your life, but you love to stunlock!
&nbsp; That's fine--just as long as <em>you</em> know you're doing the best you're able.</p>

<p>If you were hoping you'd learn more from reading this section, I hope you can look back
and see that I've told you everything you can be told.&nbsp; I'm just hear to teach you
how to learn what it means to control a crowd.&nbsp; To actually deal with the pumping
heart and anxiety of crunching impacts to your body, you have to be there--you have to do
it.</p>
