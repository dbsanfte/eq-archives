the shiny metallic robes.&nbsp; These robes are dropped off of the Ghoul
Archmagus.&nbsp;
He spawns in the Magi Room.&nbsp; To get there from the Dead Side Zone 1, go
down the small hallway at the zone, turn right and go down another hill.&nbsp;
Run through the small corridor until you come to water.&nbsp; Jump into the
water and swim to the right.&nbsp; You will come up at the bedroom.&nbsp; Take
the passage all</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b> the way to the left.&nbsp; Follow this until you come to a big
room with bats in it.&nbsp; Take the passage to the left of you.&nbsp; Next,
follow the wall to the right, past the Greater Ice Bone Skeletons.&nbsp; Until
you come to a group of steps with a bridge.&nbsp; Jump off the bridge to the
left.&nbsp; Go straight down a hallway and you will come to a jail.&nbsp; Keep
going straight down that hallway until you can turn to the right.&nbsp; Turn to
the right and follow that hallway to the magi room.&nbsp; For a map go to <a href="http://www.graffe.com"><font color="#BB3D2F">www.graffe.com</font></a><font color="#BB3D2F">.</font>
The magus is a 30 minutes spawn and has a placeholder which is usually a Kor
Ghoul Wizard or a Dar Ghoul Knight.&nbsp; He spawns 1 every 5 times.&nbsp; So
expect him to spawn once every 2 and a half hours.&nbsp; The rare drop is a
Shiny Metallic Robe which drops 1 every 6 times.&nbsp; If you get up early in
the morning and get into a group there I bet by the end of the day you will have
one.&nbsp; Note that the Shiny Metallic Robe is not no drop and can be purchased
for approximately 7,000 platinum.</b></font></p>

in Oasis of Marr.&nbsp; He is a rare spawn and has a 300 pop regeneration.&nbsp;
Even though he is only 51, the regeneration makes him seem much higher and you
need a couple of high level groups to kill him.&nbsp; He will drop the
Spoon.&nbsp; The One Key is found in the Overthere on a ledge at approximately
-190, -380.&nbsp; You will need levitate to get there.&nbsp; The spawn time is
24 hours.&nbsp; The Lost Scroll is found in the bottom of Dalnir.&nbsp; It is
inbetween a bed and the wall at -18, 54.&nbsp; The spawn time is 24 hours.&nbsp;
Finally, the Book of Charm and Sacrifice is found in the Plane of Air on a table
to the right of the Efreeti spawn.&nbsp; Again the spawn time is 24 hours.&nbsp;
Combine all these items in the Enchanter's Bag to get a Sack for Mizzle.&nbsp;

ahead onto the ledge in front of you. Enter the room with the three spiders and

'What is the head of a serpent?'<br>
'Serpent is probably not an accurate term form what you must return to me. It is
actually the remnants of a spirit. The spirit is one which was eradicated long

'You don't have to look far to find roaming spirits. One in particular though
has more meaning then the other sorry souls trapped here. You see, Kindle was a
dear friend of mine. I came in search of him when he stopped writing. Wel....look
at me now. I fear that I have succumbed to the same fate as poor Kindle.<br>
