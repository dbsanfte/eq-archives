  <p><u>Southern Ro</u></p>
  <p>Our first guild event took place in South Ro. After the GuildMeeting, we all TP'd to SRo, and were quickly transformed into a pack of Ravenous Dogs! As the 2 groups of CoS members zoned in, a comment was heard at the Druid Ruins.. "Someone call the pound!"</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Shortly thereafter, we ran into Terrorantula! This was not to be our only meeting with him today. Once the CoS engaged him, he was no longer a threat to the denizens of SRo.</p>

    </a></p>
<p> At this point, we scoured the zone, soon to find The Ancient Cyclops! He was no match for the CoS, and his death supplied Darice with a brand new pair of JourneyMans boots!</p>

<p> Please, if you have any screenshots you would like to see here, convert them to .jpg and email them to me! I will post them as soon as I get them</p>
