<p><em>The spectral caller eerily rasped past twenty paces ahead, and Xornn watched from
behind the fallen pillar.&nbsp; The vegetation of Trakanon's Teeth was clinging, leaving a
humidity to the air matched only by the audible chirping of the countless insects
serenading their cries to the night.&nbsp; Unnoticed by the unholy patrol, the high elf
waited patiently for the way to clear.</em></p>

<p><em>Well, patience wasn't always one of the old enchanter's virtues.</em></p>

<p><em>Mentally dominated and well on it's way to attacking the camp it came from, Xornn
pressed ahead, into a building with a deep ramp into the earth--or what was left of a
building.&nbsp; Deep below, there Xornn found a glowing black and red speckled orb,
humming with a toxic power.&nbsp; Withdrawing the organic key his travels had recently
procured him, he touched the key to the globe with some trepidation.</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;We need you in our group, now!&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>Welcome, old enchanter, to the ruins of Sebilis.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>From the 13th Circle on, your spells are going to be upgrades upon old versions; some
will be staggering improvements, others will be interesting trinkets.&nbsp; A few you
won't be able to comprehend how you did the first 50ish levels without it.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Spells</strong></p>

<p><strong>Collaboration - </strong>Upgrade to Benevolence, way back from the 6th Circle.
&nbsp; This one increases your faction by 300 &quot;units&quot;.&nbsp; I don't actually
know how much a unit is in terms of slipping from say Threatening to Dubious, but it does
just that in a place like Velketor's Labyrinth, where this spell can make you completely
non-KoS.</p>

<p><strong>Theft of Thought - </strong>I mentioned one of those spells you can't imagine
not having... this is one of them.&nbsp; 25 mana per cast, which you target a caster with.
&nbsp; 2 seconds later you will have 346 mana (51st) to 400 mana (60th) from your target.
&nbsp; Wandering Mind move over, there's a new mana tap in town.&nbsp; The recast, 2
minutes--which is a pain, but when you've got a lot of mezzing to do, regaining 20% of
your mana bar every two minutes is <em>really</em> nice.&nbsp; If your group won't leave a
caster mob till the last kill of a multiple pull, train them, it's just free mana waiting
for you.&nbsp; Now, in addition to this, there's a handy little trick you can use when you
find yourself low on mana (and needing it badly) with no casters around.&nbsp; /duel
someone in your group, whichever you like.&nbsp; You will no longer be able to buff them,
but you can both /camp when death is <em>not</em> imminent.&nbsp; You can cast Theft of
Thought on anyone you're dueling, and even if they don't have mana, it will still tap
them.&nbsp; They will also fall victim to PB stuns, AoE Mezzing, and any mistarget casts
you have, so take care.&nbsp; Still, when you have 10% mana and you're going to lose
control of the fight, that monk over there is a limitless source of mana just begging to
be tapped.</p>

<p><strong>Wake of Tranquility -<em> </em></strong>Only seems proper to pair a pretty
trinket with an amazing spell like Theft of Thought.&nbsp; WoT is just an AoE version of
the Lull series.&nbsp; By this point of your career, you realize that Lull only belongs in
the occasional no-xp very low green camps when farming loot.&nbsp; Wake of Tranquility has
the same horrid resist rates, just allows you to lull a whole room at once instead of
needing several casts.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Buffs-Solo - </strong>I've gotten to where I keep a set lineup of buffs going,
modified again by my changes in play style.&nbsp; When solo, I always have Clarity and
Arch Shielding up.&nbsp; Augmentation and Shadow don't see much use from me anymore, but
I'm not saying you shouldn't buff them.&nbsp; I just find them another nagging buff I'm
not in the mood to cast usually.&nbsp; I usually won't even buff Brilliance and Adorning
Grace.&nbsp; Basically, I'm lazy, and those two spells are drastic buffs, the rest are
just helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Buffs-Group - </strong>Once I get into a group things change.&nbsp; Clarity on
everyone with mana, Swift Like the Wind on all melee classes, Group Resist Magic on the
whole shebang, and I keep Clarity, Arch Shielding, Group Resist Magic, Brilliance,
Adorning Grace, and at least Rune III, sometimes even IV.&nbsp; When in group it's a whole
different ballgame, and I'm nickel and diming for every edge I can get.&nbsp; It took a
long time to decide, but I think it's about responsibility.&nbsp; If I want to skimp on my
buffs while soloing, that's me that suffers the consequences--but if I'm not in the mood
to put a wisdom buff on the druid, I'm skimming <em>them</em> by not doing my job--even if
I may think they don't need it.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Group-Dungeon - </strong>Theft of Thought causes a <em>massive</em> change in
play style, as it becomes simply imperative to have a caster alive during fights as long
as possible.&nbsp; This also means figuring out what spell slot to dump in exchange for
ToT, which can't be unmemmed all the time.&nbsp; My lineup is typically Mesmerizaion,
Color Skew, Color Shift, Root, Dazzle, Theft of Thought, Tashania, and Swap Slot, which
will typically contain Shiftless Deeds (if I have to slow) or a charm, both spells I can
quickly memorize when the need arises.</p>

<hr>

<p>The big thing about 51 and on is the dramatically higher experience requirements; 51 to
53 are hell levels (compared to 50), 54 to 58 are hell compared to 53, and 59 is hell
compared to 58.&nbsp; Oddly enough, 60th level needs about the same experience to
&quot;complete&quot; (filling the xp bar) as 53 does.&nbsp; You are now an Illusionist, a
master of your profession--so shine with your talent, and lead the group to victory.</p>
