<p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana" size="6"><u>Ragebringer Quest</u></font></B></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Note: You must be level 50 or above to talk to the Quest NPCs.&nbsp;
If you are lower than that, the NPCs will not respond and you will not get the
rewards when you turn in items.&nbsp; This applies for the sub-quests as well.</B></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The quest starts out in the Qeynos Aqueducts.&nbsp; You must
find Malka Rale at +380, -210.&nbsp; If she is not there, her placeholder is a
courier.&nbsp; This courier does not need to be killed.&nbsp; It will despawn at
8 pm and then Malka will spawn at 10pm, game time.&nbsp; Talk to her and say I
will help.&nbsp; She will get you Stanos' Pack.</B></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Now travel to North Kaladim and find Founy Jestands at about
+520, +307.&nbsp; He is a Rogue guildmaster at the bank (or close to).&nbsp; If
he is not there wait until 10 am for him to respawn.&nbsp; Then pickpocket from
him stained parchment top.&nbsp; He does not always have the piece so just wait
another full day for him to despawn and then respawn again.&nbsp; If you are
caught and he attacks you just run to the zone.</B></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Now you need to get the bottom
of the stained parchment.&nbsp; This is pickpocketed from Tani N'Mar in Neriak
3rd Gate at +650, -1300.&nbsp; Like Founy, she does not always have the piece
and spawns at 10 am.</B></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Now go to Highpass Hold.&nbsp;
Go to the secret smugglers cave.&nbsp; To get there, jump into the water close
to the inn with the deck.&nbsp; swim to +10, +325 and walk up the narrow
passage.&nbsp; Find Stanos in the camp.&nbsp; If he is not there then you must
make him spawn.&nbsp; You can do this two ways:</B></font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Give Anson McBale Stanos'
    Pack.&nbsp; Stand behind Anson so that you will not be standing on Stanos'
    spawn point.&nbsp; This is the easiest way to do it.</B></font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>If you have high faction
    with Anson then you can tell him &quot;I need to see Stanos.&quot;&nbsp; If
    you are able to do this then you do not need to find Malka Rale in the
    Qeynos Aqueducts.</B></font></li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>If Anson isn't in the camp,
then you must kill his placeholder which is a smuggler.&nbsp; Get a group of
level 50+ and kill all the smugglers.&nbsp; They are fairly high and backstab
very hard.&nbsp; This should cause Anson to spawn.&nbsp; Once Stanos has
spawned, give him the two pieces of parchment and he will give you the combined
parchment.&nbsp; </B></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Travel to Lake Rathe and locate
Eldreth at +2600, -550.&nbsp; He is a random spawn.&nbsp; He may be there, it
may take a couple hours, or it may take a couple real life days.&nbsp; Once you
have found him.&nbsp; Turn in the Combined Parchment, 100 platinum, and 2
unstacked bottles of milk.&nbsp; He will reward you with a scribbled note.&nbsp;
You must have atleast indifferent faction when turning in the items.&nbsp; If
your faction is lower than that then use the sneak technique when turning in the
items.</B></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>This next part is very tedious
and somewhat difficult.&nbsp; You have to go to Plane of Hate and find the Book
of Souls.&nbsp; This books spawn time is 10 hours and is located -60,
+320.&nbsp; This is on the night stand on the top floor of Maestro of Rancor's
house.&nbsp; There are wandering mobs.&nbsp; You will want to do this with a
bunch of friends because there are wandering mobs.&nbsp; If the book spawns and
no one picks it up, wandering creatures will.&nbsp; To get people to come along
and wait with you for 10 hours, try having a Maestro of Rancor raid or a Hate
Raid.&nbsp; This way there will be people around you for a long time and you
won't get killed by wandering NPCs.</B></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Next, go to Steamfont Mountains
and find Yendar Starpyre.&nbsp; He runs across the zone and is easily spotted
because he is wearing an SMR.&nbsp; To stop him from running say
&quot;book&quot;.&nbsp;
Give him the Scribbled Parchment and he will despawn.&nbsp; Wait for him to
respawn again and then give him the Tattered Parchment and the Book of
Souls.&nbsp; He will despawn and in his place will be Renux, a level 50 human
rogue.&nbsp; She quad hits for 200 and can backstab for 200+.&nbsp; She casts
clockwork poison which is a spinning stun spell.&nbsp; She does not attack
pets.&nbsp; She can be feared and snared.&nbsp; Do not melee her if she is not
feared.&nbsp; The best way to kill her is pet
kiting.&nbsp; Have one melee class attack her as soon as she spawns.&nbsp; Make
sure he and everyone else have SoW and the cleric/shaman needed buffs such as
hitpoints and AC.&nbsp; Run around in circles.&nbsp; Have all pets attack
her.&nbsp; Make sure they are equipped with weapons.&nbsp; The best kind are
magician summoned.&nbsp; While the pets are attacking and the melee is kiting,
have people casting fear on her.&nbsp; If she gets feared send all melee in on
her and have all casters nuke.&nbsp; When fear breaks, all meleers except for
the kiter must back away.&nbsp; She will die very quickly this way with not very
many casualties.&nbsp; If the melee person dies, do not panic.&nbsp; Just have
more melee people ready to kite her.&nbsp; To do this, you must have 3 or
preferably more, necromancers that are 53+, 3 or preferably more, druids that
are 57+, and lots and lots of pet casters.&nbsp; Loot from her the Jagged Diamond
Dagger and Translated Parchment.</B></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Go back to Highpass Hold and
find Stanos.&nbsp; If he is not there use the method above.&nbsp; Give Stanos
the Translated Parchment for a sealed box.</B></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Go to Kithicor, which is one
zone off of Highpass.&nbsp; Find the Dark Elf House at +800, +2400.&nbsp; Give
the box to any of the night spawns, causing General V'Ghera to spawn.&nbsp; Take
him to a safe spot in the zone, preferably a zone and kill him.&nbsp; He is a
very hard level 60 being.&nbsp; He is equal or better than any god.&nbsp; He
quad attacks for 275 quite quickly, has a 1500pt harm touch and casts soul
devour. He can also summon mobs from the zone to assist him.&nbsp; He is weak to
Wizard Lure Line, Poison Spells, Scent Line, and Fire Based Spells.&nbsp; He is
extremely strong against magic based spells so do not use it, it will just waist
mana.&nbsp; The following strategy was found at the Safehouse.&nbsp; Here are
what is recommended as groups:</B></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Gather together at min 36
players (6 full groups - more if they are split up) or up to about 50 if needed
(it is reccomended that you do NOT get more then 50 or the zone may crash or too
many will go LD and you will loose because of this)&nbsp;</B></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>PULL TEAM: Quest Rogue with the
&quot;sealed box&quot;, 56+ Shadow Knight OR Monk, and at least 2-3 56+ TANKS,
and a 55+ Magi with CoH to summon the rogue after the hand off (total = 4-6
people)&nbsp;</B></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>TANK TEAM: 56+ Cleric, 56+
Enchanter, 56+ Shaman, and 3 high level TANKS&nbsp;</B></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>UNDEAD CONTROL DETAIL TEAM: All
enchanters (as high lvl as possible)&nbsp;</B></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>NUKE TEAM (there may be more
then 1 nuke team): As many LURE available Wizards as possible!, Magi and Necros
w/pets&nbsp;</B></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>OTHERS: the best teams are
composed of 4 tanks and 2 clerics to keep them alive, all the casters should be
grouped into their own groups - no nukers with the tanks.</B></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Get the highest level players
as possible - if you haven't got at least 2 teams of 56+ chars it is NOT recommended
you do this battle.<br>
</B></font><b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
And here is how you kill him:</font></B></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>1) Set up forces at the
crossroads - +800, +3200.&nbsp;</B></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>2) 3pm game time: Everyone
Buffs Fully - Get all pets buffed.&nbsp;</B></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>3) 4pm: Pull Team and Tank Team
move to the ridge west of the DE cabin at location +800, +2400.&nbsp;</B></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>4) Kill ALL Placeholderss in
the cabin by 7pm (Except the Chaplain - if he aggros mesmerize and memory blur
him) (note: this is done by only the pull and tank teams).&nbsp;</B></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>5) Kill ALL nearby undead by
8pm, Everything.&nbsp;</B></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>6) All pull team members get an
invis to undead from the cleric (except for rogue) - may want to have spare
invis to undead potions.&nbsp;</B></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>7) Tank Team moves back to
crossroads.&nbsp;</B></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>8) 9pm: Chaplain will despawn -
Begin speed buffing and DS buffs.&nbsp;</B></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>9) Feign Death Puller (whether
it be the Shadowknight or Monk) moves into cabin (near where the chaplain
despawns but not on his spawn point) and Feign Deaths - NO NPCs should be in
the cabin at this time, if one spawns other then the Coercer, KILL IT.&nbsp;</B></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>10) Rogue moves to opposite
side of cabin where the Feign Death puller will pull the coming Coercer to (this
location needs to be far enough away from the cabin so that anyone walking into
the cabin will not agro her but far enough away from all undead).</B></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>11) 11pm: The Coercer spawns,
FD puller pulls to the waiting Rogue (who is hidden and sneaking).</B></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>12) Rogue gives box to the
Coercer from behind while sneaking then rehides, General V'Ghera spawns a few
seconds later (hand off needs to be fast so the Coercer does not return to the
cabin) If the Rogue agros her just sit and die, DO NOT PULL TO GROUP, the cleric
will get you later (make sure you get LOC) If the hand off is successful then
have the Magi - who is still located at the base camp - Call of the Hero the Rogue
back to camp and get ready for the incoming General.&nbsp;</B></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>13) Highest level tank on the
pull team pulls the General to the waiting forces at the crossroads - make sure
you do not get too far away from the General or he will go back to the cabin (if
the first tank dies while pulling then the second highest tank on the pull team
will take over and so on until the General is at the camp) NOTE: Call of Hero
can be used to bring the Feign Death puller and Rogue back to camp safely - use
this only when you have a magician in pull team that stays in camp during pull.</B></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>14) All forces at crossroads
engage - EXCEPT the Enchanters... ALL (or at min 2) the Enchanters will have the
sole responsibility of keeping the undead that arrive mesmerized (Mainly the
healers) Since the General is level 63 his corpse will not rot for 30 minutes -
the Rogue should loot first, make sure to get the &quot;General's Pouch&quot;
and IF it drops the &quot;Cazic Quill.&quot; You will be very lucky if it drops
the Cazic Quill.&nbsp; If he doesn't then you must do the <a href="cazic_quill.htm"><font color="#BB3D2F">sub-quest</font></a>.&nbsp; All
other loot from the General is NOT needed for the quest and SHOULD be given out
to the helping forces - distribute however you see fit.</B></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Go back to Stanos in Highpass
Hold and turn in the Jagged Diamond Dagger, Cazic's Quill, and the General's
Pouch for the Ragebringer.</B></font></p>
