<p align="center"><em>Welome to Xornn's Guide to Enchanting.&nbsp; Within this site I have
undertaken the task of providing you with one simple thing--everything I know about
Enchanting, and the best advice I can give to you on becoming a truly great enchanter.
&nbsp; This guide is always under construction, and I doubt I will ever finish it.&nbsp; I
have however added a news page so you can check if anything has changed since your last
visit.&nbsp; Please take a look around and feel free to e-mail me your thoughts and
questions, or also available is <a
href="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ultimatebb.cgi?category=5">Caster's Realm
Enchanter</a> board, where you can meet the whole enchanter community.&nbsp; (My posting
handle is Eugee.)</em></p>

<p>If you're like me, you've been trying to download &quot;_verQuest.exe&quot; in the
&quot;Patching...&quot; window all night.&nbsp; I have put this version of EverQuest.exe
into a .zip file and posted it here for download.&nbsp; To grab this file, right-click and
choose &quot;Save Target As...&quot;&nbsp; Unzip this file into your EverQuest directory.
&nbsp; If you don't know how to do that comfortably, then don't download this and just
keep trying to get into EverQuest on your own.&nbsp; Here is the .zip file (400K)</p>
