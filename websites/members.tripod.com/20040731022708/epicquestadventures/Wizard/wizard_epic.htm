<p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana" size="4"><u>The Beginning</u></font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The Wizard Epic Quest is
started by talking to Solomen (Level 40) within the Temple of Solusek Ro.&nbsp;
Entrance is in Lavastorm location (+800,
+228).&nbsp; Solomen is a human wizard located on the left portion of the
temple, third floorm between the two undead knights, one room away from Lord
Seafire.&nbsp; Here is what you say:</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Start by saying &quot;hail Solomen.&quot;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>He will respond, &quot;Ah, I
see you have found my study. This is where I study and scribe the history of
magic in Norrath.&quot;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Say, &quot;What history?&quot;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Solomen says, &quot;I have worked to chronicle everything from the
beginnings of magic to what we consider the modern day of magic. Solusek Ro has
been very generous to those who wield magic in Norrath. But throughout history
there is one thing I have noticed - too much power corrupts the soul. I have
seen and documented that the strongest wizards and those closest to Solusek Ro
become corrupted by their power.&quot;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>You says, &quot;What Wizards?&quot;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Solomen responds, &quot;Unfortunately, I don't have time to speak of such
things right now. But I could use your help since you are here. I have here an
envelope that I need delivered to one Camin Rah. You can find Camin in the
wizard tower in the city of Erudin. He is a sage like myself whose knowledge
rivals my own. Do you [agree] to undertake my task?.&quot;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>You say, 'I agree.'</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Solomen says 'Here you are, then. Good luck on your journey.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Solomen then gives you a note that you must give to
Camin.</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana" size="4"><u>Camin</u></font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Now you must head to the City of Erudin and find Camin.&nbsp; He can be found
at the Vasty Deep Inn.&nbsp; To find him, simply open the front
door and go up the stairs to your right.&nbsp; Go down the hall and open the
first door on your left.&nbsp; Camin will be behind the door.&nbsp; He is
normally indifferent or apprehensive to everyone.&nbsp; Hand him the note that
Solomen gave to you and your faction with TrueSpirit will increase.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Camin with say, &quot;So you have met
Solomen, eh? He is a
man with a wealth of knowledge. It is good to hear he is well.&quot;</b></font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Hail Camin and he will
respond, &quot;Go away!&nbsp; I have no time for you!&quot;&nbsp; If this does
happen then you must raise your faction with TrueSpirit.&nbsp; There is no
confirmed way to do this put some wizards have handed him 1000 platinum and it
did the trick.&nbsp; You are not able to hand him the note over and over again
to raise faction with TrueSpirit.&nbsp; This was nerfed since the patch on
10/03/00.&nbsp; You need to be warmly with him and then hail him again.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Then say, &quot;What are you
searching for?&quot;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Camin says ''Ah! A smart one, I see! If you really wish to know about such a
thing, you will have to help me finance my studies. The knowledge I have
acquired and researched did not come cheaply.&quot;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Hand Camin 1000 platinum
pieces and yes it is confirmed that you must do this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Once you have handed him the
money he will reply, &quot;Good, good, you show a
willingness to learn of this with your offer. What I can tell you is that
Solusek Ro had four followers who had shown exceptional aptitude in the arts of
wizardry. Solusek Ro himself tutored them. He considered them to be like his own
children. I know of one who still exists. He goes by the name of Arantir
Karondor. He used to specialize in the storing of magic into physical objects.
Arantir has been hiding for many, many years and will most assuredly be going by
another name, so keep your eyes open. Anyway, be off, I need to continue my
research. Return to me if you ever find Arantir Karondor.''</b></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana" size="4"><u>Arantir
Karondor</u></font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Now to find Arantir Karondor. There is a female NPC vendor in Halas named
Dargon that sells a potion called Ro's Breath. She is located in front of the
Shaman guild. Purchase this potion from Dargon for the sum of about 900pp to
1100pp depending on your faction and charisma. Now take this potion back to
Camin in Erudin and hand it to him. He will reply with the following:</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Camin says 'Very interesting... I've seen this work before. Yes, yes! It's
the work of Arantir Karondor! Give this back to the person you got it from.
Maybe he will have a clue to Arantir's location.'</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Camin gives you back the potion (it has now been stripped of it's Shield of
Lava charge) and you must take it back to Dargon in Halas. Note: you cannot skip
the previous trip to Camin. You absolutely, must hand the potion to Camin. If
you try to skip the trip to Erudin, you will get the following message from
Dargon: &quot;I didn&#146;t request this item, but thank you very much&quot;.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Back in Halas, hand the Ro's Breath potion back to Dargon. She will turn into
blue robe adorned, Arantir Karondor and reply with:</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Dargon says 'So, I've been discovered! You must know Camin - he is one of the
only people who could have recognized my work. I have worked very hard to mask
my presence here.'</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>You say, 'hail Arantir Karondor'</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Arantir Karondor says 'Before I tell you anything, I require you to help me.
Seek a woman named Challice. Give her this letter and then return to me.'</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana" size="4"><u>Arantir's Ring</u></font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The letter that Arantir hands you is actually a ring called Arantir's Ring.
Identifying it reveals: &quot;Item Lore: My love has no bounds.&quot;. Challice
is found in the basement of the Felwithe paladin guild. Remember that
Arantir will despawn in three minutes. So if you want him to stay there while
you go to Felwithe, have a friend stay with Arantir and continue to talk to him
while you are gone.&nbsp; If he does despawn then you must wait for another
wizard to make him spawn.&nbsp; Once in Felwithe, hand Challice the ring and she will reply with:</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>&quot;Oh yes? Arantir? What a fool he was! The man gave me
everything, but for all his intelligence, he could never understand why I was
truly with him. It was for his power; he could do anything. But when he
mysteriously lost it, he became just another toy. I never loved him. Return this
ring to him. He will understand that I have no desire to see him again.''</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>She then returns to you a new ring that you must take to Arantir/Dargon.&nbsp; 
It does not matter if you give the ring to Dargon if Arantir has despawned.&nbsp; 
If you do this, Arantir will respawn.&nbsp; Then hail him.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>&quot;Ah, but it pains my heart to see this. How I could love a women like
that is beyond me. And yet, I still do love her. It was on the day I was to ask
her to marry me that I lost my powers. When I was about to cast my greatest
spell to prove my love to her, my magic failed. She ran out on me that day. But
enough of me, do you wish to hear my story?'&quot;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>You say, ''I wish to hear your story.''</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Arantir Karondor says &quot;I once was one of four true followers of Solusek Ro.
So great were the four of us that Solusek Ro himself made us each a special
item. We did not know what the others' items were, but we realized that was for
our own safety. Each one of us, after receiving the item, began to plot against
Solusek Ro. Each of us believed we had enough power to dominate Norrath. Solusek
Ro saw this and at the time we needed our powers most, he stripped us of them.
Now I know two of the other wizards by name. One was called Sylen Tyrn, the
other's name was Demunir Scry. The last wizard was a gnome, but I can't think of
his name.&quot;</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana" size="4"><u>Sylen Tyrn -
Blue Crystal Staff</u></font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>You say, ''What about Sylen Tyrn?''</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Arantir Karondor says ''Sylen was a high elf wizard, and like many high elves,
he believed himself to be better than others. Because of his birth, he thought
he was more noble and more intelligent than anyone else. I heard how met his
demise - while flying over a vast area of water, his powers were stripped from
him in midflight. He fell and was captured by a rival wizard who specialized in
magics of the water. Search for that wizard and you could find a trace of Sylen.''</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The trace of Sylen Tyrn can be found on the Phinigel Autropos in Kedge
Keep.&nbsp; The item he means is he Blue Crystal Staff.&nbsp; The Phinigel
Autropos is a very hard level 50 Wizard.&nbsp; He can be taken out by around 2-3
groups that work well together.&nbsp; He enjoys dispelling people (usually your
enduring breath.)&nbsp; He is also very difficult to kill because he is guarded
by 6 guardians which can be hard to kill as well.&nbsp; (Level Needed)</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana" size="4"><u>Demunir Scry -
Gnarled Staff</u></font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>You say, 'What about Demunir Scry?'</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Arantir Karondor says 'Demunir was a human in a rush for power. He was
extremely intelligent and resourceful but, unfortunately, was more interested in
destructive magic. Hearing of an ancient land, he immediately traveled to it,
believing there to be powerful relics left undiscovered there. While exploring,
he came upon a dwelling that housed a powerful warrior. Believing himself to be
more powerful, he attempted to take this dwelling for himself. While in battle
with this warrior, Solusek Ro stole his powers and left him helpless. It is said
that Demunir's item is the warrior's most prized trophy.&quot;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The item you need this time is the Gnarled Staff dropped off of Venril
Sathir in Karnor's Castle, the leader of the Iksar Empire.&nbsp; He is a 55
Warrior with approximately 18000 hitpoints he can be difficult to kill.&nbsp;
Very Difficult.&nbsp; He has 2 personal clerics with heal him and never seem to
run out of mana.&nbsp; It might be smart to have a designated group that would
kill these before helping the other groups with Venril.&nbsp; The best type of
spells to cast on him are cold and fire because he doesn't have as strong
resistances in those type of spells.&nbsp; He has 1000 lifetap punches which can
be very dangerous also.&nbsp; Basically, you need a strong guild to kill him and
be able to loot the staff, if it drops.</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana" size="4"><u>The Gnome -
Staff of Gabstik</u></font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>You say, ''What about the gnome?'' If he doesn't reply, say:</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>''Who is the gnome?''</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Arantir Karondor says 'Ah, the gnome I know very little about. I know he was
small and crafty, and that he had a brother. His brother's craft was that of
making fireworks, and he was the unfortunate victim of one of his own
experiments. His firework exploded, leaving his mind diminished in capacity,
even for a gnome. I remember others calling him 'Old Stewpot' in jest. I do not
know if this is his birth name, but it may help you to locate him. I hear he
also stays close to water because of the explosion. You never know when another
gnomish invention will go awry. Give him this letter to help motivate him to
remember.&quot;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The gnome Arantir Karondor is talking about is Kandin Firepot in
Butcherblock.&nbsp; His location is -1500, +2800, near the ocean.&nbsp; When you
give Kandin the note from Arantir he will say:</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Kandin Firepot says ''Brother! I have one of those. He's great, but he's dead.
His name was Gabstik and he was a really powerful wizard. I still have one of
his greatest possessions! Hey, I know! You can help me with my greatest
firework! I need you to get me a skin to put the powder from my firework in.
That's the only thing I can think of to use though I cannot get myself. I need a
skin that is dry and brittle, yet can still be shaped. So go fetch me some and
I'll scratch your back.''</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>What Kandin is speaking about is Cazic's Skin, dropped off of Cazic-Thule,
God of Fear, level 55 in the Plane of Fear.&nbsp; He has the ability to
harmtouch (his harmtouch essentially kills anyone) anyone in the zone, no matter
how far they are.&nbsp; He is pretty hard to kill unless you have a strong guild
and to make this even harder, Cazic's Skin is a rare drop!&nbsp; Take this
skin back to Kandin and hand it to him. He will reply with:</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Kandin Firepot says ''Great! This is? What is this for again? Oh yeah, the
casing for my firework. Here, you can have this then, oh no, wait. You can't
yet. I forgot I needed another part to my firework, and you are exactly the
person to get it for me! I need some mistletoe powder. Now, go find some for me!
Go, go, go, go! Shoo! Oh, wait! Hold on to my bag for me, please. You can give
it back after you've given me what I want.''</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>You will receive Kandin's Bag.&nbsp; Make sure you have room to carry
it.&nbsp; It cannot be opened.&nbsp; The mistletoe powder he needs is dropped
off of Tolapmulj, yet another hard, rare kill.&nbsp; He is around level 60 and
has strong resistances in all types of magic.&nbsp; Once you have got the
powder, go back to Kandin and give just the powder to him.&nbsp; He will then
give you the Staff of Gabstik.&nbsp; After he gives you the staff, give him
Kandin's Bag.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Kandin Firepot says 'Great! Give this to Arantir so he knows you've helped
me! Hey! Have you seen my lantern anywhere?</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>There is now a new way you can get the Staff
of Gabstik and the note to Arantir.&nbsp; This is a quest that I read up on at
Graffe's.&nbsp; Instead of handing Kandin the note from Arantir, hail him:</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>You say, 'hail Kandin Firepot'</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Kandin Firepot says 'Hello, there! Don't
have time to talk. I'm workin', workin', workin'! Careful! Don't slip in the
oil!<br>
</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>You say, 'what oil?'<br>
</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Kandin Firepot says 'Ah the oil! I recently
sent a specially crafted golem to explore through a huge portal to another
plane. It's instructions were to collect special oil that I suspect existed in
the plane. What I think is the golem broke down. This looks like a good task for
one like you. Go see what's wrong with the golem. Here is spare gears of mine
incase it's broken. Be careful though, if you put it in wrong it could explode
or worse!</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The golem he speaks of is called a broken
golem in the Plane of Fear.&nbsp; His location is-720, -109.&nbsp; Give him the
spare gears from Kandin:</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>an enraged golem says 'Error! Malfunction!
Destroy!<br>
an enraged golem says 'Warriors like you always bring out the worst in me.'</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Now in the place of the broken golem is an
enraged golem.&nbsp; He double hits for 400 and has around 150k hit points.&nbsp;
You will need many casters and tanks.&nbsp; Use fire damage spells and the lure
line.&nbsp; He does not cast.&nbsp; When he dies, loot the green oil from his
corpse.&nbsp; Return this to Kandin.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Kandin Firepot says 'Oh wow! You found the
oil! Where is the golem? You didn't hurt him did you? I am very fond of him.
Anyways, here is your reward a note and staff to give to that guy you were
asking me about.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>You will now have the note to Arantir and
the Staff of Gabstik.</b></font></p>

three you possess and I'll combine them with my own.&quot;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Now give Arantir all of the three staves, the Blue Crystal Staff, the
Gnarled Staff, and the Staff of Gabstik.&nbsp; MAKE SURE THEY ARE THE RIGHT
