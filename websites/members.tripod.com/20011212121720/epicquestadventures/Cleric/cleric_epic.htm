Quest<br>
</B></font><b><font face="Verdana" size="4"><u>Orb of Frozen Water</u></font></B></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The Quest starts in Lake Rathe
wear you must kill a named water goblin, Lord Bergurgle.&nbsp; He spawns in the
underwater goblin cave, in the tower at (2800, 150).&nbsp; He is around level 40
and casts Complete Heal on himself.&nbsp; He is a rare spawn on a 28 minutes
spawn time with a placeholder.&nbsp; The Deepwater Goblins spawn around him so
have some companions come along with you and remember Endure Breath.&nbsp; He
drops Lord Bergurgle's Crown.&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b> Take the crown to Shmendrik Lavawalker
(3600, 0) who spawns once every 3 hours.&nbsp; Stay at his spawn spot because he
is level 30 so someone might kill him if you are not there.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you
give it to him he will give you Oil of Fennin Ro and Natasha Whitewater will
spawn.&nbsp; Natasha will kill Shmendrik, causing a spirit of flame to spawn
immediately on his corpse.&nbsp; Kill this level 40 spirit of flame who has
approximately 3300 hitpoints.&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b> Loot the Damaged Goblin Crown from
him.&nbsp; Natasha will also try to kill her so just root, enstill, mesmerize,
or do something that will keep her out of the fight because if she gets killing
blow it may cause corpse to disappear.&nbsp; The safest way to do this (but more
time consuming) is to first just kill Shmendrik without giving him the Lord
Bergurgle's Crown, then kill spirit of the flame and loot the Damaged Goblin
Crown.&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b> Then wait for Shmendrik to spawn again, give him Lord Bergurgle's
Crown, kill the spirit of flame and give Natasha the Damaged Goblin Crown you
already have.&nbsp; Well anyways, after giving Natasha the Damaged Goblin Crown,
she will give you Ornate Sea Shell.&nbsp; Take this Ornate Sea Shell to Omat
Vastsea in Timorous Deep (-11567, -2227). To reach him, take the cave entrance
at loc (-11530, -3728), then the entrance at (-11336, -1307).<o:p>
&nbsp; He will give you a Coral Statue of Tarew.&nbsp; Take this Coral Statue to
a seeker in the Temple of Solusek Ro.&nbsp; He is at (326,38,29) and will spawn
at 9 A.M. and despawn at 9 P.M. game time.&nbsp; <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"></o:p>
&nbsp;
</span> </B></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b> When you give it to him, he will take it and change into a Plasmatic
Priest and start attacking you.&nbsp; He hits in the high hundreds and has
3000-3500 hit points.&nbsp; He is level 55 and casts Complete Heal, Tremor,
Annul Magic, Reckoning.&nbsp; You should always bring him to the zone before
attacking him because his Area Effect Tremor makes the keepers around him attack
him and if they get the kill then you loose the corpse and you must start
over.&nbsp; Once you have killed him, loot his Blood Soaked Plasmatic
Robe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b> Now go to Solusek A and kill Lord Grimblox.&nbsp; He is a rare spawn
on a 19 minute spawn timer will a placeholder (Either Large Fire Goblin or Fire
Goblin Shaman).&nbsp; He is only level 30 and shouldn't be hard to kill.&nbsp;
Loot his Lord Grimblox's Signet Ring.&nbsp; Now, take the Blood Soaked Plasmatic
Robe to Omat Vastsea, causing him to give you Orb of Frozen Water and making
Natasha Whitewater spawn again, in Timorous Deep.</B></font></p>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana" size="4"><u>Orb of Clear Water</u></font></B></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Immediately after giving Omat
Vastea the Robe, run to Natasha Whitewater in a house close to Omat.&nbsp; Give
her Lord Grimblox's Signet Ring and she will give you a second Ornate Sea
Shell.&nbsp;&nbsp; Take this Sea Shell to Naxot Deepwater in Burning
Woods.&nbsp; His location is (3400, -2150).<o:p>
&nbsp; He spawns there at 6 P.M. gametime and despawns at 6 A.M.&nbsp; He will
give you a Message to Natasha.&nbsp; Now you must kill Ixiblat Fir.&nbsp; This
is a level 62 immense Fire Elemental.&nbsp; Hit hits for up to 575 damage and
has over 32000 hit points.&nbsp; He spawns in the Burning Wood at (-2000, 1500)<o:p>
.&nbsp; He casts a 300 damage Area Effect fire based spell.&nbsp; This spell is
immune to fire elementals.&nbsp; His magic resistance is average to below
average for his level.&nbsp; His is not completely immune to fire based spells
but it is recommended that you use cold based magic.&nbsp; Once he is gotten
down to low health, he will try to run.&nbsp; Try and keep him still because he
has a fast regeneration rate.&nbsp; Loot off of him Sceptre of Ixiblat
Fir.&nbsp; This drops every time.&nbsp; Now you have to kill the Overking
Bathezid Di'Zok.&nbsp; This level 63 sarnak spawns in Chardok and takes a load
of people to kill.&nbsp; He casts a 500 damage Area Effect spell, complete heal,
gravity flux, and gate.&nbsp; You have to be careful when killing him.&nbsp; If
you fight him at his spawning location you must be careful that he you don't
aggro the Queen and you also have to be careful that he doesn't cast Gravity
Flux.&nbsp; That will aggro more mobs in upstairs rooms such as the
Herbalist.&nbsp; You can also fight him in the hallway but then you have to be
careful he doesn't Gate.&nbsp; Then he will start summoning people and they will
die.&nbsp; Loot from him a Singed Scroll which drops every time.&nbsp; Take the
Singed Scroll and Sceptre of Ixiblat Fir to Omat Vastsea.&nbsp; He will give you
the Orb of Clear Water and Natasha Whitewater will spawn again.&nbsp; </B></font></p>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana" size="4"><u><span style="font-family: Arial"><o:p>Orb
of Vapor</span></u></font></B></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Run straight to Natasha
Whitewater after doing the previous step.&nbsp; Give her the Message to
Natasha.&nbsp; You will receive the shimmering pearl.&nbsp; Now comes the most
what most clerics agree to be the most tedious part of the quest, killing Zordak
Ragefire.&nbsp; This is a dragon found in Solusek B.&nbsp; Although no one is absolutely
certain about how Zordak spawns, it is thought that he spawns 1-3 days after
Nagafen has been killed.&nbsp; There is usually always a cleric camping him so
you must be quick in getting the camp.&nbsp; Also, keep a small group with you
to clear the fire giants.&nbsp; They roam into the lair and when you are
fighting Zordak, you will not want to deal with any other mobs.&nbsp; Give him the shimmering
pearl.&nbsp; He will then switch to level 55 and attack you.&nbsp; Once you kill
him, his true dragon form, Zordakalicus Ragefire, a level 54 dragon.&nbsp; He is
an exact duplicate of Nagafen except that he runs at low health and hits
slightly harder.&nbsp; All the
normal Nagafen tactics apply.&nbsp; Loot from his corpse Heart of Zordak
Ragefire and give it to Omat Vastsea.&nbsp;</font></B></p>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana" size="4"><u>Water Sprinkler of Nem
Ankh</u></font></B></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">After the last step, Jhassad
Oceanson will spawn close to Omat.&nbsp; Give Jhassad the three orbs: Orb of
Frozen Water, Orb of Water, and Orb of Vapor.&nbsp; He will return to you Orb of
Triumvirate and the Avatar of Water will spawn near Jhassad by the shore.&nbsp;
He will then roam around the shore and finally come to stand next to
Jhassad.&nbsp; It is recommended that you wait for the Avatar of Water to stand
next to Jhassad because then you will get experience when you turn in the
Orb.&nbsp; If you give it to him while he is on his roam path, you will get no
experience and obviously the experience bonus is a lot since this is an Epic
Quest.&nbsp; Turn in the Orb of Triumvirate to the Avatar of Water.&nbsp; He
will give you the Water Sprinkler of Nem Ankh.&nbsp; </font></B></p>
