<p><em>&quot;Master Xornn,&quot; said Jakonis, beginning a question during his training,
&quot;you teach me of controlling my enemies and manipulating my environment...&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>Xornn made no indication of hearing Jakonis, but nodded to no one in particular as
he looked over the rocky crags of the Dreadlands.</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;But you say very little about my accentuations I've learned... when do I cast
haste on whom?&nbsp; What is more important, mana or speed when my own mana is tight?
&nbsp; Should I use my armoring spells of protection?&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>Xornn continued to scan the edges of the rising mountains, apparently occupied with
whatever he was looking for.&nbsp; Jakonis thought of repeating his question, but knew
that somewhere inside, deep down, Xornn had already answered... it just hadn't gotten to
the surface yet.&nbsp; When Xornn snapped his gaze to Jakonis, he felt himself flinch, and
bit down on his tongue to hide a smile--master had such a flare for the dramatic.</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Does your fighter have haste?&nbsp; If not, grant it upon them.&nbsp; When
both mana and haste are lacking, are the tanks fighting--or are the healers low on mana
reserves?&nbsp; Cast accordingly.&nbsp; If you aren't doing anything, and your armor
spells are faded, cast them.&quot;&nbsp; Xornn looked at Jakonis sternly. &nbsp;
&quot;Really, apprentice, you have a habit of answering your own questions.&quot;</em></p>

<hr>

<p>This will be a short section, as there's only one real rule to buffing people...
well... two.</p>

<p>First, get crowd control done.&nbsp; Second, if the buff in question will appreciably
aid the target, cast it.&nbsp; Mana regen is always good for anyone that uses mana. &nbsp;
Haste is a must for those in melee combat.&nbsp; Magic resistance is a given for yourself,
and if there are casters among your enemies then your group needs it too. &nbsp;
Intelligence and Wisdom buffs raise maximum mana, but aren't terribly important when mana
is tight, because they aren't doing anything then.&nbsp; Armor class buffs can ease the
clerics mana load when needed, and things like vision or stamina regen are just spells you
cast as needed.</p>

<p>Buffing is recognizing a need or spot to be improved, and casting the spell to
accomplish that.&nbsp; The only other trick to buffing is remembering when it needs
refreshed, and planning mana around that.&nbsp; For most spells, you can buff yourself
with it first so you get a reminder to refresh it.&nbsp; Spells the whole group will
receive or that have high mana cost (that you need to med up for--like hasting tanks)
should be tracked on an egg timer or such to remind you when it's time to start getting
ready for that buff session.&nbsp; Buffing isn't hard, it's just an important
priority--which is why many enchanters can get by just on buffing alone.</p>
