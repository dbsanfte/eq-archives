<p><em>A swirling breeze of calm and serenity overwhelmed Xornn as new mana flooded his
mind.&nbsp; The cleric's meditations visibly relaxed as the spell floated over him, and
the high elf returned to the fight at hand.&nbsp; A flooding wash of glamour pulled
hungrily at his mana reserves, but was necessary to hold the massive juggernaught at bay
while the party battled another.&nbsp; Xornn felt his shielding wane, and quickly began
the long spell of renewal as another juggernaught raced in from behind the party!</em></p>

<p><em>Interrupting his casting and cascading a glamour into the new opponent the old
enchanter called out, &quot;Warriors!&nbsp; Hasten your fight, my hold is strong, not
invincible!&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>As he renewed the glamour on the first juggernaught, Xornn felt the end of his mana
approaching, but quickly drained the fungus priest dazzled behind him.&nbsp; This was
still a losing situation.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>Welcome to the most pivotal post-50 level, as you finally gain access to Clarity II.
&nbsp; You felt the desire of Breeze, and the rushing demand for Clarity.&nbsp; Now you
will wonder how you ever enjoyed enchanting without Clarity II.&nbsp; 54th is also the
first &quot;double-hell&quot; level.&nbsp; You will now level at roughly half the speed of
a 51-53 character.&nbsp; This will continue through 58, and at 59... well let's worry
about 54, shall we?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Spells</strong></p>

<p><strong>Clarity II - </strong>The final upgrade in the mana regen series, and the
qualifier to get you on any raid that takes place.&nbsp; 115 mana to cast, 35 minute
duration, and grants 11 mana/tic regen!&nbsp; There's really nothing else to say about
this spell--it's a must have at all times.</p>

<p><strong>Dementia - </strong>Final upgrade in the nuke series, 250 mana, 6 second
casting time, and the traditional 8 second recast.&nbsp; This spell will start out at 615
damage, and cap at 675.&nbsp; Not a huge upgrade over Discordant Mind, but when you're in
need of just nuking something, this is a nice way to put it down.</p>

<p><strong>Glamour of Kintaz - </strong>A new mez line that allows you to mez some targets
that cannot be mezzed with Dazzle and before.&nbsp; Even when Dazzle will work, you may
wish to used GoK instead; 275 whopping mana, 2.5 second casting time, and no recast delay.
&nbsp; This nets you a 30 second mez effect, cast as though you're two levels higher
(starting out as a 56 cast), and slightly less resistant than a 56 enchanter's Dazzle.
&nbsp; While this is a <em>huge</em> mana investment to keep going, when there's a
sebilite juggernaught pounding on your party, GoK is often the way to go.&nbsp; In places
like Chardok there are mobs that can <em>only</em> be mezzed with GoK or it's father
spell, Rapture.&nbsp; Much like the &quot;switchover&quot; tactic with AE Mezzing, you may
find that GoK chased with Tashania and Root is a good tactic to spare your mana the brunt
of this drain.&nbsp; Remember, for 100 more mana than Dazzle, you're getting 1/3 of the
duration.&nbsp; Still this is a fantastic spell for stopping I high-powered mob from
crushing your party.&nbsp; In situations where a resist means death, GoK is a good idea.</p>

<p><strong>Shield of the Magi - </strong>Final upgrade in the self-shielding line.
&nbsp; Grants 250 HP, 32 Raw AC, and ?? MR.&nbsp; With a 12 second casting time, be glad
you only have to renew it every 90 minutes.&nbsp; Should be up all the time, unless there
is no chance you need to resist magic, and a shaman can talisman you then (don't stack).</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Buffs-Solo - </strong>I myself run with Clarity II, Shield of the Magi, and
JourneymanBoots (if you don't have JBoots yet, go get them).&nbsp; When charming, tack on
Ardorning Grace, if I need MR Group Resist Magic goes on.</p>

<p><strong>Buffs-Group - </strong>C2 all mana users, AQ on the melees, GRM on the group.
&nbsp; Shield of the Magi, Adorning Grace and Brilliance on myself,
Brilliance/Insight/Gift of Magic passed out to those that request it.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Tactics Changes</strong></p>

<p><strong>Solo - </strong>A few things you will discover (if you haven't already) about
soloing:&nbsp; Your animation is just too weak to take down an XP mob, outside of
Kamikaze-Stun, which is a massive investment of time and mana at this point.&nbsp; Charm
soloing is getting very dangerous, as the difference between a recharmed ex-pet and a
greasy enchanter goo on the wall is sometimes just a particularly well-timed bash.
&nbsp; Better break out the platinum and start using Rune V if you aren't already for
charm soloing.&nbsp; Mez-Kiting is a forgotten art by now... because of the investment in
time and mana--we just aren't efficient enough to drop these colosally big mobs.
&nbsp; Honestly Charm-Solo is the only really viable option anymore, though there are xp
mobs out there Mr. Kamikaze can still drop.&nbsp; They just aren't the norm anymore.</p>

<p><strong>Group - </strong>New mana regen, new high-powered mez, new self-shield... it's
a great time to be grouping, and with C2 you're going to get invited pretty much anywhere.
&nbsp; The only advice I offer is to recognize your limits--there are places where you are
going to have a <em>very</em> hard time controlling the crowds, but you're there because
of the buffs you bring to the party.&nbsp; GoK is your friend, despite the mana cost.</p>

<hr>

<p>The 17th Circle is my current home as of this writing, though hopefully that will
change in the very near future.&nbsp; I wish you all the best of luck, and tell you
this--you're almost a Beguiler, and despite what higher enchanters may tell you about the
enjoyment of 55+, don't listen to them--find out for yourself.&nbsp; There's more to EQ
than just raiding and buffing--and that's something you have to see for yourself.
&nbsp; Spending a night in Chardok is far from boring--ever.</p>
