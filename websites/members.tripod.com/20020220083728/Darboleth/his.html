was just a young boy when my parents were brutally murdered.&nbsp; I still
have distant memories of the tragety...they were slain right in front of
me by a horde of vicious barbarians.&nbsp; Many other innocent dark elves
died to the barbarian tribe...including some of my closest friends. I was
fortunate enough to escape the wrath of the savages...soon I shall avenge
my family's death, that day shall be a great day indeed.</FONT><FONT SIZE=+0></FONT>

my family's death, I had nowhere else to go.&nbsp; With no money in my
pockets I was forced to steal and burgularize houses just to stay alive
put food on the table.&nbsp; I became well known for my expertise in my
secretive art and I would sometimes get a wealthy merchant interested in
some sort of unique item.&nbsp; That item, of course, belonged to someone
else and it was my job to "retrieve" it. Those jobs paid well, exteremly
well...</FONT><FONT SIZE=+0></FONT>

L</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+0>ater in life I formed a small band of thieves,
mercenaries, bandits, and even a few spellcasters.&nbsp; This sudden unification
became very popular among the darker folk of the city.&nbsp; Many wanted
into the secretive group, but only few were able to join.&nbsp; My comrades
and I named the group Azuviir, which was the same name of a dark elven
house long forgotten and long lost in the deep histories of the dark elves.&nbsp;
Azuviir often aided Neriak, accompanying dark elven war bands that raided
various human and other surface dwelling settlements.&nbsp; Azuviir soon
became praised among the common folk of Neriak, but little was known about
the house itself and its members.&nbsp; Azuviir instilled hope among its
people by destroying some of their most dangerous, and hated, enemies.&nbsp;
The members of Azuviir that were exteremly skilled in the art of stealth
and combat sometimes sucessfully assassinated Wood-Elf council members,
Barbarian chieftains, and other important figures among the surface dwellers.&nbsp;
These assassinations often halted our enemies plans and brought further
hope to our race..</FONT></TD>
