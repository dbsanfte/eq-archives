<p><em>Rhedd was rooting around in the ground near a bush looking for some food to cram
into her pack, like always, and Xornn stood to haste his animation again.&nbsp; Broon, the
mighty cyclops, would be coming up to the canyon mouth any minute now, from the word given
by the ranger that had spotted him from high on the lip of the pass to Highhold.&nbsp; As
Xornn sat back down, the druid shouted that Broon was in sight, and Xornn resigned to
study his tome of magic another time.</em></p>

<p><em>Broon hadn't spotted them yet, but his huge tree-trunk legs were chewing up the
ground in earth shaking strides.&nbsp; Xornn calmly waited for the right moment, then
stepped out from behind the rocks to cast Tashani on the lumbering hulk.&nbsp; As Broon
sensed the attack he set into a charge, but Rhedds snaring magic slowed the run to a
crawling gait.&nbsp; Quickly the animation was upon the cyclops and Xornn altered Broon's
perceptions into that of fear, as he turned to flee his obvious death (somewhat magically
inspired) but found the druid's spell rendering his flight into a slow motion escapade
from a dream sequence.&nbsp; Then it got harder to breath and winds began to violently
take hardened form and whip away his flesh in peels...</em></p>

<hr>

<p>By this point you have probably caught onto something--the method you use to advance
further in your enchanting career changes very little now.&nbsp; Only the tools available
to you.&nbsp; Should you choose to perform crowd control in groups, solo kamikaze-style,
kite (or reverse) with a steady partner, or truly show nerves of steel with daring
charm-solos, you have seen the avenues lain before the enchanter, and gotten a feel for
the spell lines required for each, as well as learned to manage your eight spell slots
well.&nbsp; From the Fifth Circle on, it's pretty much only upgrades to your current
arsenal.&nbsp; My presentation style will change now, with less hand-holding explanations,
more commentation on spell upgrades, and tactics broke into sections with summaries of
changes to previous usage.&nbsp; Without further ado, let's examine this Circle's
additions.</p>

<p><strong>Benevolence - </strong><em>Upgrade to Alliance.&nbsp; I take Dubious mobs to
Indifferent with this spell, and Apprehensive to Amiable.&nbsp; Combined with the proper
race combination, you can go pretty much anywhere, and even complete most quests--even
ones not intended for your race/class!</em></p>

<p><strong>Berzerker Strength - </strong><em>+25STR by 30th, and 50HP Shield by 60th.
&nbsp; Targetted spell costs 40 mana, and honestly sees little to no use.&nbsp; With a
short duration of three minutes or when the HP Shield is used up, plus the AGI decrease
effectively lowering the target's AC by 5, Strengthen is really just a better spell,
especially when you can cast Strengthen 5 times for only 5 more mana than this spell, and
neither really have a lasting impact by this level.&nbsp; Back of the book spell here.
&nbsp; Research spell with Tasarins Grimoire page 30 left &amp; right.</em></p>

<p><strong>Calm - </strong><em>Upgrade in the Lull series.&nbsp; Collector's spell, though
of some use on </em>very<em> green mobs.</em></p>

<p><strong>Cloud - </strong><em>Upgrade in the Haze series.&nbsp; Caps at +11AC by 25th.
&nbsp; Clerics and Shamans have a better AC buffs than this by now, but when they aren't
around this does nicely, or when trying to save the cleric some mana.</em></p>

<p><strong>Color Shift - </strong><em>One of your uber-spells.&nbsp; Upgrade to Color
Flux, as well as key piece of one of the last techniques the enchanter must learn,
stun-locking.&nbsp; At 40 mana, this 1.5 second casting time stuns a larger area (25 foot
diameter) of mobs for 6 seconds, for 40 mana.&nbsp; Combined with the 20 mana and 4 second
stun of Color Flux, you can basically stun a mob for 10 seconds using only 60 mana. &nbsp;
During that 10 seconds, the melee damage to the mob isn't being answered (the tanks aren't
getting hit back), which the tanks </em>love<em>.&nbsp; The area of effect is much larger
than Color Flux, and you must learn how far is safe... but about a small room is the
radius.&nbsp;&nbsp; Research spell with Tasarins Grimoire page 312 left &amp; right.</em></p>

<p><strong>Crystallize Mana - </strong><em>Used to make... well... I've never actually
cast the spell.&nbsp; Just bought it from the Brownies in Lesser Faedark and scribed it to
complete my collection.&nbsp; It makes something for some obscure armor quest I was once
told, but I honestly never cared to check.</em></p>

<p><strong>Endure Magic - </strong><em>As you encounter more and more spell-casting mobs
you are going to fall in love with this targetted buff.&nbsp; Raises Magic Resistance +20.
&nbsp; Research spell with Tasarins Grimoire page 375 left &amp; right, or obtain at
Cleric Guild.</em></p>

<p><strong>Feckless Might - </strong><em>Upgrade to Ebbing Strength, -30STR cap at 28th.
&nbsp; While a full debuff spread is quite impressive by the numbers, this pure STR debuff
will do little to nothing to impact a fight.&nbsp;&nbsp; While the number of full strength
hits a mob inflicts will be reduced slightly, casting Choke once will shorten the fight
enough to duplicate it's impact.&nbsp; I still suggest not bothering with it outside of
dueling situations (which still I don't recommend it unless you just want to humiliate
someone).&nbsp; You'll blow half your mana or more to debuff a mob with a full spread,
then struggle to outrace your pet with the rest.&nbsp; In a group, blowing mana this
frivilously is out of the question.&nbsp; Debuffing STR has its place in the enchanting
way--Player vs Player.</em></p>

<p><strong>Illusion: Iksar - </strong><em>This spell is obtained through a long and
difficult quest in Kunark.&nbsp; I bought the spell from a very high level enchanter, and
honestly until you reach the Ninth or Tenth Circle, you have little chance of getting this
spell without a lot of assistance.&nbsp; After two weeks and three deaths in Kunark, I
only obtained 2 of the 4 quest components before breaking down and purchasing the spell.
&nbsp; (Infravision &amp; cool-looking)</em></p>

<p><strong>Illusion: Ogre - </strong><em>The Ogre cannot be stunned from the front.
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Infravision)</em></p>

<p><strong>Illusion: Troll - </strong><em>Troll form gains regeneration and infravision.
&nbsp; Bear in mind this regeneration is 1HP per tic, standing or sitting. &nbsp;&nbsp;
Over the course of 36 minutes, you will receive 360HP.&nbsp; (Assuming you never hit full
health.)&nbsp; Still, regen is regen, just don't expect to be blown away.)</em></p>

<p><strong>Shifting Sight - </strong><em>This spell is the same as Bind Sight, only you
have Infravision when you use it.</em></p>

<p><strong>Sisna's Animation - </strong><em>Meet your latest damage factory. &nbsp;&nbsp;
Requiring 3 Tiny Daggers again, the last of the &quot;axe&quot; series can be expected to
have maximum damage outputs of 14 to 22, depending on its level.&nbsp; If you can,
resummon till you get the 20 to 22 hitter--it will make a huge difference in not only the
damage per hit, but the higher level pet hits </em>more<em>.&nbsp; This animation also
gains the ability to Kick, and double attacks just about every round.&nbsp; Double-slash,
bash-kick, double-slash, double-slash, bash-kick.&nbsp; That's what this things fighting
looks like now.&nbsp; With Quicken it brings tears to your eyes.</em></p>

<p><strong>Sympathetic Aura - </strong><em>The first of our Charisma buffs!&nbsp; +18CHA
cap at 24th, and really helps boost your CHA without needing equipment, and more
importantly helps lower resists with charm and mezzing, even if only minorly.&nbsp; This
and Breeze were always buffed on me, even when just travelling.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tashani - </strong><em>The upgrade to Tashan, giving -23MR by level 26, and a
mana cost of 20, while retaining the 1 second cast time.&nbsp; This spell is a welcome
addition to our easily resisted nukes we carry in our spellbooks.</em></p>

<hr align="center">

<p>Strategies and changes to those strategies are listed below, but first let me start
with an analysis of stun-locks.</p>

<p>Stun-Locking has a multitude of uses, all of which I will mention below, and it also
offers almost a complete soloing ability by itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here however, I'm just
going to explain how stun-locking is accomplished.&nbsp;&nbsp; Color Flux has a 1 second
cast for a 4 second stun.&nbsp; Color Shift is 1.5 second cast for 6 seconds of stun.
&nbsp; Both have a re-cast delay of 12 seconds.&nbsp; Drop Color Flux, and when the spells
become available to cast, you have around 2 seconds to cast.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you can wait
just a split-second, then cast Color Shift, then you land the six second stun right as the
Flux wears off, leaving the mob unable to move still.&nbsp; Now if you truly landed the
spell perfectly, the stun will go out to a 10 second duration, meaning that Color Flux is
just becoming available as the stun lifts.&nbsp; Typically the mob will get one swing,
then the stun lands again.&nbsp; Stun-Locking causes a very large amount of aggro in the
mob (stuns do this), and I will discuss this in each tactic area stun-locks are used.
&nbsp; After much practice, I am able to restrict a mob to a maximum of one &quot;attack
tick&quot; every ten seconds, for 60 mana every round of stunning.&nbsp; Oftentimes, I
actually re-establish the lock before the mob's &quot;attack tic&quot; occurs (as
apparently your tic for when to swing runs even when stunned), making for a seamless stun.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not believe that you can chain-stun without ever giving the mob a swing,
though.&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 seconds + 6 seconds = 10 seconds.&nbsp; You need 13 seconds for it
to be a total stun-lock, as after Color Flux ungreys (12 seconds of stun later), you still
have the 1 second casting time.</p>

<p>I can't emphasize just how powerful this is.&nbsp; Now let's look at your tactics.</p>

<hr align="center">

<p>First a look at your buffs.&nbsp; When Solo, you should carry Breeze, Sympathetic Aura,
Cloud, Shielding up.&nbsp; Your pet should have Strengthen, Cloud, Quicken.&nbsp; (You
might drop Strengthen on yourself too.&nbsp; You aren't ever meleeing anymore, but it
doesn't hurt to have 10 STR to help with encumberance, and you already memmed it to put on
your pet, too.&nbsp; Quicken is going to have to be renewed frequently, and you might as
well just set a spell slot aside for it unless you really like memming spells.&nbsp; I'm
used to switching spells a lot, even three or four times during battle, but I still don't
like it.)&nbsp; Group buffing will be a little different; you need Breeze and Sympathetic
Aura up at all times, and you should find the time to drop Shielding.&nbsp; Cloud will
most likely be surpassed by another AC buffer (such as Cleric or Shaman) and let them fill
this role when they can--otherwise Cloud goes on anyone who is supposed to be taking
damage.&nbsp; Strengthen on anyone that is going to melee (often covered by Shamans as
well), and Quicken on whichever party members will be meleeing... as it's going to be your
most profound damage assistance.</p>

<p><strong>Kamikaze-Solo - </strong><em>The traditional Kamikaze-Solo still entails taking
your Quickened pet, pulling a mob with Tashani (always blue, less downtime, easier fight,
great experience), take a shot to put the pet in, drop Languid Pace, Sanity Warp, tank
till you take a decent hit, then Flux/Root and back out, then Sanity Warp till Root
breaks, re-Flux/re-Root, and continue till the mob dies.&nbsp; You and your pet don't take
too much damage, you easily outrace your pet, and mana used will return at about the same
rate your pet heals.&nbsp; Using this method, whenever I had the mana to take something
on, my pet had the health too.&nbsp; I love Kamikaze-Solo, and to this day, I still use
it.&nbsp; Stun-Locking can be used if the fight is going poorly and your pet is looking
really tore up, by just stepping in and Stun-Locking as long as you can.&nbsp; Bear in
mind that the aggro from stun-locking will make your pet unable to taunt the mob off you
in all likelihood, but it will keep your pet alive, and you have to take one shot every
ten seconds.&nbsp; Not bad.&nbsp; There is a whole new solo-ability based on this, which
I'll cover later on.&nbsp; Basically, the only change to Kamikaze-Solo is the use of
Tashani over Tashan, and the ability to Stun-Lock in a jam, which will apply for the rest
of your career.&nbsp; Spell Lineup - Sanity Warp, Choke/Chaotic Feedback, Color Flux,
Root, Enthrall, Languid Pace, Tashani, Swap Slot.&nbsp;&nbsp; Color Shift often replaces
Choke/Chaotic Feedback for full stunlocking, and Memory Blur over Languid Pace..</em></p>

<p><strong>Reverse-Kite-Partner - </strong><em>I won't mention Kite-Solo anymore, because
anytime your partner can snare you should Reverse-Kite.&nbsp; Your pet equals not only a
damage factory, but consider it an unresistable DOT that costs you the life needed to get
it fighting.&nbsp; That's worth it.&nbsp; You Tashani, they Snare, you take a hit, then
Chase the Moon.&nbsp; Nuke if you're wanting to speed things, but with a decent CHA Chase
the Moon will hold for ages and ages.&nbsp; I usually just plod along after the mob
dropping Chase the Moon when it fades, and toward the end of the fight, just nuke it to
finish (when it would be a waste to fear again).&nbsp; Necromancer's Fear isn't as good as
Chase the Moon (they pass our ability in the Ninth Circle, and we catch up in the Tenth
again), and the Clinging Darkness series of movement impeding isn't as effective as Snare.
&nbsp;&nbsp; However, pets follow the slightly faster mob with ease, and the Darkness line
is a DOT.&nbsp; Druids and Necromancers are always going to be amazing partners for
enchanters.&nbsp; Spell lineup:&nbsp; Sanity Warp, Choke, Color Flux, Root, Enthral, Chase
the Moon, Tashani, Swap Slot</em></p>

<p><strong>Group-Tactics - </strong><em>In the group, you take on a whole new role:
Stun-Lock.&nbsp; First off, let me talk about Quicken.&nbsp; For <u>80 mana</u> you grant
a 30% attack speed increase to one group member for a short duration.&nbsp; If you're just
dropping Tashani and Languid Pace on incoming mobs, this is worth it, as you'll be doing
crowd control and meditating at all times.&nbsp; Dropping that single Languid Pace is also
the equivalent of dropping Quicken on your entire group of melee members, but you will
have to do this for every pull.&nbsp; If there are three people in the melee, you can
often skip Languid Pace, because with three tanks you'll be casting Languid too often, and
a quick stun lock will totally stop damage for 10 seconds at the same mana usage, which
will be more effective than Languid Pace.&nbsp; But, with Languid you can med during the
fight.&nbsp; What it boils down to is how much mana you have to play with.&nbsp; Now I've
mentioned stun-locking twice so far, and let me explain when you do and don't use it.</em></p>

<p><em>During any fight where mezzing is required, get that taken care of first.
&nbsp;&nbsp; It's your primary goal.&nbsp; After that's taken care of, your second goal is
to make sure people are buffed.&nbsp; Then make sure to land Tashani if any spells are
going to be thrown at it.&nbsp; Languid Pace needs to find their way onto whichever mob is
being fought when it will be of use--but if it's almost dead before crowd control is taken
care of, just let them finish it, and meditate.&nbsp; Don't feel like you haven't done
your part; if you hadn't mezzed the extra mob or two, they would be hitting the tanks--or
even the casters--which is much more damage prevented than Languid Pace would have done.</em></p>

<p><em>However, on a single-mob fight, when it's safe to (you learn quickly when Color
Shift will aggro mobs not in the fight--the range isn't </em>that<em> big, though), you
drop Tashani on the mob, then step in and begin to stun-lock.&nbsp; Two amazing things
will happen; first, you will watch the tanks rip through the mob without taking any
damage.&nbsp; Second, the aggro you build from stunning won't matter, as it continues
staying aggro to the tanks.&nbsp; Consider this:&nbsp; Stunning for 10 seconds, with just
my pet and Muadan, the 30th paladin I traveled with usually, Muadan will inflict about 200
damage over that ten seconds, and my pet will do about 150 (this doesn't include
Augmentation, an attack speed buff that lasts 30 minutes).&nbsp; That's 350 damage
inflicted for 60 mana, during which the tanks took no damage--that makes stun-locking the
equivalent of an uber-nuke.&nbsp; The mob will then take </em>one<em> swing at Muadan,
then the lock re-establishes, for another 350.&nbsp; Each bubble of mana I have as High
Apprentice of the Eighth Circle represents around 175 mana.&nbsp; I can stun for 30
seconds (getting over 1000 damage on the mob) and use one bubble of mana.&nbsp; This is
just with a paladin and my pet--I hope you can see the amazing power of stun-locking.</em></p>

<p><em>Needless to say, don't bother with Languid Pace in a stun-locking situation.
&nbsp;&nbsp; If you wish to become adept at stun-locking, I'll tell you how I did. &nbsp;
First I found a Deathfist Pawn and cast Tashani to pull him.&nbsp; I then sat there and
practiced holding the lock on him.&nbsp; When you run out of mana, kill it, and scroll
back to see how many cycles of stunning you had, and how mana swings the mob took. &nbsp;
When you get good there is one attack round before Flux lands again.</em></p>

<p><em>Spell Lineup: Mesmerization, Color Shift, Color Flux, Root, Enthrall, Languid Pace,
Swap Slot.&nbsp; Mesmerization often replaces Sanity Warp, as you won't be nuking mobs
while grouped much anymore..&nbsp; Charm can often be swapped in over Languid Pace or into
the Swap as well when you plan to do full bore crowd control.</em></p>

<p><strong>Charm-Solo - </strong><em>Tashani is a beautiful addition to Charm-Soloing, and
one you will love with.&nbsp; Keeping Color Shift instead of Flux memmed will buy you an
extra two seconds for regaining control, though it's typically not needed--during
charm-solo you want the faster casting time of Color Flux.&nbsp; Stun-Locking can be used
to make sure your pet wins the fight when it's close, but I recommend against that because
Charm breaking right after you stun can make regaining control very difficult.&nbsp; Just
nuke it if it looks close.&nbsp; Soon you will have a longer casting time charm spell, and
then Color Shift will be mandatory.&nbsp; Spell Lineup:&nbsp; Sanity Warp, Charm, Color
Flux, Root, Enthrall/Mesmerize, Languid Pace, Tashani, Swap Slot (Rune I)</em></p>

<p>Now after all your patience, I give you what I find to be our most powerful and <em>reliable</em>
solo-technique to date:</p>

<p><strong>Kamikaze-Stun-Solo - </strong><em>That's right, take Kamikaze ability of fast,
free damage from your pet, and combine it with the cheap damage prevention of Stun-Lock.
&nbsp;&nbsp; The end result is that you have a highly effective, mana efficient method to
drop steady blues.&nbsp; However, you will </em>not<em> be outracing your pet, which is
why I avoided this technique for so long.&nbsp; The idea of Memory Blur and Nuking to
outrace your pet doesn't interest me, as the little damage factory can often outrace you
before the long casting time of the nuke finishes.</em></p>

<p><em>Instead, you should just nuke during the fight.</em></p>

<p><em>Tashani pull, then get your pet behind the mob, and Color Flux, then Color
Shift--your pet is hitting for great damage, and you're waiting for Color Flux to ungrey.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rather than just standing there, after Color Shift finishes, you've got 6
seconds before Color Flux will be available to cast.&nbsp; Sanity Warp takes 3 seconds to
cast.&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as Shift lands I just fire off Sanity Warp.&nbsp; Now, when the
stun lifts the mob </em>will<em> be aggro to you for sure, and your pet is tagging it in
the back, which we know is always good.&nbsp; Color Flux, Color Shift, Sanity Warp.
&nbsp;&nbsp; The nukes assures that you outrace your pet, while the stun-lock keeps your
pet healthy.&nbsp; If you Flux/Root, your pet is getting hit the entire time you're
nuking.&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea is that you nuke the mob out before your pet dies.&nbsp; In
this technique, your pet hits for more from behind, and you keep anyone from taking
damage.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider how small a change this is from normal Kamikaze-Solo; you're
replacing Root with Color Shift.&nbsp; (Flux/Root/Sanity Warp vs Flux/Shift/Sanity Warp)
&nbsp; You still keep Root memorized, and if you decide you've taken too much damage for
one fight, then just Root the mob and step out.&nbsp; Your nearly undamaged pet can finish
off the mob with ease, and if you don't think you've outraced Mr. Kamikaze, just Sanity
Warp again.&nbsp; The reason I am so in love with this technique is also spell slots.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tashani, Color Flux, Color Shift, Sanity Warp, and Root.&nbsp; That leaves <u>three</u>
more slots open, which is beautiful.&nbsp; I keep Enthrall, Memory Blur, and Quicken
usually.&nbsp; Bear in mind that if you get in trouble and lose control of the fight, Root
the mob and back out, and if the pet dies, back out of aggro range and Memory Blur.
&nbsp;&nbsp; You don't have to Mesmerize first.&nbsp; Root doesn't cause aggro after it
first lands.</em></p>
