<p align="center"><em>Welome to Xornn's Guide to Enchanting.&nbsp; Within this site I have
undertaken the task of providing you with one simple thing--everything I know about
Enchanting, and the best advice I can give to you on becoming a truly great enchanter.
&nbsp; Currently, the guide is under some limited construction, but still up and
available.&nbsp; The 51+ Circles are not completed yet, Quests is still empty, Tradeskills
just has a quick rundown of Research, and the Stories are waiting for submissions (I've
got a few I'm working on though) to be sent in.&nbsp; Please take a look around and feel
free to e-mail me your thoughts, questions, or also available is Caster's Realm Enchanter
board, where you can meet the whole enchanter community.&nbsp; (My posting handle is
Eugee.)</em></p>
