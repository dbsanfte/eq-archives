Released on June 6th, the anniversary of D-Day,  WWIIOnline: Blitzkrieg is just that, the war in 1940 on a massively multiplayer scale, as it stands, I would recomend finding a friend with boradband access and a CDR, if you are currently on dial up due to the fact that fresh outa the box you will have a 67 mb download, the game is still in a development phase, even the developers admit it was released too soon (ya can blame publisher Stratagy First for that tho).  Your'e prolly sayin "get to the good part Desi" ok, so I will; the graphics are about if not a bit better then the "Velious" type of graphics in EQ, but it's the play that gets ya.. the best feature  IMHO is the sounds, the doppler effect of a far off battle, hearin a plane buzz overhead & then seeeeing the ground torn up in front of your feet as you are bein straffed.. talk about a RUSH!!<br>
 In WWIIOL you play as either the Axis or Allies that being Germany, Brittain, or France as an infantry armor, artillary or air, currently air power seems to be the least refined but is still what holds the greatest pull for me, nights are beyond belief, tho at the moment there is no light source so everynight is a new moon, which can be irritating, but great for sneakin up on the enemy, grenades satchel charges & rank system is due in the next patch within the next few days so that will only increase the durrability of the Inf. as it stands, they are currently the weakest, yet they are required to take over enemy towns, bases & installations.<br>
 There is soooooooo much I could spew out & tell you about this game, but at the moment it is a love it or hate it situation,  (oh yeah, it is VERY RAM hungry 128 mb min 256+ recomended), the jekyl & hyde syndrome ya could call it (sorta like EQ at times I suppose in that reguard. I am currently on the Axis side of things in a squadron known as the BlueHelfire Sqd. under the name of Deslock, hope to see some o you in there one day as a wingman, gunner for my tank or arty or inf. Co.... it's hard to get in 1 posting as I am not the best at this sorta thing, but I can tell you the adrenalin rush is on par with any raid  in EQ I have ever been on & plenty o "pucker factor" when combat gets hairey, so any questions leme know & I'll answer as best I can.<br>

To start off this is the first of any type of review I have done. But since many of you only get to see screenshots at this point I figured what the hell I will let you know some of the other features.<br>
Lets start with graphics. Most of you have seen the screen shots and that still does not compare to what it really looks like. Something that amazed me was the water. As you walk through water there is a wake it leaves behind you. No to mention it looks like water is moves like water and it sounds like water. If this was not a on my computer I would really think it was water. Sorry I really like the water can't you tell.<br>
You see lots of articles out there right now on some of the different issues. Here are a few of the ones I know of. LAGGGGGG, crashing, missions not working and the list goes on. But what I do know at this point is yes it is still Beta and we have a few more days to go. I have lots of faith in FUNCOM to get many of the issues fixed before release. So far since I have been in Beta they seem to have made some type of fix on a daily basis and the new path from what I understand should clear up the lag. If the lag were cleared up I would have to think most of the crashing would go away also.<br>
Missions are very nice. The ones that I have had the opportunity to do so far are very fun and I don't have to worry about someone saying sorry blah blah blah is camped right now. The way the mission system works is you go to this little machine and select the difficulty you want there are some other advanced features but I do not mess with that right now. You click the button and you have lots of mission&#8217;s icons that pop up. At this point you can go and look at each one and find out what you have to do and the reward. Once you have selected your missions you then upload it and there will be a little white x that appears on your map. So far I have only done ones in the city so I cannot tell you what they will be like later on. Once you get to the x on your map you go in to the door and you will be in your mission area. No one will be there but you and the people you made keys for in your group if you have done so. This is one of the nice features since you can go in and fight any style you want. There is no one there but your team. If you want to run in guns blazing then go for it. If you want to sneak past everyone great you don't have to worry about any unwanted trains. When you get to your objective lets say you had to find a thief and kill them. You receive your reward exp/credits if there was an item involved it is in your inventory automatically.<br>
Trade skills I have no clue sorry +P<br>
Here are a few other small things that people fail to mention in the reviews that I fine very nice. They world is a money sink if you want something you name it I am sure someplace here has it down to my fixers white and pink poke dot boxers. I think that since there are so many places to spend money and you need it for so many different things such as life insurance it will keep the economy healthy.<br>
PVP I have not had the pleasure of enjoying this aspect yet but I have some information on it. There is a percentage basted level cap for people that you can kill and people that can kill you up to level 75. From 75 - 200 it is free for all. I think this is a good idea it will give people some time to know what they are doing before they get spread across Rubi-ka.<br>
Well I hope this helps out some if not don't worry only a few more days and you can find out all you want to know on your own.

  online fantasy role-playing game. I have very little info on it at this time

  info at there official site if you would like to know more.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.neverwinternights.com/">Neverwinter Nights</a> do I really 
  need to say more on this one. I think it has to be one of the most anticipated 
  games of the year. If you have never heard of Neverwinter Nights to sum it up 
  for you it will be old pen and paper D&amp;D 3ed edition put in to a computer 
  setting. The DM can create dungeons creatures and adventures for others to play. 
  The fact that the DM will be able to control the environment around you and 
  your party as you head down in to the depths of a dungeon will make for an exciting 
  adventure. </p></b></td>

Unless I get any new ideas this will be what updates are coming in the near future.<br><br>
Links Pages will go up. It will be an open links page at this time and anyone will be able to add to it.<br><br>
Reconstruction of all pages to bring them all to the same format. The Main page of the site is the format that will be used. Again if you have any suggestions please let me know<br><br>
Members list update. I have been working on the members section a bit over the past few weeks. The way it is going we will have the Members name then the name of there character under each game they play. I hope to be able to automate this allowing members to log in and update all the info for them selves i.e. adding new characters to the games or changing there info. You will not be able to change your Main Nickname.<br><br>
Next step will be message board. Some that have been in the guild a while will say no no no not again but what we will be doing is going over to an all ASP message board. One reason we are doing this is because most of the site is done in ASP at this point. Another reason is ASP will allow me to control all the information and format for the boards including members only boards which we do not have at this time.<br><br>
Last but not least Dalimaar will be Head of the EQ Guild from here on out. If your name is not on the members list please drop me an e-mail and I will add it. Also if you would like your nick name changed let me know because for many of you I do not have one at all.
