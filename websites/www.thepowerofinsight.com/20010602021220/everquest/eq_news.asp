SONY ONLINE ENTERTAINMENT LIFTS INTERNATIONAL BARRIERS TO PLAY TOP ONLINE GAMES 
-- Online Gaming Set to Explode Worldwide With All-New Payment Options Available 
--

SAN DIEGO, CA - May 24, 2001 - In an effort to expand online gaming globally, 
Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) announced today that two alternative payment 
methods will be available for SOE's massively multiplayer games.  Game Cards 
will be sold in retail stores this fall throughout Europe, Japan, Korea and Australia 
as well as North America.  Additionally, JCB (Japanese Credit Bureau) credit 
cards are now accepted, making EverQuest(r) and SOE's other massively multiplayer 
games more accessible to an international audience. 

Currently, SOE requires an American credit card number to subscribe to the online 
game and ultimately this has limited EverQuest's growth abroad.  Game Cards will 
allow cash holders to experience the best-selling online game of all time in 
90-day increments and will be available on retail shelves worldwide. 

The JCB Card offers a great opportunity for SOE to reach gamers in Japan and 
many other Asian countries.  With over 40 million cardmembers worldwide, JCB's 
sophisticated global payment system network has made it the number one card in 
Japan and number four internationally among all of the major credit cards. 

"There has been a universal increase in demand for access to our best-selling 
game, and now we have found a way to reach this broader market by changing our 
billing methodology," said Scott McDaniel, Vice President of Marketing, Sony 
Online Entertainment. "We're looking forward to inviting a whole new group of 
players into the world of EverQuest."

The EverQuest online game currently boasts more than 385,000 active subscribers, 
and recently released a popular expansion pack to the game, EverQuest(r): The 
Scars of Velious(tm), last Fall.  During peak periods, more than 90,000 adventurers 
and dragon slayers have explored the EverQuest world simultaneously.  The active 
global EverQuest(r) subscriber base is comprised of players from various countries 
throughout the "real" world, including the U.S., England, Canada, Singapore, 
Zimbabwe, Saudi Arabia, France, Italy, Germany and New Zealand. 

The Station (www.station.com) is the official provider of EverQuest(r), with 
software updates and news about the game, message boards and other community 
features, as well as an easy-to-use billing system for the EverQuest monthly 
subscription fee of $9.89.

Sony Online Entertainment Inc. (SOE), the online gaming division of Sony Pictures 
Digital Entertainment, is a worldwide leader in massively multiplayer online 
gaming. Headquartered in San Diego, California, SOE develops, publishes and distributes 
entertainment for the PC and online markets.  With more than 10 million registered 
users, SOE's award-winning website, The Station(r) (www.station.com) hosts a 
variety of entertaining games and player communities spanning all genres.  In 
addition to blockbuster hits EverQuest(r) and Jeopardy! Online, SOE has an array 
of cutting-edge online games in development such as PlanetSide(tm), Star Wars(r)

Long ago, the great crystalline dragon Veeshan scarred Norrath and deposited her brood. Shortly thereafter, the gods made a pact to divide up the lands, each wanting to stake their claim with creatures of their own creation. 

Luclin watched from the shadows while the other gods went about making order out of chaos in their own twisted ways. She saw the meeting, the petty bickering, and the various power plays for which the gods have always been known. Abandoning Norrath, Luclin claimed the barren and forgotten ringed rock orbiting the planet for her own. Unopposed and through the sheer power of her will and magic, she gave life to the moon that now bears her name.

In addition to the creations of the Mistress of Shadows, the moon of Luclin has since become home to several of Norrath&#8217;s races, either by choice or by force. The Combine Empire, once powerful and nearly all encompassing, lies on Luclin, split and now a shadow of its former power. The Shissar, once the bane of Kunark, fled the deadly Green Mist and sealed themselves behind the hard vacuum of The Grey. The Vah Shir (Kerrans) were deposited forcefully by the Erudites in the disastrous test of the great weapon that created the abyss now known as The Hole. 

The moon of Luclin is in perfect balance -- one side bathed forever in light, and the other steeped in darkest night. The earliest arrivals felt an eerie and disturbing presence when approaching the Twilight between the two areas. Those not native to the moon quickly learned to avoid these dangerous lands. Ironically, it is said that those of good and honest nature made their homes in the darkness, and those of a darker nature chose the light.

EverQuest®: The Shadows of Luclin&#8482;, projected to be available in December 2001, expands the EverQuest universe yet again and is poised to provide some mind blowing enhancements and additions to the current game!

· Eerie moonscape reveals over 25 new adventure zones including a new starting city
· All new, highly detailed player-character models
· Massively enhanced 3D graphics engine
· Introducing an all-new player character race: The Vah Shir (Kerrans)
· And an all-new player character class: The Beastlord
· Additional non-level-based advancement options for those at level 60
· Discover challenging new quests, items to trade and sell, NPCs and more!

Our next patch is planned for May 30th, probably some time in the wee morning hours here on the West Coast. 

The important part of the message is not that, though. It's this: 

Due to some of the things we are going to be doing, there is a small chance hat some corpses might disappear during the patch. GMs will have the ability to verify any corpses that are lost. That means that they can help you get them back if you do indeed lose one. It also means that I should remind everyone that attempting to scam a GM about a lost corpse could mean banning. 

** IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU PETITION TO HAVE A MISSING CORPSE PROBLEM ADDRESSED WITHIN 5 DAYS OF THE PATCH! ** 

We will not be recovering corpses that might be lost after that time. In fact, it would be best for you to petition immediately if you have a problem. Don't wait. If you are worried about a corpse that you were unable to deal with before the patch, then please log in an check on it right away after the patch. 

So please make certain that you have as many of your corpses cleaned up as possible before the next patch. We're not expecting a lot of corpses to disappear, but the fewer laying around, the less chance of them disappearing.

I stopped by today to introduce my self and the "Guild of Honor".<br>

Before I tell you about us, let me say, "We Do Not Recruit Members".<br>

That is not what I am here for.<br>

The "Guild of Honor" and "Power of Insight" have a lot in common.<br>

Our guild, like PoI is made up of "Friends", people, who have played this game together for years.<br>

Some of our members are also members of PoI and enjoy playing together daily.<br>

The "Guild of Honor" is made up of about 30 members right now, with 85% of them over level 40.<br>

Our main goal as a guild is to have fun and outfit our members for "High Level Adventures".<br>

"High Level Adventures" are things like &#8216;Epic", Planes and all level 50+ dungeons and dragons.<br>

We play for "Honor", like our name states. "Need Before Greed" is our Standard and "Fair Play" keeps us together.<br>

I would like to extend an invitation to all "Power of Insight" members to seek out the "Guild of Honor" members and join us daily for fun and adventure.<br>

In this way, I myself will get to play with some old friends, make some new friends and you will too.<br>

After you get to know us, and you are ready. I would like to propose a "Guild Alliance" between the two of us.<br>

Until We Meet, Be Safe All.<br>
