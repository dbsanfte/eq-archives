            <li><font color="#000000">We know it is not always possible to help
              people but one of the big things this guild was based on was
              helping each other out. No we will not force anyone to help others
              if they do not want to. But 9 times out of 10 if a guild mate is
              asking for help with something it will not take you long to do it.
              Remember one day when you are 6 zones away from your body with
              nothing on you who is going to be there to give you that TP or
              that res you need so bad or maybe even something simple as a SOW.</font></li>

              equipment and that might take a long camp, lots of money or a
              trade. Just try and keep in mind the guild when you are tossing
              some of your old items out.</font></li>

        raid leader know.&nbsp; There are some raids where you will get no items and
        very little exp (<i>IE Enchanters in Fear) </i>but the reason
        behind a guild is to accomplish tasks that could not be done as a single
        group.&nbsp; It is understandable if there is a real life situation, but
        camping for other items or exp is not acceptable.&nbsp; Logging in late will
        not be an&nbsp; acceptable excuse to miss the raid.&nbsp; If you log in 15 or 20 min late you are expected
        to join the guild at the point they are in the raid.&nbsp; Non-guild members that are in
        a zone we are raiding should be treated
        with fairness and respect.&nbsp; Just because they are not in our guild does
        not mean we can abuse them.&nbsp; If someone joins us from another guild they need
        to be made aware of our loot rules.</font></p>
