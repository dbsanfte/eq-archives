    Shaman / Druid (1) Necro / Mage / Wizard. I have set the date for this raid

      <p><b>Phenocryst speaks from within your mind as well as conveys a sense

      people and unite them. When we join we will know all of our experiences
      and perhaps then be aware of how to proceed with the next step in our
      asscention. We implore you to find others like us and make them aware of
      us. You know the language of the stone and can tell them. We await your

      area, then a tentacle terror and spiders area, and finally there's a long
      stretch of tunnel leading up to a zone out point.&nbsp; That long stretch
      of tunnel is filled with geonids and they con the same as the ones in
      Wakening Land.&nbsp; Give one of them the focus (any one, doesn't matter,

      given a very special gift but without direction we are lost. We must find

      <p><b>Phenocryst says in the form of thoughts, 'We must call to it. We
      must make ourselves heard past these rocks though. A menhir must be
      constructed to amplify our voice. The stones we will need are not found in
      this area though. We hear whispers of stones far away that have the
      ability to channel and amplify our thoughts. We ask you to gather these
      stones for us harbinger.&quot;</b></font></p>
      <font face="Verdana" size="2">

      <p><b>Phenocryst's thoughts flood your mind, 'Thank you Harbinger. We need
      3 crystals. One of Beryl, one of Stibnite, and one of the purest Iron.
      These minerals will only be found deep within the earth where the geology
      is relatively stable. This Focus will aid you in finding the right
      crystals. Return it to me with the 3 crystals and we will construct our
      Menhir. Please hurry Harbinger, our prophecy awaits.</b></font></p>
      <font face="Verdana" size="2">
      <p><b>Phenocryst gives you an item for telling him you'll gather the

      of Identify.&nbsp; It looks like a fire emerald.</b></font></p>
      <font face="Verdana" size="2">
      <p><b>The stibnite crystal is found in The Great Divide.&nbsp; If you
      enter the wurm caves in the center of that zone from the south, go up to
      the first right, go in and take the next right, you'll be in a room with
      two spawn points for wurms and there's a patch of blue crystal at the back
      of the room.&nbsp; The stibnite is behind the crystals and looks like a
      bag on the floor.&nbsp; It spawns every 1-2 hours or so I think.&nbsp; The
      description of the item is &quot;Bent Metallic Crystal&quot;.&nbsp; It
      weights 20.0, is magic, lore, and no drop.&nbsp; When you identify it, it
      identifies as &quot;Stibnite for the Menhir&quot;.&nbsp; To identify an
      item using the Elbaite Focus, target yourself, pick up the item and right
      click it on the Elbaite Focus in your inventory.&nbsp; It won't change the
      description of the item, it'll just tell you what it is in your chat
      window.</b></font></p>
      <font face="Verdana" size="2">
      <p></font><b>The&nbsp;Beryl crystal&nbsp;is in Split Paw.&nbsp;&nbsp; It
      once dropped in the entrance of the dungeon, but a recent patch has seen
      Verant moving the crystal to a location deeper inside the dungeon.&nbsp;
      Now it's at loc 690,-10,-30.&nbsp; If you invis up, go through the first
      double doors and jump off the first bridge, you'll find a door that, when
      opened, leads to some water on your left hand side.&nbsp; About 3-4 feet
      across the water is a small platform.&nbsp; The crystal can be found on
      the opposite side of the platform.&nbsp; The spawn time here is probably
      the same.&nbsp; The item description is &quot;Reddish Crystal&quot; and
      it's also magic, lore, and no drop.&nbsp; It weighs 10.0.&nbsp; It
      identifies as &quot;Beryl for the Menhir&quot;</b></p>
      <font face="Verdana" size="2">
      <p><b>The crystal of purest iron is in Burning Woods.&nbsp; It's sitting
      on the meteor near Slixin Klex.&nbsp; It's item description is &quot;Heavy
      Metallic Crystal&quot; and is magic, lore, and no drop.&nbsp; It weighs
      14.0.</b></font></p>
      <font face="Verdana" size="2">
      <p><b>Take these three crystals and the Elbaite Focus back to Wakening
      Lands to Phenocryst and you're ready for the next step.&nbsp; Get 1-2
      parties of 50+ players and bring 'em with you.&nbsp; Due to the dragon
      that spawns in Wakening Land near the dragon portal, you might want to
      approach from skyshrine.&nbsp; If you're going along the wall from
      skyshrine towards the caves, you want to gather your troops at the second
      cave entrance along the wall.&nbsp; Phenocryst is closest to that
      entrance.&nbsp; Get to know the path between you and him at this point so
      you're familiar with how to get out in a hurry.&nbsp; At this point, all
      the geonids should con amiable to you.&nbsp; Finishing the Velium Focus
      section achieves this faction adjustment.&nbsp; Make sure you have a
      ranger in your party of friends.&nbsp; You're going to have to track down
      some triggered MOBs and fight them.</b></font></p>
      <font face="Verdana" size="2">

      this wonderful gift but we can now access those memories and are aware of
      it's storage.&nbsp; With that knowledge has come questions and desires.&nbsp;
      When the prophecy comes to be then we will have our answers and fulfill

      us. Now we can construct the Menhir, we need ..,..,the stones speak..,
      There is a problem. Ones of flesh are coming, the large ones, 3 of them.
      They must not disturb us while we construct the Menhir! Please stop them

      <p><b>Now head outside and start tracking.&nbsp; After a few minutes, two
      &quot;accolyte of Zek&quot; giants will show up on track. A minute later
      or so, a Bloodpriest Loukond will show up on tracker as well.&nbsp; You'll
      have to run out and pull the accolytes to you once you track them.&nbsp;
      If they are snared, they still run quite fast.&nbsp; These giants con blue
      at 52 and are quite magic resistant.&nbsp; Make sure you pull these,
      they're almost more important than the Bloodpriest.&nbsp; They get
      attacked by the various mercenaries in the zone sometimes and get killed
      before you can do the job.&nbsp; If you have to pull mercenaries with the
      accolytes, do.&nbsp; After killing both accolytes, loot them.&nbsp; Each
      one has a medalion that has the description, &quot;Holy Symbol of Zek&quot;,
      which is magic, no drop, and weighs 2.0.&nbsp; After the accolytes are
      done, go out and get the Bloodpriest.&nbsp; Bloodpriest Loukond should
      eventually walk up to the cave entrance and stand outside it if nobody
      pulls it.&nbsp; After a minute of standing outside the cave, he depops,
      which is why you have to do the accolytes first (they pop first) then the
      bloodpriest (he'll get to the cave probably if you can't find him, the
      accolytes might not).&nbsp; The bloodpriest cons blue at 52 and is just as
      magic resistant.&nbsp; He drops a third and final medalion with the same
      description.&nbsp; You must get all three medalions in order to for this
      part to prove fruitful.&nbsp; When you kill the giants, you take the
      following faction hits: Kromzek (worse), Kromrif (worse), KingTormax
      (worse), and ClawsofVeeshan (better).&nbsp; The giants never enter the
      caves to attack the geonids or anything.&nbsp; Everything will happen
      outside the caves and the giants won't aggro the dragon if it's up either.&nbsp;
      The Bloodpriest Loukond is also not to be confused with Priest Bjek,
      another giant who wanders in the area sometimes who is red at 52 and not
      related to this quest.</b></font></p>
