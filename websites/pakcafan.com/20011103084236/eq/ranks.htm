  <p><font class=headingwhite>Guild Ranks</font> </p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  </center>
		
		<p>All the rankings in Pak'Cafan are not based on time requirements but on four areas that regard conduct:<br>
		<br>
		<font class=rankheading>1. Guild event participation. </font></p>
		<p>This mostly pertains to the weekly scheduled raids but also in part to the spur-of-the-moment epic raids and/or other objectives that occur in game.<br>
		<br>
		Exception &#150; Not everyone can attend the weekly raids due to RL conflicts and in some cases these are consistent issues to where a person may never get to attend raids on some nights. These kinds of conflicts can be offset by participation in the on-the-fly events that happen (e.g. Guild member makes a request or comes up with an idea for a multi-group objective).<br>
		<br>
		<font class=rankheading>2. Pak groups.</font></p>
		<p>This is where we learn our tactics and to rely on each other when things get hairy. It is also where we get our time to bond with other Pak members and is the cornerstone of the family. People, when they are online, who neglect Pak groupings are really neglecting the core, fundamental element of being in a guild. If you are grouped with non-Pak and one of the group leaves. Look for someone in guild channel first. If someone is LFG in guild chat and you are in a group you are not very attached to, by all means, disband and go duo somewhere. As a member of Pak you should be actively seeking other members of Pak to hunt with. Of course this does not mean that we exclude anyone, in fact, the more people who know the quality of people in Pak?Cafan the better. We will attract those like-minded souls and continue to grow in numbers.<br>
		<br>
		* Exceptions &#150; If already grouped, members are not expected to just disband as soon as someone in Pak logs in and calls LFG in guild chat. Also if you are grouped and a cleric drops and the group starts shouting/oocing for another healer and a Pak Wizard is LFG in the guild channel, do the right thing and not invite the wizard into the group. We have to remember that while we have an allegiance to Pak, we must also consider what the group needs.<br>
		<br>
		<font class=rankheading>3. Activity on the boards. </font></p>
		<p>Please RSVP for raids and respond to requests for assistance. If there is a thread you have an opinion about, share it. This is where people can participate in Pak without having to be online. If a guild member is having RL issues and can?t log into EQ the boards are we would hope people would pop in and say hi and let us know what is going on in. This guild is a big tight-knit family and we like to hear how things are going especially if we don't get to see you.<br>
		<br>
		Exception - Everyone who plays EQ should have access to a browser and should be able to scan the boards and post once in a while. The one real exception being your PC died and you don't readily have access to another.<br>
		<br>
		<font class=rankheading>4. Adherence to Pak policies and values. </font></p>
		<p>This includes the hand-me-down policy. It also includes offering help to those members that need it for CR's, Ports, etc.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<font class=rankheading>Cub</font><br>
  This is the initial ranking of new member of Pak'Cafan. Cub status lasts at 
  least four weeks from the date of the actual induction of the prospective member. 
  This allows for an appropriate participation-based title to be offered at the 
  end of the Cub period. For additional information on Cub status please check 
  the Guild Charter.<br>
		<br>
		To qualify for a rank, members must meet two of the 3 criteria. All ranks are also dependant on the 4th criteria, Adherence to Pak Values.<br>
		<br>
		<font class=rankheading>Level 1. Lone Wolf</font><br>
		Lone Wolves are those who do not qualify as a tenderfoot which means they have basically disappeared by not attending guild events, grouping with pak or participating on the boards. They are also those people who have been reprimanded for behavior issues.<br>
		<br>
		<font class=rankheading>Level 2. Tenderfoot</font><br>
		Rarely attends raids, rarely groups with Pak, rarely posts on the boards.<br>
		<br>
		<font class=rankheading>Level 3. Pak Hunter</font><br>
		Attends raids infrequently, occasionally groups with Pak, occasionally posts on the boards.<br>
		<br>
		<font class=rankheading>Level 4. Grey Wolf &#150; Dire Wolf</font><br>
		Attends raids regularly, groups with Pak a majority of the time, posts on the boards a few times a week. A Dire wolf is someone who is ranked at Grey Wolf and is level 50 or over.<br>
		<br>
		<font class=rankheading>Level 5. Elder</font><br>
  Attends raids faithfully, is always looking for Pak groups and if one doesn't 
  exist, starts it, posts on the boards regularly.<br>
		<br>
		New officers will come from the Elder pool of guild members. Note that this is not based on level or time in the guild. It is based on the amount of effort put into the guild.<br>
		<br>
		<font class=rankheading>Officer Rankings:</font><br>
		Though officers come from the Elder pool it is not realistic to expect that level of participation at all times. Again RL issues must take precedence and with that understanding, Officers rankings may go as low as Pak Hunter. An officer who's participation merits a Tenderfoot or Lone Wolf ranking may have their officer ranking reevaluated by the other officers.
