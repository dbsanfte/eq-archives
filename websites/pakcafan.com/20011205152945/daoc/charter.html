              Rank 0 - Den Alpha<br>
              This is me, the Guildleader. Nothing about this can be changed short 
              of the title. This rank has too much in game functionality for the 
              purposes here. My role outside of game functionality is simple - 
              to promote the growth and success of the guild as a whole. By means 
              of direct in game leadership, or by taking a more reserved, advisory 
              role if the situation warrants it. Ultimately I am responsible for 
              every action done by a guild member who wears the Pak tag. In light 
              of that, know that I put honor and truth over most things. Do not 
              dishonor the Pak name.</p>
            <p class="newstext" align="left">Rank 1 - Inner Council<br>
              These are my trusted, devoted, and proven Officers from our EQ branch. 
              They are my council for decisions that span any games we might be 
              involved in, as well as themselves having specific duties. The members 
              of this rank are:<b> Derringer/Arlen, Redleaf/Waran, Ainin, </b>and<b> 
              Khirgoth/Perigoth</b>. Their duties encompass: Arlen is the Master 
              of the Hunt, and will work very closely with myself on Battlefield 
              tactics and will lead the forces into RvR conflict on most occasions 
              he is present (in tandem or without the Den Alpha). Waran is our 
              message board admin, and Kennel Master. The Kennel Master is the 
              person responsible for keeping track of cubship times (1month) as 
              well as promoting/suggesting promotion out of Cub status. This will 
              remain in DaoC. Ainin is the second in command, and currently organizes 
              DaoC recruitment. Finally, Perigoth is the Keeper of the Scrolls 
              - when anyone is in need of statistical or listing information the 
              burden falls on his shoulders. <br>
              These members all have the ablity to invite/remove, promote/demote, 
              access to ospeak/ohear, aspeak/ahear (alliance)</p>
            <p class="newstext" align="left">Rank 2 - Officers<br>
              These are members that go above and beyond the call of duty. They 
              have shown themselves to hold the ideals of Pak'Cafan in high regard 
              and practice these ideals without making a concious effort. This 
              is the highest rank a member can aspire to.<br>
              These members can invite/remove, and promote. They have access to 
              ospeak/ohear and aspeak/ahear.</p>
            <p class="newstext" align="left">Rank 3 - Cwn Annwn<br>
              This is a DaoC specific rank that I have reserved specifically for 
              the use of the Master of the Hunt (Arlen). The members here have 
              shown their continued excellence in the field of battle, and specifically 
              in key roles and assisting in leadership efforts. The members in 
              this rank have proven themselves in a leadership position on the 
              field of battle, and should you be in a division during RvR combat 
              that has one of these members in command, know that they have proven 
              themselves to the Master of the Hunt and are to be followed without 
              question <i>(however, everyone makes mistakes and can learn, so 
              please use the retrospective time after fighting to be inquistive 
              and brainstorm to improve performance/outcome if you have better 
              ideas)</i><br>
              These members have access to ahear/aspeak.</p>
            <p class="newstext" align="left"><i>(Definition of the name --Packs 
              of spectral hounds are said to have been seen in full cry all over 
              Britain - in the North they are generally known as the Gabriel Hounds, 
              in Devon the Yeth (Heath) or Wisht Hounds, in Cornwall Dando and 
              his Dogs or the Devil and his Dandy Dogs, in Wales the Cwm Annwn, 
              the Hounds of Hell. Sometimes they are said, like the cross-road 
              haunting Norfolk Shuck and Suffolk Shock, to be great black hounds 
              with fiery eyes - often eyes as big as saucers, like the 'wide-eyed' 
              Peterborough hounds. Generally, however, they are not seen, only 
              heard passing overhead on cloudy or stormy nights.)</i></p>
            <p class="newstext" align="left">Rank - 4 Elder<br>
              People ask you questions, and you answer to the best of your ability. 
              Your use of tact in situations that demand it is supurb. You show 
              good leadership skills, but don't wish the burden of leadership. 
              This rank can be many things, but most importantly the people who 
              fill this ranking are those that either aspire to become officers 
              (and therefore are trying to emulate behavior of an office) or those 
              people who fit in so well with our family and our ideals that they 
              live and breath Pak. They are curtious, friendly, and generally 
              well liked by a lopsided majority of the guild.<br>
              These members have access to ahear/aspeak</p>
            <p class="newstext" align="left">Rank 5 - PeaPODS<br>
              This has evolved from our first days of planning from being a rank 
              for Luirkeen's to gather making siege equipment, to becoming our 
              Tradeskill Rank. Anyone who has shown exceptional skills in tradeskills, 
              or who primarily do tradeskills, can get acceptance into this rank. 
              Being here tells the guild that you are working to benefit the entire 
              guild by equiping us in the best possible gear that your set of 
              skills can be made. Acceptance into this rank is voluntary, and 
              can be done at any time after promotion from Cub status. In addition, 
              you do not have to be in this rank to do tradeskills, but those 
              here are proud to be here and focus on the greater damage that Siege 
              Warfare can reap. This group is informally led by Pacosidhe, and 
              our other trusted high level tradesmen.</p>
            <p class="newstext" align="left">Rank 6 - Dire Wolf<br>
              This rank differs from its EQ side. This is purley a combat oriented 
              rank. If you are a Dire Wolf, you have broken your teeth, and have 
              sharpened them well. You are experienced in RvR combat, as a foot 
              solider or specialist, not a commander. Your individual Realm Points 
              have exceeded 5,000 and you are something to be feared when walking 
              onto a battle field. (EQ family members - think of Rumblar and his 
              massive trains that he would somehow live through)</p>
            <p class="newstext" align="left">Rank 7 - Grey Wolf<br>
              You have shown yourself to be more than a faceless name that spams 
              across the green guildchat. You almost always know what is going 
              on with the message boards, and have excellent communication skills 
              with your family. Your contributions to the guild are many, and 
              are a welcome addition. This is a rank of participation, in and 
              out of game, and in guildchat and on the battlefields (PvE or PvP).</p>
            <p class="newstext" align="left">Rank 8 - Pak Hunter<br>
              No longer a cub, congrats! The officers feel like you are a good 
              addition to the guild and you may now wear your emblem with pride. 
              Most members will fall into this rank.</p>
            <p class="newstext" align="left">Rank 9 - Cub<br>
              Welcome to Pak'Cafan. You have just recently been accepted into 
              the guild and are undergoing a probationary time period. The minimum 
              time frame is one months time for you to remain in this rank, at 
              which point you will be evaulated. There is no maxium that you can 
              remain in this rank, however if you haven't been promoted at the 
              2 month mark, chances are we should part ways. In addition to this 
              probationary time period, please note that you can and will be removed 
              for any or no reason at all -- and you yourself may remove yourself 
              for any or no reason at all. This is a trial period so we can see 
              how you fit with us and our family and for you to see if you like 
              the Family that we have built here. No Cub can ever wear an emblem, 
              no matter how high in tradeskills they get, or how high in level. 
              The one month time frame must be completed before concideration 
              of promotion can occur. <i>Please do not bog our officers down with 
              questions about being promoted, the details are all here for you.</i></p>

              founding virtues. These virtues are a marker for the way we conduct 
              ourselves in our dealings with our fellow guildmembers, non-guildmembers 
              and even realm-enemies (in DAoC). In most situations applying these 
              virtues and asking yourself if your conduct fits within them is 
              enough. Sometimes a person can forget themselves in the heat of 
              the moment and be blind to what is right or wrong.</p>
            <p class="newstext">The following is a list of do's and don't based 
              on the above virtues. Those who trespass against this list can be 
              disciplined in the following. (this is not a complete listing, but 
              a short guideline)</p>
            <p class="newstext">Cubs: If the trespass is grevious enough an officer 
              may disband a cub with no warning and without consulting the other 
              officers. A cub is basically on probation till they prove themselves

            <p class="newstext">Pak Hunter or above: Can be put on probation, 
              demoted or both. If the issue is grevious, the officers will decide 
              together what the repurcussions will be up to and including removal 
              from the guild. An officer may not remove a Pak Hunter of above

              1. Offer your opinion and your support for things you feel positive 
              about.<br>
              2. Offer *constructive criticism* for things you do not feel positive 
              about. This should make the person you are disagreeing with:<br>
              a. See that you understand their point of view.<br>
              b. State your point of view<br>
              c. Post a solution that compromises both point of views or just 
              say 'I am not sure where the middle ground is.'</p>
            <p class="newstext">Do NOT:<br>
              1. Call guildmembers or anyone else derogatory names on the boards. 
              (Now this may be done in jest but you had best be sure it will be 
              taken as a jest or followed by an apology)<br>
              2. Post messages that are derogatory or that inflame an issue. This 
              does not mean we do not want you opinion. If you want to post a 
              dissenting view on something see the Do list.<br>
              3. Post messages requesting Power Leveling. If someone offers to 
              PL you great. Do Not Ask.<br>
              4. Post messages asking for items. Posting for something to be crafted 
              and offering to pay for it is ok. If the crafter chooses not to 
              be paid even better. But expect to pay for at least the materials. 
              (A little more does not hurt)</p>
            <p class="newsheader">Game Do's and Dont's</p>
            <p class="newstext">Do:<br>
              1. Try to help or advise those who ask for assistance whether guildmembers 
              or not. Go out of your way for Guildmembers.<br>
              2. If you have room in your group look for Pak members to fill it. 
              If a non pak person is asking to group and you have room please 
              accomodate them unless they prove themselves not to be Pak Material*.</p>
            <p class="newstext">Do NOT: 1. Spam requests for assistance in guild 
              channel. Make a request and wait patiently. We all have things we 
              want to do too.<br>
              2. Train mobs on someone with the intent to kill them. Trains happen, 
              do your best to announce it then run like hell. Doing this intentionally 
              is a serious offense. If someone is doing it to you talk to an officer 
              and appeal.</p>
            <p class="newstext">Observing the above and conducting ourselves according 
              to Pak virtues will ensure our untarnished reputation is maintained

            <p class="newstext">The officers of Pak'Cafan</p>
            <p class="newstext">*Pak Material: Does not have anything to with 
              being L33T or Uber. It has to do with honor, courage and family
