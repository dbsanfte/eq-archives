<p class="body">That's right, last night we went in and took care of the Performer, finishing up Tier 2 in Demi, and let me tell you if I never see an add again it will be to soon.  I am sure others would agree.  What a great event tho (my opinion of course, I know people who might shoot me for saying that), one that keeps every single person in the raid on their toes the entire fight, and one that feels great to finally get past!</p>
<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Performer.jpg" width="500" height="800" alt="" border="0"><br>
<i>Congratulations Pak'Cafan!</i></p>
<p class="body">And of course there was the loot, some leather crap... err I mean... Go ahead and see for yourselves.</p>

<p class="body">That just leaves one more encounter in the zone.  We decided to take a stroll down to see him before we called it a night...</p>
<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Mayonglives.jpg" width="300" height="547" alt="" border="0"><br><br>
<i>Prepare to die, Mayong!</i></p>
<p class="body">It shouldn't be to much longer until we have the Demi-Plane completely on farm mode!<br><br>
In other news, we've started to look a bit more at the PoR expansion to see what kind of trouble we can get into there.  We played around a bit in the Sullen instance and just tonight pulled out our first win there.<br><br>
Now, of course I'm a total slacker and didn't take any screenshots, but all you need to do is imagine staring at the ass of a 5 foot tall dog for a really long time and you have the fight.  He did drop a couple of nice items tho...<br><br>
- <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=51702">Ragestone Adorned Ring</a> - Congrats Bono!<br>
- <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=51710">Blood-fueled Ragestone</a> - Congrats Candy!</p>
<p class="body">That's it for now, we're on a roll lately, and aren't showing any signs of slowing down any time soon.  Recruitment is open on a limited basis, particularly for Clerics, Druids, Mages, and Berserkers.  Send an officer a tell in game for more info.</p>

<p class="body">No it's not a newbie in an Oracle Robe, it's Tris's spirit as promised in my last update...  Our second tier two Demi-Plane encounter beat in only one week's time!<br><br>
While her drops weren't fantastic, we still got a couple of nice upgrades...</p>

<p class="body">While I wouldn't call either of these encounters easy, it's nice to have a couple of fights that don't take weeks to learn.  It's certainly made the Demi-Plane a lot more interesting this past week.  I think I can speak for most when I say that we are really looking forward to the rest of tier two and for Mayong himself!<br><br>
I doubt it will be long before I am forc... err, I mean I get the pleasure of doing the next update, rumor has it Roley had some loot we'd like to claim for our own! :)<br><br>
Until next time...</p>

<p class="body">Yeah, that's right, two updates in one day.  Don't hold your breath, you're not likely to see this very often.  Actually, go ahead and hold your breath, it could be fun to watch...<br><br>
Yeah!<br><br>
So anyway, our first night in tier two Demi-Plane of Blood and we come out with our first win!<br><br>
While it didn't seem quite as difficult at Redfang (understatement of the year), it still felt great getting our first tier two kill so quickly.<br><br>
So sorry that we didn't get to visit longer, but we just have so many other things to do...</p>

<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Redfangcorpse.jpg" width="550" height="213" alt="" border="0"></p>
<p class="body">It was a hell of a fight to say the least.  But after our last round of attempts we knew tier two was in our sights.  We formed up last night knowing we were close, just a couple tweaks to be made and the guild would be serving up Batwing Crunchies for all.  But then I get a tell...</p>
<p class="body" align="center"><i>"we're short a rotation cleric"</i><br><br>
Oh goodie, this should be fun.<br><br>
A short time later, after we've made adjustments the best that we could, I get another tell from the same cleric...<br><br>
<i>"Alrighty, this oughta be interesting"</i><br><br>
Much joy...<br><br>
We really pulled it together tho.  Everybody did their jobs near flawlessly. And even when it looked like it might turn bad, we stayed focused and pulled out the win.<br><br>
What a great victory it was.<br><br>
And of course, after every great victory, there was loot to be had...</p>

<p class="body">So we did it, we've broken into tier two.  We've, once again, proven that Pak'Cafan remains a strong guild.  And we've done it without getting the reputation attatched to us that many other guilds have.  It feels great to have that kill under our belts, and every one of us has something to be proud of for sure...</p>
<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Redfanggroup.jpg" width="550" height="129" alt="" border="0"><br>
<i>Congratulations Pak'Cafan!</i></p>
<p class="body">We poked around a bit in tier two last night and it looks fun so far.  Hope to have more dead things to show you all soon!<br><br>
On a final note, Pak'Cafan recruitment is nearly closed again, but we do have a couple more openings in a few areas.  Check out the forums for the most up to date details.<br><br>
See ya all in tier two!</p>

<p class="body">Yeah yeah, update faster you say... I do have a job ya know? :P<br><br>

We've had somewhat of a slow start to our month, finishing up our latest round of recruitment, backflagging, farming... All that good stuff. While fun, it's left us craving for more.<br><br>
We went into Demi on Monday night really hoping to get our first Hatchet kill under our belts.  We were set, we were focused, nothing was going to stop us.  Well, maybe a teeny tiny little incident with a nearly harmless little red skeleton might stop us...<br><br>
After uhm, a very long time rezzing, dying, logging on alts, leveling said alts, moving skeletons, and other dead things we were finally recovered.  We figured the focus was gone, that too many people had gone to sleep or that too many people had snuck out for the night.  We almost called it a night.  The officers were burnt and frustrated and just wanted to go to bed pretending the night hadn't happened.  But we decided that since we had spent so much time getting to this point, we had to at least throw ourselves at Hatchet for a quick TL to bind.<br><br>
Well, once again, things didn't go as planned.  After about 5 minutes we realized that the focus was still there, that we really had a chance at winning still.  A short time later (ok, a long time later) we came up with this!</p>
<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Hatchetcorpse.jpg" width="550" height="322" alt="" border="0"></p>
<p class="body">And of course he coughed us up some loot!</p>
<p class="body" align="left"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Hatchetear.jpg" width="447" height="281" alt="" border="0"><br>
<i>Congrats Valerys!</i></p>
<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Fallenboots.jpg" width="454" height="266" alt="" border="0"><br>
<i>Congrats Florance!</i></p>
<p class="body" align="right"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Eulogy.jpg" width="445" height="266" alt="" border="0"><br>
<i>Congrats Kanuuan!</i></p>
<p class="body">And then Tuesday night came, and well... We won't talk about Tuesday night other than that we had an interesting discussion about what kind of torture devices would work best on the game developers.<br><br>
And then Wednesday night came.  Once again we were psyched, we knew we were close to another fresh kill.  We took a while to get ready, making sure we didn't have any flaws in group setup, or anything else we could later kick ourselves over.  And then finally we engaged...<br><br>
Then within 30 seconds we had a death...<br>
And then a short time later we had another...<br>
Uh oh, this might not go so well...<br>
But then we pulled it together. For the next 45 minutes or so, we ripped the event to shreds.  Everybody was doing exactly what they needed to be doing, hardly anybody died, and we came up with another corpse that wasn't one of ours!</p>
<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Daosheendying.jpg" width="500" height="294" alt="" border="0"></p>
<p class="body">And of course we got some more nice loot...</p>
<p class="body" align="left"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Forcependant.jpg" width="457" height="265" alt="" border="0"><br>
<i>Congrats Dumathin!</i></p>
<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Malformed.jpg" width="434" height="202" alt="" border="0"><br>
<i>Congrats Soulkeepper!</i></p>
<p class="body" align="right"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Prismaticaug.jpg" width="447" height="202" alt="" border="0"><br>
<i>Congrats Welaker!</i></p>
<p class="body">It was pretty amazing really.  An event we have tried so few times to go down the way it did was a sight to be seen.  Everybody did an amazing job, from the clickers, to the healers, to the people standing around with their thumbs in disgusting places wondering why an event was designed in such a way.<br><br>
Way to step it up Pak'cafan with two fresh kills in three days!</p>
