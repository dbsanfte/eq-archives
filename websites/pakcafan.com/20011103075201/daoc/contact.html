			Thank you for expressing interest in joining Pak'Cafan in the world of Dark Ages of Camelot. As of right now, our joining requirements are not nearly what they will be in the coming weeks ahead.  Our current joining procedures in Everquest are quite stringent and will be so soon in Camelot as well.  However, to promote the growth of our guild in Camelot, the first few weeks of release we will be having a time period of very loose inviting.</p>
			<p class="newstext">
However, board participation is a must in this guild - at the very least reading the boards as often as you can.  And as such, the only limit on the guild acceptance at this time is your posted intentions on our guilds message board in the DaoC forum.  Once you have posted your intentions of joining and told a little bit about yourself and why you wish to join our family, then will you be extended an invite into the guild.</p>
            <p class="newstext">
As you may read from our charter page in regards to EQ, you will notice we have a cubship period in place for all new members into our guild.  What this does it allow both the new member and the established members the ability to test out one another to see if we mesh together.  All members that have no relation to our EQ guild will be cubs until further notice.  What this means, is that while we are going to have a very loose recruitment for awhile, if we see that you are just not one of our people, or have not the moral integrity/family values/want to have fun that the rest of us do, we will remove you with little to no explanation - and hope that no feelings were hurt in the process. At the same time, should you feel we aren't closer aligned to your personal philosophies, please feel free to remove yourself with little more than a good bye, and again no feelings will be hurt on the part of the guild if you do choose to leave.</p>
            <p class="newstext">
The ranking system is not yet finalized in Camelot, however should you prove to be an asset to the Camelot guild, you will find yourself with an opportunity to be any rank that are open to the general populace.  The only ranks that are reserved are Ranks 0 and 1 (guild leader and Inner Council respectively).</p>
            <p class="newstext">
Please note that our guild is based on family/friend bonds while still maintaining a strong push to be a very elite fighting unit. Pak does not care about being uber, Pak does care about achieving lofty in-game goals while maintaining a reputation that is unmarred by pettiness or selfishness. And if we accomplish great things within DAoC and people call us 'Uber' so be it. We do not tolerate board flames, or harassment of any kind to any player for any reason.  Always know that the people that have come before you in Pak'Cafan have spent years (since April '99) to build our guild name to be the most honorable and trustworthy guild that we can possibly be.  We plan on continuing this tradition, while still having fun and defending our realm!</p>
            <p class="newstext">
The people who fit well in Pak are unselfish, mature people who use tact in their dealings with their fellow guild members and the general populace. If you do not have these traits you may want to look for another home. </p>
            <p class="newstext">
Now this does not mean that Pak is boring, a healthy sense of sarcasm and a sharp wit will take you far on the boards and in guild chat. Also there are times, especially later in the evening, where topics in the guild channel can be off color at best. If you are offended easily you may want to look for another home.</p>
            <p class="newstext">
If you are still interested in joining, please feel free to post your intentions, and we will see you in Camelot (Guinevere server)!</p>
