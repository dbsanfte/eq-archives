	<p class="title">Philosophy:</p>
	<!-- Title End -->
	
	<!-- Body Start -->
	<p class="body">As Pak’Cafan grows in power and member base the needs of the guild change. In the past, randoming and then weighted randoming suited the guild nicely. Now, however, with the goals of the guild growing ever higher and our power level reaching to achieve these goals, we have come to a place where we need a more structured, logical and controlled system in determining the disbursement of loot to assure fairness for everyone. In addition, the officers are not comfortable with the stress and arguments that are inherent in the current system. The goal was to develop a system that was fair to everyone, and that everyone would abide by, including the officers.</p> 

<p class="body">The following system is similar to published DKP systems but alleviates many of the problems inherent in those systems. Much like a DKP system, it takes the randomness out of the loot system and does not burden the officer core with the decisions (i.e. Merit Based), while still fairly rewarding participation.</p>

<p class="body"><b>Mechanics:</b></p> 

<p class="body"><b>Attendance</b> – Attendance will be taken for all officially sanctioned Pak’Cafan raids. Each time attendance is taken you will receive 1 attendance point. The timing of attendance taken will vary depending upon the type and length of the raid. For a single target raid, attendance will be taken at the time of mob engagement. For a multi target raids, attendance will be taken at each target. Long raids with no specific goal in mind, i.e. HoT armor farm/named crawl, attendance will be taken at specific time intervals (approx. 2-hour intervals). For long extended single target raids, attendance may be taken more than once.</p>

<p class="body">Attendance logs will be posted within 48 hours of the raid in question, and ratios on the 'master sheet' updated to include them at that time. Members have 1 week from the raid so that those people can check that they have been accounted for on the raid. The logs will become *final* after the 1 week period has past, and cannot be revised.</p> 

<p class="body">Attendance for a failed raid will only count if we do not make another attempt at the target that day. These points are subject to approval by the officers.</p> 

<p class="body">There will never be closed guild raids. If attendance points are given for an encounter, the guild will be notified and any that want to attend are welcome.</p> 


<p class="body"><b>Loot Value</b> – When a player acquires an item that item is then added to that player’s total cumulative loot value.</P>

<p class="body">The loot value of particular items is currently listed in the "Call to the Hunt" thread in our forums. This list is subject to change as encounters are trivialized and loot for said encounters become commonplace.</p> 

<p class="body">In addition, all loot/attendance ratios will be used from the most recent 'master sheet'' available to the membership. This 'master sheet' may or may not include raids within the last 2 days before finalization, depending on when the officers have time to update it in their 48-hour window. The important thing to note here is that the 'master list' available to the membership of point totals will be gospel, and changes made after the fact due to an attendance contention will *not* be retroactive to loot won in the meantime, only to the point ratio moving forward. All contentions on attendance lists will be handled by the officers and accepted or declined based on available information</p> 

<p class="body">Attendance points and loot points never reset or roll off. Loot and attendance taken today will still be reflected in your total points a year or two from now.</p> 

<p class="body"><b>Additional Eligibility</b> – Each item will also have additional eligibility requirements in two forms above and beyond a class suggested hierarchy</p> 

<p class="body"><b>Class hierarchy:</b> Each item will have a suggested class hierarchy that lists what classes the item is best suited for. If no one of the ideal class is interested or present in the item, it then follows the listed hierarchy in eligibility.</p>

<p class="body"><b>Level eligibility:</b> The standard for most loot will be level 55 minimum required, however, loot for higher end raid encounters will be level 60+. As the guild progresses in power and the saturation of particular loot increases, these levels can be lowered as needed. For instance, BP of Vindication could be lowered to level 55 or removed altogether.</p> 

<p class="body">- For loot valued 15 points or less: Any member can receive regardless of attendance <Br><Br>

- For loot valued 16 points and higher: A member must have attended at least 25% of the last 30 days' raids 	(rolling 30 days). <Br><Br>

- For loot valued 25 points and higher: A member must have accumulated at least 100 total attendance points during their membership with the guild. 
</p> 

<p class="body">Membership is expected to attend at least one raid per calendar month. Those members not meeting this attendance requirement will be assessed a monthly maintenance fee added to their loot total.</p> 

<p class="body">A new member joining the guild enters into an introductory ‘cub’ period. At the conclusion of this cub period this new member is charged a membership fee added to his loot total and becomes a full member. A member in his cub period may not receive loot over any full member regardless of ratio.</p>

<p class="body"><b>Loot Ratio</b> – This is what ultimately determines the winner of a particular item. The loot ratio is determined by dividing the player’s loot value by the total number of raids attended. When an item drops, those interested in said item will give a tell to the specified officer who will then look up the interested parties recorded stats and assuming all eligibility requirements are met, the person with the lowest loot ratio is awarded the item. </p>

<p class="body">An example of loot ratio:</p> 

<p class="body">Player_A has taken 3 loot points and has 30 attendance points for a ratio of (0.1). Player_B has taken 1 loot point and has 20 attendance points for a ratio of (0.05). If Player_A and Player_B were both interested in an item, Player_B would receive as he has the lower ratio.</p> 

<p class="body">There is no waiting period for loot valued items. Provided one has the loot ratio, he can take as much loot as he wants. However each item taken worsens one's ratio.</p> 

<p class="body"><b>Merit clause</b> – On occasion there will be a situation where the officer core will reserve the right to override the current loot system to merit a particularly important item. If an item is merited, the loot value will be assigned to the merited player's total.</p> 

<p class="body"><b>Bots/Alts</b> – If no mains are interested then the item will be opened to any Alts, if no Alts are interested, then any bots on the raid may be considered. The loot value of the item will be assigned to the owner of the bot/alt.</p>

<p class="body">Raid critical bots (as determined by the officers) will receive half attendance credit for their owner. The person playing the bot will receive full credit, but can never receive more than one attendance point per attendance no matter how many toons are played. (i.e. if a person plays themself and a bot, they will only receive raid credit for 1).</p> 

<p class="body"><b>Invites</b> – Any invites are eligible for loot that no guild members opt for. Example: If monk only item drops and there are no guild monks present, the invite monk may then loot the item.</p> 

<p class="body"><b>Unwanted Loot</b> – If no one present on the raid is interested in an item the item must rot. However if the item is tradable or if it can be multi-quested, an officer will loot it to either sell for guild funds or hold until later to complete the quest. Under no circumstance will the loot value of the item be discounted or given for free. If a member wants the item, the value for that item MUST be assigned to their loot value.</p> 

<p class="body"><b>Non Loot Value items</b> - There are items that will not have a loot value. An example of a non-loot value item is HoT plate gloves. For these items, the current weighted ranking roll will apply (1-1000 for Pak hunters, 250-1250 for dire wolves and up). If you win a non-loot valued item, you are not allowed to roll again that night. Note: This is no change from our old loot policies.</p> 

<p class="body"><b>Handing down of loot</b> – It has been a long standing and long practiced tradition of handing down droppable items to those who need in the guild, and while this tradition has never been mandatory, it is one of the core traditions of the guild. With that said, we will continue to encourage those people who upgrade droppable slots to hand down their previous item. To further encourage this tradition, the following addendum; </p>

<p class="body">All droppable items at or above 10 point value may be handed down with the reimbursement of HALF (rounded down) of the loot value. The item will be posted in the forum by an officer with the item cost, for a period of 72 hours (give or take) asking for bids, if multiple people bid on the item, the loot system will dictate who receives said item. </p>

<p class="body">The person receiving the item will be charged the full amount of the item's current cost. If no interest is shown in accepting this item for the cost, then the member is free to do with the item as he/she so chooses (Which includes handing it down anyway, selling/trading it for upgrades, et cetera), but will not receive any reimbursement. </p>


<p class="body"><b>Epics and other quests</b> - Nothing prohibits a group of friends from helping each other with epics and other quests. However if it involves requiring full guild help, a loot value will be assigned<br><br>
