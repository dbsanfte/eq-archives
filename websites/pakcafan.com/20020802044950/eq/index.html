	The night of SUCK. That's what we had tonight, at first anyway. The patch was early so by the time we had people on most everything was dead except for HoT named and an expected Doze. We haven't done an old fashioned armor farm in awhile and we needed a few symbols so we decided give it a go.<br><br>
It sucked.<br><br>
No, I mean, it /really/ sucked. Every guild gets hit by the suck stick now and then, it happens. But uh.. normally it's like "Oh Tormax killed 10 people instead of no deaths..." or the fearful "OMG a ranger turned off attack on enrage, that sucks.." You know, the normal nights of suck. This night of SUCK was Epic. Nay, BIBLICAL.<br><br> 
Seriously, give me one solid group and I can do HoT nice and easy, we had a nice sized force, enough to easily take 3 mobs of really any kind. Did we? No.. Of course not. It all started with a botched pull by yours truly (/bow), followed by not one... not two... but three freaking wipe outs! Yes, wipe outs in HoT *hangs head in shame*<br><br>
But then Derringer - our rock, our shining light, our Dirf who likes to take pictures of his hairy nut sack with unsuspecting friend's cameras - shows up. We were then unstoppable. Three AE'ing mobs? That's IT? Bring MORE! Derringer is here!<br><br>
So we finished a clean sweep of the halls and right on Que. Doze spawns right as we're pulling the last named. I always appreciate a punctual pixel. Really I do.<br>
<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/doze_73102.jpg"><br>Flawless victory, yet again. (I don't count the two deaths to a mid fight add. You shouldn't either. It was big and had pointy teeth.)<br><br>
<p class="body">As far as loot from the armor farm (haha that's funny)... Four items dropped out of a complete HoT clearing. Excuse me?<br><br>
But we did get symbols/tears to complete a couple of those caster shields for Quasimyth, Alchork, and... (who's getting third one? No one tells me anything.) that I don't give a crap about (caster lewt, pfft), as well as some sort of boots or something that Welamix seemed hot and bothered about, Bleweyes got the first Tear for that quest as well. OH! I almost forgot, got the last piece I needed for my nice dragon toof. Now I just need to go suck it up and convince Telk that me killing him those few times last week was really just a big misunderstanding. Yes Telk.. I'm really your friend.. Would you like a nice box of chocolates?<br><br>And thus endeth our night of sucketh. I'd post more Screenshots but no one emailed me any, so there.<br><br>

Yes yes, I'm taking things over. First thing I did was cleaned up the page a lil' bit, it was a freakin mess! You can get to our past news (not really relevant anymore, I know) via the archives link at the bottom of the page. As Sylv said, the shots he posted are far from all of them, considering we've done most of those multiple times as well as Statue, Doze, etc. but I won't rehash past victories as such, I'll be updating much more promptly with our ongoing success and growth. So far we haven't failed to kill anything we've put ourselves up against so expect a lot more dead pixels!

      This update is long overdue. Everytime I set aside to work on the page something came up. Then some changes to the FTP server knocked me outta the loop for a bit. Anyhow no excuses. Rasil will be taking over the website for the time being so that we can get some more timely updates. And, I can get some other things done without feel guilty about skimpin on the page ;P. Here is a smattering of pic's from some of our triumphs over the last month. They are  far from all of them, but they were the best of the ones I had.
