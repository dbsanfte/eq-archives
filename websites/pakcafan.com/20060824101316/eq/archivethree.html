<p class="body">So we've been playing around in Anguish a bit, and I've been slacking a lot.  Partially because of work sucking, and partially because I am lazy, but this doesn't mean we aren't making any progress!  
We've been taking a look at some of the new encounters, have gotten a bunch of really nice augs, and are getting our clerics re-acquainted with their clickers... You know, fun stuff like that.<br><br>
And well, we haven't found any goats in there yet to get any ass shots of, so how about some cat ass instead? :)</p>
<p class="body"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Turezero.jpg" width="400" height="418 alt="" border="0"></p>
<p class="body" align="right"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Turedead.jpg" width="500" height="247" alt="" border="0"></p>
<p class="body">Exciting, isn't it?<br><br>
Well, how about this one?</p>
<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Keldovan.jpg" width="550" height="283" alt="" border="0"></p>
<p class="body">Not bad for our 2nd week into Anguish I'd say... Expect Warden Hanvar's corpse shot up here soon as well, we've got his number for sure.<br><br>
We've seen some damn nice drops so far as well, take a look for yourself!</p>
<p class="body"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Stability.jpg" width="446" height="272" alt="" border="0"><br>
<i>Congrats Werthor and Maboroshi!</i></p>
<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Legion.jpg" width="445" height="237" alt="" border="0"><br>

<p class="body" align="right"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Sorrowmourn.jpg" width="447" height="294" alt="" border="0"><br>
<i>Congrats Cooks!</i></p>
<p class="body">We've also gotten a couple of the tier two quest armor drops that got turned into some pretty nice gear...<br>
- <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70854">Gladiator's Plate Sleeves of War</a> - Congrats Skywiser!<br>
- <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70940">Glyphwielder's Gloves of the Summoner</a> - Congrats Qilamar!</p>
<p class="body">Recruitment is basically closed at this point.  We may consider exceptional players with very high play time in some areas, but to be 	considered you will need to be decently geared and flagged along with 300+ AA.  
You would also need to have all anguish signets finished and turned in for any guilded recruitment to start.  If you have any questions, look an officer up in game.</p>

<p class="body">For those of you who didn't think we were progressing fast enough, may I present you with some simple addition...</p>
<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/MPGdates.jpg" width="550" height="400" alt="" border="0"><br>
<img src="Images/Screenshots/MPGall.jpg" width="457" height="237" alt="" border="0"></p>
<p class="body">That's right, we're an <b>ANGUISH</b> guild now!  We're sorry we took so long to finish these trials off, we'll try to go faster next time.  We'll try, we really will, but we seem to have some pesky lockout timers keeping us from doing some of our later wins again...</p>
<p class="body">All kidding aside, it feels great to have all our hard work finally paying off.  Things were looking pretty grim towards the end of last year.  With the release of EQ2 and WoW our numbers dwindled, and we were barely able to scrape up the numbers to kill a sand giant.  
We pushed through all of this though, recruiting like mad, gearing up like mad, and backflagging like mad.  Things were really starting to look up.  We were progressing again, we'd beaten Inktu, gotten our first King kill, and had our sights set on the Queen, Tacvi, and Anguish.<br><br>
And then we had the server merge...<br><br>
And we also had finals, graduations, vacations, etc.  It was spring, with summer just around the corner.  Our numbers always drop this time of year, we were not to concerned.  We did lose a few to the real world, a few due to personal issues, and a few more to the promise of fame and fortune.  
But again, we were not overly concerned.  We buckled down, changed our focus a bit, and went full steam into MPG to start beating these trials down.  I don't think any of us truely believed we would get through them so quickly, but after our first wins in our first couple trials, we knew it would not be long at all.<br><br>
I want to thank each and every member of Pak for the continued support of this guild.  Thank you for logging on, thank you for your patience, thank you for playing your chars to the best of your abilities, and mostly, thank you for sticking with the guild we all love when the going got rough.<br><br>
We did get a few more nice items on our first Corruption and Hatred wins...</p>
<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Fearsomeleather.jpg" width="458" height="238" alt="" border="0"><br>
<i>Congrats Deze and Legdaen!</i></p>
<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Corrupterwrist.jpg" width="429" height="230" alt="" border="0"><br>

<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Darkironbow.jpg" width="458" height="256" alt="" border="0"><br>
<i>Congrats Tlaloc!</i></p>
<p class="body">And unfortunately had another nice item go to the land of rot...<br>
- <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47254">Muramite Aggressor's Bulwark</a><br>
It's a nice item, just seems to have the wrong classes listed on it. :(</p>
<p class="body">In other recent trial runs we got some more neat stuff...<br>
- <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47238">Band of Eternal Gaze</a> - Congrats Aluaeia!<br>
- <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47225">Pendant of Stilled Time</a> - Congrats Welaker!<br>
- <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47245">Mask of Uncanny Sight</a> - Congrats Zukuk!<br>
- <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47226">Sapphire Choker of Adaptation</a> - Congrats Kinador!<br>	
- <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47239">Ring of Fluid Perception</a> - Congrats Shadyzar!<br>
- <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47218">Sandals of Constant Change</a> - Congrats Zertette!</p>
<p class="body">More coming soon!  We hope to finish up our 2nd round of trials and step foot into Anguish for the first time as a guild sometime late this week!<br><br>
Before that though, we've got to finish our signets!  Some of us have been doing some serious slacking lately, and now it's time to get our butts into gear!  
It's pretty funny to look at the guild tool on a US holiday and see 50+ people online and 99% of them are in this instanced zone or that crowded zone scrambling to get their signet quests done.  It's going to be pretty embarrasing if we have to report that the mighty Pak was unable to zone into Anguish because some barely blue mobs in Draniks Hollow wouldn't cough up their rings...<br><br>
Get to work, and we'll see you in Anguish!</p>

<p class="body">We've gotten 4 MPG Trials down this month, and another is very much within our reach. :) We're close now, and we can feel it!  
I think we're closer than a lot of us felt we would be at this point, and what an amazing feeling it is.<br><br>
This has left many of us scrambling to finish off our signet quests, myself included, so I better keep this update short and get to work!<br><br>
Expect more updates soon!</p>

That's ok tho, we're halfway there!<br><br>
We know we still have a lot of work ahead of us, but to go from zero trials down to three trials down in a weeks time feels like nothing in this game has before.  We will make it to Anguish, and we will do it soon.  Keep up the hard work Pak, I know we can do it!<br><br>
Enough of that sappy crap tho, here are the spoils of our victory!:</p>

We've also not forgotten about GoD.  We're still playing around there occasionally too.  We've become slightly partial to Inktu'ta... This zone is just so fun, and the drops are pretty nice too.

Well, last week was no differant.  We formed, we buffed, got everybody ready to go and then we clicked... Nothing.  We kicked people out, camped out, reformed, checked expo timers, stood on our heads.  Still nothing.<br><br>
Rather than spend the day frustrated trying to get past the bug, we decided the revisit the King in Riftseekers in search of a little bit of payback.  After several hours of hard work by all, we came up with this...</p>

<i>Congrats Nazlug!</i></p>

<p class="body">Mostly tho, we had a lot of fun.  Was a nice change from the norm, and happy to say that we've found some new farm mobs.  Thanks to all who came out and put in the time and effort to make this happen.</p>

<p class="body">This is just the beginning of our push forward, expect more big things out of Pak in the near future.<br><br>
Pak'Cafan is still recruiting on a limited basis.  We're especially looking for Warriors, Paladins, Rogues and Wizards, but any classes are welcome to apply.  Look up an officer in game for details.  On the subject of Wizards tho, one of our very own recently got a new high nuke crit.  I told him that I would post it up for all to see, as I agree that it was pretty impressive.</p>

<i>Of course, it's hard to do twice when you are laying down</i></p>

<p class="body">We've been having a great time recently, and really have picked up some great recruits since the EQ2 and WoW fallout.  It feels great to be moving forward again finally.</p>
