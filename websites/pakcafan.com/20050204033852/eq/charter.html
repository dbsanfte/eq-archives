	<p class="body">As of 2/01/05, recruitment is <b>LIMITED</b>. I encourage everyone who is interested to group with Pak members at every opportunity and to talk to an officer about consideration. We are looking for outstanding people with high play time and a good attitude who are willing to work together.<br><br><B>RL Age Requirement:</B> Being that some of our discusions late at night 

    have a mature theme to them, we urge applicants to be adults -- and at the 

    very least, not the sensitive type.  If you are of age, Late Night Pak Chat(tm) 

    is something we all look forward too when we are in a mood to do so.. :)<br><br> Generally, if you wonder what is and isn't acceptable, I will give you a general idea. If you're in a room of 70 people at a party with varying ages from 18-50 with both males and females of varying backgrounds and up-bringings, some of which you are close with and some of which you are merely casual friends with, that is how you're expected to judge what is and isn't appropriate. In such a situation, unless you had absolutely zero command of proper social skills, would you bring up the same things you would bring up for discussion while sitting with your buddies, drinking beers, and watching a football game. The distinction here is general, but it relies mostly on common sense.</p>

	<!-- Title End -->
	
	<!-- Body Start -->
	<p class="body">Our guild is a highly selective guild.</P>

  

  <p class="body">The first step in deciding on whether or not you wish to join Pak'Cafan is 

    to read the charter below (and the rest of the website if you so choose) and 

    see if our principles align with yours, and is something you think you wish 

    to be a part of.</P>

  <p class="body">The next step is to let <a href="http://www.pakcafan.com/forums/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&u=392">Krezlin</a>, <a href="http://www.pakcafan.com/forums/privmsg.php?mode=post&u=15">Welaker/Alchork</a>, or <a href="http://www.pakcafan.com/forums/privmsg.php?mode=post&u=501">Kaktharka</a>(or any other officer) know of your intentions of joining. They will make sure you meet our requirements and start the process. In addition to talking to either of them, post a message in our open EQ forum, <a href="http://www.pakcafan.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=4">Wandering around Norrath</a> to introduce yourself please.</p>

  <p class="body">A prospective applicants application will then be posted in a closed forum for the general membership to comment on. This stage is there to let members comment on those who are wishing to join Pak’Cafan. This post will be open for a one week period only and will be removed once the seven days have passed. At this point, if there is no negative feedback determined to be grounds for refusal to join by the officers, the applicant will be placed in Cub status.</p>

  <p class="body">Once an applicant enters the Cub status they will be guilded and gain access to the membership forums. Cub status will last for a minimum of one month after which the applicant will be evaluated again. The factors we look at are attitude and participation. 
    While attitude really isn’t anything set in stone, as people vary, we do expect people to be friendly and helpful towards fellow guild members. 
    Participation is based on raid attendance which really is our only quantifiable criteria. We look for a 40% attendance of attendable raids, which are determined to be raids that the applicant could possibly attend given flags/level access restricted areas. Our raid schedule is posted in a closed member forum and is updated to reflect current goals. Raids are spread out over the week and usually fall into the est/pst timezone with some exceptions for targets requiring less participation.</p> 

  <p class="body">After a minimum of 1 month has passed, the applicant will be voted on by the officers to determine 3 possibilities; removal from the applicant status and from the guild, extended cub period, or promotion to full member.</p>

  <p class="body">Removal from the guild will be done because of failure to meet the above mentioned requirements. Non participation or bad attitude will result in removal both as each of these are important for membership.</p> 

  <p class="body">Extended Cub period will be given to those who were unable to meet the criteria due to outside factors (we all have lives outside of the game) or questionable issues such as barely failing to meet the attendance requirement or attitude. At this point an officer will talk to the applicant about what is keeping them from promotion to full member in hopes of resolving the issue(s) that exist. Re-evaluation will be done again in 1 month period at which point officers will vote again, except for this time there will be no more extension to cub period but rather just a promotion or removal.</p>

  <p class="body">Promotion to full member will give the applicant full rights as other members.</p>

	<!-- Title End -->
	
	<!-- Body Start -->
	<p class="body">A current guild member may have another character accepted into Pak'Cafan 

    if they meet the following criteria.<br><br>
	
	The first character to be accepted into Pak'Cafan must obtain level 70.<br><br>
	
	 The first character must have been in the guild for a duration of 2 real life months of full membership.<br><br>
	
	
	The second character to be admitted into Pak'Cafan must have obtained the 65th level.<br><br>A single person may 

    only have two personas in Pak'Cafan.</p>
	<!-- Body End -->	
	
	<!-- Title Start -->
	<p class="title"><B>Hand Me Down Policy</B></p>
	<!-- Title End -->
	
	<!-- Body Start -->
	<p class="body">I'm not sure how many of you view the &quot;Hand me down&quot; 
      policy, but the officers have come to a consensus about how &quot;Hand me 
      downs&quot; should work. First of all, let me start with the basics. When 
      an item comes into your hands that you have obtained, then if that item 
      replaces a piece of equipment, then the replaced item should be handed down
      to the next person of your class that can use it. In other words if it replaces
      an item you wear, then you have to hand the item replaced down. But if it 
      is an item you win that you do not use/wear, you may do with it as you wish.</p>

    <p class="body">Now there is a few exceptions to the policy and that is if<br>
      <b>1.</b> The item replaced is No Drop, in which case it can't be handed down.<br>
      <b>2.</b> The item replaced could be better used as resist gear/raid gear<br>
      <b>3.</b> There is no one who wants/needs the item replaced(within reason)</p>
	  
    <p class="body">Now this is where it gets difficult. When handing down an 
      item there are some things to consider. I will make a list for you, in no 
      particular order, that should be used when evaluating the item to be handed
      down.</p>

    <p class="body"><b>1.</b> An approximate level needed to obtain the item<br>

      <b>2.</b> Your class has priority(within reason)<br>
      <b>3.</b> Main characters are priority, alt characters are secondary<br>
      <b>4.</b> Any classes that could better use this item</p>

    <p class="body">Now to touch up on each of these.<br>
      <b>1.</b> Level needed to obtain the item. Figure out what level is needed
      that could possibly obtain the &quot;hand me down&quot; in a full group.<br>
      <b>2.</b> Your class has priority(within reason). Always try to hand down 
      an item within your class first<br>
      <b>3.</b> Main characters are priority, alt characters are secondary. A 
      main character should always have priority before giving to an alt.<br>
      <b>4.</b> Classes that could better use the item. Figure out which class
      would make better use of the &quot;hand me down&quot;. Who would benefit
      more?</p>
	  
	<p class="body">So in closing, this is the information and knowledge that
      you should keep in mind when choosing to hand down an item. <br>
    </p>
	<!-- Body End -->	
	
	<!-- Title Start -->
	<p class="title"><B>Code of Honor</B></p>
	<!-- Title End -->
	
	<!-- Body Start -->
	<p class="body"><b>1.</b> Be willing to help your family out in times of Dire need. 
	Exception being your removal from a group putting them in dire need.<br><br>
	
	<b>2.</b> Always be willing to
    help those less fortunate than you. This is different from providing when
    asked. Charity and Begging are two different things entirely.<br><br>
	
	<b>3.</b> Respect, Honor, Truth, 
    always hold these three values tight. Above all else, respect your family/guild.<br><br>
	
	<b>4.</b> Take care of your Family,
    they will take care of you.<br><br>
	
	<b>5.</b> Wear your Guild Tag 
    at all times. Be proud of your family, of what you belong to. If an instance
    deems that you need to go anon, put on the Role-play switch, don't just go 
    anon. (Exceptions are if you're in trader mode.)<br><br>
	
	<b>6.</b> Pak'Cafan is not here
	to provide its members with groups (ie we don't owe you groups when you log
    on) but what we do provide is a pool of people to pull from when looking or
    making your own groups.<br><br>
	
	<b>Rankings:</b> The world of Everquest has only
    three ranks in their world, a guild leader, officers, and members. We will
    adhere to this, but have also added ranks within each of those divisions.
    See the Ranking detailed section on this page for this information.<br><br>
	
	<b>Grouping:</b> If you are in a group that gets 
    an opening, try to fill it from the guild or our guild applicants before auctioning
    the spot off to the zone. This not 
    only builds relations within the guild and you end up having a lot of fun as 
    well (not to mention a lot less bickering). Every members goal should be to
    convert any group into an all guild group (Assuming you couldn't get into 
    a guild group when you logged on).<br><br>
	
	
	<b>Participation out of Game: </b>It is your responsibility
    to keep up to date on the main news page, as well as the members board. We
    all have lives, but it doesn't take much time at all to check the main page
    and then the message board before you log in. The importance of this cannot
    be underestimated.<br><br>
	
	<b>Discipline: </b>Should there be something that
    occurs that is in violation of our ethic and morals the officers will meet
    on said persons behalf and talk amongst themselves. The vote of removal must
    be unanimous in cases of removal. Possible other disciplinary action may be
	suspension from raid privileges, demotion from given rank, etc..<br><br>
	
	<b>Cub Status: </b>When someone is accepted into
    the guild, they first become a cub for four weeks. At this time the cub can
    leave the guild at any time for any reason. At the same time, any officer 
    can remove any cub at any time with or without reason, and without the above
    said officers meeting. At the time of full membership, the passwords to the 
	guild only sections of the message board will be distributed. Cubship may be
	extended for any reason deemed necessary by the officers for an undetermined
	length of time.<br><br>
	
	<b>Role Playing: </b>To place the emphasis
    on friendships rather than items. With friends, an unsuccessful camp can still
    be a day of fun... while a camp with strangers can be nothing more than unending
    frustration when that item never comes your way.<br><br>

  	Which is just part of the last point...<br><br>
	
	<b>Last Word: </b>Have fun together, and enjoy your
    time here on Norrath with us. Its so much more fun with family and when you
    play for fun, not loot. Remember that, and remember the honor you have in 
    being a member of the Pak'Cafan!</p>

	<p class="body"><b>Cub</b><br><br>
	
	This is the initial ranking of new member of Pak'Cafan. Cub status lasts at 
	least four weeks from the date of the actual induction of the prospective member.
	This allows for an appropriate participation-based title to be offered at the 
	end of the Cub period. For additional information on Cub status please check 
	the Guild Charter.<br><br>
  	
	<b>Pak Hunter</b><br><br>
	
	This is the core backbone member population.  Attends raids frequently, groups with Pak members frequently, and has achieved level 70 with a minimum of 200 AA's. <br><br>

	<b>Dire Wolf</b><br><br>
	
	Long standing dedication to Pak'Cafan and it's values and interests. Proven raid attender and always groups with fellow guild members.<br><br>

	<b>Elder</b><br><br>
	
	Shows leadership potential for either raid or class. Proven long standing member with the guild's interests first and foremost. Future officers are cultivated from this rank.<br><br>

	<b>Officers</b><br><br>
	
	Though officers come from the Elder pool it is not realistic to expect that level of participation at all times. Again RL issues must take precedence and with that understanding, Officers rankings may go as low as Pak Hunter. An officer who's participation merits a Lone Wolf ranking may have their officer ranking reevaluated by the other officers.<br><br>

	<b>Lone Wolf</b><br><br>
	
	Lone Wolves have basically disappeared and are not attending guild events, grouping with Pak or participating on the boards. They are also those people who have been reprimanded for behavior issues.<br><br>
  
	<b>All the rankings in Pak'Cafan are not based on time requirements but on four areas that regard conduct:</b><br><br>

	<b>1. Guild event participation.</b><br><br>
	
	This mostly pertains to raids but also other objectives that occur in game.<br><br>
	
	Exception &#150; Not everyone can attend all raids due to RL conflicts and in some cases these are consistent issues to where a person may never get to attend raids on some nights. These kinds of conflicts can be offset by participation in the on-the-fly events that happen (e.g. Guild member makes a request or comes up with an idea for a multi-group objective).<br><br>

	<b>2. Pak groups.</b><br><br>
	
	This is where we learn our tactics and to rely on each other when things get hairy. It is also where we get our time to bond with other Pak members and is the cornerstone of the family. People, when they are online, who neglect Pak groupings are really neglecting the core, fundamental element of being in a guild. If you are grouped with non-Pak and one of the group leaves. Look for someone in guild channel first. If someone is LFG in guild chat and you are in a group you are not very attached to, by all means, disband and go duo somewhere. As a member of Pak you should be actively seeking other members of Pak to hunt with. Of course this does not mean that we exclude anyone, in fact, the more people who know the quality of people in Pak'Cafan the better. We will attract those like-minded souls and continue to grow in numbers.<br><br>

	Exceptions &#150; If already grouped, members are not expected to just disband as soon as someone in Pak logs in and calls LFG in guild chat. Also if you are grouped and a cleric drops and the group starts shouting/oocing for another healer and a Pak Wizard is LFG in the guild channel, do the right thing and not invite the wizard into the group. We have to remember that while we have an allegiance to Pak, we must also consider what the group needs.<br><br>

	<b>3. Activity on the boards.</b><br><br>
	
	Please RSVP for raids and respond to requests for assistance. If there is a thread you have an opinion about, share it. This is where people can participate in Pak without having to be online. If a guild member is having RL issues and can't log into EQ the boards are we would hope people would pop in and say hi and let us know what is going on in. This guild is a big tight-knit family and we like to hear how things are going especially if we don't get to see you.<br><br>

	<b>4. Adherence to Pak policies and values.</b><br><br>
	
	This includes the hand-me-down policy. It also includes offering help to those members that need it for CR's, Ports, etc.<br><br><br></p>
