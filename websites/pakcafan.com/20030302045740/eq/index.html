<p class="body">Pretty fun fight, but damn, we had people coming out of the woodwork! We had to have like, 15-20 bots along for the fight, just to get flagged. Was pretty funny. That and we helped out some of the slackers from the other guilds too. All in all, was a good fight and a good victory.  But that's not it!

	<p class="body">Wheee! PoP fun… Took down this freak in what amounted to be a, uh… Well, it wasn't pretty. But from what I hear, it's never pretty. The first attempt was great though.. Our strat was solid and tight, we all knew what we were doing, why we're doing it, and all that jazz.. The call to charge… Uh, you know what? Revised plan on the fly, let's just bend over and die! Yeah, it was ugly.</p>

<p class="body">In other news, I'm going to let the rest of this update be a journey of your imagination. I'll guide your imagination, however, fear not.. for I am with you..</p> 

<p class="body">You see, first the update would talk about things like how badass we were.. Yes, that's right.. A lot of talk about how anti-zerg we are, uh huh.. now you have it. The screenshots, yes.. can't forget the screenshots… there are a lot of them, uh huh.. all NToV mobs… with a few BoT mobs thrown in for variety, you know.. to prove how leet we are. And then I'll talk about my penis size for a bit, right.. good.. you've got it now.  I'll, in some way, correlate it with how few it took us to take down mobs from 2 expansions ago.. That's right, cause we're bad ass…  And then I'll make fun of other guilds, you know.. for sucking so hard.</p> 

<p class="body">Or, you know.. I can just say 'Hey, another clearing of NToV in our farmage. All mobs have duplicate screenshots further down the page. That is all.'</p>

<p class="body">But anyway, back to Aerin'Dar.. what a crazy ass fight! Certainly not a mob I'd like to do *often*. We'd have to have 20 more peeps for me to feel comfortable in making it a sure shot every time cause that dude is just freaky. Eh, oh well.. At least the guild has a new zone to romp around in. We'll be hitting the other gateway mobs real soon like as well. I love it, really pisses those people with real lives off. Nyah nyah! We can go here and you can't! Play more EQ!</p>

<p class="body">Bleh, SOE can go to hell, those bastards.</p>

<p class="body">OH YEAH!.. On behalf of our fearless, smelly, long winded (in so many ways), leader.. I'd like to thank Kemble (Formerly, Milosch) for betting him $100 bucks we couldn't whack AD. Hah.. JACKASS!</p>

<p class="body">Lovely patches, just lovely. Yes, this is sarcasm. Random ports to bind? Falling through the world like the walls are made of paper? Ugh, I think most our members spent more time in the dev box then anywhere in ToV yesterday. Oh and then they depop a damn near full NToV pop right as we get ready to pull Aary. Thankfully Aary came back right away along with Dagarn, so the day wasn't a complete waste. </p>

<p class="body">But we killed stuff despite wanting to shoot ourselves out of abject frustration. True, we cut the raid short after about an hour and all went out and drank heavily, but who cares, right?  On to the kills..</p>

<p class="body">Lord Kreiz was a no show, that puss. And we left the triplets up for those aspiring monks out there (Read: Their loot table sucks) But all in all, not a bad haul for 4 hours of raiding. Well, 5 if you add the hour from the previous day. </p>

<p class="body">And I still can't bring myself to post loot because, well.. I really can't think that anyone cares.  I mean, I guess I could brag about how 'we did it with this many and no deaths!' and, you know.. proclaim how anti-zerg we are, but really, who gives a shit? I know I don't.

<p class="body">An announcement to make in regards to recruitment. Well, basically. It's <b>CLOSED</b> with the notable exception of two classes, namely <b>bards</b> and <b>clerics</b>. If you're a bard or cleric that wants to join a tight nit group of kick ass people, look us up. Give a tell to any officer in game or especially Gromlok for details. You can give me a tell too but I'm like, politician slick baby, and will probably try to sell you something while I'm at it.<br><br> 

But aside from that, we've been killin' shit cause, you know, it's like.. what there is to do. Besides all the rampant cyb0ring. We've done NToV, Ring wars, RoS, been farming the hell out of the tower bosses in BoT, getting our peeps flagged for various zones, you know.. Just all around fun. EQ has actually been pretty darned enjoyable lately. Expect us to make some major strides into PoP in the near future.<br><br>

Anyway, here are some random SS that I happened to remember to take throughout the mayhem.<br><br>

<p class="body">All in all, BoT tower bosses are actually a lot of fun. Smaller raid force encounters are some of the best fights in the game. Not that these freaks are overly hard or anything, but they are still amusing. Especially Hailstorm, that was a lot of fun :). Now, if they'd actually drop something to make the trip worth it 100% of the time… But alas, enough people bitch about the game so I don't have to. Either way, it's fun. I'm looking forward to dying against Agnar in the very near future. I'm sure that'll be a blast as well.

<br>So we went back to ST with a few more keyed, it was 29 of our numbers against all that ST could throw at us. Now, let me explain something going into this. We didn't really do our homework. In fact, we flat out goofed off and played video games when supposed to be doing home work and claimed our retard half-brother that lives in a cage, ate the shit. <br><br>Okay, well.. we did know the first Ancient dispelled. We learned that the hard way last time.. "Oh neat, he dispells! Imagine that!" Eh, so anyway...<br><br>

<p class="body">Eh so, first one and third one were complete push over's. The second one was just annoying and the last? Feh.. He sucked. But it was neat because we didn't have any idea as to what to expect. No idea if they all dispelled or what they all did, all in all, I like the way they are done. All are different enough to keep things interesting so you adjust your tactics a bit for each one. But it was a lot of fun going in blind and figuring it out on the fly. We knew we had all night to screw around if we failed, didn't have anyone rushing us, so it was back to the basics of why this game is fun. You and your favorite group of people, trying to figure out a game and having fun doing it. Net result? We've owned 100% of ST!</p>

<p class="body">Riiiight, so anyway.. That's it for.. Oh shit, I completely spaced it.. We went to BoT tonight with a few groups and whacked this guy:</p>

<p class="body">Er... Now that's it :). We've been doing other crap, Ring wars, RoS', first broods out the arse, yadda yadda. But yeah.. it's late, I'm sick, and that's all you're getting!<br><br>

	<p class="body">So while I'm away from the game taking care of RL crap, Pak sneaks off and starts farming NToV. Of course, everyone else is too busy farming lootz to do their own update, those bastards, they just send me some lame screenshots.. "Oh, look at us, we're killin leezards!".. ya, well.. If I'm not there, it DIDN'T HAPPEN! They don't really understand that, kinda annoying... But at any rate, here are a few screenshots of the farmage. Yes, I know.. they suck since I didn't take them, you all are really too kind. Gromlok tries, really, he does. He can't help it, you see.. He's really fat.

<p class="body">Now, I think they've actually bagged all but the Vulak ring and Lady Nev but I could be mistaken, since I haven't been around.. But I should be around more often now so there should be proper updates.
