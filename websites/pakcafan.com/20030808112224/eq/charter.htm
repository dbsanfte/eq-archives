<P align="center"><font CLASS=headingwhite>Restrictions on Guild Acceptance</FONT></P>







<P><CENTER>

      As of 5/01/03, we are restricting applications to a few key classes (enchanters and clerics (maybe even a druid or two, but you have to be subservient! :P)) and those who show the dedication and desire necessary to join our family. As always, we're looking for outstanding people. The minimum level for obtaining membership into Pak'Cafan is now 65. Furthermore you must be flagged for PoV/PoS, PoNB and BoT. But please, if you are interested in joining Pak'Cafan at a later date but do not yet meet the minimum prerequisites, use this opportunity to get to know us. Group with our members, make yourselves known and make friends in the guild. <br><br>
   </CENTER>
  </P>

  <P><B>RL Age Requirement:</B> Being that some of our discusions late at night 

    have a mature theme to them, we urge applicants to be adults -- and at the 

    very least, not the sensitive type. If you are of age, Late Night Pak Chat(tm) 

    is something we all look forward too when we are in a mood to do so.. :)<br><br> Generally, if you wonder what is and isn't acceptable, I will give you a general idea. If you're in a room of 70 people at a party with varying ages from 18-50 with both males and females of varying backgrounds and up-bringings, some of which you are close with and some of which you are merely casual friends with, that is how you're expected to judge what is and isn't appropriate. In such a situation, unless you had absolutely zero command of proper social skills, would you bring up the same things you would bring up for discussion while sitting with your buddies, drinking beers, and watching a football game. The distinction here is general, but it relies mostly on common sense.</P>

</CENTER></P>







</strong>

  <P>Our guild is a highly selective guild. We have all experience levels, from 

    before our level limit change, however we are mostly 65.</P>







  

  <P>The first step in deciding on whether or not you wish to join Pak'Cafan is 

    to read the charter below (and the rest of the website if you so choose) and 

    see if our principles align with yours, and is something you think you wish 

    to be a part of.</P>

  <P>At this point you will need to obtain 3 referals from members of Pak'Cafan 

    (officer referals count as 2). If you wish to join us, you probably know a 

    few of our members. If you know of some members who wish to sponsor you, you 

    need to approach them and ask them if you can use their name as a sponsor. 

    Once you have their permission, please send <a href="mailto:balaghar@alltel.net">an 

    email</a> providing the three sponsor's names. Once a background check has 

    been completed, an application will be sent.</P>

  <P>Fill out the application then return it. That is the last step the applicant 

    needs to do. At this point, the returned application is sent out to all the 

    officers via email and is voted on. Once a majority is reached the applicant 

    is informed of the decision.</P>

  <P>When first invited the applicant becomes a cub. (see Cub Status below for 

    more information) The cub is still bound by any and all rules and regulations 

    of Pak'Cafan. The guildtag will be above your head, and your actions will 

    reflect the guild as a whole.</P>

  <P>Once the Cub period has ended, the now former cub gains access to all memebrs 

    only areas of the forums and website.</P>

  <P>This isn't designed to be a short procedure. Those who are truely interested 

    in Pak'Cafan will take the time necessary to go through all the steps to become 

    a Pak member. The rewards of the strong tight knit family and a fun group 

    of people to hang around with is well worth the effort.</P>

      <FONT CLASS=headingwhite>Multiple-Character Policy</FONT>

    </CENTER>

  </P>

  <P>A current guild member may have another character accepted into Pak'Cafan 

    if they meet the following criteria.</P>

  <P><IMG SRC="Images/safbul3a.gif"



HEIGHT="12" WIDTH="12" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> The first character 

    to be accepted into Pak'Cafan must obtain level 60.</P>

  <P><IMG SRC="Images/safbul3a.gif"



HEIGHT="12" WIDTH="12" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> The first character 

    must have been in the guild for a duration of 2 real life months.</P>

  <P><IMG SRC="Images/safbul3a.gif"



HEIGHT="12" WIDTH="12" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> The second character 

    to be admitted into Pak'Cafan must have obtained the 50th level.</P>

  <P><IMG SRC="Images/safbul3a.gif"



HEIGHT="12" WIDTH="12" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> The person controlling 

    both personas must agree, and adhere to the discontinuation of any and all 

    twinking of their second character that has gained acceptance into Pak'Cafan. 

    This is on an honor system, but any proven abuse of this specific rule may 

    lead up to and including removal of both personas from the guild.</P>

  <P><IMG SRC="Images/safbul3a.gif"



HEIGHT="12" WIDTH="12" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> A single person may 

    only have two personas in Pak'Cafan. You cannot swap personas. Nor can you 

    ever have more than two personas in Pak'Cafan at any time.</P>

  <P><IMG SRC="Images/safbul3a.gif"



HEIGHT="12" WIDTH="12" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> By gaining the guildtag 

    on your second character you are agreeing to all the privileges and restrictions 

    of the guild and our policy's.</P>

  <P><img src="Images/safbul3a.gif"



height="12" width="12" naturalsizeflag="0" align="BOTTOM"> When does your alt 

    not become an alt any longer? When that alt at least supercedes your previous 

    characters level, or reaches level 61. Or if that character is played 

    for more than 75% of the time you are online. For a less definate version 

    -- what character do you log on first 75% of the days you play.</P>

  <P>If any of your personas don't agree with this any part of this policy, don't 

    take the time and effort of bringing that second character into Pak'Cafan.

    <p><font class=headingwhite>Hand Me Down Policy</font> </p>

    <p align="left">I'm not sure how many of you view the &quot;Hand me down&quot; 

      policy, but the officers have come to a consensus about how &quot;Hand me 

      downs&quot; should work. First of all, let me start with the basics. When 

      an item comes into your hands that you have obtained, then if that item 

      replaces a piece of equipment, then the replaced item should be handed down 

      to the next person of your class that can use it. In other words if it replaces 

      an item you wear, then you have to hand the item replaced down. But if it 

      is an item you win that you do not use/wear, you may do with it as you wish.</p>

    <p align="left">Now there is a few exceptions to the policy and that is if<br>

      <b>A)</b> The item replaced is No Drop, in which case it can't be handed 

      down.<br>

      <b>B) </b>The item replaced could be better used as resist gear/raid gear<br>

      <b>C) </b>There is no one who wants/needs the item replaced(within reason)</p>

    <p align="left">Now this is where it gets difficult. When handing down an 

      item there are some things to consider. I will make a list for you, in no 

      particular order, that should be used when evaluating the item to be handed 

      down.</p>

    <p align="left"><b>1.</b> An approximate level needed to obtain the item<br>

      <b>2.</b> Your class has priority(within reason)<br>

      <b>3.</b> Main characters are priority, alt characters are secondary<br>

      <b>4.</b> Any classes that could better use this item</p>

    <p align="left">Now to touch up on each of these.<br>

      <b>1.</b> Level needed to obtain the item. Figure out what level is needed 

      that could possibly obtain the &quot;hand me down&quot; in a full group.<br>

      <b>2.</b> Your class has priority(within reason). Always try to hand down 

      an item within your class first<br>

      <b>3.</b> Main characters are priority, alt characters are secondary. A 

      main character should always have priority before giving to an alt.<br>

      <b>4.</b> Classes that could better use the item. Figure out which class 

      would make better use of the &quot;hand me down&quot;. Who would benefit 

      more?</p>
	<p align="left">So in closing, this is the information and knowledge that 

      you should keep in mind when choosing to hand down an item. <br>

  <P><FONT CLASS=headingwhite>Rankings: </FONT>The world of Everquest has only 

    three ranks in their world, a guild leader, officers, and members. We will 

    adhere to this, but we will also be adding ranks within each of those divisions. 

    See the page on Ranks for this information. Update (9/8/00) -- Rankings for 

    the officers have been more clearly defined. Member rankings to be forthcomming.</P>

  <P><FONT CLASS=headingwhite>Grouping:</FONT> If you are in a group that gets 

    an opening, try to fill it from the guild or our guild allies before auctioning 

    the spot off to the zone. always try to fill it with your family, this not 

    only builds relations within the guild.. you end up having allot of fun as 

    well (not to mention allot less bickering). Every members goal should be to 

    convert any group into an all allied group (Assuming you couldn't get into 

    a guild group when you logged on). [ Current allies are Fists of Tunare ]</P>

  <P><FONT CLASS=headingwhite>Participation out of Game: </FONT>It is your responsibility 

    to keep up to date on the main news page, as well as the members board. We 

    all have lives, but it doesn't take much time at all to check the main page 

    and then the message board before you log in. The importance of this cannot 

    be underestimated.</P>

  <P><FONT CLASS=headingwhite>Discipline: </FONT>Should there be something that 

    occurs that is in violation of our ethic and morals the officers will meet 

    on said persons behalf and talk amongst themselves. The vote of removal must 

    be unanimous in cases of removal.</P>

  <P><FONT CLASS=headingwhite>Cub Status: </FONT>When someone is accepted into 

    the guild, they first become a cub for four weeks. At this time the cub can 

    leave the guild at any time for any reason. At the same time, any officer 

    can remove any cub at any time with or without reason, and without the above 

    said officers meeting. The cubship period ends when the Dominant Male recieves 

    votes from the Kennel Master and Assistant Kennel Master gives their blessings. 

    At the time of full membership, the passwords to the guild only sections of 

    the message board will be distributed. <FONT SIZE="-1"><I>If votes from the 

    KM and AKM end in 2 - 0 in favor of the cub, the status is dropped, and tenure 

    is gained. If it is 1 - 1 the cub status is prolonged 2 weeks prior to voting 

    again. If the vote is 0 - 2 against the cub then the KM and AKM will adivse 

    the Dominant Male on a suggested corse of action. These numbers won't be made 

    public to the cub, but give an idea of how we decide the Cub Status. ***additional 

    note*** The KM and AKM also have the option to vote undecided at a KM/AKM 

    meeting if they haven't been exposed to the cub enough to form a valid vote. 

    Such an undecided vote will automatically act as if it was a 1-1 vote.</I></FONT></P>

  <P><FONT CLASS=headingwhite>Role Playing: </FONT>To place the emphasis 

    on friendships rather than items. With friends, an unsuccessful camp can still 

    be a day of fun... while a camp with strangers can be nothing more than unending 

    frustration when that item never comes your way.</P>

  <P>Which is just part of the last point...</P>

  <P><FONT CLASS=headingwhite>Last Word: </FONT>Have fun together, and enjoy your

  </P>

  <P align="center"><FONT CLASS=headingwhite>Loot Rules</FONT></P>
  
  Updated 11/27 

<P><FONT CLASS=headingwhite>Philosophy:</font></p>

<p>As Pak’Cafan grows in power and member base the needs of the guild change. In the past, randoming and then weighted randoming suited the guild nicely. Now, however, with the goals of the guild growing ever higher and our power level reaching to achieve these goals, we have come to a place where we need a more structured, logical and controlled system in determining the disbursement of loot to assure fairness for everyone. In addition, the officers are not comfortable with the stress and arguments that are inherent in the current system. The goal was to develop a system that was fair to everyone, and that everyone would abide by, including the officers.</p> 

<p>The following system is similar to published DKP systems but alleviates many of the problems inherent in those systems. Much like a DKP system, it takes the randomness out of the loot system and does not burden the officer core with the decisions (i.e. Merit Based), while still fairly rewarding participation.</p> 

<P><FONT CLASS=headingwhite>Mechanics:</font></p> 

<P><FONT CLASS=headingwhite>Attendance</font> – Attendance will be taken for all officially sanctioned Pak’Cafan raids. Each time attendance is taken you will receive 1 attendance point. The timing of attendance taken will vary depending upon the type and length of the raid. For a single target raid, attendance will be taken at the time of mob engagement. For a multi target raids, attendance will be taken at each target. Long raids with no specific goal in mind, i.e. HoT armor farm/named crawl, attendance will be taken at specific time intervals (approx. 2-hour intervals). For long extended single target raids, attendance may be taken more than once.</p>

<p>Attendance logs will be posted within 48 hours of the raid in question, and ratios on the 'master sheet' updated to include them at that time. Members have 1 week from the raid so that those people can check that they have been accounted for on the raid. The logs will become *final* after the 1 week period has past, and cannot be revised.</p> 

<p>Attendance for a failed raid will only count if we do not make another attempt at the target that day. These points are subject to approval by the officers.</p> 

<p>There will never be closed guild raids. If attendance points are given for an encounter, the guild will be notified and any that want to attend are welcome.</p> 


<P><FONT CLASS=headingwhite>Loot Value</font> – When a player acquires an item that item is then added to that player’s total cumulative loot value.</P>

<p>The loot value of particular items is currently listed in the "Call to the Hunt" thread in our forums. This list is subject to change as encounters are trivialized and loot for said encounters become commonplace.</p> 

<p>In addition, all loot/attendance ratios will be used from the most recent 'master sheet'' available to the membership. This 'master sheet' may or may not include raids within the last 2 days before finalization, depending on when the officers have time to update it in their 48-hour window. The important thing to note here is that the 'master list' available to the membership of point totals will be gospel, and changes made after the fact due to an attendance contention will *not* be retroactive to loot won in the meantime, only to the point ratio moving forward. All contentions on attendance lists will be handled by the officers and accepted or declined based on available information</p> 

<p>Attendance points and loot points never reset or roll off. Loot and attendance taken today will still be reflected in your total points a year or two from now.</p> 

<P><FONT CLASS=headingwhite>Additional Eligibility</font> – Each item will also have additional eligibility requirements in two forms above and beyond a class suggested hierarchy</p> 

<P><FONT CLASS=headingwhite>Class hierarchy:</font> Each item will have a suggested class hierarchy that lists what classes the item is best suited for. If no one of the ideal class is interested or present in the item, it then follows the listed hierarchy in eligibility.</p>

<P><FONT CLASS=headingwhite>Level eligibility:</font> The standard for most loot will be level 55 minimum required, however, loot for higher end raid encounters will be level 60+. As the guild progresses in power and the saturation of particular loot increases, these levels can be lowered as needed. For instance, BP of Vindication could be lowered to level 55 or removed altogether.</p> 

<p>Rare loot will require activity in the form of 25% raid attendance over the last month. Standard loot will not have a percent attendance requirement.</p> 

<p>Membership is expected to attend at least one raid per calendar month. Those members not meeting this attendance requirement will be assessed a monthly maintenance fee added to their loot total.</p> 

<p>A new member joining the guild enters into an introductory ‘cub’ period. At the conclusion of this cub period this new member is charged a membership fee added to his loot total and becomes a full member. A member in his cub period may not receive loot over any full member regardless of ratio.</p>

<P><FONT CLASS=headingwhite>Loot Ratio</font> – This is what ultimately determines the winner of a particular item. The loot ratio is determined by dividing the player’s loot value by the total number of raids attended. When an item drops, those interested in said item will give a tell to the specified officer who will then look up the interested parties recorded stats and assuming all eligibility requirements are met, the person with the lowest loot ratio is awarded the item. </p>

<p>An example of loot ratio:</p> 

<p>Player_A has taken 3 loot points and has 30 attendance points for a ratio of (0.1). Player_B has taken 1 loot point and has 20 attendance points for a ratio of (0.05). If Player_A and Player_B were both interested in an item, Player_B would receive as he has the lower ratio.</p> 

<p>There is no waiting period for loot valued items. Provided one has the loot ratio, he can take as much loot as he wants. However each item taken worsens one's ratio.</p> 

<P><FONT CLASS=headingwhite>Merit clause</font> – On occasion there will be a situation where the officer core will reserve the right to override the current loot system to merit a particularly important item. If an item is merited, the loot value will be assigned to the merited player's total.</p> 

<P><FONT CLASS=headingwhite>Bots/Alts</font> – If no mains are interested then the item will be opened to any Alts, if no Alts are interested, then any bots on the raid may be considered. The loot value of the item will be assigned to the owner of the bot/alt.</p>

<p>Raid critical bots (as determined by the officers) will receive half attendance credit for their owner. The person playing the bot will receive full credit, but can never receive more than one attendance point per attendance no matter how many toons are played. (i.e. if a person plays themself and a bot, they will only receive raid credit for 1).</p> 

<P><FONT CLASS=headingwhite>Invites</font> – Any invites are eligible for loot that no guild members opt for. Example: If monk only item drops and there are no guild monks present, the invite monk may then loot the item.</p> 

<P><FONT CLASS=headingwhite>Unwanted Loot</font> – If no one present on the raid is interested in an item the item must rot. However if the item is tradable or if it can be multi-quested, an officer will loot it to either sell for guild funds or hold until later to complete the quest. Under no circumstance will the loot value of the item be discounted or given for free. If a member wants the item, the value for that item MUST be assigned to their loot value.</p> 

<P><FONT CLASS=headingwhite>Non Loot Value items</font> - There are items that will not have a loot value. An example of a non-loot value item is HoT plate gloves. For these items, the current weighted ranking roll will apply (1-1000 for Pak hunters, 250-1250 for dire wolves and up). If you win a non-loot valued item, you are not allowed to roll again that night. Note: This is no change from our old loot policies.</p> 

<P><FONT CLASS=headingwhite>Epics and other quests</font> - Nothing prohibits a group of friends from helping each other with epics and other quests. However if it involves requiring full guild help, a loot value will be assigned</p>
