            <p class="newstext"> Thank you for expressing interest in joining 
              Pak'Cafan in the world of Dark Ages of Camelot. The full fledged 
              recruitment procedures are now in place. These will undoubtedly 
              be tweaked over time, but for now, the following will be how we 
              progress with our recruitment in Pak'Cafan:</p>
            <p class="newstext">Anyone who is interested in Pak'Cafan must have 
              at least 2 sponsors that are willing (and MUST) to post on the boards 
              that you are a good person for Pak, and Pak is a good place for 
              you. What this means is that you will email <a href="matilo:ainingfist@hotmail.com">Ainin</a> 
              (our recruitment officer) with your intentions to join and the names 
              of your sponsors. At this time, <a href="matilo:ainingfist@hotmail.com">Ainin</a> 
              will wait until your references post on the message boards under 
              a thread he starts in a private forum before sending you an application 
              for admittance. When you return your application to him, the officers 
              will vote, and when a 3/4 majority of the votes are in one way or 
              the other, the decision will be made and you will be informed. If 
              the decision was made in your favor, you will then be accepted into 
              the cub program, which is outlined below, and on our <a href="../eq/charter.htm">EQ 
              charter page</a>. </p>
			<p class="newstext"> As you may read from our charter page in regards 
              to EQ, you will notice we have a cubship period in place for all 
              new members into our guild. What this does it allow both the new 
              member and the established members the ability to test out one another 
              to see if we mesh together. All members that have no relation to 
              our EQ guild will be cubs until further notice. What this means 
              is if we see that you are just not one of our people, nor have not 
              the moral integrity/family values/want to have fun that the rest 
              of us do, we will remove you with little to no explanation - and 
              hope that no feelings were hurt in the process. At the same time, 
              should you feel we aren't closer aligned to your personal philosophies, 
              please feel free to remove yourself with little more than a good 
              bye, and again no feelings will be hurt on the part of the guild 
              if you do choose to leave.</p>
            <p class="newstext"> The ranking system is now finalized in Camelot, 
              however should you prove to be an asset to the guild, you will find 
              yourself with an opportunity to be any rank that are open to the 
              general populace. The only ranks that are reserved are Ranks 0 and 
              1 (guild leader and Inner Council respectively).</p>
            <p class="newstext">
Please note that our guild is based on family/friend bonds while still maintaining a strong push to be a very elite fighting unit. Pak does not care about being uber, Pak does care about achieving lofty in-game goals while maintaining a reputation that is unmarred by pettiness or selfishness. And if we accomplish great things within DAoC and people call us 'Uber' so be it. We do not tolerate board flames, or harassment of any kind to any player for any reason.  Always know that the people that have come before you in Pak'Cafan have spent years (since April '99) to build our guild name to be the most honorable and trustworthy guild that we can possibly be.  We plan on continuing this tradition, while still having fun and defending our realm!</p>
            <p class="newstext">
The people who fit well in Pak are unselfish, mature people who use tact in their dealings with their fellow guild members and the general populace. If you do not have these traits you may want to look for another home. </p>
            <p class="newstext">
Now this does not mean that Pak is boring, a healthy sense of sarcasm and a sharp wit will take you far on the boards and in guild chat. Also there are times, especially later in the evening, where topics in the guild channel can be off color at best. If you are offended easily you may want to look for another home.</p>
            <p class="newstext"> If you are still interested in joining, please 
              feel free to email Ainin, and hopefully we will see you in Camelot 
              (Galahad server)!</p>
