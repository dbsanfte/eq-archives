  Back to the Halls of Testing we went Thursday night. For the first all Dragon 
  guild to raid in HoT on TM, it took us awhile to decide to go back. But that 
  is okay. Had a few good drops, but the best that came out of it were the following 
  pics.</p>

  A very dark day in America's History today... the World Trade Centers are bombed 
  and destroyed. I know I echo the thoughts of the entire guild when I say that 
  all of us in Pak'Cafan are thinking about those lost and their families. For 
  those of us who are religious will have those effected in our prayers, and those 
  of us who aren't will keep those effected in our thoughts. Call your families 
  if you can, let them know you love them. (if they are in NYC or Wash, DC please 
  wait to call to let the emergency calls go through)</p>

  Ahhh... its over again. 80+ hours and 42 hours. Alchork holds the shortest camp 
  to date of our Ragefests! I wanted to personally congradulate two very deserved 
  Clerics on obtaining their epics! Next I need to get a picture of all 4 of our 
  clerics together (/glare Kemble... /cackle Kemble) for the site.</p>

  THANK YOU PAK! For helping me complete my epic. Especially Rum, Sav, Chork/Frid, 
  Homy, Fera, Nala, Lassa, Iallal/Kyrin, Merl, Manuva, Khir, Elfi, Freyah, Brayz, 
  Caiden, Cazec, Calkin, Faethore, &amp; Unseekable (sp?).</p>
<p class=body><br>
  Just a brief recap<br>
  - Lavastorm - Eejag was trounced and only several of the melee's engaged him. 
  <br>
  - Plane of Air - Gwan of the Air got beat down and Alfrid recieved a Bracer 
  of Quiescence from the Thunderspirit Princess.<br>
  - Nurga - Rum woke the Sleeping Ogre <br>
  - Lake of Ill Omen - Vorash, Deep, &amp; Xenovorash got their @$$#$ handed to 
  them by only a little over 2 groups. Only 1 death which was Elfi. Elfi chased 
  Xeno by herself after some Shmuck Spectator aggrod him and brought him near 
  the Frontier Mtn zone.</p>

<p class="body">8-12-01<br>
  Not much to update, but I had some spare time on my hands so I decided to give 
  this ol web page an update! What I do want to do is enlighten you as to what 
  to expect in the last 4 months of 2001 in regards to Pak'Cafan.</p>
<p class="body">Currently we are expanding our guild into Anarchy Online. Preliminary 
  results are good, as it is really nice to have people in another game that you 
  know and can trust when you wish to get away from EQ. I hope that we will get 
  our own website up for our AO players soon. (Celinda, Sylv, /tap). Untill then 
  we have an AO specific forum on our message board that serves well for now.</p>
<p class="body">Okay, so this leads me to structure. How am I going to structure 
  the guild with all these ... games comming out? First off, EQ is still our main 
  focus, and I assume we will draw most of our membership from there for now. 
  I have the in game leader tag, as do our officers. I will remain the guiding 
  force for the entire breadth that Pak'Cafan assumes above and beyond the narrow 
  scope of EQ. I also remain the in game lead of EQ, but my officer core (being 
  well established there) have taken on a greater responsibility there. <a href="mailto:noigle@mediaone.net">Nazzerot</a> 
  has the in game lead of Anarchy (so see him for invites! - although the guild 
  system is VERY buggy right now in AO) and reports to me if he has any questions 
  on what/if he should do such and such. Nazz controls all the day to day life 
  of Anarchy Pak. Acceptance into AO Pak does not mean you get into EQ Pak, but 
  as of now - EQ Pak is auto acceptance into AO Pak.</p>
<p class="body">Okay, so we have to main 'shards' right now... what are we gonna 
  call em? I have started to call them Packs (wolf pack)... but Pack and Pak are 
  too similar. So I'd more than welcome ideas here to improve communication. Tribes? 
  Collectives? hehe. Shoot me an <a href="mailto:cougardc@home.com">email</a> 
  with your thoughts/ideas on this.</p>
<p class="body">The games that we are looking to expand to for years end are plentifull. 
  <a href="http://www.darkageofcamelot.com/">Dark Age of Camelot</a> is the next 
  out of the door. From the early polls, it doesn't look like we will be making 
  a mass exodus from EQ to DaoC (which is fine) but it does look like there is 
  enough interest to start up a Pak presence there. However, much like AO has 
  three sides (Omni, Clan, and Neutral), DaoC has three sides... and with DaoC 
  you can only have characters from a single Realm on a server, nor can you communicate 
  in any way with those outside of your realm. So it is very important that those 
  of us who will want to play DaoC together that we all pick the same <a href="http://www.darkageofcamelot.com/realms.html">realm</a>. 
  From the polls it seems that Hibernia will be the realm of choice. Mixelplux 
  has already volunteered to design the webpage for our DaoC pack, so we should 
  have that up in the next few months.</p>
<p class="body">I will also be looking for an in game leader for DaoC sometime 
  in the future. Keep in mind however, that the guild systems are very very intense 
  in DaoC, but in a good way. I wish I had the flexibility in EQ that DaoC is 
  creating. I don't wish to go further into detail so as not to breach my NDA. 
  I will probably be very involved in the early setup of Pak in DaoC, but I will 
  not be the in game leader for two packs at the same time.</p>
<p class="body"><a href="http://neverwinternights.com">Neverwinter Nights</a> 
  (NWN) will be the next out of the gates after DaoC. This will have a completely 
  different structure - inheintly due to the fact it isn't a MMORPG like we are 
  used to. What will happen here is we will more than likely have a Guild-Wide 
  NWN night, much like we have an EQ Thursday night raid now. Each pack will get 
  one night a week that they can urge all multi game players to play their game 
  (like our EQ Thursday night raids). On NWN's night, we will get together and 
  play. Being scetchy on the percise <a href="http://neverwinternights.com/about.html">details</a> 
  here, I will go no further. This pack will have a website as well, but so far 
  no one has stepped up and offered. Currently this is still in the infancy stage 
  of development.</p>
<p class="body">Shadowbane - Pak'Cafan will *not* have any official presense in 
  this game. I have heard very little talk about this game from you all, and to 
  be honest.. my gut is saying no on Shadowbane. Feel free to look into it if 
  that is what you so choose, but do know that Pak (At this time) will not be 
  expanding there.</p>
<p class="body">Okay, so I had more to talk about than I thought! Definately is 
  not our standard, we killed XYZ weeeee. Fall is coming up soon, and people should 
  be logging in more and more. Our family will grow, and we will maintain our 
  trust, honor, and friendships into whatever game we go to. We might not be the 
  best at the games, but we will always be surrounded by family as trustworthy, 
  honest, and as fun to be around that my officers and I have worked so hard to 
  maintain. And besides, when people know your guild for being decent, honorable 
  people -- and have been for over 2 years, that is something to be proud of.</p>

<p class="body"> <i>7-20-01</i><br>
  We had such a good time last Thursday that we again decided to go back to Kael 
  to whoop on some Giant Ass.... only this time we couldn't go do Tormax's area 
  cause it was camped and had to head over to the arena. Much poorer drops over 
  here, but we did manage to kill both prophets (first for us, however a very 
  easy kill both times) as well as The Angry (twice) and The Cold once to get 
  two arms and one pair of legs. Nothing remarkable... but this was much offset 
  by the guildchat of the evening. Go figure that the night Peregryn can play 
  on one of our Thursday night raids that none other than Ashirae shows up as 
  well. Needless to say the Femme Fatal was in force and giving the guildchat 
  a lively shot in the arm. Although the best quote by far had to have been from 
  one of our most outspoken member of the guild... surprisingly quiet last night.</p>
<p class="body" align="center"><img src="../Images/Screenshots/rumquote.gif" width="456" height="22"></p>
<p class="body" align="left">On another note: Sheylene was propositioned last 
  night to join the ranks of the Officer Core of Pak'Cafan, and decided to accept 
  the position late last night (too late in fact give her the in game tag). Her 
  specific duties are not yet outlined, but all of us Officers view her as a welcome 
  addition of the group and look forward to working with her hand in hand. Then 
  again, we did make Rumblar an officer, so our standards can't be that high =P</p>
<p class="body" align="left"><i>--Tyrack</i></p>
<p class="body"><i>7-12-01</i><br>
  We had planned to go to the arena in Kael but the Avatar of War spawning headed 
  us towards Tormax's chamber. We had a great night with multiple caster drops, 
  a Cloak of the Maelstrom, Coldain Skin Gloves and a quest Plate BP&nbsp;dropping. 
  We kept the yellows and reds coming all night and I&nbsp;personally went from 
  amiable to ally on my CoV&nbsp;faction. Great job Pak!</p>

<p class="body"><i>7-8-01</i><br>
  Fedmahn was able to take part in a multi group/guild effort to down Sev today, 
  and miraculously won the roll for the green scale -- hence, he finally has those 
  lightsabers he has so long deserved!! I wasn't able to visit him in person today 
  to get any screenshots, so send a few in, and I'll be sure to post them!</p>
<p class="body">In addition, I wanted to let you all know that Ainin has accepted 
  the responsibility as being the recruitment officer for Pak'Cafan. All public 
  inquiries as to joining Pak'Cafan, as well as sponsorship verification, application 
  process, and approval/decline to join will be going through Ainin now (no longer 
  me, weee). I'll be going through the website and changing over the email addresses 
  and making a bit more clear, but if any outsiders have any questions regarding 
  Pak'Cafan, please direct them to <a href="mailto:ainingfist@hotmail.com">Ainin</a>. 
  He will be more than happy to help you out. I'm very confidant that Ainin will 
  fill his role quite nicely, and I know for a fact he is looking forward to whooping 
  his fellow officers in shape that don't get their application votes in on time!</p>

  Hate yielded some cleric armor as well as several diamonds/BD's. Gratz to Rumblar 
  who is now one step closer to light sabres. Chardok was washed out so a quick

  pants. Gratz to the winners. I&nbsp;took screenshots but umm, my dog ate em?</p>

  Hahahhaha. Its been so long in comming, but we finally did it Pak. I've left 
  ourselves out of the BS Trak fighting for so long and I finally took the intative 
  to get off our asses and do it. And yanno what, it went awesome. Last weekend, 
  we nailed the Queen to the ground in 12 sec, this weekend we kicked Trak's ass 
  in 20sec. Not bad for having almost double the hit points! Needless to say we 
  did an absolute fantastic job, and we had alot of fun in the process! We have
