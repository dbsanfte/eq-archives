As it is all I have is this wonderful "foot shot" and the one of yours truely teaching you all that chanters are your masters. Bow to us and beg for Kei! Anyhow I want to congratulate everyone that helped to make this possible. 3 years worth of hard work has gotten us to this point and there is no where to go but up!

<p class="body" align="center"><img src="http://www.pakcafan.com/eq/Images/Screenshots/TheFight.jpg" width="450" height="350"></p><br>What a night! We went up to Hate and totally owned the zone! We had a total of 45 drops! A lot of which rotted but some people received some nice upgrades. We broke into hate flawlessly and just destroyed everything we pulled. Rasha pulled like a fekkin champ! Rummy and Gromlok tanked and spilt mobs without hesitation. We at one time had 40 people in the zone, some of which were guests. After we cleared the 1st floor Demi’s and clerics we headed up to Inny and smacked that mofo down in a short amount of time. Everyone should be proud of the effort and accomplishment! Hell I think we only had a couple of deaths when we were fighting Inny! I think everyone had a blast. This raid was just a litmus test of things to come for Pak’ Cafan! We can only grow stronger from this battle and I look forward to our next Raid!

I’m sure I missed a few drops along the way but after I got my Earth staff I just didn’t care if I died or if the whole guild somehow got outfitted in all Ntov armore. It was truly a great night.

<i>-Pontus 60th Arch Mage Pak'Cafan</i><BR><br>
<span class="body">5/2<br>
      I wanted to come here and make a post about what has been discussed recently 
      from the officers and raid committe, as to what is being proposed for our 
      future 'direction'. </span> 
      <p class="body">Now, I want to start off by saying that these are just ideas, 
        and they are coming primarily from people who really like to raid, so 
        your mileage may vary.</p>
      <p class="body">What we don't want to do is make this Uber_Guild_102. I 
        don't have the time for that, and many of you don't either. I think most 
        of us are adults, with jobs, and with other RL committments, and I don't 
        think gaming for 12-18 hours a day is a realistic demand for anyone in 
        this guild, myself included. So, if your dreams are to be the uberest 
        of the uber, I can fairly safely say that Pak'Cafan will never be there, 
        nor does it want to.</p>
      <p class="body">But, there is certainly a balance between the time-intensive 
        uber guilds and not doing anything that is large, challenging and exciting. 
        It is this balance that we will strive to achieve. I envision Pak'Cafan 
        doing great things in the next several months, and hopefully into the 
        forseeable future. I want to do things with people I enjoy and respect, 
        which is this guild.</p>
      <p class="body">For those of you who this will not happen fast enough (i.e. 
        you become disappointed that we aren't moving fast enough to reach our 
        lofty goals), please think about how much greater a success it is to accomplish 
        these goals beside your friends and family... beside people who are learning 
        with you as you learn... beside people for whom the thrill of victory 
        is just as great as it is for you... beside people who appreciate your 
        contribution to the raid and couldn't do it without you!</p>
      <p class="body">For those of you who feel we are moving too fast, try to 
        get involved and become a part of our ventures through any way you can 
        contribute. Messageboard posting of strategy evaluations, pats on the 
        back to your fellow guildmembers, and even just getting an extra level 
        or two are all things you can do to be a part of this great guild as it 
        moves forward.</p>
      <p class="body">In closing, please be aware that we will change *nothing* 
        about the people we want in this guild, the people we keep in this guild, 
        and the honor with which we treat other guilds and other people. We will 
        not recruit people, regardless of their character, in order to achieve 
        our raid goals, nor will we step over people who get in our way in pursuit 
        of the almighty 'loot'. The requirements to join this guild and fight 
        among us, although they may have higher level restrictions, will still 
        be based on the same requirements we have had for so very long. In other 
        words, the goals of this guild will change as we move, but the type of 
        person we want and keep in this guild will not be sacrificed.</p>
      <p class="body">Thanks for your time, and I hope we can have some thoughtful 
        discussion on what exactly these 'goals' are (as they are not yet clearly 
        defined) in the near future.</p>
      <p class="body"><i>-Derringer Labyrinth<br>
        Inner Council Member</i><br>
      </p>
      <p><span class="body">4/29</span><br>
        <span class="body">There was a recent outcry for information from some 
        of the guildmembers. One of bits of information was regarding what roles 
        do the officers play? What are their powers? I cannot answer for the game 
        specific aspects of EQ, but what I can speak of is Pak'Cafan in general 
        In one of the posts on our boards I had the following to say... </span></p>
      <p class="body">I cannot comment on the specific issues that have sparked 
        this thread, as well frankly - that doesn't fall under my umbrella of 
        duties </p>
      <p class="body">What I can do is provide everyone with a greater understanding 
        of how I have structured this guild. Think of it as a corporation if you 
        will. I am the CEO and President of everything Pak'Cafan. In any game 
        we might go to, I will have a hand in. Why? Cause back in May of '99 I 
        was the one who organized 10 people to create this guild, little else. 
        I showed the leadership to make this guild, and as such I got the GL tag.</p>
      <p class="body">It is now almost May of '02. This guild is almost 3 years 
        old now. This guild has now spread along 3 games (AO was a flop though.. 
        hehe) When a member leaves a game to play with Pak in another game - THEY 
        HAVE NOT abandoned Pak. They have shifted their priorities and interests.</p>
      <p class="body">I challenge ANYONE to say that I have abandoned Pak. Cause 
        according to posts above, I no longer play EQ - so I must have abandoned 
        Pak.</p>
      <p class="body">Inner Council: This was a rank I created specifically to 
        fit in the ranking structure of DaoC, but the role of the inner council 
        was one that I spread to encompass EQ as well. The role of the Inner Council 
        spreads all games that Pak might play. These members answer to me, and 
        they could be seen as Board members in our corporation example. These 
        members are few, and they are also members who not only expresses a key 
        trait (or more) of Pak, but their personal dedication and work FOR Pak 
        has gone noticed by myself, and they usually are a key player I know that 
        I can count on. Derringer, Ainin, Khirgoth, Waran are my Inner Council. 
        Any game spanning issue that might arise, these men will be involved. 
        (Please note: These members usually hold officer ranking in any game they 
        are involved in and do answer to their respective GLs while they are in 
        those games.)</p>
      <p class="body">Guild Leaders of individual games: Nalance is the GL of 
        EQ, I am the GL of DaoC, Nazz was the GL of AO. (note: I will never be 
        the active GL in two games at once). The GL's have near ultimate authority 
        in their own umbrella. They must manage the day to day affairs on their 
        own (asking help if need be). I do like to be informed of major changes 
        that might take place in their games, and at times hold veto power (although 
        to date, I have yet to do this). Nalance and Nazz both came to me with 
        issues they needed help on. Nala has also came to me if she had questions. 
        This is the role I play with my GL's. I am their confidant. Specifically 
        with Nalance: I led Pak in EQ for 2.5 years. And while I might not know 
        the specific nuances of all the individuals in Pak, my knowledge can provide 
        her with insights that she may overlook.</p>
      <p class="body">Officers in any game: Only answer to their specific Guild 
        Leader (who in turn answer to me.. yadda yadda yadda). The guild leader 
        is soley responsible for choosing their own officers and maintaining their 
        ranks. They fufill roles that their GL has assigned to them.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p class="body">On ranks crossing Games: This is evaluated on a case by 
        case basis. There is no standard other than this *is* the standard.</p>
      <p class="body">If anyone has any questions on Pak'Cafan, feel free to email 
        me at <a href="mailto:cougardc@cox.net">cougardc@cox.net.</a> My 
        email is always open, to Guild Leader and Cub alike and everything in 
        between. I have always tried to be nothing but understanding and fair, 
        while maintaining an atmosphere of fun and family. </p>
      <p class="body">We are Pak'Cafan. We are the honorable that strangers ask 
        to move gear. We are the just who never exploit. We are the true - to 
        ourselves and others. I am the Den Alpha, and I will lead you to new lands 
        while protecting our young. You are the wolves that make our pack strong 
        and diverse. </p>

        We got to a rocky start last night because HATE had already been cleared. 
        Thanks to that other guild for not adhering to the calendar system. We 
        rallied and decided to go to Chardok royals. We did an awesome job guys. 
        We went the short way down and did AE farther down than we had done before. 
        It worked great! We got to the prince in an hour after most of us got 
        there and were through with the prince, king, and queen within 3 hours! 
        </span></font></p>
      <p class="body"><font color="#FFFFFF"> Congratulations go out to Daranor 
        for the prince head, Andi for winning the random on the king note, and 
        Grom for the Queen blade! Also Incardine Helm dropped from queen and was 
        won by Lexinthis. The Incardine Breastplate dropped of the king and was 
        won by Trimus, who passed his roll down to the next in line Dulcinia. 
        This is why we are family! Trimus is leveling up his bard and realized 
        the BP would get better use on another tank. Grats goes to Etherea in 
        winning tanned iskar hide leggings. </font>

        <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) -->
        <!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->
        Pontus is the proud owner of a crown and lacks only one more item in his

        We'll have to go back real soon to see if he is less stingy next time.<br>

        Also of note, on a recent Chardok raid, we did acquire the prince head 
        for Cormanthel and he only lacks 2 items for his enchanter epic. We will

        Wizzy!!!!!!<br>
        <br>
        Sorry I haven't updated the mainpage in a while. I've been extremely busy 
        with the running of the guild online and on the message boards, plus Christmas 
        and New Years with the family. The new year will be even busier because 
        my professor talked me into taking asecond graduate class, so I'm taking 
        2 grad. classes,working full time, and family activities. Since I'm<br>
        not online a lot, I have named Rumblar and Savrarigasas my Generals. They 
        will be in charge when I am not online. Tallaas has agreed to be the web 
        editor, sowe'll update the main and character page morefrequently again. 
        Xeeker will now handle the recruiting program, which will free up some 
        of my online time.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        We have been very selective in adding new members and it has proven a 
        wise choice, since we have some great new members in our ranks. Since 
        all the newer members have completed their cubship, we are re-instituting 
        the former loot rules. As a review:&nbsp; 1) Cubs shall not roll all armor 
        randoms unless everyone in their class passes.&nbsp; 2) Pak hunters or 
        players under 55 random 1 - 1000.&nbsp; 3) Dire wolves and above that 
        are 55+ random 250 1250. 4) If you have won a piece on the raid do not 
        random again until everyone in your class has gotten a piece. (This does 
        not include items that have been deferred by all and goes to someone by 
        default) 5) For Velious quest armor, there are added stipulations a) you 
        must have indifferent faction to come&nbsp; b) ally faction (CoV for HoT, 
        and Thurgadin for Kael) to random on anything. c) if you have a thurgadin 
        armor piece and the same skyshrine piece drops, do not random unless all 
        others<br>
        in your class have the upgrade (or similar thurgadin piece).&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Epic quests -&nbsp;<br>
        1) Cubs should not ask assistance in epics.&nbsp;<br>
        2) If you are under 56, please do not work in earnest on your epics. You 
        should be concentrating on gaining levels that will help make the guild 
        stronger.&nbsp;<br>
        3) Epic items (unless they require turn in step) will be given to the 
        person who is farthest in their quest.If two or more people are at the 
        same stage in their<br>
        quest, the item will be randomed between those parties.<br>
        <br>
        We have had some very successful raids in the last month. Please remember 
        to follow the raid rules explicitely, as it will determine whether a raid 
        succeeds or fails.</p>

      <p class="body">I wanted to sneak in here and tell all of my EQ Family Happy 
        Holidays and a Happy New Year!</p>
      <p class="body"><i>--Cougar / Tyrack</i></p>
      <p class="body">11/06/01</p>
      <p class="body">It has been a fast start and we now have new officers. They 
        are Elfinia, Kenbo, Tetsuya, Savrarigas, Tallaas/Redblood, and Xeeker. 
        As of right now, no demotions will be handed out because people are playing 
        DaoC and the officers that are now playing DAoC will remain officers in 
        EQ. I will have it listed on the member list that those playing DAoC are 
        currently exploring other realms.<br>
        <br>
        We also have a number of new members. These new cubs are real life friends 
        of members currently in EQ. Please give them a warm welcome. I have a 
        request to all you new members, that you start posting on the message 
        boards please. The welcome letter should have all the information you 
        need on the message board etiquette. If you have not received a welcome 
        letter, please give a tell to one of the officers and give them your email 
        so they can send you one.<br>
        <br>
        One more temporary change has been made. While we rebuild our family, 
        the loot rules for raids will be changed for a short period of time. A 
        raid is defined on a planned or unplanned outing with 2 or more Pak groups.<br>
        <br>
        Cubs 1 - 1000<br>
        Pak hunters or below level 54 100 - 1000<br>
        Elders and above that are 55+ 250 - 1250<br>
        <br>
        These are general reminders during a raid. If you win an item, the item 
        it replaces is subject to the hand-me-down policy (unless it is no drop). 
        When you win an item, you are ineligible to random on any other item that 
        drops later in the raid unless everyone has won something. On droppable 
        items you may choose to put the original item you won back in the pool 
        to have a chance at the new item. The original item will then be re-randomed.<br>
        <br>
        Quest gems, blue diamonds, and diamonds will be placed in the guild bank. 
        These will be dispensed on an as needed, first-come first-serve basis. 
        Please only ask for quest gems when <br>
        1) you have the appropriate faction for the quest; AND<br>
        2) you have the other item (ie. Armor piece).<br>
        <br>
        In the next few months we will grow and start doing some of the upper 
        level gaming that was done previously, and do more! Please concentrate 
        on having fun, helping your family, and getting levels appropriate for 
        the high level raids that are so much fun!<br>

        leader of Pak'Cafan, Norrath</i><br>
      </p>
      <p class="body">10-27-01<br>
        First off, I wanted to thank everyone who posted their dismay or sadness 
        that I was going to be stepping down from the EQ Lead's position. That 
        has touched me, and not made this any easier. However, I know what I am 
        doing is what I wish to do... and as such will continue steadfast.</p>
      <p class="body">However, this is not a time for me.... for this day emerges 
        a new team member to the leadership core of Pak'Cafan, this day emerges 
        a friend rising above challenge, this day emerges a leader. This day, 
        the torch is passed, the mantle is set carefully on the shoulders of another, 
        the future rests in the very capable hands of the new EQ Pak leader. I 
        am very satisfied, happy, content, and secure in my choice of a leader 
        and their ability to perform and push EQ Pak to succeed and progress further 
        using our values and honor as a code. Nalance has accepted the position 
        of the EQ Leader in Pak'Cafan! Nalance has been with Pak sense she was 
        level 12 I believe and has always had Pak's best interests in mind - and 
        has always been one of those members who doesn't have to think to make 
        the right decision when honor is in question. Nala hasn't been the most 
        out spoken member in the terms of leadership, but she did successfully 
        arrange, prepare and help organize the entire RageFest camp when we stayed 
        in that god forsaken dungeon for damn near 6 days straight with the entire 
        guild supporting. That was no small feat. At any rate, this stage is no 
        longer mine to orchestrate, and as such will leave you with some remarks 
        from the new EQ Leader, Nalance.</p>
      <p class="body"><i>--Cougar Shadowstalker/Tyrack, Den Alpha and DaoC Lead 
        - Pak'Cafan</i> </p>
      <p class="body">Hello All,</p>
      <p class="body">I am honored in Cougar's faith in handing over the guild 
        leadership to me. I have been in this guild for over two years now, and 
        you are my family. Pak'Cafan is a guild of family oriented values that 
        Cougar and the officers forged. Under my leadership, these values will 
        remain. Some of our brethren have left for other realms, and we wish them 
        well. These family values of Pak should span the realms, as was Cougar's 
        vision. <br>
        Although we have reduced in size, we will survive, but I need the help 
        and cooperation of all of you remaining in EQ for us to prosper. We need 
        to stick together, as a family should, have positive attitudes, and most 
        of all play to have fun. We also need to spread out and seek out potential 
        candidates for joining Pak. <br>
        I talked to Sheylene last night and she is willing to stay as officer. 
        I will need her expertise and guidance during this transition. I will 
        be naming more officers in the next few days, when I get their acceptance 
        of becoming officers. I will also be hashing out a new, simple application 
        for Pak membership for the time being. We need to ease up our restrictions, 
        but still be selective in finding those out their with the same value 
        systems as Pak. The cubship program, rankings and loot rules will stay 
        the same. After we start to grow again, the officers and I will look at 
        the rankings for each of you and making adjustments where applicable.<br>
        In conclusion, my goals for the future of EQ Pak'Cafan are promotion of 
        family, growth of the membership with those with like values, and a promotion 
        of having fun. I play this game for relaxation, as do many of you. I do 
        not want us to have or create stress in this game. Stress is for the workplace, 
        games are for relaxation and enjoyment! J I hope you will support Pak 
        in this task of rebuilding. I look forward to the challenge! Thank you 
        all! If you ever need to contact me, my email address is<a href="mailto:natalee_w@yahoo.com">

      </p>
      <p class="body">10-23-01<br>
        I hate intro's.. I really do. You know you want to say something, but 
        you just want to get to the meat of the converstation. But you can't, 
        so you have to jibber jabber about this and that untill you feel that 
        you have gotten to the point where you can bring about the meat of your 
        post. How's the weather? Good weekend? Glad I asked, aren't you?</p>
      <p class="body">I wanted to let you all know that while nothing has been 
        talked about, and nothing has been posted - I have been working in the 
        background behind the scenes to give you what you all want - Leadership. 
        Unfortunately, my efforts have been fruitless in this endeavor, for many 
        reasons. I said back in my last large post/address when I was talking 
        about some of the major guilds ahead that I was not going to be the in 
        game leader for more than two pack's of Pak'Cafan, I meant it. However, 
        with AO coming and going and me keeping the lead in EQ, many might have 
        thought that I was going to still be here in DaoC. Perhaps I didn't make 
        my intentions clear enough... perhaps I wasn't sure myself. I am now.</p>
      <p class="body"><i>*steps off his Leader box*</i> Some of you have known 
        me for well over 2.5 years now, others a much shorter time. A few know 
        the true me, as many only see the leader that I have become, and that 
        I am. However, it is time for me to have fun again... and while I've beta 
        tested DaoC for over a year, I didn't realize how fun it truely was until 
        my friends and family surrounded me. Some who know me in the earlier years 
        (Pre-RoK) know I have a bit of Powergamer in me -- always with a thought 
        of my family in mind, but power gamer none the less. Being at the top 
        of our game in DaoC is a great feeling... being on the top of the top 
        is better. Getting published on camelotvault was awesome. But thats me, 
        and this is me being the leader <i>*gets back on*</i></p>
      <p class="body">The Future of Pak'Cafan is not at stake, that isn't even 
        an issue. The future of Pak'Cafan being an uber guild contender is. We 
        have always tetered on this delicate balance, and ended up flexing our 
        muscles enough that some of got to taste sweet victory on a couple of 
        really hard mobs. Many of us have epic weapons due to this guild and our 
        friends. Others don't. But Pak in EQ has never been there to provide items, 
        raids, or even groups to our members. We are here to provide a pool of 
        like minded individuals that have common interests and playstyles that 
        can join together and enjoy their time spent in this game we call EQ together.</p>
      <p class="body">It is now going to be back to that stage again for an undisclosed 
        period of time. I cannot, nor willnot predict when that time will come 
        again where we can set our sights high and achieve them. All I can do 
        is promote our family values and the things I have always preeched and 
        practiced. Pak will be there for any who wish to remain. Pak will not 
        go away... however I expect some to go away from Pak. Those who willnot/cannot 
        move to DaoC for whatever reason and enjoy the high level game will not 
        find it in Pak in the next few weeks/months to come. I will not hold you 
        here, but would love it if you did. </p>
      <p class="body">I could talk about that last topic for eternity.. so much 
        to say, but you get the drift. Point 2. I've asked a few people I had 
        in mind before DaoC release for leadership/officer positions and have 
        been turned down every time. So I am left with little choice in the matter... 
        If you are interested in being the in game lead for Pak'Cafan in EQ, please<a href="matilto:cougardc@home.com"> 
        email me</a> a full application as to why you should be the person. I 
        cannot tell you what to put in this email, but if you are interested tell 
        me why you should be the one, where you intend to take pak, and your willingness 
        to work with me (you won't be my puppet, but I would like to be consulted 
        on major policy changes). Please also email me if you want further clarifications 
        as to what I am going to expect, or what authority the EQ leader will 
        have. As far as officer positions, that will be up to the new EQ Leader 
        - if one steps up. One change I expect to see happen regardless of who 
        assumes control would be a lightening of our EQ recruitment procedures 
        to promote growth in EQ again.</p>
      <p class="body">One thing that needs to stop is the bickering between the 
        games. Like I said in one of my posts on the boards... EQ Pak is feeling 
        what they are and asking for help, and DaoC is getting defensive. Please 
        keep the discussions Civil and in line. Do not make any personal attacks 
        on people or on the 'other' game. We are all family here going through 
        a rough transition.</p>
      <p class="body">I am very much intune to what is going on in EQ, much thanks 
        to Sheylene and others who have kept me in the loop. I will remain in 
        tune as long as people keep me informed. Now it is time to pass the baton 
        off, and I challenge you to step up and take it from me. You all have 
        the part to become someone that can mold and guide this create creation 
        we call Pak'Cafan. Who will accept the challenge?</p>

        Well damn.. talk about a fun night. Started the night off by Promoting 
        Mixelplux to an officer. We had extended this offer to Mix back when Shey 
        was promoted, and he just now decided to accept it. Congrats Mix !</p>
      <p class="body">Well.. Mix then proceded to take us on a Mix style Raid 
        night. Started it off nice and easy with Lord Dojo (booties - Tet, Red 
        stone thingy - Dec). We then decided to go for a swim to take out the 
        phish for Connu's Druid epic.</p>
      <p class="body" align="center"><a href="Images/Screenshots/fish.jpg"><img src="Images/Screenshots/fishT.jpg" width="200" height="71" border="0"></a></p>
      <p class="body" align="left">By this time someone had given us word that 
        the Undead Bard was up for Syngr's Epic. We went.. unbeknownst to us we 
        had 2 nukers with us (niether 60). So we melee'ed the bastard down... 
        a bit more deaths than we normally do, but when you have all melee power 
        what do you expect?</p>

        Thanks to alot of work and effort from Mixelplux, our Dark Age of <a href="../daoc/index.html">Camelot</a> 
        website is now up and running! And as you can see our eq website has moved 
        to a semi new location. If you see any bugs or links that I happened to 
        miss in the site migration, please email me with that. Otherwise, go check 
        out the Camelot site and give your input to Mix when you talk to him next 
        in game!</p>

      <p class="body">9-30-01<br>
        For Immediate Release:</p>
      <p class="body">Pak'Cafan Today has announced it's intentions in the world 
        of <a href="http://www.darkageofcamelot.com/">Dark Age of Camelot</a>. 
        As many of you know, <a href="http://www.mythicgames.com/">Mythic Entertainment</a> 
        has created the newest MMORPG to hit the gaming shelves (Oct. 9th, 2001) 
        and in that world, we have decided to invade as a guild. In doing so, 
        there have been alot of hard choices to be made - with three Realms to 
        choose from and a multitude of servers to choose from. And now, 10 days 
        from the shipping date, it has been decided as to our plans there.</p>
      <p class="body" align="center"><font size="+1">Pak'Cafan will be defenders 
        of the Hibernian Realm on the server dedicated to Galahad.</font></p>
      <p class="body">For those of you that wish to play a Midguard character, 
        I recommend that you to play on the Galahad server so that you will find 
        fellow Pak'Cafan members there as well. However, this is merely a suggestion, 
        and *<i><b>not</b></i>* officially supported as a two realm guild. Mixelplux 
        will have our DaoC website up and running by the end of the week I am 
        hoping, so please help him by getting him screenshots and information 
        he needs. The first calendar month of EQ in Camelot we will have a loose 
        recruitment policy. In November we will reinstate a recruitment policy 
        more in line with the standards that we have created here in EverQuest.</p>
      <p class="body">Pak'Cafan will continue to flourish in Norrath as well, 
        even while some of our family are away playing as Celts and Firbolgs and 
        what have you. At this time, none of the current officers have expressed 
        the desire to take the in game title away from me (see post below about 
        me not wanting the in game title in two games) so for now, I will have 
        to retain that. In Novemeber, if the officers that have kept up their 
        play time decide that they need to recruit a new core of officers that 
        will be their perogative, hopefully that will give some of you a chance 
        at being a part of the leadership of this guild that I know some of you 
        have expressed interest in.</p>
      <p class="body">As such, there is a new Inner Circle of officers that will 
        make the decisions for the Guild encompassing ALL games we may or may 
        not play. Typically these people have been with us the longest, shown 
        the most interest in everything done, and generally have their finger 
        on the pulse of Pak'Cafan. These people include:</p>
      <p class="body">Cougar/Tyrack, Ainin, Derringer, Khirgoth, Feraldenar and 
        Redleaf/Waran</p>
      <p class="body">Due to the complex nature of the ranking system in Camelot, 
        details as to that will follow some days in the future - probably late 
        October as I flesh them out. If you have any questions or coments, please 
        post them in the DaoC forum under this thread. I thank you all for being 
        a part of this family, and I hope we can all continue to grow and prosper 
        (and have fun!) in any and all games we wish to expand to.</p>

        So I get this phone call at 10:00am PST or so... and its from Syngr. I'm 
        like, WTF we aren't doing a Rage camp, whats up?</p>
      <p class="body" align="center"><a href="Images/Screenshots/gore1.jpg"><img src="Images/Screenshots/gore1T.jpg" width="125" height="61" border="0"></a></p>
      <p class="body" align="left">Welp, it seems that Ms. Whitey was up and causing 
        a ruckus. So we teamed up with Enrapture (cause you know us PSTer's most 
        of us were still sleeping off our HoT raid from the night prior). In the 
        end it turned out to be about 23/23 Pak/Enrapture. Took two try's to get 
        everything down pat, but for the first time working in tandem with another 
        guild, I'd say that was perfect.</p>
      <p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/gore2T.jpg" width="350" height="185"></p>
      <p class="body" align="left">Well, the BARD who called me (I had been up 
        for 15min so far.. lucky SoB he is, lemme tell you) ended up getting his 
        scale. Only the fake trak to go for him to hand down all his dragon instruments. 
        Oh yea, there is that little something about some sword with a bunch of 
        notes, but thats the least of the important stuff, right? We did end up 
        getting Derringer the frost book for his FA (Ainin, where were you man?!) 
        and picked up a few spells (Mask of the Hunter and Aegis of Ro -- please 
        see Khirgoth for them when you hit 60). And the booby prize was a once 
        coveted item - the Heiro Crook (druid only). If you want this item, please 
        see Tyrack, as I will want to unload it - mains only.</p>
      <p class="body" align="left">Lots of HoT raids recently, lots of new armor. 
        And as such, I got myself a new BP - much nicer than the old one. And

  A very dark day in America's History today... the World Trade Centers are bombed 
  and destroyed. I know I echo the thoughts of the entire guild when I say that 
  all of us in Pak'Cafan are thinking about those lost and their families. For 
  those of us who are religious will have those effected in our prayers, and those 
  of us who aren't will keep those effected in our thoughts. Call your families 
  if you can, let them know you love them. (if they are in NYC or Wash, DC please

  Not much to update, but I had some spare time on my hands so I decided to give 
  this ol web page an update! What I do want to do is enlighten you as to what 
  to expect in the last 4 months of 2001 in regards to Pak'Cafan.</p>
<p class="body">Currently we are expanding our guild into Anarchy Online. Preliminary 
  results are good, as it is really nice to have people in another game that you 
  know and can trust when you wish to get away from EQ. I hope that we will get 
  our own website up for our AO players soon. (Celinda, Sylv, /tap). Untill then 
  we have an AO specific forum on our message board that serves well for now.</p>
<p class="body">Okay, so this leads me to structure. How am I going to structure 
  the guild with all these ... games comming out? First off, EQ is still our main 
  focus, and I assume we will draw most of our membership from there for now. 
  I have the in game leader tag, as do our officers. I will remain the guiding 
  force for the entire breadth that Pak'Cafan assumes above and beyond the narrow 
  scope of EQ. I also remain the in game lead of EQ, but my officer core (being 
  well established there) have taken on a greater responsibility there. <a href="mailto:noigle@mediaone.net">Nazzerot</a> 
  has the in game lead of Anarchy (so see him for invites! - although the guild 
  system is VERY buggy right now in AO) and reports to me if he has any questions 
  on what/if he should do such and such. Nazz controls all the day to day life 
  of Anarchy Pak. Acceptance into AO Pak does not mean you get into EQ Pak, but 
  as of now - EQ Pak is auto acceptance into AO Pak.</p>
<p class="body">Okay, so we have to main 'shards' right now... what are we gonna 
  call em? I have started to call them Packs (wolf pack)... but Pack and Pak are 
  too similar. So I'd more than welcome ideas here to improve communication. Tribes? 
  Collectives? hehe. Shoot me an <a href="mailto:cougardc@home.com">email</a> 
  with your thoughts/ideas on this.</p>
<p class="body">The games that we are looking to expand to for years end are plentifull. 
  <a href="http://www.darkageofcamelot.com/">Dark Age of Camelot</a> is the next 
  out of the door. From the early polls, it doesn't look like we will be making 
  a mass exodus from EQ to DaoC (which is fine) but it does look like there is 
  enough interest to start up a Pak presence there. However, much like AO has 
  three sides (Omni, Clan, and Neutral), DaoC has three sides... and with DaoC 
  you can only have characters from a single Realm on a server, nor can you communicate 
  in any way with those outside of your realm. So it is very important that those 
  of us who will want to play DaoC together that we all pick the same <a href="http://www.darkageofcamelot.com/realms.html">realm</a>. 
  From the polls it seems that Hibernia will be the realm of choice. Mixelplux 
  has already volunteered to design the webpage for our DaoC pack, so we should 
  have that up in the next few months.</p>
<p class="body">I will also be looking for an in game leader for DaoC sometime 
  in the future. Keep in mind however, that the guild systems are very very intense 
  in DaoC, but in a good way. I wish I had the flexibility in EQ that DaoC is 
  creating. I don't wish to go further into detail so as not to breach my NDA. 
  I will probably be very involved in the early setup of Pak in DaoC, but I will 
  not be the in game leader for two packs at the same time.</p>
<p class="body"><a href="http://neverwinternights.com">Neverwinter Nights</a> 
  (NWN) will be the next out of the gates after DaoC. This will have a completely 
  different structure - inheintly due to the fact it isn't a MMORPG like we are 
  used to. What will happen here is we will more than likely have a Guild-Wide 
  NWN night, much like we have an EQ Thursday night raid now. Each pack will get 
  one night a week that they can urge all multi game players to play their game 
  (like our EQ Thursday night raids). On NWN's night, we will get together and 
  play. Being scetchy on the percise <a href="http://neverwinternights.com/about.html">details</a> 
  here, I will go no further. This pack will have a website as well, but so far 
  no one has stepped up and offered. Currently this is still in the infancy stage 
  of development.</p>
<p class="body">Shadowbane - Pak'Cafan will *not* have any official presense in 
  this game. I have heard very little talk about this game from you all, and to 
  be honest.. my gut is saying no on Shadowbane. Feel free to look into it if 
  that is what you so choose, but do know that Pak (At this time) will not be 
  expanding there.</p>
<p class="body">Okay, so I had more to talk about than I thought! Definately is 
  not our standard, we killed XYZ weeeee. Fall is coming up soon, and people should 
  be logging in more and more. Our family will grow, and we will maintain our 
  trust, honor, and friendships into whatever game we go to. We might not be the 
  best at the games, but we will always be surrounded by family as trustworthy, 
  honest, and as fun to be around that my officers and I have worked so hard to 
  maintain. And besides, when people know your guild for being decent, honorable 
  people -- and have been for over 2 years, that is something to be proud of.</p>

<p class="body">A special thanks to Rumblar for a job well done in dealing with

  We had such a good time last Thursday that we again decided to go back to Kael 
  to whoop on some Giant Ass.... only this time we couldn't go do Tormax's area 
  cause it was camped and had to head over to the arena. Much poorer drops over 
  here, but we did manage to kill both prophets (first for us, however a very 
  easy kill both times) as well as The Angry (twice) and The Cold once to get 
  two arms and one pair of legs. Nothing remarkable... but this was much offset 
  by the guildchat of the evening. Go figure that the night Peregryn can play 
  on one of our Thursday night raids that none other than Ashirae shows up as 
  well. Needless to say the Femme Fatal was in force and giving the guildchat 
  a lively shot in the arm. Although the best quote by far had to have been from 
  one of our most outspoken member of the guild... surprisingly quiet last night.</p>
<p class="body" align="center"><img src="../Images/Screenshots/rumquote.gif" width="456" height="22"></p>
<p class="body" align="left">On another note: Sheylene was propositioned last 
  night to join the ranks of the Officer Core of Pak'Cafan, and decided to accept 
  the position late last night (too late in fact give her the in game tag). Her 
  specific duties are not yet outlined, but all of us Officers view her as a welcome 
  addition of the group and look forward to working with her hand in hand. Then 
  again, we did make Rumblar an officer, so our standards can't be that high =P</p>
<p class="body" align="left"><i>--Tyrack</i></p>
<p class="body"><i>7-12-01</i><br>
  We had planned to go to the arena in Kael but the Avatar of War spawning headed 
  us towards Tormax's chamber. We had a great night with multiple caster drops, 
  a Cloak of the Maelstrom, Coldain Skin Gloves and a quest Plate BP&nbsp;dropping. 
  We kept the yellows and reds coming all night and I&nbsp;personally went from 
  amiable to ally on my CoV&nbsp;faction. Great job Pak!</p>

  Fedmahn was able to take part in a multi group/guild effort to down Sev today, 
  and miraculously won the roll for the green scale -- hence, he finally has those 
  lightsabers he has so long deserved!! I wasn't able to visit him in person today 
  to get any screenshots, so send a few in, and I'll be sure to post them!</p>
<p class="body">In addition, I wanted to let you all know that Ainin has accepted 
  the responsibility as being the recruitment officer for Pak'Cafan. All public 
  inquiries as to joining Pak'Cafan, as well as sponsorship verification, application 
  process, and approval/decline to join will be going through Ainin now (no longer 
  me, weee). I'll be going through the website and changing over the email addresses 
  and making a bit more clear, but if any outsiders have any questions regarding 
  Pak'Cafan, please direct them to <a href="mailto:ainingfist@hotmail.com">Ainin</a>. 
  He will be more than happy to help you out. I'm very confidant that Ainin will 
  fill his role quite nicely, and I know for a fact he is looking forward to whooping 
  his fellow officers in shape that don't get their application votes in on time!</p>

  Hate yielded some cleric armor as well as several diamonds/BD's. Gratz to Rumblar 
  who is now one step closer to light sabres. Chardok was washed out so a quick 
  detour to Kael offered up some niced druid chain armor and quest guantlets + 
  pants. Gratz to the winners. I&nbsp;took screenshots but umm, my dog ate em?</p>

  Looking back over the past week we hit PoG (Gratz to Rasil and Chamber on the 
  assassins gear)&nbsp;and we finished up Tierra's and Tetsuya's epics. I&nbsp;think 
  Faydedar is still getting over the beating he received and maybe next time I&nbsp;will 
  remember to take some screenshots. Gratz to the both of you.</p>

  Well..we finally made it to the Halls of Testing. Another long term goal finally 
  met. I didn't get as many screenshots as I had wanted, so of the entire 2 screenshots 
  I got, the left screen will be the good one. UPDATE: More pics recieved via 
  email.<a href="../../hot.htm"> Check it out!</a></p>
<p class="body">Oh yea... I almost forgot. I got this tell during the raid:
uh huh... 25 people to Halls of Testing, man aren't we rivaling 
    the Zerg Uber guilds of the server. *shakes head* Hey, does this mean I'm 
    like Tigole now from <a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.com">Legacy of Steel</a>?</p>

  Hahahhaha. Its been so long in comming, but we finally did it Pak. I've left 
  ourselves out of the BS Trak fighting for so long and I finally took the intative 
  to get off our asses and do it. And yanno what, it went awesome. Last weekend, 
  we nailed the Queen to the ground in 12 sec, this weekend we kicked Trak's ass 
  in 20sec. Not bad for having almost double the hit points! Needless to say we 
  did an absolute fantastic job, and we had alot of fun in the process! We have 
  all worked hard to reach this goal, and we can only get stronger from here on 
  out.</p>

  em up here for yas.</p>

  Well today we had a good day in Chardok. Got 8 epic pieces, a pair of kick ass 
  cleric gloves, and a shield for Merlman. Also was the first chance I got to 
  see our Clerics side by side with their epics that we got them last week. Below 
  is a before and after, and no Kemble isn't really a DE... just a blind ass human!</p>
