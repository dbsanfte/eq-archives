     <p class="body">11/06/01</p>
      <p class="body">It has been a fast start and we now have new officers.  They
	are Elfinia, Kenbo, Tetsuya, Savrarigas, Tallaas/Redblood, and Xeeker. As of
	right now, no demotions will be handed out because people are playing DaoC
	and the officers that are now playing DAoC will remain officers in EQ. I will
	have it listed on the member list that those playing DAoC are currently
	exploring other realms.<br>
	<br>
	We also have a number of new members.  These new cubs are real life friends of
	members currently in EQ.  Please give them a warm welcome.  I have a request
	to all you new members, that you start posting on the message boards please.
	The welcome letter should have all the information you need on the message 
	board etiquette.  If you have not received a welcome letter, please give a
	tell to one of the officers and give them your email so they can send you one.<br>
	<br>
	One more temporary change has been made.  While we rebuild our family, the loot
	rules for raids will be changed for a short period of time.  A raid is defined 
	on a planned or unplanned outing with 2 or more Pak groups.<br>  
	<br>
	Cubs 1 – 1000<br>
	Pak hunters or below level 54 100 – 1000<br>
	Elders and above that are 55+ 250 - 1250<br>
	<br>
	These are general reminders during a raid.  If you win an item, the item it 
	replaces is subject to the hand-me-down policy (unless it is no drop).  When 
	you win an item, you are ineligible to random on any other item that drops 
	later in the raid unless everyone has won something.  On droppable items you
	may choose to put the original item you won back in the pool to have a chance
	at the new item.  The original item will then be re-randomed.<br>
	<br>
	Quest gems, blue diamonds, and diamonds will be placed in the guild bank.  These
	will be dispensed on an as needed, first-come first-serve basis.  Please only
	ask for quest gems when <br>
	1) you have the appropriate faction for the quest; AND<br>
	2) you have the other item (ie. Armor piece).<br>
	<br>
	In the next few months we will grow and start doing some of the upper level
	gaming that was done previously, and do more!  Please concentrate on having fun,
	helping your family, and getting levels appropriate for the high level raids
	that are so much fun!<br>

        leader of Pak'Cafan, Norrath</i><br>
      </p>

      <p class="body">10-27-01<br>
        First off, I wanted to thank everyone who posted their dismay or sadness 
        that I was going to be stepping down from the EQ Lead's position. That 
        has touched me, and not made this any easier. However, I know what I am 
        doing is what I wish to do... and as such will continue steadfast.</p>
      <p class="body">However, this is not a time for me.... for this day emerges 
        a new team member to the leadership core of Pak'Cafan, this day emerges 
        a friend rising above challenge, this day emerges a leader. This day, 
        the torch is passed, the mantle is set carefully on the shoulders of another, 
        the future rests in the very capable hands of the new EQ Pak leader. I 
        am very satisfied, happy, content, and secure in my choice of a leader 
        and their ability to perform and push EQ Pak to succeed and progress further 
        using our values and honor as a code. Nalance has accepted the position 
        of the EQ Leader in Pak'Cafan! Nalance has been with Pak sense she was 
        level 12 I believe and has always had Pak's best interests in mind - and 
        has always been one of those members who doesn't have to think to make 
        the right decision when honor is in question. Nala hasn't been the most 
        out spoken member in the terms of leadership, but she did successfully 
        arrange, prepare and help organize the entire RageFest camp when we stayed 
        in that god forsaken dungeon for damn near 6 days straight with the entire 
        guild supporting. That was no small feat. At any rate, this stage is no 
        longer mine to orchestrate, and as such will leave you with some remarks 
        from the new EQ Leader, Nalance.</p>
      <p class="body"><i>--Cougar Shadowstalker/Tyrack, Den Alpha and DaoC Lead 
        - Pak'Cafan</i> </p>
      <p class="body">Hello All,</p>
      <p class="body">I am honored in Cougar's faith in handing over the guild leadership to 
        me. I have been in this guild for over two years now, and you are my family. 
        Pak'Cafan is a guild of family oriented values that Cougar and the officers 
        forged. Under my leadership, these values will remain. Some of our brethren 
        have left for other realms, and we wish them well. These family values 
        of Pak should span the realms, as was Cougar's vision. <br>
        Although we have reduced in size, we will survive, but I need the help 
        and cooperation of all of you remaining in EQ for us to prosper. We need 
        to stick together, as a family should, have positive attitudes, and most 
        of all play to have fun. We also need to spread out and seek out potential 
        candidates for joining Pak. <br>
        I talked to Sheylene last night and she is willing to stay as officer. 
        I will need her expertise and guidance during this transition. I will 
        be naming more officers in the next few days, when I get their acceptance 
        of becoming officers. I will also be hashing out a new, simple application 
        for Pak membership for the time being. We need to ease up our restrictions, 
        but still be selective in finding those out their with the same value 
        systems as Pak. The cubship program, rankings and loot rules will stay 
        the same. After we start to grow again, the officers and I will look at 
        the rankings for each of you and making adjustments where applicable.<br>
        In conclusion, my goals for the future of EQ Pak'Cafan are promotion of 
        family, growth of the membership with those with like values, and a promotion 
        of having fun. I play this game for relaxation, as do many of you. I do 
        not want us to have or create stress in this game. Stress is for the workplace, 
        games are for relaxation and enjoyment! J I hope you will support Pak 
        in this task of rebuilding. I look forward to the challenge! Thank you 
        all! If you ever need to contact me, my email address is<a href="mailto:natalee_w@yahoo.com"> 
        Natalee_w@yahoo.com</a> .</p>
      <p class="body"><i>--Nalance<br>
        Proud member and new leader of Pak'Cafan</i><br>
      </p>
      <p class="body">10-23-01<br>
        I hate intro's.. I really do. You know you want to say something, but 
        you just want to get to the meat of the converstation. But you can't, 
        so you have to jibber jabber about this and that untill you feel that 
        you have gotten to the point where you can bring about the meat of your 
        post. How's the weather? Good weekend? Glad I asked, aren't you?</p>
      <p class="body">I wanted to let you all know that while nothing has been 
        talked about, and nothing has been posted - I have been working in the 
        background behind the scenes to give you what you all want - Leadership. 
        Unfortunately, my efforts have been fruitless in this endeavor, for many 
        reasons. I said back in my last large post/address when I was talking 
        about some of the major guilds ahead that I was not going to be the in 
        game leader for more than two pack's of Pak'Cafan, I meant it. However, 
        with AO coming and going and me keeping the lead in EQ, many might have 
        thought that I was going to still be here in DaoC. Perhaps I didn't make 
        my intentions clear enough... perhaps I wasn't sure myself. I am now.</p>
      <p class="body"><i>*steps off his Leader box*</i> Some of you have known 
        me for well over 2.5 years now, others a much shorter time. A few know 
        the true me, as many only see the leader that I have become, and that 
        I am. However, it is time for me to have fun again... and while I've beta 
        tested DaoC for over a year, I didn't realize how fun it truely was until 
        my friends and family surrounded me. Some who know me in the earlier years 
        (Pre-RoK) know I have a bit of Powergamer in me -- always with a thought 
        of my family in mind, but power gamer none the less. Being at the top 
        of our game in DaoC is a great feeling... being on the top of the top 
        is better. Getting published on camelotvault was awesome. But thats me, 
        and this is me being the leader <i>*gets back on*</i></p>
      <p class="body">The Future of Pak'Cafan is not at stake, that isn't even 
        an issue. The future of Pak'Cafan being an uber guild contender is. We 
        have always tetered on this delicate balance, and ended up flexing our 
        muscles enough that some of got to taste sweet victory on a couple of 
        really hard mobs. Many of us have epic weapons due to this guild and our 
        friends. Others don't. But Pak in EQ has never been there to provide items, 
        raids, or even groups to our members. We are here to provide a pool of 
        like minded individuals that have common interests and playstyles that 
        can join together and enjoy their time spent in this game we call EQ together.</p>
      <p class="body">It is now going to be back to that stage again for an undisclosed 
        period of time. I cannot, nor willnot predict when that time will come 
        again where we can set our sights high and achieve them. All I can do 
        is promote our family values and the things I have always preeched and 
        practiced. Pak will be there for any who wish to remain. Pak will not 
        go away... however I expect some to go away from Pak. Those who willnot/cannot 
        move to DaoC for whatever reason and enjoy the high level game will not 
        find it in Pak in the next few weeks/months to come. I will not hold you 
        here, but would love it if you did. </p>
      <p class="body">I could talk about that last topic for eternity.. so much 
        to say, but you get the drift. Point 2. I've asked a few people I had 
        in mind before DaoC release for leadership/officer positions and have 
        been turned down every time. So I am left with little choice in the matter... 
        If you are interested in being the in game lead for Pak'Cafan in EQ, please<a href="matilto:cougardc@home.com"> 
        email me</a> a full application as to why you should be the person. I 
        cannot tell you what to put in this email, but if you are interested tell 
        me why you should be the one, where you intend to take pak, and your willingness 
        to work with me (you won't be my puppet, but I would like to be consulted 
        on major policy changes). Please also email me if you want further clarifications 
        as to what I am going to expect, or what authority the EQ leader will 
        have. As far as officer positions, that will be up to the new EQ Leader 
        - if one steps up. One change I expect to see happen regardless of who 
        assumes control would be a lightening of our EQ recruitment procedures 
        to promote growth in EQ again.</p>
      <p class="body">One thing that needs to stop is the bickering between the 
        games. Like I said in one of my posts on the boards... EQ Pak is feeling 
        what they are and asking for help, and DaoC is getting defensive. Please 
        keep the discussions Civil and in line. Do not make any personal attacks 
        on people or on the 'other' game. We are all family here going through 
        a rough transition.</p>
      <p class="body">I am very much intune to what is going on in EQ, much thanks 
        to Sheylene and others who have kept me in the loop. I will remain in 
        tune as long as people keep me informed. Now it is time to pass the baton 
        off, and I challenge you to step up and take it from me. You all have 
        the part to become someone that can mold and guide this create creation 
        we call Pak'Cafan. Who will accept the challenge?</p>

        was promoted, and he just now decided to accept it. Congrats Mix !</p>
      <p class="body">Well.. Mix then proceded to take us on a Mix style Raid 
        night. Started it off nice and easy with Lord Dojo (booties - Tet, Red

        website is now up and running! And as you can see our eq website has moved 
        to a semi new location. If you see any bugs or links that I happened to 
        miss in the site migration, please email me with that. Otherwise, go check

        For Immediate Release:</p>
      <p class="body">Pak'Cafan Today has announced it's intentions in the world 
        of <a href="http://www.darkageofcamelot.com/">Dark Age of Camelot</a>. 
        As many of you know, <a href="http://www.mythicgames.com/">Mythic Entertainment</a> 
        has created the newest MMORPG to hit the gaming shelves (Oct. 9th, 2001) 
        and in that world, we have decided to invade as a guild. In doing so, 
        there have been alot of hard choices to be made - with three Realms to 
        choose from and a multitude of servers to choose from. And now, 10 days 
        from the shipping date, it has been decided as to our plans there.</p>
      <p class="body" align="center"><font size="+1">Pak'Cafan will be defenders 
        of the Hibernian Realm on the server dedicated to Galahad.</font></p>
      <p class="body">For those of you that wish to play a Midguard character, 
        I recommend that you to play on the Galahad server so that you will find 
        fellow Pak'Cafan members there as well. However, this is merely a suggestion, 
        and *<i><b>not</b></i>* officially supported as a two realm guild. Mixelplux 
        will have our DaoC website up and running by the end of the week I am 
        hoping, so please help him by getting him screenshots and information 
        he needs. The first calendar month of EQ in Camelot we will have a loose 
        recruitment policy. In November we will reinstate a recruitment policy 
        more in line with the standards that we have created here in EverQuest.</p>
      <p class="body">Pak'Cafan will continue to flourish in Norrath as well, 
        even while some of our family are away playing as Celts and Firbolgs and 
        what have you. At this time, none of the current officers have expressed 
        the desire to take the in game title away from me (see post below about 
        me not wanting the in game title in two games) so for now, I will have 
        to retain that. In Novemeber, if the officers that have kept up their 
        play time decide that they need to recruit a new core of officers that 
        will be their perogative, hopefully that will give some of you a chance 
        at being a part of the leadership of this guild that I know some of you 
        have expressed interest in.</p>
      <p class="body">As such, there is a new Inner Circle of officers that will 
        make the decisions for the Guild encompassing ALL games we may or may 
        not play. Typically these people have been with us the longest, shown 
        the most interest in everything done, and generally have their finger 
        on the pulse of Pak'Cafan. These people include:</p>
      <p class="body">Cougar/Tyrack, Ainin, Derringer, Khirgoth, Feraldenar and 
        Redleaf/Waran</p>
      <p class="body">Due to the complex nature of the ranking system in Camelot, 
        details as to that will follow some days in the future - probably late 
        October as I flesh them out. If you have any questions or coments, please 
        post them in the DaoC forum under this thread. I thank you all for being 
        a part of this family, and I hope we can all continue to grow and prosper 
        (and have fun!) in any and all games we wish to expand to.</p>

        So I get this phone call at 10:00am PST or so... and its from Syngr. I'm 
        like, WTF we aren't doing a Rage camp, whats up?</p>

      <p class="body" align="left">Welp, it seems that Ms. Whitey was up and causing 
        a ruckus. So we teamed up with Enrapture (cause you know us PSTer's most 
        of us were still sleeping off our HoT raid from the night prior). In the 
        end it turned out to be about 23/23 Pak/Enrapture. Took two try's to get 
        everything down pat, but for the first time working in tandem with another 
        guild, I'd say that was perfect.</p>

      <p class="body" align="left">Well, the BARD who called me (I had been up 
        for 15min so far.. lucky SoB he is, lemme tell you) ended up getting his 
        scale. Only the fake trak to go for him to hand down all his dragon instruments. 
        Oh yea, there is that little something about some sword with a bunch of 
        notes, but thats the least of the important stuff, right? We did end up 
        getting Derringer the frost book for his FA (Ainin, where were you man?!) 
        and picked up a few spells (Mask of the Hunter and Aegis of Ro -- please 
        see Khirgoth for them when you hit 60). And the booby prize was a once 
        coveted item - the Heiro Crook (druid only). If you want this item, please 
        see Tyrack, as I will want to unload it - mains only.</p>
      <p class="body" align="left">Lots of HoT raids recently, lots of new armor. 
        And as such, I got myself a new BP - much nicer than the old one. And 
        cause I'm the editor and stuff, I get to show off...</p>
