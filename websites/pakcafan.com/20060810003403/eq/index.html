<p class="body">Yeah yeah, update faster you say... I do have a job ya know? :P<br><br>

We've had somewhat of a slow start to our month, finishing up our latest round of recruitment, backflagging, farming... All that good stuff. While fun, it's left us craving for more.<br><br>
We went into Demi on Monday night really hoping to get our first Hatchet kill under our belts.  We were set, we were focused, nothing was going to stop us.  Well, maybe a teeny tiny little incident with a nearly harmless little red skeleton might stop us...<br><br>
After uhm, a very long time rezzing, dying, logging on alts, leveling said alts, moving skeletons, and other dead things we were finally recovered.  We figured the focus was gone, that too many people had gone to sleep or that too many people had snuck out for the night.  We almost called it a night.  The officers were burnt and frustrated and just wanted to go to bed pretending the night hadn't happened.  But we decided that since we had spent so much time getting to this point, we had to at least throw ourselves at Hatchet for a quick TL to bind.<br><br>
Well, once again, things didn't go as planned.  After about 5 minutes we realized that the focus was still there, that we really had a chance at winning still.  A short time later (ok, a long time later) we came up with this!</p>
<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Hatchetcorpse.jpg" width="550" height="322" alt="" border="0"></p>
<p class="body">And of course he coughed us up some loot!</p>
<p class="body" align="left"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Hatchetear.jpg" width="447" height="281" alt="" border="0"><br>
<i>Congrats Valerys!</i></p>
<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Fallenboots.jpg" width="454" height="266" alt="" border="0"><br>
<i>Congrats Florance!</i></p>
<p class="body" align="right"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Eulogy.jpg" width="445" height="266" alt="" border="0"><br>
<i>Congrats Kanuuan!</i></p>
<p class="body">And then Tuesday night came, and well... We won't talk about Tuesday night other than that we had an interesting discussion about what kind of torture devices would work best on the game developers.<br><br>
And then Wednesday night came.  Once again we were psyched, we knew we were close to another fresh kill.  We took a while to get ready, making sure we didn't have any flaws in group setup, or anything else we could later kick ourselves over.  And then finally we engaged...<br><br>
Then within 30 seconds we had a death...<br>
And then a short time later we had another...<br>
Uh oh, this might not go so well...<br>
But then we pulled it together. For the next 45 minutes or so, we ripped the event to shreds.  Everybody was doing exactly what they needed to be doing, hardly anybody died, and we came up with another corpse that wasn't one of ours!</p>
<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Daosheendying.jpg" width="500" height="294" alt="" border="0"></p>
<p class="body">And of course we got some more nice loot...</p>
<p class="body" align="left"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Forcependant.jpg" width="457" height="265" alt="" border="0"><br>
<i>Congrats Dumathin!</i></p>
<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Malformed.jpg" width="434" height="202" alt="" border="0"><br>
<i>Congrats Soulkeepper!</i></p>
<p class="body" align="right"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Prismaticaug.jpg" width="447" height="202" alt="" border="0"><br>
<i>Congrats Welaker!</i></p>
<p class="body">It was pretty amazing really.  An event we have tried so few times to go down the way it did was a sight to be seen.  Everybody did an amazing job, from the clickers, to the healers, to the people standing around with their thumbs in disgusting places wondering why an event was designed in such a way.<br><br>
Way to step it up Pak'cafan with two fresh kills in three days!</p>

	<p class="title">Pak not Dead!</p>
	<!-- Title End -->

	<!-- Body Start -->

<p class="body">I heard it said just the other day.  Pak is dead, Pak isn't going anywhere, blah blah blah.  Sure we've taken a bit of a hit on numbers, we always do when summer sets in.  But we've recovered, done some flagging, done some gearing, and we're right back where we were before... That and we've added a bunch of great people to our family!<br><br>
We are still recruiting on a limited basis.  Enchanters, Beastlords, Berzerkers, and Rogues mostly, but if you're really interested in Pak, have good playtime and a great attitude look up an officer in game and we'll chat.<br><br>
We've been spending a lot of time in Demi lately and it's starting to pay off.  The three conspiring sisters were the next to hand over their loot to the mighty Pak.  I took pictures, I swear I really did.  Of all 3 sister, of all of the loot, them stabbing each other in the back, everything. I was a picture taking fool... But then the squirrels came and took them all away.  They only left me with shots of empty bedrooms.  I bet you can't want to see them so let me get right to it...</p>
<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Sisterswin.jpg" width="550" height="504" alt="" border="0"><br>
<i>Exciting, isn't it?</i></p>
<p class="body">I really truely thought I had taken more screenshots, my apologies for the lack of excitement here.  I had a near ninja looting experience with the chest, so uhm, I guess I don't have pictures of the loot either.  Here's what we got tho, some very nice items for sure.</p>
<p class="body" align="center">- <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=83571">Azure Gloves of the Diplomat</a> - Congrats Krezlin!<br>
- <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=83602">Sister's Tear-Stained Shawl</a> - Congrats Pretikiti!<br>
- <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=83568">Gauntlets of the Fallen Saint</a> - Congrats Keera!</p>
<p class="body">It really does feel good to get another kill in the Demiplane, and I expect Hatchet's days to be numbered as well...</p>
<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Sisterlockout.jpg" width="378" height="108" alt="" border="0"></p>
<p class="body">We've also been playing around in PoR still, and except to be spending even more time there in the coming weeks.  I did manage to get a screenshot of our latest PoR kill, Porthio the Second Born, and what a wonderous footshot it is...</p>
<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Porthio.jpg" width="550" height="309" alt="" border="0"></p>
<p class="body">Not my best update, I'll give you that.  But don't worry, Hatchet will die soon and I'll have screenshots so amazing, you'll forget all about this!<br><br>
On one final note... Shadyzar, I have some bad news for you.</p>

<p class="body">Amazing, isn't it?  Another update and it hasn't even been a month!  Well, we finally decided to see what the new exansion was all about, and I just had to share.<br><br>
None of these were really difficult, but they were a nice change of pace.  Breaking up our normal DoN night, adding some new sights and sounds to it all.  Here's a glimpse of what we did...</p>

<p class="body"><b><i>Pak'Cafan is still recruiting</i></b> enchanters, clerics, rogues, and necromancers! Look up an officer in game for more details.  We've added several new applicants this past week.  Welcome to all of you, I hope you find your permanent home here with us, we are certainly excited to have you!<br><br>
We'll be seriously looking at more DoB and PoR targets in the very near future, you can bet on seeing more corpse shots up here again soon!</p>

	<p class="title">So You Want An update?</p>
	<!-- Title End -->

	<!-- Body Start -->			
<p class="body">So I get a PM on the forums yesterday...  You don't update enough!  It's not the first of its kind though, nor is it likely to be the last...<br><br>
I suppose they had a point though, I could probably update more.  But then there is that lack of something fun and exciting to put up on our front page.  Pull something out of your ass they say, come up with something, anything... Just get something differant up there.<br><br>
Well, ask and you shall recieve...<br><br>
While making a dragon run on DoN night somebody found themselves lacking in the fun department, so they did what any intelligent raider would do, summon a (banned on raids) Jester of Bristlebane!  While most were annoyed, I looked over and saw our very own Shadyzar's eyes light up.<br><br>
It was love at first sight, awwww.<br><br> 
Or maybe this is just payback... Either way, Shadyzar just couldn't resist.</p>
<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Kinahorse.jpg" width="450" height="374" alt="" border="0"><br>
<i>And I think Kinador has another new alt!</i></p>
<p class="body">I honestly couldn't have recieved this screenshot in my inbox at a better time.  Ogtubuk, thank you.  And to Blackoe as well.  And to Shadyzar, hahahahaha!<br><br>
On a more serious note, we have made our first few runs in the Demi-Plane of Blood.  Even taking out Zi-Thuuli on our second raid in the zone.  I do need to apologize for the lack of an update when this happened, but was in the middle of prepping for a move out of state.  Things were pretty chaotic last month, but are settled down now.  Enough about that tho, lets move onto something more important, like corpses!</p>
<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Zithuuli.jpg" width="550" height="338" alt="" border="0"></p>
<p class="body">We got some nice loot in our 2 kills, and while I don't have screenshots of any of it, I can give you some links to drool over.<br>
- <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=83593">Pulsing Runed Pebble</a> - Congrats Bono!<br>
- <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=83567">Azure Sleeves of the Diplomat</a> - Congrats Masq!<br>
- <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=83566">Forgotten Artist's Mesh Sleeves</a> - Congrats Xxes!<br>
- <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=83585">Amice of the Tranquil</a> - Congrats Angor!<br>
- <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=83601">Leering Coldstone Mask</a> - Congrats Igok!</p>
<p class="body">That's really about all we've seen of the Demi-Plane so far, we've pushed as far as Hatchet, just to see what he was all about, and well, he let us know what he was all about all right, and this is it...</p>
<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Deadraid.jpg" width="500" height="2922" alt="" border="0"></p>
<p class="body">All I've got to say is uhm, ow!  I saw Sky say AGGRO, and all of a sudden I got hit with a massive lag spike.  Shortly after that I see all that text fly across my screen, one mass TL to bind, minus the gear, fun stuff!<br><br>
We really are looking forward to learning the encounters in the Demi-Plane.  From the little bit we have seen so far it looks like it is going to be a blast and a real challenge to learn.<br><br>
We are looking to fill a few gaps in our roster as well.  If you play a lot, have a good attitude, and a desire to raid high end content, we may be the guild for you.  We are currently actively recruiting Enchanters, Bards, Clerics, Druids, Rogues, and Necromancers.  But will always consider exceptional apps in almost any area.  If you are interested in finding out more, contact an officer in game.<br><br>
That's it for now, hope to have more corpses to update with soon!</p>
