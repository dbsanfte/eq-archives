<p class="body">This just in:<br><br>

"I would like to announce that I am stepping down as guildleader of Everquest Pak'Cafan, effective immediately. Discussion and planning for this eventuality has been taking place for several weeks now, and I apologize that working everything out took this long, but I believe the success of the transition will benefit from the care we have taken with making it a reality.<br><br> 

Please welcome and congratulate Andaria on her acceptance of my offer to lead this fine shard of Pak'Cafan. I am positive that she will do a tremendous job, as she has done for a long time in her previous position, with her new duties as guildleader." - Derringer<br><br>

Isn't that some shit, eh? It's been a good run with ya, dirf man. But you'll always be a gnome to me!</p>

<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/derringer_gnome.jpg" width="235" height="157" alt="" border="0"></p>

<p class="body">Meanwhile, Andi, who has really been the woman responsible for the progress of the guild (don't lie, we all know it) is taking her rightful place as Queen Bee and we will all buzz happily around her. Especially considering she dresses like this: </p>

<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/andaria.jpg" width="212" height="462" alt="" border="0"><br><i>Mmmm, sinful!</i></p>

<p class="body">And of course, her natural response would probably be something like:</p>

<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/meanandi.jpg" width="327" height="38" alt="" border="0"><br><i>Mean ole' Andi :(</i></p>


<p class="body">But seriously, congratulations are certainly in order! So long dirf man, get laid sometime this year, eh? And to the rest of you, be nice to Andi, damnit! You don't have to be nice to Gromlok, though. I mean, who really likes him anyway? But Andaria, yeah, you gotta be nice to her! :)

<p class="body">That's right, we're looking for the few, the brave, the wacky and wild! Basically, here's a great shot at getting in one of the most stable and well respected guilds on the server. And I promise, I won't make you do what I typically make new recruits do. Health code violations these days are getting tighter and tighter :(.<br><br>

On that note, check the charter for the newest application standards and make sure and give you local Pak recruiter a tell :).

<br><br>Oh, you're probably wondering what we're up to, well.. clearing time weekly, as usual, working on flagging for Ikkinz 4 (This event, single handed, will make WoW a success, but as usual, Pak is overcoming the flaming hoops set before us). Between DX9 crap, event bugs, flag/key bugs, we're still rolling along nicely. No real point in showing a screenshot at this point because, well.. it all looks the god damned same. Just imagine one of the mobs you see in the first zones but with a longer name. And by name I mean, an un-intelligible string of characters. Ta ta for now!<br><br>

I actually couldn't read the thing (his book sized bitch fest), I was laughing so hard picturing a nice fat vein about to pop on his forehead when he thought I quit, and the only way I said I quit was on the front page! HAHAHAHA!!!! Omg, people get so worked up :P. I had no idea I'd get this much reaction <3 <3 <3!<br><br>

But anyway, you fuckers aren't rid of me yet! I'm probably going to be out of game for a few more weeks getting the new house set up and internet friendly and all that, but I'll be back. :).<br><br>

<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/god_nothing.jpg" width="600" height="480" alt="" border="0"><br><i>You're impressed, admit it.</i></p>

<p class="body">This is what happens when no one feeds the Gnome information. I don't get a single SS, tale of heroic deeds, nothing. The only way I know we did anything is by a thread tracking what loot was taken, and that's not even real time. So I'm clueless. Here's a big hint to the esteemed bastards who like to bug me to update - SEND ME SOMETHING TO UPDATE WITH. I don't care if it's a story, a funny anecdote (Which I probably wouldn't find funny, in hind sight, so strike that idea) or hell, maybe even screenshots of dead mobs with loot? Ya think!? But noo, let's just sit on our high horse and call the gnome lazy. Why not, right? Well, here's your damned update, you lame bitches.<br><br>

<u>To do:</u><br><br>
Ford dealership (Need a metal bracket to fix my parking break, and some screws for my door panel)<br>
Costco (Pick up apple sauce, couple bottles of wine, and some flowers for grandma)<br>
Grocery store (see list below)<br>
Compare Homeowners Insurance (closing on new house at end of the week)<br>
Pick up paycheck<br>
Deposit said paycheck.<br>
Eat lunch at some point, maybe even play a game of chess.<br>
Masturbate<br>
Drink beer<br>
Masturbate<br><br>

<u>Grocery List:</u><br><br>
Lotion (duh)<br>
bread, sourdough<br>
Stone IPA - Case<br>
tomato sauce<br>
fresh garlic<br>
cheese - Parm and mozz
<br><br>

Now some might wonder why I'm not there personally to tell these stories and take these screenshots. Well, I'm closing on a new house this week, I'm working, (soon to be, anyway) two jobs, trying to get the current house up to snuff to sale shortly after moving into the new one (what a pain in the ass that is), while trying to find time to do the things that make me, well.. me. Like for instance; Drinking beer, surfing porn, masturbating, having sex, and occasionally, sleeping. Imagine my girlfriends shock and dismay if I weren't doing one of the above mentioned activities. Imagine mine! So fat loot is collected, and we raid happily. I'm not really sure how often we raid but we're cleaning up time and Ikkinz from what I can gather. There you have it.<br><br>

But hey, we got a plate BP from RZ 30 min before that :). Great job Pak, hopefully we've got this time clearing business down, or will soon, and it'll be old hat for us as we explore the new expansion :).<br><br>

Getting back to the last mob left alive before the MONTH break from raiding in time, we went back and knocked the fool on the head in short order.</p>

We would probably had Time down to 2 days. I would have whored a decent amount of loot and wouldn't have fallen so far behind those lame ass bards in hp. Oh well.. we're back, we're still pissed and we won't forget, but we're back.<br><br>

Awakened hasn't had this problem at all. We could have, and I say *could* have, had time down to 3 days to clear start to finish since we made it up to Inno and had a solid solid strat on how to deal with him next time we saw him. We've whined a bit (see below) but we're still here. We did a complete round of time backflagging to boot, and we're still here. And yet, Time is still broken for us. We've tried every odd suggestion everyone has given us, including dancing around for exactly 15 min before spinning in circles for 3 minutes and then zoning in. No, still didn't work, amazingly enough.<br><br>FIX THIS PLEASE!<br><br>

Please go ahead and attempt your instance today and then get back to me with what happened. If you wish to wait the 5 days from yesterday when you attempted, it is up to your guild.

I wish you well and safe hunting." <br><br>See this? Communication. This was the correct answer. I don't know what the issue is with in game support but at the VERY least someone was kind enough to let us know what was going on, even if it was 6 days after the initial problem.

First we get hamstrung by the holiday haze and our progression is slowed down because everyone is too busy out getting drunk and hating their family, we come back and kick major ass only to be cockblocked by a stupid WELL KNOWN AND DOCUMENTED BUG that will keep us out of time for 7 god damned days. UNACCEPTABLE! Like I told the GM when he said there was 'Nothing they could do.' And I quote - 'If the move from this game for myself and many others was ever in doubt, your policies just made it a certainty.' Seriously, they are SOOO lucky they are really the only game in town as far as high end game play goes. I can't tell you how frustrated we are about this lame ass bug of instance corruption/swapping.<br><br>

And in case you're slow on the uptake, we've somehow acquired one of the other guild's instances, which means PoTime is clear. Bloody hell.  So anyway, we figured it was as good a time as any to do a round of time backflagging. Starting with:</p>

Yes, I'm calling most of you 'SLACKERS!', but that's okay, we'll pick it up :).<br><br>

<p class="body">Okay so we're feeling good, beating ass and just feeling peachy about ourselves. We have tons of time left so we decide to give RZ a go, just to see how bad we're going to get our asses kicked. Go in not really knowing what the hell the deal is, only know that at some point, some adds, somewhere, will spawn. First try was 40ish percent before we pulled back and regrouped. Second run yielded a very dead RZ!</p>

	<p class="body" align="center"><a href="Images/Screenshots/timerz.jpg"><img src="Images/Screenshots/timerz_thumb.jpg" width="600" height="480" alt="" border="0"></a><br><i>This was by far the biggest surprise of the night. I don't think ANY of us had any idea we had a chance against this guy, let alone were going to smoke him, and I mean SMOKE him, on our second run of him. Wooooohoooooooo! </i></p>

<p class="body">It was getting late so we took a token shot at Inno just to see what the deal was and well, it sucked. That dude is just brutal. Me no like. And thus ended the Pak night of own. <br><br>

I just basically run around bitching and moaning about how utterly freakin crazy my family is, and how I'm glad I'm no longer young enough for them to force me to their inane gatherings that invariably ended up being broken up by the police due to my mother trying to murder someone with the electric turkey carver. <br><br>

<p class="body">After we drug TT down we went for her 'physical' friend, Saryrn.</p>

	<p class="body">Then we turned our attention to the Zek brothers.</p>

<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/timetz.jpg" width="600" height="330" alt="" border="0"><br><i>Okay, needing to kill this freak three god damned times in one expansion is a little stupid, k?</i></p>

<p class="body">We also made a quick run at VZ and after a couple false starts, got his lame ass to 16% and then were ported out :( - We had no idea we'd get this far and we knew we were short on time, but we wanted to see how we'd do. Phase 5 next week, hopefully!<br><br>

And let me touch upon a trend that has been bothering me lately. When LDoN came out, I was looking forward to it. I love crawling a dungeon, exploring and trying new stuff with a single group, it's great, what's not to like? However, being in Time and having these stupid fekking time limits it made me realize why I hate LDoN with a burning passion. Time limits. I utterly despise time limits of any kind.<br><br>
LDoN - We don't crawl the dungeon, we race through it as fast as we can. The faster we complete it, the more lucrative it is for the main reason to do LDoN - Those lame ass adventure points. That and if we dally and something goes wrong, we could lose and waste all that time. It's a race. It's NOT FUN! <br><br>

Time is the same way. I'll overlook the time limits for phases 1-3. I don't mind them that much but once reaching phase 4, it's annoying as hell. The game has become a perpetual 'Hurry hurry, not a moment to lose!' and it's annoying. I certainly hope the new expansion rethinks this 'time' component of these encounters and let us work these encounters as fast or as slow as we'd like.</P>


<p class="body">Fine, I'll shut up!<br><br>

Our first day where we have all our time in Phase 4 and what happens? Not one, but TWO server crashes. The first one clipped over an hour off our time limit, and the second ended our night.

	A couple of things to note. Charter has been cleaned up a bit and the 'Rankings' page has been added to the bottom 	of the charter (makes more sense, IMO), and the Loot Rules page is now a separate page. The 'Members' section is still linking to the old style for now but will be converted probably this week. I'm still working on the archives page, get over it. Enjoy :)<br><br>

<p class="body">I don't really know what to say about this event. It's fast, it's furious, you can have the most carefully laid out plans in the world, and they can all go ape shit in 5 seconds flat. It's a living event if ever there was one. Things change from one second to another, orders come out fast and need to be executed even faster. I used to hate this event, with a passion, but I'm not sure now. I certainly don't think it's fun but it sure is something.<br><br>

In the mean time, we've been solidifying our strat on Xegony, making her dead again in a much nicer fashion, and of course, continuing to farm our asses off. For instance, completely destroying PoFire -</p>

So if my updates are a little late, like.. 12 god damned hours late, you're going to be patient and LIKE IT.<br>
<br>
Right, so, anyway...<br>
<br>
I still need to get those pics of Chicago up too. /sigh But hey, the butterfly is dead, yay! GOOO PAK! </p>
