	<p class="body">It's been 18 days since we've raided in time. Why haven't we been raiding since? We zone into an empty zone. Enlightened Dark had this problem Saturday, it was fixed Sunday for them. Awakened hasn't had this problem at all. We could have, and I say *could* have, had time down to 3 days to clear start to finish since we made it up to Inno and had a solid solid strat on how to deal with him next time we saw him. We've whined a bit (see below) but we're still here. We did a complete round of time backflagging to boot, and we're still here. And yet, Time is still broken for us. We've tried every odd suggestion everyone has given us, including dancing around for exactly 15 min before spinning in circles for 3 minutes and then zoning in. No, still didn't work, amazingly enough.<br><br>FIX THIS PLEASE!<br><br>

I see in my emails that new data was pushed to Plane of Time A and B this morning at 3:00am. This new information reset the zones from what I understand and may fix your guilds instance issue. Please go ahead and attempt your instance today and then get back to me with what happened. If you wish to wait the 5 days from yesterday when you attempted, it is up to your guild. But I would ask that you please know that the developers are trying to fix this instancing problem and no one is trying to prevent your guild from continuing their game enjoyment. I wish you well and safe hunting." <br><br>See this? Communication. This was the correct answer. I don't know what the issue is with in game support but at the VERY least someone was kind enough to let us know what was going on, even if it was 6 days after the initial problem. In game support is still a ridiculous joke but at least we have some light of hope.<br><br>

And as our 'warning' to not mass petition again? I'll reply with a warning of my own. Piss off 50+ people and expect for them to scream. After all, at least we get SOME response then.<br><br>

<p class="body">Well, we made it to phase 6 this week. Yeah, that's right, but not because we beat the crap out of Inno, the last mob before Quarm we haven't beaten. No, it's because we walked there. That's right, we walked there.
</p>

	<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/time-empty.jpg" width="600" height="480" alt="" border="0"><br><i>Anybody home?? :( :( :(</i></p>

<p class="body">Screw you and your ineffectual GM's in the eye, Sony. First we get hamstrung by the holiday haze and our progression is slowed down because everyone is too busy out getting drunk and hating their family, we come back and kick major ass only to be cockblocked by a stupid WELL KNOWN AND DOCUMENTED BUG that will keep us out of time for 7 god damned days. UNACCEPTABLE! Like I told the GM when he said there was 'Nothing they could do.' And I quote - 'If the move from this game for myself and many others was ever in doubt, your policies just made it a certainty.' Seriously, they are SOOO lucky they are really the only game in town as far as high end game play goes. I can't tell you how frustrated we are about this lame ass bug of instance corruption/swapping.<br><br>

And in case you're slow on the uptake, we've somehow acquired one of the other guild's instances, which means PoTime is clear. Bloody hell.  So anyway, we figured it was as good a time as any to do a round of time backflagging. Starting with:</p>

	<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/xexbf.jpg" width="600" height="490" alt="" border="0"><br><i>Pink Lady is the first to fall.</i></p>

<p class="body">So we'll use these 7 days to clear our Instance ID to bring wreck and ruin to the Elemental Gods, and farm some of the elemental named that seem to be all too common, even with all the new guilds in elementals. Yes, I'm calling most of you 'SLACKERS!', but that's okay, we'll pick it up :).<br><br>

<p class="body">It was getting late so we took a token shot at Inno just to see what the deal was and well, it sucked. That dude is just brutal. Me no like. And thus ended the Pak night of own. <br><br>

<p class="body">We also made a quick run at VZ and after a couple false starts, got his lame ass to 16% and then were ported out :( - We had no idea we'd get this far and we knew we were short on time, but we wanted to see how we'd do. Phase 5 next week, hopefully!<br><br>

And let me touch upon a trend that has been bothering me lately. When LDoN came out, I was looking forward to it. I love crawling a dungeon, exploring and trying new stuff with a single group, it's great, what's not to like? However, being in Time and having these stupid fekking time limits it made me realize why I hate LDoN with a burning passion. Time limits. I utterly despise time limits of any kind.<br><br>
LDoN - We don't crawl the dungeon, we race through it as fast as we can. The faster we complete it, the more lucrative it is for the main reason to do LDoN - Those lame ass adventure points. That and if we dally and something goes wrong, we could lose and waste all that time. It's a race. It's NOT FUN! <br><br>

Time is the same way. I'll overlook the time limits for phases 1-3. I don't mind them that much but once reaching phase 4, it's annoying as hell. The game has become a perpetual 'Hurry hurry, not a moment to lose!' and it's annoying. I certainly hope the new expansion rethinks this 'time' component of these encounters and let us work these encounters as fast or as slow as we'd like.</P>


<p class="body">Fine, I'll shut up!<br><br>

	A couple of things to note.

<p class="body">And now a big shout out to all you annoying bastards endlessly whining for an update. Listen here, jack offs, I've got a huge art show going up in 2 weeks, I'm trying to buy a house, declare bankruptcy, avoid getting married, and figure out some way to get another sports bike through all of this mess, AND keep at least a 70% raid attendance. So if my updates are a little late, like.. 12 god damned hours late, you're going to be patient and LIKE IT.<br>
<br>
Right, so, anyway...<br>
<br>
I still need to get those pics of Chicago up too. /sigh But hey, the butterfly is dead, yay! GOOO PAK! </p>
