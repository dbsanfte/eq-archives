<p class="body">We've been pushing forward and making some decent progress in both OoW and GoD. We've added a few new mobs to farm status and been pushing hard to beat some MPG trials...<br><br>

After sacrificing a few wizards in the Walls of Slaughter, this is what we came up with...</p>

<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Hulcror.jpg" width="550" height="425" alt="" border="0"><br>
<i>Poor Yalaman, hope he gets the feeling back in his legs soon</i></p>
<p class="body">We killed this beast a few times, bringing in a few more 70 runes into the guild and the following items, which tured out to be pretty nice:<br><br>
- <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70693">Dragorn Runemark</a> - Congrats Jorack!<br>
- <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70695">Muramite Signet Orb</a> - Congrats Alingas!<br>
- <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70696">Hulcror's Whisker</a> - Congrats Desflurane!<br>
- <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70693">Ancient Dragon Signet</a> - Congrats Ferrell!</p>

<p class="body">We've also been getting our feet wet in Riftseekers, where we've gotten even more 70 runes and some new toys for a few.</p>

<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Feratha.jpg" width="600" height="330" alt="" border="0"></p>

<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Chailak.jpg" width="600" height="330" alt="" border="0"></p>

<p class="body">After killing these two monstrosites, we decided to see what else the zone had in store for us.  We were cruising right along when we ran into this guy...</p>
<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/Riftking.jpg" width="275" height="285" alt="" border="0"><br>
<i>Mr. Gelaqua says "Hi, please stay a while"</i></p>
<p class="body" align="center">And we did<br><br>
And then we stayed some more<br><br>
And then some more<br><br>
...</p>
<p class="body">There we stood for the next 15 minutes wondering what the hell was going on.  Some laughed, some cried, and some nearly puked on their keyboards as they were stuck spinning in place.  Needless to say, we let him live this time. I don't think it will go so well for the King the next time that we meet tho.</p>

<p class="body">Even with all the fun we've been having in OoW, we still haven't forgotten about GoD. We've been gearing up some new recruits in Qvic and the like, and continuing our push in Inktu'ta.  Our hard work has finally been paying off too!  We've made a corpse out of Kelekdrix, Herald of Trushar (a couple of times now) and are very close to beating the next part of the zone.<br><br>
While Kelekdrix didn't leave us a corpse to make a nice screenshot out of, we did get pictures of the important parts...</p>

<i>Congrats, Dagar! May you bring much pain</i></p>

<p class="body">We've also gotten a <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68940">100hp augment</a> and a
<a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68942">100mana augment</a> that I cannot for the life of me remember who won, grats to the lucky Paksters tho! :)</p> 
<p class="body">Pak is still recruiting, btw!  If you think that Pak is the home for you, send a tell to Jorack or Heap in game for more details.<br><br>
And in closing...</p>

<p class="body">Omens of War has been a blast so far, and Pak has been quite busy with it and with GoD.  We've been taking some time to get leveled up to 70, farm runes, work on new epics, and backflag a round of recruits all while continuing our push in GoD and looking at some new content in OoW.<br><br>
Some new corpses that Pak found...</p>

<p class="body">None of these proved to be very difficult, but we had a lot of fun and got a bunch of runes.<br><br>
We've also gotten a lot of 1.5's, some being the first on the server, and have had a lot of fun working together to get them. Here are some Pak firsts, and more to come when I get some decent screenshots...</p>

-To be level 70<br>
-To have at least 200 AA's<br>
-To have a Kod'Taz flag<br><br>
Send a tell in game to Jorack or to Heap if you have any questions about recruitment.</p>

<p class="body">I had kept anyone from making an update on this to avoid a mass exodus, but seeing as most are at most indifferent to myself becoming to new GL of Pak'Cafan, and there is no worries of the guild collapsing ;), I thought it be a good time to make an update.<br><br>

Now, I would normally count on my friend Rasil to do something like this with his usual flair for the dramatic, but he is in San Diego, lounging at the beach no doubt, so it fell upon myself to do this update.<br><br>

A few things I would like to mention, which might not have been quite clear with Rasil's last update, is that we are recruiting! So, if you are looking for a guild doing current end-game content, have a solid playtime from est-pst, tell Jorack or Heap in game.</p>

Well, if you are then... WE WANT YOU! To fix our busted up asses. Ya see, while we finish up TimeFarm(tm) we're pushing deeper and deeper into the (cough) nether regions of Gates of Discord. And, well.. there is a lot of crap for us to trip over and fall on so, um.. we could use some band-aides. Give an officer a tell today!<br><br>

<p class="body">After a ton of hard work by everyone involved, we finally got Alchork a date. He's a little scrawny but very 'Cool' in that Robert Smith sorta way. If he laid off the smack and started eating more buffet, I could see him actually looking a lot like Chork!<br><br>

But anyway, after a strong round of recruiting some awesome people, Pak is moving right along in GoD, as painful as it can be sometimes. One can only hope that the new expansion is a complete change from the heaping pile this one has been. And maybe I'll have more then 15 minutes a week to my own so I can actually log on. As of now, 15 minutes of porn ain't bad but the lack of video games is killing me!<br><br>

<p class="body">Okay so I've been away for a few months. I'm still called the slacker, though, because I don't update with screenshots I haven't taken and don't have, and haven't reported on the events I haven't been at. And no one else really seems to be bothered to supply me with said items!<br><br>

Until now. Gromlok sent me a screenshot!! Yes, it isn't really that great. It shows Cerias dead, which is always cool (Die to enrage or something again? :P) but it also shows Roshatiz dead. Which makes me sad. Why? I can't tell you.</p>

<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/koa_god.jpg" width="600" height="436" alt="" border="0"></p>

<p class="body">So anyway, this hose head (not Roshatiz or Cerias) has died a few times to Pak. The first was bugged and only gave out 6 slivers the first time, second time.. well, he strapped a crap load of explosives to his chest and took everyone out with him. The third time, this time, he went down with minor troubles and even put out all the shite he was supposed to!<br><br>

One out of three times isn't bad, I guess… I mean, from a third world country quality control point of view.<br><br>

So anyway, I just posted a guide in our members section for taking the perfect front page worthy screenshot. So maybe now we can get some shots of our Uqua efforts, and other various exploites, posted to the front page so we actually seem like we're as busy as we really are! <br><br>

Until then…<br><br>
