<p class="body">Okay so I've been away for a few months. I'm still called the slacker, though, because I don't update with screenshots I haven't taken and don't have, and haven't reported on the events I haven't been at. And no one else really seems to be bothered to supply me with said items!<br><br>

Until now. Gromlok sent me a screenshot!! Yes, it isn't really that great. It shows Cerias dead, which is always cool (Die to enrage or something again? :P) but it also shows Roshatiz dead. Which makes me sad. Why? I can't tell you.</p>

<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/koa_god.jpg" width="600" height="436" alt="" border="0"></p>

<p class="body">So anyway, this hose head (not Roshatiz or Cerias) has died a few times to Pak. The first was bugged and only gave out 6 slivers the first time, second time.. well, he strapped a crap load of explosives to his chest and took everyone out with him. The third time, this time, he went down with minor troubles and even put out all the shite he was supposed to!<br><br>

One out of three times isn't bad, I guess… I mean, from a third world country quality control point of view.<br><br>

So anyway, I just posted a guide in our members section for taking the perfect front page worthy screenshot. So maybe now we can get some shots of our Uqua efforts, and other various exploites, posted to the front page so we actually seem like we're as busy as we really are! <br><br>

Until then…<br><br>

<p class="body">This just in:<br><br>

"I would like to announce that I am stepping down as guildleader of Everquest Pak'Cafan, effective immediately. Discussion and planning for this eventuality has been taking place for several weeks now, and I apologize that working everything out took this long, but I believe the success of the transition will benefit from the care we have taken with making it a reality.<br><br> 

Please welcome and congratulate Andaria on her acceptance of my offer to lead this fine shard of Pak'Cafan. I am positive that she will do a tremendous job, as she has done for a long time in her previous position, with her new duties as guildleader." - Derringer<br><br>

Isn't that some shit, eh? It's been a good run with ya, dirf man. But you'll always be a gnome to me!</p>

<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/derringer_gnome.jpg" width="235" height="157" alt="" border="0"></p>

<p class="body">Meanwhile, Andi, who has really been the woman responsible for the progress of the guild (don't lie, we all know it) is taking her rightful place as Queen Bee and we will all buzz happily around her. Especially considering she dresses like this: </p>

<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/andaria.jpg" width="212" height="462" alt="" border="0"><br><i>Mmmm, sinful!</i></p>

<p class="body">And of course, her natural response would probably be something like:</p>

<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/meanandi.jpg" width="327" height="38" alt="" border="0"><br><i>Mean ole' Andi :(</i></p>


<p class="body">But seriously, congratulations are certainly in order! So long dirf man, get laid sometime this year, eh? And to the rest of you, be nice to Andi, damnit! You don't have to be nice to Gromlok, though. I mean, who really likes him anyway? But Andaria, yeah, you gotta be nice to her! :)

<p class="body">That's right, we're looking for the few, the brave, the wacky and wild! Basically, here's a great shot at getting in one of the most stable and well respected guilds on the server. And I promise, I won't make you do what I typically make new recruits do. Health code violations these days are getting tighter and tighter :(.<br><br>

On that note, check the charter for the newest application standards and make sure and give you local Pak recruiter a tell :).

<br><br>Oh, you're probably wondering what we're up to, well.. clearing time weekly, as usual, working on flagging for Ikkinz 4 (This event, single handed, will make WoW a success, but as usual, Pak is overcoming the flaming hoops set before us). Between DX9 crap, event bugs, flag/key bugs, we're still rolling along nicely. No real point in showing a screenshot at this point because, well.. it all looks the god damned same. Just imagine one of the mobs you see in the first zones but with a longer name. And by name I mean, an un-intelligible string of characters. Ta ta for now!<br><br>

I actually couldn't read the thing (his book sized bitch fest), I was laughing so hard picturing a nice fat vein about to pop on his forehead when he thought I quit, and the only way I said I quit was on the front page! HAHAHAHA!!!! Omg, people get so worked up :P. I had no idea I'd get this much reaction <3 <3 <3!<br><br>

But anyway, you fuckers aren't rid of me yet! I'm probably going to be out of game for a few more weeks getting the new house set up and internet friendly and all that, but I'll be back. :).<br><br>

<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/god_nothing.jpg" width="600" height="480" alt="" border="0"><br><i>You're impressed, admit it.</i></p>

<p class="body">This is what happens when no one feeds the Gnome information. I don't get a single SS, tale of heroic deeds, nothing. The only way I know we did anything is by a thread tracking what loot was taken, and that's not even real time. So I'm clueless. Here's a big hint to the esteemed bastards who like to bug me to update - SEND ME SOMETHING TO UPDATE WITH. I don't care if it's a story, a funny anecdote (Which I probably wouldn't find funny, in hind sight, so strike that idea) or hell, maybe even screenshots of dead mobs with loot? Ya think!? But noo, let's just sit on our high horse and call the gnome lazy. Why not, right? Well, here's your damned update, you lame bitches.<br><br>

<u>To do:</u><br><br>
Ford dealership (Need a metal bracket to fix my parking break, and some screws for my door panel)<br>
Costco (Pick up apple sauce, couple bottles of wine, and some flowers for grandma)<br>
Grocery store (see list below)<br>
Compare Homeowners Insurance (closing on new house at end of the week)<br>
Pick up paycheck<br>
Deposit said paycheck.<br>
Eat lunch at some point, maybe even play a game of chess.<br>
Masturbate<br>
Drink beer<br>
Masturbate<br><br>

<u>Grocery List:</u><br><br>
Lotion (duh)<br>
bread, sourdough<br>
Stone IPA - Case<br>
tomato sauce<br>
fresh garlic<br>
cheese - Parm and mozz
<br><br>

Now some might wonder why I'm not there personally to tell these stories and take these screenshots. Well, I'm closing on a new house this week, I'm working, (soon to be, anyway) two jobs, trying to get the current house up to snuff to sale shortly after moving into the new one (what a pain in the ass that is), while trying to find time to do the things that make me, well.. me. Like for instance; Drinking beer, surfing porn, masturbating, having sex, and occasionally, sleeping. Imagine my girlfriends shock and dismay if I weren't doing one of the above mentioned activities. Imagine mine! So fat loot is collected, and we raid happily. I'm not really sure how often we raid but we're cleaning up time and Ikkinz from what I can gather. There you have it.<br><br>

<p class="body">That'll be the first of many. The servers were still all screwed up with 1017's and people going randomly LD so we called tonight short but we'll be back tomorrow! We're used to dealing with bugs by now, eh? So far so good!<br><br>

<p class="body">Yeah so we finally stuffed the big ass bastard into a wall. Loot was, uh.. Bracer of Inferno, some caster earring thingy, a stone and a leather BP.. Yeah, leather, how appropriate? But hey, we got a plate BP from RZ 30 min before that :). Great job Pak, hopefully we've got this time clearing business down, or will soon, and it'll be old hat for us as we explore the new expansion :).<br><br>

Maybe they should be hired by SOE for Customer Service, they seem to have a better notion of it then a bazillion dollar company. Anyway - On to time!<br><br>

Getting back to the last mob left alive before the MONTH break from raiding in time, we went back and knocked the fool on the head in short order.</p>

<p class="body">And then there was yesterday. Phases 1-4 cleared, RZ and Bert killeded, and Pak'Cafan got it's first look at Quarms lair, with Quarm actually in it OMG OMG!</p>

<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/timequarm.jpg" width="600" height="480" alt="" border="0"><br><i>I'm sure it looked a lot like this. I was at a Superbowl party all day, getting shitty drunk so... Here you have it, art of the highest order.</i></p>

<p class="body">It feels good to be back to the grind stone. I try not to think about how far we could have been if not for our month long break, thanks to SOE. We would probably had Time down to 2 days. I would have whored a decent amount of loot and wouldn't have fallen so far behind those lame ass bards in hp. Oh well.. we're back, we're still pissed and we won't forget, but we're back.<br><br>
