<p class="body">Yes, I've been slacking. It's not so much that, though, it's more like, we've just been too damned busy! Yeah, that's it. And these god damned aliens and spiders with their nuclear death hotdog guns.. You know what I'm talking about, don't you. Uh huh, yeah.<br><br>

Right, so, anyway, back to the update. Well, we've been kicking around Rallos a bit. This is when our perfectionist attitudes really come to the surface. Oh and our sexual orientation, of course. Take this, for example: </p>

<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/rzpoetry.jpg" width="461" height="26" alt="" border="0"></p>

<p class="body">You heard it right, boys and girls, Poetry. Anyway, so far our poem kinda sucks, but it has some serious promise, let me tell you! We think after 3 nights, getting RZtW himself down 70ish% isn't half bad for a bunch of scrubs. But in the mean time, we've been getting our .. eh, <i>pharm on.</i></p>

<p class="body" align="center">
<a href="Images/Screenshots/agnarr1.jpg"><img src="Images/Screenshots/agnarr1_thumb.jpg" width="300" height="243" alt="" border="0"></a><br><i>Whacked, a few times. I really like this event, actually. It's kinda fun. I still think the mini's should drop some loot too but I'm greedy.</i><br><br>

<a href="Images/Screenshots/mmfarm.jpg"><img src="Images/Screenshots/mmfarm_thumb.jpg" width="300" height="203" alt="" border="0"></a><br><i>Yup, pharm on!</i><br><br>

<a href="Images/Screenshots/bert2.jpg"><img src="Images/Screenshots/bert2_thumb.jpg" width="300" height="240" alt="" border="0"></a><br><i>This event still makes my eyes bleed.</i><br><br>

<img src="Images/Screenshots/uberbploot.jpg" width="263" height="146" alt="" border="0"><br><i>Ahhh yes, the reason we still farm this worm. Yes, I'm gloating.</i></p>

<p class="body">And of course, we've been playing around a bit in Sol Ro, just popping the mini's and enjoying the freaky pathing and wall aggro. It really is kinda like my first trip to Disney Land. Big freaky lookin shit just comes out of no where. Eh, good fun for the whole family. Here's the only SS I have of the joint.</p>

<p class="body">Mmmm... BDSM chicks rule, that fucking bird bites ass, however. I mean, it really makes for an interesting event, but it's interesting like fishing around a garbage disposal with your NUTSACK, in an electrical storm. </p>

<p class="body">Oh and because, you know, we're such a high profile guild that I simply *know* SOE reads this site, I want to bring something to your attention.</p>

[Wed Apr 30 19:59:47 2003] <b>You died.</b> </p>

<p class="body">FIX THIS! Thanks. And just so you know, we haven't been idle. Just going through the whole 'backflagging hell' thing and farming loot. I think we cacked just about every flag mob in the last two weeks, aside from Agnarr and RZ himself, just for the sake of flagging. No, I'm not going to post more screenshots. You know what they look like. But damn, have we been busy.</p>

<p class="body">Was kick ass fight, had a lot of time left even when he fell. Great job everyone, pulled it off famously! We knew when we got him to 80% on a botched pull the first attempt ever, that he'd fall on the second. Even with god damned strange agro and ghosting, training puslings, he's still dead! And the zone didn't even crash! We've got one hell of a group of people together. Good job everyone.</p>

<p class="body">The two Feks.. I mean, Zek brothers are down, gone, see ya. It's been a relatively quiet few weeks. Tons of back flagging and of course some major farmage. But I'll just shut the hell up and show you some pretty pictures you've likely seen before.</p>

<p class="body">Hrm.. what else, killed TT about half dozen times, seems to be our favorite fight. BP a few more times, blah blah blah.</P> 

<p class="body">And to more important stuff… I was woken up at 6:30 this morning by my next door neighbors. It literally sounded like this guy was killing his kids. Everyone was screaming to high bloody hell, the mom was shouting, and I heard what sounded like a god damned chain saw. WTF! I don't really give a good god damn if he's taking a chainsaw to his whole family, it doesn't concern me, get it? But PLEASE, use a damned axe and tape their mouths first. This shit pisses me off! </P>

<p class="body">But I'm awake, so I guess I'll just watch the blood and carnage and work on my speech to the news stations as to how they were a quiet family. </P>

<p class="body">Hrmm.. not quite the scene I was expecting for a 6am murder orgy. The kids have a shopping cart (yes, I live in the hood) in the middle of the street, with three of the lil' bastards in it, and two pushing the shit around, and the dad is uh.. weed eating a tree. Yeah, a damned tree. There are leaves going everywhere, and this guy is shielding his eyes with one hand and poking the stupid weed eater up in the damned tree! Seriously, what is wrong with these people? </P>

<p class="body">So I called the cops and told them I think my neighbor is beating his kids. I mean, he probably is anyway, at some point. I'm sure they probably deserved it, but I figure the lull while the cops take him out back and beat the crap out of him will let me get back to sleep and we can all be happy. But no, the local 357 ice cream trucks had their 'bat alarm' go off that there were children outside their house so they are now circling my place like sharks. </P>

<p class="body">Yes, I hate my neighborhood. </P>

<p class="body">Anyway, it was a fun day. Popped the orange freak again, /farmed TT, and finally punked RD, all in one day! </p>

<p class="body">So, yeah… That's my big update. Blame Mix. If he wouldn't have bought me so many beers, I might have added some more pizzazz or some shit. But as it is, I'm just so god damned glad that RD is DEAD. We went into the stupid thing thinking we were going to fail. "Yeah, let's do RD.. We have time for a CR." I mean. We didn't even really have that many people on but we still wanted to try. Glad we did! But, of course, we still have to kill the fuck again. Ugh! That is, by far, the lamest fight EVER. I enjoy fighting IV more then that, and everyone knows how much I hate luclin.<br><br>

<p class="body">Yeah, I haven't updated in awhile but it's not because I'm a lazy bastard (well, sorta), it's because we're in farm mode. We've been working on flagging our slackers for all the tier 2/3 planes, farming some luclin crap so our casters stop whining, etc. etc. AD x2 MB x3 TT x(too damned many), Grummas x3, Caprin xBillions, BP xAlot, THO xbleh, Grieg xWhocares? and in our spare time, we toy around with Raddya'dar. Yes, masochist are we.</p>

<p class="body">Oh and we popped this big orange freak because our status on Realpoor was in the dumps and they seemed to find this dude important. And since we live for status n' shit, here ya go. </p>

<a href="Images/Screenshots/aow.jpg"><img src="Images/Screenshots/aow_thumb.jpg" width="400" height="258" alt="" border="0"></a></p>

<p class="body">I made the threat that I won't update next until a certain mob is dead.. Actually, it could be one of two mobs. So I should be updating in a few days :D.<p>
