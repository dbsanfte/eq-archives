	<p class="body">Patch = fun. Not fun because the channels were broken (god how I missed them), not funny because there were waves of people going LD every 15-20 minutes. But fun because we actually had something to do!! Woohoo! It's a pretty sad state when we're excited about a day ridden with bugs and problems just because we can make some pixels dead, but alas, we're all screwed in the head.<br><br>

So anyway, some dead shit over the last week.<br><br>

<p class="body" align="center"><a href="Images/Screenshots/statue_92602.jpg"><img src="Images/Screenshots/statue_92602_thumb.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="" border="0"></a><br><i>Been awhile since we got a shot at this guy, damned AoW farmers!</i></p>

<p class="body">We also, at some point, did Doze and a few other things that I can't think of off the top of my head and fail to have SS for. Hopefully we'll get another decent round of patch kills today, yay! Go verant, break more shit! Oh and to those who constantly bitch about me running without the new models? Send me a damned computer that'll run it or shut the hell up! That is all.<br><br><p class="body"><i>-Rasil Sabishi, Gnome Assassin</i></p>
	
	
	<p class="body"><b>9/10</b><br>
	<p class="body">Alrighty then, everyone will just have to work with me here. I managed to make the patch on Wednesday, but my cable company decided that I've been playing way too much and been having entirely too much fun with this broke ass game, so they zinged my cable modem for the following two days.<br><br> 

I got screenshots but not stories so Uh… I'm just going to imagine how the fights went, k? K…<br><br>

First off, we did the typical WToV group of friends making us official farmers of WToV, yay us! Scroll down if you really need to see screenshots of them, they really look the same (sans the drake eating WelaMix). I wish I had the foresight to snag a screenshot of one the more charming people on the server when they asked if we were done 'Zerging' WToV. How I wish we had the members to Zerg :(.  News flash! 4 groups is <I>not</I> zerg. Especially with no deaths, k? This server can amuse me so.<br><br>

So anyway, I'm not really sure what happened after that, so uh.. we all went and jumped off cliffs for fun! Wheeee! *shrug*<br><br>

The next day we hit Zlandicar, and no premature Zlandication this time, he dropped nicely from what I hear. According to reports, Andaria was MT and her own primary healer. Power of the pink, and all that. In fact, I think everyone even died when Zland was at like 75% but Andaria snarled defiantly and laid into poor Zland. Unable withstand her pink fury, he feign deathed and gave up his loots just to get her to back the hell off. Hell hath no scorn like a lady in pink.<br><br>

<p class="body" align="center"><a href="Images/Screenshots/zland_90602.jpg"><img src="Images/Screenshots/zland_90602_thumb.jpg" width="300" height="190" alt="" border="0"></a><br><i>Click to see Pink Lady!</i></p>

<p class="body">From what I understand, the fight with Doze was pretty much the same, well.. only a ranger died. It was set up from the beginning, there was a secret channel to tell everyone but Torent when Andaria (the MT) would turn the mob around just as Doze enraged. Worked flawlessly, as you all can see.<br><br>

<p class="body" align="center"><a href="Images/Screenshots/doze_90602.jpg"><img src="Images/Screenshots/doze_90602_thumb.jpg" width="300" height="217" alt="" border="0"></a></p>

<p class="body">So anyway, I'm sure we did other cool stuff like uh.. yeah, we killed AoW! With 3 people and a necro pet! Ya.. so, uh.. there.<br><br><p class="body"><i>-Rasil Sabishi, Gnome Assassin</i></p>

	
	<p class="body"><b>9/02</b><br>
	<p class="body">Ya know.. This has to be one of the most difficult updates I've yet to do. I simply don't know what to say. Well, not to get ahead of myself… <br><br>We get a few peeps together to whack this guy.</p><br><br>
<p class="body" align="center"><a href="Images/Screenshots/burrower.jpg"><img src="Images/Screenshots/burrower_thumb.jpg" width="300" height="225" alt="" border="0"></a><br><i>I'm sure any mother would hate this face too.</i></p>
<p class="body">Good loots, all around. I'm not really sure what dropped or who got what except... Well, a new icon was born. I simply can't think of anything to say to properly comment on this, so I'll just show you.</p><br><br>

<p class="body">It really is pink. And on to further uh.. news? Um.. is this supposed to be a news page? Er, well, no matter. We also greased a named in UP, whacked some ugly fish in CS, and farmed a lot of uh.. PLATE from HoT (Seriously Verant, not nearly enough plate drops. Plz fix! (yes, this is sarcasm)). This is really the update that writes itself. There is nothing further I could say to add to the sheer absurdity of it all :). So I leave you with these fine gems.</p><br>

<p class="body">/petition Patch more often, we're bored!<br>

<p class="body"><i>-Rasil Sabishi, Gnome Assassin</i></p>

	<p class="body"><b>8/30</b><br>
	Ahhh nothing much like a fun filled day of EQ, is there? Uh.. don't answer that. Anyway, we found Gozz's lame ass up in WToV and whacked him in our typical flawless style (shut up).</p><br><br>

<p class="body" align="center"><a href="Images/Screenshots/gozz_083002.jpg"><img src="Images/Screenshots/gozz_083002_thumb.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt="" border="0"></a><br>
<I>Okay so we had one death but that's because someone was afk watching porn and wasn't paying attention.</I></p>

<p class="body">Then we decided to have a bit of fun. Oh yes, we did. So we get this bright idea that we're going to go to Kael and see if the big dork Vindi is around (faction!). Well, he is, there is another guild setting up for him but we take our shot first. Now the trick here is, since we've done Vindi countless times with no problems, we decide everyone must drink. Heavily. So we have Derringer bot our mage, not to summon mod rods or anything, who the hell uses those things anymore? No.. we summon a shit load of booze and just go to town. I'd have screenshots of this but, well… I was dead. But let me tell you, it was hysterical! I veritable drunken three ringed circus! We had lions, tigers, and a lot of damned bears.<br><br> 

So, in a drunken stupor, some cleric is too busy chatting it up with one of those vixen druids (he was talking to a wall, but thought it was a vixen druid) and missed his heal. That's okay, we didn't like Gromlok much anyway.<br><br> 

"Hmmmm", we collectively think, we really don't let our hybrids tank nearly enough on raids. Oh sure, we tease a tank or two with a few heals and make him think he's the big hero but we ultimately let him die out of pure meanness. Everyone should get a turn tanking Vindi! What a fantastic idea! Hell, we'll even let the faction moochers tank some, why should they be denied the privilege of being ass raped by Vindi?<br><br>

Clerics? Pah! Slackers, let 'em tank! I'm no Forrest Gump, let me tell you, ping pong isn't my game. Dizzy and not feeling so well, I retreat to the corner to puke my guts out. Of course I get the Vindi lovin.<br><br> 

The result of this prison shower scene? (as Domanick said), We didn't so much win as.. Vindi just got bored and fell over. Naturally, Alchork got the kill shot. Yes, Alchork is a cleric.<br><br>

Everyone should try drunken Vindi killings. It's much like when you get drunk at a house party and think that taking all your cloths off and shoving a greased rubber chicken up your butt sounds like a good idea, and the crowd is in stitches, only to wake up the next day not feeling quite right about the decision. Yes, much like that.<br><br></p>

<p class="body"><b>8/28</b><br>
It's been a fairly relaxing week (okay, a lil' longer) but we've been busy XPing, armor farming, finishing a few epics (Congratulations to Cormanthel and Bleweyes) We even took a trip to Griegs with a severely undermanned crew just to get a better idea of what a serious attempt on Grieg himself would take. He'll be dead soon. <br><br>

Oh and can't forget our run in with CT (the big mud ball) and had an awesome attempt on him. It was our first attempt at him ever so it was a learning experience, but even with that we got him down to 20% and called it because it was <i>sooo</i> freaking late on a weeknight. He'll be dead soon too. <br><br>

Also, Pak got a lot of fresh blood over the past few weeks with the acceptance of former Al'Kali guild members. They are a fantastic bunch of people and I look forward to dying horrible deaths next to them. Not only have we brought the Al'Kali bunch into our fold, we also have other new recruits these past few days, to which: <br><br>

<i>"We welcome the newest members of our family with open<br>
arms.  We all look forward to experiencing and raiding<br>
with you.  Let's go kill something! :)" <br><br>
-Nalance, Guildleader of Pak'Cafan</i><br><br>

Right, now that all the mundane crap is covered, I've a question to those Sushi fans out there. Have any of you tried 'Uni'? It's sea urchin. I really can't believe anyone actually eats this shit. And I mean that in the most literal sense of the word. It's probably been 5 years since my ill fated run in with 'Uni' but here a few weeks ago I conned WelaMix into trying this nasty little sea turd (I'm a sadist, what can I say).<br><br>

He's been pissed at me ever since. I believe his response was (and I paraphrase) 'WTF! (yes, he even said the letters really loud, hence the caps), this is sea turd! It takes like turd, it looks like turd, has the texture of turd, it's a god damn sea TURD!' And he's right, of course. It's nasty as hell. So seriously, who eats that shit?

Okay I'm going to go nurse my hang over from last nights sushi/sake session, we'll have some dead pixels for ya next time or I'll post a pic of Derringers nasty hairy nut sack (never leave your camera out at parties =\). So everyone better make damned sure we kill something soon, else those nasty giggle berries are going to grace this front page, larger.. er, approximate to real life size. </p>

<p class="body"><b>8/13</b><br>
	Bored with binge drinking and itching to see pixels that used to move around a lot... not move around at all. Decided to see what was happening today in the EQ neighborhood. Raced for Zlandicar for our token free ST key, won the race, had our shot and uh.. Well.. erm.. I mean... Okay, so we had a minor case of premature Zlandication. It can happen to anybody, right? What with all the hormones floating around and what not. <br><Br><p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/pre_zland.jpg" width="500" height="289" alt="" border="0"><br><i>I blame Derringer, personally.</i></p><br><br><p class="body">We did manage to pull off a WWF style royal rumble with rat city to bag Vaniki, which in and of itself isn't all that interesting, the fact that we fought the entire city at once, however.. was. I would show a Screenshot of this but I think most people have seen the nexus. Oof.<br><br>
	But we simply had to kill something, so we took our 22 man crew and after an exceedingly close (6%!!) first battle, we bagged Gozzrem on the second go around with zero deaths.<br><br><p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/gozz-081302.jpg" width="392" height="400" alt="" border="0"><br><i>We cheated, of course.</i><br><br><a href="Images/Screenshots/cleric_sploit.jpg"><img src="Images/Screenshots/cleric_sploit_thumb.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt="" border="0"></a><br><i>Our patented cleric-wall sploit.

<p class="body"><b>8/04</b><br>
	Nothing much today alive but we started it off with a little early morning Klandicar action. It was kind of an abortion of a raid with no bards or wizards and only what, 26 peeps up that god awfully early? (Yes, 10:00am is too god damned early on a Sunday!) After our first try where we all, simultaneously, fell on our (insert sharp object of choice here), we rebuffed, pulled an ultimate three stooges and poke Klandicar in the eyes until dead. Nyuk Nyuk Nyuk....<br><Br><p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/klan_080402.jpg"><br>Rumblar discussing the merits of dying with our dear dragon friend.<br><br>

<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/klan-die_080402.jpg"><br>Klandicar slipped on a banana strategically placed by yours truly. Elite strat for not having enough of the right people.. poke in eyes, slap head, and say Nyuk Nyuk. The banana thing was just insult to injury. (Yes, this is a bastardization of our last Klandicar kill SS, but everyone sucks and didn't take another SS.. It looked the same, trust me)<br><br></p>

<p class="body">Okay I'm going to go shower (it does happen, ya know) and go get piss drunk. We might be doing other stuff right now, if anything popped.. but well, I'm not there so it's unimportant and basically didn't happen. Oh ya, Waran got the key. <br>
<p class="body"><i>-Rasil Sabishi, Gnome Assassin</i></p>


<p class="body"><b>7/31</b><br>
	The night of SUCK. That's what we had tonight, at first anyway. The patch was early so by the time we had people on most everything was dead except for HoT named and an expected Doze. We haven't done an old fashioned armor farm in awhile and we needed a few symbols so we decided give it a go.<br><br>
It sucked.<br><br>
No, I mean, it /really/ sucked. Every guild gets hit by the suck stick now and then, it happens. But uh.. normally it's like "Oh Tormax killed 10 people instead of no deaths..." or the fearful "OMG a ranger turned off attack on enrage, that sucks.." You know, the normal nights of suck. This night of SUCK was Epic. Nay, BIBLICAL.<br><br> 
Seriously, give me one solid group and I can do HoT nice and easy, we had a nice sized force, enough to easily take 3 mobs of really any kind. Did we? No.. Of course not. It all started with a botched pull by yours truly (/bow), followed by not one... not two... but three freaking wipe outs! Yes, wipe outs in HoT *hangs head in shame*<br><br>
But then Derringer - our rock, our shining light, our Dirf who likes to take pictures of his hairy nut sack with unsuspecting friend's cameras - shows up. We were then unstoppable. Three AE'ing mobs? That's IT? Bring MORE! Derringer is here!<br><br>
So we finished a clean sweep of the halls and right on Que. Doze spawns right as we're pulling the last named. I always appreciate a punctual pixel. Really I do.<br>
<p class="body" align="center"><img src="Images/Screenshots/doze_73102.jpg"><br>Flawless victory, yet again. (I don't count the two deaths to a mid fight add. You shouldn't either. It was big and had pointy teeth.)<br><br>
<p class="body">As far as loot from the armor farm (haha that's funny)... Four items dropped out of a complete HoT clearing. Excuse me?<br><br>
But we did get symbols/tears to complete a couple of those caster shields for Quasimyth, Alchork, and... (who's getting third one? No one tells me anything.) that I don't give a crap about (caster lewt, pfft), as well as some sort of boots or something that Welamix seemed hot and bothered about, Bleweyes got the first Tear for that quest as well. OH! I almost forgot, got the last piece I needed for my nice dragon toof. Now I just need to go suck it up and convince Telk that me killing him those few times last week was really just a big misunderstanding. Yes Telk.. I'm really your friend.. Would you like a nice box of chocolates?<br><br>And thus endeth our night of sucketh. I'd post more Screenshots but no one emailed me any, so there.<br><br>
