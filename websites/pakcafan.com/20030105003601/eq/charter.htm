</CENTER></P>







</strong>

  <P>Our guild is a highly selective guild. We have all experience levels, from 

    before our level limit change, however we are mostly 51+.</P>







  

  <P>The first step in deciding on whether or not you wish to join Pak'Cafan is 

    to read the charter below (and the rest of the website if you so choose) and 

    see if our principles align with yours, and is something you think you wish 

    to be a part of.</P>

  <P>At this point you will need to obtain 3 referals from members of Pak'Cafan 

    (officer referals count as 2). If you wish to join us, you probably know a 

    few of our members. If you know of some members who wish to sponsor you, you 

    need to approach them and ask them if you can use their name as a sponsor. 

    Once you have their permission, please send <a href="mailto:Cormanthel@hotmail.com">an 

    email</a> providing the three sponsor's names. Once a background check has 

    been completed, an application will be sent.</P>

  <P>Fill out the application then return it. That is the last step the applicant 

    needs to do. At this point, the returned application is sent out to all the 

    officers via email and is voted on. Once a majority is reached the applicant 

    is informed of the decision.</P>

  <P>When first invited the applicant becomes a cub. (see Cub Status below for 

    more information) The cub is still bound by any and all rules and regulations 

    of Pak'Cafan. The guildtag will be above your head, and your actions will 

    reflect the guild as a whole.</P>

  <P>Once the Cub period has ended, the now former cub gains access to all memebrs 

    only areas of the forums and website.</P>

  <P>This isn't designed to be a short procedure. Those who are truely interested 

    in Pak'Cafan will take the time necessary to go through all the steps to become 

    a Pak member. The rewards of the strong tight knit family and a fun group 

    of people to hang around with is well worth the effort.</P>

      <FONT CLASS=headingwhite>Multiple-Character Policy</FONT>

    </CENTER>

  </P>

  <P>A current guild member may have another character accepted into Pak'Cafan 

    if they meet the following criteria.</P>

  <P><IMG SRC="Images/safbul3a.gif"



HEIGHT="12" WIDTH="12" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> The first character 

    to be accepted into Pak'Cafan must obtain level 40.</P>

  <P><IMG SRC="Images/safbul3a.gif"



HEIGHT="12" WIDTH="12" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> The first character 

    must have been in the guild for a duration of 2 real life months.</P>

  <P><IMG SRC="Images/safbul3a.gif"



HEIGHT="12" WIDTH="12" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> The second character 

    to be admitted into Pak'Cafan must have obtained the 25th level.</P>

  <P><IMG SRC="Images/safbul3a.gif"



HEIGHT="12" WIDTH="12" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> The person controlling 

    both personas must agree, and adhere to the discontinuation of any and all 

    twinking of their second character that has gained acceptance into Pak'Cafan. 

    This is on an honor system, but any proven abuse of this specific rule may 

    lead up to and including removal of both personas from the guild.</P>

  <P><IMG SRC="Images/safbul3a.gif"



HEIGHT="12" WIDTH="12" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> A single person may 

    only have two personas in Pak'Cafan. You cannot swap personas. Nor can you 

    ever have more than two personas in Pak'Cafan at any time.</P>

  <P><IMG SRC="Images/safbul3a.gif"



HEIGHT="12" WIDTH="12" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> By gaining the guildtag 

    on your second character you are agreeing to all the privileges and restrictions 

    of the guild and our policy's.</P>

  <P><img src="Images/safbul3a.gif"



height="12" width="12" naturalsizeflag="0" align="BOTTOM"> When does your alt 

    not become an alt any longer? When that alt at least supercedes your previous 

    characters level, or reaches level 51. Or if that character is played 

    for more than 75% of the time you are online. For a less definate version 

    -- what character do you log on first 75% of the days you play.</P>

  <P>If any of your personas don't agree with this any part of this policy, don't 

    take the time and effort of bringing that second character into Pak'Cafan.</P>

    <p><font class=headingwhite>Hand Me Down Policy</font> </p>

    <p align="left">I'm not sure how many of you view the &quot;Hand me down&quot; 

      policy, but the officers have come to a consensus about how &quot;Hand me 

      downs&quot; should work. First of all, let me start with the basics. When 

      an item comes into your hands that you have obtained, then if that item 

      replaces a piece of equipment, then the replaced item should be handed down 

      to the next person of your class that can use it. In other words if it replaces 

      an item you wear, then you have to hand the item replaced down. But if it 

      is an item you win that you do not use/wear, you may do with it as you wish.</p>

    <p align="left">Now there is a few exceptions to the policy and that is if<br>

      <b>A)</b> The item replaced is No Drop, in which case it can't be handed 

      down.<br>

      <b>B) </b>The item replaced could be better used as resist gear/raid gear<br>

      <b>C) </b>There is no one who wants/needs the item replaced(within reason)</p>

    <p align="left">Now this is where it gets difficult. When handing down an 

      item there are some things to consider. I will make a list for you, in no 

      particular order, that should be used when evaluating the item to be handed 

      down.</p>

    <p align="left"><b>1.</b> An approximate level needed to obtain the item<br>

      <b>2.</b> Your class has priority(within reason)<br>

      <b>3.</b> Main characters are priority, alt characters are secondary<br>

      <b>4.</b> Any classes that could better use this item</p>

    <p align="left">Now to touch up on each of these.<br>

      <b>1.</b> Level needed to obtain the item. Figure out what level is needed 

      that could possibly obtain the &quot;hand me down&quot; in a full group.<br>

      <b>2.</b> Your class has priority(within reason). Always try to hand down 

      an item within your class first<br>

      <b>3.</b> Main characters are priority, alt characters are secondary. A 

      main character should always have priority before giving to an alt.<br>

      <b>4.</b> Classes that could better use the item. Figure out which class 

      would make better use of the &quot;hand me down&quot;. Who would benefit 

      more?</p>

    <p align="left">Ok, now for an example which will explain things.<br>

      Jim (52 warrior) Bob(49 rogue) Nancy(50 Warrior) Patty(51 Ranger) Mark[29 

      Warrior)Bob's alt]</p>

    <p align="left">Jim is in a group with Pak, and lo and behold a RBG drops 

      and Jim wins the random, so this then replaces his FBSS. Jim takes into 

      all factors, first looking among his class that can use. He notices that 

      Nancy does not need it, since she has a Cloak of Flames. So he looks to 

      the only other warrior and finds that Mark needs it. However, first of all 

      Mark is an alt, and secondly he is too low to obtain this himself. Ok, so 

      between Bob and Patty. Patty has a Hangman's Noose, she could use the upgrade. 

      But Bob doesn't have any haste item, so he would need it more. So Jim, after 

      taking all things into consideration. hands the FBSS down to Bob. Now, if 

      Mark had been level 39 and none of the other Main characters needed it, 

      then Jim could decide to give Mark the FBSS if he thought Mark was of high 

      enough level to be able to obtain one.</p>

    <p align="left">So in closing, this is the information and knowledge that 

      you should keep in mind when choosing to hand down an item. <br>

  <P><IMG SRC="Images/safbul3a.gif"



HEIGHT="12" WIDTH="12" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> Pak'Cafan is not here 

    to provide its members with groups (ie we don't owe you groups when you log 

    on) but what we do provide is a pool of people to pull from when looking or 

    making your own groups.</P>

  <P><FONT CLASS=headingwhite>Rankings: </FONT>The world of Everquest has only 

    three ranks in their world, a guild leader, officers, and members. We will 

    adhere to this, but we will also be adding ranks within each of those divisions. 

    See the page on Ranks for this information. Update (9/8/00) -- Rankings for 

    the officers have been more clearly defined. Member rankings to be forthcomming.</P>

  <P><FONT CLASS=headingwhite>Grouping:</FONT> If you are in a group that gets 

    an opening, try to fill it from the guild or our guild allies before auctioning 

    the spot off to the zone. always try to fill it with your family, this not 

    only builds relations within the guild.. you end up having allot of fun as 

    well (not to mention allot less bickering). Every members goal should be to 

    convert any group into an all allied group (Assuming you couldn't get into 

    a guild group when you logged on). [ Current allies are Fists of Tunare ]</P>

  <P><FONT CLASS=headingwhite>Participation out of Game: </FONT>It is your responsibility 

    to keep up to date on the main news page, as well as the members board. We 

    all have lives, but it doesn't take much time at all to check the main page 

    and then the message board before you log in. The importance of this cannot 

    be underestimated.</P>

  <P><FONT CLASS=headingwhite>Discipline: </FONT>Should there be something that 

    occurs that is in violation of our ethic and morals the officers will meet 

    on said persons behalf and talk amongst themselves. The vote of removal must 

    be unanimous in cases of removal.</P>

  <P><FONT CLASS=headingwhite>Cub Status: </FONT>When someone is accepted into 

    the guild, they first become a cub for four weeks. At this time the cub can 

    leave the guild at any time for any reason. At the same time, any officer 

    can remove any cub at any time with or without reason, and without the above 

    said officers meeting. The cubship period ends when the Dominant Male recieves 

    votes from the Kennel Master and Assistant Kennel Master gives their blessings. 

    At the time of full membership, the passwords to the guild only sections of 

    the message board will be distributed. <FONT SIZE="-1"><I>If votes from the 

    KM and AKM end in 2 - 0 in favor of the cub, the status is dropped, and tenure 

    is gained. If it is 1 - 1 the cub status is prolonged 2 weeks prior to voting 

    again. If the vote is 0 - 2 against the cub then the KM and AKM will adivse 

    the Dominant Male on a suggested corse of action. These numbers won't be made 

    public to the cub, but give an idea of how we decide the Cub Status. ***additional 

    note*** The KM and AKM also have the option to vote undecided at a KM/AKM 

    meeting if they haven't been exposed to the cub enough to form a valid vote. 

    Such an undecided vote will automatically act as if it was a 1-1 vote.</I></FONT></P>

  <P><FONT CLASS=headingwhite>Role Playing: </FONT>To place the emphasis 

    on friendships rather than items. With friends, an unsuccessful camp can still 

    be a day of fun... while a camp with strangers can be nothing more than unending 

    frustration when that item never comes your way.</P>

  <P>Which is just part of the last point...</P>

  <P><FONT CLASS=headingwhite>Last Word: </FONT>Have fun together, and enjoy your 

    time here on Norrath with us. Its so much more fun with family and when you 

    play for fun, not loot. Remember that, and remember the honor you have in 

    being a member of the Pak'Cafan!
