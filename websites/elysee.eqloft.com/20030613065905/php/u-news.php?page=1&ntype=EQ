<br />
** Experience System Change - Grouping ** <br />
<br />
We've made some improvements to the way experience is rewarded in EverQuest. These improvements are aimed at positively reinforcing the act of grouping. After all, this is a Massively Multiplayer game. <br />
<br />
Prior to this update groups gained a 2% to 20% experience bonus for having two to six members. <br />
<br />
As of today this bonus has increased to range from 20% to 80% for having two to five members. When a group adds a sixth member, the 80% bonus remains, but the experience gained is only divided by 5 before being distributed. The sixth group member no longer causes the experience gain to be divided by 6. <br />
<br />
Planes of Power zones had an increased experience award above and beyond those of most other zones. Because of these new dramatic improvements to group experience gains, we will be reducing the zone-specific experience bonus for Planes of Power zones a bit. As long as character is grouped with at least one other in these zones, they will see an improvement in experience gain over the old system. The one down side to the new system is that there will be a small decrease in experience for those who do not group, and only for those who do so in Planes of Power zones. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Experience System Change - Level 60+ ** <br />
<br />
In addition to the above changes, we have increased the range of NPC levels that give a character experience after they reach level 60. This will open up many of the "old world" zones to players previously restricted to Planes of Power zones for experience gain. The range of NPCs that will be "blue" to a level 65 character has been increased as far as level 50, with the "light blue" range extending to level 45. The best experience gains, however, are still for fighting things around and above your level. This should open up areas for high level characters in groups and solo. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Interface ** <br />
<br />
- Shared Bank Vault - We've added two shared bank slots to the interface. These extra bank slots can be accessed by any character on the same account and server. No-Drop and No Rent items can't be placed in these bank slots, and only one of any specific Lore item can exist in the shared bank at any time. <br />
<br />
- Spell Context Menus - This is a new interface menu that will make memorizing spells less tedious. To access the spell menu, just right-click an empty spell gem. This will open a list of spell categories. Point your mouse at a category and a list of spells will be displayed. Select a spell from that list to memorize it in that slot. Your character will sit down, memorize the spell and stand back up. <br />
<br />
- Spell Favorites - Spell favorites are an easy way to memorize a full set of eight spells without the tedious book searching. Right-clicking on the spellbook icon in your spell window will open up the spell favorites menu. You will be able to save your current spell lineup as a favorite, delete a favorite or memorize all the spells in one of your already saved spell sets. You can save as many as ten sets of spell favorites. As with the new spell context menus mentioned above, this will not replace the spellbook, it is meant to make memorizing large numbers of spells more convenient. <br />
<br />
- Spell Descriptions - We have expanded the spell description window. Along with the information that has always been available, we have added an explanation about what the spell does in general that includes damage and duration when appropriate. You can see these new descriptions by right-clicking and holding on the spell scroll, the spell gem in your Spells window, or the spell icon in your spellbook. <br />
<br />
- New Camera - We've added a new camera mode to the game. Lovingly dubbed the EQ Cam, it uses the mouse wheel to allow you to zoom away from your character into a "chase" camera. This only works from first person mode (the default view). Using the mouse wheel you can determine the distance of the camera from your character, or to zoom back into first person mode. When in the chase mode, mouselook turns the character and camera together and you can change the pitch of the camera using the mouse. <br />
<br />
- NPC Names - Many NPCs will be displaying additional titles to make it clearer what their job is. For example, an NPC that sells tailoring supplies may have the title [Tailor Supplies] under their name. This will help folks find the proper merchant. It's analogous to them hanging out their shingle. <br />
<br />
- Rare Character Select Crash - Using the arrow keys to try to change the selected character at the character select screen when there were no characters on the account was causing people to crash out of the game. That's fixed now. <br />
<br />
- Guild Message of the Day - Using certain HTML codes when setting up a Guild Message of the Day was causing all members of the guild to crash. While this may have been amusing for pranks on your guild, we still decided to fix it. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Spells ** <br />
<br />
- Spell level limits now enforced - Some high level spells cannot be cast on characters under a certain level. In the past a caster could get around this level restriction when casting a group version of a spell by targeting a higher level group member, and the spell would take effect on the whole group, regardless of their level. That loophole has been closed. We're sorry if you have grown accustomed to the system working this way, but those level restrictions are important to the integrity of lower level gameplay. <br />
<br />
- Incineration and Conglaciation of Bones - Both of these spells should now crit and stack (when cast by different casters). <br />
<br />
- Divine Intervention - This spell should now be reporting the amount of healing it delivers. <br />
<br />
- Healing Messages - The target of a healing spell will now get a message telling them the caster's name and the amount of healing they receive. <br />
<br />
- Reporting Damage Over Time - Damage over Time (DoT) done to NPCs will now be reported to the caster every time it does damage. These messages can be filtered in the Options window. <br />
<br />
- Boon of the Garou - The level restriction for this spell has been removed. We have also fixed a bug with the spell that would prevent it from being cast on target that are not on a horse if the enchanter is on horseback (spell still cannot affect those on horseback). <br />
<br />
- Wake of Karana - To improve the usefulness of this spell, we have lowered the recast time from 90 seconds to 15 seconds. <br />
<br />
- Beastlord Warders - Beastlords will once again be able to summon their warders in the Plane of Sky. Sorry for the delay in getting this one fixed properly. <br />
<br />
- Familiars - Familiars will no longer attempt to equip items. This was causing them to try to wear weapons inside their heads, which probably isn't a good thing for them to do. <br />
<br />
- Spirit spell line - We have added +75 dexterity to the effects of Spirit of Flame, Spirit of Rellic, and Spirit of Snow. <br />
<br />
- Spell stacking and blocking - Changed the following spell lines to cause them to bounce off of each other. Each line should block everything from the other line, but still be overwritten by spells of the same line. <br />
<br />
Spiritual Strength <br />
Spiritual Brawn <br />
Spiritual Vigor <br />
<br />
Strength of Tunare <br />
Strength of Nature <br />
<br />
Brell's Mountainous Barrier <br />
Brell's Stalwart Shield <br />
Brell's Steadfast Aegis <br />
<br />
- Translocation spells - Fixed a bug with translocation spells. If a second translocation spell was cast on a character before he had accepted the first, both would fail. <br />
<br />
- Spell casting pets - In the past, pets were restricted to casting spells of level 20 and below. We have given them access to higher level spells. You may want to be careful with them until you get used to their new abilities. <br />
<br />
- Drunken Riders - We fixed an odd bug that allowed people who were extremely drunk to cast spells without mana cost while on a horse. Yes, crazy bugs like that actually happen.  <br />
<br />
<br />
** Zones ** <br />
<br />
- Droga and Nurga - The mines of Nurga have been inhabited by crafty Goblins and stolid Burynai for many long years, digging and slaving away under the earth. It's time to shake them up! The redesign for these zones are now on the Legends server, Stormhammer. The mines of Nurga are a fun zone for characters of levels about 40 to 55. The Temple of Droga accommodates characters around 50th to 65th level. Both zones will have some new events and quest, while retaining the distinct feel of the zones. <br />
<br />
- Veksar - Since the rediscovery of the lands of Kunark, there have been rumors springing from the ancient lore of the Iksar. Most of those rumors remain unfounded, as gaining access to the lore of the insular Iksar is no easy task. One of the most persistent legends is about a city that lies buried under the Lake of Ill Omen. That city was called Veksar, and it is up to you to discover the tale of its fate. <br />
<br />
- Planes of Power access - Planes of Power has provided us with valuable insight into the group and guild dynamics that are involved in large scale games. The way that we had expected guilds to advance through the story of Planes of Power has become a problem for some guilds as some members have fallen behind and found it difficult to catch up. Obviously this was not our intention. We want people to play with their friends and guild mates. <br />
<br />
To correct this issue, we will be allowing characters to enter the following Planes of Power zones by meeting a simple level requirement: <br />
<br />
Level 55 and over <br />
Plane of Storms <br />
Plane of Torment <br />
Plane of Valor <br />
Crypt of Decay <br />
<br />
Level 62 and over <br />
Bastion of Thunder <br />
Halls of Honor <br />
<br />
Characters that don't meet the level requirement may still enter these zones using the existing flags, and raids may still bring additional unflagged or lower level characters with them. All other planes with flag or story requirements for entry will still require those flags, and those flags can still be obtained as they always have. <br />
<br />
This will make the majority of Planes of Power zones available to characters over the minimum level, and will allow their guilds to travel and adventure together in the planes. We understand that those that have already earned the entry flags for these zones have put some effort into that accomplishment. We will be giving a reward to those that have done so, in the form of a nice Charm slot item and Alternate Advancement points based on the number of planes you've gained access to. <br />
<br />
The reward for planar progression will be available this week. We found an issue with part of the reward on Test server, and are in the process of fixing it. This is a top priority and we plan to bring it to all live servers this week. <br />
<br />
<br />
- Great Divide - The Plane of Knowledge portal in the Great Divide will now be available when the Ring War is in progress. <br />
<br />
- Bastion of Thunder - We have upgraded the loot available from many of the mini-bosses in the Bastion of Thunder to make the reward more inline with the risk. <br />
<br />
- Sol Ro's Tower - They look like frogs, hop like frogs and now they even react to spells like frogs. Flame Frogs are now flagged as animals. <br />
<br />
- Rallos Zek encounter - Rallos Zek will remove anyone from the zone that attacks him if they are not part of the raid that has him engaged. Even in war, there are rules to be followed. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Items ** <br />
<br />
- Tradeskill item flag - There is a new flag on items. When viewing the information about an item, if you see that it has a Tradeskill flag, it is an item that can be used in a tradeskill recipe. This isn't to clearly spell out every item that is used in every tradeskill recipe. The intent is to assist those who are finding items that do not already have an obvious use, by letting them know that the item is used in a tradeskill recipe, somewhere. <br />
<br />
- LoY "Fine Steel" - Many of the more commonly dropped weapons in the Legacy of Ykesha zones were a bit too powerful for the ease and level needed to get them. Some of the most out of line items were the Harpoon, Luggald Trident, and Luggald Dagger. We've decided that it is necessary to tune them down a bit. <br />
<br />
- The Hollow Acrylia Obelisk - This is the old Acrylia key. It has been changed into a charm. This charm can be used by anyone, not just those that own LoY. <br />
<br />
- Bows - The Longbow of the Grimlings and the Bow of Gloaming have both been given ranges. They can now be used properly. <br />
<br />
- The Burning Flame Shield - This item had the wrong resist modifiers. It now has a +30 fire resistance and a -10 cold resistance. <br />
<br />
- Bazaar Search - Non-instrument items with instrument modifiers will now show up in instrument type searches in the Bazaar. <br />
<br />
- Ornate Stone Medicine Totem - This item can now be equipped. <br />
<br />
- Storm Reaper Thorn Machete - This newbie Halfling quest weapon is now flagged as magical. <br />
<br />
- Charm of the Brotherhood - This item will now give a bonus when grouped with others of either the same class or race. <br />
<br />
- Dagger of Distraction - This item can no longer be used by Monks. <br />
<br />
- Edge of Eternity - Beastlords and monks can no longer use this item. <br />
<br />
- Veil of Lost Hopes and Orb of Clinging Death - The casting times on both of these items has been lowered. <br />
<br />
- Magi`Kot's Pants of Convergence - The effect on this item has been changed to summon a Rod of Mystical Transvergance. <br />
<br />
- Cloak of the Falling Skies - The focus effect this item has changed to Preservation of Solusek <br />
<br />
- The Wristguard of Keen Vision - This item is now useable by int. casters. <br />
<br />
- The Mask of Conceptual Energy - This item is now useable by priests. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Alternate Advancement ** <br />
<br />
- Lifeburn - This ability would cause an undue amount of aggro to be generated because it would bring the caster to an extremely low number of hit points, making them look like tasty targets to enemies nearby. To lessen this problem, Lifeburn will no longer reduce the caster to 10 hit points, but to about one fourth of the caster's hit points. This should prevent the additional agro generated while retaining the risk for using the ability. <br />
<br />
- Feigned Minion - The Child of Bertoxxulous pet will no longer cast buff spells to break his feign when under the Feigned Minion effect. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Quests and Tradeskills ** <br />
<br />
- Bankers - There were a few quests that required giving an item to a banker. When we recently removed the ability for characters to give items to bankers to help prevent mistakenly losing items, those quests became unavailable. We have moved those quests to new NPCs. If you see any other quests that ask you to give something to a banker, please use /bug and report it to us. <br />
<br />
- Newly Stackable Items - Valor Crystals, Ceramic Linings, Holgresh Fur and Casks are now stackable. Also, Valor Crystals can be sold to vendors. <br />
<br />
- Sewer Catfish - These unappetizing fish have begun to appear in Cabilis. <br />
<br />
- Klok Foob - Will now accept a Catfish Croak Sandwich. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Changes for New Characters ** <br />
<br />
- Newbie Starting Locations - We've modified all locations where new characters start to make them a bit more convenient for the new player. They should all start very near their guild masters. <br />
<br />
- Nudging - New characters will be given a text message to encourage them to hand in their newbie note to their guild master. For new players, this is one of the key things to get them involved in gameplay, and one of the easiest to overlook. <br />
<br />
- Guild Masters - To help guide new characters, Guild Masters now take a more active role in helping out new recruits by directing them to some starting points for quests. <br />
<br />
- Quests - There are even more quests in the newbie zones, most of them revolving around the pests that seem to inhabit even the grandest cities. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Miscellaneous ** <br />
<br />
- We are working on an update to the Luclin player character model animations. This will not be a complete revamp of all the animations, but will address some of the most common concerns. However, in the mean time you may see some unusual animations, particularly when shorter PCs are running. <br />
<br />
<br />
** UI File Changes ** <br />
<br />
NOTE: In order to see the new Shared Bank slots, you will need to use the default bank window, or modify your custom bank window to include the new slots. <br />

<br />
It's been a fun month for the EverQuest team. With the recent completion of Veksar and the redesigns of Veeshan's Peak and the Plane of Hate receiving such a nice reaction from the folks that have visited those zones, it's a pleasure for us to be able to work on Droga and Nurga in the same way. <br />
<br />
Seeing so many new faces on the Test server recently has been a great. There's no doubt that we need as many eyes on the complicated changes we make to the game as we can get. We wanted to thank those of you that have taken the time to help us out by logging into the Test server recently; you've been of great assistance to us. <br />
<br />
And as players of EverQuest, one of the most enjoyable things about working on the game is the opportunity to add game features that we've always wanted to see. Many of them are listed below. We think you'll like them as much as we do. <br />
<br />
1) Droga and Nurga revamp coming to Legends. The mines of Nurga have been inhabited by crafty Goblins and stolid Burynai for many long years, digging and slaving away under the earth. It's time to shake them up! The redesign for these zones will be on the Legends server, Stormhammer, with our next update. The mines of Nurga will be a fun zone for characters of levels about 40 to 50. The Temple of Droga will accommodate characters around 50th to 60th level. Both zones will have some new events and quest, while retaining the distinct feel of zones. <br />
<br />
2) Veksar moving to all Live servers. Since the rediscovery of the lands of Kunark, there have been rumors springing from the ancient lore of the Iksar. Most of those rumors remain unfounded, as gaining access to the lore of the insular Iksar is no easy task. One of the most persistent legends is about a city that lies buried under the Lake of Ill Omen. That city was called Veksar, and it is up to you to discover the tale of its fate. <br />
<br />
3) Group experience bonus increasing dramatically. We've been testing this on the Test server for a few weeks, and some final tuning may be needed before it is released. The goal is to dramatically improve the experience gained by groups. The old group experience bonus ranged from 2% to 20% for a 6 person group. The new bonus will range from 20% to 80%. In addition, the 6th person added to a group will not count when experience is divided. This means that in a group of 5 the total experience is divided by 5 then distributed to each member. A group of 6 will also only have the total experience divided by 5 before it is distributed to each member. Due to this large increase in group experience, we will be reducing the experience modifier given in Planes of Power zones. Those zones had a dramatic experience bonus. These zone-specific experience changes are more than offset by the increased group bonus. <br />
<br />
4) Experience range increase for characters above 60th level. This is another change that we are testing and anticipate moving to the Live servers. It will open up many of the "old world" zones to players previously restricted to Planes of Power zones for experience gain. The range of NPCs that will be "blue" to a level 65 character has increased as far as level 50, with the "light blue" range extending to level 45. The best experience gains, however, are still going to be for fighting things around and above your level. This will open up areas for high level characters in groups and solo. <br />
<br />
5) Shared bank vault will be added. There are times when a player wants to trade items from one character to another. In the past making such a trade may have included dropping items on the ground or asking a friend to hold them for you. To make such trades more convenient, we are adding two shared bank slots to the interface. Any character on the same account and server can access these extra bank slots. No-Drop items can't be placed in these bank slots, and only one of any specific Lore item can exist in the shared bank at any time. <br />
<br />
6) Planes of Power access changes will be implemented. Planes of Power has provided us with valuable insight into the group and guild dynamics that are involved in large scale games. The way that we had expected guilds to advance through the story of Planes of Power has become a problem for some guilds as some members have fallen behind and found it difficult to catch up. Obviously this was not our intention. We want people to play with their friends and guild mates. <br />
<br />
To correct this issue, we will be allowing characters to enter the following Planes of Power zones by meeting a simple level requirement: <br />
<br />
Level 55 and over <br />
Plane of Storms <br />
Plane of Torment <br />
Plane of Valor <br />
Crypt of Decay <br />
<br />
Level 62 and over <br />
Bastion of Thunder <br />
Halls of Honor <br />
<br />
Characters that don't meet the level requirement may still enter these zones using the existing flags, and raids may still bring additional unflagged or lower level characters with them. All other planes with flag or story requirements for entry will still require those flags, and those flags can still be obtained as they always have. <br />
<br />
This will make the majority of Planes of Power zones available to characters over the minimum level, and will allow their guilds to travel and adventure together in the planes. We understand that those that have already earned the entry flags for these zones have put some effort into that accomplishment. We will be giving a reward to those that have done so, though you'll have to wait to see what that reward is. <br />
<br />
7) Enhanced Spell Descriptions added. Spell casters spend hours studying their trade. It takes great mental effort to understand and master the complicated arcana needed to cast even the simplest of spells. We have added new information to the spell descriptions displayed in game. An additional line of text explains what the spell does in general and includes information such as damage and duration when appropriate. <br />
<br />
8) A new method for memorizing spells. There was a day when casters only needed 32 pages in their spell books, with only 5 spells per page. These days spell books have 50 pages and 8 spells per page. Frankly, that's a lot of spells. We've come up with a new method for finding and memorizing spells that will make things easier for the overburdened spell caster. Right-clicking an empty spell gem will open a list of spell categories. Pointing your mouse at a category will display a list of spells. Selecting a spell from that list will make your character sit down, memorize the spell and stand back up. <br />
<br />
We know that many people are happy with the existing spellbook system. Rest assured that the spellbook isn't going anywhere. This new memorization system is an optional convenience for those who wish to try out a new method of managing their spells. The spellbook remains the only way to scribe new spells. <br />
<br />
9) Spell Favorites. Spell favorites are an easy way to memorize a full set of eight spells without the tedious book searching. Right-clicking on the spellbook icon in your spell window will open up the spell favorites menu. You will be able to save your current spell lineup as a favorite, delete a favorite or memorize all the spells in one of your already saved spell sets. As with the new spell context menus mentioned above, this will not replace the spellbook, it is meant to make memorizing large numbers of spells more convenient. <br />
<br />
10) Damage Over Time spell messages. Damage over Time (DoT) spells cause a certain amount of damage to the target at intervals. Currently, the caster of the spell is only told about the damage done the first time the spell does damage. All the other intervals were a mystery. What certainly sounds like an easy feature to add required a bit of work, but after the next update DoT spells will report their damage to the caster each time damage is done. <br />
<br />
If the new messages get to be too much for you, you can disable them in the Options window, much like any other type of damage reporting. <br />
<br />
11) Improvements to the game for new players. New players can be overwhelmed by all of the items they find in the game (heck, so do those of us who have been playing for a few years). To help reduce that confusion, we are adding a Tradeskill tag to items that are used as components in trade skill recipes. To help guide new characters, Guildmasters will take a more active role in helping out new recruits by directing them to some starting points for quests. There will be even more quests in the newbie zones, most of them revolving around the pests that seem to inhabit even the grandest cities. In addition, NPC merchants as well as other notable folks will have a title that will explain what their jobs are. For example, a baking supply merchant can be recognized as such by the description beneath his name. <br />
<br />
Also, as a heads up to players that have created their own user interfaces for EverQuest, these are the interface files that we expect to change next week. <br />

In the next month or so we will be implementing some changes designed to bring more fun back into the game.  Our experience with Planes of Power has taught us a lot about what we did right and what we should avoid in the future.  Building an online game like EverQuest offers us the unique opportunity to see how customers react to our ideas and to adjust them if needed.  We'll be taking the opportunity to put some of our experience to work to improve the play experience in EverQuest.<br />
<br />
<br />
1)      Partial Zone Revamps.<br />
<br />
These consist of improvements in the experience gain, monster density and/or item rewards in some of the older zones.  The goal is to improve the playability and reward for adventuring in these zones without completely remaking the contents of the zone.  We plan to do several of these, and we'll keep you updated as we move through these.  Currently we are working on a partial revamp of Veeshan's Peak.<br />
<br />
<br />
2)      Experience Range Adjustment.<br />
<br />
When Planes of Power was released and the level cap was raised from 60 to 65, the range of NPCs that characters in the new levels could kill to gain experience was smaller than it is for characters of lower levels.  This was done to encourage characters to fight more challenging enemies and allowed us to increase the experience reward given for that increased challenge.  Unfortunately, this has limited the locations available to 61+ level characters for experience gain, as well as making it more difficult for solo players to gain experience.<br />
<br />
This is something that we don't like, and it has had a negative affect on the "fun factor" involved in playing in Planes of Power.  To correct this, we will be increasing the level range of NPCs that will give 61+ level characters experience.  They will have approximately the same range of NPCs available to them as they did at level 60, and should be able to gain experience in some of their old hunting grounds, as well as in Planes of Power zones.<br />
<br />
3)      Planar Progression.<br />
<br />
Planes of Power has provided us with valuable insight into the group and guild dynamics that are involved in large scale games.  The way that we had expected guilds to advance through the story of Planes of Power has become a roadblock for some guilds, and some members have fallen behind and found it difficult to catch up.  Obviously this was not our intention.  We want players to play with their friends and guild mates.<br />
<br />
To correct this issue, we will be removing the flag requirements for entry into the following Planes of Power zones:<br />
<br />
Bastion of Thunder<br />
Plane of Tactics<br />
Halls of Honor<br />
Plane of Nightmare<br />
Plane of Storms<br />
Plane of Torment<br />
Plane of Valor<br />
Crypt of Decay<br />
<br />
This will make the majority of Planes of Power zones available to everyone, and should allow most guilds to travel and adventure together.  We understand that those that have already earned the entry flags for these zones have put some effort into that accomplishment.  We will be giving a reward to those that have done so,  though you'll have to wait to see what that reward is.<br />
<br />
<br />
4)      Items in the Planes of Power<br />
<br />
We will be looking at the quality of Planes of Power item rewards and improving them where appropriate.  Items for many of the lower tier gods will be upgraded and more rare items and NPCs will be added to the following zones as needed:<br />
<br />
Crypt of Decay<br />
Plane of Torment<br />
Halls of Honor<br />
Plane of Tactics<br />
Plane of Innovation<br />
Bastion of Thunder<br />
<br />
<br />
5)      Class Balance<br />
<br />
We are going to look at improving the damage capabilities of melee classes, as they've fallen behind their magic-using counterparts at the very high end of the game.  Some options being considered are:<br />
<br />
Improve melee damage-increasing disciplines <br />
Improve Planes of Power melee weapons <br />
 <br />
Additionally, we're looking at the concerns from players about their spells, and changing them where appropriate.  The goal here is to remove annoying issues with spells, not necessarily to increase caster power overall.<br />
<br />
We'll be back on Wednesday the 14th with another Upcoming and with a message from John Smedley, who will have some special news for EverQuest players.<br />

<br />
** Hate Plane ** <br />
<br />
The new Plane of Hate is now available on all servers! <br />
<br />
The Plane of Hate is an old favorite of many players, and we were careful to retain as much of its old charm as possible (and all of its old quests). At the same time we created all new geometry for the zone using our newer tools and newer design ideas. Old and new players should find this zone to be a lot of fun and a fair challenge. Remember, the price for the Fuligan Soulstone of Innoruuk has been cut in half. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Veksar ** <br />
<br />
Veksar opens on Stormhammer! <br />
<br />
Yes, the long-lost ancient city of the Iksar has been discovered. If you’re brave enough, foolish enough, and if you can hold your breath, you may be the right hero to explore Veksar. Good luck! <br />
<br />
<br />
** Changes for New Players ** <br />
<br />
- Maps for Newbie Zones for all Players - One of the biggest hurdles that a new player has to overcome is learning their way around. For those of you that may have started your first character in Neriak, you’ll know what that was like. In order to help out the new player, we’ve enabled the Map window to make it available to all players if they are in a "newbie” zone. <br />
<br />
- Context Tips - In order to provide helpful information at the time a player needs it, we have added several context tips. These tips will pop up when a player uses a certain feature or a specific event occurs. We hope this will help our new players to more easily understand the gameplay and controls for EverQuest. These tips may even be useful to long time players. However, if you wish, you can choose to turn off any specific tip, or turn off all of the tips using the check boxes in the Context Tips window. <br />
<br />
- Improved Help Information - The in game help files have been improved. They now contain much more information. Hopefully most questions you have about the game can be answered using help. <br />
<br />
- All New Characters now start with a weapon skill - In order to help the new player that might forget to train with their weapon before heading out to defeat their first enemy (and even for those of us that have been playing a while and still forget to do this), all new characters now start off with a skill of 5 in their primary weapon <br />
<br />
- Taunt no longer requires training - Similarly, Taunt now works without being trained. Characters still start out with a skill of 0, but the skill can increase with use. <br />
<br />
- Packet Loss Meter is now Off by default - Due to the fact that the packet loss meter is often confusing to new players, it will be off by default. You can toggle the packet loss meter using the F11 key. <br />
<br />
- New Message to prompt new players about the Help button - We’ve added a chat message that appears when a level 1 through 10 character logs in that tells them to click the "?" button on the Window Selection toolbar if they need help. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Spells ** <br />
<br />
- Divine Intervention Fix - Players have been reporting that Divine Intervention was not updating the hit points for the character every time when cast, causing characters to die even though the spell seemed to have saved them. We have been unable to reproduce the issue specifically, but we have made some changes that should fix the problem. Please use /bug with details of the incident if you continue to see this problem. <br />
<br />
- Bard Epic Animations - Bards will no longer play instrument animations when they have their epic equipped. No more stabbing yourselves in the head with your sword instead of playing a flute. <br />
<br />
- Healing Messages now include the name of the healer - In order to make it clearer who has healed you, we have changed the message that you receive when healed. It will now include the name of the character casting the healing spell: "Bob has healed you for 300 points of damage”. <br />
<br />
- Call of the Hero works in PoW - We have removed the restrictions to Call of the Hero in the Plane of Water. In this particular zone we don’t believe that the use of this spell needs to be restricted. <br />
<br />
- Fear Spell bug fix - Players have reported that when a player character was affected by a Fear spell cast by an NPC, they would see the character running away but the person affected would not actually flee. <br />
<br />
- Snare Line bug fix - Fixed an issue that was causing the Snare line of spells to fail on an NPC that is under the effects of a Fear spell. <br />
<br />
- Trickster’s Augmentation group only - We changed Trickster's Augmentation to be group only to prevent folks from using it to “grief” other players. <br />
<br />
- LD Enchanters no longer cast Mem Blur - Enchanters that go linkdead were sometimes casting Memory Blur and similar spells on their enemies. This could cause rather unpleasant results for his group or raid when the NPC suddenly had a fresh hate list. Linkdead enchanters will no longer cast Memory Blur spells. <br />
<br />
- Blizzard animation fix - Blizzard was causing a casting animation to go off with every wave, even if the caster was sitting. Now Blizzard works like most rain spells, and only triggers a casting animation when first cast. <br />
<br />
- Locked Spell Gem fix - We fixed a bug that was causing the use of a right-click item to refresh the spell gem in the first slot instantly, but if that spell had a long recast it would render it useless until the spell was forgotten and memorized again. <br />
<br />
- Mark of Kings upgrade - In order to make this spell more appealing then its lower level counterpart, Mark of Karn, we have: increased the duration from 3.5 to 4 minutes, reduced the casting time from 3 to 2 seconds, reduced the mana cost from 170 to 75 and made the spell slightly less resistible. <br />
<br />
- Gravel Rain can now be cured - With its very long duration (30 minutes) it was a bit difficult that this spell could not be removed before the duration was over. This is now a curse and can be cured. <br />
<br />
- Summoning a horse in bear form no longer causes you to lose the ability to cast spells for a while. <br />
<br />
- Rathe’s Son - The innate ability of the focused version of this pet is now less resistible. <br />
<br />
- Child of Bertoxxulous - This 65th level Necromancer pet has been given a boost. Its offense has been increased to be in-line with that of the Legacy of Zek, and it now has the ability to use a power that is essentially the same as the spell Banshee Aura. <br />
<br />
- Spirit Call - These pets were running away from enemies when at low health. Pets should be far more loyal and willing to risk themselves for their Shaman friends, so we’ve fixed it so that Shaman pets will no longer run away. <br />
<br />
- Vampiric Embrace - We’ve corrected a bug with this spell that would prevent the character from casting for a couple of seconds after the proc went off. <br />
<br />
- Stun Spells - The message on many stun-type spells have been changed to more accurately portray their effect on stun immune creatures. <br />
<br />
- Mana from Buffs - we have increased the maximum amount of mana that can be gained through the use of buff spells. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Items ** <br />
<br />
- Zoning and losing your buffs - There has been a long-standing problem that could cause all of the buffs to be stripped from a character if they zoned with fewer hit points than they had bonus hit points granted by items. For example, if your character had only 10 hit points left when zoning, and had an item that granted +15 hit points, all of your character’s buffs may have been stripped when you completed zoning. We have fixed this bug. You should now retain your buffs in this situation. <br />
<br />
- GM Baking Spoon - On Firiona Vie, the Grandmaster’s Baking Spoon was not no-drop. This allowed players to give out an unlimited number of 100% weight reduction bags. This obviously was not the intention for that item, so we have made the Grandmaster’s Baking Spoon no drop on Firiona Vie. <br />
<br />
- Wooden Medicine Totem - This item can now be equipped. It couldn’t before. <br />
<br />
- Adjutant Saber - We removed the secondary notation on the item, since it was only usable by Shadowknights and Paladins, who couldn’t use it in their secondary slot anyhow. <br />
<br />
- Cloak of the Dar Khura Hero - The effect on this item was listed in the database as the wrong effect type. The effect is now permanent. <br />
<br />
<br />
** NPCs ** <br />
<br />
- NPCs returning bags empty - NPCs that return items that they do not need were returning all containers empty, regardless of what was inside the container. NPCs that refuse unusable items will now also return bags with their contents intact. <br />
<br />
- NPCs returning multiple items - If a character gave an NPC multiples of the same item, the NPC would only give back one of them if he did not want them. We have fixed this so that now those items will be returned. Such items will be stacked on your cursor. Just click the item that is on your cursor into your inventory and the next one will appear on your cursor. Keep clicking them into your inventory until you have them all back. BE WARNED that any of these items that you have not returned to your inventory will be lost if you zone or go linkdead before you get them back into your inventory. <br />
<br />
- The Spirit of Rage - This undead gorilla is now flagged as undead. <br />
<br />
- Solusek Ro’s Guards - These guards will be much more attentive to their lord and will aid in his defense. <br />
<br />
- NPCs healing too much - We have corrected a bug that was causing some NPCs to regain hit points when they turned to run away. The affected NPCs will be of all sorts and in many zones. <br />
<br />
- Giant Yellow Jackets - The chance to find a thorax on the corpses of these creatures seemed too low, so we have increased it. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Zones ** <br />
<br />
- Veeshan’s Peak - We have changed this zone to make it more appealing, particularly for those playing with one or two groups. We have removed the restriction against using gate in this zone and modified the zone population. Over all, the zone will be better to play in. <br />
<br />
- Acrylia Caverns - We have fixed an issue with the first two seals that was causing the door to the 3rd seal to open without the 3rd seal spawning, and without the events being completed correctly. Now the door will only open under proper win conditions, and whenever the door opens the 3rd seal should be available. <br />
<br />
- Plane of Nightmare - We have changed the logic for entry to the Thelin Poxbourne event in Plane of Nightmare. When you talk to Thelin, he will now remember your raid and only allow those of the same raid into your maze. Only three groups maximum will be allowed through the portal into any one maze. If your group is not in a raid, he will allow three non-raided groups through into the same maze. If there are three non-raided groups in the maze and you try and get a fourth through, he will act as any other raid would and tell you that he has already let enough people in the maze. <br />
<br />
- Planes of Water and Fire - We have changed some of the spells used by the mini-bosses in these two zones. They should be a little easier to resist now. <br />
<br />
- Halls of Honor - We have removed a recently added summoning ability from NPCs. We have introduced a less intrusive method of preventing the ability to use area of effect abilities on huge groups of NPCs in the zone. <br />
<br />
- Bastion of Thunder - The tower bosses will now be dropping some loot every time (rather than sometimes not dropping any) like the other Planes of Power bosses <br />
<br />
<br />
** Quests ** <br />
<br />
- Added Honey Mush Bread to Cabilis Vendors - This is an item needed for a quest that was unavailable. <br />
<br />
- Officer’s Cloak - If you have combined your Officer's Cloak in the Security Satchel or you wish to upgrade to the new Officer's Cloak of Service, speak with Scout Derrin in Grimling Forest. <br />
<br />
-The Skull of Torment quest - This quest, in Kurn's Tower, should now work. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Alternate Advancement ** <br />
<br />
- Elemental Form - In order to make the Magician Elemental Form abilities a bit more useable, we’ve reduced the reuse time from 72 minutes to 15 minutes. <br />
<br />
- Alternate Advancement timers - We fixed a bug that allowed AA timers to be reset early. <br />
<br />
- Mass Group Buff - We have made this ability available to Beastlords. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Miscellaneous ** <br />
<br />
- Characters getting stuck in the world - We have fixed a bug that would cause a character to stay in game for extended periods of time after going linkdead. This bug was causing people to receive a 1018 error because their character was still in the world and could prevent them from logging back in for a long period of time. <br />
<br />
- Big Dwarves - Fixed a bug that was causing Dwarves that had their size increased twice to start to see the insides of their faces while attacking. This was making even the stoutest Dwarves a bit uncomfortable and self-conscious. <br />
<br />
- Tread water animation fix - We corrected a bug that would occasionally cause the treading water animation to stop animating. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Interface ** <br />
<br />
- Hit Point percentages display in windows - The Target window, Player window and Group window now display hit point percentages. This is something that many player created interfaces use and, considering the popularity of this feature, we’ve decided to add it to the default interface. In the Target and Group windows, the hit point percentages will disappear if the appropriate target/groupmate does not exist <br />
<br />
- /report - We updated the text message given when you use the /report feature to better reflect what text is actually attached to the report. <br />
<br />
- More Tips of the Day added - We’ve updated the Tips of the Day with more tips and cleaned up a few spelling errors with the existing tips. <br />
<br />
- Combining Stacks of items - Attempting to combine stacked items in a container will no longer work. The items must be separated first. This change will prevent items from being lost due to accidentally combining with them stacked. A dialogue will pop up, warning the player to separate the objects. <br />
<br />
- Bankers no longer take items - In order to help prevent people from losing items by giving them to their banker instead of putting them into their bank, players can no longer attempt to trade with bankers. A message will tell you to right-click the banker if you wish use your bank. <br />
<br />
- Guild Management - The Guild Management window will now take your setting for "show offline" into account when first displaying the window. The delimiter used in the file created when the "Dump" button is pressed has been changed to a [Tab] from a comma, as commas were causing confusion when used in the public and private notes. <br />
<br />
