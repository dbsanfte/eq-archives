<p align="left"><b><font size="4"><a name="Testament of Venear">Testament of
Venear</a></font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="2">I highly suggest this item to all
shaman, druids, and clerics. First off, head to Crow's (the bar). Outside by the
pool is an Erudite named Moodoro Finharn. If he is not out there, go inside
crows and you will see him. He walks in and out of there every so often. Give
him 2 gold, and he will give you 'Testament of Venear', which is a container,
closed, lore item, no drop. It has 2 slots and a combine button. Put it in your
inventory. Now give Moodoro 4 gold and he will give you one of four cards: a
'king', a 'queen', a 'beggar', or a 'jester'. You need the 'jester' card. If you
don't get the 'jester' card the first time, give him 4 gold again, and he will
give you another card. Repeat this process until you get the 'jester' card.
(This could take a while. It took 20 platinum before I got the card, but my
friend got it on his first try.) Give the 'jester' card back to Moodoro and he
will give you 'page 34 of a book'. The page is a lore item, no drop. (On some
servers, instead of the page, after giving him the 'jester' card, Moodoro will
give you 'Cinder Hornet Pollen'. Don't worry. It will work just like the
page.)Put the 'page 34 of a book'(or the 'Cinder Hornet Pollen') in the
'Testament of Venear' container, click done, and put it in your inventory. Then,
run over all the way up to Highpass Hold. Go to the inn, which has a dock over a
large pond. Jump into the pond, and nearby the dock, you will see a hole. Swim
through the hole. You will end up in a cave. Run through the cave until you come
to big room. Keep running through the large room until you see a tent in between
2 wood burning stoves on your right hand side. Dylenne Starshine is a sort of
corrupt Qeynos guard. He spawns under the tent exactly 8 hours since he was last
killed. There might be a line, so you could be waiting a very long time to kill
him. He is about level 16. He is not a caster, so he will only hit you.
Unfortunately, he has many smuggler friends around the big room that will help
him out if they see you killing him. They are level 19-21. Therefore, I highly
suggest bringing a druid along to harmony any nearby smugglers when you are
about to attack him. There is usually only one that needs to be harmonied, all
the other smugglers are too far away to see you kill him. Once you kill Dylenne,
which is not too hard, loot 'page 30 of a book' and 'Bayle List III'. Both items
are lore items, no drop. You might want to gate out or run somewhere else. If
the smugglers aggroed you, look to the left of the tent where Dylenne spawned
and look for a ramp. Run up it, past the smugglers, and jump out the hole in the
wall. You will take 42 damage, but land at the High Keep zone where the guards
will help you and you can zone into highkeep. Then take 'page 30 of a book' and
put it in the 'Testament of Venear' container. Make sure you have both pages (or
the page and the 'Cinder Hornet Pollen') in the book. Click combine and it will
become the 'Testament of Vanear'. The stats are Wisdom +10, Mana +10, and is
usable by all races and all classes. It is a lore item, no drop. It can only go
in the secondary hand slot. The quest is very easy. I have done it on both my
characters, my shaman and my druid. I was helped by my friend though. The time
it takes for Dylenne to spawn is well worth it. Good luck.<br>
