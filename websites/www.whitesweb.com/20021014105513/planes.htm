Instructions</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#808000" face="Verdana" size="2">Meet at the
appointed location. BE ON TIME. Casters, especially clerics, are highly
encouraged to bind themselves at the meeting ground, as it will make recovery
from a possible bad entry much faster.<br>
<br>
<br>
Someone may be asked to go to Neriak and buy the necessary Hate stones.
Guild-organized trips to Hate will be paid for using guild funds.<br>
<br>
<br>
Someone will be asked to bring a mule to the meeting ground to hold extra Hate
stones in store.<br>
<br>
<br>
B. Forming up for the Raid<br>
Groups will be announced and formed at the meeting ground. If there are not
sufficient wizards to have 1 per group, groups may be formed in 5's rather than
6's, to allow room to add a wizard for transport.<br>
<br>
<br>
If there are sufficient wizards for all groups, they will each be given one Hate
stone. If there are not, group leaders will be given Hate stones to give to the
wizard transporting them. No wizard should ever have more than 1 stone at a
time.<br>
<br>
<br>
Groups should buff with See Invis and Invisibility. You may or may not be
instructed to buff with other spells, depending on the selected entry method
(see C, below).<br>
<br>
<br>
If possible, EVERYONE will be given a modrod.<br>
<br>
<br>
Groups may be rearranged later once we are in Hate and setting up in the
&quot;Safe Spot&quot; position.<br>
<br>
C. Entering Hate and Setting Up<br>
Examine the following MAP that EQ Maps has made available. Used without
permission, so I hope they don't mind. Kudos, gents, it's a good one.<br>
<br>
<br>
When the wizard casts Alter Plane: Hate, the group will appear at #1 on the map,
hopefully all invisible, but there are creatures in Hate, some of which may be
wandering the area, that can See Invis. The &quot;safe spot&quot; in this zone
is just west of building &quot;R&quot; on the map.<br>
<br>
<br>
There are a number of commonly accepted &quot;Entry Methods&quot; for the Plane
of Hate:<br>
<br>
<br>
Sneak or Die - North Route<br>
<br>
Executing 3 right turns in a sort of clockwise spiral, you will emerge from the
building facing the east zone wall. Run HALF WAY up the wall. This is a critical
point. While travelling the walls of Hate, if you are too low you will aggro
mobs on the first floor. If you go too high you may aggro mobs on the second
floor. There are a number of gray-white lines that run along the angled walls of
Hate. Travelling on the gray-white line HALF WAY up the wall provides you the
best chances of reaching your destination without aggro.<br>
Proceed north along the east wall, to the northeast corner. Stop and count
slowly to 10 to see if you have any aggro. The pause is important - you may have
aggro from something with bad pathing and not know.<br>
Proceed west along the north wall, to the northwest corner. Stop and count
slowly to 10 to see if you have any aggro.<br>
Proceed south along the west wall, to just west of building 'Q'. Stop and count
slowly to 10 to see if you have any aggro. You can see the &quot;Safe Spot&quot;
ahead.<br>
ONLY ONCE YOU ARE VERY VERY CERTAIN, YOU HAVE NO AGGRO, should you proceed south
to the &quot;safe spot&quot;, just west of building 'R'.<br>
Camp out. Log on as an alt. Patiently await instructions to log back in.<br>
IF, AT ANY TIME, YOU ARE AGGRO'D BY ANY CREATURE WHILE TRAVELLING, YOU MUST DIE.
Die as quickly as you can. Do not train the mobs anywhere. Do not root or mez
them. Do not attempt to fight and survive. Just die. Die as quickly as you can.
Get an /loc before you die, though you should be easy to find, right on that
gray-white line, half way up that wall. Do not pass go, do not collect $200. It
is your solemn duty to give your life so that we might get a cleric and a rogue
safely camped out at the &quot;safe point&quot;, without training them and
getting them killed. You will not go forgotten into the eternal night - you will
be dragged and rezzed soon, and you will have your chance for revenge. So stand
tall, give a few /rude to the enemy and remind them you'll see them again in an
hour or two under very different circumstances, and die as quickly as you
possibly can. You are one of the brave. We salute you. Just die.<br>
If, at any point along your route you suspect you may have aggro, but haven't
yet been attacked (e.g. something is pounding on someone nearby), you may camp
out and back in, to clear aggro, and continue on your way. Once something
actually starts chasing you or hitting you, please refer to the above about
dying.<br>
<br>
The objective of this break-in strategy is to get as many people as possible,
undetected, to the &quot;safe spot&quot; in the zone. Once we succeed in getting
at least one rogue and one cleric to the &quot;safe spot&quot;, without aggro,
we know we can proceed with raiding - the rogue can sneak/hide to drag the
bodies to the cleric, who can rez them. The more people that arrive safely
there, the less rezzing and the shorter our startup time, but ultimately, no
matter how many attempts it takes, once we have committed people to Hate, we
must get a cleric and a rogue to the &quot;safe spot&quot;, and sitting there
unaggro'd. It is for this reason that you must be willing to die for the greater
good.<br>
<br>
The first FD-capable person to arrive in Hate should FD at the zone-in so they
can &quot;be our eyes&quot; at the zone-in point. The first FD-capable person to
arrive without aggro at the &quot;safe spot&quot;, should FD so they can
&quot;be our eyes&quot; at the &quot;safe spot&quot;. If you FD and believe you
may have aggro, use /q and return.<br>
<br>
Once we have a cleric and rogue in position and start rezzing people (half way
up the wall at the &quot;safe spot&quot;), DO NOT MOVE when you are rezzed. Use
/loot to get your gear back. Give the cleric who rezzed you the modrod you were
given earlier. Sit down and await instructions. Buff, invis, med. But DO NOT
MOVE. If someone moving gains aggro, the &quot;safe spot&quot; could be swarmed
and wiped out, sending us back to square one.<br>
<br>
Once everyone is rezzed, buffed, and regrouped, we begin pulling and killing.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sneak or Die - South Route<br>
<br>
Performed the same as Sneak or Die - North Route, except that after emerging
from the building and running half way up the east wall, you turn south rather
than north. You then travel south, then west, and then north, pausing in the
southeast and southwest corners of the zone.<br>
This route is shorter than the north route, but legend has it typically
generates more aggro. The author of this document has not attempted it, and
therefore cannot say with certainty.<br>
<br>
<br>
Zone and Fight<br>
<br>
If enough wizards are present (or if they can make repeat trips fast enough) it
may be possible to zone enough fully buffed and ready combat forces into Hate to
actually withstand the aggro they get on arriving.<br>
Groups should still be invisible on zoning in, excepting possibly the Main
Assist, in order to prevent softer targets, such as casters, from being killed
before the groups can get coordinated.<br>
On arrival, stay in the arrival building. DO NOT TOUCH THE WALLS. Remain in the
middle of the room, as crowded as that might be.<br>
Once any initial assault by the denizens of Hate has been repelled and looting
done, pulling commences from the adjacent buildings and is brought to the
zone-in building to be killed. One common practice is to begin clearing the
southern buildings, in order to provide safe passage along the south wall to the
&quot;safe spot&quot;, and to then move the raid force there, from which they
can continue their assault on the first floor.<br>
It is not necessary to camp out if you are gravity fluxxed in the zone-in
building (see D, below). This is an exception to the GFlux rule, as being
fluxxed in this building does not generate 2nd floor aggro.<br>
D. Executing the Raid (and the Enemy)<br>
Pay careful attention to instructions.<br>
<br>
<br>
Do NOT break mez. Enchanters will be our primary crowd control. A single broken
mez is a potential wipe-out.<br>
<br>
<br>
Unless specificially instructed to do so, the ONLY mob you may attempt to
&quot;tank-mez&quot; is a Spite Golem. (umezzable).<br>
<br>
<br>
Melees (especially plate-heads), be prepared to tank-mez if you are told too.<br>
<br>
<br>
No AE spells except enchanter stuns.<br>
<br>
<br>
No dots.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mages - be prepared to make LOTS of mod-rods at the first sign of trouble.<br>
<br>
<br>
Necros - be prepared to twitch LOTS.<br>
<br>
<br>
Wizards - be prepared to stun Loathing Liches repeatedly to prevent Gravity
Flux. Be prepared to stun Clerics of Innoruuk. Be prepared to use
Lures/Enticements on Spite Golems. Finish mobs that might run.<br>
<br>
<br>
Casters in general - avoid &quot;ping-pong&quot; by standing in melee range when
you expect you'll get aggro from your spell.<br>
<br>
<br>
Clerics - stay alert. Know where the modrods are going to be laid. Know who the
necros are who might twitch you. Stun the Clerics of Innoruuk if you think you
can, but do not risk your life doing so. Don't modrod yourself to death.<br>
<br>
<br>
Everyone - If you are Gravity Fluxxed (and do not resist the spell), ANNOUNCE
&quot;Fluxxed! DO NOT HEAL OR BUFF ME!&quot; and CAMP OUT IMMEDIATELY. Yes,
you're camping out in the middle of a fight, but a single person with 2nd floor
aggro is a potential wipe-out.<br>
<br>
<br>
If, at any point, you suspect you have been aggro'd by the 2nd floor (e.g.
harm-touched by a 2nd floor mob), ANNOUNCE &quot;2nd Floor aggro! DO NOT HEAL OR
BUFF ME!&quot;, and attempt to CAMP OUT IMMEDIATELY.<br>
<br>
<br>
If someone has made any of these announcements, leave them to their camping and
DO NOT heal or buff them. If their aggro transfers to you, you now have 2nd
floor aggro and are a potential wipe-out to us (and must now also announce and
camp).<br>
<br>
<br>
F. Concluding the Raid<br>
Once we either (a) complete the first floor, or (b) get &quot;EverHead&quot;
(that mind-numbing dizziness you get after 4+ hours in Hate), or (c) decide to
call it off for some reason, people will be TL'd or ported out, and clerics (and
others) will be re-imbursed for gem costs.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#808000" face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
Please do your best to familiarize yourself with these instructions as best as
you are able. You might even consider having a printed copy with you when we
gather at the start of raids, so you can follow along as we go and see how it
all falls into place. Careful adherence to this plan will play a crucial role in
our success or failure in raiding Hate.<br>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><font color="#808000">Introduction<br>
I have only one point to make here, and will be brief to stress it: learn the
rules of Fearplane. If you break a rule, YOU will cause the death of the entire
party. YOU can potentially turn a successful raid into a ten hour corpse
retrieval. YOU are not an asset, but a liability to the entire raid if you go
into Fear without learning the rules. Education can make you useful. Please take
the time to learn some key points in this guide. Not only will they save your
life, but they will drastically increase the chances at having a successful
raid. Having said that, we can proceed to the Plane and how to get in
successfully.<br>
<br>
To begin, you must be level 46 or higher to enter this zone, but you should
probably be a couple of bubbles into 46 before you come because you're going to
lose a lot of that XP, just accept that now. All of the MOBs in Fear can hit in
the 130+ range and range from levels in the high 40s to low 50s. They have an
abnormally high aggro radius and sometimes aggro from out of sight. For the most
part they drop class specific no drop armor, all of it no drop.<br>
<br>
The MOBs<br>
First, let's look at the MOBs that drop your armor.<br>
<br>
Amygdalan Knights - The Amygdalan Knight is a Shadowknight as the name implies.
They come complete with useless (although annoying) pets. They drop Umbral
Platemail armor (Shadowknight only). Their special skills are Harm Touch and
Mana Drain. These can usually be seen guarding the temples of Fright, Dread, and
Terror.<br>
<br>
Fetid Fiends (Male) - Resembles a huge zombie. They drop Valorium armor (Paladin
only). Their special skill is Disease.<br>
<br>
Gorgons - Gorgons resemble Harpies from Steamfont Mountains but with snakes
coming out of their heads. Gorgons drop Vermiculated armor (Druid only). Their
special skill is a 15 second stun which can get pretty nasty if there's a couple
of them on you so having a high magic resistance for these things is pretty
essential.<br>
<br>
Tentacle Tormentors - Tormentors resemble their weaker cousins from Unrest and
Najena. Chain stunning these guys is a good idea - it keeps them from using
their special skills. They drop Thorny Vine armor (Ranger only) as well as a
druid based belt. Their special skills are Lifetap, Throwback, and an area
affect debuf. Like the Glare Lords (see below), they're going to wipe out a lot
of your buffs which kind of sucks. Their knockback is quite nasty as well. If
you're fighting them with a camp against a zone wall, fight them with your backs
to the zone wall so that if you get knocked back, you don't go far and can
return to the fight quickly.<br>
<br>
Shiverbacks - Looks like a big ape from Cazic Thule but hits hard and fast. They
drop Shiverback armor (Monk only). They have no special skills.<br>
<br>
Frightfingers - Resembles a very small Reanimated Hand from Lower Guk or Unrest.
They drop Carmine armor (Wizard only). Their special skill is wizard spells,
which they cast a lot of.<br>
<br>
Boogeymen - Resembles a huge Ghoul. They drop Blighted armor (Necromancer only).
Their special skill is Ghoulroot.<br>
<br>
Spinechiller Spiders - Spiders are always fun. They drop Cryosilk armor (caster
based so it can be worn by wizards, enchanters, necromancers, and magicians).
Their special skill is a relatively tame cold based DoT spell that hits for 300
in 30 ticks.<br>
<br>
Phoboplasms - Often called &quot;jello&quot;, these resemble gelatinous cubes
from Splitpaw of old, Runnyeye, or the Qeynos Aqueducts. They are located in the
temple of Cazic Thule. Jello are loved by all because they can randomly drop any
piece of planar armor in the game, including armor for classes such as rogues,
bards, clerics, and warriors which is normally found in the Plane of Hate. There
are conflicting reports as to whether jello can truly drop ANY piece or just 1
piece from each class (i.e. Cleric Boots, Bard Bracer, Paladin Bracer, Warrior
Gauntlets, etc.). Their special skill is an area effect debuff, but whereas the
Glare Lords and Tentacle Tormentors debuff four buffs at a time, these only
debuff 1 buff at a time.<br>
<br>
The rest of these MOBs drop stuff other than class specific no drop armor.<br>
<br>
Amygdalan Warriors - The Amygdalan Warrior is just a Knight without the ability
to harm touch or make a pet. This means they still mana sink and because they're
warriors, they have a much higher magic resistance than most things in the zone.
They are extremely common in the zone and you'll be fighting an awful lot of
these. They drop a warrior only shield and whip. A lot of these are either found
wandering the zone or protecting the main temple of Cazic Thule.<br>
<br>
Fetid Fiends (Female) - Resembles a huge Tormented Dead (those female zombies
from Unrest). They drop a girdle that's quite good for Clerics. They have no
special skills.<br>
<br>
Turmoil Toads - Resemble small Froglock ghouls that can be found in Najena or
Lower Guk. Toads drop Turmoil Warts and a belt for Shamans. Their special skill
used to be Ghoulroot, but recently this has changed to Fear. This is why you
want to have SoW and Run OFF when attacking these guys. If they fear you and you
start to run away from them quickly, you could run far enough to start aggroing
other stuff.<br>
<br>
Glare Lords - Resembles a small version of an evil eye. Glare Lords are
enchanters, although I have never seen one charm anyone. They come with
Enchanter pets and drop wands for Mages and Enchanters. Their special skill is
an area effect debuff which is quite nasty. You could fight just one of these
things and find ten buffs are gone by the end of the fight.<br>
<br>
Scarelings - These little critters look like little imps from Solsek B Efreeti
area or Kindle in Solsek A. They are rogues and backstab for 400+. These are
VERY deadly and always the first target when one is in the camp. Another deadly
tactic of the Scareling is to teleport anyone to a random location (not too far
away) potentially starting a massive train leading to a total wipe out of the
raiding party. This is pretty much why they're given the highest priority.
They're also very hard to target and see because of their size. They also run
faster than SoW so kiting them is pretty hard. Repeat, Scarelings must die, and
die fast. Scarelings drop a rogue-only rapier. Their special skill is Backstab
and Teleport.<br>
<br>
Phantasms - Phantasms resemble spectres. The drop nothing of note and have no
special skills.<br>
<br>
Worry Wraiths - Looks like a giant will-o-wisp with a pet. If these are not
dispelled, they have a damage shield that can cause many people to go linkdead
from the amount of &quot;Billy was burned&quot; messaages. They drop nothing of
note and have no special skills.<br>
<br>
Samhains - Resembles a jack-o-lantern from the yard of Unrest or a scarecrow
from the farms in West Karana. These drop a ranger only axe. They have no
special skills.<br>
<br>
Nightmares - Looks like a big black horse but squeaks like a rusty swingset.
They drop a cloak which is pretty much crap on a stick. Their special skill is
Blind and have been known to Fear as well.<br>
<br>
Dracoliche - This looks like a huge Ashenbone Drake from Plane of Hate. If you
have never seen one of those, you have never seen anything that looks like a
Dracoliche. All I can say is that it looks like Vox or Nagafen died, decomposed,
then returned to life with just its bones. This is Cazic Thule’s number one
guardian. This bone dragon is a shadowknight with a pet. Attacking the
Dracoliche always aggros Cazic himself, and throughout the battle with Draco,
Cazic will be death-touching constantly, as well as sending in reinforcements.
He has a mean disease based DOT and dragon roar (area effect Fear). Leave it to
Verant to make a bone dragon, call it a liche, and NOT make it undead. That's
right, absolutely no undead attack spells work on Draco. After the Draco fight,
everyone will have to log out, wait 3 minutes and log back in unless other
specified by the raid leader. Draco spawns once a week (real time). It's special
skills are a DoT and dragon roar.<br>
<br>
Fright, Dread, and Terror - These are Cazic Thule’s little buddies that have
temples located around the zone. They are large versions of the three golems
from Cazic Thule. Fighting any one of these will also aggro Cazic. They drop
nothing but some spare change. Their special skill is usually Blind.<br>
<br>
Cazic Thule - Cazic is a God. Cazic is a vengeful God. Cazic does not like
people. Cazic does not like you. In general, he is a level 55 MOB that has
several irritating quirks. First, he hits for 400 and double attacks. Second, he
uses gravity flux like it is going out of style. Every time you are fluxed, it
removes one buff (put JBoots in top buff slot and reactivate after every flux).
Third, Cazic has pets. Not a typo, plural pets, and they are fairly irritating,
although nothing to lose sleep over. His special skills are Gravity Flux, phat
melee skillz, and debuffing mojo.<br>
<br>
Last, but not lEast, the most fearsome of all of the enemies in Fearplane...<br>
<br>
Someone who does not follow the Fearplane rules - This enemy is in your ranks.
He could even be grouped with you. This enemy is fearsome because of its ability
to kill 50+ people within 3 minutes. Their special skills are Train Making.<br>
<br>
Raid Requirements<br>
First off, the raid should never exceed 7 full groups. The lag in a fully
populated fearplane is incredible, and increases exponentially with over 42
people. If there are more people that want to go, there is ample opportunity for
them to support the troops outside the portal.<br>
<br>
Tanks (and a lot of them) - Tanks in the raid need to get out their old armor
class gear and dust it off. On the initial attempt, armor class is key. MOBs in
there hit for 130+, as stated previously, and the more hits you can take, the
longer you can stay alive to support the casters.<br>
<br>
Monks (at lEast two) - You need to have monks in at the zone in point or you're
never going to break this place. Two monks feigned on either side of the zone in
portal will be able to relay information back to the raid on when the safest
time is to zone in. If you can't get monks to do it, the onus will fall on
necros to do the job.<br>
<br>
Clerics - Each group going in really needs to have at lEast one cleric. Druids
and Shamans do not substitute in this instance. They will be very occupied in
other capacities inside such as charming and blasting. You need a devoted healer
that has only one objective: Keep everyone alive as long as possible. Finding
clerics for fear raids is rough, but you really have to make it a major
priority. Raids have survived with<br>
one cleric, but not for long.<br>
<br>
Druids and Shamans - Druids are essential for the raiding party. They can charm
animal MOBs that enter the camp without invitation, turning a foe into a nice
level 50 pet. Shamans can Togor MOBs and drastically reduce the amount of damage
dealt by them, as well as Malosi them to allow the casters to work more
effectively.<br>
<br>
Necromancers - Necros perform a dual role in a break. First of all, the break
involves having some key positions occupied by characters that are feigned;
Second, necros can charm the undead MOBs that enter the camp without warning,
again turning a foe into a very nice pet.<br>
<br>
Enchanters - Enchaters are the king of the debuffs, and this just may tip the
scales in your favor, allowing you to eliminate a few MOBs. They can also
mezmerize MOBs that enter the camp that cannot be charmed by either necros or
druids (ie. Scarelings and Amys). Clarity may also make the difference by
allowing that one extra blast, or that one extra heal. Some battles last upwards
of 10 minutes, and clarity is very effective in these circumstances.<br>
<br>
Magicians - Every raid needs a magician. After the initial rush, the melee types
won't have gear any more. They will need many things summoned including food,
water and weapons. The mage is a key component of the raid.<br>
<br>
Preparation<br>
1. All tanks need to be bound in Ogguk at the entrance. If the raid has rangers,
the rangers can spirit of wolf the people that arrive in Ogguk after they are
killed inside. If there are no rangers on the raid (although highly unlikely),
at lEast one druid or shaman needs to bind in Ogguk also to SoW the newly dead
troops to get past the bouncers outside. Also, someone that can cast ultravision
or infravision is needed, as Feerott is a dark place already, and the humans and
erudites that need to get back to the portal cant see anything at all.<br>
<br>
2. All casters that can bind, do so by the rock right outside of the portal.
That area is void of wandering skeletons that always seem to show up right when
you respawn back outside.<br>
<br>
3. Cyndereela: She is the necro that guards the portal into Fear. Ideally, a
group of people may be camping her for experience. If not, designate a few
people to kill her when she spawns. She is dangerous only because she can see
invisible, and will attack people zoning in, thereby rendering them visible.
Being visible when entering the Plane of Fear = BAD.<br>
<br>
4. Buffs: Every party must be composed of tanks and at lEast one cleric, and
ideally, one druid. On the initial rush, the buffs are as follows:<br>
<br>
<br>
Tanks: Clerical Reso/Shield/Symbol, Shamanic Talismans, Stamina, Levitate (or
Dead Man Floating), See Invis, and finally Invis. Some people will tell you
Superior Camo is just as effective as Invis but many people just don't believe
it. Strength and Agility are also nice, as is Dexterity for tanks with weapons
that proc.<br>
Priests/Casters: All of the above buffs except strength and dexterity. They can
get clarity instead.<br>
This is where some of the extra people can come in to the picture. If there are
more than 42 people, the extra people can stand outside the portal and hold gems
for symbols and shield skin, food and water, etc. for the troops that will be
back shortly naked. Extra people can also be buffers. All of the buffs take time
and mana away from the people going inside. Extra people outside to aid in the
buffing can be very helpful.<br>
<br>
5. Feign Death: At lEast 2 people are going to need to get inside and feign
death in 2 key locations. The first person will go inside and feign death right
at the portal. This person is responsible for letting the people on the outside
know when the portal area is clear of wandering MOBs. When the portal area is
clear, and there is a safe route to the West camp, the second person will enter
and proceed to the West camp and feign there. This person serves a dual purpose.
First, they notify the raiders when the camp is clear. Second, they serve as a
beacon to let the raiders know where to go upon entering the Plane. Therefore
the second person who feigns must know exactly where the camp needs to be
established.<br>
<br>
6. The Gathering: When everyone is buffed and the two inside are in place
safely, everyone must gather in front of the portal and await the charge
command. The raid leader must designate the order of the groups to enter, and
groups will enter 10 seconds apart. At this point, it is very important to be
camouflaged at all times as the charge command can come at any time.<br>
<br>
7. The assist hotkey: The raid leader will announce who the main and secondary
tanks are. You may have been in situations before when you said to yourself
&quot;I don’t need to make an assist key, I can see what they are attacking
and hit it.&quot; This is not one of those times. You MUST make your assist
hotkey for the tanks. If you don’t know how to make a hotkey, for the love of
Mithanial Marr, ask someone.<br>
<br>
The First Rush<br>
1. YOU WILL DIE!! This point cannot be stressed enough. Do not think that by
using some sneaky tactic or superior knowledge you can survive. This mentality
only hurts the group and causes the raid to fail. Go in there KNOWING that you
are about to emerge naked at your bind point. That being said, go in there
DETERMINED to live as long as possible and kill as much as you can.<br>
<br>
2. When the people inside give the go-ahead, you must act fast. Group 1 (ideally
the strongest group) zones into fear, takes a 90 degree turn left, runs down the
hill to the wall where the person is feigned. After group 1, group 2 goes in 10
seconds later and heads to the camp, repeat the process with all groups. This is
where the raid can succeed or fail. The first minute can determine the success
of the raid, as the two most important rules apply here. They are:<br>
<br>
A. If you are attacked outside of camp, STAND AND DIE!!! In case someone missed
that, let me rephrase it. STOP MOVING, DO NOT RUN TO CAMP, DO NOT RUN AWAY FROM
CAMP, DO NOT RUN ANYWHERE!!! If ONE single person disregards this rule, the raid
is a failure. I am not being overly dramatic, this is fact. If you run, two
things can happen. If you run TO the camp, you bring a nice train of MOBs with
you. Because of the increased aggro range, you WILL bring a train. When this
happens, everyone will die, including you. You might even lose your corpse. For
this reason, it is in YOUR best interest to stand and die, thereby increasing
the chances of the success of the raid. If you run AWAY from camp, a phenomenon
called chain-aggro happens and MOBs crawl out from under rocks and behind trees
and get all stirred up, resulting in a mass of wandering MOBs. This will also
get everyone killed. To reiterate, DO NOT RUN ANYWHERE - STAND AND DIE. If it
makes you feel better, turn away from the computer while you die.<br>
<br>
B. Second cardinal rule - STAY TOGETHER IN CAMP. Do not wander even 5 steps away
from everyone else. You need to get into a tight little ball with your friends.
I don’t care if they smell.<br>
<br>
3. At this time, hopefully everyone has followed the above rules, and everyone
is huddled in the camp, waiting for the onslaught. When the first wanderer comes
by, it will aggro, and can aggro from near the portal. If you can see it, it
could be in camp within 10 seconds. If you cant see it, it can be in camp in
10.6 seconds. When the first MOB enters the camp, the main tank will acquire the
target, attack, and call for assist. Everyone attack the same MOB. EVERYONE.
Blasters blast, tanks tank, clerics heal, shamans togor and malosi, enchanters
tashani.<br>
<br>
4. ADDs: If you are killing a MOB and see another come into the camp, shout ADD
to ensure that everyone knows there are more MOBs. If the tank then chooses a
new target, he will shout and you have to assist again to acquire the new
target. For instance, if you are fighting a Shiverback, and a Scareling wanders
into camp, the main tank will most likely switch to the Scareling, unless the
ape is almost dead. The main tank will decide what the proper target is, and you
need to follow the lead tank. Do not attempt to kite adds at this point.<br>
<br>
5. Teleports: As mentioned earlier, Scarelings can teleport you away from the
camp. If this happens, regain you bearings, get the camp in sight, and then look
around. Make 110% sure you have not aggroed any more MOBs. If you have been
aggroed, STAND AND DIE. Do not run back to camp, as this will result in another
train.<br>
<br>
6. Death: Eventually the clerics will run out of mana. The blasters will be out
also. The tanks will start dropping one by one. Fight to the death. Every MOB
killed on the initial break is a huge accomplishment. If you can get 4-5 MOBs
dead on the first rush, consider yourself in. Might take a few more deaths, but
you can get in. Another tactic that is also popular is to make sure you have two
groups fighting at your first break camp with an evac druid in each group. You
fight off as much stuff as you can until you know it can't go much further, then
evac. This way you save the groups without having to do CR. Then you just buff
up again outside, re-enter the gate (this time with less MOBs at the entrance)
and repeat the cycle, evacing again if necessary.<br>
<br>
Subsequent Rushes<br>
1. So you died. You land in either Ogguk or right outside the portal. If you
land in Ogguk, get a SoW and get back to the portal. DO NOT ZONE IN. Before
training the spectres to the portal, might be a nifty idea to be sure there and
people there to derail the train.<br>
<br>
2. Get summoned: Get the mage to start summoning swords and food and water.
About 5 food and water per person is fine, and either sword or modulating rod
for a weapon. Sit down and start getting buffs together for the second try.<br>
<br>
3. Basically the same as the initial rush, when called in, proceed in an orderly
fashion to the camp and get in a ball. Again, if you are attacked on the way,
STAND AND DIE.<br>
<br>
4. Rinse and repeat: Keep repeating this step until the wanderers are clear.
Conflicting reports, but I think there are 12 wanderers that need to be
dispatched.<br>
<br>
Establishing the West Camp<br>
Not really much to be said here, except that you must still follow the main 2
rules. This is not a time for exploration. You have killed the wanderers in the
area, and your camp is relatively safe. If you wander, you WILL train, and trust
me, there are still enough MOBs in the zone to kill every level 46 - 50 person
on the server at once. Wanders basically consist of scarelings, shiverbacks,
fetid fiends, spinechiller spiders, worry wraiths, and turmoil toads. The
scarelings and undead MOBs can see invis and the scarelings have the largest
aggro range.<br>
<br>
There are some people that will say a better camp area is the North Wall near
the North West corner of the zone. It's a great idea in theory and it has its
advantages but a lot of down sides as well. On the good side, if you can get
people to the North wall, it's a safer spot, with no roamers most of the time.
The down side is that you have to run through an entirely spawned zone to get
there, which kind of sucks. Keep in mind that some of the stuff you're running
through can't see through invis (like Tentacle Tormentors) but once something
else sees you, you're toast. There is a high chance you will run into something
else. There's also a theory that says people could camp out there in an empty
zone and come back the next day when everything is spawned. That's a nice idea,
but if you log on the next day and the clerics die during your raid, who's going
to res the people? Now you're going to have to get somebody to the North wall
from the gate (which is probably not clear) and you won't have a choice in the
matter.<br>
<br>
Yes, the West Wall isn't the easiest, but it's generally considered the best for
CR and if you've ever sat through a ten hour CR session in fear, you know how
important it is to make the corpses easily accessible.<br>
<br>
Once the initial camp has been set up and you have some breathing space to work
with, using Snare and Fear on MOBs can save people a lot of strife.<br>
<br>
Cazic Thule Says Your Name<br>
When you see this, it means that Cazic Thule is kind of annoyed with the entire
concept of people &quot;raiding&quot; his plane, and he decided to take matters
into his own hands. If the person who gets the death touch was in the West camp
at that time, Cazic Thule now is aggro on the entire camp and will begin to
death touch someone every 30 seconds or so. When this happens, you will have to
do one of two things:<br>
<br>
If you are fighting something, kill it and kill it fast. After that, watch for
the raid leader to call the CAMP command. When you see this, sit and camp, and
pray you save your ass. Leave the game for 3 minutes, then return to the game.
This will clear the Cazic aggro on the party. If you are not fighting, just look
for the camp command. Do not camp until requested to do so. The leader makes
that decision, and you will look like a cowardly fool if you camp out with no
command only to find that the person that caught the death touch was not in the
camp. Save some embarrassment and wait for the signal.<br>
<br>
Clearing the Zone<br>
Basically this just consists of the pull team going out and grabbing MOBs and
dragging them back to the camp for a slaughter. Do not go after MOBs, let them
come to you. If you see the puller run by with a huge train, do not attack the
train. Let the pull team pick them off of the train one-by-one and take them to
the camp. I repeat, do NOT attack the train.<br>
<br>
General Strategy on Pulling In Fear<br>
As a puller, have a lot of magic resistance. The more the better but you'll have
pretty good luck pulling with about 75 MR. If you can get an enchanter in your
group to cast Group Resist Magic, that would be best. The main reason why this
is important is because of the stuns from Gorgons, harm touches from Knights,
and fears from Toads while pulling. All of these things can kill you fast if
you're not paying attention.<br>
<br>
Always prepare to die a lot. Just expect it to happen. If you can't take a death
with a ressurection, just don't volunteer to pull. Especially if you've not been
up there much. Your XP will fall down because most likely your pulling group
won't be getting XP, just learn to live with it.<br>
<br>
If you think you have SUPER aggro on you and you better quit out while feigned,
do it. Trust me, any experienced group of people won't complain about the 3
minutes that they have to wait while you're gone. When you feign pull and split
off widely wandering MOBs, they might wander back near other MOBs, and when you
stand up, they will ALL come. In the worst case, a MOB may be near CT and when
you stand up you will get death touched. So reiterating again, if you think you
are in big trouble, play it safe and /q while feigned. There's no reason to take
such a large risk.<br>
<br>
If you have a monk in the group that is 51+ tell him/her to pull instead of
anyone lower because stonestance will save sooooo many deaths that it's not even
funny. A monk that is 50- will die so many more times. The moments that
stonestance count the most is when your feign fails and you have 5 boogeys
hitting you while you're standing there hoping for another chance to feign.<br>
<br>
Glare lords and Worry Wraiths are casters and they can be a complete pain in the
butt. Sometimes you don't even know that they're casting so you feign at the
wrong time and they will break your feign and you will die. That's a fact of
life. One way to help prevent this from happening is to always turn around and
look back at the MOBs before you feign to the ground, so that you can sorta get
a visual on what's going to happen. If you see a glare lord chasing you and then
it suddenly stops, that means it's casting something so don't feign until you
get hit with a spell.<br>
<br>
Although it's nice to turn off spell effects when in the planes to reduce lag,
as a puller DON'T do that. You will have problems pulling caster MOBs and you
won't be able to have good judgement when feigning. Keep it on the
&quot;low&quot; setting.<br>
<br>
Don't ever let anyone in your group cast a spell on you no matter what unless
you specifically tell them when and what spell. If you are feigned and someone
casts a beneficial spell on you, it's fine. If you stand up with aggro and
someone in the group casts a spell on you (heal, buff, see invis), you are all
in deep trouble. IF you see this happen, figure out who casted on you FAST and
tell them to run AWAY from the group and start camping out. If he is lucky he
will camp out in time and live. If that person stays with the group, prepare to
fight a train of MOBs. If he is unlucky a horde of MOBs will kill him, but at
lEast 30 people don't have to die.<br>
<br>
If you ever fight Amy Knights, sometimes you will have to check loot after they
are dead and log out, because they aggro Cazic himself about half the time.<br>
<br>
If Cazic is not up, the zone is much easier to pull. If you ever aggro
Dracoliche when you didn't want to, quit out. He's not fun to toy with.<br>
<br>
Always kill all the wanderers that you can see before you move the party
anywhere. Sometimes it pays a lot to just stand in an open area and wait a
couple minutes to see if wanderers come by. If they don't, then you can think
about moving the party up a little to make the pulls easier on yourself.<br>
<br>
Don't ever get too confident and move the group too quickly. You will be
surprised by how many wanderers come by. If your group is doing so well that it
seems they want more MOBs than you can pull, try bringing 2 or 3 at a time. If
you have good enchanters it shouldn't be a big problem.<br>
<br>
Never ever train your group. Ressing you is 30 times faster than ressing
everyone. Don't ever go near your group standing unless you are absolutely
positive that you have no aggro. For example if you just got back from quitting
out, it's probably safe to go back, get grouped again and get a couple buffs you
might be missing. Otherwise don't do it because it's just risky and there's no
reason to. Stay feigned for most of your time, it's just a safer bet.<br>
<br>
Always chain pull if possible. It's safer and faster than trying to split MOBs.
Anyone who has pulled the scareling tower will agree with me here.<br>
<br>
After you have pulled something, you need to get about halfway to the party and
hit the MOB a couple times while you test to see what else you have aggroed. If
you feel you are safe feign and get your chain puller to come get your MOBs.<br>
<br>
Use third person views often to check what stuff is aggro on you while you're
feigned BEFORE you tell your chainer to come get them.<br>
<br>
When you are the main puller, group with the event leader, an enchanter and a
cleric to heal. The enchanter does not have to be the main enchanter because
that would give the cleric too much work to do.<br>
<br>
Always tell your event leader that you are looking for a pull before you go out
for more, and don't ever ever pull anything just because someone requests it in
a tell. Don't play favoritism, always do what you feel is most comfortable. In
fact, people that keep shouting in /shout and /ooc to pull certain MOBs should
be told to STFU.<br>
<br>
If you are the puller or chain puller, make sure you have something that gives
you infra or ultra vision, like the ring from the High Priest is Sol A.
Something that does not poof when you camp or /q. The ring (Glowing Stone Band)
is not that hard to get, and is campable in one evening.<br>
<br>
MOB Pull Order in Fear<br>
This assumes you are breaking from the South West corner.<br>
<br>
Once everyone is rezzed/buffed/ready, stay there for about 15-30 minutes killing
any wanderers that come nearby. Once you feel that most of the wanderers have
died, start looking around the portal area for any wanderers. Bring those back
to the group and kill them.<br>
<br>
Please remember that if at any time you see wanderers on the way to pull, bring
those back to the group to kill off first before you go out again.<br>
<br>
Then pull the fetid fiend house to the North. After that is cleared, go a little
more North to find any other wanderers.<br>
<br>
Then pull to the East along the South wall. You will see a couple towers and a
house. In these, there are samhains, boogeymen, and scarelings. These are
statics spawns along with a bunch of wanderers that will be there. You should
probably chain pull this area, but make sure that when you feign you are still
kinda far from the group, because otherwise they might see your group and train.<br>
<br>
Once this area is done, go past the portal area and pull the tentacle terrors.
After the tentacle terrors are dead and everyone is buffed, check for any last
wanderers around. If all wanderers seem to be dead, pull Dracoliche and kill
him.<br>
<br>
Then go all the way up North and pull any last wanderers you see, but of course
don't go past the fire wall.<br>
<br>
Then go East along the South wall again and pull wanderers, until you can see
the gorgon statue with gorgons flying all around it. Once you are free from
wanderers, pull that gorgon area. Be careful to not run too close to the hills
in the middle of the zone that Fright, Dread, and Terror are on. They will aggro
if you go too close and they will cause Cazic to begin to death touching.<br>
<br>
Once the gorgons are dead, pull the frightfinger house. Once those are dead,
check for any last wanderers again.<br>
<br>
Move the group East a little bit. Pull Dread and Terror to the group one hill at
a time. Each of these will have 2 Amy knights or warriors with them.<br>
<br>
After those are dead, pull Fright and his 2 henchmen. Be careful about aggroing
Cazic on this pull. Try to time the grab when Cazic is farther away.<br>
<br>
Once that is done, another tougher part of the game comes into play because it
is now time to pull the temple. Move your entire group to the NorthWest corner
and situate them there. Then get your best necro and have him go to the portal.
Have him get close to the temple and then cast harmshield on himself. While he
is harmshielded, get him to run into the temple and aggro every MOB (hopefully
at lEast all the knights) and get harmtouched. His harmshield should eat all the
harmtouches and then have him (with SOW) run to the South wall with the MOBs on
his tail. Once he's there, get him to gate out ASAP.<br>
<br>
Hopefully he will live and the MOBs will be scattered. Once the MOBs start going
back, run in there and aggro some of the amy's and kite them around the big hill
that the portal is sitting on. Make wide circles. While you are kiting in
circles, get another melee in your group, hopefully a monk, aggro a couple and
bring them back to the group in the NW corner. Kill these while you are still
kiting the Amy's on you. When those are dead, get the other monk to come get
some more MOBs off of you until all the MOBs aggro on you are dead.<br>
<br>
Once those that are aggro are dead, run back to the temple and pull some more.
By this time if you did it right, none of the knights should have harm touches
left and it should be a piece of cake. Pull them to the portal hill again and
kite them around in circles like you were before. Once all the temple MOBs are
dead, you are almost done.<br>
<br>
Now you need to ask your friendly ranger what MOBs are still up, and pull them
to the group until they are all dead. Watch out for Cazic's aggro and don't get
too close to him to get a MOB.<br>
<br>
Once you have pulled as many MOBs as you possible can without aggroing Cazic
himself, get everyone to buff up. Once everyone is buffed, designate someone as
the death touch sacrifice (usually a gnome) and rush Cazic.<br>
<br>
When your sacrifice gets there, he will be death touched first thing. If Cazic
doesn't seem to be awake, have him cast on Cazic. That'll get his attention
fast. Once the death touch has passed, kill Cazic.<br>
<br>
When Cazic is aggro, MOBs that are anywhere nearby will come after you. So if
you haven't killed some MOBs yet, prepare to mez the train that comes when you
are killing Cazic. Sometimes you'll have 1 glare lord that's still alive. No big
deal when this happens, just kill CT and get a chanter to mez the glare.<br>
<br>
Fighting Dracoliche<br>
Big skeletal dragon, enough said. Before the Draco pull, you need to buff up as
usual and throw on some sv disease and magic buffs. Kill the dragon, you
probably have done something like this before. After the dragon is dead, wait
for the CAMP command. When you see it, camp and return in however many minutes
the leader specifies. Do not check the Draco for loot. Let the leader of the
raid take care of this. The leader is experienced, knows what the Draco drops,
can tell at a quick glance what is NO DROP and what is not, can loot the
droppable items, and handle the situation. When you have safely killed the Draco,
please do me a favor - Do not shout WHAT WAS THE LOOT?? and WHAT DID HE HAVE???
It really annoys everyone and you will find out soon enough. It is considerate
to wait for everyone to be back into the Plane before you announce the loot.<br>
<br>
Draco's special skills are an area effect Fear which is quite nasty. He also has
an area effect DoT called Rotting Flesh that is poison based. Having a 100%
poison resist will pretty much help you against this roar. He can also cast
other necro spells like Shock of Poison. Make sure you CAMP after fighting Draco,
he aggros Cazic Thule and Cazic will be death touching people throughout the
fight as a result.<br>
<br>
Any pet class should have a pet summoned and buffed for fighting this dragon.<br>
<br>
Fighting Cazic Thule<br>
To prepare, cancel all the buffs you have on and, when given the signal, place 4
disposable buffs (or &quot;crap buffs&quot;) on yourself. My personal preference
is to use J-Boots first, as you can quickly reactivate them after they are
debuffed. At the command, begin normal buffs. Put Dead Man Floating or Levitate
on as the final buff, as this negates his Gravity Flux damage. Wait for the
call, and charge him and kill him. Not really much to it. Like dragons, casters
want to wait until the halfway mark to begin casting on Cazic Thule while the
tanks work it down for the first half. Cazic isn't very magic resistant, so
casters are going to do really well here. He hits for 400 sometimes so he's a
pretty rough melee MOB. He also death touches people every 30 seconds. If you
have a lot of magic resistance, they're a slim chance you could survive this,
but it's not bloody likely. Tanks are essential. They MUST interrupt him using
bash, stun, etc. Casters, when not casting, have to stay out of melee range.
Healers are an absolute must considering how much damage Cazic will do to the
tanks and how long they have to fight him. He has the ability to dispell buffs
as well, but the worst part of this is the MOBs in the zone running at you.
That's right. The moment he's attacked, he will summon everything left in the
zone at you. This is why you want to do Cazic last. You want to clear all the
MOBs in the zone that you can away before taking him on. There's a big trick to
doing Cazic though, and that's Fear. Cazic is extremely susceptible to Fear
spells. If you keep him Feared and just plow him with large scale DoTs and such,
you can't fail.<br>
<br>
Epilogue<br>
You have demolished the entire Plane of Fear. Give yourself a pat on the back.
Please congratulate the winners of the prizes. Even if you really wanted the
item, how would you like it if someone frowned when you won something? If all
went well, you can wait for respawns. The respawn cycle on MOBs in PoF is 13-14
hours with Cazic and Draco set to one week. If you want to farm the zone, head
back to the West camp and proceed to pull MOBs as they pop for the next week or
so until a patch. Or, for something a little more fun, wait until tomorrow and
do the entire thing again. It is much more rewarding to go into a place where
the odds are against you and overcome the odds, than to sit for hours and hours
arguing about loot and waiting for one poor MOB to spawn so 40 people can beat
the crap out of it. I hope this helps some people that want to go to Fear
understand what is going on there. I hope this takes some of the fear out of the
Plane of Fear and removes the panic factor which can ruin everyone's time, as
well as kill everyone.</font></font></p>

Instructions</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#808000">Groups recommended:<br>
Depending on strength and experience, I recommend 24 people, although less is possible. More makes it difficult since the number of key to access the different island is restrained.<br>
<br>
 Group 1:2 tanks, 1 monk, 1 shaman, 1 enchanter, 1 cleric&nbsp;<br>
 Group 2:2 tanks, 1 melee, 1 wizard, 1 enchanter, 1 cleric&nbsp;<br>
 Group 3:2 tanks, 1 melee/nuker, 1 shaman, 1 necromancer, 1 cleric&nbsp;<br>
 Group 4:2 tanks, 1 melee/nuker, 1 nuker, 1 necromancer, 1 cleric&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Notes: necromancers can be substituted with any casters if you got 3 groups and less. They are useful for summon corpse if you need to move people from island to island, but else a magician, shaman, druid, wizard can do the job, but magicians and necromancers will prove the best since they'll provide you with extra tanking power.<br>
<br>
Equipment needed:<br>
Cloudy Stones of Veeshan: cost from 200-250pp. Can be bought in Erudin at the library from Sornita Eltern. You will need one for each port the wizards will do.<br>
Coffins: cost around 180pp. You can buy them on first island in Plane of Sky, from Key Master. The ones he sells are the non stackable ones.<br>
Reagents for spells: varies. The point here is that you won't be going back down until your raid is finished, unless you die. And since we all don't wanna die, then bring everything with you.<br>
<br>
Recruiting:<br>
Plan in advance. Schedule on your appropriate server calendar. Sky raids are usually spread on 3 days, or 2 good days. It's not a zone visited very often, since xp gain is very slim and loot can sometimes be meager, but there's nothing worse than showing up and seeing that the zone is cleared.<br>
<br>
Prepare your groups in advance, and be sure to have back ups. You know that some people won't show up. And if you plan to clean the plane, be sure they are ready to stay for all days scheduled.<br>
<br>
The best place to form up is Greater Faydark. Bind all people there. In case of a wipe out, it will be easier to reorganize if everyone is at the same spot.<br>
<br>
WORDS OF CAUTION:<br>
<br>
The Sky inhabitants have a peculiar notion of aggro. Sirran will assist mobs that are fought next to him (you don't want that, Sirran hits for 2000). Also, all the efreeti will attack you if you either duel close to them or unintentionally cast a non player friendly spell on someone (ie, bards AoE damage on group, etc...). Same is said for quest hall on island, do not duel and be careful of AoE on island one.<br>
<br>
The Plane of Sky<br>
Note: All mobs in the plane of Sky have a chance to drop an item from the rare drop list. You can find the list here.<br>

Key Master<br>
He's a merchant. Sells Key of the Misplaced (to Azarack Island), Key of Swords (to Noble Dojorn Island), Key of Veeshan (to quest hall, not same as Veeshan's Key to last island), Jade Inlaid Coffins, Box of the Void and the 5 types of mana batteries<br>
<br>
  Sirran the Lunatic<br>
He spawns once the "a Thunder Spirit Princess" dies, on the kill spot. Won't attack unless you start chatting with him. Just hailing him is safe. Hand him one Lost Rabbit Foot to get the key of the misplaced (to Azarack Island). Hand him one Tiny Sword to get Key of Swords (to Noble Dojorn Island). He despawns in approximately 22 minutes.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Strategy: Once porting in, nothing is aggro so there is no break in Plane of Sky (woohoo!). The Thunder Spirits also have a pretty small aggro, and will not assist if pulled normally. Even though some are a couple of feet away from each other, they are easy to single pull. This island is usually done in 15 minutes and is trivial. The island will yield a total of 24 of each keys. Respawn time on island 1 is approximatively 6 hours.<br>
<br>
The Quest Hall<br>
Use the Key of Veeshan from Key Master on the right porter on first island to get to Quest Hall. Warning: Once into the quest hall, you cannot go back to the islands. You have to drop from islands and get ported again.<br>

always Breath of Gwan&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 This island will have different strategies depending on what is the goal. If you are there only for the monk epic, it is best to set the camp in the windmill as Gwan has a knockback proc and will throw people off the island. Simply hand the presence the scale from Eejag, tell Gwan you are ready and carefully walk him to the windmill. Neither the Blade Storms or Noble Dojorn will assist.<br>
<br>
If you want to kill Noble Dojorn. There are 2 main strategy. The first one is to use pathing to your advantage. If you aggro the Blade Storms, Dojorn will assist, and the other way around too (no matter where you stand on island). If a monk feign death on the Blade Storms and Dojorn, there is a chance that they will path to island 3 (Gorgalosk) before eventually coming back to island 2 (takes about 5 min). It is thus possible to split the mobs. The second and simplest way is to have 2 warriors tank the Blade Storms and have the rest of the raid kill Dojorn. The Blade Storms are mainly speedbumps and annoyance in killing Dojorn.<br>
<br>
The single teleport pad on the island will take you with key of the misplaced to Azarack Island. Respawn on the Presence is 2 hours, Dojorn is 7 days.<br>

<br>
This island usually goes pretty fast too since mobs easily aggro. Get all people buffed and invis before porting to island, and then, once ready either attack or wait to be attacked. There is one azarack not wandering, and killing him spawns the Protector of Sky. Island usually done in 15 minutes or so too. The island will yield anywhere from 13 to 31 keys. Usually is less than 24, be ready to use the summon corpse tactic. Bring lots of chanters to mez the extra azaracks and have nukers nuke the early ones hard cause they easily add up. Respawn on the island is about 8 hours.<br>

<br>
Since nothing is aggro, porting up is quite easy. Use long range spells to pull (get the mage to give your monks staff of runes (1 charge dispell) to easily pull the island). Kill all the roamers, then use a monk to split the 3 back static spawn (2 crystalline clouds, 1 watchful guard). To split the bosses, first bring the 3 of them on the left side of temple, then FD. Have someone keep hailing Gorgalosk to keep him there. Monk /q then pull the remaining 2 on right side of temple. Get someone to tag (2nd monk good). Kill the first boss (usually heart harpie). Then pull the one that has gone back in the temple. Then finally tell your hailer to bring Gorgalosk. This island will yield 21 keys. A little more corpse summoning, or a good point to quit day 1 and restart here on day 2. If you want to kill the shimmering meteors for Globes, do it after the bosses and inside the temple as the knockback spell is pretty bad. Respawn on island is about 8 hours.<br>

Sirran the Lunatic<br>
He spawns once the "Keepers of Souls" dies, approximately where Keepers of Souls dies. Won't attack unless you start chatting with him. Just hailing him is safe. Hand him one Bird Whistle to get the next key (to Spiroc Island).He despawns in approximately 20 minutes.&nbsp;<br>
  Ekim Nottap<br>
<br>
<br>
Split pattern is 1 Harvester becomes 2 Carriers and each Carrier becomes 1 Tamer. The best and easiest way to deal with this island is to stay on Gorgalosk island. Send one necro with harm shield or a cleric with DA to Pegasus island or a monk with good safe fall. It is possible to jump back down to island on a very precise spot. So the player aggros a pegasus/grifon, then jump down to Gorgalosk island. The initial pull is pretty easy. When it splits, have a high level chanter either Dictate or Rapture one of the Carriers. Kill the first split completely then deal with second split. Once the first split is killed, Ekim Nottap will spawn. You have 80 min to kill all spawns before Keeper of Souls spawn. This island will yield 28 keys. If the necro aggros more than one and jumps down with the mobs on Gorgalosk Island, the mobs will not path back to Pegasus Island. Instead, they will go in the temple in the middle of Gorgalosk island and wait there.<br>

<br>
Each low spiroc is tied to a Vanquisher. Killing the low spiroc without killing the Vanquisher makes the low spiroc respawn instantly. In the same fashion, killing the Guardian before killing all Vanquishers will keep the Guardian respawning all the time. And, killing the Spiroc Lord before killing the Spiroc Guardian will make the Spiroc Lord respawn instantly. It is thus possible to farm the Spiroc Lord for the drops and the rare quest items. This island will yield 24 keys. The intial pull will bring usually at least 2 triads of Spirocs (6 in all) so be ready for one intense fight.<br>

Hand him one Dull Dragon Scale to get the next key (to Sister (Drake) Island).He despawns in approximately 20 minutes. Telling him the phrase "Am I the wall" will make The Sister of the Spire spawn on Drake Island.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
This island will yield 24 keys. When you port up, there are 3 Bzzazzt up. They have very wide aggro and assist range, but do not see invis. Also, they will not attack if you stay behind the big gear thing in the ground. The left Bzzazzt will split like the pegasus in a 1-2-2 pattern (splits are Bazzazzts). The right one will split 1-3 into Bazzazzt. The middle one will give one Bazzazzt, that will give Bzzt, that will then give Bazzt Zzzt. This is the toughest part of Sky (beside the Hand of Veeshan). Best thing is to Dictate the left and right Bzzazzt and use them to fight the middle spawns. Respawn is approximately 12 hours.<br>

<br>
This island will yield app. 22 keys, maybe more. Warping is awful on this island. Similar to Gorgalosk island, use monk with dispell staff to pull, but expect the monk to die often as mobs have a bad tendency to warp. The sphinx have very small aggro and only the back one will cause the Sister to aggro. Be careful of pet aggro when fighting the sphinx, they will aggro the Sister. Sister can be farmed by leaving someone on Bee Island that hails Sirran and keep telling the key phrase. It is recommended to kill the undine spirits as they can drop Crowns of Elemental Mastery. Both the Hand and the Eye can be pulled to this island. Respawn on the island is 24 hours.<br>
