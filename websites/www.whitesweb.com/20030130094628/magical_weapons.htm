Walkthrough<br>
<br>
Step 1. Go to Kalatrina Plossen (while you are under lvl 9) and ask her how to
help the truthbearer. She gives you a note which you must take to Guard Alayle
in the Militia House in West Freeport. When you give him the note he is
immediately killed by the only guard in North Freeport, Krazen Loosh (The guy
from the bank..remember him?) Before he dies he shoves a tattered flier in your
hand.<br>
<br>
Step 2. Go to Kalatrina Plossen and give her the note...she tells you to talk to
the head of the coalition of Freeport Tradesfolk which is also in North
Freeport...that lady directs you to the owner of the forge...a little dwarf
named Groflah Steadirt.<br>
<br>
Step 3. Repeat step 1.<br>
<br>
Step 4. After you watch Alayle die for the second time =) Go to Groflah's Forge
in North Freeport and hand him your new tattered flier. He will get all nervous
and tell you to meet him at the Seafarer's Roost in East Freeport...the bar at
the docks.<br>
<br>
Step 5. You will have to wait a long time for him to pop, but he pops to your
left if your facing the bar. In the meantime...wait for a beggar named Tykar
Renklin to pop right next to the bar. When he does...and here is the
trick...HAIL HIM REPEATEDLY...this will keep in the zone long enougth to be
useful. While you keep hailing him buy a Drom's Champagne from the
bartender...it is a lore item so you have to do this one at a time. If you keep
hailing him he should stick around long enough for you to give him 4 of these
drinks. When you hand him the fourth...he gives you a blanket and tell you to
give it to the only prisoner in the jails under the Arena.<br>
<br>
Step 6. After Tykar pops, Groflah usually pops soon. When he is there...give him
back the tattered flier. Once you do, he will give you the necessary information
about the person who had the sword...the currently jailed (not dead like he
says) Ariska Zimel!! He will also fill in the information on your flier.<br>
<br>
Step 7. Go out and get a fire beetle eye and some rat ears...combine them in an
oven to make edible goo, then combine some snake scales a water flask and a
bottle in a brew barrel and you should get some bog juice (both may take several
tries of you have no skill like I did). Take the blanket you just got and the
juice and goo to the arena and go to the prisoner. Give the all three at once
and he will give you a key called HK 105.<br>
<br>
Step 8. He tells you to take it to the Cee-Lerk in Anteria's pass. Anteria is
old elven for Antonica, and the only pass in Antonica is Highhold Pass. The
Cee-Lerk is his distorted way of saying &quot;clerk.&quot; Basically, give the
HK 105 key to Bank Clerk Jaylin and she will give you a note.<br>
<br>
Step 9. The note directs you to a man named Brother Hayle who happens to be a
fellow knight of Marr. He is currently adventuring in the Dungeon of Splitpaw in
the Karanas. (Easy Place at my lvl =) When you give him the note he tells you
that you need to prove yourself by getting three items yourself. He demands the
hilt of an unholy sword, a brilliant sword of faith and the testimony of truth
from a paladin who lost favor with Mithaniel Marr and lost his powers.<br>
<br>
Step 10. The first thing you need is the sword hilt. This is found on a
Shadowknight named Xioctil in the Castle Mistmoore. He is not-super rare, but
you need to keep the mobs there clear so he will spawn. He drops the hilt every
time.<br>
<br>
Step 11. The last 2 items are on the king of evil himself...Sir Lucan D'Lere
(Captain of the miltia on Freeport) Every time you kill sir Lucan you get some
plate boots which are plus 9 strength and a testament proving he used to be a
paladin. Give this piece of paper to the person in the Knights of Truth Hall as
proof of Lucan's Death and receive a Brilliant Sword of Faith for your heroics!<br>
<br>
Step 12. Once you have the Sword, Testament, Old Note and Hilt....go back to
splitpaw and give them all at once to brother Hayle. He will then give you the
Soulfire. The Soulfire is 45, 23 2H slash with plus 7 str and plus 7 wis. It has
5 charges of complete.<br>
<br>
Please note: To get the Testament of Marr, simply go to the East Commonlands and
give Altunic Jarin a cloth shirt (med). This will make a guy named Squire Narls
POP. Kill him and take his head and give it to Altunic. Altunic will give you a
coin. Then, go talk to the paladin who stands on the grass of the Knights of
Truth area of Freeport. Ask him about the quest again and tell him what Altunic
told you to say. He will then tell you to kill some spiders or
something...basically go to the store and buy some newbie items and return them
to him. Once you do that he will tell you its time to take the ultimate
test...killing an enemy of Marr. A guard will pop in the sewer entrance behind
the Paladin guild. He is like lvl 5 and extremely easy to kill. Grease him and
take his helmet over to the same paladin and give it to him. He will give you
another coin. Give him back both coins and he will give you the necessary
testament for the soulfire quest.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="2">Okay this id dedicated to all the
rogues that stand with honor in the realm of norrath and the plains of other
worlds. I am Kumamarr Osoli 25th rogue of honor. I have completed the quest- and
with many hardships on the way. I will share with you fellow rogue the true
steps that you must follow to earn you honor.<br>
<br>
The quest starts in the temple of solusek Ro. If you go into the main room and
go straight though it and though one of the 2 doors you will see 2 more doors in
frot of you. Hail Lon the Redeemed and he will start your journey, and will give
you a note to take to conium darkblade.<br>
<br>
Conium Darkblade is in dagnors cauldron, a zone on the side fo butcher block.
When you get close to the lake you just run straight out on the lake and you
will hit an island. Conium Darkblade is on the very top, and will give you and
axe called 'never stop chopping' to give to bryan mcgee in High Hold pass.<br>
<br>
Bryan Mcgee is at the lumbermill which is close to the entrance to High hold
keep. When you give him the axe he gives you a 10 slot box to fill with 10
drinks.<br>
<br>
1- Clock work oil stout - dropped in Solusek A, or Solusek's Eye. Gabbie is
always camped (drops the molten cloak), and the CWG model CX drops this. Just
ask someone to kill it for you, and dont try to help unless you are in your 30s,
as these clockworks have a wide aggro range. I died here many times.<br>
<br>
2- Gator gulp ale - find a merchant in the back of the tunnel named Bubar in
east commons. This can be bought.<br>
<br>
3- Vasty deep ale - sister isle (elrossi) in Ocean of tears. This is bought<br>
<br>
4- The oblong bottle - have a higher lvl magician summon some levitation rings
and some water stones, as you must swim a ways in Ocean of tears to get this.
From the boat trip from freeport to butcher block get off the boat when you go
in between 2 big rock outcroppings. you then go southwest from there to neg
1611, pos 2924 and pick it up from the ocean floor.<br>
<br>
5- Underfoot Triple Boch - from Trumpy Irontoe in Kaladim. This can be bought.<br>
<br>
6- Tunares finest - in felwithe from Wela Muselender. This can be bought.<br>
<br>
7- Blood Spirit - dropped off the hemo enologist in the courtyard. She is camped
alot for expreience and another that spawns close to her that drops the hooded
cloak. Sneak and hide and watch that you dont come visable for you will surely
die unless you are 35+ and even then it will be close.<br>
<br>
8- Lendels Grand Laugher - in river vale in the big building in the center of
town. Sold by Mac Deeppockets.<br>
<br>
9- Frozen Toe Rum - Go to the ciy of Halas in Everfrost and Scon McDaniel sells
this at a shop called McDaniels smokes and spirits. This can be bought.<br>
<br>
10- The BlackBurrow Swig - this is obtained in Black burrow which is by Qeynos
hills. This is the toughest part of the quest. You need 4 Black Burrown Gnoll
Skins (not pelts), 2 Gnoll Pup scalps dropped off gnoll pups, 2 casks of Ol'
Tjiuum Fierce Brew (Ol TJ's fiece brew for short), and 1 Black burrow cask which
drops off the gnoll brewer and the gnoll master brewer, they spawn at loc 32,32
on level 3 and the place holder is the gnoll gaurdsman. The brewer and master
brewer are random spawns with the master brewer as ultra rare. Once you get 4 BB
gnoll skins, and 2 gnoll pup scalps and 2 Ol' TJ's fierce brew then COMBINE them
in the Black Burrow Cask and you will have the Black burrow Swig.<br>
<br>
** When you have the 10 drinks in the cask that bryan mcgee gave you in High
Hold-- COMBINE THEM and it will turn into a case of spirits. I leared the hard
way on this one and gave the whole cask full of the drinks to Bryan McGee!!!!
OUCH is right!<br>
<br>
Return to Bryan McGee in High Hold pass and give him the case of spirits and you
will receive faction, some plat, experience and a lore no drop gem called the
gem of stamina.<br>
<br>
____________________<br>
<br>
the second half of the quest is done easily by getting 3 items.<br>
<br>
Go to the basement of a store in Halards Resales in East Free port. You must
lock pick the door to get in. The lowest skill level you must have is 122 I
believe. The easiest way to get it up is at befallen which is on the east wall
in West Commons. Once you get in the room you will get the Gem case. You will
need to get 2 keys to open it. Key one is obtained by giving the sparkle purse
to noresa sparkle in West commons. the sparkle purse is dropped off lynada the
exiled in Solusek A (Solusek's eye) She is in the room net to the goblin high
shaman room. Try to get a high level friend to drop her for you if you can your
self. She is a high 20s low 30s necro.<br>
<br>
To get the other key you must buy the sparkling sapphire from noresa sparkle and
give it to Toxdil the poison merchant in Freeport. He is behind an invisible
wall on the northwest corner of the newbie zone by the west gate.<br>
<br>
Take the 2 keys and the case to Bubar in the East commons tunnel and He will
give you a sparkling sapphire (also known as the gem of righteousness)<br>
<br>
** when you have the gem of stamina and the sparkling saphire from bubar then go
to the Desert of South Ro. You must find an orc named Ortallius. He is most
often in the north wester corner of the zone. Give him the 2 gems and you shall
become one of the rogues of honor.<br>
<br>
The Burning Rapier<br>
magic, lore, no drop<br>
damage 7, delay 20<br>
agi+5 dex +5<br>
effect: ignite (35dd)<br>
<br>

<br>
go to solusek A and get the clockwork oil stout and the sparkle purse.<br>
<br>
then to tunnel in east commons to get gator gulp ale,<br>
<br>

<br>
then zone to the desert of north RO and run down to oasis then, the desert of
south ro to turn in the to gems to Orallius.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
/ooc this is long hard quest. I started it at 24 and finished it at 25. It is
very well worth the effot, and the weapon no dobt rocks, and is better than a
yak, SBD, stilletto, and a slime coated harpoon in terms of damage. I died many
times in Solusek A, and died in mistmoore also. It was the toughest thing i have
ever experienced in the game to give bryan mcgee the 10 drinks without combining
them, but i recovered. The above information is the result of alot of work.<br>
Thanks to Zerg Sentinent on giving the info that got me goin on it and to my
guilmates and friends that helped me in SolA and mistmoore and with the ports.<br>
<br>
viva all rogues. Stand tall and with honor. May you one day wield the burning
rapier.<br>

*********************************************************************************<br>
This is the spoiler of the entire quest from memory. I have a good memory :) The
stats and my afterthoughts are at the bottom of the text. It took me 60 hours to
do this quest as the trailblazer, with no help from anyone else doing the quest.
This story is concerning the quest and how to go through it. It is they way I
wanted to write it. I will send in another text, with step by step instructions
later.<br>
*******************************************************************************<br>
<br>
I'm spilling my guts out here... It's going to be long and fairly detailed, I
need some typing practice anyway.<br>
<br>
I was helping my good friend Riae Soulmender in Dagnor's Cauldron trying to find
that elusive Bilge aqua goblin when suddenly Riae mentions that he found some
exiled Paladin by the docks of faydwer. Naturally I felt obligated to go
investigate. Off to butcherblock I went in search of something interesting.<br>
<br>
I get to the docks and to my surprise I find a friendly young Dwarf fisherman by
the sea.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hail Dru Razbine&quot;, I said. He responds back about his fishing spot
and tells me how he needs to fish for food now that he is banished from Kaladim.
I listen in on his story of woe and how he was stripped of his Cape of Underfoot
by Datur Nightseer, the leader of the Paladin Guild in Kaladim. Turns out he was
chosen for a very important task by Datur, failed, and was banished. If only he
had a brave Paladin to help him. &quot;I think you've found your best hope Dru,
let me help you,&quot; I said to him, hoping for the chance to redeem my
newfound fallen dwarf paladin. He jumps at the chance maybe seeing something in
me that reminded him of himself back in his younger years. He goes on to explain
the unfortunate circumstances surrounding what has happened. He was sent by
Datur Nightseer to carry the Chalice of Conquest to a noble band of Paladins in
the Mountains of Rathe. Dru then informs me that the Chalice of Conquest is very
special indeed. Rumor has it that Brell himself delivered the Chalice to the
Church of Underfoot himself. Drinking from the Chalice of Conquest assures you
of victory, howerver only good natured people can drink from the cup. If someone
of an evil past drinks from the cup, they suffer the wrath of Brell. He goes on
to say he was able to make it to the group of High Paladins in Rathe Mountains
but while he was there a band of orcs attacked the camp. During the melee an
opportunistic Blue Orc was able to sneak into the camp and steal the Chalice!
Dru was busy fighting off the attacking orcs to notice the artifact being
stolen. After the fight was over Dru chased the orc off into the sunset to no
avail. When Lord Datur Nightseer heard of the events that took place from Dru,
he chose to blame his once noble paladin and banish him from Kaladim.<br>
<br>
After his tale ended he handed me a container with two slots. He told me that
once I found the Chalice of Conquest and the Candle of Bravery, combine them,
and return the case to Lord Nightseer. &quot;Candle of Bravery?&quot; I asked,
having never heard of such an item. He explained that is a Ceremonial candle lit
when the Chalice of Conquest is to be drunk from. He told me to get the Candle
of Bravery I would have to get both the candlestick and the candle, the latter
of which burnt out long ago and he did not know where Priestess Ghalea aquires
them from.<br>
<br>
From this point I'm off on my quest for the Chalice of Conquest, Candle of
Bravery, and most importantly- To restore Dru Razbine to his former glory of
being a Paladin of Underfoot. First, thanks to Riae Soulmender who reminded me
who she was, I went to Kaladim to speak with Priestess Ghalea of the Church of
Underfoot. I made my way to the cleric guild inside Kaladim and asked the
Priestess about the Candle of Bravery. She explains that the candle itself is
very difficult to make and only one person is able to do this task: Dok of Halas.
She told him that if I needed one made I would surely need some Soil of
Underfoot to give to Dok. For the Soil of Underfoot I had venture to Lesser
Faydark and lay waste to some Fairies, and pick up four portions of Fairy dusts.
After this tedious task I returned the dust to Ghalea and she gave me some
blessed Soil of Underfoot. I then knew my journey required me to take the boat
to Antonica.<br>
<br>
After a long boat ride, followed by a long run, I made found myself at the
Paladin camp in Rathe Mountains, the same Paladins who give out the Armor of Ro
molds. I find Nicholas, the dwarven Paladin, and ask him about the Chalice of
Conquest. He fills me in, with more detail, of the orc attack that fateful day
and the events that followed. Turns out that after the attack, a passing ranger
helped Nicholas track down the blue orc to an orc camp in the near by Lake Rathe.
At this lake the found the blue orc's dead body, appearently the orc had taken a
fatal blow during the fight but had enough stamina to make it back to the camp,
and a group of orcs too powerful for just the two of them to take on. Nicholas
decided that it would be best to go back and get help from the other Paladins.
The next morning when the Paladins returned to the orc camp they found it
deserted with some orc remnants scattered about. They found a bracelet with the
name &quot;Klunga&quot; on it, a shovel, a bag of cauldron prawns, and two sets
of tracks leading away from the camp. Nicholas went on to say that the orc camp
has now been taken over by green orcs and advised me to stay away. I thanked
Nicholas for the information and then asked him what he knew about the Candle of
Bravery. He gave me a piece of the broken candlestick and went on to say that
the Rathe Mountains are not only overrun by monsters, but by evil druids as
well! Appearently an odd druid somehow managed to brake the candlestick and
steal a portion of it during a fight between the druids and the paladins.
Nicholas even remembered the druids battle cry, &quot;Long live the
green!!!&quot; Nicholas told me that if I was able to find the other piece of
the candlestick, the make of the candlestick would surely be able to put it back
together.<br>
<br>
Against Nicholas' advice, I went to Lake Rathetear in search of clues. I found
the orc camp that he mentioned, dispatched the surrounding orcs and found an
abandoned orc shovel on the ground, which I promptly picked up. I found no other
clues or tracks however, so I went back to Rathe Mountains in to find the odd
druid who holds the remaining portion of the Candlestick. At this point I
searched and searched and searched but could not find any druids that seemed...
well unordinary to me. Luckily for me an old friend of mine, Bohr Blackblade of
Fires of Heaven, a fellow Dwarven Paladin, passed through the mountains and
stumbled upon me. I informed him of what I was searching for. He sat down for a
moment to think, like many wise dwarfs do at times. He stood up and told me that
the only &quot;odd druids&quot; he knows of in the Mountains of Rathe would be
the Unkempt Preservers. He then told me he was in a bit of a rush and he hoped
he helped out. I waved goodbye and then started looking for Unkempt Preservers.
I indeed found them and after killing the evil druids for almost a full day I
felt discouraged. I took a bit of a rest and decided to give it another shot.
Then out of nowhere I heard, &quot;Long live the green!!!&quot;, as a dagger
pierced my shoulder from behind. I quickly showed her what a Dwarven Paladin is
made of and I'm sure she will regret what she started for all eternity, the
druid fell dead at my feet. I did indeed find the Base of the Candlestick on the
body and felt with these components I should make my way to Halas to find Dok.<br>
<br>
I was unfamiliar with Everfrost and Halas, and everything inbetween. After a
days journey wandering the Snowy Peaks I found a cave with surrounding Barbarian
Warriors. I found myself at Halas at last. I was able to find Dok in the
building aptly named &quot;Dok's Cigars&quot;. When I hailed him Dok told me how
I would find no cigars for they had run out and I should leave. I informed him
that I was not there for the cigars, but for the Candle of Bravery. &quot;Candle
of Bravery? I'll need the candlestick, or pieces of it, a pouch of Soil of
Underfoot, and a honeycomb to make that magical item,&quot; he told me. Of
course I had every component accept the honeycomb and none of the local shops
had any instock. I reluctantly left Halas and started the journey for Misty
Thicket, where I had heard Bixies dropped the Honeycomb I was after. Lucky for
me a friendly druid named Tryst Trustolid was kind enough to take me to Misty
Thicket in a flash. I found a Honeycomb in one of the local shops and my friend
Tryst was able to get me back to the Karanas. From there I was able to run back
to Halas and turn in the items to Dok. He must have been a shaman because I was
sure I felt some magic pulsating from the Candle of Bravery when he handed me
the item. I placed the Candle into my container given by Dru Razbine and was
already halfway to my goal!<br>
<br>
At this point I was all out of clues. I had a bracelet with the name Klunga on
it, and an abondoned orc shovel. &quot;Where could the Chalice be?&quot; I asked
myself over and over. The blue orc, Klunga?, had it last and now he is dead. I
finally went back to Nicholas to ask about the orc remnants to see if I missed
something. He reminded me that he found the shovel, the bracelet, and a bag of
cauldron prawns when he looted the camp. Cauldron prawns! How could I have been
such a gnoll and missed that clue, surely it meant that the Orcs were from
Dagnor's Cauldron.<br>
<br>
So I rode the boat back to Faydwer and headed to the Cauldron. When I arrived I
found that my old friend Dalas Soww was there looking for the elusive Blige. I
asked him if he had seen any orcs in the area and he quickly led me to the only
orcs he knew of, the orc scout camp high atop of a rocky hill. I thanked him and
he went along his way. So I was onto them now. I found the orcs and they were
going to give me the information I needed to find the Chalice! Even though I was
very good at the Orc Language they would not respond to my questions. I showed
them that Dwarves do not appreciate such lack of cooperation. I had to resort to
violance. I slaughtered the Orcs and every time they came back to the camp I
slaughtered them again. Still no information. However I did notice an odd
pattern. Roughly every 6 hours there would be four orc at the camp instead of
three. However this fourth orc that was appearing was still just a plain Orc
Scout. But I was determined, and continued the Orc slaughter, I needed to redeem
Dru! Finally, days later, a new orc appeared at the camp. It was an exiled orc
legionaire. &quot;Could this be what I have been looking for?!&quot; I
questioned myself. Sure enough he followed suit as with his orc brethen not
responding to my questions so I dispatched him. However this orc, instead of
dropping Rawhide armor, dropped a note. A bloodstained note.<br>
<br>
The note had some very interesting information, the spelling was sloppy as is
all Orc Literature. The note read a little something like this: &quot;Dis is a
notis of the death of Klunga~ He tryd to reedeam himsef by stealig a Dwarv cup~
When he drunk from cup at lake he died~ We drug his body back to Calldrin~ We
burnd bodi in fire pit here~ We bury cup here~ We killd gnome castor here~ We
tink he knows sumtink~ Den all is gud~&quot;<br>
<br>
I deciphered the note I found on the Orc with my brother Xiae Soulmender, a very
intelligent High Elf wizard. We decided the message stated that Klunga was the
blue orc that stole the cup, he was not injured during the battle in Rathe
Mountains but died from drinking the cup. His fellow orcs brought Klunga's body
and the cup back to the Cauldron. The Orcs then cremated Klunga's body in the
fire pit at the Orc Camp, and buried the cup elsewhere. The only thing we
weren't quite sure about was the Gnome caster. Who was it? And where was he?
While scouring the Cauldron for answers I noticed my brother Diae Soulmender, a
Ranger, walking to the Estate of Unrest. I asked him if he could try to track
down this Gnome Caster. He was able to make short work of that task, finding
Ghilanbiddle Nylwadil very quickly. Ghilanbiddle was at a camp with some
companions of his. I asked Ghilanbiddle if he knew anything about the Chalice of
Conquest. He told me that he knew the Chalice was buried within the Cauldron but
he did not know precisely where, however he did know someone who does. He
explained using his arcane magic he would be able to resurrect Captain Klunga
and have him lead me to the cup. He required a few items to do this task, a item
that was once owned by Klunga, a portion of his blood, and most importantly, 100
gold coins. I had the bracelet klunga had owned, and also 100 gold coins. But
what could be the portion of blood? &quot;Is it possible the bloodstained note
itself is what he requires?&quot; I asked myself. I decided it was worth a try.
I traded him the note, the bracelet, and 100 gold coins.<br>
<br>
Sure enough he responded back saying the he had successfully resurrected
Klunga's soul to the place he was laid to rest. Ghilanbiddle also told me that
Klunga's soul would need something to dig up the Chalice with. I sure was glad
that I picked up that abandoned orc shovel at the Orc Camp back in Lake
Rathetear. I ran to the Orc Camp where I found the exiled orc, and found a
skeleton named Captain Klunga. I gave the scattered fallen bones the shovel. I
have to admit I jumped back a bit with the bones came together to form a
skeleton twice the size as I. Klunga, wordless, started walking in a straight
line towards a distant point in the Cauldron. I followed him into the water and
swan close behind to follow, my only fear now was that a passing adventurer
would kill Captain Klunga before he was able to dig up the chalice. We made it
across the Cauldron to a remote spot. Klunga paused a moment, a brown bag
appeared at his feet and then he turned on me! I unsheathed my Ghoulbane, and
dismissed him back to the realm of the undead. When I picked up the brown bag
where Klunga paused I found none other then the Chalice of Conquest! Overjoyed I
made my way back to Kaladim. Ran through the halls, past the Bank of Kaladim,
through the halls of the Church of Underfoot and kneeled before my liege, Lord
Datur Nightseer, the noble Paladin leader. I placed the Chalice into the
container and combined the two items. I handed the container then to Lord Datur
Nightseer who, in return, gave me a Cape of Underfoot for my troubles. The Cape
itself was not very useful, a simple 4 armor class and maybe 5 extra stamina. I
believe the cape to be more of a status symbol in Kaladim and almost forgot
about Dru Razbine himself. I ran to him, cloak in hand, seeing in his eyes that
he knew my quest was over and he would be able to back to Kaladim.<br>
<br>
Dru Razbine exclaimed, &quot;Jiae, you're definitely a finer Paladin then I.
Take this holy weapon, but be careful what you do with the magical charges it
possesses, for I know of only one cleric that can recharge the magical effect.
The cleric I speak of went to the lava filled plains of Antonica and has not
been heard from since. Thank you Jiae, I will now be able to walk the halls of
Kaladim again...&quot;<br>
<br>
When I examined the blade closely I found no magical effect or charges, does
this mean I must search out the cleric in the lava filled plains of Antonica?
What does she hold in store for me? A refined weapon? Possibly our grandest holy
sword of all? We shall she in the future fellow Paladins, I call on you to help
find the missing pieces regarding this Cleric!<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
<br>
The weapon I received was the:<br>
<br>
&quot; Holy Partisan of Underfoot &quot;<br>
Two handed slashing<br>
14 Damage,<br>
46 delay,<br>
HP +25, SV MAGIC +5<br>
Class: Pal<br>
Races: HUM HIE DWF<br>
<br>
You read correctly, half elves and erudites are left out. Now keep in mind I was
able to do this SOLO, at level 40. As you can see it is not our best weapon out
there but if a lower level group stumbled upon this weapon it would be made use
of. Unfortunantly I don't know the levels of the fairies, unkempt druids ect...
because they were all green. My guess is a group of high teens-twenties can do
this quest.<br>
<br>
In my opinion howerver, I believe it to be part of an ongoing quest, concerning
that Cleric in Lavastorm? Najena? Solusek Ro/A/B?<br>
<br>
I've sent the quest and screenshot off to the EQ sites I frequently visit and
most likely we'll hear more from this quest yet!<br>

<p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="2">The Stonebrunt Mountains are next
to the Warrens which is next to the Erudite Necromance town, Paineel. If You're
a Druid like I, you run South from the Druid Circle in Tox. When you hit the
side of a mountain, make a right and start following the wall. Anyways, no for
the quest! ***BEWARE*** Stonebrunt is dangerous, everything aggro's!<br>
<br>
So now you're in Stonebrunt Mountains (SBM) Head to this location (1299,-547)
This is the location to the Kejekan Village. Here's what you do:<br>
<br>
-When you reach the entrance to the Kejekan Village, go to the first house on
the left<br>
<br>
-The Cat you're looking for is named Jali something or other. Hail this hip cat.<br>
<br>
-He tells you what is wrong with his wife n' blah blah blah. Read what he says
if you wanna know the story. If not, just say that &quot;I have peaceful
intentions&quot;<br>
<br>
-Jali says more about what happened to his wife. Again, read what he says so you
know what you're working for. If not, say &quot;I can help&quot;<br>
<br>
-After you say that, He tells you to speak with the village chief Khonza. He
tells you to tell Khonza that Jali sent you.<br>
<br>
-Khonza is located directly across from the house that Jali was stationed in.<br>
=================================================<br>
(Second Part)<br>
<br>
-You find Khonza (I hope) So now you should tell Khonza that &quot;Jali sent
me&quot;<br>
<br>
-Khonza tells you that you need to [fetch] some items. He tells you it might
anger the spirits but its for a noble cause.<br>
<br>
-You say &quot;I could fetch them.&quot;<br>
=================================================<br>
(Third Part)<br>
-You recieve an 8 slot bag from Khonza that you need to place these items in.<br>
<br>
-Khonza tells you what you need to [fetch]:<br>
-2 Panda Claws (so far Panda cubs, Matures, probably more. I have yet to find
out. These claws are extremely rare! They are very HARD TO FIND. People sell em
for 100plat, so use that as a last resort)<br>
-2 Tiger Skins (most commons drop are probably off Kejekan Tigers. There are
many types of tigers out there, but i got mine for Kejekan Tigers)<br>
-2 Asp Poison Sacs (Probably easiest part of the quest. They drop in Oasis)<br>
-1 Bamboo Shoot (Foraged in SBM. I think you need a Forage skill of 100. Ask a
friendly Druid to help ya out with these.)<br>
-1 Kejekan Palm Fruit (Another Foraged item. Ask a Druid or something)<br>
<br>
-When/if you get all these items, place them in the backpack the Khonza gave to
you. Nothing can be stacked, make sure you dont stack you poison sacs!<br>
<br>
-When combined, the bag turns into a &quot;special&quot; bag which you give back
to Khonza<br>
<br>
-When Khonza recieves the bag, it gives you a vial.<br>
<br>
-With the vial, head to Jali. Give him the Vial and he gives you a sword.

<p align="left"><b><a name="Raincaller Longbow">Raincaller Longbow</a></b></p>
<p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="2">You must travel to the high elf
city of Felwithe, to obtain the starting information for this quest. Talk to
Kinool Goldsinger and ask him, &quot;Where can I get an Enchanted Trueshot
Bow?&quot; You will then begin to obtain the information, and items, needed to
complete this long but rewarding quest. Here are the items that Kinool must
recieve:<br>
<br>
1) Faerie Dust<br>
2) A Treant Heart (or wooden heart as it called)<br>
3) A Trueshot Longbow<br>
4) 3,000 GOLD pieces<br>
<br>
--How to obtain these items--<br>
<br>
1) Faerie Dust:<br>
-Travel to West Freeport, and in the newbie fighting area, you will see a gnome
named PING FUZZLECUTTER selling goods next to a tent. Purchase 10 &quot;Fuzzlecutter
Formulas&quot; from him.<br>
<br>
-Travel to the gnome city of Ak'Anon, go to the necromancer guild there (a small
piece of land across a little stream) and you will see SANFRYD FEATHERHEAD
standing there. Converse with him a bit, and tell him, &quot;I am your
friend&quot; several times. Eventually, he will give you a 10 slot crate to fill
with hair tonics. Place the hair formulas you bought from PING FUZZLECUTTER into
the crate, hit the combine button, and hand the resulting crate back to SANFRYD.
In exchange, he will hand you a Tattered Toupe, to have it repaired.<br>
<br>
-Travel to Cazic-Thule, and go to the Throne Room (a difficult area if there are
not groups hunting the normal spawns here). There are two Hulking Gorilla spawns
in this room--one on each side of the chair in the Throne Room. Kill these slow
spawns until you loot TWO clumps of gorilla hair.<br>
<br>
-Travel to the underwater city of Kedge Keep. This part is rather tricky and can
be time consuming also--it will require 1 balanced group of level 45+ members,
to be safe (there is also a posting in the Quest/Kedge Keep/Raincaller area of
everlore.com on this particular step). I recommend going invis, swimming down to
her spawn area (through several tunnels--and the room itself is fairly safe from
wondering spawns) and then attacking the spawns in that room. The Gloomwater
Mermaids and regular Mermaids (who are place holders for the Golden Haired
Mermaid) have some nasty damage spells, so be careful. Camp this room until the
Golden Haired Mermaid finally spawns (could take awhile, but the spawn place is
every 15-20 minutes I think). I am told she drops the Lock of Golden Mermaid
Hair everytime. Loot that item, and get outta there =)<br>
<br>
-Travel back to PING FUZZLECUTTER and give him the Tattered Toupe, Mermaid Hair,
and Clump of Gorilla Hair (2 of them). In exchange, he will give you the
&quot;Mane Attraction&quot; (which is a nice item to go back and do the quest
for, after the Raincaller quest).<br>
<br>
-Return to Ak'Anon and give the Mane Attraction to SANFRYD and he will hand you
the Faerie Wing.<br>
<br>
-Finally, go to Lesser Faydark, in the Faerie Village, and stand near the gnome
clockwork named Gearheart (I think that's his name). The faerie spawn next to
him, is the place holder for Princess Joleena. Killing Gearheart will give you
very bad faction hits, and killing the PH for the princess will not help the
spawn time any. Instead, simply sit and watch--the PH will despawn about every
15 minutes and a new one will replace it. Eventually, one of these will be
PRINCESS JOLEENA. Hand in the Faerie Wing to her, and she will give you the
Faerie Dust that you need.<br>
<br>
2) A Treant Heart (or wooden heart):<br>
-Best recieved from Treants--but since that is bad for rangers to kill these
huge creatures, there is an easier way to obtain the item.<br>
<br>
-Travel to North Freeport, to the Jage Tigre Inn and purchase many &quot;small
lanterns&quot; (they are very cheap), then travel to West Freeport, into the
Hoggcaller's Inn. Go upstairs, and inside a room there, you will find JYLE
WYNDSHOT. Hand in the lanterns to him, one at a time, and you will recieve nice
faction raises and probably &quot;wood shards&quot; (these are used for the
Trueshot Longbow quest--which you need to complete BEFORE you can finish the
Raincaller Longbow quest). However, if you continue to hand in the lanterns, you
will eventually recieve &quot;a wooden heart&quot;--which is what you are
looking for =)<br>
<br>
3) A Trueshot Longbow:<br>
-This is a quest in itself. Please check another posting for the details on this
quest--or simply purchase a Trueshot Longbow for about 100pp from another
player.<br>
<br>
4) 3,000 Gold Pieces:<br>
-Simply get 300pp, go to a bank, transfer the platnium into gold pieces, and
viola! you have 3,000gp.<br>
<br>
Finally, return to Felwithe and speak with KINOOL GOLDSINGER again. Once you
hand in the four items, you will recieve more exp, more faction, and the coveted
RainCaller LongBow (which can also be sold for around 2,000pp if you are not a
ranger):<br>
<br>
--The Raincaller Longbow--<br>
Magic-Lore-<br>
slot: Ranged<br>
Damage: 20<br>
Delay: 45<br>
Range: 200<br>
Strength +6, Dexterity +6<br>
5 charges of Firestrike (lvl 52 DD ranger spell)<br>
<br>
Hope this helps you out--and may Tunare bless your endeavers in this rewarding
quest.</font></p>
