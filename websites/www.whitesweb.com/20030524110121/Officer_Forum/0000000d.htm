<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>As you may have read in the public guild forum i will be posting a a raid calendar page. To really make this work everyone needs to register on members page with a few new additions , time zone and preferred playing time. Thank you for all the help and motds to get people to logon to website. But please continue to do so as well as sending tells and mentioning it in guildchat. Even if you have to be a little pushy or a touch annoying because it is important for the guild to get registered so we know who we have and when we have them. Thanks again alot guys. See you in game.</p>
