quest turn-ins while using Form of the Great Bear. This quest will only trigger
with proper TRUE SPIRIT FACTION is detected by the quest NPCs. Reports have been
received that being in Bear Form during epic-item turn-ins may BUG the quest
NPCs to misread your True Spirit faction and cause the quest trigger to FAIL!<br>
<br>
There are several methods for beginning the quest, among which have been
reported are: Ocean of Tears, loc +800, -5400, Capt Surestout Rathe Mountains,
(on cyclops hill), Blinde the Cutpurse; Butcherblock Mountains, +260, +1650, Peg
Leg; Field of Bones, (marauder cave), Iksar Outcast/Manslayer<br>
<br>
While the information here is gleened from conversations with Capt. Surestout,
it is reported that any of the above will yield the same information and
&quot;tiny gem&quot;.<br>
<br>
<strong>Here is the Surestout method of beginning the quest:<br>
Go to Gornit's island in OOT, approx. loc 800, -5400, kill Capt Surestout (green
con at level 54, one ebolt kills him). A lesser spirit will spawn where he's
killed, hail the spirit.</strong><br>
<br>
Capt Surestout died.<br>

Capt Surestout says 'You have run me through! Beware the Pirates of Gunthak..
They will avenge me.. Unngh!!<br>
a lesser spirit begins to cast a spell. a lesser spirit's body pulses with
energy.<br>
<br>
You say, <strong>'Hail a lesser spirit'</strong><br>
<br>
a lesser spirit says 'Did you take this person's life, shaman? a lesser spirit
regards you indifferently -- You could probably win this fight.<br>
<br>
You say, <strong>'Yes'<br>
<br>
</strong>a lesser spirit says 'Why have you taken this person's life? Did he
threaten your life? Did you dislike him? Or was his death a profit to you in
some way?<br>
<br>
You say, <strong>'He threatened my life'<br>
<br>
</strong>a lesser spirit says 'I see. It brings me sadness to see another die,
but his heart was black and a great nothingness. His body will become the grass
now. Thank you for what you have done, shaman. You say, 'Who are you?' a lesser
spirit says 'What, or who, I am isn't as important as what, or who, WE are. Do
you wish to know more, shaman?<br>
<br>
You say, <strong>'I wish to know more'<br>
<br>
</strong>a lesser spirit says 'That is good. Take this gem. It is a part of us
like the clouds to the sky and is a wonderful gift from the grandfather. Take
this gem to where the humans gather to spoil the land and water. Some call it a
port. There you will find one of us, a shaman like yourself. Give him the gem
and perhaps he will tell you more of the spirits.</font></p>

<br>
You say, <strong>'You can buy booze.'</strong><br>

Bondl Felligan suddenly becomes completely sober and says, 'Very well, shaman,

<p><font size="2">After this you can follow him to the Jade Tiger's Den or just

and saying &quot;You<br>

shaman, spirits are known to you. They aid you if you pay them homage<br>
and respect the world around you. They also will bend to your will if you are
powerful enough. We<br>
are a part of the entire universe and we exist because people believe and feel
us. However [very few]<br>
know us in this form. To mortals we are but ideas, [wisps of consciousness] in
an expanse of<br>
emptiness and as difficult to grasp as breath in Everfrost.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">You say, <strong>'What trust do
you speak of?'</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">a greater spirit says 'Trust is
the glue of the universe. When one trusts others to do their part, it<br>
allows them to focus on what they must do themselves. The trust that others have
in us also gives us<br>
the confidence to do our parts effectively, thus maintaining harmony. When one
becomes<br>
dissatisfied with his part and pursues his own desires, this is called greed.
And greed destroys the<br>
glue of the universe. This is why we wished the bandits under the grass.</font></p>

threaten us and our home.<br>
We seek those with the wisdom, patience, and might to help us ensure the health

wolf. The ox is the<br>
personification of endurance and when he enters your body, you do not become an

we realize are<br>
powerful enough to accomplish what needs to be done. To judge such individuals,
we have prepared<br>

patience. Take this gem<br>
and go on a pilgrimage to an island in the great water the wasichu call Erud's
Crossing. The Kerrans<br>
there are our allies and can show you to our next contact, Ooglyn. Give Ooglyn
the gem and do what<br>
she asks. As you walk the path, remember what you've learned about trust.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>The Test of Patience<br>
</strong><br>
Head to Erud's Crossing. Find Ooglyn, a female ogre shaman, on the island.<br>
Approx. loc -900, 1600. She should be up, if not her spawn time is 2 hours.<br>
<br>
<strong>Preparation:<br>
</strong>Bind on the Island or Qeynos<br>
Have SoW, Levitation and Enduring Breath up and running.<br>
Have your pet spell ready to cast.<br>
Have gate or evac, if wizard/druid in group, ready to cast.<br>
<br>
<strong>Minimum Levels Required (more is better):<br>
</strong>Solo: 49+ Shaman &amp; pet (or even lower using Inviso to Animals)<br>
Duo: Two 44+ Shamans &amp; pets<br>
Group: Well balanced high 30's or better.<br>
<br>
<br>
You say, <strong>'Hail Ooglyn'<br>
<br>
</strong>Ooglyn says 'Ooooh, it you, shaman . Me's been waitin for you cuz our
frenz say you comin an need<br>
da test. So's I gib you da test. Hmm, now where me put it? Ooglyn been waiting
for sign for so long<br>
dat me forget where me put test. Keep your eyes out for sign while me look for
test. Oh, hey,<br>
shaman, they gib you gem? I need dat gem, please, heheh.<br>
<br>
<strong>Give her the gem.</strong><br>
<br>
Ooglyn says 'Ahhh, tank you, now me can...OH LOOK!! DA SIGN!!!! Oh, sorry you
missed it. The<br>
sign show you where to wait for da test. Follow me...I like you so I take you
there. We goin for a<br>
swim, shaman!<br>

You gain party experience!!<br>
<br>
Ooglyn begins to cast a spell.<br>
Ooglyn feels much faster.<br>
Ooglyn begins to cast a spell.<br>
Ooglyn is surrounded by a brief lupine aura.<br>
Ooglyn begins to cast a spell.<br>
Ooglyn's body pulses with energy.<br>
<br>
After Ooglyn finishes casting spells, she starts to run away. Follow her until
she<br>
disappears into the water. Then run out over the water (make sure you have<br>
levitation and some sort of underwater breathing on) and head to loc -1600,
+4200.<br>
Dive down about 10 feet into the water and cast your pet spells. Then proceed to<br>
the bottom of the ocean and wait patiently as this test suggests.<br>
Ooglyn may be waiting there for you there or she may not. If she's not there, no<br>
worries. It won't effect the quest.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Patiently wait at that location. Five different spirits or Heyokah will
eventually<br>
spawn. Be patient. Your goal is to receive &quot;a broken arrow&quot; from Abe,
and a<br>
&quot;gem&quot; from the Greater Spirit. As such, only the conversations with
Abe and the<br>
Greater Spirit are presented here. Conversations with the others is merely
&quot;fluff&quot;.<br>
Did I mention patience?<br>
Invisibility to Animals: Several have reported that using Invisibility to
Animals<br>
while waiting will keep the sharks from attacking you.<br>
<br>
NOTE: You will also have to fend off the regular Sharks and the much tougher<br>
Killer Sharks that roam the area while you wait UNLESS you keep Invisibility to<br>
Animals up constantly.<br>
<br>
TIP: Despite what ANY of the spirits or Ooglyn say to you, DO NOT leave this<br>
location. They are only trying to trick you. Remember, this is about Patience.<br>
Now then, once you are at the bottom of the ocean at neg 1600 pos 4200 . . .<br>
<br>
You say, <strong>'Hail Abe the Abandoned'<br>
</strong><br>
Abe the Abandoned turns his head slowly toward you but his eyes never come into
focus. You can't<br>
tell if he's looking at you, behind you, or right in front of his own face. Then
,suddenly, he shouts at<br>
the top of his lungs, 'HOOOOKAAAHEEEEYYYY! I AM [ABE]!'<br>
<br>
You say, <strong>'Who are you abe?'<br>
</strong><br>
Abe the Abandoned says 'Nothing is hidden. All is discernible if you only know
where to look and<br>
you have the right [eyes]. Don't be angry with me if you can't get your eyes
right to see what you're<br>
looking for. I'd lend you mine but I don't wear the same size.<br>
<br>
You say, <strong>'What eyes?'<br>
</strong><br>
Abe the Abandoned begins to draw a picture in the mud with his finger although
it doesn't seem to<br>
make any sense at all. He points to his picture and nods approvingly at you,
saying, 'You see? The<br>
curtains fell and it was naught but a dream upon a landscape that we thought we
knew. The dream of<br>
the [Combine] fulfilled when we finally trimmed our fingernails and looked into
the mud. And now<br>
we are abandoned, in a world that none can see, no one has the eyes.'<br>
<br>
You say, <strong>'What is the combine?'<br>
</strong><br>
Abe the Abandoned shakes his head in amusement and says, 'Heheheh, yeah, you'd
think so,<br>
wouldn't you? But I guess not'<br>
After a few minutes, Abe will speak again. Be patient! :)<br>
Abe the Abandoned says 'Shaman? My time will soon be at hand and I fear I will
never see our<br>
friends again. But the arrow must be given, our holy broken arrow. Shaman, will
you bear our<br>
obligation and [give them the arrow]? You will know who to give it to when it is
time.<br>
<br>
You say, <strong>'Yes i will give them the arrow'<br>
</strong><br>
Abe the Abandoned removes a quiver slung across his shoulder and solemnly hands
it to you without<br>
a word.<br>
A few minutes later . . .<br>
Abe the Abandoned suddenly gasps and says, 'I have found it! I know the answer!
Come with me<br>
and I will tell you. Eyes are everywhere and this knowledeg is not for everyone.
Finally my centuries<br>
of waiting are over hahahaha! Follow me Shaman!<br>
<br>
Stay glued to that spot. <strong>DO NOT follow him</strong><br>
<br>
After or before Abe spawns, a greater spirit also spawns . . .<br>
a greater spirit begins to cast a spell.<br>
a greater spirit's body pulses with energy.<br>
<br>
You say, <strong>'Hail a greater spirit'<br>
</strong><br>
a greater spirit says 'You have walked the path of patience and you now know
what to expect. We<br>
are watchers. Our eyes are everywhere and we must be patient and quiet else we
may miss what<br>
could be harmful. Can you sit still quietly and wait for just the right moment,
then open your eyes<br>
with a fury and act with all the energy you have cultivated? Timing is
everything, and without<br>
patience you cannot be sensitive to timing. You have shown your patience here
and we believe you<br>
are ready to walk the [next path].<br>
<br>
You say, <strong>'What is the next path?'</strong><br>
<br>
a greater spirit says 'You know trust and patience. But before we can allow you
to act in our name,<br>
we must know that when you do decide to act, you will make the right choices. We
must ask that<br>
you now walk the path of wisdom. You must walk to the great plains and search
out one of us. He is<br>
a wanderer, and it is his nature to drift with the winds and weather doing what
he can to ensure<br>
understanding and longevity to all that respect their home. He will not be easy
to find, though, and<br>
you must remember what you have learned down here to succeed in finding him.
When you do, give<br>
him this gem and follow his instructions.<br>
<br>
You will receive a &quot;small gem&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>The Test of Wisdom<br>
</strong><br>
Head to West Karana. Look for a wandering spirit (looks exactly like a wisp).<br>
TIP: You can stand at neg 500 neg 5300 in West Karana and he will path by you.<br>
I've now done this twice and never waited more than 20 - 30 min tops. He will
also<br>
path by Tower 2, actually colliding with it on his journey. Just keep looking<br>
around so he doesn't slip by you. . . . - Belgar<br>
<br>
Once spotted, run up to him and Hail him repeatedly at close range to get him to<br>
stop moving.<br>
<br>
You say, <strong>'Hail a wandering spirit'<br>
</strong><br>
a wandering spirit stops and flashes brightly for a moment. It seems to be
regarding you with<br>
interest.<br>
<br>
<strong>Give the &quot;small gem&quot; to the wandering spirit.</strong><br>
<br>
a wandering spirit says 'Oh, it is you, shaman! Good! You must hurry before it's
too late. Go now to<br>
the Mountains they call Rathe and find them! They need your help quickly! They
will know you<br>
when they see you and instruct you on how you can help, but you must hurry!<br>
Your faction standing with TrueSpirit got better<br>
You gain experience!!<br>
<br>
Head to Rathe Mountains. You'll find Tabien the Goodly (approx level 32) at loc<br>
pos 6300, pos 1550. If you talk to him, the conversation is as follows:<br>
<br>
You say, <strong>'Hail Tabien the Goodly'<br>
</strong><br>
Tabien the Goodly says 'Oh thank Marr you are here, Waring . I was beginning to
think I would be<br>
abandoned in my time of need. I have a [task] for you to complete in the name of
my patron<br>
Mithaniel Marr.<br>
<br>
You say, <strong>'What task?'<br>
</strong><br>
Tabien the Goodly display his shield that must once have been shining and regal
but is now scoured<br>
in cuts, dents, and chipped paint. He says, 'This shield is known as Marr's
Promise. It is a sacred relic<br>
that was actually used by one of Mithaniel's angels on the Plane of Valor. Its
value to our church is<br>
immeasurable and I have been charged with the protection of it. However, a
patriarch of the false<br>
god, Bertoxxulous, is after my shield and me. He must be stopped! Please,
destroy him and bring me<br>
proof of his death.<br>
<br>
The other one is Glaron the Wicked (approx level 32), his loc is pos 2900, neg
1900.<br>
If you talk to him, the conversation is as follows:<br>
<br>
You say, <strong>'Hail Glaron the Wicked'<br>
</strong>&nbsp;<br>
Glaron the Wicked says 'Are you the one they sent to help our cause? I should
have known they<br>
would send a green witch doctor to serve Bertoxxulous and myself. Very well, you
will have to<br>
suffice. I have a [task] you must fulfill if you wish to know the blessing of my
god and impress your<br>
masters.<br>
<br>
You say, <strong>'What task?'<br>
</strong><br>
Glaron the Wicked brandishes a long, wicked-looking bone dagger and there is a
horrid, diseased<br>
stench as soon as he unsheathes it. He draws another blade, shorter and wider
than the first, of<br>
blackened bone with a larger than normal hilt, obviously for defense. He says,
'This festering blade<br>
is called Woe, and this scorched one is called Envy. They were created on the
Plane of Decay by<br>
Bertoxxulous' own hands. He has judged me worthy of the protection of such holy
relics. However,<br>
there is one in these very mountains who seeks to destroy these relics. End this
idiot follower of<br>
Marr's life and bring me proof.'<br>
<br>
Now both these guys are fools, what do we do with fools? <strong>We kill them.</strong>
Take their<br>
items (Envy, Woe and Marr's Promise) back to West Karana and give all three to<br>
the wandering spirit at the same time.<br>
NOTE: Marr's Promise will not fit into any bag, except either a Tinker's Bag or
a<br>
Large Sewing Kit, for it's huge size.<br>
NOTE: Conversation with Glaron and Tabien is not required to finish the quest.<br>
You may, if you wish, simply kill them outright.<br>
<br>
a wandering spirit says 'You are close to passing the test, keep up the good
work.<br>
a wandering spirit says 'You are close to passing the test, keep up the good
work.<br>
a wandering spirit says 'It is unfortunate that it came to this, but nothing
else was to be done. Both<br>
paragons had lost sight of their virtures to protect the items given to them.
The mere protection of<br>
these material belongings was not as important to Mithaniel Marr or Bertoxulous
as it was that they<br>
act with righteousness in their minds and purpose in their hearts. You saw this
and acted<br>
accordingly. For that, we will reward you with the three treasures made into one
to ward off the<br>
falsehood of possession, the [Shield of Falsehood]. You have walked the path and
now, as your<br>
final test, we must set you along one [last path].<br>
Your faction standing with TrueSpirit got better<br>
You gain experience!!<br>
<br>
You say, <strong>'What shield of falsehood?'</strong><br>
<br>
a wandering spirit says 'Yes, I have taken Marr's Promise along with Woe and
Envy and fashioned<br>
them together to create the Shield of Falsehood. Wield this in defense of
possession and the<br>
weakness that comes with hoarding treasure instead of using it to accomplish
your goals. May it<br>
serve you well, Barbarian.<br>

You say, <strong>'What last path?'</strong><br>
<br>
a wandering spirit says 'You have trusted us along the paths we have set before
you. You have been<br>
known to be patient and await the right moment. And now, you have learned the
wisdom to act in<br>
our best interest. However, one last path awaits, to determine if you have the
ability to act out what<br>
must be done. There are many troubles about the world we try to rub out but none
is more serious<br>
than the curse on what the wasichu call the Emerald Jungle. Go there and find
one of our spirits.<br>

<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Ahh, you live, shaman! I am glad the beasts of this jungle

However, we must ask<br>
you to walk one more path before you can become a true Heyokah. With trust, one
can focus on<br>
what is important. With patience, one can perceive what is harmful. With wisdom,
one can know<br>

Spirit Sentinel says 'Good, good, Do you know this place, Waring , this forest?
The wasichu call it<br>
the Emerald Jungle, but we know it only as the terrible place. Where there is no
spirituality, we are<br>
weak. The lost city in the middle of this jungle is a great void of belief not
only absent of spirituality,<br>
but actually draining it from others. We are here to neutralize that void. The
void is like the sky, and<br>
nothing escapes its gaze. If it senses us, it will drain us away and sometimes
it turns our minds,<br>
making us [like the wasichu], crazy for things with no meaning.<br>
<br>
You say, <strong>'What like the wasichu?'</strong><br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Yes, there are some of us who have turned their backs on
our world and struggle<br>
for possesions and power over others. These lost ones are our brothers and we
cry for them. Our<br>
hearts are in pain like bleeding wounds when we think of them. The path of might
will lead you to<br>
one of our lost brothers. We are afraid there is nothing we can do for him now,
so you must<br>
eliminate him when you [find him].<br>
<br>
You say, <strong>'How do i find him?'</strong><br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'He left us long ago and walked the land for ages. He soon
met a man, one of the<br>
pointy-ears that live underground. This man was like a void just liike the one
over that terrible place<br>
now. Our Brother-Friend was attracted to this man's desire and ambition. He no
doubt thought that<br>
he could get what he wanted in service of this [dark point ear] who denied his
own creator.<br>
<br>
You say, <strong>'What dark point ear?'</strong><br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'After our brother began traveling with this point-ear,
they became shrouded in a<br>
darkness we could not peer through. The point-ear was a powerful being and we
soon lost their trail.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We have no idea where he could be now. Although, after all these centuries, he
has no doubt been<br>
gathering and cultivating his wealth and power. He must be an incredibly
influential being at this<br>
point. Find this point-ear and draw our brother out, then destroy him and bring
us proof. We await<br>
your return in somber mourning.<br>
<br>
Head to Mistmoore. Find the wolf spirit, Black Dire. He is STRONG and he has 4<br>
slighty weaker wolves as his four guardians. Black Dire hits hard and fast for
up to<br>
200 HP per swipe, so use extreme caution.<br>
Black Dire is not a timed spawn, but you can kill the Advisor in the general<br>
vicinity of the Library (location 19 on EQAtlas map) and Black Dire will repop<br>
each time you do so.<br>
Black Dire is by the ramp leading up to the castle but you don't go up ramp.<br>
Instead, head all the way up the canyon that passes under the bridge. At base of<br>
cliff you will see 4 wolfs and Black Dire in the middle. In order to get a
response<br>
from the wolf you have to con Warmly. He is truespirit faction. When you walk up<br>
to him and hail him this is what he says:<br>
<br>
Black Dire says 'So, you've come. I suppose my brothers have sent you to lead me
back to their<br>
flock. Those fools are so blinded by their devotion they know nothing of life.
If they only knew the<br>
power I've become, the luxuries I've amassed, the pleasures I've known, they too
would leave that<br>
sour and unrewarding existence in seconds. You know, you could come to know what
I have,<br>
shaman. You found me, which speaks of your intelligence; we could use you. What
do you say,<br>
Waring ? [Will you join] my master Mayong Mistmoore?<br>
<br>
You say, <strong>'I will NOT join you'</strong><br>
<br>
Black Dire says 'Good shaman, now bare your neck that I may show our master your
devotion in<br>
death. The more blood you spill upon the grass, the more impressed our Lord
Mistmoore will be.<br>
Then maybe, just maybe, you will be allowed to scour our kitchen floors in the
eternity of unlife.<br>
TEAR him to pieces, my wolves!<br>
Black Dire bites YOU for 200 points of damage.<br>
Black Dire bashes YOU for 60 points of damage.<br>
Black Dire bites YOU for 200 points of damage.<br>
Black Dire bites YOU for 200 points of damage.<br>
Black Dire begins to cast a spell.<br>
YOU writhe in the grip of agony.<br>
Ah well, no easy task killing Black Dire and his friends. It has also been
reported<br>
that conversation with Black Dire is not necessary. Killing him outright will
work<br>
just as well. Also, if the accompanying wolf guardians are green to all in the
party,<br>
it is reported that Black Dire can be pulled without agroing his guardians.<br>
<br>
Once you kill Black Dire, loot his pelt.<br>
Return to the Sentinel Spirit in Emerald Jungle, loc +1250, +300.<br>
<br>
You say, <strong>'Hail Spirit Sentinel'<br>
</strong><br>
Spirit Sentinel begins to weep softly as he sees the pelt, battered and bloody.
After a few moments,<br>
he says, 'We can only hope his passing was quick and painless. The Dire was
powerful and yet you<br>
overcame him. Always remember that when you became [Heyokah], it was the passing
of a noble,<br>
yet misguided being that allowed you to do so. You should hold a special place
in your heart for him<br>
and what he was in life. To help you remember him, we will fashion this pelt
into a pair of boots and<br>
give them to you.<br>
With every step you take, you must think on the Dire, else his death be in vain
forever.'<br>

You say, <strong>'What is heyokah?'</strong><br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Yes, you have walked the Path of the Heyokah to its end.
You have become<br>
what few have and we will now call to you as Heyokah Duhara . From now on, you
are a direct link<br>
between the spirits and man. Whether your goals are to help us or master us, you
are welcomed.<br>
Though there is little time for celebration. Do you feel the darkness of this
place, the forest? To eyes<br>
not trained to see beyond physical appearances, it seems like any other forest.
But you know, as do<br>
we, of the mantle over the city threatening all of us. We must [rub it out].<br>
<br>
You say, <strong>'How can we rub it out?'</strong><br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'There are many such mantles scarring the universe and each
is very different<br>
from the last. Removing them requires that we learn how they were created and go
about reversing<br>
the damage done. We cannot enter under the mantle for long which is why we
search out Heyokah<br>
such as yourself. We need you to enter the city and find out what you can about
the [city's demise].<br>
We hope you will do this for the cause of balance but if you desire none but
your own power, we<br>
shall grant that as well<br>
<br>
You say, <strong>'What about the city's demise?'</strong><br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'It was known as Torsis. During its history it amassed
great wealth and power yet<br>
it eventually crumbled. No one understands what happened. The men of the world
ask themselves<br>
how a nation as successful as Torsis could ever fall. Some blame plague,
internal unrest, the constant<br>
encroachment of the forest, and marauding bands of monsters but we alone know
what happened.<br>
Just as Tabien and Glaron lost sight of their spiritual paths, so did Torsis.
Without the awe and<br>
inspiration of that which was greater than themselves, they eventually withered
away. The mantle<br>
was born long before the last days, though, and what we need to learn is [how it
all began].<br>
<br>
You say, <strong>'Tell me how it all began'</strong><br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Excellent! Go into the city and gather what evidence you
can. The ghosts who<br>
still walk the streets may hoard precious memories that will aid us. Take this
booklet and combine<br>
what you find in it. Then bring me the completed report. From there, we will
know where to look<br>

</strong><br>
You must now acquire the following six reports from the City of Mist. Five of
the<br>
six messages drop from skeletons, golems and goos at the zone, but the Student's<br>
Log is only found on a Spectral Courier.<br>
<br>
Personal Diary Page, identifies as &quot;Report Information 1 of 6&quot; in
Lizardman. It reads:<br>
I heard last night that there was some kind of commontion at the castle. Guards
were<br>
shouting, spells went off throughout the halls and many died. Some say there was
an<br>
assassination, some say a band of frogloks attacked under the command of a
dragon,<br>
some even say there was some divine intervention. I have no idea why any god
would<br>
strike against Lord Rak`Ashirr. He is a paragon fro the cause of Cazic-Thule. I
hope<br>
whatever it was sticks to attacking the castle and not my shop though.<br>
<br>
Crier's Scroll, identifies as &quot;Report Information 2 of 6&quot; in lizardman.
It reads:<br>
Hear of all Torsis! Our beloved Lord Rak`Ashiir will be appointing another High
Priest<br>
into the Cazic-Thule clergy in two days. A festival will be held in honor of the
event<br>
and the High Scale will be present to judge various contests of skill in arms.
Booths will<br>
be set up selling various wares and food to all. Cazic guide us all.<br>
<br>
Merchant's Letter, identifies as &quot;Report Information 3 of 6&quot; in
lizardman. It reads:<br>
The list should all be in order except for the swatches of silk. I won't need
such a large<br>
order in this quarter. Her Divinity Drian made it known to me that they would
not need<br>
as many new robes this coming season as &quot;none were quite ready to don
them.&quot; My<br>
colleagues have all been confirming that the church is buying less and less
these days. It<br>
seems Rak`Ashiir has decided the royal donation to be cut. However I'm sure
we'll find<br>
new customers soon and our orders will be back to normal shortly.<br>
<br>
Written Annoucement, identifies as &quot;Report Information 4 of 6&quot;. It
reads:<br>
Hear all Tosis! It is with great regret that we inform you of our Queen
Neh`Ashiir's<br>
disappearance. Our best scouts have begun searching the surrounding countries
for her<br>
trail. The Lord Rak`Ashiir also authorized the hire of mercenaries to venture
into the<br>
Froglok Territories to search for traces of the Queen. All interested parties
should report<br>
to the royal Quartermaster's office. Fear not citizens, our Queen will be found.
Wisdom<br>
guide us.<br>
<br>
Priest's Diary Page, identifies as &quot;Report Information 5 of 6&quot; in
lizardman. It reads:<br>
Well it appears our Lord Rak`Ashiir in his &quot;wisdom&quot; has cut our
church's donation yet<br>
again. He claims it is to bolster the ranks of our garrison as many were wipe
out during<br>
the Froglok incursions. However, I see more and more soldiers everyday, more
that I<br>
ever have. And they are all equipped in the best armors the city's smiths can
craft. This<br>
along with the recent replacement of our Bishop Screks with that coin grubber
Biliaz<br>
leads me to suspect our King is planning on all but destroying our church
entirely. I<br>
don't understand it, perhaps his missing Queen has driven him mad.<br>
<br>
Student's Log, identifies as &quot;Report Information 6 of 6&quot; in Lizardman.
It reads:<br>
Missed mass again today. This is the third time this week now. It is a worthy
sacrifice<br>
however as I was able to attend the Master's National Coin exchange class.
Perhaps the<br>
clergy will change the time of their masses, then I'll be able to attend
regulary.<br>
Although with the appointment of the new Arch Priest it appears mass may be<br>
discontinued altogether. I honestly hope so. I could attend many more classes as
well as<br>
spend more time rubbing elbows with merchants at the bazaars. I think I'll have
to miss<br>
tomorrow's mass as well. I heard the Laughing Leech Guild is taking members
again.<br>

<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Ahhh good, let us hope what you have found will point us
in the right direction.<br>
Hmmm...this is interesting. It appears the disappearance of the first queen may
have caused<br>
Rak'Ashiir's faith to decline. From there, the first King Rak laid down the
groundwork for the city's<br>
eventual demise. We need to learn what happened to the queen. Perhaps bringing
this knowledge to<br>
the King's now cursed form will lift the mantle. We've learned that the last
lord of Torsis, Ghiosk,<br>
was a bit of a historian. Find him and see what you can learn about the queen.
Take what you find to<br>
my brother here In the jungle beneath the murky waters of a pond.<br>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="-1"><strong>The Three Books of Lord
Ghiosk</strong><br>
<br>
You must kill Lord Ghiosk in the City of Mist and bring the three books drops to
a<br>
Spirit at loc: +3685, -640 in Emerald Jungle. Reports indicate he's no slouch,
so<br>
bring 3 full groups of your uber friends (level 55 +) to the party.<br>
<br>
The Three Books Lord Ghiosk drops (accurate Iksar translation):<br>
<br>
Book 1<br>
Neh Ashiir's disappearance will always be cloaked in mystery. We of Torsis have
a<br>
saying that goes &quot;Neh's chances&quot;. We all know this is used to define
an innumerable<br>
variable but not many know of its relation to the event in the early years of
our fair city.<br>
For as many people as there were in Torsis there were that many theories
regarding Neh<br>
Ashiir's disappearance. Others say there were political tensions between the
queen and<br>
her lord, so much so that she had to leave to escape death. And for good measure
a few<br>
pointed to the stars and said that people from beyond the sky took her. One
thing all<br>
agreed upon however is that the relationship between the royal couple was
decaying.<br>
Political scrutinizers noted small personal habits between the two that implied
a<br>
separation of intimacy during their public appearances. Many even tie the highly<br>
publicized Crusade of Kirn into the disappearance of Neh as Kirn left the city
only a<br>
few weeks before. It is recorded in many texts that the visage of Rak' Ashiir
reflected<br>
his despair over his wife's vanishing although it is a well known fact that it
was mostly<br>
an act played by the King to keep up his illusion of nobility. Perhaps one day
we will<br>
find the truth but at this point it would mean little to the public.<br>
<br>
Book 2 - Keeper of the House's Log<br>
1. New wash basins must be acquired. Servant Hujin will see the Quartermaster
and<br>
place the order tomorrow.<br>
2. The chandelier in the main hall was finally repaired tonight. Payment must be
sent to<br>
the contract holder tomorrow.<br>
3. Advisor Snith ordered that I personally find and acquire 3 dozen finely made
vials.<br>
What they are for he would not explain and was very firm that I do this as
quickly as<br>
possible. Best to make haste to fulfill the order, rumours abound of the
Advisor's<br>
mastery of the arcane.<br>
4. We've been low on candles for the last week. There is no explanation for the
shortage<br>
of wax says our civilian contract holder. Perhaps I should send a Palace Reaver
escort<br>
with the next pick up crew. The craftsman may have the intelligence to figure
the<br>
symbolism.<br>
5. It is imperative that we return the High Scale's Icon to the church as
discretely as<br>
possible. If Rak Ashiir returns from his journey early and discovers it was
found in the<br>
royal bedroom it may prove disastrous. I cannot decide whether to place it
ourselves<br>
with the help of our Black Guard, or to approach one of our contacts in the
church. The<br>
less people that know of this the better. It might be prudent to ..remove.. the
servant<br>
who found it within the sheets.<br>
<br>
Book 3<br>
Throughout the history of the High Scale it was common for the knights to
practice<br>
complete celibacy. It wasn't until the controversial Kirn was given the hallowed
title<br>
that contact between the sexes became tolerated. While Kirn wasn't the mightiest
of the<br>
High Scales he was able to achieve many great victories in the name of our Lord
of<br>
Fear. One being the battle known as the Bone Rending when Kirn lost his fabled
whip,<br>
Thriaxis' Tail, as was still able to defeat scores of his enemies using his
hands only.<br>
Before this battle many believed Kirn could not fulfil his duties as a leader
and patriot<br>
for the people.<br>
However Kirn's might and his lecture on the use of females in religious crusade
and<br>
duty convinced the public that celibacy had its place in divinity but
non-celibacy also<br>
had a place and value within the church. A shrine depicting Kirn among many
women<br>
was constructed in remembrance of his controversial reign although his corpse
was<br>
never brought back for burial as it was lost far across the ocean among distant
brothers<br>
on faith.<br>
<br>
<strong>Bring the three books Lord Ghiosk drops to a Spirit at loc: +3685, -640

<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Hmmm, it appears the queen's disappearance wasn't as
random as we thought. It<br>
also looks as if this High Scale were having some sort of affair with Neh. We
have little but<br>
speculation at this point, so making it known to Nak'Ashiir would do nothing.
Perhaps finding the<br>
resting place of the High Scale will show us more of what really happened. We
suspect the icon<br>
mentioned in this log could now be located in the city's old temple. Find the
icon and bring it to<br>
Kirn, wherever he is. Tell us what you learn afterwards.<br>

Go into City of Mist.<br>
Go across the bridge.<br>
Open the gate.<br>
Turn right.<br>
Go straight forward through 2 arches.<br>
<br>
In the last room you will find a temple with a waterfall running down its side.<br>
Stay in that courtyard of temple, and pull skeletons, etc., from the first door
you<br>
see at the base of the temple.<br>
<br>
Open the door. Inside is another door directly in front of you, do not open this<br>
door, it leads to top of temple. Look instead to the right, where three
skeletons<br>
spawn. Pull these skeletons to courtyard and kill them.<br>
<br>
Go back into door, head right and ye will see a room set below ground level with<br>
three phantoms in it, standing on a raised dais. Pull and kill these phantoms.<br>
There are two doors beside the dais, one opening to the left and one opening to
the<br>
right. Choose the left door. Inside is a small room with no monsters inside, and
a<br>
small bag on the floor in the left corner. Click on the bag, you now have the
High<br>
Scale Icon. Gate out.<br>
<br>
Using Invisibility to Undead potion (Unlife Awareness) will get you past the
last<br>
three skeletons and phantoms. They will still scowl at you, ready to attack, but
it is<br>
a bluff. They will NOT be able to see you.<br>
<br>
Be warned, however, as the golems of the area can see through Invisibility to<br>
Undead, and you may run across a couple on the way to the temple area.<br>

<br>
IMPORTANT CAUTION: Lord Rak hits with a 2000 hp area affect spell!<br>
Recommended 3 mage fire pets works nicely. Once Rak has spawned from the<br>
Reaver:<br>
1) Park the questing shaman and the mage fire pets around Lord Rak<br>
2) Move the rest of the raiding party to the opposite side of the room.<br>
3) Questing shaman hands Lord Rak the Tear. Rak will AGRO<br>
IMMEDIATELY, use his AOE on you (likely killing you), but also<br>
agroing the Fire Pets on him.<br>
4) Have party stay back and watch the show while healers keep the<br>
Fire Pets healthy. If other mobs pop, the party can attack them, but be<br>
sure you DO NOT use AOE on those mob pops to avoid agroing Rak<br>
on the party.<br>
5) The quest shaman should not move toward raid party, but rather<br>
stand there and try to heal yourself. You'll probably die quickly from<br>
the AOE. Have a cleric resurrect you back as soon as possible, loot the<br>
&quot;Iksar Scale&quot; and get party out. We fought our way back to zone, but<br>
evac works as well of course.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Spear of Fate<br>
</strong><br>
<strong>Take the &quot;Iksar Scale&quot; to the Spirit Sentinel Wolf at loc:
+3685, -640 in Emerald<br>
Jungle.</strong><br>
<br>
NOTE: The following conversation is not necessary. You may, if you wish, simply<br>
hand the Iksar Scale to the Spirit Sentinel and receive your Spear of Fate.<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'What is this? The scale of Rak'Ashiir's father? Then Rak
has repented his<br>
mistake? But why is the mantle still in place? If Rak has repented, then the
mantle should have<br>
dissolved since he was the one who initiated its construction. But is its
initiation the key? How could<br>
we have been so blind? Kirn said Rak'Ashiir had the blood of his people on his
hands but that is<br>
false. Rak merely pointed to a path that would lead them to destruction. It was
the people who chose<br>
to follow.<br>
<br>
You say, <strong>'What is lost?'</strong><br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'The mantle was the product of thousands of faithless
individuals. Not the single<br>
shroud we believed existed. Torsis is now truly cursed for all eternity as a
great stain upon the<br>
universe. Today is a sad day, indeed. However, some good can still come of this.
Your sacrifice and<br>
spiritual devotion in this matter have become legendary. You have waited for us
at the bottom of the<br>
ocean. You have rubbed out a mighty rogue spirit. You have endured the black
hole of Torsis and<br>
entered the a bode of Fear itself to save a child from eternal suffering. It is
only fitting that we<br>
reward you with our greatest treasure, the [Spear of Fate].<br>
<br>
You say, <strong>'What of the Spear of Fate?'</strong><br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'The spear was constructed millennia ago by Thalger, the
first human Heyokah.<br>
One of the most destructive wasichu of Norrath, Miragul, as he is known, had
been traveling the<br>
world searching out all known magic. Wherever he went, he discovered and
experimented with all<br>
forms of dangerous magic. Most of the world cannot even fathom what the Arch
Necromancer was<br>
capable of. He had haphazardly discovered a way to directly create a mantle of
negative spiritual<br>
energy similar to what curses Torsis. He himself had willed into existence one
of these [black<br>
holes].<br>
<br>
You say, <strong>'What of these Black Holes?</strong><br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Miragul often retreated to the frigid northlands to
experiment in solitude. It was<br>
here that he created a black hole. Unfortunately for the small tribes of men who
made the northlands<br>
their home, this new black hole threatened not only their livelihood but their
entire existence. The<br>
mantle was so powerful it not only drained the spiritual energy of everything
within its gaze, it also<br>
drained the life force as well. The tribes were threatened with complete
annihilation. But one<br>
[powerful shaman] stepped forward and struck against Miragul's mantle.<br>
<br>
You say, <strong>'What powerful shaman?'</strong><br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Thalger had been the first to pass our tests and the
timing was lucky indeed. We<br>
supplied him with materials needed to construct a weapon that could pierce the
very fabric of the<br>
[cosmos]. First, was the sharpened shoulder blade of an ancient lion matriarch.
Then Thalger found a<br>
young sapling for the shaft and shaped it over the course of 45 days using
nothing but his fingernails.<br>
He then split the top of the flexible shaft, lodged the blade into place and
bound them together with<br>
the tanned entrails of an ox. Finally, he adorned the spear with the magical
feathers of a an aviak<br>
elder.<br>
<br>
You say, <strong>'What of the cosmos?'</strong><br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Miragul's casting was strong but it was a force brought
into existence. This force<br>
was positive in nature, the opposite of nothingness. Even though it worked like
a void, it was still<br>
created by an imposition of will. We figured that if we could rupture the planar
boundary and create<br>
enough anti-existence or non-matter, the mantle might destroy itself. Thalger
volunteered<br>
immediately to pierce the mantle as no spirits could even get close to it. In
one act of devotion and<br>
singular purpose, Thalger rode the wind far above the land and with one colossal
arch ripped a<br>
[breach] across the planes.<br>
<br>
You say,<strong> 'What of the breach?'</strong><br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'The tear in the fabric of existence created enough
negative material to cancel out<br>
Miragul's abomination. Thalger's strike was so perfect that he cut just enough
planar material to<br>
destroy the mantle and nothing else. Unfortunately, Thalger himself was lost in
the process. All that<br>
was left was the spear that fell from the heavens to the ground where we
recovered it. We have kept<br>
it since then and now we wish you to have it. When you strike with it, you must
have the same<br>
singularity of purpose as did Thalger when he defeated Miragul's mantle. Thank
you, Heyokah.<br>
Congratulations, Heyokah! You have received your Spear of Fate!:</font></p>
