</font><font size="3">(Answer1: when a guild raid fails it is usually due to
poor organization)</font>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 7"><font size="3"><b>Leadership:</b>
    The will be one and ONLY one raid leader per raid. The raid leader is pre
    chosen before the raid is scheduled. DO NOT follow anyone else besides the
    designated raid leader as this could lead to getting the guild killed. DO
    NOT suggest alternate directions or places in group or guild chat during
    raid as this can distract guild members and lead to getting us killed, if
    you have a suggestion send it in a tell to the raid leader. Before a raid
    leader can lead a raid he/she must have a printed copy of the area we are
    raiding and advanced knowledge of the monsters to be confronted. If leading
    a raid say MOVING in guild chat before moving and say TANKS in guild chat
    when you see mobs that need to be killed.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 7"><font size="3"><b>Following:</b>
    Follow ONLY the pre chosen raid leader. There are two main guild orders
    issued by the raid leader. 1st Before movement from sitting the raid leader
    will say MOVING in guild chat, at that point you stand immediately and
    follow. 2nd when the raid leader says TANKS in guild chat all tanks move
    forward and initiate combat. DO NOT make suggestions to go in a different
    route or fight different mobs in guild or group chat, instead send a tell to
    the raid leader. Stay close to the group(s) at all times. DO NOT wander off,
    check on mobs, make pulls, or look for camps unless asked to by the raid
    leader.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 7"><font size="3"><b>Movement:</b>
    Everyone follows behind the raid leader. THE ORDER IS, Raid Leader, Tanks
    (all melee classes), Healers, Evacs &amp; Mez/Mana (clerics, druids, bards
    &amp; enchanters), Nukers (wizards, necromancers, magicians)</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 7"><font size="3"><img border="0" src="EQimages/order.gif" width="530" height="207"></font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 7"><font size="3"><b>Grouping:</b>
    When using multiple groups each group will have a leader who will be a tank
    if possible. The group follows the group leader and the group leader follows
    the raid leader staying in the order described above in movement.</font></li>
</ol>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 7"><font size="5">Looting: </font><font size="3">(Answer2:
this can ruin the raid after mobs are dead if not done properly)</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 7">&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 7"><font size="3"><b>ML Rules (Master
    Looter): </b>Cash off mobs, non magical items and non quest items are all
    ML&lt;Master Looter&gt; loot. During the raid each group will have a
    designated looter. At the end of the raid all items and cash looted we be
    divided up by the Master Looters and split between all participating members
    left at end of raid. If you leave early, disband, or log out before loot is
    split you forfeit your share of the loot and it gets split among remaining
    members &lt;people who go LD will be waited on&gt;. If you absolutely have
    to leave during a raid and want your share of loot or a specific item we
    will either roll for the item you are interested in then or give you a small
    share of loot dropped.
    During a raid please loot with split off.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 7"><font size="3"><b>Drops Over
    1000pp: </b>All magical drops and quest items worth over 1000 platinum
    pieces will be rolled for (/random 0 100) <b><i>OR</i></b> distributed by the raid leader. General protocol
    for distribution is, the
    highest level member that needs the item of the items usable classes will be rewarded first. If
    there are multiple &quot;highest&quot; level members that are the same level
    of the items usable classes those members roll (/random 0 100) and the
    highest number is rewarded the item. (example: if the items usable classes
    are WAR, SHD, PAL and the highest level in our raid out of those classes is
    our 55 PAL and 55 SHD, the 55 PAL and 55 SHD would roll off for the item.)
    This is known as the Need Before Greed system (NBG)</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 7"><font size="3"><b>Drops Under
    1000pp:</b> All magical drops and quest items worth under 1000 platinum
    pieces will be rolled (/random 0 100) for by all participating members.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 7"><font size="3"><b>Treasury:</b>
    Although this rarely happens. If we get a very good class specific item or
    quest drop and we have no member present of the usable class it will be held
    in guild vault for the highest level guild member of that items usable
    class.</font></li>

longest gets the item. If the highest level member has already received the same
item on a guild raid he/she is out of consideration for this item and it is
passed down to the next highest level. If the Guildmaster is present he will
distribute the items and this system is to be ignored.</p>
