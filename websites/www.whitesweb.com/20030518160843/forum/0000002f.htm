<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>It appears as of late that the officers and higher level members of the guild have been getting a lot of flack about the lack of activities for the guild.  While I understand this I need to iterate that even though we are the officers of the guild, this does not make os the &quot;Fun Squad.&quot;  We are not here to provide you with your entertainment.
<p>
If you would like us to raid someplace, then research the area (maybe even visit there to get the lay of the land) and then ask an officer for an motd that announces your desired time and place.
<p>
With prior warning, I am sure that many of the guild members will make an effort to get there.  I for one, and I think I can speak for others in the guild, am getting a bit tired of the endless &quot;is there anything going on tonight's&quot; when people log on.  
<p>
Please take it upon yourselves to get the ball rolling on a group or a raid spot.  Lasterfill took the initiative, and she has hosted some very fun evenings, of which I am proud to say I was in 2 of them.  
<p>
Grouping with the higher levels of the guild requires that you improve your skills and your level to the point that you can do that successfully.  The places that we group in are 45-60 zones like Maiden's Eye, Greig's End, and Kael among others.  We also do on occasion TOFS, but once again, you need to be of sufficient level and skill to make it enjoyable for you.
<p>
All of us that have made it to 45 plus have put the time into the game to get there.  We should not be required to get you to the point that you can group with us.  It is YOUR responsibility to make yourself the best you can be.  If we are nearby, and we can help you out, none of us would deny that help to you.
<p>
I understand that this game can be frustrating at times.  I have been there myself.  If you are frustrated then you need to find others of a like mind and level and check out some other zones.  The LOIO-FM-OT-DL loop gets boring, and the loot sucks.  Try some other places for new experiences.
<p>
There are over 130 different zones in the game, and many of you have only seen 10 of em.  EXPLORE, EXPERIENCE, ENJOY!!!
