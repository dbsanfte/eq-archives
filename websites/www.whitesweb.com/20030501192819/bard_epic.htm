Doppleganger's Head.<br>

Sorry if any of this looks confusing, but had to try to get everything in there
like I've seen all over the place.<br>
<br>
If any information on here is FALSE, please don't flame me or anyone else for
that matter, as this is just a helper for everyone to complete the quest...<br>
<br>
IMO we seem to be dragon slayers or something...but that's just me...Oh well,
good luck all you Bards out there.<br>
