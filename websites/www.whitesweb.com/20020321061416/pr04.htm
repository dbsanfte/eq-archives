<h1>Small Guild Raid on Deadside Guk</h1>
<h3><em>A great start with a bad ending.</em></h3>
<p><b>12-15-01</b> - This unplanned guild raid on Deadside Guk seemed perfect at
first. 5 of us started in on the this part of the dungeon. Although we tried to
invisibility to undead past most of them we wound up fighting them off instead.
This turned out to be no problem as we worked our way further and further. We
stopped by the Gargoyle room to pickup a carapiece for one of our members
quests. After getting the piece of the first 3 the pit stretched before us.
Deciding to take the alternate way down we headed to the right to try and locate
the stairs. However our group fell down the hole not far from the passage and
dropped all the way to the bottom level of Guk. There were a few decent items
down here that we could use so we headed for the executioners room. We started
fighting our way through the maze of stone walls and undead frogloks. When we
were almost to the room one of the undead froggies we pulled ran the long around
the maze to get to us and pulled a large group of froggies with more on the way.
The evac started almost immediately. We all appeared in Butcher Block Mountains,
a little ruffed up but all alive. As more members were now on we decided to turn
this into a legitimate raid. Members started joining up and by the time we got
back to Deadside we had 2 full groups of powerful nukers, healers and crowd
control. The groups pressed on in Guk blasting everything to dust before the
mobs really got to hit. Then there it was again. The Pit. The pit almost
mythically calling out to the stronger members of the group, daring them to defy
death. Everyone agreed to face the challenge and they dove fearlessly into the
pit. The first wave of froggies was met with a barrage of high damage AoE spells
and nukes bringing the froggies corpses raining to the ground. However the
froggies were not to be underestimated, 2 large waves of froggies seemed to pour
out of nowhere and start beating on the mana deficient groups. Evacs started
across all the groups but the determined froggies managed to interrupt all of
them. Doom closed in on us all. The main wizard and enchanter went down with
blinding speed. Those that could manage it gated out, yet most stayed to their
bloody death in the bowls of the Pit. Hopefully this has convinced all but the
strongest of us to stay away from the god forsaken Pit.&nbsp;</p>
