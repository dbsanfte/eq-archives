<p align="left">All crafted is gotten from 2 centaurs in South Karana in the
centaur camp, named Skakm and Ulan Meadowgreen. Here's what's available from
each:<br>
<br>
Skakm: Helm, Boots, Gauntlets, and Vambraces<br>
<br>
Helm-14ac, 6wt, +5 cha, +5 wis; For this you need a Fire Totem off of the goblin
shamans in Solusek A and 2 rubies .&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Boots-12ac, 6,5 wt, +5 agi; This requires a Frost Totem from the goblin shamans
in Permafrost on the northern side of Antonica (next to Halas) and 2 sapphires.<br>
<br>
Gauntlets-12ac, 5 wt, +5 str; You need an aviak charm off the avocets in South
Karana (they have their own city so you should find plenty of them there), and 2
star rubies.<br>
<br>
Vambraces-12ac, 6.5 wt, +2 sv disease, +2 sv poison, +1 str; These are a little
tougher to get than the gauntlets; you have to kill a griffon (lvl 31-33) for a
griffon eye (ONLY drops off griffons contrary to some other stories), and 2 fire
emeralds.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now for Ulan's pieces-Bracers, Breastplate, Greaves, and Pauldrons<br>
<br>
Bracers-10ac, 4 wt, +2 dex, +2 int; For this you need a bunch of optic nerves
off the Evil Eyes in the gorge, East Karana, or Runnyeye (any of the zones will
have these), and 1 sapphire. Most of the eyes are only around lvl 24-25, so you
can handle this pretty easily provided you have a high sv magic to avoid getting
charmed.<br>
<br>
Breastplate-22ac, 10 wt, +5 sta, 25hp; For this you need a Werewolf Talon (or
claw) from any werewolf (try Mistmoore at night , all the gyspies turn into
werewolves, and 3 rubies.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Greaves-14ac, 7.5 wt, +2 sv fire, +2 sv cold, +1 str; You need
the stolen circlet off a necro named trizdain (sp?) in Najena up in the
Lavastorm Mtns, and 2 star rubies (different from rubies).</p>
<p align="left"><br>
Pauldrons (shoulders)-12ac, 4.5 wt, +2 sv magic, +2 str; For this you need the 3
pieces of the &quot;Rune of Dwarves&quot; and a fire emerald. The Rune of
Dwarves pieces drop off the Evil Eye prisoners in Runnyeye I believe (sometimes
might drop off of gobs in RE, but I haven't seen that happen yet).</p>

the barbarian fishing village in lake rathe the 2 people that give the quest are
they 2 barbarians in armor near the totem looking thing. His name is Vyrnn but i
cant remember hers. But like any quest you walk up and say Hail and if your
faction is good enough they will tell you about the armor they make. Heres the
part that makes this quest just a little different you know that banded that
most of us shamans are wearing well u have to give it to them alonge with the
other pieces of the quest to get the armor so if your not wearing banded now u
will need to get some made. But anyway here goes the list for the stuff you need
to get your new armor made: Mail you will need 1 banded mail 2 dufrenite 1
lancer sword fish fin found in kedge keep 1 grizzlenot bark found in south
karana off a treant named grizzlenot. Leggings: banded legs 2 dufrenite 1 perma
snowball off a goblin wiz in perma 1 bonebarbs off a bonebarb skelie in unrest.
Boots: banded boots 2 dufrenite 1 ocr chief tounge found in lesser fay 1
tenticle terror spine found in najena. Helm: banded helm 2 dufrenite 1 glacier
bear pelt found in everfrost 1 ogre skin chamoise found on a lizard page in
cazic thule. Sleeves: banded sleeves 2 dufrenite 1 ghoul carrion found in unrest
1 charger hoofs found in south karana on what else but a centaur charger. Cloak:
banded cloak 2 dufrenite 1 basalt drake scale from rath mountains 1 driftwood
pipe from an island goblin chief in the ocean of tears. Gloves: banded gloves 2
dufrenite 1 mammoth rib from everfrost 1 griffene down feathers from north
karana. I seem to have missplaced my info on the bracers so I will have to add
that later. Since after reading this you are most likely saying what i said
'what in eq is dufrenite' its a jem that can be bought in halas at the potion

the Unkempt</a> (a fallen ranger) his faction is with outcast brownies, and
Unkempt Druids. Maldyn is the rarest spawn in the Rathe Mts. and is on a strange
spawn cycle that goes thru &quot;a drake, the generic place holder, Hasten
Bootstrutter, Brother Zephyl, and Maldyn the Unkempt&quot; I have read that
Maldyn will usually appear after Hasten has been killed, and that, Hasten
usually pops after 3-5 drakes. Complicating matters even more is that fact that
Maldyn is a roaming NPC. I have read reports that his place holder is at the
round rock near the Freerot zone near where the drake and Hasten usually spawn.
After Maldyn spawns he will then proceed North towards the Druid ring. Of
further note Maldyn is KOS to Giants and Cyclopse, and often the Giants kill
him, causing the players camping him much frustration.<br>
B) Retrieve part B of Morin's Bow from Slaythe the slayer, a froglok NPC found
deep within the Lower Guk on the Live Side. Turn in both parts of the bow to
Leaf Falldim and you will recieve the nice resist gear gloves.<br>

<p><b>Ivy Etched Boots</b><br>
<u>To complete the quest for the Ivy Etched Boots you will need to obtain the

A) Ronium<br>
B) Two pieces of Mistmore Granite from the gargoyles in MM. (one piece of
granite is used to make Ronium [see below], the second piece should be given to
Leaf Falldim, when the Bar of Ronium and the gold is turned in)<br>
C) 2000 gold (very encumbersome)
<p><b>*Additional Information*</b> The Bar of Ronium is not a drop item, but
rather is a side quest.<br>
<u>To Make Ronium you will need to do the following</u><br>
1) Obtain the mold from Lord Searfire [Dwarven Smith], in the Temple of Solusek
Ro. He must consider you amiably before he will deal with you. To raise faction
with him you can either hunt the shadowed men or you can give gold 30gp at a
time (very expensive) to an Erudite NPC in the Southern Desert of Ro until he
cons amiable to you. Once your faction is high enough return to the Temple of
Solusek Ro, and hail the Dwarven Smith and then say &quot;What Ronium&quot; and
then he will give you the sol cauldron, and then he will tell you the
ingredients that you must acquire to make the metal ronium.
<p>The ingredients to make Ronium are the following<br>
a)Melatite (Dropped by MB and MC Clockworks in Solusek's Eye aka Sol A)
sometimes you can buy this from the gnomes in Sol A because many players sell
them to the NPC's. This will prevent you from taking any faction hits with
Ak'Anon<br>
b) Two Bars of Enchanted Platinum [side note] you can buy the Platinum Bars in
the upstairs of the Blue building in North Freeport, then hire an enchanter of
at least lvl 24 to enchant the bars for you using their enchanter's enchant
platinum spell<br>
c) One Mistmoore Granite (Pieces of Mistmoore Granite can be found on Fouting
Gargoyles, Jeering Gargoyles or Leering Gargoyles in Mistmoore). The granite is
a rare drop off the Gargoyles outside of the castle, but is a common drop on the
Gargoyles inside of the castle.<br>
d) The Sands of Ro (from Sand Giants in the Oasis of Mar)<br>
e) The Soil of Underfoot (Get from the Priestess Ghalea in the Kaladim cleric's
guild for 4 fairy dusts [need at least amiable faction for this], you can raise
your faction with Priestess Ghalea by turning in skeleton bones (lot and lots of
them), to <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/realm/eqdarkforest/gall16.html">Gunlok
Jure </a>an NPC dwarf in the paladin's guild in North Kaladim. Also remember not
to kill faeries because you will need good faction with them later to complete
the Epic quest to Enchant your Trueshot longbow into the Raincaller. I would
advise buying the Fairy Dust or hiring another character to kill the fairies
<p>Once all of the ingredients have been obtained place them in the cauldron and
hit the combine button and you will get one bar of ronium. You do not need any
blacksmithing skill to combine these. Turn in the bar of Ronium, with the
Mistmore granite, and the 2000 gp to Leaf Falldim to recieve the boots.<br>

Please note that being plate , Iksar cannot wear Darkforge armor. All other SK
races can wear Darkforge.<br>
<br>
These are the Formulas that the Undead Knights will ask for. Make SURE that you
are giving these items to the right one. There are Two Undead Knights and the
both make different items so double check.<br>
<br>
Darkforge Gauntlets: left and right gauntlets + 1 bar of enchanted platinum.<br>
Darkforge Bp: Decayed Mail and Breastplate + 2 bars of enchanted platinum<br>
Darkforge Greaves: Left and Right Legplate (these look like arms) + 2 piece of
Melatite<br>
Darkforge Boots: Left and Right Boot + 2 fairy dusts<br>
Darkforge Bracer: Left and Right Bracer + 1 broken mino horn.<br>
Darkforge Helm: Decayed Visor and Helm + 2 broken freeport militia helms.<br>
Darkforge Vambraces: Left and Right Vambracers + 1 Qeynos Kite Shield<br>
<br>
Turning in the Left and Right Decayed Bracer, along with the horn will only
yield one Darkforge bracer, so you will have to complete the quest twice to
complete your set.<br>
<br>
Your quest should start in Cazic Thule and you should be looking for Lizzard
Crusaders, they are the only ones that drop decayed armor period. Crusaders are
around 30-34 *remember* they are SKs also. THEY WILL HT YOU for 300+ points.
Crusaders ALWAYS have pets. their pets are just like ours, skellies, which give
us and advantage, our lvl 9 spell sense the dead can be used to find the damn
Crusaders pet anywhere in the zone!@! of courst once you get pointed in the
direction for the pet its no telling where you will end up, We have seen
crusaders pop in every part of Cazic Thule. Remember that Crusaders are a RANDOM
spawn, meaning they have NO spawntime, No specific spawn area, etc.. they will
spawn wherever and whenever they fell like it. We sometimes only saw 1 in a
weeks time, then we have seen 20 in a weekend. just depends on if they are being
a pain in the ass or not. The best place we found to hunt Crusaders was 4cs,
excellent exp from 28-39 plus it is very controllable most of the time &gt; and
is soloable at around 36 37ish. Zealots are &quot;supposibly&quot; Place holders
for crusaders, however i dont see this as being true,,, ALL the time. heheh.
Lets face it, this is the crapiest part of your quest/adventure. get it over
with as quickly as you can. Remember when join groups outside your guild to make
sure that they know why you are hunting Crusaders and that you expect to roll
for decayed items. Dont trust people outside of your guild when it comes to
looting decayed armor. most people are fine, but i have seen people try and loot
the crusader and successfully get it while we were finnishing off the rest of
the mob, so watch your crusaders and the people that loot em! If you get pieces
that you dont need give a shout out so maybe lower levels can get started. If
more people did this it would make it a lot nicer for all that have to suffer
through this part of the quest.<br>
<br>
Qeynos Kite Shields: (Vambraces) There are 2 easy guards at the first guard
tower in North Karana, following the way from South Karana Stone Bridge. 2
kills, 2. Or auction and 9 times out of 10 you will find someone in your own
city that has one for sale. The shield you require is indeed a Qeynos Kite
Shield (not a wooden kite shield, or any other form). It has the flag of Qeynos
as it's graphic.<br>
<br>
Damaged Militia Helms: (Helm) Easiest to get from the patrolling guard (Ledshin).
Ledshin is the lowest gaurd in West freeport he is 28-32. Two low 40s sks can
take Ledshin with ease so you can judge by that. He hits for no higher than 50
and is fairly quick. He also resisits Dark a lot. Ledshin is INSIDE West
Freeport and unless you have extremly huge balls, you will want to take him out
in a safe place to avoid PKs and adds. A very safe location to fight Leshin is
in sopt #4 of this map; http://eqatlas.com/wfreeportmap.html. As you can see it
is a very quick easy run , With Invis of course, from the entrance of wfreeport
to this spot. i would recomend if you are not comfortable with this, create a
human character in freeport and look at how easy it is to get from entrance to
the sweet spot. Once you and your group have gotten in. WAIT. Ledshin will and
always does show up right at the entrance to spot #4 on the map. pull him and
kill him and you got one militia helm. The other gaurd that walks by his name is
Mizraen, he also carries a militia helm but he doesnt drop it all the time and
he is also 35-38 so he is quite a bit tougher. When you get the helm it will say
it is a &quot;Damaged militia helm&quot; that is okie thats what you want. Shows
you cracked em in the noggin, wh00t! This item is nodrop.<br>
<br>
Fairy Dust (DarkForge Boots) Its time to travel to lands you never thought you
would have to travel to. You are gonna need to get to FAYDWER, yikes lighties
all over the place. damn dirty things. However they have pretty decent zones.
Your best bet is to get a wizzard to TP you into Greater Faydark. http://eqatlas.com/greaterfaydark.html<br>
Once in Gfay. you will want to get the hell out of there quick. too many lightie
scum wandering around like a bunch of retards so quickly run along side of the
hill where you tp to and run to the Lesser Faydark zone.(its only a hop skip and
jump away)<br>
Now in Lesser Faydark follow the trail to the #2 faerie camp http://eqatlas.com/lesserfaydarkmap.html<br>
But to tell you a secret no faeries reside there anymore. they must have got
sick of the lightie stench. Along your way you will see Undead Sprites. KILL
THEM THEY HAVE YOUR FAIRY DUST@!!! where the faerie village use to be there now
is a TON of undead sprites of all different levels,, these are low level
creatures,, prolly 7-20 being the highest. They do agro bad too so you could
have 5 or so on you at a time. Watch for wandering brownies or brownie camps,,
the brownies in this level are high 30s mid 40s so watch it they are tough. Once
you have your fairy dust which should take long head back to Greater Faydark.<br>
<br>
Broken Minotaur Lord Horn (Bracer) You are almost there when you do your fairy
dust adventure you might as well make a day of it and get off that wretched
island. The Minotaur Lord horn is always dropped off of the Mino Lords in
Steamfont. They are a ONE spawn so if you are with a group and have to get more
than one, you will have to wait. They are reasonably difficult, but if you are a
good soloer you can take them alone at 33+, otherwise get another person around
your level to help and they should be no trouble. One thing to watch for is that
deep in the Mino caves (if you follow the left path) Mino Lords spawn at the
wheelborrow before the splits in that cave and wander, dangerously close to lvl
35 gnome necro, Meldrath. He wil have a pet also. Remember that the Minotaur
Hero is different from the Lord and a much higher level mob (mid to high 40s i
believe). if you got it do a group hug and TP your arse out of that filthy
lighie country.<br>
<br>
Melatite (Greaves) is found on the clockworks Model MA, MB, and MC ONLY. This is
a little harder quest item and require you to be patient and watch where you are
fighting!@ DONT FALL IN THE LAVA! Remember that the Clockwork MODEL MB has a
spell that knocks you back prolly 20 feet or so,, if your back is facing lava
and the MODEL MB hits you with that, you are going in the lava. This is the best
map i have seen of Sol A http://www.everlore.com/geography/solseka_map.asp<br>
The Clockworks that you want to fight are around lvl 30 or so, they are not that
difficult but with a bunch of adds can create a lot of dangers for you and your
group. BTW if you are a fatty sk like me.. YOU HAVE TO HAVE SHRINK NO MATTER
WHAT! you will not be able to make it through doors etc.. you have to have
shrink period. The MODEL M's are in the smack dab middle of the map close to the
CLockwork EXG. Melatite is not a quick drop either, it takes awhile to get 2
bars. Sometimes people will shout out to sell melatite but they want 50p per bar
or even 100p per bar. Its best just to get you own.<br>
<br>
Enchanted Platinum Bars (Darkforge BreastPlate and Gauntlets) I suggest creating
a Mule DE, i believe an Enchanter can get the highest Charisma. Spend as much as
you can on charisma and then give the enchanter 315p, you will get each plat bar
for 105p whereas you would usually have to pay 146-189p are the numbers i have
seen and heard of. just to save a few p. Now you have to find an enchanter to
enchant the plat,, one of the harder things to do in the quest. SHOUT SHOUT
SHOUT!! ask around and offer a reward. I gave 50p for all three bars to be
enchanted. Make sure you trust the enchanter you are about to intrust with 315p
for he will have to handle the plat bars to enchant them and could easily just
log and take your hard earned plat.</font>

<p align="left"><b><a name="Robe of the Lost Circle">Robe of the Lost Circle</a></b></p>
<p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="2">I've combined all the info from
the posts and have come up with a real quick summary and info on spawns and
such:<br>
<br>
1st - You must earn your purple headband in Qeynos. This can be easy or
difficult. First is the 4 gnoll pup scalps, gnolls are found in Qeynos hills and
North Qeynos. You get your white headband, then you must get 3 putrid rib bones,
found on most putrid skeletons, closest to Qeynos residing at the skeleton ruins
between Surefall Glade and BlackBurrow. Turn in your white headband and the 3
rib bones, and get your second, yellow headband. Yellow headband and the
blackburrow gnoll pelts... unruined, and 1 skin. Pelts are often found on
elites, commanders and burlys. Not as often found on guardsman... but can be
attained that way. Skins are found on Burly, elites*rarer*, and commanders. Turn
2 black burrow pelts and 1 skin and your yellow headband and achieve the 3rd
sash, the orange headband. This is the hardest part of the entire headband
quest, respectively though, not the purple. You have to gain 2 remains of fallen
brothers, and also the head of Ghanex Drah. Ghanex Drah is the easiest as he has
no place holder, and is a fairly easy necro at around level 25 solo... not
completely sure about that, but I was able to take him. The other remains is the
skull of brother Shren. Now, I found this while wondering on the southeast wall.
Near the shadowknights, just wandering, not completely sure of the place holder,
but I was told it was a shadow wolf. (Now to shorten some time, kill the shadow
wolf and try to get a shadow pelt :P) The other is the head of dareb. This is
found also a named gnoll. All around 20-25'ish. They are NOT nodrop but are
lore. You can probably pick em up for 100p considering they are a rather boring
1 hour camp at most. The one that drops the head of dareb can be wandering just
off of spires. Neither despawn very quickly. Now take the 2 heads, skull, and
orange headband back to Phin, and achieve the 4th headband, Red Headband. This
one is a bit hard in one aspect, camping High priestess Zaharn. She spawns in
Permafrost, in the king room, dropping Zaharns Coronet, without a rare. The
other item, skull of j'hentra can be found in SK or in Lake Rathe off of
embalmers near the SK zone. I found my Skull of J'hentra on an embalmer, but I
heard a certain shaman, name slipping me currently, drops it, although I have no
witnessed this. Dagger of Marnek is the 3rd item, found in Befallen, an old Monk
monastery, on the third floor. Found on a Thurmagist, who is a female Erudite...
Not just Necro Thurmagist, but The Thurmagist. Shes a necro, easily solo'd at
30. You will be returning to this room to retrieve Blackened Wand, who is
dropped by Priest Amiaz, who spawns in the same room as her. Watch out cause all
the necros will cast compact on them while you fight.<br>
<br>
After getting those items, bring them back to qeynos, give them to phin along
with your red headband, and get your fifth and final headband, the purple
headband. There is no blue... but there is a black, that can be found on Brother
QWinn and Zephyl for sure, although I have never fought Lu'Sun.<br>
<br>
Also, you will want to earn your freeport sash of order. I believe first is bone
chips, snake scales, rat fang, and low level items like that, easy way to find
out is hailing a guildmaster who distributes them. Second is not too difficult.
One catch, Legonnaire Bracers DO NOT DROP IN EC anymore. You can spend days
there, and will not see one. Only place is CrushBone, where they drop off about
every Orc Legonnaire. The third quest requires other items, trantuala chitin,
derv ring and GLS and prior sash... I believe. The 4th is blackened wand. I'm
not exactely sure, cause it is a bit... confusing. I myself had a friend, run in
and kill the guildmasters :P. 2 in the front are around level 30. Not too hard,
but guards to help. They drop red sash of order and newbie tunic.<br>
<br>
Other items you will need is Jonathans Whistling Warsong, 4p or so song from
Bard guilds in Freeport or Qeynos. Easy to attain.<br>
<br>
Another item is Shadow Silk. You will need tailoring skill in this, but I made
it with 2 skill in tailoring, with luck. I think the minimum is 20, although not
sure. You need a shadow wolf pelt from shadow wolves in SK or from Nektulos,
East commons, Misty Thicket.... or whereever else you find Shadow wolves. Not
too rare, but can be bought from other people for like 10p. You need Gather
Shadows, a necro invis spell... like a 4 gold spell or so. Found in most necro
guilds. Also a swatch of silk. Made by combining 2 spider silks, not spiderling
silks. Now, combine swatch of shadow silk, gather shadows and shadow wolf pelt
and you will get Shadow Silk.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, you have to attain Code of Zan Fi. This is found in Solusek Ro Dungeon B,
or Nagafens Lair, SolB... soldungb. He spawns in the king room, on the throne,
which the king does not :P. 30 minute spawn time, PH is normally a greater
kobold, not just greater kobold. I don't think ive seen anything else spawn
there. Sure, hes not too rare, but ive seen people camp him for hours. I've seen
him within 20 minutes of getting into the group*No idea how long they'd been
there*. Code of Zan Fi is ALL/ALL Primary secondary 2 str 1 weight. Looks like a
book. Take that book, and your purple headband to South Karana and look for
Brother QWinn. Qwinn walks fast. Ask someone to hail him still while you run to
find him.<br>
Return the code and the purpleheadband and you will reciever a nice chunk of
exp, 2 blue bubbles at level 30, and needle of the void, all/all .1 weight looks
like chipped bone rod.<br>
<br>
Now here the best part of all. Raster of Guk.<br>
<br>
I have camped him for about 10~ hours total, At 4 hour consecutive. Others were
at 2 hour or so periods. Raster drops Idol of Zan Fi. 3 str 3 wisdom, looks like
that orc divine aura item. 1 weight, all/all. Many people on my server now call
Raster a myth*hehe* even though we know he exists. He spawns outside of the
elder minotaur pit. He is on Live frog faction, and his PH is a greater minotaur
or a frog itself. Its normally the only mino that doesn't move, and he is next
to the firepot that does not have a flame in it. Theres a bunch of steps infront
of him, if that helps. He spawns every 20 or so minutes. But the best method I
have heard of is the 2 kill, 1 spawn method. You kill the placeholder twice in a
row, and then wait for the third to despawn. This is for the people who plan on
spending a lot of time on him. Instead of the 2.6 spawns per human hour, you
will get 3. A whole .4 more chances to get him. Which adds up after multiple
hours. Once you get his Idol, lucky, Take the Idol of Zan Fi and your red sash
of order to Brother Zephyl, he has a PH of Haste and a really black lookin drake
named somethin drake... I believe Obsidian. Hes not too hard, drops NODROP
Drakescales for another quest I am not aware of. I had a friend who camped
Zephyl, longer then they camped Raster for. Although I heard Zephyl was pretty
common. Give him both and you will get Rare Robe Pattern.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now take Needle of the Void, Jonathans Whistling War Song, Shadow Silk and Rare
robe pattern into a Large sewing Kit. You DO NOT need skill in tailoring to do
this *Thanks Verant*. So you can craft it easily. Everything in this quest are
not nodrop except for Code, Idol, Needle and RAre Robe Pattern. So you can buy
yourself most quest items. Code of Zan Fi is easy to FD outside of king, and
loot it. Idol is a little harder, you will need a group 35+ and about 45 to solo
effectively, while well equipped.<br>
<br>
Get your Robe and be happy, cause you're gonna have to get rid of it for Robe of
the Whistling Fists, and once you get attachted to that robe... Boom, its gone
for a stupid book :P You will have to use it for your Celestial Fists. Which
thanks to spoilers, can be achieved in a day or so after you get your Robe of
the Whistling fists with the correct guild. And about 18 of em. Though I aint
gonna go into a lot of detail about the epic, cause I havent completed it.<br>
<br>
Well good luck hope this is compiled well.<br>

<p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="2">I'm posting this for one reason
and one reason only. All the other walkthroughs about this quest that I've read
have been lacking in what might be considered some rather important areas. So,
I'll start at the top.<br>
<br>
In order to do this quest you have to be considered kindly by the
Clerics/Paladins of Tunare. The easiest way to do this is to do the muffin quest
in FP.<br>
<br>
While in FP turn in orc picks four at a time to Hallard in Hallard's Resales
until he gives you High Hold Keep lotto ticket #16568.<br>
<br>
Next thing you want to do is to collect the following:<br>
1 Sands of Ro - Found on Sand Giants in the Deserts of Ro.<br>
3 Faerie Dusts - Found on faeries in both Lesser Faydark and Greater Faydark.<br>
<br>
Next head to South Qeynos and talk to the woman in under the canopy tent in
front of the Lion's Mane Inn. She sells a Silk Evening Gown, purchase one, cost
is around 5pp.<br>
<br>
Now you need to head off to HighPass Hold. Go to the Golden Rooster and up to
the second floor. Follow the hall upstairs and you'll go around a curve, it'll
be the last door on your left. During the daytime the gypsy Wyle Brimlin is
inside of this room, wait until after dark and Marlin Shirtov will take her
place. Give the silk evening tunic to him and he'll give you a brass shackle
key.<br>
<br>
Next, head into High Hold Keep and give lotto ticket #16568 to Treasurer Lynn,
she's in the room behind the Jailer and the Banker, she'll give you a royal
suite key.<br>
<br>
Now, head up the third floor and open the locked door with your new key. Inside
is Tearon Bleanix. Just a word of caution so you don't jump out of your skin
like I did, he's a skeleton. Tell Tearon that &quot;All is not bright above the
clouds&quot; and he will give you Tearon's Bracer.<br>
<br>
Now head up the fourth floor and go into the hidden area behind the painting
that you face when you come off of the stairs, in this area you will find
Tyranna Slil, she's a DE with a whip. She'll pop in the room next to the guard
with the table and overturned chairs. Give her some time and she'll move into
the other room, by herself. Just a note here. This hidden area is considered
&quot;outdoors&quot; which means that a druid can use all of their spells,
including Harmony. When you kill her she drops a Fish Food Container. Put the 1
Sands of Ro, and the 3 Faerie Dusts (Unstacked), into this container and combine
it to get Fish Food.<br>
<br>
For the next part, a tracker is a MUST. Go to Lake Rathetear and find &quot;a
royal fish&quot;, it can be found swimming against the shores in varius places,
including around locations: 3600, 2500; 2500, 2200; and occasionally swimming
against a little island at 1450, 1900. Give the fish the food and Princess Lenya
Thex will spawn at the aforementioned island.<br>
<br>
Now, the Princess likes to swim, she will swim from that little itty bitty
island South until she hits the edge of the zone, and then teleport back to that
little island. My suggestion is to sit on the south side of the island and watch
underwater for her to pop, as soon as she does, hail her and she'll stop
swimming. Give her the brass shackle key and Tearon's bracer and she'll give you
an amulet of Thex.<br>
<br>
Now, trot yourself back to High Hold Keep and go talk to Tearon again. Now, what
you'll want to do is open his door, step inside and give him the Amulet of Thex,
then leaving the trade window up, step OUT of the room and put the suite key
into the trade window and hit Give. He'll proceed to give you the Silent Watch
Shield. The reason you step out is that if that door closes, you're stuck.<br>
<br>
Now to clear up some myths about this shield. No, having it on your back doesn't
allow you to bash when using a 2hs. And yes, it is a light source equivelant to
if not better than a Greater Lightstone, for us poor blind folks.<br>
<br>
Okay, that's my story and I'm sticking to it. It took me awhile to do this quest
and alot of frustration as sometimes Lenya will spawn and immediately despawn.
So be careful and if that happens, just petition it. Also, Lenya will stick
around for awhile until you give her the items or someone/thing kills her.<br>

<p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="2">Ok..to do this quest you need to
speak to the female trainer of the Clerical quests, and ask her about the
Reliant. She will tell you that this guy lived in Kithicor Woods untill his
house burned down yadda yadda yada. So make your way over to Kithicor and the
burned down house is roughy 1700 1100 (I think..if I'm wrong its the one between
the rivervale and west commons zones) usually there is clerics camped
there..making it very hard to get. The spawn rate is about 6-12 hours and once
it does spawn it's a diary in the form of a little bag on the ground. If you
read the diary it will tell you about how he hid the Ingot of the Reliant on a
stump in Kithicor. The stump is roughly -92.45 +3278.20, the spawn is said to be
6-12 hours there. Once you get the ingot and the diary travel to Lake Rathe and
head left from the zone to South Karana. You will see a cabin and inside the
cabin is the man the cleric told you about. Give him the diary and he will give
you the Icon of Reliant! Now you must buy two PLATINUM bars and get them
enchanted, then head back to the Temple of Ro, hand the cleric the pieces (put
the bars in seperate slots) and presto she will hand you brand new shiny golden
Boots of the Reliant! 6 vrs diease 9 ac 4.9 weight lore nodrop.<br>

<p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="2">Nivold Predd seeks help in
collecting the ingredients required to summon Dread. He requires the eye of a
griffon, some powder of reanimation, the brain of Ishva Mal and the toes of an
ice giant. Fetch him these items and you will receive a Dread Forged Shield.
Stats are: AC17 +5 STR/WIS, +10 CHA/MAGIC, +20 MANA ERU/HUM CLR Only).<br>
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ok, here is the
quest. I've attained all of the items which are needed for the quest which are,
ice giant toes, eye of griffon, brain of ishva mal, and<br>
powder of reanimation.<br>
<br>
1. Ice giant toes: common loot off of a level 40 or so ice giant right outside<br>
permafrost<br>
<br>
2. Eye of griffon: can be attained off of a griffon or grimfeather in NK, druid<br>
for tracking is recommended<br>
<br>
3. Brain of ishva mal: hardest part of the quest, best chance is to team up with<br>
some friends because down deep in paw is tough. It was myself a 51 cleric, 54
necro, 52 ranger, and a 49 druid. It was fairly easy with this combo but if<br>
your level 40-45 I suggest having a full balanced group (Including enchanter for<br>
mezzing)<br>
<br>
4. Powder of reanimation: when I did the quest just a few days ago I handed<br>
Khrix a greater lightstone (he's on 2nd floor btw). Then right after I handed it<br>
to him,'Khrix's abomination' spawned in the closet directly behind his. Easy<br>
kill for a level 51 but I suggest you clear the closet before handing him the
GLS so you only have to deal with the abomination. I would say abomination is<br>
about level 40. hits for around 90's if I remeber right.<br>
NO FACTION NEEDED FOR KHRIX'S ABOMINATION TO SPAWN, dubious is just fine but he
can't be attacking you or else you can't hand in the GLS<br>
<br>
Handing in the items: ALL humans and erudites no matter the god you have,<br>
you can do the quest.<br>
Suggestions for getting better faction are killing Moodoro Finharn(level 13 with<br>
maybe 300hps) in Qeynos, spawns in Crows. Another erudite in Freeport you<br>
can kill for faction, don't know name. I suggest you do Paineel quests when<br>
your faction is at dubious or so to make the process faster.<br>
<br>
Not sure on how much faction is needed for you to receive dread forged shield<br>
I'll post again when I have completed the quest. Give tell if you are on BB and<br>
need help with the quest.<br>

<p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="2">Hail, Virosoft the Warlock Here,
I've done this quest at lvl 31 (Currently lvl 34) Here is my post on the Quest.
Hope it solves all your problems.<br>
----------------------------<br>
-This Quest is Given by:<br>
:Temple of Solusek Ro from Vilissia.<br>
-Quest Components:<br>
:Lizardscale Cloak and 3 Runes of Scales.<br>
<br>
The Lizardscale Cloak Is obtained by the Tae Ew Templar inside Cazic-Thule
*zone, not God*, He is about a 1 hour spawn and drops the cloak and other stuff
so its not all that common to get the cloak. Also this camp has a list and can
be long with lotto. I camped for 4 Hours and quit! Bought it for 250pp on Mith
Marr.<br>
Stats: 8AC 5DEX<br>
<br>
*heres info on 3 scales starting with easiest to get*<br>
First Rune of Scale comes off Deepwater crocodiles and Deepwater caimans in
Oasis, It drops Often! I went in Oasis and first croc corpse I saw had the Rune.
Rune is NO DROP so you need to loot it.<br>
<br>
Second Rune of Scale is held off a Firescale crocodile in lavastorm. He spawns
Every 25 Minutes and drops the rune about 25% of the time i killed Him Twice
before getting the rune. *cons blue* The location where the croc Spawns is
against the North wall at +1300, -680 (approx level 30).<br>
<br>
Third rune is held by Saltwater crocodiles in Upper Guk, What I found hard about
this Rune was it was hard to Find the spot! Ancient crocs spawn with the
Saltwater ones. The Saltwater spawns at this location about every 20 mins. it
drops the rune about 10% of the time. Got it on the second time. Needed help tho,
lvl 31 cant solo em *I had kite the croc in lavastorm* and you cant kite those.
lvl 35 Necro helped me out. Crocs are in Bottom of Upper Guk, Not sure of
location, *sorry*<br>
<br>
Well thats my Walktrough. Remember that all Runes are NO DROP so you gotta loot
em yourself.. but the cloak you can buy. You can do this quest in a day No
problem.<br>
