Telin Darkforest in Burning Woods, Kunark<br>
<br>
Telin Darkforest can be found near the zone to Skyfire Mountains. The easiest
way to find him is to head to the North East part of the zone, towards Skyfire,
and you should eventually pick him up on tracking.<br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Telin Darkforest'<br>
Telin Darkforest looks at you serenely. 'Hello, wanderer.'<br>
You say, 'what are you doing in this forest'<br>
Telin Darkforest says 'Mighty this place must have been, once. Now scarred by
hatred and suffering. I have been sent here seeking answers to problems not yet
understood.<br>
You say, 'what answers'<br>
Telin Darkforest considers you for a few moments before speaking. 'A great evil
walks across the land. The hand of some demon we don't yet know is twisting and
polluting forests.'<br>
You say, 'what evil'<br>
Telin Darkforest says 'If I knew that, I wouldnt be here looking for answers. I
would be elsewhere, looking for solutions. For now, I suspect much but know
little.<br>
You say, 'what do you suspect'<br>
Telin Darkforest looks at you and sighs. 'The lands are changing. Beasts, large
and small, have turned upon those who watched over them. Druids and rangers,
worshippers of both Karana and Tunare, have reported a feeling of hatred
throughout their once peaceful lands.'<br>
You say, 'perhaps it is Innoruuk'<br>
Telin Darkforest raises his eyebrow slightly and a subtle look of surprise
creeps across his face. 'Innoruuk? Perhaps. Aye. It must be. Perhaps I knew and
didn't want to consider the possibility. It must be this though, and some action
will have to be taken.'<br>
You say, 'what action should I take'<br>
Telin Darkforest looks at you consideringly and then scribbles something quickly
on a small, worn paper. 'You seem powerful enough. Perhaps you can help those
who seek to protect nature's peace. Take this note. Deliver it only into the
hands of Faelin Bloodbriar. Where you will find her, I cannot say. She is a
friend of mine and a wanderer. She has been seen from one end of the lands to
the other. Seek her out, and quickly.'<br>

Telin Darkforest gives you a &quot;Worn Note&quot; to take to Faelin Bloodbriar.<br>

Faelin Bloodbriar in Greater Faydark, Faydark<br>
<br>
Faelin Bloodbriar spawns at POS 1500, POS 500 in Greater Faydark. Her
placeholder is an orc pawn. Faelin is a rare spawn. Just hang around this area
and kill all orc pawns you see around the area. Once you see either Faelin or an
orc pawn spawn, you can procede to camp just that spot and not worry about
additional orcs.<br>
<br>
Give Telin’s note to Faelin<br>
Faelin Bloodbriar reads the note carefully and growls to herself. 'Bad news, eh?
Take this ring. There is one elf, dark elf even, who we must go to in order to
gather insight into Innoruuk's plans. Giz X'Tin, he goes by most commonly.
Kithicor seems to be his favorite haunt and most likely you will find him there.
Don't ask how I know him. Just take the ring as my sign to him and he will speak
to you. We don't need to speak again, so dont seek me out, just goto Telin. I
must leave to investigate these events.'<br>

Giz X`Tin in Kithicor Forest, Antonica<br>
<br>
Giz X'Tin is a wandering spawn that has been mostly seen towards the north end
of the zone. He said to spawn around POS 1000, POS 1500. It is known that he
does wander the zone. I have seen hin on track durning the day and night time.
The easiest way that I have found to find him is to run along the way between
West Commons and Rivervale. If he is up, you will most likely pick him up on
tracking. Most likely your faction with Giz X'Tin will not be high enough, cast
Spirit of Wolf on yourself, run up behind him and sneak before you give him
Faelin's Ring.<br>
<br>
Give Faelin’s Ring to Giz X'Tin<br>
Giz X`Tin flips you a coin after he recognizes the ring. 'It seems we have a
mutual 'acquaintance.' The coin repays an old debt. You don't have to worry
about what that is. Luckily, Lord Innoruuk has informed me of your coming and
your desires. Fortunately, I have all the answers you require right here at the
end of my friend's blade. I think I'll be paying my old 'friend' a visit.'<br>
Teir`Dal Reaver says 'Lord Innoruuk, I have failed you. Forgive me and spare me
from service to your undead minions in the world!<br>
<br>
Giz X'Tin gives you a &quot;Dark Metal Coin&quot; to take to Telin Darkforest.<br>

A Teir'Dal Reaver will spawn when you get the Dark Metal Coin. There is no
reason to kill the reaver here unless you want some fun. He drops nothing and
you already have the coin for the next part. The reaver is said to be level 50
exactly and tough to fight. I just got the coin and ran.<br>

Give coin to Telin<br>
Telin Darkforest scratches the coin as he looks at it. 'Faelin sent you to Giz?
Surprising. This coin speaks to the outcome of your talk. He would hardly give
this bit of metal to a stranger, but that's a story for a different time. So,
you say Giz did confirm Innoruuk's involvement, and something about undead
minions? Here, take this coin back. Find Arch Druid Althele in the Karanas and
show her that. Tell her what we have discussed. She will look kindly on an ally
in this matter.'<br>

Althele in East Karana, Antonica<br>
<br>
NOTE: Do not procede with this part until you are ready to deal with the Dark
Elf Corruptor and two Dark Elf Reavers that will spawn. If you fail to kill the
Dark Elf Corruptor you will have to the start quest over from the beginning.<br>
<br>
Althele can be found close to the Barbarian Village around NEG 3650, NEG 1600.
Tholris and Fang should also be there with her. If you see any of the other
druids with her, do not give her the coin right away. First check to see if
someone is currently in the process of doing this part of the quest. If this is
the case, just wait for them to finish up. Althele, Tholris and Fang all respawn
thirty minutes after all the druids have been despawned. The other possibility,
is that someone had tried to do this part of the quest, failed and the spawn is
messed up. If this is the case, you may have to wait for the server till after
the server goes down again to be able to the quest.<br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Althele'<br>
Althele says 'Hello, friend. Beautiful is what I would call such a day normally
but lately?<br>
Give Coin to Althele<br>
Althele looks at the coin and nods gravely at you as she slips it into a fold of
her clothing. 'I see. The story of this coin speaks much to me as do the words
you have given me. Telin sent word that you would arrive. The tidings you bring
are ill indeed. Here, take this amulet and find Sionae. She is nearby. We will
speak more on this matter when all are present.'<br>

He is my hands, as Fang is my eyes.<br>
Fang barks in response to Althele's words.<br>
You say, 'why do you need him as your hands and fang as your eyes?'<br>
Althele says 'Yes. I cannot see any longer, my sight long since lost in the
march of years. By the blessings of Tunare and Karana, though, I still make
myself useful.<br>
<br>
Sionae spawns after you get the Braided Grass Amulet and can be found around NEG
2300, NEG 930.<br>
<br>
Give amulet to Sionae<br>
Sionae says 'I see that the time has come. Take the amulet and give it to the
third of our kin, Nuien. I will meet you at the gathering.<br>
<br>
Sionae gives you a &quot;Frayed Braided Grass Amulet&quot; to take to Nuien, who

You need to move quickly to Nuien. People who are Kill on Sight to druids may
walk past him because of where he spawns. If this happens, Nuien will argo on
that person. I do not know if he will argo on any hostile mobs in the area, but
it is best to move quickly and not take that chance. If Nuien is killed, the
spawn will be messed up and you will have to start all over. Even if Nuien argos
on someone, you can still give him the Frayed Braided Grass Amulet. He will then
start walking to the gathering place and Teloa will spawn.<br>
<br>
Give amulet to Nuien<br>
Nuien says 'So be it. Do as you have done before and find the next. Teloa is the
last.<br>
<br>
Nuien gives the &quot;Frayed Braided Grass Amulet&quot; back to you, and Teloa
spawns near the waterfall around NEG 3800, NEG 2860.<br>
<br>
Give amulet to Teloa<br>
Teloa begins walking toward the gathering spot. 'Follow me to the gathering
now.'<br>
<br>
Follow Teloa back to where Althele is, which is where the druids are gathering.
You will not have the amulet at this point as she does not return it to you.<br>
<br>
Althele says 'Great mother of life and father of sky, growth and spirit, Tunare
and Karana. Innoruuk once again schemes and we have failed in our duties to
protect our land. We give our powers in sacrifice for your help. Heed our call
and send us your wisdom.<br>
Althele snaps her head towards you. 'Innoruuk's brood is upon us. Go, find the
spawn of hatred before they reach this point and destroy them!'<br>
<br>
Dark Elf Corruptor and several Dark Reavers spawn, level supposed to be 50ish.
Only the Corruptor is said to have to be killed. It is recommended that you root
him, so he does not despawn on you. Additionally, it has been mentioned that he
cannot be pulled, so you have to rush in and attack him.<br>
<br>
Dark Elf Corruptor shouts 'We come for you, fools. Your reign of weakness over
the powers of the land comes to an end now!<br>
<br>
The easist way to do this is to have two group of people waiting on the hill.
The first group will attack the Dark Elf Corruptor immediately. The second group
will kite the Dark Elf Reavers to keep them distracted until the Corruptor has
been killed. Even though you will miss most [or all] of the fighting, you should
be one of the people in the group killing the Corruptor just so that you will be
able to loot his corpse right away and get the &quot;Fleshbound Tomb.&quot;<br>
Once the Dark Elf Corruptor is killed, the group killing the Corruptor will take
out the reavers. Even though some advocate killing the corruptor and letting the
reavers get the druids. I don't recommend this for several reasons. First off,
it is not within the theme of the quest to let the druids get killed. Secondly,
it is more time productive to kill the reavers also then turn in the Felshbound
Tomb to Althele right away.<br>

seed the land with his hatred and filth. You have only just begun your quest.
The path you are guided upon will be difficult, if not impossible, but someone

Go to Misty Thicket and wait near the guards that are close to the zone to
Rivervale. Ella Foodcrafter will run all over the zone. The wait usually isn't
long, so it is easier to wait for her to come to the guards. She doesn't stay in
one place for long, so you may want to bring along a friend to constantly hail
until you give her the Earth Stained Note.<br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Ella Foodcrafter'<br>

sorry such a young one as you has taken up this task. Maybe the sky god blesses
ya though. Aye, ya have that look in your eye. Our task is to focus the
blessings of the gods and cleanse the filth from the land. I'll need two things
from ya.<br>
You say, 'what two things?'<br>
Ella Foodcrafter says 'Well, ya ask before ya act. That's a good sign. What I
need isn't easy to find. First, I need a mixture. Plain sounding enough but it's
a special one. Cleanses the mind and focuses the earth's energies into a forest

Sit by Niera Farbreeze for a while until she starts to hum a tune. [Actually,
this is optional and you can immediately ask her about the tune if you want.<br>
<br>
Niera Farbreeze hums softly, a little tune that tickles the back of your mind
but you can't quite recall.<br>
You say, 'What tune is that.'<br>
Niera Farbreeze says 'Ohh. Just a little song my mother taught me when I was
young. It speaks of the earth, the sky, and the sparkling stars above, always
there.'<br>
You say, 'Why are they always there?'<br>
Niera Farbreeze says 'Aye, always there. Like this small bag I wear around my
neck. The last gift of my dying mother. It holds a fine dust, a dust she
collected during her short life, that she believed brought her luck. It's
speckled, lecked as the night sky is with stars.'<br>
You say, 'Where did she find the speckled, flecked dust?'<br>
Niera Farbreeze says 'I've had this little bit of dust, all I have of my mother,
for many years now. It's the only reminder I have of her. She said it was
special, magical, a warmth to help me through the nights. Even if my life were
in the balance, I would have a hard time giving it up.'<br>

Human Skeleton in Frontier Mountains<br>
<br>
At around NEG 2100, POS 2000; there is a human skeleton. The skeleton is not
fixed to this spot and will walk around some. If you do not find the Human
Skeleton right away, run around this location and keep checking tracking. Since
the Human Skeleton will despawn, you might have to wait for it to spawn again.
Give the wood painting to the human skeleton.<br>
<br>
a human skeleton begins to crack and disintegrate, its body collapsing into a
pile of dust that scatters into the winds. On the ground you notice a locket on
a fine, thin chain which you pick up.<br>

You say, 'are you one such as myself?'<br>
Foloal Stormforest stares at you and whispers. 'You must be the one that has
been spoken of. Yes, yes I am one of the circle. There are many of us in the
lands right now, all seeking answers to the ills that have befallen our homes.'<br>
You say, 'what answers?'<br>
Foloal Stormforest says 'I have heard whispers of new Iksar movements in the
land. The name of Venril Sathir is on the scaled lips and sharp tongues of every
cold blooded lizard in this place.'<br>
You say, 'what about venril sathir?'<br>
Foloal Stormforest says 'All I've heard are whispers of connections between the
undead lizards and the dark god of hate. There's some kind of history behind the
two. It might be that Venril is the main focus of Innoruuk's will in the land.
Then again, maybe not, but this is the best we've gotten so far. If you think
you can do it, then find him and remove him from the face of this earth. Bring

Venril Sathirs remains says 'The living fire. I seek the fires of life. Bring

<br>
Use the spell Dance of the Fireflies to summon a Firefly Globe. Give Venril
Sathirs remains the Firefly Globe, which causes the Spirit of Venril Sathir to

Venril Sathirs remains grasps the glowing sphere of fireflies from your hands.
Tendrils of mystical energy begin to flow forth from the swarm of glowing
insects like tiny fingers. The glowing tendrils begin to reach into the ribcage
of the rotting remains of Venril Sathir, coalescing into the form of an iksar
ghost.<br>

knowledge of resurrection so that I may once again live. I will hand you that

<br>
Kinlo Strongarm is located in Kaladim [B] in Everhot's Forge, bottom floor. This
part is completely optional. It is here just for completeness as it adds to the
story of the quest.<br>
<br>
You say, 'what ancient'<br>
Kinlo Strongarm says 'The ancient smiths, for what I think yer askin about,
ain't been around fer a long time, laddy. Last anyone heard o' the ancients was
'fore my time even. There be more than a few tales about 'em.<br>
You say, 'what few tales'<br>
Kinlo Strongarm says 'There be some who talk about how the ancient smiths went
down to work fer the duke o' below, sayin he be needin some fine dwarven smiths
fer makin some castle or some such. There be tales that the ancients were so
good at smithin that the duke took 'em down and made 'em head smiths over his
minions. There's even tales that some o the smiths' souls were trapped in their
hammers, stuck there by some necromancer or somethin, as punishment or
retribution.<br>
You say, 'what hammer hammers?'<br>
Kinlo Strongarm says 'Aye. Some says their souls were bound into their hammers
by an Erudite necromancer and enchanter. They say they used the power of the
hammers ta profit by makin ships, boats, and houses better than any other
merchants. Sad tale, if'n it be true.<br>
You say, 'what Erudite necromancer?'<br>
Kinlo Strongarm says 'I'm not knowin more about the story, lad. Everythin I know
is already in what I said. Aye, Erudites. I suppose if yer wantin ta run after
shortbeard tales ya can look over on that plague island they call Odus.<br>

Jaeil the Wretched in The Hole, Odus<br>
<br>
Jaeil the Wretched can be found in The Hole. I do not have a location for him
because I have not heard of anyone having difficulties finding him. He does not
despawn and should always be there. Like Venril Sathir, this will require a
guild raid to complete. If you can deal with Venril Sathir, you can deal with
Jaeil. This will be a triggered spawn, and you will need to be prepared to fight
him.<br>
<br>
Jaeil the Wretched whimpers pathetically as his reflection catches his eye. He
turns and stares pitifully at the ceiling.<br>
<br>
Jaeil the Wretched shields his eyes from his reflection in the water,
occasionally gibbering as he scratches at a flapping, rotted patch of skin on
his sunken face. In his arms he cradles something. He seems to emanate an aura
of power.<br>
<br>
Stand behind Jaeil the Wretched to make him indifferent to you, then give him
the Shiny Tin Bowl so that he will see his reflection.<br>
<br>
Jaeil the Wretched howls in anger, his body seeming to suck energy from the
walls around him as he sees his reflection. He pulls a hammer from the bundle in
his arms and swings fiercely at your head.<br>
<br>
Jaeil the Insane spawns and attacks. Kill Jaeil the Insane and loot the
&quot;Soulbound Hammer,&quot; which identifies as Hammer of an ancient dwarf.
Jaeil the Wretched will still be there; just ignore him as he is not part of the
fight. You only need to fight Jaeil the Insane.<br>

If for any reason your entire raiding party dies at Jaeil the Insane or on the
way there, the easiest way to recover is by having some people make Halfling
Rogues that worship Brell Serilis, then have a Druid port to Misty Thicket to
pick them up and port them to Toxxulia Forest, cast Spirt of the Wolf, then run
to the Hole. Additionally, you can bind in the Paineel area, near the lake
outside The Hole. If you duck, you should be able to fit through the crack in
the door. Mobs in The Hole will look at these characters dubiously, but will not
argo. You will want at least two - one to drag corpses from past the drop down
point to the ledge and a second to drag corpses from the ledge to near the
entrance area.<br>

hammer.]<br>
<br>
Kinlo Strongarm examines the hammer respectfully, admiring its craftsmanship. He
strikes it against his anvil and winces as a howl fills the air. 'This is one of
the ancients' hammers? I can almost, well, almost hear it callin ta me. It's
strong, that's fer sure, lad. I don't know how ye got it, but aye, a dwarf could

When these are killed, they split int two new mobs that are Level 54. When the
Level 54 mobs are killed, they split into two new mobs that are Level 56. One of
the Level 56 mobs will be an &quot;Essence Tamer Griffon,&quot; which is the mob
that drops the Swirling Sphere of Color, and it drops it every time.<br>
<br>
The Plane of Air can only be reached by the Level 46 Wizard spell &quot;Alter
Plane: Sky.&quot; This spell does require a reagent to be cast called
&quot;Cloudy Stone of Veeshan.&quot; This reagent can only be purchased at the
3rd floor of the City Library of Erudin and costs around 200-250PP depending on
your faction.<br>

Go to Island Five of the Plane of Air. Kill the Essensce Tamer to get the

what I got for ya. It ain't bad, pretty much like the one ye got there. I
suppose ye should take the one the ancient made and show it ta yer friend.<br>

Telin Darkforest in Burning Woods, Kunark<br>
<br>
Give Telin Darkforest the Refined Ancient Blade.<br>
<br>
Telin Darkforest smiles slowly. 'Now that's fine work. Just a moment, we have a
friend here who can enchant one of the blades. Give her the blade the ancient
smithed.'<br>
<br>
Faelin Bloodbriar appears. Give her the Refined Ancient Sword. She enchants it
and returns it to you.<br>
<br>
Faelin smiles at you, then closes her eyes as she sets the gem 'Nature's
Balance' into the crossguard and begins to channel her spirit into the sword.
The ground rumbles loudly as she casts. She collapses in exhaustion after a
short time. 'Take the blade, and perhaps you can finish this. You must strike at
Innoruuk's heart. Bring his shattered gem and the mithril blade to Xanuusus.
Only with Innoruuk's death can the balance of the land once again be restored.
If we do not meet again, remember you always have my eternal thanks.'<br>

Strike Directly Against Innoruuk<br>
<br>
Go to the Plane of Hate and slay Innoruuk for the &quot;Shattered Emerald of
Corruption.&quot; This will require a guild raid to complete, but should be easy
in comparison to some of the other mobs you have encountered. The Shattered
Emerald of Corruption is now a random/rare drop from any of the sub-boss mobs in
the Plane of Hate. If you are not on a raid to kill Innoruuk, I strongly
recommend clearing the entire zone to increase the chances of getting this
paticular drop from one of the other mobs.<br>

Xanuusus in North Karana, Antonica<br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Xanuusus'<br>
Xanuusus says 'Greetings, small one! I am Xanuusus of the Stormreapers. You are
welcome to rest beneath my mighty branches.<br>
<br>
Give Xanuusus the Refined Mithril Blade and the Shattered Emerald of Corruption.<br>
<br>
Xanuusus waves his hands over the gem of corruption and a wave of warm energy
passes through the area. With care for such a huge creature, he melds the gem
into the sword and seems to glow all over as he channels energy into the weapon.
'Thus is the link of hate broken between Innoruuk and the spirit of earth.
Through your will has balance returned. Your deeds, your work for the good of
all, will be remembered by anyone who walks beneath the canopy of a forest or
roams the plains. Continue your vigil over nature's balance.'<br>
