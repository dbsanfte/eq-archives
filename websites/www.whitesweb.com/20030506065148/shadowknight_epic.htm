        <td vAlign="top">This quest begins in the <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/overthere.html">Overthere</a>
          and results in the shadowknight's particle weapon.&nbsp;<br>
          <font size="2"><br>
          </font>This quest begins at an NPC named Kurron Ni who spawns near the
          docks in Fort Danak. This NPC is a rare spawn so don't be discouraged
          if he is not there the first few times you check for them.&nbsp;<br>
          <font size="2"><br>
          </font>Do not worry if you are killed on sight at the fort. Kurron
          spawns near the docks and you will be able to swim or invis yourself
          to get to him. He is also far enough away from other NPC's that you do
          not have to worry about them aggroing you when you are there.<br>
          <font size="2"><br>
          </font>If you ask him what he seeks(do not ask him what his mission is
          or he will attack you) and then agree to his terms(tell him &quot;I
          agree&quot;) then he will tell you that he seeks three pieces of <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/quest/darkforgearmor.html">darkforge
          armor</a>(helm, chest and leggings) and 900pp.&nbsp;<font size="2"><br>
          <br>
          Before turning in these items you need to gather up a good party and
          have them accompany you. Two groups would be best.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          Handing these items in to him will simply gain a raise in TrueSpirit
          faction and he will say that his mission is nearly complete. He will
          reward you with no items. If you ask him what mission he will tell you
          of his treachery and then attack you.<br>
          <br>
          At this point you must kill him. Upon killing him you will find a
          &quot;Note to Duriek&quot; on his corpse. You will need this for the
          next portion of the quest.<br>
          <br>
          NOTE: You MUST first hand in these items or he will not drop the note.
          This has been tested and confirmed.<br>
          <br>
          Duriek can be found overlooking the newbie area in Paineel. He is
          upstairs in the newbie area looking out through the glass. If you hand
          him the note he will tell you a story of his apprentice. He will also
          tell you to &quot;take this for your efforts.&quot; but no item will
          be given. I'm not sure if this is broken or not. I have contacted
          Verant about it with no response. Someone has told me that Verant
          responded to this on a public board saying that no item is supposed to
          be given but I was never able to find the thread. Either way you
          receive TrueSpirit faction and are able to continue the quest.<br>
          <br>
          If you ask him what apprentice he will give you further background.
          Tell him that you will take his apprentice's place and he will ask you
          to prove your worth first. Duriek is aging and is in need of a <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/quest/coughelixir.html">cough
          elixir</a>. This is obtained via a <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/quest/coughelixir.html">side
          quest</a> in Neriak.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          Upon returning the cough elixir to Duriek he will inform you that he
          was trying to create a corrupted ghoulbane. Unfortunately he is no
          condition to gather the components. His previous apprentice was
          searching for them when he met his demise.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          He needs you to find a tome for him. This tome can be found in <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/thehole.html">The
          Hole</a> on Ratman Guards. The best place to find these guards is by
          taking a left upon entering the first fortress and then take another
          left and pass down past the pool. Between this area and the old city
          beneath it Ratman Guards spawn fairly commonly as patrollers.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          Beware that these rats are extremely tough. They hit for 370s, are
          very magic resistant and have a ton of hit points. The tome is a rare
          drop on them so you are likely going to have to kill several of them
          to obtain one. Our first encounter with one we had 7 people and no
          deaths but we had a high level party and Turgur's stuck on the first
          attempt. In later raids we had as many as 25 people and might lose 5-8
          people each attempt. A lot of it depends on if you can get Turgurs or
          another speed reducing spell to stick early.<br>
          <br>
          Handing the Tome to Duriek will grant another faction adjustment and
          will reveal what items he will need to complete the corrupted
          ghoulbane. He requires:<br>
          <br>
          1) Blade of Abrogation from the <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/planeofair.html">Plane
          of Air<br>
          </a>2) Soul Leech from Cazic Thule in the <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/planeoffear.html">Plane
          of Fear<br>
          </a>3) Ghoulbane from upper guk.&nbsp;<br>
          4) <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/quest/decrepitsheath.html">Decrepit
          Sheath</a> from a Qeynos <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/quest/decrepitsheath.html">side
          quest</a>.<br>
          <br>
          Returning this items to him will result in a <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/corruptedghoulbane.html">corrupted
          ghoulbane</a>(dmg 16 delay 34 effect dismiss undead sk only 1hslash)
          and will send you to seek out Lhranc in the <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/cityofmist.html">City
          of Mist</a>. This item is not much use to a shadowknight of this level
          but it is required for the next portion of the quest.<br>
          <br>
          Lhranc spawns approximately at location 0,0 in the City of Mist. This
          is just before the Reaver area near the large hut with all of the Goos.
          He spawns in the middle hut right past the big goo house. He spawns at
          the bottom and the two NPC's who spawn upstairs are not placeholders.
          Upon speaking with him he will reveal what he needs to forge your
          weapon.<br>
          <br>
          Each of these steps is accomplished by completing a sub-quest. These
          sub-quests all tie in together. The heart of an innocent and the will
          of innoruuk are wearable items that are among the best that&nbsp;
          shadowknight can attain. As a result these sub-quests are listed with
          their own seperate pages that are cross-linked together. They are
          listed in the neccessary order of completion.<br>
          <br>
          <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/quest/heartofaninnocent.html">Heart of
          an Innocent</a><br>
          <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/quest/willofinnoruuk.html">The Will of
          Innoruuk</a><br>
          <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/quest/headofthevaliant.html">Head of
          the Valiant</a><br>
          <br>
          Return these three items along with the corrupted ghoulbane to Lhranc
          and he will reward you by turning in to a living version of himself
          wielding the almighty <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/innoruukscurse.html">Innoruuk's
          Curse</a>. Killing him will allow you to loot the weapon.<br>
