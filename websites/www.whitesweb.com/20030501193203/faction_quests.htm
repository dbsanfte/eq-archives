OK PEOPLE, I will tell you the best way to improve faction with the Freeport
Militia, AND NOT TAKING ANY FACTIONS HITS! First, go to High Pass Hold. There
are orcs at the entrance coming in from Kithicor Forest, they drop orc scalps.
You can loot these, and also buy them from the people camping this spawn. After
you have collected alot, go see Captain Ashlan on the bridge. Turn them into
him, and you will gain faction with the Freeport Militia, Corrupt Qeynos Guards,
High Pass Guards, and a couple others. NO FACTION HITS!!<br>
The other way to improve faction with the Freeport Militia without taking any
hits is to loot left goblin ears in Highhold Keep. Find the bank, then hang a
left, and go down to the basement. Goblins are there, ranging in level from
22-35. Kill goblins, loot ears. People will also sell them to you. Turn them
into Captain Bozec, at the top of the stairs. This will improve faction with the
same exact people as the orc scalp quest... taking NO HITS!!!<br>
Or kill Knights of Truth.</p>

<p align="left">KNIGHTS OF TRUTH<br>
If you don't care about your faction standing with Opal Darkbriar or Dismal
Rage, here is a way to improves faction with the Knights of Truth. Locate the
Hall of Truth in North Freeport. To the left just before you hit the bridge to
the Hall of Truth, there are pirahnas. Jump in the water and kill them. Loot the
fresh pirahna. On top of the roof on the Hall of Truth, hail around, somebody
will give you a bag to put them in. Once the bag is filled with four fresh
pirahna, hand it in.<br>
Or you can do what most people do, and kill orcs.<br>
If you don't care about your faction with the Freeport Militia, keep a look out
for people killing guards in West Freeport. They will usually let you loot the
damaged militia helms, which drop of the guards, and are no-drop. Turn these
into Theron something on top of the Hall of Truth. (hail around, i'm don't
remember exactly)<br>
Or you can kick a guard being pulled to the tunnel in the east commons, this
won't taunt them bad enough, when he dies, you get faction.</p>

<p align="left">QEYNOS GUARDS<br>
Quite simple to improve faction. You can kill Karana bandits, or gnolls in
Blackburrow. Alot. There are other easy ways to improve faction. Wandering
around in the docks side of Qeynos, there are two guards. One wants muffins, the
other water. Give one muffins, and the other water. This will hurt Corrupt
Qeynos Guards faction, though.</p>

<p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="2">The Cleric Guildmaster in felwithe
asks you to bring him 4 bone chips (I think), which are easily obtainable from
the skeletons out in greater faydark. Return them to him for some faction, and a
minor item (I got a low-level cleric spell, which I sold on).</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4"><b><a name="Temple of Ro Faction">Temple of Ro
Faction</a></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ortallis is an
orc. If you zone in from Oasis, hang a right, walk along the zone border until
the zone makes the corner, and the orc and his merchant will be near. The tent
is a one-man tent, and an erudite merchant sits in there, his name is Rathmana
Allin.<br>
<br>
You can hail him (I'm a wood elf, thus a good race, don't know if evils can do
it) and he gives you a couple of things you can do, but one in particular, he
asks you to give him 30gp and you can reach into his bag and get a spell. So,
give him 3pp and you'll get exp, an item (which I let fall to the ground) and
sol ro faction.<br>
<br>
I was dubious to those guys in the temple, it cost me 21pp (7 tries) to get
indifferent with Rathmana AND teh temple of solusek ro. At indifferent I could
do the quests.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps...<br>

<p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="2">NOTE: This is a quest on Luclin,
but the Luclin zones are not listed as options on Everlore yet.<br>
<br>
This quest begins and ends in Shadow Haven, with a short trip to Dawnshroud
Peaks in the middle.<br>
Find Mistala Glimmerblade in Shadow Haven:<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Mistala Glimmerblade'<br>
<br>
Mistala Glimmerblade says 'Hello there friend! I am Lady Mistala Glimmerblade of
the House of Fordel I reside over this great city of Shadowhaven along with my
husband Daloran. I take great pride in knowing that our city has come so far and
became a place of free trade and freedom for all of its inhabitants. We also are
lucky to have some of the finest guardspersons in the land. Which reminds be I
need to collect my [report].<br>
<br>
You say, 'what report?'<br>
<br>
Mistala Glimmerblade says 'I have a report that I collect every few days from my
first Lieutentant Broansas. This report contains information about each guard
his performance and usually notes on suggestions upon how to limit the number of
smugglers passing through our town. However, Lieutenant Broansas is currently on
assignment investigating a smugglers ring. I need someone to retrieve his
reports of the latest information that he gathered for me. Will you [retrieve
the daily reports]?<br>
<br>
You say, 'i will retrieve the daily reports'<br>
<br>
Mistala Glimmerblade says 'Many thanks friend. The last I heard from Broansas he
was heading for the Dawnshroud peaks please seek him out there and present him
with this notorized letter so that he will know that I have sent you. Return to
me with his report as soon as you can. I await your return.<br>
<br>
Take the note to the Dawnshroud Peaks. Lieutenant Broansas is located on a hill
on the western side of the zone. Give him the note, and recieve his journal.
Take the journal back to Mistala for experience (not noticeable at 43) and a
faction boost with Shadow Haven.<br>
<br>
After doing this quest once (you can do it multiple times) and the Trade
Commissioner Henry quest once, the merchants in Shadow Haven would deal with me.<br>
