The quest starts in the Plane of Fear. A npc named Irak Altil is a wandering
indifferent, undead zombie.<br>
<br>
Irak Altil Log<br>
You say, 'what are you mumbling about?'<br>
Irak Altil turns its rotted eyesockets towards you. 'Fallen light, upon this
ground I fell. Left to rot, cast out. My holy arms stripped and my soul cast out
of the halls. Twisted, failed, disgraced.'<br>
Zivilyn says, 'are you disgraced'<br>
Irak Altil says 'Disgrace upon my soul for failing in my duties. Disgrace of my
brethren.<br>
Zivilyn says, 'what are your duties'<br>
Irak Altil breathes his words from his skeletal mouth as if wind through a
valley. 'Sword, shield, breastplate. Twisted to Innoruuks foul will. Must be
retrieved and cleansed else my soul is to wander for all time.'<br>
You say, 'what sword?'<br>
Irak Altil says 'Hands of a twisted brother no longer living.<br>
Zivilyn says, 'what shield' Irak Altil says 'Earthly children of the god of
hate. Keeping stand over his dark brothers and sisters.<br>
Zivilyn says, 'what breastplate' [ed. note: actually the keywords is
&quot;breast&quot;]<br>
Irak Altil lets loose an unearthly howl as it gleams with sickly light. 'Upon
she who lured me from my post. In that place where hatred festers. Painful
corruption.'<br>
[ed. note: actually the keywords is &quot;clean&quot;]<br>
Irak Altil says 'The sword must be dipped in water pure. Light of clean spirit
to cleanse the shield. A gem of clarity unlike any other for the breastplate.
All must be cleansed and returned to the temple for my soul to be freed. Only
the temple can cleanse, only they can touch the artifacts. Take the sets of two
to the temple. When they are all three cleansed seperately take them to he who
will grant me atonement.<br>
<br>
Reklon Gnallen<br>
Now, the next npc is Reklon Gnallen, who is in the Temple of Quellious in
Erudin.<br>
Reklon Gnallen says 'Hail to you friend. Seek you knowledge or atonement in this
temple of peace?<br>
You say, 'What temple of peace'<br>
Reklon Gnallen says 'Dedicated to the god of peace, Quellious, is this temple.
It is here that her clerics and paladins pray and receive inspiration.<br>
You say, 'What paladins'<br>
Reklon Gnallen says 'As the clerics are the warm hand of healing, the paladins
are the stalwart shield of protection, and in times of grave need the sharp
sword of justice. To our post must we always remain vigilant else dishonor might
befall us.<br>
You say, 'I wish to remain vigilant'<br>
Reklon Gnallen says 'To a paladin the upholding of his duty, or honor to his
temple is foremost. To fail in his duty to stand at his assigned post in time of
need is a great disgrace. Few are the paladins who have done so, and their
spirits have been outcast from the god of peace.'<br>
You say, 'What outcast'<br>
Reklon Gnallen says 'Harsh though it seems, a true paladin must always remain
vigilant and dedicated to his cause. If he does not then he might find himself
fallen from grace.'<br>
You say, 'Who has fallen from grace?'<br>
Reklon Gnallen says 'There are a few who have done so. Only a few that come to
mind. Such stories are useful to remember as reminders of our beliefs.<br>
You say, 'What stories'<br>
Reklon Gnallen says 'One is the story of the paladin who fell due to his
weakness in the duty of his guard post.<br>
You say, 'what peasent woman'<br>
Reklon Gnallen says 'Many hundreds of years ago did this story begin. There was
a paladin, whose name is lost to all but our oldest leaders, who was among the
greatest examples of honor. It was his post to guard the chambers to our most
important halls. His fall was a creature in the guise of a poor peasant woman<br>
You say, 'What sacrifice'<br>
Reklon Gnallen says 'Only this crest and the sacrifice of something that
symbolizes your strength and purity will release his spirit into the cleansing
flames of our lady Quellious. Go now. Thank you.<br>
<br>
The Tainted Items<br>
Irak Altil failed his duty as a guard for the Paladins of Quellious and was cast
out from his Temple. To release him from exile, you need to purify and return a
tainted sword, shield and breastplate.<br>
The Tainted Shield<br>
Irak Altil says 'Earthly children of the god of hate. Keeping stand over his
dark brothers and sisters. Light of clean spirit to cleanse the shield. All must
be cleansed and returned to the temple for my soul to be freed.<br>
The tainted shield drops off Kirak Vil in Nektulous forest. He wanders the zone
and is about level 56. Very tough, high regen rate. You need at least 2 groups
of level 55+ to take him down.<br>
The Light of Clean Spirit is not a physical component you turn in for the
shields purification. Just give the tainted shield to Elia the Pure in felwithe.
She is by the water just before you enter the inner city zone. When you hail
her, she says that she is standing in &quot;Pure light&quot; so since she
technically has it already, you dont have to give it to her with the shield.<br>
The Tainted Sword<br>
Irak Altil says 'Hands of a twisted brother no longer living. The sword must be
dipped in water pure. The tainted sword drops off the 'Keeper of Tombs&quot; in
The Hole.<br>
The Pure Water comes from doing a simple sub-quest of helping a peasant woman
give her sick brother some water. The peasant woman is located in the small pond
by the Monk guild in West Freeport. Ask her &quot;What water?&quot; Then &quot;I
will take it to him.&quot; Her brother is in the bakery nearby, named Joshua.<br>
The Tainted Breastplate<br>
Irak Altil lets loose an unearthly howl as it gleams with sickly light. 'Upon
she who lured me from my post. In that place where hatred festers. Painful
corruption.' A gem of clarity unlike any other for the breastplate. The tainted
breastplate drops off the thought corruptor in the plane of hate. Supposedly
they spawn by killing Scorn Banshees. Supposedly, the best chance of getting a
thought corruptor to spawn is within the first few hours of hate when the first
scorn banshees are pulled. If we all do hate the same way on the servers, then
there's probably one or two scorn banshees that are PH's for thought corruptors.
The Pure gem is done by doing a subquest in Kaladim. In the mines (take a right
as you go in, across the bridge), find a miner named Jark.<br>
You say, 'hail Jark'<br>
You say, 'some quest'<br>
Jark says 'Huh? Oh, I struck me some silver. Aint gonna make me rich but it'll
sure pay for me minin costs. Speakin of, that wife o` mine was supposed ta bring
me food already. Hey, you, wanna go get me my dinner? I aint got nothing ta pay
ya with but I sure would appreciate it.<br>
You say, 'i will get your dinner'<br>
Jark says 'Har, I know you were a good sort. Nella has it. Shes out there
somewhere in the lower areas. She likes to visit the temple so maybe shes there.
Just tell er Jark sent ya and she'll prolly have everythin ready fer me.<br>
You say, 'hail Nella Stonebraids'<br>
You say, 'dinner'<br>
Nella Stonebraids says 'Ach! I forgot me husbands dinner. Im so sorry. I was
sendin my wishes ta Brell for health and long life. I was just floatin coins
into the wishin pool. Usually its for children but things havent been so good
lately. Here, please take this to him and tell him where I was.<br>
Jark says 'Har har! No time fer eatin now! While you were gone I struck me a
rich vein. Lookie here. Ya ever seen a gem so pure? Its tiny but clear as glass.
Ya take it Holyomen . Ya showed me some kindness, least I can do. Besides, still
a share here for me.<br>
<br>
The Purification<br>
Irak Altil says, 'Only the temple can cleanse, only they can touch the
artifacts. Take the sets of two to the temple. When they are all three cleansed
seperately take them to he who will grant me atonement.'<br>
What Irak means is only the temple (Quellious temple, which he worshiped) can
cleanse the artifacts. The sets of 2 that he speaks of is the set of the sword
and pure water, and the set of the breastplate and pure gem.<br>
Give the sets seperately to Reklon in Erudin and he will purify them.<br>
To purify the Tainted Shield, just give it to Elia the Pure in Felwithe.<br>
Gleaming Breastplate Log<br>
Reklon Gnallen presses the gem of purity against the breastplate. Its dark gleam
softens and then glows bright once again. 'Compassion is strong in you. Few so
called heroes would sacrifice their time for such a menial task as you
performed. Continue your work. Hold this ancient breastplate until you have
completed your task.'<br>
Gleaming Sword Log<br>
Missing quest log text.<br>
Gleaming Shield<br>
Also missing quest log text.<br>
The Crest<br>
Next, turn in all three purified items...the sword, shield, and breastplate to
Reklon.<br>
Reklon Gnallen says 'I never thought our order would see these artifacts again.
With the return of these relics we can now put at ease a scar upon the history
of our order. This cleansing will atone for his failure. Your soul must be pure
to have given so freely of yourself. Go now, take this crested token of our
order. If you wish to free his soul you must undertake another sacrifice.<br>
You say, 'What sacrifice'<br>
Reklon Gnallen says 'Only this crest and the sacrifice of something that
symbolizes your strength and purity will release his spirit into the cleansing
flames of our lady Quellious. Go now.<br>
Turning in the crest and a Fiery Avenger to Reklon does NOT finish the quest.<br>
The End<br>
The last step is to turn in the Mark of Atonement crest and your symbol of
Strength and Purity to Irak Altil. Supposedly, Irak Altil is triggered spawn,
but that is yet to be confirmed. Either way, he's up there in fear somewhere :-)
If you are lucky, you'll see him. When you see Irak, he should be an indifferent
conning undead skeleton. Turn in your crest first, then your symbol of strength
and purity...your Fiery Avenger Irak will then give you your new fiery defender,
and run off to sacrifice him upon the altar of Cazic Thule.<br>
