<br>
The Scabbard<br>
<br>
Step 0: East Karana<br>
<br>
To start it off travel over to East Karana, you hail a half elf named Felonius
Sworddancer at the base of the HHP ramp. He tells you about the history of the
ultimate sword(s), and tells you about he test given by the person who holds the
scabbard. He tells you the legend and oints you in the direction of East
Freeport where you meet the scabbard-holder. Other than that, he is fairly
useless and you don’t necessarily have to do this it is just part of the whole
quest.<br>
<br>
Step 1: East Freeport<br>
<br>
The man you need to see is Kargek Redblade sorta close to the East Gate. He is
in the slum section of East Freeport near a tent overlooking the large
depression there. If you look behind the row of shops where the leather store
and stuff is in East Freeport just after you zone from West Freeport, there is a
path that leads to a raised area looking down over some tents. Take the path to
the left along the wall and you will find Wenden Blackhammer and Kargek Redblade.
You don’t need Wenden just yet but If you hail Redblade (you might have to say
the following line “I will do you a favor”) you will see some text
explaining why he has a big red scabbard on his back. Ask him about whatever he
starts off talking about. I believe it’s his family's responsibility or
something like that. Ask him about the scabbard. He will have a brief back and
forth with you and ask you to take a note to a friend of his, an ogre in The
Feerott named Oknoggin Stonesmasher.<br>
<br>
Step 2: Feerott<br>
<br>
Oknoggin Stonesmasher hangs out around the stone bridge in Feerot. He is not
KOS, so you need not fear approaching him to give him the note, whatever race
you are. Be careful though, as bouncers wander this area on their patrols. He
will give you a tiny lute and ask you to return it to Kargek Redblade.<br>
<br>
Step 3: East Freeport<br>
<br>
Return to Kargek and hand in the lute. He will give you a book, with some
interesting story details about the blades in it, and tell you to take it to his
brother Tenal Redblade, in East Karana.<br>
<br>
Step 4: East Karana<br>
<br>
Tenal resides near the top of the ramp to Highpass. Handing him the book will
prompt him to give you the totem of the freezing winds, and give you some text.
After a lengthy explanation of how rotten and unworthy he thinks you are, Rallos
Zek takes over his body and commands you to bring him an Ice Goblin Heart, along
with a totem he gives you (to prevent skipping steps). The Ice Goblin Heart
comes from the land where the Rathe bestowed his curse on the giants. This clue
leads you to the Frost Giants of Permafrost, and more specifically for this
step, the ice goblin wizards who drop the heart needed for this portion of the
quest.<br>
<br>
Step 5: Permafrost Keep<br>
<br>
The jail in Permafrost Keep was where people I know had the most success camping
the heart. Took me a couple of hours. It drops off ice giant wizards as a rare,
they spawn throughout the fort. Once you have it, you can short circuit a later
step by also camping the frost giants on the way to Vox's lair for a block of
Permafrost needed for the first blade. This is also a rare item and took me a
week of returning and killing Ice Giants, who are now all six-hour spawns.<br>
<br>
Step 6: East Karana / Emerald Jungle / Skyfire / Solusek B<br>
<br>
Returning both the totem he gave you and the heart of frost to Tenal will result
in him handing you A Totem of the Fiery War. You guessed it fire… war…
dragons! He asks for the scales of a Red and Green dragon to be returned to him.
Green Dragon Scales are obtained from Severilious in Emerald Jungle, a random
spawn dragon of level sixty plus. He requires a raid team of about forty to
kill, has nasty fear and AE stun poison effect. He is however, the easiest of
the Kunark Dragons to kill. He generally drops from one to three scales, but has
been known to drop none at all. Red Dragon Scales may currently be obtained from
three sources: Nagafen if you are fifty second level or less. Or Zordakius
Ragefire, the red dragon who spawns from the cleric quest (Easy to kill with the
fifty-five plus people who are likely to be accompanying the cleric doing the
quest, but hard to spawn. He drops scales as a random rare drop), and Talendor,
the mighty red dragon of Skyfire. The only killing of Talendor on Brell thus far
produced one red scale, so we can presume his drop rate is similar to
Severilious. Remember those Red Dragonscale Breastplates that people run around
wearing and looking pink in? You will learn to hate them. Once both are
obtained, return to Tenal.<br>
<br>
Step 7: East Karana/Plane of Hate<br>
<br>
Returning both scales to Tenal with the Totem of Flaming War or whatever it’s
called results in yet another subquest. This time he apparently has nothing
better to do then send you traipsing off to hate to obtain the Hand of the
Maestro. This is an Uncommon drop off the Maestro of Rancor in Hate. He's easily
killable with eighteen if you are all fifty-five plus, and drops the hand every
fourth or fifth attempt. He spawns once a day. Return this and the totem Tenal
gave you to him.<br>
<br>
Step 8: East Karana/Plane of Sky<br>
<br>
Yet another subquest. This time he gives you the Mark of the Sword, and tells
you to return it and the Spiroc Wingblade to his brother Kargek in East Freeport
to obtain your scabbard. The Spiroc Wingblade is an uncommon drop off the Spiroc
Lord on the fifth isle of Sky. Turning in this blade with the Mark to Kargek
gets you a red scabbard, the final reward of this portion of the quest.<br>
<br>
First Reward: The Scabbard<br>
<br>
Yes, all of this for a simple four slot combinable container. It is used both to
combine the other parts of the quest and produce the Blade of Strategy and Blade
of Tactics and also to combine them into the two handed Jagged Blade of War and
break them back into the two component blades again. You'll have to free up an
inventory slot for the scabbard, but it’s a small price to pay. I think he
also gives you instructions on how to use it as well.<br>
<br>
The First Blade<br>
<br>
Step 1: Ocean of Tears<br>
<br>
A Dwarf in Ocean of Tears named Denken Strongpick will talk to you if hailed
him. He also shows you a runed blade that he found on the ocean floor, the first
of four pieces needed to put in the scabbard. He says he will trade it to you
for four items. It seems this grumpy dwarf and his friend are stranded on this
island, and they need two rebreathers and some booze to escape; dwarves… go
figure. The booze is Vox Tail Ale, which you can buy nearly anywhere. The catch
is, he wants it cold. Really, really cold. You need a Block of Permafrost to
keep the liquor frozen, and those only drop from ice giants inside Permafrost,
not the ones in Everfrost. Yes, the ones by Vox although they’re Not too hard,
they are definitely a pain in the rump. So you need two rebreathers, a block of
Permafrost, and a keg of Vox Tail Ale. Rebreathers are tinkerable by any gnome
of sufficient skill. There are four I know of for sure, Bten, Fidgety, Minipus,
and Wyzskarlet. Rebreathers will generally cost you about three to four thousand
plat per device unless they've lowered their prices recently or you’re in a
guild with them for sale. Vox tail ale may be purchased from several vendors
across Norrath, including the EFP Port Authority and the Sandfishers in North
Ro. It was formerly a very difficult subquest involving obtaining the scale of
Faydedar (Ack) and camping more greens for rare parts (double Ack) but Verant
decided in its mercy that given the rest of our quest, this was too much, and
put them on vendors.<br>
<br>
Step 2: Permafrost Keep<br>
<br>
Yes, if you didn't camp the Ice Giants the last time you were here, or didn't
get the block, you are back! Giants spawn every 6 hours by Vox's lair, kill them
till they drop the rare Block of Permafrost.<br>
<br>
Step 3: Ocean of Tears<br>
<br>
Returning to Denken whatever it was with the rebreathers, the block of
permafrost, and the keg of Vox Tail Ale results in the first blade. Stow it in
your bank for a while<br>
<br>
Reward: First Blade<br>
<br>
You can keep it in your bank for now. Looks like katana in inventory, so make
sure you don’t accidentally destroy it.<br>
<br>
Second Blade<br>
<br>
Step 1: Chardok<br>
<br>
The one and only step here is to kill the Queen of Chardok till she coughs up
her rare drop, the Ancient Blade. You may need to kill her many, many times
before she poops out that loot. She's a tough mob, on a par with Venril Sathir
to kill. Takes twenty-four to thirty level fifty-five pluses. You can also camp
the king next door for his nifty Incarnadine Breastplate while you are here.
Royals are on a two-hour spawn cycle.<br>
<br>
Reward: Second Blade<br>
<br>
Another blade to put in the bank. Make sure you don’t accidentally destroy it!<br>
<br>
First Hilt<br>
<br>
Step 1: Lake Rathetear<br>
<br>
The first hilt is easily obtainable. Head straight out from the SK zone to the
lagoon with the tall Spiroc Tower in it. Go to the Aviak Diving Board and dive
off. Swim to the bottom, under the tower. Swimming under that tower will reveal
a small brown bag on the sea floor. Picking it up will give you the Unjewelled
Dragon Head Hilt.<br>
<br>
Step 2: Plane of Hate / Plane of Fear / Sebilis / Other Zones<br>
<br>
Now all you need to is obtain one each of the following: Black Sapphire,
Jacinth, and a Diamond. These may be obtained as drops from many mobs in Hate,
Fear, Sebilis, and other high level zones and mobs. Or the easy way; they go for
about one K each in trade or three K for the bit.<br>
<br>
Step 3: East Freeport<br>
<br>
Take the three gems and the Unjewelled Dragin Head Hilt to Wenden Blackhammer,
the Dwarf standing next to Kargek in East Freeport. Handing him all four results
in the Jeweled Dragon Head Hilt.<br>
<br>
Reward: Jeweled Dragon Head Hilt<br>
<br>
Something else to put in your bank.<br>
<br>
Second Hilt<br>
<br>
Step 1: Timorous Deep<br>
<br>
The second hilt may be found on the chessboard island in Timorous Deep (location
is -6000, -4000); lying against the King. Looks again like a small bag. Pick it
up and you will receive a Severely Damaged Dragon Head Hilt. Also easy to get,
but it has a problem… its damaged. The dwarven blacksmith informs you that you
need a Ball of Everliving Golem from the Plane of Fear, and a block Rejesium Ore
that the giant lords in Frontier Mountains have.<br>
<br>
<br>
Step 2: Plane of Fear<br>
<br>
The first item you need to obtain is a Ball of Everliving Golem. These are
random drops off the three Golems of Cazic Thule: Fright, Dread and Terror. Most
of the zone needs to be cleared before you attempt them. Each golem can drop it,
so between zero to three can drop on a given raid.<br>
<br>
Step 3: Dreadlands<br>
<br>
Next, you get to camp Mountain Giant Patriarchs to get rejesium ore. You must
supply a Giant Monocle to one of those lords. The monocle is a rare drop from
giant patriarchs, who are themselves rare spawns who also drop the TreeWeave.
Good luck finding a giant patriarch. Good luck getting him to drop a monocle if
you do. The best place to spawn lots of them is at the big giant fort in the
mountains. A single warrior of level fifty-five can pull and kill most of the
giants here. A well-equipped fifty-eight warrior can solo them. Most of us will
need the help of at least a second warrior for the patriarchs however. A Giant
Monocle is a lightstone looking item. This is what you need.<br>
<br>
Step 4: Frontier Mountains<br>
<br>
Take this monocle to a giant deep in the mines within the giant fort there. His
name is Mentrax Mountainbane (perhaps it was Mountainbone). There is another
named giant with him, do not mistake him for the one you need. Hail both, the
one that roars is not the one you want. Neither is KOS. Giving him the monocle
produces a block of Rejesium Ore.<br>
<br>
Step 5: East Freeport<br>
<br>
Give the Rejesium Ore and the Ball along with the Severely Damaged Hilt to
Wenden Blackhammer. He produces the Finely Crafted Dragon Head Hilt.<br>
<br>
Reward: Finely Crafted Dragon Head Hilt<br>
<br>
You guessed it, another bank filler.<br>
<br>
The Blades<br>
<br>
Now it gets confusing so read carefully or read it twice.<br>
<br>
Step 1: Combine the two blades and the two hilts in the scabbard. This produces
your first rewards, the Blade of Tactics and the Blade of Strategy.<br>
<br>
Step 2: Combining these two blades produces the Jagged Blade of War, a nasty two
hand-slashing sword.<br>
<br>
Step 3: Combining this blade alone in the scabbard splits it again into the
original two blades.<br>
<br>
Congratulations!!!<br>
