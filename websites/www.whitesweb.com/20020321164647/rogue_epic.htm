<p align="left">First, go to Malka Rale, in Qeynos Aquaducts, she is in a round
room with 2 other rogues, Hail her, if she doesnt say anything, ask her,
&quot;how do I get out of here&quot; or &quot;who is Hanns&quot;, then she will
ask you to help her, you go along and talk to her till she gives you a bag<br>
<br>
Ok, soon as you have the bag. Go to Highpass and to the rogue guild, you have to
search in the water for a tunnel to find it, find Anson McBale, give him the bag
and it will make Stanos spawn, he will say something, you follow along and
listen to the story and he will ask you to get 2 parchments on notes, top and
bottem<br>
<br>
First one is in Kaladim, Founy, near the bank, pick pocket him, you have to have
a skill of 170 or above to pickpocket him, he hits for like 150 and guarded my 2
or 3 other rogues, steal the parchment, and then go to Neriak, find Tani N'mar,
he is in the rogue guild hall, Ebon mask, most the time you will pickpocket him
and get it the first time, he is guarded my 4 rogues, then take the parchments
to Stanos, if you dont know how to get Stanos to respawn, ask if you NEED to see
him, then he will<br>
<br>
He then will give you a combined note, go find Eldreth, he is on one of the
small islands in Lake Rathe, hand the note to him, then after you do that, give
him 2 TWO milk and 100pp, then he will ive you a scribed note, then go find
Yendar in Steamfont, spawns around the druid rings and walks on trail, has a smr
looking robe on so not hard to spot, give him the note, then talk with him, he
will give you a completed note, then...<br>
<br>
Go to the Plane of Hate, go to Maestro of Rancors room and pick up the book of
souls, it spawns in there, like a little bag<br>
<br>
then, go find Yendar again and give him the Completed note and the book of
souls, the Renux will spawn, you will need many friends to kill her, she hits
pretty hard and really fast, best way to kill her its get someone to throw/cast
at her and then start running, have anyone that can snare her and then kite her
wil she chases her target, sik pets, nuke, melee, etc. then when she dies she
will drop a Jagged diamond dagger, which is one of the 3 items you need to turn
in to Stanos, she also drops some nice stuff along with it, like new ravenscale
and weaps, and then, loot the Translated note too, so now you have the JD dagger
and the note<br>
<br>
Then give the note to stanos, he will then he will give you a box that you turn
into the Dark elf Advisor, or he will tell you Im sure who to turn it into in
Kithicor Forest, after you hand the box in, the General will spawn, you need
many friends again to kill this guy, he cons red to 60 and has friends around
him, he drops the other 2 items you need, the Cazic Quill, and the Generals
Pouch, also drops some very nice stuff along with it you can roll on or etc like
a 14 25 katana and a stuf<br>
<br>
Turn the Cazic Quill, Jagged Diamond Dagger, and the Generals Puch into Stanos<br>
<br>
He then gives you the Ragebringer then you can laugh at people that dont have it<br>
<br>
Have fun<br>
