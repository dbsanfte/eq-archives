<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>Aderation and I did the run from Shadowhaven to Katta Casteleum tonight, and since there's no maps of 2 of the zones on the route, I thought I'd post my best recollection of  the trip. This was a scary route, a bit, but faster than the alternate through Paludal to Hollowshade to Grimling Forest and then Tenebrous Mts. Very, very scary place, tons of mobs, social, and you can't root or snare I don't believe. &lt;shudder&gt;. The Mobs in here are at least high 40s I believe. There weren't many other people around at the time, and all were around 60. You get the idea. :)
You start by going to Shadowhaven - from the zone-in from the Nexus, go to the last, west-most door on the north wall. This will take you to the Nec/SK area of Echo Caverns via a hidden wall. When you enter Echo, go left a bit, then right to the big double-doors. You may want to invis here. Go into Echo and hang a right when you can, this will take you to Fungus Grove and the FG Outpost. (Watch the tentacled critters on the walls and ceiling). When you zone into FG, you'll be at the Outpost, which is also where you'll find Tharg (?) who is the NPC for a faction quest given by the trade master in SH (Trade Secrets).
Go past the Outpost, definitely invis here... SoW would be a terrific idea. Fungus Grove is a large cavern - Ader and I went straight ahead, bearing slightly left. I believe we passed a large pond on it's left side, surrounded by mutants, then came into a very large chamber with a hill in the center. I ran around the chamber for a bit looking for an exit, and Aderation found a ramp going up the hill - I had my clip pane set way back for reasons of Lag, and didn't see the structure right away. Anyway, you climb the ramp/natural arch, and ahead you'll see a hallway with a portal ring ahead - click the ring and you wind up in the Mages' Tower in Twilight Sea. The direction you're facing is more-or-less the direction you need to go to get to Katta, bearing a small amount right. (Don't have the Loc, Ader, do you recall it?) - not sure what level the MOBs were here, didn't stop to Con them, but invis worked on them. You'll come to some water, on the other side will be a small island with a house. We swam with no problem, in hindsight Lev would have been smarter. The small island is populated with friendlies. There's a barge it looks like can take you across to Katta, which you can see at this point, or you can Lev across. You're there!
Now that I've done the run from Katta to the Grimling Forest zone about 10 times, and figured out how to get through Paludal in a few minutes, I think I'd be inclined to go this route next time. Tenebrous is a bit scary, but not as bad as FG I think... I've run from Katta / TM to the spot at the TM/GF zone many times and never had a serious problem when SoWed and Lev'd anyway. But the SH-EC-FG-TS-Katta route is certainly 'exciting', hehe. Hopefully they'll have maps of these zones soon, but in the meantime, Katta has a ton of cool quests, some that significantly help with faction in SH.
The end.
