<p>I got this program that I think will be great for other members of the guild to have for when we are raiding and stuff. The program is called Buddytalk... you can download it at www.buddytalk.com, it allows you to call other members of buddytalk from pc to pc for absoulty free of charge. Buddytalk works just like a phone, it assigns your pc a device number (just like a phone number) and you can call other people on it and they can call you. The quality is just like using a phone, great quality.. for those of you that have used Roger Wilco I'll tell you this is much better. For anyone that decides to get it, my device ID is 18286000102 call me sometime and maybe we can camp together.. I have been using this program with Sigifrith for the past several days and it's been a blast... he's from Australia and I'm in the United States and we still have great quality on it (both using cable internet). Check it out and tell me what you think... You can also have confrences with it too so we could get a whole group of people talking which is why i think it would be great for raiding....</p>
