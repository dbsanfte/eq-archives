<p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="2">This is the quest for the
Longsword of Ethereal Energy. It's a sweet sword, and I suggest you all go do
this easy quest now, before Verant nerfs it.<br>
<br>
1) The quest starts at Katta Castleum. Speak to Yurrdle The Caretaker inside the
crypt. On your way inside, be careful to stay on the path, if you touch the
grass, undead will spawn that the guards will not help with. Ask Yurddle about
grave robbers to see if he'll give you the quest.<br>
<br>
2) Go to Shadow Haven. Inside the magic guild, go up the left stairwell, and
into the first hall on the left. Inside the second door in the hallway, you will
find Pietro Guccini, a High Elf. Give him 1000 gold (not 100 plat) and you will
recieve a portrait.<br>
<br>
3) Go to Paludal Caverns. At loc -1424, 1374 a named bandit Maricella Slithra
spawns. She is on a 12 minutes spawn clock, with a recondite bandit as a
placeholder. This is a long camp. It took me 3 hours, and a friend 4 hours. She
is not an uncommon spawn, but the drop you need is. Kill her until you get an
Ornate Ancient Combine Dagger.<br>
<br>
4) Head for Fungus Grove. Inside the outpost, step into the bar and you'll find
a Half-Elf named Ebben Quickblade. This is the toughest mob in the entire quest.
He's level 40, but a pretty weak 40. Just kill him there, none of the other
patrons will defend him. Get the Antique Platinum Medal he drops.<br>
<br>
5) Go to Twilight Sea. On the island with the dock, adjacent to the castle
proper, spawns three named NPCs. The one you want is Fierdo, the Halfling. He
cons blue to a level 39. Unfortunately, his friends jump you when you attack
him. Once you kill him, loot the Ring off his corpse.<br>
<br>
6) Bring all 4 items to Yurdle the Caretaker. He gives you a box and a ghost
spawns to your left. He is invisible, except for his name. Give the box to this
ghost, and you'll recieve your longsword.<br>
<br>
1hs, 16/29. +5 Magic Damage -5 STR, -5 STA, +12 DEX, +10 Magic Save, +15 AC, +2
Ability mod: Divination.<br>
<br>
Sweet sword for how simple the quest is.<br>
