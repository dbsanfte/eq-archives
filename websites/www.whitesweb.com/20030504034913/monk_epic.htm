The Celestial Fists<br>
<br>
You are required very early on in the Quest to hand in your RotWF, but if you
are 46+ and have a lot of friends or are in a guild, you will be able to take
the Fists first to get the Fang, then complete the RotWF. The start of the Epic
Quest originates with Tomekeeper Dahl, on the second floor within the Erudite
Library.<br>
<br>
'Hail Tomekeeper Dahl'<br>
<br>
Tomekeeper Danl says 'Good day, citizen. Please remember to keep your voice down
in our library. Feel free to browse the extensive collection of books we have on
display. Learning is all about you and our library is the greatest collection of
educational literature in the world, as you can no doubt see. However, there are
a few books we do not own and we are prepared to pay well to acquire [rare
finds].<br>
<br>
'What rare finds?'<br>
<br>
Tomekeeper Danl says 'Yes, any rare books, tomes, essays, or other literature
you find may be of interested to me. Although the finds I am interested in are
quite high profile and would most likely only be found in the possession of very
powerful or influential beings. Give me what you have found and I will pay you
what it is worth to us.<br>
<br>
The book he requires is called the book of Immortals, a book found in Skyfire.
It drops from any of the following - 'Soul Devourer' , 'lava walker' , 'Black
Scar', 'a wandering wurm', 'a Shadow Drake', 'Guardian of Felia', or any other
of the named mobs there.<br>
<br>
The following is the text from the book of Immortals:<br>
<br>
The immortals who can be spoken of are not the Eternal Immortals. Their Spoken
names are not the eternal names. In the namelessness they are the beginning of
heaven and earth. Named they are one of the ten thousand things.<br>
Though different in title they spring from one source and appear as darkness
Darkness within darkness. The gate to their mystery. The immortals do not go
forth. All comes to them. They are like the ocean, the king of ten thousand
streams. By staying beneath they are a receptacle for all things. They do
nothing. Yet are masters of the universe. Trorsmang! Be our course of action.
Anbeal! Become the Vessel to hold our virtue. Drina! Be our stability, where we
can take root. Cordan! Fill our vessels and calm our ambitions. Norrath! Take
our husks and breathe life into them. We beseech you! Guide us in your humility.<br>
<br>
Giving Tomekeeper Dahl the Book of Immortals, prompts the following:<br>
<br>
Tomekeeper Danl gasps at the sight of the rare book and says, 'This is a great
find indeed! I can only imagine who you had to.. persuade to give you the book.
Our library would be very interested in acquiring this and I am prepared to give
you this platinum and a referral that marks you as a friend of the library. If
only [Lheao] could see this.'<br>
<br>
'Who is Lheao?'<br>
<br>
Tomekeeper Danl says 'Lheao was my predecessor here at the Library of Erudin. He
has since retired, just a few years ago. I'm sure he would be most impressed
with your find and offer insightful conversation on the subject. Although I'm
not sure one of your profession would be interested in such a scholarly
endeavor, no offense. If you are interested, find him and tell him you found the
book 'Immortals.' I'm not sure where he has retired to, but I hear it is near an
ocean somewhere.<br>
<br>
He gives you a piece of paper, Danl's reference, which identifies as 'Paper with
the Erudin Library Seal'<br>
<br>
Lheao is found in the Timerous Deep in the hidden oasis. The loc is
approximately neg 11500, neg 2000, where you will run into a huge rock wall that
is a huge ring of solid rock. There is an underwater tunnel, which goes under
this wall, at approx neg 11357 neg 3657.<br>
<br>
Once through that tunnel, you surface and see another huge rock. This second
huge rock has another tunnel, so you have to stay underwater, and find the
tunnel that goes under it. This finally leads you to the hidden oasis, where you
see the hut with the ramp and Lhaeo.<br>
<br>
'Hail Lhaeo'<br>
<br>
Lheao jumps at your voice and begins laughing at his skittishness. He says, 'Ahh,
hello there. Not many people know of this place, so visitors are quite rare.
Hehehe. It's a very beautiful place indeed, so, ummm, please don't go telling
everyone you know about it. Heheh. Thanks, friend.'<br>
<br>
'I have found the book Immortals'<br>
<br>
Lheao looks up at you, eyes wide in astonishment, and says, 'My god, you found
'Immortals'?! Where did you find it? Never mind, that is unimportant. I have in
my possession a book that explains more about these individuals. Its value is
unimaginable as well as the impact it is capable of. As you can see, I grow old.
I need an individual to watch over this book and make sure it is protected.
Would you be willing to [take this responsibility]?'<br>
<br>
'I will take this responsibility'<br>
<br>
Lheao says 'I'm sorry, Kage , but I could only give this book to a true master,
such as a member of the Whistling Fists Order. And unless you can give me proof
that you are one, in addition to Danl's reference, which is very unlikely, there
is no way I'll let you take charge of [the Celestial Fists].<br>
<br>
'What Celestial Fists?'<br>
<br>
Lheao says 'The Celestial Fists is the title of a book written by an unknown
author. His writing is sub par but the legend is interesting from a biographical
standpoint alone. Its rarity commands top dollar in the scholarly community but
the secrets revealed in the book are what truly makes it dangerous. I've thought
many times to destroy it but just couldn't. I hope I'm able to find someone to
watch over it soon.<br>
<br>
Once the Robe of the Whistling Fists and note (Dahl's reference) are handed in,
the following is said.<br>
<br>
Lheao says 'Astonishing! To think that you are a master of an order thought to
be lost to our world. Forgive my earlier doubts. I believe you are indeed worthy
to be given the responsibility of watching over this book. Take great care that
it does not fall into the wrong hands as it would be truly disastrous<br>
The Celestial Fists Book is illegible.<br>
<br>
~~The Kaiaren's~~<br>
<br>
The next step is someone called Kaiaren, who is located at Loc -1609, -2679,
just as you come into the upper Sebilis Ruins in Trakanons Teeth.<br>
<br>
<br>
'Hail Kaiaren'<br>
<br>
Kaiaren says, &quot; AHHH get it away from me go away .. leave me alone&quot;.<br>
<br>
'What Celestial Fists'<br>
<br>
Kaiaren says 'Eh? What's that? Bah! That was destroyed long ago. Don't waste my
time with fairy taAAAAAGGHHH GET IT AWAY!!!! HELP!!! They're all over
MEHEHEHEHEEEEEEee!!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Handing Kaiaren the book Celestial Fists prompts:Kaiaren's eyes open wide and he
attacks you!<br>
<br>
Upon death he says 'Not bad.. Now lets see if you can find my trueform if you do
we discuss this further.'<br>
<br>
Note: You do not need to kill Kaiaren, as giving him the book and feigning him
off works fine.<br>
<br>
The next step is to find Kaiaren's true form, which spawns when the book is
given to the mad Kaiaren. He is also called Kaiaren, and is located near the
lake in Trakanons Teeth. He spawns at approx 300, 2400 in a building next to the
lake. He is level 60+ and indifferent.<br>
<br>
When you hand him the book, he says the following:<br>
<br>
Important Note: The Book is returned to you, but it is NOT the same. The
properties of this book have now been changed, and although you cannot tell, it
is different. Please DO NOT hand this book over again until the final stage.<br>
<br>
Kaiaren says 'Now, then. Where did you find this, monk? This is not just some
light reading to be borrowed from the town library. Who gave this to you?<br>
<br>
'I got it from lheao'<br>
<br>
Kaiaren says 'Hmmm, never heard of him. Well, it doesn't matter, the book is
here now. Curse that idiot for writing it in the first place. Not even sure why
I let him stick around. If you ever see that clown monk Aradiel kick him in the
shins for me! At any rate, I suppose you'd like to find the Fists and [have a
nice chat with them], eh? Their master owes me much. I would reward you well if
you were to bring me proof of the master's defeat'<br>
<br>
'I would like to have a nice chat with them'<br>
<br>
Kaiaren says 'Yes, I suppose you would. All you children looking for fame and
glory will eventually learn the poison of ambition. But how will you find them?
They are able to meld with their elements seamlessly and they certainly have no
interest in fooling with the likes of you. No, you will need to get their
attention. Fortunately, I know [how you can do this].<br>
<br>
'how can I do this?'<br>
<br>
Kaiaren says, 'My guess is that the weakest of the Fists will be the easiest to
draw out. he is egotistical and arrogant. How he came to master the Discipline
of Fire, I do not know. He will most likely be in another form, one of his
element. When you find the one you believe to be the Fist, you must challenge
him. If you use his true name, Eejag, in your formal challenge, he will respond.
A flame can burn intensely but it cannot last for long. Know this when you
battle him.<br>
<br>
~~The Celestial Fists~~<br>
<br>
~~Eejag~~<br>
<br>
In Lavastorm, there is an wandering Imp, larger than the others, called 'a fire
Sprite'. The sprite looks to be pretty common and seems to travel from the druid
ring to the southeast and back again. He is also a very low lvl imp. If Eejag is
already spawned he won't shout to the zone when you say the challenge to the
sprite. To initiate the sequence, hail the Fire Sprite with:<br>
<br>
'I Challenge Eejag'<br>
<br>
The fire sprite disappears and the zone gets a message...<br>
<br>
Eejag shouts What imbecile dares challenges a Celestial Fist?! Do you even know
who you are challenging? HA! You are nothing but an insect! I will enjoy
crushing you, I have not<br>
<br>
charred the flesh of an idiot in decades! If you truly wish to fight me, the
battle shall be held in my own element. Come, challenger, come down to the pits
of flowing fire.<br>
<br>
Now go to the fire pit by the Solesek's and under the middle smoke plume, half
way down an Iksar will be swimming. He is lvl 55, max hits for 157, but seems to
swing very slow. Eejag will NOT be pulled. He refuses to move from his spawn
spot, which is about half way down the lava, right in the middle. When you get
summoned, you appear on the bottom of the lake directly beneath him, where he
can hit you, but you cant hit him. He can summon you regardless of if you are in
the lava or not. Visibility is VERY bad.<br>
<br>
Tactics: Min 2 Groups, and buff everyone with Dead Man Floating, Enduring Breath
and Regen. One person goes down and gets the target then comes back up. Everyone
charges in, including the Clerics, so they could do group heals, as the lava
does not interrupt spells. Everyone then assists the person with target and find
him via the /yell command.<br>
<br>
Other tactics involve all floating above him, and sending the tanks and caster
pets in, and popping back up to the surface to the Clerics for heals.<br>
<br>
Once killed, he drops nothing but the Charred Scale, which Identifies as the
Remains of the Fists of Fire.<br>
<br>
Note: Eejag can be summoned again immediatly after death by challenging the Fire
Sprite again, there is no 'respawn time'.<br>
<br>
You then hand the Charred Scale to the True Form in Trakanon's Teeth. The scale
is returned to you, and you get the following:<br>
<br>
Kaiaren says 'Ahhh, impressive indeed! Now that you have broken the chain of the
Fists, the others may come toppling down if you persevere. The Fist of Air is
now the weakest, then Earth, and finally Water before the master of them all,
Vorash. You must defeat them in order, proving the demise of the last to draw
out the one you are after. The task before you now is to take this scale and
show it to the Fist of Air wherever he may be. Good luck, Zadkiel .<br>
<br>
~~Gwan~~<br>
<br>
A presence, is found in the Plane of Sky, and is the Place Holder for the Fist
of Air. The presence seems to have a respawn time of approx 2 hours. He has the
model of a shadowed man, but carries no items, so is invisible apart from his
name.<br>
<br>
Note: The Charred Scale does not have to be cycled through Kaiaren's true form
before being given to 'a presence', so this part can be skipped, but it is
advisable to follow the story as intended.<br>
<br>
If you travel to sky, rather than paying for the keys, kill the fairies, and
have everyone loot a miniature sword. If you then kill the thunder spirit
princess, she will spawn Sirran the lunatic. When everyone hands in the mini
swords, you get a key of swords back. As with many guides on Sky, do not speak,
(use /ooc instead) as if anyone says the key word [hassle] he will despawn. It
is advisable not to buff people up until you are in sky, as zoning up removes
all buffs. Now find the 'soapdish ashtray key platform thing' {Hotrod's term,
not mine}, and drop the key on to use it, and it takes you to Dojorn isle, where
the presence and Gwan are.<br>
<br>
Hand the Presence the scale for the following:<br>
<br>
a presence says 'Hahaha! That dolt Eejag fell to the likes of you? I'm not
surprised. So, I guess this means you're here to challenge me. Normally, I
wouldn't waste my time, but since you've defeated my younger brother, I suppose
I'm obligated. I'm ready when you are, tell me when you're [prepared].<br>
<br>
At this point the presence despawns and immediately respawns in the same
location as a Human monk dressed in shiverback named Gwan. Telling him 'I am
prepared' causes him to attack.<br>
<br>
He doesn't respond to hails, and is lvl 57. He procs Fist of Air, which a lvl 57
resisted every proc with a MR of 120.<br>
<br>
He has approx 14khp, (parsed by Sister Loani of Druzzil Ro) hits for 165, and
the Fist of Air proc can knock you backwards, and like other mobs of this level,
enrages.<br>
<br>
Upon death, Gwan's corpse lets out one last, frustrated breath and gasps, 'Trunt!
Prepare yourself!'<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Tactics:The 'a presence' is on Dojorn's island, which also contains the
bladestorms, but they have been confirmed that they will not attack and help, or
KS Gwan.<br>
<br>
You cannot trade with the presence (i.e. give him the scale from Eejag,) while
it is in the windmill. It is best to give the scale to a presence, causing Gwan
to spawn, then pull Gwan into the windmill and kill him. Pulling him is
recommended to be done while in Melee range, i.e. WALKING backwards with him.
Running off nearly always causes him to path incorrectly, and disappear to
another island. It is highly recommended to pull him into the Windmill.<br>
<br>
It is possible for 6 people to kill Gwan (although it is recommend to have more,
the original group was high 50's-60th lvl). Gwan is 100% MR, and only the lure
line spells seem to hit him. He also required melee range for even Lure line to
stick.<br>
<br>
He drops nothing but the Breath of Gwan, which id's as Item Lore: Remains of the
Fist of Air.<br>
<br>
Important Note: Do not hand the The Breath of Gwan to the true form of Kaiaren,
as it will be eaten. The Breath is required for the next step, Trunt.<br>
<br>
~~Trunt~~<br>
<br>
Within the mines of Nurga, which is located in the Frontier Mountains, there is
'a sleeping Ogre', near a number of spiders not too far into the dungeon. A good
marker is a unique graphic to this dungeon, which is a smoking hole in the wall,
where you can see lava. When he is spawned he is looking right at that crevice
in the wall. The Sleeping Ogres respawn time is approx 1 hour 45 mins.<br>
<br>
He is KOS, and he says nothing except some kind of sleeping message when you
hail him while charmed. Turning in the breath of Gwan spawns Trunt, which is
done by sneaking behind him, or charming him, and gets this response:<br>
<br>
a sleeping ogre says 'Your path of wanton destruction ends here, Southern . Gwan
and Eejag were impatient and hot-headed. You will not defeat me, for I have the
patience and perseverance of stone, unlike the children you have beaten before
me. Are you sure you want to challenge me, Southern?<br>
<br>
When answering the Sleeping Ogre, Trunt, who is KOS, spawns.He is around 59th
level Ogre, who double hits for around 176, and has approx 19k hp (again parsed
by Sister Loani of Druzzil Ro), and is also immune to magic. He also attacks
faster than the others.<br>
<br>
Trunt has no faction, and says no message when he dies. He drops nothing but the
Head.<br>
<br>
Trunts Head identifies as Remains of the fist of earth.<br>
<br>
~~Deep~~<br>
<br>
The next of the Celestial Fists is Deep. She is approx a level 58 Dark Elf, and
lives under Lake Rathe, and is surrounded by Bloodgill Goblins. Her location is
under the 3 Bird platform (the one with the flame on it)<br>
<br>
When Trunts head is handed to her, she says the following.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deep slowly opens her eyes and looks up at you. She stares at you a long while
and then closes her eyes and lowers her head again, saying, 'Very well, Arakos,
if you wish death so greatly, we will be happy to oblige. My master projects
part of himself in the wilder lands known as the Overthere. He has granted you
an audience. Find him and show him the head of our earth brother. At that point,
we will discuss how we will end your life.<br>
<br>
No Experience is received and Deep despawns immediately. You get the Head of
Trunt handed back.<br>
<br>
<br>
Note: Trunts Head does not have to be cycled through Deep, and this part can be
skipped, but as mentioned above, it is advisable to follow the story as
intended.<br>
<br>
~~Astral Projections~~<br>
<br>
Moving on, we have the Astral Projections. There is one in the Overthere, and
one in the Lake of Ill Omen, with the Overthere Astral Projection being the
first of the two. He is approx 52nd level, and if fought was hitting for 175
damage, and says nothing on death. His approximate location is 772, 860, neg
494, and is in the bottom of the scorpion chasm. He does not need to be fought.<br>
<br>
Handing the Projection Trunts head, results in the following:<br>
<br>
Astral Projection looks up and down and says, 'Hmmm, I was hoping for something
more impressive. This is just a small token of the last person who tried to
interfere with my plans. He failed as you shall. But tell me truly, are you the
one who has so rudely removed my students?'<br>
<br>
'yes'<br>
<br>
Astral Projection says 'I assume you have read about us and spoken with the old
man, Kaiaren. Since that time, I have grown in power and influence to a point
unseen by any mortal. Unfortunately, I will have to demonstrate a small amount
of my skill when I destroy you. This is bad. I must decide whether you are
worthy to see the techniques I wield, even though you will die shortly
thereafter. Tell me, Ashana , who are you?<br>
<br>
'I am the one'<br>
<br>
Astral Projection chuckles and says, 'That's quite a boast, Ashana. All beings
strive for nothingness at the most basic<br>
<br>
level of sentience. However, almost none ever achieve this. Not even I have
discarded my ego yet and you stand here and tell me you have? Perhaps you will
be a worthy opponent. I shall be waiting in the great lake near here. Take that
token as proof of things to come for you. If you still wish to throw your life
away so needlessly, return it to my image there. I await your decision.'<br>
<br>
<br>
He will give you an Eye of Kaiaren, and then the Astral Projection despawns.<br>
<br>
He is a 3 hour spawn.<br>
<br>
It is not sure where in the text the Eye of Kaiaren is given, and it is only the
final text (telling him that 'I am the one') that despawns the Projection. So it
is possible to give in Trunts head, receive the eye and leave the AP without
despawning him.<br>
<br>
Note: As with the previous warnings, for the sake of someone else waiting 3
hours for the respawn, I would despawn the projection. There were (prior to a
recent patch) chances that Deep would spawn in the LoIO alone, without Vorash,
so anything to minimize that chance is helpful.<br>
<br>
~~The Final Fight~~<br>
<br>
The second of the Astral Projections is in the Lake of Ill Omen, and is on a
platform on the lake itself. The Platform is too high to climb onto, but SoW and
Levitation can get you up there. He is identical in appearance to the other
Projection.<br>
<br>
Note: Another way to minimize the chances of Vorash and Deep not spawning
together, is to have your groups on the edges of the platform, and hand the
'eye' in at the maximum distance allowed for trading. You can never be too
careful.<br>
<br>
When you give the Eye of Kaiaren to the Astral Projection, he despawns
immediatly, and Deep and Vorash both spawn, who are KOS.<br>
<br>
Deep procs Fist of Water, and hits for 170ish. Vorash procs Fist of Mastery,
which is a DD and a stun, and hits for around the same as Deep.<br>
<br>
Both Deep and Vorash have no items.<br>
<br>
Once killed, Vorash says 'Foolish mortal! You think you have defeated me? Now,
witness the true power of Rallos Zek!<br>
<br>
Xenevorash will then spawn on the platform, regardless of where Vorash dies.<br>
<br>
<br>
Xenovorash Procs Fist of Sentience which is a 500DD and a stun, and hits for 250
ish.<br>
<br>
Once he is killed, his death message is:<br>
<br>
Xenevorash's corpse shouts 'Grraaaagghhhh!! NOT.. POSSIBLE!<br>
<br>
He drops a Demon's Fang.<br>
<br>
<br>
Tactics: The final battle was done with 4 groups, which where all 52 to 58th
level, one group was on Deep, all with high CR, and 3 groups where all on Vorash,
with high MR. Due to the large amount of people involved, the fight was not bad,
with no casualties.<br>
<br>
Some groups pull Deep and Vorash to the 'beach', and this is normally done by a
Bard or Druid with a faster than SoW song/spell, but this is not nescesary, and
the fight can easily be done on the platform. However, fighting on the beach
does allow a brief time to rebuff for the Xenevorash fight.<br>
<br>
Xenevorash always runs on low health, so if fighting on the platform, he will
run into the water.<br>
<br>
The Astral Projection respawns 3 hours after Xenevorash has been killed.<br>
<br>
~~The Celestial Fists~~<br>
<br>
Please remember that the book needed to be handed to the True Form first, for
you to receive the quest information in the first place, (as in he prompts you
to look for Eejag.) Once this (now different) book has been returned to you, it
is now ready to be handed to Kaiaren along with the Fang.<br>
<br>
Handing either form of Kaiaren (Mad or True) the Book and the Fang, results in
the Celestial Fists being handed over, with the following text.<br>
<br>
Kaiaren bows his head and breathes a long sigh as if relived of a great weight.
He then looks up at you and says, 'I honestly did not believe you could have
defeated Vorash. Even though he sought nothing but war and bloodshed, it is a
life nonetheless and we must mourn him. I will sew these fangs into magical fist
wraps and they shall be yours. Remember Xenevorash. A purpose can be found for
every situation and individual. To achieve perfection is to perceive this
truth.'<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Effect Celestial Tranquility is a right clickable 40% Song haste, +12 AC and
+40 Att. Its duration is 9 seconds.<br>
<br>
They also change the Damage/Delay of both of your fists to 9/16, not including
any Haste you may already have.<br>
Haste Item Haste Total Damage Delay of Fists<br>
None 0% 9 dmg 16 dly<br>
Right Click Effect of Celestial Fists 40% 9 dmg 13 dly<br>
With right click + FBSS 61% 9 dmg 11 dly<br>
With right click + CoF 76% 9 dmg 10 dly<br>
Max Item + Max Enchanter Haste 85% 9 dmg 9 dly<br>
<br>
Because of the Songs 9 second duration, it is recommended to customize a hotkey
with the Flying Kick skill, so that you will know when to refresh it.<br>
<br>
The Particle effect does not show if weapons are wielded, but a 2HB weapon will
show the effect in the off hand.<br>

Raker for nearly all of the pics, Hotrod, Leonardo and others for some
additional info, and and obviously Wakefield for completing the quest first.
Last but not least, Derra and Bloodscale, who handed in their RotWF before it
was known to do so. Brave brave ppl......<br>

<br>
Celestial Fist Amendments by Verant:<br>
<br>
September 2000: The Lheao section was not very clear. He said something along
the lines of &quot;I need proof you are from Dahl and proof of your
mastery.&quot; but only AFTER you have already given him the note. Telling Lheao
that you have the book 'Immortals.' did not trigger him like it should. The
proof of Mastery, after a leap of faith from both Derra and Bloodscale, was
found to be the RotWF. Kaiaren also says one more line than he used to. A patch
added the information we have now.<br>
<br>
October: Kaiarens true form was bugged, and turning in the scale from Eejag
resulted in xp and the return of the scale. This was able to be done multiple
times, and was rumored to have very quickly leveled a Monk from 40 to 60 in this
manner. The following are patch messages from the time before the quest was
finished.<br>
<br>
Due to some difficulties regarding the Epic Quests implemented two patches ago,
the epic quests for the Monk, Wizard, and Druid will not be completable until
the next patch. While we would like to have implemented updates right away for
these issues, we are mid-way in our conversion to support the DirectX changes
that have been announced.<br>
<br>
We appreciate your patience.<br>

This was also added in a EQ Forum:<br>

I verified that the Celestial Fist of Earth is spawning on live servers and made
sure that part of the quest works. He is and it does. Kaiaren as you all know
has been permakilled on live servers due to the Charred Scale exploit, something
I should have caught in development and testing should have caught in testing
and I apologize for it. He will be back up and fixed after the next patch.<br>
<br>
Thanks, Solist<br>
<br>
It was (not long) later found that the Earth fist (a sleeping Ogre/Trunt) was
indeed in the game, as at this time, Monks did not believe he was.<br>
<br>
November: The Quest was completed on Test, due to the fact that Kaiaren was not
(and is still not as of early November) back in the game on the live servers.
The Haste is Item Haste, and the Robe was not returned, so effectively making
most Monks able to do the quest, at a loss Haste wise. Those lucky enough to
have CoF or Belt of Tranquility where already at 36% to 40% Haste, and that did
not include the 25% Haste of the Robe. Even those with a FBSS (21%) and the robe
where at 46% Haste total. Now they have increased the item haste to 40%, but
lost the robes effects. This is not of consequence to some, but the Robe was one
of our best Chest pieces, and makes the quest seem not too viable in some
peoples eyes.<br>
<br>
Wakefield, the Monk with the CF's was asked to do some feedback relating to the
CF's, and sent a diplomatic email explaining that the Str and Haste where not
really on par with an epic weapon, which is more or less what I have said above.
He mentioned Att bonuses rather than Str, and perhaps better haste. He then
received this email as a reply from Soloist, the Quest writer:<br>
<br>
Thanks for the feedback. There are indeed some problems due to code changes that
were made regarding the Celestial Fists and they are not currently working as I
intended. I won't give you the details on exactly what they are supposed to do
but we will have them fixed and working properly before our next patch. I just
want to assure everyone in the monk community that they won't be going live the
way they are, and that nothing on Test is guaranteed to be the same on live.<br>
<br>
Thanks, ~Solist<br>
<br>
Wakefield then replied with this post a few days later:<br>
<br>
&quot;I hate to say this, but yeah the fists have been changed... and no I cant
tell you how =P. Solist asked me for feedback again and asked if I could keep it
secret. Haha, I feel like a dick but I will be keeping this new change secret.
Best I can say is.... me like&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They will increase damage and he asked for some fast feedback before it
goes live. I noticed 2 potential problems with the new change and 1 is easily
resolvable by us. Emailed him again with some more points only a experienced
monk user could give and a coder wouldnt think of, I think its gonna work out.
Soon as this is live and yall do the quest I'll join ya all in philosophizing,
hehe.&quot;<br>
<br>
A few days later, someone then cracked the SPDat on test, and noticed that the
40 bns to Str has been changed to Att instead.<br>
<br>
The patch on November 15th Changed the CF's permanent effect of 40% Item haste,
+12ac and +40str, to what they are now. Before the patch, the CF's also did not
change the properties of the HtH of those who wielded them.<br>
