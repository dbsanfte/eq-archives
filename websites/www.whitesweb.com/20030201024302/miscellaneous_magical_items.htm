<p align="left">This quest originates by talking to Vilissia within the Temple
of Solusek Ro.<br>
<br>
Vilissia says 'The Acumen Mask, as its name suggests, confers to its wearer
certain<br>
powers of insight and knowledge.<br>
<br>
Vilissia says 'I can make for you an Acumen Mask, but you will need to bring me
the<br>
proper components. I will need a Glowing Mask from a Skeletal Monk in the
Caverns of<br>
Guk, A Patch of Shadow from our mortal enemies the Shadowed Men, a Darkbone
Skull<br>
from a Darkbone Skeleton in the Estate of Unrest and a Bonechipped Mask from a
Goblin<br>
Headmaster in the Ocean of Tears.<br>
<br>
Patch of Shadow- this is dropped by Shadowmen (roughly level 25 -30), the place
I hunted<br>
them to get it was in west commons in the corner of the zone wall, if you follow
the right<br>
zone wall from Kithicor when facing outwards. you will only see their name and
the<br>
weapons they carry because they are transparent. (Get this item last. All
Shadowmen<br>
items are NO RENT which means they will dissapear from your inventory once you
log out.)<br>
<br>
Darkbone Skull- found off of a GREATER darkbone skeleton (roughly level 27-28)
in<br>
Unrest. Note- I went around blasting normals for an hour then killed a greater
in a train<br>
and it had it :P (Many of these spawn near the bloodpool and the Ghost in the
basement.)<br>
<br>
Glowing mask- this is found in Upper Guk, NOT Unrest. If you go towards the main
lower<br>
guk zone there is the place that you cross a plank (it is also filled with Heart
Spiders),<br>
jump in the water and search around for a hidden room. Within that room you will
find<br>
Tempus, a Dark Elf Necromancer (roughly level 25 -26). The Skeleton Monk
(roughly level<br>
24-25) with the mask will be next to him (if you attack the monk, the necro and
his pet will<br>
join in). I have been told by some that the Necro will not join but he will
attempt to heal<br>
the Skeletal Monk. (note:Glowing Mask has been found upon the Scryer in Upper
Guk and<br>
did work as a component for the quest) (If you cross the wooden plank in<br>
the Spider room, look to your left and you will see a ladder that leads to a
ledge<br>
and another below that leads from the ledge to the water. Swim to the very
bottom there<br>
and follow the wall to the right, you will find the room up in an 'air pocket'
there.)<br>
<br>
Bonechipped Mask- This is dropped by the Goblin Headmaster (roughly level 24-25)
on the<br>
Isle Goblin island in the Ocean of Tears. This is the same island the Oracle is
on (known to<br>
some as the Oracle Island). If you still don't know where this is, keep
following the pier on<br>
the Sisters' island and swim out into the ocean until you see the island. The
Headmaster<br>
spawns in front of a small hut and drops the mask fairly often (2 out of 6 times
was my<br>
experience). Verant was furthermore merciful - he spawns every 5 to 10 minutes.
He has<br>
approximately 900hp. The shamans that spawn near him go down easily, it might be
a<br>
good idea to take them out first. (Follow the water's edge around the Goblin
island until<br>
you see a stone ruin. There is a Goblin hut near that ruin and the Headmaster
spawns in<br>
front of that hut.)<br>

<p align="left"><b><a name="Earthen Boots">Earthen Boots</a></b></p>
<p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Earthern Boots-</b>Ac:5, STAM
5, HP 15 EFFECT: INV TO ANIMAL. When you right click this it looks like your
casting JM boots with the red surrounding spell =). Inf Casts and No drop. It
adds about 30 HP to a lvl 36 magician. <b>ITEMS:</b> Soiled Boots Stone Marker
Heart of Stone Cats eye Agate (1) This Quest comes from Joyce in Temple of Sol
Ro. <b>SOILED BOOTS-</b> Comes from a, exact name, &quot;a tonta knight&quot;.
He is at the top of the Spiraled Stairs in Upper Guk. Also surrounded by some
froggie buddies. One happens to be a shaman who can heal/buff. The others are
mostly Ton Knights or Warriors who can double for 40-55. Ow. To get to him Enter
Guk and go straight until you reach a &quot;C&quot; like plank, take the left
way. Then go down the other plank and head straight. You should see lots of
frogs but 2-3 in front of this entrance, and to your left should be a Ramp.
Either A)Kill frogs and go up the Spiral Stairs or B) just inv and get to the
top. Then the Tonta should be up there. Doesn't always spawn but often does.
Took me 3 times to get boots. The second he didn't spawn. And the other 2 didn't
drop'em. <b>STONE MARKER-</b> Comes from &quot;a Glyphed Guard&quot; in Castle
Mistmoore *zone not real castle*(or MM). To find the Guard's they should be in
the Graveyard. To get there enter MM. Go straight until you hit the wall to the
main room and make a right, follow wall and take the FIRST left. Follow it until
you find a turn to your left, and one to your right. Look to your right you will
see the GRAVEYARD. Bingo there you are. The guard is common spawn and common
drop. Took me 2 times to get the stone. Very Easy for a 36 magi. Theres a
Shadowman behind the hut that has a Robe of the Keeper (+3 int, AC:8, Pure Red).
Robe witch you might wanna get for fun. BTW he cast spellz and is kinda mean.
Has major HP for a greenie *grin*. Also a IMP is around there that dropps a
dagger for them Necros. RARE drop/Spawn. so have fun in that zone. <b>HEART OF
STONE-</b> This is dropped in Lake Rathe near SPAWN 1 off of Stone Skeletons (lvl
26 Mages with Shock of Spikes. a 100+dd and a Earth Pet). Me and a lvl 40 ranger
took these simpley. Once you kill them with there pet, they spawn again, but not
with pet they have to summon it. So it makes it kinda makes the skeles a easy
kill and they are a normal spawn, common drop. They also drop a Rod of Bone for
them wizzys quest. If you dunno where Spawn 1 is, goto the Arena (gotta know
where that is). When your comming out go right and follow the Wall, or when your
coming otta SK follow the right Wall.and just keep going. You should see about 3
entrance ways when comeing from SK to your right, don't go in keep on the wall!
And just follow it till you start seeing grass and a PLANK to your up right
area. You should see a birdy on it if no one is killing it. <b>CATS EYE AGATE-</b>
Simple. Buy it for about 2 gold a piece at any jewler. And WALA! BOOTS! Any
Information about this Quest E-mail me at &quot;Stryker__13@yahoo.com&quot; and
gimmie whatcha need. I also know how to do the Robe of the Elements Quest as
well and know about all Focus items on mage and most things uner lvl 36 =).

<p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="2">Heres a tad better guide in my
opinion then the one i used, ill edit the one i used and make it better. I just
beat this quest and i know the problems you will encounter.<br>
<br>
I reccomend a chanter for this quest, its very easy with one. Maybe some dark
elf caster will work too, not sure, its not a hard quest, takes a while though,
2-4 hours depending on if you die like me :).<br>
<br>
<br>
1). First, go to the docks in East Freeport, and look on the left, facing away
from the water and youll see a tavern. Go inside. The man inside is the guy who
will give you the Bartenders Compedium which can be traded in Ogguk for the
Stein. After you bind, take the boat and head to sister isle, its the first stop
on the boat.<br>
<br>
2). Look in one of the shops on one of the merchants and buy a Kiola nut, you
can get as many as you need, but you only need one, then gate back to East
Freeport.<br>
<br>
3). Now you need 3 Honeycombs. Kithicor is a good place to get them. Go to west
freeport, then east commons, then west commons, then take the road in west
commons on the left fork to get there. Make sure you enter Kithicor after 9AM or
undead monsters will kill you (trust me). Find Bixie fairy things and kill them,
and they drop honey combs. The vendors in the houses also might have them.<br>
<br>
4). Go see Kizzie Mintopp in Rivervale, give her 3pp (or 30 gold) and 3
honeycomb. She gives you the Honey Jum. you should have half<br>
of the components necessary for the book (kiola nut and honey jum from Kizzie).<br>
<br>
5). Invis yourself and run back through Highpass, EK, NK, WK, and Qeynos Hills
until you get to N Qeynos. I took a port wich was easier :p.<br>
<br>
6). Camp by the pond at the paladin's guild in N Qeynos and start a new
character. Make this character a Half-Elf<br>
pally that worships the Prime Healer, or Rodcet Nife and put all their stat
points into STR(a human sk starting in qeynos works to put all your points into
strength for a better harm touch and harm touch the fish)<br>
<br>
7). Find the fish in the pond, its very tiny, and kill it. You can be on your
main if u don't mind the faction loss. After you kill it look on its corpse and
you may find a Fish Corpse. That is what u need. If it doesnt drop the first
time you kill it dont worry, it will. Took me 5 kills before i found it.<br>
<br>
7). Now your chanter should have the kiola nut, honey jum, and koalindl corpse,
so head to S Qeynos and take the boat to<br>
Erudin.<br>
<br>
8). Go to Geoard Bluehawk (in the Bluehawk Inn, of course) and buy an Innoruuk's
Kiss of Death if u turn around and walk<br>
out the door to the inn, there is a 3-story building ahead and to the right, in
the middle of the area. Go inside and to the 3rd<br>
story. Give the Inny's Kiss to Sinnkin Highbrow, she will give you tonic, now
you have all the components! YAY<br>
<br>
9). At this point you can cast gate if u didn't bind yourself anywhere, and
ta-dah, you're at E freeport<br>
<br>
10). Go the the bar and hail the guy bartender.(his name is gregor and is
located in the bar oppiste the port authority at the docks in e.f.) If he
responds with some jibberish about exotic drinks, give him the 4 components.<br>
You should get the Barkeep's Compendium. At this point if you're in it for the
money, you may want to get the components again<br>
(you CAN have the 4 components AND a book AND a stein at the SAME TIME) but if
you're impatient go now to step 13!<br>
<br>
11). Invis yourself and run to N Ro, Oasis, S Ro, Innothule, and to the Feerott,
and walk into Oggok illusioned as a Dark Elf (look in<br>
the spells section of Everlore to find out how to obtain that illusion, it's a
lvl 12 chanter spell). Be careful in Innothule!!! I died many times there by
ogres, if u see ogres thats the wrong entrance to Feerott. Just take the wall
from the entrance into Innothule and ull hit it. I kept myself invised always.<br>
<br>
12). Walk into Oggok, cast the Dark Elf illusion, and invis yourself. Run
through the open area and past the Priest of Discord and by Kizrak<br>
the Tyrant and into the cave the the ogres are guarding. Take the first left,
then ull see some doors and 2 guards. Go past the guards and youll see a door on
the right. Open it and clurg with a bunch of people is there. When u do find him<br>
turn off invis but still have the illusion on you as a Dark Elf. Dont worry!!
The ogres wont KOS Dark Elves, so dont be worried youll die. Cast the lvl 8
chanter spell Alliance on him and hand him the book. DING!<br>
You got a Stein of Moggok!<br>

<p align="left">Nostrolo Tambourine Quest Walkthrough<br>
Quest Level<br>
This quest may be started as a level 1 bard, simply gather all components from
other players (none are NO DROP) and catch a ride to Fironie Vie to talk to the
banker. If you wanted to quest this yourself, it is feasible around level 35.
Some coins I would suggest getting a group together.<br>
<br>
<br>
Quest Walkthrough<br>
Talk to Wellford Fargin, the banker in Firiona Vie, and ask him about his hobby.
He will tell you that he used to collect rare coins and gems. If you say that
you will help him, he wants you to first replace his prized Star of Odus which
was stolen from him.<br>
<br>
Here's how the conversation goes:<br>
You say, &quot;Hail Wellford Fargin&quot;<br>
Wellford Fargin turns his frown around and begins to smile. &quot;Oh! Hello. It
has been quite some time since someone has been polite and greeted me. Most
adventurers are quite rude. To think I gave up my [hobby] to work day and night
here!!&quot;<br>
You say, &quot;What hobby?&quot;<br>
Wellford Fargin says &quot;I used to collect rare coins and gems. I came to
Fironia Vie to do just that, but I never have the time to [collect rare coins]
when I am always here working.&quot;<br>
You say, &quot;I can collect rare coins.&quot;<br>
Wellford Fargin says &quot;If you want to help, you can begin by replacing my
prized Star of Odus which was taken from my vault when I stepped out to dine. Do
so, and I may trust you to collect the coins. I will also reward you with an
item a composer left here.&quot;<br>
You may easily purchase the Star of Odus for around 105pp from a few of the
jewelers in a jewel shop in Erudin. Come back to Fironia Vie and hand the Star
of Odus to Wellford and he will hand you back the &quot;Tin Box&quot;, which has
6 empty slots. Be sure you have an empty slot because this box requires a slot
all by itself. He will then tell you about the other six coins he has been
looking for.<br>
<br>
<br>
Identifying your coins<br>
Start collecting these coins in various parts of Kunark. They will all say
&quot;An Ancient Coin&quot;, so use your Level 14 song Lyssa's Cataloging
Libretto to correctly identify your coins. Simply pick up one of the coins with
your mouse cursor, and play the song. You will see a message identifying the
coin in hand. These coins are not LORE and NO DROP, so this means you can
auction for them, and may hold multiple coins of each.<br>
<br>
<br>
Coin Values<br>
Be sure to say &quot;Looking for ancient coins&quot;, as many people will just
give them to you for free. Some people might be greedy and will want to charge
100-200pp for them. Hopefully you'll get most of your coins for free, and pay
only 30-40pp for the rest. The Kaesora coin might be a bit expensive, I paid
100pp. It really all depends on how much you want to pay, and if you can wait
for a good deal.<br>
<br>
<br>
The 6 Ancient Coins<br>
Ik Gran - drops off the Captain of the Guard in the City of Mist<br>
Terraz Ton - drops off the Failed Raider in Kaesora<br>
Danak Gran - drops off the Scrounger Scorpion in the Overthere<br>
Veksar Gran - drops off the Bloodgill Goblins in the Lake the Ill Omen<br>
Royal Crown of Dalnir - drops off the Kly Implicator in Dalnir<br>
Torsis Ton - foraged coin in the Emerald Jungle<br>
Completing the Quest<br>
Once you have obtained all six items, put them in the tin box and hit combine.
It will change into a chest and if you hand this back to Wellford, he will
reward you with the Nostrolo Tambourine. This instrument will add about +25% to
percussion songs. It is a nifty new percussion instrument that actually looks
like a tambourine when held. Unfortunately, we still strum it like a lute.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Obtaining the 6 Coins<br>
Ik Gran Coin - drops off the Captain of the Guard in the City of Mist<br>
The Captain of the Guard is a high 30's undead skeleton that can spawn nearly
anywhere in the first half of the City of Mist zone, but pops most frequently at
the bridge gate or in the courtyard, and sometimes the temple. He seems to drop
the coin every time. Just hang out at the zone or /ooc asking for it, usually no
one needs the coin. - (Info submitted by Swyshing)<br>
<br>
<br>
Terraz Ton Coin - drops off the Failed Raider in Kaesora<br>
This coin seems to be the hardest coin to get.<br>
<br>
The failed raider is a random spawn in the Kaesora Library. If there are people
in the library, they usually let you have to coin if they don't have a bard with
them. You have to kill everything in the library and the failed raider will
spawn eventually. While I was there, he spawned 1 time in a 3 hours period of
time. - (Info submitted by Tirade Bunzofsteel)<br>
<br>
<br>
Danak Gran Coin - drops off the Scrounger Scorpion in the Overthere<br>
Grab a group and descend down the canyon. Stay near the canyon entrance. Start
killing Scorpious, and eventually a scrounger will spawn and they always drop a
coin. These scorpious will start out with a Harm Touch which seems to be
unresistable which will bring you down a few bubbles. If you want to solo, I
also hear it is effective to charm two so they use their HT on each other. There
may be more scroungers near the temples, but it might be hard to grab just one
and kite it out to safety.<br>
<br>
<br>
Veksar Gran Coin - drops off the Bloodgill Goblins in the Lake the Ill Omen<br>
Details to come...<br>
<br>
<br>
Royal Crown of Dalnir Coin - drops off the Kly Implicator in Dalnir<br>
Details to come...<br>
<br>
<br>
Torsis Ton Coin - foraged coin in the Emerald Jungle<br>
This is one of the items that may be foraged in the Emerald Jungle Zone. It will
be very hard (but possible) for you to forage it yourself as a bard. There are a
few options for you to obtain this coin:<br>
Have a friendly druid agree to teleport you into Emerald Jungle (you must be in
a Kunark dungeon for the druid to evac you here). Then, the two of you just
forage until you get the coin. It might take some time. In my case, it took a 45
druid an hour and a half to forage one coin.<br>
Create a young Iksar, run to this zone, and start foraging. Many bards have done
this successfully and have gotten their coin within minutes.<br>
Run to the zone yourself. Try and forage up the coin yourself. It has been
reported that a bard has indeed foraged up this coin, so if you have time to
kill, you might want to try yourself. It will just take longer, as you'll get
many failed forages... Emerald Jungle is a deserted place many times, just
people teleporting in to get to The City of Mist, but if you notice a druid or
ranger in the zone, you can ask them to help you forage. Be careful in this zone
though, there are level 35-45 mobs that will hunt you. Emerald Jungle is alot
like Jurassic Park in that respect. Most mobs cannot see through Invisibility or
Superior Camo, except for the undead skeletons.</p>

stone. Effect: Color Shift. Procs at 20, which is when you get the spell anyway.<br>
<br>
I recommend doing all 3 quests at once, and bring along your buddies if you're
like me, level 30. I brought a 51 Warrior (or she brought me, I still can't
tell.)<br>
<br>
For the wand, though, Sultin wants 2 things: a pouch of silver dust and a fully
enchanted wand.<br>
<br>
The wand drops from a Silvered Guard in the Temple of Cazic Thule. There are
only two of them, and they guard the stairs that lead to the the mystical hole
thingy. They spawn about every half hour. Invisibility is your friend! We (ok
the Warrior) killed six before the wand dropped.<br>
<br>
Take your wand to Esmirella in the North Karana gypsy camp. Give her the wand
and 50gp and she will enchant it for you. She then tells you to take the wand to
Raine Beteria in the Erudin Library to get it &quot;fully&quot; enchanted.<br>
<br>
If you're lucky, you can get a port to Toxx from the NK. Run north, cross the
bridge, run north some more, and voila, Erudin. I had to cast Illusion: Erudin
to get a hugh enough faction for her to talk to me. Make sure she replies when
you hail her. Repeat the process you followed to enchant the wand the first
time: give her the wand and 50gp. She gives you the &quot;Fully Enchanted&quot;
wand.<br>
<br>
The pouch of silver dust is dropped from Dusty Werebats in the Estate of Unrest.
They are in the basement. Inside the house, head left, take the first left door
and turn right. There should be a bookcase. Click on it. It opens the secret
door to the basement! My Warrior brought out 4 bats and we got the pouch.<br>
<br>
Take the wand and the pouch back to Sultin in Solusek Ro (along with all the
items for the other two incandescent items if you were bright), hand them over,
and you get the Incandescent Wand. Ta da!

<br>
Sultin needs a Glowing Mask, found on the skeletal monk in the caverns of Guk (I
have also been told you can get one on the froglock scryer) and all three Runes
of Fortune. One Rune can be found on the Dark Elf Enynti in the Chasm below
Castle Mistmoore. The other two can each be purchased for 50 golden coins each -
one from Mizr N`Mar in the Neriak City Library and the other from Madam Serena
in Qeynos.<br>
