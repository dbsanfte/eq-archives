<p>SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER</p>
<p>The first step is in Sol Ro Temple in Lavastorm. There is a wizard in grey
robes there in the same room as the skeletal SKs for the SK armor quests. His
name is Soloman. By speaking with him you should be able to obtain a list of
spell components he requires that needs to be delivered to a person named Camin
in Erudin.<br>
Take the list to Camin, he is in the inn inside Erudin on the second floor. Give
him the list and he with thank you in a surly way and then not say much else.
Here is where people get stuck. Wether it's a bug or it's intentional, he
doesn't mention or hint at the fact that he wants you to prove your loyalty to
his research/cause/whatever. To get him to say more, give him 1000pp exactly. He
will then become more talkative and mention a powerful wizard who was a student
of Solusek Ro himself who went into hiding some time ago named Arantir Karondor.
Giving him the money will also raise your faction with him by a bit.</p>
<p>The next step is to find this reclusive wizard. He is VERY well hidden. In
Halas there are two female vendors just outside of the shaman's guild. One of
them has an unusual item for sale in her usual stock, however, a potion of Ro (I
may have the name slightly off but it's a red/pink potion bottle) that is NO
DROP and has charges of Flame Arc. This potion will cost you about 997pp (give
or take 100pp for faction/cha). Buy one and take it back to Camin in Erudin.
Give it to him and he will confirm that this potion is indeed the work or the
reclusive wizard you seek. He will hand you back a modified potion with no
charges left and tell you that maybe the person who sold you this knows of his
whereabouts.</p>
<p>Take the modified potion back to the same vendor you bought it from and give
it to her. She will despawn and Aratir Karondor will appear (he has a really
cool black and neon green robe on). Hail him and he will admit to being suprised
that someone has discovered his hiding place after so long but will not teach
you anything until you do a favor for him. He wants you to give a ring to a
woman he once loved, and asks you to bring back her reply to him. You should
recieve a ring at this point. He mentions the woman's name (forgive me, I can't
recall it) and asks you to find her in Felwithe. I found her in the Paladin's
guild, although another wizard said she was in the temple at the front of the
city. In any case, hail her and ask her about Arantir Karondor, then give her
the ring. She will give you another ring in exchange and ask you to return it to
him. (Note: If you identify the ring Arantir gives you it says: &quot;Could you
ever love me?&quot; if you identify the ring you get back it says: &quot;I could
never love a man like you.&quot; Ouch! hehe)</p>
<p>Official Disclaimer: This is as far as I have done the quest since I know
what items Arantir will ask for next and I don't feel like spending the 1000pp
to respawn him until I have all of them ready. Yes, thats right. He will despawn
after about 10 min, even if someone is hailing him, so to turn the ring back in,
and/or to turn in the staves of power, you have to buy the potion again, take it
to Camin, etc. etc. etc.</p>
<p>Step two: The Staves of Power</p>
<p>After returning the ring, Arantir will tell you a story about the four
students of Solusek Ro, of which he was one. Of the four, only he and one other
are known to still be alive. As you question him about each one, he will give
you a clue as to where their staves may be found.</p>
<p>The Water Staff is a drop of Phinegel Atropos in Kedge Keep.</p>
<p>The Gnarled Staff is dropped by Venril Sathir in Karnor's Castle</p>
<p>The Air Staff is held by a Gnome wizard who lives near the fort that encloses
the docks in Butcher Block. When you question Arantir about him, he will give
you a letter to give to his old friend. Give the letter to the gnome and he will
agree to give you the staff for some items he needs to complete an experiment of
his. The items you need include a pouch of mistletoe powder from one of the big
frog guys near the crypt in Sebilis, and the other hard one is a &quot;Soft yet
supple skin&quot; that he wants to wrap his explosives in. The skin is Cazic's
skin, and used to drop off of Cazic-Thule himself. Since the upgrades to the
planes, it now drops from Terror, one of the three big golems. Give the gnome
what he asks for and you'll recieve the third staff.</p>
<p>Take the three staves back to Arantir and give them to him. He will add his
own staff, seal them in a bag and hand it back to you. Take this sealed bag back
to Soloman in Sol Ro Temple and he will reward you with The Staff of the Four.</p>
<p>Final disclaimer: Since I am writing this off the cuff, I haven't included
any locs or the gnome's name since I can't remember them. I'm sorry. If someone
who has proceeded with this quest further than myself knows thiese informations,
please post them in this thread.</p>
<p>I hope this helps all of you who are aspiring to claim your epic weapons some
day.</p>
