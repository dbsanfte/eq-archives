<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>I would put all the officers e-mails up but alot fo people dont want thier e-mail addresses displayed . the only reason they submitted in first place was because it said that thier e-mail address would not be displayed. If the officers agree to it i will put them up so they be contacted. But i want to ask everyone first so i dont invade anyones privacy.</p>
