- The Duke Below</font></b></font></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<font color="#000080" face="Footlight MT Light"><font size="4">Brell is allied with 
Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane, and an enemy of Veeshan's. Followers of the Duke of 
Below find true happiness in the caves, caverns and tunnels that permeate the 
belly of Norrath, but this is one of few points upon which all followers of 
Brell can agree. The Runny Eye Clan of goblins claim he is their father, much to 
the disgust of the dwarves of Kaladim who are certain that only the dwarves are 
the true children of Serilis. The vicious gnolls of Split Paw disagree entirely, 
for was it not Brell who sculpted them out of the sacred Clay of Cosgrove? 
Followers of Brell Serilis, in one form or another, can be found nearly anywhere 
you enter the Underfoot of Norrath.<br>
<br>
A complicated god to define, Brell Serilis's most prominent worshippers are, of 
course, the dwarves of Kaladim. However, if the rumors are indeed true, he is 
the creator of many races, both good and evil, orderly and discordant. 
Regardless of the truth of the matter, many evil races do indeed worship Brell. 
However, the belief that he created such creatures is not held among most races 
of Norrath. In fact, the fundaments of his worship among most societies posit 
that he is not evil, but a lover of creation in its purest form. He is worshiped 
as a non-evil deity, and is most often considered an orderly being. Modern 
worship of him follows that course. (N/ON - NG/OG - DN/DG)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--></font><strong><font size="4">Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane - God of 
Thieves</font></strong></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Footlight MT Light">
<font size="4">Followers of 
Bristlebane believe in having fun, at the expense of nearly all else. Bards, 
rogues, jesters, gamblers and gypsies are all typical followers. They are almost 
always very charming, clever, and witty, traits which all Bristlebane followers 
should strive to have. Mischief in all its forms is encouraged. Practical jokes 
are performed as if they are the highest of rituals. Very few of Bristlebane's 
followers are outright wicked in their desires but it is best to keep at least 
one eye on your purse if they are about. And never let one deal you a hand of 
King's Court.<br>
<br>
His followers accept only one tenet: Laws are something to be ridiculed. As his 
following among the dark elves might indicate, he is not necessarily only a god 
of fun and tricks. While each society will have a slightly different 
understanding of his nature, none of his followers can be orderly. (DN - 
DG/N/DE/NE/NG)<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--></font><strong><font size="4">Karana - God of Storms</font></strong></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Footlight MT Light">
<font size="4">Karana is 
allied with Tunare and Mithaniel Marr. Bertoxxulous is his enemy. Followers of 
Karana, the Rainkeeper, believe in the absolute power of storms. They worship 
the life-giving power of the rain and respect the destructive force of a 
sandstorm or hurricane. Typical followers of Karana are rural humanoids - 
farmers, ranchers, hunters, and the like. They will often offer strangers 
shelter from the elements. Many of Karana's followers live a nomadic lifestyle, 
travelling where the winds take them. They are humble, generous people who value 
strength and honesty and brook no disrespect of Karana or of his work for they 
know it is only through his wisdom and kindness that all of Norrath is not 
consumed in an eternal tempest.<br>
<br>
His essence is the torrential rain and fury of the storm, the discord of the 
storm and the goodness of the nourishing rain. His followers can't be evil or 
orderly. (N/DN/NG - DG)<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--></font><strong><font size="4">Erollisi Marr - Goddess of Love</font></strong></font></p>

<font size="4">This sister of 
Mithaniel and daughter of Tarew is allied with Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane, 
Mithaniel Marr, Rodcet Nife, Tunare and Quellious. Her enemies are Innoruuk, 
Cazic-Thule, Rallos Zek, and Bertoxxulous. Followers of Erollisi Marr, the Queen 
Of Love, cling to the belief that love conquers all. It should be pointed out 
that while love is a generally peaceful concept, Erollisi worshippers are not 
pacifists. They would like to live in a world where everyone loves everyone else 
and violence does not exist but they are not naove enough to think that Norrath 
is that world. They are passionately devoted to people, places and ideas and are 
more than willing to fight and die to preserve those things. The dream of every 
follower of Erollisi is to die in the selfless defense of someone or something 
they love. Many paladins hear the true calling of their hearts and follow 
Erollisi Marr.<br>
<br>
Her designs are in direct opposition to those of the god of Hate. It might 
indeed be true that her influence is as far reaching as Innoruuk's, and that 
even the darkest heart can be touched by Love. Her followers must be good.

<font color="#000080" face="Footlight MT Light" size="4">Mithaniel Marr, the Truthbringer, 
governs the Plane of Valor. Mithaniel is the ultimate paladin who wears a full 
suit of shining silver plate armor and wields a glowing longsword. Mithaniel 
Marr, who owes his existence to Tarew Marr, leader of the Triumvirate of Water, 
is allied with Erollisi Marr and Karana. He counts Innoruuk, Cazic-Thule, and 
Bertoxxulous among his enemies. He has a friendly rivalry with Solusek Ro.</font></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<font color="#000080" face="Footlight MT Light"><font size="4"><br>
Mithaniel Marr is a more dedicated force for goodness than his sister, Erollisi. 
Order and goodness are within his realm, and his sword arm defends both. His 
followers must be good and cannot be discordant. (OG - NG)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--></font><strong><font size="4">Prexus - God of the Oceans</font></strong><font size="4"><br>
Prexus, the Ocean Lord, is allied with Rodcet Nife and enemy to Bertoxxulous. 
Followers of Prexus believe that true power lies in the vast depths of Norrath's 
oceans. They believe that eons ago life first formed in the murky deep and that 
one day the oceans will rise again to consume those who are unworthy and embrace 
the faithful. The Oceanlord's servants tend to live and work near, on, or 
beneath, large bodies of water. They seek to spread the word of Prexus to all 
who will hear and defend the oceans and seas of Norrath against any who would 
cause them harm. Many sailors and fishermen are followers of Prexus.</font></font></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<font color="#000080" face="Footlight MT Light"><font size="4"><br>
Prexus is most often worshipped by those who sail the seas. For many, such 
worship is not just a desire to avoid his wrath while at sea. Prexus despises 
Bertoxxulous and calls Rodcet Nife ally. His followers can not be evil, but you 
will find as many who love the seas for their wild waves as for their calm on a 
clear night. (N/NG/OG/DG/DN/ON)<br>

<font color="#000080" face="Footlight MT Light" size="4">This peaceful child-goddess is 
allied with Rodcet Nife and Erollisi Marr, and an enemy to Rallos Zek and 
Innoruuk. Followers of Quellious the Tranquil seek peace. They are not strict 
pacifists, though, and will fight to defend themselves and their loved ones. The 
peace they seek is an inner one. They wish to know all there is to know about 
themselves and the world around them. They thirst for knowledge of their true 
selves and strive to help others attain enlightenment. It is through the sharing 
of this knowledge that they believe universal peace can be obtained. If every 
creature fully understood itself and its neighbors there would be no need for 
conflict and war. Followers of Quellious often follow a nomadic lifestyle, 
constantly seeking what there is to know and hoping to find themselves along the 
way.</font></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<font color="#000080" face="Footlight MT Light"><font size="4"><br>

<font color="#000080" face="Footlight MT Light" size="4">Rodcet Nife is allied with 
Karana, Quellious, Erollisi Marr and Prexus, and his only enemy is Bertoxxulous. 
Followers of the Prime Healer take a solemn oath to fight disease and death 
until one or the other finally claims them. They are very generous and humble, 
asking little more than that the recipients of their aid pass the kindness on to 
another. They are not content to deal with the effects of disease and death 
after they occur and vigorously seek to destroy the sources of these evils. 
Healers and mystics are typical followers but many noble rangers and paladins 
also have also taken the Nife Oath. They believe that, through faith in the 
Prime Healer, the wounded heart of the universe shall one day be mended and 
death's dark shadow will never be seen again.</font></p>

Solusek Ro, the Burning Prince. His father, Fennin Ro is the Tyrant of Fire who

Fire is, by its very nature, a discordant element. Often the followers of 
Solusek Ro worship him as a destructive force, a power of chaos and ruin. But 
not all of those who follow the Burning Prince see him that way, and some even 
see fire as a cleansing thing. His followers can't be orderly and tend not to be 
good. (DN/DE - N/NE - DG/NG)<br>

a council of six beings known as the Tribunal. The members of the Tribunal wear 
dark, hooded cloaks and masks and each carries a large warhammer. The plane

against the universe and by the golems the Tribunal has constructed to serve as 
guards. They are allied with no one, enemies with no one.<br>
<br>
Justice is by no means the same thing as the truth and valor of Mithaniel Marr. 
For followers of the Tribunal, order is the primary concern. Some followers of 
the Tribunal believe that justice cannot exist without a measure of concern for 
those it affects, but it is argued (often and at great length) by most followers 
that this is a tainting of justice, not a tempering of it. Followers are almost 
always orderly, and some are good. (ON- OG - N) <br>

Marr and Rodcet Nife, and enemies with Bertoxxulous, Tunare, the Mother of All, 
rules the Plane of Growth. Tunare appears as a very attractive older humanoid 
female wearing flowing robes and a crown of vines and leaves. Tunare is very 
protective of what she considers to be one of Her finest achievements, the good 
elf races of Norrath. As part of an agreement with Brell Serilis and Prexus and 
in response to the arrogance of Veeshan in claiming Norrath for her own, Tunare 
created the High Elves and the wood elves of Norrath.</font></p>

Cazic-Thule is allied with Rallos Zek and Innoruuk, and the enemy of Mithaniel

only by causing terror in others will they be spared his vengeful wrath. Fear 
rules their lives and through fear they rule the lives of others. Pain, misery, 
violence, torture, living sacrifice - these are the tools of a Cazicite. Many 
lizardman tribes are devout followers of Cazic-Thule, but his number of humanoid

Norrath in a nightmare of horror and pain.</font></p>
