Each of the races of Norrath has a society, and that is where they learn how to

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Barbarians</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
These isolationists tend toward neutrality and slightly toward goodness. They 
also tend to be orderly, primarily because the most commonly worshipped deity in 
Halas is the Tribunal. However, they are a wild people in a wild land, and not a 
few of them feel constrained by rules and follow the ways of discord. For the 
most part their society honors bravery and skill over trickery and greed, and 
desires of power or other evil thoughts are channeled and controlled by the 
overwhelming need to prove themselves to their people. (N/NG/ON - OG/DG/DN)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Dwarves</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
As sturdy of mind as they are of body, dwarves tend strongly toward order. Moved 
more by the smooth strength of steel and the beauty of precious stones, they are 
rarely motivated by the temptations of good or evil. However, through a long and 
occasionally strained relationship with the high and wood elves, and from 
continuous battle with the evil of the goblins, they will stray toward goodness 
rather than evil, if indeed they stray at all. The dwarven society prides itself 
on its honor, steadfastness in times of trouble, and its loyalty to its kin. (ON 
- N/NG)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Erudites</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Erudites are a people of two societies. The first was founded by Erud himself 
and still hold his strong beliefs at its core. Meticulous might be a good way to 
describe these folk. Their lives are ever bent toward discoveries of the mind. 
Their society reflects this. They are generally peaceful and orderly, and have 
become even more dedicated to the ideals of peace and order since their civil 
war gave a face to those among them who were dedicated to evil. <br>
<br>
The heretics of Paineel are just as orderly and meticulous as their estranged 
cousins in Erudin. Where the Erudites see order as a device that allows people 
the freedom to be good, the heretics see it as a tool that gives strength to 
their evil. They are no less organized in their daily lives than the people of 
Erudin are, but the goals of their society involve powers of dark necromancy and 
evil, rather than the enlightenment of good and kindness. <br>
<br>
It isn't unreasonable to envision these two societies as distillations of the 
two faces of order. Both have a tendency to be harsh in their adherence to 
order, as they have very real evidence of what can happen when one strays from 
the path of good/evil. Erudites (ON/OG/NG), Heretics (OE - NE)<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START-->Frogloks</font></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Footlight MT Light" color="#000080" size="4">
Frogloks have been around in Norrath for a long time, but have been confined to 
small groups and dark, secluded locations. Their city in the Swamp of No Hope is 
perhaps the best example of their isolation.&nbsp; With the victory over the 
trolls in Grobb the Frogloks gained a valuable stronghold where they are able to 
begin establishing themselves. The Frogloks are really only getting started and 
in time may hold the same influence over Norrath's fate as the fast evolving 
human race.&nbsp; They are generally a truthful, honest people and are proud 
followers of Mithaniel Marr. The other good or neutral aligned races will accept 
them, but are indifferent at best, the Frogloks have yet to prove themselves and 
many view them with suspicion.&nbsp; The evil aligned races, think of them just 
as an annoyance, and would never allow them inside or even near their cities and 
outposts. (OG - NG)</font></p>

<p align="center">
<font size="4" face="Footlight MT Light" color="#000080"><strong>Gnomes</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Gnomes run the gamut, being as likely to follow one path as any other. They are, 
however, unlikely to follow the strict life of order. They tend to be an 
unstructured people, and their amazing skill and detailed work seems to come 
from an inherent understanding of things, rather than any strict organizational 
skills. The rising influence of Bertoxxulous in Ak'Anon is considered by some 
among other races as evidence of the disorganization of the gnomes. There exists 
an odd truce between the worshippers of the gods of the gnomes, almost as if 
they are too busy or absentminded to take notice of the potential conflict that 
exists within the cavern walls of their clockwork city. (N/DN/NG/NE/DG/DE)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Half Elves</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Being born of humans and wood elves, and having a tendency to be independent of 
either society in any case, half elves can be of any alignment. They tend to 
fall into professions and forms of worship that suit their dispositions rather 
than conform to the needs of any society. It is possible to find half elves as 
members of almost any religion. In this fashion they take after their human 
parents. (ANY)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Halflings</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
These little folk tend to be kindly and warm, outgoing and inquisitive. While 
some are less friendly and some are more orderly than is most common, on the 
whole they are a pleasant people. While some will take up duties and keep at 
them tenaciously, this is stubbornness rather than orderliness. Unfettered and 
gregarious, these folk tend to chafe at rules they don't understand. Sure, it's 
wrong to hurt people, but everyone knows that, so why do you have to make a rule 
that says you can't? Despite what is often seen as rashness by some of the more 
stoic races of Norrath, halflings are never swayed to evil. (DG/NG/DN/N)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>High Elf</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
These children of Tunare embody her sense of order and goodness. They are a 
people of high values and great light. While some might be slightly less lawful 
or marginally less good than others, high elves are incapable of evil and chaos. 
This does not make them immune to errors in judgment, and it is not uncommon for 
them to appear haughty and even rude due to their strong sense of self-worth. As 
a society, they value actions over words, though they do not take words lightly. 
They value the good hearts of their cousins, the wood elves, but find their 
flightiness disconcerting. (OG - ON/NG)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Humans</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Diversity is their strength as well as their weakness. Humans can be of any 
alignment, and much like their half elven kin, they tend to take up professions 
that suit their desires. Those who feel a need for structure in their lives will 
often settle in the cities they have built on Antonica. But it is just as likely 
that you will meet a lawless human brigand on the road as a pleasant human 
cleric. With a human you can never know what to expect until you get to know the 
individual. (ANY)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START-->
<strong>Wood Elves</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
As the high elves are an orderly folk, the wood elves are wild. They tend to be 
chaotic and willful. They represent all that is untamed in the forest and in 
their beloved Mother of All. They are at heart a loving people, though they do 
stray, some becoming more wild than good. They are never evil, however, no 
matter the consternation they may cause their high elven cousins. Their society 
is built on respect more than on a sense of order. It is only reasonable to take 
the advice of one's betters, but that does not mean that one is constrained to 
obey that advice as if it were the only path. (DG/DN - N/NG)</font></p>

<strong>Dark Elves</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Driven primarily by the hatred that created them, dark elves are strongly evil. 
Their society is orderly (as order is the only thing that keeps their society 
stable), but in some the urge for evil is unrestrained by the rules of their 
society. There are discordant elements among the dark elves, primarily among 
those of the necromantic arts. Upward movement in the society of Neriak requires 
great cunning and self-control, however, and it is rare that those who do not 
posses orderly minds gain power in those circles. But dark elves are driven by 
all kinds of hatred- wild, flaring, dangerous hatred as well as cold, seething, 
dangerous hatred. (OE/NE - DE )</font></p>

<p align="center">
<font size="4" face="Footlight MT Light" color="#000080">
<strong>Iksar</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Even though their empire has fallen, the Iksar are still an orderly society. 
Evil to the core, there is very little variance from the path of order and evil 
among the Iksar of Cabilis. Those who are too disorderly are exiled into the 
wilderness of Kunark, where most find only death. Those who are too weak are 
often killed trying to prove their strength. Their single-minded acceptance of 
Fear has given their society its strength, and has given them the reputation as 
a terrible and dangerous people. (OE - NE)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Ogres</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Perhaps at the height of their society (if you believe such rumors), ogres were 
the epitome of order and the strength of evil. But these days they are just too 
stupid to have much need for laws. Somewhat mellower than their green-skinned 
neighbors, ogres tend to be just evil, as chaos and law require more work. Their 
society decays as their attentiveness to their old ways slowly fades. They can't 
be anything other than evil, but they can be motivated to be orderly or 
discordant, depending on how frequently they were dropped as children and on 
what part of their body they landed. (NE - DE/OE)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Trolls</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Trolls are more motivated to destruction than ogres. They are, in fact, a people 
bent on destruction and tend to be both discordant and evil. There is no reason 
to believe that trolls as a people ever had a society to speak of. They are 
ruled by the strongest among them and their society shifts with the latest 
battle, rarely fixating on a long-term goal. Their ferocity is their strength, 
serving them well enough in the place of rules. They are never other than evil, 
though some are less disorderly than the rest. (DE - NE)</font></p>
