<font size="5">Alignment</font></strong><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><font size="4">Neutral (N)</font></strong><font size="4"><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></font><br>
<br>
<font size="4">A person of neutral alignment can be very different from another person of the 
same alignment. For example, a druid might actively defend the center, holding a 
strong desire that neither good nor evil, order nor discord gain control in the 
world, for each of them is inherently unbalanced and unnatural. But a warrior of 
neutral alignment might be unconcerned about such things and simply wish that 
all those with such strong opinions keep them to themselves. In either case, the 
neutral character is not strongly allied with the ideas of order or discord, 
good or evil.<br>
</font>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><font size="4">Discordant Neutral (DN)</font></strong><font size="4"><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->
</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4">This is a character of unruly nature. Whether one is in opposition to the tenets 
of order or just desires to be unconstrained is immaterial. These folk tend to 
be unmindful of the rules of society, preferring to do what seems correct to 
them at the moment. This isn't a destructive kind of chaos such as would make a 
person evil, nor is it a gentle chiding of the rules intended to show where 
constraints hinder the ability for one to do what is good. Folks of this 
alignment are most often just unable to understand why others have the right to 
blanket their lives with rules when those rules can't be accurate for any of the 
specific situations they find themselves in.</font><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><font size="4">Orderly Neutral (ON)</font></strong><font size="4"><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></font><br>
<br>
<font size="4">Characters of this alignment believe foremost that sentient races must have 
rules to abide by, or they will become lost in uncivilized discord. This does 
not necessarily make them proselytizers of order. It is just as likely that one 
of this alignment would hold only themselves to such restrictions. Even so, 
their belief in the ordering of things is strong and they will often find it 
challenging to allow discord to work around them. One of this alignment will 
follow the rules of any society he finds himself in, and will tend to avoid the 
company of those that hold no rules or laws important.</font><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><font size="4">Neutral Good (NG)</font></strong><font size="4"><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></font><br>
<br>
<font size="4">Characters of this alignment believe that being good is more important than 
being orderly or chaotic. If rules make certain people happy, then they should 
have such rules. If rules cause others to be troubled, then they should be able 
to go where such rules do not apply. But neither rules nor a hatred of such 
rules should be an excuse for a person to be evil. Above all else, being good is 
what matters. This may only be a personal goal, or it might be something that 
the character desires for others. In any case, such a person will be unable to 
abide evil in any form. How they respond to such evil will vary from person to 
person, but they will never encourage evil and will never aid one that does 
evil.</font><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><font size="4">Neutral Evil (NE)</font></strong><font size="4"><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></font><br>
<font size="4">
<br>
Characters of this alignment are uninterested in order or discord. Such 
disinterest might stem from a lack of concern, or it might spring from disdain. 
For the most part, a person of this alignment strives primarily to achieve evil 
ends. Their goals might be personal, or they may wish to impress evil upon 
others. But evil is in them, and they cannot tolerate goodness. They will never 
aid a person of goodly demeanor, and depending on their personal desires will 
either hinder them or shun them.</font><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><font size="4">Orderly Evil (OE)</font></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<font size="4">Characters of this alignment form the heart of many evil societies. Their rules 
may be cruel, perhaps even frightening, but they are the devices that keep 
society in line. Evil to the core, these characters understand the power of 
organization and order, and they know that the way of discord is the way of 
self-destruction. If you want your dreams to come true, either as a person or as 
a society, then you must have the strength of order to build on. Structure is 
what makes evil terrible and mighty. Ambitious orderly evils desire the 
destruction of all that is good, and often have a plan for making that happen.</font><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><font size="4">Discordant Evil (DE)</font></strong><font size="4"><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->
</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4">Characters of this alignment eschew rules as restrictive to the purpose of evil. 
They believe that confusion and mayhem are the most effective tools available. 
They find those of order to be far too constrained by their own rules to be 
effective. Only those willing to throw off the shackles of order can ever truly 
be great. Seething chaos is the soil that nourishes true evil. Honor is for 
fools and paladins, both of which make fine mulch for the garden.</font><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><font size="4">Orderly Good (OG)</font></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<font size="4">Characters of this alignment believe that good is enhanced by order. True peace 
can only be achieved through the foundation of just rules and true goodness. 
Discord breeds evil, for those who are unwilling to follow rules most often do 
so because those rules enforce what is good. Certainly some rules are unjust and 
should be defied. But such rules are only created by those who are evil at 
heart. Societies, families, and individuals alike should be willing to do what 
is right, and to set what is right down as law. Some might be asked to make 
sacrifices for the good of others. Those unwilling to do so, those who say that 
rules are too constraining and are unwilling to abide by them because it 
discomforts them to do so, are selfish. Selfishness often leads to evil. Evil is 
intolerable.</font><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><font size="4">Discordant Good (DG)</font></strong><font size="4"><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->
</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4">Characters of this alignment believe that being good is an internal measure, not 
a societal one. Many of the rules that societies create have nothing to do with 
being good, but are designed to restrict people so that they can't be evil. A 
fine distinction, to be sure, but how can a rule, written onto a piece of paper 
or carved into stone by someone days, months or even years prior have any 
pertinence to an action taking place right now? Stealing is against the rules in 
many places, but it is not by its very nature evil. It is only the intent of the 
person doing the stealing that determines the goodness of the act. Stealing 
money from an evil man and using that money to feed those who have little is a 
good act, not an evil one. Rules hinder many acts that are indeed good.</font></font></p>
