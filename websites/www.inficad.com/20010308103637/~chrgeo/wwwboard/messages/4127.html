Lets see, the guys who usually give me hell, and are active on the Zone now. I would have to say that 2 names come to mind. _Free_Man_Nova_ and Da_Hulk, they are both very good at the game. Nova will pop in 7 or under conistantly, but both are really good at the backdoor. They also resource really well, Nova will have close to 100 peons going, and he often tribs food. I would guess that Nova wuld be slightly better than Hulk, but not 100% sure. <p><br>: let the voting begin<p>
