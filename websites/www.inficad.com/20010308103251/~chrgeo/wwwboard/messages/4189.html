<p>Like a half(?) year ago a guy called Crusher_c00k, Smashing_c00k, Smashing_DoG, IamGod__, Iamc00k, Smashing_Joka, IamPumpkin, _Sn0w_j0ker_, IamGod_, _Sn0w_c00k__, and Smashing_DoG (guess he had more names but theese r the names i remember) left AoE for RoR. He tryed 2 make me a RoR player 2 but as many of u guys know, im an AoE player only. So i told him i woulda get on as much as i could with my old names so we could maybe get some games together. But as u guys know, things change and i guess both me n him changed names. He told me b4 he quit AoE he woulda play AoK when it came out.<br>So my question, Any1 know what names he uses, and if he play AoK or AoE?<p>NT_Star<br>
