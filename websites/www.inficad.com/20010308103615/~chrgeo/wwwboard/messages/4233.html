i had a 33.6 and i connected at 33.6 everytime, i move to the country (6 miles outta my town) and it just sucked, i was getting 26.4 so i used my old comp with 28.8 and got 28.8...ill see if a technition can come and look at the jack...i do have my line running from my comp to the jack directly, so thats not the problem, my friend in town has a 56k just like mine PCI 56k Voice modem, and he gets 49.2 and sometimes 52.6, so it might be that i live just that much farther away from my isp so its slower...weird thing is, THIS morning at 6:30 before i left for school i decided id try again and i got 56bps, aint that some shit, so i figure its fixed, i get home and im at 26.4 again...bulllshit! i never told u guys that i was getting cable at the end of this month so ill just suck it up for the next week or so =), i just wanted to get my mp3s back n shit from vics ftp faster, but i guess this will be fine untill my cable =)<p>-wezt<br>
