: I was wondering why nobody play no reveal anymore.  Back maybe 2 years ago good games were played with no reveal.  No painting or phantom walling and crap like that would ever happen.<p>  As you say, there is no painting or phantom walling in noreveal. Plus noone can teleport units to the other side of a map in the beginning of a game. <p><br>  If you lost you could not say that this happened or this happened.  I think that ppl should start playin no reveal,  less chance of newbies screweing up the game and crap.  Reveal is kinda getting easy cause u can just look around the map and u can tell were the enemy is... what ya think?<p>  Happy I learned aoe and ror on noreveal, cause now reveal is so much easier....I think the best DM games are noreveal, stone start :) i think I'm the only one who loves those settings...priests an' boats and walls OH MY!! :)oh well, good games :)<p>
