<p>This may sound wierd.. but which is better.. Mithiril Two Handed Sword... or...<p>Soulfire?<p>I apparently have a few high lvl friends in a few high lvl guilds that seem to be willing to consider assisting me with the quest.. (but my lips are gonna be sore from the kissing oof the butts I am quite sure)<p>Anyways, I was comparing the stats. M2h is 21/40 Haste, looks like your basic Fine Steel 2hander. <p>SoulFire is 23/45 5 charges of Complete Heal (?), 7 STR & WIS, looks like well.. a burning sword. A rather big, burning sword at that. =)<p>Anyways, it *might* be possible to trade a M2h for a FBSS, which would give me the SF's greater damage without the bigger delay, BUT, I'd also lose my 8 AC from my TLA..<p>Any advice? Other than to wear protection for my lips? =)
