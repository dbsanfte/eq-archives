Surely Heaven would have to be in the top ten. When I started playing DM (which would have been I suppose around 1.5/2 years after AOE came out since I played rm for the first year) Heaven were pretty much the only expert clan around and they seemed to be way better than anyone else. This was ages ago and I may be misremembering, but for a certain period they certainly were by far the best.<br>beatnik_man<p>
