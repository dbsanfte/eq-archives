I saw a red dot along the edge of the map behind my opponents. It was an empty TC. Just a blank foundation. He never had peons come out of it but of course it was destroyed when the opponent saw it.

I check the back of my base and see a blank TC with two of his peons standing beside it. Now this is a stranger situation. He had ran peons behind a partner of mine but these were seperated from them. The fact that they stood behind a blank tc, right beside it in two seperate locations seems fishy. You just dont send two peons beside a blank tc of yours and line them up so they are right beside the tc.
