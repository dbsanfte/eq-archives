<p>_free_man_Rock, Cyber_Bud, and myself, against Chill_me, pA_die, and hell if I can think of the other name. We played till al gold was gone, except for last pile between Rock and the other guy I cant think of the name. We battld for that pile for about 30 minutes, and found that no body could get it. It was a killer game, I kept trying backdoors, and had a little success, just wish I hadnt of run out of stone, so I could have thrown up more towers. Anyway, the game lasted well over an hour, and it was a blast, any others been getting any gg's like this lately?
