He's wielding Truesight Hammer (Innoruuk Cleric Hammer Drop) with a paw, has full cleric quest armor (just wears some but has full set)...Etheral Mist Boots, Lots of awesome shit...i havent seen if hes gotten anymore etheral yet but his guild clears hate alot along with fear and sky...They got the 2nd FA overall right before the players on Fennin go theirs...Druzzil is a bad ass server cuz noone is really camping lower lvls zones anymore like Cazic-Thule! (Reg around 90 there on fennin, only about 14 there on druzzil!)  I'm lvling pretty slow (not near his lev) but ive got 2 alts i like playing around with kinda...15 rogue and 8 enchanter (i started JC on hippos and its at like 86 now) I've just got like reg druid...as u see in pic<p>Hippos Pottamus<br>STILL 35 Druid<br>Druzzil Ro<br>(Haven't felt like lvling since i died 7 times in Phinigel Autropos's arms :)<br>
