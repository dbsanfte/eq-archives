: don't know how best to describe it - there are different games (zones) within the game 

: ctf - capture the flag, teams go against eachother - you pick character (like eq) - medic, engineer, infantry, heavy artillery, etc ... your &quot;character&quot; gains points with kills - you have multiple weapons, armor can buy more after getting points for winning and killing enemy 

: gravball - this is what i be playing though i suck at it so far - need to get good keyboard config - in this deal you play in a large arena and motor around on scooters - you try to get a &quot;grav&quot; ball into the opposing goal - you have weapons and can pick up goodies - you can punt the ball or pass to teammate as when you are carrying it you can't shoot ...

: arena - rpg mode again where you have character and earn points killing other players - you make points for that to buy better weapons, armor, vehicles, etc ... 

: what's really cool about this game is that (1) all the stats on all the players are always available, (2) you can &quot;spectate&quot; and just watch someone else play, (3) it is a real cool blend of action/rpg elements, (4) team strategies for gravball, ctf, (5) after release, anybody running a server can create their own zone setups (can create your own eq if desired ...) and customize the game ...

: bad deal is that there isn't much documentation on how the game works but there's enough to get you started - check it out - it is 12M download but no credit card is required and it is free ...
