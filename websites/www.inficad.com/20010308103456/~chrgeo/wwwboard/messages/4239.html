: I was wondering why nobody play no reveal anymore.  Back maybe 2 years ago good games were played with no reveal.  No painting or phantom walling and crap like that would ever happen.   If you lost you could not say that this happened or this happened.  I think that ppl should start playin no reveal,  less chance of newbies screweing up the game and crap.  Reveal is kinda getting easy cause u can just look around the map and u can tell were the enemy is... what ya think?<p>
