: lets look at SmokeS

: Skill- always tops, 3 of us could go toe to toe with 3 of ANYBODY.. end of story

: ability to last- well, most of us play other games now, and we only had 6 people max at all times.. so werent many of us anyways, but we played the entire AoE Dm out..

: leadership- clan started and run by three brothers, leadership was never an issue

: strength- see skill

: compatability- lets see, we had at max 8 people active at one time.. and 3 of them were brothers.. compatability.. hmmm =)

: SmokeS was a great clan to be in... lots of fun, good peeps.
