Me? I sure as hell aint no young grasshopper. Been playing for 3 years, over 1 and a half as MDK_deth, been with S_M for a few months now. I was with a few other old clans that have died, like Shadow, and Warlord from about 2 and a half years ago. I have never been what I would call great, but can put up a fight with just about all. Nova right now in this time frame is a very strong Cho, play against him sometime, he will either run you over, backdoor you to death, or just pure and simply give you one hell of a game. Anyway, I have played against you a few times, and also with you, thought you knew who I was.<p><br>: and who are you. you sound like a "young grasshopper"<p>: jeb<p>
