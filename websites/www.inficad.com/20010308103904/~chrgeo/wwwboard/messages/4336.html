If I was to come up with a list.. ya you would know the names of the clan but I would truly have to use a slide ruler and flip coins to list the names .. There are a lot of past clans that did vary well and may be they should have a hall of names. I guess all that truly matters is, in this little part of cyber space there recalled from time to time. That I think is all that needs to be done.  Take Jebs Clan History... Is it History or there exanimate?<p><br>There is only one clan that ranks with me that is CTW  …   They have taken AOK and toured it in to a craft an passed that craft out in the CTW in good old AOK fashion.<p>We did AOE and we where damm good<br>We did RoR and we rocked the zone<br>Where in AOK and we can’t be stopped.<br>
