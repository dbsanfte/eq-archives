<p>I gotta make this quick cause i got work tomorrow. I am dissappointed in a few of u guys. It seems like 1 out of every 5 games I watch a teamate teleport or I get teleported on.<p>NT_Buff today. I saw a red dot along the edge of the map behind my opponents. It was an empty TC. Just a blank foundation. He never had peons come out of it but of course it was destroyed when the opponent saw it. When I confronted him he said "i had ran peons back there but they got killed and I forgot about it." Technically he never made any peons out of it but.... you go and figure.<p>Tian_X*#$*# something from DWW clan. I check the back of my base and see a blank TC with two of his peons standing beside it. Now this is a stranger situation. He had ran peons behind a partner of mine but these were seperated from them. The fact that they stood behind a blank tc, right beside it in two seperate locations seems fishy. You just dont send two peons beside a blank tc of yours and line them up so they are right beside the tc. Would be hard to do and pointless.<p>Some guy in DWW hacking the Hot clans passwords and they think it is funny over there. I dont get the joke and dont get why it is acceptable.<p>Anyways this is my pisser list for the weekend.<p>Jeb
