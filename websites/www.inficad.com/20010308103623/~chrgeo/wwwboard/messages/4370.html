: i only started to occasionally read these posts lately and the top 10 clans and whatnot keep popping up. in my mind, making the top 10 is nearly impossible...u try to mix a million factors into one including:

: skill
: ability to last
: leadership
: strength
: compatiblility with fellow members (meanin not talkin trash at them)

: for example, let's take some clan let's say owerS.  
: skillwise-extremely good...on top 10 list it'd be there
: ability to last- didn't last very long
: leadership- not very good
: strength- pretty strong when it was alive
: compatibility- give me a break literally

: now u can complain against all that shit, but i think i speak on behalf of most expert gamers for the most part. (yes i am an expert, just not really an awesome one =) that can go

: then clans like nt and dww can't really be judged because they are new and who knows what happens to them in the long term.
: a clan like sd who many believe are the number 1 clan ever, really have been strong for some time but have little comebacks about once a month or so. i only have been playing aoe since dec 98 or so, so i haven't really seen many of these clans in their prime.

: now i mean this seriously, take a clan let's say WKA.  personally, i don't like them and never had.  but, despite all the boos they got from everybody, they stayed a strong close-knit kinda clan with not too bad leadership, even though skillwise they sucked.  and it didn't die off, basically the leader killed off the clan and tried to make the clan into some webpage business or shit.  you can say the same for bc- they never had good players...with a few exceptions, but julius has been able to keep it alive.

: i think out of those clans that are on there that deserve top 10 credit no doubt are SmokeS and Mars...they have always stayed strong...i guess u can say the same for gt and sd even though their clans died off awhile back.

: burning is also another good clan that worked hard to stay alive.

: few more examples then i'll stop typing...

: hot clan has done extremely well in my opinion because they have a good circle going.  i mean that when they lose members, they pick up more..and since pinky's been a good leader apparently, it has the thing working.
: no one considered phusion either, yes i know they aren't the best skillwise (even though i thought i was good :P) but, when owerS started up, i guess phusion began around the same time..it is now dead since someone hacked our site and our chick leader hasn't been online for like 3 weeks. ok so phuse lasted like 6-7 months....much longer than many super expert clans.

: but there really is no top ten overall...it is almost impossible to tell who is really the best.  hehe, maybe it really is that newbie clan that has lasted for 3 years that's still going strong.

: i don't care how much u hate me, because a.  you have a good shot at whipping me 1v1 and b. this is a game, not a life to  me
