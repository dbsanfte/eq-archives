There is ONE 1.0c NO-CD crack that allows the big daddies and photon men in aoe and ror.  The crack maker is proud -enough to tell cheaters that download his no-CD crack that he made it so, it was made by Nightmare on his hell site. (his site is missing now LOL) the crack is no longer available for dl. Maybe the nocd users will go away or die.<p>There is NO trainer available that wont sync-out the game for resourses. The major trainer makers said they won't release multiplayer resourses trainers(i believe them so far)<p> In rated you have 2 mins to leave the game for it not to count and hurt your rating. <br>    AT ONE MIN CHECK VILLIE NUMBERS IF HE STILL HAS 3 VILLAGERS GET THE HELL OUT OF THE RATED GAME.<p>
