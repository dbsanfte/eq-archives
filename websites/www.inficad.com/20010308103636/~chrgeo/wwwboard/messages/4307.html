Camped the ancient croc in uppper for a long time, got gator legs and arms... im gonna try and save up for a cowl, and going to camp the oracle at 39.  Exp is kinda slow in guk, but it was hell level 35 anyway.  Might try soloing at 39 for awhile, dont really know of any good spots I can now.  44-50 is a snitch for us mages, with SoS and pet we are killing machines.  Coolest thing Ive gotten so far on the mage is probably an exe axe that I got from camping the ghoul executioner in lower guk, coolest thing I've gotten ever... probably my jeweled skull.  Hopefully one of these days Ill get in the sage group and get that cowl, because I want to get batskull earrings as well.  Int is at 190 with jeweled skull in hand, 187 with my focus items.  And let me tell you how lucky you clerics/shaman/druids are for not having to do all these damn quests, theyre a real pain, and expensive.  Well, thats my EQ report for the day, adios from E'ci.<p>P.S. Is everyone buying the expansion?
