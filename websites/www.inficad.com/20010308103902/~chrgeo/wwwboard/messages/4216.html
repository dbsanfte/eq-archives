still it's not worth to waste time with losers who deny what they do<p>: Anyways I uploaded the screenshot. In my original post I said no peons ever came out of your TC but it sat there for a good 5-7 minutes at least... sorry cant confirm the times I never took multiple screenshots. But I dont see how you could forget about that one, not like you were grey and it was hard to see your color on the minimap, was like a fat women, hard to miss.<p>: I have one more shot at 5:44 time and it was there before that and after the image I took... it was gone when blue saw it and built a tower to kill it.<p>: the image is at...  <p>: www.arches.uga.edu/~seek/rak.gif<p>: But ur right you didnt teleport.... not sure if that is because it didnt work or u dont do that sort of thing. Personally I almost always give ppl the benifit of the doubt. Unless I see it I dont say anything, I might ask them how they got there but I do that more to figure out how I screwed up. But when I see the shit I usually am pretty suprised.<p>: Anyways I just wanted to clear up any misconception that I just throw accusations around. If anyone ever does question something I say and if it happened recently I probably do have a screen shot for it.<p>: Latah,<br>: Jeb<p>: <br>: Raker wrote:<br>: "You know damn well i dont teleport,ive been known to run vils and just because my vils got killed doesnt mean shit,i simply forgot to delete them,and remember i dropped that game too?
