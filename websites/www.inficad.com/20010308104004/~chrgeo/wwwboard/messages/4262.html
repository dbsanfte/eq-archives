<p>OK what is with the zone recently. For the last 3 days it has been extremly difficult to get into the Dm room.  And now it has gotten to the point where i cant get in. period. Something must be up but seeing as i am not completly computer literate i thought maybe some of the pc wizards here could answer it. what would cause a 3 day shut down of the most popular rooms on aoe?  Thanks for your time.
