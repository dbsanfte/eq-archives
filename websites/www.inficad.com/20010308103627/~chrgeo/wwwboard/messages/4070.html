An 80th level player killing a 5th level, for instance, would cause the 80th level to gain almost nothing, and the 5th leveler to lose even less. Will this mean that it won't happen? Of course not!

: &lt;b&gt;For those of us who don't know exactly what Shadowbane is, could you please give us a brief summary of what it's all about?&lt;/b&gt;

: Shadowbane is a massively multi-user RPG that we're producing for the PC and Macintosh platforms, which we hope to release in late summer of 2000.
: Unlike the other titles in this area, Shadowbane has more of a &quot;dark fantasy&quot; feel -- we're trying to build a game that has a lot more detail, storyline, and atmosphere than anyone has attempted in a 3d virtual world before.

: It almost seems like with some of the other games that player interactions are almost tossed in as afterthoughts. What we're working toward is a system that makes those interactions the primary focus of the game.

: &lt;b&gt;Shadowbane seems to be about power, who has some and who has more. From playing games such as Everquest and Ultima Online, it always seemed that for most gamers the emphasis was on gaining levels quickly and becoming more powerful even though the mantra for the game as a whole differed. With Shadowbane, you're essentially taping into the base of what current online RPG games try to deny. First, what drove you towards what others before you attempted to quell (i.e. direct competition, PvP) in some form or fashion? Second, can you explain some of the methods of acquiring power, such as Holy Intervention, constructs and declaring an empire? Third, will there be any possibility of attaining true power without succumbing to a darker mistress?
: You're exactly on target here. If our players were merely interested in meeting and making new friends, they wouldn't be playing our game- after all, there are plenty of chat rooms who offer environments much more conducive to that sort of behavior.&lt;/b&gt;

: People who log into an immersive, competitive World like ours are looking for more than a casual talk session. Shadowbane taps into the more 'primal' force beneath RPG's - not that the game won't foster role-playing, mind you. We just give them the Power to back up the persona they are building.

: Lets also talk for a moment, then, about the roads to Power. Another of the failings of some of the Game's we've seen is that they treat Power as if it was a flip of the coin, rather than the multi-faceted jewel that it is. We decided that to make a deeper, more (and I hesitate to use this word here) 'realistic' World, we would have to present Power in a number of different forms.
