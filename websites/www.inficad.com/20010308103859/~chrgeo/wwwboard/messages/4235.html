game length: o about 1hr30min Teams: 2 Lego and DnC vS donald_crap and __SerVanT__ and sum guy that was hella good, me and crap had a stalemate at the shallows and i tried a backdoor, i got a vill back there and stole some of his gold, while building some rax, eventually he found me out, after i stole his gold, he eventually killed my backdoor guys, i had stolen his gold though, then we kept playing but he had shit loads of stone and i wasted a bunch of gold trying to break thru his towas, then __SerVanT__ killed Lego_star and then __SerVanT__  got Lego_patato and my farms and we lost =) good game  tho =)
