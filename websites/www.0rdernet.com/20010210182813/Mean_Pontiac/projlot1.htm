    <td width="77%" height="161" valign="top" style="text-align: left; vertical-align: text-top">This 74' Trans Am belongs to Crawford
    Smith. The car is painted Buccaneer Red and comes with a black custom cloth interior and a
    velour headliner. It also comes with the highly desirable 4-speed M-20 transmission. Even
    though the car was entirely original when bought and had only some rust around the rear
    window and lower rear quarter panles, Crawford decided to do some restoration work on it.<br>
    <br>
    Here's an update from Crawford on the status of this restoration:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>I've had the chassis sent to a sandblasting shop where
    the complete underside, wheel wells, and trunk were sandblasted clean, and primed. I also
    took the hood, trunk lid, and front fenders to a stripping place where they will be dipped
    in a big tank and stripped, then dipped in a vat of stuff to neutralize any&nbsp; rust,
    then primed.&nbsp; I've ordered all new front and rear suspension parts, and will remove
    the front subframe, have it sandblasted and re-primed and painted chassis black before
    re-installing with the new parts. The body shop advised me that the rear quarters were a
    little more beat than we had thought, so a nice set of rust free California rear quarters
    were located and will be installed to complete the like new rear end. It was next to
    impossible to locate a set of 1974 Trans Am rear quarters. Seems like 1974 was a &quot;one
    of a kind&quot; year for the rear end. The car will pretty much sit out the winter at
    Martin Pontiac in Sheboygan, WI for the full restoration. I just dripped off a big truck
    load of new GM parts that they need to prime and paint, such as the new front valance,
    wheel well spoilers. New<br>
    weatherstripping and window felts are to compete the package also. I have also ordered a
    set of Corbeau front sport seats as the GM horsecollar seats just don't do it. For right
    now, I don't plan on having the T/A on the road in 1998, as there are a million and one
    fine details to attend to when putting it back together. I do plan on taking this T/A to
    many car shows and seeing how it does compared to the rest of the pack. Look for this T/A
    to be on the road in 1999.</strong> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <td width="77%" height="161" valign="top" style="text-align: left; vertical-align: text-top">This 79' Special Edition Trans Am is
    owned by Joseph Galate. Joe purchased the car in March of 1996 and recently decided to
    have some work done it. The plan is to have the engine compartment detailed and a ground
    up restoration performed on the suspension, brakes and fuel system. Following that will be
    a rebuild of the engine and a restoration of the interior. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; McBee CARS in Columbia, Missouri was chosen to handle the engine
    bay and undercarriage detailing. A complete engine bay restoration was performed along
    with the total replacement of the front and rear suspension. Polyurethane bushings and
    Koni shocks were installed during the process. All brake and fuel lines were also replaced
    with new stainless steel lines. <br>
    More info on the restoration of this car will be added as it becomes available. Until then
    you can go by Joseph's homepage entitled <a href="http://www.missouri.edu/~nursgala/index.htm">Jospeh Galate's 1979 S.E. Trans Am</a>

    <td width="77%" height="161" valign="top" style="text-align: left; vertical-align: text-top">This Firebird belongs to Tom Griffith.
    Tom bought it for only $200. Tom is a member of The Trans Am Tribe and the vice-president
    of the club discovered it in San Francisco. It had been sitting behind a warehouse and was
    nearly covered with weeds. Tom had been looking for one to replace his previous 70' that
    had a bent frame. After the car was bought Tom paid $50 and had it towed home. The
    interior was completely trashed and both doors were missing. The car was without an engine
    although it did still have the transmission which was held up by a string!! The car had
    also had some aftermarket &quot;pop-up&quot; style roof hatches installed at sometime in
    its life. Tom cleaned out the car and washed it and began to put it back together. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A set of classic Cragar five spoke
    rims were installed outfitted with a huge set of 15xN50 Mickey Thompson soft compund tires
    on the rear and G60s on the front. Next a black custom cloth interior was installed that
    had been removed from a 79' Trans Am. Also installed on the inside was a tilt steering
    wheel and a Kenwood stereo with twin equalizers powering a set of 10&quot; sub-woofers and
    a pair of 6x9s. The sun dried dash and center console were dyed black to match the rest of
    the interior.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving to the engine compartment
    Tom sanded it and repainted it and then installed a healthy 70' Pontiac 350 that had been
    in his last bird. The engine was painted black and a cool set of black Mickey Thompson
    valve covers were installed along with a pair of Hooker headers. The transmission is a
    turbo 400 and was kept. Lastly, in order to fit a Trans Am shaker scoop on the engine, Tom
    had to cut out a regular hood. A fiberglass L88 style scoop is in the plans for future
    modifications for the car. Photos of the finished product will be posted here when I get
    em'.&nbsp;</td>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;We have had the car for about 4 years. After we
bought the car from my wife's sister i drove it back and forth to work for the last 2
years. Its been in my wife's family since 1980. That we know of theirs not much
&quot;special&quot; about the car but it has more sentimental value than anything, plus,
it's a sharp car. we just took it off the road to get new floor boards, carpet and
interior work done . we're also giving her a slick paint job. The olds 403 runs pretty
strong but were planing on a rebuild when the wallet fills back up again.&quot;<br>
<br>
</strong>I think theres a lot more &quot;average&quot; (for lack of a better word)
Firebirds out there than &quot;special&quot; ones. I'd like to thank Sean and others like
him that invest time and money to keep these cars on the road. In my book any Firebird is
worth rebuilding.<strong> </strong></p>

This 1968 Firebird project is owned by Hutch from Nokesville, Virginia. It currently does
not have an engine or transmission yet! I'll bet he's just dying to bolt in something big
between those fenders! Stay tuned to find out what it'll be.....(more info to come)</p>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;<font size="3">The car was originally a 400-4bbl

    not much else. It even had the plain-jane 14x7 wheels with &quot;dog-dish&quot; hubcaps. I
    hesitate to call what I'm doing to it a &quot;restoration&quot; as I'm veering
    significantly away from stock. The goal is to maintain a stock look, while really beefing
    up the performance. To that end I've had a set of 15x8 and 15x10 steel wheels fabricated
    that will retain those original hubcaps &amp; trim rings. I upgraded to '79 TA swaybars
    (1-1/4&quot; in front and 3/4&quot; rear), '79 TA WS6 rear leaf springs, Vette Brakes
    &amp; Products (VB&amp;P) two-piece aluminum hubbed brake rotors (clamped by Performance
    Friction Carbon Metallic brake pads), VB&amp;P upper tubular control arms, boxed stock
    lower control arms, HO Racing front springs cut 3/4 coil, PST &quot;Polygraphite&quot;
    control arm, swaybar, and body mount bushings, Global West tubular subframe connectors,
    and Global West &quot;Del-a-Lum&quot; rear leaf spring shackles &amp; front spring eye
    mount bushings. Finishing off the suspension are Koni adjustable gas shocks at all four
    corners.&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The engine &amp; drivetrain consist of the original '72 400 block
    crank and rods, fully blueprinted and balanced, bored +.030, and 0&quot; decked. The rods
    were weight matched, beam polished, shot-peened and honed for oversized lightweight (shh!
    Don't tell anyone) Big Block Chevy wristpins that were fitted into simlarly honed
    oversized, dished TRW forged pistons. The cam is a Comp Cams custom grind (232 @ .050
    duration, .521 lift with 1.65 Harland Sharp roller rockers, 112 degree lobe separation,
    intake centerline at 111 degrees. Should produce performance similar to a RA-IV cam and
    I'm also using Rhoads lifters so that I can run the A/C). I'll probably change this cam to
    something a bit more mild in the next year depending on how it runs. All engine bolts are
    ARP, including the polished stainless ones on the outside of it. I also ground all the
    identifying markings off the Edelbrock intake manifold and painted it engine color. I
    purchased a Ram Air aircleaner and all the necessary pieces to convert the car to the
    factory Ram Air system. I'm also using a set of '70 #13 heads that I ported myself. They
    breath into HO Racing Tri-Y headers and a Flowmaster 2.5&quot; mandrel bent exhaust system
    modified for a Dr. Gas X-style crossover. The carb is an 800 cfm Q-jet modified for my
    engine and fuel delivery will be handled by the stock 3/8&quot; fuel lines and a Mallory
    Comp 140 electric pump, filter, &amp; pressure regulator. The pressure regulator will be
    mounted where the stock fuel pump would go, allowing me to use the stainless-steel
    replacement stock carb inlet line and keep the &quot;stock at first glance&quot; theme
    going. Even the alternator is the original unit, but rebuilt with a 105 amp kit. Ignition
    will be handled by a custom-curved HEI and a Crane HI-6 capacitive discharge box with rev
    limiter. <br>
    The tranny is a TH400 out of a station wagon with the extra big clutch pack (5 composite,
    5 steel discs). It's been converted to full manual operation (but retaining stock console
    shifter), is driven by a Coan 2800-3000 stall converter, and is cooled by a Derale tranny
    cooler with built in 500 CFM electric thermostatically controlled fan. The rearend
    consists of the original 10-bolt housing with new axles, an Eaton clutch-type posi unit
    and 3.23 (for now) GM gears. I may switch to 3.73 after I've gotten some long road trips I
    want to take out of the way - it all depends on the performance I can wring out of it with
    the 3.23s. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The interior will be restored to stock, with the addition of a
    Kenwood 400 watt stereo system including 6-disc trunk mounted CD changer. No holes will be
    cut in the stock interior for speakers or anything else and it will all (except the tape
    deck and EQ) be hidden from view (unless you look in the trunk). I've covered all of the
    interior sheetmetal surfaces with Dynamat for extra sound-deadening and will install a
    baffle-board directly behind the rear seat to mount a 10-inch free-air subwoofer and also
    fully isolate the passenger compartment from the trunk. I'm also adding a factory 8K tach
    to the rally guage instrument cluster. &quot;</font></strong></td>

    Firebird Esprit going through a very thorough restoration. Peter Abraham is the owner who
    is leading the venture and heres what Peter had to say about it:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><font size="3">&quot;Neat Page! Thanks for the
    information, as well as the inspiration. My name is Peter Abraham, and I live in Tucson,
    Arizona. I own a 1973 Pontiac Firebird Esprit. The car was originally equipped with a 350
    CID Pontiac Engine, TH350 Trans, and 10 Bolt Rear. I bought the car when I was 16 back in
    1985. I drove the car as my daily driver throughout High School, and College. I am finally
    in a position in life to build the car how I always wanted. I am in the thick of turning
    the car into a killer street machine. The hardware specs are as follows. <br>
    <br>
    1) 1970 400 CID RAM AIR III Engine #12 Heads. <br>
    2) TH350 AutoMatic (My Dad is building this for me...He is a Hot Rodder from &quot;Way
    Back&quot;)<br>
    3) 4.10 10 Bolt Posi.<br>
    4) Hughs 10 Inch Converter.<br>
    <br>
    My goal is took construct a Solid 12 Second Street Car. The pictures were taken when I had
    the Car Stripped with Plastic Media. I am currently finishing my bodywork....Next I will
    remove the Sub-Frame for powder coating, and rebuilding....This Car is totally
    dissasembled! If it could come off it has! My goal is to Finish the car by the year
    2000!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Thanks for the Fun.<br>
    Peter Abraham</font></strong><font SIZE="2"><br>
    </font><br>
    Thank you for sharing Peter and good luck! I am anxious to see the end result!! Look here
    for future updates on this car's progress!!</td>
