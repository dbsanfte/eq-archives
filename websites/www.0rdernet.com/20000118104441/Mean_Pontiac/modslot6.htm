The second kit in the <strong>WAR</strong> series. This one is an MPC kit and is 1/25 in
scale. It appears to have some outlandish customizing options. This was a sign of the
times for the late 70s. Most people were heavy into customizations. The small print below
the WAR Eagle title says &quot;Firebird Cafe racer&quot; as if this is to explain the
customized car. No further information is available at this time...</p>

The third kit in the WAR series differs from the first too in that it is a 1979 Trans Am.
This too is an MPC kit and is a 1/25 scale kit. The car can be built either customized or
stock. This may be a fairly rare and valuable kit among model car collectors. The contents
are molded in red. The T-Tops are not removable but, as with many kits, their is a large
enough depression to cut them ou if you want them off the car. If you do choose to cut out
the Tops you get another clean set on a tree presumably to replace the ones that will
inevitably get damaged when they are cut out. This is the first kit I have seen to offer
two sets of Tops. Like many real '79s of the day this kit can be highly customized. A roll
cage is included for installation as well as chrome side pipes and a chrome CB antenna for
the trunk.The kit comes with a lot of chrome. Besides the already mentioned pieces you get
two sets of wheels, a set of snowflakes and a set of custom rims. Several engine pieces
are chrome including the oil pan, which is an unusual addition as well as chrome exhaust
pipes and a chrome shifter. Decals included are mainly what you see on the box. You get a
yellow and black hood bird, 4 &quot;Trans Am&quot; decals, two sail panel birds, the
multi-hued racing stripes seen on the box, two &quot;Warlord&quot; decals, two
&quot;400&quot; decals and some Pennzoil and Accel decals. An interesting note is that the
phrase at the bottom of the box reads,&quot; Photo of Painted Prototype Model&quot;. Also
the &quot;stock&quot; version car depicted on the box is painted yellow which would
seemingly make it very hard to see the hood bird. The box is dated 1978.<br>

    <td width="77%" height="161" valign="top" style="text-align: left; vertical-align: text-top">This kit is made by Revell. Its molded
    in black and is modeled after a 79' - 81' Trans Am. It features IMSA style fenders, a 455
    engine, real rubber tires, snap-in tinted windows and a full set of decals. The decals are
    all gold to match the black and feature a large hood bird, two sail panel birds, two 6.6L
    emblems for the shaker and three &quot;Firebird&quot; decals. The rims provided with this
    kit look like the aftermarket set depicted on the box. An unusual feature of this model is
    that the T-Tops have already been &quot;cut-out&quot; and a set of clear plastic
    &quot;T-Tops&quot; are provided along with the other windows. The body is based on the 79'
    Trans Ams customized by George Barris for John Travolta and the Fabian movie &quot;Disco
    Fever&quot;, the only difference being the rear spoiler. The Barris cars received
    whale-tail spoilers. The information on the side of the box quotes 1/4 mile times in the
    14 second range for the 455. The kit is dated 1980.<br>

This is a 1/25 scale Revell model of a 79' - 81' Trans Am. It is highly customized and was
part of a special series of models called &quot;Street Machines.&nbsp; The body is
somewhat based on the 79' Trans Ams customized by George Barris for John Travolta and the
Fabian movie &quot;Disco Fever&quot;. The kit is dated 1985 and is molded in charcoal
gray. Kit includes two sets of tires, stock and big and littles (bigs being slicks). There
is only one set of wheels with them being a crosslace type wheel similar to the mid 80's
GTA. The T-tops&nbsp; have already been cut from the roof at the factory and includes<br>
a set of very lightly tinted glass for the openings as well as for the front and rear
windows. As for the body, it is molded as shown on the box cover with a wild set of flares
and the large open hood scoop. Actually the body looks better than the box cover shows,
however in my opinion the front fender flares are too square for the rounded body. The
rear spoiler is a glue on item and would look best left in the box. There are no recesses
molded in the body for mounting of the rear spoiler so deletion of this item would be
easy.&nbsp; Decals include pretty much what is shown on the box cover which are very
tacky, being just a set of single color bold stripes without even so much as a pinstripe
around them or even a color variation. Also included are two small Hot Rod license plate
decals and one Hot Rod decal that is approx. 2&quot; X 1&quot;.&nbsp; This is by far is
the cheapest (and were not talking price) Firebird model in my collection. There is a very
small amount of parts included and I would consider this kit to be very suitable for
beginning modelers. There is not even one chrome plated part in this kit.&nbsp; Not even
the wheels are chrome as the box cover would imply, nor are any of the engine parts. There
is also no tail lamp red plastic or amber front turn signal lamps. Pretty bleak for what
is supposed to be a street machine. I give this model two thumbs down!&nbsp; As for the
special magazine subscription offer, Hot Rod&nbsp; was offering 12 issues for $9.97.</p>

This is a rare Lindberg model of the proto-type &quot;Type K&quot; Trans Am wagon. Pontiac
actually built the car in 1978 but it was refitted with a new front end for the 79' model
year. The &quot;k&quot; is for Kammaback. This particular model was manufactured in 1984.
As you can see this model kit still retains its plastic wrapping so I am unable to give
you anymore details on it. Kenny has decided to forgo building this one and preserve it in
the condition it was bought in. Thanks for the scan Kenny.</p>

This is a 1/25 ERTL 79' Trans Am model. This may be somewhat of a rare model as Kenny
reports he has never seen another one like it. Interestingly it is not a typical model
molded in plastic but rather it is a diecast, but what is odd is that only the body is
metallic; the rest of the parts are molded plastic. It has separate doors that are hinged
as is the hood and trunklid. The metal body is bare metal with no paint or primer, the
plastic parts are molded in black with the exception of the parts that come chromed.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wheels are chrome snowflakes. There is no date as to when this model was
manufactured. The only decal included is a lone black and gold hood bird. </p>

This is a plastic model of a 1979 Trans Am. It is a promotional model given away at
dealerships. It is molded in a metallic platinum&nbsp;color. Decals included are much more
than what is shown on the box cover: silver/gray/black hood bird, sail panel birds, all
the body outlining stripes (grill openings, side windows, hood scoop, deck lid, bumpers,
and T-Tops), 4 - gold Trans Am decals, and 2 - gold T/A 6.6 decals. </p>

    This is a rather unusual kit but maybe a collectible one. It is a Revell model of a Trans
    Am customized by George Barris for John Travolta. The kit is a 79' Trans Am and is molded
    in silver. The decal set includes all the graphics you see on the car on the box. The
    engine in the kit is a 455 which is what was installed in the real car. The body is highly
    customized with flared IMSA style fenders per the Barris design. This kit drips of
    customization with custom wheels, a whale tail spoiler, side pipes, and a customized
    interior. On the roof Tops are provided for the pre-cut T-Tops but no chrome pieces are
    provided. This kit is dated 1979.<br>

    This model is a MPC brand 1/25th scale kit. The kit can be built two ways, either stock or
    race. The kit is dated 1988 and is molded in silver. The kit contains two sets of wheels,
    custom and the stock turbo version (both are chrome).&nbsp; The T-tops from this car are
    not cut out but<br>
    the is a distinctive line on the outside of the roof where they should be.&nbsp; The rear
    spoiler and wheel caps are separate parts from the body and must be glued on. For the race
    version of this kit, a full roll cage is included. Decals include all the decals on the
    box cover including the red pin stripes.&nbsp; Note however that there are no
    &quot;TRANS/AM&quot; decals on the box cover.&nbsp; There is however 4 full sets of the
    alphabet included from which you could cut the &quot;TRANS/AM&quot; name from (I think
    that was the intention as there in those type of letters).&nbsp; There is also 2 T/A 6.6<br>
    decals included.&nbsp; The deletion of the full Trans Am decals must have something to do
    with the SCCA regulations on the Trans Am name. Note: I have included a side shot of the
    box that shows the rear of the car to show how there is no spoiler decal. <br>
