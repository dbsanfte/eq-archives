<h3><a name="faq1"><font face="Foreground Font">How do I send you pictures of my Firebird
?</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">First let me tell you that I have a site standard
limitation of five images per car. You do not have to submit five images of your car but
you may submit up to that many. A good rule of thumb is to take 3 of the exterior and one
each of the interior and the engine bay, but this is not a requirement. You can send me
all five of the exterior if you wish or any other combination. <br>
There are three ways that you can submit images to this site:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Send me your Firebird photos via U.S. Mail at:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Jimmy Means<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
PSC 76 box 7258<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
APO AP 96319-7258<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will only post five pictures of your
car to the site but you may send me as many photos as you wish and I will pick the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; best five of the bunch. You also need to
indicate if you wish to have the photos mailed back to you.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. A faster way is through e-mail if you can scan them or
otherwise port them into your computer. There are several<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; products on the market (i.e. the
&quot;Snappy&quot;) that will allow you to take &quot;snapshots&quot; from a VCR or
camcorder and port<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them directly into your computer. Digital
cameras work well too and are slowly becoming reasonably priced. Once<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you've got them in the computer you can
send them to me via e-mail in any of the following formats: .JPG, .GIF, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .BMP, .PCX, .PNG, .TGA, .TIF, and .WMF.
The first three formats are the most desirable. Send them as <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attachments. There is no requirement for
size or number of colors, however larger images are more desirable than <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; smaller images. Get your images as close
to full screen as possible without sacrificing image quality. A good size <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would be 800x600 in 16.7 million colors. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Last and probably the quickest and easiest is to send me your images
via FTP. This option is not yet available but will be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the coming weeks.</font></p>

<h3><a name="faq2"><font face="Foreground Font">What kind of information would you like me
to include about my Firebird ?</font></a></h3>

<p>This is basically up to you. If you have already or are about to browse the site you
can read the information included with the images and you should be able to get a feel for
the kinds of information people are interested in reading. Ask yourself what kind of
information would you like other Firebird fans to know about your car!? Heres a couple of
suggestions to get you started, just remember you are not limited to answering just these
questions:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Engine/tranny - what kind of engine and
transmission combo are you currently using? What factory high performance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; goodies have been
installed on it? What aftermarket high performance parts have been installed? Has it been
rebuilt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; either professionally
or by yourself and if so what was done? Do you have a horsepower estimate?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Interior - What factory options did your
Firebird come with? Have you added any it didn't come with or deleted or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; modified any that that
it did? What color is it? Is it the deluxe or standard? etc....<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Paint &amp; Body - What color is your car?
Is it the original factory color? What modifications have you made in these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; areas? Is the color a
special order color from the factory?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Misc - Do you have any 1/4 mile times for
your car? Have you won any trophies or placed in any shows with your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firebird? Do you have
an interesting story about how you found and bought your car? etc...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Lastly if you have a homepage I will provide
a link to it free of charge. If you would like to take advantage of this offer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you need to provide me
with the URL to your homepage and the name of it. I also need to know if you would like me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to include your e-mail
address on the site with your car. I don't post private information like e-mail adresses
unless it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requested by the
individual.</p>

<h3><a name="faq3"><font face="Foreground Font">How do I send you pictures of Firebird
model kits ?</font></a></h3>

<p>If you have a Firebird model kit (it doesn't matter if its been built or not since all
I need is pictures of the box) that is not already depicted on the site and you would like
to submit some pictures of it heres how. First we'll go over sending in the pics. To
provide other site browsers with a good look at your model I would recommend you submit a
picture of the top of the box and one of the side (the side that usually has extra info
and pics of the car). The images should be clear and of good quality. For model pictures I
am only accepting them via e-mail at the moment. You can read over the &quot;<a href="#faq1">How do I send you pictures of my Firebird</a>&quot; faq above for specifics
on the images.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I can mention the benefit of sending in these pics. If you do
send me some images of a model not already displayed you will qualify for a free pass to
display one Firebird on the For Sale Lot. The pass may be used at anytime but is only good
for you. Your name will be entered in a small database (not online) I am using expressly
for this purpose. When you are ready to put a Firebird on the For Sale Lot you need only
show that you are redeeming your pass on the form that must be filled out to submit the ad
for the car and I will check your name in the database and you will not be charged for the
ad which would normally cost $5. </p>

<h5><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h5>

<hr>

<h3><a name="faq4"><font face="Foreground Font">What kind of information would you like me
to include with the Firebird model pics ?</font></a></h3>

<p>First of all providing information on the model you are sending pics of is not required
to receive either of the payments mentioned above but I highly encourage it. The reason
why is because I probably have not built or even seen some of the kits that will get sent
in so its impossible for me to provide site browsers with a good description of the model.
You on the other hand are the perfect candidate. Heres some of the things I'd like you to
tell me about your kit:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. What color the parts are molded in.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. If the kit can be built more than one way.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Descriptions of the decals and chromed parts
that are included.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. The date the kit was manufactured.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Any special or weird options included with
the kit.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Rarity and availability if you know it. </p>

<h3><a name="faq5"><font face="Foreground Font">I'd like to correct/dispute some Firebird
information you've put on the site !</font></a></h3>

<p>No problem at all. I only seek to provide Firebird fans out there the most accurate
information possible. I have owned six different Trans Ams over the last ten years but I
am far from the most knowledgeable in the hobby. If you think I have provided incorrect
information anywhere on this site please feel free to email with what you think is correct
and I will investigate it. If you are correct I will change the information and space
permitting put a remark naming you as the corrected information provider.<br>
<br>
send me your comments <a href="mailto:FirebirdGallery@0rdernet.com" target><img src="Animations/e-mail.gif" alt="e-mail.gif (9639 bytes)" border="0" WIDTH="65" HEIGHT="35"></a></p>

<h3><a name="faq6"><font face="Foreground Font">How do I get my Firebird on the For Sale
Lot ?</font></a></h3>

<p>Pictures of your Firebird along with an ad written by yourself can be submitted to the
For Sale Lot in three easy steps:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Go to the For Sale Lot and click on the
&quot;<a href="forsalelot1.htm">Sell Your Firebird Here</a>&quot; button for instructions<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Scan some images of your car into your
computer and e-mail them to me along with your text ad. A form to fill out for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the text ad will be
available soon. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Send a check or money order to pay for the
ad to:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; James T. Means<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PSC 76 Box 7258<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; APO AP 96319-7258<br>
<br>
Now I'll tell you the guidelines for the For Sale Lot:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. First and most important is the For Sale Lot
has no option for text-only ads. You must submit images of the car <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; being sold for the ad
to be displayed. If I do not receive images to go with the text that was submitted for a
particular<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ad I'll notify you that
some need to be sent. If I still don't receive any within a few days the ad will be
deleted. <br>
<em><small>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#faq7">see next FAQ</a></small></em><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. When dealing with the images themselves you
may send me up to six images of your car for the lot. To provide a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; potential buyer
with various views I have set up categories for the pics. These can be seen at the <a href="privatead.htm">ad information</a> page.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They do not
necessarily have to be strictly followed but it is encouraged. At least one front, one
rear, one side, one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interior and one
engine shot should be provided but is not mandatory.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The ad will be posted upon receipt of
payment. An ad submitted for one month is only $10 and only $15 to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; displayed until the car
is sold, you instruct me to terminate the ad, or I do not hear from you for more than 60
days.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monthly ads will have
to be paid for 5 days in advance of the new month to continue to be displayed. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Where else can you display six full screen
color pictures of your car to thousands of Firebird fans for $10 a month? <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. For those of you that may be wondering the
For Sale Lot is strictly for Firebirds unless I get a LOT of requests for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; other Pontiacs.....
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<h5><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h5>

<h3><a name="faq7"><font face="Foreground Font">Why don't you offer free text only
classifieds ?</font></a></h3>

<p>When I decided to build this site I was struck with the idea of creating a For Sale Lot
strictly for Firebirds and strictly image based. I decided this for several reasons. First
there are already numerous sites available on the internet that allow free text ads and I
found it boring and discouraging reading so many text ads and never having any idea what
the car looked like. I think most people would like to see a picture of the car being sold
along with the description. My goal is to have every Firebird that is For Sale on the
internet with an available image to be displayed on this site where the people most
interested in them can see them. Secondly I have seen a few sites that offered both types
of ads and neither site had any with images to go with the text. That tells me that people
will generally won't provide images if not required. Thus my For Sale Lot would wind up
like the others: full of text only ads but no images. So instead I'm trying to bring you a
quality top-notch classifieds section for a reasonable price. I hope you will agree with
me...</p>

<h3><a name="faq8"><font face="Foreground Font">How do I get my Firebird on the Projects
Lot ?</font></a></h3>

<p>This is very easy. You only need to do two things:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. First you need to send me some pics of your
Firebird undergoing its restoration, modification, race-prep whatever.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You need to follow the
same guidlines for sending images to me that was discussed in the <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;<a href="#faq1">How
do I send you pictures of my</a> <a href="#faq1">Firebird</a>?&quot; faq. When you are
organizing the pics you want to send just ask yourself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what kinds of images
you would like to see of someone elses project car.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Second you need to provide me some
information on what exactly is being done to the car. Try to avoid providing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; short descriptions of
what is happening in each picture. I clump the information sent together in several
paragraphs so<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an overall description
of what is being done to the car is most desirable. As to content of the information you
may<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provide any information
you would like people to know about your car. There is no specific requirement, as I said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; above just ask yourself
what things would you want to read about someone elses project.</p>

<h3><a name="faq9"><font face="Foreground Font">How do I get my Macho/MSE TA on the Macho
&amp; MSE Lot ?</font></a></h3>

<p>This is very easy you only need to do two things?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. First you need to send me pictures of your
Macho or MSE Trans Am. You need to follow the same guidlines for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sending images to me
that was discussed in the &quot;<a href="#faq1">How do I send you pictures of my Firebird</a>?&quot;
faq. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Second you need to provide me some
information about you Macho or MSE TA. The only requirement I have is that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you provide the series
number of your car i.e. 78' Macho Trans Am #24. This is because I am displaying the Macho<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and MSE cars in
numerical order on the lots as you have probably already seen. Although not a requirement,
since<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some owner may have
Machos or MSEs with rare equipment options and do not wish to divulge the fact, I would<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; highly encourage you to
include a list or breakdown of the modifications performed on your car by DKM and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; different options or
packages it received. Other information on the car is completely up to you. See the &quot;<a href="#faq2">What kind of</a><br>

<h3><a name="faq10"><font face="Foreground Font">How do I get my bitchin' 9 second tubbed
Firebird on the Drag Racing Firebirds Lot ?</font></a></h3>

<p>Well that sentence is a little misleading so let me clarify who this lot is for. This
lot is specifically reserved for cars that are no longer stock and are used solely for the
drag strip. If your car is basically stock, street legal but is taken to the track a few
weekends a year then your car can be displayed on one of the lots associated with its year
model. However if your car is no longer stock and is outfitted for some form of regular
drag racing then this is where your car should be displayed. Pro Street to Top Fuel to
Funny Cars is what you'll find gracing the pages of this lot. Now how do you get that
bitchin 9 second tubbed Firebird on the DRF lot! Two things must be done:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. First you need to send me some pictures of
your car. You need to follow the same guidlines for sending images to me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that was discussed in
the &quot;<a href="#faq1">How do I send you pictures of my Firebird</a>?&quot; faq. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Second you need to send me some information
about your Bird. Here's the categories I am displaying for each car and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the kind of information
I am looking for:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Engine: This should be fairly obvious. I'd like to see
information on displacement, horse power ratings and how it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
was built from bottom to top. You may be as in-depth and technical as you wish.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Drivetrain: Rear end and tranny information goes here.
Suspension and/or braking modifications can also be covered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
here. Chassis and frame info may also be added.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Body &amp; Interior: Here you tell us what modifications were
made to the body an interior to get it on the drag strip be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
it mild or wild. Tubbing the rear, replacing the interior with aluminum sheetmetal etc....<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Best Quarter Mile Time: I think I would be severely remiss if
I didn't include this one and I think its self explanatory.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Just be honest please.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I discuss the procedures
to change your resolution I would like to warn you that both your video card and your
monitor must be capable of supporting a resolution of 800x600. If you are unsure about
this then find out first before you make any changes. The problem that can occur is that
your windows will start properly after you reboot but the screen will be too garbled to
use and you will not be able to see the interface to change the resolution back to one
that is useable. There is a workaround for this and I will post it here after some
research. For windows 95 users, if you simply reboot in safe mode you will&nbsp; be able
to see the environment in a low resolution and will be able to change it back. This is not
meant to scare you or dissuade you from changing your resolution I just don't want to
cause problems for you. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as exactly what you are
changing I'm not going to go in-depth about it but to say that all you are changing is the
video mode with which you view your software on your monitor. Standard resolutions are
640x480, 800x600, and 1024x768. Most modern monitors should be able to go up to 1024x768
which is not needed for this site (800x600 is a lower resolution than 1024x768 but higher
than 640x480). I find a lot of people have their windows set to be viewed at 640x480 which
is a low resolution usually because it is the default setting and either they don't know
how to change it or don't know what the benefit will be. Basically the higher your
resolution the smaller things appear on the monitor and the more space you have to view.
If small icons and print bother you, you can usually set windows to use larger icons to
compensate. So whats the difference you say? Well 800x600 is a higher resolution than
640x480 as I said so all of your graphics will be more highly detailed and colorful. If I
have not satisfied your curiousity about this please feel free to send me an e-mail to ask
any questions before you make any changes and I'll be glad to discuss it further with you.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now to tell you how to make the
change I will discuss how to do it in Windows 95 since this should be the most common
interface and then Windows 3.11 for those of you still using it:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>1. To change your screen
resolution to 800x600 in Windows 95 follow these steps:</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I. Click the
&quot;start&quot; button on your tool bar and select &quot;settings&quot; and the
&quot;control panel&quot;....<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; II. Double click the
&quot;display&quot; icon...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; III. Click on the
&quot;settings&quot; tab...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IV. Under the heading
&quot;Desktop Area&quot; move the slider from left to right till 800x600 is displayed...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V. Next under the
heading &quot;Color Palette&quot; click on the dropdown menu and select &quot;True Color
(24bit)&quot;...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VI. Click &quot;ok&quot; and
if prompted reboot your computer.....&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VII. Thats it!! You can change your
video resolution to any combination you like this way, just be sure your video card<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and monitor will support the resolution you choose.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>2. To change you screen
resolution to 800x600 in Windows 3.11 is a bit harder:</strong><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I. Find and double
click your control panel icon....<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; II. Double click on the
&quot;setup&quot; icon....(note if your &quot;setup&quot; icon isn't located in your
control panel window you will have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to locate it to continue)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; III. You should see four settings
one of which is your &quot;display&quot;, click on the &quot;File&quot; menu and select
something like<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;edit/change settings&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IV. Once this has been selected the
four settings that were just text before should now be contained in drop down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
menus, select the display drop down menu.....<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V. You will be face with an
ominous list of choices, simply scroll down till you see something like 800x600 SVGA and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
click on it....<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VI. Click on &quot;ok&quot; to
enter the new setting, you may be prompted to put one of your windows setup disks in your
floppy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
drive, this is because the driver for the new resolution was not already installed and
must be copied from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
floppy, follow the instructions as they appear on the screen to install the new driver,
once its finished you may be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
prompted to reboot your computer for the changes to take affect, do this and your
finished!!!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VII. You can change your video resolution
to any combination you like this way just be sure your video card and monitor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
will support the resolution you choose. (Note if you wish to change your resolution back
to its previous value you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
simply follow these same steps and select whatever resolution had appeared in the
&quot;display&quot; category before you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
made the change. You should not be prompted to install drivers from a floppy because they
are already installed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
from the previous setting.)<br>
