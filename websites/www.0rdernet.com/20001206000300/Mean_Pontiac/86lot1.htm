    from the original owner a year ago. The car has the optional WS6 package with 16&quot;
    tires and aluminum rims. It also comes with 5-speed and the 305 (5.0L) HO engine. This
    engine was discontinued early in the production run due to fuel boiling problems. Because
    of this only 26 86' TAs received this powerplant making Randy's TA a pretty rare car. A 1
    of 26. The car is completely stock and according to Randy a very powerful car for a 3rd
    gen TA. Randy is a veritable Firebird buff having owned 6 2nd gen TAs and 7 3rd gens. Wow
    thats a lot of cars. He hopes to pick up a 96' Blackbird next.<br>

    <strong>&quot;I bought my Trans Am in 1995.&nbsp; A 1986 Trans Am 305.&nbsp; It was in
    pretty decent shape but it needed some things here and there and a paint job.&nbsp; The
    bad thing was I had to wait a year before I could afford to do these things.&nbsp; During
    the course of that year my poor T/A was vandalized, dented and backed into by a pizza
    guy's car.&nbsp; But at long last I was able to have</strong> <strong>the work done.
    &nbsp; I had every dent fixed and had the car painted electric blue (the original color)
    &nbsp; Then I added a Hypertech Thermomaster chip which keeps the car running cool even on
    100 degree days!&nbsp; I highly recommend Thermomaster chips to anyone who has an 80's T/A
    and is experiencing a overheating problem. This past summer (summer of 97')&nbsp; I've
    started taking my car to shows.&nbsp; I have won at a couple shows so far and my T/A and I
    attended the Trans Am Nationals in Dayton Ohio and The Tipp City Trans Am Cruise In.
    &nbsp; These are two of the biggest car shows in the country for Trans Am people. &nbsp;
    Firebirds and T/A's as far as the eye can see!&nbsp; This winter I plan on redoing the
    T-tops, the interior seats, and repainting the engine compartment.&nbsp; After that It's
    on to my next project: making a Knight Rider Trans Am.&quot;&nbsp; </strong><br>

was bought for only $800, the 305 was on the verge of serious failure but it was running
well enough to get it home. $400 was invested to get it running pretty good and Nick drove
it till it dropped a valve. A modified chevy 350 (5.7L) was dropped into the TA to boost
horsepower and improve performance. An Edelbrock Performer RPM Intake, Holley 600 carb,
and a Crane cam were added while building the 350. Nick even added a B&amp;M shift kite,
presumably to help with tire squealing. At 17 years old I think Nick has a heck of a daily
driver.</p>

    the deal, considering how much more I enjoy the Trans Am! I've always thought that the 3rd
    generation Trans Ams have a much more attractive body design than the Camaro, being much
    sleeker. The car is painted black with a white double pin-stripe and a grey and red lower
    body paint strip. The interior is black and grey. I've done a lot of work on the engine,
    with the help of my father, but I'm trying my hardest to keep this car in good shape. I
    love this Trans Am, and I've named it Black Sunshine. My car fits my personality
    perfectly, and I think the Trans Am is the only car I could ever drive. I got pulled over
    once, and I think the cop was very suprised to see a female at the wheel of this monster!

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="3"><strong>&quot;I bought my firebird in 1994. It
    looked pretty horrible considering it had almost no paint on it at all. But being a
    firebird fan I knew I could help her out. The first thing I did was paint it back to the
    original color except a little bit of metal flake in it. Then next a STEREO!!! I am a
    stereo fanatic. Most people on this website are more of the speed demons, but me I have to
    have the system instead. I dropped about $3000 in the system so far but I am always adding
    on. It consists of a Clarion CD head unit, a Punch 500 m, and punch 40.2 amps, 2 12&quot;
    punch subwoofers, a Rockford Fosgate capacitor, a Clarion 920 equalizer, 2 Infinity Kappa
    6x 9's, and 4x6 plate speakers, and a Stinger 150 amp alternator. After the stereo I had
    the windows tinted to 95%, added a solar wing on the rear window, Flowmaster exhaust, 16 x
    7 inch polished aluminum five stars, and some fender trim on the outside. On the inside I
    haven't done much yet, but I plan to in the very near future. I plan on getting the seats
    done in diamond pleated leather, and I have a friend who does neon lighting and Plexiglas
    work. I also plan on getting some ground effects, and a nice hood to put on it. As for the
    motor I have done really nothing but a rebuild because personally, I wouldn't waste my
    money on a 2.8. If I had an 8 cylinder I would though. I plan on dropping in a 350
    eventually but I want to work on the rest first. I have won some trophies here and there
    at local and regional competitions with my baby, but I mostly only compete in the stereo
    competitions. I love my bird though I most likely will never sell it.&quot;<br>

    cam. Aluminmum heads I polished and ported the intake and re-jetted the carb so its up
    around 360 hp. The carb is a Holley 750 vacuum secondary all 24k gold plated with chrome

    airbrushed. I installed a Daytona turbo hood. Rear smoked tail light covers and 5% tinted
    windows. The rear window has the Transam Phoenix sand blasted and colored to match the
    car. All the work and designing was done by me, all the plating was done by Advanced
    plating in Nashville Tenn. All metal work by JY racing New Milford Conn. All airbrushing
    done by Jimmy Halpin of Colortrix. The car was assembled with TLC, taped wrenches, toilet
    paper, papertowels and 7 years of work. <br>

    This Trans Am is one of three 3rd Gen TAs owned by Jeff Schick. Jeff writes:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;My '86 Trans Am is my first TA. This car is completely
    stock and has no modifications. Although the odometer's pushing 228K miles (100K+ on
    second engine), I'm only the second owner. The original owner took great care of this car;
    drove it until the day he passed away. I bought it from his daughter with 223K miles on
    it. The car is flame red with a red and gray cloth interior. It has a carbureted 5.0L V8
    with a 5 speed and t-tops. I really like the pre-GTA diamond spoke rims (don't know their
    part code). They seem to be uncommon on mid 80s TAs.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    </strong>As I said this is one of three. The other two TAs he owns are:<br>
    1989 20th Anniversary Trans Am which can be seen at '89 Firebirds <a href="89lot2.htm">Lot#2</a><br>
    1990 GTA which can be seen at '90 Firebirds <a href="90lot1.htm">Lot#1</a><br>
