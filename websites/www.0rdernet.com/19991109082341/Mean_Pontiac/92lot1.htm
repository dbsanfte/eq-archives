T-Top firebird. Little changed between the 91' and 92' model years. 92' would prove to be
the last year for the third generation Firebirds. 15 additional option groups were added
and horsepower ratings increased on almost all the available engines. The base Firebird
V-6 was increased to 140hp, the 5.0L HO was upped to 230hp, and the popular optional 5.7L
was massaged to 240hp.</p>

of putting louvers on the rear windows got its start back in 77' and 78' and has continued
to be a popular modification. The convertible while pricey proved to be a successful
option when it was reintroduced in 1991. Nearly 1,500 were manufactured in 91' and over
1,800 were produced in 92'. This option would be dropped in 93' but would be brought back
again in 94' with the all new fourth generation Firebirds. I only wonder why they waited
so long to offer it again.</p>

the car. This dam was put in place to force cool air up into the radiator to help with
cooling. SLP continued to install their Firehawk packages onto factory built Formulas. For
the second year the Firehawk was restricted to the Formula body and the color red.</p>

run.</p>

rare color for any of the early 90s models. The standard wheel for the Trans Am and GTA
continued to be the 16x8 diamond spoke aluminum rim. High performance P245/50ZR16 steel
belted radial tires were mounted on the aluminum rims. </p>

    the Firebird lineup. A special kind of Formula could now be ordered and it was called a
    Firehawk. The Formula was constructed at the factory like normal but was then sent to
    Street Legal Performance (SLP) where the Firehawk package was added for a very pricey sum.
    The package included a lot of engine and suspension upgrades as well as a different tire
    and rim package and the Firehawk graphics.</td>

peopel mistook it for an fancy Formula in the early years till the term
&quot;Firehawk&quot; got around. I'm sure a lot of camaro and mustang owners got some
surprises out some plain-looking Formulas.</p>

    option would remain restricted to the Formula model until the new 98's debuted. Early
    Firehawks got some interior treatments along with all the upgrades in engine, suspension
    and braking. New shoulder harness seat belts and a full roll bar were standard upgrades.
    Aftermarket Brembo brakes were also an upgrade to provide better than factory braking for
    the increased horsepower provided by the warmed over LT1s. </td>
