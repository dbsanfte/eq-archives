    <td width="77%" height="161" valign="top" style="text-align: left; vertical-align: text-top">This is Scott Holland's Trans Am. This
    brand newly remodeled bird comes with the 5.0L chevy 305 engine. Scott has warmed it over
    a little with some high performance equipment. A Crane compu cam, 9:5-1 casts pistons,
    crane 1:6 ratio rockers, Weiand action plus intake, a Holley 0-1850 600cfm 4bbl
    carburetor, Accel high output coil, and Accel street wires round out the mods. Exhaust is
    handled by a set of Hedmann Headers which feed a set of Hedmann Y-pipes which flow through
    custom 2½&quot; pipes which feed a pair of Dyno Max mufflers and exits out a set of Megs
    4&quot; tips. The engine is bolted to a TH-350 tranny. A B&amp;M transmission pack has
    been added along with a B&amp;M trasnmission cooler. A new GM posi-trac 7 5/8 10 bolt disk
    brakes was also added along with new 3.23 Zoom gears. A 7/8&quot; rear sway bar with
    polyurethane bushings was installed to improve handling. Finally a set of 15&quot;x8&quot;
    (rear) and 15&quot;x7&quot; (front) Outlaw II American Racing Rims were installed with a
    set of BF Goodrich tires. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most recently Scott has had the old TA painted Jet Black with
    Concept-90 paint. Also some under the hood gauges were added and the engine compartment
    was cleaned up and detailed. Scott also sent me some ¼ mile info:<br>
    <br>
    Best ¼ mile time to date: 14.45 @ 96mph </td>

Blandino's Firebird started out as a base model Firebird but is far from it now. It
originally came with a factory 2.5L (151cu.in.) 4 cylinder engine known as the &quot;Iron
Duke&quot;. The engine was rated at a pitiful 92hp. Wondering why all the
&quot;import&quot; 4-bangers made more horses than did his Firebird, Chris set out to make
some changes. The factory throttle body was swapped with a Holley T.B.I. unit which had a
larger throttle bore. The factory intake manifold was also traded for an Edelbrock T.B.I.
intake. Hooker Super Competition headers replaced the factory exhaust manifolds, a Dynomax
Super Turbo muffler was installed and an N.O.S. Nitrous kit was also added for that
&quot;little&quot; extra. The engine was also rebuilt. The rebuild included a balanced
motor and&nbsp; align honed, shot peened heads, a Crane cam and vlave train components,
and 4 custom pistons by Venolia. After all this the car was still only pulling low 10s on
the bottle at the local 1/8 mile track. Very frustrating to say the least, but Chris
continued to drive the car. About 40k miles later the engine decided it too was unhappy
with the situation and dropped a valve. $10 and a scrap heap in a junkyard later and Chris
had an opportunity to put a much better engine in the Poncho. An 83' Civic was bought to
serve daily driver chores and Chris began building another engine for the bird. This time
the block would be a V-8 (imagine that). Here's the current setup: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 383c.i. stroker, built with a Crane 272 grind cam, Speed Pro
Hypereutectics Pistons, Edelbrock intake, Carter AFb 4bbl, 1.94/1.60 valves, and an Accel
Hei unit. Exhaust starts with Hedmann Shorty headers and flows through Dynomax mufflers
via 3&quot; pipe. The N.O.S. kit was transferred from the old junk motor. A 700R4
automatic with TCI kit performs the shifting duties. Suspension Techniques sway bars were
added along with 16&quot; rims from an 86' TA. The nose from the 86' was also transferred
over to Chris' car. The car was then repainted Porsche Guards Red.<br>

The 1982 year model saw the most radical changes of any year before. The third generation
Trans Ams were born and the were a completely new design from models past. Gone were
stationary headlights; replaced by the popular &quot;flip-up&quot; or &quot;pop-up&quot;
headlights that are still in use on the current Trans Am model. This particular car proves
a few things held over from the previous years. Although no longer a special edition the
black and gold paint scheme continued.</p>
