&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#400000"><big>It took George
Siegel years to get his 1970 Firebird restored and ready to vintage race, but it took only
seconds for Formula One veteran Bib Stillwell to name it. Siegel had spent the last three
years building his immaculate blue and white Trans-Am series replica instead-instead of a
planned six months- and he was finally participating in the action at the Walter Mitty
Challenge when a rain delay put things on pause. He wandered over to the covered garages
to catch a glimpse of a particularly beautiful Formula One ride and ended up meeting its
driver, Stillwell. After a chat about the car he was driving-a Keke Rossberg backup from
the early '60s-the Australian turned to Siegel and asked, in a very heavy accent, &quot;An
wat 'r you drivin' mate?&quot; When the American told him he was driving a vintage
Trans-Am replica, Stillwell replied, &quot;Oh, drivin' a yank tank r we?&quot; The name
stuck, with an ersatz British spelling added for effect.</big><br>
<big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The &quot;Tanque&quot; is
based on a 1970 Trans-Am roller that Siegel purchased in 1991. He has attempted to keep it
as close to vintage Pontiac specs as possible, though he has had to make a few
substitutions to keep the cost realistic. For example, there are very few 303c.i. Pontiac
engines available and those are astronomically expensive, so Siegel substituted a 400c.i.
Ram Air III which is dimensionally almost identical to the 303s that would have been raced
25 years ago. In this last year, he has added a pair of Ram Air IV heads that he has built
up. &quot;This will provide a better sense of originality, as these heads were used during
the early years&quot;, he explains. The roll cage, window net, fuel cell, etc... have been
kept as close to original as possible, and the frame and body are as-raced as well.
Improvements center around safety features: the car now sports a Halon fire system,
NASCAR-style driver's side door bars, and a Cobra kevlar seat.</big><br>
<big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a rough start-the car
blew an engine on its first outing-the &quot;Tanque&quot; has proven to be a reliable
contender. Siegel finished 3rd in class at the 1994 Walter Mitty Challenge, 2nd at the
1995 event, 3rd at the 1996 event and 2nd in the fall HSR race at Roebling Road. Siegel
credits a number of people who, he says, &quot;have helped dramatically in making my
dreams come true&quot;, including his wife Sherry, &quot;who has supported me even when it
didn't seem logical to do so.&quot; He also voiced appreciation for Jeff Henninge, his
best friend and crew chief; Ed Waller, who supplied him with all the vintage pieces; and
Steve Simonaitis, who acts as the &quot;Yanque Tanque&quot; crew.</big><br>
