<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first factory assembled Firebird Promotional Models
appeared in 1967 coinciding with the introduction of the real car and continued through
1974. Starting in 1975 and continuing through 1980, Firebird promos were unassembled kits
known as a &quot;Promo Kit&quot;. The promo kit consisted of approximately 25 parts and
was finished in factory colors. These promo kits were packaged in colorful boxes depicting
pictures of the real car. Between 1981 and 1992 no Firebird promotional models were
produced. With the introduction of 4th generation car in 1993, Pontiac once again offered
Firebird promotional models, however 1997 would be the last year. These assembled
miniature 1/25<sup>th</sup>-scale models were made by MPC from 1967 through 1980 and by
AMT/Ertl from 1993 trough 1997. These models were pre-assembled versions of the same 1/25<sup>th</sup>-scale
kits that were available at hobby stores. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to being finished in authentic factory colors and
available only at Pontiac Dealers, these promos differed from the kits in several ways.
The entire model was molded in a factory color. This meant the body, interior, and chassis
are the same color. The hood, doors, and trunk could not be opened. The tires and wheels
were a two piece construction including one chrome wheel and one tire. This differed from
the regular 1/25<sup>th</sup>-scale kits, which included a three-piece design; chrome
wheel, tire, and back wheel. Two steel axles were used for both front and rear wheels.
This allowed the model to roll easily. An engine/transmission block off plate was used in
place of the kits detailed motor. The chassis was highly detailed with a complete front
and rear suspension, drive train and exhaust system. The front and/or rear license plates
had the year of the model on them. Finally four small screws held the body and the chassis
together. They came in white boxes with the year, make, and color printed on the end of
the box. The purpose of these models was to provide Pontiac Dealers a detailed replica of
the real car to give to a potential customer. Hence the name &quot;Dealer Promotional
Model.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><font size="6">First Generation 1967-1969</font></b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first generation 1967-1969 Firebird promos were available
in coupe and convertible. Colors were limited on the Firebird, generally two or three
colors for the coupe and one or two colors for the convertible. Many of the first
generation 1967-69 Firebird promos have become difficult to obtain in presentable
condition. This is due to the fact they were given to small children to play with so the
attrition rate was very high. For example, the 1968 Firebird Convertible is one of the
rarest Pontiac promotional models and is considered the most sought after of the first
generation models. Value of the first generation Firebird promos in near mint condition
generally range from approx. $225.00 for a &#146;67 coupe to $475.00 for a &#146;68
convertible. Please keep in mind that values can and will fluctuate. These prices
represent the value for promos in near mint to mint condition that I have experienced
while collecting these models. The following is a detailed look at the 1967-69 Firebird
promos.</p>

    &#150; </b>Colors known to exist: Verdoro Green Metallic and Meridian Turquoise. It came

    time a hood tachometer and Pontiac Crest on the front grill appeared. It also had Redline
    tires, Rally II wheels and a blacked-out grill with the name Pontiac highlighted in
    silver. It was a 4-speed car however there was no shifter. The interior featured a console
    with vacuum gage and nicely molded seat belts on the front bucket seats and the rear seat.
    The traction bars were deleted on the 1968 promos. Value of this model is generally in the

    <b>Convertible &#150; </b>Colors known to exist: Solar Red and Alpine Blue Metallic. It

    II wheels and a blacked-out grill with the word Pontiac highlighted in silver. It was a
    4-speed car however there was no shifter. The convertible has the same interior detail as
    the coupe. The traction bars at the rear axle were deleted. This is a very rare model and
    appears to be the most valuable of the first generation promos. Value is around $475.00
    for a near mint condition example.</td>
