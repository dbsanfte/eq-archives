    friend of mine, Rich Miller. Rich writes:<br>
    <br>
    <strong>&quot;When Car &amp; Driver's first look at the '98 Trans Am hit the stands
    (actually my brother's mailbox) I headed out to find my dream car: a '97 WS6 T/A. Now
    everyone will have their own opinion about the restyled car, but I prefer the cleaner
    styling of the original 4th generation. The icing on the cake is Pontiac's clever reunion
    of Ram Air with Firebird. Five spoke 17&quot; inch wheels and a WS6 badge complete the
    visual clues. I missed my '94 T/A and found out that my wife did too! With that stamp of
    approval I started what I thought would be a hopeless attempt to find a black 6-speed WS6
    Trans Am <i>after</i> Pontiac had stopped taking orders for the '97 model year. As luck
    would have it a local dealer had a car on order exactly the way I would have optioned it.
    After a nail-biting wait in which the whereabouts of the car were unknown it finally
    arrived. All I can say is what a car! The power, handling, comfort, and conveniences are
    first class. I certainly don't want to start old versus new or corporate V-8 arguments,
    but nay sayers should test drive the latest Firebirds before condeming them. Am I selling
    my Judge? OF COURSE NOT!&quot;</strong><br>
    <br>
    Rich previously owned a 1970 Trans Am (see the 70' Firebirds <a href="70lot1.htm">Lot#1</a>)
    that he sold in order to pick up a more economical daily driver.<br>

    Rich is webmaster for perhaps one of the top five Pontiac sites on the web called <br>
    <a href="http://www.iwc.com/inmax/classic_folder/index.html">Classical Pontiac</a>. If you
    are a Pontiac fan and haven't seen this site yet you will definitely want to drop by and
    see it. Just one of the cool parts of the site is one of the largest
    &quot;Pontiac-Only&quot; classifieds I have seen on the web.<br>

version Firehawk looks aggressive and ready to fly. The Firehawk contiued to be an
available option for th 97' year model. As in the past it was only available on the
Formula models. The Formula was built in stock trim by the factory and was then sent to
Street Legal Performance (SLP) where the actaul Firehawk package was installed. Many
changes have taken place with the Firehawk since its inception in1991. The price had
become much lower and some equipment (like interior roll cage setups) had been changed
removed or discontinued. However the end product was still as much of a performer as
before and maintained its threat status with the other sports cars being offered on the
market. </p>
