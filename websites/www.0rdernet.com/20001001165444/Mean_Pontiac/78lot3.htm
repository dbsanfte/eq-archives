several TAs are gathered together. I just wish it was in color.&nbsp;Good news!! It is in
color now thanks to Michael Burch, who happened to be browsing the site when he noticed
this pic and realized he had a color version of it. Thanks for the updated pic Michael.
Its MUCH easier to identify colors now.&nbsp; <br>
Apparently this pic is as popular with site visitors as it is with me. Shortly after I got
the updated color version of the pics itself another site visitor wrote in with some
information as to its origins. The contributor is David Hughes. He found the following
passage in the book: The Fabulous Firebird, along with this photo.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="3" color="#400040"><strong>&quot;Trans Am enthusiasts
within Pontiac Motor Div. had wanted for sometime to establish special areas near race
cources where Firebird owners could park their cars and socialize.&nbsp; Such meeting
grounds had already been set aside at various tracks for other makes of cars; Corvette
Corals, Porsche Parks, Datsun Z Zones, etc. GM's then design vice president William L
Mitchell, in talking to &quot;Mr. Trans Am&quot;, John Schinella in 1975, suggested
setting up a &quot;Trans Am Teepee&quot; along the lines of the Corvette Corals.&nbsp;
Schinella jumped at the opportunity. Schinella's assistant designer and fellow T/A
enthusiast, Bill Davis, came up with the name Trans Am Territory.&nbsp; Schinella passed
the idea along to Pontiac general manager Alex Mair, who felt that a Trans Am Territory
was program was just what Pontiac needed.&nbsp; Pontiac public relations chief Stan
Richards appointed Jill Rogers to work out the details in conjunction with John Schinella.
On June 5-6, 1976, Schinella, Rogers, and Dick Henderson launched the first Trans Am
Teritory at Road America, Elkhart Lake, Wisc.&nbsp; This SCCA event marked part of
Pontiac's 50th anniversary celebration, and the Sports Car Club of America designated a
black and gold 1976 Limited Edition Trans Am its official car for the 10 race 1976 Trans
American Championship series.&nbsp; Subsequently, Pontiac acquired a GMC motorhome called
the Trans Am Traveler and soon established Trans Am Territories not only at Road America
but also at Watkins Glen, Mosport, Road Atlanta, Mid-Ohio, Michigan International, Laguna
Seca, Riverside, and Pocono raceways.&nbsp; Each became a greater success than the one
before, sometimes with as many as 325 Trans Am's and other Firebirds in attendance.
Schinella rarely misses one of these events, and Rogers never does.&nbsp; Other regulars
include Stu Schuster, Russ Dunbar, Wade Greenisen Jr., and George T. Reganis.&nbsp; The
Type K, Silverbird, Banschee III, and various special Firebirds are usually displayed in
roped off areas.&nbsp; Local Trans Am clubs turn out en masse.&nbsp; Firebird ownres
usually take at least a parade lap around each track. In addition to refreshments and
hospitality, the Territory staff often provides complete car cleaning facilities for
Firebird owners: water, buckets, cloths, etc.&nbsp; Awards have been given at several
events for Most Original Paint Scheme,&nbsp; Outstanding Trans Am,&nbsp; and so
forth.&nbsp; And at special races, T/A Territory T-shirts are given out to those
attending.&quot;</strong></font><font color="#000000" size="2"><br>

I received some updated information about this pic from David Hughes. This is a 1978
Canadian sales brochure for a plain Solar Gold Trans Am, not its more popular Y-88
counterpart. You can see the aluminum 15x8 Snowflake rims that were installed on these
cars at the factory. These rims have proven to be some of the most popular manufactured by
Pontiac. I have seen these and their 15x7 cousins used not only on various year models of
Firebirds but also on just about any Pontiac on the road. Used sets can usually be found
fairly easy and for a decent price.&nbsp; <br>

    great looking Trans Am that has been in his family since it was bought new at the dealer.
    Mark remembers he was only sixteen in April of 1978 when he rode home in it, sitting in
    the passenger seat. 210,000 miles and 20 years later the old TA has changed a little bit
    including the installation of a 455, possibly the only thing Pontiac could have done to
    make this car better. Below is a break down of the cars current configuration:<br>

    Brett Sandidge owns this radically painted Trans Am. He purchased it from the original
    owner in 1985. Since then the car has seen quite a lot of work to get it to its present
    day status. If you'd like to read about the history of the car <a href="sandidge.htm">click
    here</a>. The engine and drivetrain while still the original equipment have also been
    massaged a bit.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To start with a set of 67' GTO heads (2.11 intake
    &amp; 1.77 exhaust) were added. An Edelbrock Performer Camshaft (custom ground by Doug
    Statler) was installed. Also from Edelbrock a Performer aluminum intake manifold was added
    topped by a Holley 750 (zinc plated) carburetor. A Warrior Racing timing chain cover and
    Milodon Gear Drive were also added. Last but most definitely not least a Compucar NOs
    system was installed for the little extra punch. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the tranny the original TH400 still handles the shifting but
    its been outfitted with a B&amp;M shift kit and a 2500 stall speed converter. On the
    inside a B&amp;M shifter was added to improve shifting. The tranny hooks up to a 10-Bolt
    GM rear end with 3.73 gears.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the many modification this car has undergone the subframe
    was removed and powdercoated, new Energy Suspension Bushings were installed and the car
    was lowered 2 inches. The TAs current color is 1995 Dodge Ram Red and PPG Deltron paint
    was used for the spraying. The graphics on the car were custom airbrushed on. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the interior a set of Corbeau seats were added with RCI 5-point
    harnesses. Factory gauges were replaced by digital Cyberdyne gauges. Other goodies
    installed include 3&quot; Hooker Headers setup with 3&quot; Flowmaster mufflers, a set of
    Centerline rims from Warrior Racing, and a set of Mickey Thompson Sportsman Is.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I highly recommend you read the history of the car that I've
    linked above to get a real idea of what this car has been through and what it has become.
    The owner and many others have invested a LOT of time and effort in it.<br>
    <br>
    Brett is the president of <a href="http://www.geocities.com/MotorCity/Track/1250/index.html">Dream Machines Car Club
    Inc.</a> based out of central Illinois. The club was founded over 12 years ago by 12 guys
    and focuses on people who chose to drive cars other than Fords and Chevies which were very
    much the norm in Illinois at the time.<br>
    Brett also has his own homepage called <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/6895/dakota.html">Vulgar Display of Power</a>.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="3"><strong>&quot;This car came with the W60
    &quot;Skybird&quot; package, although it has been incorrectly repainted by the previous
    owner. The car has been a work in progress since I bought it two years ago in my senior
    year of high school, and it serves as my daily driver to college. When I bought the car it
    seemed to have a lot of original parts like the date-coded ignition wires, the OE style
    clamps on hoses used by GM, etc. I have the original 350 Chevrolet engine with the TH-350
    transmission. A Dynomax Super-Turbo exhaust with 2.5 inch pipes, Accel HEI Supercoil,
    8.8mm wires, ignition curve kit, new higher capacity radiator, and a new Quadrajet were
    the only changes I've made so far. Its fairly stock but it does get the job done. The
    engine has 105,800 miles on it. As far as the cosmetic aspects of the car, it has the
    light blue (code 24 I think) interior. The car is equipped with deluxe trim, custom cloth
    seats, formula steering wheel, power windows, air conditioning, and a console. I also have
    an Alpine stereo rather than the original AC Delco AM radio. The interior is mostly
    original. The exterior was incorrectly painted a light blue very similar to that
    odd-looking Trans-Am in the '78 picture lot. The snowflake wheels are 15x7 with 235/60R15
    BF Goodrich Radial T/A's and are the correct paint color. Well, that's all there is for
    now, but changes will be made over time.&quot;<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;Hi. Here are a few pictures of my 78 Trans Am. It's got
    30,000 original miles on it, and I bought it from the original owner 6 months ago. I found
    the build sheet under the passengers seat to verify the options it has. It's pretty
    straight forward, and unfortunately does not have the handling package. Other than that,
    it has A/C, power windows, 8-track, automatic, deluxe interior, etc. It's in original

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;This past summer I kind of started looking around
    for a Trans Am. Not really to buy, but just looking to see what was out there. I looked at
    two others before I found this one. The first car I looked at was a 1980 Trans Am turbo.
    The car was in real rough shape and he wanted $2200 dollars. The next car I looked at was
    a 1979 Trans Am. It was an Arizona car. It had a 455 with a 4-speed in it. The body and
    frame was in excellent condition. He wanted $3500. I was going to buy it, then the guy
    before me bought it. So I finally was getting over my Trans Am kick until I saw on the
    Internet a 1978 Y88 4-speed. I almost fell over. To find out it was only 1 hour from me. <br>
    As you can see there is a bit of rust on the quarters and a little bondo. Not bad at all.
    That will all be replaced with sheet metal patches. Also a car had bumped the passenger
    door. The engine is a rebuilt 400. I did number crunching on it and it turns out the motor
    is a 1975 block. I guess I can deal with it. It has been rebuilt and runs very strong. I
    added a Performer intake and Performer carb by Edlebrock. I can say Edlebrock makes better
    carbs than Holley. The frame is perfect, so is the trunk. The seats have no tears in them
    whatsoever, and they are pretty clean. I am still going to get them refinished this summer
    anyway. I have put a new carpet in it, along with new tires and front springs. I also plan
    on replacing the rear springs (Air shocks keeping it in the air now). <br>
    The car did leak some coolant when I got it and also a service guy tried to put a new
    power steering line in it. It leaked like no tomorrow. I pulled it apart and you could see
    dirt in the threads, so that is why it leaked. Also the pump leaked and I took care of
    that. She runs great though. There are no cracks in the dash or console at all. As you can
    see I have the original window sticker so it is the real mckoy.<br>
    The price you ask?<br>
    $2500 dollars.<br>
    <br>
    I always wanted to have a Trans Am with a 4-speed and now I have a Y88 4-speed.&quot;</strong><br>
