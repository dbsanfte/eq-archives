    This pristine silver Trans Am belongs to a good friend of mine who I know solely through
    the internet. Chris Batson is the lucky guy that gets to tool around town in this silver
    bullet scaring the h**l out of the bowties. Chris writes:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><font size="3">&quot;The car was bought in my neighboring town
    for the menial price of $8,352.46. My uncle, from whom I bought the car from, has owned
    this beauty since 1982. I am the proud 4th owner of this all original 1979 Trans Am. It
    has the oldsmobile 403, automatic with posi-traction, although I am unsure of the gear
    ratio right now. The car is strong and tight. It has been stored every winter since its
    been in Minnesota. I am currently looking to do some minor restoration on it to get it to
    brand new as the doors are starting to crust at the corners. The car has A/C, Cruise
    control, Block heater, moldings, hood decal, am/fm radio cassette, tilt. The car is
    Platinum in color, just about the same color as the 10th Anniversary TA's. I sent in the
    VIN information to PHS for documentation and the car is all matching! I paid the sum of
    $4,000 dollars for this beauty. I recently had it appraised and its worth more than I
    paid, needless to say. I am lucky enough to have the original build sheet and am searching
    for the original window sticker, but will be able to purchase a reprint from PHS. I
    hopefully will add 3 more T/A's to my garage in the near future. Possibly a 70-73, 77 or
    78 and an 85 T/A. Naturally I may end up getting another here and there if I find
    something I like. A 1976 50th would be sweet!&quot;</font></strong><font SIZE="2"><p></font><font size="3"><strong>Chris Batson<br>

    This poncho looks like its on the warpath just sitting there!! Owner Bill Smith has the
    honors of piloting this street warrior around town. I'll bet its fun to drive at night!!

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><font size="3">&quot;I bought this TA from a friend who
    had been teasing me with it for about a year. He knew I wanted it and also knew I couldn't
    afford it. After some financial fanageling, I finally figured out how to buy it a week
    before some friends of his from Indianapolis were going to come get it and strip it down
    and take it to the dragstrip. The body has 85,000 miles on it, the interior is all
    original and in near perfect condition. It has a new base coat clear coat black paint job
    with an all new rebuilt 400 pontiac, generating over 400 horsepower. All mechanical work
    was done by the prior owner ( Richard Clark Jr.) He also rebuilt the M21 4 speed
    transmission and installed 3:90 gears in the rear-end. All together it makes for an
    awesome combination. Even though I'm 45 years, driving this car brings back some fun
    memories of the late 60's when everybody had a Hot Rod.&quot;</font></strong></td>

    This awesome brown Trans Am is owned by Katie. Katie writes:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="3"><strong>&quot;My dad bought the car when he was 20 years
    old. He has kept it since then, and passed it down to me. Since I have had it I've been
    trying to improve its performance and the luxury of the car. On the inside I have a
    Clarion CD player and I just had the headliner redone. In about another week I'm going to
    buy all the little plastic pieces that fit on the consol and the sifter, because over the
    years they have started to crack. On the outside I have installed two Flowmaster mufflers
    and a High-flo catalytic converter. This has added about 20 hp to my car. Also I have put
    many hours of hard work washing and waxing my car, but on the other hand what Trans-Am
    owner doesn't enjoy waxing their car? Anyway, I hope that in another month I'll be able to
    have the paint redone on the car and have the engine steam cleaned. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to comment on one of the other Trans-Am owner's
    paragraphs on how he got his car. He said&nbsp; he rescued it from a 18yr old girl that
    was driving it to school. I'm 17 years old and I drive my car to school every day, I also
    drive it to the mall, the barn, and anywhere else I have to go. I have kept the car just
    as nice as my dad did, and I don't plan on having it &quot;rescued&quot; from me. I dont
    know if I'm not the stereotypical 17 year old girl or not, but I take good care of my car,
    just like any older person would.</strong><font SIZE="2"> </font><strong>If anyone wants
    to talk to me about my car please E-mail me. I love to hear any comments or sugestions, or
    just talk about my car. Thanks.&quot;</strong><p><strong>Katie Taylor<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="3"><strong>&quot;The Formula is a 1979, with the rare
    400/4-speed combo. It's also a WS-6 car with the 4-wheel disc brakes. It belonged to a
    friend of mine who drove it through high-school. It had about 1,500 miles on it when he
    bought it. My wife and I tracked it down a couple of years ago and bougt it from it's
    fourth owner. It's in pretty good shape, but it will be recieving a sub-frame-off
    restoration in the near future. It's options include air, power trunk, power antenna, the
    Formula appearance package, and deluxe interior (vinyl). It's color is &quot;medium
    metallic camel&quot; and the camel interior.&quot;<br>
