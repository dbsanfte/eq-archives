    <td width="77%" height="161" valign="top" style="text-align: left; vertical-align: text-top">This 83' Trans Am with a KITT
    conversion is owned by Stephen Laskowski. The car is actually a black and gold recaro
    Trans Am. It was purchased in november of 1995 with only 66k miles showing on the clock,
    for $4,195. Steve invested some money into the brakes (all new), a new paint job, and some
    rear end work. The car had been making a strange sound that the previous owner had assured
    him was the sound of air being sucked into the engine through the hood. He would later
    find out that the rear-end had been rebuilt at one time and reassembled too tightly which
    caused one of the bearings to fall apart. However on the lighter side these were the only
    mechanical problems he has experienced since owning the car. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car has every option available on an 83' model including
    leather recaro seats. These were actually replaced thought during the installation of the
    KITT conversion kit with the KITT PMD, open head rest, tan cloth seats. Steve obtained
    these hard to find seats from a junkyard and paid the hefty sum of $1,000 to have the
    reupholstered in the correct color (originally burgundy). The stock TA wheels were also
    replaced with the 14&quot; bowling-ball style rims. He found them in a wheel shop and
    picked them up for $125 for the set. However he would later discover the real KITT car had
    come with 15&quot; rims. Luckily a co-worker had a junk TA with the proper 15&quot; rims
    and traded them for the 14&quot;s. Keeping the car as original as possible is definitely a
    priority but some modifications have been performed to make the car as realistic as
    possible. A tiny camera was added to the roof of the car that connects to one of the TVs
    in the dash and will serve as a rear view mirror. The gas pedal is lit with 16 tiny green
    12v bulbs that light up when the pedal is pressed. A 4x6 speaker was mounted under the
    hood which is attached to a wireless remote PA system. This is used at car shows to to
    give the appearance that the car is talking. Most recently a fully functional Knight Rider
    dash was just installed in october. The dash came from Mark's Custom Kits. It contains 2
    TVs, a direction compass, all digital gauges, and voice box LEDs that work with the
    signals from the radio. The car also has an overhead console with a keypad that serves
    several purposes. Most are on/off switches for things like the PA system or rear view
    camera but some make telephone chimes to add believeability to the electronic cockpit. <br>

    <td width="77%" height="161" valign="top" style="text-align: left; vertical-align: text-top">This Trans Am belongs to Jim Suva. On
    January 18, 1984 Jim spotted the car on the back lot of Dan Wolf Pontiac in LaGrange, IL.
    The car was covered with snow and had a dead battery. It was the last one on the lot. Jim
    took it for a test drive and with a little help from his dad purchased it the next day.
    The car was built in May of 1983 at Van Nuys, CA and had been sitting on the lot for 7
    months. It came equipped with the 5.0L Crossfire EFI engine. The car is well optioned with
    T-Tops and every other option except power seats. It retains its originality save for a
    repaint on the hood to repair paint chips and some repairs seen below. Jim has also
    retained all the original documentation on the car including an information packet and the
    original dealer invoice received from <a href="http://www.phs-online.com">Pontiac
    Historical Services</a>.&nbsp; The car turned over 100,000 miles on April 15, 1994. In all
    that time only the camshaft, radiator, master brake cylinder, heater core, and started
    have been replaced. Jim has nicknamed his car &quot;Kitt&quot; after the car featured on
    the TV series Knightrider that went by the same name. According to him the car is treated
    as a family member.<br>

    Daytona 500 Limited Edition Trans Am and its owned by Keith Stephens. These cars featured
    a two-tone white and gray paint treatment, an Aero Package and suitable graphics. On the
    inside you'll find leather recaro seats, red instrument panel lighting, cruise control,
    only Daytona 500 mats. Only 2,500 of these unique Firebirds were produced. Keith's TA came
    from the factory with a cross-fire injected 305 and a 4-speed automatic transmission. This
    setup was swapped in favor of &nbsp; a 350c.i. engine and a 4-speed manual transmission.
    It retains the factory leather Recaro seats, but they need to be reupholstered. &nbsp; <br>
