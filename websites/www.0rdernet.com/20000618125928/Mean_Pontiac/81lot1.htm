    providing his Poncho with a REAL Pontiac engine when he upgrades to a 400. Modifications
    performed to date include removal of all of the computerized equipment &amp; EPA pollution
    control devices, removal of the computerized carb and installation of a Black Stallion
    4bbl in its place, and removal of the restrictive square muffler in favor of a straight
    pipe one-sided setupthat routes the exhaust from the passenger side of the vehicle to a
    tailpipe on the same side of the car. Dominic has a lot of plans for the car including the
    interior and maybe even a full scale resto. We'll be waiting to see the finished

    <td width="77%" height="161" valign="top" style="text-align: left; vertical-align: text-top">This is Gary Spooner's Ultra badass 454
    Twin-Turbo Trans Am convertible. The engine is a 1976 2 bolt 454 converted to 4 bolt
    mains. The block has been aligned, bored, Rockwell tested and Sonic tested. Its built with
    a forged GM crank, Manley aluminum rods (stock length), Supercharger 7.5.1 pistons,
    balanced, torque plates installed (Sunen machine) rolloer timing chain, Competition cam,
    Weiand intake 8013, and solid engine mounts. 1976 454 120cc chamber heads with Competition
    Cams pushrods, valve springs, retainers and locks, roller rockers, bronze valve guides and
    one-piece valves (2.20 intake &amp; 1.90 exhaust) sit atop the block. A Melling oil pump
    along with a 9qt oil pan, oil cooler and a custom made remote filter housing provide the
    lubrication for the engine. A Brassworks water pump, 180 degree Robertson thermostat and a
    custom built 6 core radiator provide the cooling.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The transmission is a 1983 700R4 rebuilt by RPM Research. A
    complete upgrade was performed on the unit with a 9 disc 3-4 clutch, revised overdrive
    planetary etc., Toni Rossi Gray Thunder series 12&quot; torque converter, turbine and
    impeller blades heli brazed, angled to give a stock stall speed, double torington bearings
    at thrust surfaces 2-4 piston replaced with corvette parts, anti downshift kit for extreme
    speeds, a deep sump pan and a TCI flexplate.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rear axel is a stock GM 8.5 3.08 axle and brakes are 4-wheel
    disc with metallic pads. The suspension is the WS6 suspension with urethane bushings all
    around, ladder bars, big block springs, 5 leaf thickness rear springs, 50 series tires
    mounted on the rear and 60 series tires mounted on the front.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the inside of the car you'll find new carpet, a custom
    manufactured console, 6-point harness, new convertible top, fuel pressure (autometer),
    vacuum boost gauge (autometer), an EGT gauge, controls for the computer and the stock
    gauges.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok ok so what are the numbers you ask? Gary writes: <br>
    <br>
    <strong>&quot;I wanted this car to go in excess of 180 mph. I know it could go in excess
    of that speed easily. The rate of acceleration is awesome for a car that is 4200lbs (after
    mods completed). The exhaust is quite and the engine runs very smooth. In overdrive at
    highway speed of 60 mph engine will generate 20 inches of vacuum. Boost is adjustable,
    min. 3 psi to 15 psi. For normal play I run 8 psi on supreme gas, 4 psi on regular.The 1/4
    mile is scary: I had a companion to time a run, he weighed 213 pounds, I had a problem
    with traction for the first 300ft (to much boost) but I still pulled a high 12s low 13s
    1/4 mile. Other streeters have tried to beat this brute with no luck! The bonus comes at
    the gas pump, impressive fuel mileage for this car. I have had this car since 85 I never
    will let this car out of my grasp. ! I will be doing alot of changes to the engine soon. I
    hope to reduce the exhaust emissions from the engine ther by making the car emissions
    legal also improving the image of the hotrodder in the eyes of the enviromentalist. I am
    researching the use of another type of fuel and reveiwing the mods that must be done to
    the engine.&quot;</strong><br>

bad we can't see the rest of the car. Apparently it has won some awards. Little changed
between the 80' and 81' models. All firebird engines got GM's Computer Command Control
system. This onboard computer controlled all engine functions. Also all firebirds equipped
with automatic transmissions received new computer-controlled-lockup torque converters.
The 4.9L turbo engine option remained the high performance engine option for 1981 models.</p>

    <td width="77%" height="161" valign="top" style="text-align: left; vertical-align: text-top">This ladies and gentleman is truly a
    unique Firebird. It is definitely not your average Pontiac. This 4x4 Formula is owned by
    Chad Hepburn of Ft. McMurray Alberta, Canada. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The engine that motivates this monster is a 79' 454 Chevy block
    that was plucked from a 1 ton truck. Its been bored 0.40 over for a new displacement of
    462c.i. The intake manifold is from a 73' Corvette and the heads are off a 68' Camaro.
    Ignition is provided by the stock HEI unit with an Accel Coil and 8MM plug wires.
    Carburetion is provided by an Edelbrock Performer 750. The transmission mated to the
    engine is a GM Turbo 350 unit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The suspension, which I am sure most of you are interested in, is
    next. In the front you'll find a set od Superlift 6&quot; lifted springs and dual Rancho
    RS5000 shocks at each corner. In the rear a set of custom made (ordered) leaf springs with
    4&quot; blocks are installed along with a single Rancho RS5000 shock on each wheel. The
    transfer case is a New Process 205 Gear driven part time case with slip yoke rear output
    shaft. The axle in front is a GM 10-bolt with wrecked carrier, 8.5&quot; ring gear (hence
    Lincoln Locker) and dual RS5000 steering stabilizers. In the rear is a 14-bolt with a
    10.5&quot; ring gear. It is full floating and an eaton torque biasing posi. Both
    driveshafts were custom made by Chad on a Lathe. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another interesting part of this car is the chassis which had to
    be modified. It is a combination of the original Formula unibody on top of a 79' GMC Jimmy
    frame. Chad tells us about each frame:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;The Jimmy frame remains unmodified, up to the
    extent of a rear shackle inversion kit. With stock springs this would provide about a
    4&quot; lift. I had my dad's friend fabricate it for me after I drew up someplans for it.
    Also all the engine and drivetrain sit in the trucks chassis in the stock locations.&quot;</strong><br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;The Firebird frame however has been pretty mangled.
    The front unibody section has been cut out from the bottom of the firewall to just below
    the battery trays. This will allow me to clear enough room for the engine to fit in, with
    plenty of room to work on things. The front of the car is suported very rigidly (joined to
    the truck frame by way of 2 inch square tubing) and the rear of the front unibody is
    welded directly the the other frame by way of 3&quot; angle iron and other structural
    steel. The rear unibody frame reamains un-mangled but welded to the truck frame. All told
    the car is welded to the truck frame in 8 points.&quot;</strong><br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other modifications performed include the removal of the back
    seat. This was done to cut out a 14&quot; x 3&quot; section just inside of the frame rails
    to allow the car to sit lower on the truck chassis. For those of you that have sharp eyes
    or experience with 4x4s you will notice that this particular Formula has the optional
    T-roof. Its fairly common knowledge among Firebird owners that cars with the T-roof
    installed are less structurally rigid than the hardtops. This has been a concern for Chad.
    A fellow 4x4 enthusiast mentioned he felt the T-bar would crack once the vehicle was taken
    off-road. If anyone can offer any advice on this to Chad on how to fix or avoid this
    problem please feel free to send him an e-mail.<br>

    and had to get rid of the car (poor guy only had the car for about 2000 miles).&nbsp; He
    was asking $6500 (obviously he didn't want to sell it that bad), and after about 3 weeks
    of test drives and talking, I was able to get him down to $5000.&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It had 42K original miles when I got it, right now it has about
    45K.&nbsp; I was leery of it actually having that low of mileage when looking at a
    purchase, but after I took it for a cruise, all doubt went away.&nbsp; Everything was very
    tight, and the engine ran smooth and powerful. Everything is still completely stock with
    the exception of the wheels (I have the originals in storage soon to be refurbished).
    &nbsp; The Engine is a Turbo charged 4.9L (301).&nbsp; I believe the stock HP is rated
    around 220hp - not bone crushing power, but fun.&nbsp; I am going to try a few things to
    get some more juice out of it, but there is only so much you can do with that motor and
    fuel system.&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I save it for sunny weekends and I like to take the T-tops off
    and go for cruise to the beach or something. Its the ride of the car that makes it nice.
    &nbsp; Someday it may get an engine switch, but not until this motor pukes on me.&nbsp; It
    is still running like new, so it would be a shame to ruin the fact that it is still stock.
    The 301 was not exactly the most popular motor Pontiac ever used, and parts are extremely
    difficult to find. The Turbo helps make up for some of the emission laws, and the 301's
    shortcomings, but I wouldn't race everything on the street.&nbsp; If in the future a new
    motor is needed, I have a 350 4-bolt at home that I'd like to build into a 383.&nbsp; I
    have the specs to put it together to produce about 430 HP.&nbsp; I might move up to a big
    block though, we'll see.&nbsp; Hopefully that won't have to be done for a long time, and I
    will have this car for a LONG time.&quot;</strong><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><font size="3">&quot;I bought this car last year at a
Kruse International Auction here in Houston. I had not even seen the car before it went on
the auction block. As the bidding progressed I decided I had to have the car, so I took
the incredible chance of bidding on it unseen. To my surprise, I won the bidding and drove
the car home. That day I must have been one of the luckiest people on Earth. The car was
original, ran great and was almost perfect. Over the course of a few months, I restored
the little things that it needed and all my work paid off. I entered it at a car show here
in Houston last month and my '81 Turbo Trans Am took best in its class.&quot;</font></strong></p>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;When I first saw this t/a in the classifieds I had
    to call because it said that is was in &quot;excellent condition&quot;. So the next day I
    went and saw it sittin in the garage. She was a school teacher and I really don't think
    she knew what kind of classic she had. So I asked her what she wanted for it and her
    response was &quot;You throw me a price&quot;. Right then I KNEW she didn't know what she
    had.First I asked her why the paint was a little faded she said, &quot;I think it's from
    the water sprinkler&quot;. What happened was that it was a hot day and it faded the
    clearcoat but the sides are still shiny. When I bought it from her it had 47,000 original
    miles. But anyways, I threw $3,400 dollars and she said sounds like a good deal. I was so
    excited, because when I was 12 years old my dad always showed me pictures of his 1978
    trans am. Ever since then I'v always wanted a trans-am. A few weeks after the purchase I
    took off the driver and passenger side back seat cover's (because I read from Pontiac
    Magazine that the build sheet were usually located there) sure enough the build sheet was
    there and in tact. That was AWESOME. Also when I purchased the t/a it had the honeycomb
    wheels, replaced them with Proggresive Polished Aluminum rims. I also replaced the
    original 301 engine with the power plant 400 W-72. I also tinted the windows and put a
    $3,200 stereo system in her.&quot;</strong><br>
