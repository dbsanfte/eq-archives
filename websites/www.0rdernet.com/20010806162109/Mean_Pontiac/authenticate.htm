<p align="left"><font color="#800000">So your going out to look at a Lucerne Blue 1972
455HO Trans Am or perhaps a 1988 Formula with the WS6 package and you'd like to go armed
with the knowledge to ensure your getting whats being advertised? Did you just buy that
1968 convertible Firebird you've always wanted and now would like to find out as much as
you can about it? Well follow the steps outlined here and use the information provided in
these pages and it will put you a LONG way toward understanding just what it is you have
and how it was built and optioned. Keep checking back to, as I find more methods for
validating information I will add them here.</font><br>
<br>
<big><u><strong><font color="#800000">STEP 1:</font></strong></u></big><br>
Decode the VIN. This is the Vehicle Identification Number and is found on all Firebirds
from 1967 to 2000. Location as well as decoding information is located with each of the
Year by Year Codes &amp; Figures pages.<br>
<br>
<big><u><strong>STEP 2:</strong></u></big><br>
Decode the data plate. The purpose of each item on the data plate is provided here to help
you understand which codes are what. The codes specific to each year are located with each
of the Year by Year Codes &amp; Figures pages.</p>

<small>A typical data plate</small></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#800000"><strong><big>Line 1: ST 69-00000
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; APL 123456</big></strong><br>
<br>
The two digit code to the right of the ST charachters is the year model of the Firebird,
in this case 1969.<br>
<br>
The next five digits decode the division series and body type. Normally these five digits
should match the first five digits of the VIN and decode the same. However they do not
always match and this is not an immediate cause for alarm. Often the VIN number was used
to specifiy a more generic model type while the data plate was used to identify a more
specific model type. An example of this is seen with 1970 Firebirds. Data plates on
Norwood built Firebirds always contain the base Firebird style even if it was actually
built to be a Formula or Trans Am. To differentiate Norwood added the UPC code
&quot;WS4&quot; to the plate which in that case indentifies a Trans Am. Data plates on Van
Nuys built Firebirds utilized the correct 5-digit code to identify model type, 22887 for a
Trans Am.<br>
<br>
The next three letters define the assembly plant where your Firebird was built. The three
plant codes are as follows:<br>
Lordstown&nbsp; LOR<br>
Van Nuys&nbsp;&nbsp; LOS<br>
Norwood&nbsp;&nbsp; NOR<br>
<br>
The next six digits define a consecutive body number. This number is not significant.<br>
<br>
<strong><big>Line 2: TR 000
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 000
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 00</big><br>
</strong><br>
The first 3 digits are the Trim Code. This defines interior color, seat style and seat
material type.<br>
<br>
The next 3 digits is the Time Built Code. This tells you on what date your car was built.
The format should be two numbers and 1 letter i.e. 06C. This is decoded as follows:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The first two digits define the month: 01 = January, 02 = February, 03 =
March etc....<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The last character defines the week: A = 1st week, B = 2nd week etc...<br>
So our particular example above decodes to 3rd week of June 1969. *Remember the year is
not part of this code its located on line 1! Also note that this code may be located
directly above the year model and body type codes.<br>
<br>
<big><u><strong>STEP 3:</strong></u></big><br>
Visit the year by year Codes &amp; Figures pages listed below to get all the information
about your Firebird:<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
*As they become available they will be listed here.<br>
<br>
<u><strong><big>STEP 4:</big></strong></u><br>
Whether your looking at a particularly rare Firebird and must have absolute proof or you
already own one and just want to obtain a copy of the billing invoice, the last step is to
send $35 to Pontiac Historical Services. They can be reached on the web at <a href="http://www.phs-online.com">www.phs-online.com</a>. The service they provide is
invaluable and well worth it. No other auto manufacturer provides this service, only
Pontiac. For your $35 you'll get an extensive amount of information about the year model
Firebird you own, a copy of the billing invoice, a photo of your year and model Firebird
and several other items of interest. I have used PHS three times and have never been
disappointed. They are an industry standard for true authentication of Pontiacs. Quite
often you will see &quot;PHS documented&quot; in classified ads.</font></p>
