rare 400 H.O. Firebird. Its rare because very few 400 H.O.s were built <strong>without </strong>the
optional Ram Air package that could be had in 69' for an extra $76.88. It was featured in
the October 95' issue of High Performance Pontiac. The ad covered the complete restoration
of the car and rebuild of the original numbers matching 400.<br>

for the photo. This is a nice Firebird and I wouldn't park out in the street like this.
Interesting that the owner chose to leave all the windows up with the top down. Maybe you
half to have owned a convertible to understand. I haven't owned a convertible yet.</p>

cool green Firebird has some after market rims and what looks like maybe some ladder bars
or traction control bars on the rear. Could be air shocks too.</p>

This red convertible looks like its sitting in a showroom somewhere. Probably a
promotional thing to help drum up local business.</p>

good job too, the only reason I'm sure is because I read the information on the car when I
first got this pic. I haven't been able to find it again to bring you the same information
I read. Maybe the owner will see it here and send me an e-mail.</p>

is an interesting frontal shot of an orange Firebird. The paint could be the original
Carousel Red paint that was offered for this year model. Note the aftermarket rims, the
oversize rear tires, the hood locks and some kind of incorrect aftermarket antenna. These
mods are mild compared to the things that were done to these cars were they first came
out.</p>

This Palladium Silver convertible belongs to Chris Philip. The engine is the 400HO rated
at 335hp. This is a rare Firebird but for an unusual reason. Its only 1 of 57 that was
built with the 400HO but without &quot;functional&quot; Ram Air. The car was special
ordered in California by a dealer for his private collection. Its optioned heavily with
power windows, power seat, A/C, power top, AM/FM stereo and a black deluxe interior. Two
of the 57 non Ram Air equipped cars are on this site.<br>
<br>
Chris own several other rare Firebirds including a 1 of 1 factory painted cand apple green
Firebird 400 Grand Marque and a Ram Air I Firebird with 30,000 original miles (see the 68'
Firebirds <a href="68lot3.htm">Lot#3</a>).</p>

A Carousel Red convertible. A lot of changes took place with the Firebird for the 69' year
model. Most noticeably on the front end. The headlights were now encased in fiberglass
panels painted to match the body and the chrome nose was severely reduced in size seeming
to protrude too far forward. Another change seldom noticed was the wheel openings, they
were now flat at the top versus the previous rounder designs. On a different note some
changes and new items would appear on the interior too. Over the shoulder seat belts would
make their first appearance in the Firebird and the dash was an all new design.<br>

photo was sent to me by Chris Batson. He saw it and took this picture while attending a
car show in Watertown, SD. The owner had found the car in a farmers barn with corn growing
up all around it and bought it cheap. The car had been purchased by the farmers son in
69'. Two weeks later the son was off to Vietnam and sadly didn't return. </p>
