This Trans Am Ram Air IV Coupe belongs to Eric Vickers. The RA IV/4-speed car is a rare 1
of 46. The car was originally purchased in in Florida and was brought to Colorado where
the Eric picked it up. It was ordered for performance with stock gauges including the
in-dash tachometer, M-21 4-speed, and a 3:90 rear end. It doesn't have a 4-speed console,
any chrome trim, or rally II rims.The car originally came equipped with
&quot;poverty&quot; caps, which they keep and put on for shows, but they were swapped in
favor of some rally IIs. Its a 100% documented and numbers matching RAIV engine with all
69' upper and lower RAIV pans and 69' Roundport manifolds. The car was driven daily by its
former owner till 1990 who was unaware of its rarity!! The car even has some of its
original paint. Eric also owns a 1970 RAIV Trans Am (see the 70' Firebirds <a href="70lot1.htm">Lot#1</a>) and a 70' GTO Judge. <br>
<br>
Eric's Trans Am was featured in the June 1997 issue of <a href="http://www.cskpub.com/HPPtoc.html">High Performance Pontiac</a>.<br>

ITS A CONVERTIBLE!!! Is it a pic of one of the eight? Well I found this one surfing the
net so sadly I cannot verify whether or not if it is, but at least you know what one of
the eight SHOULD look like and who knows maybe this is one of them. Its a beautiful care
either way. Enjoy.....</p>

    and is powered by one of the legendary RAM AIR Vs. Lance bought th car in 1988 in
    Michigan. The car was disassembled but came with several NOS parts. The TA retains the
    original wide ratio Muncie 4-speed, and 3.55 rear end. The Ram Air TunnelPort was
    installed during the cars 5-year long frame off restoration. The RAV is outfitted with the
    correct crank, rods, pistons, NOS cam/lifters, distributor, valvetrain, and harmonic
    balancer. The block code is &quot;WI&quot;. Lance has been collecting RAV TunnelPort parts
    for 15 years. He even has a set of the extremely rare factory F-Body exhaust manifolds.
    Less than a dozen were made. He also has another complete RAV waiting to be installed in a
    car. Lance also owns a 70' RAIV Orbit Orange Judge and is a subscriber of <strong>The
    GoatFinder</strong>. In fact the car was featured in <strong>The GoatFinder</strong> in
    the March 95' issue.<br>

    established Pony Car but the Camaro had the Z28 and Pontiac needed something to compete.
    John Delorean (the top man at Pontiac at the time) appointed Herb Adams to head the
    project. Instead of totally redesigning the car a decision was made to make improvements
    on the existing Firebird. The project was called &quot;<strong>Pontiac Firebird Sprint
    Turismo</strong>.&quot; Thus the Trans Am was born borrowing the name of the popular road
    racing series at the time. An interesting factoid about the name is that Pontiac had to
    agree to pay the SCCA $5 for every car sold carrying the Trans Am name. </td>

but I'm willing to bet its a firebird dressed up to look like a Trans Am. This is a
popular modification for 69' owners. Besides if all these pics were authentic cars, I'd
have pics of three of the original eight already!! Only the best brought to you by The

a true Ram Air III Trans Am. At first I thought this might be a Firebird
&quot;dressed-up&quot; to look like a Trans Am because of the chrome &quot;Firebird&quot;
emblem located on the front fender. I have since learned that these were installed at the
factory but only very early in the production run. Only 697 of these beautiful cars came
off the assembly lines in 1969. Of those 634 had the Ram Air III installed and a scant 55
(only 9 automatics) received the Ram Air IV powerplant making these cars one of the most
collectable and desirable musclecars on the market.</p>

moonlight really lights up the black tires and throws a sheen over the whole car. A very
aggressive appearance is the result. Everything was functional on these awesome cars. The
hood scoops fed cold air through a foam-sealed air cleaner to the carburetor, the fender
air extractors routed hot air out of the engine compartment and the perfectly functional
rear spoiler provided a huge 100lbs of downforce at 100mph. And you thought it was all
cosmetics!!!</p>
