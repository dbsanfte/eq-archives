    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;The 75 is totally original with the 250 ci straight
    six with 100 hp. It has very little rust and needs a nose and valance. I am in the process
    of restoring the interior then comes the motor and trans. I saw an ad in the local car
    finder called The Carolina Trader that said 75 Firebird 250 6 cyl need trans work $300
    OBO. I went and looked at it and saw that it would be a good original builder. It had a
    set of Corvette Rally rims on it and she wanted $200 for the car and $100 for the rims. My
    dad has a 70 Vette Roadster Convertible so he wanted them. Did I mention that I am only
    13. I am almost 14, my birthday is on the 31st of this month. I have bought several parts
    for the interior and it is turning out nicely. I plan on doing all the interior work
    myself. Anyways so my dad gave the woman $300 and we put it on the trailer. Her dad bought
    the car new and then he gave it to her. So I have all the owner manuals and paper work.
    Then I had to give my dad the $200 so it would be mine. I am also getting a '73 Trans Am
    that we traded an old rustey van for. It is all original except for the front clip which
    is a 75 trans am clip. Anyways here are the three pics of the 75 and I have about 30 so if
    you want any more let me know. I love your web page.&quot;</strong><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;Here are a few pictures of my '79 Special Edition
    T/A. I traded a rusted out '71 Firebird Esprit and $500 cash for this car. It was, at one
    time, in a bad flood and then left to dry in the sun. All of the interior will have to be
    replaced with the exception of some small trim pieces. Someone had also tried to repaint
    it with some very bad paint as it has cracked and checked everywhere. This car is being
    rebuilt on an EXTREME budget, so if anyone has any donor parts or very cheap parts, I
    would be truly greatful. I will send you more pictures as it progresses. Pictures #1 &amp;
    #2 are of what it looked like the first day i saw the car (not shown). The rest are of
    what I have torn it down to so far this past weekend. If you look real close in #2, you
    can see the gold steering wheel. Also, the ring around the fuel gauge is missing and under
    it was the original gold plating. The shifter button is also gold as well as the window
    crank hole insert emblems. I have also found remnants of the original gold stripes. Right
    now, the only things that have been done since the pics is the removal of the sub-frame
    and rear axle and gas tank everything that can be unbolted has been taken off. I have
    started on some body work, but it is slow going.. I will keep you poseted as things
    progress. You have an OUTSTANDING web site. It was one of the first I had found when I
    started looking for info on these cars. My first firebird was a '71 esprit that I hauled
    all the way from South Carolina but it was too rusty to do much with. It had excellent
    interior parts, so I ended up trading it to the guy I got my 79 SE from.&quot;</strong></td>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;Attached are pictures of my pride and joy. Although
    she may not look like much it is my first car and I will have it forever. I bought the '68
    bird when I was 16 with hard earned paper route money. It came with a pretty beat 350
    (pontiac of course) with a two barrel. Originally a powerglide car someone had swapped in
    a TH400 two years before I bought it. At 16 I had only 1 engine rebuild under my belt, and
    that was a 2.0 ford out of a pinto in autoshop! I built the motor on earnings from paper
    routes and small jobs. I live in California so it had to pass smog and I was building it
    on a budget. The block went thru all the machine work, including bore to .030, align hone,
    decking etc. The stock crank was ground .010 under and the heads were decked and had
    hardned valve seats installed. The stock rods were reconditioned with new hardware and
    then attached to new cast pistons with moly rings (I was on a budget, remember). A Comp
    Cams 268 cam with .454 lift bumps the valves thru Erson lifters, stock push rods and Crane
    lifters. On top an Edelbrock performer intake handles the air and fuel from the 600 cfm
    performer carb. Headers dump the fumes out two and a quarter stainless exhuast and through
    two chamber flows out the stock location. <br>
    After I finished the engine I did the suspension with energy suspnsion rubber all around
    and between the body and subframe, the front coils are stock with KYB shocks and a 1&quot;
    sway bar. The rear is relatively stock save for KYBs and rebuilt leafs. The wheels were on
    the car when I got it and I have spent countless hours getting them to shine like they do.
    The body pretty much looks like it did the day I bought it. <br>
    The first motor shot is from right before I pulled the engine, the second is after it
    passed smog (before it was exempt), the air cleaner is off my buddies '78 buick that he
    was going to donate to charity, and the last is the most current with a chrome Pontiac air
    cleaner and a K&amp;N. The car shots are from the day I brought it home, and then the
    other two are recent and are what it looks like currently.<br>
    I have had the car almost five years now, but have driven it daily for about four. The
    body work will get done the christmas break (I am a student at San Jose State University)
    and hopefully paint will happen in the spring or summer when the weather warms up. Anyway,
    I am sending you this info BECUASE I am very proud of my car and what it has taught me.
    You can pick and choose from the info at will to post. I would like it though if you could
    put in a thank you to all my freinds who have laid a hand on this car, including James,
    Art, Nick, Ben, Kurt and everyone else (they know who they are). Thank you very much.

    project. My name is Mike Fisher and I'm from Chicago, Illinois. This one has spent the
    last 20 years sitting in many different garages. The last ten in ones belonging to
    personal friends. No one has completed it yet but I am determined. The original 400 motor
    was removed by the first of several with good intentions and is long gone. It was replaced
    with a 428, which was rebuilt about 8 years ago and never made it back into the car.
    Another item I will make right. I will update you as things progress.&quot;</strong><br>

    the woods at a local carlot back in 1998. It had $350 cash on it, but $275 and it was

    interior was shot, it didn't run, and the . The console and dash were good, however. A new
    starter, carb, fuel lines, and a tune up and it came to life. I've been doing a budget
    resto because I'm a college student and I've got other projects, but it's getting done. A
