    has browsed this site and found there car displayed among its pages. They contact me and I
    am able to give the car an identity of sorts. I love it every time it happens. Such was
    the case with Paul and Susan Cooper's Firebird displayed here! Paul writes:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><font size="3">&quot;Susan bought it in September 1979.
    The picture was taken in '96 at the Pacific Performance Pontiac Car Club's All Pontiac
    Show and Shine in Richmond B.C.. We got first place in the Firebird class. The color is
    &quot;Ultra Violet Metallic&quot; and changes through a range from grey, to silver, to a
    vivid violet depending on how much sunlight is on it. The pin striping is a shade between
    mulberry and hot pink The chrome Ralley II wheels were made for us by Specialty Wheels of
    Sandy, Oregon. The drive train is the original 400 cid, 4-speed, with 3:08 posi and
    4-piston front disc brakes.&nbsp; Other features include black deluxe interior, black top,
    rally guage cluster, and hood tach.&nbsp; Thanks again for a great website. We have you

purchased by his father in 1968 during his senior year at the Naval Academy. Money was
tight but the car was ordered with the 265hp 350c.i. engine. It came off the lot painted a
deep metallic green with a black interior and redline tires on Rally II rims. The car
would go on to serve as his families main source of transportation till 1976 only
suffering a minor accident in 73' that resulted in the replacement of the passenger side
door. Afterwards it was relegated to collecting dust until Stewart turned 16. He learned
to drive in this car and was soon using it for his own transportation. He drove it
throughout high school till he graduated. The year of his graduation he decided to restore
it to original condition. During the rebuild the 350 mill was bored .030&quot; over, a
500cfm Holley 2bbl was added, and the original factory single exhaust was replaced with a
dual exhaust. Shifting is performed with the original Munice M-21 4-speed with a Hurst
shifter. Currently the car is undergoing another more serious restoration. <br>

Stewart hosts his own homepage called <a href="http://ecehp2.ncsu.edu/stew/index.html">Stew's
Home</a>. Stop by if you'd like to find out more about his car restoration.<br>

as a Ram Air I with a code WI 335 hp 400c.i. and a functional hood scoop. It is originally
a standard 400c.i. 4-speed car built at the Texas plant. A 3.90 is the rear end of choice
for this bird. The interior is black as is the convertible top. Its optioned well with a
console, power steering, power disc brakes, full gauge set including the factory hood
tach, an AM/FM radio, air conditiong, the deluxe steering wheel, and a collapsible spare
tire.<br>
<br>
This particular car is Michael's &quot;driver&quot;.Besides the Firebirds below he also
owns a 1 of 1 92' Firehawk (see the 92' Firebirds <a href="92lot2.htm">Lot#2</a>).</p>

    <td width="77%" height="161" valign="top" style="text-align: left; vertical-align: text-top">This white gem is another of Michael
    Wempe's Firebirds. Unlike the one above this one is a fully documented Ram Air I coupe
    with the 335hp XN 400c.i. block and the functional hood. Its also equipped with a turbo
    hydramatic 400. A 3.90 rear, ride and handling package, and Rally II wheels round out the
    mechanicals. The interior is red and interestingly enough came with the radio deleted. The
    car had been in storage for 17 years in New York!! <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car had originally been ordered by Pieler Pontiac to be raced
    and the first weekend they had it out, they destroyed the automatic transmission in it. So
    a 4-speed Muncie was installed but the speedometer cable was too short to be connected so
    it was left unattached to the tranny and the car was ran without it.&nbsp;The odometer
    read 24 miles on it when Michael bought it and it now reads 74. The owner estimated the
    car actually had around 5,000 miles on it at the time of purchase. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After purchasing it Michael had it completely restored including
    the installation of a correct Turbo Hydramatic 400 automatic transmission. The original
    paint was also replaced but the car retains all its original sheetmetal. Everything else
    that was either worn or weathered was replaced and the car now sits as new.

    <td width="77%" height="161" valign="top" style="text-align: left; vertical-align: text-top">This is the third installment in the
    Michael Wempe 68' Firebird collection and I HAVE saved the best for last. A true Firebird
    connoisseur will recognize the rare combinations that are not always apparent to the naked
    eye. The Ram Air option was introduced in 1967 and carried over to 1968. This option
    included a 400 with 5 more horsepower and a hood with functional scoops. This was the Ram
    Air I option. Late in the model year the Ram Air II was released. This version featured a
    virtually all new powerplant sporting such heavy duty items as four-bolt main bearings,
    special manifolds, forged pistons, a forged crankshaft, revised cylinder heads with round
    port exhausts, a higher lift cam and a new horsepower rating of 340 horsepower. Because of
    the late model introduction only 110 firebirds received the new Ram Air option. Of those
    only 8 were convertibles. This is one of them. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fully documented Ram Air II
    convertible. The paint is Starlight black and is accented by a black custom interior and a
    black top. Like most of the Ram Air equipped cars it also features a 4-speed and a 3.90
    rear. The options are a Delco AM/FM&nbsp; Radio, Rally gauges with the optional hood
    mounted tachometer, a console, Rally II wheels with redline tires, and a custom wood
    steering wheel. Something interesting about the car is that Michael is its ninth owner and
    it has never left the same town. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
