1976 would be a landmark year for the Trans Am and Pontiac. Firebird sales topped six
figures for the first time ever at 110,775. This was the last year you could get a 455
from Pontiac and it would be the first time the Trans Am topped the Corvette in sales.
Production of the 455 however was high due in part to the popularity of the Firebird. A
total of 7,099 base Trans Ams were built with the once powerful mill and another 429 found
their way into the T-Top and Non T-Top Limited Edition TAs. If your looking for a low buck
high performance Trans Am a 76' with the 455 is an excellent choice. The base hp rating of
200 is low but can easily be boosted with minor upgrades that aren't too costly. <br>

The 50th Anniversary Trans Am was outfitted with a completely unique decal set. First was
the 50th Anniversary badge (<a href="Auto%20related%20gifs/50THDECAL.JPG">seen here</a>),
a mile of gold pinstriping applied liberally, and finally all the Trans Am lettering was a
unique design. This special Trans Am also received gold bird stickers on the sail panel
rather than the standard metal bird emblem. The honeycomb wheels you see here were a $103
option and the gold colored sets were only available on these cars.</p>

    car was originally an Esprit when she bought it in 1994. It was a 350 2-bbl car and pretty
    dull. The 350 was swapped for a 400 4-bbl motor and a set of 3:42 gears were installed in
    the rear for added pep. A trunk spoiler and formula hood were added next to provide a
    sportier appearance. Despite its current performance and appearance Danielle has a few
    mods planned for it for the future. Dual exhaust, a posi-trac rear and some wider tires
    are on the wish list. This car is her daily driver.&nbsp; </td>

    It isn't everyday you see a Trans Am with a tilt front end. Mel writes:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;This red 76', with the tilt front end, was a
    wrecked 455 S.E. 4-speed .&nbsp; I had never seen a tilt front end on an F-body that was
    made from the original steel panels, so I customized my own.&nbsp; The engine was bored
    0.30 over with all TRW aluminum internal pieces installed.&nbsp; The dual double pumper
    650 Holly's were mounted on an Offenhauser reworked Predator intake.&nbsp; With 3.73's in
    the rear and slicks on, the car would run in the lower 12's.&nbsp; The really fun thing
    with this car was since it had such a light front end from the reworked tilting, It would
    pull the wheels with very little effort.&nbsp; I could take this car up to about 4800 rpms
    and dump the clutch and you felt like you were in a space shuttle taking off.&nbsp; Sold
    the car in 1984 1 month after it was finished at the Car Craft Nationals that were held in
    Springfield, IL.&quot;</strong><br>

    This Formula is owned by Michael Porter. Michael is currently stationed in Germany with
    the military. Unfortunately the Formula is still here in the states. He's the original
    owner having bought it in May of 1976. Its completely original except for the 400ci engine
    which Michael installed to upgrade from the factory installed 350.</td>
