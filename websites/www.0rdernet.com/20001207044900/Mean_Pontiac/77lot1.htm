    by David Pasquellini. Its got the standard black interior, black chrome exhaust, the gold
    brushed aluminum instrument panel, T-Tops, the Olds 403 6.6L with an automatic
    transmission, and the gold snowflake wheels. Incredibly the car was bought for a mere
    $1,000. According to David the car is only in need of minor work.<br>
    <br>

When he bought the car it was a primered rust color, and the engine blew within a thousand
miles of use. The fender spoilers or flares had been removed by the owner and tossed into
a raven and said owner traded the original snowflake wheels for a set of aftermarket
Keystones which he put on his charger. So an engine rebuild was in order. According to
Michael virtually everything but the block, intake and alternator were replaced. The car
now has a 400c.i. engine bored .030, a .282 cam from Summit, TRW pistons, and factory
aluminum valve covers. Power is applied to the wheels via a Turbo 400 with a stage 2
shift-kit, and a 2.43 rear end. The car itself is painted 91' Corvette Blue and is
equipped with power windows, power steering, power brakes, power door-locks, A/C, power
trunk, rear defrost, tilt wheel, and cruise control. <br>

year model. They were still located in the forward area of the hood but were now recessed,
smaller, flatter, more square and non-functional. Notice the gold accents applied to the
scoops, the grilles and the lower half of the car. Notice the Rally IIs are also painted
to match the body color. This package was applied only to the Formula and was designated
by option code W50. </p>

This diagram was provided to me by Phil Pollard. Its a graphical representation of how the
Formula hood evolved from 1969 to 1981. A recent discussion about which hood was correct
for what year model on the Pontiac E-Mail List proved that several people were somewhat
confused as to which hood WAS appropriate for what year. As a result Phil drew up this
diagram and forwarded it to me to display for you. Thanks Phil...<br>

Am. The 77' year model saw the end of single headlights for second generation TAs. It also
saw the end of a shaker scoop that was either functional or could be easily modified to be
functional. The shaker scoop was made of fiberglass and was completely sealed. The only
option you had to make it functional was to cut holes in the fiberglass. I have seen all
kinds of modifications to these scoops. One such mod is&nbsp; to drill small holes into
the area where the scoop should have been open, to allow for increased airflow. On yet
other scoops I have seen the entire area cut out. </p>

years to ge the cool LED ZEPP liscense plates. He was recently made an offer he couldn't
refuse and sold the car. He has however recently purchased a 74' Trans Am that is in the
middle of a restoration. You can check it out on the <a href="projlot1.htm">Project

Crawford is Director of the Bandit Trans Am Club and webmaster of the Bandit Trans Am Home
Page. The club is dedicated to the 1976 - 1981 Special Edition Trans Am. If you own one or
are a fan and haven't been by this site it is definitely a must see.<br>

makes this car unique is that it was specially ordered with the white custom vinyl
interior. The original owner still owns the car and according to the President of the
Bandit Trans Am club, it is the only one known to exist with such an interior.<br>

been in favor of originality when it comes to TAs, since so many of them were modified in
the 70s and 80s with every aftermarket part on the market, but hey whatever makes you
happy. It looks as if the owner takes a lot of interest in the car.</p>

be owned by Chris Paveglio. It was sold to help pay for the 93' Trans Am he owns now (see
93' Firebirds <a href="93lot1.htm">Lot#1</a>). Chris writes:<br>
<br>
&quot;<strong>My 77 was owned by 3 people before me, and they took very good care of it
for 15 years. It needed little &quot;restoration&quot; to keep it looking nice and
performing well. It is a 400/4sp Hurst/all power options/ deluxe interior. When I sold it,
the odo read 130,000 miles, of which I put about 50k. Major additions to it were: polished
and clearcoated the wheels, add 255/60/15 Goodyear GT+4 tires (white letter), Dynomax
exhaust, had interior re-upholstered, installed CD player where radio was, tape deck where
8-track was, all with &quot;stealth&quot; covers, so when not in use, it looked stock
(I'll try to get some pix on this), 6x9 Eclipse speakers in rear, RockfordFosgate amp,
Boston Acoustic component speakers in factory positions (in dash, and replaced bird emblem
on door with tweeters).&nbsp; New frame rail due to rust, new fender and rear bumper due
to other careless drivers. Overall this is an extremely well-kept car, with few mechanical
problems. Everyone who saw it loved it (if not the color), and IT COOKS! The big 400 never
let me down when I needed speed. I have even put a couple 89 Formula Firebirds in their
place! Overall, it was a joy to have and drive.&quot;</strong></p>
