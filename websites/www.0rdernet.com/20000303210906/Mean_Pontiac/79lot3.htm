    <td width="77%" height="161" valign="top" style="text-align: left; vertical-align: text-top">This is truly an exciting addition to
    the Firebird Gallery. The first 2nd generation convertible Trans Am (not a production
    first just the first to be added to this site). These are very rare TAs and this one is in
    beautiful shape. They were never produced this way from the factory. Instead completed
    cars were delivered to conversion companies for the very expensive modifications required
    to make it a convertible. I believe completed versions carried a price tag in the
    neighborhood of $30,000 which is expensive even by todays standards. Its owned by Michael
    Hall. Michael writes: <br>

1979 was the ten year anniversary of the Trans Am. To celebrate this milestone Pontiac
introduced this car to the public. It came with a special silver and grey paint job and
10th Anniversary badges along with the standard Trans Am decals, special &quot;turbo&quot;
rims that were available only on this car, a super unique silver interior with embroidered
&quot;screaming chickens&quot; in the seats made of a special leather material that was
manufactured specifically for this car, T-Tops, all the creature comforts you could pack
into a TA and even a 400ci engine. These cars are fairly collectable and can still be had
for reasonable prices. </p>

Firebird. Apparently the public welcomed all the design changes incorporated into the new
Firebird with a total sales of 211,454. Interestingly 79' was the first year a 4-barrel
version of the V-6 was offered in the Firebird, along with the usual 2-barrel version.
This particular Formula as well as the one below show that, despite the physical change in
appearance, the special W50 Formula Appearance Package, was still available. <br>

resided in the engine compartment the Formula still received some performance options
which included a heavy-duty suspension and four-wheel power disc brakes which were also
part of the WS6 Special Performance Package. The Trans Am rear spoiler, however, changed
from a standard feature to an option.&nbsp; <br>

Olds engine and the 6.6L Pontiac motor were available with the Anniversary edition Trans
Am. The Olds mill was rated at a hefty 220hp while the Poncho engine output 185hp. The
special 15x8 Turbo Aluminum wheels that were installed on these cars was manufactured by
the Appliance Wheel Company. <br>

still available in 79' it was an option. The Olds 403 was the standard powerplant for this
year model Trans Am. If you opted for the W72 400 you got an M-21 4-speed to go with it.
This was the only transmission available with the 400. The red offered in 79' was called
Mayan Red, although I can't say for sure if this car is the correct color or some other
red. <br>

in some kind of promotional advertisement or at least was meant for that purpose. I have
always felt the orange decal combined with white paint was the least attractive of the
available color combinations. I'm sure some of you might disagree...<br>

    pictures but this is just the kind of thing I like to display for Firebird fans to see.
    The cars (yes there are two different ones: note the hood decals) at the right are 1979
    Trans Ams that were special customized by the famous George Barris. He's a famous
    customizer known for such vehicles as the original Batmobile. The first TA depicted was
    built for John Travolta (bet you couldn't tell). The other one was built for the famous
    70s Fabian movie &quot;Disco Fever&quot;. Both cars were built the same sans the decals.
    Each received a whale-tail spoiler, fiberglass fender pontoons with cooling scoops,&nbsp;
    Recaro seats, Western Wheels, and a 455c.i. engine. The paint was multi-toned Pearl White
    with Flat Black striping.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hopefully I can acquire some color pics of these cars in the
    future. For those of you that may be interested a plastic model kit of the Travolta
    Firebird was manufactured by Revell. I recently acquired one of these models and am
    offering it for sale. You can see the model at Models <a href="modslot05.htm">Lot#5</a> . <br>

    Anniversary T/A belongs to Bryan Lopez, a Naval officer stationed in California.&nbsp;
    Bryan bought the car from his brother who had <font color="#000000">acquired </font>it
    through a collector in Oregon a few years back.&nbsp; When it was picked up in Oregon, it
    had 11,716 original miles, but has since accumulated an additional 30,000 due to daily
    driving. The car is an original 403 Olds/automatic combination, and other than minor
    preventive maintenance has undergone no major mechanical repairs.&nbsp;Like all 10th
    T/A's, the car has four wheel disc brakes and the WS6 suspension option. After Bryan
    bought the car, he installed a set of '85 Z-28 reclining buckets and a Pioneer
    AM/FM/Cassette head unit that drives a 6 disc CD changer.&nbsp; While Bryan likes to stick
    to originality, he is a believer in resto-modification and is investigating the
    possibility of swapping out his 180 hp 403 for a late model 245 hp LT-1/six
    speed.&nbsp;He's interested in hearing from anyone who has performed a similar swap into a
    2nd gen Firebird or T/A.<br>
    <br>
    Bryan has started a registry for owners of 10th Anniversary Trans Ams on the internet.
