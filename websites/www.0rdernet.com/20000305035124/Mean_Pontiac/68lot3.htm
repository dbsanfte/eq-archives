A green convertible with Rally IIs a black top and a black interior. A not of interest is
that the number of Firebirds sold in 1968 was not surpassed until the 1976 model year. A
testament to the original styling presented by the PMD team.</p>

seat. Interestingly the car had manual brakes installed. The color is two-tone Meridian
Turquoise with a Cameo Ivory top. The car is completely original. <br>

    beautiful and ultra rare 1 of 12 RAI convertible Firebird. Joseph writes:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><font size="3">&quot;I recently had the good fortune of
    being able to buy a rather rare First Generation Firebird, a 1968 Ram Air Firebird
    Convertible. According to Fred Simmonds, a retired and well-respected Pontiac Motor
    Division employee who did some 'Ram Air accounting' back in the late 80's, only 12 Ram Air
    convertibles (both RA I and RA II) were built in 1968. This example is a RA I. The Ram Air
    cars were ultra exotic BUT could be ordered by anyone willing to check off the $616 option
    (a lot back then!). Ram Air cars were factory built race cars, plain and simple. They came
    with 3.90 Safe-T-Track rear ends (hardly highway drivers!), heavy duty 4speeds or 3-speed
    Turbo Hydromatic transmissions, functional Ram Air induction (that actually worked!),
    better flowing heads with polished valves, stronger valve springs, factory built
    'longbranch' factory headers and heavy duty oiling (these cars could easily rev up to
    6000rpms). These cars were jokingly rated at 335Hp and 430ftlb in the firebird, but the
    same exact motor in the GTO was 360HP 445ftlb (Can you say insurance rating game??). RA I
    motors have been dyno-ed and reality is closer to the 380-400 gross Hp range. Anyway since
    the convertibles weigh approximately 250 lbs. more than a coupe and the RA option wasn't
    cheap VERY few RA convertibles were made making them incredibly rare today. (Remarkably
    though, 6 of the 12 1968 RA convertibles have re-surfaced at the time of writing!) As far
    as the history of my RA, I am the third owner. Both previous owners lived in Mansfield, PA
    and kept VERY nice care of this rare bird. The car has 56,600 documented miles and is in
    fabulous condition. All the sheetmetal is original, and both owners tell me the car has
    NEVER seen snow and only rain a handful of times. Well not sure how to document that but I
    can tell you that the car has no evidence of rust anywhere! The original speckled paint in
    the trunk is still evident and in excellent condition while the original verdoro green
    paint is still on the underside of the trunk decklid. I even have the original floor mats,
    'regular 400' hood scoop inserts and chrome air cleaner. Note: All RA cars had the dealers
    install the open hood scoops and ram air induction setup (which was sent from the factory
    to the dealer in the trunk!). The car currently has its original RA induction system.
    (Most 1967-69 ram air cars that turn up today have lost this setup somewhere along the 30+
    year journeys) The car was repainted once in late 1996 its original verdoro green and the
    original top was replaced in 1998 (April gold-not easy to find!). While it may be hard to
    believe, the Ram Air option is probably NOT the rarest option on this car. This bird was
    also equipped with the super rare saddle trim, a.k.a. LEATHER interior! This was a
    mid-year option and the car had to wait around the factory ~6weeks to get it! That fact
    may help explain another oddity regarding this car. It has a prototype/factory installed
    (test?) rear suspension on it. The setup is bizarre. I read an article dated in 1967 that
    stated Pontiac was planning on going to a new 'dual shock set-up' in 1968 which was in
    addition to the staggered shock set-up all 1968s eventually did receive. This car has two
    shocks specially mounted on the driver side rear along with the single standard shock on
    the passenger side. The car also sits lower in the rear which is presumably for improved
    traction for '1/4 mile launches'. I wish I had a photo of the undercarriage to send you. I
    will try to get one soon. Incidentally, the leather was just replaced and is identical in
    color, pattern and appearance to the original. The car does need some minor final
    detailing (engine detailing, minor repair of the driver side 'faux leather door panel',
    minor repair of the tan deluxe wheel, plus some other small items). I plan on working on
    the detailing soon. Oh yes one final thing I'd like to do is seeing how she'll do in the
    1/4 mile! Yes its a super rare and low mile car BUT it was built to race (at least
    occasionally right)?? :&gt; According to the two previous owners the car was NEVER run at
    the track (A shame...) Anyway the car has been sitting in a heated garage and has not run
    much over the past 5 years. With that in mind I've spent the last month or so tuning and
    tweaking the car, replacing all the fluids and generally 'cleaning out the cobwebs' so to
    speak. Currently its running VERY strong and hooks up extremely well (probably in large
    part due to the factory dual shock setup). In any event, the car is pretty much 1/4 mile
    ready and I know I'm really looking forward to seeing what it can do. I'll let you know
    how it runs once I get it to the track.&quot;</font></strong><font SIZE="2"><p></font><font size="3"><strong>Take care and thanks for your time,<br>
