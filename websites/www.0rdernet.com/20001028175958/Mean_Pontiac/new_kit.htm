    <td width="60%">Few and far between is a relevant description when attempting to describe
    these kits. According to my current research:<br>
    <br>
    <strong>AMT: </strong>Before they merged with ERTL, AMT released four kits modeled after
    the 1968 Firebird. Of these only one is 1/25 scale and that is the Famous and highly
    collectable &quot;Tin Indian&quot; Firebird. All others were 1/43 scale. All were retailed
    during the late '60s.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Revell: </strong>Before they merged with Monogram they offered three 1/32 scale
    '67 kits, and one 1/32 scale '68 kit. All were retailed during the late '60s. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>MPC: </strong>Before they were bought out by ERTL, offered a very nice 1/25 scale
    kit of a '67 Firebird with the clear glass hood and a simliar 1/25 scale kit of the '68
    Firebird. They also offered a highly customized '68 Firebird George Barris creation dubbed
    the &quot;Super Teen Firebird&quot; which was produced for a movie of the time. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Palmer Plastics: </strong>Offered one '68 Firebird kit. Scale is not advertised on
    the box but I believe it was close to 1/25, maybe 1/43. This company has long been defunct
    and the kit was a terrible one. You could count the number of pieces to assemble on your
    hands.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Summary: </strong>From the information above its plain to see that only one '67
    kit (MPC) and two '68 kits (AMT &amp; MPC) are out there that would interest the average
    builder. Unfortunately the same information conspires to make these kits very hard to find
    and extremely expensive to purchase because of their collectability.</td>

    <td width="60%"><font size="3">Over the last few months I have been working with a resin
    casting company and I am extremely happy to tell you that I will be offering a brand new
    1/25 scale kit of the 1967 Firebird beginning in mid-December. For those of you that have
    never dealt with resin castings before, producing a new kit is a two step process:<br>
    <br>
    1) A donor kit must be identified that can supplement the resin kit to provide all the
    necessary pieces to build a complete kit.<p>2) Research is performed to determine what
    pieces actually need to be &quot;re-cast&quot; in order to provide the desired end
    product. A test casting is manufactured and reviewed for technical accuracy and product
    quality. The kit is put into production.</p>
    <p>What does all this mean to you? The resin kit is not a complete kit. Another kit, in
    this case AMT/ERTL's '69 Firebird 400 kit or AMT/ERTL's '69 Trans Am kit which is cheap
    and readily available, must be used to provide all the pieces that would not be different
    but are needed to complete the kit i.e. tires, windshield, engine, etc... This way the
    entire kit does not have to be recast saving lots of $$$. Currently this resin kit is
    projected to provide the following items unique to the '67:<br>
    <br>
    1) Body<br>
    2) Front bumper assembly<br>
    3) Front grille <br>
    4) Rear bumper<br>
    5) Dash assembly<br>
    6) Steering wheel<br>
    7) Bucket seats<br>
    8) Base Interior<br>
    <br>
    I have reviewed a test cast for technical accuracy and recommended modifications and I
    have to tell you it looks great!! The body is superb. All pieces exhibit a level of detail
    consistent with what you would find in a 1/25 scale kit today!!</font></td>

    <td width="60%"><font size="3">The current projection is to begin selling the 1967 kit
    around mid-December. At this time only the hardtop will be offered but a convertible
    version of each is being considered. For delivery to the customer I plan to offer both the
    resin kit alone which will allow you to pursue a donor kit on your own and a &quot;total
    package&quot; kit that will include the resin kit and the donor kit packaged together and
    ready to assemble. </font></td>

    <td>I finally have some good information on dates of availability for both kits:<ul>
      <li>The '67 kit is finished and ready to be manufactured. I have done a buildup with one of
        the kits and experienced no significant problems. I hope to add pictures of the kit before
        and after the build here shortly. I tried taking pics of just the pieces twice and my lack
        of photography skills have produced less than desirable images. After the second attempt I
        began building the test kit so there won't be a third. I may post an image or two and
        still plan to post images of the finished product.</li>
      <li>I have placed the first order and I should have them by mid-December. Price just for the
        resin kit will be $40. Price for the &quot;total package&quot; kit will vary depending on
        the cost of the donor kit and will be communicated to the buyer at time of sale. If I can
        standardize this price I will. </li>
      <li>As for the '68 kit their is good news and bad news. The bad news is that my plans to
        produce one have been scrapped. The good news is that I made that decision because one of
        the major model manufacturers has announced they will be releasing a '68 kit in 2001. Of
        course these kits will be available for purchase here and as I find out more information
        on this kit I'll publish it here. </li>

    purchasing one please send me an e-mail to let me know as early as possible, I have been
    taking reservations for about two months now and have a good sized list already. Be sure
