    <td width="77%" height="161" valign="top" style="text-align: left; vertical-align: text-top">This Official Pace Car Edition WS6
    Trans Am is owned by Juette Bingham. The 5.7L LT1 pumps out 305 horsepower thanks to the
    Ram Air induction system installed as part of the WS6 Performance &amp; Handling Package.
    It comes optioned with a leather interior, 10-speaker stereo system, and remote keyless
    entry. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This particular car has a rather interesting and unique history.
    It was originally a prize at the Grand Casino in Biloxi, Mississippi. The person who
    eventually won the car chose a cash option (&quot;foolishly&quot; according to Juette)
    instead of the car. After this it eventually ended up on one of the Pontiac dealerships on
    the Gulf coast. Juette writes:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;The first time that I went to try to purchase the
    car, the dealership attempted to rob me without a gun. Three weeks later they called me
    and told me that they were willing to accept my offer of $1000.00 over dealer cost. I
    couldn't believe it! And that is how I wound up with this beautiful machine.&quot;</strong><br>

a rock. The base Firebird got an new engine for the 96' model year. The 3.8L 3800L Series
II V-6 was now the standard rated at 200hp. This was as much or more than some of the 5.0L
and 5.7L V-8s of the 80s and 90s. </p>

T-Top Formula. Some of the new options that could be had on a 96' model Firebird included
a theft deterrent system, a new exterior color called Red-Orange Metallic, a new interior
color called Taupe, and a power antenna. The W68 Sport Appearance Package was also offered
on Firebirds and Firebird convertibles including a ground effects package, fog lamps, and
a dual outlet exhaust system.</p>

T-Top Formula with the WS6 package installed. 1996 saw the reintroduction of the WS6
Performance &amp; Handling Package which hadn't been available since the 1990 models. The
new package was available on both Formulas and Trans Ams. Even more exciting about the
advent of this new package was that the legendary Ram Air setup was also brought back as
one of its features. A special dual-inlet hood was installed on cars providing forced air
induction into the engine. The result was a horspower increase from 285hp to 305hp. This
was the first time Pontiac fans had seen horsepower ratings over 300 since the early 73'
SD455s which were rated at 310hp. </p>

The WS6 Trans Am decked out in red. Interestingly enough Trans Am sales dropped in 1996
even though the new Ram Air WS6 package was now available and horsepower ratings were at a
new high. Over 12,000 units were sold in 1995 and that number dropped to just over 9,000.
Substantial price increases due to these new packages was probably the biggest factor. </p>

the new WS6 package included several suspension upgrades including firmer springs, shocks,
and bushings. Larger sway bars were also installed; 32mm up front and 19mm in the rear.
WS6 cars alos got exclusive 17&quot;x8&quot; 5-spoke aluminum rims with P275/40ZR17
mounted on them.</p>

    Eric Cerney. Eric only recently sold it to finance a 1998 Trans Am (see the 98' Firebirds <a href="98lot1.htm">Lot#1</a>). This car had been modified a little and posted a best time
    14.147 @ 97.97mph before it was sold. Factory options included a performance axle,
    graphite leather, GSCs, steering wheel controls, the 10 speaker CD high output stereo
    system, and remote keyless entry. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The modifications that have been
    performed include, relocating the IAT, installation of a TB coolant bypass, new pulleys,
    Flowmaster mufflers, ST swaybars, a Herb Adams adjustable panhard rod with spherical end
    links, performace custom control arms, Eibach springs, Blisten shocks, an LG air kit, a
    TransGo shift kit, a set of Enkei &quot;WIN&quot; 17&quot;x9.5&quot; wheels, a set of BFG
    275/40ZR17 Comp T/As, Ram Air exhaust tips, and Mobil1 synthetic oil and lubricants
    throughout the drive train.<br>
