<b><font size="6">Second Generation 1970 to 1980<br>

</font></b>The second generation Firebird promos were introduced along with the real car
in 1970 and continued through 1980. Colors were again limited to two or three per year.
The Formula 400 was chosen as the model for the promo and continued through 1976. Starting
in 1977 the Trans Am became the model picked to represent the promo and continued through
1980. The 1974 model would be the last factory assembled second-generation Firebird promo
made. From 1975 through 1980 all Firebird promos were unassembled promos called
&quot;Promo Kit&quot;. There were no 1981 Firebird promos made. The second generation is
considered a good starting point for those getting started collecting Firebird promos.
They are generally easier to find than the first generation models and are valued from
around $35.00 for the 1976-1980 cars to $150.00 to $175.00 for the early 1970&#146;s cars.
These prices represent cars in near mint to mint condition. The following is a detailed
look at the second-generation 1970-80 Firebird promos.</p>

    Coupe </b>&#150; &nbsp;Colors known to exist: Castellian Metallic and Lucerne Blue. It was
    a Formula 400 with twin hood scoops, whitewall or blackwall tires, Rally II wheels and a
    blacked out grill. A small molded bird emblem adorns the front bumper. The 1970 model is
    the only second generation Firebird known to come with either &quot;black-wall&quot; or
    &quot;white-wall&quot; tires. The interior was correct in appearance with low back bucket
    seats, headrest, formula steering wheel and automatic transmission shift lever. An
    interesting detail on the chassis is the use of twin resonators ahead of the rear axle and
    a single cross flow muffler behind the axle. I don&#146;t believe the real 1970 car had
    this type of set up. Value is around $140.00 for a near mint condition model.</td>

    year and now were raised letter Goodyear F60-15 Polyglass GT with Rally II wheels. This
    style of tire would continue through 1980. Value for the model is similar to the 1970. A

    model were deleted in 1972. In 1972 a lower front chin spoiler appeared under the front
    bumper valance panel and a small bird emblem was added to the front fender next to <i>Formula
    400</i>. The interior design was the same as the 1971 model with a Formula steering wheel
    and automatic transmission shift lever. The chassis detail was the same as the previous
    year. The tires were raised letter Goodyear F60-15 Polyglass GT with Rally II wheels. All
    1972 promos had problems with Metallic paint adhesion. The paint had a tendency to scratch
    and rub off easily. Value for this model is in the $130.00 range for a near mint example.</td>

<p align="left"><br>
Starting in 1975 and continuing through 1980 all Firebird promotional models were
unassembled promotional models known as &quot;Promo Kits&quot;. The promo kit was the same
as the previous assembled promos only now you had to assemble the approximately 25 parts
using an easy to follow instruction sheet. These promo kits were molded in authentic
factory colors and packaged in colorful boxes depicting pictures of the real car. The
value of promo kits are generally in the $30.00 to $60.00 range for factory sealed unbuilt
kits, while built kits are worth less. The following is a detailed look at Promo Kits.</p>

    Coupe</b> &#150; Colors known to exist: Sunstorm Yellow, Buccaneer Red, and Silver. This
    was the first year for the &quot;Promo Kit&quot;. It was a Formula 400 with twin hood
    scoops and was basically identical to the 1974 model except the parking lights were now
    located in the all chrome grill and the rear window had the new wrap around design. The
    interior design was unchanged from the 1974 model and included a Formula steering wheel
    and automatic transmission shift lever. The promo kit wheels and tires were now like the
    regular 1/25<sup>th</sup> model kit that included three pieces, a front chrome Rally II
    wheel, a raised letter Polyglass GT F60-15 tire, and a body colored back wheel. The
    Polyglass GT style tire was no longer used on the real car and should not have been used
    on the promo. The chassis now featured a single exhaust system with a single catalytic
    converter connected to a single cross flow muffler and dual tail pipes. This kit came
    packaged in attractive model kit style box showing a red with white interior Formula in a
    garage setting next to a silver Trans Am. The sides of the box showed other pictures of
    the car and some of its features. These pictures were illustrated in the 1975 dealer
    brochure. Value for a factory sealed unbuilt kit is in the $50.00 range.</td>

    was a Formula with newly revised twin hood scoops, grill, and front and rear bumper
    styling. The motor designation was no longer on the side of the front fender and now just
    said <i>&quot;Formula&quot;</i>. This was the last year for the Formula promotional model
    and the round headlight design. The interior seat design was new for 1976 and came with a
    Formula steering wheel and automatic transmission shift lever. Chassis detail was the same
    as the 1975 model. The tires were still the incorrect raised letter Goodyear F60-15
    Polyglass GT, with Rally II wheels. Box art was again colorful and showed a yellow Formula
    with the Formula Appearance Package. The sides of the box had different pictures of the
    car and its features. These illustrations were featured in the 1976 dealer sales brochure.

    the first year for the Trans Am promotional model and the new quad square headlight
    design. It included all the Trans Am spoilers, air extractors and shaker hood. A set of
    decals were also included with the kit and featured; nose, fender, rear spoiler <i>&quot;Trans
    Am&quot;</i> decals and the hood bird. The decals were printed in gray, red and black. The
    only inaccuracy on the decal sheet was the &quot;400&quot; shaker scoop decal. Beginning
    in 1977 Pontiac used Litres to identify engine displacement, so it should have read either
    6.6 Litre for the standard motor or T/A 6.6 for the optional motor. This kit also included
    a set of Rally II wheels, chrome left and right grills, standard Firebird interior design
    with a Formula steering wheel and an automatic transmission shift lever. The tires were
    still the incorrect raised letter Goodyear Polyglass GT style and the chassis detail was

    Trans Am and the sides highlighted the different features. Value for a factory sealed

    Trans Am Coupe</b> &#150; Colors known to exist: Starlight Black and Platinum. Changes
    from the 1977 kit included a set of snowflake wheels, chrome exhaust splitters and a
    &quot;Hurst&quot; designed T-Top roof. The black cars came with gold chrome parts and a
    complete set of gold Special Edition decals. The platinum car came with silver chrome
    parts and the same red, gray and black decal sheet from the 1977 kit. A couple of errors
    with the decal sheet were the l973 &#150; 1977 style lettering and the 6.6 Litre shaker
    scoop decal. For 1978 Pontiac didn&#146;t use decals on the shaker for the standard engine
    Trans Am and the optional Hi-Performance motor used the T/A 6.6 decal. The interior door
    panels were redesigned, however the seat design, Formula steering wheel and automatic

    Trans Am Coupe </b>&#150; Colors known to exist: Starlight Black and Platinum. New front
    and rear-end styling and larger Fisher designed T-Tops highlighted the 1979 kit. The
    chassis detail, interior design, snowflake wheels, tires and exhaust splitters remained
    the same as the 1978 kit. The decal sheet had gold Trans Am and T/A 6.6 lettering, gold
    Special Edition striping, black, gray and silver hood birds and sail panel birds were used
    in both kits. This time the lettering is correct for a 1979 car. The black car had gold
    chrome plated parts and the platinum car came with silver chrome plated parts. The cover
    of the box highlighted a dark blue Trans Am with camel interior and T-Tops. Value for an
    unbuilt factory sealed kit in mint condition is in the $25.00 - $35.00 range.</td>

    Trans Am Coupe</b> &#150; Colors known to exist: Starlight Black and Francisco Red. This
    model marked the final year for the second-generation Firebird promotional models and the
    &quot;Promo Kit&quot;. With the exception of the new custom interior design, this kit
    remained identical to the 1979 kit in all areas of detail. The decal sheet was very
    colorful this year with the &quot;Trans Am&quot; lettering and hood bird decal depicted in
    red, yellow and orange. These colors on the black car made for a visually striking model.
    Since all 1980 Trans Ams came with either the 301 4.9 litre or the 305 5.0 litre motor the
    use of the T/A 6.6 shaker scoop decals would be inaccurate. The black cars still came with
    gold chrome plated parts and the red car had silver chrome plated parts. The box cover was
    the same as the 1979 kit however the information on the sides was changed to reflect the
    1980 features. Value for an unbuilt factory sealed kit in mint condition is in the
    $25.00-$35.00 range.</td>
