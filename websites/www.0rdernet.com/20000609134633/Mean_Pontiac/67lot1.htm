than most. It started out life with a (in Brians words) <strong>&quot;wimpy&quot;</strong>
6 cyl. The owner before him dropped in a 350 <strong>&quot;crate&quot;</strong> motor and
thats what it had when he picked it up. But brian felt that a muscle car should have some
muscle and with the motto <strong>&quot;theres no replacement for displacement&quot;</strong>
dropped in a 71' 455. With ported 96cc 400/4v heads, 1.65 rockers, forged rods, 10:1
pistons, an &quot;S&quot; series factory camshaft, a Holley 3310/750cfm dual feed single
pump with vacuum secondaries on Edelbrock Performer manifold, and an MSD 6Al/blaster
ignition, Brian estimates his horsepower at 450. Since his gas gauge needle has begun
racing the speedometer needle to see which one can get all the way to the right the
quickest Brian says he might put the 1.5 rockers back on. Hes owned the car for eight
years and is looking for a 77' Bandit Trans Am or 74' Formula 455 HO for his next project.

    Murray McGill owns this deep navy blue metallic Firebird Coupe. The car is stock with the
    original 326c.i. engine and automatic on the column. His Firebird has power steering, a
    factory AM radio, a black factory &quot;custom&quot; interior, and rally IIs sporting BF
    Goodrich T/As. Murray has documented his car with <a href="http://www.phs-online.com">Pontiac
    Historical Services</a> and found that this car is an early production, numbers matching
    car that originated in California. Murray recently sent me this update:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I have been working on my 67 coupe (the 326) that you have
    in your gallery. The car has undergone a fair amount of restoration since early in 1998. I
    have had the entire drivetrain, suspension and chassis restored and detailed, along with
    the addition of a newly built up 455 Pontiac engine under the hood. I have also started
    the interior restoration and it is coming along nicely.<br>
    The engine is a mild 455 bored .030 over to bring it up to 462 ci. It has an Edlebrock
    Performer intake manifold, Ram Air 3 (068) cam and larger exhaust valves. Hedman headers,
    a Flowmaster exhaust, and a built TH350 to handle the torque have been installed. A 3.08
    10 bolt posi was added for cruising out back. It has plenty of go even with the 3.08. The
    site looks great too.<br>

    the car for several years in the neighbors driveway his father finally purchased it
    December of 1975 with 47,000 miles showing on the odometer. The car was 100% original and
    untouched. 8,000 miles and a few years later Dad passed the car on to son with only some
    paint-work and detailing. The bird is optioned heavily with a 400c.i. engine, Turbo 400
    transmission, 3:08 posi rear end, 4 piston caliper disc brakes, a hood tach, rally IIs
    with the factory correct redline tires, a deluxe interior, vinyl top, AM/FM radio, the

    mirror, custom pedal trim plates, wheel well opening moldings, rocker panel moldings, a
    trunk mat, custom seat belts, dual horns, and the ride &amp; handling package. The
    original sticker price came to a healthy $4,103.71.&nbsp;John Jr has shown the car since
    owning it and it has won 1st place in its class at every show its been in for the last
    three years. The P.O.C.I. Regionals in 1996 was one of them.<br>

    Trans Am would have debuted 2 years earlier than it did. This is one of the coolest first
    gen Firebirds I have ever seen. Converting it to look like the legendary 69' Trans Am was
    genius. The Firebird is equipped with a real 69' Trans Am all steel hood with reproduction
    pans underneath. The car is also equipped with the proper air extractors and trunk spoiler
    (snatched from an 85' T/A) that you would find on any 69' TA. It even has a hood tach
    thrown in so Kenny can watch the RPMs from the 68' 400 thats putting power to the ground.
    The 400 is from a GTO. The other GRRRREAT Pontiac musclecar. <br>
    The engine is stock save for a Pete Jackson gear drive. Kenny also upgraded the Bird's
    exhaust with 2<font color="#400000">½</font>&quot; exhaust and dual Flowmaster
    mufflers.&nbsp;The car also comes with a &quot;must-have&quot; 4-speed, power steering, a
    console, rally clock, rally gauges, a tilt formula steering wheel, fold down rear seat, AM
    radio, and a space saver spare. The Bird even has the correct blue interior and dark blue
    top that is consistent with the Trans Am theme. Kenny is definitely a Firebird fan. He has
    owned this particular car for eight years and its his sixth 1st gen. He also has a
    bonafide 69' Ram Air III Trans Am (featured on the 69' Trans Ams <a href="69talot1.htm">Lot#1</a>)
    sitting in storage waiting for a restoration. There aren't many of us out there that can
    say that. Consequently Kenny is also a fan and owner of Harley Davidsons.&nbsp;<br>
    Kenny recently sent me some new pictures of his car outfitted with a set of Rally IIs.
    According to Kenny: <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;After about 6 years with the Center Lines on, it
    was time for a change.&nbsp; Now the car appears almost completely
    stock.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; </td>
