the standard 4.9L powerplant that was offered in 80' with the optional turbo. This
combination was rated at 210hp. The car also comes with the WS6 Special Performance
Package. Its heavily optioned and utilizes four wheel disc brakes. It has racked up
113,000 miles and according to Frankie only needs a respray of the original code 11 Cameo
White and a new set of decals. Frankie is fairly big Firebird fan owning four examples of
Pontiacs flagship sports car. A 79' Trans Am, and 81' Trans Am and an 88' GTA (see the 88'
Firebirds Lot) make there home in Frankie's driveway.<br>

The turbo-equipped 4.9L 301c.i. engine is the powerplant of choice in this Poncho. Its
mated to a TH-350 automatic transmission. The underside of the car features 4-wheel disc
brakes and a radial tuned suspension. Optional equipment includes T-Tops, power windows,
power brakes, power steering, rear window defroster, and a cloth interior. Brandon writes:

<strong>&quot;This is a replica of the car from the movie &quot;Smokey and the Bandit
2.&quot; Under the hood and was the first to have the functional offset hood scoop.
Because of the turbo he carburetor had to be raised and offset. Unfortunately, the only
way the turbo charged motor came from the factory was with the automatic transmission. The
car has all options and even one that I have not seen on another Trans AM. The taillights
light up and say &quot;BANDIT&quot; on each side. Many people think that I have done this,
but it came like this from the factory and is done on the inside of the taillight
assembly. <br>
I bought the car when I was 15 and am the 3<sup>rd</sup> owner of it. The 2<sup>nd</sup>
owner did not own it very long, but long enough to burn up the turbo and to crack the
block in three places. The motor has been rebuilt once, turbo replaced and re-painted.
When the car went into hibernation it was still in great condition. I was just a poor
student in college and it was cheaper to buy a little &quot;rice burner.&quot; Now that I
am not the poor student I have started the restoration because it has been sitting for
many years. Unfortunately that restoration has halted for now because of traveling too
much for work and putting funds on my '97 Trans AM. My goal for the Turbo TA is to get it
back to original condition.&quot;</strong><em><br>

particular car is one of the Turbo Indy Pace Cars, coded X87, that were manufactured in
1980. This special production TA received a white paint job with gray highlights. The
interior came with oyster and black, vinyl and cloth bucket seats and the T-Tops were
tinted a silver color. These cars also came equipped with A/C, power windows, the WS6
Special Appearance Package, four wheel disc brakes, and a set of 15&quot;x8&quot; finned
turbo wheels that were painted white to match the bodycolor. No 4-speeds were offered on
any 80' Trans Am.</p>

looks like a model. Standard wheels for the 80' year model TA were once again the rally
II. I have often wondered why this particular wheel lasted so long. Bodycolor rally IIs
and cast aluminum snowflakes were optional. The turbo cast aluminum rims were also
optional but only in conjunction with the WS6 package and turbo 4.9L engine.</p>

e-mail on this car. It seems the owner was browsing the site and discovered his car was on
it!! The owners name is Dave Mittner. Dave was kind enough to give me some information on
the car to print here. Dave writes:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;The car was an original Florida car until 1988 when
it came north to Ohio. I purchased it in the spring of 1989 (with 83K original miles on
it). The car is fully loaded with most all the available options except rear defogger (no
need in Florida I guess). It doesn't have the Turbo hood lights either (its an early Van
Nuys car - built Nov. 15, 1979). The paint on the car is presently 95% original with the
usual stone chip touch up having been done. The car has NO undercoating and still has the
original exhaust (except for the Y pipe from the Cat to the mufflers). As near as I can
tell the motor has never been opened and the Turbo is the original one. It runs very well
and gets decent mileage on the open road (running original 3:23 gears). The overall
condition of the car was outstanding when purchased and continues to be (car now has
around 96K miles on it). The car is a regular at the Trans Am Nationals in Dayton Ohio
since 1989. Thats where this picture was taken, around 5 years ago. The picture also
appears on Pg 82 of Motorbooks International &quot;Firebird and Trans Am Illustrated
&quot; book.&quot; <br>

Three engines were offered for the 1980 Trans Am. All three were Pontiac 4.9Ls except for
a chevy 5.0L which was only installed in California built cars. The first engine was coded
W and was rated at 140hp. The next step up was the E/C code Y 4.9L rated at 155hp. The
last and most popular option was the Turbo version of the 4.9L coded T which was rated at
a respectable 210hp. The Turbo version came with a special hood with an offest bulge
designed to accomodate the Turbo unit under the hood. A &quot;Turbo 4.9&quot; decal was
affixed to the hood on the bulge. <br>

Trans Am was the most popular Firebird offered in 1980. These TAs came with the Turbo 4.9L
powerplant, a 3-speed automatic transmission and a 3.08:1 rear axle ratio. The car
featured a white paint job with charcoal accents on the front and rear bumpers, the hood,
and the roof. It also featured white Turbo aluminum rims, silver tinted T-Tops and a white
custom interior. Lastly a complete set of special decals was installed on the car. The
hood bird was larger than normal and made up of red, charcoal and grey colors. A large
size set of decals was also installed on either door denoting the cars Pace Car status. <br>

    Originally this TA was white with a tan interior and was equipped with the 301 that was
    offered for this year model. Since Tony took charge of it it has been stripped and painted
    black, changed the interior to charcoal, and installed a healthy 455, built with a Crane
    &quot;S&quot; cam, 750 Holley carb 1.65 rockers, built heads, and an Edelbrock Aluminum
    intake manifold. Cosmetically the original Turbo hood was removed in favor of a shaker
    scoop setup and the original wheels were replaced by a set of American Racing Torque
    Thrust Ds. To finish off his project Tony had a friend, Charlie Murray paint a mid 70s
    style bird on the hood. Tony writes:<br>
