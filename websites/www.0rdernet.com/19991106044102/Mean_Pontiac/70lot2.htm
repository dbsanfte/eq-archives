lineup in suspension technology as well as the new sleek streamlined bodystyle. It was
longer, lower, and heavier with a fastback looking style. This basic new body style would
last for 11 years tiil the Trans Am underwent its next biggest radical change in 1982.</p>

Hot Rod magazine road tested a RAIII Trans Am like this one with a 4-speed and a 3:90 rear
end. The 335hp engine was good for a reported pass of 13.9 @ 102mph in the ¼ mile. This
was an incerdibly fast time and the Hot Rod staff had to run the car four times at an
average of 14 sec before they would believe it hadn't been a fluke. <br>

<big><big>Your help is requested in locating this car!!</big></big><br>
<br>
I am posting this picture of this car as a special request to a gentleman who sent me an
e-mail looking for help. His story follows and I'd appreciate it if you'd read it if you
think you may know where the car depicted above is located.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1969 when Pontiac first published a picture of the not yet
released Formula 400 Firebird I &quot;fell in LOVE!&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time I had a
nearly new 1969 GTO Convertible which was less than a year old and very pampered. But, I
headed to the local Pontiac dealership&nbsp; ( Manly Pontiac, Abilene Texas to inquire
about purchasing one of the new birds).&nbsp; I was told by the salesman&nbsp; the 70.5
Firebirds would be allocated as one TransAm and One Formula 400 to each dealership and
although he would take orders, the first cars would be kept as floor displays.&nbsp; Not
dismayed , I sat down and filled out a special order for the car. The car was ordered in
Bermuda Blue, 400w 4BBL carb, triple tint glass, Black knit interior, 8track AM/FM Radio,
Rally gauges, Tach in the dash, CLOSE RATIO 4spd, Air, Rally Wheels, Trim in the wheel
wheels, drip rails and the rocker<br>
panel, PWR Steering and brakes, and low ration rear end.&nbsp; The factory BI**HED about
the order for quite some time as I was violating the warranty (no close ratio 4spds or low
rear end ratios with Air) I signed a release and the car came to Abilene in Feb. of 1970.
&nbsp; IN FACT MY BIRD PRECEDED ALL OF THE DEALERS FLOOR SAMPLES!&nbsp; The dealer was
bound and determined to keep me from knowing the car had arrived , but my future brother
in law worked in the shop and called the day it arrived.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was there within the hour! My near new GOAT CONVERT seemed to
be a lesser car and I happily traded the GTO to the dealer as &quot;PART&quot; payment for
the BIRD. I drove the BIRD for about 2 years ( I also got my one and only speeding ticket
in that car 100 MPH in a 70 MPH posted area - Interstate 20 between Ranger Texas and
Abilene.. Cost me $1.00 per mile!).&nbsp; In January 1972 I received orders ( I was in the
US Air Force stationed at Abilene Texas) to move to Omaha Nebraska. At the time the car
was paid for and a ready source of needed cash to make the move.&nbsp; So I sold the car
to an airman assigned to Dyess AFB taking his restored 1957 2dr Belair Chevy in partial
trade. The airman was originally from Mississippi and I lost track of the car the week I
sold it! <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The picture of the car attached displays the 1970 Texas plates
which were on the car when first registered.&nbsp; DJM-583 // possibly someone has the
capability to cross old registration plates to auto type and serial numbers? At any rate,
I would like to locate this car if it is possible. If I find the car I intend to
repurchase.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Thank you for indulging my dream.&nbsp;<br>

front air dam that runs from the front of one wheel down under the front end and ends at
the top of the other wheel was reported as providing 50lbs of downforce at high speeds,
when this car was first released. This all new design proved to be a popular one. Four
times as many TAs were sold for a total production run of 3,196.&nbsp; <br>

    <td width="77%" height="161" valign="top" style="text-align: left; vertical-align: text-top">Phil Boylan owns this nice looking
    Firebird Esprit. Phil writes:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;The VIN (224870N107877) reveals that it was
    originally a 1970 Firebird Esprit, 350 2bbl V8, TH350 trans, A/C, power brakes, power
    windows, custom interior, and vinyl top. I purchased it for $800 from my younger brother
    in 1984. He found it languishing at a small used car dealership in Rome Georgia. He
    couldn't afford it, but bought it anyway, then talked me into buying it three weeks later
    so he could pay the rent. When she heard the story, his wife put it on the short list of
    things he will NEVER be forgiven for...<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It had just over 100K on the odometer when we bought it. The
    original paint color was the light green that was popular in the early 70's (not sure what
    GM's name for this shade was), combined with a dark green vinyl top and interior. The
    interior color has been maintained, but I removed the peeling vinyl top and repainted the
    car about 8 years ago. The new color is &quot;GM pepper green&quot; (also an early '70s
    color). It could very well be the same color code as Pontiac's &quot;Brewster green&quot;,
    but I'm not sure.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's my daily driver. It now has approximately 230K miles on the
    chassis. I'm a consulting nuclear engineer, and I drive it all over the backroads of the
    Southeast going to power plant sites. Some weeks I'll put 600-700 miles on it. The
    &quot;restoration&quot; as such is therefore a continuing effort. You'll observe that it
    has the wrong wheels for a 1970 model. This was a compromise necessitated by it's daily
    driver status. The original Rally-II's (now in storage) were getting beat up by bad roads
    and potholes, so I switched to the cast aluminum gold snowflakes for strength reasons. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the Esprit V8 was the most plentiful of the 1970 models,
    and hence would not be of particular interest on the concours show circuit, I decided to
    gradually convert it to be the car I wanted to drive. In the late '80s I swapped out the
    original engine and trans and replaced it with a 1971 400V8 and TH400 trans. Late model 6X
    heads milled .060&quot; with 1.77&quot; exhaust valves, screw-in rocker studs, and teflon
    seals were used. Carburation was a quadrajet modified with the HO racing performance kit,
    mounted atop a 69 GTO manifold. Head/block machine work and balancing was done by Dave
    McIntosh of Roswell GA. Engine cooling was improved with a HD 4-core radiator, HD fan
    clutch, and hi flow aluminum water pump. A Rancho stage III suspension with poly bushings
    and fully adjustable front and rear anti-sway bars was also added during this period. The
    Formula 400 fender badges were added at about this time out of sense of honesty. ;^)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year began a second round of major mechanical changes,
    stimulated by a dismal 1st-ever 1/4 mile run of 16.3 seconds on street tires. The original
    open 2.73 rear-end was replaced with a 3.42 safe-T-track. The quadrajet (which was showing
    signs of severe age) was replaced with the Edelbrock performer rpm carb and performer
    manifold. An MSD-6AL ignition, Blaster-3 coil, Mallory Unilite distributor, and Taylor
    wires improved the ignition. Times improved, but not significantly. It was clear I was
    badly under cammed. The cam was replaced with the Edelbrock performer rpm, which has the
    same .050&quot; specs as the factory RA-IV cam. After head CCing, another .030&quot; was
    milled off the heads to bring the true compression ratio up to 9.5:1. The heads were
    ported per HO racing instructions. Reproduction Ram Air III exhaust manifolds were added,
    and a fresh dual exhaust system featuring Walker Dynomax super turbos with a crossover was
    installed. A B&amp;M shifter, Formula steering wheel, C&amp;P racing converter, shift kit,
    and trans governor programing kit completed this round of mods. The cam improvement and
    head work did the trick. 1/4 mile times at our Atlanta F-body shootout last October were
    down to 14.15 sec. This was respectable, being close to the published times for 1970
    RA-III production Firebirds.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More mods were completed for the Memphis-98 F-body show on May
    14-17. These included intake manifold port matching, Rhoads lifters, a beefed up valve
    train (Comp Cam magnum roller tip rockers, 7/16 studs with poly locks, and chrome-moly
    pushrods), trans cooler, mono-leaf rear springs, full factory rally gauge package, and a
    PowerMaster hi-torque mini-starter. Mods which didn't make it to Memphis and are still in
    the box include a Mallory Comp 140 electric fuel pump &amp; regulator, and RA-IV oil pump
    and shaft.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, a Ram-Air Formula hood sits in the garage waiting to be
    painted and installed. Diagrams of the rare 70-72 RA-IV air cleaner and snorkles are on my
    computer waiting to be converted into fabrication drawings for the sheet metal shop. A
    subframe (courtesy of MadMike Maciolek) hides in my back yard waiting to be sand blasted
    and painted with POR-15. It will be installed with poly A-arm bushings. Subframe
    connectors will be added coincident with the frame swap.<br>
    <br>
    My goal is to still be driving this car when I retire. I'm 41 now... :^)&quot;</strong></td>
