    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;Our car is equipped with Ram Air (320 hp),
    automatic, and white leather seats with logo. The rear window is glass with defogger and
    the top is like a royal blue (sometimes looks a purplish blue). The wheels have a purplish
    blue tint to them. It's a cool car but doesn't handle as well around corners as my Corolla
    GTS (fwd), BUT has plenty of power. We have #420 of 535 convertibles made (500 for the US
    and 35 for Canada). There were supposed to be 1065 coupes (65 for Canada and 1000 for US)
    made. I don't have the real stats yet as Pontiac says they won't be out until October.
    Don't know how many manuals versus automatics. We ordered a regular '99 Ram Air convert.
    black on black on black, 6 speed. We were told we weren't going to get it after it had
    been ordered for a few months. My husband placed the order in June '98. Found another
    dealership who had the 30th Anniversary coming in so we took that one instead. Had to wait
    quite a few months for it to come in. We live in Oregon (rain and more rain). Of course
    you can see we are used to no top as our '23 T Roadster didn't have a top until this year.
    We've had it since '92. That car started all of our hotrods. We won't get rid of it until
    we are too old to climb into it and can't go to car shows anymore!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    </strong>Sounds like a great philosophy to live by!!</td>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;We were in the market to purchase a muscle car,
    when we looked at some older models. After looking and not finding something we both could
    agreed upon, we decided to buy something new that we could keep for a long time.<br>
    We planned on buying a Red 2000 Trans Am. We started to research the idea more seriously
    in June of 98. When rumors of an Anniversary TA fell upon our ears, we thought why not try
    to order one, believing that we would never get one of these rare beauties. We thought if
    we didn&#146;t get the new Anniversary TA, we would be happy and settle for the Red 2000
    TA instead.<br>
    After searching for a dealership that might be able to get there hands on this rare find,
    we decided to call a dealership that was 325 miles away that would be our best chance of
    getting the Anniversary TA. <br>
    In March of 99 the dealership called, and told us we could pick up our 30th TA if we still
    wanted it, that if not they had others waiting in line to buy it. We went 3 days later and
    fell in love with our new car and drove it home. We have been ever so happy with it since.
    We only take it out for cruises/shows/ice cream.&quot;</strong><br>
