    <td width="75%" height="161" valign="top" style="text-align: left; vertical-align: text-top">Richard Griffith II owns this cool 50th
    Anniversary Trans Am. The first unique thing about theis car is that the T-Tops are
    aftermarket. This is a little weird since T-Tops made their debut in 76' and were offered
    on the 50th Anniversary models. But I guess at a bargain price of only $1,450 one can't to
    critical. The next weird thing about this car, or at least its acquisition, is that
    Richard found it on a used car lot. Things may be different in other parts of the states
    but in San Antonio, Tx (where I'm from) its almost unheard of to find a 2nd Gen Trans Am
    on a car lot. Thus its very hard for me to imagine. Richard only spotted the left front
    rim, as he was driving by, but being a TA buff he easily recognized the gold honeycomb
    wheel as belonging to a 76' 50th Anniversary TA!! Richard writes: <br>
    <br>
    <strong>&quot;I thought to myself: that's a gold Honeycomb rim, it might me a '76 L.E.! I
    turned around and pulled over. Sure enough, it WAS a '76 50th Anniversary L.E. TA. I
    called the dealership on Saturday and they were closed. I showed up Monday with money in
    hand. Needless to say I drove home in it. This car is loaded! A/C, Cruise Control, PW, PL
    (on the dash), Rear Defogger, HD Alternator, HD Radiator, Engine Heater, Ultra-rare Rear
    Console and a lot more over 20 options!!&quot;</strong><br>
    <br>
    I guess some folks are just lucky! Richard also owns a beautiful 1978 Y88 Gold Special
    Edition Trans Am (see the 78' Firebirds <a href="78lot1.htm">Lot#1</a>) and a 1978 DKM
    Macho Trans Am#86 (see the DKM Firebirds <a href="dkmlot1.htm">Lot#1</a>). <br>

    buying it. The original interior was red with red carpet, but was changed to a custom
    interior with new seats, dash, custom door panels, and carpeting. The new interior is
    black with grey inserts in the seats,&nbsp; and black and grey door panels with custom
    armrests. New soundproofing and some new black carpeting was also added to round out the
    interior upgrade. The new stereo was also cstom built and installed and probably a far cry
    from the factory unit. Two 400 watt amps, two 12&quot; speakers (mounted in the trunk),
    two 6&quot;x9&quot; speakers (mounted in the package tray) and two 6&quot; speakers in the
    door provide for some loud tunes. Thats a really cool TA Amanda!!! <br>

    <td width="75%" height="161" valign="top" style="text-align: left; vertical-align: text-top">Bill Rieken recently purchased this
    Trans Am as a project car to share with his son Chris. Bill picked up on the TA by
    answering an ad in the paper from a dealer trying to sell the car. When Bill and his son
    arrived at the dealership they found a mint condition Carousel Red Trans Am with a 400 and
    a 4-speed. Bill had owned a white 76' Trans Am with a 455 and a 4-speed several years ago
    that got traded in during the gas crisis of 1980. Needless to say the memories started
    flowing. The dealership was closed so Bill and son came back the next day and drove the
    car. It was a mechanically sound albeit a little louder than expected. Upon closer
    inspection headers were found; installed in place of the factory exhaust manifolds. A
    price was negotiated and Bill and his son drove the car home. The 400c.i. engine and turbo
    350 tranny now have less than 1200 miles since a rebuild. The headers were left on but a
    Super Coil was added and the shaker scoop was made to be functional. Some new interior
    parts have also been added. </td>

Only 319 Limited Edition TAs were produced with this combination. According to Gary the
car is well optioned with every power option available and the rare rear console. The car
has only logged 60,000 miles and is completely original. <br>

Gary is quite the Pontiac fanatic and collector with a collection totalling 11 cars. His
expansive collection includes: <br>
a 79' 10th Anniversary Trans Am (see the 79' Firebirds <a href="79lot1.htm">Lot#1</a>), <br>
an 80' Trans Am Pace Car, <br>
a seldom seen 81' Nascar Edition Pace Car with only 4,000 miles (seen at the 81' Firebirds

an 83' Daytona Pace Car, <br>
an 84' 15th Anniversary Trans Am, <br>

were produced with the new Hurst T-Tops. Only 110 of these were built with the 455 and
4-speed. This combo is one of the more rare TAs to be had. The 455 in its last year of
production was rated at 200hp.</p>

The 50th Anniversary was an extremely eye catching car and provided the basis for the
Bandit Edition Trans Ams that would debut in 77'. The black car was accented with gold
pinstriping, a gold Trans Am hood decal, and special gold Trans Am decals located on the
fenders and the rear spoiler, and a special gold fiftieth anniversary put on the fender
below the standard decal. These anniversary TAs also received gold headlight bezels, gold
grilles, a gold machine-turned dash faceplate, a gold center button on the steering wheel,
and gold anodized polycast honeycomb wheels. These cars could be had with either the 400
or the 455 and with or without T-Tops.</p>

Trans Am. I think the black and gold paint scheme was one of the most successful ones put
into production. The Limited Edition TAs built in 77' and 78' would prove to be the
highest selling TAs in its history due in part to the wildly popular &quot;Smokey and the
Bandit&quot; movies. I have personally owned two 76s: one black not an LE and one red with
T-Tops (interesting considering only the LEs were supposed to get them) and I loved them
both. Although a little low on the hp side; both had the standard 400 rated at 185hp, but
they still provided me with a lot of fun and memories. Besides these motors are EASY to
upgrade in performance and hp.</p>

was repainted and the owner either wanted the different looking decal or simply didn't
know. In either case the car still looks good. Also notice the small bird decal in the
center of the nose. This isn't original either. A decal was never offered in this spot. In
keeping with tradition Pontiac installed the well-known red &quot;arrow-head&quot; emblem
here. Two blues were offered in 76: Athena Blue and Polaris Blue. I don't know if this
blue is one of them or just the color the owner chose to paint the car. </p>

tell if this is blue or green, but either way its a beautiful paint job and really goes
with the interior color too. The rims on this Trans Am were not offered until either 77'
or 78' and are the larger 15' X 8' version of the snowflakes that were a new option
offered in those years. The 1976 Trans Am bodystyle was the only one that was only offered
for one year. All the previous bodystyles and future ones were offered for more than one
year before changes were made. </p>

    <td width="75%" height="161" valign="top" style="text-align: left; vertical-align: text-top">This limited edition 50th Anniversary
    Trans Am is owned by Eric &amp; Christina Cox. Only 1,628 Trans Ams were built with this
    anniversary package. These particular TAs sport a lot of features that were not available
    on the standard Trans Am. The gold bird emblem on the roof, that was a decal instead of
    the traditional metal emblem, the gold dash panel, gold steering wheel, and the 50th
    anniversary decal located below the Trans Am decal found on the front fenders all
    signified this anniversary model. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This L.E. was built with the
    smaller of the two available mills the 400c.i. engine. It was rated at a rather anemic
    185hp but none the less still managed to provide an element of performance. The standard
    3-speed automatic and a 3.08 posi-trac rear round out the drivetrain. Eric writes,<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;Even though it is
    underpowered by today's standards, when a local Mustang 5.0 or unsuspecting 4th gen Z28
    pulls up next to the TA at the light, most notice the &quot;400&quot; sticker on the
    functional shaker scoop and the huge &quot;TRANS AM&quot; decal on the back spoiler and
    don't try to test the TA's acceleration. I guess the reputation that the Trans Am cars
    have made for themselves makes these &quot;hot-rodders&quot; think twice before
    jumping.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    </strong>The interior is completely stock and in nearly perfect condition. The only change
    that has been made is the addition of an aftermarket AM/FM stereo and the replacement of
    the rear deck lid panel. The original stereo was kept and is boxed up. The car also
    retains its original Delco speakers. <br>
