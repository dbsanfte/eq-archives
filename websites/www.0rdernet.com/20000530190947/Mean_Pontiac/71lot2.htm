    <td width="77%" height="161" valign="top" style="text-align: left; vertical-align: text-top">Jeff Dunham's lucerne blue Trans Am is
    a rare and exciting example of Firebird performance of this era. Jeff purchased the TA in
    April of 1995 for a ridiculous sum of $2900. Pause while I recompose myself to continue
    with this write-up. Ok now that I have finished feeling sorry for myself I'll continue.
    The body was in great shape as you see here and the interior had just been refinished but
    the price did not come without cost. Both the rear and the transmission were to go out
    within a few months of buying the car. Both were rebuilt and the car has been on the road
    ever since. The powerplant residing in the engine bay of this awesome Trans Am is the
    standard engine of this year model, the 455HO. Jeff has rebuilt this too, including the
    installation of a 4bbl Edelbrock carburetor, an Edelbrock intake manifold, headers, and an
    electronic ignition and performance distributor. Jeff estimates the hp rating in the
    neighborhood of 350.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The transmission is the factory
    original rebuilt Turbo-Hydramatic 400. On the inside you'll find a Hurst V-Matic ratchet
    shifter to help with shifting.&nbsp;The rebuilt rear end is a 3:90 posi-trac unit and the
    tires chosen to carry this bad bird down the road are Goodyear Eagle ST
    P255/60R15s.&nbsp;Other enhancements include the original Honeycomb rims, a new dual
    exhaust, new carpets and a new headliner, &nbsp;and newly recovered vinyl seats.&nbsp;</td>

    standard powerplant during 71', a 455HO. Its also equipped with the much desired 4-speed.
    The Trans Am on the left is a rare 70' model equipped with a RAIV and a 4-speed. Its owned
    by Bill Marulis. The Trans Am on the right is one of the low production Trans Ams built in
    72'. Its equipped with a 455HO and an automatic tranny. Its also equipped with air

    that would mark the slow decline of horsepower numbers that would never recover. For 71'
    however PMD decided to add a new powerplant to the lineup that would alleviate some of the
    loss. The new engine, and strangely the only one offered was the 455HO. With a 8.4:1
    compression the new LS5 provided 355bhp @ 3500rpm and 480lb-ft of torque. <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><font size="3">&quot;It is a totally rust free California
    car originally equipped with a 400 cubic inch 2 bbl. I have since changed the intake to a
    Pontiac 4bbl intake and a Holley 750 cfm vacuum secondary. I attempted to keep a quadrajet
    carb on it but kept having problems with vapor lock on warmer days. It has 140,000 miles
    and as far as I can tell it has never been overhauled or resealed. It does not burn or
    leak a drop of oil. It has a turbo 400 tranny, original a/c compressor that is still cold.
    It has off white comfort weave seats with brown carpet, dash and console. It originally
    came painted gold with black vinyl top but the previous owner changed it to verdero green.
    I am considering having it painted back the original color. I could not resist having the
    Ram air hood installed when I came across one but it is originally an Esprit. Although the
    vinyl top is in excellent condition I am tinkering with the idea of removing it and
    painting the enitre car Brewster green. Here in Louisiana, a vinyl top is inviting
    potential rust and I do not want to start that battle. I am currently constructing a
    garage for it and I look forward to driving it every chance I get.&quot;</font></strong></td>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;It was great finding your site. I have always liked the
    body style of the early 70's Firebird and Trans Am. I finally found one in great shape and
    I bought it quick!! It is a 1971 Formula 350 Firebird. I have only done very minor things
    to the car. I purchased it for $3000 with two sets of tires and wheels. It had the wheels
    in the attached photos on it and he gave me the original wheels. They need a little
    cleaning but they are in great shape. He also gave me the spoiler that goes on the front
    end. I purchased the car in early August and it had just under 90,000 miles on it. The
    interior is in excellent shape. It sounds great and runs great!!! I am trying to find the
    parts needed to fix the Ram Air back the way it came new. And I need to make a few minor
    adjustments to the front end and then I am going to get it a fresh new paint job, leaving
    it it's original color. I hope you like the attached photos. I Love my car and I am
    enjoying driving it. Why is it that everyone thinks that it belongs to my husband?? Can't
    a female have and drive a great looking car too??&quot;</strong><br>
