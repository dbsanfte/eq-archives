come with the optional SD455 engine but did come with a 455. The mudflaps were not a
factory option but a nice addition especially color coded with the body paint. A wheel
size was added for the 73 models. F60X15s mounted on rally II rims were the standard
rubber.</p>

This picture was submitted by Ken Carothers. He photographed it at the POCI (Pontiac
Oakland Club International) convention in Irvine California a few years ago. The TA is
equipped with the potent 250hp 455 and a Turbo 400 tranny. You will notice the car has
T-Tops. This is an aftermarket addition to the car that was performed by the owner. T-Tops
were not available from the factory till 1976. Upon closer inspection you will also notice
the 3rd gen style fender vents that have been added to the rear of the hood. Interesting
modifications for this year model Trans Am.</p>

This Trans Am is owned by John Wallace. Its all original with a 455 and a Turbo 400
tranny. The rear end is a 10- bolt posi unit with 3.08 gears. Its Bucaneer Red with a
black interior and has only 86,000 miles. The car has seen some track time and has run a
best of 9.00 flat @ 74mph on an 1/8 mile track. Besides racing the car has also attended
several shows and even won 3rd place at a POCI convention in Kansas City.<br>
<br>
John and his family own several Firebirds including a 70' Formula (see the 70' Firebirds <a href="70lot2.htm">Lot#2</a>) and another 70' Formula that is outfitted for strip duty (see
the Drag Racing Firebirds <a href="drlot1.htm">Lot#1</a>). John also hosts his own web
site called <a href="http://www.geocities.com/MotorCity/4923/">Wallace Racing</a>. Stop by
and find out more about this families long tradition of Pontiac racing.&nbsp; <br>

production Trans Am with the SD455 engine option. Besides the color is really cool. In
fact the color options on the Trans Am broadened for the first time in 3 years. Previously
the TA could only be had in either Cameo White or Lucerne Blue with a stripe, the opposite
color of the car, running down the center of the car. The new color options included the
Brewster Green on the car above and Buccaneer Red. Cameo White remained and Lucerne blue
was deleted.</p>

    Richard and Dana Fish own this 48,000 mile Trans Am. The 455 and Muncie 4-speed are both
    the factory originals and the car still runs like it was new. The interior is also
    completely stock, original and in excellent condition. On the outside the car has been
    repainted and the hood bird is no longer a decal. The bird was custom painted on the hood
    by Tom Carr of Carr's Autobody.&nbsp;Richard and Dana recently sent me the fifth picture
    in the set after Dana finished a full restoration on all four honeycomb rims.<br>
    <br>
    An interesting story about this car is that at one time Richard wanted to sell it. His
    wife (Dana) talked him out of it (what a wife huh??!!) and the car became hers. Dana
    performed the restoration on it and also takes car of the regular maintenance and waxings.
    The car is now almost in show-ready form. Apparently Dana enjoyed this project so much
    that shes about to begin the restoration of a 74' 455 Trans Am. <br>
    <br>
    Richard also owns a 1977 Trans Am (seen at Drag Racing Firebirds <a href="drlot3.htm">Lot#3</a>)
    that has been outfitted for serious strip action. Its currently running in the 9s and 10s
    with a Pontiac 455 and Hughes Turbo 400.</td>
