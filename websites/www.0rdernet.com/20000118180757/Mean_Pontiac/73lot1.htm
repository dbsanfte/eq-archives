Fred Spargo's Trans Am is a little unique. It is actually a 73½!! At least that was what
the previous owner said when Fred called. Needless to say Fred took it by his mechanic to
check out these claims. The verdict?&nbsp; The car is carrying a Y8 LS2 block, which
equates to the 455 Super Duty folks, a $600 option. Not only that Fred was to find out
that his car was a 74' with a 73' front clip. Some may have been upset but Fred was
estatic, the best looking front clip ever made plus the rear end with its solid 5 mph
bumper design was the best of both worlds. Fred also airbrushed the hood bird on the car
and added the honeycomb wheels. I'm sure the airbrushing was quite a feat. </p>

    A Ram Air equipped Formula. This pic was spotted by a site browser who noticed it was the
    car his brother had just recently sold. He graciously e-mailed me and provided me with
    some information on it. Its an uncommon 1 of 730 Formula with the factory installed 455.
    The big Poncho mill is completely numbers matching including the HO cam. The tranny is the
    standard TH400 that was installed in Firebirds during this model year. Options include
    power steering, power disc brakes, power windows, A/C, tilt wheel, a factory unitized
    distributor (HEI), 14&quot; Honeycomb rims, and a dual aluminized exhaust which feeds a
    single FlowMaster muffler. The rear is a 3:42 posi-trac unit. You'll also note this
    particular Formula was built with the optional rear decklid or trunk spoiler and some
    aftermarket door bumper guards have been installed that run from the inner rear fender
    along the door to the inner front fender. These are often seen on Firebirds because they
    offer protection against door dings.<br>

used in the movie &quot;Thunderbolt And Lightfoot&quot;. Clint Eastwood was the big star
in this movie and the car was actually purchased from him personally by the current owner.
The owner, who hails from South Dakota, handles a lot of stars cars. He is the owner and
publisher of the Deals On Wheels magazine, and the owner of The Performance Car Museum in
Sioux Falls, South Dakota, where he displays the majority of his collection. In fact this
photo was taken in the museum. The Trans Am makes its appearance in the very beginning of
the movie when Clint is being chased. After a short while he trades it for a Buick Riviera
and the TA isn't seen again. The short appearance is worth watching however as the TA is
throttled pretty good. For some reason the TA in the movie has a red shaker scoop rather
than the correct white one depicted here. </p>

A Buccaneer Red Formula equipped with Rally IIs. Although Formulas only received minor
changes for the '73 year model emissions laws and hp restrictions began to take their
toll. The previously functional hood scoops were now a cosmetic addition to the car. On
the lighter side however the new SD455 produced in '73 was available as an option on the
Formula. This engine option (LS2) required the installation of the rear facing shaker
scoop instead of the standard Formula hood which is depicted here. Here's an interesting
bit of information provided to me by a friend on the subject of the Ram Air setups of the
'73 &amp; '74 Formulas:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;The Fabulous Firebird&quot; by Michael Lamm (pg 74)
states that the LS2 455 required the WU3 Ram Air hood.&nbsp; The &quot;FIREBIRD, A Source
Book&quot; by Thomas Bonsall has copies of a 1973 Firebird order form which lists the WU3
Ram Air hood as being optional on the Base &amp; Esprit models and standard on the Trans
Am. &nbsp; However, we all know that the SD455 equipped Formulas came with the Shaker
Scoop &amp; T/A hood.&nbsp; Apparently, the WU3 (WX3) Ram Air hood refers to the T/A hood
in 1973.&quot;<br>
<br>
</strong>Chris Giles wrote in and provided this additional information about Ram Air
setups from 1970 to 1974:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><font size="3">&quot;On '70 models it came with the L74
Ram Air III engine (I have one of these). On '71 and '72's Ram Air came with the LS5 455
HO, and Ram Air was NOT available on lesser engined 70-72's. However in '73 and '74 the
SD455 became a Formula option. These cars had non-functional shaker hoods. Lesser Formulas
could be had with the WU3 Ram Air sytem, I'm not certain that it was available on 350 or
400's but it was definitely available on non-SD 455 Formulas in both '73 and '74. There
was a fellow at the '98 TA Nationals in Dayton, Ohio who had a '73 Ram Air equipped
Formula 455, including the original window sticker (not a reproduction). Ram Air was not
available after 1974 (until the recent models).&quot;</font></strong></p>

Apparently this was a required option as stated above with this engine option, however
I've already received an e-mail from someone who claims he received the normal Formula
hood (as seen above) with the SD455 as a &quot;SPECIAL&quot; factory option. If any of you
have any information on these interesting and unique cars please don't hesitate to drop me
an e-mail. You can even <a href="mailto:jmeans@msw0.attnet.or.jp">click here</a> to do so.</p>

This diagram was provided to me by Phil Pollard. Its a graphical representation of how the
Formula hood evolved from 1969 to 1981. A recent discussion about which hood was correct
for what year model on the Pontiac E-Mail List proved that several people were somewhat
confused as to which hood WAS appropriate for what year. As a result Phil drew up this
diagram and forwarded it to me to display for you. Thanks Phil...<br>

equipped with honeycomb wheels but lacks the infamous hood bird or &quot;screamin
chicken&quot;. Does this mean the car isn't original or at the very least has been
repainted? Not necessarily. In 1973 the large hood bird was only an option offered in
place of the small bird on the hood normally seen on previous years. This was because 73'
was the first year the larger hood bird was offered and a lot of fans of previous
Firebirds weren't happy with this new addition to the TA styling. The larger decal would
become a standard option in 74'.</p>

design and performance for the second generation cars. The introduction of several new
colors (lucerne blue and white were the only available colors from 70' to 72'), the new
hood decal (which I have always loved), the new Super Duty 455 engine option, continued
refinements in suspension technology and horsepower combined with creature comforts made
this the undeniable best muscle car on the market in its day. </p>

Buccaneer Red with a black interior and has the optional hoenycomb wheels installed. The
new optional SD455 block was the most exciting production block offered by any automaker
by 1973. Underated the early production blocks came in at 310hp while the later versions
were reduced to 290hp to meet ever increasing emissions standards. The main changes
occured in the camshaft. </p>

This is the first Trans Am pic I ever found. I downloaded it from a BBS several years ago
before I had internet access. This pic served on wallpaper duty for a long time. Too bad
there aren't more pics like this out there.</p>
