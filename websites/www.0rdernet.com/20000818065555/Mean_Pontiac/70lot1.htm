    <br>
    <strong>&quot;I bought this 1970 RAIV/Auto Trans Am in 1997, after longing for it for 9
    years. This was my fourth and last car purchase to add to my collection of Poncho's. I
    also have a 69' RAIV/4-speed Trans Am (see the 69' Trans Ams <a href="69talot1.htm">Lot#1</a>)
    and a 1970 Judge Convertible RAIII/4-speed in Orbit Orange. I first heard about this 1970
    RAIV Trans Am in 1988, when the owner had bought it out of Los Angeles, CA, where it had
    been since the early 1970's. The car had originally come from Johnson Pontiac in Clinton,
    Iowa. I'm currently trying to track down previous owners from 1988 back. The man I bought
    it from was also a T/A collector, but due to a large upcoming family, plus 6 other rare
    birds he decided to sell me the car. I'm very glad he did because there was a long line
    for it. I had bought a lot of T/A parts from him over a 10 year span and had developed a
    frendship with him and will continue it. The 1970 RAIV is a very rare car, only 88 cars
    were made. My car is the &quot;XP&quot; code auto, only 29 of the 88 had the auto
    transmission! My buildsheet calls it a SD RA, originally Pontiac was going to put in the
    RA-V tunnel port, but changed their minds at the last minute and used the RAIV that the
    GTO's had. These 1970 T/A's are very rare, under 30 are documented most without the
    original block. Pontiac originally made 1 service replacement block for every RAIV car
    made. My car is white with the blue standard interior and has very few options as most
    standard RAIV's. I plan to keep these four exotic and rare ponchos for good - they
    represent the late 60's and early 70's muscle car era. I have some rare options that I
    plan to add such as: power truck, am/fm stereo/8-track, power door locks with seat back
    locks, tilt, 1970 door edge gaurds and rear defroster. The 1970 RAIV T/A I have is 100%
    original and complete with all rare and exotic parts. A concourse resto is being done and
    is about 80% complete - it has been easy because if the cars 47,000 mile originality and
    it's zero rust due to it's life on the West Coast. At 30 years, this is my last car. I
    feel lucky to have these 4 original, exotic Pontiacs and plan to keep them forever. I
    truly love the hobby and people I meet because of it.&quot; </strong><br>

The car was originally delivered to Bill McDavid Pontiac in Fort Worth, TX on may 3, 1970.
Apparently the car was caught in a sandstorm there sometime in the 70s and the car was
sold to its second owner who slowly restored it until he sold it to Tom about a year ago.
The car is mainly stock with the exception of headers. Options include: an AM/FM radio,
S/R glass, custom trim, console, and A/C. The MSRP for this bird was $5,215.89.</p>

at $168.51 its a wonder everyone didn't order it.<br>

    deflectors, front fender air extractors, and a rear facing functional hood scoop. 15 inch
    rally II rims sporting F60X15 raised white letter tires put the power to the pavement.</td>

very cool Ram Air IV Trans Am. Only 88 Trans Ams were made with the optional RAIV engine.
It was rated at 370hp. The functional hood scoop was one of the coolest features of these
cars. I attempted an explanation of the operation of the shaker scoop but it was somewhat
incorrect. Phil Pollard provides us with the correct one: <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;The scoop does indeed
have a flap and two solenoids that are located inside the scoop as you stated, but they
are *electrically* operated not vacuum operated. They use a WOT switch mounted on the
carb, a relay mounted on the firewall, and the two solenoids that are mounted inside of
the scoop itself. Your explanation stated &quot;vacuum lines actuated the solenoids&quot;
which just isn't the case. The *1969* TA scoops were vacuum operated and many folks will
try and convince you that the 70's were too. I've heard many times (from a very
knowledgeable person) that &quot;the first Trans Am's had vacuum operated
&quot;flappers&quot;. Apparently some people forget that the '69 was the *first* year for
the TA! (and indeed did/does have vacuum operated scoops).&quot;</strong><br>
<br>
Well at least I had part of it correct. Thanks for the information correction Phil!!</p>
