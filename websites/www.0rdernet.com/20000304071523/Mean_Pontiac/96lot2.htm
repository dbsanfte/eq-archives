    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;When I bought my 1996
    Ram Air Trans Am, I had no idea of the attention my car would get.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Once it got attention from a fast little Mustang on the highway. He wanted to race me in
    moderate traffic.&nbsp; I revved my car's engine a little and shook my head.&nbsp; I meant
    it to mean, &quot;Race?&nbsp; In this traffic?&nbsp; You're an idiot.&quot;&nbsp; but he
    probably took it to mean, &quot;Race? Me against you?&nbsp; Listen to this engine! &nbsp;
    I'm not even going to bother!&quot;&nbsp; Besides, I'm not much into spanking cars, not
    even with my hand.<br>
    <br>
    Speaking of racing, it also gets attention from the police.&nbsp; I think cops love to
    pull over sexy cars.&nbsp; Now I'm not the sort of person who breaks the speed limit by 50
    mph.&nbsp; I believe I drive at reasonable speeds.&nbsp; But my opinion doesn't matter; I
    got caught twice for speeding.&nbsp; After that I decided to get a radar detector, and I
    haven't had a ticket in the two years I've had it.&nbsp; That, and I know all the speed
    traps along the New Jersey Turnpike.<br>
    <br>
    Speaking of the New Jersey Turnpike, my hot Firebird gets plenty of attention from the gas
    jockeys along the NJT.&nbsp; They would say things like, &quot;So, how much did it
    cost?&quot; (Answer: &quot;$30,000&quot;), &quot;How do you like it?&quot; (Answer:
    &quot;It's a lot of fun to drive&quot;), and &quot;You should keep it in the garage
    instead of driving it out here!&quot; (Answer: &quot;It's a lot of fun to drive&quot;).<br>
    <br>
    Finally, speaking about fun, my car gets plenty of attention from me. I love my car and I
    do my best to make it happy.&nbsp; I wash it when I can, and keep it in the garage when
    I'm not driving it.&nbsp; I give it all the servicing it needs and then some.&nbsp; And I
    don't spank my car. Usually.&quot;<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;My WS6 is fully loaded with every option except a
    front license plate frame.&nbsp; If it was available for the '96 model year it is on this
    car.&nbsp; My car also has an interesting story behind how I got it (as it seems do many
    WS6's):<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was working for International Speedway Corporation in Daytona
    Beach, Florida as their AIX/UNIX Systems Administrator.&nbsp; At the time I had a '94 Jeep
    Cherokee.&nbsp; I decided that I wanted something fun to drive.&nbsp; I was told that
    Pontiac &quot;GAVE&quot; Trans Am's to the speedway executives for promo purposes. &nbsp;
    One of the executives (the Risk Manager) had a '96 WS6 for his executive car. &nbsp; I
    found that the car was coming up for sale and quickly put a claim on it. I also was told
    that the car was used on the Daytona International Speedway 2 times for demo rides,
    however it had a vibration at 115mph so it was not used again.&nbsp; A friend suggested
    that the drive shaft may be causing the vibration.&nbsp; After some searching I discovered
    that Pontiac has issued a TSB regarding out of balance drive shafts on some '96
    Firebirds.&nbsp; I had the local dealer in Daytona replace the drive shaft under warranty,
    using the TSB, with the 1LE aluminum drive shaft.&nbsp; That solved the vibration problem.
    If I had waited any longer to get my hands on the WS6, Pontiac would have sent it to the
    local auto auction and there was nation wide interest in that specific car.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I have always been a MOPAR man but MOPAR is not making
    anything in this price range that even comes close to the WS6!!&nbsp; I&nbsp; bought it in
    November of '96 and fell in love.&nbsp; The car is a dream to drive.&nbsp; However I never
    expected to get the attention that it gets.&nbsp; I even had a guy ask me to pull over so
    that he could look at it.&nbsp; In August of '97 I left International Speedway Corp. and
    drove the WS6 across the country to my home in California where I now reside.&quot;</strong></td>
