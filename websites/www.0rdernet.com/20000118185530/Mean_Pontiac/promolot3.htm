<p align="left"><strong><font size="6"><br>
</font></strong><font size="3">The fourth generation 1993-97 Firebird promotional models
were available in coupe and convertible body styles with the convertible being offered in
1996 and 1997. All fourth generation models are Trans Ams and were produced by AMT/Ertl in
1/25<sup>th</sup> scale. The fourth generation models offered excellent detail. Colors
were limited to one or two for each style per year and for the first time came with
different colored interiors and a black chassis. These promos are reasonably priced and
easier to find than many of the older models with the exception of the 1997 Convertible.
Only 2,500 1997&#146;s were produced and sadly marked the end of Firebird promotional
models. Values will range from $25.00 for a 1993 to around $50.00 for a 1997. The
following is a detailed look at the fourth generation.</font></p>

    front bumper bird decal, chrome fog lights and complete black and red taillight treatment
    with small red bird in the center of the lens. The rear glass had lines running across it
    to simulate the rear window defogger. Tires were the correct style Goodyear Eagle GSC
    radials. Gray was the only interior color and was well detailed right down to the
    six-speed shifter and seat belt holders on the headrest. The chassis was molded in black
    and featured correctly detailed front and rear suspension, drive train and exhaust system.
    Value for a mint condition car is in the $25.00 range.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

    model was made. Like the real car the promo was done in all white exterior with white
    interior. It had the optional T-Top roof done in black. A blue center stripe ran the
    length of the car with a blue bird located at the nose of the front bumper. &quot;25<sup>th</sup>

    Unique five spoke white wheels with Eagle GSC tires rounded out this package. The black
    car was very similar to the 1993 model with gray interior, T-Top roof, Eagle GSC tires and
    silver wheels. The chassis of both cars were black and identical to the 1993 model. Value
    for a mint condition black car is around $25.00 and $35.00 to $45.00 for the 25<sup>th</sup>

    finish the model also featured a gray cloth style interior with six-speed shifter, black
    convertible boot, chrome 5 spoke wheels mounted in Goodyear Eagle GSC tires, chrome fog
    lamps and the word <i>&quot;Trans Am&quot;</i> on the lower front doors. The rear
    taillight treatment was the same as the previous model. The lower rear bumper now featured
    molded exhaust extensions. The front bumper featured a molded bird instead of a decal. The
    chassis was the same as the 1993-1996 models. Value is hard to determine for this model
    because of its rarity. I paid $35.00 for mine.</td>

<p align="center"><big><big><big><strong>A Final Thought</strong></big></big></big></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This brings me to the end of a detailed look at Firebird
promotional models. I hope you have enjoyed the ride. I will continue to research for new
information and update accordingly. I want this to be as informative and complete as
possible. I am open to any suggestions or comments that anyone may have. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have collected Firebird promotional models as a hobby since
1973. Sadly I had all the first generation models when they were new, but being a small
child I played with them to a point were none exist today. As a collector I now have to
re-purchase those $2.00 models at prices often 7,500% to 25,000% more than they originally
sold for at Pontiac Dealers. All the models in my collection are near mint to mint
condition. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My suggestion to those interested in starting to collect
Firebird promos with a limited budget is to begin with the second and fourth generation
models. These models seem to be plentiful and reasonably priced. Generally they can be
purchased from $155.00 for 1970-1972 models to $25.00-$50.00 for the 1977-97 models. The
first generation models are more expensive. My experience has been anywhere from $225.00
for a excellent near mint condition 1967 coupe to as much as $475.00 for a very rare 1968
convertible in mint condition. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prices will vary with condition. Near mint to mint condition
models will always bring a premium over those models in excellent and lesser condition.
Generally a near mint condition model will have maybe slight imperfections either on the
body or chrome. True mint condition models will be free from flaws not including factory
flaws. A good source to find who sells these models is in the <i>Automobilia</i> section
of <i>Hemmings</i> <i>Motor News</i> or any of the scale model car magazine classified
sections. One source that I have found and had an excellent experience with is <i>Wheat&#146;s</i>
<i>Nostalgia</i> 216 Tech Road Pittsburgh, PA 15205 Ph# (412) 922 0616. </p>

<p>Happy collecting! <br>
