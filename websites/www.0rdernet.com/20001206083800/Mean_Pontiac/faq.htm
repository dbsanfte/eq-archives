<h3><a name="faq1"><font face="Foreground Font">How do I send you pictures of my Firebird
?</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">First let me tell you that I have a site standard
limitation of five images per car. You do not have to submit five images of your car but
you may submit up to that many. A good rule of thumb is to take 3 of the exterior and one
each of the interior and the engine bay, but this is not a requirement. You can send me
all five of the exterior if you wish or any other combination. <br>
<br>
All images submitted for addition to this site must meet the following requirements:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) They
must be in the .jpg format. If you are unsure how or unable to convert them from their
current format <a href="mailto:firebirdgallery@0rdernet.com">contact me</a> for help. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) The
images MUST be bigger than 640x480 and smaller than 800x600 (just under 800x600 is
preferred).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) Images
should be clear and in proper color <br>
<br>
If this seems like a lot, you have to understand I have been doing this for two years and
about 50% of the images folks send me with good intentions are just not usable on the
site. I'm providing these requirements to cut down on me having to contact you to ask for
new pics and you having to get new ones. Below are a couple of pictures to illustrate how
much a good quality image can make when displayed on the internet:<br>
<br>
Excellent Image:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Unusable image:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>
There are two ways that you can submit images to the site:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Send me your Firebird photos via U.S. Mail t0:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Shaw AFB, SC 29152<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will only post five pictures of your
car to the site but you may send me as many photos as you wish and I will pick the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; best five of the bunch. You also need to
indicate if you wish to have the photos mailed back to you.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. A faster way is through e-mail if you can scan them or
otherwise port them into your computer. There are several<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; products on the market (i.e. the
&quot;Snappy&quot;) that will allow you to take &quot;snapshots&quot; from a VCR or
camcorder and port<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them directly into your computer. Digital
cameras work well too and are slowly becoming reasonably priced. <br>

<h3><a name="faq2"><font face="Foreground Font">What kind of information would you like me
to include about my Firebird ?</font></a></h3>

<p>This is basically up to you. If you have already or are about to browse the site you
can read the information included with the images and you should be able to get a feel for
the kinds of information people are interested in reading. Ask yourself what kind of
information would you like other Firebird fans to know about your car!? Heres a couple of
suggestions to get you started, just remember you are not limited to answering just these
questions:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Engine/tranny - what kind of engine and
transmission combo are you currently using? What factory high performance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; goodies have been
installed on it? What aftermarket high performance parts have been installed? Has it been
rebuilt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; either professionally
or by yourself and if so what was done? Do you have a horsepower estimate?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Interior - What factory options did your
Firebird come with? Have you added any it didn't come with or deleted or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; modified any that that
it did? What color is it? Is it the deluxe or standard? etc....<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Paint &amp; Body - What color is your car?
Is it the original factory color? What modifications have you made in these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; areas? Is the color a
special order color from the factory?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Misc - Do you have any 1/4 mile times for
your car? Have you won any trophies or placed in any shows with your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firebird? Do you have
an interesting story about how you found and bought your car? etc...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Lastly if you have a homepage I will provide
a link to it free of charge. If you would like to take advantage of this offer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you need to provide me
with the URL to your homepage and the name of it. I also need to know if you would like me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to include your e-mail
address on the site with your car. I don't post private information like e-mail adresses
unless it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requested by the
individual.</p>

<h3><a name="faq3"><font face="Foreground Font">How do I send you pictures of Firebird
model kits ?</font></a></h3>

<p>If you have a Firebird model kit (it doesn't matter if its been built or not since all
I need is pictures of the box) that is not already depicted on the site and you would like
to submit some pictures of it heres how: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First we'll go over sending in the pics. To provide other site
browsers with a good look at your model I would recommend you submit a picture of the top
of the box and one of the side (the side that usually has extra info and pics of the car).
The images must meet the same requirements as #1 above. For model pictures I am only
accepting them via e-mail at the moment. You can read over the &quot;<a href="#faq1">How
do I send you pictures of my Firebird</a>&quot; faq above for specifics on the images.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

<hr>

<h3><a name="faq4"><font face="Foreground Font">What kind of information would you like me
to include with the Firebird model pics ?</font></a></h3>

<p>I probably have not built or even seen some of the kits that will get sent in so its
impossible for me to provide site browsers with a good description of the model. You on
the other hand are the perfect candidate. Heres some of the things I'd like you to tell me
about your kit:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. What color the parts are molded in.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. If the kit can be built more than one way.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Descriptions of the decals and chromed parts
that are included.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. The date the kit was manufactured.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Any special or weird options included with
the kit.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Rarity and availability if you know it. </p>

<h3><a name="faq5"><font face="Foreground Font">I'd like to correct/dispute some Firebird
information you've put on the site !</font></a></h3>

<p>No problem at all. I only seek to provide Firebird fans out there the most accurate
information possible. I have owned six different Trans Ams over the last ten years but I
am far from the most knowledgeable in the hobby. If you think I have provided incorrect
information anywhere on this site please feel free to email with what you think is correct
and I will investigate it. If you are correct I will change the information and space
permitting put a remark naming you as the corrected information provider.<br>

<h3><a name="faq8"><font face="Foreground Font">How do I get my Firebird on the Projects
Lot ?</font></a></h3>

<p>This is very easy. You only need to do two things:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. First you need to send me some pics of your
Firebird undergoing its restoration, modification, race-prep whatever.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You need to follow the
same guidlines for sending images to me that was discussed in the <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;<a href="#faq1">How
do I send you pictures of my</a> <a href="#faq1">Firebird</a>?&quot; faq. When you are
organizing the pics you want to send just ask yourself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what kinds of images
you would like to see of someone elses project car.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Second you need to provide me some
information on what exactly is being done to the car. Try to avoid providing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; short descriptions of
what is happening in each picture. I clump the information sent together in several
paragraphs so<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an overall description
of what is being done to the car is most desirable. As to content of the information you
may<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provide any information
you would like people to know about your car. There is no specific requirement, as I said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; above just ask yourself
what things would you want to read about someone elses project.</p>

<h3><a name="faq9"><font face="Foreground Font">How do I get my Macho/MSE TA on the Macho
&amp; MSE Lot ?</font></a></h3>

<p>This is very easy you only need to do two things?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. First you need to send me pictures of your
Macho or MSE Trans Am. You need to follow the same guidlines for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sending images to me
that was discussed in the &quot;<a href="#faq1">How do I send you pictures of my Firebird</a>?&quot;
faq. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Second you need to provide me some
information about you Macho or MSE TA. The only requirement I have is that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you provide the series
number of your car i.e. 78' Macho Trans Am #24. This is because I am displaying the Macho<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and MSE cars in
numerical order on the lots as you have probably already seen. Although not a requirement,
since<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some owner may have
Machos or MSEs with rare equipment options and do not wish to divulge the fact, I would<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; highly encourage you to
include a list or breakdown of the modifications performed on your car by DKM and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; different options or
packages it received. Other information on the car is completely up to you. See the &quot;<a href="#faq2">What kind of</a><br>

<h3><a name="faq10"><font face="Foreground Font">How do I get my bitchin' 9 second tubbed
Firebird on the Drag Racing Firebirds Lot ?</font></a></h3>

<p>Well that sentence is a little misleading so let me clarify who this section is for.
This section is specifically reserved for cars that are no longer stock and are used
solely for the drag strip. If your car is basically stock, street legal but is taken to
the track a few weekends a year then your car can be displayed on one of the lots
associated with its year model. However if your car is no longer stock and is outfitted
for some form of regular drag racing then this is where your car should be displayed. Pro
Street to Top Fuel to Funny Cars is what you'll find gracing the pages of these lots. Now
how do you get that bitchin 9 second tubbed Firebird on the DRF lot! Two things must be
done:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. First you need to send me some pictures of
your car. You need to follow the same guidlines for sending images to me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that was discussed in
the &quot;<a href="#faq1">How do I send you pictures of my Firebird</a>?&quot; faq. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Second you need to send me some information
about your Bird. Here's the categories I am displaying for each car and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the kind of information
I am looking for:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) <strong>Engine:</strong>
This should be fairly obvious. I'd like to see information on displacement, horse power
ratings and how it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was built from bottom to top. You may be as in-depth and
technical as you wish.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) <strong>Drivetrain:</strong>
Rear end and tranny information goes here. Suspension and/or braking modifications can
also be covered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; here. Chassis and frame info may also be added.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) <strong>Body
&amp; Interior:</strong> Here you tell us what modifications were made to the body an
interior to get it on the drag strip be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it mild or wild. Tubbing the rear, replacing the interior
with aluminum sheetmetal etc....<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) <strong>Best
Quarter Mile Time:</strong> I think I would be severely remiss if I didn't include this
one and I think its self explanatory.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just be honest please.</p>

<h3><a name="faq12"><font face="Foreground Font">How do I change my screen resolution to
800x600 at 24bpp True Color to view the site ?</font></a></h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I discuss the procedures
to change your resolution I would like to warn you that both your video card and your
monitor must be capable of supporting a resolution of 800x600. If you are unsure about
this, find out first before you make any changes. The problem that can occur is that your
windows will start properly after you reboot but the screen will be too garbled to use and
you will not be able to see the interface to change the resolution back to one that is
useable. For windows 95/98 users, if you simply reboot in safe mode you will&nbsp; be able
to see the environment in a low resolution and will be able to change it back. This is not
meant to scare you or dissuade you from changing your resolution I just don't want to
cause problems for you. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as exactly what you are
changing I'm not going to go in-depth about it but to say that all you are changing is the
video mode with which you view your software on your monitor. Standard resolutions are
640x480, 800x600, and 1024x768. Most modern monitors should be able to go up to 1024x768
which is not needed for this site (800x600 is a lower resolution than 1024x768 but higher
than 640x480). I find a lot of people have their windows set to be viewed at 640x480 which
is a low resolution usually because it is the default setting and either they don't know
how to change it or don't know what the benefit will be. Basically the higher your
resolution the smaller things appear on the monitor and the more space you have to view.
If small icons and print bother you, you can usually set windows to use larger icons to
compensate. So whats the difference you say? Well 800x600 is a higher resolution than
640x480 as I said so all of your graphics will be more highly detailed and colorful. If I
have not satisfied your curiousity about this please feel free to send me an e-mail to ask
any questions before you make any changes and I'll be glad to discuss it further with you.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now to tell you how to make the
change: <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>To change your screen
resolution to 800x600 in Windows 95/98 follow these steps:</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I. Click the
&quot;start&quot; button on your tool bar and select &quot;settings&quot; and the
&quot;control panel&quot;....<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; II. Double click the
&quot;display&quot; icon...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; III. Click on the
&quot;settings&quot; tab...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IV. Under the heading
&quot;Desktop Area&quot; move the slider from left to right till 800x600 is displayed...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V. Next under the
heading &quot;Color Palette&quot; click on the dropdown menu and select &quot;True Color
(24bit)&quot;...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VI. Click &quot;ok&quot; and
if prompted reboot your computer.....&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VII. Thats it!! You can change your
video resolution to any combination you like this way, just be sure your video card<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
