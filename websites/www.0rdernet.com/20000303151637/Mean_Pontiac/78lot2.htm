of T-Tops and snowflake wheels. This particular paint scheme was actually an appearance
package offered about mid-year. It was given the option code Y88 and was called the Gold
Special Edition. Besides the Solar Gold paint the package also added unique bodystriping
and a new bird on the hood. Nothing changed cosmetically for the Trans Am between 77' and
78'. Most of the changes came in engine and tranny combinations, new colors, and new
equipment.</p>

    mufflers, and new aluminum exhausts pipes from the mainfold to the tailpipes. New Kelly
    Road Hugger tires were also added on Kragar Alloy wheels. On the inside this bird sports

    <td width="77%" height="161" valign="top" style="text-align: left; vertical-align: text-top">This white Trans Am was the first TA in
    a tradition of Firebird ownership for Eric Cerney. This bird came with the W72 option 400
    rated at 220hp and a 3.23 posi-trac rear end. Eric installed a shift kit in it and Rancho
    front and rear springs to lower it by 1½&quot;. These along with KYB gas shocks seriously
    improved the TAs handling. On the inside it was a traditionally well optioned car with
    power windows, power door locks, cruise control and a tilt wheel. Even though the car
    didn't come with a WS6 Performance Package Eric found and added a set of the cool aluminum
    15&quot;x8&quot; snowflake rims. Eric was only the second owner and according to him the
    car was beautiful and had never seen a bodyshop. Eric has had a long colletion of white
    TAs. He has owned a 95' Trans Am (check out the 95' Firebirds <a href="95lot1.htm">Lot#1</a>)
    and a 96' Trans Am (check out the 96' Firebirds <a href="96lot1.htm">Lot#1</a>). You can

<strong>&quot;I modified this car significantly myself. I added a 4-wheel 3.23 disc rear
end, a 700R4 4-speed automatic transmission bolted up to a fuel injected Pontiac 400
engine. I enhanced the WS6 handling package by putting 265-50s tires on the factory
8&quot; rims, by replacing the stock rubber front and rear suspension bushings with nylon
and steel. Also, the rubber sub-frame bushings were replaced with aluminum ones. The car
produced about 350HP and would probably do 0.86g on the skid pad.&quot; <br>

Beginning in 1977 Pontiac began to offer special packages on the Esprit to attract more
buyers. Each year the package was based on a specific color and named after it. The first
package in 77' was based on a baby blue color and was called the Bluebird. For 78' the
color changed to red and was called the Redbird. In 79' the color changed to yellow and
was called the Yellowbird. The package did not continue after the 79' year model. These
packages featured special decals on the sail panels, which looked a lot like more like a
bird than the hood birds, custom paint, and custom interiors all based on the theme color.

is a good picture of the Y88 Gold Special Edition Trans Am. T-Tops were originally
introduced into the Firebird's options group in 1976 on the 50th Anniversary Limited
Edition Trans Am. At that time the Tops were manufactured by Hurst. Hurst continued to
manufacture T-Tops into the 77' model year but during this same year Fisher also began to
manufacture them. By 1978 Fisher was the sole supplier of the glass tops. The two tops are
easily distinguishable from each other. The Hurst tops are smaller, the rear edge does not
completely extend to the sail panel and the glass was rimmed by a thick rib of chrome.
They also did not extend as far across the roof as the Fishers. Lastly they can easily be
identified by Hurst's logo etched into the glass which looks like this:&nbsp; <strong>H/H</strong>.
In contrast the Fisher tops are larger, they extend farther across the roof and all the
way to the sail panel. The edge is trimmed with a thin strip of dark metal. I believe the
color was achieved by anodizing the metal. Lastly these tops can be identified by locating
the word &quot;Fisher&quot; etched into the glass.<br>

the early 70s when color choices were limited to three or four the 78' year model brought
eight available colors to Trans Am fans. Besides the new colors and some changes to the
interior very little changed from the previous year. A tachometer became a standard part
of the gauge cluster and taillight bezels were now painted on all Trans Ams at midyear.<br>

post black and white photos on the site but this looks like it might have been an original
promotional photo, possibly used in some kind of advertisment. Another reason I like this
one is because the car is in motion which isn't usually the case with photos. Enjoy...<br>

Throughout the lots on this site I have placed various interesting or good quality pics of
Firebirds and tried to provide helpful information with each. It has been a great pleasure
to have had a few people write me to let me know their car is on the Gallery. Equally
pleasing is when I hear from a person who takes the time to pass on some information about
a specific picture to me that I can relate to you all. Such is the case with this picture.
Wayne Stegmiller wrote in and provided some very good, and interesting information as to
the story behind this car. Wayne writes:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><font size="3">&quot;While browsing your site, I noticed at the
bottom of the page 78lot2 you have a picture of a blue Trans Am that you were speculating
about. I have a little information about that car. It is actually a 1977 (It has the
honey-comb grills instead of the cross-hatch). It is a 6.6 Herb Adams Experimental Model
that is now owned by Pontiac Motor Division (thus the red license plate). The car actually
started to be developed by Adams in 1976, and was updated with the new nose in 77. Mods
include dry-sumps, oil cooler, solid suspension bushings, chromed roll bars, 180-degree
headers, Koni shocks, Pontiac 8 inch wide aluminum wheels, 4-wheel disc brakes,
high-effort steering, shortened springs, stiffer sway bars, special seats, and competion
harness. This car is one of 8. Pontiac wanted Adams to build 8 specially prepared Trans
Ams suitable for SCAA road racing. Pontiac wanted to do a clebrity match race with
similarly prepared cars. But SCAA wanted a lot of money to go ahead with it, and the 8
cars never did hit the track. These cars lead Herb Adams to start a company, VSE (Very
Special Equipment), which specialized in F-Body performance. They created the Fire Am and
a special Camaro (whose name escapes me right now). The main source for this is Firebird!
America's Premier Performance Car, The Complete History by Gary L. Witzenburg, Automobile
Quarterly Publications&nbsp; c1982. It's one of my favorite books regarding the Firebird
and I heartily recommend it.&quot;</font></strong></p>
