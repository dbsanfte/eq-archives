Rally IIs look as though they may have been chromed. This is a really cool looking
modification to a common set of wheels. With such a successful first year with the new
model there weren't many changes for the 71' lineup. The easiest way to distinguish a 71'
from a 70'&nbsp; are the non-functional fender louvers that were mounted on the fender
behind the wheel well.</p>

than the rest of the car, otherwise its a beautiful car. New highback bucket seats were
now the seat of choice in the Firebird interior replacing the previous years lowback
bucket seats. Engine options also changed for the Formula. The L30 350c.i. V8 was now the
standard powerplant. Optional motors included the L78 400c.i. 4bbl rated at 300hp, the L75
455c.i. 4bbl rated at 325hp, and the LS5 455 H.O. 4bbl rated at 335 hp. </p>

    <td width="77%" height="161" valign="top" style="text-align: left; vertical-align: text-top">As has been the case a few times during
    this update (much to my excitement) the owner of this car happened to be browsing the site
    and discovered his car was on it!! He wasted no time in sending me an e-mail to let me
    know it was his. The e-mail itself was funny because the subject line read: &quot;My Trans
    Am with the unnaturally high shaker scoop!!&quot;. Since I had no specific information on
    this car when I first added it to the site I used the space to tell people about the use
    of aftermarket carbs with the shaker scoop and how it usually made the scoop sit
    &quot;unnaturally high&quot;. Cash Mullen (the owner) was a good sport about it and told
    me just why the scoop was that way. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently these photos had been taken around April of 96' at a
    local dragstrip. If you squint and look closely you might see the slicks that were stuffed
    in the back seat. As for the scoop Cash writes:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;Anyway, the &quot;unnaturally high&quot; shaker can be
    attributed to the Edelbrock Performer RPM intake manifold that helps the car inhale its
    way down the dragstrip to a best of 11.84 @ 114.5 mph (so far).&nbsp; And that's at a
    hefty 3830 lb. race weight w/ me at the wheel.&quot;</strong>&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Thanks for straightening me out Cash!!</td>

were the only two color options from 1970 to 1972. Also the 455 H.O. was the only engine
available for the Trans Am during the 71 - 72 years. Thats such a shame don't you think...</p>

These Trans Ams cam with a distinctive &quot;455 H.O.&quot; decal, when optioned with the
powerful LS5 motor,&nbsp; that was located on either side of the shaker scoop. There was
nothing left to wonder for those terrified Ford, Chevy, and Mopar drivers in the other
lane. </p>

This Trans Am came equipped with &quot;Honeycomb&quot; wheels, named for the distinctive
pattern of the rim. New for 71' the ever popular honeycomb wheel was available in 15&quot;
for Firebirds and 14&quot; for other Pontiacs. The wheel's centers were painted with
molded urethane mounted on a steel backing. Unlike the Camaro, whose fender vents and
wheel spoilers were strictly cosmetic, the Trans Am fender air extractors and wheel well
spoilers were functional. They were designed to reroute air away from the wheels thereby
reducing friction during high speed driving. They were also designed to &quot;suck&quot;
the car down to the road during high speed driving. The trunk spoiler was also added for
this reason.</p>

An absolutely awesome looking black Ram Air Formula. When a Formula was manufactured with
the Ram Air option it received a functional hood versus the hoods that had block plates in
the scoops for non RA cars. A special &quot;dual-snorkel&quot; air cleaner was also
installed. When the hood was closed each of the snorkels would mate to a small circular
hole on the underside of the hood, at the end of each scoop, that allowed fresh cool air
to enter the air cleaner and carburetor. This was of course not the only modification
performed on the RA cars but one of the most noticeable. Many engine and suspension
upgrades were also added.<br>

This is not your average 71' Trans Am. The owner decided to do some mods to it to improve
its appearance. Its been lowered and 17&quot; aftermarket rims were installed. The frame
and firewall have been painted white to match the body color. Besides these interesting
mods some extra chrome was installed on the engine to jazz it up a bit.</p>

455HO Formula belongs to Jim Vari. Jim has spent 9 years restoring this Firebird and
wanted it to turn some heads. This particular car was built at the Norwood plant in Ohio
on April 6, 1971. Everything on it is new or rebuilt, including the functional Ram Air
hood that is so distinctive on these models. The only thing left is a new paint job which
will be applied this year. The rear is a stout 3.42 gear ratio. Jim also selected 50&quot;
series tires all around on the 15&quot; rims to provide an agressive look and a whole lot
of traction. Jim has been more than rewarded for his efforts with a best 1/4 mile time of
12.90. I'm sure new pics of the car will be posted here after the new paint is sprayed on
so keep an out for this one!!!<br>
