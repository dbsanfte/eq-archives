Ken's 1978 S.E. Trans Am</h1>

<p align="left"><br>
<br>
<font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My interest in
Pontiacs, (in particular 77-78 Trans Ams) started around 1980, when at the early age of 12
I saw what was probably the best advertising for a car, that any auto company could hope
for, in the movie Smokey and the Bandit. After watching this movie I always wanted a Trans
Am just like the one Burt Reynolds drove to fame. Years later I still wanted that Trans
Am, and in December 1987, I was given a subscription to Modern Motor magazine. The first
issue had an article about a guy in Sydney who specialised in importing American cars, any
type you wanted. All you had to do was list the condition, color, miles and so on and he
would find that exact car for you.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So after many years of reading all
the articles and magazines tests on Trans Ams I phoned this guy and gave him the details
of the exact Trans Am I wanted, which was at the time was a 1978 black and gold Trans Am.
He informed me that he actually had the car I was after but it was a 1977 Trans Am and had
just arrived in Sydney along with a 1970 440 Challenger and 1959 Cadilliac limo. The Trans
Am was actually imported for another guy, but he had just gone bankrupt so I got the car
instead, lucky me! I had trouble finding the address of the guy who was selling the T/A so
I phoned him from a gas station and he agreed to come and meet me there and then I could
follow him back to his house. Now I just thought he'd drive his regular car, but he
actually drove the T/A, when I saw it coming down the road with its black paint, gold
eagle and snowflake wheels sparkling in the sun it was love at first sight!. After
spending a hour checking the car over and taking it for a drive, we agreed on a price and
I was the proud owner of my first Trans Am. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wasn't aware at the time that the
Special Edition Trans Ams were a unique optional order which added a significant increase
in price over the regular Trans Am. It wasn't until a year after I bought my T/A that I
learned how to decode the Vin, trim tags and most importantly the build sheet (yes it was
still under the rear seat) before I realised that I actually had a Special Edition Trans
Am. So I guess in a way I was lucky to get the car I have now, and believe me I was really
pleased to find out that I had a genuine original Special Edition Trans Am. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My car is a one owner Californian
car with 79000 miles, Hurst T-Tops, A/C, Power Windows and rear console. It still has its
original paint and decals. I drove the car for about 18 months before having it converted
from left to right hand drive. It was actually more fun driving it LHD as people thought
nobody was driving (tilt steering pulled down low) as the car flashed by them with one
person sitting in the left side of the car. I've owned my T/A for 9 years now and I'll
never sell it, currently I'm building up a 400 Pontiac with the Edelbrock Performer RPM
package which will replace the original 403 Olds thats currently in the car. The Olds will
be stored and sealed so that I can re-install it if I want to return the car back to
original and over the past few years I've slowly been collecting all new GM parts (where
possible) to complete a full restoration on the car.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The T/A spends most of its time
garaged, but does come out during the summer months and it never fails to attract
attention or comments. I live in Torquay, Victoria which is situated on the coast and
right at the start of the Great Ocean Road, which is a fantastic road for cruising in a
car like the T/A. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For any questions or information
relating to my car or other Pontiacs in Australia feel free to contact me and I'll help
out where I can.</font></p>
