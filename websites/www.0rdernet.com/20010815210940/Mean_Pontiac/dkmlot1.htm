    <strong>&quot;I aquired my 1978 MACHO Trans Am #86 in April 1996. The VIN is 2W87Z8L148640
    It has a build date of March, second week (03B). It was originally Chesterfield Brown
    (code 69) and built at the Van Nuys plant in Southern CA. It was then sent to Mecham
    Pontiac in Glendale AZ where Dennis &amp; Kyle Mecham got a hold of it. There it was
    transformed into Macho Trans Am 1978-86. Since it already came from the factory with the
    WS6 suspension, other simple suspension modifications were done. The front springs were
    compressed and retampered, that lowered the front end 1.5 inches. Koni shocks were then
    placed at all four corners set on full soft. The front and rear ends received new bushings
    and mounts. Larger anti-sway bars were also added. I'm not sure just where or when the
    engine was replaced, but it has a 1971 YS coded block with #96 heads in it currently. It
    has just gone through a rebuild, that included an overbore of .060, Decked the block
    within 4-8 thousands. It has a Holley Street Dominator intake manifold with a Holley 600
    carb.. Coated Tri-Y headers exit the exhaust. The front nose was also replaced at some
    point, currently a 1979 front nose and front spoiler sit on it. The exterior of the car
    has been 'shake canned' black and the gold Macho graphics added, although it looks bad,
    they didn't paint over the numbers on the side of the vehicle just under the Trans Am name
    on the fenders and on the rear spoiler. The Macho graphoc on the rocker panels were
    however painted over. There is a brushed aluminum plate on the console that reads: Macho
    T/A- A limited series grand touring Trans Am built for the enthusiast by DKM, Inc. A
    design performance company. Macho No. 78-86. I picked my Macho up for $2500. The Macho had
    aftermarket T-tops cut into it, and some real bad rust on the right rear quarter panel,
    witch was cut off. It is in need of a paint job and 1978 front end. The car originally had
    a Camel Tan custom interior (62B), but I am in the process of redoing it in black. This
    Macho is fully documented! Check out my documentation at the bottom of the page. It shows
    the car being delivered to Mecham Pontiac. I have also received some documentation from a
    fellow Trans Am Tribe member, that documents the modifications that were done to the Macho
    and by whom!&quot;<br>

    <p>Thats right folks this ones a turbo. And you thought turbos didn't come out till 79'.
    Not if you bought a Macho TTA. This one comes with the ever aggressive looking black and
    gold paint and a tan interior. The car comes equipped with a 400c.i. engine, a 4-speed and
    of course the turbo unit installed by DKM. The car is in rough shape but it is the last
    Turbo Macho built for 1978.<br>

    <strong>&quot;Here is the story about how I acquired old number 7. I saw an ad in our
    local trader paper for a 1979 Trans Am, modified, not running - $3,900. I was curious so I
    called the owner. He said it was modified by some company called &quot;DKM&quot; and he
    didn't know too much about it. Immediately my ears perked up and I started asking
    questions like, &quot;Is there anything in the way of graphics on the car?&quot;. He told
    me it said &quot;MACHO T/A&quot; and it had a number &quot;7&quot;. I really got
    interested when he said it also said &quot;TURBO&quot;. By this time I was salavating, but
    I kept my composure long enough to ask what was wrong with it. He said the last time he
    drove it about 7 years ago smoke was coming out the exhaust so he thought the timing gear
    had gone out. He admitted he was no mechanic, but he attempted to fix it himself. It never
    ran again. I asked how soon I could come out and see it and he said &quot;How about
    today?&quot;. &quot;Great!&quot;. When I got to the barn where it was stored I saw a
    dirty, but MINT 79 MACHO TURBO TA with 16,000 original miles. It was gold and had a Doug
    Nash 5 speed, a roll bar, Scheel seats and all the other DKM goodies. What a find! Again,
    I kept my composure and ask how much less he would take for a car that obviosly needed
    repairs. He was fairly firm, but would take $3,700 cash. Sold! After rebuilding the turbo
    and putting the distributor back in correctly (it was 180 degrees off), it fired up on the
    first try! He had kept the motor well lubricated so it ran fine. After some cosmetic
    clean-up I had a beautiful and rare TA that is an example of one of the best muscle cars
    available from the late 70's.&quot;</strong><br>

    first Pontiac and hopefully not my last. The first car I fell in love with was a brand new

    <strong><font size="3">This is Macho T/A number 19 of 98 cars produced in 1979. This
    rust-free Arizona car was originally Mayan Red with a white stripe, but a previous owner
    painted it red with a silver stripe. It has Dark Carmine custom cloth interior and needs
    some work, but the clock still works and the seats are in good condition. The car has the
    original W72 400/4-speed and has 54,800 miles on the odometer. The W72 option required the
    WS6 suspension and this included the 15x8-inch aluminum snowflake wheels, four-wheel disc
    brakes, larger anti-sway bars and quicker steering, to which DKM added new front coils and
    Koni adjustable shocks. DKM also modified the engine including opening the shaker and
    adding Hooker headers. The dual cat exhaust added by DKM is gone and the car now has a
    dual muffler exhaust. Thanks...&quot;</font></strong></p>

    <p>For those of you who do not know let me take the opportunity to explain the meaning of
    the acronyms associated with these cars. In the late 70's two brothers got together and
    started modifing production TAs for customers much as SLP is currently doing for the WS6
    Ram Air cars. The finished cars were dubbed Macho TAs and were numberd since they were a
    limited production car every year. The company formed by the two brothers was called DKM
    which simply stood for Dennis and Kyle Mecham. The initials of the brothers names. The
    program was continued beginning in 1982 (after a one-year absence in 1981) but the name of
    the company was changed as well as the designation given to its cars. MR stands for
    Mecham's Racing and was the new name of the company. MSE stands for Motor Sports Edition
    (as seen on the door of this car) and was the new name given to the cars that had been
    modified by MR.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    If you are intersted in these cars or want to learn more about this interesting part of
    Pontiac history I would highly recommend you go to the <a href="http://www.tatribe.com/Mecham.htm">Mecham Hompage</a>. Here you will find a generous
    amount of information on the history and production of the DKM and MR MSE cars. You'll
    find info from articles printed from various magazines after the original test drives as
    well as part-one and two of the two part story recently published by <a href="http://www.cskpub.com/HPPtoc.html">High Performance Pontiac</a> on the history of
    the Mecham brothers and there cars.</td>

    <p>This MSE TA has only 4,500 miles on it. It was built with most of the options available
    in 83' including Motorla stereo, Lear-Seagler leather seats, the GIT KIT, T-Tops, and a
    Doug Nash 5-speed.<br>
    <br>
    Gary is quite the Pontiac fanatic and collector with a collection totalling 11 cars. His
    expansive collection includes: <br>
    a 76' 50th Anniversary Trans Am 455 4-speed (see the 76' Firebirds <a href="76lot1.htm">Lot#1</a>),
    <br>
    a 79' 10th Anniversary Trans Am (see the 79' Firebirds <a href="79lot1.htm">Lot#1</a>), <br>
    an 80' Trans Am Pace Car, <br>
    a seldom seen 81' Nascar Edition Pace Car with only 4,000 miles (see the 81' Firebirds <a href="81lot1.htm">Lot#1</a>), <br>
    an 83' Daytona Pace Car, <br>
    an 84' 15th Anniversary Trans Am, <br>

    <p>Mike purchased this car in 1996 for $3,800. The car has 81,000 original miles. It comes
    equipped with the L-69 2.8L V-6 2bbl HO, a 5-speed manual transmision, the WS6 Special
    Performance Package and all available power options. The car is also equipped with
    California emmissions and was sold by Wood Pontiac in Santa Rosa California. Mike writes:<br>
    <br>
    <strong>&quot;Wood owned the dealership, and remembers ordering the car. The car was
    shipped to Mecham Racing in Glendale, Arizona. I have never seen or heard of any 1983
    L-69, 5-speed Mecham Racing cars sold in Calif that year! California wouldn't let in these
    HO cars in until 1984. If anyone knows of a 1983 HO ,5-spd car in Calif, please let me
    know!&quot;</strong><br>
