    <td width="77%" height="161" valign="top" style="text-align: left; vertical-align: text-top">This Trans Am is 1 of 3 rare TAs owned
    by Eric &amp; Kim Vickers. There were only 1,286 Trans Ams built and sold in 1972.
    Although I'm unsure of the exact figure it is fairly common knowledge among serious
    Firebird fans that the Lucerne Blue paint scheme was only applied to a few of these cars
    making this particluar year/paint combo one of the more rare TAs to be had. Eric &amp;
    Kim's car comes with a black interior, 455 H.O., M22 4-speed, an AM/FM stereo, and a rear
    defogger. The car has only 50,000 miles racked up on the odometer and is 100% numbers
    matching. Even the spark plug wires are the originals, datecoded for 72'. Eric and Kim
    also own a 1970 Ram Air IV Trans Am (see 70' Firebirds <a href="70lot1.htm">Lot#1</a>),
    and a 69' Ram Air IV Trans Am (see the 69' Trans Ams <a href="69talot1.htm">Lot#1</a>).<br>

offered by the Factory. This is an SCCA Trans Am. When I get more information on the
history of this car I'll add it here. Its a shame Pontiac didn't offer this paint scheme.
It looks pretty good to me. The car appears to be in otherwise stock trim with the
standard 455 H.O., honeycomb wheels and factory interior.<br>

TA with the trademark white with a blue stripe paint job. Like the 71' model versus the
70' model there were very few changes for the 72' Trans Am lineup. The only noticeable
cosmetic change for the new model was replacing the square mesh grill with a new hex mesh
grill. </p>

production run of the 70 - 73 bodystyle. The 73' Brewster Green Trans Am sitting next to
it is also a rare TA. The 455 H.O. remained the only engine option available although the
horsepower rating changed to 300hp.</p>

These awesome cars easily prove why they have been labeled the most &quot;muscular&quot;
looking of the muscle cars. Wheel options flip flopped for the 72' model. Honeycombs had
been the standard wheel in 71 with the Rally IIs serving as an option. The reverse was
true for 72'. Only 458 Trans Am were built with manual trannys in 72 and 885 were built
with automatics. Either way this year TA makes for a rare car.</p>

The rear window on the early second generation Trans Ams differed from later models in
that it did not &quot;wrap&quot; around the rear quarter panels. The new design in later
models would increase visibility out the back window to improve safety. </p>

This white 455 H.O. Trans Am has Rally II center caps that are blacked out. They were
usually colored red. The long smooth doors, fenders and quarter panels that gave the cars
such a graceful fluid look were highly susceptible to damage from parking lot door
&quot;dings&quot;. The doors also tended to sag from their immense wait through the years.
This&nbsp;is a chronic problem with second gen TAs.</p>

    11,415 built during 1972 and Andrew Benzie is proud to call it his. Andrew's parents
    purchased the car new back in 1972 when he was only 4 years old. The car served as the
    family daily driver injecting Pontiac excitement into their lives till Andrew and his
    brother got old enough to start high school. The car was driven by both brothers during
    those years but its Andrew's car now. He wasted no time in &quot;re-feathering&quot; the
    old bird as he likes to call it. New paint was applied in 1987 (its still on the car), the
    tranny was rebuilt in 1991, and the engine got an overhaul in 1996. Most recently the A/C
    has been replaced along with the heater core, the windsheild, the brakes, and new
    mufflers. Other than the new paint with racing stripes, a set of Rally IIs and new tires,
    and a Trans Am rear decklid spoiler the car is still outfitted the way it was the day it
    rolled off the assmebly line.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;I talked to the guy I bought the car from and he
says the color is a mixture of Viper Blue and the original Lucerne Blue. He was the guy
that painted it. He was going to buy a house with his girlfriend and needed $$$$ for the
down payment so he was selling the car. I ran into him when settlement was close so I
kinda stole it from him. I entered it in a local car show right after I bought it and took
second place out of 5 muscle cars in the show. I found out I lost to a beautiful 65 GTO
and only lost to him by 2 votes. I am looking for the correct 455 HO intake and exhaust
now. I have the HO heads and and want to make it more original. It has a turbo 400 trans
and a 10 bolt 3.42 rear. It has a little more cam than I want in it right now but when I
get the heads ready I'll change that too. I am also trying to find the correct carb. You
would think these things would be easy to find with this internet thing but it hasn't
helped much so far. My last muscle car before this was a '65 GTO my brother has right now.
We just finished Pro-Streeting it cause he wanted it that way. It turned out real nice. He
added Fiberglass fenders hood trunk and bumpers and left the Pontiac engine in it (at
least so far) He says if it lets go he will put a 502 Chevy in it next. He let the car sit
7 years with the engine on a stand and it started before it turned over 3 times. No knocks
no smoke. I am 39 years old and used to be a Pontiac Dealer mechanic between 1978 and
1982. After that I became a diesel mechanic for the bus system in Wash DC. Now I do
building maintenance for the subway system in DC. (same company). Oh By the way I bought a
1980 Trans Am new in 1980 so this is the second one I have had. Thanks for the email. I'll
send more pics if I ever take them.&quot;</strong></p>

    I think only once before on this site have I posted six pictures of a single Firebird.
    This particular Trans Am was also just too nice to try and display with just five. Its
    really in incredible condition. Its owner is Greg Johnson. Greg writes:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;This car had 13,000 miles and was stored inside
    since the 70's. It was restored in 1990, not that the car needed it, but the owner was a
    perfectionist. When I saw the car it was under inches of dust and it just needed to be
    cleaned up. I told him I wanted it but he told me it was not for sale; but I proved him
    wrong because everything has a price. He also had a '73 4-spd. super duty all original.
    This car is one of the best I have seen, not just because its mine, but I looked at about
    1500 cars in 5 years that where supposed to be perfect 10 cars which where not 10's at
    all. I even looked at the Trans Am Nats. for a few years. Not saying mine is the best but
    it has done good at the Trans Am Nats. and everyone loves it! Thanks for your time and
    your knowledge.&quot;</strong><br>
