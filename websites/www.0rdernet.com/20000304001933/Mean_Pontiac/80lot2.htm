new. Its never seen rain or snow!! The bird even still has its original paint job. The
engine, however, is another matter. Dean yanked out the original underpowered engine and
replaced it with a 400c.i. engine from a 72' GTO. The original wheels were also replaced
with a set of gold Cragar SS mags. This Firebird is definitely not short on looks and I'll
bet the 400 provides a nice surprise to would-be opponents.&nbsp; </p>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="3"><strong>&quot;This is my 1980 Turbo Trans Am. It's
    an original car, with only 26,000 original miles on it. My parents bought in new in the
    fall of 1980. It was an anniversary gift from my dad to my mom that year (atta boy dad).
    It's Carousel Red, code #79, which was actually a 1960's Pontiac color. I have seen very
    few of them in this era (1979-81). The car is used sparingly of late, mostly due to my
    attending graduate school for my MBA. It's in nice original shape. Every year, I improve
    it and take care of small details that make the car look better and better (painting
    mouldings, replacing small trim, etc.). It has PS, PB, PW, rear defog, snowflakes, A/C
    (required with the Turbo 301), am/fm stereo cassette (I have the original), and the Turbo
    LU8 301. I have most of the original paperwork (I had the window sticker reproduced),
    including most bills dating back to 1980, and the business card of the sales manager that
    sold us the car. (The dealer is still in business). The car is a blast to drive and is
    definitely a keeper. Everywhere I go, I get comments and thumbs up on this car. People
    can't believe it when they see it. I get, &quot;so you are the guy with that Orange T/A
    I've seen around here...&quot;. Right now I'm seeking a 1979 Silver anniversary or Black
    S/E to add to my collection (must be a 400 with all options and #s matching)....so if
    you've got one in the NY, NJ, PA, or CT area let me know! Also if you want to chat 2nd gen

This was a special package offered from 1977 to 1980 on the Firebird Esprit. Each year
featured a different color scheme. Ray Strickland owns this all original mint example of
the offering in 1980. Ray writes:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><font size="3">&quot;Hi! Attached is a photo of my 1980
&quot;Yellowbird&quot;, which I purchased in May of 1998. At the time of purchase, it was
a one-owner vehicle with 47000 actual miles. It was a &quot;pleasure vehicle&quot; for the
owners. They only took it out on weekends when the weather was good. In the winter, they
stored it in a barn. Up until the '98-'99 season, it had never seen snow or road salt. The
body is in immaculate condition. It is an Esprit model, with the original 4.9L engine.
Four-barrel carb, no turbo, but still beats the pants off any 6-cylinder sport utility
vehicle, which has turned my yuppie neighbors yellow with envy. The paint and decals are
all original equipment. I have changed the alternator and fuel pump, and the previous
owner had recently changed the starter and the brake master cylinder. Most of the
interiorvinyl and upholstery is original. The carpet is a little worn and needs
replacement... big deal. Note the matching cast-aluminum wheels. I have only heard of one
other Yellowbird here in Indy; a T-top model suffering from rust damage.&quot;</font></strong></p>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="3"><strong>&quot;The 1980 Trans Am Pace Car was
    purchased for $750. The original 301 Turbo motor is gone, and a 4bbl 301 out of an 81
    Bonneville sits in its place. I had originally purchased it as a parts car for my other
    projects, but I don't have the heart to tear it apart. The interior is in amazingly good
    shape, the body's really straight, and except for the turbo, it's a very complete,
    unmodified car. It'd been wrecked pretty hard in the front, and all the damaged body
    pieces replaced with new sheet metal, but I'm afraid the subframe needs to be replaced.
    Since the original engine's long gone, when I swap the subframe, I'll probably drop a 400
    in, apply new paint and decals, and use it as a driver.&quot;<br>
