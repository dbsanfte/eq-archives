    <td width="77%" height="161" valign="top" style="text-align: left; vertical-align: text-top">This base model silver Firebird is
    owned by James Gold. The Firebird was originally purchased by James' dad in 1977. James
    took over ownership of it in 1996. After a lot of years of use the old bird was getting
    tired with rust and some engine problems. So a complete rebuild was in order. James and
    his father began and did what they could but the final work was performed by a local shop.
    It now sits here in almost completely restored condition. The car still retains its
    original 231c.i. V6 which was rated at 105hp. Its also equipped with power steering, power
    brakes, and Safe-T-Track rear. James writes,<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;My car might not be
    as quick off the line as a TA, but it will go a whole lot farther on one 21 gallon tank
    than a gas guzzling TA. It looks and sounds good too, not to mention <i>very</i>
    comfortable with the real sheepskin seat covers.&quot;</strong><br>

    unusual entry in that it doesn't specifically focus on a car but in the interest of
    improving security and providing ideas for all of you Firebird owners out there I have
    included it here on the site. This modification was performed by Chris Paveglio on a
    previously owned TA and he is credited for the pictures and the dialog below. Chris
    writes:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;I promised some pix of my &quot;Secret
    Stealth&quot; stereo system for my 77 TA, and here they are. Numbered 1-5, in a sort of
    transformation order. The 8 track and push button am/fm stereo were removed and gutted. In
    their place is a Sony CD player (removable face) and Sony cassette deck. The old 8 track
    frame was kept, and ground down to just the mounting holes, and the cassette deck mounted
    on. The radio was a rather straightforward installation. The old front panels from the
    stereo were reassembled and glued together, and attached with velcro (CD face) and pegs
    (tape deck). Voila! The ultimate in car stereo security! No one would ever know what's
    there unless you showed them. The speakers were also beefed up. In the center of the dash
    are 2 - 4&quot; Boston Acoustics, on a special mount ( I had to heat and re-mold the air
    conditioning ducts to make room), BA tweeters in the door panel where the Firebird emblem
    is (was) painted to match the vinyl color. In the rear are 2 - 6x9 Eclipse 3-ways, powered
    by a Rockford Fosgate punch40i. Again, stock grille covers, painted original color, and no
    markings of any kind. This setup really rocked! and it was clear and clean power (no urban
    boomer car). The trunk space really helped to boost bass, and at all engine speeds the
    stereo was crisp and tuned just right. I really think the sound was better than my new
    93's stereo!&quot;</strong><br>
    <br>
    Thanks Chris for taking the time to provide this for the site!!</td>

Bandit&quot;, the Bandit Special Edition black and gold Trans Am would become one of the
most popular, most well known muscle cars of all time. The movie and the car generated an
almost cult-like following. The movie and its popularity didn't hurt sales either. There
were more Trans Ams sold in 77' and 78' than any year before, 93,351 to be exact. The
movie was my own personal &quot;first-exposure&quot; to these awesome cars and probably
like many other youths at the time I vowed I would own one someday.</p>

Heres an interesting pic of a 77' Limited Edition Trans Am. Two engines were offered for
the Trans Am in 77'. The L78 Pontiac 400 rated at 180hp or the W72 Pontiac 400 rated at
200hp. Trans Ams built in California came only with the L80 Oldsmobile 403 rated at 185hp.
The Oldsmobile mill was only available to California and high altitude TAs. Also if a
4-speed was wanted the W72 400 was the only engine that could be had. An interesting fact
about these confusing engine combos (and sometimes an easy way to tell what you've got) is
that the L78 and L80 (Olds) TAs received a &quot;<strong>6.6 LITRE</strong>&quot; decal on
the shaker scoop while the more powerful W72 built TAs received a &quot;<strong>T/A 6.6</strong>&quot;
decal on the shaker scoop. <br>

    This very cool black Formula is owned by Daniel Chamness. He picked it up for the low
    price of $2,500 with only 34,000 miles showing on the odometer. After purchase he drove it
    for about a year without a single problem until deciding to start working on improvements.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><font size="3">&quot;My name is Daniel Chamness and this
    is my 1977 Firebird Formula. I am 16 years old and have had this car for 2 years. I live
    on a farm and have a very limited budget, so I don't get to put many accessories on my
    car. But having the car for 2 years, I was able to do many little projects and a couple
    large projects to make this car look and perform well. It has the W-72 performance
    package, which includes the T/A 6.6 litre engine. It came with the 4-speed and 3.23 gears.
    I was sick and tired of hearing about this hot Porsche 911 that was storming around town,
    so I HAD to do something about it. I put in a Comp Cams 270H cam, an Edelbrock Performer
    intake manifold, and summit headers. I guess I'm running 375-400 HP. It sure shut him up.
    I added Eagle alloy 028 series wheels on it. 7&quot; on front, and 10&quot; on back. I
    hope to one day get around to put in the Ford 9-inch that I got laying around and put in
    4.11 gears. If anybody knows how many '77 Formulas were made with the W-72 perf. package,
    please send me an email.&quot;</font></strong><font SIZE="2">&nbsp; <br>
