Trans Am with T-Tops and &quot;turbo&quot; rims color matched to the body color. For the
first time since its introduction a non-Pontiac motor served as the standard powerplant
for the Trans Am. The oldsmobile 403 that had been offered in previous years and had been
mandatory for California cars was now the standard engine installed in the Trans Am.
However Pontiac held on and offered two Poncho motors as options. The first was the anemic
and ill-fated 4.9L (301) V-8. The second was the 6.6L W72 (400). The W72 motors were
actually leftovers blocks manufactured during the 78' model year expressly for this
purpose. </p>

400 is mated to an M21 Muncie close ratio 4-speed manual tranny. The rear is geared at
3.23 with a limited slip posi-traction differential. This TA was a recipient of the
optional WS6 Performance Package and comes equipped with 4 wheel disc brakes, T-Tops, all
power options including Power Door Locks &amp; Power Trunk (even a power antenna), A/C,
rear defogger, and a tilt wheel. The interior is black and the car was assembled in Van
Nuys, CA where it was then shipped to Fort Wayne, IN. The birds odometer currently only
has 53,000 miles as of Oct 97'.<br>

the Firebird. The rest of the body remained the same. Gone was the traditional
split-grille in favor of a nose more stylish and modern. The headlights were now
seperated, encased in seperate recesses which provided a very flowing and aerodynamic
look. The rear was also radically altered. The familiar ribbed tailights were transformed
into something that now looked like one piece stretching from one side of the car to the
other. The new tail was entirely dark plastic with no charachteristic metal frame. The
number of ribs were increased dramatically from 3 to 7 and moved closer together which
gave the rear a space age look. </p>

    option instead of standard equipment. The &quot;formula&quot; steering wheel was back as
    standard equipment replacing the luxury wheel used in 78'. The Rally gauge cluster became
    standard and the engine-turned dash panel replaced the wood-grain panel installed in
    previous year models. Standard tires also changed to 225/70R15 on rally II rims. </td>

This diagram was provided to me by Phil Pollard. Its a graphical representation of how the
Formula hood evolved from 1969 to 1981. A recent discussion about which hood was correct
for what year model on the Pontiac E-Mail List proved that several people were somewhat
confused as to which hood WAS appropriate for what year. As a result Phil drew up this
diagram and forwarded it to me to display for you. Thanks Phil...<br>

A 10th Anniversary cruising the streets; doing what it was meant to do. A limited number
of these cars were dressed up as Daytona 500 Pace Cars and one of them actually paced the
1979 Daytona 500. 7,500 10th Anniversary Trans Ams would see production by the end of 79.

Steve Buttita. As you can see it underwent a complete restoration in 1991. He purchased it
in 1989 from the original owner for $3450. Its equipped with the factory original 4.9L 301
4bbl engine. According to Steve even though the car had been in Wisconsin for ten years it
had never been driven during the winter. Despite the good care the car received the paint
Pontiac used during these years was defective and the original owner had it repainted by
the dealer. The paint job was less than stellar and the hood bird was not replaced. The
first year he owned the car Steve installed a complete set of Goodyear Eagle ST
P245/60R15s. He also went to the local Pontiac dealer and purchased a complete set of
decals that he was able to pick up at cost through a friend, including the hood bird, for
$375. Shortly thereafter the car was sent to the bodyshop where all the spoilers and
flares were removed and the body was stripped to bare metal. Amazingly no rust was found
during the process. The project took only a month to complete at a cost of $4,000. Fred

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;I was proud to bring
home the car you see here.&nbsp; I still own this car, and it currently has 90,000 miles
on it.&nbsp; This car does not leave the garage on cloudy days, has only been rained on
one time since I had it redone, and gets washed with a hose only once a year to get the
winter dust off.&nbsp; During the months that the car is off jackstands, I clean it with
McGuire's Detail Spray and cloth diapers.&nbsp; I believe that the dryer your car stays,
the less likely for rust to develop anywhere on it, not just the parts you see.&quot;</strong><br>

Fred is webmaster for another prominent Firebird site and, I think, an important one. Its
called <a href="http://www.execpc.com/~steveb/taresult.html">The Trans Am Registry</a>.
Its open to all Firebirds as is my site. If you've never visited this site you might want
to take the time to stop by and register your bird.</p>

cool Trans Am is owned by Tom Woody. The original engine has been trasnplanted with a 400
mill from a 78' Trans Am. Transmission of choice is a rebuilt TH400. Note the chrome
sidepipes that have been installed. A fairly common modification several years ago.</p>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;&nbsp;I bought this
    car in Feburary of 1993 for $1500 dollars. I didn't have my license at the time, so it was
    quite a bore to watch the car sit in the driveway for 4 months. But June finally rolled
    around and I was tearing up the streets of Hillsborough in my hot rod. My car, unknown to
    me at the time, had a lot of problems. I needed to have the transmission and rear rebuilt
    before the end of the summer of '93, the paint was in horrible shape, and little things
    were starting to break. To date, I have spent almost $3500 on my car, but it has been well
    worth it.&quot;</strong> &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Clay's TA has the Olds 403 mill installed in the engine bay and is basically stock with a
    Rochester 4bbl carburetor. Clay intends to install a different engine in the
    future.&nbsp;The tranny is also the stock unit; a TH350 that has been rebuilt. Clay has
    also installed a B&amp;M shift kit, a worked vavle body, and a new converter with a
    2500rpm stall speed.&nbsp;A Hurst V-Matic ratchet shifter handles the shifting duties. Out
    back resides a beefy Dana 60 10 bolt posi-trac rear that had been installed by the
    previous owner complete with 3:73 gears. The tires motivating this Firebird are Goodyear
    Eagle ST 255/60X15s. Other installed goodies include a set chrome Lakewood traction bars,
    a true dual exhaust, and front disc brakes. According to Clay the car has run in the 15s. <br>

    <td width="77%" height="161" valign="top" style="text-align: left; vertical-align: text-top">This interesting car was a concept car
    built by PMD. It was labled as the &quot;K&quot; car for Kammaback. The car never saw
    production but two models were specially constructed in Italy for GM's&nbsp; Design vice
    president David Holls. The concept was to put out a Firebird station wagon that would
    provide a performance car to the public. The write-up that is the fourth picture gives a
    good description of the origin of the car. As I found out more information on these unique
    cars it will be posted here. Pontiac repeated the attempt with another &quot;K&quot; car
    in 1986. You can see it on the 86' Firebirds <a href="86lot1.htm">Lot#1</a>.</td>
