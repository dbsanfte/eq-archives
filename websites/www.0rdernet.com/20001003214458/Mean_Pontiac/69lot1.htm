Brian Fates unique gold Firebird 400 Coupe bears a very interesting story. The bird has a
black vinyl roof, auto tranny, deluxe tan interior, a high watt aftermarket stereo system,
power steering, tilt wheel, a fold down rear seat, disk brakes, A/C, and aftermarket
aluminum rims. The car was bought with 60,000 miles and an ugly brown paint job. It now
shows 75,000 miles and it probably about as interesting a 15k miles as any owner has
likely seen. Brian drives the Firebird daily except in the Nebraska winters where he
lives. <br>
<br>
Brian hosts his own personal web page where you can read about the incredible story this
gentleman has gone through with his car. <a href="http://www.creighton.edu/~fate/int.html">Click

Tom writes:<br>
<br>
<strong>&quot;I found the car in Canada in a farmers barn.&nbsp; The only thing that had
been done to it since it was new was a paint job about 12 years ago (it was stored in
mothballs for the past 10 years).&nbsp; After I got the car I pulled all the dead mice out
of it, replaced the original spiral shock absorbers, put in a new rear main, rebuilt the
tranny, replaced the bias ply tires, gave the carb a little tune and fired away!</strong> <strong>Great
car.&nbsp; Only 54 Firebirds (per my info from the Pontiac Historical Society) were made
in 69 with leather interiors.&nbsp; They were also the ONLY Birds prior to the 10th
anniversary T/A in 79' that ever got leather.&nbsp; There are no records to indicate how
many of the leather cars were coupes and how many convertibles. It has to be pretty rare,
though.&nbsp; Any comments from readers with leather info would be greatly
appreciated.&quot; <br>

John Marshall Sr. The car was purchased in San Diego California, is completely original
and rust free. It comes equipped with a 400c.i. engine, automatic transmission, console,
power steering, power brakes, AM/FM radio with a console mounted 8-track tape player, wood
grain sport steering wheel, tilt column, a hood tach, power top, fold down rear seat,
rally II wheels, rally clock, a power trunk release, space saver spare tire, remote

only one in the family with a 1st generation Firebird; John's son (John Marshall Jr) owns
a 67' Firebird (see the 67 section). John gave his son the car under the premise that his
son must always take care of it. I'm sure John Jr will have little trouble fulfilling that
request.</p>

    When George bought the car it had been &quot;laid to rest&quot;, with only 69,000 miles on
    the odometer, in an abandoned spot in a yard where time and the weather took its toll.
    After getting it home, a new engine was the first modification performed. A 350 4bbl was
    to provide this bird with new life. George was in the process of beginning a full makeover
    on the car when he made the decision to sell it to help finance his new business - <a href="http://gspatton.home.mindspring.com/">GT Transmissions</a>.<br>
    <br>
    George has a website for his new business. If your in the Georgia area and need some

    Firebird 350 convertible. They found the (then a white Firebird) car at a cruise at Roy
    Rogers in Waterbury. After they purchased it they decided to perform a restoration on it.
    They were surprised to find the car had tons of bondo. So a frame off restoration was
    started that would last three years. New quarter panels were bought and installed, &nbsp;
    and the body underwent a complete restoration. John performed all the work himself with
    Elaine's moral support for help. Year One in Georgia provided most of the hard to get
    parts. The car retains its original 265hp YE 350c.i. 2bbl engine and 2-speed tranny. It
    also comes with power steering, power brakes, a power top, and factory rally II wheels.
    The green interior with bucket seats maintains its originality but the paint was replaced
    with a 94 - 95 Pontiac Dark Yellow-Green provide by&nbsp; Sickens. John says that he and
    the wife just LOVE cruising this bird around with the top down. Gee John I just can't
    imagine why.<br>
