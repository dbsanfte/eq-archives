installing similiar packages on Camaros till several years later and it would be quite a
while before the Cobra would show up. Red was the only color option for a Firehawk in 92'.</p>

    <td width="77%" height="161" valign="top" style="text-align: left; vertical-align: text-top">This 1 of 1 Arctic White Firehawk #25
    is owned by Michael Wempe. This Firehawk is a truely unique Firebird. It is the only 92'
    model painted Artic White, the only one with T-Tops, the only one with a full roll cage
    and only one of two to receive SLP's Super Duty 366c.i. all aluminum racing block. This
    rare and unusual mill is rated at 375 horspower and a stump pulling 400lb/ft of torque.
    Figures reminiscent of the late 60s early 70s blocks. Installed in a car weighing 3200lbs
    to say this makes for an exciting ride is an understatement!! So what tranny is mated to
    such a beast. In keeping with the all out performance design of the rest of the car a
    6-speed ZF transmission with a carbon fiber clutch were installed to provide lethal
    shifting. Out back a Dana 44 rear end ensures ALL the power gets to the ground. To handle
    all the torque a beefed up Level III suspension was also installed by SLP along with a set
    of front springs from a 301 Turbo TA to accommodate the lighter aluminum block. Other
    interesting perks about this Firehawk include a hood that is aluminum and a relocated
    battery. Ronal 17x9.5&quot; aluminum wheels equipped with the trademark Firehawk SZ
    P275/40ZR17 tires provide monster meathooks for plenty of grab. With all this power what
    about the brakes you say? How about a set of Power Brembo F-40 disc brakes!! These are
    good for 60mph to 0 in an incredible 110'. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the inside dual Recaro seats
    provide comfortable seating for any driving. Each one comes with a 5-point harness to make
    sure you stay in the seat. The back seat has been deleted to reduce weight. Not all the
    creature comforts have been abandoned though. You'll find an AM/FM stereo with a built in
    CD player, air conditioning, power steering and dual airbags. With this kind of equipment
    the car is not only a rare bird but one that could hold its own on any track.<br>
    <br>
    This is not the only Firebird Michael owns. In fact he has quite a nice collection of
    them. An ultra-rare 68' Ram Air II convertible, a 68' Ram Air I coupe, and a 68'
    non-original Ram Air I coupe. (see the 68' Firebirds <a href="68lot2.htm">Lot#2</a>).

&nbsp; Only 663 Trans Am convertibles were built in1992 and this is one of them. The
convertible optioned was reintroduced in 1991 and a Trans Am had not been available as a
convertible since 1969 and of course being the most famous of TAs only eight of those were
built. Three engines were available for the TA in92': the best of the bunch was the 5.7L
rated at 240hp followed by two 5.0Ls rated at 205hp and 230hp.</p>

Firebird is one of three that have been owned by Jim Scialabba. Jim writes:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;It was a fantastic car. Never had a day of
problems.. This particular bird was factory painted Light Grey Jade Metallic. It was
claimed that it was only one of a handful registered in the state of Illinois. I was at
Busse Woods when I saw some of the newer 4th gen cars cruisin' by when I suddenly felt
outclassed. I stood up on a bench with beer in hand and vowed to own one of those. So that
Fall I traded in the trusty '92 (with only 24K miles on it) for a shiny new 1995.&quot;<br>
<br>
</strong>Sounds like a familiar dilemma huh...<br>
<br>
Jim is a true lover of Pontiacs. The '95 Firebird he mentions can be seen at the '95
Firebirds<a href="95lot2.htm"> Lot#2</a>. However even that car was to fall victim to the
same situation when Jim recently traded it in on the car he currently owns, a black '98
LS1 Formula. It can be seen at the '98 Firebirds <a href="98lot1.htm">Lot#1</a>.<br>
<br>
Jim also hosts his own website named <a href="http://www.geocities.com/MotorCity/Downs/4107/">Jim's Firebird Page</a>. Stop by and
visit if you'd like. </p>

Paul Morosin owns this red convertible Firebird. Paul writes:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><font size="3">&quot;Well, my car is a 92 Firebird...TBI
engine rated at 170hp from the factory. Only 700 were built with the automatic and TBI
engine. It has only 62,000km or 39,000 Miles. The only thing I have added so far is the
