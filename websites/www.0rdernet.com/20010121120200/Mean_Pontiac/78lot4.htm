    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;<strong><font size="3">For two years I have been looking
    for a Firebird or a Camaro to play with, fix, drive, spend time with. I have owned and
    done the same with 69 firebird, OHC 6, 69 Camaro, 72 Formula, 74 Formula, 82 Trans Am.
    Then all my car projects went away, like all good things do at certain times. I have been
    looking through eBay for MONTHS, looking for nothing newer than 1978. Sent inquiring
    emails, looked at lots of pictures, conclusion, too much money, not good enough shape,
    wrong car, just all those things a discriminating person with time has going for them. <br>
    FOUND, in Kentucky, in a garage, PERFECTION. 1978 Firebird Formula, 305, 2 barrel, Turbo
    350 trans, everything perfect, just like the day it left the CA factory. 122000 miles,
    motor and drive train, have never had a bolt cracked on them. All of these things worked
    the minute I turned South to drive this car 864 miles to Florida, 15 minutes after I saw
    it in person. I took a Greyhound bus to Cincinnati to see this car. 864 miles, 22.4 MPG,

    This silver bullet is owned by Mark Perry. Mark writes:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="3"><strong>&quot;My compliments on a great web site!
    I would be honored if my T/A could grace it. Let me give you the low down on my firebird.
    Going back a few years, I first fell in love with second-gen Birds when I was 10 in 1980
    and my next door neighbor had a Platinum '78 T/A. The car was beautiful, with airbrushed
    decals just like the factory only slightly larger; a harley customizer did up. That car
    also had a healthy Crane Cam and headers with shift kit and the 2.41 rear axle, she was a
    speed demon! I was hooked, and my first car was a Platinum 78 T/A Canadian car ( speedo in
    kilos ) all stock. I loved that car, but sold it to attend college. I sold it to my uncle
    and last I heard it was in Florida. I went on to own a Starlight Black/Buckskin velour 78
    T/A, several Z28's, an '88 GTA Notchback, and an '88 GTA factory 5-speed / 305 TPI that I
    dropped a TPI 350 into. I even bought a Cameo White 77 T/A and painted it silver because I
    missed that first car so much. Then 5 years ago I found my dream car for sale in
    Massachusetts. It was a Platinum 78 T/A 4-speed with 40K original female owner miles. Much
    to my dismay, when I called I found she had just sold the car days earlier! Then in the
    fall of '99 I found the same car for sale from a guy who bought it from a friend. Slowly
    the story unraveled. I found out the car was owned by a lady named Jean for 18 years. It
    was driven rarely and even sat for 4 years straight. She sold it to a guy who owned it for
    2-3 years and was getting married. He in turn sold it to his good friend with the promise
    he would not sell it. Well, he decided to sell and ended up dis-invited to his friends
    wedding! After I acquired the car I called Jean ( still had the original ad with phone
    number from 5 years earlier by luck! ) and found out her husband had purchased it for her
    birthday present in 1978 from Clark Motors in Worchester MA. She had it repainted once
    about 7 years ago Platinum code 19 and that is the paint it wears today. It did not have
    the hood bird after it was painted, so all original decals were put back. It also has a
    larger 4-core radiator, added power antenna and new rear springs. The original clutch was
    replaced last year because &quot;it chattered &quot;. It was ordered for performance,
    stripped down with only the W-72 H/O T/A-6.6, Radio, Defroster, Hood Bird and upgraded
    tires. As per the W-72 package, she also has a B/W super T-10 and 3.42 Saf-T-Trac rear
    end. The car has been P.H.S. documented as an original car. The odometer now reads 57k
    miles. I have detailed the engine to original specs, with the exception of a customized
    functional shaker with lower breathers removed and polished aluminum added. The original
    uncut shaker is in a box. It also sports a set of Crager S/S rims, 15x10 rear with
    Goodyear Eagle 265/50VR15, and 15x8 front with 245/50VR15. The original rally II's are
    stored. The car has collected 2 second place showings this summer out of 5 shows. She's my
    baby and is NOT FOR SALE. Ha! Ha!&quot;</strong><p><strong>Mark P.</strong></font></td>
