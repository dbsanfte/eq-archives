    This '73 Trans Am model was made in Japan, manufactured by Doyusha, until it was
    discontinued sometime in late '97. Its a very large scale model at 1/12. I was able to buy
    one in Japan before they were discontinued. It was an expensive model costing $75 to $100
    in U.S. dollars. Mint examples go for about $130 now. The model is highly detailed, molded
    well and comes with a good decal set so I think its worth the money. As you can see the
    hood, doors, and trunk all open and the front wheels will move back and forth when the
    steering wheel is turned.</td>

    The kit is 1/24 scale and was made by ARII . Though a fairly basic kit, it is very nice in
    detail of what's there.&nbsp; The body is molded in white and has separate doors that are
    hinged.&nbsp; The hood is molded in and is non-opening and has a correct looking shaker
    molded as part of the hood. Although it is not stated on the box what year it is, the kit
    is obviously a 1974 due to the '70-'74 style rear window, and new for '74 bumpers.<br>
    The interior is molded in black and includes correct looking door panels, console seats
    and dash panel.&nbsp; Unfortunately the dash face is not a chrome item. The Formula
    steering wheel is molded in black and looks correct other than the center cap. There are
    also some separate<br>
    front suspension parts, also molded in black. The chrome parts consist of a full set of
    honeycomb wheels, a wide set of chrome custom wheels (the rears being deep dish), head
    lamp bezels, grills, shifter handle, license plates, chrome for the side mirrors. <br>
    Instructions for this kit are in Japanese with brief instructions in English, with the
    title &quot;Firebird Trans Am&quot; with Trans Am as one word.There is is set of BF
    Goodrich T/A radials includes and the contacts for a small motor and a rear axle with
    gears attached but it appears that you must purchase the motor separately.<br>
    Decals for the kit include a hood bird in odd colors with the body of the bird being blue
    outlined in red, with the wing tips in yellow outlined in blue then red. There are a few
    sponsor decals too.&nbsp; One oddity is that one set of the sponsor decals is Good Year
    Tires, but the kit comes with BF Goodrich tires.&nbsp; There is also one decal about
    1/4&quot; X 1 1/2&quot; that says FIREBIRD. <br>
    As a side note on the box cover under where it says Firebird Trans Am the Japanese writing
    says the same thing. This from my Father who can read Japanese. No date is available on
    this kit.</td>

This is a kit of a 1974 Trans Am that was manufactured by Otaki. It is 1/24 scale and
comes with a minimal amount of parts but seems to be well made. The instructions included
are printed in both English and Kanji. An interesting feature of this model is that the
doors come as separate pieces and you also get separate door panels. The kit also includes
a small motor that will allow the car to move on its own. The decals included feature two
different color hood birds, one orange/yellow/black and one blue/light blue/black and two
455HO decals. There is no date on this kit. </p>

    This is a 1/25 scale kit of a '75 Formula offered by MPC. Like many of the kits released
    during this decade it could be built 1 of 3 ways: show car, racing, and of course stock.
    The kit looks to come with an interesting array of extras to detail the car depending on
    the version you choose to build like a safety net and sidepipes for the race version and
    Trans Am style fenders and sail panel scoops for the show car version. No further

    plastic. It includes a full roll cage. Chrome parts include a set of Rally IIs, a set of
    custom wheels, a set of sidepipes and some misc engine components. Decals included are the
    decals shown on the cover of the box (including the &quot;Pontiac&quot; on the quarters).
    The kit is dated 1975.&nbsp;I was just recently able to acquire one of these models still
    sealed in the factory plastic. This is another rare and collectable Firebird kit.<br>

    compliment of chrome pieces are not included in this kit, instead all the pieces that are
    usually chrome are gold as they were on the actual Special Edition T/As. The decal set is
    extensive and detailed. All decals are in gold and include the complete bodystriping, the
    &quot;Trans Am&quot; badges, the 6.6 Liter decals for the shaker scoop and the hood bird
    and sail panel birds. The T-Tops have been pre-cut out of the body which is very nice if
    you like the &quot;Tops-Off&quot; look and no tops are provided. Interestingly the body
    provided with this kit has the front end already attached. The fender spoilers, however,
    are not attached and must be glued on. Overall this is an outstanding kit. Probably one of
    the better of versions of the &quot;Bandit&quot; Trans Am. <br>

This is a 1/25 scale MPC kit of a 1977 Trans Am. The blue is a nice change from the blacks
and reds you usually find this year kit molded in. Interestingly the front of the box
states &quot;CB radio gear included&quot;. Kind of a sign of the times for those days.
Everybody had a CB. No further information is available at this time...</p>
