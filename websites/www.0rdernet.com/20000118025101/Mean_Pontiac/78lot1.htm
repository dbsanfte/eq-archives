    <td width="77%" height="161" valign="top" style="text-align: left; vertical-align: text-top"><p align="left">This Y88 Gold Special
    Edition Trans Am is owned by Richard Griffith II. The engine is a numbers matching WC
    400c.i. rated at 220hp. Shifting duties are handled by a Hurst shifter connected to the
    original Borg Warner Super T-10 4-speed transmission. The rear wheels spin on 3.42:1 rear
    end gears. Richard has had the engine rebuilt. It was bored .060 over and rebuilt with , a
    RAIII cam, a Holley 850 Double Pumper on a Holley Street Dominator intake manifold along
    with a 1&quot; plate, a true double roller timing chain, a Mallory Competition 9000
    distributor with a manual advance, a Mallory Pro Coil, and Mallory Pro Spark Plug Wires.
    The engine was then dressed up with Spectre braided steel hose, blue aluminum wire
    seperators, clamps and bolt covers, a chrome alternator, water neck and master cylinder
    cover,&nbsp; and Edelbrock chrome valve covers. A set of coated Headmann &quot;HTC&quot;
    4-tube headers flowing through a pair of duel chambered Flowmaster mufflers and out the
    stock exhaust tips rounds out the exhaust system. <br>
    Interior upgrades have included front and rear dash covers, an Alpine stereo and speakers,
    a Hurst T-Handle shifter knob to help with shifting, and reupholstered seats in the
    original camel tan custom velour. Options on the Y88 include front bucket seats, an
    electric rear defogger, colormathced seat belts, tinted glass, pulse wipers, power
    windows, and the original factory Fisher T-Tops. Richard writes: <br>
    <strong><br>
    &quot;Pontiac made only a half year of the Y88, dubbed the Gold Special Edition Trans Am.
    Thus making it the most collectable Trans Am for the model year. Total production for the
    Y88 Trans Am are 8,676 units, all of them had T-Tops. 1,267 units were built with the
    Pontiac 400 with 4-Speed transmissions &amp; only 880 were built with the 403 Olds motor
    with manditory automatic transmission and smog pump. Total invoice price for this car was
    $6,021.40. Total retail or sticker price was $7,968.00. I believe that cars were meant to
    be driven. Mine, being a California car, is cruised on an almost daily basis. I am driving
    excitement!&quot;</strong><br>
    <br>
    Richard also owns a cool 1976 Black and Gold 50th Anniversary Trans Am (see the 76'
    Firebirds <a href="76lot1.htm">Lot#1</a>) and a 1978 DKM Macho Trans Am#86 (see the DKM

    beautiful low-mileage (96K) example of a Y88 Gold Special Edition. An interesting fact
    about John's TA is that all the decals are not decals at all but rather hand-painted
    versions. He had the car repainted and could not locate the original decals at a
    reasonable price so he hired someone to hand paint the decals on. According to John it
    took the guy over 300 hours to complete. Thats dedication!! The car was repainted Aztec
    Pealr Essence Gold. Under the hood the TA remains somewhat stock. The car still boasts its
    original 400c.i. engine and 4-speed transmission. Straight dual exhausts were installed
    and the carburetor was rebuilt. A K&amp;N filter was added and the shaker scoop was cut
    out to allow for cold airflow into the carb. The distributor was recurved with an HO curve
    kit and four KYB shocks were added. Ride and handling was improved with the installation
    of urethane bushings and an extra heavy duty rear sway bar. The car was refinished by AJ's
    auto bodyshop on Beaver St. Framingham, MA 01701. Their telephone number is 1-508-875-1877

    Trans Am for a mere $1300 and a computer. Thats right I said a computer. Heck with some of
    the higher end systems on the market today he probably could have got the car for JUST a
    computer. This particular TA was built to be sold in california and therefore came stock
    with the Olds 403 that was mandatory for CA cars in 78' due to California's strict
    emmissions laws. Zach plans on upgrading the bird to a healthy 455 and a full restoration.
    The car is pretty much stock&nbsp; and in good shape but it looks like its already seen
    one repaint since the sail panel decals are missing and the hood bird looks like an
    aftermarket piece. You'll also notice a set of door bumper guards have been installed as
    well. This isn't stock either but a common modification for these cars for protection
    against parking lot &quot;dings&quot;.</td>
