Debbie McKay owns this cool blue Firebird and there's an interesting story behind how she
got it. Debbie writes: <br>
<strong><br>
&quot;I owned a 1984 Firebird - that car had it's 3rd engine in it, and I had just put the
3rd transmission in it (700R4) - my theory? Three Strikes yer out! So, I thumbed through
our local Auto Trader and found TRDBIRD (ya'll figure it out ::giggle::). I read up on it
- it had a cracked windshield, and needed a little work. I called the guy, and asked him
if he would be interested in trading, straight across, title for title, my '84 for his
'79. I had recently put a Cyberdyne Digital Dash in the '84, and had put a stereo in it.
But it was costing me a fortune to keep it running. <br>
When Mark and I got to the place (which was interesting to find), we looked at this UGLY
car - and was rather hesitant at first. We mulled it over for about 15-20 minutes (BTW,
the fella was anxious to trade). He told us that he had purchased the car at an auction
because a friend of his wanted a Firebird or Trans Am to convert to a stock car, and the
friend had found one right before he brought the Firebird to his place. I told the fella
that I'd be willing to trade, however, because of the expense I had in the dash, that I'd
have to have the tires and wheels off my '84 to trade, and the man said &quot;Done Deal,
I'll get my guy on it right away!&quot; So we did all the paperwork, the fella changed the
wheels and tires out, and we took off with the '79. First place we headed was to a car
wash because the Firebird had about a half inch of mud all over it. And before it exited
the car wash 3 people had asked me how much I wanted for it!! It was like getting into a
completely different car when it came out of the car wash! Since then I have put newly
upholstered seats inside (customized with the red/black bird patches incorporated in the
headrest), I still have to get the back seats done. Had it appraised, and the value, as
you see it in the picture is $3,000.00 - so instantly I felt I came out ahead. The
appraiser told me that if I got the engine steam cleaned and worked on it a bit, and
finished the interior, got a new paint job (it needs one too), that the car's value would
more than double.&quot;</strong><br>
<em><br>
</em>Debbie is also considering installing a 350 in place of the rather lighweight 301.
However her husband Mark also owns a 79' Trans Am (see below) and they are in the middle
of some engine performance upgrades on it. Heck I think Debbie should drop a 455 in it but
then thats just me.</p>

<p>click <font color="#FF0000">-&gt;</font>&nbsp;<a href="2nd%20Gen%20Images/79ta18.JPG" target><img src="2nd%20Gen%20Thumbnails/79ta18_small.jpg" alt="Blue Trans Am" border="2" width="100" height="39"></a> This is Mark McKays Trans Am. Mark and Debbie seem to have a
history of obtaining cars through interesting situations. Before this car was to become
the newest member of the family the McKays owned a 77' Trans Am with a 400 and a 4-speed.
As Debbie writes: <strong>&quot;changing gears seemed to be getting to us old folks&quot;</strong><em>
</em>so Mark began to peruse the newspaper classifieds. What he found was aptly named
&quot;ZANIMAL&quot;. A &quot;kid&quot;, in Debbies words, was selling a 79' Trans Am and
had it in a garage. It had seen a few slight modifications wearing a 77' TA nose piece and
aftermarket T-Tops, not to mention the engine was in a convenient state of complete
disassembly. &quot;Zanimal&quot; would also be needing some attention in the interior and
an &quot;ahem&quot; paint job. Well just a few weeks after obtaining their
diamond-in-the-rough, the Navy decided one of their ships would be completely unable to
operate without Mark onboard and volunteered him for a 6 month stay. Ouch!! So
&quot;Zanimal&quot; was to now adopt the new name &quot;Big Blue Yard Ornament&quot; so
named by Debbie. About 3 weeks before the end of Marks &quot;vacation&quot; Debbie decided
to reward her husband for his selfless sacrifice and began to get the old bird together. A
chrome dress-up kit was purchased for the now reassembled engine, which was to be followed
by new headers, a new fan shroud, new flex-fan, new battery, new carb, and numerous other
parts unworthy of a mention. Four of Debbies paychecks from her new job were to be
sacrificed to numerous auto parts vendors to make the TA roadworthy. Debbie also had the
77 nose removed and the proper one installed. As for the finished product Debbie writes: <strong>&quot;Mark's
favorite hobby is leaving Mustangs at traffic lights, and when they think they are bad on
the highway, he gives them a lesson in horsepower with his Trans Am ::Grin:: - (and we're
not finished with the engine yet either!!!).&quot;</strong></p>

that was offered in 79' in celebration of the Trans Ams ten year production run. This
particular car comes with a 400c.i. engine and a 4-speed transmission. Only two engine
options were offered on these cars. Either the Pontiac built 400 or the Olds built 403.
The 400 only came with a 4-speed and the 403 only came with an automatic. Only 1,817
Anniversary Tas received the 400/4-speed combo making Gary's car the desireable choice.
Its optioned heavily and only showing 3800 on the odometer. According to Gary the car was
discovered on a farm in Wisconsin 10 years ago. Man I love those kind of stories. <br>
<br>
Gary is quite the Pontiac fanatic and collector with a collection totalling 11 cars. His
expansive collection includes: <br>
a 76' 50th Anniversary Trans Am 455 4-speed (see the 76' Firebirds <a href="76lot1.htm">Lot#1</a>),
<br>
an 80' Trans Am Pace Car, <br>
a seldom seen 81' Nascar Edition Pace Car with only 4,000 miles (seen at the 81' Firebirds
<a href="81lot1.htm">Lot#1</a>), <br>
an 83' MR MSE Trans Am #39 with only 4,500 miles (seen at the DKM Macho Trans Ams <a href="dkmlot1.htm">Lot#1</a>), <br>
an 83' Daytona Pace Car, <br>
an 84' 15th Anniversary Trans Am, <br>
an 89' 20th Anniversary Turbo Trans Am with only 500 miles, <br>
a 92' yellow/black Trans Am convertible, <br>
a 94' 25th Anniversary with Daytona decals,<br>
and a 96' Formula convertible (see the 96' Firebirds <a href="96lot2.htm">Lot#2</a>). Whew
thats a heck of a lot of garage space.</p>
