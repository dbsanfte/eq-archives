<p align="left"><strong>Christopher Buttner's 1996 WS-6 Trans Am</strong><br>
<br>
I can think of only two things that will get you over a failed relationship with a live-in
girlfriend of five years:&nbsp; A new Trans Am and a Jacuzzi. (By the way, I got the house
and furniture and she got thrown out in the street.&nbsp; I had the better attorney).
Now... what was her name?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Jacuzzi is on order, I just
have to figure out how it is going to get past the trees, shrubs and light post, after I
remove a section of the fence and the deck to get it in the backyard.&nbsp; It's a four
passenger model, 8' X 8' and 4' deep.&nbsp; I have to run 220 volt out to the back yard
and lay a 9' x 9' slab on concrete, but... what the f***.&nbsp; It's only money that I
would be wasting on supporting that bitch's sorry, flabby, cellulite-riddled ass if she
were still living here.&nbsp; The Jacuzzi cost only $700, cause I got if from a friend who
is also dumping a sorry, flabby, cellulite-riddled ass of a wife.&nbsp; (It's contagious).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, yea, the Trans Am, I'm off the
subject.&nbsp; My cure for the uncommon psycho-bitch is a 1996 Pontiac Trans Am WS-6. I
could never afford such a car when I lived in NYC, but here in Northern California, I only
pay $1200 annual insurance, with a $250 deductible.&nbsp; In Forest Hills, New York, it
would be about $10,000.00 annually - It's a wild guess, but I am sure it's pretty damn
accurate - even if it were garaged. She had only 5880 miles on it when I found it on the
'used' section of the lot at Henry Curtis Ford, in Petaluma, California.&nbsp; I never
knew what a WS-6 was until I saw it around Labor Day, 1996, and started doing some
WWW&nbsp; research.&nbsp; I was familiar with the Trans Ams forever, and I have been madly
in love with the cars&nbsp; as of the 1994 body style redesign.&nbsp; I also owned a 1976
Trans Am when I was young and stupid(er), back in 1982.&nbsp; (That got me in to a lot of
trouble).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But... Man... This WS-6... is this
an amazing vehicle or what?&nbsp; She is black-on-black, (they call the interior 'Pewter',
but it's black), leather interior, T-tops, CD player, premium sound system that will blow
you out of the open roof, automatic, 0 to 60 mph in 5.7 seconds.&nbsp; I like to keep my
cars as original as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; 100,000 mile bumper-to-bumper warranty covering
everything.&nbsp; It's not a very economical car (I've been to the gas station literally
every day....), but then again I have been driving it every where, even down the block, 60
feet to the mail box, and, anyway....who the hell cares?&nbsp; You don't drive a car like
this to be frugal!&nbsp; You can actually smell the unburned gas in the exhaust, and it
smells great!&nbsp; So what gas is $1.55 a gallon, this is not a dress rehearsal, I am
only going around once and I am pretty sure they don't bury you with your toys, not even
if you ask.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This car has me possessed. &nbsp;
Just like the guy who gets possessed by the car in the Stephen King book, Christine.&nbsp;
(I've been calling it Christine). Literally, this car wanted me more then I wanted
it.&nbsp; (Actually, I wanted it pretty damn bad.)&nbsp; It kept coming back to the
dealership every time it got sold to someone else, because I think it really wanted to
live in my garage and have me dote and fawn over it due to the blind, testosterone-driven,
obsessive compulsive behavior I have about my cars...and the women they attract.&nbsp;
(Yes, I can be THAT shallow, especially these days).&nbsp; It sensed that about me.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This car was on the lot for several
weeks, it was sold to a 19 year old girl who did something stupid like use her college
tuition to buy it, and then her father flipped out and made her return the car.&nbsp; I
then went back to negotiate on it, and hesitated too long.&nbsp; In less then 30 minutes
after I hung up the phone with the dealer, stating, &quot;see you tomorrow,&quot; it was
sold to another 22 or 23 year old kid who could not get a bank to finance him and then it
came back to the lot again.&nbsp; A week later, when the car hit the lot, the sales rep
called me, and pushed my credit through!&nbsp; (I was rejected by 29 of 30 banks... yea,
my credit sucks, but someone liked me for me, damn it).&nbsp; It's mine.&nbsp; It's got a
hold on me, I'm possessed...(insert eerie Stephen King movie music).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was hoping I was not going to
have any problems with the bank(s), because I spent the entire first weekend cleaning it
and detailing the hell out of the finish, in and out.&nbsp; If the bank rejected me, I
would have been devastated, not just because of all the cleaning and polishing I put into
it.&nbsp; I don't think this thing was this clean coming out of the factory.&nbsp; My
neighbors walked across my cul-de-sac and said, &quot;Well, we see you bought the Bat
Mobile!&quot;&nbsp; With a last name like 'Buttner&quot;, I have been referring to it as
the ButtMobile.&nbsp; Since I am newly single - and loving it - my reply was, &quot;I
wanted something to love and pour money into where all I would get in return was unbridled
satisfaction.&quot;&nbsp; They laughed, because they hate my ex as much as I do.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I took it home, after
spending three hours doing paperwork at the dealership, (it's easier and faster to buy a
house in California), I drove to the local cigar shop and bought two of the best $10.00
cigars I could find.&nbsp; I sat in my garage for two+ hours, savoring the sight
incredible machine, loving the cigar, all the time pinching myself to prove it was not a
dream.&nbsp; That car, that black beauty, was in MY garage!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, I drove along the coast
recently and took some really great pictures, and here they are.&nbsp; This area along the
Sonoma coast is only about 35 to 40 miles from where I live (actually a little less).
&nbsp; Once you're 30 seconds out of town (it takes five minutes to get out of town), the
drive consists of some of the most spectacular scenery in the world, then you hit the PCH
(Pacific Coast Highway) and then it's really amazing. It's about 200 miles of single lane
beauty along cliffs that rise some 200 feet above the sea.&nbsp; It's really, really
amazing... to be a little more descriptive.&nbsp; A great backdrop for some pictures of my
car.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This thing can cruise at 120 mph
(it's supposed to), but I have only had it up to 105 mph for a few minutes to put some
more gray hairs on my friend's head.&nbsp; He was too in love with the sound system to
notice we almost broke the land sound barrier.&nbsp; It's really a great car, it holds
solid at as 105 mph as it does at 65. Now, this thing is supposed to run $30,000, but -
but, with my luck - I picked it up for $20,175.00.&nbsp; Then I threw in a warranty, tax,
title, regi, and it finally figures out to $150,000.00 over 72 payments!&nbsp; 71 payments
to go!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hate bumper stickers, but I felt
compelled to put only one sticker on my car, and I have included a 'scan' of it for your
perusal.&nbsp; I found this little sticker in a deli in Huntington Beach, California, and
it is simply entitled, 'Kiss My Ass '96.'&nbsp; As you can see, it's a naked guy, pointing
to a lipstick kiss on his naked ass.&nbsp; I 'profiled' the little guy out of the original
4&quot; diameter sticker to make the 'artistic content' a little more refined, and placed
it just to the left of the rear tag.&nbsp; It's kind of my universal 'say all' to just
about every assh*** who is behind me, such as the buttwipe I just had to blow past because
he - most likely, she - was driving as if they were in a funeral procession.&nbsp; It's a
great way to 'say', &quot;hahahahaha, I just blew your doors off, you sorry ass Mustang
GT.&quot; Or... just because I like to tell the world, &quot;Kiss My Ass.&quot;&nbsp; The
funniest thing is when I look in the rearview mirror and see the drivers behind me, while
I am stopped at a light.&nbsp; They are always cracking-up with laughter as they are
looking at the sticker.&nbsp; I laugh every time I&nbsp; read their lips, through their
laughter, 'Kiss My Ass'.&nbsp; It's a wonderful statement, 'Kiss My Ass', it really rolls
off your tongue!&nbsp; One day, I am hoping to find a 'hieroglyphic' cartoon sticker that
details the message, &quot;FRENCH Kiss MY Ass,&quot; but I think I will just have to put
pencil to paper and draw that one myself.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, I propose that the Trans Am
Tribe adopt the 'Kiss My Ass' sticker as our badge of alliance.&nbsp; It's a unique
sticker, just like the cars we drive, and I guarantee, no one else on the road has these
stickers on their cars.&nbsp; This way, we can tell the world, &quot;We Rule&quot; and
everyone can &quot;Kiss Our Collective Asses.&quot;&nbsp; All in favor, say, &quot;Kiss My
Ass&quot;. Anyway, if you feel compelled to take a vacation sometime, think the Wine
Country of Northern California.&nbsp; If I am in town when you get here, we can drive the
back roads at 105 mph, watching the Wineries blur by, telling everyone to Kiss Our
Asses.&quot;</p>
