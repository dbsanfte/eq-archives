Unlike Pontiacs first attempt in 1979 of placing a Turbo on a Firebird, the 20th
Anniversary of the Trans Am brought us a car truly worthy of the occasion. The turbo was
installed on a 3.8 Liter V-6 that was very comparable to the engine that was installed in
the Grand Nationals a few years before. The attempt was an outstanding success and gave us
the fastest Trans Am ever built. This car was the only one to ever serve pace care duty
with absolutely no modifications. The 20th Anniversary cars would hold this title
throughout the 90s till just a few years ago. As far as appearance the car received
special badges on each fender and the front nose that proclaimed it as a 20th Anniversary.
<a href="Auto%20related%20gifs/TTAlogo.jpg">Click here</a> to see one. These badges were
trimmed in black with a gold background. With a very modest outward appearance and the
lack of a charachteristic hood bulge these cars catch many an unwary driver by surprise.</p>

with T-Tops. The special anniversary car could only be had in white. No other colors were
offered however T-Tops were an option. This particular car has traded the factory rims for
a cool looking set of aftermarket rims that are highlighted in white.</p>

has a history of Firebird ownership having owned a 1978 400/4-speed Trans Am, a 1984 GTA,
and a 1987 GTA. Lynn purchased the 89' new and has only racked up an incredibly low 2,856
miles. The car is pampered to say the least. It is only driven on beautiful days and in
only then, in Lynn's words, &quot;To excersize it&quot;.</p>

beautiful burgundy GTA is owned by Tim Kohlmeyer. A 350c.i. L98 mill provides the power to
motivate this bird. Factory performance goodies include a WS6 Performance Suspension,
quick ratio steering (12.7:1), 4-wheel disc brakes, a JG-1 aluminum driveshaft, and a
posi-trac rear with a 3.23 gear ratio. Tim has spent some time and money to have some
modifications performed to improve its, already stout, performance. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For better airflow numbers the heads have been milled and ported
and a three-angle valve job was performed. The plenum has been ported, the runners were
port-matched and a K&amp;N air filter was installed. To take advantage of the new airflow
a set of 24# ADS &quot;Super Injectors&quot; were also installed. A new computer and
distributor were also added. Lastly a TB coolant bypass has been installed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comforts are definitely not lacking on this Firebird despite its
performance. Leather seats were a standard component on the GTA. It also has power
steering, brakes, windows, locks, mirrors, seats, and even a power antenna and rear hatch.
For convenience a set of stereo controls were installed in the steering wheel. Air
conditioning and lumbar seats were also standard features.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tim's got several modifications planned despite its current
condition. Such mods include an upgrade to Baer brakes, a high flow catalytic converter,
ceramic coated headers, a shift kit &amp; Corvette servo and synthetic fluids. </p>

    <td width="77%" height="161" valign="top" style="text-align: left; vertical-align: text-top">This is definitely something you don't
    see everyday. Apparently a dealership got rather enthusiastic about promoting sales of the
    then new 89' 20th Anniversary Trans Am. They somehow managed to flip this one on its side
    for display on their showroom floor. They even used a mattress of all things to cushion
    the car from the floor. They further decided to add little white pieces of paper
    throughout the undercarriage marked with numbers or something and then provided a display
    that provided some kind of information on the marked pieces. This is taking marketing to
    the extreme boys and girls. I just wonder who the person was that bought this one!! If
    anyone has more pictures of this or information as to how and why it happened please
    e-mail me with the details. <br>
