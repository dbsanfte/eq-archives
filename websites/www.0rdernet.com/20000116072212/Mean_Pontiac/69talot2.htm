shot of the back of end of the 69' Trans Am. I think this photo may have been used in
promotional advertisements. The car just looks like its waiting for somebody to jump in
and take off....</p>

particular Trans Am had undergone a complete restoration before its appearance at this car
show. It was completely disassembled and each piece was repainted seperately as the
factory would have done it. Every nut and bolt was replated attesting to its show winning
quality. Not surprisingly it won its class and best of show. <br>

them Trans Ams) hanging out at the same gas station. I think if I'd been driving by I
would've passed out and wrecked my car. Not my Firebird or GTO though!!! This picture was
taken in October of 1995 in Lake Havasu City, Arizona by Kenny Gregrich (the 67' painted
to resemble a 69' TA is his). Kenny had attended the POCI Western Regional Convention that
had been held there. The Trans Am furthest to the left in the picture (in front of the
67') belongs to Joel Larkin of The Outlaw Pontiac Racing Association (Joel also owns a 67'
Firebird he drag races: see the Drag Racing Firebirds <a href="drlot2.htm">Lot#2</a>). His
Trans Am is one of the 55 that were built with the RAIV. Maybe I'll get that one on the
site someday!! The other Trans Am in the picture (furthest to the right) is a RAIII car
and is owned by a fellow who lives in Phoenix. Interestingly you'll notice his car has a
white interior instead of the usual blue interior. </p>

in Pontiac Enthusiast Vol 1 Issue #2. The drawing is by Jeff Denison and shows a design
idea for the 1970 Trans Am before the shaker scoop was designed. After designers decided
on the shaker scoop for the Trans Am this hood was relegated to the Formula to utilize it.

very 1st Trans Am proto-type. According top the caption it was conceived as a
&quot;Judge&quot; package for the Firebird and its the only 69' Trans Am that was ever
produced in a color besides white and blue. Its not a production car though because of the
squareness of the hood scoops, air extractors and rear spoiler. It was a RAIV automatic
car. Apparently this car met with an untimely demise when it was later crushed. <br>

Each print is priced at $39.95. Mr. Wangers has a site on the web to promote these prints.

was first introduced at the Chicago Auto Show in March of 1969. Because of this the model
is actually a 1969½. All new 69 TAs received the same paint scheme seen here. White with
a pair of blue stripes the ran the length of the car. Interestingly there were two kinds
of stripes applied to these cars and the difference was seen on the reart of the car. Some
came equipped with stripes that ran only beneath the spoiler on the trunklid but some also
came with stripes installed over the top of the spoiler as well.<br>

This diagram was provided to me by Phil Pollard. Its a graphical representation of how the
Formula hood evolved from 1969 to 1981. A recent discussion about which hood was correct
for what year model on the Pontiac E-Mail List proved that several people were somewhat
confused as to which hood WAS appropriate for what year. As a result Phil drew up this
diagram and forwarded it to me to display for you. Thanks Phil...<br>

    He bought the Firebird in 1972 from a used car lot in Albert Lea, MN but stopped driving
    it after 1975. It is an automatic car with a black interior and has only 38,000 miles
    showing on the odometer. The pictures shown here were taken in 1974 but Wayne has promised
    to send me some new ones when the car is finished.</td>
