    <td width="60%">Few and far between is a relevant description when attempting to describe
    these kits. According to my current research:<br>
    <br>
    <strong>AMT: </strong>Before they merged with ERTL, AMT released four kits modeled after
    the 1968 Firebird. Of these only one is 1/25 scale and that is the Famous and highly
    collectable &quot;Tin Indian&quot; Firebird. All others were 1/43 scale. All were retailed
    during the late '60s.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Revell: </strong>Before they merged with Monogram offered three 1/32 scale '67
    kits, and one 1/32 scale '68 kit. All were retailed during the late '60s. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>MPC: </strong>Before they were bought out by ERTL, offered a very nice 1/25 scale
    kit of a '67 Firebird with the clear glass hood and a simliar 1/25 scale kit of the '68
    Firebird. They also offered a highly customized '68 Firebird George Barris creation dubbed
    the &quot;Super Teen Firebird&quot; which was produced for a movie of the time. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Palmer Plastics: </strong>Offered one '68 Firebird kit. Scale is not advertised on
    the box but I believe it was close to 1/25, maybe 1/43. This company has long been defunct
    and the kit was a terrible one. You could count the number of pieces to assemble on both
    hands.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Summary: </strong>From the information above its plain to see that only one '67
    kit (MPC) and two '68 kits (AMT &amp; MPC) are out there that would interest the average
    builder. Unfortunately the same information conspires to make these kits very hard to find
    and extremely expensive to purchase because of their collectability.</td>

    <td width="60%"><font SIZE="2"></font><font size="3">Over the last few months I have been
    working with a resin casting company and I am extremely happy to tell you that I will very
    shortly be offering a brand new 1/25 scale kit of the 1967 and 1968 Firebird. For those of
    you that have never dealt with resin castings before, producing a new kit is a two step
    process:<br>
    <br>
    1) A donor kit must be identified that can supplement the resin kit to provide all the
    necessary pieces to build a complete kit.<p>2) Research is performed to determine what
    pieces actually need to be &quot;re-cast&quot; in order to provide the desired end
    product. A test casting is manufactured and reviewed for technical accuracy and product
    quality. The kit is put into production.</p>
    <p>What does all this mean to you? The resin kit is not a complete kit. Another kit, in
    this case AMT/ERTL's '69 Firebird 400 kit which is cheap and readily available, must be
    used to provide all the pieces that would not be different but are needed to complete the
    kit i.e. tires, windshield, engine, etc... This way the entire kit does not have to be
    recast saving lots of $$$. Currently this resin kit is projected to provide the following
    items unique to the '67 and '68 models:<br>
    <br>
    1) Body<br>
    2) Front bumper assembly<br>
    3) Front grille <br>
    4) Rear bumper<br>
    5) Dash assembly<br>
    6) Steering wheel<br>
    7) Bucket seats<br>
    8) Base Interior<br>
    <br>
    I am currently reviewing a test cast for technical accuracy and recommended modifications
    and I have to tell you it looks great!! The body is superb. All pieces exhibit a level of
    detail consistent with what you would find in a 1/25 scale kit today!!</font></td>

    the 1967 and 1968 Firebird in both hardtop and convertible form if theres enough interest.
    For delivery to the customer I plan to offer both the resin kit alone which will allow you
    to pursue a donor kit on your own and a &quot;total package&quot; kit that will include
    the resin kit and the donor kit packaged together and ready to assemble. </font></td>
