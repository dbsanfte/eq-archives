Although the Trans Am in the pic is wearing a Formula hood it is indeed a Trans Am.
Michael Rodriguez owns this TA and had to replace the unsalvageable TA hood with a Formula
hood till a new TA hood could be located. Now that we've cleared that up I'll tell you
about the rest of his car. It was bought in the first week of November of 1995 for only
$1,600. Its equipped with the standard 400c.i. engine (recently rebuilt) which is mated to
a 4-speed tranny. An MSD ignition provides the spark and a 650 Holley sits on the intake
manifold getting fuel to the motor. The bird has been repainted twice in its lifetime but,
unusually, the original semi-metallic silver was used in both cases. A black interior with
new front and rear seats, A/C, power windows, power door locks, and a tilt wheel round out
the cockpit. Putting power to the pavement is handled by 15x8 aftermarket rims with
255/60r15s in the back and 265/50r15s in the front. </p>

noticeable was the parking lamps on the front end were moved from the lower half of the
front end in the valance panel to just inside the grilles in the upper half of the front
end. The lights were positioned at the far right and left of the grilles to position them
near the headlight. I have always felt this made the front end on the 75's less attractive
than other designs.</p>

74' and 75' year models were the only two the utilize the rubber strip in the front and
rear to meet the 5mph impact requirements for bumpers. The 75' year model saw the
introduction of the familiar wraparound window, the new Radial Tuned Suspension (RTS),
catalytic converters and single exhaust systems. </p>

awesome looking blue Trans Am. I'd be proud to have this one in the driveway. Color
options for the Trans Am grew once again in 75' with the addition of Sterling Silver.
Admirality Blue was replaced with Stellar Blue and Cameo White and Buccaneer Red continued
as regulars. Another new color option for 75' came with the rally IIs. They could now be
ordered &quot;painted&quot; to match the body color.</p>

    <td width="77%" height="161" valign="top" style="text-align: left; vertical-align: text-top">This blue Formula is owned by Bob
    (Hitchhiker). The Formula is equipped with a Pontiac 350c.i. engine built with 10:1
    pistons. a crane 289 hydraulic cam, Edelbrock Performer RPM intake manifold, a Holley
    600cfm 4bbl carburetor, 2&quot; headers and a custom 2.5&quot; exhaust including Turbo
    tubes and Edelbrock Performer RPM mufflers. This combo is good for 350 to 400 ponies. The
    transmission is a Turbo 350 3 speed automatic. A TH400 installation is in the plans for
    the next modification.&nbsp; The rear end is a 10-bolt posi unit equipped with 2.65 gears.
    A set of 3.73 or 4.11 gears is also being planned for installation. The car did not always
    look as it did here. Bob writes with the story:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&quot;During the winter of
    1995/1996 the massive amount of snow we had here in the Northeast collapsed my garage on
    the car, causing severe damage...I nearly cried when I saw it!! The roof was crushed in,
    the air cleaner was knocked through the hood, and the nose piece was broken. The car was
    in the shop all summer long!! At least I have it back now and can do more work on
    it.&quot;</strong><br>

This diagram was provided to me by Phil Pollard. Its a graphical representation of how the
Formula hood evolved from 1969 to 1981. A recent discussion about which hood was correct
for what year model on the Pontiac E-Mail List proved that several people were somewhat
confused as to which hood WAS appropriate for what year. As a result Phil drew up this
diagram and forwarded it to me to display for you. Thanks Phil...<br>

Sterling silver Firebird Esprit was owned by Ken Carothers. It was the first Firebird he
had owned. Besides the code 13 silver paint it came with a deluxe black interior. He
bought it in 1980 from a neighbor for $1500. The bird needed some work so Ken and his
father did some bodywork on it including removing the vinyl top, filling the trim clip
holes, and touching up numerous parking dings. A rear spoiler was added during the process
and then it was repainted with silver DuPont Imron paint. As a slight cosmetic enhancement
Ken decided to black out the tailight bezels. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This particluar Esprit got the 350c.i.
mill. It generated 155hp with a 2bbl carburetor. A TH350 handled the shifting and the rear
gears were a conservative 2.56. Ken decided on a set of 235/60R15s for tires. All the hard
work paid off when the car took first place in an AutoRama held in Bryan College Station,
TX in 1982. Ken would later sell the car.</p>
