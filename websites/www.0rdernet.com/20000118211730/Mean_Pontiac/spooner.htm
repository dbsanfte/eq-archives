<big><big><big>Gary Spooner's 454 Twin Turbo Convertible</big></big></big><br>
<big><big><big>Trans Am</big></big></big><br>
<big><big><big></big></big></big></p>

<p><b>Engine:</b> 1976 2 bolt 454 converted to 4 bolt. aligned bored and Rockwell tested
as well as sonic tested. Forged GM crank, Manley aluminium rods (stock length),
supercharger 7.5.1 pistons, balanced, torque plates installed (Sunen machine) roller
timing chain, competition cam Weiand intake 8013, solid mount engine mounts. </p>

<p><b>OIL:</b> Melling's oil pump. 9 quart oil pan, oil cooler, and custom made remote
filter housing. </p>

<p><b>HEADS:</b> 1976 454 120cc chamber heads, Competition Cams pushrods, valve springs,
retainers and locks, roller rockers, bronze valve guides, stainless one pieace valves
intake: 2.20 exhaust: 1.90. </p>

<p><b>COOLANT:</b> Brassworks water pump, Robertson 180 degree thermostat, custom made 6
core rad. (8 inches thick, and fits inside rad support) </p>

<p><b>TURBO SYSTEM:</b> Designed by RPM Research (Gary Spooner). Designed pressure
housing, turbo mounting, exhaust manifolds, and all related plumbing. Turbo's are
extensively modified by RPM. Turbos are not solidly mounted to exhaust manifold, they are
secured at the front of engine. Mounting brackets are designed to allow movement of turbo
during heating and cooling (no cracks.) Pressure box completely encloses the carb,
therefore few mods to carb throttle plate were required. </p>

<p><b>PRESSURE BOX:</b> 0.060 aluminium, designed by RPM. I wanted to have the carb
completely enclosed but still accessible for servicing. </p>

<p><b>TURBOS:</b> TB03 .60 turbine housings and .80 compressor housings respectively,
external wastegate (rotomaster) heat shields. Turbo's were previously used as draw-through
turbos for the 4.9 litre. I converted them for the blow through method. </p>

<p><b>ENGINE AND TRANSMISSION MONITORING:</b> Designed by RPM, digital computer
technology, non transistor (3 logic circuits for turbo cool down sequence) all relays,
triple pole double throw. Each relay has 2 functions <br>
1. Indicate its position whether on or off. <br>
2. Control load devices. <br>
Purpose: To monitor oil pressure, oil temperature (oil filter housing) oil temperature
(turbo oil return), turbo prime, coolant temperature, trans temperature, day time running
lights, provide info about engine condition to drivers compartment. <br>
<b>Function: </b>Oil pressure is given #1 priority, engine will shut down when oil
pressure is lost. All relays that provide ign control receive voltage from oil pressure
relay. <br>
<b>Turbo prime: </b>Will not allow engine to start until 7-15psi of oil pressure.
(bypassed if desired, switch in console). Turbo oil return temperature is constantly
monitored. If excessive, relay will be energised but will have no effect upon engine
operation. When key is turned off, voltage is applied through relay to ign relay, this
keeps the engine running. Voltage is also applied to the oil cooler fan motor relay, and
coolant fans relay, also the alternator is kept on line to maintain system voltage. After
the temperature of the oil from the turbos has dropped to a safe limit the engine will be
allowed to shut down. If oil pressure is lost during the turbo cool down sequence this
event will be bypassed and the engine shut off (bypassed if desired, switch in console). <br>
<b>Daytime running lights</b> Controlled by relay #8. Energised when oil pressure is
present. <br>
<b>Transmission temp.</b> Monitored at the oil pan of the transmission. Controls fan for
tranny cooler, also will indicate at console. <br>
<b>Engine oil temp.</b> Monitored at the filter housing. Controls fan for engine oil
cooler. Switches on the outside of the box provide a method to keep coolant fans from
cycling during maintenance, and to confirm that the turbo cool down circuit is
functioning.</p>

<p>All accessories have been retained A/C, cruise, etc. </p>

<p><b>TRANSMISSION:</b> 1983 700R4 built by RPM. Complete upgrade performed, 9 disc 3-4
clutch, revised overdrive planetary etc, Tony Rossi, Gray Thunder series 12 inch torque
converter, turbine and impeller blades heli brazed, angled to give a stock stall speed,
double torington bearings at thrust surfaces 2-4 piston replaced with Corvette parts, anti
downshift kit for extreme speeds, deep sump pan. TCI flexplate etc. etc. </p>

<p><b>REAR AXEL</b> Stock GM 81/2 3.08 axle (nice job GM) 4 wheel disc, metallic pads. </p>

<p><b>Suspension</b> WS6 suspension, urethane bushings, all round, ladder bars, big block
springs, 5 leaf thickness rear springs, 50 series on back, 60 on front. </p>

<p><b>INTERIOR</b> New carpet, manufactured the console, 6 point harness, new ragtop, Fuel
pressure (autometer) Vacuum boost gauge (autometer) EGT gauge, controls for computer.
Stock gauges. </p>

<p>I wanted this car to go in excess of 180 mph. I know it could go in excess of that
speed easily. The rate of acceleration is awesome for a car that is 4200lbs (after mods
completed). The exhaust is quite and the engine runs very smooth. In overdrive at highway
speed of 60 mph engine will generate 20 inches of vacuum. Boost is adjustable, min. 3 psi
to 15 psi. For normal play I run 8 psi on supreme gas, 4 psi on regular. <br>
The 1/4 mile is scary: I had a companion to time a run, he weighed 213 pounds, I had a
problem with traction for the first 300ft (to much boost) but I still pulled a high 12s
low 13s 1/4 mile. Other streeters have tried to beat this brute with no luck! The bonus
comes at the gas pump, impressive fuel mileage for this car. <br>
I have had this car since 85 I never will let this car out of my grasp. <br>
