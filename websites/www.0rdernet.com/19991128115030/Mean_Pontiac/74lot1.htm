white Pro Street Trans Am is owned by Bill Gunzberg. Bill's bird has no problems getting
around town. Heres the setup that makes sure of that: a 1970 455 H.O. bored 0.30, #64 high
compression heads, 1962 SD connecting rods, a RAIV cam &amp; 1.65 rockers, a Doug Nash
Tunnel Ram topped with 2 Carter AFB 600 carbs, and an Accel BEI distributor &amp; MSD box.
Power is applied through a 4-speed muncie to a 12 bolt rear end turning a 4.10 ratio
(ouch!!). Hopefully Bill will send us some timeslips in the future.</p>

the shaker scoop option. The car is also equipped with the optional SD455. 74' would be
the last year this monster motor was available. 1974 marked the first time the Firebird
received a front and rear makeover since the introduction of the 1970 model. The new front
end with its slanted grills was known as the soft nose. The rear bumper received bigger
tailights and a thin, black, warparound black strip, that served as a bumper. This was the
most distinguishing feature of these cars.&nbsp; </p>

optional SD455 engine, and a set of aftermarket Centerline wheels. The horsepower rating
for the LS2 SD455 remained unchanged at 290hp but it would be the last year the block
would see production. It would also be the last year dual exhaust was installed on
Firebirds. Thats what increased emission laws and and a gas crisis will do to you.</p>

very low quality pic but its unique because the TA depicted has some kind of vinyl top
installed. This is an interesting and rarely seen factory option. Another much more common
roof modification, T-tops, did not become an option until 1976 so beware pre-76 Firebirds
advertised with T-tops. I can guarantee you they are aftermarket tops and will probably
leak.</p>

This is a unique photo taken at the 1974 Chicago Auto Show. Interestingly the car at the
front of the photo at first appears to be a 76' 50th Anniversary TA but with a closer look
you'll notice it is a 74'. This becomes more interesting because the car does have the
same gold accents that would be installed on the later 50th Anniversary TAs. I can't quite
tell to be sure but it also appears to be missing the hood bird. This must have obviously
been a promotional car designed to give potential buyers and Firebird fans a look into
what was to come. To base model Firebirds and a Grand Prix can also be seen in the
background.<br>

price for a base model Firebird was $3,335. The engine options for the base model were an
in-line six cylinder or a 350c.i. V8. Surprisingly 7,603 Firebirds were sold with the six
cylinder which was rated exactly at 100hp. The V8, sporting a 7.6:1 compression ration
came with a 2-barrel carburetor and single exhaust. This was good for 155hp and attracted
18,769 buyers. <br>

choices changed for the Trans Am in 74' but stayed at three. Bucaneer Red (seen here),
Cameo White (seen above), and Admiralty Blue which replaced Brewster Green from the
previous year. Heres the paint code for each one:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Bucaneer

There were four engines available for the Formula. At the low end was a 350c.i. mill rated
at 170hp. Next up was the 400 block which rated at 190hp. The last two engine options were
the 455 and the SD455. To help these powerplants make their power a number of other
performance options were offered for the Formula including dual exhausts and a heavy duty
suspension. Wider than standard tires could also be had.<br>

Bob Morgan owns this fantastic Formula 350. It has been completely restored to its
original appearance including new paint, a new vinyl top, a new interior and all new trim.
The drivetrain is completely original as well down to the 2bbl carb and 3-speed automatic
tranny. Bob did opt for some improvements adding a new custom exhaust with an H-pipe, a
limited slip differential and a 40w four speaker stereo system that features a deck
outfitted with a cassette player and a stock looking faceplate. For improved handling the
suspension has been upgraded with new gas shocks, new front springs, and urethane bushings
were added to the rear leaf springs and front and rear sway bars.<br>
Continuing with the spirit of modification and aspiring to make this car operate the way
Pontiac should have Bob has taken on the task of making the Ram Air hood functional. The
scoops were opened up by a local body man and the twin rubber boots and retainers have
been mounted. The only thing left is to either find a rare and often expensive air cleaner
setup or, if he can obtain the mechanical drawings, manufacture his own.&nbsp;<br>
Incredibly Bob is the original owner of this car which sports an unbelievable 176,000
miles. You'd never guess would ya...<br>
<br>
Bob also owns a 1997 Trans Am covertible that can be seen at 97' Firebirds <a href="97lot3.htm">Lot#3</a>.</p>

    This beautiful SD455 Trans Am is owned by James Amos. James writes:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="3"><strong>&quot;This is an all original 1974 Trans-Am with
    the Super Duty 455 option (LS2). It's an Admiralty blue with medium blue custom interior.
    This original owner car&nbsp; came equipped with the M21 close ratio 4speed trans, radial
    tuned suspension, rally II wheels, AM/FM Stereo w/8 track player, tinted glass, rear
    defroster and hood decal options. Though it has only 35k on the odometer, and I do trailer
    it long distances, I give it a good workout on the drag strip and road courses..as well as
    stop light to stop light. It turns pretty consistent times in the 13.40's...slicks and
    loosened exhaust pipes brings it around the 13 flat mark with one 12.99 to it's credit.(I
    keep that time slip framed and hanging in the garage because the bowtie guys never want to
    believe me!!) Look for me in the 1999 Woodward Dream Cruise up in Michigan.&quot;<br>
