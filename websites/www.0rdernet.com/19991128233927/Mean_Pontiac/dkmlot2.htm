of an MR MSE bird. Other unique options on these cars included a full width front spoiler,
a low resistance rear spoiler, specific and unique MSE emblems and badges, MR centercaps,
and an MR hood emblem.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All MSEs also came with a unique
performance package called a &quot;Git Kit&quot;. This package included a 600 Holley
carburetor, aluminum intake manifold, Mallory distributor, Coil spark plug wires and
Champion spark plugs, a low restriction air cleaner, Tri-Y headers, and a Y-pipe to
connect the headers to the factory exhaust.<br>

suspension modifications if they hadn't already been installed. Other high performance
goodies that could be had with these cars were a Doug Nash 5-speed manual transmission, a
non-EGR Edelbrock intake manifold, Recaro seats, Tri-Y headers, even a 440hp 406 small
block chevrolet!! How's that for performance on a factory warrantied car. Only about 50 of
these cars were manufactured in 1984 so they are somewhat desirable and definitely
collectable.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I stated above if you want to
learn more about these incerdibly cool and interesting cars you simply have to go to the <a href="http://www.tatribe.com/Mecham.htm">Mecham Home Page.</a> Its chock full of
information on the original Machos and MSEs and the new Machos being produced for 1998.<br>

    <p>So you were just muttering to yourself that you wished the Mecham brothers were still
    making these awesome cars so you could buy a brand new one.....well you can starting with
    the new 1998 year model. Here's the story about how it happened:<br>
    <br>
    <strong>&quot;While I was working on the Macho and MSE book that will be coming out around
    the first of the year, Dennis Mecham and I started talking about what a fourth generation
    Macho T/A might include. As we discussed the possibilities, I noticed Dennis was getting
    enthused about the idea so I continued talking about it. After a while I asked Dennis what
    he thought about the remote chance of actually building a new Macho - especially since it
    was the 20th anniversary of the first Macho T/A. He considered the alternatives and said
    he would think about it. From that point on, enthusiasm grew and the next six months was
    an exciting time of prototyping, researching, fabricating, turning wrenches, losing sleep,
    talking to suppliers, dealers, mechanics and racers. Finally, the new Macho was born. It
    was really all Dennis and Kyle. I provided some research and some financing, but Dennis
    and Kyle did all of the design and engineering. I spent some time with them during the
    design phase as a &quot;casual observer&quot; and I can truly say these guys are
    Motor-head Artists to the nth degree. All of the hood and wing lines seemed to flow
    naturally from the car itself, but it took Dennis and Kyle to bring it out. After the
    designing, prototyping and planning phases, actual build time was fast. It had to be ...
    Hot Rod Magazine was coming out to do a story (October issue) and the cars (the three
    prototypes) had to be ready. I didn't even see a picture of my car. The first time I saw
    it was after the Hot Rod<br>
    interview, Dennis shipped the car to me and I saw it after it was unloaded from the
    trailer. Timing again was critical because I was taking it to the Trans Am Nationals in
    Dayton, Ohio the NEXT DAY. (Talk about cutting it close!) The first time I saw the car I
    couldn't believe it. I couldn't take my eyes off of it, but even better was the sound of
    the engine when I started it up. I have heard alot and driven alot of third and fourth
    generation Firebirds (including three Firehawks I own), but none even comes close in
    looks, sound and performance of the '97 Macho. Of the three prototypes, my car had the
    most &quot;goodies&quot; including a 383 stroker motor (472hp dyno), Centerforce clutch,
    carbon-fiber drive shaft, 3.73 rear gears, custom heavy duty radiator, awesome exhaust by
    Pro-Dyno and B&amp;B, full suspension treatment, Baer brakes, Simmons wheels and Michelin
    Pilot tires, and much more! I have not yet taken it to the track, but I can tell you it
    will do 0-60 in a heartbeat and the Pilots stick like glue (315 35's in the back don't
    hurt!) A good driver, a good day and reasonable traction would see this car into the 11's
    without a doubt (I have done some drag racing, so I am fairly certain about this). That's
    all fun and fine, but I love people's reaction to the car. It is definately &quot;In your
    face&quot; and you gotta love it or hate it - No passive responses. The TA Nationals gave
    me a good opportunity to listen to the comments coming from mostly a Firebird crowd.
    Everything from, &quot;WOW! I can't believe it ... I want to order one today!&quot;, to
    &quot;That's a BIG WANG, dude.&quot;, to &quot;Too bad it hasn't got an SD455 under the
    hood.&quot; The guys from SLP spent alot of time looking it over and I noticed they have
    postponed displaying their newest revised Firehawk hood until they figure out how to do
    heat extractors like the Macho. The best story, though, is what happened when I took the
    car out for my first ride from the car transporters' office. I got on it a little bit and
    took a few hard turns, just to get the feel and after five minutes I pulled back into the
    transporters' place. 30 seconds later, a 30th anniversary Camaro SS pulled in and the
    driver jumped out and just stood there looking at the Macho for at least a couple of
    minutes. He finally said, &quot;Whoa! How can I get one of these?&quot;. Well, the '98's
    are just about ready to go. <br>

    proto-type built by Dennis &amp; Kyle Mecham. This car (also known as the S-Model) was
    equipped with an LT1 with some aftermarket bolt-ons and dynoed at 325hp. It was optioned
    with a 52mm throttle body, Moroso cold air box, a B&amp;M Ripper shifter, a 3.73:1 ratio
    rear end, Pro-Flow 3&quot; exhaust with B&amp;B Triflow tips installed after the catalytic
    converters, 1½&quot; dropped Eibach springs, Bilstein shocks, Energy Suspension,
    polyurethane sway bar bushings, carbon metallic brake pads and a performance chip. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car currently belongs to
    Biddulph Pontiac of Glendale Arizona and is for sale. If you are interested in purchasing
    it you should contact Biddulph Pontiac. If you are interested in any information on
