      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">It was, quite simply, the greatest adventure anyone could dream of. More than four score of us did assemble in the mines of Solusek with the hope of slaying the mightiest beast of the land. Lead by Gual, our band of battle-hardened veterans donned our gear inside the sulfurous cave. All being hardheaded, thinking we knew best, our band was quite chaotic.
</font>
      </p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">
My fellow Amber Knights had earlier drove into Solusek in hopes of taking the head of Lord Djarn. While they succeeded, his minions did lay them to rest and a rescue party had to be formed to retrieve their fallen bodies. Once Ulthane, in his cute gold slippers, 
and the rest of mine brothers and sisters we retrieved, we made our way towards King Tranix's Keep.</font>
      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">
We were all in a deep fog during the battles, the air was so thick many of us passed out on several occasions. With as many people as we had I shant bore you with the battles up til the keep. These mighty beasts, none of which most of us could slay alone, fell quickly to our band.</font>
      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">
With the aid of Arkolo and later Biktik, the shapeshifting poker from hell, we all made it to the keep with little trouble. My heart began to race at the thought of what was about to happen. I stood in awe for a moment as I saw them coming. I had seen giants, hell, I had felled giants, but I had never seen anything like these. Three came at us, their crimson skin and blackened iron armor making them look like demons from another realm.</font>
      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">
I raced to meet their charge, Gravesinger gleaming from the light from the lava in the pit to my right glanced up, seeing the crown on one of their heads, and did make King Trannix himself my target. Although my blade did cut deeply at his ankles, I doubt he felt much pain. I rained a score of blows against him before I wheeled about and cut at his tendon. I made my mark and paid dearly for it. With but a single blow he knocked me flat on my back some twenty feet away and my lungs sucked for precious air.</font>
      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">
As the giants began falling a second wave of them came in lead by Warlord Skarlon. I watched around me as my brothers and sisters all began to fall. I positioned myself under Skarlon and cut at him with rage over what was happening. Blop had fallen in the initial charge and I was the only other person in my group of six with the ability to heal. I was certain I would fall, but better me than someone else. </font>
      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">
Arkane magicks firing all about me, I fought on in hopes I would slay Skarlon before I fell. He hammered at me and I stood my ground. My shield arm useless, hanging at my side from all his blows, my crown so dented I doubt I will ever be able to get it off, I watched Skarlon fall just as I was ready to call upon Marr to faith heal me.</font>
      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">
I am a man with two very different faces. In battle I will do anything to save someone, giving my life to see that they will go on. What I saw after the battle made me weep, however. I stood there numb, bleeding to death, but to stunned to heal myself. Bodies were stacked like cord wood all about me. I know not how many, a score..maybe more.</font>
      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">
I went to a corner to make sure no one saw my tears.</font>
      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">
With ten healers raising the dead we were all back together in a short time. We set out further into the keep and did come to the throne room. Majestic gold veined white marble attempted to hide the malevolence of the place. Once we were dug in there a small group of giants did come to attempt to retake the keep.</font>
      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">
We were finally working well together by this time, however, and the onslaught was quickly turned back and the two giants fell. After a quick rest we traveled yet further into the bowels of Solusek, coming to a drawbridge. We were getting close now, I could feel it
The last of Nafagen's minions did battle with us there. Magi Royki and one last fire giant came at us hard. The giant crashing into our line, while the spellweaver used his battle magick against us. I called upon Marr and did lay a series of stuns on the Magi, disrupting many of his spells. Both giants fell quickly to our now organized effort.</font>
      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">
We made our way into a chamber just outside Nafagen's lair and prepared for the final battle. I found my beloved Temvariana in the crowd and I held her in my arms. I could see the pain on her face, she knew I was going to fall to Nafagen, but she also knew that it was something I had to do.
A small group went in before the main party to casts magicks on the beast, stripping it of the magicks it had cast upon himself. I sharpened Gravesinger to the point I felt she could cut stone. I looked about and all the other brave warriors doing the same with their blades. I can not express to you proud I am at each and every one of you. We knew each and every one of us would die, yet we sacrificed ourselves so that some man wearing a dress could claim he slew Nafagen.</font>
      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">
Methinks thirty or fourty of us came in the initial charge. As I entered the chamber I looked up at not a mighty beast, but a living god. I swallowed hard as I rushed to it. It was blood red, I know not how large, the size of a hamlet I suppose. It met us all with gout of dragonbreathe. White hot, it burned my flesh, even under my armor. We met the beast and laid wicked blows upon it. Whoever drew his attention was dead, another brave warrior falling every ten seconds. </font>
      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">
A few of us were driven from the lair from his magicks, this let me heal myself and continue the battle. I charged in again cutting at Nafagen with all my might. Only mayhaps three of us warriors were left, and I knew that I would soon follow my brethren.
Nafagen turned his attention to me, his claws digging deeply through mine armor.
I faith healed myself and cut back at the best the best I could, but I was like a child using a wooden blade against a giant. He bathed me twice more in dragonflame and laid four more slashes to my body as I fell. I died, knowing that we mellee fighters had done our work with great honor and distinction, Lord Nafagen was half-dead as I fell.</font>
      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">
I sat in the Temple of Marr, praying for everyone's life as I listened to battle reports. Mages were hitting Nafagen with everything they had but the battle went poorly. Nafagen was cutting down everyone that met his cruel gaze. Thanks to the idea of binding themselves to his liar, however, the casters were able to slowly strike down Nafagen, Dartaghan getting the killing blow.</font>
      
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">
Gual was presented with the mantle Dragonslayer after we had returned to Solusek. I appreciate his efforts of going through all this, as I have no doubt organizing it was an ordeal. Greed it rear its ugly head last eve, however, and I truly pity the six people (mayhaps less) that were involved, we all know what you did and we will all make it our mission to make you miserable for your actions.</font>
