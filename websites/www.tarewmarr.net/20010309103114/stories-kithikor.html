      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Soft earth gave way to my hard leather boots, the boots of a fallen Dwarven Lord, as I made my way into the dangerous woods of Kithicor. In my youth these woods were a bandit haven. Orks had infested it and High Hold Pass, but no longer, the Shaglok Orks had been driven from the woods by a far more dangerous force. Always a dark place, its high canopy blocking out the sun even on the nicest of days, this place was now unholy, the stuff of children's nightmares. It was daybreak as I went in search of the items I was after. The Priestess was specific about those items and promised that I would find them here.
</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">I didn't bring my steed Bloodhoof with me, I wasn't sure how he would handle the soft ground nor the living dead that called this place home. The priestess stated I needed to find Targen's book, which was left in his home as he fled to Lake Rathe some time ago. He held a component needed in my quest and he would give it to me in exchange. When last I passed through the woods they were alive. The sounds of birds in the trees, insects all about, now&hellipnothing..nary a sound. 
</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">It was eerie, as if I was in the eye of a tornado, the calm before the storm. After a few hours I came across a burned out dwelling, a simple house of poor construction. I ducked through an opening in the structure and kicked around some debris on the rotting wood floor. Atop the fireplace I found what I was looking for, a dusty book of bad binding. Smiling to myself, knowing I was all that closer to my goal I set out deeper into the woods in search of the stolen ingot.
</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">I stopped in RiverVale on my way twards High Hold for a meal. Those Hobbits do two things well, steal and cook. Tucking in my beltpurse I trekked straight for the tavern. Ordering some black bread, cheese, and smoked meat as well as stout ale. Tipping well, praying that they didn't cut open my purse I made my way back out into the forest. Nightfall was looming so I prayed for Marr's blessing as he shielded me in a divine aura and made me invisible to the walking dead. 
</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Searching for a large log with a tree stump nearby would seem to be an easy task, well it wasn't. Hours past by without any luck at all, logs in plenty I spotted, none of which held my trophy. It became so dark I was forced to place my guise on, transforming my appearance to that of a Dark Elf, I cringed at doing this, but after running into my third tree and bloodying my nose I thought it best. 
</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The ground erupted beneath me just then, skeletal arms reaching for me from the tainted soil. Its head emerged and wailed at me as I drew Gravesinger from her hilt. The dead were rising from the earth as Innoruuk called them and I was far from High Hold. It wore a military uniform, hanging from its rotting flesh, some poor soul that died in no doubt a great battle long ago, now the pawn of a cruel god. It fought like an untrained soldier, little match for me but it tied me up long enough for others to hear our battle. He exploded into shards of bone as Gravesinger bathed him in holy light. Two more came at me, no doubt men from his same company. I sighed at their fates and set them both free from Innoruuk's cruel grasp.
</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Hiding myself again from their eyes I continued my search, now deep in the haunted forest. I spotted a log with a large tree stump near it and sighed relief as I made my way there. I climbed up and walked its length as stared at the stump. It was some ways off so I got a running start and leaped into the air, landing hard and slipping on its slickness, falling to the ground some twenty feet below and trying desperately to suck air into my lungs. Looking around, praying no one saw me, even the dead, I dusted myself off and climbed the stump, taking the ingot that Innoruuk had stolen.
</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">I decided another meal was in order, these woods had sucked the life from me. Seeing what were once, no doubt, good men brought back like that was devastating. I vowed to Marr that I would return often to free more of these tortured souls. Upon getting close to RiverVale I heard screams and the sounds of a pitched battle. Some 12 brave souls were protecting the city's gate from an undead horde. I quickly joined in the fray, spotting a healer among the dead's ranks and engaged it. I tied it up, stunning and disrupting it's spells as the others cut down the infantry. Gravesinger bathed the priest three times and laid wicked wounds across its body until its soul was finally released.
</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">What came next I wasn't ready for, two more living dead entered the battle, one wearing the surcoat of my order. In fact a surcoat of a Relana, the highest station in the Company of the Unblinking Eye. He broke through their line like a hurricane as he arched his flaming sword down upon them. I rushed to their aid as he cut them down one by one. Slicing through plate mail, weapons and bone with each hit. They were in retreat as I entered the battle, laying a cut across the back on its calf, hoping to slow it for their escape. 
</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">It turned to face me as I cut deeply into its right wrist, hoping to cut it off to leave it weaponless. I stared in horror as it faced me, Valamir D'Sydor, my mentor; the man that saved my life and raised me after my parents were murdered stood before me. He was a far stronger and larger man than I in life and who knew what powers Innoruuk had cursed him with now. I was faster than the corpse and laid numerous small wounds on its limbs, but it didn't slow, kept pressing me and forcing my shield up to deal with its relentless blows. He was winning this fight, he had all the knowledge of a proven battle field leader without any human frailties, I owed it to him to release him though, there is no way I would stop. 
</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The four remaining soldiers had engaged the last of the living dead and were doing well against it. I doubted that they would have time to save me though, I hadn't had any blows that seemed to slow it and it had cut into bone twice on me. My prayers to Marr went unanswered, as I wasn't able to concentrate long enough for him to hear. I faithhealed myself and tried to root him to rest a moment without any luck. Rage then took over, desperation, whatever it was. I shouted Valamir's old battle cry, " The coward believes he will live forever if he holds back in battle, but in old age he shall know no peace, though spears have sparred his limbs."
</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Near death I shielded myself with the powers of my bladestopper, It covered my body in shimmering light as Valamir's body hacked at me, sparks flew as he tried to break through. Just then an Elven Princess, the one that stole my heart, restored my health and renewed my stamina. As Valamir broke through my magic shell I ducked under his blow and spun around, digging Gravesinger deep into its chest and she sang to him, holy light turning his rotting bones to dust. He reeled back and I prayed to Marr over and over, blasting bolts of divine light into him. The last one exploding his corpse into a thousand pieces and freeing his tortured soul. 
</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Felina held me as I wept in her arms, telling her what a good man Valamir had been, he had saved my life countless times and I had finally freed his soul so he could lead Marr's army once again.
