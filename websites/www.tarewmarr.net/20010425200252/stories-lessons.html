      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Thick black smoke curled upwards into the sky from the blaze that had been a family dwelling moments ago. Lord General Ulan Silvaloche sat his horse patiently, his steel-backed gauntlets tucked behind his belt. His eyes surveyed the inferno, checking to make certain no one was escaping from the windows and doors. Perhaps boarding them shut had been unnecessary, but he wanted no chances taken with this one; the man had eluded Ulan for the last time.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"> The Campaign was failing miserably, and had been for a year now. The High Elven Council being the pompous, ignorant fools they were, refused to see they were fighting a losing battle,<br>
and that we must eventually know defeat. A blind man in another country could see that, Ulan often wondered why the most educated men he knew could not.</font></p>
        <hr size="1" noshade>
              
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">For a year now they had been pinned in the Commonlands, trying to at least hold ground against the neverending hordes of Ogres, Trolls, and Dark Elves. They could not even do that. </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Each new day brought more reports of outposts being overrun, refugees, and the tattered remnants of the strongest and most experienced armsmen known to Faydwer. It should have been plain we would eventually be either ground to dust under the boots of the dark hordes, or<br>
driven straight into the sea. Perhaps we would have had a chance, Ulan thought, had the scheming fool Humans in the city of Freeport to the East lent aid. Instead, they chose to sit and watch us die not 5 miles from their walls, taking neither side. Ulan doubted the reinforcements 
who had sailed from Faydwer not 2 days past would make it in time. </font>
</p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"> It was still a great mystery how this had all come to pass in the first place. No one had seen or heard much from the Trolls or Ogres in the many years since the abrupt and violent end of the Elder Age; most guessed the curses laid upon them and the defeat they had suffered at the 
hands of the Greater Gods had eventually destroyed them. When the first reports began arriving from the Rathe Mountains, telling of a massive army of Ogres and Trolls marching northward, 
no one on the Council truly paid it much mind. Most thought it to be a product of a bored sentry's overactive imagination. When reports arrived from Southern plains of Karana, speaking
of Ogres and Trolls enough to blacken the plains, there was actually laughter. Surely there could not be enough of either to blacken a blade of grass, much less an entire plain! Ulan shook his head regretfully, remembering how they had chuckled over their fine crystal goblets, filled with the finest elven wine. Oh, how they had laughed then. Well, no one was laughing now.</font></p>
        <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">"Sieran!", he barked, "to my side!"</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"> The grizzled Captain quickly dismounted, handing the reins of his warhorse to an under-Lieutenant. As the Captain approached, Ulan recalled how dignified Sieran had once been. 
Well known for his quick wit, ready smile, and way with the womenfolk, Sieran had been one of Felwithe's most notorious scoundrels. His smile was gone now, his wit replaced by a cold bitterness that had quickly spread among the legionmen. Sieran waited patiently at Ulan's stirrup, his hands clapsed behind his back.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">"Sieran, you are to return to the tents, and bring my son to me."<br>
              </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"> It was far past time for Saracen to begin his training as a General. This would be a good beginning - it never got any easier to do deeds such as these, he might as well learn early on that he must do what needed doing. Saracen would be a fine General one day, if he ever learned true power lay not in books, but in cold steel. His mother had put fool notions of the Arcane in his head, when it was clear to Ulan his son was destined to be a great General.</font></p>
        <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">"As you wish, Lord General.", was Sieran's crisp reply, given almost over his shoulder as he sped to his mount. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"> Ulan returned to his study of the burning house. The charred roof was beginning to sag under it's own weight in places, the walls slowly buckling. Finally,  he had bettered that wretched Dark Elf. It had taken him four attempts, and six months; but he had finally done it.He permitted himself a small grin of satisfaction.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">-By Saracen</font></p>
