      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There's been several problems with the RL Photos section.</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Not a technical problem, but a real life harassment problem.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I've had to remove several photos from this site at the person's (usually a pretty lady) request, due to the fact that pathetic and lifeless nerds come to this site and get the idea that just because they see a nice looking female's photo, and they play EQ too, they have a chance to get a life and said nice looking female will fly across the globe to be with them forever. Reality check kids, that ain't gonna happen.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I'm terribly sorry to the folks who have been harassed in game because of the photos they sent me to post here and I find it sickening that people have treated you the way they do, all because of this website. I added this section to my site because I like to see the faces behind the names of the people that I play EQ with, and judging by the response, I'm definately not alone.. however I will be removing the entire RL photos section if the harassment doesn't stop.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you've submitted your photo and find people bugging you about it (I don't mean &quot;hey I saw your picture and you're pretty&quot;, but more like people always &quot;stalking&quot; you in game, telling you to get naked, etc), first I think you should /report and /petition about them in game. I don't know Verant's stance on this but I know in other online RPGs I've played this type of behavior is NOT tolerated and has lead to instant bannings every time, and almost a lawsuit once. If they can't help and you feel there is no other way to stop it, <a href="mailto:eldrad@tarewmarr.net">contact me</a> and I'll remove your photos.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I hope reading this doesn't make you decide not to send in your photos if you haven't yet. This all might sound a little harsher than it is.. but if you want your fellow EQ players to see what you look like, by all means send in your photo. But just keep in mind this could happen to you, but i'm sure Verant will take steps to help you if you find yourself being harassed, stalked, etc.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also, here's some info I got from a former GM that I emailed about this stuff...</font></p>
        <ul>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Hello,</font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Although I am not part of the GM team anymore, I can still provide you with an answer to this problem. Any of the people that find themselves getting harrassed in game can report the offender to us. Making sure that the harrassing text in is the text window, they simply need to type /report [name of offender] This will take the 10 line chat buffer and save it in a file that the GM staff can review. After doing the report, have them petition to the guides/gms that they have sent in a report. This way the GM of the server knows to pull that report. If the text reported is indeed considered harrassing, we can then take steps against the offender. These steps may include banning of the offenders Everquest account. I hope this helps solve your problem.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Good Luck,</font></p>
