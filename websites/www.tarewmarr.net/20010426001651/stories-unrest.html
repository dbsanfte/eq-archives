        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It had been a long dreary war against the Aviak's.  So long in fact that I forget the reason it had started.  My wife and I having been on the front for over a year, laying siege to the houses in the trees, finally decided to leave the war to the fresher recruits.  So we packed up our camp and decided to take a tour of Norrath.  See the wonders that our world had to offer us.  Now I pray that we can continue that journey.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was a peaceful night on the continent of Faydwer, Evie and I had decided that it was nice enough to go take a stroll.  We had heard stories of a place called Dagnor&#146;s Cauldron, where scalding hot water bubbled forth from the ground forming a lake.  I remember it well, we hurried along at a slightly increased pace hoping to get there before morning so we could watch the sunrise.  It had been a long time since we had shared such a moment.  Fate on the other hand, being the fickle mistress that she is, had other plans for us.  We had reached the shoreline and were settling down to await daybreak when a fierce storm came crashing down on us out of nowhere.  We grabbed what we could and ran to an outcropping of rock and ducked beneath it.  It sheltered us some but the wind continued to drive the rain at us.  Huddled in the tiny cave, I conjured up an eye so that I might scout the area for a better place to wait out the storm.  Willing the eye out into the storm, I looked for hours to no avail.  Suddenly Evie screamed, bringing me out of my trance.  She pointed into the darkness.  </font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Over there, look!  I saw a house!&quot;  I squinted but could see nothing in blackness.  Then I saw it, silhouetted against the lightning was a huge estate.  I laughed aloud, we were saved.  We ran towards the grounds of the estate, didn&#146;t stop till we were on the porch.  Just then Evie doubled over clutching her head, seeming to be in a lot of pain.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Get away, we must get away!  There is great evil here!&quot; She grabbed my arm and pulled me back into the storm.  Ice cold rain beating down on us we ran to the entrance of the estate.  The massive stone archway over the entranced afforded us enough cover from the storm that we stopped there.  We set up a small camp and decided to wait out the storm here.  We took turns keeping watch, hoping whatever evil was in the house had not noticed out presence.  </font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I awoke this morning to find the storm had been replace by a thick churning wall of mist.  Evil magic&#146;s causing it to thicken whenever we approach.  I feel that we have been trapped here.  By what do I know.  I am writing this so that you will know of our fate and what has become of us.  I only hope that this message reaches Tzeen, Regent scribe of the Crimson Sky Empire.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>March 27 3177</b>&#9;</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It has been a week since we first came to this place.  I believe others may be trapped here with us as well.  I came upon a corpse earlier while I was scouting the area, I knew whoever this was must of died recently because the death beetles had yet to discover and feast on the lifeless body.  I buried him as best I could and continued on.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>March 28 3177</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Outside inspection of the house has revealed nothing.  What few windows there are have been boarded up from the inside.  Evie and I can only guess that foul undead haunt the house.  We have seen some weak undead patrolling the grounds around the house.  Ghouls and Jack O&#146; Lanterns run the hedge mazes near the houses front entrance.  We have are planning to go inside the house tomorrow.  May the gods watch over us.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>March 29 3177</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We entered the house today and boy what a rush.  Zombies and even some skeletal monks greeted Evie and me.  The battle that ensued was fierce, and I have tried to record it here in my journal as best as I can recall.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Slowly opening the front door, I looked inside.  The anticipation of the unknown flooding me with adrenaline.  The gloomy darkness of the house prevented us from seeing to far in.  Evie and I glowed as our protective spells swirled around our bodies.  We started down one of the hallways, when the torches on the wall started to flicker very badly.  That is when I heard the cackle of the skeleton monk.  He was charging down the hallway with his friends close behind him.  Evie and I ran out of the house back to our camp, the group of undead close behind.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The monks first!&quot; I yelled to Evie as we turned to make our stand.  Flame sprung from my hands washing over the monk, charring his bones.  Evie stuck forth at the skeleton, exploding it in a flash of bright light.  Evie and I cheered then attacked the remaining two beasts.  Swinging her mace fast and hard, chips of bone flew in all directions as Evie bashed the second monk who had arrived.  I turned my attention to the zombie that had started to beat on me.  My fingers traced intricate patterns in the air and the earth came up and grabbed the feet of my attacker.  I drew back away from him as my leatherskin absorbed its last blow.  Tendrils of electricity burst forth as I spoke the incantation, forming a giant ball of lightning in my hands.  It slammed full force into my attacker causing him to dance and fall to the ground as the lightning arced through him.  I turned to help Evie to find her bashing all that was left of the skeleton into the ground.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;YOU&#150;&quot; *bash* &quot;LOUSY&#150;&quot; *bash* &quot;GOODFORNOTHING&#150;&quot; *bash* </font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Evie, Evie, Its dead!  Its dead!&quot;  I pulled her away and started to bind the wounds the monk had inflicted on her.  Evie also cast spells on herself causing her wounds to close and the blood to stop flowing from them.  We then started to setup camp as night was beginning to fall.</font></p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><b><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">April 2, 3177</font></b></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally a break in the battles long enough for me to write.  The undead have been pouring from the house ever since our first venture inside.  They seem to want us gone, yet do not allow us to leave.  I fear the worst.  My mana reserves are beginning to run dangerously low.  Evie and I barely have anytime to meditate between the battles now.  I now&#133;</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>April 3, 3177</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I do not know who controls these beasts or if they are under Innoruuk's direct control.  But they seem to know when we are resting and come at us full force.  Yesterday's entry was interrupted by one such attack.  But there was a new beast in that battle, one I have yet to see.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was writing in my journal when I heard the now familiar cackle of the skeletons.  I dropped my quill and notebook though when I heard something new.  At first it sounded like the rustle of dead leaves only deeper.  A rasping of bone on bone that actually formed words.  </font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I am the darkness, I am the Knight.  My armor is stained with the blood of my victims, yours will be next!"</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Kershoc HELP!!!!" Evie was screaming as she ran by me with the army of undead following behind her.  The knight leading the attack reached us first.  Sparks flew from Evie's fingertips as she started her incantation.  Then the knight was bathed in a blinding light that ripped at the very fabric of its being, causing it to stagger backwards several feet.  Summoning up the reserves of my mana, I started my incantation.  Arcane words spoken with the quick movement of my fingers tracing runes and symbols in mid air.  Fire lanced out from my fingers towards the knight and his minions, setting them all aglow.  Many of the weaker ones dropped where they stood while the rest writhed in the flames.  Then they charged.  Three of them ran straight at me.  I started to speak the words of another incantation but was interrupted when the blows' of the skeletal monks started to connect with few protection spells I happen to have on me at the time.  Then they started to fade.  I couldn't concentrate as they pummeled me again and again.  Blood started to flow freely from veins.  I continued to attack, lodging the dragoon dirk in whatever joint I could.  I had long lost sight of Evie but knew she must have been okay when I heard the death cry of the knight.  I wiped the blood from my eyes to see two barbarians running towards us.  One dressed in a full suit of bronze; the other looked to be wearing blackened iron.  Blue fire seemed to spring from the hands of the barbarian then envelop me.  I felt familiar warm sensation throughout my body.  I could feel my insides bind back together, and my wounds close up.  Then the other barbarian joined the fray.  Wielding a weapon in both hands she starting attacking the skeletons.   She quickly reduced them to piles of bones lying on the ground.  Evie came running.  </font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"DAKO!! JAYCEE!!  I am so happy to see you two!"</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Aye," I started to sit down, but collapsed from fatigue. "You two came along at just the right time.  I wouldn't have lasted much longer.  How are you and your fianc&eacute;e faring?"</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>April 27, 3177</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nearly a month has passed since I had a chance to write in my journal.  The undead seem to be slowing, or maybe it is because of our friends who have joined us.  Dako and Jaycee are a welcome pair.  We have traveled with them before and even served beside them during our stay in the avian war.  We also joined up with a monk who also happened to be trapped here as well.  Her name is Dorigen, a most welcome addition to our group.  My time is short so I now must bring this entry to a close.  I shall write as long as I can in hopes that they will be found if we are not</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>May 3, 3177</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As time went on and our death toll on the undead grew to the hundreds we noticed the fog clearing. If I didn&#146;t know any better I would think the powers of this place were weakening.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Friday May 7, 3177</b></font><b><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;</font></b></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just as I thought without mentioning anything the others have also noticed the fog thinning. Also Evie&#146;s often occurring flashes of evil induced pain have been few and far between.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>May 11, 3177</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As having discussed as a group we decided to send someone to try to escape through the fog. Evie and I will not leave, thus Dako and Jaycee say they will not leave at least until someone comes to take their place. Dorigen then looked around without saying a word picked up the note I had written to give to someone in contact with the Crimson Sky Empire, gave a quick smile and a fast wave and dove head first into the fog as if it was thick water.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>May 13, 3177 </b></font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It has been two days and many victories with their fair share of close calls. We have done some minor exploring of the mansion during rest times. I had used my spell of levitation to lift me up over the hedge maze. Looking into the window of the top floor I must have been imagining it but I saw what looked like some hideous giant severed hand! And still no reply from Dorigen, no one has said anything but we all fear the worsted. </font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">May, 3177 </font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We had been doing some more exploration of the house after we had temporarily cleared all of the undead scum for a time. Dako had gone into what looked like a small library, trying to pick up a book to his utter surprise a secret doorway to what looked like some sort of storage area or basement. After yelling for us all while looking around the corner we barely made it to the room as he ran with the speed of a wolf down the hallway passed us trailing behind him a gigantic skeleton with protruding barbs of bone. We quickly vanquished it but we all had our hands ripped apart from hitting such a daemon! </font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Still no word from Dorigen&#133;&#133;</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>May, 3177 </b></font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We were all resting and talking to each other in fear of going mad with the stress and sleepless nights. When all of a sudden I burst out laughing hearing a pleasant sound of quickly running feet and lovely music. To my surprise it wasn&#146;t only me but all of us who had silenced listening in anticipation.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the sound came closer it sounded as if it was&#133;. Couldn&#146;t be! ,  Is that a drum?  Suddenly Evie shouted &quot;ARIADNE&quot; and that brought a great smile across everyone&#146;s face. Coming though the fog burst this shinny young bard with a twinkle in her eye having a drum in her hand and pulsing colors of purple fluxing around her. She then through her head back letting out a great scream when suddenly some sort of skeleton who had come up behind us had its head explode It fluxing colors our orange. Hugs all around commenced when Tzeen seemingly stepped out of a shadow behind us and patted me on the back whispering they had gotten the message and she was all right. Tired but all right. </font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ariadne then said &quot;for the love of all things holy what a trip, you would have NOO idea how hard it is to get a necromancer through Freeport then on and off a boat without getting killed! Not to mention passed all those stumpys they call dwarves <b>laughs and nudges Tzeen</b>&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The light from the campfire flickered across the courtyard setting the faces of those around it aglow.  Kershoc, trying his best to recall the day&#146;s events, was writing in his journal.  He looked up only to start writing again as a remark from Tzeen sparked his memory.  Tzeen was somewhere off in the shadows shunning the light, but his remarks about the &quot;inferior races&quot; could still be heard in the conversation.  Music floated in the night air as Ariadne strummed on her lute.  She sat back and looked at the house.</font></p>
        <p> <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;You know, if it wasn&#146;t for all the undead and rotten furniture this would be a really nice place.  Just look at it.  The hedge maze garden, the fountains right over there.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Have you taken a whiff from the fountain lately.&quot; Evie spoke having finished her praying.  &quot;Smells like something crawled into them and died.&quot;  A sharp note burst forth from the lute with a small flash of light as Ariadne plucked at a string.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Well I know that they stink now, but think of them if they were new, this would be a very nice place to call home.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I think they are fine as they are.&quot; Tzeens voice floated from the shadows, &quot;If you ask me this is a very fine place to live as it is.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Of course it&#146;s a fine place for you.  Any vile necromancer of &#145;the inferior race&#146; would love to live here.&quot;  The sarcasm could be heard in Kershoc&#146;s voice.  Tzeen just laughed and wiggled his finger.  A bone separated itself from one of the many piles that littered the ground, flew over and bopped Kershoc on the head.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Ouch!&quot;  Kershoc rubbed the lump that was starting to form.  He smirked and traced a pattern on the ground finishing it with a tiny hole in the center.  Little ants made of fire started marching out of the hole and straight for Tzeen.  They formed two rings around his feet lighting him up.  Tzeen jumped back into the shadows and the little ants followed.  Kershoc fell to the ground laughing.  Tzeen picked up a bone and drew a symbol on it with his finger.  He dropped it and it shattered into a thousand tiny little pieces.  They formed into little ants of bone and chased after the fire ants.  Everyone started laughing now as the army of bone ants chased the fire ants back into their hole.  Kershoc opened his mouth to speak an incantation, but Evie quickly covered it.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Careful now Kershoc, you remember the last time you and Tzeen started your parlor tricks, you two almost caught the mansion on fire.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Awe, come on!&quot; Dako looked to Evie; &quot;It was just beginning to get interesting.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Actually its best Dako,&quot; Ariande patted his shoulder.  &quot;We can&#146;t have them catching the hedge on fire again.  It would ruin those bushes for good.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;&#9;* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</font></p>
        <p> <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;And good riddance,&quot; I yelled making a rude gesture toward the large dilapidated estate.  Turning I followed the rest of the party.  Mist grabbed at our ankles, trying desperately to keep us from leaving.  But without the powerful magics of the house&#146;s residents the mist was powerless.  </font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The sun hung low in the sky, sending fire red streaks through the clouds in a dazzling display.  We set our packs down and began to setup camp at the shoreline to Dagnor&#146;s Cauldron.  After setting up our tents we built a campfire and settled in around it.  I got up and went to my tent, returning shortly thereafter with an oddly wrapped bundle under my arm.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;What do you have there, Kershoc?&quot; Evie asked, eyeing the package carefully.  &quot;You didn&#146;t have that when we stumbled upon Unrest.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This,&quot; I held up the bundle in front of me.  The dirty cloth hung loosely, wrapped around whatever was inside.  &quot;Is a gift to all of us.  A gift that I happened to liberate from our good for nothing hosts.  Oh well, they shouldn&#146;t have left it just lying around in the basement.  But first, I want to congratulate everyone for the excellent job they did in there, and for not getting dead.  So,&quot; I removed the cloth to reveal an old dusty barrel.  Taking a wooded tap from within my robe I drove it into the bottom of the barrel.  &quot;Drink UP!  Some of the best wine I have yet to find.&quot;  Everyone let out a cheer, grabbing his or her mugs and gathering around the wine cask.  Dako held up his mug and cleared his throat.  </font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;A toast! To friendship, life, and lots of loot!&quot; Dako held up his mug to the rest of them.  Standing next to Evie, Ariadne, and Jaycee, I held up my mug.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;And to the beautiful women we can share it all with.&quot;  Everyone else laughed, clinked their mugs together before taking a drink and settling back down around the fire.  </font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;So friends, where shall we venture tomorrow?  What evil besides myself shall we hunt down and vanquish from this land?&quot;  Snickers traveled through the group at Tzeen's, second question.  Ariadne plucked a few odd notes out on her lute.  Sitting up she stared into the fire.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I have heard rumors of giant lizards who have taken up arms in the swamps of Innothule.  According to some different sources I have even heard that they have taken over the ruins of Cazic Thule.  I was looking into it before we got Kershoc&#146;s message.  We could always go there.&quot;  Ariadne looked around.  Everyone nodded in agreement and started talking about the trip.  I got up and motioned Tzeen to follow.  Refilling my mug I walked out to the shore and sat down on a large stone.  Aqua goblins walked the shoreline jumping in and out of the water chasing the fish.  Tzeen soon made his way down and sat down next to me.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;You wanted to speak to me?  Anything serious?&quot;  Tzeen looked inquisitive.  </font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Oh no, nothing really.  I just had an idea.&quot;  I told him what I was thinking and he started to laugh. </font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I wonder what those two are off to?&quot;  Evie looked around noticing that her husband and Tzeen were missing.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;What do you mean?  They are spellcasters that had too much to drink; they are going to blow stuff up!  Or play some kind of prank!&quot; Jaycee laughed aloud.  Suddenly a fireball exploded on the beach lighting up the surrounding area for a short period of time.  Jaycee pointed, &quot;See!  There they go now.  Spellcasters and their egos, Go figure.&quot;  Everyone laughed and sat back to watch the fireworks.  Fireballs exploding, thunder echoing off the mountainside, and a green sickly mist that often took the shape of a hand and seemed to grab in the air.  An hour pasted, everyone had grown tired of watching the show and went off to bed.  Tzeen and myself slowly crept up on the campsite.  We then ran into camp screaming.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Oh My God!  They&#146;re everywhere!  We&#146;re all going to die! Run! AHH!&quot; We ran around in circles with a small army of undead aqua goblins following behind us.  Everyone jumped awake grabbing at whatever weapon happened to be next to him or her and swung at the closest being.  Tzeen and I dropped to the ground laughing at the site of all our buddies in their pajamas swatting at his new pets.  Tzeen waves his hand and all the little skeletons dropped to the ground scattering bones everywhere.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;What the hell!!&quot; Ariadne stamped her foot and let out a high pitched scream, vibrating the air till it glowed orange.  Tzeen and I stopped laughing.  </font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Spellcasters, Go figure!&quot;  Jaycee rolled her eyes and went back to her tent.  Evie walked over and slapped me across the face.  </font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I told you not to drink!!  You always get like this!!  You cannot hold your liquor!&quot;  She turned around and stormed off to our tent.  Tzeen and I looked at each other and shrugged as everyone else went back to sleep.  </font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Oh well, it was fun while it lasted.  Guess we better get some sleep too.&quot;  Tzeen remarked as he got up and headed to his tent.  I stretched out next to the fire and fell asleep.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I got up early the next day and sat in the middle of camp meditating.  Words and runes flashed through my mind as I went over and over the incantations, memorizing them and making sure that I have the patterns firmly etched into my mind.  Raising my arms I start the incantation, repeating the ancient words over and over as I trace patterns into the air above my head.  The space in front of me began to bend and distort as the magics of my spell ripped the fabric of space open.  The opening shimmered like the top of the nearby lake, deep blues and bright whites.  As I chant the opening starts to gain definition and clarity.  You can see a bridge and four huge spires arcing upwards into the sky.  Finishing my spell I anchor the portal in place, and rise.  </font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Okay people no worrisome boat trip back.  The door is now open.&quot;  Everyone finished packing their packs, walked up to the hole, and stepped through.</font></p>
