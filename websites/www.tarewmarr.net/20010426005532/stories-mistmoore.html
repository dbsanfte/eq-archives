    Today I have walked into hell on Norrath, pure evil flows from these walls that surround me.  Today I have seen many gruesome sights, many to horrible to mention. I fear this may be one of my last entries, I dont want to die in this horrible place, no sir. Its getting late and we are planning an attack., I should put you away my friend.

    This place scares me more now then ever. The comfort of writing is the only thing that keeps me in this horrible place. I saw a beautiful High Elf Magician struck down by a horrible old crone called a Will Sapper...terrible monstrosity....  My group is Enthusiastic about the attack planned for later, I however am not. Many corpses litter the hall, and I do not wish to join them. The druid of the group has died already, fortunatly, we were able to beat the Ghoulish fiend that killed him into a bloody heap. There are a few passing clerics who come and go, perhaps I may ask to revive him. My bardic friend has payed for his mistake of coming to close to a grave, he was pulled into the ground by a hand covered in steel and blood. I did not reach him in time.... I must stop for today. I hope I might write later.

    The spring air wofts into the Graveyard where we are camped, today we met a Warder of Ro named Ssynithi, he is here for a rose from his love's crypt. I fear if we help him we might die, but I feel for him, I may try and convince my group to help him. I will write later.....

    Ah...a welcome sight, sun. The clouds finally parted today and the rain has stopped. Another group of adventures driven from the castle have passed us today. Many horrible creatures in tow....I fear that may be me and my friends next, hope is the only thing that keeps me here. Hope of adventure, money, new found power, all keep me here. The "man" known as Ssynithi has died, killed by another group driven mad by the horrors of this place. I will tell of the assault planned if I make it out alive....

     The assault went well, no one was lost and many creatures fell, I feel for the one death we fell witness too. A fellow child of Halas dressed in all blue Centaur Armor fought against the Hearld of his doom bravely, I wished to help, but could not without falling myself. I have found his name out from his partner, Kyras...If I can make it home I shall try and find his family....

     This is my final journal entry from my adventure to Mistmoore Castle, my friends are all dead, I am the only one left. I was the only one who ran from the final counterstrike on our group. I plan to head back to Kelethin with my bootie, many will ask where my companions are, I will just nod and walk past I suppose. The warrior in the group, a surprisingly noble troll, fell to a group of the Initates of this horrible castle cult. The goodhearted Magi has been beaten to death by a Glyphed Ghoul that suddenly attacked him. And finally our Enchanter died ironically, she used her powers of charm to enchant a Guard and have it fight for us, but suddenly a vampire enchanter came from the dark corner and drug her into the castle with his power. I know not what has become of her. I am near to kelethin, and after I rest I will return to the Icy Peaks I call home. Perhaps I shall find sanity at home, and perhaps I will be compelled to return, To Mistmoore.....
