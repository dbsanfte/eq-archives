It all started on wednesday, when we went to PoTime to advance further in the last remaining high end zone in Everquest. The obstacles wle had to overcome were  the gods in the zone's 5th tier and as you could read up in the last news, we managed to get them all killed, leaving one up for the next day to be able to zone into the next chamber in Time.<br />
But what happened then ?<br />
<br />
Some people in San Diego thought it was a clever thing to do some changes on those gods, hence resetting the zone on thursday. Oh joy, well then. So we fought all the way up to tier5, leaving some god up again for next day. We went to bed with happy thoughts (tm) expecting us to advance next days.<br />
<br />
Great !<br />
<br />
Shit !<br />
<br />
Friday Time was reset again and we had to start over again. Im not going to complain about getting more loot from the gods there, but when you always have the finishing line this close, it sucks to have to start over.<br />
So saturday we came back to kill what we left up on friday and yay, zone was not reset ! But we decided to suck and not to kill tier5 this day. Was one of those days... you know :)<br />
<br />
After 4 days in a row, killing same gods over and over, it had to be done today.... and we did it !<br />
At 21:34:05 CET Quarm was hailed the first time by a Darkwind member on Antonius Bayle.<br />

At 21:50:05 the first Darkwind member was slain by Quarm.<br />

If you thought high end Everquesting was all about killing big mobs and getting loot, you are so damn wrong.<br />
It's all about wiping.<br />
Wiping over and over.<br />
<br />
I can't imagine what those nutsacks in San Diego thought when they brought this mob into game and i'm not sure if they were thinking at all, but i am pretty sure this mob is far from being killable right now.<br />
His AEs are just insane (one does 3000 dmg every 10- 30 sec.). His melee output seems ok tho. His adds (oh yeah, SoE loves adds !!) aren't really necesary to make this encounter impossible.<br />
<br />
This is the furthest we go him: <img src="http://darkwind-guild.com/pics/20030713news/quarm90.jpg" border=0><br />
<br />
Maybe we were just way to impressed by his size and couldn't manage to come up with any idea how to beat him (yet), but i still believe someone in California is getting a woody just by wiping guilds after letting them spend endless hours in a zone packed with intense fights.<br />
<br />
Guess we might be allowed to see him dead one day, but we deserve a fair shot now and not when they finished other stuff. They should stop wasting time in gimping TT and Saryrn in Time and rather fix other things (no, i don't mean stuck doors in Freeport).<br />
<br />
Quarm needs to be killed asap. We don't want a gimp dragon, but one you have a chance to kill :)<br />
<br />
Here are some shots where you can see how big this Godzilla on steroids is:<br />
