Coirnav, the over-sized lobster that he is, is to put it mildly, annoying. Between him and his cronies, he puts up a considerable fight. When I think of lobsters, I think of nice restaurants you go in, sit down, choose which lobster from the tank you want (you always take the one that looks like your mother-in-law, admit it!)<br />

I'd swear its reverse and he's choosing us!<br />
