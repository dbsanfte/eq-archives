Rallos Zek himself stands between us and the elemental planes. We have been spending a lot of time in the Fortress of Zek since our members have been begging us to go back there day after day, attempt after attempt, wipe after wipe. Who are we to turn them down?<br />

We have died so many times while working on this encounter that hardly anyone even bothers to mention it any longer except in rare circumstances.<br />

We have a working strategy that we from time to time manage to follow, we still need a bit more work on it. It's a damn rush everytime we progress a bit further in this encounter and we would like to thank everyone who showed up day after day for this ordeal.<br><br></font></div></td>
