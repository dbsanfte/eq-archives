I am pretty curious and confused about Tacvi design now. I don't know if designing it Ntov like (aka killing guardian and then happy lootfarming) is intended, or in a few days we will see all the mobs past the goat "tuned". At this point of the game you can't really tell whats intended on eq and whats not :p<br />
<br />
<br />
Obviously in the past days we killed the goat as well, wich I have no pics or anything. Along with Zun'Muram version 23.48b... Maaaan, this mob changes every day.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can change it as much as you want though, we will be always here to bash him!<br />
<br />
<br />
Btw we are still recruiting, <A HREF="http://www.darkwind-guild.com/forum/showthread.php?t=41">click here to know if we need  you!</A><br />
