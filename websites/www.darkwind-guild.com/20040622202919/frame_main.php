The zone scripts are pretty original, and some people is even starting to recover the word "fun" after fighting and beating em.<br />
<br />
And its mainly because to reach this :<br />

<br />
First you have to face a bunch of challenging scripts. Should be this the reason there are many guilds stuck in here right now? We went from a MT tanking a boss in a corner while raid half afk kills from back to face a bunch of zones where you actually need some kind of organitzation to become victorious. Unless your guild been invited to the previously in the beta and you knew already what and how to do, thats it!<br />
<br />
First of all, like always , we proceed to kill Kelekdrix :<br />
<br />

<br />
And continue to the curious and interesting Stonemite script, wich I don't have a better pic than this!<br />
<br />

<br />
Its after this when we meet for first time with Noqufiel.<br />

<br />
Such a shame the first time we wanted to play the friendly guild role and save him, we had no other chance to defeat the cursecaller event, also know as DT event. Pretty fun script!<br />
<br />
Where we already scored quite decent loot :<br />
<br />

<br />
And to finish, we engaged in the last battle Noqufiel himself. Completing this way our last piece for Txevu key, and saving this way the poor Jomica.<br />
