During the past week, we mostly have been sitting our asses waiting for The Runt event to respawn. After a few days we got informed that the event was bugged and would not repop. So there you see us, having to wait for the only available progress mob in the zone, cool.<br />
<br />
Last Friday was the glorious day, zone reseted!<br />
<br />
Today, Sunday 27th we faced for first time the end boss, Zun'Muram. A single weekend is all we needed to defeat the Mastruq Champion event and High Priest, both being exciting battles where the Darkwind stamina and superation spirit made act of presence once again.<br />
<br />
Some people even stayed for the fights instead of going to watch their national team lose in Eurocup! Nothing more to add!<br />

Not even the horde of bugged and warping mobs could stop us to defeat Ixt Hsek Syat. We waited so long for this buggy event to respawn and we could not fail. And we did not, even by having pretty low numbers for it and a truckload of boxed chars.<br />
<br />
Loot was pretty nice :<br />

The next day we explored the caves:<br />

High Priest fight was a blast. Despite the meleeing clerics. Even without having much experience on the fight and without knowing what we could expect from later stages of the event we managed to do a nearly perfect fight, with only one possible result, HP downed on another glorious Sunday!<br />

Zun'Muram next, stay tunned!<br />
