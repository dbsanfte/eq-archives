      <div align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Been barely 2 weeks since Oow was released. All of us had many hopes with this expansion to recover the "fun" lost with Gates of Discord. After 2 weeks I can already tell you that our hopes been untouched so far and Omens of War is looking very promising. One of the best expansions so far up to date.<br />
<br />
On our first oow week, like many others, we dedicated entirely our time to leveling, farming spells and epics quests. Our raid plan started like 2 days ago, and as today we already got our first decent quality rewards.<br />
<br />
Today we visited Riftseekers as a guild for first time. After clearing a few mini nameds around, and getting quite a lot  of the so needed oow spells we dicided to give a shoot to the queen and king of the zone. Wich in both cases resulted on the first ever kill in Eq.<br />
<br />
We started with Queen (Ladies first, you know!) :<br />

<br />
Pretty funny event, and loot wasn't dissapointing.<br />
<br />

<br />
Next in line was the King.<br />
Let me warn you here, sadly this is a very buggy and frustrating event if done wrong. I have no doubt whatsover that it will be tweaked soon.<br />
<br />

<br />
But even after expending hours CRing with this event, due to the unproper design of the fight, we didn't gave up, and earned us the killshoot before the midnight.<br />

King also was so nice to give us our first Oow ancient  rune.<br />
<br />

<br />
Hopefully the drop rate of those in Oow won't be as unproper as in Gates.<br />

Thumbs up!<br><br></font></div></td>
