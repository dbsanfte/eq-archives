I admit I may have been a little wrong about the 'he will die before DoN' thing, but lets not dwell on the past!<br />
Dragons of Norrath's meanest dragon, Vishimtar the Fallen was put to rest by Darkwind today, as <a href=http://www.lavanet.no/progress/index3.html>a serverwide first</a>. Unlike previous expansions, this was beatable at start. Also unlike previous expansions, trying this dragon is fun! No trash to clear for hours, just good old zone & kill that we havent seen for quite a while.<br />
Many guilds are stuck at 24% on this little bugger, but after a few tries, we found his weak point!<br />
Ofcourse you all just want to see pics & loot, so here we go.<br />

Other than that, we've also gone to tacvi to kill Tunat Muram. There was a rumour that he dropped the rarest thing ingame...plate breastplates. Sick of Melee weapons and in dire need of a change of scenary, we whooped his ass. A fun fight, challenging too, and lots of adds!<br />
In the end, we actually got 2 breastplates & a pair of plate leggings. I can still hear our cheap leather classes crying,  making victory even sweeter. Here's a pic, click to enlarge.<br />

We know you're all eager to know what DW is up to, and we hate to dissapoint our fans. Therefor, we bring you this short update to let you know how we're doing against OOW's biggest badass.<br><br />
Now most encounters in Anguish are hard, and the Jelvan event is probably the worst of them. It requires teamwork and 100% attention.  But compared to OMM, this is really a pissover. <br />
Did mata muram seem to be unkillable at first? yes. Did he seem like a mob that has to survive the release date of Dragons of Norrath? yes. Will he make that? Maybe not!<br><br />

Darkwind has been going at him hard, never losing motivation:<br><br />
