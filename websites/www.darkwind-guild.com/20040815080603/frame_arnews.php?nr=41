      <div align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hard times running for EQ. In the past months all the high end guilds been stuck in an unbalanced, unfinished and unrewarding zone. Countless people left eq because of this. We had hard times as well, but didn't give up. Uqua script was "finished" last week and we are happy to announce our efforts paid off yesterday.<br />
<br />
This has been our main goal in the past months :<br />

We knew the encounter was fixed.<br />
<br />
We had a bunch of motivated people.<br />
<br />
We had a cunning plan from our previous attempts.<br />
<br />
What could fail?<br />
<br />
<b>Nothing!</b>. But hey, that would have been too easy.<br />
<br />
<br />
We are Darkwind and we like challenges!. So we tried to get rid of a few people. We tried to wipe a few times, but they stayed! We raided till 1am.. but they stayed! Damn you guys.<br />
<br />
We engaged Barxt script with less than 15 min..<br />

<br />
<br />
I must admit the last 15min were really thrilling, everybody was nervous and shaking, but we couldn't fail. Not this time!<br />
Our member base showed up some impressive stamina, motivation and effort rarely seen in the past months. It could only lead to this :<br />

<br />
<br />
In the middle of an euforic  feeling moving inside us, we even managed to get our last piece for Qvic flag and loot, and being kicked out seconds after. Thrilling!<br />
<br />
<br />
Speaking about loot :<br />
