Its been on the cards for a while now; that trumped up ranger Tallon has needed that bow of his shoved where it don't shine, and im glad to say, after following Sun's advice, he got what was coming to him.<br />

Ok, so you admit your sick, fair enough, thankfully, I am rescued, and was provided with his death.<br />
