As you can see, the picture isn't that descriptive now is it.<br />

What cause all this celebration? ah, now I don't like to blow Darkwinds trumpet too loud, thats a bards job and no respecting druids ever gonna touch a bards horn! That said, the celebrations were prompted by some rather superlative play, in what has got to be one of the most epic fights we've encountered. The result was a rather nice looking corpse that we had to keep the necromancers away from incase of necrophelia.<br />
