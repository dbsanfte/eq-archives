<br />
We expended the last week  reflagging our new people. From Kodtaz to Txevu. We defeated the *new* Noquifiel, wich is quite an annoying fight now. All of this to be able to face Zun with our full force.<br />
<br />
The result :<br />

<br />
The result couldn't be other than looting our toughest enemy coprse after an exciting battle. Finally our efforts paid off, the entrance to Tacvi opened for Darkwind.<br />

<br />
There is your pic of the corpse. Send by someone who wanted his minute of fame on this news. I will let you guess who!<br />
<br />
Now its the turn for what everybody wants to see, the loot! <br />

<br />
After everything was sorted we took a peek inside Tacvi, last zone from Discord.<br />

<br />
<br />
We didn't really explore much since we had to stop in front of this little low dps dude, like all the others guild who reached the zone. Sorry for those who wanted to see new models! They are just the same ones but x2 bigger!<br />
<br />

<br />
In any case whole zone is supposed to be tuned and working correctly after Wednesday's patch, so stay tuned!<br />
