Yesterday was happy flag day in the DW camp.<br />
After having lost to Behemoth once before we decided it was time to try to act in a somewhat professional manner and down him. And so the DW spam-hailing  began!<br />
<br />
<b>8:58pm, CoD - Things to keep in mind</b><br />
Still in our professional mindset we charged over to CoD to complete the Caprin script. Everything went like clockwork up to a certain point.<br />
----<br />
Kalaar tells dwraidorders:3, 'any pets die to enrage and youre fucking fired'<br />
<br />
Avhi Escron has become ENRAGED.<br />
Minka`s pet has been slain by Avhi Escron!<br />

Jartik has been slain by Avhi Escron!<br />
Kaner has been slain by Avhi Escron!<br />
Zabartik died.<br />
Etc...<br />
<br />
Maniacal laughter echoes around the room as the ancient dark lich uses the freshly dead body to summon forth even more reanimated reavers. <br />
Etc...<br />
<br />
Avhi Escron has been slain by Lisalee!<br />
Kalaar tells the guild, 'we are ok...there are only 96 reavers up'<br />
----<br />
Yes folks, from 0 to 96 adds in about 5 seconds. Even by DW fuckup standards this is mightily impressive. After some "tactical regrouping" we continued and completed the event without any further mishaps.<br />
<br />
<b>Aerin'Dar</b><br />
Since we are this nice mom and pop guild and take care of our members we headed for PoV to get our last stragglers flagged for HoH. This went according to plan and they lived happily ever after.<br />
<br />
<b>Emperor ZZZZzzzzzzzzz</b><br />
Emperor Ssraeshza, the bestower of loot, turned out to be a real sleeping pill. Now I remember why I hadn't set foot upon Luclin since PoP came out. We did get some nice loot of which I have no screenshots whatsoever.<br />
<br />
<b>Uncle Agnarr</b><br />
We returned to the Bastion of Thunder to get a few more Karana flags. The fight was fun, casualities few and we did get some nice loot of which I have no screenshots whatsoever.<br><br></font></div></td>
