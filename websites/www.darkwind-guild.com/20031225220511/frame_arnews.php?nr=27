<b>Plane of Time</b><br />
Last night we fought our way through the zone and after quite some time we reached  TT, Saryrn and the Zeks. We had the initial five scripts beaten before this but sadly PoTimeB crashed on us while working on the second set of scripts that night.<br />
<br />
I was quite sceptical of PoTime when I first saw the five starter scripts but I must admit that they are a lot of fun. Getting our dear and beloved members to form balanced teams that are able to beat the respective events is of course an adventure in itself. <br />
<br />
One minor feature that I like a lot is that the destination of the PoTimeA portals change as your raid progresses and beats each stage of the event. If you join up late you get dropped off pretty much right next to your raiding buddies. Nothing groundbreaking, pretty slick nonetheless.<br />

We've been living in the Plane of Time the last few days and as far as I can tell most of us are looking forward to further raiding in there. Hopefully we'll have some more updates in the coming days.<br><br></font></div></td>
