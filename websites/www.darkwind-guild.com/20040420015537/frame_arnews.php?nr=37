As you saw in the last news, SoE gave us one high end zone to raid in (and wipe over and over) with a final mob who was impossible to kill. And i had to rant !<br />
What really surprised us, was that SoE repatched this ugly dragon and tweaked him so he became doable. Not too easy, but doable :)<br />
<br />
So he went from being a big, angry beast...<br />

<br />
to a big, dead, headless beast:<br />

Thank you SoE for that fast fixing. And even if high end guilds often rant about broken content, we have to thank you for the game you are providing to us. After all, we like it. Else we wouldnt be playing (i guess).<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh yes, we got some decent loot <i>(but im sure you all saw it on Lucy already, since people who cant kill mobs themselves at least have to feel uber by submitting other's loot)</i>:<br />
