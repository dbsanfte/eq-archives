The zone scripts are pretty original, and some people is even starting to recover the word "fun" after fighting and beating em.<br />
<br />
And its mainly because to reach this :<br />
<br />

<br />
First you have to face a bunch of challenging scripts. Should be this the reason there are many guilds stuck in here right now? We went from a MT tanking a boss in a corner while raid half afk kills from back to face a bunch of zones where you actually need some kind of organitzation to become victorious. Unless your guild been invited to the previously in the beta and you knew already what and how to do, thats it!<br />
<br />
First of all, like always , we proceed to kill Kelekdrix :<br />
<br />

<br />
And continue to the curious and interesting Stonemite script, wich I don't have a better pic than this!<br />
<br />
<center><img src="http://darkwind-guild.com/pics/Alehop/6thJuneNews/mite.jpg" border=0></a></center><br />
<br />
Its after this when we meet for first time with Noqufiel.<br />
<br />
<center><img src="http://darkwind-guild.com/pics/Alehop/6thJuneNews/noq1.jpg" border=0></a></center><br />
<br />
Such a shame the first time we wanted to play the friendly guild role and save him, we had no other chance to defeat the cursecaller event, also know as DT event. Pretty fun script!<br />
<br />
Where we already scored quite decent loot :<br />
<br />
<center><img src="http://darkwind-guild.com/pics/Alehop/6thJuneNews/loot1.jpg" border=0></a></center><br />
<br />
And to finish, we engaged in the last battle Noqufiel himself. Completing this way our last piece for Txevu key, and saving this way the poor Jomica.<br />

In the past months all the high end guilds been stuck in an unbalanced, unfinished and unrewarding zone. Countless people left eq because of this. We had hard times as well, but didn't give up. Uqua script was "finished" last week and we are happy to announce our efforts paid off yesterday.<br />
<br />
This has been our main goal in the past months :<br />
<br />
<br />
<center><img src="http://darkwind-guild.com/pics/Alehop/13thMayNews/barxt50.jpg" border=0></a></center><br />
<br />
<br />
We knew the encounter was fixed.<br />
<br />
We had a bunch of motivated people.<br />
<br />
We had a cunning plan from our previous attempts.<br />
<br />
What could fail?<br />
<br />
<b>Nothing!</b>. But hey, that would have been too easy.<br />
<br />
<br />
We are Darkwind and we like challenges!. So we tried to get rid of a few people. We tried to wipe a few times, but they stayed! We raided till 1am.. but they stayed! Damn you guys.<br />
<br />
We engaged Barxt script with less than 15 min..<br />
<br />
<center><img src="http://darkwind-guild.com/pics/Alehop/13thMayNews/5min.jpg" border=0></a></center><br />
<br />
<br />
I must admit the last 15min were really thrilling, everybody was nervous and shaking, but we couldn't fail. Not this time!<br />
Our member base showed up some impressive stamina, motivation and effort rarely seen in the past months. It could only lead to this :<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Another glorious night for Darkwind's history.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
In the middle of an euforic  feeling moving inside us, we even managed to get our last piece for Qvic flag and loot, and being kicked out seconds after. Thrilling!<br />
<br />
<br />
Speaking about loot :<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
And there are some pics of the fight, enjoy!<br />
