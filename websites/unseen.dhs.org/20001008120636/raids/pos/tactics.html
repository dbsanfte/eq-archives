    <p><font face="Arial" size="5">Guide to the Plane of Sky's First Section</font>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">First, you're correct in comparing POA to the
    temple of Sol Ro.&nbsp; That's really what it's like.&nbsp; The only real
    differences are that the quests are all (we believe) to be completed in-zone
    and of course they are much, much, much harder than anything one sees in
    Norrath proper. Also, it's possible to see very nice item drops on the mobs
    without doing the quests at all, so if one likes he/she can treat the zone
    like Fear/Hate and simply kill stuff hoping for loot.&nbsp; The items we've
    seen drop on Mith Marr so far are insanely nice.&nbsp; Think of Runed
    Bolster Belts haste-belts off dragons, only with nice stats added like +5
    str +5 agil +5 vs magic.&nbsp; These are from the &quot;lower&quot; level
    mobs in Air too. When the most mundane mobs in a zone drop stuff that's
    better than dragon loot, it makes the mouth water as to what is available
    further up and in.&nbsp; Only one person on our server has completed a quest
    so far (he happens to be my guild leader and good friend) but since the
    warrior quests are bugged he lost his items and the GM isn't going to be on
    to restore them until Tuesday so we can't tell what the Azure Ruby Ring's
    stats are yet.</font>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">First things first:</font>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Air, like Hate, is reachable only via a
    Wizard group gate spell and it requires a &quot;Cloudy Stone of Veeshan&quot;
    as a reagent.&nbsp; The stone is available only in Erudin to my knowledge
    and it costs around 250 plat. Unlike Fear or Hate, which are basically one
    contiguous area like other zones in Norrath, Air is a series of
    &quot;islands&quot;, most of modest size, floating in the sky.&nbsp; Each
    island can sort of be thought of as its own &quot;mini zone&quot; in a way.&nbsp;
    Most islands are either higher or lower than those around them.&nbsp; You
    can (with levitate on) always get to lower islands by running over the edge
    and sinking down to them, but to get to higher islands you need keys and you
    need to use them on the right teleporters.</font>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The first island you reach upon gating in is
    filled with eight fairies called Thunder Spirits, and these are ringed
    around the edges spaced equally apart.&nbsp; They are exactly level 50 and
    will con indifferent to all players.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the center of the island
    is a named PC called the Thunder Spirit Princess, and she will con red to a
    50 (meaning 53 minimum) but also indifferent.&nbsp; The only other NPC in
    the island is a dwarf named The Keymaster.&nbsp;&nbsp; On opposite ends of
    the island are two pads set into the ground.&nbsp; Clicking on the reveals
    the message &quot;It's locked and you're not holding the key&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    If you click on the Keymaster you will see he sells three items:&nbsp; a Key
    of Swords for about 450 plat, another key (forget the name but it looks like
    a Minotaur Horn) for 200ish, and a coffin (for Necro summon corpse spell)
    for 140 or so. The Sword Key will take you to island 2 higher up.&nbsp; The
    other key (Key of Winds maybe?) will take you to Azarack Island even further
    in.&nbsp; There is another way to get keys, however.&nbsp; Each Thunder
    Spirit drops three rabbits' feet and three tiny swords upon being killed.&nbsp;
    To use them, you have to first kill the Princess to get another NPC to spawn
    in her spot.&nbsp; (This theme of killing one NPC to force the spawn of
    another is common in Air it seems).&nbsp; It's a good idea to start with the
    princess anyway because she will assist the Thunder Spirits when they are
    attacked.&nbsp; Once the princess is dead, a little halfling will spawn and
    he will respond to /hails.&nbsp; Keep /hailing him or he will disappear.&nbsp;
    If you give him the rabbits feet and tiny swords (one at a time), he will
    return one of each key the dwarf sells.&nbsp; Since each Spirit drops parts
    for three of each key, and since there are eight Spirits in all, a group of
    24 can all gain 2 keys from this island.&nbsp; There are NO faction hits at
    all for killing Thunder Spirits or the Princess, so you will not be KOS if
    you do this.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, this process seems to be intended by
    Verant in order to advance in the zone, because items for the quests drop on
    the Thunder Spirits as well - usually &quot;tesseras&quot;, various types of
    which are required by almost every class.&nbsp; Another&nbsp; bit worth
    knowing about this first island is that it contains the hidden cave with the
    efreetis who dole out the quests.&nbsp; To see it, use 3rd person view while
    on the island and look around.&nbsp; You will find it.&nbsp; Once inside,
    you can talk to the NPCs until you find the one who gives your quests.&nbsp;
    One caveat, though.&nbsp; Once in the cave, you cannot get back to the first
    island. You must zone out and re-gate.</font>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Speaking of zoning out.&nbsp; Air can be
    safely exited simply by running off the edge of any of the islands and
    falling back to earth.&nbsp; You will zone, then reappear in the OOT just
    outside the East Freeport docks no worse for wear.&nbsp; You do not die from
    falling.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, any keys in your possession WILL disappear
    when you zone/log/go LD.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Thunder Spirits seem to respawn
    every eight hours or so.&nbsp; If you lose your keys and they are not
    spawned, you have to bite the bullet and buy new ones from the dwarf (ouch).&nbsp;&nbsp;
    To use the keys, hold them in your hand (on the cursor) and left click on
    the teleporter.&nbsp; You will instantly appear on the&nbsp; destination
    island.&nbsp; Before going onto them, though, some other things about island
    one.&nbsp;&nbsp; First, you cannot bind there, though you may camp anywhere
    in the zone.&nbsp; Second, when fighting the mobs there, do NOT use any AE
    spells, or you will agro the efreetis in the cave and they will kill you
    before you can blink.&nbsp; This includes any AEs that will agro mobs in
    normal zones, including AE stuns.&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, and this goes for the
    zone in general, summoning spells for casters are tricky in Air.&nbsp; The
    only pets mages can summon are Air pets (makes sense), and these appear not
    as white elementals, but as little female Efreetis with annoying laughs
    (think of Elvira, Mistress of the Dark in genie gear). Necro pets seem to be
    heavily nerfed in this zone.&nbsp; Some say their level 49 pet spell summons
    a level 1 pet (unconfirmed though they are weak). Enchanter and Shaman pets
    conjure as normal. Using the Key of Swords on the correct teleporter will
    take you to Island 2, also called Noble Island or Windmill Island.&nbsp;
    This is a tiny one that contains simply a large, vaguely sinister-looking
    windmill, and three NPCs.&nbsp;&nbsp; The main mob is a large Efreeti called
    Noble Djorn who cons red and indifferent.&nbsp; He will respond to /hails
    with greetings and an invitation to remain on his island to keep him company
    now that his &quot;relatives&quot; are gone.&nbsp; The other two NPCs are
    called &quot;Bladestorms&quot; and resemble the rare Blade Dervish from
    unrest.&nbsp; They are basically a whirling circle of swords and they also
    con red indifferent (to a level 50).&nbsp; These circle the windmill in a
    repeatable pattern.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Noble is attacked, both bladestorms
    will agro and vice versa.&nbsp; All three mobs are linked.&nbsp; Djorn
    carries a mace in his left hand and an intriguing bag in his right.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    He is usually pulled to the next island over where there is room to fight,
    but let me mention now that he is tougher than any mob outside of the Gods
    in Fear and Hate, and maybe tougher than them (though he has been brought
    down already).&nbsp; He hits for over 300 and will triple attack for 1000+
    in one round.&nbsp; He is impervious to player spells.&nbsp; The nastiest
    thing about him, though, is a wickedly deadly AE spell that will take 1000+
    HP off in one shot.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bladestorms are easier kills if they can
    be pulled solo and are doable by a group of 24.&nbsp;&nbsp; The other
    interesting thing about island 2 is that the windmill can be stopped and
    started by clicking on the shaft inside.&nbsp; Whether this is for
    &quot;show&quot; or part of a puzzle is unknown.</font>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There are no teleports on Noble Island.&nbsp;
    Directly across from it, though, is a larger island with a temple on it and
    multiple mobs.&nbsp; This island is slightly lower and can be reached with
    levitate and SOW (or jboots) by running and floating down to it (though it's
    a close thing -make sure you keep looking up and running the whole way).&nbsp;
    This is the next island most groups clear.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has four main
    types of mobs.&nbsp; The first look like harpies.&nbsp; The second look like
    air elementals.&nbsp; The third look like evil eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth
    look like giant red willowisps. All are 53+ and indifferent, so this island
    can be explored in safetylike the first two.&nbsp; Inside the temple are
    three &quot;named&quot; mobs and these are much tougher than the roamers.&nbsp;
    In the left front corner is an &quot;avenging gazer&quot; (evil eye type), a
    &quot;heart harpie&quot; in the middle and &quot;Gorgalask&quot; in the
    right front corner.&nbsp; Gorgalask will respond to /hails, but don't carry
    the conversation all the way or she will agro on you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    other feature of this island (called &quot;Gorg Island&quot; by most, or
    Island 3) is the teleporter near the edge in front of the temple.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Most groups camp near the teleport and pull and kill single roamers.&nbsp;
    Of the &quot;harpy&quot; type roamers, there are two flavors.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    First are &quot;spirited harpies&quot;, which are casters with pets.&nbsp;
    Second are &quot;a gorgalask&quot; which seem to be melee only mobs.&nbsp;
    These mobs are handled fairly easily by groups of 24, as are all roamers on
    this island.&nbsp; They hit in the 200's but they are vulnerable to player
    DD spells and debuffs.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two types of air elementals -
    crystalline clouds and &quot;a gust of wind&quot;.&nbsp; These are melee
    mobs as well (I believe - meaning I don't recall seeing them cast - but I
    could be wrong).&nbsp;&nbsp; They are annoying in that like good air
    elementals they can invis themselves, making them impossible to target
    unless you have see invis up or use /assist on someone with it up.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Other than that they are no harder than the harpy-types.&nbsp; The evil-eye
    types, called Watchful Guards, are enchanters and have pets and damage
    shields.&nbsp; These cast a lot as well as hit for high damage.&nbsp; Their
    magic resist seems a bit higher than the others, though they are vulnerable
    as well to PC spells.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pulling singles is straightforward if you
    wait until they are somewhat isolated.&nbsp; The agro ranges in Air so far
    seem normal-sized, not ultra-huge like in the other two planes.&nbsp; The
    only caveat to this is with the three mobs on the back ledge of the temple
    (North side). Pulling these can agro the heart harpy through the back wall,
    which in turn agros the other two temple mobs.&nbsp; One very nice thing
    about the zone being non-KOS, however, is if a pull goes bad, you can let
    the puller die and rez him without the rest of the party being attacked.&nbsp;
    In fact, your puller can agro any mob and haul it back to the group and the
    mob will ignore the other players even if the puller dies.&nbsp; This makes
    pulling in Air heaven compared to Fear or Hate.&nbsp;&nbsp; The roamers drop
    quest items, rarely drop very nice class-specific loot, and always drop
    &quot;an animal figurine&quot;.&nbsp; Have everyone loot one figurine if you
    plan to go higher up.</font>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In any event, once these mobs are cleared,
    you have the meteors (the wisps) hovering above the temple, and the temple
    mobs.&nbsp;&nbsp; The wisps are special cases and so far we mainly leave
    them alone.&nbsp; They are very magic resistant and therefore hard for
    caster-heavy groups to handle. They can be melee to death with 10 tanks or
    so, but we have yet to see any loot of note on them other than research
    pages and minor quest items.&nbsp;&nbsp; That leaves the temple mobs.&nbsp;
    The Gorgalask queen can be pulled by agroing the temple, pulling it to the
    group, and having the puller die or Feign.&nbsp; Keep /hailing the Gorg and
    the other two will return to the temple.&nbsp; Rez the puller if he/she
    died, and hack away.&nbsp; Take note that the Gorg queen is a very tough
    fight.&nbsp; She will resist practically all PC spells so it's melee-only
    for the most part.&nbsp; She is doable with a very tank-heavy group of 24,
    but 30+ is safer.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's necessary to take her down, though, if
    you want to get higher up, because she is analogous to the Princess on
    Island 1.&nbsp; Killing her forces a second NPC to spawn in her spot, and
    this one will hand out keys when given the animal figurines.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    These keys work on the teleporter in front of the temple.&nbsp; As mentioned
    before, the Noble, if attempted, is usually fought on Gorg island since it
    has a big &quot;backyard&quot;.&nbsp; He can be pulled analogously to the
    Gorg queen, by agroing the whole island and /hailing him until the
    bladestorms go back (they most likely move into the temple, amusingly,
    rather than go back to Island 2).&nbsp;&nbsp; When Djorn is killed, a nasty
    uber-mob called the Overseer of Air (or something like that) spawns in his
    place and he is agro and reputed to have a DT like Cazic.</font>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next island up from Gorg island is (I've
    heard) full of Pegasi that are tough fights.&nbsp; The theme seems to be
    clear the boss of each teleport island to get the keys to the next, with the
    mobs getting tougher on each one.&nbsp; I believe only a few servers at this
    point have even begun to fight on Island 4 so I know little of its secrets
    or loot.</font>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This leaves only the second door on Island 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When the mino-horn key is used on this teleport, the player is transported
    to an island full of very red, very agro little fire imps called &quot;Azaracks&quot;
    who hit for 200.&nbsp;&nbsp; This island is viewable (and I'm betting
    reachable via levitate) from Gorg Island.&nbsp; It contains one door and
    presumably there is some way to get keys on that one as well, but to my
    knowledge no one has cleared it yet.&nbsp; It is the only easily-reachable
    island in Air with aggro mobs on it.</font>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It should be noted that this zone has only
    been up for four days and that it likely has innumerable secrets to it that
    haven't even been hinted at yet.&nbsp; As stated, POA is a giant puzzle in a
    sense, and my opinion is that we've barely begun to sort the pieces out, let
    alone put them together.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's generally felt that the majority
    of the zone is geared toward higher-level players (level 55+ if not much
    higher) once the expansion comes out.&nbsp;&nbsp; No one has even seen
    Veeshan yet let alone conned her, but it's been rumored by those who claim
    to know GMs that Veeshan is 75+&nbsp; (whereas Nag/Vox/Cazic etc are 53-55
    mobs).&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, Verant has stated bluntly there is loot in this
    plane that makes gear from Fear/Hate look &quot;like rusty
    broadswords&quot;.</font>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The general reaction I've observed from most
    players in Air has been very favorable.&nbsp; Most of us (including myself)
    will likely be camping there (literally) every night as we figure out more
    and more stuff. Since the early stages of the zone are not KOS, it's
    perfectly safe to log out on Gorg island and come back the next day ready to
    go again. Verant is to be applauded for making what looks to be a very very
    fun zone available to tide us over until Kunark in April :)</font>
