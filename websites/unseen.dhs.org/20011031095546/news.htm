Due to increasing unemployment in Aussieland, and the shutdown of one of our major airlines, comfort items (read BEER) have gone through the roof in pricing as well as scarcety. In short, I was only able to secure FOUR CASES of Walla-Walla-Wallaby whiney bitter ale, and TWO CASES of Drunken Dingo Pale.<br><br>A sober weekend... it was bloody hell.<br><br>Anyhow, that's about all I have to report. Oh, and we won the ringwar with nary a dwarf dead, killed dozekar, vindi, telk, and some other stuff too, although I was too miserable to enjoy it.<br><br>And special thanks to RHAD who pointed out that if I drink charcoal lighter fluid, I'll forget about beer for an hour or two, and to LLORAC who er... pointed out something else.<br><br>-Arc</small></td></table></p></font><font color="000000">

Saturday night we arrived in kael with the intention of testing our luck against the vindicator, so once our fearless monks had thrown themselves at him a bit to learn the pull, we got to try him out. After several screw ups with warriors deciding to fall over at inappropriate times, Arclight stepped up to save us all! How a single paladin can tank him for 50% of his life when 4 - 5 warriors using defensive can't, I dont know.. but he did. When we finally put the ugly gimp down (Vindi, not Arc), he  dropped a Breastplate of Vindication for Mithre, and his head for Feileung who went and made some druid gloves with it.<br><br><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://members.iinet.net.au/~freeth/eqscreens/vindi.jpg" BORDER=1></CENTER><br><br>Of course with everyone fired up from the kill, we had to pull the statue.. if only to take a look at. Again we had a few initial problems with the pull, and some early wipeouts due to adds and tanks falling over, but after 10 or so minutes of fighting, we emerged victorious.. I'm sure everyone there will agree he's a really fun fight. He dropped 2 hammers, for Sauroken and Mordi, a Reaver for Rikter, and a Cloak of Falling Stars for Credit.<br><br><CENTER><A HREF="http://members.iinet.net.au/~freeth/eqscreens/statue1.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://members.iinet.net.au/~freeth/eqscreens/statue1_sm.jpg" BORDER=1><br><FONT SIZE=-1>(Click to enlarge)</FONT></A><br>This was one of our first pulls of the statue.. armors decided to warp in when he was at 25% or so, always a nice surprise.<br></CENTER><br><br><CENTER><A HREF="http://members.iinet.net.au/~freeth/eqscreens/statue2.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://members.iinet.net.au/~freeth/eqscreens/statue2_sm.jpg" BORDER=1><br><FONT SIZE=-1>(Click to enlarge)</FONT></A><br>The kill shot.. yay.<br></CENTER><br><br>Sunday we were planning on another dozekar kill.. but people decided to sleep in or something, so with a smaller force we wandered over to Velks after discovering the big boss of the zone was up. Strangely enough all our casters come out of the woodwork for this guy, so with the awesome added power of 4 - 5 necros, we managed to smack Velk down nice and quickly. As a change from dropping wiz/necro loots, he really put out for mages this time. Ironic really given there was only one there.. so grats to Tyna on both Boots and Gloves of Bladecalling.<br><br><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://members.iinet.net.au/~freeth/eqscreens/velk.jpg" BORDER=1></CENTER><br><br>After this we zoomed over to kael again to play with our new found friend the vindicator.. Apparently we caught him in a bad mood or something, because he didn't really want to play nice to start off with. After getting smacked around a few times we finally got a clean pull and put him down. Grats to Trusk on his Boots of Vindication, and Udar (I think) on the head. Didn't get a kill shot of him this time which is no big deal since it woulda looked exactly the same as the one up top anyway.</small></td></table></p></font><font color="000000">
