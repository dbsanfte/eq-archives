    by that much.<br>
 </b>&nbsp; Well, we put up a valiant fight. but in the end, the Giant Wyrm
    cooked us and dined on our burning flesh.&nbsp; I think we learned a lot
    from our little excursion though, at least I know I gained some information
    that will be very beneficial to the next Nagafen Raid I go on.&nbsp; I can
    name a couple pieces of information as to why we failed, but I feel that is
    unimportant due to the information learned.&nbsp; So for everyone that
    attended, a fight hard fought, we lost this one, but will be back with vengeance.&nbsp;
    I will probably be starting some &quot;private access&quot; pages of
    information gathered about the different raids very soon.&nbsp; The privacy
    is to keep prying Verant Eyes out, not all the people of Quellious.&nbsp;
    Information will be released on how to obtain a password in the
    future.&nbsp; Not everyone will receive a password as well.&nbsp; I do not
    want people there who are not going to be contributing to the
    information.&nbsp; This means, the people who will be organizing, planning
    and other key parts to raids will have access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>

    invite those on Quellious who wish to voice their opinions and preferences
    for how to handle the courtesy in organizing raids of key High-Level Raid

    prepared for the meeting just popping in).&nbsp; In your email please give
    me your characters name and level on Quellious.&nbsp; This initial meeting
    will be an attempt to discuss and come to a majority consensus as to how to
    handle courtesy and scheduling of high-level raids in an attempt to draft up
    some kind of rules of courtesy for Quellious and the results of the meeting

    has been created with the intention of improving the communication between
    the raid-ready guilds, individuals, and raid leaders on Quellious and all
    are welcome to come and read the news, articles, and post there.&nbsp;
    Depending on the how successful the Raid meetings go we will be putting up
    and actual Calendar for raid scheduling that all can book into in order to
    further help prevent raid schedule conflicts and divide raid times as fairly
    as possible amongst all on the server.</font></p>
