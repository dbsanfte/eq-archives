That way, as you swing, the horse instinctively tries to eat the carrot, sometimes getting a bite. You, as a loyal stick weilder get your satisfying THUNK, while the horse gets the pulpy orange treat, and sometimes a tooth or two to boot!<br><br>Gradually, you come to love the carrot, and gradually the horse learns to love the stick.<br><br>Hmm, well, I'm not really sure what this has to do with news, the Shadows of the Unseen, or really everquest in general, but I died 15 times tonight!
