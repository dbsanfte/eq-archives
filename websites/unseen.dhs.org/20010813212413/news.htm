An update! Any update they'll say, they'll tell you, they'll well, do as any number of "theys" have done in the past...<br><br>So... what have we been up to these long weeks since the last update?<br><br>Well, not really much of anything. We've gotten the new Faydedoze cow spawn pretty much whupped and flambasted. *shrug* Velk finally fell to our massive zerling tickle torture. Um. Arclight tried to give me, the mighty Fishmaster! a stupid hat.<br><br>On the topic of "stupid hats" and Arclight, all I really have to say is "Meow Meow Meow Meow Meow".<br><br>Get it? Got it?<br><br>Anyhow, if we ever decide to do something interesting we'll let you, our adoring throngs of fans know about it... about three months later.<br><br>As for current news...<br>I have mastered fishing! That is all, collectively, as a guild and an alliance that we've done in the past month.

We tried to get Vanguard a queen's blade but ended up falling short due to an unforseen anomoly in the EQ space-time continum.  Arclight typically calls them "wipeouts".  Not sure what happened, but we failed in our ultimate goal.<br><br>Not that it was all bad.  We did get 2 prince heads, 3 cleric notes, 2 herbilists, some incarnadine boots, TWO incarnadine BP's (grats Aileen and Fatty), and a SoS (grats Teq).  Other nifty things dropped too (No, I'm not talking about people on the raid) but I can't remember what they all were and who they all went to!  <br><br>Thanks all for showing up and giving it a shot.  We will get Vanguard his blade soon enough!<br><br>----<br><br>Sunday was a bit more laid back.  Seems quite a bit of us spent time in Siren's Grotto.  We gained some much wanted xp for our non-60 players (Grats on xp!) :P Plus we got many a weed (grats Rhad) various gem drops, lots of misc. loot, and the pleasure of stomping sirens.<br><br>Afterwords, we went to WW where we found that the scout was ripe for the pickings and we took advantage of it.  Twyne may be an excellent druidic healer, but it takes a special kind of skill to pull the Kromzek captain and get him stuck under the world BEFORE the fight starts.  Suffice it to say, we were able to pull him anyway (Go Lin!) and dropped the captain in a nice, methodical fashion who in turn dropped Aenaminie 5 seconds before he died.  (When they enrage, you turn auto-attack off, elf).  Congratulations to Andy for his neat new bracer!<br><br>Oh yes.  Ggan was hugged.</small></td></table></p></font><font color="000000">

Apparently, Aileen is back and playing somewhat frequently again!  *cheers*<br><br>I'll try to post some news updates in absence of any Derra postings.  I'll start simple and go from there!<br><br>This week in the (da da dum) Shadow News!<br><br>Tonight was a bit slow, but an uber melee group of Shadows led by the fearless Draugrim took out the Coldain Traitor(what's his name) in the caverns near Velks.  Much fun was had, and oh there WAS a looting of a head!  Congrats Draugrim!<br><br>The previous night was also kind of slow but we did manage to make it to Siren's Grotto for some seahorse stomping.  Congrats Ward on the dragonbane leaf(Don't smoke it this time).  After a fun time with some icy terrors, evacs, and Nurl dying we moved to WW where we killed the Kromzek Captain.  Senwen took home some crappy bracer thingy.  Afterwards, we celebrated by trying to eradicate mammoths from the face of Norrath.  Sadly, Mr. Tantor didn't have any tusks(I swore those things that mashed Draugrim to a pulp were tusks!)  But much fun was had!<br><br>This weekend:  More HoT?  Next weekend:  Pirates????</small></td></table></p></font><font color="000000">

Yes, she's so sweet and nice. Kind of like a Cabbage Patch Doll or something.  But there is a darker, hidden <b>Nana</b> that only a few know of!

It's long been rumored that <b>Mrsamoran</b>, recently missing wife of notorious West Coast enchanter <b>Amoran</b>, was in fact a target of the ruler of the Kromzek, King Tormax himself.  Many people speculated that perhaps Tormax had kidnapped her.  Others, more aware of the vicious nature of <b>"Yrab"</b>,  speculated that he himself had her offed, or perhaps even did t himself.<br><br>All of these questions seem as though they'll remain unanswered.  The one thing that we do know is <b>Amoran</b> was recently seen posting screenshots of a new item to <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq">EQ'Lizer</a>.  The item he now wears is:<br><br><img src="http://unseen.dhs.org/derra/050401/wifeslay.jpg"><br clear=all><br><center>Interpret the mystery as you may.<br><br>Tonight we head off to the Plane of Sky.
