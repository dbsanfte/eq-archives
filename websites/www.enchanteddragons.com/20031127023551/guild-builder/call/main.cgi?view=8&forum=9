Generally, there will be at least one shaman present on a raid, which makes the buffing process a lot easier on the beastlords.  In this case, pretty much the only buffs the raid will need from the beastlord are spiritual dominion (or a lower level spell in this line, depending on level of the beastlord) and spiritual vigor.  Now, both of these spells have some stacking issues.  First, the BL crack line of spells.  There seems to be an issue with these spells and the damage absorbstion/mana regen spells that the INT casters have.  From my experience, it seems that they may actually stack, but you need to cast them in the correct order:  BL crack first, then the damage absorber; they won't stack if you reverse the order.  So, that may solve the problem, or maybe there have been changes and this method no longer works, or maybe it depends on which damage absorbing spell you're dealing with (when I discovered the stacking order thing, I was grouping with a necro friend.  In Lume's post, she says there is  an issue with BL crack and the effect from the wizzy epic, which obviously wouldn't be the same spell the necro was using).<br><br>Ok, moving on to the next buff, spiritual vigor.  This spell does not stack with the Brell's line of pally buffs (BSA, BMB, and BSS).  Spiritual Vigor (SV) will overwrite BSA and BMB, but BSS will overwrite SV.  SV also does not stack with a ranger line of buffs (not sure of all the spells in that line, I know Strength of Tunare is one, but there are more).  This is a similar situation to Brell's; SV will overwrite the lower level ranger spells in this line, but SV itself will be overwritten by the higher ranger spells.  Besides that, there is one other stacking issue that I know of with SV:  it does not stack with the effect from the monk epic.  But, the spell is a group buff, so there's not much that can be done to avoid hitting the monks with it too.  If they don't want it, they can click it off.<br><br>So, as long as there is a shammy with the raid, those two buffs are pretty much the only ones you have to worry about keeping up on everyone.  Without a shammy, you have a much bigger task, as you will then need to cast Dex / Sta / IoS / Kragg on the melees, and casting Sta / Ios / Kragg on others as well wouldn't be a bad idea, for the extra HP.  Which will take some time, as BLs don't get group versions of any of these spells.<br><br>note 1:  Talisman of Kragg will overwrite the clerics' line of personal buffs, which the clerics would usually prefer to have instead of Kragg.<br><br>note 2:  I usually don't cast Str on anyone unless they ask for it, because at high levels lots of melees seem to have a lot of Str gear on them, and the extra buff isn't always necessary.  Also, the druid (and I think Ranger?) spell Storm Strength is actually better than our highest Str spell, and then there's another druid spell (Nature's Might?  can't think of the name at the moment) that is a LOT better than our spell, so if someone needs a str buff, they can get a better one from a druid or ranger.<br><br>Ok, next topic:  What spells to have memorized (for combat, after buffing has been taken care of).  <br><br>Here are the spells I usually have memorized:<br><br>1.  Chloroblast:  Even though its only a 428 pt heal, its certainly better than nothing, and I always keep it memmed, just in case.<br><br>2.  Healing of Sorsha:  As I've been on more raids, I actually find that I hardly ever heal my pet.  This spell is more of a hold over from all my time soloing.  Also, I sometimes use it in groups where we don't have any real crowd control, and I stick my pet on an add.  In a raiding situation, adds will most likely be taken care of by mezzes, or by the SA, and not by pets.  Even so, I still prefer to keep this spell memmed, just in case.<br><br>3.  Sha's Advantage:  Another spell I always try to keep up, even when switching out other spells for buffing purposes, etc.  Even though its only a 50% slow, its still way better than nothing if for whatever reason the shammy/chanter is unable to slow the mob.<br><br>4.  Scorpion Venom:  This spell has two uses.  First, its a decent DoT spell.  Doesn't do as much damage as other classes' DoTs, but its still damage.  And, with a duration of only 42 seconds, it usally has a chance to do full damage, whereas mobs might die before some other DoTs have run thier course.  Second, this spell is high aggro, and can be useful for pulling a mob off of a caster.<br><br>5.  Frost Spear:  I usually nuke with this spell whenever it pops, as the 30 second recast time will prevent me from burning through my mana or gaining too much aggro.  However, in dealing with gating mobs, you want to make sure it has enough time to repop so that is available when you need it.<br><br>Those five spells are generally the ones I always have up for combat, the other three vary depending on the situation.  A few suggestions are:<br><br>1.  Your pet haste spell.  If you have the lvl 63 spell Arag's Celerity, this probably isn't necessary, as that spell has a base duration of 45 mins.  However, the next highest spell in the line, Sha's Ferocity, only lasts I think 17 mins, and so it might be nice to keep it memmed so you aren't constantly sitting down to mem it every time it fades.<br><br>2.  Celerity / Alacrity.  There will most likely be shamen and / or enchanters present for haste, but its nice to keep your own memmed, in case they are unable to haste you or someone else for whatever reason.<br><br>3.  Frenzy.  A nice little personal buff spell.  Pretty short duration, which is why you might want to consider keeping it memmed.<br><br>4.  Incapacitate.  I never really used this spell much, but I hear that it causes high aggro, so might be nice to keep up in order to pull a mob off of a caster.<br><br>And finally, in certain situations, you may want to load Savagery (or Ferocity, although at the moment nobody in the guild including me has that spell).  As Savagery uses a peridot and only has a base duration of 6 mins, I wouldn't keep it up on someone all the time, but for big fights where resists are needed, its well worth the cost of the peridot.<br><br>Next topic: raiding AAs.<br><br>Some people like to work on AAs early, some like to split exp between AA and normal, some prefer to put it all off until 65.  There's no right way to do it, but whenever you choose to start working on AA, here are some that I would highly recommend for raiding:<br><br>In Archetype, all three levels of Spell Casting Reinforcement.  This will give a 30% extension to your buffs, which will help you not only in raids, but also solo or in regualr exp groups.<br><br>In Class, Paragon of Spirit, Mass Group Buff, and Pet Discipline.  <br><br>First, Paragon:  this AA gives you the ability to cast a short duration group HP / mana regen buff every 15 mins.  Initially, it is 200 hp and 80 mana per tick , for 6 ticks.  With SCR2, it is extended to 7 ticks, and with SCR3 to 8, for a total of 1600 hp and 640 mana regenerated by every group member over 48 seconds.  This ability is considered a buff and so it can be targeted on another group, not just your own.<br><br>Second, MGB:  I assume you all know what this AA does, hehe.  One cool thing about MGB though, which relates specifially to beastlords, is that it can be used with Paragon, providing 200hp and 80mana per tick regen to an entire raid.<br><br>Third, Pet Discipline:  This gives you the ability to issue the /pet hold command to your warder, which will prevent it from attacking unless you specifically tell it to.  So, you don't have to spam /pet back off to keep it under control.  This is a very nice raiding AA.<br><br><br>Some final things for a beastlord to do/know during a raid:<br><br>1.  Wait for the MA to call assist.  This applies to your pet as well; don't send your pet in until assist is called.<br><br>2.  Pet positioning:  If the mob needs to be pushed in a certain direction for whatever reason, set your pet up to help the push.  Also, it seems like a lot of people prefer to have their pets guard a certain spot.  I prefer to have him follow me, as it allows for easier repositioning during a fight.  When fighting a mob that enrages, either reposition your pet behind the mob, or back him off.<br><br>3.  Pet control:  Keep control of your pet.  The best way to do this is with the /pet hold AA.  If your pet is causing trouble and you can't control him, use /pet get lost.  It sucks to have to resummon and rebuff your pet, but its better than slowing down a raid or even causing it to wipe.<br><br>4.  Pet Procs:  Know what types of spells the mobs you are fighting are weak against, and choose the right proc to give your pet.<br><br>And of course, pay attention to whoever is leading the raid, so you know what needs to be done.  <br><br>I think that pretty much covers it.<br><br>Sairel<br clear=all><br><font size=-2>(Edited by SAIREL on 8/3/2003 at 3:12p.m.)</font><br></i><br></td></tr><tr><td>
