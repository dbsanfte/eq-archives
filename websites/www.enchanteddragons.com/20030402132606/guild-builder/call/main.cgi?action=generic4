<html><h3>Instructions on using this Website</h3><br><body><br>Hello and Welcome to the world of the Enchanted Dragons. Feel free to look through the site and look in on the tavern forum. If you want to join our ranks, you can go to the New Members Forum, by clicking on the forum button at the top of the page and then going to the one that reads "Want to join our ranks?" You can post a message there by clicking post at the top right of your screen. Our general rule is you have to have 5 votes with at least one from an officer for admission to the guild.<br><br>If you are currently a member and would like to enter your information into the site, you can do that by going to the main page and hitting the "Member Login" button. It will ask you for you name which should be your character name, what you would like your password to be, your e-mail address, and who recruited you. It will also ask you for a passkey. This is posted on the guildmotd and will not be placed here for security reasons. Remember this passkey is case sensitive meaning it needs to be capatilized in the right places. Once this is complete you will have to swear in. This announces to the guild that you have arrived in the Current Affairs Forum. You now have access to the website.<br><br>After you have signed in, you should continue on to edit your profile. You can do so by hitting the "Profile" button at the top of your page. It will ask you for your character's information including level, class, race, whether they are epiced or not and what skills they have mastered. Please only include skills in which they are over 200 in. Next it will ask you for a biography. You may include in this whatever you like but please keep it clean. Next, there is an hours of availability chart. This is in military time. Please enter the times you are generally available by clicking and dragging. Remember this is in EST so may have to convert for your timezone. Then please hit the save character data key. Please also make sure the box that says make me inactive is not checked. <br><br>You may also want to load a picture of yourself or your character. You can do this on the bottom of the profile page. You will see a Browse Button and an Upload Picture Button. Click on the Browse button and you will see that it brings up a screen to look in your computer. Direct it to where the picture is and hit the Upload Picture button. You may only post pictures that are 20kb or less. KB is how much space they take up on your hard drive. You can check this by right clicking on the file you want to upload before you upload it and selecting properties. You will see in the "Size" box how large the picture is. You can adjust this by making in smaller in a paint or photo editing program or by adjusting the quality which you can do in a photo editing program. This website will also only allow pictures that are in .jpg format. If your picture is not in this format you can open it in most photo editing programs and just resave it as a .jpg file.<br><br>Next, you should add you dot to the map. You can do this by clicking on map at the top of the page and clicking on where you live. <br><br>After that, you may want to browse and post messags in the forums. Click on Forums and select which forum you would like to view. You can then look at messages listed by clicking on them. You can look at replies that have already been posted by clicking on them, too. You can post new messages and replies to other people messages by clicking on the post button and entring in the message you would like to post then hitting post again at the botom of the page.	</td></tr>	</table>        </td>        <td><img src=http://www.enchanteddragons.com/files/misc_images/spacer.gif height=20 width=20></td></tr><tr><td colspan=3><img src=http://www.enchanteddragons.com/files/misc_images/spacer.gif height=20 width=20></td></tr></table></center></html>
