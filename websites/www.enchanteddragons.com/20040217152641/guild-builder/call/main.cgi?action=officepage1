We as a guild are here to help our members. Our goal is to become a strong but small raiding guild. Sometimes that means putting the guild above personal wants and desires. It is everyone's interest to see our guild get bigger and prosper. Each and every member is as important as the next. To accomplish this vision we need to work together and move into all levels as a guild. Members come together to work with each other as a team for a single indivudal can not even come close to accomplishing what a team can. We have to equip each and every one of our classes the best way we see fit. This is where Enchanted Dragons is headed. Want to be apart of the family? We want you as a part of our family.<br><br><br><b>Guild Rules</b><br><br>1.) Absolutly no member Bashing, Racist Remarks or Fighting in Guild Chat. Instant removal from guild.<br>2.) Enjoy the game and have fun.<br>3.) Use officers to help you with problems. Only take things directly to the Guild Leader after two or more officers fails to help solve the problem.<br> 4.) No Begging from other players, this includes guild members.<br>5.) Maintain proper content and RESPECT in all PUBLIC channels. <br>6.) No KSing -- KARMA will get you in the end ... <br>7.) If scheduled to appear to a raid, keep your word and show up or proxy.<br>8.) Raid loot distributed by need, not want. Main chars considered before twinks.<br>9.) We are a Dragon Faction guild, please do not attack the dorfs and dragons.<br>10.) On raids u will listin to raid leader if you dont you will be told once and second time you will be translocated out of raid.<br><br>Failure to abide by these rules will result in possible removal from the guild. <br><br><b>Raid Rules</b> <br><br>1. Everyone Must read the raid rules. I am tired of telling people time and time again to wait for assist or to get to the raid spot on time. If you plan on doing your own thing without listening to the Raid Leader, you will be translocated out of the raid to a safe place. <br><br>2. Loot is now on a merit system only and will be discussed by the officers on the raid in a private channel. Ways to be conisidered for raid loot are:<br><br>a. showing up to raids consistently will give best chance to get loot.<br>b. Loot is given out in a manner that will benfit the guild. Example: Show up for all raids. Dont expect to show up to only one raid every so often and expect to get loot. It will not happen.<br>c. Be on time for raids, sit down Put lfg on and keep the raid channel clear. Do not bother the raid leaders as they are working as fast as they can to get the raid underway. Dont ask for a group, group leaders will invite when told to. When groups are formed, raid leader will ask if people are groupless. At that time, you can speak up and get a group.<br>d. KEEP RAID CHANNEL CLEAR. I cant stress this enough.<br><br>3. We will have raids posted on the event calendar. Please do not add your own raids on the calendar. If you do, it will be removed.<br><br>4. Show up on time for raid. If you think you're going to be late go to the zone we are meeting up at and camp, or get there early.<br><br>5. ALWAYS LISTEN TO THE RAID LEADER.<br><br>6. Do not go afk. If we need to move we will move with you or without you.<br><br>7. Dont ask for the loot. Loot will either be merited or in cases randomed by classes. You may not get something at every raid, but if continue to come to raids you will get soemthing.at some point and the betterment of the guild. <br><br>8. ALWAYS USE ASSIST!! Main tank will call assist for melees and will also call assist for casters. If Casters nuke too fast, they will get agro and potentially turn our raid into a corpse run.<br><br>9. If you are told to do something more then twice third time is free port out of raid. Better hope there is a wizzy or someone willing to port you out because you will be degrouped and left behind.<br><br>10. Do not go wandering around the zone, we are not fighting greens. These mobs are very hard to beat with even the strongest groups. You pulling agro on the groups will get you into some trouble. This goes back to listening to the raid leader.<br><br>11. Go to EQ Atlas and make a copy of the map of the place we are raiding, this will help you big time in the long run and if no map avalable in eq atlas go to EQMaps<br><br>OK you all know me and I hate rules but these are to make raids morefun and let people know what we expect as a guild. I hate to have to enforce rules, but I will for the better of the guild.<br></p>	</td></tr>	</table>        </td>        <td><img src=http://www.enchanteddragons.com/files/misc_images/spacer.gif height=20 width=20></td></tr><tr><td colspan=3><img src=http://www.enchanteddragons.com/files/misc_images/spacer.gif height=20 width=20></td></tr></table></center></html>
