( i take kajukenbo, and we need to earn em some money for a Las Vegas kajukenbo tournament... basically, these two that are going are the best under 18's in our school...<br><br>anyhow, i paid 15 bucks for the entree fee .. wich goes toward the fund riaiser, to do this...<br><br>i woke up 5 mins after i was sposed to be there... no big worry though, my division is generally last and il haveplenty of time. ( little dragons go first, then all the wauy to teen ranks, ocassionally adults) <br><br>i get there with two divisions before mine.... and i end up siting for two hours befor.. oh look, um, heres another late person... hes not as good as you asriel, so we will move you up a division...<br><br>no problem there, i spar these people aaalll the time... cept ive been outa it for two months due to softball.. no problem there, im here to have fun, i know im already licked but ill fight anyway. im the 4th person in the division, two ranks below the lowest there ( 6 months training difference )<br><br>im fine with this, i always have fun ... only this time our school ( its a monthly in school tourny ) invited vancouver kajukenbo's school down... so we have two  people ive never seen before and know nothing about how they fight suddenly in the way..<br><br>but look, another pesron... whats this ? a white purple in the midst of blue ash ( me ) and brown sash? ( highest ranking teen there ) ... i asked him how long he trained after our names were written down.. oh, 6 years...<br><br>that sucked... i figured i had a chance since he was younger, and generally when they are only 13 and training for 6, the training isnt as disciplined, so i get into the ring with him, and the very first thing i do is sweep a nice roundhouse right infront of his nose... all he does is raise his eyebrows, say wow.. the crowds all like .. oooh ahh...<br><br>the judges didint call it.<br><br>im fine with that.. twoo of them arent from my school though, soill give it another shot.<br><br>lead hands right to his get...<br><br>the judges didint call it.<br><br>i got kicked in the side, accidentally tripped, they stopped, one judge didint see the kick, two saw it, one point to him...  alright, im warmed up ... next thing was a lead hand rolling backhand to the forehead ( we cant hit the face in sparring /shrug so we go for forehead. ) our judge calls stop ... <br><br>one hand goes to me, the other two didnt see it... no point to me... frik!<br><br>so it ends up being 3 3 when the time is called...<br><br>sudden death bla blah lbahdedyblah...<br><br>blitz! wee! ... i brought a cresent kick to the freaking side of his head... no stop, no call... ok, i tried another lead hand puch... beautifull! i got him square in the chest before he even knew what was happening.... no stopping ... he figures it out... taps me on the head with his hand, <br><br>OH OH!! STOP!! point to red ... you loose ariel...<br><br>WTF?<br><br>ok, im fine, was a nice fight, sudden deaths are always like that, and im just here for fun anyhow... bnot like it really matters as its a fund raiser..<br><br><br>my next fight just sucked terribly... first two hits were ( can you guess it? ) lead hand punched to the gut ... IE, thats one of the main things i do, because most people just arent quick enough to block mine .. or something, but either way, it works veery well ) ....<br><br>judges didint call either...<br><br>/sigh <br><br>alright, fine i decide ill try a kick...    errk, umm, no, she kicked same time i did, and got one to my ribs before i pegged her... wich i ididnt end up doing, i missed my mark, but oh well, its 0 to 1, her favor..<br><br>next two would be points are called as chlashes... those happen all the time, so i fake a kcik, and brin a backfist to her forehead ( once again we cant hit the face ) <br><br>omg!! the judge saw it! ... but wait... one saw a punch of here hit my frigging arm... wait.. two paw a punch .. and it hit my frikking arm!! .... your not gonna hurt my  by kicking my god damned arm!! ... they gave her a point... 0 to 2 .. i can still come back, so i decide to kick some.. kicked her arm... no good, kicked her head, her hand was there to block... double kick, wee! kicks didnt work, but once again my lead hand punch to the gut lands cleanly, the judge calls stop.. <br><br>both the away judges put their fists together ( that means they didnt see ) ... and my judge points to me...<br><br><br><br><br>no point there...<br><br><br><br><br><br>we start up again, i land ANOTHER hit to the gut with my lead hand... and time is called...<br><br><br>oh, sais the vancouver judge, were not calling lead hand punched to the gut...<br> <br>im like WTFH?? you coudla told me that BEFORE i started sparring!?!?<br><br>but of course, i never loose my temper ( seriously i only let out my ragwe in typing or writing, not through physical junk )<br><br>so im just like "oh, ok... thats cool"<br><br>...........................................................<br>today sucked.. i got last place... i got put in a division where i was standing arely a chance in the first place, got put against my seniors, and was homered, by the frekaing vancouver judges, who werent calling my main tech. as a point, and didnt feel like telling me till after the fight.<br><br>/sigh<br><br><br clear=all><br><font size=-2>(Edited by ZABE THE CONFUSED on 5/31/2003 at 6:14p.m.)</font><br></i><br></td></tr><tr><td>
