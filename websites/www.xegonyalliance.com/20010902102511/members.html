<p>Previously, Xegony Alliance attempted to list all of its participating members.  In the 
past year since we started up this web site, the membership has gotten far beyond our control.</p>

<p>We can no longer keep up with the e-mails flooding in from people asking to be added to 
the master list of XA participants.  Because of this, we are removing the membership list for 
the present while Eowen works on a newer approach.  Instead of e-mailing Eowen about wanting 
to be added to the list, she's creating an applet in which you'll be able to add yourself to 
the list.  You may possibly be able to remove yourself from it as well.  For more details on 
this, please talk to Eowen in our forums.</p>

<p>We don't have an estimated time of arrival on the applet.  Sorry about that, but better to 
say that than make lots of lofty promises about things.  Just keep your eyes peeled on the 
forums and hopefully Eowen's coding might shall prevail.  :)</p>
