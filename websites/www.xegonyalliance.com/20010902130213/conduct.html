<p>The following information covers general codes of conduct and ettiquette that are expected 
of people on XA raids.  They were decided upon within our forums over time as well as during 
our raids.  If you don't agree with these conduct outlines, please consider discussing your views in 
our forums where people can decide whether new additions or changes to these existing outlines can be 
made.  If the information you're looking for is not listed below, try looking in the rules section of 
this website.  If you can't find it there either, try asking in our forums.  If any of what you see 
below seems long winded or wordy, we're sorry.  Grin and bear it - you gotta get this stuff down before 
you come to a raid, both to save yourself dissapointment when something doesn't go your way and for the 
safety of the raid as a whole.

<P>XP
</FONT>

<p>Experience should <i>never</i> be an issue while on a raid.  Accept the fact that you 
will die, often, before the raid has started, and you won't be dissapointed.  In fact, 
expect to die something like 9 times trying to break fear (for example).  This doesn't mean 
it's going to happen, but expect it.  This isn't the Sol B king room were talkin' about 
breaking here, it's <i>much</i> larger and <i>much</i> more is at stake.

<p>Don't shout out stuff on raids like "this other group is getting all the kills".  This 
is just blatant whining.  Look, if you want XP, go somewhere else with 5 friends - you can 
get XP anywhere and anytime if you really want.  If you want to go on a raid, expect to 
die but expect things to get done at least, regardless of the consequences.

<p>Don't come on a plane raid after just getting level 46 unless you expect to find yourself 
losing it very quick.  Do yourself a favour, get a good 1-2 bubbles of buffer before coming 
seeing as you lose a lot of XP in 46, some of it maybe in situations where your corpse won't 
be able to be rezzed within the 2 hour limit.  If you die and lose 46, don't blame the raid.  
You know the risk, evaluate your options beforehand.

<P>CR and Responsibility To The Whole
</FONT>

<p>Look, corpse recovery is sometimes easy, but when it's hard, it's <i>hard</i>.  Corpse 
recovery from bad Plane of Fear breaks is a notoriously evil evil <i>evil</i> little task 
to accomplish.  This can be a really soul destroying process.  There's nothing quite like 
being on a fear break that's been going on for 10 hours, everybody dead, and no corpses 
recovered.  Not fun at all.

<p><i>When</i>, not <i>if</i> we all die, you are all in it for the long haul.  If we need 
to go buy coffins, have someone suicide-drag the corpses, have evac people spread 
throughout the groups, do resurrections, all this is expected of <i>all</i> of us.

<p>If you know you aren't going to have 4 hours to recover corpses when things go bad, don't 
come.  If you know you are going to say "screw it, this sucks" and leave after a few hours 
because things aren't going your way, don't come.  If you get your res and decide to leave 
when you could be helping the other 20 people that still need to be ressed, <i>don't come</i>.

<p>When ressing, 49th level clerical res should be a must.  Nobody should be made to suffer 
a lower res unless their 2 hour limit is running out.  If it takes the extra time to res in 
more clerics that can do a 49 res, so be it.

<P>Know Your Primary and Secondary Assists
</FONT>

<p>At the start of every raid, the raid leader will assign a Primary Assist.  This is a person who 
everybody should assist in fighting when MOBs run into the room.  This is so everybody can concentrate 
on one target and enchanters can mez excess targets.  The moment people stop assisting the primary, 
mezzed targets start getting hit, enchanters start dying, and raids go bad fast.  There will also be 
a Secondary Assist assigned.  This is who you assist if the primary goes down and they might just go 
down, seeing as primaries are chosen according to strength and their ability to tick MOBs off and 
take the major chunk of the damage.

<p>If you've never dealt with primary and secondary assists, now's the time.  When you hear who your 
primary and secondary assist is going to be, make a button for it.  This is just a simple social 
button that says "/assist colubridae" or whoever the primary is.  Then make one for the secondary 
and put 'em right out front on your hotkeys where you can see 'em.  The reason you want it as a button 
is that sometimes /assist doesn't work that well.  You want to be able to stab at it over and over 
to make sure it's giving you the right target.  A lot of people laugh /assist off, saying things like 
"oh sure sure, I'll figure out what everybody's on, don't worry about me".  Seriously, it's no joke.  
You won't be saying that when you break a mez and free up a few clerics of innoruuk, getting everybody 
killed.  Save yourself the embarassment and make the buttons now before things go bad later - you 
won't regret it.

<p>Even if you're a caster, assist is pretty essential.  Let's say you're an enchanter.  Your job is 
to mez what's <i>not</i> being assisted.  You need to know what's being attacked, and fast, so you can 
get to mezzing everything else.

<P>Never Loot Your Class MOBs
</FONT>

<p>It's considered extremely bad to loot a MOB that drops something specific to your class.  An 
example of this would be in Plane of Hate when a cleric loots the corpse of a Cleric of Innoruuk.  
It doesn't matter if you're in a group of people that can see what you've looted.  It doesn't matter 
if you're a nice person.  People just flat out get the creeps from watching people check the corpses 
of MOBs that drop their armor, it's led to ninja looting in the past and left a bad taste in people's 
mouths.  If your group has gotten the kill on a MOB and you're of the class that needs armor from 
those MOBs, ask somebody else in your group to check the corpse.

<FONT SIZE=+1>
<P>The Uninvited Guests
</FONT>

<p>We'd like to judge individuals here, not whole guilds.  If you have an issue with somebody 
on a raid (let's say Zibbi shows up and you don't like him) bring the matter up with the 
raid leaders.  If people agree overall that this person is a deterent to the raid in some 
way, they'll be asked to leave, but don't ask for somebody to be kicked out simply because 
they belong to a guild.  Not all members of guilds are bad, just as we're sure not all 
members of guilds may be good either.

<p>As a side note, nobody shall be excluded due to their geographical location.

<FONT SIZE=+1>
<P>TP and Travel Time
</FONT>

<p>Travel time is on <i>your</i> time not <i>raid</i> time.  Log out at or near the raid the 
night before or sometime before the raid get your buns close to us if you have to.  Sometimes 
real life or odd circumstances can't allow you to be there on time but if you come late you 
risk the consequences of not being able to get in the raid.  If you arrive late, the raid 
may be too far dug in for you to reach them and it won't be coming back to grab you, it'll 
be working to do what it was created to do.

<p>Raid times should be <i>starting</i> times.  If you want to lead a raid, make sure you create 
a time for raid formation and a time for getting the raid underway.  Don't show up at raid 
time, show up at raid <i>formation</i> time.  A lot of raids take too long to start and 
lose steam precisely because this basic rule of conduct isn't followed.

<FONT SIZE=+1>
<P>Does Size Matter?
</FONT>

<p>Sometimes you call for a raid and ten people show up.  Sometimes 70 show up.  Have you ever 
seen 70 people try to camp the SWC (SouthWest corner) of Hate? It's a mess.  When it comes to 
oversizing, we've got a couple of options.  In hate, we just split the groups into a SWC and 
NEC (NorthEast corner) group and both groups are in on lottos for the entire zone.  In cases 
like Fear, this isn't really possible.  Too many people split up in fear leads to trains, 
trains, and more trains.  There's always some place the extras could go.  We can always take 
some off the top and go do Kedge or something.  Too many people is a <i>good</i> thing.  It 
means our options are diverse and the interest in the alliance is high.

<P>Let The Pull Group Pull
</FONT>

Don't like the kind of pulls you're getting? Don't like the pace the pull group is taking? Tough.  
Either offer to do better to the raid leader with a convincing argument or sit down and shut up.  
It's the pull group's job to pull and your job to kill what they pull to you.  End of story.  If you 
start pulling separate MOBs, you risk two pulls coming in at the same time and killing everybody, so 
don't even think about it.

<FONT SIZE=+1>
<P>Who's The Leader Anyway?
</FONT>

<p>Xegony Alliance doesn't really have a "leader" per se.  Colubridae and Tempestade are 
generally thought of as the ones running the show but that doesn't make them responsible 
for every raid that happens.  They simply can't do everything.  For every raid, there is a 
leader.  When it's posted, make sure you know who it is so you can complain to them if you 
have an issue to be raised.

<p>Everyone who regularly attends Xegony Alliance raids and who has the desire to, is welcome to 
organize and lead raids.  We suggest that you try some smaller operations before trying Hate or Fear.  
Leading a raid is certainly a skill you have to develop and you will find yourself constantly learning.  
However, the more people that we have that are comfortable leading and willing to step up to the 
challenge, the better off we'll be as a whole.
