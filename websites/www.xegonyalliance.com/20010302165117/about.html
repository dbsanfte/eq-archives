<p>Xegony Alliance is not a guild.

<p>Xegony Alliance is a collection of people that are interested in getting together and raiding or 
even having an event or two.  It is made up of whoever wants to be in it.  Both guilded and unguilded 
players have participated.  It's primary purpose is to provide a place where players who don't get many 
opportunities to raid can finally take part in large scale operations.  There are lots of people out 
there who are part of small guilds that don't have the numbers of people it takes to carry out raids 
that take place in the high 40s and above.  It's our hope that Xegony Alliance provides a place where 
this never becomes a problem.

<p>There's no probationary period or anything, you just gotta read our message boards and sign 
up for a raid when it's posted using our calendar, then come on down, help out, and get yourself 
in a lotto.

<p>We also do not wish to exclude any people from large guilds who don't have these types of problems.  
If somebody from a large guild like Inner Circle, for example, wanted to come along on a XA raid, that 
would be great.

<p>The important thing is, let's have fun, provide each other with a support network to get these 
things done, and have a great time on Xegony.

<p>A current list of our members can be found along the menu on the left side of the screen.  If you
