<!--
	This is a sample JSP that uses the jCalendar bean to display a calendar of 
  events.  It allows navigation to other months and the ability to add events 
  to the calendar.  While the display of the calendar in this example is 
  similar to a "blotter" style calendar, it can easily be adapated to other 
  display formats.
	
	Knowledge of JSP and Java is (pretty much) necessary to understand this, 
  even with my liberal commenting :).  All of the Java native code is found 
  between the "less then/percent" and "percent/greater then" tags (had to spell 
  them out so the JSP engine doesn't freak out when it finds the Java 
  denotation tags in my comment :) ).

	<!--
		This let's the JSP engine know that we want to use the jCalendarBean object,
		to call it "calendarBean" on our page, and to set the current month and year
		from two parameters in the URL (named month and year).  This should
		automagically initialize our calendar bean to the appropriate state.
