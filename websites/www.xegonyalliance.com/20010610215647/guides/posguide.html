<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>Introduction</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Plane of Sky is easily one of the best zones in Everquest, certainly one of the most 
interesting.  It’s somewhat similar to the Temple of Solusek Ro in that a huge series of quests are available here. 
They are much harder than the temple Ro quests and they are all performed within the plane itself.  These quests 
involve returning a series of items from slain MOBs.  That’s not to say that MOBs only drop quest items, they don’t, 
they also drop some nice items to take home with you that aren’t necessarily linked to quests.</P>

<P>To enter the Plane of Sky, you'll need a Cloudy Stone of Veeshan and a wizard of level 46 or higher to port you 
there using a spell called "Alter Plane: Sky".  The stone is used by the wizard as a reagent in casting the portal 
spell and one stone is required to take a party of 1-6 players into the plane (including said wizard).  The stone is 
available in the Erudin library for approximately 220-250 platinum on the top floor of the library.</P>

<P>It is generally assumed that players bring at least 50 plat when being ported by a wizard to cover the costs of the 
reagent.  You will also need to be level 46 or higher in order to be ported into the zone.  If you die while you are in 
the zone and lose level 46, you will not be able to have a wizard port you in.  The only form of entrance back into the 
zone in this case will be via clerical resurrection.</P>

<P>When you first enter Plane of Sky, you are not aggro, unlike entering many of Norrath’s other planes.  You’ll find 
yourself standing on an island, all buffs wiped from your character.  This island is the first of many in the plane, 
each one visitable via teleport.  In general, clearing one island of MOBs provides the keys necessary to visit the 
next island in the chain using a locked teleport pad.  Each key takes a single person, NOT a group.  These keys are 
not soulbound and they are not no rent but they will disappear if you leave the plane.  For this reason, if you get a 
key, you can camp or go link dead and still have the key but the moment you leave the plane, they’re gone.  There are 
nine islands in total, as well as a small room inside the first island full of efreeti lords who give out the 
aforementioned quests.  These islands float in mid-air.  If you look down off the edge of an island, you’ll see sky 
below you.</P>

<P>To exit the plane, simply jump off an island and freefall until you eventually zone in mid-air.  You’ll end up falling 
out of the sky in East Freeport into the water some distance off the docks.  For this reason, you don't want to fall off 
an island while in battle.  Once you've zoned out, you'll need a wizard to port you back in, hence, another Cloudy Stone 
of Veeshan, and you'll most probably be the one paying for it.    Just as a side note to falling off islands: If you die 
while falling off an island (say to a DoT), your corpse will either lie at the bottom of the zone and be unrecoverable 
(in which case you’ll need a necro to Summon Corpse) or it may be teleported back to the first island for easier recovery 
by the AI.</P>

<P>Jumping off an island is the only form of exiting the plane.  Gating is not allowed in the Plane of Sky.  Many other 
spells are not allowed in this plane, including Call of Hero, Bind Affinity, Levitate, Dead Man Floating or any Memory 
Blur or portal spells.  The only exception to this is "Alter Plane: Sky" which can teleport people back to the first 
island minus whatever aggro they had before they teleported.  Again though, this would require another Cloudy Stone of 
Veeshan. Summon Corpse is allowed, thankfully, and Jade Inlaid Coffins used for summoning player corpses can easily be 
bought here from the Key Master on island one, who also charges the same outrageous costs as every other vendor in 
Norrath.  He does NOT sell the stackable coffins.  Some pets are unavailable or different in this plane.  Mages can only 
summon air pets, which look different (like female genies with an annoying laugh).  Necro pets are slightly less effective 
in this zone, and enchanter/shaman pets are the same as normal.  Enchanters are somewhat cut down here as well.  Mez works 
fine on the first and third islands but after that it starts to lose it’s effectiveness and color stuns have to be used 
with necros feeding mana.</P>

<P>It is generally never a good idea to either duel or cast area effect damage or stun spells in Plane of Sky.  On the 
first island, dueling will aggro the quest based efreeti’s underneath in the quest room who will begin death touching 
players and wiping out the raid very quickly.  Dueling on Gorgalask Island will cause passing MOBs to consider you free 
game and will begin attacking you immediately.  Area effect spells also have similar effects.  Even area spells with very 
small ranges like the enchanter line of color stuns will aggro things like the efreeti’s under Key Master Island. 
Another thing to take note of are weapons that proc area effect damage or stuns as these will be just as dangerous.  As 
a general rule, you never know what area effect spells or dueling will aggro, so try to avoid it if you're not one-hundred 
percent sure.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>Island One – Key Master Island (non-aggro)</B></FONT></P>

<P><IMG src="posimage.gif"></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>When you zone into the plane and find yourself standing on the first island, one of the 
first things you'll see is a MOB called the Thunder Spirit Princess as well as a dwarf NPC called the Key Master.  
We'll talk about them in a sec.  First, let's talk about the rest of the MOBs on the island.  The outer edge of the 
island is dotted with a circle of eight Thunder Spirits (level 50), placed far enough apart that they don't aggro 
each others when attacked.  Because they are so close to the edges of the island, you want to surround them with 
tanks when attacking so as to prevent them falling off the island or getting too close to the other spirits/princess.  
They hit for up to 160 DMG and proc Choke, a low level DoT.  After killing all eight Thunder Spirits, you should have 
a collection of 24 key pieces (Miniature Swords and Lost Rabbit's Feet), as each slain spirit yields three swords and 
three rabbit feet.  These can be collected by players and turned into the keys necessary for teleporting to the next 
two islands after killing the island "boss" (see below).</P>

<P>You'll also see the Key Master (level 53) when you zone in.  This is a little dwarven vendor who sells a selection 
of items including mana batteries, keys, and coffins for corpse recovery.  Before you think about doing something 
stupid like attacking him, don't.  If you attack him, he'll death touch you.  He's never been taken down and can't 
(he may be level 53 but he hits for 1800+) so don't get any zany ideas.  You also don't want to attack him because 
once he gets out of position, he won't respond to hails or sell items.  He'll start saying things like "I am too busy 
right now" and such.  If you do aggro him through other means, such as an area effect spell off a procing sword for 
example, he'll attack the person responsible for the attack, but not the party or everybody else in air, just the 
person who ticked him off.  The Key Master sells keys for the teleport pads.  These are the Key of Swords (510pp), 
Key of the Misplaced (255pp), and Veeshan's Key (1 copper).  He also sells unstackable Jade Inlaid Coffins for use as 
a reagent in the necro spell Summon Corpse, but not the stackable version.  Lastly, he sells a wide variety of Mana 
Batteries, as well as a Box of the Void.</P>

<P>There are three teleport pads on this island, used to take you further into the plane (stand on the pad, hold the 
appropriate key in your cursor, and click it on the pad).  The teleport pad in the west corner of the island requires 
a Key of Swords, which takes you to the second island.  The teleport pad in the east corner of the island requires a 
Key of the Misplaced, which takes you to the third island.  The teleport pad in the north corner of the island requires 
Veeshan's Key, which takes you to the quest room inside the first island.</P>

<P>Each island generally has a "boss" MOB of some sort. The "boss" MOBs generally drop uncommon/rare quest related 
pieces or other good items.  On this first island, it's the Thunder Spirit Princess (level 53), located in the center 
of the island.  As a general strategy, you want to leave the "boss" on each island until the end and clear the rest of 
the island first.  She will come to the aid of any Thunder Spirit being attacked so don't let the spirits you fight get 
close to her when you fight them. She hits in the mid 200s and also procs the same Choke DoT as the regular Thunder 
Spirits.  Because the middle of the island is somewhat depressed, pulling her to the outer edge of the island where 
you did the other spirits is a good idea, so as to reduce the risk of aggroing the quest efreetis under the island.  
This sometimes occurs when fighting her in the center of the island.  When the princess is slain, a MOB you'll come to 
know and love spawns in her place, a halfling called Sirran the Lunatic (level 63).</P>

<P>Sirran The Lunatic, like the Key Master, should never be attacked.  He hits for 2000+ and death touches so you'll 
pretty much be dead before you can say "mommy".  Once he spawns, he will despawn 45 minutes later.  Do NOT hail or say 
anything to Sirran or he will begin attacking you immediately.  Hey, he's a lunatic, what do you want? Each player 
approaches him, one by one, handing him their tiny daggers and rabbits feet from the slain Thunder Spirits.  In return, 
he will give you a Key of Swords (from Miniature Swords) or a Key of the Misplaced (from Lost Rabbits Foot).  Whether 
you hand in both pieces at once or one at a time doesn't matter.  It also doesn't matter if everybody does it at once.  
In this fashion, you can get the keys to islands 2 and 3 either by killing all the Thunder Spirits or buying the keys 
off the Key Master for an outrageous sum of money.  When you hand in your pieces, Sirran shouts out, "These are the 
keys! Use them well! Hold them in your hand and touch them to the runed platforms! Guide you they will! Hah! The last 
to go, must tell me so, or be in for a [hassle].  If there is a hassle I will go!" Now I've never followed Sirran's 
conversation, but I wouldn't be surprised if it ends in death.</P>

<P>Both the Thunder Spirits and the Thunder Spirit Princess are on an eight-hour spawn cycle so you can get at least 
24 keys for people every eight hours.  If 24 keys aren't enough for the people you brought up for your raid, you have 
three options.  Either they can buy keys off the Key Master, wait another eight hours and do another wave of Thunder 
Spirits, or die and be corpse summoned / ressed up to an island by a necro and cleric combo team (see appendix) who do 
have keys.</P>

<P>The importance of collecting key pieces cannot be stressed enough.  The first island is generally done very quickly 
so as to keep a good pace to the raid.  Because the spirit corpses rot in approximately six minutes, you can't let them 
rot while you're fighting another spirit.  Make a list beforehand of the people in the raid, listing necromancers with 
Summon Corpse first, then clerics (level 56+, then level 49+, etc.), enchanters (C2 capable first, then C1), all 
necros that can't Summon Corpse, druids, shamans, wizards, mages, pallys, shadowknights, rangers, monks, warriors, 
and finally rogues.  The reason for this seemingly bizarre pecking order is explained in the appendix under the 
paragraphs on corpse recovery after mass wipe-outs.  After each MOB goes down, somebody should start shouting out 
three names at the top of the list and keep going until everybody had looted a MOB.  If you can't keep up, confusion 
ensues about who's looted, who should loot, whether corpses have rotted, and this early in the raid that's not good.

<A NAME="03">

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>Island Two – Noble Island (non-aggro)</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>When you zone onto the second island, you’ll see three MOBs – the island is quite small in 
size.  Set amongst this island is a rather sinister looking windmill.  The first two MOBs are called Blade Storms (level 
59).  They hit for 360 DMG and are extremely magic resistant.  They also proc a spell that taps stamina, HP, AC, and 
resists.  On a rare occasion, they’ll drop something nice.  The whole real point of this island, however, is the third 
MOB, Noble Dojorn (level 63).</P>

<P>Noble Dojorn is a big nasty efreeti who is quite magic resistant. He carries a mace in one hand and a bag in the 
other.  Because the island is so small, some people pull the Blade Storms solo, kill those, then pull him into the 
windmill and fight him there to avoid falling off the island.  Pulling the Blade Storms solo is difficult though so be 
prepared to fight him and the blades at the same time.  He triple and quad hits for 350-400 DMG and casts a nasty area 
effect damage spell that is purely magic based.  For this reason, you’ll need a lot of tanks with magic resist gear 
when you fight him, as well as clerics.  He is guarded by the Blade Storms on this island.  A good attack force for 
the noble would include 8 tanks (2800-3500 HP each), 8 clerics (CH only), 8 necros (twitching the clerics), 5 mages, 5 
chanters, 2 druids, 5 bards, and 2 shamans with the mages having pre-made "mod rods" for all the casters.   When hailed, 
the noble welcomes you to the island, requesting that you stay, now that his relatives are gone.  Both Noble Dojorn and 
the Blade Storms are linked.  If you attack the Noble, you’ll aggro the Blade Storms, and visa-versa.  The Blade Storms 
circle the windmill in a repeatable pattern.  Killing the noble spawns another efreeti lord "boss" on the fifth island, 
the Overseer of Air (level 55), much like Sirran the Lunatic being spawned as a result of killing island bosses.</P>

<P>On a side note, this island is also home to part of the Monk epic quest.  There is a MOB called "a presence" (level 
55) that is invisible, like a shadowed man, except for it's name.  If it is handed the charred scale from Eejag in 
Lavastorm Mountains, it spawns Gwan (level 57) who must be attacked and killed as part of the Monk epic.  Aggroing him 
does not aggro Dojorn or the Blade Storms.  He can be fought beside other MOBs on the island, but any ae procs or ae 
procing weapons will of course aggro the rest of the island.  Gwan can be done approximately every two hours.</P>

<P>There are no teleport pads on this island and no MOBs drop keys to get off it.  In that sense, it's not entirely 
part of the chain of islands in this zone and those that come to Sky to do Gwan or Dojorn are here for a one way trip.  
The only option afterwards is jumping off the island.  The Blade Storms are on an 8-hour spawn cycle.  The Noble is on a 
7-day spawn cycle.</FONT></P>

<A NAME="04">

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>Island Three – Azarack Island (aggro)</B></FONT></P>

<P><IMG src="posimage2.gif"></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>There are nine wandering Azaracks (level 53) that fly around.  They look like imp 
protectors and are very aggro.  They hit for around 190 and proc Whirlbolt, a 400 DMG targeted DoT.  They also 
have a nasty attack that has a habit of tossing you a few feet into the air and making it difficult for you to look up 
or down, but still able to turn around (this could be an effect of Whirlbolt but I'm not sure).  They have fairly low HP 
but odd resists.  About half of the Azaracks have heavy cold resistances and the other half have heavy fire resistances. 
They drop Broken Mirrors, which are what are handed in for keys after the island is cleared.  The "boss" for the level 
is the Protector of Sky (level 55), another azarack, who hits in the 300s and procs Whirlbolt as well.  He is not on 
the island when you first get there, but rather is spawned after the death of the last wandering azarack on the island.  
He usually drops an uncommon/rare quest piece, four Broken Mirrors, as well as some other nice items.  His death, much 
like the death of the Thunder Spirit Princess on the first island, triggers the spawn of Sirran the Lunatic, who, upon 
giving him a Broken Mirror, will give you a key (the Key of Misfortune) that will enable access to the fourth island.  
He will also shout out, "You move fast, you crazy kids! Keep going! Prod you I will! Stuck here I have been! Oh! Let me 
know when you are [done] or this will be no fun! Haha!"  Like the first island, clearing a wave of azaracks will yield 
24 key pieces (four of those from the Protector of Sky).  Handing them in one at a time to Sirran will yield the key to 
island four, for which there is a teleport pad on the island.  The Protector of Sky only appears after the last of the 
azaracks are killed.  The Azaracks are on an 8-hour spawn cycle.</P>

<P>What makes this island difficult is that it's aggro.  When you first enter it, you will almost certainly be 
attacked.  You can, however, reduce the risk of this happening.  Shrink and invis everybody before going up.  This will 
lower your aggro considerably.  The imps fly overhead and the smaller you are, the less chance you stand of being 
whacked.  Barbarians, being the tallest, stand the greatest risk of aggro.  Once you come up, move along the left edge 
of the island to the back (walk along the left edge for about 10-15 seconds and you're at the back of the island).  You 
may get attacked along the way but hopefully not.  The back of the island is the best place to pull from because you'll 
get the fewest "adds".  On a good note, enchanters can actually do some crowd control here - mez can work but it's 
sometimes difficult without a tash beforehand.  Never let an imp go untanked though - if another imp comes (and it 
probably will), put a tank and a few clerics on it to keep it busy while everybody finishes off the rest.</P>

<P>Again, let me stress the importance of looting the corpses.  Because the imps aren't level 55+, their corpses are 
going to rot in six minutes.  Chances are, you're going to get rushed and have lots of dead people and dead corpses on 
the ground.  Don't let corpses rot in the confusion of battle.  People should loot during the fight so as to avoid 
letting them rot.  Quest items should be looted as well.  All quest items are lore, but not no drop.  They can be 
lottoed for after the fighting stops.</FONT></P>

<A NAME="05">

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>Island Four – Gorgalask Island (non-aggro)</B></FONT></P>

<P><IMG src="posimage3.jpg"></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>After having a nasty stint with the imps, it’s nice to be able to zone in to another 
island and not be jumped automatically.  For this reason, raids will sometimes camp here for the night and come back 
the next evening.  Most long term Plane of Sky raids take a few days to complete with camps outs every time in non-aggro 
spots.  For this reason, a Plane of Sky raid requires a high level of commitment.  The same people that are there the 
first night have to be there the second night and the third, etc.  Gorgalask Island is large, which is nice – you 
finally have some room to move.  A great place to set up camp and start pulling singles is the teleport pad although 
there is some small risk of aggroing the MOBs inside the temple, so be careful.</P>

<P>On this island there is a small temple with various MOBs moving around on the island and three named MOBs inside 
the temple.  There are five types of MOBs to be found roaming around.  We’ll go through them one by one, discussing 
their strengths, weaknesses and the overall strategy of taking these MOBs on.</P>

<P>The Gorgalasks (level 54-56) look just like the Gorgons from the Plane of Fear (a.k.a. Harpies with snaked tentacles 
coming out of their heads).  There are four of them on the island, flying around. They have high HP, AC, and resistances. 
They hit in the low 300s and proc a targeted stun.  Towards the end of the fight, they will become Enraged.  This turns 
all melee attacks back on their targets, so during this period, it’s time for casters to let loose with all they’ve got 
and tanks to back off a bit or they’ll get shredded by their own weapons.  Similar to the Gorgalasks are the Spirited 
Harpies (level 53).  They look similar in appearance but don’t have snaked tentacles coming out of their heads.  There 
are four of them on the island as well.  They have all the fighting characteristics of the Gorgalasks but they also have 
a Harm Touch that gets recharged every five minutes and have a low-level necro pet with them.</P>

<P>Watchful Guards (level 55-56) look like Evil Eyes.  They hit in the low 300s and have a low-level Enchanter pet. 
They cast standard enchanter DDs but also have area effect dispelling (4 buffs dispelled) and Gravity Flux.  There 
are five of them on the island.  Enchanters could probably get off a color stun on these but considering that you 
probably won't get it off every time, you might as well not bother, seeing as they'll eventually get a dispell through 
at some point.</P>

<P>Gusts of Wind (level 53) and Crystalline Clouds (level 53) look like air elementals.  They hit in the 200s and cast 
stun.  They can also be mezzed, which is a nice plus.  Like any good air elemental, they also have the ability to invis 
themselves.  There are five of these air elementals on the island, a mix of gusts and clouds.</P>

<P>Shimmering Meteors (level 55) sit atop the temple.  They look like will-o-wisps except they’re coloured red. 
There’s one on the top of each pointed tip of the temple roof – five in total.  They hit in the mid to low 300s 
and cast a Knockback spell.  For this reason, fight them facing the edge of the island so that if you get thrown, you 
move backwards across the island and not off the edge.  Another great way to fight these is inside the temple if you 
can.  They have high HP, AC, and resists.  These are generally fought after the elementals, evil eyes, and harpies 
have all been slain.</P>

<P>Once you’ve done away with all the inhabitants of this island, you can move in to finish off the "bosses".  There 
are three on this island, all located inside the temple.  Inside the temple to the left is the Avenging Gazer (level 
57-58), in the center is the Heart Harpie (level 58-59), and on the right is the Gorgalosk (level 61-62).  The Avenging 
Gazer is a large, nastier version of the Watchful Guards.  It hits in the high 300s and is an enchanter, casting the 
same spells as the Watchful Guards.  It has very high HP, AC, and resists.  The Heart Harpie is a large, nastier 
version of the Spirited Harpies.  The harpie hits in the high 300s, casting the same spells as Spirited Harpies.  It 
also has very high HP, AC, and resists.  The most important MOB however, is Gorgalosk.  Gorgalosk is a large, nastier 
version of the Gorgalasks.  It hits in the high 300s and has the same spellcasting abilities as the smaller Gorgalasks, 
also having very high HP, AC, and resists.  It will also become Enraged close to the end of the fight, much like with 
the other "bosses" in the plane.  It’s the only MOB on the island that responds to hails, which is fortunate.  That 
means you can pull the MOBs out, have somebody feign, and let the MOBs wander back while you keep the Gorgalosk around. 
The Gorgalosk also has triggers to continue chatting with it – don’t.  Follow that conversation with the Gorgalosk far 
enough and it will aggro on you.  There may also be a human MOB up in the temple called Gkzzallk.  He can be ignored, as 
he is part of the necromancer epic quest and is not killed as part of the epic.  If killed, he drops nothing.  If he's 
up, he'll be in the far right corner of the temple as you're looking into it, just right of the Heart Harpie.</P>

<P>Pulling MOBs from the temple can be difficult.  You can pull the Gorgalosk out, hail it, wait for the others to go 
back to the temple, and do the Gorgalosk away from the other MOBs but then you get Sirran The Lunatic.  The downside to 
that is, you have to do the rest of the island in the 45 minutes while Sirran is up and you risk aggroing him if you 
fight too close to him.  There are different ways of pulling the temple, all of them dangerous.  One of the most popular 
is to pull the MOBs out to the edge of the island, letting the puller die, then as the MOBs go back, take the last one 
to leave as your target.  This will probably entail a few feigning pullers and probably some deaths.</P>

<P>All of the MOBs, whether they be wanderers or temple "bosses" drop an Animal Figurine.  The figurine is handed into 
Sirran the Lunatic, who gives you the key to island five (the Key of Beasts) and shouts out, "Always want something for 
nothing? Oh yes, you gave me something! Here you go! Take this! Used one you have.  [Teleport] away you will! Let me 
know, or no kill! Haha!".  .  Sirran the Lunatic will spawn directly after the death of the Gorgalosk.  All MOBs here 
have a spawn time of eight hours, but the main "boss" MOBs might have a larger spawn time.</FONT></P>

<A NAME="06">

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>Island Five – Harvester Island (non-aggro)</B></FONT></P>

<P><IMG src="posimage4.jpg"></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>You’d think that after finishing off the fourth island, the natural progression would 
dictate you teleport up to the fifth island.  Not so fast.  The next island is full of flying horses and griffins that 
are not aggro but will assist each other.  There’s really no room to fight effectively on this island without all hell 
breaking loose.  It is <I>far</I> better to pull MOBs down to the fourth island after you’ve cleared it.  So how is 
that done without levitate you ask? A cleric goes up, aggros a MOB, casts Divine Aura and jumps off the island to the 
fourth below them.  In this fashion, the cleric is sure to live if they fall quickly enough to hit the ground while 
under the effects of DA.  Hitting the fourth island below them isn’t too hard either – it sounds worse than it is. 
This can also be done with Safe Fall, but it’s not nearly as reliable.  So let’s assume you’re on the fourth island 
pulling MOBs down from above you for the rest of this section.  This leaves you with eight hours to clear both island 
four and five basically before four starts respawning, which shouldn't be a problem at all.</P>

<P>There are 6 flying MOBs on the island, called either Soul Harvesters (level 52) or Essence Harvesters (level 52). 
This looks deceptively easy due to the lack of MOBs but it gets interesting, fast.  The Soul Carriers look like 
griffins and the Essence Harvesters resemble flying Pegasus-like horses.  They hit in the high 200s and cast stun. 
The griffins are susceptible to fire based attacks, where the "pegs" are vulnerable to magic based attacks.  You only 
want to pull one and here’s why….</P>

<P>When these MOBs are attacked and killed, they split into two smaller versions of the MOB you just killed – which 
are smaller in size, NOT in level.  The second generation of MOBs, known as Carriers instead of Harvesters, will both 
be level 54, but with higher HP, AC, and resists.  They’ll also hit harder and despawn after 80 minutes if left 
undisturbed.  It gets worse.  When a Carrier is killed, it spawns another offspring, who is tougher as well.  The 
offspring of a Carrier is a Tamer.  Essence Tamers and Soul Tamers are level 56.  Predictably, they have even higher 
HP, AC, and resists and hit even harder than the Carriers (in the 300s).  They too will despawn after 80 minutes if 
left alone.  Towards the end of fighting these, they will become Enraged so the tanks should be careful here.  All of 
these MOBs drop Bird Whistles, 24 in all, just like on the other islands, and their respawn time on the first 
generation version of the MOB is eight hours as well.  When the island "boss" is slain, these whistles are handed into 
Sirran the Lunatic for the key to island six.</P>

<P>There is one main "boss" to this island, known as the Keeper of Souls (level 58).  It is NOT non-aggro; it will 
attack you on sight.  It’s a large version of an Essence Harvester, the size of a dragon in fact.  It hits in the 
400s and casts stun as well as Death Touching.  It will Enrage towards the end of the fight and when dead, it will 
drop 4 bird whistles out of the 24 available on the island.  Killing it spawns Sirran the Lunatic.  The Keeper of 
Souls isn’t automatically on the island when you first get there – it is a triggered spawn.  Killing one of the 6 
Harvesters off the island will spawn an NPC called Ekim Nottap.  Ekim Nottap, in turn, despawns about an hour later, 
which, in turn, spawns the Keeper of Souls on the fifth island.  Once spawned, the Keeper of Souls will remain up for 
80 minutes before it despawns.</P>

<P>There is a second "boss" on this island, known as the Overseer of Air (level 63).  The overseer is not exactly 
native to this island.  He is a large efreeti lord that is spawned in front of the windmill on this island as a result 
of the death of Noble Dojorn.  He will stay there for days after Dojorn is killed and does not have Blade Storms 
protecting him.  Like Dojorn, he is not aggro.  He does NOT have to be killed in order to progress to the sixth 
island, but if you intend to clear sky completely, you must.  His death triggers the spawn of the Hand of Veeshan, 
the "boss" of island nine and the last MOB in the plane.  He hits in the 700s and casts an area effect DD, a targeted 
DD, and Death Touches.  He also dual wields daggers, which need to be disarmed at the beginning of the fight or he'll 
be able to quad attack. He has extremely high HP, AC, and resists.   His death triggers the spawn of the Hand of Veeshan 
on the ninth island, the third and final efreeti of the plane.</FONT></P>

<A NAME="07">

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>Island Six – Spiroc Island (aggro)</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Be careful when you enter spiroc island.  You’re not going to get jumped when you zone 
in but nobody should move when they get in until everybody has zoned in, looked around, and gotten their bearings.  
If you move too far, you’ll aggro a wandering spiroc.  A spiroc is a larger version of the multi-coloured, parrot-like 
aviaks in Ocean of Tears.  There are several types of spirocs on this island.  Of the 11 spirocs on this island, there 
are primarily three groups of spirocs.  Each of these groups has a leader called a Spiroc Vanquisher (level 58) meaning 
there are three on the whole island.  These must be killed before anything else on the island or other spirocs that you 
kill will start respawning back from the dead.  Eliminate the Vanquishers and you eliminate that threat.</P>

<P>You want to set up camp right at the zone in.  It’s a tight fit but necessary.  The first pull is going to suck 
hard.  You’re going to get two of the spiroc groups (6 MOBs in all, 2 vanquishers), but all three groups is more 
common (9 MOBs, 3 vanquishers) due to their very large aggro range.  The good news is the spirocs can be mezzed.  The 
bad news is the Vanquishers cannot be mezzed.  Enchanters will be busy indeed.  With the Vanquishers dead, you can move 
on to the remaining spirocs.  These 4-6 birds will be any one of several types of spiroc.  Spiroc Banishers, Walkers, 
Revolters, Explusers, Callers, and Arbiters (all level 51-52) make up the possible remainder of the spiroc groups.  
They hit in the 200s, cast Blind, Root, and an unresistable area effect DD called Lightning.  The spirocs travel in 
pairs.  The first pair is the Arbiter and Banisher (with Vanquisher in tow), Caller and Walker (also with Vanquisher), 
and lastly, the Expulser and Revolter (again, with Vanquisher).  Spirroc Vanquishers (level 58) are tougher than their 
two followers.  They fight with far more haste to their attack than the regular spirocs and they will become enraged 
toward the end of the fight.  Once you’re finished with the 3 groups of spirocs, it’s time to take on the "bosses".</P>

<P>The Spiroc Guardian (level 60) is a larger version of the other spirocs and casts similar spells.  He hits for 
around 250 and becomes enraged towards the end of the fight as well.  The Spiroc Lord (level 63) is the main "boss" of 
the island, however.  He’s a nasty little aviak that hits in the high 300s, Death Touches, casts a stun much like the 
long stun off a Stone Spider in Solusek B, casts Blind, and has an unresistable area effect DD – very nasty.</P>

<P>All of the different spirocs drop Noise Makers, 24 in all.  These are turned in to Sirran the Lunatic for keys to 
the seventh island.  Sirran will, of course, spawn after The Spiroc Lord dies.</FONT></P>

<A NAME="08">

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>Island Seven – Bzzazzt Island (aggro)</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>There are only three MOBs on the seventh island.  As usual, it sounds deceptively easy 
but it’s actually incredibly hard.  The zone in process is pretty easy.  The MOBs here don’t see invis, even though 
they have a huge aggro range.  Once you zone in, look for a big gear embedded in the ground, go over to it and behind 
it.  This is where you’ll handle the island from as you attack it’s MOBs, three deceptively easy looking bees. The 
Bzzazzt (level 50) look like wasps from Greater Faydark.  They hit for 390 and cast Deadly Poison (a targeted 1200 
DMG DoT).  They aren’t very magic resistant at all, thankfully, which means they can be mezzed. Each of the Bzzazzt 
drop 8 Dull Dragon Scales, which are used to create keys for island eight with Sirran later on.  Again, a total of 24 
will drop over the course of clearing the island.  The bzzazzt, much like the harvesters on island five, will split 
into offspring when killed.  Their offspring are NOT mezzable and ARE magic resistant, except for perhaps Lure spells. 
All the offspring and beyond will become enraged towards the end of the battle as well which is pretty harsh considering 
the offspring hit in the 500s.  The second generation of offspring is the Bazzzazzts (level 55) and the third generation 
is the Bizazzt (level 57), who hit in the 700s.  The offspring don’t have a larger aggro range, so corpse recovery isn’t 
out of the question if you get wiped out BUT the offspring will despawn in 80 minutes, so you’ll have to be quick.  This 
80-minute timer also applies to the final "boss" of the island.</P>

<P>Now there is a specific pattern to pulling and clearing this island and we’ll refer to the MOBs from the perspective 
of behind the gear and looking at them.  The left Bzzazzt will need to be taken out first.  When it is pulled the other 
two will need to be mezzed immediately.  The left Bzzazzt splits the same way as MOBs on island five (1 into 2 into 2, 
for a total of 5 MOBs).  The next target will be the right Bzzazzt. This one splits 1 into 3 into 3 for a total of 7 
MOBs so you’re looking at a tough fight indeed.  In fact, you’re probably going to have to camp out a cleric at the 
"safe spot" behind the gear and res people in and finish off the rest of the 7 MOBs in a second wave. The center spawn 
is somewhat simpler.  The Bzzazzt spawns another Bazzzazzt, which spawns the island "boss", Bazzt Zzzt (level 63), a 
huge bixie.  She looks cute, but get ready for pain.  She hits for 850, Death Touches, has an area effect disease spell 
(it covers the whole island).  If you survive all that, Sirran the Lunatic spawns.  Hand him your Dull Dragon Scales 
and get a key for island eight.</P>

<P>Before moving on to island eight, there is some unfinished business with Sirran the Lunatic to take care of.  He 
prompts you to tell him something, a phrase. The correct phrase to say is "?llaw eht htiw eno I ma" ("Am I One With 
The Wall?" spelled backwards).  This sounds bizarre, but it makes sense if you’ve been following the things he talks 
about over the course of clearing the plane.  Saying this to Sirran will spawn the Sister of the Spire on island eight. 
She is the "boss" of that island.</FONT></P>

<A NAME="09">

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>Island Eight – Drake Island (non-aggro)</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This island contains a series of drake and sphinx MOBs.  The island is completely non-aggro 
except for the Sister of the Spire.  There is a large temple on this island with the Sister inside it.  Killing the 
Sister will spawn the final Sirran who will provide you with keys for the final island.  You can also pull the Eye or 
Hand of Veeshan down to island eight, but that’s pretty tough.</P>

<P>There are five Fatestealer Drakes (level 58) on this island.  They’re the green ones.  They have to be pulled first 
before the other drakes.  They hit in the low 400s, proc a Whirlbolt-like spell (Levitate, Whirl-till-you-Hurl, possible 
DD or DoT) and cast Wizard spells.  They have much higher HP, AC, and resistances than the black drakes, including 
resistance to Lure.  There are also five wandering Heartsbane Drakes (level 56) – the black ones and the weakest ones. 
They hit for high 400s, proc a spell similar to Whirlbolt (Levitate, Whirl-till-you-Hurl, possible DD or DoT), and cast 
Wizard spells.  They have very low HP and resistances.  The Windrider Drakes (level 60) are the blue ones.  There’s five 
of them as well and they’re easily the most powerful of the three types of drakes.  They have to be pulled last due to 
their roaming paths around the temple – some are bugged and next to un-pullable.  They hit in the high 500s, proc a 
spell similar to Whirlbolt and cast Wizard spells.  They have very high HP and AC.  It’s also been said that they’re 
not very magic resistant, but you have to stand very close to make the spell attacks land properly.  All drakes drop a 
Replica of the Wurm Queen, which is your item to hand to Sirran for a key to island nine.</P>

<P>There are seven sphinxes on this island.  Greater Sphinxes (level 54) are assembled in pairs around the temple.  
They hit in the high 300s, Death Touch, and cast Enchanter spells.  They have an extremely small aggro range, which is 
a real blessing because they won’t aggro the other sphinxes when you pull one.  Like the drakes, each Sphinx drops a 
Replica of the Wurm Queen.  The other form of sphinxes are Great Sphinxes which are pretty much the same, except one 
level higher.  Undine Spirits (level 53) are cleric based wisp creatures that are easy to mez.  They’re found inside 
the ceiling of the temple, above the Sister’s spawn point.  There are eight of them in all.  Generally speaking, both 
the sphinxes and spirits drop the mage epic piece than many come to this island for, but it probably drops off the 
sphinxes more than the spirits.</P>

<P>Finally, there is the Sister of the Spire (level 63) in the temple itself, if you’ve spawned it on the previous 
island.  She looks like the magician pets in sky and although she <I>is</I> technically aggro, her aggro range is very 
small.  She hits in the 200s, casts an area stun spell, and Death Touches.  She has very high HP, AC, and Resists.  Like 
most "boss" MOBs here, she’ll become enraged near the end of the fight.  Apparently, she’s an easier fight than the bixie 
"boss" on island eight and as an added bonus, she doesn’t see through invis.  Her death spawns Sirran the Lunatic, who 
gives you Veeshan’s Key (the key to the last island) when you turn in the Replicas mentioned above.  It looks and sounds 
the same as the key from the first island to get to the efreeti room.  Who knows, maybe it even <I>is</I> the same key, 
but that’s doubtful.</P>

<P>There are two teleporters on this island, one around the back of the temple to the left, and one in front of the 
temple.  If you get too close to the teleporter near the ninth island, you’ll aggro the Hand of Veeshan, who in turn 
will aggro the Eye of Veeshan (both MOBs on the ninth island) and you’ll be Death Touched from afar, so be prepared.  
I’m not sure which teleporter goes where, this is all second hand information at this point – sorry guys.</FONT></P>

<A NAME="10">

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>Island Nine – Butterfly Island (aggro)</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>So here it is, the final island.  The Eye of Veeshan (level 63) looks like a cute 
butterfly.  She is the only MOB native to this island so that makes her an automatic "boss".  She hits for around 170, 
procs an efreeti DD on almost every hit and also Death Touches.  If you’ve done the pixie "boss" from island seven, 
you can probably do the Eye of Veeshan.  The secret is apparently to rune the heck out of everybody to fight off the 
threat of lifetap, which she also procs.  It’s a similar fight to Venril Sathir but with death touches.  The fight 
overall is easier than doing Venril Sathir though because the melee damage from the eye is quite light.  If you’re 
pulling it from below, the person who pulls is going to eat the Death Touch and somebody will pull it the rest of 
the way.  You must pull it down to the island and have it level with you on the z-axis or none of the tanks are going 
to be able to hit it.</P>

<P>The only other MOB on this island is the Hand of Veeshan (level 63), who is the hardest MOB in the plane.  It’s a 
triggered spawn, brought about by the death of the Overseer of Air and the final line in the series of three Efreeti 
lords in this zone.  Suffice it to say that the damage this puppy deals out is staggering.  Were talking around 1000 
DMG, or so I’ve heard – extremely nasty indeed.  Wish I could tell you more than that but I honestly don’t know anybody 
that’s engaged it or beaten it yet.  Maybe nobody has, I’m not sure.</FONT></P>

<A NAME="11">

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>Appendix</B></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P><B>Have a Goal!</B></P>

<P>When going to the Plane of Sky, one should go with a goal in mind.  Most people don’t go with the express purpose 
of seeing how high they can get, it’s usually to complete pieces for people’s epic quests.  The mage epic is probably 
the hardest, seeing as it involves getting to the eighth island.  Mages also have some epic quest related MOBs in the 
efreeti quest room.  Monks have epic MOBs on island two, and necros have epic MOBs on island four.  Also, warriors need 
blades from The Spirroc Lord for their epic.  Because of this, often the purpose of going to sky is to farm epic pieces 
from a particular island.  Often, MOBs like Noble Dojorn are completely skipped, because they don’t really have to be 
done.</P>

<P>A raid to farm blades off The Spirroc Lord might see people getting as far as possible and then camping in a non-aggro 
spot so they can come back fresh the next day and farm The Spirroc Lord using a popular, yet questionable tactic 
mentioned above.  A raid to the eight island for mage pieces could take several days.  Be sure of what your goal is 
though before the raid is planned.  Otherwise, everybody’s going to start bitching at each other about what to do, 
where to go, etc. once they’re inside the plane, and that’s no good at all.</P>

<P><B>Where Are The Maps?</B></P>

<P>There are some maps out there for sky. Almost all of them are excruciatingly bad. They don’t give an accurate 
picture of the way the islands are set up. The best way to do it is just jump in and experience it for yourself. Best 
place to look for sky maps is probably at <A HREF="http://www.eqmaps.com/">http://www.eqmaps.com</A>.</P>

<P><B>What About All The Quests?</B></P>

<P>There are so many quests in sky that it’s simply mind-boggling. Trying to remember them all or what pieces are for 
what quests is almost impossible. Almost all items dropped in sky have to do with quests. Don’t let confusion rule 
and items rot! Be prepared and bring a chart listing what items go with what class/quest. If you have Microsoft Excel, 
there’s a great spreadsheet that careful outlines what is what. This is pretty much required reading for sky and 
whoever is in charge of lottos.  You can find it at <a href="http://www.graffe.com/quests/plane_of_sky/Air_Quest_Items.xls">http://www.graffe.com/quests/plane_of_sky/Air_Quest_Items.xls</a>.</P>

<P><B>What About All The Quests?</B></P>

<P><B>What If We All Get Wiped Out Up There?</B></P>

<P>This is where things get interesting.  There are two instances where you're really screwed.  Either you fall off an 
island and out of the zone or you all get wiped out on an island.  Take a word of advice.  Keep a cleric and necro (with 
Summon Corpse) camped on the first island and a cleric and necro (with Summon Corpse) on whatever current island you're 
on.  Let's say you get wiped out on island four (non-aggro).  The cleric logs in, resses everybody, and you're back in 
business.  That's the easy recovery, but let's talk about the harder instances.</P>

<P>Let's say you all get wiped out on the Azarack Island.  Try to get an invisible necro and cleric camped on the island 
before you get wiped.  That way, the pair can log in, res a body while wanderers are away, invite them to the party, then 
be invised by the necro.  Keep rinsing and repeating until you have enough people that the necro and cleric can camp out 
and let the others take over with that process.  On the case of something like Bzzazzt Island, you don't have this 
luxury.  In a worst case scenario like this, you need to have everybody bite the bullet, buy new stones, zone up again 
like they did at the start, with enough money for coffins.  They buy coffins from the Key Master, necros summon all the 
corpses down, then res 'em, then you all start climbing back up again.</P>

<P>If you fall off an island, this process is more complex.  A party must be formed in the raid, consisting of one necro 
and one wizard (not KoS in Erudin preferred), and space for the fallen party member (the wizard must be the party leader 
so he can invite).  The player who fell off the island buys a stone for the trip back and the wizard invites them to the 
party.  The wizard ports them back into Plane of Sky.  Log in a camped cleric on the first island.  Have the wizard and 
the player who fell off the island duel each other.  The one who dies gets immediately Revived by the cleric on island 
one.  Immediately after, the necro high above with the rest of the raid, summons their corpse.  Finally, another cleric 
high above with the rest of the raid revives the player again using the summoned corpse and voila, they're back on the 
island.  The cleric on the first island then meds up, duels the remaining party member, kills them, Revives them, and the 
Wizard is Summoned/Revived by the necro/cleric combo up with the rest of the raid.  The cleric on island one can then 
camp and the rescue party can be dismantled so people can join their original parties.</P>

<P>A word of caution though here - you must be quick.  If you don't revive/summon/revive quickly, you won't be able to 
revive the second time.  The ability to revive is very short, only about three minutes.  If the necro or clerics go 
linkdead in this relatively short time, it throws a serious wrench into the works.  This also means that nobody should 
be killed unless the necro and both clerics are sure to have enough mana to do their work as soon as the player dies.</P>

<P><B>What If We Don't Get Enough Keys To Take Everybody Up To The Next Island?</B></P>

<P>This process is similar to the above discussion about falling off islands.  This is the prime reasoning behind giving 
key pieces to necros with the summoning ability and clerics.  They can at least go up and bring up the ones who don't 
have keys using this method.</P>

<P>Before going up to the next island, have a necro (with key) group with the players who don't have keys.  Then have the 
necro and a cleric (also with key) go up to the next island.  Have a keyless member die to a duel, get revived a cleric 
down below, summoned by the necro above, and revived again by the cleric above with the necro.  Rinse and repeat until 
those keyless members are up.  This means you can do five keyless members for each necro with a key.  Any more keyless 
members than that and you should probably wait for respawns for more key pieces.</P>

<P>Again, a word of caution here - you must be quick.  If you don't revive/summon/revive quickly, you won't be able to 
revive the second time.  The ability to revive is very short, only about three minutes.  If the necro or clerics go 
linkdead in this relatively short time, it'll mess things right up.  This also means that nobody should be killed 
unless the necro and both clerics are sure to have enough mana to do their work as soon as the player dies.</P>

<P><B>What About Faction Issues?</B></P>

<P>Nothing killed in Plane of Sky results in a loss of any faction.  You can come back repeatedly and everything that 
was non-aggro before will still be non-aggro.  Some MOBs connected to epic quests give out faction losses, but these 
are usually faction losses specific to that epic and are not harmful for others to partake in.</P>

<P><B>Can Two Raids Co-Exist In Plane of Sky At Once?</B></P>

<P>It's not too much of a problem but there is one issue that might become a problem and that's Sirran.  Let's say a 
party of people up on island five spawn Sirran The Lunatic.  Sirran must stay there for 45 minutes before depopping.  
That means that if a new raid comes into the zone and kills the Thunder Spirit Princess, Sirran will not pop while the 
other Sirran is up on island five.  The party of raiders on island one is effectively screwed as a result.  Working out 
who's getting Sirran when should be an issue and it can totally ruin a raid high above that's been going for days.
