<p>The following information covers the rules to be followed during a XA raid.  These are 
strict rules that must be followed to the letter but they are generally considered quite fair 
and commonplace for raids.  They were decided upon within our forums over time as well as during 
our raids.  If you don't agree with these rules, please consider discussing your views in our forums 
where people can decide whether new additions or changes can be made.  If the information you're 
looking for is not listed below, try looking in the conduct section of this website.  If you can't 
find it there either, try asking in our forums.  If any of what you see below seems long winded or 
wordy, we're sorry.  Grin and bear it - you gotta get this stuff down before you come to a raid, both 
to save yourself dissapointment when something doesn't go your way and for the safety of the raid as 
a whole.

<FONT SIZE=+1>
<P>Rule #1: If an item drops for a class (or classes), it will be lotto'd off to the members 
of that class (or classes) that <i>require</i> that item or can <i>use</i> that item.  The 
only exception to this is if one of the people who can use the item opts to count themselves 
out of the lotto by choice.
</FONT>

<p>By "require", we mean people that do not already have this item and will actually equip or use the 
item, or need the item to fulfill a quest.  We are not interested in people getting items so that 
they can be immediately traded or placed in bank vaults to rot unused.

<p>There is always going to be some debate as to whether all classes that can <i>physically</i> 
use the item should be allowed to.  For example, just because a Tranix crown drops on a fire giant  
raid, does that mean everybody should be allowed on the lotto when an enchanter could possibly 
put it to the best use? To be fair, we are going to say that people who can use an item (judging by 
the description on the item itself) <i>can</i> be entered into a lotto <i>if</i> they are going to 
use it.  <i>However</i>, we would like to <i>heavily</i> stress that if you know this is an item 
that you're not really going to use and that a particular class is very excited about getting in on, 
please reconsider whether you really want to get in on the lotto or not.  Use some common sense about 
how people are going to perceive your actions.  If you're a wizard and a sword drops that's great for 
rangers and druids but happens to be ALL/ALL, do you really want to enter that lotto just because 
you <i>can</i>?  Be considerate of others and use good judgement.

<p>It should go without saying that people seen abusing this rule will <i>not</i> be invited on 
future Xegony Alliance raids, the determination of which to be made by individual raid leaders.  This 
will include people who are seen auctioning recently won items from the raid or raids won during the 
recent past.

<p>If a different rule is going to be used by the raid leader, it should be stated beforehand when 
they announce their raid proposal in the forums.  People are going to expect the "need before greed" 
rule so if you're leading a raid and you're not going to use it, make sure you state that clearly 
beforehand so people can decide whether they're cool with this and want to come on the raid.

<p>All cash items (jeweled necklaces, opal bracelets, etc. - basically things that sell for a lot but 
can't be used for any other purpose such as jewelcraft) go to the clerics.  Ever play a cleric and 
have to pay 11 plat per stone every time you use one to cast Symbol of Naltron on people? That's a 
lot of money.  Very often, giving all the gems found to clerics still doesn't cover their cost of 
casting Naltron for the day.  If anybody has a problem with this rule, that's just tough, quite frankly.

<FONT SIZE=+1>
<P>Rule #2: One Item Per Person (With Some Exceptions/Exclusions)
</FONT>

<p>If you win an item, you are out of all lottos for the remainder of the raid.  If something else 
drops later in the raid and you would prefer to have it more than the item you won, you may enter the 
lotto for the second item <i>only if</i> you can lotto off the first item you won to the rest of the 
raiders.  If the first item that you won is a no drop item, it cannot be traded out of your inventory 
and is therefore not something that can be re-lotto'd.  In situations like this, the exception does 
not apply.

<p>Other exceptions to this rule are zone/cash lottos, quest/epic drops, and spells.  Spells drop in 
lots of places, not just off dragons.  They're also tradable and worth far less than dragon loot.  In 
the case of epic quest drops, this should be decided upon amongst the class that uses that item in an 
epic quest.  If four enchanters are in a zone, for example, and a piece of an enchanter epic quest 
drops, not all the enchanters may want it.  They can discuss amongst themselves who could best use 
the item.  In a case where more than one could, a lotto will take place for the item, run by the lotto 
captain for the raid.

<p>Some may argue that with the case of plane armor, you can't trade back armor (say a bracer) that you 
might not want if something better drops (say a breastplate).  This is your problem and yours alone.  
If a bracer drops and you want to exclude yourself from the lotto because you might want to get in on a 
possible BP drop later in the day, so be it.  The choice and suppositions are yours to make.  If you 
win a bracer and a breastplate drops later, sorry, but that's the luck of the draw.

<p>In the case of certains items dropping that are considered to be common, exceptions may be made.  
For example, for awhile Fluxbladed Axes (ranger only, no drop) were quite common on fear raids.  Many 
people weren't counting them towards being taken out of ranger armor lottos.  If an item drops that 
all the members of a class feel is so common that they wouldn't want to roll on it for fear of risking 
lotto placement towards armor drops, it will not be counted towards armor drops and will be rolled on 
equally between those that need it.

<p>After some discussion, it was also decided that dragon/god drops (that includes Dracoliche and 
Maestro as well, for example) be considered separate from all the other lottos.  Just because you won 
armor or a rare mace doesn't mean the losers of the lottos get to lotto on something better that drops 
off a god or dragon.  This is everybody's priveledge and it's a rarity to get in on these lottos, so 
everybody is included, regardless of what you've gotten so far in the day.  However, let's say you're 
a player who's the only one of your class in the zone and five pieces of armor have dropped for your 
class and because you were the only one of your class, you got them all by default.  That's great for 
you, but how is it going to make others feel when you enter a god lotto? The god lottos are open but 
if you've been winning things left right and center, try and show a little restraint when it comes to 
the big draw.  People might see you as greedy as a result - whether you want to cross that line of 
perception with people is your own choice to make.

<P>Rule #3: Follow Your Leaders
</FONT>

<p>A leader is chosen before every raid, as well as a lotto captain in charge of rolls.  The leader is 
exclusively in command of all decisions on whether to charge, move, pull, etc. unless they delegate 
matters (such as pulling) to other people.  If somebody starts yelling for people to attack, charge, 
etc., they should be ignored in all cases if they are not the leader of the raid.  People have to 
follow one line of thought and move as a cohesive group.  If they don't, chaos ensues and people start 
dying.  If somebody is trying to take people in a different direction, the raid leader may respectfully 
tell that person to STFU.  It is their raid to run.  Don't take it upon yourself to call somebody out 
on a raid if you're having a problem with them.  Raise the issue with the raid leader and they will 
deal with the matter.

<p>The same goes for loot.  Maybe you've been on a few raids where the classes on the raid handled 
their own lottos.  Not here.  One person handles the lottos for all drops, including zone/cash lottos 
right through to class specific no drop armor.  For example, if you decide to take it upon yourself to 
run all druid lottos and you're not the loot captain, you'll be asked to leave the raid.

<p>Esmos said it best in one of our forums when he wrote the following:

<p>"Oh, and one more thing, listen to the Leader, the Leader is your god, the Leader you will obey 
and as a worshiper of the leader you will follow him/her into the deepest peril and follow him/her 
closely.  Insubordination is not acceptable."

<FONT SIZE=+1>
<P>Rule #4: What Channels To Use
</FONT>

<p>Shout is for raid leaders, loot captains, and extreme emergencies only.  If you don't fall into this 
category, don't use this channel.  People need to see announcements of lottos, rolls, etc. and having 
this channel remain as uncluttered as possible is the best way to achieve this.

<p>Ooc is for talking, both to raid leaders and out in the open.

<p>Auction is for auctions.  However, if a raid gets split between two groups, one group will take 
the auction channel and one will take the ooc channel.  If another raid is in progress in the same 
zone (eg. hate), take one channel and the other raid you're not a part of can have the other channel. 
This allows you to turn off the chatter of another raid in the zone, which is always nice.

<FONT SIZE=+1>
<P>Rule #5: Last Item Rule, If Agreed Upon Unanimously Beforehand
</FONT>

<p>Ever feel like because you've been on 487 raids to hate and still haven't gotten a breastplate that 
you deserve it more than somebody else who has only been there once? Tough.

<p>Seriously though, there could be an exception to this rule, generally known as "last item rule".  
If a player only needs one last piece of plane armor and they're the only one of that class in the zone 
that only needs that one last piece, they may ask the lotto captain to put out a vote to the rest of 
the zone whether the "last item rule" can be applied in their case.  Last item rule means that if a 
person needs one item to complete their set and it drops, they get it automatically without a lotto 
taking place, as a courtesy.  The lotto captain must then put out a call for a vote using the shout 
channel concerning the player in question and their request for the last item rule.

<p>Players of that class must then send a tell to the lotto captain saying whether they agree to this 
rule or not.  This is done to keep their votes anonymous.  If the result if unanimous to allow the last 
item rule, it will take place.  Otherwise, it will not.  The result of the vote is announced in the 
shout channel.  At no time is this player informed of who placed what vote.  They accept the vote as 
unanimous or not, with no other information.

<P>Rule #6: Two Hour Rule, In Long Term Raids
</FONT>

<p>Sometimes, you just can't get to a raid in time.  We all know you should come to a raid at a certain 
time, but sometimes you just can't.  If you can get to a raid mid-way through, you're welcome to, but 
certain conditions apply.  When dealing with planes and long term raids, the two hour rule applies.  
Otherwise, in order to be in any lottos at all, you must be present from the start of the raid.  Let's 
go into these in some more details.

<p>First let's talk about plane raids and raids that take hours and hours to complete.  If you're 
involved in the breaking process, no problem.  If you're joining the raid more than thirty minutes 
after the plane started being broken, you are now subject to the two hour rule.  The two hour rule 
states that you must wait two hours before you can be entered into any lotto.  This is done to stop 
people coming into lottos right when their MOBs are being done (ie. Gorgons for druids or Tentacle 
Tormentors for rangers).  Let's say a ranger tells their friend to come to a raid because the Tentacle 
Tormentors are about to be done.  The least they can do is show up two hours beforehand and help people 
before being allowed into a lotto.  After all, why should a ranger that helped break the zone and get 
other people's armor for the past eight hours have to watch a ranger who just entered the zone ten 
minutes ago get entered into a lotto for a ranger BP? It's clearly unfair.  Because plane raids take 
hours and hours to complete, this rule works fairly well.  If you enter a plane raid mid-way through, 
tell the lotto captain of the raid.  They must keep track of your two hours and only they can.  They 
must also start the two hour countdown from the time you tell them.  You can't come into a raid and 
send a tell to a lotto captain saying, "yeah, I'm new here but I forgot to tell you, I actually came 
in about 30 minutes ago".  The clock starts when you send the tell to the lotto captain - end of story.

<p>With other raids such as Kedge, Vox, Nagafen, and City of Mist, you should be present throughout 
the whole of the raid.  It's not fair for a group of people to plow through all the fire giants in 
Nagafen's Lair or searhorses in Kedge Keep just to have somebody come in at the end and say "sorry 
I'm late, I'm in on the Cloak of Flames if it drops right?" Wrong.  If you want to help out and show 
you deserve to be in on that lotto, help out from the start like everybody else.  It's not a lot to 
ask - these types of raids only last an hour or two and are a far cry from the time it takes to clear 
out an entire plane.

<FONT SIZE=+1>
<P>Rule #7: No One Group Should Be Made Up Entirely Of Members From One Guild
</FONT>

<p>It is the responsibility of the raid leader to put together groups.  In putting groups together, 
they should keep in mind that with the make up of the groups, no one group should be made up of people 
from the same guild.  Every group should have at least one or more people from other guilds.

<p>Say a group of six members from a guild are in a group.  They loot a MOB and get a great item.  
Nobody will know but them and they may feel that it's easy to lie to the rest of the raid and say 
nothing important dropped because they can keep the secret amongst themselves because they're all 
friends from the same guild.  This has happened in past and even if it doesn't, people are always 
going to be paranoid that this <i>could</i> happen if a group is made of members from one guild.

<p>Another reason people may have for forming a group consisting entirely of members of one guild is 
to hog experience.  While XP shouldn't be an issue on a raid, hiding the fact that your group is 
getting all the XP <i>is</i>.  If anything, the experience should probably be going towards the pull 
group anyway, considering the fact that they often die multiple times trying to pull MOBs and make 
great sacrifices to bring a raid together.

<p>If a raid leader refuses to follow this rule, the raid should no longer be considered a Xegony 
Alliance raid and perhaps people should reconsider staying on with it.

<FONT SIZE=+1>
<P>Rule #8: Bring Entrance Fees and Insurance Money
</FONT>

<p>There are two raids that require an entrance fee:  Plane of Hate and Plane of Sky.  These two 
zones can only be entered via a portal up from a wizard, who must use a stone as a reagent to cast 
the portal spell.  The stone costs quite a bit of money; so much money in fact that each person 
on a hate or sky raid is asked to bring a mandatory payment of 50pp to cover the costs of the 
stones.  Considering that it costs the average wizard well over 1k to transport 5+ groups into 
hate or sky, absolute nobody should have a problem with paying 50pp for a ride.  If anybody fails 
to bring their entrance money for sky or hate, they won't be going, simple as that.  No free rides.

<p>Another thing we ask is that everybody, no matter what raid you're on, bring 50pp (this is in 
addition to any payments for rides into hate/sky) as insurance money.  Sometimes things get a 
little out of hand and go very very wrong on raids.  In some cases, it means the only solution is 
to get a necromancer to summon corpses out of where people die.  This also requires a reagent, 
a jade coffin, which costs quite a bit of money as well.

<p>This <i>does not</i> mean that you have to pay somebody the 50pp.  Just bring it with you on 
the raid in case something goes horribly wrong and we have to use it to summon our friends out.  
<i>Then and only then</i> will you be asked to contribute this money.  If you're worried about holding 
a lot of coin on your person (say you're a monk), just give the money to a warrior friend or 
something.

<P>Addendum: Nothing Rots, Ever
</FONT>

<p>Some people have read these types of rules and seen enough complexity to somehow believe that there 
is a chance something will rot because we are tied down in rules.  This simply is not the case.  If 
anybody has gotten this impression, it is false.  Let us be perfectly clear...

<p>Nothing rots, ever.  Not ever.  If something drops and somebody can use it, it's getting lotto'd and 
looted, no questions asked.  If nobody is around that can use it, hell, somebody can loot it just to 
freak out their friends with it, but we never get ourselves so wrapped up in policy that we forget to 
give somebody something.  The only time I've seen something rot was because somebody didn't know how to 
get to the corpse to loot it.  Things like that are just unfortunate accidents, but that's not the 
fault of the rules so let's just hope that never has to happen again.
