      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">20. &#147;A long time ago in 
        a galaxy far, far away&#133;.&#148; sounds much cooler than &#147;Space,

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">19. Ships in Star Wars always 
        realistically look used and beat up; ships in Star Trek always look clean

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18. Aliens in Star Wars don&#146;t 
        look like humans with bad masks! (Actually, they look more like muppets, 
        but are yet still more believable)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17. Not one Star Trek film 
        has ever made it into the top 50 movies of all time; All four Star Wars 
        films made it into the top twelve!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16. Star Wars is epic mythology; 
        Star Trek is episodic mediocrity!</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14. In Star Wars, ships cross 
        the galaxy in a matter of weeks; in Star Trek, it takes 75 years!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13. &#147;Kuat Drive Yards

        as Tribbles!</font></p>

        have to resort to Q to cure writer&#146;s block!</font></p>

        10 ways to make Star Wars: Episode II better than<br>
        Episode I.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10. Near the beginning of the 
        movie, Jar Jar Binks finds a light saber and accidently activates the 
        weapon whilst he holds it pointed at himself.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 9. Near the beginning of the

        no reason.</font></p>

        movie, Jar Jar Binks is eaten by Jabba the Hut.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 7. Near the beginning of the 
        movie, an asteroid destroys the home planet of Jar Jar Binks, destroying 
        him and the Naboo. Luckily, Padme survives.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 6. Jar Jar Binks has become 
        a slave on tattoine. He decides to escape, but forgets that he has an 
        anti-escape device implaneted in his body. His owner sets it off, and 
        he explodes, near the beginning of the movie.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 5. Jar Jar Binks becomes a 
        jedi but joins the dark side of the force. Yoda dispatches him quickly

        beginning of the movie.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 4. Jar Jar Binks eats what 
        he thinks is a yummy tasty fruit, but what is really a reactive core from 
        a blaster. His death is slow and painful.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 3. Jar Jar Binks is eaten 
        by a tribe of Ewoks near the beginning of the movie.</font></p>

        21 Reasons Why Star Wars Is Better Than Titanic.</font></p>

        it doesn't have hyperdrive.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 2. Yoda could use the Force 
        to lift Titanic out of the water.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 3. Leia is a princess, a senator, 
        a freedom fighter, and Jedi material; Rose is just marriage bait.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 4. Ewoks throw better parties 
        than either first class or steerage.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 5. When flying towards the 
        Titanic, Wedge can't say, &quot;Look at the size of that thing!&quot; 
        and really mean it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 6. It would be much scarier 
        to get chased around the boat by a raving madman with a lightsaber as 
        opposed to a handgun.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 7. Titanic is egalitarian 
        by portraying poor people as sympathetic characters. Star Wars is egalitarian<br>
        by promoting bug-eyed amphibians to Admiral.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 8. Said bug-eyed amphibious 
        Admiral manages NOT to lose his ship.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 9. We know Cal is the bad 
        guy because he sneers at the poor and treats his fiancee like property. 
        We know Darth Vader is the bad guy because he strangles people and blows 
        up planets for fun.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10. Yeah, Leo can dance, but 
        can he fly an X-wing?<br>
        *NOTE* Is this a scary premonition of things to come? This list has been 
        floating around longer than the Leo rumor.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11. Rose braves icy water to 
        rescue her man. Leia braves Jabba the Hutt.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12. There are always enough 
        escape pods in Star Wars.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13. Do you know what the Empire 
        does to self-proclaimed &quot;kings of the world?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14. If Luke were handcuffed 
        to a pipe below decks in a sinking ship, he would use the Force to get 
        the<br>
        key.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15. Nothing has the same sting 
        as &quot;I'd rather kiss a Wookie.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16. Han is frozen in carbonite 
        and turned into a wall ornament. Leo simply freezes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17. Han Solo would've steered 
        clear of that stinkin' iceberg!</font></p>

        sink. But who could've anticipated, &quot;Luke....I am your father.&quot;?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">19. Stormtroopers blast big 
        holes in stupid minor characters; everyone in Titanic was a stupid minor 
        character.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">20. When Star Wars was proclaimed 
        coolest movie of all time by half of planet earth, George Lucas did not 
        make a dork of himself at the Oscars.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">21. Titanic morals: A. gamble,

        Well, you certainly are an experienced fighter and there is little question 
        you could kick pretty much anyone's ass.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DARTH MAUL (cont'd)<br>
        Muahahahaha.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Slowly, EWAN uses the force 
        to grab LIAM'S lightsaber, jump up out of the shaft, over MAUL, press 
        the button on the saber, and slice MAUL in half while MAUL stands there 
        like an idiot and does nothing at all. He dies.</font></p>

        Whoaaaaa! I'm in space! Now this is pod racing! Yipee! Uh oh! Man, I'm 
        so cute.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">JAKE goes into a hangar, where 
        the main reactor for the ship is kept. He accidentally blows it to SHIT.</font></p>

        Uh oh! I better leave! Let's leave, Artoo!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They exit quickly. The ship 
        explodes, which stops all the droids and just makes everything great, 
        because it's always enjoyable when a serious conflict is resolved with 
        a slapstick accident.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">EXT. THE STREETS OF NABOO</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Gungans are dancing and

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AUDIENCE<br>
        Wow! Watching this party and all this celebration has convinced me that 
        the tiny, pathetic problem that has been taken care of is actually really 
        significant! Hooray!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Suddenly, the AUDIENCE realizes 
        that behind all the mindless celebration and kiddie cartoon bullshit, 
        what actually happened was the future-emperor has actually manipulated 
        everything, come into great power, and that one tiny problem has actually 
        been resolved, but thousands more have been created.</font></p>

        Three years, suckers. I'd make them come out sooner, but I work very hard 
        on my films, as I am an independent filmmaker due to my disgust with Hollywood's 
        commercialism. Now go buy some Star Wars toys!</font></p>

        UNDERPANTS.</font></p>

        in her underpants. Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it 
        personally Commander.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These underpants may not look 
        like much, kid, but they've got it where it counts.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I find your lack of underpants 
        disturbing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These underpants contain the 
        ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Han will have those underpants 
        down. We've got to give him more time!</font></p>

        thinking with your underpants.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That blast came from those 
        underpants. That thing's operational!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Don't worry. Chewie and I have 
        gotten into a lot of underpants more heavily guarded than this.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Maybe you'd like it back in 
        your underpants, your highness.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Your underpants betray you.

        is better than no underpants at all, Chewie.</font></p>

        The Empire has taken control of my underpants, I advise everyone to leave
