          Welcome to my Everquest Characters page. The picture shown above is 
          my primary Character Ulaa. There is a reasonably long story to the creation 
          of Ulaa and I am going to detail it here.<br>
          <br>
          Ulaa was created on Jan 26, 2000, 01.14.42 AM. My /Played is 60days 
          7hours 35 mins as of March 6th 2002. I created her specifically to twink 
          my Troll warrior, Garakk. You see Garakk had a wee <a href="#garakk">accident.</a> 
          I asked around and found the best class for twinking was the Necromancer 
          (no-one told me I would need to be at least 50 to do this effectively) 
          and so I started Ulaa. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ulaa originally started as 
          an Erudite, I got her to about 8th and got sick of running around blind 
          in the forest ( This was well before Paineel ). So I logged in a couple 
          of newbies, tried a Gnome and a hoommie and hated them. So I started 
          a Dark Elf Necromancer and have been flying ever since.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When I was around level 16 
          I was hunting in the west Karanas, killing off a nasty little Bard called 
          Tricia Windsong. I had just logged in and I ran into another DE (Male) 
          Necromancer called Tindal. We got chatting about sharing the spawn and 
          most of our chat was in character (I.E. we were role-playing). He was 
          there showing a young DE SK how to kill the Bard, I ended up sharing 
          the spawn for quite some time and had a good chat with him. When I was 
          about to log off he asked me to give a /tell to Ameron the next time 
          I logged on.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well I logged back in and 
          had a chat with Ameron (Tindal), Ameron was at the time about a 40th 
          level Ranger. It turned out he was the Guild leader of a guild called 
          The Silent Watch. They were a small group of friends, largely from the 
          UK, who hung out and played together, he invited me to join and I accepted. 
          Ulaa has been a proud member of The Silent Watch for over two years 
          now.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">TSW has gone through many 
          incarnations and has come damn close to completely disbanding at least 
          once. But we have survived. We are currently rated about 4th in terms 
          of sheer power on the Karana Server, not quite Ubar but getting there. 
          Unfortunately I am unable to join a lot of my guilds raids, well any 
          of them really. I really wish I could, I wish I could do my Epic and 
          I wish I could get my SS armor, unfortunately because TSW is largely 
          UK based and I live in New Zealand its just not possible.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most of TSW's 
          raids are based in GMT, so they will organise to raid at say 7pmGMT 
          on a Thursday. Now to me the equivalent time is 7am on a Friday. This 
          really sucks as a lot of the time I feel like I contribute nothing to 
          the guild, but unless I suddenly move to the USA or the UK its simply 
          the way it is.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Currently Ulaa 
          is based in SkyFire. This is a dangerous high level zone in Kunark just 
          across from the Overthere zone. It is full of Wurms, Wyverns, Drakes 
          and floating sperm. The zone is basically a minimum 51+ zone, Ulaa is 
          currently 55 and is happily soloing the named cycle near the graveyard 
          to get her 56 pet. I am 4 blues off 56, I hope to reach that illustrious 
          level this weekend if possible. I have some screenshots of some of the 
          stuff I am hunting to follow.</font><br>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Chromodracs 
          are pretty wussy as long as you keep them under control. They have a 
          nasty AE debuff (so dont pull and park them next to a group, not nice) 
          and a nasty DOT. Actually the DOT is one of mine. Its an early Necro 
          spell called Boil Blood. It does about 600 damage in 2 mins. Keep the 
          wings as a stack of 20 of them goes for about 20pp or so. Wyverns are 
          also fairly wussy, tho they can be nasty with resists and early breaking 
          roots. They hit damn hard and if Dark doesnt stick on first cast, run 
          to the zone. You do have Jboots dont you!?. The nastiest of them all 
          is the Wurm. No spells but they have a massive attack range. They can 
          hit you when they appear to be about 50 feet away. They hit hard but 
          not particularly fast, trick is to keep em rooted/snared and dot the 
          hell out of em. Do not let snarte wear off!.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of my biggest 
          wishes (Next to Epic) is to get the SkyShrine armor. To do that I need 
          to go and do a couple of big raids (actually one) into the arena at 
          Kael Drakkal, this will give me enough faction to get to Ally with Claws 
          of Veeshan and I can then attempt to get the silks (the guild has a 
          couple of items I can MQ I have been told). I spent 51-54 in Cobalt 
          Scar so I have all the gems I need overflowing from my bank, just gotta 
          get the silks.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After 55 there 
          is a spot in the city of Katta that I am going to go and try, I should 
          be able to solo through 56 on the guards there, and Ignite Blood works! 
          yaaaay!. Once I hit 57 the cute and cuddly little Otters in Cobalt Scar 
          are going to take me through to 60 easy !.<br>

        </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="garakk"></a>I 
        received the game of Everquest from the lovely folks at Amazon.com around 
        March 1999 and I created my first character, Garakk the Troll Warrior. 
        Now I had great fun with Garakk and at the time was a member of The Undergroundwarlords 
        guild. Unfortunately UW collapsed about 3 months after EQ's release and 
        Garakk was guildless.<br>
        <br>
        I managed to get Garakk to 18th and took him into the Undead dungeon of 
        Najena in EC. While there I was asked to help a druid recover his body 
        which had fallen down the well and was being camped by the nasties at 
        the bottom. I basically jumped down the well, aggro'd all the nasties 
        at the bottom and ran like hell into the depths of Najena. Of course I 
        had a massive train following me and died fairly fast.<br>
        <br>
        The druid however was able to drop down the well and get all his gear 
        and get out again. I ran back from my spawn point and found the Druid 
        camping, I asked if he would help me get my body and he said no and camped. 
        So now I am a Naked Troll in Najena, I shouted and OOC'd etc etc to get 
        someone to help me find my body, no one responded. Eventually Garakks 
        body rotted so I had a naked troll with about 50pp in the bank and no 
        way to re-equip him.<br>
        <br>
        About the time Ulaa reached 49th or so I was able to start twinking Garakk 
        with good gear. I finally got him re-equipped and headed him out to the 
        OT. I was able to solo him extremely well on the newbie side of the OT 
        until he hit about 22, then he headed out to LOIO and he has done the 
        classic path ever since.<br>
        <b>HUNTING:</b><br>
        1-10 Innothule<br>
        10-18 All over, died in Najena, body rotted.<br>
        18-22 The Overthere<br>
        22-28 Lake of Ill Omen<br>
        28-32 Frontier Mountains<br>
        32-42 The Overthere<br>
        42-45 Dreadlands<br>
        <br>
        He is now 45 and is in Dreadlands hunting there. I know the next &quot;classic&quot; 
        step is to take him into Karnors Castle, but I really don't want to stuff 
        up my OT faction, so I may take him to Lower Guk, or look around and find 
        him another decent spot. I've been considering running him to Kael Drakkal 
        and hunting him in there until he gets to Ally faction with SkyShrine. 
        Ill head to Sebilis about 52 I think.<br>
