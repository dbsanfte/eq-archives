        to do with this site.<br>
        1: I am going to add in a lot more EQ content. Not to try and replace 
        any of the BIG sites, but just stuff Ive done, neat screenshots etc.<br>
        2: I am going to add in more &quot;New Zealand&quot; stuff for people 
        to look at.<br>
        3: I am going to clean up the &quot;Pictures&quot; pages to make em look 
        nicer.<br>
        4: I am going to add a &quot;Profile&quot; page for each EQ char I have. 
        Where they have been what they have done etc. ( thats 3 Chars )<br>
        5: I have got a couple more Games Reviews to post as well.<br>
        6: Might add a web board. Not much point I guess but it would be an interesting 
        excercise. </font>

        that Science Fiction books and Bad Movies used to call the &quot;Near 
        Future&quot;. Usually they would have us living in either A: the dark 
        future, a world of mega corps, cyber equipped soldier/assassins and lots 
        of weird drugs and diseases or B: the Utopian vision, a world of flying 
        cars, limitless free power and cities that look like gardens.</font></p>

        in a time somewhere between A and B. Ah well Happy New Year etc etc. It 
        was funny logging into EQ on the 1st and having everyone screaming happy 
        new year. I kept trying to explain that they had in fact missed it but 
        no-one seemed to understand (A Little Time Zone humor there for you- yes 
        I know, very little)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well I have a little

        they rock!. I fixed a problem where the Pictures page wasnt linking properly

        site mail daemon rejected it, so I am going to put it up on here and give 
        him a link so he can get it. I hope he likes it, I put in a LOT of work 
        to make the damn thing run and look good. I will update it as and when

Did a bit of a change on this front page as well. I think it now looks neater and tidier. The whole site in fact should be a donkey load faster and cleaner to load. Off home now to post this and get it up live. Yay!.</p></font>
