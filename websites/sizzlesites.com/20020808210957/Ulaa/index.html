      <p><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="5" color="#FF0000">NOTE: Well we 
        went ahead with it. We have purchased a Domain name, arranged a host, 
        designed it and its now live. The new site isnt finished yet, so Im not 
        going to tell you about it. When its up there will be a redirector on 
        this site to take you to the new one. It looks COOL!. We are sub-hosting 
        the 4 boys at works, personal web sites, plus the Poison Dwarf gets some 
        space as well.</font>
      <p><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="5" color="#FF0000">We are going to 
        have a web board and lots of stupid shit. Its going to be fun :)</font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Damn its been near on a month 
        since my last update, and what a month its been. Goose (The boss- dont 
        you love working for a guy called &quot;Goose&quot; LOL) is away at the 
        moment. 3 weeks holiday. So Im doing my job and his job. Not that his 
        jobs hard, it mostly involves lieing about the place and chatting with 
        chicks. Just kidding boss hehehe.</font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Actually its been kind of insane 
        round here. We have several major systems rollouts due to go live so we 
        are prepping hard for those. Ive just started to use a new tool from NAI 
        called Electronic Policy Orchestrator. Its a method of remote managing 
        AV systems from a single console. I have to say it rocks. If you think 
        of it like SMS for AV youd be about right, and the damn thing is just 
        about perfect straight out of the box. We like NAI-McAfee at the moment. 
        But along with everything else, and prepping servers to go out, training 
        the new guy and dealing with Maddog, its pretty damn busy.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I havent been doing much in 
        EQ. I hit 59, got 2 yellows in and just seemd to have lost enthusiasim. 
        All my hunting spots are camped, or I cant keep a link stable in the zone 
        so I cant solo there. Im pretty much reduced to whatever XP I can get 
        during the weekends. I have a reasonably regular group that goes into 
        HS on a Saturday (NZ Time) and owns the place for a couple of hours. But 
        during the week days no-one wants to hunt with a Necro, and they complain 
        we solo all the way to 60. Weird.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Muzz and I have found not only 
        a company that will host our Domain Name (Free) but will also sustain 
        all the traffic we want to send his way (Free). So we are slowly moving 
        ahead on that idea. We still havent gone much further than setting up 
        the hosting deal, and probably wont till Goose gets back as we dont have 
        any spare time.</font>

        added a new NT admins Quote page as the old one was getting rather full. 
        So there is a new page <a href="html/quote2.htm" target="_self">here</a> 
        with some new quotes on it. We need to wipe the board so when I can borrow 
        a digital camera Ill put the new pics up.</font>

        so possibly the look of this site will change massively and it will be 
        being run by Myself and Muzz. The content will also change and will be 
        more of a fun look at tech stuff. The two of us do a huge amount of surfing 
        and often find some really cool, funny, tech oriented websites which we 
        could share with you lot.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We would also put up sections 
        on the 4 guys who work for <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/" target="_blank">W&amp;H</a> 
        as NT admins and possibly a little bit about W&amp;H in general (they 
        are a good company to work for) and a bit more organised stuff about New 
        Zealand. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The other thing we would do 
        would be to put up a webbboard where people could share technical expertise

        be just for fun, so dont expect anything too serious.</font>

        going on <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/fthesilentwatchmbfrm1.showMessage?topicID=220.topic" target="_blank">here</a>. 
        Its a pity really. I have enjoyed playing EQ for 3 years now and I always 
        though that like myself, the majority of the people who play, are adults 
        who just wish to get on and have a great time. The torrent of shite, and 
        the unwillingness of these people to simply shut up, accept the apologies 
        (note the plural) and go away has really dented my faith in EQ in general.</font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Samadhi just wont let it go. 
        A week later he is still posting to abuse TSW <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessage?topicID=1128.topic" target="_blank">here</a>. 
        He dosent even play EQ anymore?!. WTF is up with that?, I dont get it?. 
        Then I went looking through some web-boards and did some searches on his 
        name. It appears that Samadhi is a proffesional Troll. He doesnt seem 
        to have had anything nice to say about anybody in the <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/usamadhibots.showPublicProfile?language=EN" target="_blank">year</a> 
        and a half or so his account has been live. Then I began to pity him. 
        The kind of person who feels the need to go around tearing others down, 
        just for the sake of it, is in my experience a sad and desperately lonely 
        individual. I thought Straylion summed it all up quite well on page 3 
        of the above thread.</font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sam must be a deeply sad person, 
        and yes, I think I have known people like him before as well. No matter 
        what you say, no matter how much you apologise and try to put it right, 
        they will continue to abuse you, simply because making someone else feel 
        bad makes them feel happy. Note he even has a little online fan club. 
        Wonder if he actually has any friends?.</font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ah well, I cant help dweebs 
        like that, just ignore em.</font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Found <a href="http://www.evilcon.com/stuff/Kaboom.swf" target="_blank">this.</a> 
        Its sick as hell but actually a lot of fun.</font>

        Vampire Slayer series 4 to come out on <a href="http://www.buffyguide.com/merchandise/dvd_uk.shtml" target="_blank">DVD</a>. 
        The entire series (up to 5) is out on video, but for some reason the DVDs 
        take a lot longer to come out. *sigh*. One of these days it will happen 
        and I will sit down to 22 hours or so of series Buffy watching, all good!</font>

        WHAT THE FUCK! Why am I so irate you may ask? See for yourself...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not only did they rip off Legacy 
        of Steel's web design, but now they're claiming they are part of Team 
        Ice!!! This crime must not go unpunished. Go there, mock them, show them 
        that the EverQuest community supports Team Ice!!! If you do I'll mail 
        you an official Team Ice sports tee*~&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
        As you can see this is not exactly condusive to cordial relations, or 
        even very mature. The chap who built our website 2 years ago (who no longer 
        plays EQ ) posted an apology here. Under &quot;General Forums/About the 
        site you posted...&quot; by Balendin. This was met with derision scorn 
        and abuse, as you can see. The abuse continued all over the public sections 
        of our webboard (most of which has now been removed.) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The abuse wasnt confined to 
        just the chap who built our website, but was in fact aimed at every single 
        member of the guild, it was graphic, pornographic, and if said in public 
        would have resulted in bashings and/or lawsuits. The webs a great place, 
        its nice to hide behind anonymous names/sigs and not have the balls to 
        post your name.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now the offending material 
        was in fact removed within about 10 hours of the first flame post being 
        made. However 4 DAYS later they are still abusing us. I had NO idea who 
        Legacy of Steel or Triton was until all this blew up. Hell they aren't 
        even guilds on the Karana server.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now somewhere along the line, 
        something about us &quot;stealing&quot; the name &quot;Team Ice&quot; 
        came up. Now I dont have a clue what &quot;Team Ice&quot; is, where it 
        came from, who is using it, who used it originally etc etc. I had never 
        heard of this until we were accused of &quot;stealing&quot; it. One thing 
        however, a search under &quot;Team Ice&quot; on Google returned several 
        thousand pages from all over the world. (Page can be viewed here) So how 
        exactly this is supposed to have been &quot;Stolen&quot; I am really not 
        sure.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Members of our guild attempted 
        to be nice and work things out here and here. Once again they were met 
        with abuse. Now Im not saying we are perfect and there has been plenty 
        of flaming on both sides (by me as well), but at least we have attempted 
        to make things right. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I would like to publicly apologize 
        to members of LOS and Triton for things I said about you and yours. My 
        statements were unfounded, childish and ridiculous. This apology extends 
        to all future/past/present members of both guilds, and includes anything 
        I have said/posted, may say, might have been thinking, possibly was going 
        to say but decided not to. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just wanted to add, this apology 
        is not a piss-take. The Leader of Triton is a Necro called Zaar who I 
        have huge respect for as a valued member of the Necro community. Along 
        with Zaar, they have another member called BrownIvy, who again I have 
        huge respect for, both of them have contributed a large amount to the 
        general Knowledge surrounding Necro's over the years. /bow to them..</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This apology is to everybody 
        except this guy, who it appears to me is just an arrogant little fuck.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It seems that the people posting 
        on our board are not members of LOS or Triton, rather they seem to be 
        wannabes who are trying to show their &quot;loyalty&quot; to those guilds 
        in order to be allowed to join.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It seems this guy isn't going 
        to be happy till we disband TSW, submit the entirety of the guild to FBI 
        punishment and generally stop playing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If this is what it means to 
        be an &quot;Ubar&quot; guild in Everquest, then I hope TSW never becomes 
        one. We are a bunch of mates who over 3 years of play, have banded toghether 
        to have fun and someone to group/chat with. Thats it, thats what we are 
        about. We dont &quot;require&quot; time on line, attendence at raids etc 
        etc. We just try and have a good time. Some of the people posting on our 
        webboard must have been to this site, as TSW is being abused for having 
        to try 3 times to take down Cazic Thule. Now this fact isnt mentioned 
        on our site anywhere, only on my site.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I take it all those who are 
        abusing us took down Cazic the first time they ever tried it and it bored 
        them so much they never went back and did it again. Sorry, it was our 
        first pass at Cazic, and I for one had a LOT of fun doing it, and I know 
        the rest of the guild did as well. Not bad for a guild of &quot;Casual&quot; 
        players. I would think it would be very sad to be so bored with the game 
        that you didnt get a thrill from taking down the big targets anymore.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ah well, out of the mouths 
        of fools and babes as they say. Quote board updated here.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By the way (this is a long 
        one isnt it ..000 err he said long one!!) the best score on this website 
        is currently held by myself with 32. Its a hell of a lot of fun and very 
        addictive. </font><br>

        the menu again. I am going for a much smaller JS menu that will sit against 
        the left hand side top of this page. Check it out and tell me what you 
        think. I am also going frameless to speed up loading and make the site 
        more accessable. I liked the Omen-tree menu but it got a little clunky 
        and a little too big.</font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new menu is a 
        lot smaller and will load seperately from the rest of the page, so it 
        will appear after the main page has already loaded, giving you something 
        to look at while waiting for the menu to load. Its also a lot neater and 
        I think, easier to use. This redesign may of course take a while as I 
        have to recode all of the links to stop using frames.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I am still working 
        on putting the internal links back into the menu, so the games pages are 
        down until I can get that worked out. It shouldnt take long. However all 
        the external links work. If anyone finds a major glitch on the site could 
        ya let me know. TSW is going through ructions again with people leaving, 
        staying, accusing each other of all kinds of stupid shit. Its a game people,

        to me. It increases my ability to solo by about 100%. So apart from joining 
        as many TSW raids as I can I am going to be concentrating on levelling. 
        The guild needs as many 60s as it can get. So I am going to push Ulaa 
        to 60 as fast as I can. Once she hits 60, I will work towards Direcharm 
        and then do some farming in the Grey. In between if I need a break I will 
        level Garakk up a little bit as well, Id like to get him to 50 at least, 
        then he too can start to participate in guild events.</font>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I had one of the best 
        days Ive ever had in EQ on saturday. I got to go on my first HOT raid, 
        that was cool! and Ive got some good screen shots of that and a new section 
        on the raid page which can be <a href="html/Everquest/vindicator.htm#hot">found 
        here.</a> I had my first Necro vs Necro duel (which I lost but had a LOT 
        of fun with). The Duel got down to my opponent beating me with his 1hs, 
        which for anyone who knows necros means we were damn evenly matched!.</font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After the Duel I got 
        given a Velium Blue Diamond Bracer as the losers consolation Prize!. My 
        opponent then gave me the Scythe of the Shadowed Soul which he didnt need 
        anymore as he had replaced it with a Hand of the Reaper!. During the HOT 
        raid I won a pair of silk arms (which I had the gems to turn into a pair 
        of Rotting Arms immediately). I also won a pair of Silk Gloves (but dont 
        have the gems for).</font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After the duel my 
        opponent took me to the Scarlet Desert and we duetted on the plateau there, 
        he showed me the spawns and we pulled and killed some undead. Apparently 
        these guys are Blue to a 60, so I may head back there at 58. Right now 
        I want to make 58 and get Pyro, then Im going to go and do the 3rd and 
        4th Shawl quest, then Im off to CS to kill Otters for Crusty and Gems. 
        During my soloing I also got my first AA point, which I immeadiately dumped 
        into regen!.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A friendly neighborhood 
        Shammy then took me on the run to the Quest Givers in SkyShrine (another 
        place I had never been to). My question is how the hell did anyone find 
        those guys in the first place?, lol. So at the end of the day on Saturday, 
        I had aquired:<br>
        <b>Rotting Arms<br>
        Tattered Silk Gloves<br>
        Scythe of the Shadowed Soul<br>
        Velium Blue Diamond Bracer<br>

        I have been looking at changing servers. I currently play on Karana, where

        web boards to see if there are any ANZAC guilds capable of raiding. The 
        most interesting one, and the one I think would suit me and my play style 
        best is <a href="http://southernarmada.virtualave.net/" target="_blank">Southern

        description of the Dragon raids I went on last Saturday with TSW. I am 
        considering taking down the game guides as they are A: Taking up way to 
        much space and B: I dont think anyone reads em anyway. It would be sad 
        to do it cause I have put in a massive amount of time and effort on them. 
        I originally had them set up so players could add their own reviews, but 
        no one ever did.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I figured that player 
        written reviews would be a lot better than the usual pap you get in PC 
        mags. Most of the PC mags are owned by gaming companies and end up slanting 
        their reviews towards one game or another. One game I played, I read the 
        review in a reputable gaming mag a few months later and I wondered if 
        I had recieved the same game. The reviewer gave it a glowing recommendation 
        with a rating of 89%.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I personally thought 
        the game was massively buggy, the AI was completely shit, most of the 
        scripted events just didnt happen and in general it needed to go back 
        for at least another 6 months of development and testing work. Turned 
        out the company which owned the mag, also owned the games producers.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But as no-one ever 
        sent me any reviews and I just dont have time to sit and write reviews, 
        I think I will take them down. In fact I might make a poll with this in 
        it. hmmmmmm......</font>

        2: I am going to add in more &quot;New Zealand&quot; stuff for people

        5: I have got a couple more Games Reviews to post as well.<br>

        thought I would make it to 2002. Its weird, we are living in the times 
        that Science Fiction books and Bad Movies used to call the &quot;Near 
        Future&quot;. Usually they would have us living in either A: the dark 
        future, a world of mega corps, cyber equipped soldier/assassins and lots 
        of weird drugs and diseases or B: the Utopian vision, a world of flying 
        cars, limitless free power and cities that look like gardens.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I think we are living 
        in a time somewhere between A and B. Ah well Happy New Year etc etc. It 
        was funny logging into EQ on the 1st and having everyone screaming happy 
        new year. I kept trying to explain that they had in fact missed it but 
        no-one seemed to understand (A Little Time Zone humor there for you- yes 
        I know, very little)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well I have a little

        Yay for <a href="http://www.coolfreehost.com" target="_blank">Coolfreehost.com</a> 
        they rock!. I fixed a problem where the Pictures page wasnt linking properly

        site mail daemon rejected it, so I am going to put it up on here and give 
        him a link so he can get it. I hope he likes it, I put in a LOT of work 
        to make the damn thing run and look good. I will update it as and when

Did a bit of a change on this front page as well. I think it now looks neater and tidier. The whole site in fact should be a donkey load faster and cleaner to load. Off home now to post this and get it up live. Yay!.</p></font>
