          I logged on late, joined the raid channel and unfortunately the first 
          thing I saw was Jayk's call of Cazic Thule INC!!!!!. I figured he would 
          go down first time and gated back to Neriak to continue soloing. I stayed 
          watching the raid spam and TSW failed on the first try. So I started 
          the run back to Fear. I zoned in a made it to the pull spot to see this:</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This was the 
          second try. I ran in, set a pet and sent him in, dropped some mana on 
          some clerics, tried to land a few dots on him (failed) so I just started 
          tapping. After about 10 mins all the tanks went down and he went on 
          a rampage. I died.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rezzed back 
          in and started to get Buffed up again. At this point it was quite late 
          GMT time so several people left, but like me coming in late, several 
          more people started to arrive. We got ready, refined our Tactics a little 
          and CT was INC again (Superb Pulling by Jayk!)</font></p>

          even try to DOT him this time, I just sent in the pet and kept landing 
          Vexing Mordinias on him (1k reverse tap over time). Finally he started 
          to get really really low on HP and I started Defluxing, I must have 
          hit him with about 6 defluxes. I started to cast the 7th and I just 
          KNEW I was going to get the kill shot. Sure enough, Deflux landed and

          he did drop 2 eyes of Cazik Thule. I tried for one of them, but as I 
          recently got Zlandicars Heart I really didnt think I would get one, 
          but hey you dont try, you dont know do you!. :) The eyes went to Rezam 
          and DarkIvy and major grats to them! He also dropped some nice tank

          hell of a Day!!. I had a great time. I am really enjoying just going 
          to zones I never thought I would see and taking down mobs I never thought 
          I would get a chance at! The high end game is very very different from

          I joined the TSW raid as it was forming up in Dragon Necropolis (Western 
          Wastes Dungeon). It took a while to get everybody into the zone as a 
          lot of them were busy killing a dragon in North Temple of Veeshan. We 
          finally got everyone in and started the run to Zlandicar's lair. Man 
          that is one COOL zone!. The architecture and the feeling of the whole 
          place just rocks!. The Dragon Constructs are cool too. Think 40 foot 
          high animated Dragon Skeletons that hit like freight trains!.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We made it through 
          the Cheetari tunnels and ran through the waterfall and into the corridor 
          leading to Zlandicars Room. Unfortunately Zlandicar had chosen that 
          moment to take a little wander to have a look at the pretty waterfall. 
          OOPS!. Total Party Wipeout. We all got rezzed back in and rebuffed. 
          Darkform led us through the tactics and we began the ran in.</font></p>

          a Zerg attack. The MT managed to regain aggro, but the CH chain got 
          a little confused (I think, Im going by raid spam here). It didn't matter, 
          Zlandicar died. So did I, that DOT is nasty. I really really have to 
          work on getting some more resist gear. </font></p>

          came the allocation of loot. I had turned up for the chance to get Zlandicars 
          heart. This is about the uberest Item a Necromancer can get in the game 
          (next to the Necro Epic) The heart looks like a cutlass when equipped 
          and adds +5 HP regen per tick. To a Necro with our range of HP/Mana 
          conversion spells, HP is everything. I have recently started to swap 
          out +INT gear for +HP gear and the difference in being able to solo 
          if fantastic. So adding an additonal +5HP regen is HUGE. Anyway, our 
          GuildLeader, The Mighty Roydalmofo, was kind enough to award the heart 
          to me!!!. Woot!. I went soloing last night and the extra regen was amazing, 
          I can pull pretty much non-stop with Lich up all the time. Once I add 
          in the 3 points of AA regen I will be able to run around with Lich up 
          all the time and not lose HP!.</font></p>

          </b>I went to the Temple of Veeshan &quot;Halls of Testing&quot; on 
          a raid with TSW on Saturday Morning. I had a blast!. Even though the 
          only thing I did was sit and dump mana to Clerics the whole time cause 
          every single one of my spells bounced. Couldn't land nada on any mob. 
          Had a GREAT day though. I have never been on a raid to HoT before so 
          it was a first for me. The raid went really well with lots of goodies 
          dropping for tanks and priest classes. We had about 4 drops of silk 
          gloves (I got one), one drop of silk arms (I got, don't think anyone 
          else wanted em at the time) and one drop of Silk Robe (WOOT! Grats to 
          Anuwin!)</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Basically all 
          the casters would hang behind a wall because of the AOE attacks from 
          the MObs. The tanks and clerics would hang just in front of that wall, 
          and the MObs would be pulled to them by a fantastic puller called Kaz. 
          Every now and again we would get an add but TSW is now efficient enough 
          to be able to deal with multiple adds. (At one point we had 3 in the 
          kill zone.) As people left our ability to deal with multiples went down 
          and we had 2 TPWs, but it was all good and everybody had a great time.</font></p>

          because I couldnt land any spells on any MOBs, I was reduced to mana 
          twitching. I think I did a good job, and recieved several /tells from 
          people praising my efforts. (Even the Clerics were happy with what I 
          was doing and were quite apologetic about having to ask for my Mana.

          MOBs I have never seen before. The raid was already underway when I 
          logged in (7.00AM NZ Time Sunday Morning ick!) and zoned into POG. I 
          ran across the lake and joined the raid.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They were busy 
          pulling the Protectors because we were planning to Kill Treeah Greenroot. 
          Treeah is a named MOB that summons all the protectors in the zone to 
          aid it. So you have to kill all the protectors and then pull the tree. 
          We dispatched all the Protectors in rapid style, and proceeded to Pull 
          Treeah. I manged to drop about 5 splurts and 4 or so Ignite Bloods on

          some of the raid left and we moved to a new spot near a big stone symbol 
          looking thing. We started to pull all these little floaty lights (which 
          I was told drop Necro and Int Caster gear) We pulled tens of them and 
          the little buggers refused to drop anything at all. We were about to 
          leave and the puller tells us he wanted to try and pull a Thifling Focusser. 
          Now this MOB is a Guard around Tunare herself. We figured, last pull 
          of the day, what the hell, we will see what happens. So we pull it with 
          about 25 of us there. 35 minutes later it died. Im not kidding, these 
          things have about the same HP as Treeah but their Regeneration rate 
          is INSANE!!!!.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I figured out 
          later I did over 37K of damage in spells, the other Necro in the party, 
          Entwain, did over 50K. We both had augmented 56 Monk pets out as well, 
          so add another 80K to that for both pets. Thats nearly 200K of damage 
          between the 2 of us alone. Let alone what 4-5 60 tanks in full SS and 
          Uberweaps, rogues, shammies with Epic Dots, wizzies etc were doinbg 
          to it. Towards the end of the fight, even the clerics had pets out!!

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recently TSW 
          went on a Vindicator raid. I was in SF from the night before and got 
          a kind port from Toji, to Wakening Lands. I was really after only one 
          thing that day. I have been trying to get to ally with Claws of Veeshan 
          for ages. I know I should camp out in Kael Drakkal and do one Avatar 
          of War raid, which would easily take me to ally. Unfortunately that 
          just hasnt happened.<br>
          <br>
          So anyway we form up at the bank ramp. There is about 40-50 TSW on the 
          ramp, Ive got every graphical and chat option turned off and my AMD 
          1100, 512MB RAM, Geforce 2-64 is still running like a bag of crippled 
          lepers. We pull everything around the bank area including the banker 
          (which really pissed off some guy who was there to do his banking) and 
          head up towards the Arena.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We form'd up 
          on the right side and Kazaezel proceeds to slowly pull the area to us. 
          We clear all the protectors and the named giant guards and get ready 
          for the pull.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally the 
          call goes out to get ready as Vindi was about to be inc. My assigned 
          job during this raid was to mana dump to Tojimitz, who is a 60th (I 
          think) Wizzie. Toji has some kind of Uber Nuke, the only guild wizzie 
          who does, and it was my job to keep him supplied with mana till Vindicator 
          went down. So finally it happened:<br>
          &quot;VINDICATOR IS INCOMING!&quot;<br>
          Up till then everyone had been laughing, joking and generally pissing 
          about. As soon as that call was heard we all got deadly serious.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Vindi came with 
          a friend, a Protector of Zek. He got charmed and sent right back at 
          Vindicator, tho not without serious difficulty on the behalf of the 
          guilds chanters. Aflac stood tough and took aggro. It must be quite 
          terrifying to stand in front of a MOB like Vindicator, as you get quaded 
          for 380 or so a time, trusting that the Clerics will get the CH rotation 
          right. They did, mostly.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the end The 
          Silent Watch took down Vindicator in 2mins 45 seconds with 4 deaths, 
          including an add. Thats not damn bad at all for our first attempt. We 
          will get better I am sure, as we are apparently going to use Vindi as 
          a training tool for the higher level MOB's. Before Vindi came in, during 
          the clearing of the area I won a pair of Tattered Silk Arms, and Vindi 
          himself dropped the Non Illusion Cold based Direct Damage spell which 
          I was awarded (Thanks so much Vizjeri!!)</font></p>

          I was so busy Dumping mana to Toji, I didnt get a chance to cast anything 
          on Vindicator so I didnt get the Faction hit. Ah well, Im kindly now, 
          one more raid....</font></p>
