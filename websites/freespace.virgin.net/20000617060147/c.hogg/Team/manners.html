        usefull tips<a name="Assist"></a></u></font></p>
      <p align="left" class="team">I write to reiterate the importance of the 
        /Assist command. Any player that does not have an /Assist hotkey is doing 
        their group a great disservice as well as possibly putting everyone at 
        great risk. </p>
      <p align="left" class="team">As an Enchanter, it is my job to control trains 
        and multiple MoBs. There is little more frustrating for me than to successfully 
        Enthrall a MoB only to see someone whack it and bring it right back into 
        the fray prematurely. This usually happens because the player cannot "see" 
        the puller in the ongoing melee in order to assist them. </p>
      <p align="left" class="team">The cure for that is the F1 through F6 keys. 
        It is surprising to me, especially at higher levels, how many players 
        do not know how these work. Simply put, each Function Key (i.e. F1 through 
        F6) corresponds to the members of yoru group. You are always F1. The next 
        person on your group list is F2 and so on down the list. By hitting the 
        Function Key you bring that person up in your "Target Window" then you 
        need only hit your /Assist hotkey and you are instantly assisting that 
        person. </p>
      <p align="left" class="team">Healers take note here too please. Too often 
        I have heard " I tried to heal you but couldn't see you ". That is because 
        in the heat of battle with six members, a gang of MoBs, spell effects 
        going off everywhere, it is very difficult to try and use ones pointing 
        device to "pick out" the target. </p>
      <p align="left" class="team">There are lag issues involved here as well. 
        The Hotkeys DO NOT suffer from lag like your mouse does. Hit the F# key 
        and your Heal Hotkey. Boom...no long walk for your buddy, he feels better 
        and so do you :) Casters, if you use a pet, by hitting F1 twice your pet 
        is then targeted. Unfortunately by hitting F2 twice it doesn't target 
        your buddys's pet ( perhaps a letter to Verant is in order ;)) </p>
      <p align="left" class="team">I hope this will help others keep from making 
        those long drafty walks :) Good hunting all. </p>

      <p align="left"><span class="team">In its simplest form this basically means 
        looting in Alphabetical order, but even within this simple loot system 
        there are variations.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="team">a) You can loot items and cash without 
        auto split on - each person just taking the luck of the draw. This is 
        the simplest and the easiest method to keep track of. The only draw back 
        to this is some juvenile always ends up whining that they aren't getting 
        much.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="team">b) Alfa loot with autosplit on- this 
        way everyone will get a share of the cash, but items are still luck of 
        the draw- this can be varied for example if the prey are know to drop 
        bronze or something else more valuable than the usual rusty weapon, by 
        having a sub-alfa loot list- meaning it might be 'C's turn to loot but 
        'A's turn to get the good item. A pain in the ass to keep track of this 
        one so I prefer not to use it as I hate keeping lists:)</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="team">c) You can Loot as above (without auto 
        on) but have a set cash value limit to loot up to- this means that once 
        you have looted up to that value (cash and items), your turn is over- 
        this is more relative at higher levels and does demand a certain amount 
        of trust within the group. As one that I have only come across recently-and 
        am using more and more, it works well and limits the amount of small change 
        you end up carrying.</span></p>

      <p align="left"><span class="team"><u>Auto Split<a name="auto"></a></u></span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="team">Fairly self explanatory if you go to 
        the options you can set this to on or off- on will mean that any cash 
        loot is automatically split between the party However! Be aware it splits 
        coins evenly, not amounts. Thus if a party of three loots a corpse with 
        1 pp, 1 gp and 1 sp, the looter will get a platinum, another person will 
        get a gold and another person will get a silver. Big difference! -But 
        this will also balance out in the end if you are Alfa looting, but if 
        you want to be totally finickerty and completely egalitarian,(and totally 
        trust your party) have one person go to the bank and start at zero loot, 
        loot every monster and split the money evenly with the party at the end 
        of the day. To be really frugal, make your treasurer the person with the 
        highest charisma and local faction and have him sell any extra items before 
        the final accounting.(Lifted from Alkahzars page-((Submitted by Llyndeyr

      <p align="left"><span class="team"><u>Loot now split later<a name="later"></a></u></span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="team">This is simple but needs a lot of trust- 
        one person (usually the person with the most containers and most weight 
        allowance) loots everything -- money and cash and sells it all and splits 
        the profits between the group at the end of the hunt. Or here is another 
        tip for maximizing profits while hunting with a group: This will take 
        a lot of trust, so if you do not know your party members well do not do 
        it. 1. Get a lot of backpacks, sacks or chests and distribute them to 
        all party members. 2. Have one person loot the corpse until he is full, 
        then the next person loots, and so on. 3. Do not go sell until everyone 
        is full. 4. Have the person with the highest charisma sell all the items 
        at a shop that will give him/her the best prices (most likely his/her 
        home city). 5. Then split the gold between all members as the party sees 
        fit (we always do an even split). 6. Now if there is an item that a person 
        wants the party can have them buy it and split the money between the group 
        or the group can give it to the person. This works very well with a group 
        that hunts very often together. We have employed this tactic to our advantage 
        very often but everyone needs to remember that people get dropped from 
        the server. They will come back with the stuff or your share of the gold(if 
        they are honorable). (Submitted by Brambo the Barbarian) </span></p>

      <p align="left"><span class="team">This involves typing the command ......../random 
        100...... which will give you a random dice roll - the person who rolls 
        closest to 100 - wins.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="team">If a group is hunting an area where 'good' 
        items are drooped - i.e. special weapons or artifact's- then to be fair,if 
        a group assisted in the hunt then the group should have a fair chance 
        of getting that item- regardless of if they already own one or not. Let 
        me explain how we have worked it in the past . During a hunt any items 
        rolled for are open to every player even if that player already owns one, 
        they can still roll the dice. However should the same item come up for 
        a roll again, whoever already won it-- can not roll again for that item. 
        You could change this slightly to those who can use the item only roll- 
        or to only those who do not own the item roll- but unless you are all 
        really good friends someone will get miffed and feel missed out, because 
        after all- a lot of the time we are talking a lot of money!</span></p>

      <p align="left"><span class="team">OK I know its real basic stuff - but 
        its amazing how many groups we have hunted with who forget. Root or snare 
        save lives- no exaggeration, if one of your victims should get away- a 
        lot of the time they run off and bring some very very nasty friends with 
        them- and by the time you have realize your in trouble ( we all know how 
        hectic a big group fight can get) it is often too late. So either designate 
        a person to cast snare or root or just make sure its a habit anyone who 
        has the spell gets into. Some people I know hate the root spell and much 
        prefer snare, the reason being a rooted creature will try and fight to 
        the death, however if its snared it will just try and run away. At the 
        ends of the day I don't care if its rooted or snared as long as it doesn't 
        go get friends! If one does get away - and you know a &quot;Train&quot; 
        is coming and that you are going to have to run, for goodness sake shout 
        to warn the whole area- we've all been run over by trains - its not nice- 
        even worse when its appeared out of nowhere with no warning, make a hot 
        button just in case.</span></p>

      <p align="left"><span class="team">Use the assist command! I didn't discover 
        this till we started hunting dungeons in larger groups, what this basically 
        means is the person who pulls the monsters for the group usually arrives 
        being hit by more than one- the quickest way is to kill that one creature 
        first - to ensure you are all hitting the same thing make an assist button 
        - target the puller and use the assist key which will make you target 
        the same monster. This is also essential if you are lucky enough to have 
        an enchanter in the group who can mesmerize any creature in the crowd 
        that isn't being hit, its very satisfying to get it right and just pick 
        them off one at a time:)</span></p>

        sorry had to add that , I love my bibs) what you forget sometimes is you 
        wizard friend- quietly standing at the back is often hitting for a lot 
        more per cast- but is very vulnerable, so always watch the casters health 
        and casters-- if you get one on you-- TELL the group, because it can be 
        missed. Also a word about healers- a lot of mobs have an unhealthy hatred 
        of anyone who heals- so all of a sudden your cleric or druid can suddenly 
        find themselves with a very unwanted fan club. Where ever possible try 
        and save healing till after the battle, this is not always an option and 
        don't let someone die cos your worried about being mobbed( I really admire

        Rooted out By Eldarian</font></u></b></font></p>
      <p align="left" class="team">Following a short converstation with a GM after 
        a bit of prodding he revealed 2 things of interest: </p>
      <p align="left" class="team">Xp awards are level based ( no suprise there 
        ). But also your class goes someway to determining how much XP you gain 
        from each kill. I was unable to get a class breakdown later, being told 
        that such information is not available to the players. </p>
      <p align="left" class="team">But as general observations I have found that 
        if you have a group with a wide level range ( I once hunted at 13 with 
        a level 19 partner and we both ended up with a bubble of XP) it is better 
        for the group as a whole to hunt a wide range of monsters. </p>
      <p align="left" class="team">For instance a goblin miner will be green to 
        the level 28 wizard, but will be blue to the level 24 cleric. While the 
        wizard will get no xp from the miner, the cleric would get more than if 
        the miner was blue to the wizard. This is one reason why people like to 
        either be the highest level or close to the highest level in a group but 
        as long as the group takes the time to see to everyones needs ( which 
        IMO a good group should) then no one will feel left out and everyone will 
        still have fun. </p>
      <p align="left" class="team">So, unless your in some sort of personal race 
        to get level 50 in the shortest time having fun is the whole point. </p>

      <p align="left" class="team">No one Ive met who plays enjoys dying. When 
        you are soling Dying is just a matter of mourning your XP loss and going 
        off to recover your body. In a group death takes on other dimensions. 
        First of all the person who died isnt going to happy despite what they 
        may be saying (Unless the death was heroic in some way). You then have 
        the time to wait for the person to return to where you were hunting. </p>
      <p align="left" class="team">During this time you have to deceide if you 
        are going to carry on fighting or wait till the person/people return. 
        First thing you should do is ask if the dead group member needs help in 
        returing to his/her body. Its no fun running across 6 zones without a 
        weapon, and nothing is worse than dying on your way to recover a corpse. 
        Casters will most likely be bound just outside the zone but may still 
        need help in the actual recovery. You should also ask periodically if 
        the person is ok as they travel and be prepared to go out to assist if 
        they get lost or something else happens. </p>
      <p align="left" class="team">You may lose a hunting spot but people appreciate 
        the effort and making a long term friend is worth far more than any XP 
        or loot you may lose because of time lost hunting. </p>
      <p align="left" class="team">The group should then keep an eye on the person 
        who just died to see that they dont die again right away, even if you 
        have to zone early or flee a fight you may have been able to win. This 
        is especially true if the group is close to level or has just leveled 
        and needs to secure it. There really is no way to avoid death. But the 
        group can limit the impact it has on their hunting companions. A few pointers: 
      </p>
      <p align="left" class="team">1. Pulling is dangerous - If the puller dies 
        and someone else is able to pull then switch pullers. If thats not possible 
        then reward the puller in some other way: Extra loot, and lots of compliments. 
      </p>
      <p align="left" class="team">2. Casters are fragile - A caster may have 
        500 hps but will be getting hit more often and for greater damage than 
        a melee class. Keep the casters alive and remember you both may have 2 
        bubbles of health but yours will last a lot longer if you have armour.Just 
        because they are bound outside and your 5 zones away dont treat them as 
        sacrificial lambs. </p>
      <p align="left" class="team">3. Fight near zone for a while if you just 
        took a beating. Its a good way to get everyone back into the routine without 
        expossing the group to un needed danger. </p>
      <p align="left" class="team">4. If someone dies many times in one night 
        and your a regular group consider moving to a new spot or helping them 
        to regain the lost xp by assisting them to solo for a while. They only 
        have to do 51 % damage to get the credit and with a healer and the rest 
        of the group helping that lost xp comes back fast. </p>
      <p align="left" class="team">5. Dont dwell on death. Easy to say if your 
        not the one who just lost a bubble of Xp but if you dwell on it you will 
        more than likely die again as you try to gain it back by taking extra 
        risks. </p>

      <p align="left">(Recieved by email) -Keep em comming!</p>
      <p align="left"><span class="team">When in a fight like to have a tank on 
        front and back of the mob. Have the casters all on one side and that way 
        can watch the reaction of the mob to caster spells on screen rather than 
        watch hp bars and game text. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="team">Have the pull set up with back to casters, 
        assisting tanks come in behind. This way always have someone on the targets 
        back. If a mob from a multi pull leaves to attack a caster you can see 
        it leave to engage and pursue before it actually starts its attack on 
        your caster. This is usually your nuke or healer and responding is the 
        job of 1 of the non pulling tanks. The puller does the pull and future 
        group target selection. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="team">This sort of setup allows for good coverage 
        of the battle area for wanderers as well. And as always if your group 
        has an enchanter their job is to deal with these outbreaks and mes the 
        aggressive on caster mob. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="team">Personally only like zone edge when new 
        to the zone, find that you have to deal with others mistakes too often 
        there. It is useful in terms of finding out how things con and fight in 
        a zone. Your safety is your group and knowledge of the area, and the best 
        things are deep inside anyways. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="team">Agree with the 10 minutes of discussion 
        first in a group, like to do a "My job is..." when grouping with strangers, 
        clears the air about what might come. Like to see casters, especially 
        if 2 the same in group discuss what they will be doing. Casters then are 
        able to maximize the available 8 slots for spells and give the party a 
        better response. 2 shamans with the same spells and all you get is twice 
        the mana, 2 shamans with 16 spells up for combat... nuff said there. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="team">Usually my group casters are shamans, 
        druids and clerics. With this sort of group the healing load can be split 
        such that mob aggro due to healing is small. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="team">When hunting HG's the tanks need alot 
        of healin throughout the fight, by taking turns the tanks can take turns 
        with the giant. Down to 2 bubs switch off and back out, the other tank(s) 
        take up the slack and the injured tank is healed up, maybe throwin in 
        a few arrows, and then back in. </span></p>

      <p align="left"><span class="team">Hear is my great pulling tactic it works 
        well with 3 melee class and 3 casters, although you can do this with any 
        group, it works brilliant out in the open as well</span></p>
      <p align="center"><span class="team"><img src="groupsetup.gif" width="250" height="238"></span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="team">In this tactic you have 2 rows, the first 
        row is your melee class, anyone who can tank basically, i prefer shadowknight 
        in this case, failing that a good warrior with a bow or any melee character 
        with a ranged wepon. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="team">The 2nd row can comprise of you spell 
        casters, anyone with offensive magic, failing that more melee types if 
        the situation warrents it. The reserve consists of the puller and a cleric, 
        other healer will do, or even better a cleric and a other healer type 
        like druid or shaman works well hear. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="team">Most consistem spawns are of around 3 
        monsters so this is what i based the example on, each of the group pairs 
        into 2 people who take one monster instead of all attacking one, this 
        reduces death and downtime and is a fairly good tactic. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="team">1 The puller attracts the mobs attention, 
        prefrably from range so the melee can target there oponent before it hits 
        you. The puller runs back and in the middle of the melee and positions 
        himself at the back of the group where his parnter is, hopefully he will 
        get 1 mob on him, and the two of them can kill it anyway they like. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="team">2 The 2 melee character cast/throw/shoot 
        at one of the monster following the puller, and when they hit it from 
        range the monster breaks off and runs straight to the new assailant, this 
        is great with shadowknights as they can make use of there spells and pull 
        at the same time and they have the melee ability to stand there ground 
        in combat. This is when there partner (any class, at least 1 caster is 
        prefered though) helps them out and the two of them take there foe.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="team">3 Now you should have roughley 3 monsters 
        with 2 people on them, as soon as one of the monster drops help the group 
        that is fairing the wose and soon they will all be dead. This requires 
        that people almost stand where they are and you can see the whole fight, 
        you know what is going on and it is easy to get out of sticky situation. 
        </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="team">The great thing about this tactic is 
        the death rate, it is very low and have great downtime, meaning you are 
        ready for the spawn when it comes. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="team">The cleric does not have to constantly 
        heal one person so the healer is not mobbed by more than one NPC. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="team">The casters should have a pause between 
        there blasts so that they dont agro the mob, they then have some mana 
        left for emergencys and can play a more active role in the fight, even 
        i daresay melee! </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="team">The melee class are figting and none 
        of them is getting extreemly beat up, wich makes them easyer to heal and 
        there downtime is the same for each, wich reduces the chances of a tank 
        getting picked off while low on health. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="team">Downtime is lower, mana recovery is better, 
        the cleric doesnt wast all his/her healing on one person no one has the 
        chance to get mobed, tanks are not picked off ater battles and most importantly 
        group is happy. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="team">What I also love about this is that groups 
        are so much easyer to build, you dont need compatable class, just get 
        a warrior and hybrid, healer and caster and fill in the rest with what 
        is available, this group is effective with small spawns but for mobs greater 
        than 4 you will have to be even more clever and mes ones on the way, but 
        it is still the same tactic.</span></p>
