          the Basics</font></u></font></b></span></p>
        <div align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Well guys - as you know we are 
          the tanks, but do not equate being a tank with giving damage, (except 
          maybe monks who are better at giving damage than taking it- more your 
          damage dealing - fast light tank) because most casters can out damage 
          us every time. In the group setting our basic job is to keep the little 
          monsters occupied while the casters do their stuff, be it healing us, 
          mesmerizing the mob or blasting it. That is not to deny that we can 
          each of us do some awesome damage ourselves but the higher you get the 
          more you appreciate the importance of keeping a caster free to do his 
          job. </span></div>
      </div>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">So in the team setting there are general 
        rules that apply to most of the melee classes and then some specifics 
        to each class. And again I make no apologies for stating the obvious.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt"><b><u>General guidelines.</u></b></span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Always target the toughest monster 
        in the pull (or the caster if there is one)and preferably make and use 
        an assist button to assist who ever is pulling for the group.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">If a monster breaks off and heads 
        for a caster switch targets to that monster and do all you can to get 
        the monster off ( your healer will be particularly vulnerable to this 
        happening)</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">If the monster your hitting has a 
        damage shield - and you have a caster in the group with dispel magic- 
        tell the group so they know to try and cast it to remove the shield.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">If you have an enchanter in the group 
        who has 'Mesmerize' make sure you use assist to make sure all melee types 
        are hitting the dame creature.</span></p>
      <p align="left" class="teamtxt">If you have a rogue in the group, pull targets 
        away from walls/doors/lava so that the Rogue can maneuver behind it. There 
        is 90 degree angle behind the mob where backstab works. </p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">If you are down to 2 bubs of health, 
        but the other tanks look OK, -- Step back, stop taunting- and heal if 
        you can or just wait it out-no shame in common sense, and heroes are nice 
        but better alive than dead:) And at a guess this is the one we find the 
        hardest to do- but it makes sense:)</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">If the command to run in given by 
        puller or team leader, it is often in the midst of chaos- and while I'd 
        like to say the sensible thing is just to leg it - (UK slang for run :o) 
        ) - our 2 bubs of health will last a lot longer than our casters 2 bubbles 
        so try and be last- but be sensible, if all looks hopeless go- you can 
        help in other ways with corpse retrieval later</span>.</p>

        tanks, but our cleric abilities can be of huge use before and after a 
        fight.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">If you have a shaman or druid in the

        buffs on people in the absence of any better- ( I found out recently that 
        'center' is not only a buff but can also be used to heal if multiple casts 
        are made- its slightly less manna intensive than light healing.)</span></p>

      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">In the absence of a cleric, druid 
        or shaman you will most likely end up being group healer, but stress to 
        the group that your heal is not really an in battle spell, more of a after 
        battle spell, having said that you do have lay hands to use but it usually 
        is an emergency cast and don't let you team rely on that miracle:)</span></p>
      <p align="left" class="teamtxt"><font size="-1">(I recently reached level 
        39 and find that my heal is now somewhat more usefull- and have found 
        myself acting as in battle healer on occasion, but prefer not to&lt;g&gt; 
        also my shields are getting better and do stack with some druids buffs, 
        so I do tend to buff the other tanks and if I have a good supply of reagents 
        casters and pets)</font></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">If you do have a healer in the group 
        and you do have lay hands available to use- tell the group so the healer 
        knows to heal others before you if things get nasty, because you can save 
        yourself in an emergency.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Make sure you magic abilities are 
        up as high as cap allows- spell practice is a bore but can save time and 
        lives later.</span></p>

      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt"><font size="+1"><u>Bard<a name="bard"></a></u></font></span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Bards are meant for groups. They fill 
        in so many roles and add so much to a group. To be effective as a bard 
        in a group, a bard must not only know how to play his class well, but 
        he/she needs to know how all the classes should be played. Many bard abilities 
        emulate abilities from other classes and almost always in a lesser degree. 
        Never try to fill in a special role if there is a specialist available. 
        </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">The best way a bard can help his group 
        is to stay alive. Until a bard learns good song control he will almost 
        always be the first to die. Don't play songs if they are not needed. Make 
        sure your puller always gives warning before bringing a mob. As soon as 
        he says, "inc" you should stop any songs being played. If it's a multi 
        mob pull you have to know as soon as you start playing partywide songs 
        you will pull every unattended mob onto you. Learn to use single target 
        songs. Brusco's Boastful Bellow at level 12 is the first of these. Others 
        include Selo's Consonant Chain, Crission's Pixie Strike, and Fufil's Curtailing 
        Chant. Once you think things are manageable switch to party wide songs. 
        </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Learn to be a puller. Bard's have 
        many tools at their disposal to make them some of the best pullers. You 
        can scout invisibly, can break camps with our lull song, and can even 
        arrive unscathed by snaring the pull with our chains song. At level 32 
        (manna song) people don't like bards leaving the group , they like to 
        keep you there. But at that point bards still make excellent initial pullers 
        to break up camps using Kellin's Lugubrious Lament. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Learn how your songs interact with 
        other classes abilities. All enchanter speed up songs are faster than 
        bard speed buffs. Almost all spell stat buffs will stack with bard stat 
        buffs, but the song must be started after the spell has been cast. The 
        same goes for SoW. It will not stick if Selo's is playing, so wait till 
        all party members are SoWed before playing Selos.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt"> Learn how to use Shauri's Sonorus 
        Clouding (invisibility). It is the quickest way to get a party deep into 
        a dungeon. Its quicker than individual casting of invisibility and see 
        invisibility and since the song is refreshed every 3 seconds it is a lot 
        more reliable. Inform your party members that they have to stay in range 
        for the effect. If in a high train area always keep this song memed, if 
        you can get it up fast enough your party can just sit back and watch the 
        show as all the other groups head for the zone. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Protect your casters and healers. 
        After level 27 and obtaining Solon's Song of the Sirens (charm) this should 
        always be the role of the bard. Charm is one of the best ways to pull 
        a mob off a caster or healer in 3 seconds flat. (Due to a bug with charm 
        it is sometimes necessary to use the /pet back off command) Once the mob 
        breaks it's charm though it will be stuck on you, but this buys time for 
        other measures to be taken, such as enchanter mes, or just plain old tank 
        taunting. You are better able to take a few hits than your caster or healer. 
        </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Remember one of your biggest roles 
        is to minimize downtime. Make sure you tell your tanks to trade off damage 
        if they can. Your healing song is useless if you finish a fight and one 
        tank is down to one bubble of life and everyone else is full.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Make sure you know your roles in any 
        particular group. Is there a druid or ranger present for snares or will 
        you have to use chains? Is there an enchanter there or will you have to 
        handle crowd control.? Communication is very important to success as a 
        bard. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Lastly, know how to twist songs. If 
        you only know how to keep one song going at a time you are not being the 
        best bard you can for your group. If you don 't know how learn it. </span></p>

      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">In a pinch you can turn the tide of

        be used for healing after the battle. This will cut down your groups downtime 
        and let the clerics keep their manna for combat healing, something that 
        we really cant do at any level. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Leave buffing to those better suited

      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">1. The Rogue will position himself

        sooo Much to Iblisz on Tribunal for this - shes a star-- ( well considering 
        shes one of the Evil ones she is&lt;G</b>&gt;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Like the Necromancer, the Shadowknight 
        is traditionally portrayed as a loner, a dark horse on the horizon soloing 
        griffins or ghouls - or, sometimes as an unplayable pile of useless nerf. 
        Oddly enough, this latter view is only really held by those who never 
        made it past level 30... The matured Shadowknight is an excellent addition 
        to ANY group, even those with a full-blooded Necro present. Indeed, i've 
        saved the lives of a few high-level Necromancers whose fear and darkness 
        spells were wearing off too quickly. We make great pets. ;) Being based 
        on my own observations and experiences, this guide will be written from 
        the perspective of a 30-38 Dark Elven Shadowknight. Not very bulky, but 
        agile, and fine casters. Apparently, i'm also rather cute. =P </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">I also will not cover the basic fundamentals 
        of grouping, /assist buttons, loot and so forth, as they are covered admirably 
        elsewhere. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">YOUR CO-WORKERS ------------------------------ 
        First and most importantly, know your group! In a new group, the first 
        few pulls can be a little messy as you figure out the role of each member, 
        but pay close attention, and things will settle down pretty quickly.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt"> SNARE If you have a druid present, 
        don't bother with darkness, snare is more effective by far, and lets you 
        get down to business without wasting time and mana. Rangers can cast this 
        also - let them! They have little else to cast during combat, and this 
        lets you get in a few extra hits and save your mana for when it's needed.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt"> THE DARK BROTHERHOOD If you're grouped 
        with another SK, or a Necromancer, figure out who is casting darkness 
        to begin with, to save mana and precious time. That's not to say that 
        you shouldnt cast it also, after all, it may be resisted or wear off, 
        but this pre-organisation *will* allow you to get a good initial handle 
        on the situation and maximise damage. The other advantage of working with 
        other SKs is multiple Harm-touch. I've coordinated a triple HT pull before 
        - invis / HT / instant death for any troublesome opposition! Great for 
        taking out recalcitrant healers, and scares the hell out of people who 
        normally laugh at our limited DD ability. Don't waste it. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">ENCHANTERS I don't need to remind 
        you of the basics of working with enchanters... but i'm going to. Assist 
        the designated puller and do NOT cast DOTs on anything that is about to 
        be mezzed. DOT counts as a constant attack and will foul even the strongest 
        mez for some time. Your enchanter will hate you. And that's not something 
        you want. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">TANKS Fighting alongside other hybrids, 
        you will want to taunt in combat quite a bit, to regulate damage and minimise 
        the need for healing. When grouped with straight warriors, however, there's 
        really no point unless they're being mobbed or hurt quite badly. Believe 
        me, lower level warriors will have their hands full trying to get the 
        damn things off you as it is after you fill them full of DOT, and they 
        will always have more hit points than we. Of course, if the enemy attacks 
        your vulnerable casters or healers, dive in with passion, provided you're 
        among the designated 'bodyguard' (if there is one).</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt"> PULLING Our ability to invis ourselves 
        and our arsenal of low-level offensive spells make us ideal creature magnets. 
        I would suggest pulling with heat blood, siphon or lifedraw rather than 
        darkness, unless your target is alone. Otherwise, you could find yourself 
        being beaten by the targets bodyguards while he himself lopes towards 
        your team's camp at a slow crawl. That delay could cost you, as well as 
        annoy your teammates and foul up /assist as your coordinated precision 
        strike turns into a bloody free-for-all. Also, feign death can prevent 
        a pull gone wrong from ever reaching your group at all. More on this below. 
        </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">COORDINATE THE DOTS Remember to get 
        your DOTs in early if youre going to cast them at all (the exception perhaps 
        being darkness for stopping those fleeing mobs in their tracks). No point 
        casting heat blood on those near death. The exception - healers. Casting 
        DOT on badly wounded healers can help a great deal by gradually reducing 
        the amount of damage they can undo, and by causing them to flee more readily. 
        I personally DOT them all at half health as a rule. Smug bastards... WHEN 
        The obvious - cast when you SHOULD. If you're being hammered by three 
        mobs, there's little point. Know when to be a caster and when to tank. 
        Remember that some spells take a few seconds to cast. You will be unable 
        to attack or taunt, and in that time, a lot can happen. Make sure you 
        time things right. Dont taunt when youre about to cast! Chances are they'll 
        turn on you when the spell hits anyway. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">CHIT CHAT Essentially, it all comes 
        down to communication, both prior to and in combat. This is one of the 
        all-important foundations of the stable group. Designate puller, who casts 
        what to begin with, who will run to assist the healer/caster if they come 
        under attack. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">ARS MORIENDI ----------------------- 
        While the other hybrids favour downtime magic, SK's have an excellent 
        complement of low-level necromantic in-combat spells. Here i've covered 
        the ones i tend to use the most... </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">LIFEDRAW rules! If your health is 
        looking low, take a few paces back and start draining - you'll save your 
        healer mana, and will still be hurting your target in the process. Once 
        you're feeling perky again, re-enter the fray and get taunting! Lifedraw 
        is also a good way of keeping yourself alive when at death's door, giving 
        your team time to take the creature down without retreating. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">SIPHON STRENGTH - Good spell to cast 
        on lower level opponents, while clearing out the 'trash' and other weakling 
        placeholders, when you can afford to waste a bit of time. (Taking 10 strength 
        from a super-mob wont have any real effect, and its better to use the 
        casting time to get in the extra hits on those, but the boost to your 
        OWN strength lasts awhile and will be a nice help.) It's quick to cast, 
        costs almost nothing, is rarely interrupted no matter HOW much you get 
        hit, and keeps your strength up nicely for when it's time to face the 
        *real* foe. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">FEIGN DEATH - Get good at this! If 
        i'm in a group that i truly respect, i will nearly always stay and fight 
        while my friends begin to evacuate. (of course they often feel the same 
        way, which can make for some amusing situations) Feign can keep you alive 
        in a case like this. Also, its great for pulling a crowd - your gang stays 
        back while you pull and immediately feign. The stragglers will wander 
        off in clumps, leaving a few luckless isolated chumps for your group to 
        pick off. Risky venture, but sometimes a good one for clearing out busy 
        areas. I learned this from Syner. (Thanks Syn! =D) </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">DISEASE CLOUD is generally a pointless 
        spell, but has its uses. As a very cheap, very quick DOT, it makes a swift 
        and excellent taunt. Take advantage of this. It means you can taunt, then 
        dot-taunt again in a split second. People may laugh at the 'Hit by non-meelee 
        for 5 damage!' message when camping the Avatar of Fear, and i'm sure the 
        Avatar is quaking in his loincloth at the mere thought, but it's not the 
        *damage* that counts here. Think of it as psychological warfare. ;) </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">The judicious use of FEAR has prevented 
        many an injury in my outdoor groups, especially at lower levels. However, 
        if you are not familiar with a certain hunting ground or quarry, make 
        sure you check with your group before engaging and casting it, as some 
        conditions may prove fatally unsuitable. Cyclops in Rathe Mountains are 
        a good example. They're fast, even with darkness, and always seem to head 
        straight over the hill into a pack of their antisocial friends. But with, 
        say, Gnolls in South Karana, go for your life! </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Various terror tactics: *Darkness/fear 
        on target - slow them down, fear, and your group hacks away at the little 
        bugger for full damage without taking a scratch. Standard tactic. Fun, 
        too! If there's a necro in the group, coordinate this with them. If not, 
        knock yourself out. *If youre in the thick of it, and company shows up, 
        casting fear on the unwanted other WITHOUT darkness will keep them off 
        your casters long enough for you to deal with your current target. Best 
        used in open spawn areas where the runners are unlikely to attract friends. 
        Good for when theres too many to taunt AND stay alive. Just make sure 
        your group knows what you're up to though. Say 'feared' or 'feared other', 
        and be sure to announce when the fear breaks. Don't want any nasty surprises 
        sneaking up on that medding wizard... *Casting fear in a dungeon is something 
        you will do only once. After that you will know better.</span></p>

      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Rule 1 : Don't pull anything that 
        you cant make it back to your group with. For example even if your group 
        can handle 10 goblin elites there is no point pulling them if your never 
        going to make it back or you are in too poor shape to fight by the time 
        you get back. Also be aware that unless they are pulled off you the who 
        lot you pulled will be beating on you. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Rule 2 : Know the area. Unfortunately 
        knowledge is most often paid for in blood. Know what spawns where and 
        it will make you a better puller. One easy example is knowing that the 
        bar room and the knight room in unrest are linked. Knowledge of where 
        to pull from makes you look good and cuts down on deaths. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Rule 3 : Always take out the trash. 
        If your pulling from deeper then you need to clear any green trash out 
        of the way and know how long it takes to come back again. The last thing 
        you want is to come back with a good pull and have 10 greens tag along. 
        Even greens hurt in numbers. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Rule 4 : Know when to run. If you 
        do pull a huge train that you know your group cant handle yell train and 
        run for the zone. Don't take the train anywhere near your group and don't 
        yell for help if you know you cant win. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Rule 5 : Take charge. Your the one 
        taking the risks here so do things on your terms. If the group doesn't 
        like it leave, you will mostly likely see them getting their corpses half 
        hour later. If something isn't working change it, find a good method and 
        you are well on your way to being a really top puller.</span> </p>
