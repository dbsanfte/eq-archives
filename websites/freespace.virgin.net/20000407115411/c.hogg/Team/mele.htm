          the Basics</font></u></font></b></span></p>
        <div align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Well guys - as you know we are 
          the tanks, but do not equate being a tank with giving damage, (except 
          maybe monks who are better at giving damage than taking it- more your 
          damage dealing - fast light tank) because most casters can out damage 
          us every time. In the group setting our basic job is to keep the little 
          monsters occupied while the casters do their stuff, be it healing us, 
          mesmerizing the mob or blasting it. That is not to deny that we can 
          each of us do some awesome damage ourselves but the higher you get the 
          more you appreciate the importance of keeping a caster free to do his 
          job. </span></div>
      </div>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">So in the team setting there are general 
        rules that apply to most of the melee classes and then some specifics 
        to each class. And again I make no apologies for stating the obvious.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt"><b><u>General guidelines.</u></b></span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Always target the toughest monster 
        in the pull (or the caster if there is one)and preferably make and use 
        an assist button to assist who ever is pulling for the group.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">If a monster breaks off and heads 
        for a caster switch targets to that monster and do all you can to get 
        the monster off ( your healer will be particularly vulnerable to this 
        happening)</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">If the monster your hitting has a 
        damage shield - and you have a caster in the group with dispel magic- 
        tell the group so they know to try and cast it to remove the shield.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">If you have an enchanter in the group 
        who has 'Mesmerize' make sure you use assist to make sure all melee types 
        are hitting the dame creature.</span></p>
      <p align="left" class="teamtxt">If you have a rogue in the group, pull targets 
        away from walls/doors/lava so that the Rogue can maneuver behind it. There 
        is 90 degree angle behind the mob where backstab works. </p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">If you are down to 2 bubs of health, 
        but the other tanks look OK, -- Step back, stop taunting- and heal if 
        you can or just wait it out-no shame in common sense, and heroes are nice 
        but better alive than dead:) And at a guess this is the one we find the 
        hardest to do- but it makes sense:)</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">If the command to run in given by 
        puller or team leader, it is often in the midst of chaos- and while I'd 
        like to say the sensible thing is just to leg it - (UK slang for run :o) 
        ) - our 2 bubs of health will last a lot longer than our casters 2 bubbles 
        so try and be last- but be sensible, if all looks hopeless go- you can 
        help in other ways with corpse retrieval later</span>.</p>

        tanks, but our cleric abilities can be of huge use before and after a 
        fight.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">If you have a shaman or druid in the 
        group their buffs are more powerful but its always worth casting your 
        buffs on people in the absence of any better- ( I found out recently that 
        'center' is not only a buff but can also be used to heal if multiple casts 
        are made- its slightly less manna intensive than light healing.)</span></p>

        and you have invis Vs undead- after a battle - cast it on your casters

      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">In the absence of a cleric, druid 
        or shaman you will most likely end up being group healer, but stress to 
        the group that your heal is not really an in battle spell, more of a after 
        battle spell, having said that you do have lay hands to use but it usually 
        is an emergency cast and don't let you team rely on that miracle:)</span></p>
      <p align="left" class="teamtxt"><font size="-1">(I recently reached level 
        30 and find that my heal is somewhat more usefull- and have found myself 
        acting as in battle healer on occasion, but prefer not to&lt;g&gt; also 
        my shields are getting better and do stack with some druids buffs, so 
        I do tend to buff the other tanks and if I have a good supply of reagents 
        casters and pets)</font></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">If you do have a healer in the group 
        and you do have lay hands available to use- tell the group so the healer 
        knows to heal others before you if things get nasty, because you can save 
        yourself in an emergency.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Make sure you magic abilities are 
        up as high as cap allows- spell practice is a bore but can save time and 
        lives later.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt"><a href="#top">Top</a></span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt"><font size="+1"><u>Bard<a name="bard"></a></u></font></span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Bards are meant for groups. They fill 
        in so many roles and add so much to a group. To be effective as a bard 
        in a group, a bard must not only know how to play his class well, but 
        he/she needs to know how all the classes should be played. Many bard abilities 
        emulate abilities from other classes and almost always in a lesser degree. 
        Never try to fill in a special role if there is a specialist available. 
        </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">The best way a bard can help his group 
        is to stay alive. Until a bard learns good song control he will almost 
        always be the first to die. Don't play songs if they are not needed. Make 
        sure your puller always gives warning before bringing a mob. As soon as 
        he says, "inc" you should stop any songs being played. If it's a multi 
        mob pull you have to know as soon as you start playing partywide songs 
        you will pull every unattended mob onto you. Learn to use single target 
        songs. Brusco's Boastful Bellow at level 12 is the first of these. Others 
        include Selo's Consonant Chain, Crission's Pixie Strike, and Fufil's Curtailing 
        Chant. Once you think things are manageable switch to party wide songs. 
        </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Learn to be a puller. Bard's have 
        many tools at their disposal to make them some of the best pullers. You 
        can scout invisibly, can break camps with our lull song, and can even 
        arrive unscathed by snaring the pull with our chains song. At level 32 
        (manna song) people don't like bards leaving the group , they like to 
        keep you there. But at that point bards still make excellent initial pullers 
        to break up camps using Kellin's Lugubrious Lament. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Learn how your songs interact with 
        other classes abilities. All enchanter speed up songs are faster than 
        bard speed buffs. Almost all spell stat buffs will stack with bard stat 
        buffs, but the song must be started after the spell has been cast. The 
        same goes for SoW. It will not stick if Selo's is playing, so wait till 
        all party members are SoWed before playing Selos.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt"> Learn how to use Shauri's Sonorus 
        Clouding (invisibility). It is the quickest way to get a party deep into 
        a dungeon. Its quicker than individual casting of invisibility and see 
        invisibility and since the song is refreshed every 3 seconds it is a lot 
        more reliable. Inform your party members that they have to stay in range 
        for the effect. If in a high train area always keep this song memed, if 
        you can get it up fast enough your party can just sit back and watch the 
        show as all the other groups head for the zone. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Protect your casters and healers. 
        After level 27 and obtaining Solon's Song of the Sirens (charm) this should 
        always be the role of the bard. Charm is one of the best ways to pull 
        a mob off a caster or healer in 3 seconds flat. (Due to a bug with charm 
        it is sometimes necessary to use the /pet back off command) Once the mob 
        breaks it's charm though it will be stuck on you, but this buys time for 
        other measures to be taken, such as enchanter mes, or just plain old tank 
        taunting. You are better able to take a few hits than your caster or healer. 
        </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Remember one of your biggest roles 
        is to minimize downtime. Make sure you tell your tanks to trade off damage 
        if they can. Your healing song is useless if you finish a fight and one 
        tank is down to one bubble of life and everyone else is full.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Make sure you know your roles in any 
        particular group. Is there a druid or ranger present for snares or will 
        you have to use chains? Is there an enchanter there or will you have to 
        handle crowd control.? Communication is very important to success as a 
        bard. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Lastly, know how to twist songs. If 
        you only know how to keep one song going at a time you are not being the 
        best bard you can for your group. If you don 't know how learn it. </span></p>

      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">A rangers role in a group is primarily 
        that of tank , even though rangers don't have the hps of the other tanks 
        we do dish out a lot of damage. Rangers are also the best equipped class 
        for pulling MOBs to the group. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">The versatility of our spells make 
        us unmatched as pullers in the outdoors. Another role we fill nicely is 
        that of preventing runners, snare everything your fighting even if it 
        doesn't hold right away because someone has rooted the MOB. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Tracking will allow you to see what's 
        around before blindly walking into danger. In the outdoors you can pull 
        what your group is killing as fast as everyone can meditate and heal. 
        </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">In a pinch you can turn the tide of 
        battle with a some well placed spells but most of your manna will probably 
        be used for healing after the battle. This will cut down your groups downtime 
        and let the clerics keep their manna for combat healing, something that 
        we really cant do at any level. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Leave buffing to those better suited 
        for it. Unless no one else in your group has access to those buffs. One 
        that springs to mind is Feet like cat, unless you have a shaman in the 
        group you should cast this on all the tanks. </span></p>

      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">1. The Rogue will position himself 
        behind the target for backstabbing. Once the fight has begun, avoid moving 
        around as this makes it much harder for Rogue to keep in backstab position. 
        All group members should stay on the same side of the target so Rogue 
        can maneuver behind. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">2. Pull targets away from walls/doors/lava 
        so that the Rogue can manuever behind it. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">3. Keep in mind Rogues have about 
        the same HP as a Shaman. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">4. Taunt as much as possible to keep 
        target off the Rogue (see #3). </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">5. You don't have to remind the Rogue 
        to use backstab, if you don't see them doing it it's because the backstab 
        keeps missing or the mob turns on them just before they attempt it. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">6. Poisons are too expensive/time 
        consuming to be used except in the most rare occasions. Even if attempted 
        it is a one-time random effect. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">7. Rogues CAN now walk invis, but 
        it is VERY slow (Imagine walking with half bar of health). </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">8. If you're a druid, cleric, caster, 
        etc... and something is beating you down, DON'T RUN AROUND! Makes it much 
        harder for the rogue to backstab (taunt) it off you. 9. Rogues shouldn't 
        be pullers if there are tanks in a group. If a rogue pulls makes it much 
        harder to have things taunted off him. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">10. If a mob runs let the rogue have 
        room to backstab, don't need the whole group chasing or wasting mana on 
        it (unless its for snare or root). </span></p>

      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt"><u>Basic things for a Rogue to Know</u></span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Learn to circle strafe. Practice it 
        until you can do it with as few 'you can't see your target' messages as 
        possible. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Know the spell effect for stun (red 
        dots) and when you see it circle around, backstab and return to your position. 
        When a NPC mob begins casting circle around and backstab and return to 
        your position. </span> </p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">If there is a chance in hell that 
        that mob is going to turn it's back on you save that backstab, if not 
        use it as an extra pierce. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Nobody taunts off you like another 
        rogue, the most effective groups I'm in feature two rogues oppisite each 
        other or three rogues in a triangle. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">You are a group only class, on the 
        rare occasions you can solo you are not nearly as effective as you could 
        be at that moment in a group. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Always be aware of what's happening 
        to the casters. If they can't cast your most likely to die. Make sure 
        that they are always opposite you and if a mob breaks off unto them it's 
        your job to get it off.</span> </p>

      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt"><u><b>Eldarian's guide to Pulling<a name="pull"></a></b></u></span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Rule 1 : Don't pull anything that 
        you cant make it back to your group with. For example even if your group 
        can handle 10 goblin elites there is no point pulling them if your never 
        going to make it back or you are in too poor shape to fight by the time 
        you get back. Also be aware that unless they are pulled off you the who 
        lot you pulled will be beating on you. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Rule 2 : Know the area. Unfortunately 
        knowledge is most often paid for in blood. Know what spawns where and 
        it will make you a better puller. One easy example is knowing that the 
        bar room and the knight room in unrest are linked. Knowledge of where 
        to pull from makes you look good and cuts down on deaths. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Rule 3 : Always take out the trash. 
        If your pulling from deeper then you need to clear any green trash out 
        of the way and know how long it takes to come back again. The last thing 
        you want is to come back with a good pull and have 10 greens tag along. 
        Even greens hurt in numbers. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Rule 4 : Know when to run. If you 
        do pull a huge train that you know your group cant handle yell train and 
        run for the zone. Don't take the train anywhere near your group and don't 
        yell for help if you know you cant win. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="teamtxt">Rule 5 : Take charge. Your the one 
        taking the risks here so do things on your terms. If the group doesn't 
        like it leave, you will mostly likely see them getting their corpses half 
        hour later. If something isn't working change it, find a good method and 
        you are well on your way to being a really top puller.</span> </p>
