<br>
a couple months later i got my comp and got EQ, another friend of mine, Tondy, had already started a few weeks before me and since all my friends who played EQ were on brell, the choice was easy.<br>
<br>
as for race/class... i LOVE playing rangers in DnD roleplaying, always have, so the choice there was easy. i almost chose a rogue cuz i had played a rogue in Diablo at the game store i hang out at, and had the highest level rogue there. but my friends told me rogues sucked in EQ so i didnt pick one <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
i chose human for 2 reasons.. 1) i liked their look and their stats seemed more to my idea of what a ranger should be, and 2) my friend told me most rangers around were either wood elves or half elves, and i wanted to be different soo..... human <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
lol i had NO IDEA how the stats would play in the end game so i kinda screwed up when i made Tanari, but im still happy with her. lol to this day i remember dying within the first 5 mins of being in the game. i first popped in surefall infront of the ranger guild building, turned around looking at the area, and promptly fell into the water and drowned. when i repoped i was told i needed to get my body so i tried to swim down and loot it like i was told, and drowned again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  i gave up getting it and tried to get into the building, but couldnt figure out how to open the door haha.

I sorta wondered what kinda game could take up so much time so around easter time I picked it up.  Rhyno and some others had started a guild on Rodcet so my initial plan was to play with them but I never ended up installing EQ until august and I ended up picking Brell instead since it was the least populated server at the time.<br>
<br>
<br>
    I don't really remember why I chose to play a warrior but I picked a Half Elf since they were the sexiest of them all with decent stats.  After playing quake for a year Quiero was the best role playing name I could come up with so that's why he has such a stupid name ;p.<br>

We all came from table roleplaying games and i went hunting for the newst games in the US. <br>
I bought EQ, and my BF started to play it while i was still there, it looked cool, so i got 7 more and once back in Spain we installed it.<br>
 At first it only went well on 2 pcs, and we didnt know anything about servers , so we chose The Nameless because it was easy to remember, hence my SK Pecadora was born, and Xylos the mage and Taliesin the ranger. I played up to lvl 10, and then my BF told me he and his friend were on Brell and he could give us some stuff, so i moved there.<br>
 At that time , we finally managed to get the rest of the pcs to work with EQ, so elrrik made his long time loved dorf warrior, kycer was born SK,and almost all the kids at the store decided to be melee type. I wanted to be an enchanter, but Banari was already 24,so i had to pick some healing type. I decided clerics were lame, and druid gimps, so i was born a shaman. Escarcha means frost in spanish, and i thought it was a fitting name for Halas girl.<br>
Now Elrrik and all the others have moved to AB server, Banari doesnt play anymore and i am the chanter finally ! We are all on the same server and i love playing with all my friends. I soo wish i had moved Escarcha there, but soon is to open an other Euro server.<br>

How did I end up a DE necro: Well race was easy, I wanted to be Evil, isnt it fun to be evil (yea I was a pen and paper gamer, and also a computer game junky before eq)<br>
Class was a tougher decesion, to be a wizard or a necromancer....<br>
It finally came down to necros were liked better by the de community, and wizards couldnt hit stuff 5 levels higher than them at the time... or so my friend told me ;-)<br>
As a total newbie these seemed really important at the time... so 140 days played later I still play her and love her<br>

I play a shaman cause It seemed different from all the other class/race choices you always see in all the fantasy games.  <br>
<br>
I am happy for all the above choices.  While I have fond memories of the lady Jezebel, my grandmaster mage from UO, I have had much more fun on EQ.  I have made great friends on Brell and truly do believe the community here to be more freindly than many of the other servers.  I couldnt be happier with my choice of a shaman, even though it turned out to be quite a different type of charachter than I imagined when I started him.  (LOL I have leveled a warrior into his 50s just to be able to occaisionally hit stuff)<br>

I just picked it cos Brink had started playing on Brell for that reason and that it just was near the top (I'd bought the game then fell ill so he ended up being about 3 weeks ahead of me by the time I started paying!) <p><table width="340" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

I started on brell because I had some real life friends playing there as well.  I started a necro because they needed someone to help them find their bodies because they'd always get lost in nektulos forest.  So Xenolith was created for that sole purpose.. I tried an sk for about 3 lvl's and deleted him.  I stuck with the necro when I started solo'ing in Lavastorm and did so until lvl 20.. then I moved out into what then.. was just Antonica, Faydwer and Odus.  My friends don't play anymore.. but a few new ones do from time to time.  So here I am..  <p><html>

I'd be like, &quot;how can you find this fun??&quot; and yet I would just watch.  He finally got me to give it a shot, and man did I have a blast.  Picked wood elf ranger cuz I wanted to shoot stuff with bows, and cuz wood elves &gt; everybody else.  I went around a bunch of other classes, then finally settled on the wood elf rogue, cuz I like bein sneaky, and cuz wood elves &gt; everybody else =) <p><DIV ALIGN="center">

<br>
I made a barb warrior, human monk, human wizard.<br>
<br>
They where my 3 favorite and best AD&amp;D Characters.<br>
<br>
I messed up stats on my wizard (you mean I don't need Str?)but by the time I figured it out I was 20th lv and didn't want to re-start.<br>
<br>
I continue to play because of the people I've met nearly 3 years ago are now some of the closest friends I have in the whole world that I've never met in person. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><p align="center" style="line-height: 100%"><font face="Stonehenge" size="5" color="#000080"><span style="background-color: #000000"><img border="0" src="http://members.home.net/rgilson480/Pics/wiz009.jpg" width="234" height="233"></span></font></p>

Seemed fitting. As for class my main is a druid now but he was originally a wizard of the same name. I met this guy named Snub who was a druid and he was awesome. After deleting my character in frustration at one point I made my druid. On a side note, my druid friend changed to Necro. Heya Ickhor! hehehehe. Just like him I suppose.<br>

I originally played a druid that I learned to hate and then when Velious came out with Ry'Gor armor I thought hhm... this would look great on a rogue...  I then never looked back. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=11456" target="_blank">
