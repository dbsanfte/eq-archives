<br>
I was hoping some of you could clear up a few things for me.  I was contemplating fear, and how it can be done.  Below I've posted an image (which I hope shows up) of fear and how I &quot;think&quot; it was done when I've done it.  I didn't get moved to the pull team until about mid flight so a lot of what was actually going on and where it was being pulled from was missed, but this is what I could gather.<br>
<br>
The Blue circle is safe spot of course.  We sat there and the pull team was off to the west pulling things in.  Since there wasn't much room to go further west I'm guessing they were pulling south along the wall.<br>
<br>
Question 1.  Is that so?  I would think it would be done that way simply because along the wall it would attract less attention.<br>
<br>
After we pulled all the mobs we were going to there, we proceeded along the blue line.  Again, remember all of this is fairly vague.  I am thinking we travelled this way because when we parked I could see the portal out sorta in front and to my left.  Also we seemed to be in a &quot;corner&quot; so I'm guessing thats where we were.<br>
<br>
Question 2.  If I'm right, then what areas where they pulling from to here.  Just all out in front?  I noticed a lot of monkeys patrolling around the portal area.<br>
<br>
Next we moved from the Red Dot along the wall and then curved up to the Green Dot, which was an empty building sitting on its east wall.  It was empty.  I could see that bridge thing to the North East, so thats why I put the dot there.  We fought there a while, and then we moved from the Green Dot to the second Green Dot.  We fought golems and such here.  This is where I got moved up to the pull team.<br>
<br>
Question 3.  Where were these golems and Amys coming from.  Everyone kept talking about there being 4 Golems to kill.  I'm interested in where they were being pulled from.<br>
<br>
After that, we moved back to the Green Dot.  We killed a few more things and then we killed that big bone dragon thing.  This guy came out of nowhere.  I was the first one to scream &quot;Oh Shit!&quot; and wet myself because the group was currently fighting something else.<br>
<br>
Question 4.  What was that guys name again?  And where did he come from.  They were talking about him, but from what I gathered he wasn't supposed to just wonder in.  So I'm curious.<br>
<br>
Finally we moved along the Yellow Line.  Thats where we did a whole bunch of glare lords and big black horses.  God I hate those glare lords.  Now at this point everyone was beat, and leaving.  I hated it because they were saying that we only had the Temple and Cazic left.<br>
<br>
Question 5.  Where is this temple they were talking about.  And what all comes from there?<br>
<br>
A few people stayed and some necro went off to pull that temple, and then Cazic showed up, feard me, killed everyone, and the show was pretty much over.  A huge AoF.  Only he is skinny.<br>
<br>
So, if you don't mind, I'd like a few things.<br>
<br>
1. Correct what I am mistaken about here.<br>
2. Show me if you would, another way, or a few others ways to do this.<br>
<br>
Again, I might be off a bit here, because I wasn't sure of my location a few times.  And also Cazic was up, so I'm sure that changes the way its done.  Regardless, I'd like to learn more about how it can be efficiently done.<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

<br>
I know of 3 golems.  Fright, Terror, and Dread. One of the maps at Eqmaps shows the location of each I believe.<br>
<br>
The bone dragon was Dracoliche (sp?).  7 day spawn time. <br>
<br>
The Temple is the castle shown on the map.  Its in the middle of the fire ring.   The portal out of Fear is located in the temple.   Alot of Amy's are in the temple.  <br>

P.S.  Thanks for havin me DG, learned a lot.  can't wait to try out amy temple pulls like Kruunch there did em, should help CA out a lot doing it that way, seemed to make things a lot easier than the way we'd been doing it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubarrinsoulburner.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Barrin Soulburner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>some newbie</span><br>  Posts: 308<br> <font color=#CC9900>(1/16/01 3:39:41 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://eq.geauxonline.com/watchers/barrin.jpg h=496 w=293></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Fear Question</span><hr size=1> Actually if you want you don't have to kill the golems till the very end.  They are just annoying in the fact that if you kill them before CT is down you have to camp after each one.  Much easier to leave them up and mez them after they come to aid CT (when you attack him). <p><a href=http://www.eqforge.com/profiles/profile.cfm?ID=5173>Barrin Soulburner</a><br>

the advantage of pulling along the wall is that you have less chances to have mobs roam and end up behind you when you are pulling, it's also an easy way to CT as it allows you to clear the zone around him<br>
<br>
2) pretty much only roamers everywhere in the zone<br>
there is a gorgon nest, a scare tower, a fetid fiend house and a frightfinger house though<br>
one of the best maps to see where the specific locations are :<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.everlore.com/geography/default.asp?mapID=14380">www.everlore.com/geograph...apID=14380</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
3) the 3 golems are in small temples on the top of 3 hills, and have 2 amy guards each<br>
there are also roaming amys, plus a shit load of them in the temple (in the fire circle)<br>
<br>
4) Dracoliche<br>
cazic's personal bodyguard<br>
he roams pretty much everywhere in the zone and is a pain in the ass because it makes you pull around him (it doesnt matter as much on high level raids though since people can kill him petty much any time)<br>
very hard to control when you pull him<br>
<br>
5) the temple is inside the fire ring<br>
there is a bunch of amys and a few phobos as well<br>
pulling the temple has always been a blast and one of the only thing i still enjoy in the game (kiting 10 amys around will never get old)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
the stagin points in fear are pretty much the same all the time and tend to be the same on all the servers, because they are easy to spot<br>
<br>
some people like more to mass enter the zone and break it from the portal, but i would only do it with experienced people<br>
<br>
due to the pathing, clearing the plane like this is the easiest and most effective way to do it imo<br>
<br>
pulling the temple without agroing CT can be tricky, but it's just a problem of timing.. just need to get used to it <p><BR>

<br>
Main Kiter/assistant puller.<br>
<br>
Pull group mez/mem blur extras on pulls.<br>
<br>
Monk FD pulling with chainer.<br>
<br>
The first one is the one we used to break the speed record and works the best IMHO.<br>
<br>
Monk/chaining is probably the easiest and safest. That and you can pull Gorgons through the GY if you are planning on doing a short stint in Fear.<br>
<br>
Temple pulls are messy and except for a flawless pull, will take you upwards of an hour or more to complete. Even with a flawless pull and godo team, it will take you 30 mins.<br>
<br>
It's a cardinal sin to leave CT up these days. <p><FONT face="arial" size="-1"><B>Kruunch Spiritslammer (Ugliest Paladin o' Kaladim)
