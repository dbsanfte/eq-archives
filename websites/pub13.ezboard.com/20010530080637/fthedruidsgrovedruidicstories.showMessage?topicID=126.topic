[Wed Jun 28 23:38:36 2000 ] You tell your party, 'holy crap, I have 1900 health! Kick ass!'<br>
<br>
...and Xantheus has to do one better.<br>
[Wed Jun 28 23:38:47 2000 ] Xantheus tells the group, '2871 here'<br>
<br>
Tensions builds as Sahphire announces-<br>
[Wed Jun 28 23:39:11 2000 ] Sahphire shouts, 'in 30 secs, we will charge!'<br>
<br>

[Wed Jun 28 23:39:45 2000 ] Cinque shouts, 'Luck be with us'<br>
<br>
The charge call is made-<br>
[Wed Jun 28 23:39:48 2000 ] Sahphire shouts, 'NOW'<br>
<br>
More praying takes place...<br>
<br>
[Wed Jun 28 23:39:48 2000 ] Muligan prays wiht Hoggle.<br>
[Wed Jun 28 23:39:51 2000 ] Muligan says out of character, 'Love you guys'<br>
[Wed Jun 28 23:39:51 2000 ] Bello joins Turras in pray.<br>
[Wed Jun 28 23:39:51 2000 ] Wicc shouts, 'GO'<br>
<br>
I somehow missed the word 'GO' with all the pray and love in the air.<br>
[Wed Jun 28 23:39:58 2000 ] You say out of character, 'Love you too!'<br>
<br>
I come to my senses and sprint into Vox's chamber to get heals off. I get one screenshot off...<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/vox06.jpg><br>
<br>
...and I am instantly feared. Apparently, Vox has no love.<br>
[Wed Jun 28 23:40:56 2000 ] You lose control of yourself!<br>
[Wed Jun 28 23:41:03 2000 ] You tell your party, 'I am feared as usual'<br>
[Wed Jun 28 23:41:04 2000 ] You have been knocked unconscious!<br>
[Wed Jun 28 23:41:04 2000 ] You died.<br>
<br>
1900 health gone in one second flat...for taking a screenshot. WTF? I didn't even see it coming. <br>
Thanks for playing, good night.<br>

[Wed Jun 28 23:41:38 2000 ] You have joined the group.<br>
<br>
Upon re-entering the zone, I see the others who have met the same fate as me-<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/vox07.jpg><br>
<br>
Looks like Scrapp made another friend-<br>
[Wed Jun 28 23:43:15 2000 ] Lady Vox says 'You will not evade me Scrapp'<br>
<br>
Scorpia gets an epiphany - <br>
[Wed Jun 28 23:47:07 2000 ] Scorpia tells the group, 'so i take it she isnt going down'<br>
<br>
Darsan follows that up with his own personal insight-<br>
[Wed Jun 28 23:48:45 2000 ] Darsan tells you, 'well crap'<br>
<br>
Vox - 1 Darsan - 0<br>
<br>
To add insult to injury-<br>
[Wed Jun 28 23:50:20 2000 ] It begins to snow.<br>
<br>
Why can't it ever be nice outside when I am getting killed?<br>
<br>
I tell my side of the story-<br>
[Wed Jun 28 23:50:54 2000 ] You say, 'I never got a chance to fight. I was feared right off the bat...then some @#%$ killed me. =('<br>
[Wed Jun 28 23:51:21 2000 ] Trakaar tells the group, 'oh boy'<br>

[Wed Jun 28 23:54:10 2000 ] Scrapp says out of character, 'laugh it was done wrong =('<br>
[Wed Jun 28 23:54:17 2000 ] Rhage says out of character, 'How was it suppose to be done?'<br>
[Wed Jun 28 23:54:59 2000 ] You say out of character, 'Vox fought back. She was supposed to just lay there and take it like a good...ummm... Anyway, she fought back, and that was not the plan!'<br>
[Wed Jun 28 23:55:10 2000 ] Darsan tells you, 'lol'<br>
<br>
So now came time for corpse recovery. This question was brought up by Horus-<br>
[Wed Jun 28 23:58:27 2000 ] Horus tells the group, 'aye, but how do you recover my body if it's at her Feet? he he '<br>
[Wed Jun 28 23:58:45 2000 ] You tell your party, 'ask nicely?'<br>
[Wed Jun 28 23:59:11 2000 ] You tell your party, 'Excuse me, Ms. Vox? Umm...can I please have you remove your foot from the head of my corpse?'<br>
<br>
So, without losing a second, I jump to action under Superior Camo and start helping Sahphire recover corpses-<br>
[Thu Jun 29 00:07:05 2000 ] Horus tells the group, 'damn, Sahphire just ran past the Diplomat'<br>

[Thu Jun 29 00:07:22 2000 ] You tell your party, 'me too'<br>
[Thu Jun 29 00:07:28 2000 ] You have been given permission to loot Darsan's corpse.<br>

<br>
I went back for more corpses and Vox decides to rear her ugly head<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/vox08.jpg><br>
<br>
[Thu Jun 29 00:18:36 2000 ] You say out of character, 'AHHHHH!!!! SHe is trying to get through the rock!!!!!'<br>
<br>
Vox will sit there and lower her head into the area where the rock moves. Every time it is moved, she comes prancing over and looks at you through this space. It is kinda amusing to watch her do it - like a watch dog<br>
daring you to come into it's territory. Every time I move the rock, she comes prancing back. So, I dare say, 'Move bitch!" to her. this is what happened...<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/vox09.jpg><br>
<br>
[Thu Jun 29 00:25:33 2000 ] You say, 'Move bitch!'<br>
[Thu Jun 29 00:25:34 2000 ] You appear.<br>
[Thu Jun 29 00:25:34 2000 ] Taking a screenshot...<br>
[Thu Jun 29 00:25:35 2000 ] Lady Vox kicks YOU for 69 points of damage.<br>
[Thu Jun 29 00:25:35 2000 ] Lady Vox claws YOU for 205 points of damage.<br>

[Thu Jun 29 00:25:38 2000 ] You have been slain by Lady Vox!<br>
[Thu Jun 29 00:25:40 2000 ] Returning to home point, please wait...<br>
[Thu Jun 29 00:25:40 2000 ] LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br>
[Thu Jun 29 00:26:08 2000 ] You have entered Permafrost Caverns.<br>
[Thu Jun 29 00:26:08 2000 ] You have joined the group.<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/vox10.jpg><br>
<br>
At this point in time, I am laughing my ass off. I say, "Move bitch!", I appear, she lays the smack down on me and that is that. I mean, the timing just couldn't have been any better. <br>
<br>
This raid was not successful, obviously, but I still managed to have fun. <br>
