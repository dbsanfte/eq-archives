<br>
We are not gonna go FFA because...<br>
<br>
No one wants to go FFA, people depend on each other and the community is still very strong on brell, maybe not as strong as it was before the summer but it is still strong.<br>
<br>
There are no &quot;Uber Guilds&quot; that have no heart adn will just take over, SR would never do that neither would Enshadowed, we all want a better system and I see no one who really would like to be able to farm the planes or Dragons.<br>
<br>
We have no Army that would take over, Brell is the Army, the guilds are just Divisions of the larger force.<br>
<br>
People work together, its just the way things are, Enshadowed Claims to want to work only with itself but if you see their raids I doubt they exclude there friends.<br>
<br>
We have no &quot;loners&quot; that are high enough to be a problem and they will still have friends in the larger guilds who will have friends in other guilds who will have friends in other guilds which connects us as a Community.<br>
<br>
This is why we will not go FFA <p><font face="arial" size="1" color="orange">

Enshadowed has never said we want to only raid with ourselves.  We said &quot;We want to be ABLE to raid only by ourselves...&quot;.  IE, we don't want to HAVE to pick up a dipshit cleric because we are short on clerics.<br>
<br>
We always have friends / recruits / others on our raids.<br>

This isn't the small, closely knit server it once was, where I can name everyone old enough to raid. Like it or not, we ARE like most other servers now. The only difference is that our status quo was different when we were a smaller server, so we have that remnant to remind us compromise is possible. But eventually, a new compromise must be reached. Otherwise, I lack the faith you do that we won't slide into an FFA situation.  <p><A HREF="http://sr.amiga.tm/" TARGET="_new"><IMG ALT="Silent Redemption Member" BORDER=0 SRC="http://home1.gte.net/res007bh/ThoricPSD3_copy.gif"></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usoulbite.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Soulbite</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.geocities.com/mariekythe/felixicon.gif width=20 height=20 BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 71<br> <font color=#CC9900>(1/19/01 6:21:48 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/pwp_otter/soulnew.jpg width=204 height=354></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Reason why WE are not gonna go FFA.</span><hr size=1> Sorry Andadas, thought you meant you would olnly raid wiht yourself on your board post about the guild.<br>
<br>
Thoric, I think the FFA will be a total mess with the current situation and I know most of the nicer original people would go with the old system.<br>
<br>
We have quiet a few of the old july 22nd people here still and they are quite influential people. I saw Miyke a few days ago and talked with him about it and he seems to believe the same thing as me.<br>
<br>
Some of the older people are coming back from time to time to check in and I think they could revive he old ways. <br>
<br>
I agree that things arnt looking great but I still doubt we will resort to FFA.<br>
<br>
And no I am not just some new person coming to brell, believe it or not Ive been heere for a bit over a year. <p><font face="arial" size="1" color="orange">

Llanos is in favor of it.  Qualtar kinda says he wants it, or at least thinks he'll benefit from it somehow.  While these people's opinions may not represent the overall views of their guilds (ET and BI respectively), the supporters for it are there.<br>
<br>
I personally think that if FFA did erupt, these people would be kicking themselves for ever supporting it in the first place.  But I cannot predict the future or pretend to know others' reactions to unknown events.  So that's just an opinion of mine.<br>
<br>
I think a FFA situation would eventually cool down and become more self moderated, with the major guilds coming to some pseudo agreement on how to share things.  But that's basically how this scheduling system started in the first place.  <br>
<br>
I try to avoid analogies, but a FFA would be similar to a war.  The fighting would only last a short while probably.  But it's the aftermath that scares me.  The destruction of everything the Brell community has worked so had to build and maintain.  Not just the scheduling systems, but the trust that the larger guilds have in each other.  Sure, some members have differences with each other, but generally most guilds on this server are more than willing to help another guild if the need arises.  All of that would go up in smoke if the war happens.  We'd be starting from scratch.<br>

This server has actually given a bad name to it equating it to such things as KS'n... which I am not in favor of.<br>
<br>
As dear friend of mine (Jondin) wrote on the BI message board, one of the best times of his ever was a day when he logged online and had no idea what his plans were that day, he ended up killing a dragon by the end of the day and expressed it was the funnest thing he had ever done in game.<br>
<br>
Thats what I favor... the ability to log on and head anywhere you want without the worry of soanso guild has that mob &quot;reserved&quot; as you stand there staring at it.  The game was not designed like that, and we deprive all of ourselves good gaming opportunities because of these rules.<br>
<br>
Everyone talks about how great each other is on the server, but they obviously don't trust each other as far as they can see or we wouldn't have these rules.  (I am sure that paragraph will get quoted and flamed a few times <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
Instead of having reservation list, we could have &quot;killed&quot; list that guilds would state when they killed a mob, to be used as reference in the event of a dispute.  Those that are obviously getting repeated chances at a mob would give way to others that wanted a shot at the particular mob.  I see Danni doing that quite often now with Woushi in the Wakening.  She has single handed led many raids on that dragon and people began to make a swell about it, so she cordially stepped back a few weeks to allow other the opportunity... when the mob stood without being killed for a few weeks, she reposted stating her intent to not waste the mob.<br>
<br>
These same type of negotiations we do here could be handled in game fairly... with the same compromise we have here... and geee...thats the &quot;vision&quot;  OMG!!  I said another bad word, forgive me!<br>
<br>
FFA to me does not mean KS time...   That should be clear <p>Qualtar Shylok --

<br>
Fair enough.  I can see the distinction between the two.  I kinda think that FFA would lead to kill stealing, but it does not necessarily have to, if all the parties involved have a mutual respect for each other.  And that mutual respect would probably take the form of in-game communications, as you pointed out:<br>
<br>
&quot;Instead of having reservation list, we could have &quot;killed&quot; list...&quot;<br>
<br>
But don't you think this would lead to a general system of things?  As more guilds get added, and more people want to do the same thing, communication and organization of everyone involved would get much more complex to handle in-game.  So what would be the problem with taking those communications to an outside source that is more appropriate to handle it...such as these boards?  Then you're back to where we are now.<br>
<br>
It just seems that Brell, as a whole (please remember that part), prefers a lawful order to the sharing of mobs on our server.  Does this take some of the spontaneity out of the game?  Yes, of course, which is kinda sad.  And I'm all for logical ideas on how to improve that, without risking the benefits of what these boards have created; a place where anyone can get a shot at almost anything.<br>
<br>
I hope I have fully understood your points as well as you've understood mine.  If I have misunderstood something you've said, or took it out of context, then please correct me.  I would like this to stay civil and not degenerate into flames, because I'm not mad at anyone here.  And I hope you don't get mad at me.  I'm just trying to discuss.<br>

I'm not pessimistic yet, but....<br>
<br>
1) In general, people are self-interested.<br>
<br>
2) In general, people chafe under excessive restrictions. But at the same time, they complain about lawlessness and anarchy.<br>
<br>
3) In general, the strong will dominate the weak.<br>
<br>
4) In general, the weak don't usually band together to tell the strong to behave themselves.<br>
<br>
What I'm saying is...I don't think FFA will be here tomorrow, or next month....but the old-timers who &quot;settled&quot; Brell and worked out today's systems are disappearing. There is a new generation that feels like they've had the shaft (whether true or not) and are chafing under today's rules.<br>
<br>
I'm not in favor of FFA...I'm one of those folks who'd rather have a complicated reservation system and wait his turn rather than find the big, important mobs getting camped or guild wars starting over who has killed CT or Inny or Trak the last 10 times. If we go FFA, there will be guild wars. Maybe that isn't so bad since it would force many of the small guilds to unite, merge, or simply be more self-assertive. But, I have to think that anything that creates more rancor is a bad thing for a community.<br>
<br>
Guess I'm rambling. I'm just concerned that we're rolling towards FFA or that some of the &quot;up and coming&quot; guilds may decide not to play by the rules. For now, that can be controlled. But, can it be forever? Or how would we do that? Should we do that? Who gives us the right if we do? Just too many dangerous questions...<br>

While a FFA on this server is more probable than communism emerging in america was, I sitll think that some type of order, regardless of who set it up, would be present. If you look at other servers that are FFA, its not random chaos and venemous hatred between guilds, at least from what I've seen. I read a thread in which members of some big guild on eci (it has the word shadows in it somewhere) was disbanded because they KSed other people too much from big dragons. Yes it is FFA on that server, but when dastardly deeds are done, people just dont stay quiet and let it happen, there is still an order to things. Everyone must realize that with every agreement someone somewhere is not going to be totlly happy, but we need to find a solution where everyone can reach at least some level of satisfaction from it all. Basically, I don't think going FFA should be an issue, because if it does happen, order will come into play. I think we should focus on continually revising our systems so that they are up to date with the current issues being brought to hand. And I like how Qualtar put it about FFA not meaning all out chaos.<br>

<br>
problem with the system we run on now, is that we need to reserve raids on mobs 6 months in advance of the raid, reason for this is partly because 50 indy´s signing up on every list they posibly can. we should of course let indy´s have a spot on lists, but when guilds needs to make twinks to put on the list to get a spot more in, on those 6 months its wrong.<br>
<br>
if server was ffa, the guilds powerfull enough to take the VS(or other) spawns alone(or with few allies) would get the spawn. if they liked the reservations a bit, they would talk about it and share spawns.(or get KSed and KS few times. but that wouldnt lead em in the long run anywhere, so they would probably settle with a alliance.)<br>
<br>
Do i sound like i want ffa now?<br>
<br>
i dont. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
FFA would solve alot of problems most of the ones we are discussing here about spawns but it would also cause some new problems as well, so i guess you can say i do favor ffa to some degree, but there is a big down side to it.<br>
fighting over mobs isnt fun, racing a raid anywhere isnt fun.<br>
<br>
and imo firegiants, being a one group camp, should not be reservable, they should have a forum called intentions, but anything one group can kill in 30 mins, thats in the way of other mobs, shouldnt be reservable. <br>
<br>
<br>
Total FFA no, but a makeover of the system wouldnt hurt <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

FFA for anyone else.  Well you better start sucking the ass of every uber guild on the server, because you have ZERO chance of getting anything.<br>
<br>
FFA = A world without laws or rules.  That folks is inevitable chaos.<br>

Why is it so hard for people to grasp the simple concept of get in line and WAIT YOUR TURN!<br>
<br>
It absolutely cannot be allowed.  It would turn Brell Serilis, a server that I am so very proud to be a part of, into a worthless pos.  And I'll fight that with my every being.<br>

actually there are no rules<br>

Rules imply some justise, and some form of policing, neither of those being present, we are actually working in a FFA system with common courtesy shown to our fellow. <p><img src="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Keep/6130/greenhead.gif" height=225 width=225>

<br>
Personally, I think a lot of disagreements about FFA would be resolved if we took week long dragon spawns off the &quot;reservable by anyone&quot; list. Make it so that only guilds, and not Indies can reserve the dragons.<br>
<br>
Does it screw indy's? No.. they can join other people's raids.  I'm an indy right now myself, and I don't feel that it's unjust.  Doubtless, there will be some who think it's unfair, but that is where we can have a vote, and perhaps satisify the majority of the people on the server.<br>

Raids rarely overlapped, there was no intentions board, and the reservation period was two weeks.i.e you could only post two weeks in advance, if you posted earlier, the moderator would delete it.The biggest furor was loot ditribution back then, as everyone had a differing way of doing it, the &quot;last piece&quot; rule had just come into effect(although some still dont do that) and so the only decision the average joe had to make is: where do I wanna go? when is a raid on? do I agree with the loot system.If he was not inspired on what he saw, off he went to karnors or chardok and got in on a mini raid, did a bit of soloing somewhere or wotnot.<br>
 Now we have reservations, intentions to reserve, more zones/mobs added to the list, and really, just barely organized chaos.The average joe has to think about the following in addition to what he did before: ok where can I go, is it reserved/has intentions posted? can I get a pick up group if it isnt, is that mob reserveable or not?He has alot more to worry about, and if by some chance he misses one of the gazillion posts about raiding reserving, doubtless he will end up stepping on someones toes who will flame him in righteous fury!<br>
Get rid of all this new garbage! if I want to go on a major raid, all I used to have to do is click on one link,see what was going on and when, by who and then sign up.If nothing i liked was on, then off I could go in full confidence that I could go and try getting in on something I wanted to do somewhere, or organized it on the spot.<br>
Sometimes less is a whole lot more.<br>

FFA could work also but would be abit more dificult.<br>
