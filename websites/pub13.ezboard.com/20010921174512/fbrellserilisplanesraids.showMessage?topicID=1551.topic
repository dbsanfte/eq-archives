<br>
More and more people screaming for FCFS, FFA or anything else that we could describe as 'the faster I get my loot, the better'<br>
<br>
I guess some people are sick of waiting for their turn to grab such or such uberloot they need, I'm sooooo sad for you.<br>
<br>
&quot;I need ragefire for my epic, let's forget the dumb bastard who reserved the FG, and go for it&quot;<br>

&quot;VS list is too long, let's force a FFA on it and take what we want&quot;<br>
...<br>
<br>
Do what you want, think what you want ...<br>
Maybe you trust a FFA system to be better that we have, ok take a discussion over it, force a vote, change the rules.<br>
<br>
Maybe you think that our system is a dumb and inadequate one, try to convince the others who like it or did it.<br>
<br>
*** BUT ***<br>
<br>
As long as anything is reservable, keep your greed and dont state (or do) things like :<br>
&quot;On that, as an INDIVIDUAL I wont recognise fg reservations regardless of which way the vote falls and will just kill them whenever I feel like.&quot;<br>
(random sentence, sorry for the one who wrote it - I just took the first one I found).<br>
<br>
If you ignore the rules of our server and try to spoil it with your selfish needs (whether selfish includes you, your family, your friends, your guild or all the lvl 57 clerics playing from alaska), well I as an individual will be really pissed about it.<br>

It is so hard to understand that you aren't alone in a multiplayer game ?<br>

It's a different way of doing things.  Greed is up to the individuals.  People reserve things out of greed also.  You can't say &quot;My side is good, and your side is evil &amp; greedy.&quot;  Do you chide the people in Sebilis for greed?  It's not reserved after all.  It's whoever's there first gets the spawn.  Why no rants on all the greedy people in Seb?<br>
<br>
If you want, I can associate reservations, &amp; rotation lists with communism, and FCFS with a bright, good, U.S.A. free market spirit.<br>
<br>
But really, bringing greed into the picture does little to support your position, it's just rhetoric.<br>
<br>
Vidril, you may feel that reservations are the way to go.  Some people do.  Some people don't, but will abide by the vote of the people.  Some people don't, and will refuse to pay any attention to the vote.<br>
<br>
Here's the bottom line.  Verant does not support rotation lists, or reservations.  You can tell Joe FFA that he's not allowed to kill FG's because they're reserved.  That doesn't mean it's going to do anything to stop him.  It doesn't mean he's forced to respect your reservation.  In EQ, people (even a majority) cannot dictate how people must do their raiding, unless it violated Verant customer support policies.<br>
<br>
If the people on Brell can come up with something BETTER than FCFS, they're welcome to do that, provided that everyone is willing to participate in it.  If everyone is NOT, then you can't dictate that people must abide by your system.<br>
<br>
I think taking turns is a good way to share.  I think our rotation system is a pretty poor way to share.<br>
1-The rotation system treats guilds, &amp; independents the same way.<br>
2-Small guilds &amp; large guilds have the same rights, regardless of size.<br>
3-Guilds that fail something over &amp; over are allowed the same rights as a guild that always succeeds.<br>
4-There is no reward, or incentive to kill a mob faster, so that the next group has their turn faster.<br>
5-Effort is not rewarded.  Anyone can sign up &amp; wait their turn.  Mediocrity is rewarded.  Incompetents CAN succeed, or at least waste everyone else's time.<br>
<br>
I think having a calendar so you know when you get a plane is a good ware to share.  The calendar we have has several problems.<br>
1-Independents, &amp; guilds are treated the same way.<br>
2-Small guilds &amp; large guilds have the same rights, regarless of size.<br>
3-Guilds that fail something over &amp; over are allowed the same rights as a guild that always succeeds.<br>
4-There is no reward, or incentive to kill a mob faster, so that the next group has their turn faster.<br>
5-Effort is not rewarded.  Anyone can sign up &amp; wait their turn.  Mediocrity is rewarded.  Incompetents CAN succeed, or at least waste everyone else's time.<br>
6-There are more guilds in the system than there are planar dates.<br>
7-The system works very poorly for those off the North American time zones.<br>
8-You have a very difficult time getting a planar date unless you post right away.<br>
9-The winner of a date is chosen not on merit, not on need, not on past succeess, not on the people they represent, but by the accuracy of their clock, when compared to the board time, and the lack of delay when they hit the Add Post button.<br>
10-The system does not encourage people to work together so the plane can be used more.  Instead, you basically have a 24 hour period with mobs that spawn in 12-14 hours, and flame anyone that intrudes on your sacred time turf.<br>
<br>
There's obviously flaws with our systems.  In some cases, what we have is better than FFA.  In some cases, it might not be.  Greed exists everywhere.  Inflexibility in the systems we have will lead to FFA.  No matter how good our systems may be, we cannot force anyone to be a part of them.  All that is enforcable is the PnP.  People must share spawns.  If they refuse to, GM's will enforce it.  You can't Killsteal.  You can't train people.  You can't harass people.<br>
<br>
Beyond that, what you do in the game is up to you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uvidril.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vidril</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/19/01 12:57:17 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Greed</span><hr size=1> My personnal thought is that the call for FFA is motivated by greed before anything else, but it's only what I think and noone has to care about my feelings on that.<br>
<br>
<br>
The thing that upset me sits in the second part of my post - it's about people that don't want to be abide by the rules they don't like.<br>
<br>
I sure know those rules aren't VI official ones. And that we can't enforce them by any 'official' ways.<br>
<br>
But what about being honest. If some of those rules don't suit someone because he doesn't want to respect the 'first post after 00:00 gets PoH' part, well why does he keep the rest of the rules.<br>
<br>
Either you follow the self-constructed rules of that server (whatever you may think or want about them), or you say 'no' to the full set of rules and go on your own.<br>
<br>
If enough people choose anarchy over the current situation, well let's anarchy happen. <br>
<br>
But it's much too easy to claim that you have the right to ignore the one rule that is on your way - and ask that the others are to be respected.<br>
<br>
(not sure if my post make sense, but well if someone understands me and feel like explaining it in english, feel free too)<br>
<br>
--- <br>
<br>
and adun<br>
rotation, well ok doesnt work as good as it could, too much greed in here for anything to work anyway.<br>
Ive seen countless post of 'A is abusing it someway or another, so it's ok if I do it too'... looks like a complete failure to me when people who have nothing to win at VS says something like that. (what drops VS anyway ? crappy leggings and a stone I could use for my epic if I werent so digusted about all that VS situation).<br>
<br>
Plane reservation, well looks quite good to me.<br>
Just as an answer about your points : <br>
1) and 6) are the main raison to all the problems that arise - but I guess you can't help it til people notice they can raid something different (go to Velious people, there's quite a nice zone to raid there).<br>
ah and 7) I'm french in case you didnt know and I consider that this game is mostly FOR north-americaner. Do you know when the normal average raid starts for me ? -&gt; between midnight and 3am. <br>
Now if I have some advantage in reserving fear I wont complain - anyway it will be empty 'cause previous raid lasted 4 more hours than expected... so...<br>
<br>
Well I dont want to look agressive or something, and I dont hold the final answer to all this. I'm not saying our system of rules is perfect.<br>
<br>
I'm just saying that if you can't respect a simple set of rules that affect 5% of the zones, because they dont suit you anymore - maybe you shoud unplug your modem and play another game where none of those pesky 'other players' are here to ruin your fun.<br>
<br>
see you soon (grr server down again, guess i wont play today again).<br>

I wasted Tuesday night in chat waiting for the servers to come up.  And again.  And again.<br>
<br>
&quot;But what about being honest. If some of those rules don't suit someone because he doesn't want to respect the 'first post after 00:00 gets PoH' part, well why does he keep the rest of the rules.<br>
<br>
Either you follow the self-constructed rules of that server (whatever you may think or want about them), or you say 'no' to the full set of rules and go on your own.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'll have to disagree with you.  If my government was to pass a law forbidding me to, hrm, worship as I chose, I would refuse to obey that law.  That doesn't mean I'd go out &amp; start stealing, &amp; breaking all laws.<br>
<br>
Currently, I feel FG reservations from people 50+ are unreasonable.  I also feel that the VS list (what, 50 names??) is also unreasonable.  Now personally, I don't have the balls to just ignore them.  I'm not interested in dealing with the backlash.  I can however understand the perspective of, &quot;These rules are out of date, &amp; unreasonable.  I am excercising my rights as a player under VI's rules.  I will not acknowledge these reservations as valid.&quot;<br>
<br>
Because I feel the FG reservations are out of date, &amp; need doesn't mean I feel that planar reservations should be ignored either.  Sure, planar reservations are far from perfect, but I think it has more advantages than FFA in the planes at this point.<br>
<br>
I honestly believe that if people outright refuse to change FG reservations in some way, enough people will say, &quot;I will not honor FG reservations,&quot; and they will fall apart anyways.<br>
<br>
I think appropriate compromises are as such: L50+ players cannot reserve FG's.  To reserve FG's, you must have at least 15 people under 50 on your raid.  Ragefire has precedence over a scheduled FG raid.  A group may clear the FG's in order to get to Ragefire for an epic.<br>
would be appropriate.  However, at this point, it's an all or nothing deal.<br>
<br>

FCFS is not greedy to me. In fact, even today, there are more areas, monsters, UBER monsters that ARE FCFS even under our system. <br>

It is very doubtful to me that we will be adding any more new &quot;reservable&quot; areas to the calendar. In fact, we might end up losing some simply because it makes no sense to keep them now that the demographics of the server have changed.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukulanaesoulsease.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kulanae Soulsease</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 315<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/19/01 5:54:26 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.wwa.com/~danas/Kulanae4.jpg height=158 width=119></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Greed</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Worked some 220 years ago.

<br>
It is natural for the hotheads (guilty on occaision) to jump in and tear apart a notion early and harshly.<br>
<br>
Also, as well documented, this forum doesn't exaclty constitute a wide open body... just a very small, very biased body.<br>
<br>
Adun (or really anyones) idea was doomed to be attacked with extreme prejudice the moment it hit text... valid, fair, or not... happens a lot here.<br>
<br>
That also doesn't mean some people wouldn't have gone along with it.<br>
<br>
To be honest, FG's were the perfect test case for Adun's idea.<br>
<br>
1) the level range they're &quot;appropriate&quot; for is very small portion of the &quot;raiding circuit&quot;<br>
<br>
2) the &quot;appropriate&quot; people dont raid them that often, and when they do... they bring a big raid.<br>
<br>
3) it was very clear that most folks weren't content with how things worked with them...<br>
<br>
That said... Adun's idea has flaws... it's still easily exploitable... how many 60's have upper 40's twinks that can &quot;reserve&quot; the area... and then have their 60's group do it?  There is (as with all reservations) absolutley nothing that can be done to enforce the system when exploiters willingly and obviously exploit it.<br>
