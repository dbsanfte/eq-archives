I cannot atone for the betrayle I am sure many of you feel, the animosity, however seething, that you feel for me MUST be justified, and I feel that I am the only living being able to do just that. So, before the necessary precedings begin, I only  ask that you give me 10 minutes. 10 minutes, and then my fate is in your hands. What say you?&quot;<br>
<br>
The crowd, normally apathetic in cases of a public hanging, moans a hearty affirmation to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then, I shall begin...&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
 Abroxious Drathson was a poor man, on all  accounts, save one, his wife. His love for her never once dimished through all they had been through, the good, the bad, and on more than one occasion, the ugly. It was on the eve of their first and only son's birth that he confesed this to her, and shortly thereafter they fell asleep in a lovers embrace that was picturesqe as well as much as it was beautiful.  Had either of them known it would be their last, they would have savored it even moreso.   <br>
<br>
<br>
Abroxious awoke to the sound of wretching, and low, deep moans.  Normally a sound sleeper, he was up and to his feet in a matter of seconds. His loving wife, Salana, was with child, and something was  wrong  here. Something was very wrong here. They were a good 2 hours walk from the  nearest health center, but a cleric lived 15 minutes or so down the path through the woods. That would have to do.  The baby wasnt  due for another month, and a  permature birth wasnt something either had  planned for. As the saying goes, the plan sometimes has plans of it's own.   He gathered the necessities, and he and his already hemmoraging wife began the last walk the two of them would ever take.<br>
<br>
Silar and Phalonious were not bad people by nature, reguardless of public opinion. That night, they had been celebrating the forthcoming glorious union of Phalonious and his wonderful fionce Osmosis at the old Taverne hidden amongst the underbrush and beauty of the forrest that ran outlining Butcherblock Mountains. It was late. Very late in fact, and the two of them, singing their drunken  party songs, and enjoying their last few waking breaths did a little more than startle Abroxious Drathson and his barely conscous wife as they hurriedly made their way toward them in the dim moonlight. &quot;Just what we need now, honey, Bandits!!&quot;, Abroxious muttered to his failing wife as he led her to the safety of an old glorious oak that had overturned.  Drawing his saber to protect his wife, he met Silar and Phalonious, who were quite surpised, with a less than amiable greeting and a warning to stand clear of him and begone at this moment, or suffer the consequences. Neither Silar nor  Phalonious were the type to avoid a duel, especially in their currently drunken state. Silar drew first, and although a skilled rogue, couldnt seem to withdraw his saber from its sheath in time. A fatal lunge by Abroxious, and Silar went to the ground. Phalonious however, was a more hardened veteran of these matters, and his hands had already done their deed. <br>
<br>
<br>
Traveling quickly and as quietly as possible, Utlabin and Tinala made their way to the docks.  It was still night, but soon the dim moonlight would be replaced with bright sunlight, something they desperately needed to avoid. They were dark elves you see, and the general consensus of the dwarves of kaladim, when it came to dark elves, was to kill first, and ask questions later.  They came upon an odd sight, indeed. The apparant epic battle, as it were, of a grown wood elf male, and two dwarven young men.  One dwarf already slain, it appeared as though the other had the better of the wood elf. They eased behind the confines of a nearby tree, and watched intently.<br>
<br>
<br>
No one really  knows for sure if Abroxious realized what he had done at the last second, or not.  For whatever reason, after slaying one of the bandits that he had happened  upon, and nearly being slain himself by the other,  he  hesitated.  There was an audible &quot;swoosh&quot; as Phalonious brought down his battle axe  upon Abroxious. In a fleeting second, Abroxious upturned his saber, and thrust it into the  heart of Phalonious, where he fell dead.<br>
<br>
So there they were, Utlabin, and Tinala. 3 corpses in front of them, with not so  much as to a clue what had happened to these people, who were SUPPOSED to be friendly with each other.  As they started to finalize their journey to the docks, they heard a the wimper and subsequential crying of a newborn. Looking into the trees, they found yet another corpse. The corpse of a wood elven  woman, and her newborn child, writhing and lying on the ground.<br>
<br>
Tinala had always wanted children. Utlabin  had forbid it, based on the fact that dark elf children had no future in this world, already seething with hate and predjudice. But, on that Wednesday morning, he really had no choice.  They scooped up the babe and made their way to the docks. Later on that day, as he was cursing himself for doing so, knowing that the babe would have surely died, either by lack of nourishment, or by wolves, he reminded himself that taking a newborn wood elven child into neriak would be a mistake. Mayhap the last mistake he ever made.<br>
<br>
So, they set up a  new  homefront in West Commons. They had always been vagabonds, to an extent, and this little addition to their family might prove to be worth something at a later date. Tinala stayed with &quot;their&quot; child, named Cyphex,  while Utlabin did his work. A smith by trade, Utlabin also was a proficient butcher, and hunter as well.  <br>
<br>
They did well, and for many years, there was little problem. A baby can be kept secret, if you work at it. A  toddler also. Past that though, there's really no hiding one, even in the territories of the commons. There are simply too many people coming and going at any given time of day to do so. This is where the majority of the  races of Norrath come to buy, sell, and trade their goods, and people are used to seeing people of all kinds here. A wood elven child with dark elven elders isnt necessarily that much of an oddity. Except to other dark elves.  The questions began arising around the time Cyphex was 14, and only got worse. They had been good parents to Cyphex, no one who knew them could attest that, but certain things just werent permissable, even beyond the realm of Neriak.  One morning Utlabin awoke to a fire outside his home, started by dark elven outcasts. They had fashioned together a life size wood elven doll, and set it afire. A warning to him and his wife. Something to think about indeed.<br>
<br>
The next night, the unthinkable happened...<br>
