It was a clear night over the dusty old port town, the sky adorned with a pale-shining moon which cast over me a halo of argent light, setting my skin in silver.<br>
<br>
Duty had summoned me to the city of men: my Mistress demanded a human life this night.  But for a time I stood quietly before the silent sleeping town and tasted the glory of the night, it's soft illumination bringing beauty to an otherwise decomposing landscape.  The ragged tents and dilapidated carts which littered the outskirts of the Free Port turned spectral and timeless under the hex of lunar light.  And under the city I could feel the seething fury of the Dismal Rage, those mortal men and women who bow down to the Prince of Hate.  While I find their beliefs distasteful, their songs' beauty belies the Hatred they serve.  They were wolves howling under a savage moon, and if my heart was not bound to another, I might have joined them that night, so ferociously did the night sky call to me.<br>
<br>
The sound of bone shards scattered in dust, like insects scuttling through broken stonework.  My servant came to me under that pale light, blackened bones and eyes of vermillion flame searing the bewitching spell of midnight.<br>
<br>
&quot;Stay close.  Be not far from me.&quot; I whispered into the sweet darkness.<br>
<br>
&quot;With my very being I hear ye and obey, master,&quot; came the hissed response.<br>
<br>
The man I had come to meet, to greet, to strike down, was a night watchman to the gates of Freeport.  A corrupt man bound and shackled to the Father of the Teir'Dal by bribes and lies, I felt no remorse in the task which lay before me. So engrossed in my work, I never felt the kindred heart beating close by, hidden in the shadowed corner of a city wall.<br>
<br>
&quot;Cephian Topplo, I have been called by my mistress to bring ye low.&quot;  My fingers wove the darkness thick and binding around his legs, his arms, his eyes.  So bound by shadows his strides faltered as he rose his militia blade against me. I smiled slightly, and before him my will rose up against him, wings unfurled and eyes mad with slaughter.<br>
<br>
&quot;See the rising dark in which your shadowed soul shall go and fear me, mortal man.&quot;<br>
<br>
His eyes grew wide and wild; his blade dropped from his numbed hands.  He turned to flee from the terrors I had forced into his foul mind.<br>
<br>
&quot;Spirit Guardian.  Take him, and spare no assault.&quot;<br>
<br>
Had darkness not bound his throat tightly, all of the human city would have heard his cries that night as the old bones beset his mortal frame.  He fell silently before the hands of my servant.  My work was finished in the city of men.  I turned to go.<br>
<br>
Turning about I saw before me a teir'dal woman garbed in robes of pale blue silk, bound in golden embroidery. Her stark white hair framed a face of timeless beauty, which in turn framed eyes of endless cruelty.  Her smile was a twisted serpent upon her face, coiled and vicious.  She was an elite of the teir'dal and a chosen noble from the Lodge of the Dead, my former temple and initial place of learning.<br>
<br>
And when she spoke, it was the sound of soft-falling rain, which prophesied a thunderstorm.<br>
<br>
&quot;Destain, your name is famous in the Lodge of the Dead.  They say you are mad with the potency of the necromantic arts, and best exterminated for your sacriligious faith.  But they, for all their art and cunning, could not find you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;you did not seem to have any difficulty finding me, mistress,&quot; I responded quietly, silently calling to my mind the words of poison with which I could plague her young veins should she strike out against me.<br>
<br>
&quot;Under such a night, and so close to a temple of the Father, how could I have any difficulty?&quot;  she smirked back at me, her youth captivating and strangely unbefitting her spirit.  She felt old to me somehow.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have searched in the Library of Neriak for the word and means by which to call forth the greatest strengths of our art, but the Lodge of the Dead preserves its secrets out of jealousy.  I searched you out initially to stike you down.  Seeing you now I know I cannot.  The rewards the Lodge would bestow upon me are not worth the risk, regardless.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Pray sister, what would ye ask of me then?&quot;  I responded in teir'dal.  She smiled again.<br>
<br>
&quot;I search for the ethereal words which make a living soul turn cold, make the body old, turn the flesh to bone.  I wish above all the title of Lich..&quot;  her words trailed off as in my mind I called forth the incantation.<br>
<br>
&quot;My Walker of the Violet Twilight, show me what it is to die...,&quot;  I sighed to the night, and before her my flesh dissolved away from my very bones.  Under the light of that savage moon I stood before her, bones bared and glistening like polished stone, my eyes twin sparks of fire in cold sockets.  Her serpent smile froze on her face, her eyes widened.<br>
<br>
&quot;Protect me Father..&quot; she whispered.<br>
<br>
I reached into a pouch on my belt, and withdrew a soiled piece of paper upon which the formula for the process was enscribed.  My fleshless hand held it out to her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Take it child, and pray the Father protects you from it's knowledge.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her thin fingers drew it from my hand, and she smiled again.<br>
<br>
&quot;My name is Mizraene Olothaeres. I am known to the human world as Misery, to my teir'dal kin I am Mizry.  I will reach your strength, Great One...maybe even rival ye.&quot;<br>
<br>
She dispersed, a flock of ravens in the nighted sky.  I was alone.<br>
<br>
--Destain.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;This was a little tribute to the first time I met Mizry Deathfire =)&gt;<br>
