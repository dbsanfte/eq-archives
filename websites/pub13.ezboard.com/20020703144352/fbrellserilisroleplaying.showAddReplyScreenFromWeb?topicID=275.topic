align=left class=m><span class=title>   Running of the Gods</span><hr size=1> It was a cold bitter morning in the swamps of Innothule, as the weary and ragged ranger made his way to the south. He had been in a major battle the night before and was preparing to go once more to challenge Cazic Thule in his insidious plane of Fear. As he walked through the stale and stagnant waters he saw things, things that you always feel in the shadows. He paused.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Hello?&quot;, he said. No reply. He peered into the earie darkness that the swamps undead trees cause and swore that he had seen soemthing this time. That he wasnt hallucinating from the mushrooms he had foraged and eaten the night before. &quot;oh well, it must be nerves, I've got to get a vacation soon,&quot;. He began to head back south when a flash of brilliant color and dirty cloth shot past him at arms length. <br>
<br>
In an instant he had both his lamentation blades drawn and ready for the combat he assumed would further delay his journey to face Cazic. Then he realized the error of his vision.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Stupid Newbies,&quot; he retorted to the thought of soemthing serious happeneing from the passing of a newbie. He continued his walk and soon found himself at the cavernous entrance to his final destination.<br>
<br>
He cast Spirit of the Wolf on himself, sheathed his weapons and barrelled off down the dark cavern to his undeniable fate. He felt wind slicing through his hair before he realized what was upon him. A spectre and a few of its cohorts were right on his tail tryin to tear into his warm flesh with their instruments iof death. Floating green skulls began to plague him and almost caused him to loose sioght of his goal, but he suddenly was in the open.<br>
<br>
 &quot; The home stretch, aint nothin stoppin me now,&quot; he yelled to the messengers of death screamin up his backside. &quot; And that goes double for you too you undead bitch. He took a pot shot at the guardian of the gate as he plunged head first.<br>
<br>
He rose to his feet to the sickening feeling of his head being split open with a Wraithbone hammer, but he wasnt under attack.<br>
 &quot;Damnit, I'm never gonna get used to that damn teleport crap...I dont know how druids deal with that on a daily basis..,&quot; He rose to his feet softly cursing the druids as a whole for actually coping with this side effect of teleporting and began his run to the safe spot where he was to meet up with his bretheren to do Mortal combat with the gods.<br>
<br>
He knew he needed to be safe in this plane for he could take nothing here on his own. He began tryin to track his enemies to plot out a safe path but found nothing to go on. Wearily he proceeded on, gradually picking up signs that allowed him to track his brothers and sisters in combat. Only there was no combat, the plane was as quiet as death is to be imagined.Fow hours the groups fianlly amassed in Fear they prepared with magic and tactics on how to accomplish there goal, but still no enemies to track....something wasnt right here.<br>
<br>
Warriors and wizzards alike began to get antsy and soon a prayer was sent to the demi gods known as GM. The demi god blessed us with his presense and told us to fear not, for the enemies would be coming as soon as we were rdy, we grinned at the though of slaughter at our conveinence. And no sooner had the great GM spoken his words he vanished, leaving an odor that would have gagged even the most decayed of Kithicor Forest or any undead advisary for that matter. Later it was all explained to the ones of the group who didnt know, that all demi god GM's leave a putrid stench wherever they go only soem are worse than others.<br>
<br>
Lo and behold just as the GM had predicted the enemies popped up and an epic battle waged on. Monster after monster fell into congealing pools of their pown blood as did a few of the Norrathian brothers. Those that fell in combat were ressurected and brought back to the battlefield to help acheive the goal that was set. <br>
The battle waged for several hours before leaving only one more opponent for them alive in the zone.<br>
<br>
 &quot;MAXXBASHER!!!&quot; was the shout everyone heard. Then immediately he fell dead where he stood. All were aghast of the power which was just demonstrated. The brave group of warriors all cringed and considered fleeing or falling back to re asses the value of Cazics head. <br>
<br>
Suddenly a frenzied cry rose from the crowd, and then another. One solitary druid and ranger charged headlong into Cazics icy glare to avenge their fallen guild mate. This was the spark that was lacking to ignite the passion to kill the great Thule. Like a wave crashing onto the beach a united wall of all classes and races meshed into one awesome fighting force. The singing of steel as it cut through air, the sounds of magic filling the air, and dull thuds of connecting blows roared across the zone. It was like a shockwave of emotion that would forever live on in lore and folktells forever. Now not alot was acounted for in this epic battle so it cant be told what all happened in this fight that shook the heavens, but the ending was very discenable.<br>
<br>
The earthquake shock of Cazics body hitting the ground knocked all the valiant warriors to their knees. Some passed out due to total exhaust, others from the emotional drain. You could hear crying, cheering and even soem praying in the crowd. The sounds of the clerics trying to bring all their fallen comrades back from deaths door sounded like sweet music as it flowed life into the fallen and hope and happiness to the weary. <br>
<br>
In the end most went their own way and still tell their tell to this very day, others decided to take their experiences in that plane and try to conquor yet another god and tempt their fates. Our ranger was one who tempted the fates on many other occasions, succesfully, and to this day still resides in the wilderness of Norrath looking for the next big adventure to come his way. The adventure that will rival even the falling of Cazic.<br>
<br>
Hehe hope yall like this.. may be long but i thought it was good.. kind of an unnamed hero thing goin on. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
