<br>
Beneath the massive, arched ceilings of the lavishly furnished, richly decorated meeting chambers of his guildhall, the entire compliment of the Blade of Enric had gathered on this evening. The buzz of excited conversation filled the room as friends old and new greeted each other, chatting amongst themselves happily. The clink of glasses and mugs being filled and re-filled (and re-filled again) with fine brews by the many smiling servants who dashed madly about further added to the pleasant, party atmosphere. <br>
<br>
Today was indeed a very special day for all of Enric’s followers, and Gruggoth in particular was happier than he had been in a very long time. As was his vision, Enric’s word had continued to spread across the lands, and the Blade of Enric grew stronger with every passing week. Their numbers had grown steadily, though with a purposeful and selective slowness that would have made the Great Druid proud. These past few months, potential recruits had filled the guest wing of the guildhall with stories of their deeds and explanations of their deep desires to join Enric’s cause. The Council had grown especially selective as of late, and only perhaps one out of every five of these men and women was deemed ready for entering the guild as an Apprentice of Enric. <br>
<br>
This growth had led to increasing demands on the existing Council, who, numbering only six, found themselves stretched thin by the responsibilities of their respective positions. For them in particular, the entire last week had been an exciting experience, and tonight, finally, was its culmination. After days of nominations, followed by rounds of debating and, finally, a member-wide vote, the Council of Enric was here to open up it’s much anticipated Seventh Seat to one of it’s most devout Blades. The nomination process had singled out three shining members, each of whom was unquestionably devoted to the guild and it’s beliefs: Eoral Solis, Hudinni Highelven, and Taerma D’Estain. Friends and compatriots had enthusiastically backed each throughout the process, and the final voting process was extremely close, coming down to the final few votes. This was to be no landslide victory by any stretch of the imagination, further complimenting the depth and integrity of their great guild. <br>
<br>
“Quiet down, ye bastards!” Councilman Zandur Stoutbarrel shouted laughingly above the din, his stout dwarfish frame teetering ponderously and half-drunkenly atop the Council’s table at the head of the room. He knocked two steins together repeatedly to attract everyone’s attention, ale splashing sloppily out of each. “Gather round! Gather round, all! The great green one has some words for ye!” Good-natured laughter erupted at this friendly and oft-repeated term of endearment for guildmaster Gruggoth. <br>
<br>
Laughing uproariously as well, Lord Gruggoth stood slowly from his place at the head of the Council Table. For the occasion, he had forsaken his magical blades and finely crafted armor and instead donned a crimson and jade colored silken robe, which hung about his muscular, hulkish frame in a regal manner that to an outsider might have appeared unbefitting and almost comical, had they not known the stature of this particular troll. As he rose, his following quickly hushed to low excited murmurs, gathering more closely to stand in a tightly packed circle about the Council table. <br>
<br>
“Me fren’s,” Gruggoth slurred in the common tongue, a trollish grin still touching the corners of his huge maw. “Dis a mos’ special day indeed, fer all o’ uz. I won’t be awastin’ yer time by goin’ inta some long speech. Affer all, dis iz a time fer celebration, radder den dissertation!” <br>
<br>
Stepping away from his seat, the troll gestured in the direction of the three nominees, Eoral, Hudinni and Taerma. “Come forward, me fren’s.” As they stepped forward, applause erupted in the room, growing to a crescendo of hoots, hollers and cheers as the Blade of Enric showed their genuine appreciation for these valued adventurers. As the applause died down, the trio turned to face the troll, kneeling before him in unison. <br>
<br>
“Hudinni Highelven,” Gruggoth began as they rose, “though you haz been wit’ uz only a short time, yer deeds an’ stren’th o’ heart make us all mos’ proud. Ta be nominated fer th’ new seat on th’ Council iz no small feat, an’ one which showz th’ sincere appreciation o’ all th’ memmers o’ our fine guild.” Gruggoth smiled, nodding at the mage in obvious respect. <br>
<br>
“Taerma D’Estain,” he continued. “Me ol’ fren’, yer a mos’ lovely sight dis evenin’.” Appreciative, good-natured whistles echo Grug’s sentiment. Taerma blushed noticeably, lowering her head to look at a point somewhere between her feet. “But even more lovely iz yer heart an’ soul, kind paladin. Ye have served Enric’s memory az well az any, Taerma, an’ yer continued service ta us iz a blessin’ dat iz mos’ incomparable.” <br>
<br>
“Bot’ o’ youz iz memmerz held in th’ mos’ high esteem, by me, by th’ Council, an’ by all yer brudders an’ sisters gaddered here dis day. Bot’ a youz is more den worthy an’ capable o’ takin’ th’ seat.” He then turned slowly to the last of the three nominees, the brave paladin Eoral Solis. <br>
<br>
“But der iz only one seat available at dis time,” Gruggoth finishes, first sighing, then again breaking into a grin as his eyes meet those of Eoral’s. The guildmaster stood silent for a moment, watching as realization dawns on Eoral’s face. <br>
<br>
“M’lord, I…” Eoral stammered, falling again to one knee. “I cannot thank thee enough…” <br>
<br>
“Eoral, me brave knight.” Gruggoth positively beamed. “Tank me not, fer az ya know, Council, includin’ meself, cannot vote on such matterz. It iz th’ memmerz o’ th’ Blade o’ Enric dat ya owez yer tanks to, me fren’.” He gestured at the beaming faces surrounding them. “Tank dem, not wit’ only yer words, but wit’ yer actions an’ deeds o’ th’ future. Ya now holdz a position in which great good can be done.” The troll paused thoughtfully. “Fer all o’ uz gaddered here today, an’ indeed, fer all o’ Norrath itself.” <br>
<br>
That said, Gruggoth removed from a pocket in his robe a fine sueded bag, and loosened it’s drawstring. Reaching inside, he removed a familiar pin; a stylized “E” set in a fine wreath, the symbol of Enric which every member, from Apprentices up through Council, was required to proudly display on their person at all times. This one was fashioned of gold, and surrounded by a ring of emeralds; the coveted pin of the Council of Enric. Removing the silver member’s pin from Eoral’s chest, Gruggoth deftly and proudly pins the golden emblem onto his newest Council member. <br>
<br>
“Behold, fer we haz grown stronger still! Enric’s word spreadz like a wildfire t’rough th’ Karanaz in th’ heat o’ summer. Welcome, Eoral Solis, ta th’ Council o’ Enric! May ya serve hiz memory ta th’ best o’ yer ability.” <br>
<br>
Cheers erupted, and, as usual, much drinking and revelry followed throughout the night. <br>
