Don't take this as rant to CA<br>
<br>
CA reserved 24th , 25th , 26th for sky raid.<br>
Each raid would start from 4pm PST.<br>
I reserved 26th 5am PST for 1-4th isle after their reservation.<br>
Of course CA has priority, but i thought they would go over 4+ isle until my date<br>
and would cause no trouble.<br>
<br>
Today(25th) i logged in and noticed CA is on Djorn isle.<br>
I asked them what was their plan, and it was<br>
<br>
24th = clear isle1 and get key and camp<br>
25th = clear isle1 again and move up<br>
26th = moving up<br>
<br>
Sky is the only plane which is reservable for 3 days.<br>
I remember it is for &quot;FULL 1 to 8 isle&quot; raid.<br>
Because it can't be done in 1 day unless ppl have Necro with key already.<br>
<br>
I talked with CA raid leader and he told me this plan was usual for him, every raid he joined did same.<br>
So, probably there are more ppl who would/will do this.<br>
Reserving whole day for only 1 isle is nothing but waste.<br>
Sky is being perma camped plane like Fear Hate,<br>
We need to do something on this not to make dead time.<br>
If we allow ppl to reserve full 3 days without strong reason,<br>
it will be overcrowded especialy weekends.<br>
<br>

I posted my idea of rule under this sled.<br>

<br>
What about the guilds who are raiding Sky for the first time? Or under leadership who is not &quot;seasoned&quot; in a plane. They will (no doubt) go slower.<br>
<br>
In this case this is the first Sky raid I have led. Our guild can sport an average raid of roughly 53rd level. On this particular night, we got lucky, and added 2 60th levels to our ranks. <br>
<br>
It's not easy running the raid the first time. It's not really easy when mistakes are made that have to be cleaned up using the most precious resource we had (time).<br>
<br>
Several hours were lost trying to get forward motion regained. We wound up with problems, and difficulties that probably would not happen with a raid group who was more familiar with the plane.<br>
<br>
But it did. I am a huge advocate of not wasting something (liek dragons dying to a server reset), but if you stuff 60 people in the same zone and have all of them casting, fighting and jumping about, you will wind up with problems. <br>
<br>
It's bad enough when a guild goes after Vox, Nagafen, or Trak and you have the normal hunting parties in those dungeons, but to have 2 complete raids on the same zone? You are asking for problems. <br>
<br>
I believe this is true for Sky, Hate, and any other zone which (by MoB population) can sustain 2 complete raids, the zone just can't do it (particularly the pre-RoK zones).<br>
<br>
I must admit I was somewhat disappointed in that rather than asking how far we had made it, the assumption was made that we did not know some hidden rule about raiding Sky.<br>
<br>
I have been on several Sky raids, and each one hunted Isle 1 on their first port up night to gain keys, and usually camping, though occasionally they take Dojorn. <br>
<br>
The second night is ALSO a portup night, so Isle 1 is rehunted for keys, and the riad meets up either on Isle 1 or Dojorn's and moves from there.<br>
<br>
Tonight I was told I was wrong, and apparently so are the raid leaders from many of the other fine guilds on Brell. It kind of boggles the mind that so many people did not know about this Isle 1-4 in a night rule.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I opted for Thursday - Saturday HOPING another guild would take Sunday and Monday so that the plane WOULD get the most out of the long US holiday.<br>
<br>
Pardon what may sound like ranting, but this comes after a long drawn out series of problems that has plagued this raid, and it's now almost 3am here, and I am looking forward to logging in and having to find a few enchanters to help me finish as far as we can.  <p><img src="http://images.honesty.com/imagedata/h/224/17/32241726.jpg"><BR><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=1323">Valeer Shadowsbaine Reaver of the 52nd Season</A> <br>

It was not our intention to step on anyones toes, and to be quite frank, our plan was to be CAMPED on isle 4 or higher about 3 hours ago.  We were wiped out on isle 3.  Did we do it on purpose?  No, I should say not!!  Who likes an expensive corpse recovery?<br>
<br>
There are several reasons why we were not on island 4 when you logged in Roatus.  One of those reasons was a group of folks sending tells to our raid leader arguing with him for a half an hour with him indicating that they had every intention of coming up and clearing as far as they could tomorrow...during our scheduled raid time.<br>
<br>
I do not take your post as a rant against CA.  But I will say that what you are suggesting makes it difficult for any guild to LEARN the plane, the way the higher level guilds have done before us.  One day, we and other guilds will be able to clear Sky the way you outline it to be.  Today, we proved we can't.  <br>
<br>
We don't want anything wasted any more than you do.  And we fully well intend on jumping down tomorrow when our raid reservation time has ended, regardless of what island we get to.  We are thrilled for the chance to try what others before us have succeeded in doing.<br>
<br>
Perhaps, had we been gifted with the ability to see into the future, and know what would happen, we would not have reserved these days.  I can't do that though, can you?  Hours and hours and hours of planning went into this raid.  We've almost exhausted our guild raid fun putting this raid on, and dealing with the CR that we did not expect.  Our team was psyched for success.  30 people appear impressed enough with this effort that they are willing to stick with us tomorrow (again, our scheduled day) to recover our separated companions, and continue on as we planned to do, despite mistakes made and unforseen issues arrisen.  Despite a VERY long corpse recovery, involving the reporting up of the entire raid party, Morale seems pretty high.<br>
<br>
If the rules are changed, we will, of course, abide by them.  But the 24th, 25th and 26 are our scheduled days to be in the plane.  NOT to take away from the rest of the server.  But to do something that The Combine Alliance fully believes it can do, and has never done before.<br>
<br>
I hope the older raiders can understand how proud that makes us feel.  It was very disheartening to watch Sundays raiders inform our raid leader that they were coming up Saturday...on our day.<br>
<br>
This is also not a rant, but as it is a discussion, I can only offer my opinion of your suggestion from a personal standpoint.  I cannot believe that there are not other guilds out there that would feel the same way. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uroatusbh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RoatusBH</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 129<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/26/01 1:38:29 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Sky rule need to be changed with strong guide line</span><hr size=1> Any kind or practice/learning is needed. I know that, i did that.<br>
What i want to say is, 3 days reservation is not for practice.<br>
And most of ppl don't know that.<br>
That's why i think we need to mention it on board.<br>
<br>
This time you reserved 1st day only for 1st isle camp<br>
where mobs are 4hours spawn and keys are sold by vendor.<br>
If you knew more about this plane you wouldn't do this.<br>
Why did you reserve full 3days?<br>
Because other guild(ex Abyss) are reserving 3days. And it is allowed to reserve 3 days by rule.<br>
You saw it and tried to do same.<br>
But abyss can do upto 7th isle, you were new to sky.<br>
This difference is the problem.<br>
Whether intentional or not, what you did is, same as reserving PoF triple days straight.<br>
You stayed up on 1st isle those 3days and 2-7th isles were wasted whole this weekend.<br>
3days reservation is for &quot;different isle&quot; raids on each days.<br>
<br>
You didn't know, and you made mistake this time.<br>
Many ppl don't know, and they will make mistake in future as you did.<br>
So, let's inform ppl so that they can know before they raid.<br>
This is what i am talking in this post.<br>
<br>
I lived in Brell long time, i have been to sky since this zone was added in game.<br>
Saw many failures. Everyone(include myself) died and failed SAME way.<br>
<br>
If raiders are new to sky, i am sure they will fail 99% because sky is very tricky.<br>
If they are new to sky, i am sure they will stuck on 1-2 isles first time.<br>
<br>
If ppl are new to sky, let them try only one day first time.<br>
If they fail, let them reserve another day and retry.<br>
If they succeed, let them reserve 2days for higher isle for more challange.<br>
This is ideal reservation form of multiple days.<br>
<br>
I will edit Sky reservation rule and will post here.<br>
And you can compare the difference.<br>
<br>
PS.<br>
I am not complaining about the delay you made.<br>
Since CA reserved sky first and i try to make my raid during it,<br>
i was ready for such trouble.<br>

Mostly there is no problem except one part.<br>
<br>
&gt;A sky raid may claim between one and three consecutive days in the plane. <br>
<br>
This &quot;rough&quot; limitation is causing the problem.<br>
Because this can be monopolization of zone for full 3 days.<br>
Here is my suggestion for solution.<br>
<br>
Make rule #1 like...<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
I. You cannot post more then 2 weeks ahead of the start of the first day of the raid. You can post max 3 reservations for different isles.One reservation post for one day. Any post will be deleted if it breaks any portion of this rule. Board time will be used to determine this. <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Now, sky reservation post is like...<br>
[Guild X, sky raid 20th - 22th]<br>
<br>
instead of that, make it like<br>
[Guild X, sky 1-4th isle 20th]<br>
[Guild X, sky 5-6th isle 21th]<br>
[Guild X, sky 7-8th isle 22th]<br>
<br>
Look at old reservation style.<br>
This allows them to keep full isles for full 3 days.<br>
<br>
Look at my idea.<br>
If raiders clarify which isle they will go,<br>
we can make other days for free.<br>
In this example, 1-4th isle should be free on 21th.<br>
So other ppl can reserve this date.<br>
With old method, ppl can't know 1-4th is free on 21th or not.<br>
They need to wait until 23th. This is waste. <br>
In case Guild X fails to do 1-4th on 20th, they just need to give up 21th and 22th<br>
because they simply don't have power to do higher isle and can't go.<br>
Reserving undoable place is non sense.<br>
<br>
If ppl are not sure if they can make it,<br>
and want to learn/practice, just reserve one day for trial.<br>
<br>
I want official comment about this reserving method, from Chants and Adun.<br>
And want any opinions if there is bad point with my idea.<br>
<br>

I think that this raid is being extremely well run with raid leaders carefully explaining over and over to the numerous &quot;sky newbies&quot; how to preform on this raid.  The raiders are also being patient and not flaming the leaders for not being able to progress further.  The group leaders are also preforming their roles extremely well - keeping groups informed of discussions happening in chat.  <br>
<br>
As with life, sometimes the unexpected does happen.  I would say that the delay is **not** the fault of the raid leaders.  Nor would I say this group is not competent to hunt this zone.  All the people on this raid are gaining valuable experience in a new enviroment.  As far as I can see there has been no wasted down time where the leaders have been sitting doing nothing.  There is also no farming of loot on the first isle.   At 230am est they were still planning to get the 3rd isle cleared and camp on the 4th.  However, some of us have RL committment that require some sleep.  At this point they made - what I feel ws the wise decision - to call it a night and start the ball rolling again today.  I say *cheer* to the raid leaders for keeping a nasty CR going as smoothly as possible. <p><font size=2><font color=Tan ><b>TheGrouping Druid!</b><br>

<br>
Do we get a special Card (Guys!!! Just one more punch and we can reserve Sky!!!), or will some of you give us new raid leaders a test, and we get our official &quot;Brell Raider's License&quot;?<br>
<br>
I guess I don't get it. I really don't. You are saying &quot;You can't reserve a plane unless you can prove you can pull the raid off.&quot; That sounds like the most increadable case of 60th level arrogance I have ever heard. This may come as a shock to you, but not all guilds are populated with 60th level characters, and not all of us are carrying our epic weapons and are replacing Knuark armor with Skyshrine armor. We don't all hunt Temple of Veeshan for a good time...<br>
<br>
Now I understand that for some of you, you can set a time table on Sky. &quot;Isle 1 = 20 minutes, Isle 2 = 1 hour 15 mins&quot;, but we can't, and if you were honest with yourselves you'd know you couldn't either when you were raiding in groups averaging 52nd level.<br>
<br>
The plain sits empty on weeknights. Nights that a damn good team can take easy. Weeknights are hard nights to raid, peeps have work the next morning, so a tighter schedual is required. The weekends are easier raids, lots of people can comfortably raid on the weekend. All I see here is someone who does not have Rants anymore who is upset that a newbie took a holiday weekend to raid. <br>
<br>
I see posts about restricting who can do what and where, and how it's pointless to reserve, and how we should just FFA / FCFS the planes, etc. If we do, do you REALLY think this is going to get any better? Do you REALLY think that if Sky was FCFS that the raiders up there would care one way or another about your time table? <br>
<br>
What about post SoL, when (and you know it will happen) better armor and weapons make Sky even easier, and a tight raid crew all 60+ and maxxed out on the new &quot;Post 60 development&quot; can clear Sky in 2 days. Are you going to impose a new timetable then, making it even harder to learn? <br>

<br>
I believe I understand what you're saying, Roatus, and I don't wholly disagree.  But putting a time table on every person's raid so that someone can come up early is difficult to enforce, especially considering the unexpected.<br>
<br>
I'm refraining from siting our raid for examples, as I truly don't want this to become a rant, but rather a discussion on what the rules should be.  Are simultaneous raids wise or practical?  Perhaps they do offer full utilization of the plane.  I've seen posts where 3 raids using different chat channels have succeeded in communicating effectively in other zones.  This might work in Plane of Sky.<br>
<br>
Down sides I see to this method though is that everyone runs their raids a little differently.  Down time from medding or corpse recovery or replacing folks during the earlier raid (potentially a slower raid) could cause a collision of the 2 raids running if the second raid runs faster.  From experience here on the boards, that leads to accusations about who has the &quot;right&quot; to the plane, second raid needing to wait anyways until first group moves on, or the second raid claiming FCFC, we're ready and you're not so we're moving through.  I'm not sure I like any of those outcomes.<br>
<br>
PS: Roatus, as a side note:  We are starting fresh today, and plan on moving as far forward as possible before our time is up in Sky today.  We have no arguments with your group obtaining keys on isle 1 today once we've cleared isle 3.  I just wanted to make sure that is clear.  Our only issue with the folks that want to start early is that they not harrass our raid leaders and let them lead us forward. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ualannia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>alannia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0> at: 5/26/01 8:03:40 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uvendrenghanoble.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vendrengha Noble</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/26/01 8:53:12 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: my idea of new rule</span><hr size=1> What is totally overlooked is the fact that 2 raids WILL cause massive LDs, something which is totally abhorrent.<br>
<br>
Another rule should be that raids averaging 55+ should not be allowed to go on weekends, since they can seemingly just breeze through the plane on weeknights.'<br>
<br>
I thinks this rule should really be enforced vigorously, to keep uber peoples pointless views out from the training grounds of the non-elitist.<br>

Before posting such reply, read my posts again carefuly.<br>
There is already answer for you written.<br>
This kind of reply was expected.<br>
<br>
To Valeer:<br>
&gt;You are saying &quot;You can't reserve a plane unless you can &gt;prove you can pull the raid off.&quot; <br>
Wrong. What i am saying is,<br>
&quot;You shouldn't reserve undoable place where you have never been to.(this means higher isles of sky which should be on 2nd and 3rd day) Just practice lower isle first and learn and try another time.&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;Now I understand that for some of you, you can set a time<br>
&gt;table on Sky. &quot;Isle 1 = 20 minutes, Isle 2 = 1 hour 15<br>
&gt;mins&quot;, but we can't, and if you were honest with <br>
&gt;yourselves you'd know you couldn't either when you were<br>
&gt;raiding in groups averaging 52nd level.<br>
Set time as you wish. I don't force you to do it quick.<br>
If you think you can't finish 3rd isle in day one, just reserve 1-2 isle for the day.<br>
Then reserve 3-4th isle for 2nd day.<br>
This is my idea. Is there any problem?<br>
If you fail, simply give up and try another time. Any problem?<br>
Whether your mistake or accident,<br>
if you can't finish raid in time, you will &quot;fail&quot;.<br>
If ppl got wiped out and couldn't kill Vox in their day,<br>
they need to pass it to next rotation.<br>
If ppl couldn't kill Trakanon they needed to give up.<br>
&quot;It was unexpected&quot; won't be excuse.3days reservation problem is, it is being used for &quot;retry&quot;.<br>
<br>
I did sky and made same mistake you did, but i didn't monopolize 3days,<br>
didn't prevent other weekend raids.<br>
I went sky, died and learned, then went back &quot;another day&quot; and did better raid.<br>
<br>
&gt;If we do, do you REALLY think this is going to get any<br>
&gt;better? Do you REALLY think that if Sky was FCFS that the<br>
&gt;raiders up there would care one way or another about your <br>
&gt;time table? <br>
Sky should be reservable. <br>
My idea will make it BETTER because it stops ppl to stuck on lower isle and won't block higher isle raids.<br>
<br>
To Allania:<br>
&gt;But putting a time table on every person's raid so that &gt;someone can come up early is difficult to enforce, &gt;especially considering the unexpected.<br>
Setting time is your job. No one force it.<br>
If you can't think about it because you are new to sky,<br>
just go and learn a bit so that you can set time.<br>
<br>
&gt;Are simultaneous raids wise or practical?<br>
Under rule, it would be good and it should be.<br>
You are not the only person who wants to do sky at weekend.<br>

If you reserve isles which you will go,<br>
those isles are reserved, whether next raid crews are slow or fast,<br>
you can do those isles as you wish as you want.<br>
But if you can't finish those isles which you reserved,<br>
simply you &quot;failed&quot; and need to give up.<br>

You are just scared by high levels.<br>

-----------------------------------------------------<br>
Guild X reserves sky, 1-4th isle on 20th<br>
Guild X reserves sky, 5-6th isle on 21th<br>
Guild X reserves sky, 7-8th isle on 22th<br>
<br>
Guild Y reserves sky, 1-4th isle on 21th<br>
Guild Y reserves sky, 5-8th isle on 22th<br>
<br>
Guild X reserves sky, 1-2nd isle on 22th<br>
Guild X reserves sky, 3-4th isle on 23th<br>
<br>
Guild @ reserves sky, 7th isle on 24th<br>
<br>
Guild Z reserves sky, 1-4th isle on 24th<br>
Guild Z reserves sky, 5-8th isle on 25th<br>
-----------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Raid crews reserve sky like this.<br>
<br>
On 20th, Guild X went sky and got wiped out on 2nd(imp isle).<br>
They didn't know how to CR and made huge down time,<br>
couldn't reach to 4th isle in that day.(EVERYONE include me did this on first raid btw)<br>
They need to give up because they can't be on 5th isle until 21th.<br>
No problem, because Guild X failed.<br>
<br>
Whether Guild X failed or succeeded, 1-4 would be free at 21th.<br>
Guild Y clears isle1-4 very quick.<br>
They can do isle5, but it is reserved, in case Guild X was there<br>
it would cause conflict, so Guild Y stays on 4th and calls night.<br>
<br>
On 22th, Guild Y do 5+. isle1-4 are free.<br>
Guild X decides to come back for more trial.<br>
Guild X reserves 22th only for isle1-2 this time. <br>
Guild X reserves isle3-4 for 2nd day in case for they can be there.<br>
Guild X doesn't reserve 5+ because they noticed it is very hard for them.<br>
Guild X gets wiped out again on 2nd,<br>
but they are prepared this time, everyone is bound in gfay and have coffin.<br>
CR is done quick and they clear 2nd isle in time.<br>
<br>
On 23th, slowly but Guild X clears isle3-4,<br>
they get key for 5th isle.<br>
They look on reservation board and notices there is no raid for 5,6 isle on 24th.<br>
Guild X decides to stay in sky for one more day.<br>
<br>
On 24th <br>
Guild @ is farming isle7.<br>
Guild X raids isle5.<br>
It causes no trouble because it is mentioned that 5&amp;6 isles are free this moment.<br>
Guild Z comes to sky and start isle1-4 raid.<br>
<br>
This is my idea for new reservation rule.<br>
Isn't this systematic?<br>
As long as i can see, there are no problems.<br>
If you find any bad point, please mention it.<br>

(except for in two weeks).<br>
<br>
Any system will have its downside, but I think Roatus's idea (at least on the surface) has the best solution to &quot;fixing&quot; the &quot;overpopulation&quot; (roflmao) in sky.  (okay, there's no real issue with sky being over populated currently but perhaps in two monhts there will be).<br>

<br>
Roatus, please bear with me a bit.  Language barriers are sometimes difficult to overcome.  I am making an effort. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
It sounds to me like the suggestion here is to reserve ISLANDS rather than entire the entire Air plane.  Failure then becomes respective to whether or not you complete your scheduled islands during your day or days scheduled.  I believe I have summarized Roatus' suggestion.<br>
<br>
I personally still disagree with that concept, at least at this time.  This is, though, only my opinion, and the only thing I can use to justify that opinion is my experience, and the notings of how often Sky is reserved and what days.<br>
<br>
A separate issue, which I don't believe Roatus meant as an insult, but rather meant as an example, is CA's sky raid.  Because I know the details of that raid, I disagree with it being used as an example of anything.  Surface appearances are not always truth.  Roatus, I think you have posted some very good ideas, and are truly interested in fuller utilization of the plane on the weekends that they are most sought after.  Had I thought for a minute that our schedule would cause someone else problems, I would have done it differently.  Naive as I can be, I instead followed the rules of the boards, and chose to try to make sure our raiders had a good time.  If the rules of the board need changing, that's one thing.  But we followed the existing rules, and did not break any that I am aware of. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uroatusbh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RoatusBH</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 133<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/27/01 12:48:40 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Sky rule need to be changed with strong guide line</span><hr size=1> &gt;It sounds to me like the suggestion here is to reserve ISLANDS rather than entire <br>

You tell it simply ... thanks for clarification, yes that is what i meant.<br>
<br>
&gt;This is, though, only my opinion, and the only thing I can use to justify that<br>
&gt;opinion is my experience, and the notings of how often Sky is reserved and what days.<br>
If the rule forces you to reserve sky like &quot;You need to raid minimum 3 isles per a day&quot;<br>
it will be tough for you, tough for low-middle level range ppl. This is problem.<br>
But, my rule doesn't ask it.<br>
The person who decide which isle to go, is yourself, not board mod, niether the Rule.<br>
Extremely example of my rule, you can reserve 1st day=isle1, 2nd day=isle2, 3rd day=isle3. Or 1st day=isle1-8.<br>
You can adjust difficulty to your level/experience.<br>
<br>
I am just asking ppl to have responsibility on their actions.<br>
If you reserve it, you need to complete it. My rule will just clarify it.<br>
This is how reservation system works, not only plane but on dragons also.<br>
If you reserve dragons, you must have enough power to do it and need to kill it until time limit.<br>
What i am asking on sky rule is nothing different from this.<br>
<br>
&gt;A separate issue, which I don't believe Roatus meant as an insult,<br>
&gt;but rather meant as an example, is CA's sky raid.<br>
Everyone did same, not only CA.<br>
I did, SR did, Emmerald(some ppl know her) did, abyss did, everyone did.<br>
<br>
They duel/AE on 1st isle and get killed by quest NPC.<br>
They get slaughtered by imps on 2nd isle and long run for summon corpse.<br>
They get thrown into sky and fall by g-fluxing wisps on 3rd isle.<br>
<br>
This is how ppl learn sky. I wrote it as normal example.<br>
<br>
Anyway...if you felt bad about my post, i will apologize.<br>
If you wish to edit that part, tell me please.<br>

If the first raids had posted that they were gonna camp on island 1 on the first day and then move up a couple on saturday and then end up at maybe island 5 on the sunday, Roatus could have waited til people had camped out and cleared up til island 4 on the friday, and everything would have respawned for the other group.<br>

sky has room for two groups / weekend, unless both groups are powerful enough to clear all islands, unless they can do it in a day then it might be tough. <p><a href=http://sr.amiga.tm/cgi-bin/members.cgi?show=Veranon target=_document >

Actually, that is excatly what was posted on the signup.<br>
<br>
Thursday night: Isle 1 for keys, camp.<br>
Friday Night: Isle 1-4 Camp on 4.<br>
Saturday: Isle 4+<br>
<br>
Now as it turned out, some rather increadable bad luck caused us to fail on Isle 3 (Azaraks). And a rather long and expensive CR was done. I decided at 2am to call the raid, and port up a few people offering to help the next morning, rather than take a bunch of tired people on another run again the Azaraks.<br>
<br>
Roatus:<br>
I am trying to figure out how taking 1 day out of a long weekend is &quot;monopolizing the plane&quot;. Sky sits empty STILL more than half the time. TYPICALLY people who reserve Sky Take Fri/Sat/Sun. Getting Keys and occasionally Dojorn on Friday night, Saturday is the first &quot;real&quot; raid day, with final portups and such.<br>
<br>
I thought moving the first key day to Thursday would mean far less &quot;wasted&quot; Sky time, as we were planning on dropping the Gorgaliks, and camping. But luck was not with us and the Azaraks wiped us out.<br>
<br>
We did however leave Sunday and Monday completely open. (I don't know about where you live, but Monday is a holiday in the U.S., but I found out so was Thursday and Friday from a few of our Euro guildmates on Wednesday, and actually felt bad that we had taken a fair chunk out of what would be a perfect opportunity for Sky for Europa Tribes, or some other Euro-based guild..)<br>
<br>
If you are going to enforce a time table on the planes, I don't think it's right. And no matter how you put it saying that if I can't camp my raid on x isle by the end of the day I have to call my raid is enforcing a time table. It really is no different than saying &quot;If you are going to be in Fear, you have to be done by 12am Pacific to avoid a partially popped fear.&quot; Does that sound familair?<br>
<br>
Had you brought your raid group in Saturday night, taken the first Isle, for keys and camped, I would not have had a problem. That would have given you unrestricted access to 2 full days of raiding (assuming a U.S. raid team), so we would have managed to squeeze 2 full raids out of a weekend. I also noticed you were able to get Monday without any problems but opted NOT to take Sunday. Well, it's Sunday, and to my knowledge there is no one in Sky and THAT, sir, is a waste.<br>
<br>
I would not have had so much problem with your post, in my opinion, but with me finding out you were questioning people on my raid who were trying to do their jobs rather than talking to me. It's not hard to see who the raid leader is. If you had looked on the page, and followed the signup thread it actually says right after my name (Raid Leader). Instead you were questioning Negatorx, and I had to send you a tell to straighten things up. <p><img src="http://images.honesty.com/imagedata/h/224/17/32241726.jpg"><BR><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=1323">Valeer Shadowsbaine Reaver of the 52nd Season</A> <br>
