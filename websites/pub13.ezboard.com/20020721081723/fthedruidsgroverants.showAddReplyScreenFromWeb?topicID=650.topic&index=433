First, I want to say that I am sure most of us &quot;outsiders&quot; aka non-druid-mains realize how much heart and effort you have put into the manifesto. Many of us also know that the druid started out as the most powerful class in the game, and while the class was scaled back while others increased in power somewhat for balancing, you feel like you have been cheated all along.<br>
<br>
A few things should be pointed out though, and many people have done so in wonderful manners, in well spoken posts rather than &quot;Dr00ds sux&quot; type posts that seem to be prevalent when class discussions come up.<br>
<br>
I haven't read thru every single post here, but was it ever mentioned that Verant DID in fact attempt to help bridge the healing gap a while back? I seem to recall that superior healing was a very high level spell, which druids and shaman now get much sooner, that in turn required a better heal for the clerics, because as the main healer, they NEED to be better at it than us. That benefited everyone.<br>
<br>
Every major change in one class affects others in some way. I think that many of the points brought up dismissing several parts and reasoning of the manifesto are valid, just as there are things that the druid should get. It was stated that druid were designed to be good in many things, but not specialists in any one area. Welcome to the club we shaman belong to for most of our careers. <br>
<br>
It is not until we get to be higher levels that our roles are defined, and if you think about the one thing a shaman is crucial for on a raid, what is it? Slowing. Done successfully, that means we can theoretically cast one spell per fight, and our job is done. Ever been in a group where your only job was to snare? Same concept in a way.<br>
<br>
My point is, our class is what we make of it. We were designed that way. Shaman and druids are the most dynamic classes in the game. We can heal, buff, do spell damage, have pets(certain cases for druids). How we chose to define ourselves should not be determined by anything other than our desires and goals we want to achieve. <br>
<br>
Asking for so much will not help you much. You want better heals, you want better dots, you want to have the same porting abilities as Wizards in Luclin, among other things. The trick to winning is to pick your battles. If you want to be known for healing, go for a better type of heal or play a cleric. If you want to do more DD or DOTs, address those primarily or be a wizard or a necro. If you want to be able to port in Luclin, take a look at the big picture of WHY you can't right now and figure out a compromise or go be a wizard. Don't ask for them all. Focus.<br>
<br>
I have resolved myself a long time ago that I will never excel in any one area (except buffs now that I am approaching my mid 50's) but I will play my class to the best of my ability with what tools I have been given. I suggest that you not try to become too powerful in too many areas, or you will get burned. Take the wonderful tools you have and do amazing things, play creatively, find new ways to use what you have. <br>
<br>
I also want to say a couple words about back up healers. As far as I know, druids and shaman have the same general healing spell, superior healing. With the added benefit of Chloroblast, that moves you into the number two healer slot, shaman being 3rd. Me as a shaman, I take my roll as backup healer seriously. I have been in raids where I was the only healer for my group, for the groups that aren't necessarily taking all the damage, or just because we are short of clerics. Not only can I keep my groups alive, I target the critical non melee classes (chanters and clerics usually) for heals and keep those outside my group alive to do THEIR jobs longer. <br>
<br>
Funny, as third class healer, I make a difference, even without chloroblast. So I hope you don't expect me to feel sorry for your &quot;insufficient&quot; healing abilities, because they are not. I don't plan to take the place of the cleric. Our job, and its an important one, as secondary healer is to try and keep those not with the cleric alive to fight another battle, and if on the Main Tank, our Superior heal buys him that extra 5 seconds until that CH lands, who says we am useless as healers. I certainly don't think so, and neither should you.<br>
<br>
Something about negotiation, pick your battles, offer a simple solution, and try to see the situation from the other's point of view. It sounds like you want to be just as good as clerics, wizards, necros in your manifesto, and you don't stop to consider that the things you ask for as not as easy for Verant to do as you make it sound. Not only will they have to deal with druid issues, but the backlash of every other class. The price you pay for being a multi faceted class is specialization. You have heard it before, you will probably hear it again. But take it from a shaman...we are not so very different. Embrace the diversity of your class and not try to be the end all to all classes.<br>
<br>
Side notes: I really DO think you should change the porting issue to something that will be palatable to Verant to easily change for you. The porting on Luclin. I am assuming that Succor does not work there, but it should. That is an easy fix relatively, and something that I think is crucial. The storyline provides for Wizards to port, but to allow druids the same ability falls outside that. Succor would be better even than a port to Nexus. Who the hell wants to run halfway across the moon after an evac to the Nexus? I think it would be a nice balance, without taking anything from the wizard.<br>
<br>
Oh, and about Torpor, that spell should not even be included in any kind of comparisons. It is not very practical unless there is down time. In a fighting situation, chloroblast is far more preferable that Torpor. Can't cast Torpor on anyone that is meleeing. Good for improving downtime after rezzes though (saves mana on heals).<br>
<br>
I hope you are not too disappointed in the results of your petition. I think druids are great, and in many areas, the can do things I cannot. And that's ok. Viva le diff! <p><BR>
