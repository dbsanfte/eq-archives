<br>
Zones?  I'd like to feel fear again when i zone in like I did in unrest.  I'd like a zone that randomly dropped you in the zone when you zoned in and for there to be 1 dark blue or two light blue mobs where ever you popped in at.  tough enough to kill you if you didn't begin instent combat and watch yourself.  I'd then like people to be able to fight there way to a meet spot of other people before going for the realy tough mobs in the zone.  This to me would get my heart pumping again and bring thrills of liveing.   <br>
<br>
I'd also like smarter mobs to con me n go get help before they aggro me.<br>
<br>
I'd also like mobs to drop dented and rusted plate in newbie zones.  I'm sorry but as a snobish paladin we should never wear anything less then that awful chain.  To me even that ratty shirt we get should be &quot;plate&quot; and not cloth from the guild.  Keep the stats but say it's an old rusty batterd breastplate.<br>
<br>
I'd like to see top end unique armor for each class/race <br>
<br>
I'd like shields to midigate a low -5%-15%- of melee damage with aa points or a discipline or combo there of.  Nothing to allow me to replace warriors on raids but something to make me tank better in extreme instences.<br>
<br>
I'd like to see a summon horse spell with t-boot speed at lvl 40ish.  Have it require a 10pp jem or a no drop item that stacks and drops common in some dead zone like kith off the dead at night.<br>
<br>
I'd like to summon a sword instead of a hammer.  <br>
<br>
I'd like my halo of light to be a buff not an item or for my summoned weapon to be the light sorce.<br>
<br>
I'd like to see bogus reports of false items dropping in a zone.<br>
<br>
I'd like the chat cussing filter to be an option when you make a account and you're asked &quot;Do you want cussing to be filter out or not?&quot;   For some reason despite e hardly ever cussing it bothers me when people tell others not to cuss and the only way they know this is because they DISCONNECTED THE CUSS FILTER!  &lt;- pet peave since I died n vented in rathe mountains n lost a group because of it back in 2000.<br>
<br>
I'd like to see a new skill called &quot;charge&quot; it might work like this?<br>
target mob from range and hit &quot;Charge&quot; while mounted.  The comp then makes you run streight at the mob &lt;kind of like &quot;follow&quot;&gt; and hit's your attack as you enter melee range and stops you.  Auto double to quadrouple damage on first swing.   Not sure why I want this but I do.  Of corse sk's and warriors should have it to.  I'd say double to tripple damage damage for baught horses -depending on cost- and quadrouple damage for holy steeds.  <br>
<br>
I'd like to see zones where buildings would keep out a mob for 1 eq hour after which either the mob gave up n left -still large aggro range- or &quot;broke through&quot; and attacks you.  or if smart enough opens the door.<br>
<br>
i'd like vendors to hate lions in their stores killing their customers.<br>
<br>
I'd like boss mobs of some zones to respawn in different places in their zone with their court.  Random places so camps aren't called in dungons and fear of holding a &quot;normal&quot; camp is just a little bit scarier<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I would like mental clarity and regen archetype skills to have a progressive benefit for each level or cost the same amount of pts for each level as lvl 1.<br>

Ignoring the problems with placing you in the right spot (not above the world so you fall to death, or below the world so you die instantly / get trapped - blech) this would be a nightmare.  Both for them to code and for the players.  Imagine the trains when just a single group logged in and everyone tried to run all over the place to avoid getting eaten.  You'd have to make the monsters tough to provide a challenge to someone like a necro but that means a paladin / warrior might get raped too easily.  Couldn't be balanced, wouldn't work well and would be another wasted zone.  I'd hate to do CR in this zone of yours.<br>
<br>

<br>
Ummm, no you don't.  Really, you don't.  Might think so at first, but just imagine zoning into someplace just barely underconned for your level - you'd get mobbed.  Would also be a real annoyance - I can't imagine how many of the gnolls in blackburrow would swarm me if I tried to help some low level person out in there.  Its bad enough with the current code - I don't think we want the critters forming up an army and coming after us too.  Too many problems with this too.<br>

???  class armors, cultural stuff, etc....  they're doing much better with this sort of stuff.<br>
<br>
The Shield Idea is nice.  Its been beaten nearly to death though and they just haven't latched onto it yet.  Try sending in a well written / thought out letter to the development team.  Your 'Charge' idea (been brought up before) isn't bad either.  Make another letter and send it in.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Hammers put big nasty dents in things.  Big dents hurt.  Big, big dents hurt more.  Hammers are fine - should be able to summon both maybe.  The only reason to want this is because you didn't practice 1H Blunt.  Shame on you, no wait - shame on me too (my 1H blunt is around 90ish).<br>

They don't comment on this stuff for a reason.  Truthfully, they shouldn't.  There's no reason they should provide the player with more information than their character can get on its own.  Quit reading the crappier EQ Spoiler sites and you'll be o.k.<br>

Were you around back when you could stand on the huts in E Karanas and just nuke Scarecrows until out of mana because they couldn't hit you.  There's lots of exploits in the game like this already (Highhold Pass / Everfrost / etc....).  I don't like this idea either.<br>
<br>
Just an FYI: Vendors have an irrational fear of lions.  Lions already know from experience (how'd they level up to 7 anyways) that all Vendors were adventurers who went off slaying dragons  when they were younger.  That's why lions don't attack Vendors.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Bored at work, so this is what I want.....<br>
<br>
Improved AI in their Path Following Engine - not just predetermined routes for creatures to follow.  Have the monsters actually take shortcuts / follow you properly / etc...  Things like the pathing between the two bridges in Karnor's is just sad / lazy coding.<br>
<br>
Unique looking mobs.  I hate the fact that they reuse so many of the models.  Please don't just change the colors of the textures and the scaling of the models.  Its lame and boring.<br>
<br>
Sick of spiders everywhere too.  So many spider mobs - red/yellow/green/brown, they're all the same.  Make new spiders if we have to have spiders.  Bats, snakes and crocs too.  I want to be able to tell the difference between the cute, cuddly little baby Tunarean Swamp Crocodiles and the big nasty, fearsome, bone crushing Deep Sea Crocs that inhabit the shores of Odus, not just 'look - that thar's one of dem dere croc thingies'.  More unique fantasy based monsters.<br>
<br>
Death touches - stupid, get rid of them or at least don't use them anymore.  Not really fun, not really a challenge.  Just an easy, gimpy way to make something tough.  There's nothing to overcome except having enough peeps around to eat all of the DT's and still be effective.<br>
<br>
Forest / Jungle zones that look like a forest / jungle.  More distinct trees would be nice - not just these cloned pine trees / oak trees we have everywhere.  New terrain models everywhere.<br>
<br>
Dynamic zones that have a variable spawn rate based on how much is killed / minute.  That way you can feel like you're clearing out the gnolls in Blackburrow.  Slightly randomized spawn points too.  Have things spawn in an area of the zone, not at specific points.<br>
<br>
Unique Deity based spells.  I want to make people suffer and choke as I call forth the drowning waters of Prexus upon them.  The dwarves could slow something's attack / movement rate as they call upon Brell to encase it within stone.  Shouldn't be too tough to do, would give a nice change to how race/class combos are now.<br>
<br>
Ability scores that really matter.<br>
<br>
Holy symbols / religious relics. <br>
<br>
Overhaul faction system.  Why can they tell what religion I am.  I haven't anything on me that shows I worship Prexus instead of Quellious. <br>
<br>
Actually, I think they need to just toss the whole game in the can and start over.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I could go on forever. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udanaellebladesong.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Danaelle Bladesong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sexadin</span><br>  Posts: 148<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/4/02 2:06:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15743.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/bladesong_clan/danaelleface.txt WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Odd ball things that'd make eq better? </span><hr size=1> I can handle everything else...

I didnt even know this but Rangers get Instill Doubt, with snare they are almost unstopable soloers, same for Shadow Knights.  We need a spell line like that.<br>

To me weapon types are irrelevant. The only reason to use a bash instead of a slash are other concerns like ratio / taunt etc. Type matters not.<br>
<br>
Skeletons should require blunt for maximum performance and so on. I'm not necesarily asking for better damage from the prefered weapon but maybe degraded performance from the others.<br>
<br>
We have what 3 types of melee attack ?<br>
Slash - 1hs,2hs<br>
Concusion - 1hb, 2hb, Fist,Bash,Kick<br>
Pierce - 1hp,2hp, Archery<br>

Otherwise i am quite content with the curren game content. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uxitix.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xitix</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wandering Knight</span><br>  Posts: 134<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/5/02 11:38:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15743.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Odd ball things that'd make eq better? </span><hr size=1> A compass on the screen. Never liked the fact EQ doesn't have one making it way to easy to get lost direction wise. The visual cues and enviroment cues for direction aren't there so a compass should be. No major shadows from the sun, no winds blowing in the same general direction, no actual movement by the player who is allways sitting at a desk.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=aeka>Aeka</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Knight of the Realm</span><br>  Posts: 1413<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/5/02 12:00:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15743.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Odd ball things that'd make eq better? </span><hr size=1> I am hoping that Planes of Powers brings an improved AI to the monsters.<br>

Would it be so hard to make the monsters behave like they are in groups?  People would be amazed by how high end encounters change if they had to face configurations they use. ^_^ <p><font size="+1">
