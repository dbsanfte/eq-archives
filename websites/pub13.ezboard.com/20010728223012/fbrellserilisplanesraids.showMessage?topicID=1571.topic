<br>
First, a reservation is for the entire plane and every mob therein with no exceptions.  If a guild can't do the big boss's, then that belongs to the next raid.  If say a guild wants the boss and he's not being taken down, they can be allowed to do the boss but only if there is enough time to allow for a respawn for that next raid that may want the boss.  It's basically this, if a guild/organizer signs up for a plane, they have a right to the boss.  They do not have the right to deal the boss away from another raid.  Any days where that plane is not reserved, those days are FFA or FCFS but mobs are only taken if there is enough time to allow for that mob to respawn for the next reserved raid.<br>
<br>
This should go for Air, Fear and Hate for sure.  I think PoG should be added but i'm open.<br>
<br>
It is the responsibility of each guild/organizer to check the board and this &quot;we never check the board&quot; excuse is so lame and insulting.  <br>

I do agree with the way I've read that SR and Watchers goes about it. They ask the raid leader and invite those that want to join in on the kill. I don't think Cazic should stay alive for a full month because those in the rotation don't have the power to take him out. I know that's taking it a bit extreme but I'm sure you can see my point.<br>
I know that may sound FFA but not really. The raid leader has a right to invite who they want and when they want them. <br>

<br>
Why on earth would we want to see spawns wasted. For example...I head someone who was leading a fear raid say something along the lines of...We are gonna kill ct! I admired the devotion to trying it...But I was not surprised when draco wiped them out TWICE. Simple fact is most people cannot handle the CT spawn yet so putting him as part of a planar reservation is bullcrap. A planar reservation is fine IMO to include everything but the golems, draco and CT for Fear. Not really an issue with Sky since it has not been changed in anyway. And with Hate I would say also Innie would not be part of a plane's reservation.<br>
<br>
Now before you get all hot and bothered and reply with your righteous indignation Sheebla. I want you to really consider. If no one but a few guilds can kill a mob...What is the point on leaving it in a reservation system where it will stay up?<br>

Some sort of guidelines have to be laid down for how the guilds that only need CT &amp; Draco from fear can come in &amp; kill CT &amp; Draco.<br>
<br>
What you're asking is similar to asking that Nagafen be considered as part of a Fire Giant raid, and that Nagafen cannot be killed unless you've got a reservation for Fire Giants.<br>
<br>
What would that do?  You'd have people reserving FG's simply for a shot at Nagafen, and that would get in the way of people who want only to do FG's.<br>
<br>
Bottom line: THE SYSTEM WILL NOT WORK UNLESS EVERYONE FINDS IT ACCEPTABLE.<br>
<br>
Saying that CT &amp; Draco MUST remain up unless SR, or Watchers signs up for the plane &amp; happens to have them up will likely be unacceptable for those guilds.<br>
<br>
On Prexus, the guild Unity has made it known that on a 3 guild rotation, when CT is up, one of those guilds will go into Fear &amp; clear the plane before the reserved raid is scheduled to go in.  Why?  Mostly because people were unwilling to work out something with the guilds that needed only CT &amp; Draco.<br>
<br>

Tough.  Who's to say they would be up even if SR/Watchers/Enshadowed didn't join the end of another scheduled raid?  Unless the mob is up when you zone into the plane on your scheduled day he isn't yours.<br>
<br>
If I'm hosting a raid and need reinforcements I have every right to ask whoever I want to come in and help out.  Its been done that way forever.  If a raid didn't have enough for the old CT they called up a few friends to come help out.  How is this any different?<br>
<br>
This last time SR/Watchers killed him the day was NOT SCHEDULED.  One other time they asked everyone that had fear scheduled for the next WEEK.  Do you really want to make it so that they have to schedule dates in Fear to kill him and then let all that armor that ALOT of people are fighting to get just rot?<br>
<br>
Geez I swear SR/Watchers find a way to share and work things out with the raiders in game where they are happy and people still bitch.  Here go read this <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://tweety.bowlofmice.com/tweety/lipsmackingood.html">tweety.bowlofmice.com/twe...ngood.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
__________<br>
<br>
And the only two mobs that should be considered here are CT and Draco.  Dread, Fright, and Terror can be taken down by a guild that knows what they are doing.  Harpers/SoTG took down all three with minimal losses.<br>
<br>

<br>
And no way should PoG be reserved in any way.  Twiggie is bound on the PoG tower and I go in there alot.  Its almost always full popped and empty of raiders.  Recently I hosted a few raids and now others on my raids have decided to host a few.  But the zone is still empty 6 out of 7 days a week or more. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usheebla1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sheebla1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/27/01 9:19:23 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   re</span><hr size=1> If you reserve the Plane, you have the right to all the mobs there.

Yes, people will need to contact raid leaders and raid leaders will need to post their intentions.  An example would be as follows:  &quot;Ladies Home Sewing Circle guild doing Plane of Fear, we do not plan to take out any of the Bosses&quot;.  The bosses in this case are FFA or FCFS but will need to be killed with enough time to allow a respawn for the next reservation that does want the particular mobs.  It's just to simple and courtious to everyone.<br>

And, guilds get help from outside the guild all the time, I have been asked many time to go help out.  I just hope people understant that there are numerous guilds that can summon supplemental help.<br>

In that raid we got down to the end and then had more people show up in the plane in order to take down CT. These were not people that took place in the raid previously.<br>
<br>
Many fear raids in the past followed this exact same formula, you clear the plane up to the gods and then others show up to take down CT. At least for small guilds this was the case.<br>
<br>
They didn't simple pass CT along because that raid crew could not handle CT, they got others. The sought out higher numbers and higher lvls.<br>
<br>
How is this different from now? Guild A goes to fear, CT is up they go through killing everything they can then call up the reinforcements to take out CT on THEIR scheduled day.<br>
<br>
Are you upset because how the planes were done in the past and still done today is not acceptable to you or because you had a planed raid that comes 6 days and not 7 days after CT was killed and thus will not be up for you?<br>
<br>
I am deeply against any new reservations. Unless a solid reason can come up as to why a underutilized and very large plane like PoG should be added I can not see my view changing.<br>

The fact is that there are very few groups of players on this server with the resources to take down the uber mobs.  Saying that they have to stand by while other raids leave those uber mobs standing is silly and is obviously not acceptable to those groups of players.<br>
<br>
The only solution, other than ffa, is cooperation between those guilds that are plains capable and those that are god capable so that both can prosper.<br>
<br>
Through this whole process we hear about how this group or that group has THE RIGHT to this and that, this is completly untrue and is one of the basic fallacies of thier viewpoints.  The only reason SR, Watchers and yes, even Enshadowed, dont just take what they need is because they care about being nice to the rest of the server.  They have done this in spite of it negativly effecting the guild strenght of their membership.  Should we through shortsighted selfish demands even further hinder thier progress we will find they have no recourse but to go ffa.  This exact scenario just occured on another server.<br>
<br>
Time to take the heads out of the sand folks.  If we want any reservation system at all it has to be based on consideration for EVERYONE including the top guilds.<br>

If people continue to see everything through rose colored glasses... it will be ugly.  Ahzag has nailed it... why can't the rest of the people see this as well.  If it was about greed, the poopoo would have already hit the fan (and not the small smattering that has hit so far... we are talking explosive diarrhea).  The big guilds have not acted yet, despite the realitive anarchy that is sort of going on.  Please, if you want to salvage any type of reservation system, you need to take into account powergamers.  The only rights you truly have are the ones Verant gave you when you paid your first 10 dollars.  The opportunity to make the most or the least of this game.  There are ceratin guilds that have players that play alot, and if the reservation system revolves around them being inhibited... it isn't going to last.  The big guilds can not be at all places at all times.  The big guilds have no desire to dominate any one mob or spawn repeatedly so no others get to have access.  They just want to be able to play the game.  Personally, what I would suggest is that the big guilds make their calender schedules known... post them publicly.  Smaller guilds can see what is on the agenda for some of the larger guilds... and make their plans accordingly.

The big 4 can schedule what they want, when they want, with great effort made to adhere to it.  Smaller guilds can see what the big guys are up to, see what mobs/planes are free on what days and schedule from there?  You get scheduling, you keep the big guild, power gamers happy.  Everybody wins <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uthoricthemad.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thoric the Mad</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Brell's man of Nomex</span><br>  Posts: 220<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/27/01 12:31:03 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Reservation System</span><hr size=1> Bottom line, you want a shot at CT that bad, approach a raid leader when he's up and see if you can do exactly the same thing we do. Nothing stopping you from doing this except you. Anything else is you being too lazy to actually work for what you want imo, and trying to inflict your needs on everyone else, exactly what you are accusing us of doing. <br>
<br>
Or be inflexible and see where that leads. <br>

I don't see where you are getting all your info tho. I am going to tie both your threads into one.<br>
<br>
First, you are just mad because SR doesn't run out and invite you into VP. They have there own people and thus far the only people to go into VP. Second you are mad about ST. No one has done anything in ST on Brell. I mean do you even have a key? Or is it you just need to say something.<br>
<br>
Next, this whole thing about CT. SR/Watchers/Enshadowed as of right now are the only ones who can take him. I know your going to run out here and say no no others can. Thats fine you can think this all you want. It's not going to make it true but keep thinking it.<br>
<br>
Basicly this looks like it comes down to this. Its like you and SR live next door to a rich guy and he always leaves his door unlocked. One day you go into steal the TV but you see they got there first. They got the loot. It makes you mad. I mean you have his high option of yourself. Thinking your this amazing druid and you weren't PLed. Wow good for you. Get over yourself and move on. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessageRange?topicID=1571.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessageRange?topicID=1571.topic&start=41&stop=57>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessage?topicID=1611.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessage?topicID=1602.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.threadControl?topicID=1571.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1571.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1571.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="brellserilisfrm48">Town Crier (Rules & Announcements)<option value="brellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion">The Commons (General EQ Discussion)<option value="brellserilisfrm56">Salutations & Congratulations <option value="brellserilisfrm33">Dreams & Diversions (Off Topic)<option value="brellserilisfrm55">Fellowship of Guilds (Guildchat)<option value="brellserilisbrellslairadminonly">Brell's Lair (Admin only)<option value="brellserilisfrm64">Archived Threads<option value="brellserilismeleetalk">Tome: Races and Classes <option value="brellserilisroleplaying">Tome: History of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm49">Tome: Visions of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm53">Tome: Heroes Rest<option value="brellserilisfrm58">Tome: The Book of Polls (Voting Booth)<option value="brellserilisplanesraids">Raids & Calendar: Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm42">Scheduling: Rotation Lists<option value="brellserilisschedulingnagafenorfiregiants">Scheduling: Nag, Vox, Trak, FG<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneoffear">Alter Plane: Fear<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofhate">Alter Plane: Hate<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofsky">Alter Plane: Sky<option value="brellserilisfrm46">Looking For Group<option value="brellserilisfrm63">Raids: Archive<option value="brellserilisfrm27">The Bazaar<option value="brellserilisspellsandresearch">The Library (Spells and Research)<option value="brellserilisfrm51">Velious Gems<option value="brellserilisfrm65">Other Worlds: General Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm60">Anarchy Online <option value="brellserilisfrm61">Dark Age of Camelot</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CC9900>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis>Brell Serilis</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids>Raids & Calendar: Discussion</a> <font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href="http://www.brellserilis.net">Brell Serilis.net</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3 b4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
