Sorry. *blush*  Anyway, I didn't want to wait for Lokus to write, though I do look forward to his version of things…:)  Oh yeah, and I wanted to be first on this sight. *grin* <BR>  <BR>  <BR> Darkness.  Complete and utter darkness.  Terrifying not only for its oppressiveness, but merely because it existed.  Her normally superior vision failed utterly here.  Terror grips her heart.  Darkness in Oblivion… <BR>  <BR> Terror finally gives way to a new sensation.  Power fills her, like her mana pool regenerating, but much sweeter, much more intoxicating.  It fills her up completely, overwhelming her senses with wave after wave of pleasure.  Yet all is still Dark.  Darkness in Oblivion… <BR>  <BR> An eternity passes.  An entire universe is created and collapses, and still the overwhelming oppression.  The Power fills her core being, and all she is radiates outward in the darkness.  It was then that the Presence came to her.  Even larger than her own Power, the Presence's awesome Might is incomprehensible to her.  &quot;Welcome home my Child.&quot;  The Voice is soothing and comforting.  A tender father comforting his daughter.  &quot;Ye have learned much whilst ye were living.  Ye strayed from the path I set ye, yet in doing so, have gained much that is to my liking.&quot; <BR>  <BR> The Father is pleased, and it pleases her to feel him near.  &quot;In the other world, I gave ye the Power over the living and the undead.  Now is the time ye take thy rightful place as Mistress of the Dead.&quot;  The Father gestures in the Darkness, and her Power increases a thousand fold.  She moans drunkenly, unable to contain the energies overpowering her senses. <BR>  <BR> A shadow separates itself from the inky blackness.  Any others would never have noticed, but this shadow was for her, and no other.  She sensed the malicious intent in the beast.  Summoning her Will, light explodes into the shadow.  A brief scream, and all is still. <BR>  <BR> Thirty shadows appear, then fifty…a hundred.  All out to feed on her essence.  Her Power begs for release, and she obliges.  A tremendous explosion rips at the very fabric of all that exists (for her).  One hundred shadows dissolve into smoke. <BR>  <BR> The Father is pleased.  He gestures, and a throne of souls appears.  &quot;Come, take thy place in this Realm.  I give ye all that ye desire.  The Dead are thine to command.&quot; <BR>  <BR> Gracefully, she takes her rightful place and presides over the Dead.  Oblivion covers all… <BR>  <BR> --------------------------- <BR>  <BR> Lanneth screamed one last time as his magics overwhelm his flesh.  An unknown force opens and swallows him up, and he falls.  Eternity rushes up to meet him.  Darkness for Eternity… <BR>  <BR> -------------------------- <BR>  <BR> &quot;Bring her over here.&quot;  Lokus' voice was commanding, but full of concern.   <BR>  <BR> A flicker at the edge of her consciousness.  Another soul to be judged. <BR>  <BR> Lanneth got to his feet shakily, the pain in his body too great even to scream.  He looks up, and is astonished to see Mystere sitting on a throne of blackened smoke.  Her face is dispassionate, and her eyes vacant. <BR>  <BR> She looks down at the pathetic wretch in front of her.  The soul's aura tells all to its Mistress.  Death, self inflicted.  She smiled inwardly, careful not to show it outwardly.  It always pleased her when they wanted Death.  And when she was pleased, the Father was pleased. <BR>  <BR> The soul had more to tell, and did not go about its duty.  No matter, they did that occasionally.  Her Will was more than enough to send it on its way. <BR>  <BR> &quot;Mystere?&quot; the ranger began in confusion.  &quot;What's happened.&quot; <BR>  <BR> Another flicker at the edge of her consciousness….&quot;Help her dammit!&quot; Lokus' voice.  &quot;We're losing her.  Channel more power, dammit, I'm running out of mana.  Fight Mystere fight!!!&quot; <BR>  <BR> She dismisses the meaningless thoughts.  Father called them not-memories.  Shadows of a past that never existed.  She ignored them.  It always pleased Father. <BR>  <BR> She returned her attention to the soul.  Killed himself for love. <BR>  <BR> Another twinge, something…personal.  &quot;Lokus, she's gone.  Let her go,&quot; a sad voice, Sensi's. <BR>  <BR> For the first time in eons, Mystere spoke.  &quot;Lanneth of Tunare, ye have entered the Sacred Lands of Innoruuk.  A ranger of Tunare doth not belong in this place, begone.&quot; <BR>  <BR> &quot;Wait Mystere, I…&quot; his voice trailed off as she waved her hand. <BR>  <BR> &quot;I said BEGONE!&quot; the last boomed across the plane, resounding back.  With the voice brought incredible pain.  His soul was torn apart, and then folded before being ripped apart again. <BR>  <BR> Scream after scream was ripped from his soul until he finally realized he was back in his body, alive.  Alive again. <BR>  <BR> ------------------------------ <BR>  <BR> Father was displeased.  She'd never had Father angry with her before.  His wrath was terrible in its fury.  Her soul still showed angry white marks where he had Touched her.  Her skin still sizzled. <BR>  <BR> For now, Father was on the mortal realm, tracking down the soul she'd dismissed.  Even so, the storm of his wrath echoed here in the Deadlands, as soul after soul appeared before her briefly, then being carted off to being processed. <BR>  <BR> She shivered at the thought.  Processed souls ended up being forged into items the dead could use.  The soul lives on whilst in its new form. <BR>  <BR> Suddenly a small high elf girl approached the brooding Mistress.  &quot;Valsharess Thex?&quot; the girl asked timidly. <BR>  <BR> Mystere was in no mood for children.  &quot;On with ye child, before the Father finds ye here.&quot; <BR>  <BR> &quot;'Tis exactly my point M'Lady.  Ye shall come with me now.  Away from here.&quot; <BR>  <BR> Mystere looked at the child, ready to strike her down with her Will.  &quot;What is thy name, child?&quot; <BR>  <BR> The child smiled broadly.  &quot;I go by many names Valsharess, but ye would know me as Tunare.&quot; <BR>  <BR> Mystere rolled her eyes.  Lovely, a dead elf with a sense of humor.  She stood up, eyes blazing.  &quot;As I said, BEGONE!&quot; she cried, her voice booming across the plane again. <BR>  <BR> The child stood there and blinked.  There was a sudden crash of thunder, and the girl looked around.  &quot;Come quickly, he returns.&quot;  The girl offered Mystere her hand and without thinking she took it. <BR>  <BR> There was a rush of wind, and then the world exploded. <BR>  <BR> ----------------------------------- <BR>  <BR> &quot;I'm not giving up on her, she's not dead yet!&quot; <BR>  <BR> &quot;Lokus stop this madness!  Looked at her!  Even if she were living, there's nothing left of her body.  Please, give this up.&quot; <BR>  <BR> &quot;I saw her move dammit!&quot; <BR>  <BR> Lokus was exhausted, most of his mana depleted.  Next to him stood his wife Sensi, knowing the inevitable and pleading with her stubborn husband to accept things as they were. <BR>  <BR> Across from them both was Natashia, quietly summoning her diminishing power for yet another attempt at healing.  There was a small crash as she channeled her own energies into the unresponsive body. <BR>  <BR> She sighed with despair.  &quot;Lokus, she's right.  We've been at this for a half hour, and she's not so much as twitched.&quot; <BR>  <BR> &quot;No!&quot; he growled defiantly.  &quot;The body lives, we continue.  I just need a moment to regain some energy.&quot; <BR>  <BR> Silence fell as Lokus concentrated.  A few moments later, he started casting again.  Blue energy surrounded him and went to the body.  Again no response.  &quot;LIVE DAMN YOU!&quot; he screamed, slamming his fist into Mystere's chest. <BR>  <BR> There was a thunderclap just as the blow landed and Mystere screamed.  Blood curdling, insane screaming.  The pain was unrelenting. <BR>  <BR> And then all Hell broke loose. <BR>  <BR> &quot;She's alive, heal her!!&quot; <BR>  <BR> &quot;Stop grabbing my arm, I can't cast…&quot; <BR>  <BR> Sensi picked up a haunting melody and suddenly Mystere was alive with magic.  Her body fairly glowed with it.  Before their very eyes her wounds closed and her cracked and dried skin returned to its normal sheen. <BR>  <BR> And outside, rain and thunder pounded the small hut they were in, testimony to Innoruuk's fury. <BR>  <p>Mystere
