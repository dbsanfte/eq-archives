Pros cons</span><hr size=1> I thought it might be helpful to outline the pros and cons of why something should/shouldn't be reserveable. here are my thoughts. If you dont agree or have changes please add your own pros cons.<br>
<br>
Mob is reserveable: Opinion on which<br>
Pro<br>
Con<br>
<br>
Fire Giants: Cahnge to FFA<br>
Pro's: It is a training ground for smaller guilds to practice raid skills.<br>
<br>
Con's: <br>
With all the expansion's, there are plenty of places for potential raid leaders to hone their skills.<br>
The giants are doable by a single group or less.<br>
The giants are frequently not reserved on any given day.<br>
8 hour respawns mean that they can be done 2-3 times a day by interested parties.<br>
The loot on them is no longer significant compared to new items, The crown seems to be the most sought after item.<br>
<br>
<br>
Naggy, and Vox(resons are same for both): Remain as is.<br>
Pro's: <br>
Limit of 52 sets a practical limit on who can do these dragons.<br>
Lesser raid experience of these player's will be aided by the additional time to prepare.<br>
Their is no hardship in scheduling a date for these mobs.<br>
<br>
Con's: not having scheduled raids could mean that these mobs go down even less than they do currently.  <br>
<br>
Venril Sathir: Chane to FFa<br>
Pro's:<br>
He is a rare mob, those seeking to kill him for whatever reason will eventually get a turn.<br>
<br>
Con's:<br>
--He is exactly like drusilla in HS, but she is not reservable. Just not the same demand for her.<br>
--Doable by a single group or very small raid.<br>
--I've heard rumors about guild reserving epic items for those that are no where near able to complete their epic's. Ie lvl 45 wizards getting staff. I think this will just slow down the competition for these items.<br>
--His items are nice but not necessarily the best available at this time. (like drusilla and the nos). Not to say his loot isnt still rather nice.<br>
--Recent Changes will make him more accessible.(hopefully)<br>
<br>
Trakanon: Remain as is<br>
Pro's:<br>
--The list is not long, Therefore those seeking a turn are assured of one in a reasonable time.(may change eventually).<br>
--Needed element of VP key, which some are more able to utilize than others.<br>
--At this time I feel the current system works well to assure equal opportunity.<br>
--As more people level, I believe this mob will become more popular for a time, but interest will wane as vp keys are aquired, and new expansions are introduced.<br>
<br>
Cons: <br>
--Loot is average but nice. <br>
--None of the other dragons of like level are reservable.<br>
--<br>
<br>
Plane of Fear/Hate: Remain As is.<br>
Pro's: <br>
--Dates are readily available to anyone willing to put forth the effort to claim one.<br>
--Can only be clear once per day average, 3 times every 2 days, but hours are very odd.<br>
--It would be a shame to loose the raid feeling with individual camps for sepearate spawns occuring. <br>
--First real raid experience for high level players, still a nice training area for guild teamwork.<br>
--loot mobs are primarily needed by 50ish people who benefit from advance planning available with a scheduled system.<br>
--Higher level groups are unable to get to the higher mobs without reserving a date, and clearing out a significant portion of loot mobs which they no longer need. I think this would be exacerbated by a ffa system. This could be worked around by partnership raids.<br>
--Note: I dont believe Extending the Calendar to 3 weeks will help the situation. It will fill up 3 weeks, and you will still be forced to camp the board 3 weeks out for a date.<br>
<br>
Con's:<br>
--Higher level groups are unable to get to the epic and higher mobs without reserving a date. Could be worked around with partnership raiding.<br>
<br>
<br>
Plane of Air: Remain as is<br>
Pro's: <br>
--This plane is not in great demand to my knowledge. It is set up for 24 people. it requires a high level group to complete the plane.<br>

<br>
FGs and VS - NO change to FFA .. FCFS is how it should be.<br>
FFA means while you are buffing to take him out right outside his room another group or two can run down and CHARGE him leaving you there casting your last few buffs on 1 or 2 tanks.<br>
<br>
I do not advocate in any way shape or form FFA. I do believe in limits on how long you can claim first come. If you are sitting at the seb zoneline claiming chef asking for a cleric and a a chanter/bard for an hour .. you have no claim to FCFS of that camp. But if you are there fully grouped and just moving in it would be wrong IMHO for another party to come in and take what you were getting prepped for. <p><a href=http://www.etherealknighthood.com border=0><img src=http://home.kscable.com/ethereal/azzisig.gif></a><br><center>

Pros cons</span><hr size=1> Actually, your argument isn't accurate.<br>
<br>
The 'cons' you list for Fire Giants aren't Cons (as in negatives), they are alternative ideas that have no positive or negative value.<br>
<br>
The Con Azzi added is the only actual 'negative' being lumped into the FG issue... and its also false.<br>
<br>
Fire Giants have yet to make Ragefire stay spawned any length of time... so, Fire Giants are NOT causing fewer Cleric epics to hit the server.<br>
<br>
The FG reservations have impacted WHO got that epic on occaision (once this past weekend), but it did NOT cause a Ragefire spawn to either (A) go to waste, nor did it cause (B) Ragefire to sit idle.<br>
<br>
Were either of those points true, then yes Rage WOULD be a con for FG's... but they aren't true, so that con is not true.<br>
<br>
Additionally, the following pro of the FG system as it stands:<br>
<br>
Provides Nagafen raiders with some degree of certainty that Fire Giants wont be repopping in the middle of a Nagafen raid.  We KNOW the relative time of death and respawn because of the scheduled raids.  We KNOW that Fire Giants aren't raided on Naggy days without direct coordination with the Nagafen raid leader (who has precedence).  I imagine Magus Rokyl repopping in the middle of a Nagafen fight would be... bad.  I imagine that Fire Giants repopping as people logged in from buff circle could be... at the very least... a setback to a raid that already leans towards too long.<br>
<br>
For some reason that one gets overlooked... its too convenient to focus on FG reservations as the bottleneck (it isn't) and just making it FCFS will help your Cleric get their epic sooner (it WONT).<br>
<br>
1) Verants stated policy is NOT FFA/FCFS... the ACTUAL stated policy is a preference that players work out a system by themselves and maintain it... FCFS will only be enforced by Verant when the players have shown too little maturity to arrive at their own system... somehow that gets distorted by FFA advocates...<br>
<br>
2) Because very few players play eight hour sessions (see one of your CON's), the ability to reserve a spawn of this duration helps to assure that WHOMEVER wants to take a shot at it has some reason to believe that the creatures will be there when they go there.<br>
<br>
There ARE valid reasons for FCFS/FFA/and even reservations... however, nothing used as a 'reason' for FCFS in this thread has actually been one of them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm50.showMessage?topicID=7.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm50.showMessage?topicID=31.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm50.threadControl?topicID=10.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm50.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm50.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="brellserilisfrm48">Town Crier (Rules & Announcements)<option value="brellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion">The Commons (General EQ Discussion)<option value="brellserilisfrm56">Salutations & Congratulations <option value="brellserilisfrm50">Calendar Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm33">Dreams & Diversions (Off Topic)<option value="brellserilisfrm59">It Takes a Village...
