<br>
BA:  I've been with you on prexus for a LONG time, and you know it.  Posts like this are the basis for those &quot;heart to heart&quot; talks you and I have had over the last several months.  Do you see this?  Do you see that this only perpetuates it?<br>
<br>
Try as I might to ignore this thread, the more I read and re-read, the more fired up I got, so, throwing caution to the wind, inviting flames and rants galore, here goes.  This is only my opinion, and I'm sure I'm speaking out of turn.  This is directed to my friend, Fielder/Ballad/Backalley, and noone else.  <br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
BA Said:<br>
My anger is over the lack of concern for other people in the game, not jealousy over what other guilds can do.<br>
<br>
I can assure you, Unity is not jealous of any guild on Prexus.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
BA Said:<br>
Also, the &quot;rules&quot; established by who? Seems to me the rules that kept Stasis from doing Trakanon/ CT/ Dain is what started this whole FCFS mess. Who decides who can do what? With how many people? The largest/best equipped guilds? <br>
<br>
Short of the Verant &quot;play nice policy&quot; there are no rules.  Prexus did previously have a calendar system, but from what I understand it is all but gone now.  Each individual guild decides what they can/will/wont do.  Number of people is their decision.  And, here comes the painful part...the largest/best equipped guilds will always, with very few exceptions, kill more, and higher &quot;quality&quot; mobs  faster than smaller/less equipped guilds.  Regardless of rotations, calendars, or &quot;common courtesy&quot;.  This, I can assure you, whether there is ill-intent or not...it's just going to be that way.  Sorry to be so honest, but it needed to be said.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
BA Said:<br>
If I believed they might act outside self interest Id probably be ok with that. But the alliance between Unity and KTF to keep EA out of Sleepers squashes that idea. <br>
<br>
*sigh*  Anything we've done with broods with KTF was done to get Unity INTO sleeper's tomb, not keep anyone else out.  Why is everything we do always taken by you as a personal affront to &quot;keep IV down&quot;?  It's not about IV, really it's not.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
BA Said:<br>
Fact is those with the most to gain/lose in a position of power to control things have a huge responsiblity. If they fail in that responsibility, when claiming to want to get along with everyone, they lose credibility. KTF has gone a long way to getting that back, Unity doesnt bother.<br>
<br>
It's a game.  I am confused over what responsibility you think I have to any other guild than my own?   Is that selfish?  Or loyal?  I would argue it merely depends on your point of view.  Things I do for Unity seem loyal to me, and apparantly selfish to you.  Can you explain this &quot;responsibility&quot; I have?<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
BA Said:<br>
Right now, KTF and Unity are sharing NTOV, Im not sure where PDF fits in there, but who else would be &quot;allowed&quot; to do NTOV?<br>
<br>
I can assure you, that KTF_Officer_04 did NOT send a tell to Unity_officer_09 and say &quot;Gee, you know, KTF would like to have only half the NTOV loot, would you like to have the other half?&quot;  We weren't &quot;allowed&quot; to &quot;share&quot;  NTOV with anyone.  Without getting into specifics, we earned it, same as we have everything we have ever done.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
BA Said:<br>
They arent any more special than anyone else in the game, but because they are allowed to practice on these mobs now, unimpeded by anyone else, many more guilds will feel this kind of pressure when they decide they want to try NTOV<br>
<br>
This statement sounds to me like you believe certain guilds have been handed everything in the game to them on a silver platter.  Spoon fed from the loot gods at Verant.  Other than being quicker out of the gate, how are any of these guilds &quot;allowed&quot; to do anything with any mob?  This frequent use of the word &quot;allowed&quot; bothers me a bit.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
BA Said:<br>
Yes Snarfo, once again you show that your dislike for us motivates you and your guild to do the things you do. Has nothing to do with our capabilities...has everything to do with being allowed to learn and compete with you guys, something you dont want<br>
<br>
I can't speak for Snarfo, but I take that as meaning you think the entire Unity force's sole intent is based upon some deep-seated hatred for you and your guild.  Is that not a bit egotistic?  BA, seriously, how many times a hour/day/week do you think IV is mentioned in Unity guildchat?  I hate to say it, but not as many as you might think.  Fried Cheese might be mentioned as often.  We do things as Unity, for Unity, and with Unity, not IV, or any other guild.  Why did KTF release the sleeper?  To keep Unity, EA, StasisFrog, et al from getting Primal?  Or SoDs?  Or that GD Gnome mask I'll never have now?  No, if you know anything about them, then you will have to agree, their sole purpose was a sense of accomplishment for themselves, and it wasn't motivated by any other guild on the server.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
BA Said:<br>
Yes, we could have done Doze first, but we didnt. Being the only people in HOT, and being their first, we didnt assume someone would come for one mob and cause the shitstorm that Unity did<br>
<br>
You were there several hours before you attempted Doze.  When Unity members began zoning in is when some of your guildchat turned to thoughts of Doze &quot;before Unity&quot;.  I know this for a fact, no debate needed.  You also can't assume that since any player/group/guild is not attacking some mob, that that mob is &quot;off limits&quot; to anyone for any reason.  Just short of calling a GM and invoking PNP, every mob is FCFS, and I think you know this.  That Doze that night was in no way motivated by what your guild was or was not doing.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
BA Said:<br>
&quot;...guess Nameless, KTF and Unity run our officers meetings too now&quot;<br>
<br>
Does that mean IV run's Unity's meetings too?  Seems you know a lot about our &quot;motives&quot; and &quot;directions&quot;.  All these so called &quot;allowances&quot; that we've been &quot;given&quot; by other guilds makes me believe you know more about our leadership than I do.  If that's the case, maybe I'm fooling myself, but I strongly believe that it is not.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
BA Said:<br>
a time limit on who can do HOT now? Says who? Oh I get it, we cant do it as fast as KTF or Unity, so we arent allowed to...when exactly will we be allowed to? Oh yeah, when Unity doesnt need HOT named anymore...<br>
<br>
Unity, and several other guilds, will need/want Doze and Named and HoT for quite a while yet, believe me.  I have had the beginnings of a quest in my bank for over four months now, so don't try to fool anyone into believing that these mobs are old news.  And again with the &quot;allowed, allowed, allowed&quot; *sigh*<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
BA Said:<br>
Gdamn you guys are paranoid, how is our getting to a mob before you, hell maybe before you even knew it was up, and having a wipeout constitute camping a @#%$ mob with a corpse<br>
<br>
Specifically with Doze, I can guarantee you we knew he was up, and it's naive to think we (and KTF, and EA, and PDF) didn't.  If some people have said you &quot;camped&quot; some mob blahblahblah, then I don't agree with them.  I know, all too well, that you are being truthful when you tell these prexus.com folk that what IV did with doze was a legitimate attempt at a new mob that unfortunately failed the first time.  BTW Grats on finally killing him!!  That's cool!<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
BA Said:<br>
Wamp what you dont see is this kind of courtesy IS done between KTF, Unity and others....they have their rotations to keep this from happening. Thats why you dont see Unity AND KTF fighting in NTOV all the time, they worked it out so they can do the halls unmolested. Had Unity and Nameless invited us to the rotation they have on the nameds in HOT we would have HAPPILY participated. We were in favor of the calendar as long as it was followed by everyone. Thats why Nameless and Unity dont fight over the named in HOT, they rotate them.<br>
If that kind of &quot;courtesy&quot; is only allowed other guilds, yes it bothers us as it would bother anyone else<br>
<br>
I know this goes both ways, but hear me out...when's the last KTF vs Unity flame you saw on Prexus.com?  Or in game?  We have a working relationship that allows us to not step on each other's toes.  This relationship, while not perfect, tends to work fairly well in most cases.  Yes, there are mobs that KTF routinely offs that we don't get many/any shots at...yet.  And again, I'm confused...what do you think warrants such an &quot;invite&quot; into any sort of rotation?  Number of players?  Equipment?  Level?  Accomplishments?  Merely being there?  Warm bodies?  That gets me back to the horror of the calendar system.  It goes back to everyone trying to be Chief of the Fairness Police.  I don't mean to sound harsh, egotistic, or elitist, because I'm not, but I just don't see where any player in this game owes anyone anything, because it is just that...A GAME.  This world is ever-increasingly filled with some sense of entitlement...that someone OWES me something...not based on anything other than &quot;because I'm there&quot; or &quot;because it's fair&quot;.  No, nobody likes a bully, and I'm not advocating that AT ALL, but there has to be some sense of EARNING for the &quot;accomplishment&quot; to really feel like an accomplishment, hasn't there?  At least that's all I ever remember hearing when Unity went to Fear for CT several months ago.  How many people posted on that thread &quot;I don't care, I don't do Fear just for the loot, I don't want to be handed items without having EARNED them, I want to do the plane myself&quot;  Is this doublespeak?  Cake and eat it too?  Is it them being selfish?  Egotistic?  Greedy?<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
BA Said:<br>
All this hatred of us by him and those like minded is based in greed and a total disregard for others<br>
<br>
I really shouldn't be speaking for Snarfo here, and I'M NOT, I'm just speculating....have you ever known someone that had certain buttons that could be pushed that set them off?  I think your buttons may be being pushed, for nothing more than to get a rise out of you.  You're fanning the fire everytime this sh9t gets stirred up.  Then again, maybe Snarfo is a bitter bastard that hates you and your guild...who knows  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   /wave Snarfo!<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
BA Said:<br>
The only way to keep away the up and coming guilds is to force the worst kind of FCFS on them to keep them from learning mobs they need to learn, to do fights they need to do. Make no mistake, walking over corpses after one attempt on a mob is very much a delay tactic, designed to keep guilds from learning how to fight mobs others have had exclusive access to for months<br>
<br>
BA, I'm hurt to think you feel that we, as a guild, as players, and as people, have nothing more meaningful on our minds that &quot;keeping the little guy down&quot;.  For g-d's sake, we were in the Boars together.  I was a charter member.  We were quite possibly the best bad guild out there.  Unorganized, unknowledgable, undisciplined, yet we managed to pull off some pretty neat sh9t for what we had to work with....and GDammit, we had fun doing it.  This is the same feeling I get with Unity.  It's the same feeling I had in the early days of the Boars, and is the only thing keeping me in the game.  I pray to G-D that you can find some sollace in some part of the game, and stop feeling like you're being picked on by the schoolyard bully.  Please, take it from me, a friend, that that is NOT what we are about.  It's not a topic of conversation, it's not in our guild charter, it's not ever even discussed, with regard to IV, KTF, PDF, or any other guild in the game.  Please believe me and try to find some fun in this game.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Still your friend,<br>
