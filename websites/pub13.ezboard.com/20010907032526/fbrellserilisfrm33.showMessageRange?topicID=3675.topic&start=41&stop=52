<br>
<br>
What I am trying to say is that a person usually has to be &quot;ill&quot; to commit such an act, an act that goes against our very nature. This sickness of the soul can be caused by circumstances, environment or simply the body's chemistry fighting them. It's a mental health issue and there is where far too many people have no tolerance, sympathy or understanding.<br>
<br>
Do we name-call and condemn the sick? Are they really any different than a person with a failing kidney or cancer? Are they weak because some part of them is not functioning properly?<br>
<br>
We are human not animals. We don't need everyone to be perfect in order to take down that wildebeast for the pack. We can show some care, really it's okay....doesn't make you &quot;weak&quot; to be caring.<br>

<br>
I disagree to an extent.  Humans are one of the few, if only, species that CAN willingly end their existance.  I don't consider the people who choose it to be &quot;ill.&quot;  In a way, I find that assertion to be more condemning than those of us who've referred to it as a choice of weakness.<br>
<br>
At least we're still allowing that the person who made the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> choice</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> made A choice.  Citing it as a mental illness or some other sickness removes the responsibility from the person... they were &quot;sick&quot;.  <br>

<br>
And that's what I'm talking about... I realize this runs the risk of an inflammatory remark, but that opinion is FAR more condescending... they're not functioning properly?  That's a VERY blanket statement to make, and for many people a far, far worse assesment than being thought of as weak.<br>
<br>
I'll allow that chemical imbalances and certain psychological illnesses probably contribute to some suicides... but... I'd NEVER venture that 100% of suicides are ill.   <br>
<br>

<br>
Interestingly, the notion of finding someone weak, or determining that someone is &quot;ill,&quot; or the idea that there's some malaise of the soul is the same... we're all trying to comprehend something none of us can directly and truly comprehend... why.  We are all ascribing reasons, and all of us are making blanket statements.. which by their very nature are incorrect as they assume some high level of accuracy.<br>
<br>
I'd also venture that as most every person responding to this thread have been touched to some degree by a suicide, lack of caring is HARDLY a reason for response here... generally I read it as the opposite, everyone in this thread on topic has responded because they DO care, they have been effected, they don't clearly understand why... and as humans always do, we seek to understand and explain.<br>
<br>
Which is hardly crass or cruel.<br>

   Hey everyone =) I just wanted to put my two cents in on this, Yes, some people have been very crass and callous aboiut htis issue in these posts, and some have been very understanding, also, but seriously, the taking of ones own life goes beyond 'a cry for help', the damage is done. Over. Fini. Now your dead, the pains over, hurray! or is it ? What about family? Friends? OH NO, guess what? The pain is NOT over, not for them. So to anyone comtemplating the taking of their own life... GET over it!,please, cos Thats not the right answer <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  If you want the pain to end, fix it! cos killing yourself is on;ly gonna make more pain. ANd if you dont care what others feel, you've just gone and proved the people that say your selfish right.<br>
<br>
   I am all for doing ALL i can for someone that life sucks, and I will do anything for them, but the first thing ill do is bitch slap them, and tell them what i just told yall, then we can talk about it, and try and sort things out. The person that needs help must first be willing to accept it.<br>

Or animals that are injured or hurt and will go of on their own to die.  I have heard of animals that cared about one of their own kind enough that they would mourn themselves to death.  I don't think animals are a good match here.  The animal kingdom is full of stories like that.  Whales that beach themselves and make no attempt to go back to sea, etc...<br>

<br>
But speaking of sorrow for the animal kingdom.. <br>
Have any of you ever read the book, Where the Red Fern Grows&quot;? It is one of the most touching books I've ever read. It talks about a boy growing up in the mountains with his family. His main hobby/way of life is to go out raccoon hunting and sell thier pelts. Anyhow, he ends up with these two dogs, Dan and Sarah. (I think Sarah is her name.. ) They become one of the best 'coon dogs in his part of the county, and he becomes a very good 'coon hunter. <br>
Then one day up in the mountains chasing after a raccoon, a mountain lion jumps him, and his two dogs start fighting it to save the boy's life. The two dogs finally either kill it or chase it off ( I can't remember), but Dan suffers a fatal wound. The lion's claws sliced open Dan's belly and the boy has to carry the poor dog back home. His mother sews the dog's stomach back up, but the poor dog dies a few days later. His female companion, Sarah, mourns so badly for Dan's death that she doesn't eat at all for weeks. She crawls up to Dan's grave and lays there until she finally passes away in starvation/agony. The boy buries Sarah next to Dan, and when he returns to thier grave the next spring, he sees a rare red fern growing between the two graves. <br>
<br>
It's based on a true story I believe, but it does show a very accurate picture of an animal suffering emotionally so bad that it gives up it's life. <br>
<br>
I believe dogs are very capable of this emotion. Dogs become very attached to thier masters, and will do anything to prevent harm from them. Even at the cost of thier own life. When something tragic happens, you can tell that the dog suffers emotionally. <br>
<br>
I've also heard of elephants being the same way. Elephants are very VERY social animals, and thier herds are like families are to us. When an elephant passes on, it's very evident that the rest of the herd mourns for the death of the lost one.<br>
<br>
Humans, however.. are far different. Humans tend to be much more succeptable to emotional stress than animals, and react far more deeply to it.<br>

Intellectually, I know that attempted (and succesful in some cases) suicide are cries for help.

One thing about death is that you get to live again, and this time you get to ask yourself:<br>
'Is my life worth perpetuating the way I have lived it up to this point?'<br>
I have felt like I was going to reach my limits for pain, but I never have. I realized I never would because limits and pain are like the sun. They feel like they are burning you, blinding you, bearing down on you. And outta the entire sky stare at it and it hurts you more. But it's really 93 million miles away, only covers a miniscule part of the sky, and isnt even there half the time.<br>
So what's truly important for you to carry on? Its something I seek inside myself, but every now and then you have to cleanse whats unnecessary. This is not always easy to do, so use alcohol but only if you must.<br>
