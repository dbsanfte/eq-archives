But don't just post some garbage about I disagree.  I want to know why, when, where, how, what.  The problems here are not going to be fixed without some actual input.<br>
<br>
FG's should be reservable.  Think about when you were just getting big enough to go on these raids.  Did it help to get to go?  Would you rather the giants all be permanently dead and you never got a chance to try and learn.<br>
<br>
Naggy/Vox/Planes.  Come on.  Why is it so hard to make a reservation for these things.  I see what some are saying about 100  guilds fighting for the spawn and the chance to do this.  The fact is that the system is still working for these raids.  I have not been to an exorbitant number of these events, but have seen that the guilds follow the rotation with minimal damage to toes.<br>
<br>
I really don't see what all the fuss is about.  There is a system in place where people can go and see that so-and-so's guild has an intention of doing a run at one of these areas.  This tells them that someone has most likely put forth effort to make this happen thus letting them know what times and dates they can PLAN to make a raid as well.  <br>
<br>
This can seem restrictive to the 100's of people that are sitting around with friends saying, &quot;Hey, I'm bored.  Lets go raid PoF&quot;.  This of course (correct me if I'm wrong) takes some time to prepare for and not the kind of thing you really want to do on the spur of the moment.  The larger guilds can probably do that, but not all the time.  What happens once their members get all the planes drops they need.  They go to other places like PoG and VS of course.  Thus leaving an empty place for other guilds to enter the rotation.<br>
<br>
The whole thing is that in the next 2 months, their is going to be a lot of people that are going to be high enough level to do these.  Of these people, a good number of them are going with alts.  Not their main or first character.  A true noobie is hard to find these days.<br>
<br>
So, with the new Velious, all the &quot;L33T&quot; guilds will slowly stray that direction.  Simply because of the better loot opportunities.  The calendar will take some bumps and bruises along the way, but will right itself and soon we will need a rotation for different areas.  At first, those will be hard to manage (just like the VS list) but will find away to fix itself.  <br>
<br>
Why do you think Verant comes up with new additions to this game.  They love your 10 smackers and want you to continue to pay it.  The level cap will be raised just as mob levels will be raised and new places will be considered supreme for one to adventure in.<br>
<br>
The calendar system works.  It has been working and will continue to work if you let it.  Anyone can find faults with it.  If we all put the effort forth to respect the other persons on the server that also need to participate in these areas, everything will work out fine.  If you feel that you are not going on enough planes raids or naggy runs then maybe your reputation as an upstanding citizen of Norrath are not as good as you think.<br>
<br>
If you don't agree.  Post actual reasons why it would be advantageous for at the average player to make the server FFA and FCFS. <br>
<br>
I would also like to add that I really respect what Minute has done in copying the board.  It shows how much he really cares about the Brell community and I for one applaud him in his efforts.<br>

<br>
When I had FG booked a few weeks back, a cleric from watchers guild was camping ragefire for a long time, and he spawned a few hours before my riad, so of course, it was theirs, since being a cleric, I know how long I have waited to get to rage, and this cleric, waited alot longer than me.<br>
He did the honorable thing and got in touch with me before hand, and still would have waited there for me to finish my raid and then take out rage, however, knowing the current system, I was affraid that somebody else would have just walked over my raid and taken it from him, so I told him, all yours bro.<br>
<br>
One big problem all the sudden with FG is the fact that rage spawns there.  He can pop any time after naggy dies, and is a pop that can take from 0-72 hours I guess.  50 clerics out there waiting for this spawn for a long time, some, loose all respect cause of greed and just over run anybody there.<br>
<br>
I will continue to book these FG under the present rules, but I really wish that this spawn would just move outta here, that would solve the damn problem.<br>

To do the one logical thing. Speed up spawn rates on the old school mobs. It used to be FG's etc were hard to kill now they are an easy 1hour to 2hour walk-through. I have been looking forward to raiding Vox/Naggy giants etc since i started roughly one year 6 months ago on Brell. When I did my first FG raid I thought to myself wtf Lguk is rougher. This was done with three groups 53 was the high. I think if spawn rate was increased say halved FG's etc would be very viable as a reservable mob. As they are now... hell no verant imho needs to rethink old-world zones. I would love to go on naggy/vox raids just to do it. But gettin on a raid for one is rough. Even at 48 getting into a dragon raid in oldworld is damn tough as most guilds can handle the dragons without pick-ups. Which means the pickly pear i need for my life leach quest will be very hard to get. Just my opinion. Trust me I am in full support of the res system I just think verant needs to listen to the player base and adjust. <p>Aaelania 47 Knight o' Death <br>Dracaena Arcanum<br>90 percent of the time I really am lost</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usstiyrr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sstiyrr</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The KungFu Leezard</span><br>  Posts: 304<br> <font color=#CC9900>(6/27/01 3:52:04 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Wheres the love (Revised)</span><hr size=1> Once the Reservation System handles the timezone problem in a fair way for all timezones, then i possibly could agree.<br>

I thought the prickly pear comes off of a mob in front of Vox, and not Vox herself.  Since those mobs spawn fairly quickly, Vox doesn't even have to be up for you to get your prickly pear.  There should be no reason why you would have to wait to get your pear, unless there is a Vox raid the day you want to go get it (and they don't let you join in), but that leaves 6 other days a week you can go in there with your guild and get it.<br>
<br>

why people are so concerned about having *one* non-planar camp (FGs) that has the possibily of reservation -- is beyond me<br>

I think some people at these boards think that most of Brells lower level population are just twinked alts.<br>
