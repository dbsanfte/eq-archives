<br>
Saffryn is sharing cornered with her aunt and uncle Hearthwood at their tavern recounting the exciting day she had hunting with Aegeras when in walks &quot;Mr. Bramblepants&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah Gah, there he is again, everywhere I go,&quot; Saffy says to her aunt and uncle.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who, Wardrym? He's a nice fellow, let me introduce you,&quot; says her uncle, Manlawen, as he motions for Wardrym to come over as Saffryn cringes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hail Wardrym Nobleheart, I'd like you to meet my niece, Saffryn Trueshot.  Saffy, this is Ward,&quot; says Manlawen.<br>
<br>
As Ward bows to Saffy she quips &quot;Nobleheart, not Nobleheart of the Felwithe Paladin's guild?  You dunna look like any hauty, er high-elf to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Saffy!  Ya need nah be rude!&quot; says her aunt, Uuilanu.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry, yur lordship, but the Koada'Dal have nah been very well thought of as late with the rise in taxes and all,&quot; exclaims Saffy with a raised brow.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's alright m'lady, I completely understand.  I am in disagreement with workings of Felwithe, myself.  As for my looks, well, I find the clothing and the lifestyle of the Feir'Dal to be much more comfortable and practical...and I do not cling to any titles so please, no &quot;lordship&quot; here.<br>
<br>
With a look and a grin to each other, Saffryn's aunt and uncle move back to take care of other customers coming into the tavern and leave the two to get to know each other.  Watching them go, Ward purses his lips together and decides to plunge in.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, now that we've met, m'lady&quot; begins Ward and is interrupted by Saffryn, &quot;No m'lady's here either.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;All right then,&quot; Ward continues, &quot;Saffryn.  I've been looking for you.<br>
<br>
&quot;Following me, ya mean,&quot; as she takes a drag from her ale.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well yes, I had to see if you had the qualities I'm looking for.  I need your help.&quot; says Ward.<br>
<br>
&quot;My help?  What would a Lord of Nobleheart need with a lowly woodie like me?&quot; smarts off Saffy.  Then remembering her manners, &quot;Sorry.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;This must be strictly confidential, on your word as a Feir'Dal,&quot; says Ward.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well if you hold the word of a Feir'Dal to any value, yes, I give you my word.  What is this help you need.&quot;<br>
<br>
With a deep breath, he looks Saffy in the eye and says, &quot;I think the Book of Law has been corrupted.  It's quite obvious that the Koada'Dal use it to their full advantage over the Baronrys, but I think that they have an extra advantage.  I think they have altered the words that were set forth by our Goddess, Tunare.  I mean to find out the truth of this and set things right.&quot;<br>
<br>
Looking astonished, &quot;Now why on Norrath would you want to do that?  You're own father would have you gutted from jaw to groin, I'd wager.  What reason would you have to go against your own people for the sake of mine?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Because I have a secret of my own that I'm not ready to reveal at this time,&quot; answers Ward.  &quot;I've taken Willowswood as my own and I have no intention of following in my father's footsteps, save that of my paladin training.  He was very cruel to my mother and sent her to an early grave.  The Princes live in an endless cycle of debauchery and celebration in their luck at being born in the lap of Felwithe.   It sickens me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Really hate Prince Joren, eh?&quot; says Saff.  &quot;You are in good company.  He lauds his heavy hand over the Emerald Warriors and leaves them to do the dirty work while the Felwithe warriors get the better duties and the Paladins act the officers and rule them all.  So...why do you need me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The original Book of Law was magically written by Tunare, herself and cannot be added to or anything taken away.  It's been hundreds of years since the public has seen the Book.  We all see copies, but only a select few have access to the original.  I mean to have a look at that tome, see what it REALLY says so I can decide from there what to do.&quot; says Wardrym.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who are the select few who can see the book,&quot; Saff asks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Only the guild-leaders and their heirs, five leaders and their heirs.&quot; replies Wardrym<br>
<br>
&quot;Well you're the heir, are you not, Prince Joren is the guild-leader of Pally's.&quot; says Saffryn.<br>
<br>
&quot;My father does not quite trust me.  We haven't been close, ever.  He has showed no intention of training me to follow him as his heir even though I have been publicly and lawfully named as such.  He does not bring me to any of their political functions, and has not given me access to any 'sensitive' matters. &quot; says Wardrym.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, you are going to sneak your way in?&quot; says Saffryn.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes&quot; replies Wardrym.<br>
<br>
&quot;Any traps?  Secret Passages?  Magic locks?&quot; asks Saffryn.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes&quot; replies Wardrym.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then what you need is a rogue from the Scout's guild, not me,&quot; she says as she begins to stand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait!, there's more,&quot; Ward says quickly.<br>
<br>
Sitting she says, &quot;I'm listening.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nervously he continues, &quot;If I'm right about what I've discovered so far, your family is involved.  I need you, a Trueshot to get to the Book,&quot; he lies as Saffryn looks at him unconvinced.<br>
<br>
With a heavy sigh and crossed fingers that she'll accept the false tale he's about to weave, he continues, &quot;The Trueshots weren't always rangers, Saffryn.  There is a book of lineage that came with us from Tunaria.  In it, it shows that before the Houses were divided into Koada'Dal and Feir'dal and specialized, there were Trueshot wizards.  Some of the Trueshots lived in Takish-Hur.  The majority lived in the forest and that's why your family house went with the Fier'dal, but there was one very important Trueshot wizard, the wizard that set the final lock that seals the sacred tome, our Book of Law.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;There is a secret trick to the lock,&quot; Wardrym contines, &quot;that all the of the Koada'Dal heirs learn upon their father or mother's death. I don't know what the secret is that trips the lock without setting off the traps, however, the lock is said to answer to an Heir of the Trueshot wizard without question. I need YOU.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay,&quot; says Saffryn, &quot;let's say I believe this, hypothetically, why me - why not one of my brothers.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Because your brothers are older and busy with more important conflicts in Norrath than just the Crushbone Orcs,&quot; Ward answers.  &quot;I doubt they'd give me the time of day.  On top of that, with age, everyone in the Baronry's have a love of taking everything to committee and having meetings before deciding on anything.  If I approached one of your brothers, next thing I'd know there would be a meeting of the Baronry's about it and nothing would get done.  You know that. On top of that, it would leak out from there to the Koada'Dal and my plans would be blown.  I'd never get to the truth.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And you don't think I'LL take it to commitee?&quot; Saffryn asks wryly.<br>
<br>
&quot;No&quot; answers Wardrym.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why?&quot; asks Saffryn.<br>
<br>
&quot;Did you tell anyone about your cousin, Drynil, who was supposed to watch over you on your excursion to Freeport to get those Firebeetle Eyes, that she spent the whole time drinking in the taverns and inns and not protecting you?<br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; answers Saffryn.<br>
<br>
&quot;You can keep a secret, and get the job done.  I've been watching you, you know.&quot; says Wardrym.<br>
<br>
&quot;Following me, yes, I know.&quot; replies Saff <br>
<br>
&quot;You move like a rogue.  You're silent when you aren't popping that tree-tar gum you always have in your mouth.  You track like an aged expert.  You never waste time or movement.  You're sense of direction is uncanny...&quot; <br>
<br>
Saffryn interrupts, &quot;compared to YOU'RE skill at sleuthing, no doubt, but enough of trying to puff up my ego,&quot; she grins as she sees a vision in her head of &quot;Mr. Bramblepants waving his arms wildly behind a cactus in Freeport, trying to hide with a spell.   &quot;What's in it for me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You sure you aren't a mercenary rogue?&quot; asks Wardrym as he senses he's won her over.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mercenary, maybe, rogue,&quot; she reples with a pirate-smile, &quot;nay, just a humble ranger.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, sorry, humble ranger, no loot that I know of, but, if I'm right, if what I beleive is in that book, or rather what is NOT in that book - we may get all the baronrys out from under the thumbs of the Princes of Koada'Dal, once and for all.&quot; <p><center> <img src="http://www.myezboard.com/projects/ezboard/ezboard_userimages/theorderofthewhitehand/images/oldsig.jpg"><br><b>Saffryn, Ranger of Norrath<b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#403C50><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubrioscometfyre01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brios Cometfyre01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/4/02 1:19:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=531.topic&index=21>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Politics of Elves</span><hr size=1> Nice story <p>Brios Cometfyre<br>
