  Now I know we all would like to have the perfect groups for a Planer Raid, but, my question is this.<br>
<br>
 For Fear,based on the number of Enchanters you have, what is the LEAST you would go ahead on a Fear raid with?<br>
<br>
 I have been to 2 Fear Raids one had 4, the last only had 2.<br>
Now ,I dont know how many of you know what an Enchanter's role entails..But, we give clarity,Sltw&gt;Swift Like the Wind,Rune, Insight,Brilliance,Single mez and crowd mez,Theft of thought, Tash, we have a line of Stuns..Group MR and a line of bebuffers.<br>
<br>
 So, would you, go ahead with a raid that only had 2 enchanters for Fear??without thinking it was a suicide mission? hehe and please,can I have some honest answers,and not ego ones..and how much importance  do you place on your Enchanters on what they can handle..i.e. When i say I  can't handle all this, it's not to say  I am complaining of the workload,BUT..for realistic reasons I, as an Enchanter do not think I can best serve my team AND to be able to say I had a good time when over half the time I am doing CR, due to fizzles, resist's and someone breaking mez and the mob come after me,or being OOM and the people sending me tells for clarity or speed  think I just pull the mana out of my pocket<br>
<br>
   Anyway, some honest answers and not ridicule, would be very much appreciated. <p>Adenia Reviel 51th Illusionist<BR>Second in Command and Recruiting Officer of<BR>Twilight Marauders</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unadiabrell.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nadia brell</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Traveller of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 233<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/4/01 4:24:01 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~karl23/_images/nadia60.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Best Team., the Worst team for a Fear raid</span><hr size=1> I've been on many Fear raids where there was only 1 enchanter<br>

I have already seen fear done with only one chanter (he do clarity when he had time and shaman was doing speed)<br>
I guess that with a good bard or by kitting mobs you can even do Fear without chanter.<br>
But 2 is the least you need for a &quot;classic&quot; raid in good condition more can be useful but dont add much (but it help if one chanter dont show or if one need leave early...)<br>

2 for pull team (seems that the pull enchanter has one of the more dangerous jobs, so adding a second ecnhater to pull as a back up seems to have worked well)Then one in camp for speed and one in camp for Clarity.<br>
<br>
But seems 2 is a standard(one for pull team and one for clarity and speed when mana permits). <br>

<br>
A 55+ chanter with epic can mostly handle keeping all tanks hasted, &amp; mobs CC's.  I have done fear several times where I played both Adun pulling, &amp; Keigan on primary CC/buffs.  (Anyone out there remember those days?  /shout Okay, you've got 30 seconds to come get clarity, then I'm pulling again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
Depends on your puller too.  It's possible to pull fear in a manner that doesn't require Chanters at all.  But it sucks to not have clarity/haste.  It's also more work for the puller, and it means you basically need a ranger or a druid to do it.<br>
<br>
If you've got a 54+ chanter that's used to fear, 1 chanter is fine.  A backup chanter to do haste/clarity would be helpful too. <p><img src="http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/sadune.jpg" width="400" height="175"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uselilya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>selilya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Winnower of the Harvest</span><br>  Posts: 363<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/4/01 8:18:47 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/selilya/sel_head.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Best Team., the Worst team for a Fear raid</span><hr size=1> Don't forget the other classes can contribute to the traditional enchanter role.  Shaman do all kinds of good things (love that slow!), mages can crank out mod rods if needed, and necro's can do tons of things...mana feeds, Screaming Terror if they have to (limited time mez), nullify magic.  And I know the other casting classes have tasks they contribute as well.<br>

<br>
Basically, as Adune said, the less enchanters you have, the more discretion you have to use while pulling.  If you've got an overabundance of people, levels and / or crowd control, pull them 10 at a time, if you're raid is primarily levels 46-50 and you've only got 2 5 mobs at a time.<br>
<br>
The first time I did it (WoW raid, Thanksgiving '00), I kept a 24 person raid in clarity and augment, had a necro glued to my butt for the whole raid and the pull ranger and druid kiting and pulling in 2-3's sets for mezzing. (I was level 48 so mezzing the more resistant mobs was still a pain).<br>
<br>
Basically, for optimal performance, you want a 54th+ enchanter for Croud control and C2 on the clerics and main buffers one other enchanter for haste &amp; clarity on the tanks and other casters.<br>
<br>
If you've got a larger raid, 30-36 people, you might want to add a 3rd enchanter so that you can use more superior forms of haste, but that's more of a luxury than an essential.<br>
<br>
I guess this post should've just read &quot;what Adune said&quot;. *shrug*<br>

We had to fight for the safe spot on the North wall in the midst of ressing the rest of the raid.  We had a few mobs in camp and we were ressing and joining the fight as fast as we could.  Everyone who had any healing abilities at all were healing.  When one valient warrior dropped, he was immediately ressed and thrown back into the carnage.  We finally gained the upperhand at the safe spot and took control of the area.  The going was very slow.  When we finally did get to the first house, we were asked to go to help an ill fated Naggy raid.  Our plan was to come back after Naggy and finish Fear.<br>
<br>
We went to SolB, the zone went down, then the server went down, but this was a very tight raid, the action was non-stop and intense and the teamwork was inspiring.<br>

it doesnt matter how many enchanter you have, how many anything you have, just gota make it work with what you have, though im sure it would be easyer on your chanter if there were 2-4 there, but the majority of chanters i have met like the challenge or they wouldnt be a chanter<br>

P.S.  It's the team that makes or breaks the raid, not the chanter.  Chanter certainly makes it much easier, but in truth, there is NO class in the game (for fear) that ya can't make do somehow else with instead.  That includes a cleric for fear.

The only reason you were doing CR lots of times is cause we (me and Casben) fucked up.  Originally we had a shaman in pull team to do backup heal for the cleric.  Several of the druids who signed up did not show and the Shaman who was to be in pull did not either.  We erroniously figured the cleric could keep pull alive, and found out that it was just no possible due to the level of the pull group.  <br>
<br>
Nobody's skills were off or compromized, it's just that when it takes 3 or 4 mez's to get one to stick, things get pissed and the cleric just could not heal fast enought to keep either you or the other chanter alive + the tanks pulling.<br>
<br>
It was our fault for not sticking me back in pull in the shaman's place.  We mistakenly thought one of the tank groups with no healer would be better served and in reallity, they hardly needed a heal all night.  Right after the Fetid Feind house we figured that out and I moved up to pull as a single person to help heal.  That still didn't work all that great as I was not in group to do Group Chloro and quickly see who was going down.  After the ranger left (he was added in place of the shaman per request of the puller, also a ranger), anyway, after he left and I was added to pull team as a group member if you recall things went much better.  Cleric was able to heal tanks/chanters and I was able to heal cleric/chanters...things ran much smoother with a backup healer.<br>

Sorry you had a bad time...next time we run a Fear raid, please come join us again.  We'll know better (it was our first one) and will definitly have a backup healer in the pull group with the cleric and chanters.  That alone will reduce the high number of deaths you suffered.  Getting one or two more levels before then will help as well. <p><b>Daxanu</b> - 52 Druid <br>

 Aww Dax,<br>
<br>
  I wasnt putting any blame on anyone, and if it looked like I did, I apologize..I just felt useless that I couldnt do what my Role called for and do it well enough to keep alot of my raid members alive. I know you and Casben had your hands full..getting exp there and or loot was the last thing on my mind. I go on Plane raids expecting nothing,I just wanted to have a good time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ..<br>
<br>
 We had alot of things go wrong,but you guys pulled it together as best you could. I thought more enchanters were coming and being in the pull team with the only other enchanter, trying to do the mezzes and getting tells for clarity and speed and not having the mana to do it mad me feel inadequit when I know darn well I am hehe. I am a good Enchanter and am proud of where I got her..I just wanted to make my team mates proud I guess..once again hun  no need to apologize  HUGS <p>Adenia Reviel 51th Illusionist<BR>Second in Command and Recruiting Officer of<BR>Twilight Marauders</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utanthalamon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tanthalamon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 312<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/21/01 12:18:43 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.skybusiness.com/jkowen/T2.jpg width=120 heigh=120></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Best Team., the Worst team for a Fear raid</span><hr size=1> One thing that I have noticed is that the mobs in PoF seem to be less chanter friendly now days too...<br>
<br>
Used to be that a 51 chanter was plenty to mez without problems, they seem to resist a hell of alot more now though, I normally have a druid from another group with a hotkey set up &quot;/tell xxxx Keep the chanter alive at all costs on this pull&quot; *shrug* <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Also having main assist that knows which mobs are harder helps, so that they can get rid of the higher resist mobs which makes it a whole lot easier on the chanter/s.<br>
<br>
Also, with the mana thing... I find that a lot of the time chanters and clerics for pull team aren't loud enough... by this I mean... the necro's on the raid are there imo to serve pull group mana... /shout FEED ME! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
