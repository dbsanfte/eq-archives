<br>
Ixtab C’Boath, Reaper of the Violet Harvest, stood upon a gibbet made from ceremonial yew, carefully selected from the forests under the guidance of the priests and druids of Tunare. Arranged before him in a semicircle lay the elders of Felwithe and Kelethin. The General of the Guardians, the High Priest of Tunare, all of the leaders of the Arcane Paths, and even the Heartwood Master looked upon him with cold, pitiless eyes. Standing behind them as they sat in their ornate chairs of judgment, was the tall enchanter, clad as always in his worn blue robe. Ixtab grinned in mockery at the assembled tribunal, no fear in his heart, but rather, only intense hate and disgust. He had no fear of death, for he had done the work that Innoruuk had decreed. His place in the Plane of Hate was assured to be a high one, and he had no dread of that meeting.<br>
<br>
The High Priest rose and said, “I ask you again, Ixtab C’Boath. You have heard the charges of espionage, sabotage, murder, collusion and high treason against the Peace of Faydwer. Have you nothing to say in your defense?”<br>
<br>
Looking down from his lofty vantage, Ixtab only smiled and said, “I stand before you relishing the fact that you are so inept that you cannot protect your own citizens within your city. While I did not hold the knife that killed your soldier, Celestramis Ecthalion, I did indeed witness it. I will tell you all, never have I seen hatred of the kind displayed by the executioner of that worthless brat. He smiled as he slid the dagger through the pale one’s ribs, piercing his heart and taking his life. The hatred of the moment was…” Ixtab took a deep breath and smiled, “…most exhilarating.”<br>
<br>
The General stood erect and slammed his hand onto the pummel of his sword, but before he could move, the enchanter’s hand fell upon his shoulder. With a perfunctory glance at the High Priest, who nodded acquiescence, Nostramis Ecthalion moved around the General’s chair and approached the gallows. His face was calm, but Ixtab could read the hatred within his eyes. Ixtab smiled to see the change in the Knight Templar. He had nearly become one of their slaves in hate, but someone else would have to see the end through. Ixtab’s sole disappointment was that he would not live to see the day when the enchanter’s proud visage would contort in ragged humility as a slave of the Harvest.<br>
<br>
“I thought you should know, Reaper of the Violet Harvest, that when I took you prisoner outside of Dagnor’s Cauldron, I was not alone as you had thought. In fact, my squire was hidden amongst the rocks. What do you suppose he found there, hidden when you knew you had no escape from my magical bindings?”<br>
<br>
Ixtab’s heart skipped a beat. Some of the color faded from his dark face as the cold-hearted high elf held out his hand. A soldier came forward holding a black pack – Ixtab’s pack that he had hastily hidden near the lake shore. Ixtab’s face was contorted in rage as Nostramis Ecthalion undid the pack bindings, then held the pack upside down. The single object that remained within the pack fell to the white flagstones of the square with a hollow, tinny clang. Ixtab’s eyes tracked the chalice as it fell, and his knees buckled as he watched the artifact hit the stones. It had been his to safeguard, his responsibility as the leader of the Harvest. Without it, the Compact had no meaning.<br>
<br>
Ixtab sagged, only the noose around his neck holding him up. He never heard the final utterance of the King of Felwithe as he pronounced judgment against him, nor did he see the nod that was given to the enchanter. He stared at the cup upon the ground, lost to his people, lost to the Chosen.<br>
<br>
“For Celestramis, for the Light, and for Justice,” Nostramis pronounced in a voice free of emotion. A creaking sounded as he looked toward the enchanter. Their eyes met and locked, hatred matched against hatred. The trap opened, and the rope snapped tight. As the world darkened in his bodies final, strangled effort to survive, Ixtab’s spinning eyes saw only the chalice and the blue robe, the chalice, then darkness.<br>
<br>
   ***                        ***                ***<br>
<br>
After the body was burned, and the assembly dispersed, the Priests of Tunare gathered about the chalice testing the means of its destruction. For weeks, they attempted to destroy it, but they failed at every turn. The essence of hate was not theirs to destroy, and so they reported their failure to the High Priest. Pushed into the pack once more, Nostramis Ecthalion was summoned to reclaim it and to remove it from Felwithe.<br>
<br>
The High Priest, pity in his eyes, said, “You did well to remove this artifact from the hands of our enemies Nostramis, but it cannot remain here. As you have had contact with it already, and seem to have endured, I would ask you to take it and find a place where they may never again have access to its evil. Perhaps the other knights of your order can aid you in this.”<br>
<br>
Nostramis shook his head and replied, “No your grace, I would not bring such a thing among them. But, I know a place where the Teir’Dal fear to go, a place where the artifact will be safe. And, I have a friend among the peoples of this place who will safeguard this artifact with his life. There is no other place in Norrath that is a more fit resting place for this putrid symbol of decadence and evil.”<br>
<br>
The High Priest nodded, and Nostramis bowed, turning to go. “One last thing, Nostramis. Your family has served the peace of Faydwer since the new realm was established. Have a care that you do not fall prey to the very forces against which you have been sired to defend the Light.”<br>
<br>
“Worry not, your grace,” replied the Knight Templar. “I have seen what they offer, and have rejected it. My quest now is for Justice, not for hate. I will continue my hunt until this prophet of theirs is tried, and the White Raptor is executed. I will not rest until Justice is served.” <br>
<br>
The High Priest looked intently upon the enchanter, then nodded. As the last scion of House Ecthalion departed, he furrowed a worried brow and prayed that Tunare would watch over him and prove his words to be true.<br>
