Tucking away his medallion of Rodcet Nife the Prime Healer, his hand brushed against a silken scarf.  The dawn-colored silk he touch was woven as fine as the spiders webs, he thought of the elf maiden that had given it to him, with the promise of her love and her hand.<br>
<br>
Her scent floated up to him, drawing forth a picture of his beloved Lauralife.  With hair the color of burnished wood, and violet eyes that make his heart quiver, he was hers from the moment he met her at the Estate of Unrest. <br>
<br>
He had been separated from her for too long, but her love and faith in him gave him the strength to complete his quest.  A quest given to him by the leader of the Paladin guild in Freeport, he must bring back the hilt of the missing Soulfire!  His destiny was to weild the mighty sword, and conquer the minions of evil.<br>
<br>
Glancing around and seeing that his friends were ready, he stepped between the gates of the castle.  An eerie darkness had settled over the once beautiful lands, the smell of death and decay filled Yellexin's senses, and again he touched his love's silken scarf, drawing strength from thoughts of her.<br>
<br>
Soon the group was fighting their way through the hordes of undead in the courtyard, approaching the castle doors, they heard lilting music, seemingly coming from all around them.<br>
<br>
Pausing in a relatively safe spot to rest and heal, Phalaon and Utno consulted their map.  On the second floor of the castle they would find Xicotl, the Troll Shadow Knight that Yellexin must defeat to gain the swordhilt.  They would have to fight their way through to the throne room and lure him out to fight.<br>
<br>
Cautiously they entered the castle, all was quiet, the minions of evil had fallen back to lick their wounds from the previous battle.  The Pledge familiars and Initiate familiars had been no match for the powerful group, it had been a surprise when the gargoyles floated down from the ramparts and beset them, but they had been dispatched with minimal injuries.<br>
<br>
The beauty that had been in the castle was still evident as they entered the entry hall, stained glass windows cast the hall in strange lights, and everywhere they looked there was a beautiful work of art.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Great wealth corrupts the soul&quot; Yellexin spoke without thinking.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, my young friend,&quot; answered Mentor, one of the leaders of Yellexin's guild, the Protector's of Norrath.  &quot;And the lord of this castle is a most corrupt soul, beware, you will be a prime target for him, it is told he likes to make the faithful turn against their gods.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Mayong Mistmoore is a cast out Teir'Dal, infected with the disease of Vampirism and Greed the elder council of Neriak banished him eons ago.&quot;  Spoke Phalaon, the dark Elf Necromancer.<br>
<br>
&quot;What?  I thought your kind worshipped the god of Greed.&quot;  Said Yellexin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Paladin, follower of Rodcet Nife, we will continue our religious debate another time.&quot;  Phalaon spoke caustically. <br>
<br>
&quot;I look forward to it, Necromancer.&quot;  Yellexin replied, meaningfully.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you two are quite done, I'd like to kill this Troll and get out of here.&quot;  Spoke Utno, man of few words, but great wisdom<br>
<br>
Entering the ballroom they saw a young looking female gypsy sitting on a dais surrounded by gypsy dancers and musicians.<br>
<br>
&quot;Welcome fair skinned visitors, my lord, cannot meet with you just now, as he is still abed, but he will be rising with the setting of the sun.  I'm sure he would like to have you for dinner.&quot;  Spoke the young gypsy.  Rising to her feet, she placed her lute upon the cushion she had been seated on.<br>
<br>
&quot;Be careful, my friends, this is Mynthi Davissi, the leader of the gypsies that Mayong has seduced with his empty promises.  She will try anything to win you to the side of evil.&quot;  Said Utno, Shaman of the Protectors.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahh, you have heard of me!  Good, now, since you know my name…it 'tis only fair I know yours.  You, beautiful flower, what is your name?&quot;  Mynthi turned to Kitarian the Half-Elven Druid.  Reaching towards her face, hoping to draw her into her trance.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vile fiend!  It was your kind that stole my happiness.  Minions of Greed and Death!&quot;  Kit spat in her face.<br>
<br>
The gypsies rose to their feet at this insult.  Moving towards the heroes, they seemed to be unarmed.<br>
<br>
Drawing their weapons the Protectors stood their ground, inviting the gypsies to come, dance the dance.  Through a hard won battle, the gypsies and their leader were defeated.  Yellexin strode to the dais and picked up the lute, engraved upon it, was the name of the gypsy princess that Mynthi had once loved, and followed to the side of Evil.  <br>
<br>
Turning to Mentor, Yellexin presented him with the Lute of the Gypsy Princess.  Taking the lute, Mentor cautiously strummed it.  He felt his magic rise within him, truly this was a powerful instrument.  <br>
<br>
A voice spoke in Mentor's mind.  &quot;I can offer you more than a mere trinket.  Come to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shaking his head, Mentor turned his attention to what Yellexin was saying.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think if we go upstairs we can lure Xicotl out from his guard duty of Lasna Cheroon.  But remember he is a Shadow Knight, his god gives him powers similar to mine, yet his are deadly to his foes.&quot;<br>
<br>
The group cautiously moved out of the ballroom and up the stairs into the throne room, the wonders they saw made the rest of the house look shabby and cheap.  Where the gypsies lived there was beauty, but here, where Mayong held court over his subjects, was breathtaking.  Gold and gems were inlaid into mirror frames and fixtures, fine silks and velvets bedecked couches and chairs.  The throne itself was a marvel, once carved with images of spring and life and the beauty of love, the animals and flowers carved into the wood had become feral and decayed.  The beauty was still evident, but somehow evil and horrific.<br>
<br>
Mentor paused in the doorway of the room, letting everyone pass around him, marveling at the beauty and the horror.  His heart cried out for what the world of Norrath had lost when Mistmoore turned to his evil side.  <br>
<br>
&quot;You can live here with me, sweet bard.&quot;  Spoke a soft female voice in his ear.  Turning to look Mentor thought he saw the shadow of a female dart off towards the opposite end of the throne room.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sweet Wood Elf, you warm my blood with passion, come to me, be my lover.&quot;  Another voice whispered to him.  <br>
<br>
This time the figure beckoned from the doorway of a bedroom.  Seeing golden hair and a bright smile, Mentor unthinkingly started to walk forward, to her, the woman he had dreamed of.  <br>
<br>
But no, that woman was not his to claim.  She loved another.  Bitterness welled in Mentor's heart, &quot;Why didn't she love him?  He had given her his heart, and she tread on upon it unthinkingly.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I will not betray you, dearest love.  Come with me, and be mine for eternity.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mentor walked the final steps to her, the woman in the doorway, the woman who would make him forget.  Sweet bliss would soon be his, love for eternity.  All he had to do was surrender the fight.<br>
<br>
Yellexin looked around at the sound of the door shutting, searching each face, making sure no one was missing, he couldn't find Mentor.  Going to the hall outside, he could not find him.  Then seeing the door at the end of the throne room, Yellexin strode toward it, afraid of what he would find behind it, but he knew he had to find his friend.<br>
<br>
Slowly opening the door, he came upon a site that froze his blood.  Four vampiresses had lured Mentor into the bedroom, through the opposite door was Xicotl, Yellexin could see him.  The Shadow Knight had his back to the doorway, he hadn't seen the Paladin yet.  His chance was now!  Kill Xicotl and get the hilt.  But, Mentor was in trouble, even if he hadn't yet realized it.  Torn between friendship and his desire to finish and gain the sacred sword Yellexin paused between the two doors.  Looking over his shoulder her saw his friends once again engaged in a battle.  They looked well enough, but Mentor, his friend was in trouble.<br>
<br>
The vampire wenches were whispering seductive words to Mentor, seducing him with caresses and thoughts.  Tempting his soul, defiling his thoughts. Pillaging his mind, they found words of love that Mentor had dreamed of.  They wormed their ways into his soul and found the longing for the one woman Mentor had given his heart to.  They whispered words that she had not.<br>
<br>
Suddenly Yellexin caught the scent of lilacs and wildflowers, the same scent that his beloved druid wore.  He spoke one word, that word was &quot;Lauralife.&quot;  Drawing strength from her name, her love, Yellexin was prepared for battle.<br>
<br>
Hearing another voice in the room, the vampiresses turned. Hissing and baring their fangs, two broke off from their vile work.  Flanking each side of him, they tried to seduce Yellexin, using words that Lauralife had spoke to him, with voices distorted by their fangs.  Sickness rose in Yellexin's throat, to hear the words of Lauralife coming from these creatures was almost enough to drive him mad with anger.  But then Lauralife's voice cut through his thoughts and their words.  He heard her speak of his bravery, his honor. Their love.  He saw her face the day he asked her to marry him, the tears of happiness streaming down her cheeks when she said yes, he felt the tears that he had shed when he heard that one sweet word.  He knew these creatures needed to be destroyed, he knew he must save his friend from his own despair.<br>
<br>
Turning his back to Xicotl, Yellexin lifted his sword in salute to his enemy, he engaged the first two creatures in battle.  The wenches fought with tooth and nail, magic and sword.  After the Vampiresses had wounded him many times, Yellexin called upon his God for the strength to continue the fight against the two others still holding Mentor.  Feeling the life flow back into his veins he continued, fighting his way towards his leader and friend.<br>
<br>
When Yellexin glanced at Mentor, he almost made a fatal mistake, the hatred and lust he saw in Mentor's face was almost enough to make him stop fighting.  The pure loathing in his leader's eyes made his heart feel like granite.  <br>
<br>
The prayers to Rodect Nife, died on Yellexin's lips, as he felt dispair and a great loss.  But no, he would not let evil win this day, he would not abandon his friend, to his own self-loathing.<br>
<br>
With a shout, Yellexin ran towards his friend, feeling too slow, too late.  NO!  His love and faith, Lauralife's love and faith in him, gave him the strength he needed.  With a mighty swing of his sword, Yellexin cut off the head of the vampire coming toward him.  A thrust, and the sword was buried deep into the heart of the other.<br>
<br>
Mentor turned and with a feral snarl, he jumped on Yellexin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why didn't you just leave things be Paladin?&quot;  The Mentor-thing hissed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Because my love would not let me, I could not go home to my beloved without you at my side, my friend.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Bah, love, it will cast your heart to the floor and walk across the fragile surface.  That is what SHE did to you!&quot;  An evil voice echoed in the halls.<br>
<br>
A deep chuckle came from the doorway.  &quot;Run Paladin, and take the bard with you, before the Master find you.  'Tis not your day to die, the love you have for your lady has reminded me of the love I turned from in my youth.&quot;  With that Xicotl tossed Yellexin a bottle.  &quot;Sprinkle that on his eyes, and wipe away the darkness with love, and he will see clearly again, but I warn you, go now….or I will do as my master bids me, for there is deep evil in my heart.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yellexin, trusting the Shadow Knight, sprinkled some of the liquid onto Mentor's eyes, using Lauralife's scarf, he wiped the disease from his friend's eyes.  <br>
<br>
Mentor blinked, looked around and saw the Troll, drawing his blade he started forward.  Xicotl just stood there, watching.  Yellexin stopped Mentor, &quot;No my friend, we have others to gather, let him go.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bowing to his honorable enemy, Yellexin turned and went back to his friends.<br>
<br>
They used the magiks of their druids and wizards, and walked through portals of time, to the forest of Greater Faydark.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why did you stop?  We could have killed him!&quot;  Mentor exclaimed.<br>
<br>
&quot;He saved our lives.&quot;  Yellexin said, and turned to find his bride-to-be.<br>
<br>
Gathering her close in his arms, he realized he had fulfilled his destiny.  He had found love.<br>
<br>
<br>
  <br>
 <br>
Dedicated to One who has left us to walk other paths.  Yellexin I hope you find love, it was never lost, just hidden by other things.<br>
