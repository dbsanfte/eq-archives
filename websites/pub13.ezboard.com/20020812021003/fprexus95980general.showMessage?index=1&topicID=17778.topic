<br>
Second of all Shirellia, your post is so full of circular logic and ignorance, I don't even know where to start, so I will just take it one at a time.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I'm going to have to add my voice here, how can anti-drug laws be unconstutional?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
The constitution spells out rather clearly the responcibilities and limits of government. Proctecting our people from themselves is not one of them. Further more, using 40 billion dollars of tax payer money a year to try to stop people from doing drugs, and action that has had no impact on the number of drug users, is a complete and utter waste of taxpayer moneys.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> that is wrong there, for since we founded the country over 200 years ago, drugs have not been a big part of the country except TOBBACO.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
And? We can't rewrite the constitution as we see fit with out an amendment. FYI Alcohol was always a big part of America as well.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Where as pot is the least dangerous of all the drugs out there, it is STILL dangerous.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I see, so because pot is one of the least dangerous drugs available (less dangerous then two of the legal drugs, tobbaco and alcohol) congress has the arbitrary right to take the choice out of the hands of the individual. Wrong.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I do not like the IDEA that people building my cars think that they can smoke pot on a break and go back to work and think they can do a better job high!.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Yeah that is pretty stupid. This is completely irrelevent to your arguement however, most employers have rules reguarding coming to work under the influence. The kind of person that thinks comming in to work high is a good idea would do it weather it was legal or not.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I don't like the idea that there are people who get high or drunk and then DRIVE HOME!. I don't like the idea at all.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Most people don't. Hense we have DUI laws. There is already a system in place to deal with such people. Again, the kind of person that doesn't know when to say when, isn't going to know when to say when regaurdless of the legality.<br>
<br>
All that aside, Alcohol is much more of a DUI problem then pot, and will continue to be reguardless of weather drugs were legalised.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> It is my right to advocate the ban of the use of drugs.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Just because you don't like something, doesn't give you the right to take it away from everyone else.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> let me ask you this: would you personally fly in a plane maintained by someone who gets high?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
As long as they don't do it high, sure. For some reason you have this image painted of all pot users that they smoke all day, everyday, including at work. That is not the case.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> that is PROVEN that the tech is high.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
So the company should fire the guy for coming into work fvcked up? Just because a small percentage of people can't get their priorities straigh, doesn't mean that prohibbitional legislature is a good idea. In fact, history shows quite plainly what a bad idea prohibition is. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Would you take your car to a guy/gal who smokes pot on the job or comes to work stoned?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Again, what does this have to do with the legality of anything? Of course I wouldn't want anyone preforming a service for me high anymore then I would drunk. This line of questioning is completely not at the heart of the issue, or in anyway relevant.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> and what happens when POT doesn't give you the same high anymore? what do you do then... go to coke? heroine? opium?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Actualy, the whole pot gateway drug thing has been disproved time and time again; the vast majority of pot users stay pot users and don't go to heavy drugs. Your lines of questioning get more off topic, illrational, illlogical and ignorant as you progress. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> drugs are a dead end road, most societies that allow drugs for their workers end up crashing down around the people and no one there realizes it's their own addictions.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Again, the vast majority of drug users do not hit rock bottom. You have a really illogical, senstationalistic view of this topic, and your opinions are based largely on emotion in stead of historical referance. And again, wtf are you talking about for their workers. This isn't about weather people should be able to work messed up, clearly that is dumb.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> LASTLY: how much are you willing to pay for your addiction? eventually your life will be forfit by the drugs you wish to use. wether it be in a house or a CAR that could hurt someone else.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You are completely right, everyone who has a drink when they get home from work is fvcked! Seriously, how can people even believe this @#%$? Does everyone just believe every sensationalistic news story that comes down the pipe?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> ps: if you use it, it's your life.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
My point exactly, why did you post all of that just to contradict your self on your last sentance? If you think that, then why do you think the government has the right to pass legislation on social morality?<br>
<br>
Don't take any of this personaly, the vast magority of our populace is ignorant about drugs and drug prohibition. Believe me, this is on pourpose, if they weren't then the section of the government that is responcible for passing out drug information would be out of a job.<br>
<br>
If you want to wage a social vietnam on the people of our country just because you don't agree with their lifestyle, then you are no better then the brits we had to kill off to get our independence. It completely boogles my mind how people can so take their liberty and rights for granted, only 200 years after we won our independence.<br>

BUT just because I have a conviction and thoughts about it doesn't mean I am going to force them upon you in your own home.  but let me ask you this:  how many times can 1 hit of acid get you high?  before you think too hard and say ONCE, you would be wrong (if you said more than one good for you.)  ACID is held in the base of the spine and can be re-released into your system 20-30 and 40 years or more AFTER you take the 1 hit. <br>
<br>
Look if you THINK you can control your ADDICTION, think again.  how many times do you think hey it's 5pm, I can get high this weekend!??? that's adiction plus you don't know the mechanic that works on your plane, that you expect to fly in, is high or not.  and you can squak all you want about how unfair it is for people to be regulated about drug use, but how many people FLAUNT the law just to get high? just to get $1000 off some druggie that can't wait to get high?  The american dream is to be rich and independant.  well I would like to add to have a feeling of being safe.  I don't feel safe going into areas where what I have is something never gotten by others.  I don't feel safe that I'll be left alone by a druggie or whino looking to get some cash off someone.  So I learn to defend myself and when i have to use it I get charged for use of excessive force???  EVERYONE'S freedom of religion and action ENDS where there is a chance that some one can be hurt.  I am tired of having to second guess drivers out on the road who are high or drunk.  <br>
<br>
JUST don't confused at someone who knows there isn't much to do about things and contradicting oneself.  I think if you use drugs, or smoke you should be locked in an airtight room so I can't smell the crap you exhale till a HEPA filter clears the room and if it was drugs you are off your high.  <br>

I am sorry you disagree with me so much you think i'm an idiot for saying what I would like to see happen.  I go to a bowling alley to bowl a few games and have fun, why do I have to put up with people drinking till they are drunk.  THEN they take a 15 pound ball and throw the thing down the alley from the pit.  or they do things to mess with me playing my game, by being LOUD, obnoxious and rude to EVERYONE in the place.  WHY then when the cops are called on them, they whine, at the top of their lungs, that they weren't any of that.  I speak out against MIND ALTERING DRUGS that this country has deemed ILLEGAL and most other countries do as well.  you think this country is bad... try to take some dope into Saudi Arabia and get caught.... I think the minimum for that is life in prison.  <br>
<br>
Smoking, do you like the smell of cigerettes? cigars? or the look of someone spitting while using chew?  if you're in a place that allows smoking, do you like coming home smelling like a chimney but worse?  Do you like breathing in something that is known to cause cancer?    How about as you walk down the beach... I remember a time where you could walk down a beach and the biggest worry about walking bare foot was the sharp shells and the pod-pops (not sure if that's the right word.)  NOW you have to worry about glass from bottles thrown into the night by drunk people.  and stepping on the nasty cigerette butts left by inconsiderate smokers.  I have to watch my 6 year old in places like that to make sure she doesn't pick up anything like a cigerette butt.  and make sure My 10 year old son knows to say NO to smoking and drugs.   show me the proof of what you say is true and that I'm wrong... the medical proof is there for my point (about acid).  <br>
<br>
CASE IN POINT:  rock band Pink Floyd, had a singer by the name of SYD BARRETT.  he FOUNDED THE BAND.  He is no longer with them, but is remembered in their songs, especially from the album the WALL and The Final Cut.  They had to hire David Gilmore because SYD would take ACID all the time, it was &quot;COOL&quot; to do so.  and when he couldn't perform because of a bad trip, DAVID would take over lead Gituar.  finally the group HAD to instutionalize him in the &quot;Fletcher Memorial Home&quot;  the song they had on the final cut is about that institution where SYD is.  if ACID isn't bad for you and doesn't come back at you then why did that happen???<br>
<br>
DRUGS, smoking and drinking are bad for you.  hell so is drinking coffee (just another DRUG (caffeene)) and eating hot dogs, white bread, chips, salt but the key is moderation for most of it, but ONE HIT of bad dope can kill you.  or other drugs, lenny bias mid 80's basketball superstar gets picked up for the chigao team and goes out and parties!!!!! dies that night of FREE BASING.  now his family has to mourn his loss, he will never play for chigao, and never grow older than about 20-22.  tell me again how drugs are good for you and give me a good laugh.  <br>

&quot;It completely boogles my mind how people can so take their liberty and rights for granted, only 200 years after we won our independence.&quot;<br>
<br>
Isn't that exactly what you're doing? Abusing your freedom and liberty by thinking it is your god given right to smoke an illegal drug? Freedom does have its limits you know, just like everything else in the world. I don't give a crap if you like smoking it. For all I care, you can smoke it all you want, however you better not put anyone's life at risk by getting high and you better smoke it far away from me otherwise, YOU will be invading my freedom of having the right to breathe fresh air, in which case I would proceeed to pound your arse.<br>
<br>

No, there would be obvious benifits for that and a viable alternative.  There are no benifits to a prohibition, except to drug dealers.

I'll wil be glad to defend my point on this topic. The hysterical claims you posted (acid remaining in your body for 40 years) were originaly announced by the dea/media in the early 60's, shortly after it was delegalised. The thing is, in the early 60's they would have had no way to know that, or prove that. Why? The first time LSD was ingested by a human being was in the 1950's (though it was first produced in the 1910's). Anyone that has any basic idea of the history of the substance could tell you that. <br>
<br>
As for you pink floyd example, yes lsd can have long term psycological repercussions. Someone who already has a manic depressive history who takes large doses of lsd regularly could very well be causing major psycological harm to themselves. But that is not the result of lsd remaining in their spinal cord lol. You ask me for scientific evidence, I offered you the opinion of Andrew Weil MD. For your &quot;CASE AND POINT&quot; You offerd anecdoteal evidence, which of course has no bearring in a debate.<br>
<br>
You pointed out one example of one person hurting themself. What about the alcoholics that were cured at a higher rate then the control group from LSD treatment? Why are doctors now not allowed to use this substance for testing even though the merits of this substance have been published in many medical journals? <br>
<br>
And for the one person that screwed themselves up by doing too much acid too often, there are hundreds of thousands of people out there that did not have a negative experiance with the substance. Why does their liberty suffer because one person could not moderate?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> DRUGS, smoking and drinking are bad for you. hell so is drinking coffee (just another DRUG (caffeene)) and eating hot dogs, white bread, chips, salt but the key is moderation for most of it, but ONE HIT of bad dope can kill you.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
The only times people die from one hit as you say, is because of problems directly tied to the prohibbition, thank you for fueling my debate. You see, if drugs didn't come in varying levels of purity and additives (which they would not if they were regulated) then doses would be predictible and as you said, &quot;the key is moderation&quot;.<br>

I never once said that generaly speaking, drugs are good for you. Quite the opposite. That is not at the heart of the issue. The issue is this: People are responcible for their own actions, it is not the governments responcibility to protect them from themselves. The only thing the war on drugs does is wastes 40billion dollars of your money annualy, creates massive crimminal underworlds and destroys the economies and social structrues of countries around the world (look at what our policies have done to columbia). Now, I could see the denifits of this program if we were actualy cutting down on the level of drug use in this country, or the amount of drugs imported into this country. After spending 50 years and tillions, we have not gotten either number to budge slightly. It is quite obivious we are working from a flawed premise.<br>

Second of all, if you take every line in a message and not consider the rest of atleast that paragraph or whole message of course it will not make sense.<br>
<br>
with that said, Heavy tree, you seem to pick apart everything I say.  I still have not seen your MEDICAL proof (you mentioned a date and a possible reason why it was said then) so I still hold my ideas.  in my post, everything was being used to SHOW that drugs are dangerous things (even alcohol).  and There are more countries that are less &quot;FREE&quot; than the US that control the substances, and there are more free contries that also control.  The legislation used is NOT a moral statement, It is a statement that this country does care for it's people.  If you want to use the moral legislation argument get into the gay/lesbian debates!  it has been medically proven that drugs and alcohol destroy your mind over long time use.  Some people can not make the educated decision about drugs as others, so are you saying that the government should allow something that will prevent the poor and uneducated to know this is bad? the laws tell them that.  speeding is bad, leaded gasoline is bad, unconsentual sex is bad.  all these are impinging your freedoms:  to go at what ever speed you want, own a car that hasn't been modified from the early 60's, and to prevent having sex when ever you want to (prostitution, rape, sodomy, etc...).  hell there are laws preventing oral sex, and other forms of sex that people find fun.   get on those instead of this drug legislation for that is for the over all betterment of the people.  <br>
