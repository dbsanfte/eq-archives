It was approaching dawn, and thus was almost time to close. It had been a quiet night, and there were only two drinkers in the tavern. The barkeep himself was a retired mercenary, the eye patch attesting to the need for his retirement. Only someone who was desperate for cash or a fool would trust his martial skills to the depth perception of only one eye. So the barkeep, one Grezza, had taken what money he had made as a sell-sword and opened this tavern in a less grand part of Neriak. It was not as seedy as many, but far from reputable either. If there were any dregs among the Teir’dal, this is the place where they would gather. The customers spoke their mind, when they were sober enough to speak at all, and many an unvarnished truth was let out for exercise. In Neriak, with everyone watching and listening to everyone else to catch a crumb of information which may someday be turned into a banquet for the cunning, most did not speak unless it was necessary. The wrong thing said to the wrong person could result in a fatal mistake. But in this tavern, and a few others, those who spoke either didn’t care or didn’t know enough to be considered either useful or a threat.<br>
<br>
Looking up from his labors, Grezza let out a sigh and poured himself a drink. The two other Teir’dal in the place, a common worker and a worn out streetwalker, turned to face him and listen. They knew what was coming, they had heard Grezza’s long winded complains before. They also knew if they listened and added their own opinions, the barkeep may pour a few “On the house”. For all his ramblings and whining, Grezza would occasionally say something insightful. But mostly, it was the frustrated spewing of a self important has-been. Looking out across the empty bar, Grezza put on his most sanguine face and decided to play social commenter and  fortune teller for his guests. Taking a deep breath he said, “ Now look at how empty this place is, you know who’s fault that is don’t you ?”. The other two in the bar knew they didn’t have to say a word, because for the next half hour or so Grezza would tell them exactly who’s fault it was. He continued, “It’s the damn noble’s fault, that’s who!”. Pouring another drink for himself, and two for his audience, he went on, “Not a one of the so called Great Houses of the Empire are worth a troll’s fart!”. As the two Teir’dal accepted his drink and sat closer, he went on, “ If they are so Great, and the Empire so strong, why aren’t I wearing Koada’dal skin gloves, or Halfling hair socks?”. Leaning back he went into one of his little speeches about the whole matter and what was what.<br>
<br>
“ Most nobles are either too stupid, too weak, too greedy or have their heads too far up the Queen’s arse to do anything other then parade around and sniff their personal incenses. When I was out fighting, and earning my keep mind you, it was different. I wasn’t born into money and the protection of a House Guard, I had to be strong enough to survive by my own hand. The noble’s idea of a hard campaign is having to camp out in the rain and carry their own swords. It’s the commoner who does all the work and fighting in Neriak. In fact, the King and Queen would probably be able to do wonders if they didn’t have the parasite nobility leeching off of them. All these celebrations for so called victories, well were is my share? I didn’t see the weak kneed nobles handing out gold and gems from there personal vaults, did you? Mark my words, one day soon, someone is going to get everyone together and slit all their worthless high-born throats, then the people will take the power that is rightfully…”<br>
<br>
Grezza did not get to finish his sentence. In the middle of it, the worker stood up, made a rude comment about what he thought of tonight’s lecture. The commoner said that if Grezza thought he could do better, then let him gather his own army and try striking at the enemies of  Neriak. Because, as Innoruuk knows, there are more then enough of them out there. They were just waiting for any sign of disunity or weakness to sweep in and exterminate them all. All the Respected Race would be killed or enslaved. The Royal Line, Noble Houses and every man, woman and child commoner as well. As the worker left the bar, the street walker also glared at Grezza. She said that she would take a noble’s platinum piece to a commoner’s silver any time, and for anything. She told Grezza that if he really believed what he said to pack up and move to Freeport, that sweet smelling paradise of beauty and flowing riches where the common people really do run things. Grezza waited until both had gone, and locked the place up before retreating into his private office. A short time later there was a knock on the back door, and he opened it to let the visitor in. Nodding once, he spoke in a low whisper, in a coded language that only they two would understand. The messenger nodded his understanding and left silently into the night.<br>
<br>
Later, as General Zirrix sat in T’Rhennic Keep and went over the various intelligence reports, he came across the biweekly report of Sargent Grezza. It had listed the names of the two from the night before, and their responses to Grezza’s speech. It also listed the name of several others who had not shown such enthusiastic loyalty toward the Empire or it’s leaders. Making a copy for his own records, Zirrix dispatched the list to the Clerics of the Spires, a courtesy of sorts. He was a Warrior first and foremost, skilled in steel and tactics. But there are weapons, and there are weapons. The security of the Empire and loyalty of it’s citizens was but a small part of his responsibility to their Imperial Majesties and all Children of Neriak. This was just one report of so many that had come before, and so many more yet to come. Likewise, he knew that he was not the only one who had an intelligence gathering service at his personal disposal. His just happened to be one of the best, rivaling even the Assassin’s guild. What his lacked in contacts, it made up for in personal loyalty to him. Alone in the Keep, in the darkest night, he smiled to himself and was glad that some duties were more of a pleasure then burden.           <br>
