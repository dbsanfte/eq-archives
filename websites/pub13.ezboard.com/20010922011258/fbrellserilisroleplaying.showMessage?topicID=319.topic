The Blue Beast would have been the best boat in EQ if it had existed! <br>
<br>
This is just a curiosity, but anyway see the NPC chat logs below. It's a conversation I haven't seen documented online anywhere. It could almost give you the idea that Verant once intended to implement the Blue Beast. Or maybe it's just a red herring in the form of a silly quest involving too much work for too little reward and it's broken anyway (have we heard that one before?). Did any of you happen to play around with these quests a year ago?<br>
<br>
Scenario: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> You are in EC. You HAVE TO log out in Kunark tonight, but nobody wants to give you a port around the FP area. You've been trying for an hour. It's off-peak and you know what that means... boat ride /shiver. So you stroll down to Freeport docks. Because of Murphy's Law you just missed the boat of course, so you decide to go and have a drink in Seafarer's Roost while you wait. It's boring to drink alone so you try to make friends with that ogre and barbie hanging in the bar.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

[Mon Jun 04 20:41:40 2001] You say, 'Hail Bronto Thudfoot'<br>
[Mon Jun 04 20:41:40 2001] Bronto Thudfoot says 'I didn't know Slime could speak common..go back to the sewer before I lose my temper.'<br>
[Mon Jun 04 20:41:53 2001] You say, 'Hail Lenka Stoutheart'<br>
[Mon Jun 04 20:41:53 2001] Lenka Stoutheart says 'Run while ye still can!! The Wolves o' the North will not tolerate yer presence! <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Ok ok, I get it. Let's chat with the bartender instead then.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
[Mon Jun 04 18:13:47 2001] You say, 'Hail Gregor Nasin'<br>
[Mon Jun 04 18:13:47 2001] Gregor Nasin says 'Sit down and name your poison!  I know we are lacking in originality, but I intend to create some [exotic drinks].<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Yeah yeah, it's the Stein of Moggok quest. I've heard that one already but it's a pastime at least.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
 <br>
[Mon Jun 04 18:13:53 2001] You say, 'what exotic drinks?'<br>
[Mon Jun 04 18:13:53 2001] Gregor Nasin says 'Interested in exotic drinks, are we?  I am attempting to create some of these drinks I read about in this book I found. It was called the [Barkeep's Compendium].  I will first need to get my hands on a few [exotic ingredients]. <br>
[Mon Jun 04 18:14:04 2001] You say, 'what barkeep's compendium?'<br>
[Mon Jun 04 18:14:05 2001] Gregor Nasin says 'I found the book amongst some garbage littering the ground in Freeport East.  It appears to have been created by an ogre named [Clurg].  I am sure he wants it returned, but I will never part with it.  That is... unlessI get a few [exotic ingredients] I need to experiment with. <br>
[Mon Jun 04 18:14:15 2001] You say, 'who is clurg'<br>
[Mon Jun 04 18:14:16 2001] Gregor Nasin says 'I do not know. Ask an ogre. Maybe they have heard of him. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Hey, maybe this will break the ice with the ogre.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
[Mon Jun 04 18:14:30 2001] You say, 'who is clurg?'<br>
[Mon Jun 04 18:14:30 2001] Bronto Thudfoot says 'You have heard of Clurg? He is considered to be a great barkeep and in [Oggok], that brings respect and power. I would like to meet with Clurg. He is said to be very intelligent and worldly. Alas, I am not liked very much in my home land. <br>
[Mon Jun 04 18:14:33 2001] You say, 'what oggok?'<br>
[Mon Jun 04 18:14:33 2001] Bronto Thudfoot says 'Far away, in the swamplands of the Feerrott, you will find the ogre city of Oggok. I was born there and soon exiled for my intelligence and love of mechanics. Many feared me. I believe I shall never again see my homeland. At least I have my good friend, [Lenka]. <br>
[Mon Jun 04 18:14:37 2001] You say, 'who lenka?'<br>
[Mon Jun 04 18:14:38 2001] Bronto Thudfoot says 'Lenka Stoutheart is my friend. She is of barbarian blood. If it were not for her, I would never have survived [Guk]. After Guk, we made a quick alliance and have traveled the world of Norrath aboard the [Blue Beast]. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Yawn... go on, Mr Ogre</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
[Mon Jun 04 18:14:46 2001] You say, 'what Blue Beast?'<br>
[Mon Jun 04 18:14:46 2001] Bronto Thudfoot says 'The Blue Beast is our ship. It is most likely the fastest ship sailing the seas of Norrath. It is a design all my own. Lenka says it is best to anchor it far from shore to keep the rogues from it. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Hmm... interesting. Let's see what his girl has to say about it.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
[Mon Jun 04 20:41:57 2001] You say, 'what blue beast?'<br>
[Mon Jun 04 20:41:57 2001] Lenka Stoutheart says 'You're joking, right?  You have never heard of the Blue Beast?!!  She is the fastest ship in Norrath.  She made the [Kunark run] in under three weeks.  She was designed by [Bronto]. <br>
[Mon Jun 04 20:42:07 2001] You say, 'who bronto?'<br>
[Mon Jun 04 20:42:08 2001] Lenka Stoutheart says 'My trusted friend.  Together we travel the world aboard the [Beast].  He is quite skilled at boat making and other mechanical skills.  He has a heart and brain far superior to any ogre I have ever met, as well as most other races. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Wow, she must really be in love... A smart ogre?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
[Mon Jun 04 20:42:31 2001] You say, 'what kunark run?'<br>
[Mon Jun 04 20:42:31 2001] Lenka Stoutheart says 'The Kunark run is the most dangerous run between Freeport and [Firiona Vie], in Kunark.  If the seas don't rip your hull to splinters and the pirates and sea wyrms don't kill you, you can make a quick run back and forth, avoiding any unwanted inspections. <br>
[Mon Jun 04 20:42:56 2001] You say, 'what firiona vie?'<br>
[Mon Jun 04 20:42:56 2001] Lenka Stoutheart says 'Firiona Vie is an elven outpost on the continent of Kunark.  Every so often I run supplies to and from there.  Do not even think about asking me to take you there.  It will be months before I can make improvements on the Blue Beast to make it impervious to aerial attacks.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Hey, that's a teaser if there ever was one. I'll lend you a hand! But I doubt we'd be finished before my other boat arrives. Oh there it is. Sorry, gotta go. Some other time!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Later(!) in Firiona Vie. Before heading out of town, a quick  visit at the local bar: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Oh look, Mr Thudfoot and Ms Stoutheart are here in FV already!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
[Mon Jun 04 23:39:10 2001] You say, 'Hail Lenka Stoutheart'<br>
[Mon Jun 04 23:39:11 2001] Lenka Stoutheart sips on her ale.  'Look what we have here, Bronto!  A would be hero! <br>
[Mon Jun 04 23:39:11 2001] Bronto Thudfoot puts his head over your head as if measuring you.  'Heh!!  Going to have to grow up before the General lets him out to play in Kunark!' <br>
[Mon Jun 04 23:39:11 2001] Lenka Stoutheart says 'We're just kidding with you, kid. Heh.  Although they are making heroes kinda small these days.  Hey, you [want to see something interesting]?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> They're trying to fool you into doing the supposedly broken Cabby Pale Ale quest. Let's get them back on track!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
[Mon Jun 04 23:39:16 2001] You say, 'where is blue beast?'<br>
[Mon Jun 04 23:39:17 2001] Lenka Stoutheart says 'The Blue Beast?  She's around.  Doing fine and faster than ever.  Afraid I don't carry passengers any more.  Contraband... er, I mean, freight is where all the coin's at.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Oh, so you fixed it already? I would gladly have paid up to come along. Now over to Mr Ogre.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
[Mon Jun 04 23:39:42 2001] You say, 'where is blue beast?'<br>
[Mon Jun 04 23:39:43 2001] Bronto Thudfoot throws his mug out the nearby window.  'Blasted Gunthak Pirates!!  We rammed into one of their sloops at night.  Took me two days to repair the damage!!  Would have seen them if we hadn't taken that shoddy boat beacon from that bum in Freeport.' <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> There's a funny animation here when Bronto throws the mug. Try it! BTW, the Gunthak are the pirates in OOT, Timorous and FV. All are on Gunthak faction.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
[Mon Jun 04 23:39:43 2001] Lenka Stoutheart says 'Yes!!  Those accursed scum of the high seas.  And that kid who didn't know how to forge a simple beacon.  Kinda looked like you!!  Nah.  Must be the grog. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> End of conversation. Oh what if there was a boat like that in EQ!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
There is a related and apparently broken quest, the painting quest, starting in South Qeynos with Danaria Hollin. It leads to Palatos Kynarn in Chops &amp; Hops in East FP. He doesn't want to talk to anybody else but the &quot;captain&quot;, which is a metaphor for Captain Orlin's Spiced Ale that you could buy in the very same bar. If you gave him some of that ale, he would give you a boat beacon stand and tell you to get him a beacon in exchange for the painting. Chatting with the gnomes next to bank in North FP would lead to a smithing recipe and supplies to make a boat beacon. If you succeeded in smithing a beacon and gave it to Palatos you would get xp plus the painting for Danaria. However, I know someone tried to give it to Lenka in FP and got some xp for it. <br>
<br>
Now what if you had given the beacon to the FV version of Bronto instead? Did any of you try? It's too late to try now. That Captain's vendor ale was removed in a patch, including all bottles in player inventories. One source says that happened already in Feb 2000 (= pre Kunark). That might be wrong though. It has been debated whether Captain's ale can be brewed. Whereas some vendor drinks have turned out to be brewable, there is no known recipe for this one.<br>
<br>
Oh well, as I said, just a curiosity. But I thought it was a funny one.<br>
