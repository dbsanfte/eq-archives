He just wants to see what other people think of em. Dumbly is sorry for the crudeness, he wrote this before the insparation left him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The young halfling warrior wiped the rain from his face and griped his sword tightly. He looked into the small round dwelling that he stood next to. A burly old halfling man stood inside talking softly to his wife in soft tones as not to wake his four sleeping children. The young halfling turned around, his tears blending with the rain. His name was Hottil. He was the son of a thief named Rolbe. His father had been drafted into the Guard of the Wall when the goblins mounted an attack from their foul cave named Runnyeye. Rolbe had been placed in a group with a halfling named Gilbert. Their small division had been charged with raiding runnyeye while the goblin’s main force was attacking. Rolbe led the way into the dungeon, and had not gone three steps before the full force of the goblin’s forces beset him upon. The small party was decimated, except for Gilbert, who had managed to hack his way past the goblin force and hide while the others were killed. Almost dead, he had crawled out of the cave and returned to Rivervale to a hero’s welcome. Hottil didn’t consider him a hero. He brought stories of Hottil’s father killing his own men in an attempt to escape, and of Hottil’s father hiding beneath the corpses of his own troops.  He was killed while trying to spare his life with promises of help defeating his own people. Hottil had been outcast due to the disgrace of his father. He had to earn a living killing the young and the very old halflings. He prayed on those smaller than him just to stay alive. With each crime and with each kill, his animosity towards Gilbert increased. He had come to finish it. He had come for peace. Silently drawing his blade he watched as Gilbert and his wife crawled into bed. <br>
<br>
Gilbert had five children. Dudley was the oldest and smartest, he showed a natural talent for swordplay and was loved by his father and admired by his younger brothers and his sister. Dumbly was the second child and by far the dimmest. What Dumbly lacked in intelligence, he made up for in pure strength and drive. He was good with a sword, but preferred more vicious weapons such as claws and scythes. Dumbly looked up to Dudley and hoped to become as good as him in the art of war. The next brother was Dodley. Dodley loved animals and was taken with the druidic arts. He had enrolled in the druid school and was doing very well. His sister Maggendy followed in his footsteps. Didley was the final brother. His mother claimed Brell himself touched him. He was in rolled in the clerical school to perfect his arts so he could help his brothers with the battle against the goblins of Runnyeye.<br>
<br>
Dudley and Hottil were of the same age and had bumped shoulders many times. They hated each other with a passion only known by those in the deepest of love or hate. Each time they fought, Dudley would best hottil. This made Hottil hate Gilbert and Dudley more. He constantly plotted his revenge.<br>
<br>
Hottil slipped through the open window, as silent as a soft summer night’s breeze. He stopped by the bed of Gilbert. Raising his sword he cursed Gilbert’s soul and stabbed downward. Gilbert let out a small moan and then became quiet as his life’s blood soaked the bed sheets. “Gilbey?” Gilbert’s wife asked as she shook his limp form. She died as quickly as her husband, her soft scream dieing with her last breath. <br>
<br>
Dumbly couldn’t sleep. He had overheard his father talking to his mother. His father was going on a journey to Freeport, and he wanted to take Dudley and Didley with him. Dumbly was saddened by this. He loved his father more that anybody, but his father always overlooked him because he appeared rather slow-witted. Dumbly knew that he was as good, if not better than Dudley. When he heard his mother’s soft wail, he grabbed his scythe from beside his bed. He looked over and saw Dudley sleeping soundly across the room. Suddenly, he noticed that the door was opening. Wasting no time, he jumped up and slashed at the intruder.  The intruder cried out, and with a wild slash, disarmed dumbly. Bleeding profusely out of the gash opened by Dumbly’s scythe, he ran out into the rain.<br>
<br>
Hottil was surprised at the bravery and skill of the young halfling. Hottil decided that Dudley would have to wait for another night. Nursing his grievous wound, he fled into the night.<br>
<br>
The next morning, Dudley awoke to the weeping of his brother. Dumbly knelt at his father’s side, cradling him in his arms and rocking back and forth, tears streaming down his face. “ Dumbly not want papa to die! Papa, Dumby want you to come back. Papa come back!”<br>
Dudley put a reassuring hand on his brother’s arm. “ Dudley and Dumbly will be ok. Dudley can hunt and Dumbly can too. Didley and Dodley will help too. Dumbly will see, Bumpkins will be ok.”<br>
<br>
After they buried the bodies of their mother and father, Dudley and Dumbly set out to hunt.  Dudley and Dumbly’s skills were put to the test, but they overcame anything in their paths until they were able to provide good food and education for Didley, Dodley, and Maggendy. Then, they went after the evil Mooto, who had been killing young adventures in Misty Thicket for quite some time.<br>
