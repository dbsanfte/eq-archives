<br>
1. You talk about a guild rejoining a list, but don't address an alliance.  Personally, I'd make them post the 18 again, but it's up to you.<br>
<br>
2. You have listed guilds which will not be allowed on the list due to perceived levels of membership.  You may wish to state under what conditions you will be removing guilds, in the future, who can currently fight Vox/Naggy, and how they might appeal it.<br>
<br>
3. I've never run a message board before, but requiring a small guild to create one might be a little excessive.  If I ran a small guild of under 20 members and planned to keep it small, I'd mostly just handle issues in-game and through emails; but that's just my style.  Plus, having a board can mean very little.  Someone could throw one up quick and have it just be a front.<br>
<br>
I'd suggest that if you see a guild tag in game, that should be enough.  If Verant can recognize it as a guild, don't see why the reservation system can't.  Not sure what you are trying to prevent with this limitation.<br>
<br>
Everything else looks good.  Nice job.<br>

<br>
Let's say you have an alt that is the right level to kill an old world dragon. You play that alt alot as you also play your main. Why should your alt not be allowed to do its thing independently of the main?<br>
<br>
A real for instance ( not to mention names ) is a mid 50's Necro in one guild with a low 50's ( dragon level ) Paladin Alt in another guild. I think the Paladin should be counted toward the 18.<br>
<br>
Also there are alot of guilds that are bringing up alts as their mains reach the upper 50's. Why should these alts be penalized in their chances at early Dragon loot with their guilds?<br>
<br>
With Naggy all you NEED is 4 groups and with Vox 5. Recommended is one more group for each. By forcing the up and coming Alts out and forcing the equivilent of 18 early non-duplicate sign-ups for each raid, aren't you hurting the chances of Indies, Alts and Power Dragon Raiders ( like me ) from being able to be involved in Old World Dragon Raids?<br>
<br>
To say to me &quot;just level up and do Gore&quot; is trying to tell me how to play the game. That is just wrong. I feel I have a better chance at a Vox Book than I would have at a Gore book, both because of the orginization of Vox reservations and the drop rates of the book between the two dragons.<br>
<br>
Note: These are my personal opinions and not that of my guild or guild leadership.<br>

Making those changes defeats the purpose of what Twiggie is trying to do by letting the exploiters right back in. <br>
<br>
Verant made a level limit on vox and nag to keep higher levels from farming em. While I'm normally an FCFS advocate, I'm willing to accept that didn't mean they just wanted you to level up an appropriate alt so you could keep farming it. They wanted to cut out a niche for the lower level dragon raider. <br>
<br>
If you want a vox/nag rotation that actually serves people wanting to do this with thier main character, you have to cut out the alts. If you are a member of a guild that CAN kill the other dragons, you shouldnt be wasting the time of the people who can't. <br>

They have the wisdom, experience and patience to try to make everything run smoothly and fairly on the server.  I salute them all.  My question is what exploits they felt was happening before these new guidelines were instituted?<br>
<br>
As a frequent Naggy raider in need of the elusive red scale for my epic, I enjoyed attending the raids run my guilds w some higher level dragon raiding experience.  These guilds ran efficient, effective raids and by doing so taught the low level raider in attendance quite a bit about raiding on a larger scale.  I also do not attend raids where I dont agree w the loot policies - specifically claiming of more than one item on a raid not counting duplicates - and those older guilds that I raided w were not doing this.  However I do understand that some of these guilds might have been exploiting the loot drops.<br>
<br>
I have also attended the raids run by some of the younger guilds and feel that they, for the most part, are a great learning experience for both the raid leaders and those in attendance.  It might take a little longer to drop the dragons and there might be a few more corpses on the ground at the end of the battle, but I have yet to attend a Naggy raid w a guild I would not join for a second Naggy raid.<br>
<br>
With the new requirements to lead a Naggy raid, what guilds will still be able to run a Naggy raid?  I dont imagine the same guilds will be interested in running these raids month after month.  As you know, leadin raids is a very taxing experience to most.  I am certainly not saying that the smaller younger guilds are not capable of running excellent dragon raids.  I personally enjoyed the mix of young and old guilds we had w the previous requirements.  As I said, the more knowledgable guilds running Naggy raids help to educate younger raiders.  The more knowledgable the raiders on our server, the stronger our server becomes.  <br>
<br>
My fears...that a lack of guilds able to meet the requirements will cause these dragons to become FCFS.  I know that many of you think this would work well at the current state of our server.  I need the red scale to complete my epic but dont want to be camped in Sol B for the rest of my days watching for someone leading a raid - then hoping I get chosen to attend.  I enjoy the use of the sign ups where raiders can chose to attend or not depending on the time/date/loot rules.  At the same time, speaking as a frquent raid leader, it is nice to be able to pick your raiders from a posted list, helping to insure you have the strenght of raid before moving to the raiding location.<br>
<br>
I realize that there are dragons other than Naggy that drop the scale that I need.  I certainly havent been level 52 for years as have some bards.  Hanging at 52 has some advantanges...I never have to worry about gettin a rez and am always available for the death touch on a raid.  I would also like to end this post by saying that I trust the wisdom of Twiggie and the other mods and will follow any rules they implement.<br>

It's more of a &quot;give it to me if you have one&quot; type of request.  When I did my first read, I think I just lumped all the information requested as a &quot;have to have.&quot;<br>
<br>
Prior to this, I had not ever read the rules because I did not host raids for these dragons and was never interested in signing up as an Indy.<br>
