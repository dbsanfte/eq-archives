I haven't heard about these guys, how about some info?<br>
<br>
Bloodboil spawns in the NW corner of the zone, in the little mushroom farm next to Gearheart.  He has an undead sprite PH, but he seems to spawn at least half of the time, although his wing drops pretty rarely (haven't seen it yet in 10-12 kills).<br>
<br>
I haven't seen Bilewretch yet, and I've been spending a bunch of time in LFay lately, between the frightling earring and Warden of Tunare quests.  I would guess that frightlings are his PH, but they are getting killed day and night, so either he's broken, triggered, or spawned from something completely different.<br>
<br>
For people interested, earring from frightling skull is AC5, +20 mana/hp, +6 disease, a nice replacement for my forest loop.  <br>
<br>
The cloak from Bloodboil's wing is supposedly AC5, +10 cha, and maybe a few other junk stats. Nothing special, IMO, except for bards and maybe enchanters.<br>
<br>
There's some interesting stuff going on in Lesser Faydark, let's get some information flowing in this thread.   <p><P><p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="4" color="#0066CC">Silkwind Swyfteblade</font></i></b><br><hr>

<br>
1) He looks just like the Avatar of Fear in CT. <br>
2) He spawns at the pixie tower in front of the doorway.<br>
3) He is 50th level<br>
4) Ros Sundering with fire nukes work fairly well on him as well as the swarm DOTs<br>
5) IC, snares, roots, and stuns were getting resisted alot<br>
6) He is a rare spawn<br>
7) He will sometimes warp onto you when you're kiting him.<br>
8) He max hits somewhere around 170 (rough estimate)<br>
9) He has several thousand hps (rough guesstimate is about 10K-12K)<br>
10) He dropped the 2 items that I noted in a post above this one.<br>
11) My group consisted of 2 low 50s druids and a low 50s wizard and we had a hard time with him, but we got him without dying.<br>
12) Because of all the crap that's floating around that zone, it's better to pull him off to the side of the zone away from the mobs of irritating agroed greens that HT you. (You'll know what I mean if you've been there lately)<br>

I was bit conflicted about killing her, after what Tylin told me, but she aggroed on me, so I didn't have much off a choice.  Green at 55, but nasty, lots of resist and fairly hard hitting (80-100).  All she dropped was Unicorn Horn Fragments with effect: purge, so either she has a rare drop, or we can do something to &quot;cure&quot; her.  Might be a long shot, but maybe we can give her the purified horn we get for the druid epic. <p><P><p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="4" color="#0066CC">Silkwind Swyfteblade</font></i></b><br><hr>

Bilewretch ive still yet to see and on xegony there have been  very few times there hasnt been a couple of 50+  killing the frightlings trying to get him to spawn.<br>

Equestrielle the corrupted is part of the quest with Tislyn &lt;sp&gt;  he mentions her when you complete the quest for Bloodboil with him althoughy when i handed in equestrielle's horn drop i got no reply.<br>

<br>
  1) GM confirmed during day 2 of the event on Cazic Thule<br>
      that, on our server, Bilewitch is broken.<br>
<br>
  2) Equestrielle the Corrupted drops everything that the<br>
      normal Equestrielle would drop (two horns) neither of<br>
      which are the quest item. She drops one seeming<br>
      quest item (an eye) which does not seem to be the<br>
      quest item (dropped all of twice since the event<br>
      started). Equestrielle is also messed up, she can HT<br>
      you then warp across the zone (yup, no bugs there)<br>
      She cons green to me at level 48 but sure isn't green<br>
      and she seems to spawn 2 or 3 times every RL day.<br>
      The ranger mentions her in the &quot;ask me more about this<br>
      word&quot; text but never has responded to any questions.<br>
<br>
  3) The Dread Lord/Dread Caller - same mob, same graphic.<br>
      If I am not mistaken, with the information I've been able<br>
      to peace together they are for the evil quest. The Dread<br>
      Caller is the more common spawn of the two and the<br>
      spawn for the Caller seems to be 1 day real time. I've<br>
      only seen the Lord twice, myself and a 60 druid killed him<br>
      once.<br>
<br>
  Its sad but these quests could be really good. Unfortunately,<br>
  they are riddled with bugs, plauged by long spawns and<br>
  painfully low drop rates. Even the GM on my server petitioned<br>
  about the no spawn of the Bilewitch. Also, notice there are<br>
  3 spawns that are supposed to be killed before the<br>
  Equestrielle spawn needs to be killed. I fully believe that the<br>
  item from Equestrielle + the other 3 items would end the<br>
  corruption or at least net a really nice item. So far the only<br>
  two reported items have been the earring (ac5 6DR <br>
  20mana/hp 5 charges of Force) and the cloak ac5 10cha<br>
  10pr/dr 25mana/hp 1 charge of FayGate).<br>

Only one of any rarity besides Bloodboil's wing I've gotten seems to be the hoof off the blighted mare. I've only gotten that once out of maybe 30 kills.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure about kill Equ the Corrupted because of what Talisyn says about not taking mercy on her.  However it would not surprise me if you do have to kill her anyway, since senseless slaughter is always a motif of GM events on my server.<br>
<br>
Is Syssyri the Purifier a mob for the evil quests or is she another possible quest npc for us?  She is a female brownie who cons &quot;ally&quot; to me but will not respond to any hails.  She stands on the hill next to Talisyn and is usually up.<br>
