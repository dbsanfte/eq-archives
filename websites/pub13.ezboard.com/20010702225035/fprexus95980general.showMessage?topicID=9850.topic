I don't want to bring up any names, and I would guess its not the only time it has happened.<br>
<br>
<br>
A cleric friend of mine was invited to a plane raid with the guild he was in.  The cleric was asked to wait around for 2 hours which he did.  After that time had passed the cleric was then given a tell that a lev 60 had shown up so he was not wanted any more.<br>
<br>
<br>
The cleric is a great dedicated player, hard worker and never complains about loot.  He did everything told to him and then was told to go away.  BTW he is to nice of a guy to not complain and whine about it.  What I never understood is why they did not just bring him up.  It never hurts to have one more cleric and the lev 60 I am pretty sure was not worried about loosing out in the loot.  He has very seriously considered leaving his guild over this incident, and will probably do so.<br>
<br>
<br>
People when you organize a large raid and ask someone to come along and ask them to wait around.  Just because you get someone better dont send them packing its such a lack of Curtosy and plain ole decency. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#AADDDD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukanin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kanin</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/7/01 3:14:55 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/kaninspirit/kanin.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sad Lack of Curtosy on Prexus:</span><hr size=1> His own guild bumped him?

Sorry there is NEVER an excuse.  . PERIOD.  You dont have your guildmate wait around for 2 hours only to tell him..  &quot;Sorry, we got someone from outside of the guild who's higher level then you so there's no room.&quot;  I surely wouldnt want to ever raid with you again knowing how I could attend the raid and be replaced at a moment's notice because a char a level higher then me deceided they wanted to go along as well.<br>
<br>
I was in a guild who did this to their members.. guess what.. that guild doesnt have the most sparkling rep anyway.  I left the guild and I was much happier for it.  Perhaps your friend should consider going solo.. there's alot to be said for solo'ing without a guild <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   It's very relaxing!!<br>

<br>
I have a hard time thinking of an example why they should legitimately do this either; I was saying *if* some reason I don't know of came up and they felt they had to, then between just saying you're out or being apologetic and explaining, I pick apologetic and explaining.<br>
<br>
If you are saying they shouldn't do it - see my first point, that they should really try not to. Maybe there are no situations where they should, maybe there are some, but either way you didn't disagree with what I said. You just assume there are no reasons ever, and my answer includes what to do in case there are some reasons we haven't thought of.<br>
<br>
And if they made a mistake? Well, people do that. If they recognize it and change their ways when he asks, he doesn't necessarily need to leave the guild over it. Better to let them know his issue and see how they react than to just leave, how are they going to improve if they don't get the info? <p>Arch Mage 60, Master of the epic elemental magics, collector of robes<BR>

<br>
I think the raid was to hate or fear I am not sure.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Cleric was somewhere between lev 53-55 so level should not be a concern.<br>
<br>
<br>
I don't know if the lev 60 was guilded or not but that should not be the point.<br>
<br>
<br>
The problem is how do you complain about the situation without being labeled as a baby/whiner.   My friend is fairly new to the guild and did not want to make any waves.  Petoffen made a good point in that the best policy would be to complain about it to the guild/raid leaders at the time.  However the cleric is not that type of a person and the fear of getting a bad label is a real one.<br>
<br>
I think a mistake was made by whomever made the call and just blew it off as not important.  I made this post not to put blame on a guild but to help people realize how people can be hurt in an incident like this.<br>
<br>
<br>
By the way I have had a similar type thing happen to me where I was invited to join a group and then ran all the way there just to be told never mind we got a higher level shaman.  However this was one group and I was not stuck waiting around for 2 hours.  Not like they could have me string along. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DDDDAA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uellocopato.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ellocopato</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/7/01 6:14:06 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sad Lack of Curtosy on Prexus:</span><hr size=1> Your friend should leave that guild.<br>
<br>
Your guild is your EQ family.  They are there to help you along, die by your side, help you achieve goals, go on to better brighter things.<br>
<br>
If the guild picks someone else outside of the guild over you because of your level, it sends a warning sign to their commitment to you as a person.<br>
<br>
If it was two guildies and one slot, that would be another matter.  This doesn't seem to be the case.<br>

Maybe the person in charge of organizing people was real dumb, and didn't know that your friend was in their guild.  Maybe someone somewhere accidentally replied to a tell to the wrong person incorrectly.  I think that your friend should give the person in charge one (1) chance to explain what happened.  If the answer is not satisfactory, /bye guild.  <br>
<br>
That's just my oppinion, and I wouldn't hold it against the cleric if he just popped on, /guildremoved and joined someone else the same day.  I try to give people a chance to redeem themselves but sometimes I think people have already used all of their chances, and I give up.  I don't know what other experiences your friend has had with this guild.

IMO I think there is always room for a cleric. ;-)<br>
<br>
that is unless you have a specific amount of groups and each group has a cleric.<br>
<br>
<br>
and if he went up or in the plane with his group.. hes there.<br>
<br>
if another cleric comes in readjust the groups to fit him/er in.<br>
